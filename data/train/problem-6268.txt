“I have an entire team of lawyers at my disposal, just waiting for this kind of thing. They would love to get their hands on scum like that.”
Steve’s mouth is suddenly very dry and he feels like he might hyperventilate. He bites his lip to get a hold of himself again. His head finally catches up and he takes a deep breath. He doesn’t usually get nervous around celebrities like that. He’s had a couple high rolling clients over the years. But for some reason Tony Stark was different. He was attractive, and assertive, and Steve found it a little more enticing than he should.
They make their way over to the couch where Tony brings out a tablet and they start searching through the restaurants that deliver. They eventually decide on a Mediterranean place that serves kebobs. Tony places the order, and they sit with their feet on the coffee table, their bodies touching, as they look for something to watch on TV.
Ryan drops to his knees and tears Steve’s jeans down below his thighs. He starts stroking him, and then Steve feels hot breath right over his tip. He squeezes his eyes shut and thinks about Tony, how he felt when he touched him. The way his body responded to his caress. He’s suddenly fully hard, and Ryan takes it to mean what he’s doing is good work. But it’s not Ryan. It’s Tony.
Tony moves down to crouch between Steve’s legs. He coats two fingers with the lube and then presses one into Steve’s tight ring. Both of them grunt at the sensation.
“Yeah?” Steve says back, his mind still elsewhere. He’s pretending he’s with Tony, the smaller man cuddling into his chest. He could fall asleep with a thought like that.
The guards must have noticed something was amiss, because seconds later they have stepped up behind Tony and Steve and are looking at Paul, trying to decipher the situation.
Steve nods and puts the tape measurer in his pocket. He tries not to let his breath shudder as he reaches out and briefly makes contact with Tony’s sides. It’s like electric running through him, and he knows that if he doesn’t hurry, this is going to make him way too hot.
“What is this, Tony?” he demands, not realizing that he’s yelling until his words come out. “Did you send me this out of pity? Because you want to take care of me?” he demands.
When Tony gets in, he instantly connects his hand with Steve’s and brings it to his lips briefly. They don’t talk the whole ride back to Tony’s place. They just sit in silence, and Steve sees Tony scanning every intersection looking for danger.
Steve likes how easy it is with Ryan. He can just…be himself, or at least, a version of himself, and the sex is enjoyable. It may be a job, but at least it’s not the worst job to have when an attractive, rich man wants to fuck you and likes it when you get off, too.
“Then come over tomorrow, and have a list of supplies sent to this number so I know what to have ordered.” Tony hands him a card with a phone number on it. “That’s my number, by the way,” he continues. “Don’t give it to anybody.”
They head back to the elevator together and get on. Tony presses the floor for the ballroom, and when it arrives there, Steve steps off.
“Me too. Sometimes I can work for days in the lab and lose all concept of time. I have protocols designed to force me out of the lab after 72 hours with no sleep.”
“Steve,” says a voice from behind him, and when he spins around he sees Tony in a black T-shirt and slacks, no shoes, looking slightly confused.
Steve opens and closes his mouth several times, trying to find the words but not quite about to. He needs to tell Tony about Paul, about the threat that might be looming outside right now. He needs Tony to know that he could be in potential danger, that being his boyfriend might be more trouble than it’s worth.
Tony watches him go, and Steve tries to hide the fear the has cropped back up into his chest. He wants to push it aside, he wants to ignore it and pretend it’s not there. But he can’t, because a threat against Tony, or a threat against him, can’t be ignored. He has to make sure things are safe. He has to make sure that
Steve nods and pulls out his phone, scrolling to the unanswered messages Paul had sent him when he’d first cut things off.
Steve goes to lean against a wall and watches the scene unfold. More people come in, some high-ranking faces that Steve has seen on TV. There are even a few journalists wandering through and taking note of whose who. For some reason, Steve finds his eyes drawn to the door where security has set up. They are checking invitations and admitting people into the event. Steve is looking for Tony Stark, and he doesn’t even realize he’s doing it until he sees the man flash an invitation and enter the room.
“You’re going to be old one day, Steve,” Tony insists. “I want to remember you as hot as you are now.”
“Looks great,” Tony murmurs, turning so he can kiss Steve again. The kiss lasts for several moments. Not too deep, but enough to convey emotions and feelings for both of them.
They hang up, and Steve suddenly feels okay again. The fear that has crept into his chest is pushed down, even if just minutely.
“Sorry to hear about the delay,” he says, and then he shoves his hand into his pocket and pulls out of his business cards from his wallet. “I do sculptures, and I work quick, if you find yourself needing another one in the future.”
He’s surprised that someone has already brought around his car. The valet hands him his keys, wishes him well, and then Steve drives towards home.
“Well, I wanted it marble. But I don’t think there’s enough time to order another slab and have it delivered before the party.”
It’s morning when Steve stretches and realizes that Tony is still wrapped around him like an octopus. He stays put for a while until his bladder forces him to shift slowly so he can get up.
They don’t talk much about their respective pasts, and for that, Steve is grateful. He thinks that Tony understands that the sex for money part of him is over, that he’s focusing on art now. He thinks that maybe Tony can understand why he ever did it in the first place, but they don’t talk about it so he really can’t be sure.
“Will you be able to make the show tonight?” she asks him, ignoring his silence on her previous comment.
Steve moves his hands until they’re flat against Tony’s stomach, feeling slowly and trying to keep his thoughts strictly professional. He moves them up, almost reaching Tony’s shoulders again before he feels something under the thin material of Tony’s shirt. It feels like a scar, a long, deep scar.
Steve’s head goes somewhere else. Back to Stark Tower, where Tony let him touch his face, let him run his hands over his beard. Steve had said it would help him find the right lines to carve, and Tony had readily agreed. He stood perfectly still as Steve closed his eyes, felt along Tony’s face, feeling over his eyelids, down to touch his lips. Tony had sighed, and Steve had left shortly after that. He’d gone home and ran a bath, thoughts of Tony pushing him over the edge.
Steve can’t decide if Tony is admitting to being bisexual, and single, and if this is somehow a pickup line. His chest tightens, unsure of how to respond next.
Eventually, though, his car pulls up to the dingy motel in the middle of nowhere. Paul prefers places far away, as if somehow the further away the harder it is for his wife to know about his dirty little secret.
Tony laughs back, and then to Steve’s surprise he grabs a chair and sits on the other side of the sculpture. He gestures for Steve to continue, and suddenly he’s very nervous. He works well under pressure usually, but having Tony watching him is just too much pressure.
They get dressed and Tony makes a few half-hearted attempts to convince Steve to stay, but he’s also extremely curious about Steve’s apartment. He’s never been there before, and since Steve has plenty of clothes at the tower he hasn’t had to go home since before the accident. Tony wants to know what Steve’s house looks like, where he used to sit and sleep and eat food. He’s always been curious, but Steve never offered for him to come over before. And now, even though the timing makes him nervous, Tony is excited to be going to this mysterious Brooklyn apartment.
Tony’s eyes tighten and then he holds out his hand for the phone. Steve hands it over, because he doesn’t know what else to do. He tries to listen as Tony chats with the detective expertly. His pulse is so loud in his ears that he can barely hear what Tony says. When the conversation is over, he numbly takes his phone back and bites his lip.
Steve is inching forward, his fingertips just centimeters away from the barrel of the gun. If he can just get his hands around it, he can probably wrestle it away from Paul. And he’s pretty sure he can incapacitate the man. He is strong, and his body is full of adrenaline right now. His hands are shaking, but all he can think about is protecting Tony.
“So far, Mr. Rogers,” the detective goes on, “we have a few reports against Mr. Swanson from different people, but nothing concrete. I believe you. I do. But I need to know what happened so I can open an official investigation.”
Steve’s stomach twists. He forgot about real life. He forgot about his clients, and his promises to them, and his responsibilities.
“But if you see Mr. Swanson and he makes you uncomfortable, please don’t hesitate to call me. I would love nothing more than to put this scum away. But I can’t, if you don’t call.”
It takes a few moments, but finally Steve gets into the groove of carving. He starts with the base of the sculpture, which he is eventually going to lacquer a darker color, and carves shoes above his one-foot base. He doesn’t give the shoes much detail, just makes them exist, before moving up to create a pair of slacks for the statue to wear. It’s kind of strange to half a body with pants, but no defined head, but Steve figures it’ll take at least two days to get to the top part of the sculpture.
“But there’s still so much to see here!” Tony complains. “And we haven’t even tried out your bed yet.”
The whole scene unfolds in seconds, but for Steve, it seems to take minutes. He sees Paul standing on the other side of the living room, right before the carpet meets the tile of the kitchen. He has a gun raised directly at Tony, a terrible sneer on his face, and when he sees Steve, his face only becomes more violent.
“Doctor will be here in a minute,” he says. “I looked at your charts, though. Nothing broken; they should be able to send you home.”
Tony smiles and then kisses Steve as he walks onto the elevator. “I’ll miss you,” Tony calls as the doors are shutting.
He tries to keep his mind blank because he’s not sure he can handle the excitement and confusion at the same time. He needs to soak in a bathtub, and just…think about what just happened before he can react properly. He can’t decide if this whole this was a terrible joke, or if it was a terrible mistake, or if it could somehow lead to something good. What he does know, however, is that he is terrified of tomorrow.
He eventually gets out of the tub and drains the cold water. He wraps a towel around his waist and heads over to his bed, not bothering to get dressed. He lays down on his back, arm over his forehead, and thinks about what he just did: Jacking off to the thought of Tony Stark, who as of tomorrow, will be his boss.
They start off towards the tower with random banter between them. Steve tries to ignore the strange feeling he has, the one where he thinks Tony is more nervous about this whole Paul situation than he is, but he can’t push it aside. Tony is being so protective that it’s almost annoying. Not that Steve doesn’t appreciate it, but it just makes him nervous. Because, how long will it be until Tony realizes that protecting Steve is harder than it’s worth?
“Of course, Steve. From the very first time we met, I was attracted to you. And from there I started falling for you. It’s just the little things you do. The way you smile, the way you bite your lip. The way you’re always trying to take care of me.”
Another week has passed, and still not much has changed. Tony is withdrawn, and that worries Steve. They had stayed in the tower mostly, seeing each other as a routine for meals and Tony would come lay down with Steve until he fell asleep, and then he’d go off and do whatever it was he was working on.
“No worries at all. We had a few buyers specifically request a Steve Rogers original, so I’m glad you got it here.”
“I wanted to see it in its glory,” Tony says, and he stares at the painting for a long time appreciatively. Steve feels nervous as he stands there, but he doesn’t move away. He tries to see what Tony sees in his art, but to him, it’s just something he painted. It doesn’t look like anything special, and it wasn’t even very difficult to do. The hardest part was going home the one night to finish it.
The two of them just…worked well together. They got along, they could work in each other’s presence, and they both wanted to get each other off in the best way possible. What more was there to want?
“When we spoke with Mr. Swanson, he seemed extremely upset about you in particular. It was last week, shortly after your car accident. He claims that you and Lucas are out to ruin his business and his marriage by making these false claims.”
After twisting slightly, and ignoring the pain that has crept back up into his body, Steve can get a better look at Tony’s face. He looks peaceful, but the worry lines have etched into his forehead. He looks as if he’s had a very long night and falling asleep next to Steve is some sort of reward for a day’s hard work.
“Yeah?” Tony says, and the excitement doesn’t escape his face. It’s been a while since Steve picked up a pencil to draw, and for some reason, it makes Tony happy when he talks about it.
Steve groans when the guy licks the cum off his thigh. Not out of pleasure, but out of annoyance. The guy doesn’t take it like that, though. He just smiles like he’s done good work.
It makes Steve feel guilty. Tony is taking such good care of him, but he can’t do anything to repay him. He will never be rich enough, famous enough, good enough to be worth anything to Tony. He’s surprised things between them have gone on as long as they have, just a few weeks in, because of how unworthy he is of Tony’s affection.
Steve fumbles for his phone, dialing Phil’s number again. He feels numb, unsure of what to do. His mind is blank except for the fear that has replaced all other emotions.
Steve steps out into the room and looks around, again hesitantly and he’s sure he looks ridiculous at this point.
Steve’s eyes jump over there and see Tony with a glass of brandy gesturing for him to come over. His feet again do the thinking and he approaches the table.
He collapses on top of Tony, still inside him even as he softens. They breath heavily against each other for several moments. Finally, when Steve is strong enough, he sits back and pulls out. Tony whines at the loss of contact, but Steve only moves briefly to discard the condom and grab his shirt from the floor, wiping them both clean before pressing their bodies together again.
They continue through the gallery until finally coming to Steve’s work, and it might have been an exciting event for Tony to finally see the finished piece if there weren’t somebody else standing in front of it, wearing an expensive suit, hair slicked back, foot tapping impatiently.
It was strange at first, because Steve wanted to find out what Tony liked, what drove him crazy. He wanted to find out because it was what he did with all his clients. Found out what they liked and used it to get them off faster. It helped make sure his workdays passed by quickly. But it took a few days for Steve to settle in, to realize that he didn’t want to rush things with Tony. He wanted to take it as slow as possible, learn what got Tony off because he wanted to please Tony. He wanted to make Tony feel good.
It probably wouldn’t be this busy if Tony Stark weren’t on the guest list. There probably would only be one reporter, maybe two, talking about the newest up and coming artists, and the guy whose art once sold for a million dollars at a charity auction. But, with Tony there, there were hundreds of people moving in and out of the gallery, just trying to get a look at him and the eyecandy he was carrying around for the day.
Usually Tuesdays are cleaning days and he’d spend the whole day just scrubbing his apartment spotless. But this Tuesday he has plans later and he needs to start preparing. He was invited by a friend of a friend to an art show that doubled as a charity event for the rich and famous. He was assured that there would be plenty of people interested in his art, and even if they weren’t it would be good networking. He was promised a small space in the very back of the studio, right beside the toilets, to show a sample of his work.
The man storms out of the office and Steve gets a brief look at his face, shock and recognition crossing it instantly. He averts his eyes to the ground so he doesn’t get caught staring. He’s seen this man on TV countless times. The richest man in the city who owns the Stark Tower, the heir to a fortune after his parents’ untimely death, the smartest, but most impossible celebrity Steve has ever seen: Tony Stark.
Tony eyes him, and for some reason, Steve finds the courage to eye him back. They stand like that for an uncomfortable amount of time, so long that other people start to notice how strange it is.
“Steve,” Tony finally says, turning onto his side so he can look at Steve’s face. “I want you to come home with me.”
“Oh, Steve,” Tony groans. He reaches between them and wraps a hand around Steve, pumping slowly in tune with his thrusts. He wants this to last. He wants to make Steve feel so good that he’ll never want to leave.
“Keep the change,” Tony says, sending the kid on his way. He comes back to the couch and sits down, putting the pizza between them.
Steve’s cheeks burn a little red, and he leans down on his elbows to kiss Tony tenderly. It lasts for half a second before Tony moves his hips and nudges Steve.
Steve stares at the letter, reads it a dozen times, turns it over in his hands looking for the “Gotcha!” stamp. The longer he looks at it, the more confused he becomes, and the more he thinks about it, suddenly, the more angry he gets.
. It’s such a feminine word that he is immediately confused by it. He can’t decide if Tony is chiding him, or if he’s being serious. It takes several seconds of searching Tony’s face before Steve decides that he was serious, and that his word choice was intentional.
Tony slowly withdraws his hands after one final, gentle, pinch to Steve’s nipple. “Alright, babe,” Tony agrees, and with a quick kiss he adds, “But later you’re mine.”
As usual, his car is waiting for him outside. He gets in and then heads for Brooklyn. He feels a little sad to be going home, especially for an entire night, but he knows it’s the best thing to do. He needs to finish work for the art show, and Tony probably has some sort of lab work he needs to get done, and they both need a day apart.
Steve gets up and tosses the condom into the trash. He cleans himself up with a towel Ryan provides and then starts putting his clothes back on, eventually looking around for his other shoe. When he’s got it on, Ryan stands by the door and they walk towards the living room together.
The next few days pass by too fast for Steve. He sees his clients by day, and at night he works on the sculpture. As promised, by the following Monday he is nearly finished. He only has minor detailing to add, then a varnish coat, and paint to finish it all off. All in all, he’s feeling pretty good about the deadline.
“Steve,” Tony says, and then he eyes the sculpture. “It looks great!” Tony says enthusiastically. “You’re almost done.”
Sunday was Kevin. Kevin was twenty-four years old and came from a family with money. He had trouble meeting real people and preferred Steve’s consistent company. Kevin was quite flamboyant, which Steve didn’t mind, but their time together was usually quite short because Kevin had an issue with cuming too soon. And again, Steve didn’t mind because it meant his day could go on sooner.
Steve hesitates, wondering how Tony would feel without the extra barrier between them, but he finally pushes that thought aside. He might have given up his former life for this chance with Tony, but it wasn’t long enough ago to have gotten the results of an STD panel back. He’s never contracted anything, but it’s not worth the risk to him.
Steve nods slowly and takes another step back. His eyes go wide when Paul moves towards him and his instinct to run is only interrupted by Tony grasping his arm carefully.
Tony manages to usher him into a private bathroom, which curious eyes follow them to, and he tells the guards to keep people away until they emerge again. Tony isn’t even a bit concerned about being in the bathroom with Steve right now. He doesn’t care what the press will say. He cares that Steve doesn’t seem to be breathing, and his face is starting to turn a strange color of red.
Steve shrugs. What had he been doing that night? Probably nothing…sitting at home, staring at the invite, wondering what it meant.
Steve chuckles, and then he leans back against his couch. “You maybe…want some company tonight?” he asks.
The saw staring up kicks his mind back into work mode and he starts to carefully slice off pieces of wood. The whole thing takes him two hours. The lines are sharp and he is glad when he’s finally finished and he has a faceless body standing before him.
Paul moves again, this time to shift his knee back into Steve’s stomach. It hurts, a lot, but not as much as the hand squeezing him so tightly that he’s losing blood flow to his member.
Steve bites his lip, because he knows the only reason it brought such a high price was because Tony bought it. He doubts his newest work will bring anything at all. Just something to look at, consider, and move on from.
Tony doesn’t respond, just stares back at Steve as he finishes drawing the eyes. They look at each other for another moment after he’s done until Steve clears his throat. “All finished,” he says, turning the sketchpad around so Tony can see. Tony inspects it before nodding his approval.
It’s morning when Steve wakes up again, and he’s quite aware of where he is. He’s surprised to find that Tony is still wrapped around him, a leg draped over his stomach and his arm wrapped around his shoulders. Steve grins a bit and doesn’t move, even though his bladder protests it.
He isn’t sure what this game Tony is playing is about. He knows it can’t be genuine interest, but maybe something else? Maybe Tony is toying with him on purpose. Maybe the billionaire is just bored and wants to mess with somebody’s head. That seems way more plausible than anything else that runs through his mind.
Back in his car, Steve starts to head for a quick breakfast joint, but his phone rings in his pocket and he smiles a bit when he sees that it’s Tony calling.
It sounds like it’s between Tony and the police, because he’s asking if they’ve “found the guy” and “how hard can it be to track down a totaled SUV.” Tony makes several frustrated noises before pulling his phone away from his ear and disconnecting the call. He sighs in annoyance, recomposes himself, and then steps back up next to Steve.
His hand pumps around himself, slowly at first, and then he feels a bit embarrassed when he grabs his phone and googles images of Tony Stark. There are millions of them out there, but he finds one with Tony on the beach, shirtless, making a funny pose. He’s a lot younger in this picture, but it’ll do just fine. Steve closes his eyes and imagines that he’s there on the beach, and he and Tony are together, they touch each other, hands roaming up and down each other’s bodies.
It takes a few moments for his head to catch up because he’s been so busy with his thoughts, but eventually his feet start moving and he heads down to the parking garage where his car is. He’s got to get home, shower, and then head to Stark Tower. He’d said he’d be there after five, but it’s four now. It might be six before he can get all the way back to Brooklyn, turn around, and come straight back to the city.
On his way back up to his apartment, he stops at the mailbox and grabs his mail. Most of it’s junk mail, but there is one interesting piece from the art gallery where he’d met Tony a few weeks ago. He bites his lip as he climbs the stairs to his apartment, staring at the white envelope for a while.
He pulls out the supplies and Tony sits with his chin on his hands at the bar. Steve gets all the way up to the point of buttering the bread when he realizes that in fact, this part might require two hands. He sighs and turns, looking helplessly at Tony.
“It wasn’t even good work!” Steve groans back. “It wasn’t even worth a hundred dollars, let alone a million!”
Steve looks down, realizing that he must have woken Tony up with his shifting. He sighs again, taking a long, deep breath, before nodding his head slowly. “I’m going to be okay,” he says, and it sounds like a promise.
Traffic is killer, but eventually Steve makes it home. He stashes the money Ryan gave him in his security box under the bed and then jumps into the shower. He rushes through it and then dresses in fresh clothes, ones that will be comfortable to work in. He shoots Tony a quick, “I’ll be there soon” text and then hops back in the car to head towards Stark Tower.
floor, and into the bathroom. Tony starts the bath water and then tugs at the hem of Steve’s shirt, slowly lifting it until he can drop it onto the tile floor. He makes work of Steve’s pants, eventually getting them around his ankles so Steve can just step out of them.
Steve shifts slightly so he can slide out from under Tony without waking him and then goes to the bathroom. He wipes the come off him with a wet cloth and then looks into the mirror for a few moments. He searches his eyes for answers, demands to know why his body betrayed him yet again, but instead, his eyes just stare back. His face doesn’t look angry. It looks…calm.
Steve isn’t buying it. Less than a week ago, Tony had begged Steve to let him take care of him, and suddenly a check shows up in the mail. It’s too convenient.
Steve just plans to nod, but for some reason his mouth says, “What sort of project did you have commissioned?”
Steve laughs again gently. He holds the phone to one ear while he sets up his art table and pulls up a chair so he can work. Tony makes a sound on the other end that sounds like pain, and Steve’s ears tune in.
Tony waves his hand. “Spill a couple million for children, nobody bats an eye. But when you donate a few hundred thousand to an LGBT march everybody’s got an opinion.”
Steve watches Tony as moves through the room, picking out a set of clean clothes and then he starts to gather his clothing. He doesn’t realize that Tony is watching him until he pulls his jeans up over his hips and turns around, and then they grin at each other.
The ride to the police station doesn’t take nearly long enough, and by the time they pull up, Steve’s stomach is in knots again. He’s not sure why he’s so afraid. He simply has to say what happened and then he can go on with his life, but the whole thing has him terrified.
When Tony comes home, he’s got a single blue violet between his fingers. His eyes are grinning as much as his lips are, and Steve just stands there, staring at Tony, wondering how he could ever love anybody the way he loves Tony. Tony just smiles back, kisses him, and wraps his arms tightly around Steve’s body.
Eventually Tony looks up and catches Steve staring at him. He smiles back and shifts up just slightly so he can press their lips together.
“Steve,” Tony moans. “God, Steve. I didn’t know…,” he trails off, because he can’t form a coherent thought.
“Yes, this is certainly a very nice assembly,” Steve agrees. He takes a bite, and then another. “Pretty amazing assembly, actually.”
Steve tries to hide, but Tony spots him and their eyes connect. It sends a jolt of lightning through his body, and somehow, mechanically, he approaches the drawing.
He pulls up his traffic feed from the accident, watches the black SUV weave across three lanes and slam into Steve’s small car. He watches Steve’s car end up on the other side of the road, and then seconds later get slammed into head on. Tony doesn’t like to watch the next few minutes, because when the ambulance arrives, Steve is unresponsive. There is blood. Anyone else might have died in the accident, but Steve had made himself strong and survived worse than car accidents.
Most nights they make it back to Tony’s bed, but there was one interesting incident in the back of a limousine, once on the floor in front of the couch, and one more in the elevator. Steve never knew that sex could be so good with someone else. And not just sex for the sake of sex, but sex with emotions, and feelings, and…
Tony groans playfully, but he stands up and his feet pad over to the bathroom. Steve hears him run a bath, and then a few moments later, Tony comes back and motions for Steve to follow. By the time Steve gets into the bathroom, Tony is already in the water, pointing to the other side.
They finally hang up, and Steve just grins stupidly for a few moments before he grabs his pencil case and selects a shading pencil. He starts to add the final details, and slowly his mind flutters away from Tony and he is able to focus on what he’s doing.
He ended up picking one with a young girl and her mother in the park, having a picnic. They’re both laughing and enjoying their time together. He’d drawn it after seeing the opposite, a crying girl and her mother yelling angrily at her. He’d drawn that, too, and after a few moments of debate he picked up the opposite drawing and held them side-by-side. The lines were pristine, and he’d used yellows and greens to accent certain elements of the drawings. These two drawings were perfect for the show, and with any luck, he might be able to sell them off.
Steve had thought that, maybe, just maybe, Tony would be there in bed when he woke up. But he wasn’t really surprised when he woke up alone. He stretched a bit and then headed for the living room, and when he didn’t see Tony there he knew he’d be down in the lab. Tony was only ever in two places, either on the couch or in his lab.
After the ambulance left, Paul had walked across the street, seemingly unsure of himself, before heading down a small business strip and going inside a building, a bank. He’s stayed there for eight hours, and after, Tony watched him walk across the street to a BMW, get in, and drive away. He followed the car all the way until Paul made it past the last public street camera, and from there, he can’t be sure what happened.
“Tony, Tony,” Steve grunts. “I-I want…,” he has to pause because Tony started to hum around his length. The vibrations send shockwaves through Steve’s body. “Tony, I want you to…fuck me. Please, god, Tony, fuck me.”
“I could do clay, and then overlay it with a paint to make it look marble,” Steve says before his head catches up. “Won’t last as long as the marble, but won’t cost as much either.”
Tony is finally ready to go, and they walk out of the gallery together. The valet brings the car around, and when they get in, Steve feels like the world has been lifted off his shoulders. For the brief ride back to Tony’s house, suddenly everything is okay again. It’s just the two of them and it feels good.
He wanders into the living room and rubs the tiredness from his eyes. The dream he’d been having was such a good one that he wants to draw the scenery while it’s still fresh in his head.
“I’ll finish the varnish on Wednesday,” Steve finally sends back. “You decide if you want it painted or not.”
He goes right to work, starting by creating a small ridge between the top of the pants and the bottom of the blazer jacket. He details it slightly, leaving the blazer open so that he can later decide what sort of shirt Tony should be wearing. He uses gentle strokes to show the curve of Tony’s spine under the blazer, carefully sculpting out the top of a hand inside a pocket, creating a detail for hidden fingers.
, to be fucked against the cold tile wall, and Steve had every intention of repaying the pleasure Tony had been springing on him all week. He made sure Tony was satisfied completely before allowing himself to come, and they stood under the spray of the shower together for several minutes.
Steve watches Tony pull his wallet out of his pocket and hands the delivery guy a few bills, tells him to keep the change. He puts the food down on the counter and starts moving around in the kitchen, all the while with Steve watching him.
The blow job doesn’t last long: Steve’s been pent up for way too long, but when Tony laps up every bit of his come Steve starts to shift so he can repay the favor.
“Well…,” he pauses, unsure of how to ask the question, unsure of what answer he even wants. “I was talking to the curator today and she asked me who I was bringing, and I just said I was bringing you, because I didn’t know what to call you. And just now I was thinking about how nice it was to do the dishes with my boyfriend, but I don’t know if I can call you that…because I don’t really know what we are, or if we’re just fuckbuddies, or what this is. I guess we never talked about it.”
“Oh, I know it will,” Paul says. “I just need to get rid of you, Steve. I need to make sure you can’t cause me any more trouble.”
Steve nods, and slowly reaches down to retrieve the brush. He grunts in pain, and it doesn’t go unnoticed.
When Steve pulls back, he looks at Tony again. They just smile at each other. This moment feels perfect.
Tony backs off for a second, jumping up to dig through his night stand until he finds the bottle of lube that has been left lonely in there for so long. He uncaps it and pours a good amount into his hand, slicking himself up and then going to sit between Steve’s legs again.
He wants to call Tony, to tell him he can’t come finish the sculpture today. But the timeline is too short. He has to finish carving and put the first coat of varnish on. He has to do it tonight or else it won’t be ready in time for Tony’s party.
“Well, I made sure there would be stuff in here for you. In case you decided to become a chef again.”
“It is not sympathy money!” Tony yells back, finally frustrated beyond holding his emotions in. “I didn’t know they’d send you a check! How many times can I say it?”
But, over the last two weeks, there has been no sign of Paul. It’s been silent. Not even text messages or phone calls from the man. If Steve didn’t know better, he’d be relieved. He would love to think that Paul just moved on, but he just doesn’t know if it’s true. Steve thinks he may live on edge for the rest of his life, expecting Paul to cause havoc at the most inconvenient time possible.
Steve nods, and when the door clicks shut behind Paul, he takes a deep, shuddering breath. He looks at the clock, glad to see this torture only lasted for forty-five minutes. He came faster than usual.
Steve doesn’t respond, because that’s not the case at all. He would love to try, he would love to just let Tony take care of him and keep him safe and never have to do what he does ever again. But it’s not a reality. They might get along for a few weeks, and then Tony would get tired of him. He’s start thinking about all the other people who had fucked Steve, and it would tear them apart. And then Steve would be a broken mess and go groveling back to his clients and have to find a way to survive on his own again. He doesn’t think he can do that.
He hadn’t though too much about the gallery since he’d been busy with Tony’s sculpture, and with his regular life. He’d honestly forgotten about the whole thing, about his drawing of the girl in the park.
They kiss like that for another few moments. Steve can feel Tony’s bulge growing hotter, and he takes his free hand to loosen the belt on his pants. Tony lifts his hips so his pants can slide down his legs and he kicks them off onto the floor. Steve touches Tony through his boxers, feather light touches at first, before gripping him and pumping a few times.
Tony’s eyes momentarily widen, but he hides it quickly. “Of course, babe. You do you. I’ll order some food while you’re in there. We’ll figure out a game plan when you’re ready.”
“Goodnight, Steve,” Tony whispers, kissing him on the cheek lightly. He keeps his hand over Steve’s chest, hoping that it’ll be enough and he won’t wake up alone in the morning.
Steve heads back to the elevator and then gives one final wave to Tony before the doors close and he heads back up to the ballroom. He has to adjust his pants slightly, annoyed with himself for being unable to keep it professional. It’s so strange for him because nothing affects him like this usually. He doesn’t get hot and bothered when he sees an attractive man on the streets. He doesn’t have to hide a bulge in his pants when he’s anywhere else. What is it about Tony Stark that does this to him?
“Or was it a tax write off for you?” Steve says absentmindedly, not completely sure he even said it out loud.
Steve stands up, still biting his lip. He’s pretty sure he tastes blood, but he needs to step a few paces away from Tony.
When the doctor comes by, he looks at Steve’s charts before asking him if he can get up. Steve forces the pain away until he’s in a seated position, his legs over the side of the bed. He doesn’t like the way Tony is watching him like a hawk, but he knows that if he can’t get on his own two feet, the doctor won’t let him go home. And for some reason, he just wants to go home right now. He wants Tony to wrap him in his arms and the wants to just fall asleep like that.
It takes a few minutes, but eventually Steve manages to get to his feet and stumbles towards the bathroom. He grips the countertop as he looks at his reflection, trying not to stare at the blood trickling down his chest from his nipple. He can already see purple bruising forming around his stomach where Paul’s knee held his weight. He won’t even bring himself to look down at the fist-shaped bruises on his dick. He can’t. He won’t.
He doesn’t say any of these things, though. Instead, he cautiously says, “I’m afraid I’ll be too much for you.”
Steve draws until he hears Tony’s alarm clock go off and then he goes back into the bedroom to make sure the other man actually gets up. Tony has a morning meeting that his CEO said he could not miss, and she’d even tasked Steve with ensuring Tony got there on time. But waking Tony up before he was ready was like waking the dead, and it takes a lot of coaxing to actually make him rise out of the bed.
“Tony,” Steve tries. He’s not trying to get away, but the confusion and uncertainty shows on his face. He doesn’t know what to do. He doesn’t know what Tony is
Hours later, when Steve is cleared to go home, a nurse brings a wheel chair and insists on wheeling him outside. She says it’s hospital policy, but Steve wonders if maybe she just wants to see what kind of car he and Tony Stark are loading up into.
So Steve obliges. He rolls the condom over his length and uses his lube-covered fingers to slick himself up. He shifts so that his painfully hard dick is in line with Ryan’s ass, and then slowly pushes in. He gasps, trying to bring himself back to reality. He knows this isn’t Tony, but from this angle, it could be. Same dark hair, and it doesn’t help that Ryan is chanting Steve’s name, begging him to fuck him harder, deeper.
When Steve wakes up from a dream, Tony’s naked body is still wrapped around him. Tony’s legs are intertwined with his, and his arm is draped around Steve’s chest. It takes a few moments to free himself from the grasp, but eventually Steve stands up and reaches into his dresser drawer for a pair of boxers.
Steve stiffens, but forces himself to relax before it becomes noticeable. “It turned out fine,” he said. “Not as big of a deal as I thought.”
Steve pulls his phone out and dials Tony. He wants to let him know he got home safely, and that he’s about to put the finishing touches on his piece for the art show. Tony answers on the second ring.
His arms are sore from holding the saw up for so long. He puts it down and moves around the slab, carefully looking for anything he might have missed. He runs his hands along the wood, his memory going back to when he did this to Tony, feeling the way his body moved and how his muscles rippled under his touch.
Paul was the end of Steve’s work week because he left so many bruises. He needed a couple days to heal before he could see Ryan. He healed pretty fast so there were never any lingering bruises, but he still needed the two days in between just to recoup himself.
After the gallery fees and subtracting the 90% donation to charity, your portion of the sale came out to $90,823. A check has been enclosed. Thank you for your generous donation for the children’s cancer ward.
Steve bit his lip, because it was completely possible. He hadn’t technically ever agreed to what Paul had done to him, but he’d never said no, either.
It takes him a few minutes to convince himself he’s ready, but finally, he pulls a shirt on and heads for the living room. He can do this. He can put on whatever face Tony needs to see.
“What’s yours?” Steve asks suddenly, because maybe if Tony has some “weird baggage” then he can feel better about things.
The saw isn’t long enough to cut all the way through, so when he’s done sawing through half, he moves to the other side and begins to saw the other side. Finally the block is in two pieces and Steve is covered in sawdust.
Steve doesn’t sleep well that night. Every sound in the night makes him think Paul is trying to break in, or that he missed something and Paul never left, that he’d been hiding and waiting for Steve to fall asleep before attacking. His innermost fears come to the surface while he tries to sleep, and when his alarm goes off he just glares at it.
The shower is too hot, but Steve just takes the brutal heat until his skin turns red and he starts sweating even in the water. He wants to wash Paul off him. He wants to not think about it anymore until next week, when he’ll do this all over again.
Tony stiffens, but he tries to hide it. “You can do whatever you want to Steve,” Tony says back, not meaning for his words to come out so briskly.
Speaking of Tony, Steve realizes that the house is very quiet. He heads into the living room, but he doesn’t see Tony, nor in the kitchen, or anywhere else. A moment of worry washes over him, but he pushes it down. There is no way Paul could have gotten into the tower. It wouldn’t be possible. There are tons of guards outside, and Tony invented his own security system.
Steve finally gets onto the elevator, and just as the doors are sliding shut Tony yells, “Call me when you get home!” Steve just grins all the way down to the lobby.
Steve feels Tony wrap his arms around him, still from behind. He presses backwards into the embrace, but they don’t talk for a long time.
Tony stares at him for a few moments, so long that it makes him uncomfortable and he has to shift on his feet.
Friday is Michelle, and also his only female client. She has extreme social anxiety and was referred to him by his former Sunday client. They didn’t even have sex the first few times he visited her, just talked and got to know one another. For Michelle, it was easy to pretend Steve was her boyfriend who brought her groceries and helped her feel like a social being, even if she really wasn’t. And Steve didn’t mind the sex. He preferred men, but Michelle was so awkward and preferred complete darkness when they were together than he could pretend she was someone else.
He keeps a pace of a few people behind Tony so that he doesn’t arise suspicion. But he’s glad he decided to get closer because Tony Stark is one interesting character. He has a comment about every piece of art he passes, and even asks questions to the artist. The further along in the gallery they get, though, the quicker Steve realizes that eventually they are going to come to his work, and eventually Tony is going to have a comment about it. He is suddenly very nervous.
Tony rocks back and forth a little, testing the waters, before he pulls out and slides back in. They both gasp at the feeling, and when he does it again, Steve throws his head back in extasy.
He lies still for a few more moments, just trying to get the memories to come back to him. How did he get here, what happened? But still nothing comes to mind, and eventually the curiosity gets to him so he squeezes Tony’s hand gently.
Tony jumps, but then he grins. “Forgot you were here,” he says. He gets up and wipes the invisible dirt from his hands onto his pants. “Sorry, I get in the groove sometimes and forget everybody exists.”
“You’re so tight, Steve,” Tony moans, and he adds another finger, stretching and scissoring to loosen him a bit.
He slowly walks up the stairs to the first floor of Stark Tower, feeling completely out of his element. When he gets to the door, it opens automatically and he looks around, expecting to see another worker letting him in, but there is no one. When he steps through the threshold, a voice says, “Welcome to Stark Tower, Mr. Rogers. Please proceed to the elevator and go to the 51
Tony shuffles out of his own clothes, suddenly naked and rubbing himself on Steve’s jean-clad thigh. Tony’s hands move to Steve’s pants, undoing the button and pulling them down Steve’s hips until he’s sitting there in just his boxers, the outline of his erection evident behind the fabric.
Steve approaches him, taking the tape measure long-ways and measuring Tony from head to toe, writing it down before moving on. He measures across Tony’s shoulders, then down his arms, from one leg to one foot, and the other. He measures Tony’s waist, and lastly his chest. The whole thing takes less than five minutes, but it’s making him flush.
Tony follows him into the bathroom where he washes his hand until it is red from the hot water. Then the two of them go to the bed and lay down, Steve in front of Tony, with Tony’s arms wrapped around to hold Steve comfortingly.
Steve watches Tony go, wondering why he’s here by himself, wondering what else Tony is doing. He knows it must be important, because everything Tony does is important, but it still doesn’t change the fact that he really, really wishes Tony would just come in the room, cuddle up with him, tell him everything is going to be okay one more time.
Steve just rolls his eyes and brings his lips to Tony’s. He knows Tony is just joking, but there is also something serious about the way he really doesn’t want to leave. Not just that, but how he really doesn’t want
They lay there together for a while longer, but Steve can feel Tony growing restless. He’s not very good at sitting when there are things to be done. Steve finally just grins and throws his legs over the edge of the bed.
Tony shifts, and some of his weight leans too much against Steve’s stomach, making him gasp in pain and jolt backwards again. And as quickly as the kiss began, it ends. Tony steps back.
But he refuses to think about Tony while he jacks off. He has to let Tony go. He has to get over him. So instead, he thinks about a porno he’d watched a while ago. He thinks about his client Ryan, and he thinks about an actor in a movie he’d seen. And when he comes, he thinks about Tony, how it felt to come with Tony’s hand wrapped around him.
Steve stopped at few pieces of work for a longer than he’d stopped at others. There was one painting of a horse on a rainy night, standing alone apart from a crowd of people. The horse looked a little sad. The painting was titled, simply, “Horse.” The artist was one Steve didn’t know personally, but he’d heard the name. He wasn’t sure why the painting got under his skin. Something about a lonely horse just made him feel funny.
Steve lowers himself into the water and then turns to watch Tony undress. He likes the way Tony’s muscles move under his skin, the way the light trail of hair from his belly button runs south. He likes the way Tony looks naked, and if he weren’t stuck inside his own head, he’d probably he hard right now.
Steve nods, but mostly because he can’t form any words. His head is spinning. He thinks he might be more afraid of explaining the situation with Paul than actually facing Paul again.
Steve stares at the eggs for a long time, not understanding what has just happened. He can hear horns and sirens and people running to ask him if he’s alright, but he can’t tear his eyes away from the eggs. Because they are broken. How is he going to make French toast without eggs?
It takes him a long time, but eventually his breathing his even and his head is clear. He wanders back into the crowd and is surprised to see a large number of people gathered around his work. They’re talking about how Tony Stark wanted to pay a million for it, how Steve could be a big up and coming artist.
He nods in response, sort of wishing he hadn’t asked. It wasn’t easy to forget that Tony could probably buy the entire city of New York and not even flinch when he looked at his bank account.
He dusts himself off, cleaning up the mess as best he can, and then shoots Tony a goodbye message. He’s surprised to see a message in return almost instantly: “Get some sleep. Things to sculpt tomorrow.”
“Lucas made a report about being attacked by Mr. Swanson, and said that we could speak with you about Mr. Swanson’s behavior to corroborate his story.”
Steve squeezes his eyes shut as Tony thrusts into him. When he opens them again, he sees Tony staring down at him, the concentration on his face unable to mask the pure adoration he is feeling. Steve reaches up and cups Tony’s face with his hand, stares into his eyes, and he thinks how wonderful it would be to be loved by this man.
It’s about ten now, which gives him two hours to start on the waist section of the sculpture. He’s confident that he can get at least half of it carved out in that time, if he can just keep his head clear.
“The artist is just having trouble completing the project, sir,” the curator says. “He asked for a few more weeks, and then it’ll be delivered to you.”
Tony Stark and all the guests he will be hosting. Tony has all the money in the world. Why would he pay a random artist to make him a centerpiece for an extravagant party?
“Oh,” Steve says quietly. “I guess I…,” he trails off. He was too excited about working with Tony that he didn’t even think about that stuff? “I’m open to negotiation,” he finally finishes.
“Me and Tony were chatting about you before you came out,” Paul says. “I told him about how you like the things I did to you. How you asked me to do them.”
He feels like he’s running away from his house, where the sanctity of his privacy has been invaded. But he also feels like he’s running towards Tony, because he misses him, and he wants to see him, and Tony is
Steve eventually leaves him alone in the bedroom while he goes to put some of his art supplies in a bag to take back to the tower. He’s flipping through his canvases, the ones with holes and rips, when Tony comes up behind him and hugs his shoulders.
“That’s my good little slut,” Paul says. “You’re so hard for me. You’re going to come so hot and so fast.”
The water sloshes a bit when Tony sits down. Steve’s eyes tear away from the place Tony was just standing to look at his face, surprised when he doesn’t see confusion or disdain, but just pure, gentle eyes looking back at him.
“Thank you,” Steve says graciously. “I should be able to saw out the body shape tonight, and then I’ll head home.”
“Tony’s home,” Steve corrects. “And he said he pretended to be a delivery service. Tony had ordered food.”
see you anymore,” Steve tries again. “You make me feel…safe, and happy, and I can’t…have those things.”
Tony plays along. “Really? Because in my free time I go looking for starving artists to sculpt things for me. Sounds like we were bound to meet at some point.”
The drive home doesn’t take too long, but it’s long enough that the blissful feeling Steve gets while at Tony’s house is gone. The feeling of safety and security is also gone, and as he moves up the stairwell slowly, he is almost afraid to see his apartment again. It’s like this every time he returns home to grab supplies or clothes. He just
On his days off, Steve usually draws quietly at home, or occasionally he’ll visit an art gallery a few blocks over that had once featured his art. It’s a good way to meet new kinds of people who don’t want to sleep with him, and who could help him further his career as a starving artist. He doesn’t have any real hope of that, but sometimes he meets people interested in his particular style. It’s nice to be able to talk to someone and not have to pretend.
Shortly before Tony arrives back home, Steve gets a text message from the curator of the latest art show asking if he’ll be able to make the show or not, because tickets have been reserved for him just in case. Steve declines the offer though, because he doesn’t need to be present at the show. He’s had a dozen successful sales in the last month alone, and people know his name well enough without his face standing there too. And he wants the night off. Just to spend time with Tony with no responsibilities.
“Fine,” he says. “I’ll donate it.” He turns around, like he’s going to leave, but he sighs. He turns back to Tony, looks at him for a second. “I’m sorry,” he says finally. “I didn’t mean to…upset you.”
Arriving home took a few minutes longer than expected because he’d missed his exit while being stuck in his thoughts. But eventually he gets out, grabs his clothes from the back seat, and heads inside. A neighbor sees him and whistles approvingly at his suit, and Steve just smiles and nods politely before unlocking his door and entering his small apartment.
He’s surprised that the bar is much quieter than the gallery. Only a few people are at the counter, and three or four in the booths. His eyes adjust to the darker lighting and he scans, not seeing Tony instantly, and his chest feels a little relief. He’s about to walk back out when someone calls, “Rogers!” from a booth at the back.
Today is pretty much the same. Ryan invites him in, pushes a beer into Steve’s hand, and they talk about Ryan’s secretary at work who keeps screwing everything up. They talk about Ryan’s dad and how he is in the hospital still, but that he’s expected to make a recovery soon. They talk about Ryan getting a dog, even though he’s not home much, but he’s lonely when he is home. They talk about how it’s supposed to rain today. They talk about how that team just scored and they’re definitely going to be in the playoffs.
Steve makes it up to the crotch of the sculpture, his hand holding in between the legs to steady the leg as he carefully whittles a line out, when the elevator dings open and Tony walks through.
“If you must know, I was lonely and a friend told me to come here for reputable, one-time fun,” Tony says. “So now that I’ve explained myself, what are you doing here?”
Steve grins anyway, shaking his head, but he slowly gets out of the car. Even though his head is ready, his body is still protesting. He is having trouble getting his feet to cooperate. Tony must notice, because he comes around and takes Steve’s hand in his.
“I don’t want you to go home by yourself anymore,” Tony says firmly. “I’ll come with you to pick up some clothes or whatever you need, but I want you to stay with me.”
When he arrives at the tower, the guard doesn’t even stop him, just waves him through the gate. A valet is waiting and takes his keys, and Steve assumes he’s cleared to just go to the ballroom again. When he gets up there, he’s surprised to find that someone must have come behind him last night to vacuum up the rest of the sawdust, because the room is pristine. Just waiting to be dirtied again.
It takes hours, and all the trash bags Steve has left in his cabinet, to clean up the apartment. Most of his dishes have been destroyed and anything that looked important was either torn apart or shattered. Steve figures he probably lost everything of value he ever owned, not to mention his artwork that was completely destroyed. He doesn’t throw the art away, though. He stacks it back in the corner and decides that he’ll look at it later when he’s not feeling so nostalgic about it.
Steve nods and heads to the spot they had agreed upon, the tiny space beside the bathroom wall that was just big enough to host his canvas. He was used to hanging his own art, so it didn’t even bother him when none of them workers offered to help. There wasn’t much help he needed anyway. Just stick the canvas on the wall and leave it at that.
Steve sighs, finally finding his pants and sticking his legs into them. Tony just doesn’t understand. He doesn’t get it. They are too different, from two completely different worlds. They could never be together. They could never be happy together.
When Steve makes it to his door, he sighs in relief when he finds it locked, just like he’d left it the last time he was there. He flips on the light switch by the door and then moves cautiously through the house. Just because the door is locked now, doesn’t mean Paul didn’t lock himself inside.
Tony falls forward, his head resting against Steve’s chest. It takes about a minute for his mind to catch up, when he realizes it might be painful for Steve’s fractured rib if he doesn’t move, so he drops to the side, resting his hand on Steve’s chest instead. He thinks that maybe it’ll be enough of a weight to hold Steve in place, to stop him from leaving.
Steve tries to put his mind somewhere else, anywhere else. He’s glad that Paul usually comes pretty quick, but the pain doesn’t end until Steve comes, and that’s the hard part. He has to trick his body into believing that he likes this, that he wants this.
“What are you hungry for?” Steve asks, brushing his hand against Tony’s and smiling when it’s taken.
you, not because of you,” Tony says back. “I told you I wouldn’t let anyone hurt you. I meant that! I wish you’d have came to me with this sooner. We could have gotten it taken care of right away. Is that why you’ve been so distant? You’re worried about this guy coming back?”
“Me, either,” Tony says back. “Well, not anymore. I do bad things when I drink and learn lessons the hard way.”
“Tony you feel so…,” Steve starts, but he’s not sure how to finish that thought. It feels amazing to be inside Tony, and his chest swells with desire and his impending orgasm, but there’s something else. Being with Tony, like this, just feels…
Steve sighs and then manages to sit up without grunting. He stands and starts looking for his clothes. “I don’t want to see you anymore,” he says finally, and the hurt that crosses Tony’s face is unmistakable.
He shook his head to put the thought away. It was bad to dwell on things like that, especially because he knew he’d probably never see Tony Stark in person again. Might glance at him on the TV, but Tony would never call and he would never think about Steve Rogers again. And Steve smiles a bit, because at least he got to meet the guy once.
He was surprised to see that name plate had been set up for him on the wall already. It was cut from steel like other well-known artists and just seeing it made Steve’s chest swell. Maybe people would think his art was worth looking at, especially since the curator had done a great job of helping him blend in with the other artists.
After they chat for a long time, Ryan will offer Steve a drink, which he’ll accept, and then he’ll lead the way into the bedroom. They take each other’s clothes off, and Steve isn’t even shy about kissing Ryan. He lets the other man think this is a relationship, that they are together, even if it’s just for one day. Then they have sex, sometimes a few times, and then Ryan will go find his wallet and hand Steve his pay without breaking eye contact, chatting about the weather or something else nonsensical.
Steve lifts his hands slightly so rest on Tony’s sides, pulling him in for a deep kiss. Their tongues meet in the middle, Tony’s stubble rubbing against Steve’s face. They moan into each other’s embrace, and suddenly Steve doesn’t care if this is a bad idea anymore. He wants to spend this night with Tony. He wants to enjoy his time, because definitely, this will be the
He goes and puts clothes on quickly and then heads outside. The valet must have seen him coming, because he’s got his car ready to go.
to leave. Either he’s actually worried that there are real threats in the world, or he is turning into a homebody. Either way, Steve has to prove that they can go outside together without worrying that danger is lurking around every corner.
Steve lets Tony pull him into a light kiss. It doesn’t deepen, but they stand there like that for another few moments until Tony lets him go and turns back to drying the dishes.
When the officers arrive an hour later, Steve lets them in cautiously. They take his statement, ask him what time he’d left and what time he came back, where was he last night, is anything missing, all the usual questions. They finally ask him if he knows who might have done this, and for some reason, Steve lies and says no. He feels guilty for lying but he figures it’s a way to protect himself. What if they go and find Paul and demand to know why he did this, and he tells them the truth? Steve does not want to get arrested for prostitution. Not when things are looking up.
Disclaimer: I do not know anything about sculpting of any type, or art really...so...sorry to those who might see right through what I have clearly made up as possible.
He shrugs again. “My dad was in the army and died when I was really young. My mom…,” he trails off, sighing. “She had to do certain things to get money so we could live in our tiny apartment in the city. Guess I learned it from somewhere.” He says it almost angrily, but he bites his lip. He’d loved his mother until the day she died. He wishes he had better memories of her, better stories to tell. But the only thing he can remember is his mother telling him to hide in the closet when a client would come by.
The ride to Tony’s place doesn’t take as long as expected. Traffic cooperates, and within twenty minutes Steve is standing at the elevator doors, waiting for it to open and carry him to Tony’s penthouse. He bounces a little on his feet while he waits, not realizing that he’s excited to see Tony until he actually sees the man and feels a gallop in his stomach.
“Yes,” Steve breathes, leaning up again so the wrap can he removed. When it’s gone, Tony reaches up and pinches one of his nipples, then leans down to kiss the middle of his chest. He starts moving down, his hands going to Steve’s belt, unclasps it, and pulls it form the loops.
When he hasn’t responded after several minutes, Tony sends another. “I’m not sorry for kissing you,” it reads, followed by, “But I am sorry if it made you uncomfortable.”
Whenever the image of Tony pops into his head. He refuses to acknowledge the tent that forms in his pants when his thoughts wander to Tony’s hand around him, Tony’s cock inside him.
They’re pulling up to the gallery, waiting in a valet line for someone to come take the keys so they can go inside. Tony takes Steve’s hand again, rubs soothing circles on the back of it.
Tony’s face goes from confused to angry to unreadable in a matter of milliseconds. “You don’t remember the accident?” he asks carefully.
An unexpected amount of blood rushes south and Steve takes a confused look down at his dick, which is twitching with interest. He takes one more look at the message before putting his phone back on the shelf and then wraps a hand around himself.
“No problem, kid,” Phil pauses, and then says, “I haven’t seen you around here lately. You doing something else?”
Just seconds before getting in he remembers that he needs to send Tony a list of supplies he needs, so he goes to find the business card he’d been given and starts to write out a text message. He doesn’t want to sound too formal, but not too causal, either. He reads it a dozen times before pressing send, and then adds a quick, “Thank you” at after that.
“Hell yes,” Tony says, and he flips them again. He spits into his hand and uses it as lubricant. Steve spreads his legs wider to give Tony better access, gasping when the first finger presses in. A few moments later, a second finger joins the first, stretching Steve wider.
Tony lets go of Steve and turns so that he can lean against the counter. Steve starts to cook the sandwiches while Tony watches him.
When he gets there he intends to take a quick shower, but it turns into thirty minutes when thoughts of touching Tony’s body runs through his head and he can’t ignore how painfully hard he is. He figures, what the hell, and lets his mind wander.
Tony nods, and Steve gets in the elevator, trying not to meet Tony’s eyes as the doors slide shut. He lets out a long sigh.
Steve’s brain pauses for a second, because for the second time that day he’s struggling to decide what he and Tony are.
Tony disappears around the corner and Steve is left standing there trying to get the image of a disheveled Tony Stark out of his head.
“Well, either way one or both of you are dying. You can live, Steve. You just have to come with me.”
When the coffee pot beeps, he pours a cup and then heads for the door, grabbing the suit on the hangar on his way and locking up on the other side. He doesn’t have time right now to bring the suit back to Adam, so he’ll have to do it a bit later. Adam won’t mind, he’s sure. And if he does, he’ll just charge a late return fee.
Steve doesn’t want to state the obvious, that Paul hates his wife anyway, so he bites his tongue to prevent it from slipping out. Saying as much is probably a sure way to die faster.
“So how does this work, anyway, Steve?” Tony asks. “A guy just comes in the bar, offers to buy you a drink, and then what?”
The doctor chuckles. “We just need some blood work, maybe a CT scan. Your concussion was pretty rough. You might feel some dizziness over the next few days. Headaches and temporary confusion are also common.”
Tony pulls up the next camera, which watches the black SUV speed off and pull into a parking lot just outside viewing range. He pulls up neighboring cameras, and even hacks into the ATM camera across the street, but there is no way to zoom in on the person who jumps out of the SUV and takes off running on foot.
“Um. I have…,” Steve gulps a little. He’s trying to regain control. He needs to do this, so that the police can investigate and maybe put a stop to Paul hurting other people. So he continues, “I have text messages from him threatening me, and…Tony,” Steve says.
“You alright?” he questions, but Steve averts his eyes and is suddenly frozen in place. Paul is looking right at him too, and his sneer is unmistakable.
There really isn’t a good reason other than Steve doesn’t think he deserves to be taken care of, and especially not by Tony. People like Steve don’t get happy endings, or even happy opportunities.
Steve has to walk away from the hype because it makes him nervous again. He’s going to head for the front door, to his car, and run home, but something pulls his eyes back to the bar Tony said he’d be in. He doubts Tony is even in there anymore. It’s been nearly an hour. And even though his head is screaming at him to not go in there, but feet lead the way instead.
Some of the workers nod to him when he enters the building, but for the most part they ignore him. Because he’s no one; because he’s not worth knowing. Steve doesn’t take it as an insult, though. He doubts anyone will ever remember him for anything other than decent blow jobs and a couple hours of fun.
He slips his finger under the edge of the envelop and slowly opens it. Maybe it’s a list of people who were interested in his work, or maybe it’s a letter telling him to come pick up his work because it’s the only one that didn’t sell. But instead, he’s met with a check and a letter from the gallery.
That morning, Tony had gotten a call just after the sun came up. He’d left the room to take it and Steve couldn’t make out his hushed words, but when Tony returned, he seemed a bit more relaxed. He hadn’t given any explanation, but Steve didn’t really care. Tony was behaving a little more like the old Tony, and that’s all he cared about.
“I came for the art,” Paul says. “I read in the paper that Steve was going to be featured, so I wanted to come by. He hasn’t been home in a while, you see. I was starting to worry.”
He doesn’t drink in his private life, but his clients seem to like it when he drinks with them. He has a high tolerance for alcohol after years of being served drinks upon drinks. A few beers, which taste like dirt to him, won’t affect him in any way. They probably won’t even register on a blood alcohol test if he were given one.
Paul is taken by complete surprise when Steve’s hand wraps around the gun and it is yanked from his hand in less than a second. Steve throws the gun towards Tony and then he tackles Paul, and suddenly every ounce of pain Paul had ever inflicted on him rises to the top. Steve takes Paul to the ground, sits on his chest, and punches him once, twice, three times. He’s just as confused as Paul is. He’s not even sure this is really happening.
Steve doesn’t respond again, and then his phone buzzes and it’s a call from Tony. He declines it instantly. He’s not ready to talk.
Steve tries to get into character. He tries to make it sound plausible when he says, “Oh, yes, Paul. Keep going.”
Tony stares at him for a moment, trying hard to understand, but there is no way to understand this. Steve is hurt, but here is he, trying to do this with Tony.
Steve grunts a little when he cums. Long white lines streak across his belly and he’s glad he did this while still in the bath so he could wash himself clean again.
“Fuck, Paul,” Steve says, and it must urge Paul forward because he grips Steve in a death grip. Paul’s come stripes across Steve’s chest, some making it up to his neck. He tries not to grimace as he thinks about it, but it’s hard not to. Paul doesn’t notice though because he’s focused on getting Steve off. He alternates between squeezing and jerking him hard, so rough that Steve knows the bruises might last longer than usual.
Steve takes a step back, wanting to ask if he could “feel the lines” but not sure how Tony feels about being touched. He decides he can probably sculpt without having to make Tony uncomfortable, but it’s just something he’s always done.
“What do you mean it’s not ready?” the unknown man demands. “I paid for it two months ago! I want my sculpture finished!”
Steve takes his phone as he eases into the water, putting it carefully on the shelf as he dips his body below the surface. His phone buzzes again so he has to wipe his hand on a towel before grabbing it. The message reads, “What time can I expect you?”
Steve gets in and drives off, trying to keep a level head. The drive home seems to take hours. He didn’t really want to leave Tony’s place, so the further he gets from it, the worse his mood becomes. It’s almost frightening the way that just being in Tony’s presence made Steve feel…safe and cared for. Now that he left, the feeling is gone.
Steve runs his fingers up Tony’s spine absentmindedly, trying to keep his thoughts clear but not really able to do so. His eyes move down to Tony’s cheek that is pressed against his bare chest, their legs intertwined. He can’t help but to smile. It feels good being here, just like this. It feels easy.
Steve listens to them chatter about his work for a few more moments until they move on. He stands back a few feet to look at it from their perspective, and he’s glad he drew the happy girl after all. The scene should have been a mother and her daughter having a good day, but in reality, it hadn’t been like that at all. The mother was on her phone, and her daughter was sitting by herself quietly until the mother yelled at her, and then the girl had cried. It had been a sad thing to see.
“Alright, that saves time. I’d need to be finished within a week so the varnish would have time to dry before painting.” He’s mostly thinking out loud, but Tony seems fascinated with his mental calculations. “I can start tomorrow,” he finally says. “If you can get the supplies delivered by tomorrow morning, I can come by and begin working.”
It makes Steve feel a little…worthless, as if all he’s good for is to cause Tony worry and stress. Steve knows it’s not really true, but lately he just feels it. And the more the thinks it, the more he thinks he should just go on his own way and let Tony go back to the life of luxury he had before.
“It doesn’t bother you that I used to…,” Steve trails off, feeling guilty even thinking it. “That I used to sell my body to strangers just to pay my bills?”
Tony briefly stands up and then sits back down again, straddling Steve as he leans in for a deeper kiss. Steve likes how easy this is, just kissing Tony and not having to worry about how much time they have left on the clock, or what client is next, or if he’ll be paid properly. The feeling is so wonderful that he’s already half-hard, willing things to slow down so he can just savor his time with Tony.
Steve finally makes it in to shade Tony’s mustache, then draws his lips so carefully and slowly that he’s pretty sure they’ve been sitting there for years. He traces over the lines, darkening them. He starts on the nose, moving up and up until it’s inevitable, he has to look into Tony’s eyes to be able to draw them.
“Boyfriend does sound so trivial,” Tony nods. “What about manfriends?” Steve rolls his eyes. “But for the sake of society, and if you want to be, then, I’d say we could call ourselves boyfriends.”
The next step is to draw a body shape onto the wood and saw it down to size, but suddenly Steve wished he had in fact drawn Tony’s body. He didn’t get a feel for how thick the man’s shoulders were, or how wide his waist was. He’s just going to have to take a rough guess and cut the body shape bigger, and then carve it down when he gets to it.
floor button is already lit up so he just stands there awkwardly until the doors slide shut and starts to ascend. It seems to move impossibly fast, because a few seconds later, the doors slide open again and the scenery has changed. Instead of the lobby, he’s in what appears to be a house.
“I prefer wood, to be honest,” Steve goes on. “I could carve it, then varnish and paint. Would definitely be ready within two weeks.”
, when he realizes that the door is already slightly ajar. He stares at it for a second, trying to decide if he’s possibly left it open when he’d left angrily yesterday night, but he can’t fathom having done something like that. It’s a bad neighborhood. He knows better.
Tony nods. “Thank god, but yes you’re okay. You’re banged up pretty good. Concussion, bruised sternum, your arm hit the window really hard but it’s not broken. They say you’re going to be okay.”
He takes another calming breath before opening the door and going to find Tony. He finds the other man in the kitchen, fiddling with he coffee maker.
And then there’s the other real threat. When Paul sees photos of them together, he’ll figure out why Steve broke their arrangement. He’ll come after Tony. He’ll do horrible things just to make Steve suffer.
Instead of responding, Steve puts his arm behind his head and sighs. He doesn’t know what to say. He doesn’t know how to tell Tony that none of this is his fault. He knows he can’t say anything to reassure the man that things will be alright, because they won’t be. Nothing will be alright.
“Steve, Steve!” Tony yells, but Steve ignores him, continues to punch until he sees red blood on his knuckles. Not his blood this time. Paul’s blood.
at all. He means person; one person in particular. “It’ll be alright, Steve,” he says gently. “I have an army of guards just waiting for my beckoning call. I’m not going to let anybody hurt you.”
Taking his art to the gallery isn’t too time consuming. It’s as simple as entering the front door and the curator noticing him before she sends a worker over to grab his piece for the show.
“A check from the gallery,” Steve says, his voice rising again. “A check for more money than my whole life is worth. What is this, Tony?”
Steve is about to push Tony up a bit so he can unbutton his pants when Tony’s phone rings. They both curse.
Every once in a while Tony’s hand will run up and down Steve’s forearm, playing with his arm hair or intertwining their fingers briefly before seemingly becoming impatient and starting over again. The nervous hand movements makes Steve look down before he just grins, finally understanding what Tony is saying without words. He turns so he can peck Tony on the lips, but it doesn’t end there. He wraps an arm around Tony’s waist and pulls him closer.
It had been another rough week for Steve. Every week was rough, but lately things with Paul had gotten out of hand. He wasn’t sure he could keep him as a client anymore, especially not since he’d ended up in the hospital on Monday night. He’d managed to crack one of Steve’s ribs in the process of getting off, and it was more painful than anything Steve could imagine. The doctor wrapped his ribcage, but there wasn’t much else he could do besides rest. Which meant he had to cancel with his clients for the week. It was the first time he’d ever broken his availability and even though he knew most of them would be understanding, Paul would not be.
Tony is waiting for him, and when he steps off the elevator he connects their mouths instantly. Steve is a bit surprised, but he just smiles into the kiss. It isn’t very deep, just a “Hello, I missed you,” kiss, but it’s satisfying enough.
He hesitates for just a second, long enough to decide he needs to relieve himself before he gets in the water. When he’s finished, he makes it over to the tub and steps a foot into the bath. The water is hot, but it feels good against his skin. He finally slides into the other side and the water laps at the edges as he settles in.
Tony had shared his camera footage with the police, hoping they could just take it seriously, but they had said there was simply no evidence linking Paul to the accident. But just having Paul in the vicinity of the accident was enough to convince Tony. Actually, he had been convinced before seeing the man’s face on the cameras. He had gotten an alert on his phone about twenty minutes after Steve was admitted to the hospital, and within five minutes he was dressed and running to his car and on his way there. The whole time he was screaming at himself, “Why didn’t I take the threat more seriously?”
“I’m hungry for you,” Tony says back, so casually that it almost goes right over Steve’s head. He doesn’t get a chance to respond, though, because the elevator dings and the doors slide open.
The children from the hospital were laughing and having a good time, which made Steve smile. He followed behind their convoy and watched them point and question certain paintings or pieces of art. Some of the children were carrying IV poles with them, and for some reason, that hurt Steve’s chest a little. The poles didn’t seem to affect the kids at all, though, as if it were just another part of their day. They had accepted that being attached to something else was non-negotiable.
He’s halfway to the grocery store before the events from yesterday even enter his mind, and he’s parked in a parking spot before the fear that he may be being watch creeps up on him. But he keeps his face level and his feet moving because he wants to get some supplies for breakfast so he can surprise Tony, and that suddenly seems more important than worrying about Paul following him. Because Tony’s right. What are the chances that Paul could break through the state-of-the-art security system that has kept so many other stalkers out?
“Alright,” Tony agrees. “What are you in the mood for?” Steve feels like this is a loaded question, so he just grins and waits for Tony to suggest something. He’s not even surprised when Tony adds, “Because I’m in the mood for
“I bought it because I liked it,” Tony says back, shoving his hands in his pockets. “The amount was for children or cancer or something. I didn’t know they’d send you a check.”
As expected, it takes an hour to finish the varnish coat. Steve stands back and takes a final look at the sculpture, taking a moment to snap a photo of it. Somewhat so he can remember his creation, but also because he wants proof that he did this, that he made something beautiful with his own hands.
“I guess I hadn’t really thought about it, either,” Tony admits. “But I’m pretty sure we’re beyond the fuckbuddy stage.”
Steve grins, and he finally pulls out a few items. He’s going to have to one-arm this cooking thing today, and the easiest thing he can think to make is a couple grilled cheese sandwiches. Quick, easy, and only requires one hand for flipping.
He probably stands under the water for an hour, and he’s not even showering. He’s just…standing there. When Tony knocks on the door gently, Steve wipes his face, as if somehow it’ll make it less noticeable that he’d cried until his head hurt.
And Steve had run away. No explanation given, no apologies. He just ran away, leaving Tony to wonder if the kiss had been wrong. The hurt on Tony’s face was enough to make a lump grow in Steve’s throat again. Tony had put himself out there, and Steve had shot him down.
He’s glad that Paul doesn’t actually want to fuck, because he can only imagine what pain would be involved with that. Paul is married, but he doesn’t want to cheat on his wife, and he thinks that a rough hand job in an old motel outside of town isn’t cheating. Steve really doesn’t care what the situation is. Money is money, and money pays the bills.
Steve nods and unwraps his drawings. He sits them side-by-side, first the sad girl and then the happy scene he depicted. He watches the curator’s face, looking for signs of interest or annoyance. To his relief, the man smiles brightly at him.
“He turned this sad day into a happy one,” Tony says finally. “Where’s the artist? I want to ask him something.”
Steve digs in his pocket for his phone and starts typing out a message to Tony, but everything he writes just sounds terrible. He knows he should just call Tony, explain what happened, explain that the kiss was much desired. But he can’t. He doesn’t know where to start.
“I wasn’t going to,” Tony says back. “Somebody else needs to be able to hang an original Steve Rogers in their house, too.”
Steve is in such a good mood, that when he’s at the red light waiting to turn left about a mile from the tower, he doesn’t see the black SUV swerve out of the far right lane and intentionally smash into his car. He doesn’t even realize that something has happened until he sees his car spin into oncoming traffic, until he feels the impact of yet another vehicle hitting him from the side. He doesn’t realize that he’s hurt until he sees blood on the airbag in front of him, and broken eggs in the passenger floorboard of his car.
How did Paul even know where he lived? That was Steve’s first question. The second was, why would Paul do this? And the third, what else might Paul do?
Steve doesn’t know how to respond, so he just stares back, trying to get his thoughts to form into words. Tony doesn’t know that he’s Steve’s first real relationship, or that he’d given up his other life just for a chance to be with Tony. Tony doesn’t know that Steve likes the little things he does, too, like the way he puts off projects until the last minute, or the way he’s supportive in such a nonchalant way. Tony doesn’t know that Steve has been falling for him since they first met, too.
“But you are under the impression that Mr. Swanson caused your car accident? What makes you think that?”
The children trailed through the gallery until coming to the very end: Steve’s drawings by the bathrooms. They looked for a while, seemingly quiet, before one finally piped up, “I like the happy picture better.” The rest of the children agreed instantly.
“You wouldn’t have to do this anymore,” Tony insists. “I can take care of you! You could have an art studio and just…make art all day. You could do whatever you wanted to.”
Steve gulps a little, fear moving into his chest. He’s not afraid of being seen with Tony in public, but he’s afraid of the paparazzi seeing them and making a big deal out of it, and then news will get around to Paul and it could affect Tony in a negative way.
Steve hugs Tony’s arms against his body and he closes his eyes, suddenly too tired to do anything else but fall asleep.
“You drew the picture, I bought the picture, this is your cut,” Tony says, and he sounds frustrated suddenly.
When Steve wakes up, he’s alone again. He’s beginning to expect it, so it doesn’t really phase him anymore.
Eventually, though, he manages to roll to the side and rests his head against Steve’s strong shoulder. They don’t talk for a while; they just lie there together, chests moving up and down.
Tony had made a system of searchable camera compilations looking for Paul’s face. Since he couldn’t see who got out of the SUV, he could at least try to find the man and see if he had been near the accident. So far, he’d caught Paul within a block of the accident. The first, he was running away, and the second, he was walking towards the scene. He stood on the corner while the ambulance loaded a non-responsive Steve into their vehicle.
They stand like that for a long time, and eventually Steve gently moves them backwards to the bed. He sits down, and Tony sits beside him, turning so they can look at each other. Steve brings his hand up to Tony’s chest, lightly rests his hand there, and they lean back together.
He carves carefully with an expert hand, just forming the last few touches to Tony’s go-T, a few more waves for his hair. It takes about an hour, but he finally finishes and stands back. Even the pain in his stomach can’t take away the pride in his chest. This is his best work yet, he’s sure. A perfect rendition of Tony Stark.
Steve doesn’t message back, since he’s driving, but he’s glad he’ll have a couple hours to get started on delicate carving before Tony comes back. He wants to prove that he can sculpt after all, that Tony isn’t wasting his time or money.
The room steadily clears until only the officers are left. They’ve done a good job at leaving Steve alone since their arrival, but now, one of them approaches the heap that is Steve on the floor.
“I wish I could help you, Steve,” the detective says, and he looks sincere. “There is just no evidence.”
“They mostly do,” Tony nods. “I’ve had plenty of stalkers in my time. So many, I had to invent an excellent security system to keep them out.”
Steve rubs his forehead. “I don’t want you to have to protect me. This is my fault. I shouldn’t be your problem.”
It doesn’t last long. Steve comes first, his orgasm hitting him hard and Tony thrusting in tune with the waves. His come shoots out in long streaks across his and Tony’s chests, and only a few seconds later Tony is moaning and he comes so hard that for a few minutes after he rides out his orgasm, he doesn’t pull out of Steve.
Tony’s eyes flutter open and he looks around like he’s confused, too, and then he realizes that Steve is awake and his eyes go wide.
He goes back to his canvas and turns it around to face the wall. He doesn’t want to look at it, especially not right now.
Tony looks up once more before lower his mouth down. He circles Steve’s cock with his tongue, licking once before slipping the head past his lips. Steve stiffens, and then he groans. He uses his hand to run through Tony’s hair, gently guiding himself deeper as Tony sucks him off.
“No,” Tony agrees, “but neither should you. You haven’t done anything wrong. Sometimes people in this world are just messed up in the head, and we’re the unlucky ones who find them.”
After finishing his coffee, Steve checked his phone for the time and then went to find clean socks. He had a couple hours before he needed to be at the show, which gave him plenty of time to rent a suit and then arrive in time to set up his pieces in the back.
“The detective is going to come to the tower,” Tony says, taking Steve’s hand reassuringly. “He wants to talk about Paul, and why he may be involved in the accident.”
“We’ve had a rough couple weeks,” Tony murmurs, taking Steve’s foot from his side of the tub and bringing it towards himself. He massages the sole, runs his hands up the ankle, but stops just below the knee.
“You’re telling me there’s a check for almost a hundred grand just floating around somewhere out there, and you’re nonchalant about it?”
Steve’s hand slides under Tony’s shirt, touching his bare skin lightly. Tony makes a sound into his mouth before pulling away briefly to remove his jacket and then he pulls his shirt up over his head. Steve leans in, sucks a trail down Tony’s neck, stops just above what must be the scar he felt the first time he touched Tony.
Steve sighs, and for once, he forces his mind to go blank. He doesn’t want to overthink things. He just wants to stay right here, pressed against Tony, forever.
Steve debates for a moment, because as much as he’d just love to give in to Tony and relax under his touch, he also needs to get this thing with the police over with. He wants to be able to give his undivided attention to Tony, and right now, it’s split between how good Tony’s hands feel under his shirt and the uneasy feeling in his chest he’s had since shortly after waking up.
Steve doesn’t even get out of bed on Tuesday. He’d managed to sleep most of the day, and when night comes around he just plays with his phone. He hasn’t gotten any other messages from Tony, which is a relief and a worry at the same time. He wants to know what Tony is up to, but he restrains himself. He can’t give the man false hope. He needs to just fade into the background and pretend the week they got to know each other never happened.
Tony looks around the room, making sure they aren’t being watched, before he takes a purposeful step forward.
He takes a step back, wiping sawdust from his face and clothes, before grabbing the tape measure and heading to the elevator. Tony said he was in the lab on the basement level, so that’s where Steve is going to go. The elevator dings when it reaches his floor and Steve steps on, cautiously pressing the button for the basement and then stepping back to lean against the wall as the lift descends.
They hang up and Steve takes a deep breath, letting it out slowly. He tries to get a hold of himself, to wipe the fear from his face. He doesn’t want Tony to worry to much, and he doesn’t want to have to explain himself. Not now. Not yet. He doesn’t know how to explain it, anyway.
They finally step out of the car, a crowd of cameras suddenly snapping their pictures and the annoying “click, click, click” fills Steve’s ears. He pushes down his worry and waits for Tony to come join him on the other side of the car before they head into the gallery. He can already see the speculation in the crowd, but again he pushes his doubt and fears aside as Tony greets people.
Steve groans when Tony’s hand wraps around him, and he says wantonly, “I’ll be yours, Tony, if you’ll be mine, too.”
Steve grabs a bottle of water from the fridge and then heads down to the lab. He knows Tony has probably been in there all night, probably just minutes after Steve had fallen asleep. He is probably welding something, or building something, or drawing schematics for some new technology the world needs. Just anything to get his mind off Steve and his situation.
“My event is in two weeks!” the man responds. “If it hasn’t arrived by then, what am I supposed to do?”
“Fuck me, Steve,” Ryan says, and he slides back onto the bed. He reaches into his drawer and pulls out a condom and lube. “I can’t wait, fuck me. Please,” he begs.
Steve stiffens for a millisecond, but he relaxes back into Tony’s embrace. “I’m sorry, Tony,” he says finally. “I shouldn’t act like this. I should…,” he trails off. “Are
Steve hurries through the store. He buys a loaf of bread, eggs, milk, butter, and syrup. He’s going to make a pretty simple breakfast of French toast, but Tony has a secret sweet tooth so he’s pretty sure it’ll be appreciated.
“Well,” Steve says slowly. “I came home and my apartment was trashed. It was Paul. What should I do?”
“Looking good,” the doctor says. “I want to run a few more tests, but you’ll be able to go home later tonight, if you want to.”
Tony nods and offers to leave the room, closing the door behind himself. Tony doesn’t want to pry, but Steve’s sudden attitude change worries him.
When Steve starts to move, Tony’s chest squeezes tightly, waiting for Steve to say, “I have to go.” But instead of getting up, Steve drapes his arm around Tony and they lie there like that, pressed together, covered in come and sweat.
Every once in a while, Steve will mention a direction to go, but for the most part they stay quiet for the whole ride into Brooklyn. When they finally pull into Steve’s neighborhood, Tony’s flashy car stands out like a sore thumb.
Steve grins back, realizing this is the first time in a while that Tony has shown any real interest in being intimate. He’s gotten a couple blow jobs over the last week, but Tony didn’t want reciprocation. He just kept saying, “A blow job a day keeps the doctor away.” But now he’s letting Steve touch him back, and Steve thinks that maybe, maybe everything is going to be alright after all.
It’s three days later when Steve decides he can venture outside. He doesn’t really have anywhere to go but he’s tired of being cooped up inside.
He starts stripping out of the suit, not stopping until he’s naked. He hangs the suit carefully on a hanger and puts it by the front door to return to Adam tomorrow morning. He then heads towards the bathroom and runs a bath.
“I’m f-fine,” Steve insists, holding up a hand when Tony tries to come near him again. “I’m going to…go,” he says. “I’ll be back on Wednesday to finish the varnish.”
Tony nods, but he still doesn’t seem to want to give up any information. Not yet. He wants Steve to get better first, and then they can talk about what really happened in the accident, about who is
Blakely nods, but he pauses. “There will be trial, of course. You may be called as a witness, but it’s just a formality.”
Steve follows, trying hard not to check out Tony’s ass but it’s nearly impossible for him to avoid doing. He really hopes there aren’t cameras in there to catch him in the act.
Paul turns and walks out of the crowd that has suddenly formed around Tony and Steve, and Steve feels like the world might actually explode right now. He can’t breathe, he’s having trouble keeping himself standing up. He thinks he might be having a panic attack.
Tony hesitates, but finally he nods. He stands a few inches from Steve, ready to catch him if he starts to wobble, but Steve feels stronger with each step he takes. He still has pain shooting down his body from his back, but it’s not so bad when he stands. This isn’t even the worst pain he’s ever been though. There was the time he fell off the monkey bars at school and broke his leg. That was painful. This is just an inconvenience.
“The amount doesn’t reflect the work,” Tony begins, but then he stops. “Not that it’s not worth a million, because to me, it was. But the amount reflects my donation to charity. And I already told you I didn’t know they gave the artist a cut.”
Tony holds Steve, too. He wraps his arms around him, and even though it’s hard because Steve is a lot taller than him, he manages to keep them both on their feet. Steve’s hands are clutched tightly at Tony’s side, holding onto his jacket. His face is buried in Tony’s neck, trying to keep tears from streaming down his face but it’s nearly impossible.
“So you spend a million dollars on a drawing that means nothing to you?” Steve yells. “You just waste your money like it’s nothing?”
Steve smiles back, but the realization that Tony wants to be with him, despite what he was doing before they met, makes his forehead crease.
Sighing gently, Steve reaches up with his free arm and traces Tony’s jaw lightly. He’s surprised when Tony’s eyes flutter open and, tiredly, looks back at Steve.
And then his phone buzzes and his greatest fear comes true. It’s a message from Tony. Simple, quick, it says, “You okay?”
By the time Steve is done analyzing at his own work, he realizes that there are more people entering the gallery. It’s a few minutes before dark and the buzz of conversation has increased. He walks back to the front and sees that many of the artists have arrived and they are chatting with patrons about their pieces, or laughing with other local artists just to pass the time.
floor. Thanks,” he says into the receiver, and then he groans when he ends the call. “Worst timing ever,” Tony complains.
Steve takes a deep breath before getting out of his car and going up the steps to the second floor. He finds the room and knocks on the door. It’s opened immediately as if Paul has been waiting
“Unless you think the naked sculpture is a better idea,” Tony says, and Steve’s eyes widen. What he wouldn’t give to draw Tony Stark naked and then carve his body into the wood, immortalizing him forever.
“How’re you feeling?” Tony asks, brushing his hands off on his pants and coming a few steps forward to peck Steve on the lips.
“Do you think it was excessive use of force, considering you had already taken the gun away from him?”
When Steve finally gets into his car, he grimaces and holds back tears. They’re not from pain, or they might be, but more from disappointment. Why does he let Paul do this to him every week? Why doesn’t he put a stop to it?
“I’m going to come,” Tony says, breaking Steve’s train of thought. Tony’s body tenses up, his eyes shut tight, and he comes in long, hot spurts over Steve’s hand and onto his own chest. It only takes a few more pumps from Steve before he’s coming too, shuddering at the feeling, and grunting as he rides out his orgasm.
“And you, Tony. You have the most prestigious security in the whole country, and yet I was able to get in so easily. All I had to do was bring a couple bags of take out and the guard let me right through. You were so predictable. Can’t cook for yourselves because you’re so worthless. I just had to wait for the perfect time.”
Steve thinks about it, thinks about how it might be a good idea to not sleep at his own house, alone, waiting for a vengeful Paul to show up, but he declines Phil’s offer. “No, thanks,” he says. “I’ll be alright.”
Tony stiffens again, but he relaxes faster than before. “My mom was kind. She tried to protect me from my father,” Tony says. “But he wanted a protégé, and that meant drilling into my head algorithms and advanced trigonometry at a very young age. I guess I’m grateful for it now that I’m an adult, but I do wish I’d been able to do more kid stuff. You know, little league, trips to the zoo.”
Steve grins, and he teases Tony for a moment before gently pushing his first finger past Tony’s clenched ring. Tony gasps again, but he rocks back and forth, trying to get more contact and to get Steve deeper.
“It will be if you kill Tony,” Steve says. “So far you haven’t hurt anybody, right? We can just pretend this never happened. You can go home.”
“What is it?” Tony asks, sensing that whatever Steve has to say is important. He turns off the sink water and turns back to Steve, waiting for an answer.
“Let’s get inside,” Tony suggests. “Have a bath. Have some dinner. It’ll help your head settle down.”
It takes him another few minutes, but eventually he dials the police and they say they’re going to send somebody out. Steve knows his neighborhood isn’t exactly at the top of their priority list, so he wanders around his house for a bit. He eventually decides to scrub the red SLUT off his mirror because he doesn’t want to have to explain it to the police.
Steve nods again, sucking in a breath and trying to hide the redness that is creeping into his cheeks. Tony lets go of his hand briefly to walk the detective over to the elevator, and then accepts the business cards offered. When Tony comes back, he wraps his arms around Steve tightly.
A few days go by and Steve uses the time to rest. He doesn’t allow himself to think of Tony, but instead just sits in front of a blank canvas with his hand pressed down but nothing appears no matter how much he tries. He becomes annoyed with himself and paces around the room, trying to find an imagine in his head that isn’t Tony Stark’s face.
Steve starts to move slowly towards Paul. The gun rises to point at him, but he feels confident that he won’t actually get shot. He moves until he’s just a few feet away, reaching out his hand.
floor, still in silence. Steve wishes Tony would talk, just to break up the silence or yell at him, or just…
He manages to get in the shower, trying to just relax his body against the spray. He stays for fifteen minutes before he gets out, drying himself quickly and then going to find his clothes. He slowly maneuvers his legs into his pants, grimaces when he lifts his arms to put his shirt on, and then very slowly ties his shoes.
“You aren’t a problem, Steve. Everybody’s got some weird baggage, and yours just happens to be a scary guy who is stalking you.”
He takes hold of Ryan’s hips, increases his pace. Ryan begs him to go faster, so he does. He leans forward again, grabs Ryan’s dick and pumps it in rhythm with his thrusts. It doesn’t take long, maybe a few minutes, for Ryan to come in long, white streaks across his own chest. He clenches around Steve, and it sends him overboard. In his head he keeps saying, “
Tony can tell that Steve is in shock, and he probably does need medical attention. But he’s also pretty sure that when things have been quiet for a few minutes, Steve might just snap out of it. So they sit there together for quiet some time, maybe longer than Tony thought it would take, but eventually Steve reaches up with his hand and wipes his face as if expecting to clear away tears.
They’ve probably been in the bathroom for a full twenty minutes by the time Steve decides he looks presentable enough to go back into the gallery. They’ve been in there so long that anyone who might have been waiting for them to come out has already been forced to move on.
“Alright,” Steve agrees. “I’ll see you later tonight. I need to clean up at home. Need me to bring anything over?”
Eventually they pull up at the tower and Tony drives into the garage. The guards wait until the garage door shuts behind them and then they begin to secure the perimeter.
Steve shifts them so that he’s on top, and Tony looks up at him. Steve just smiles again and moves his hands down Tony’s body, stopping to squeeze his thigh lightly before wrapping a light hand around Tony’s cock. Tony moans loudly, jolting his hips forward for more contact. Steve pumps him a few times, using his thumb to wipe away the precum that is leaking from Tony’s tip. He brings his thumb to his mouth and sucks, all the while Tony writhing under him.
By noon, Steve was standing in front of Ryan’s penthouse door, hands shoved his pockets, waiting to be let in. When the door finally swings open, Ryan is there with a big, bright smile and welcomes him in like they’re best friends. And maybe they could have been, if they didn’t fuck each other.
Tony glares, but it’s just a playful one. He clenches again when Steve adds a second finger but manages to relax in record time, rocking again until Steve sighs and pulls his fingers out. He wipes his hand on a shirt from the floor and then goes for the condom.
When Steve doesn’t respond, Tony moves his hand again. This time he uses it to cup Steve’s face. Their eyes connect, and Steve’s heart is beating so fast he’s afraid it’s going to beat right out of his chest.
“I’ll come see you tomorrow,” Steve promises, stepping up behind Tony and pressing a gentle kiss to the back of his neck.
The drive home takes about twenty minutes, but when he finally pulls up and heads inside, kicking off his shoes at the door, he goes straight bed. He’s not tired, but his body is exhausted. Every Monday is just like this. He meets Paul and then his entire being is emotionally and physically drained, but his brain is wide awake.
Even the concussion is mostly gone, though, sometimes Steve still hears ringing in his ears or feels dizzy when he’s walking. All in all, Steve thinks one more day of resting will be plenty. He probably wouldn’t have rested this long anyway, but Tony insisted.
They both gasp at the feeling, Steve trying to still himself to allow Tony time to adjust and Tony just pulling Steve deeper and deeper.
Tony moves over so he can sit behind Steve and slowly works his hands over the shoulder muscle. He massages it until it relaxes under his touch and Steve pushes back against his hands.
“If you even think that you’re on the same level as Paul, then yes, you’re messed up,” Tony says, his words coming out more harsh than he’d intended. He sighs and takes a breath. “That’s not what I mean. I just…want you to know how much I care about you.”
Steve sighs, and then he smiles a bit. “Uh, yeah actually. I’ve started…seeing someone. I dropped all my clients to give this thing a shot.”
Steve bites his lip, but he smiles when he sees Tony glance down at it, and feels him becoming hard just from the sight of something so simple.
It seems to take hours, but finally they meander their way to the very last row of works and Steve feels like he’s going to be sick. Tony stops and stares at a few pieces, but he goes on until he’s reached Steve’s. He stares at it for a long time, just like the children did. He reaches out and touches the name plate with his fingers, and Steve can’t tell but it looks like he recognizes the name from when they met earlier.
He can hear Tony grin again when they hang up, and Steve just smiles as he drives towards Stark Tower. Things have been different for him over the last few weeks. Sure, he’s spent a significant time worrying about Paul and whether or not the man is gone for good or if he’s just waiting for the best time to strike, but he’s also spent a lot of time with Tony. He feels so…normal. So…domestic. He likes it.
Steve tries to twist a little so he can get a better look at Tony, but pain shoots though his back and he groans instead.
He goes back into the room and watches Tony sleep for several minutes. He knows he should find his clothes, put them back on, and leave. But he doesn’t want to. He wants to stay here and wrap himself back up with Tony. He wants them to wake up together.
Steve’s friend wasn’t at the bar yet, though, so Steve sat at the counter, shoulders hunched, drinking a cranberry juice. He was approached by several men offering to buy him drinks, but he turned each of them away politely. He wasn’t intending to pick up another client, he just needed to figure out a good way to drop Paul, and maybe earn himself a third day off. He could make his finances work with one less client, and it might be good for his mental health anyway.
He doesn’t get an immediate answer, so he takes a few steps around the room. It’s extravagantly decorated, so lavish that it makes Steve very uncomfortable. He’s suddenly doubting his skills as an artist capable of producing a sculpture that Tony will appreciate. It’s probably just his own self-doubts coming through, because he knows he does good work, but compared to the millions that must have been spent just furnishing this place, he doesn’t know if his sculpture will fit the décor.
“If it’s too weird for you, I don’t have to,” Steve says quickly. “I can probably do it without a physical measurement.”
Tony nods, stands up, and takes Steve by the hand. He leads him through the house until they reach the bedroom door. Tony kicks it open, pulls Steve in, and then pushes him backwards onto the bed. He climbs on top of Steve again, pressing their bodies together tightly. His hands run up Steve’s sides and then back down, stopping at the hem of Steve’s shirt and he pushes it up. Steve leans up so it can be lifted over his head.
“I don’t know. But it would have been choice, you know? This life was sort of cut out for me and I never had any other option. Maybe I’d have been a garbage man. Maybe I’d have been the president.”
Tony waves him off. “Me bringing a hot date to dinner is hardly the most scandalous thing I’ve done,” he says brazenly.
“As much as I would love to get this train started again,” Tony warns, “we do have a show to get to.”
Maybe it’s intuition, but Tony’s eyes flutter open and he looks around the room, confused for a moment.
The feeling of being trapped momentarily washes over Steve, but he takes a breath and relaxes. If he has to be trapped with someone, why can’t it be Tony?
“Has he threatened you since breaking into your apartment?” Tony asks. “Have you seen him around anywhere?”
He stares at it for a long time, trying to decipher the words. He’s not sure if Tony is planning to feed him, or if he wants to know what does the average American eat for breakfast. He stares at the words until they go blurry and then realizes that he’s hesitated too long.
“This one’s just for you,” Tony says, putting a hand on Steve’s chest and pushing him back down. He then cuddles back up, letting Steve’s arm wrap around him.
Steve sighs in relief. He’s not quite sure why he was so afraid of having Tony involved, but now that it’s out in the open he feels like one of the weights on his chest has lifted.
Steve takes a sip of his cranberry juice. “Not sure this is a bar you want to be in,” Steve finally says.
“Why not? The media’s going to figure out that having dinner with the same hot guy repeatedly probably means exactly what they want it to mean.”
He puts the knife down and grabs a brush and the container of varnish. He’s about half-way up the legs when his phone dings, but he ignores it so he can work faster. He uses long, precise strokes so that there isn’t any variation in the color. He’s working on Tony’s face, using a dab brush to get into the small crevices, when a particularly rough cramp rolls though his stomach and he drops the brush. It clatters to the floor just as the elevator dings open and Tony walks off.
He feels Tony stiffen a bit behind him, and he’s pretty sure it’s the first personal thing he’s ever revealed about himself. He’s not even sure why he mentioned it. It would have been so easy to just lie and say he’d learned to cook as an adult. It would have been so easy to omit his terrible childhood. But, for some reason, he felt like telling the truth. He wants Tony to know everything about him.
Steve smiles, and then gets on the elevator. Once again, his car is waiting outside for him and he drives off, looking briefly in the rearview mirror at the tower before it disappears from sight.
Steve knows that he’s been staying at Tony’s partly because he’s a little afraid to go home. He thinks that Paul might be watching him, waiting for him to come home alone after dark. But he hasn’t heard a peep since that night, so he also hopes that maybe the man has moved on; maybe he’s decided that Steve isn’t worth his trouble anymore.
Steve dusts off his hair and clothes again, taking a few minutes to sweep up as much of the saw dust on the floor as he can before he decides to call it a day. He gets on the elevator and heads down to the first floor, grabbing his phone quickly to shoot Tony a text. “Finished for the night. See you tomorrow,” he sends, and then he steps outside.
He’s completely surprised that it was even possible. Sex has lost all meaning for him and is not usually a pleasurable experience. But it was the first time in a long time he’d cum just because he felt horny. No one was paying him. He did it because he wanted to. It’s actually a…good feeling. A normal thing to do.
In the bathroom, though, his worst fear comes true when he pushes the mirror closed on the medicine cabinet and sees the word “SLUT” written in dark red letters. He suddenly knows who did this, who is responsible for destroying everything he has, and fear runs through him.
Steve does. They hadn’t really talked about it, and Tony didn’t really know how to approach the subject anyway. He just watches as Steve scrolls through his messages, his eyes becoming more and more unreadable as the seconds tick by.
Steve backs up a pace and he finds his hand on the door handle. His heart is begging him to stay, to kiss Tony, to never let him go. But his mind is telling him to run away, that he can’t recover from the inevitable hurt that will follow if he stays.
Tony stands up, seemingly unable to handle the emotion in the bathtub anymore. He yanks Steve up by the hand and they head for the bedroom, not bothering to dry off by the time Tony has Steve on his back on the bed.
Usually Steve would be into this. He enjoyed his time with Ryan because the man wasn’t completely selfish. They were able to have a normal sex relationship, minus the payment part at the end. But for some reason, right now, Steve is having to tap into his reserves to get the blood flowing to the right area. He’s having to concentrate, having to force himself to get hard. Maybe he over spent himself by masturbating twice in two days, his
Instead of yelling at him, or kicking him out, or admonishing him in anyway as Steve was expecting, Tony just wraps him into a tight hug. The embrace seems to last forever. So long that Steve is the one to pull away.
It feels strange, because he hasn’t taken an actual bath in so long. It’s usually five minute showers or the burning hot ones after meeting with Paul on Mondays. But today he wants to take a long, warm bath and think about what happened at the gallery, with
“We can be on the West Coast in five hours if we leave now,” Tony goes on. “There’s this excellent little diner that serves a great brunch. And after we could go to the beach, and—”
What he doesn’t like is that today is Monday, or Paul Day, as he calls it. He almost hopes that Paul will cancel last minute, that something will come up. But right on time, at 3pm, Paul texts him a location to meet and Steve sighs before he puts his shoes on and leaves the house.
Steve agrees, and then they hang up. His fingers hover over the numbers on his screen for a moment before he decides to call Tony instead. He just wants to hear Tony’s voice, to make sure he’s okay.
They banter for a while, but eventually Adam settles on a moderately priced suit. Not too shabby, but any rich guy would know Steve wasn’t trying too hard. Adam makes Steve put it on and tailors it, putting in temporary pins that would last the night but were removeable upon return.
“Okay,” Steve says again, waiting for the kicker. There has to be something to this project that he’s not understanding. It sounds like a pretty typical sculpture to him, pretty easy too. Might take the rest of the week to finish, but he’s confident he can do it.
Eventually, his hand starts to move across the canvas. His brain isn’t calling the shots, though, and instead the blood rushing south forces his hand to draw things. He draws Tony, naked, splayed out on the bed, just the way he was. He draws the other man’s cock, draws the muscles up his chest, draws the long scar over Tony’s heart.
It takes a couple hours, but eventually he’s finished laying out the bottom half of the sculpture. The lines are refined and it looks good, even though the top half is still mostly a shapeless body.
“So, look,” Tony begins, “I know this all started out a little non-traditional, and that’s totally my style. But if you want to, I’d love to take you to dinner. Wine and dine, that sort of thing.”
Steve nods and then heads inside. He’s not sure if Tony is avoiding him, or if he’s actually got things to do. He’s a busy man, after all. It’s likely that Tony is in a meeting, or hosting another event, or donating a million dollars to another hospital. It’s equally as likely that Tony is avoiding him, though. For good reason, Steve admits.
His head goes back to Stark Tower, about Tony being so close, about the way their tongues melded together, fighting for space.
Steve can’t help but to laugh back, and his chest feels a little less heavy. He presses his forehead against Tony’s for a second, sighing, breathing in his breath, and then kisses him gently.
Steve doesn’t really know, or understand, what Tony is working on. Something technological and smart and needs big words to describe. He’s always so impressed when Tony goes off on a tangent about how his
His eyes scan around the room and land on an elevator straight ahead. He really hopes no one is watching him being so indecisive because it looks pathetic, but he’s very nervous. He doesn’t feel like he belongs in this place. It’s too nice.
It was an excuse, but it wasn’t a lie, either. Steve has been invited to another art show, and he had a piece he’d been working on for a while that he wanted to display. He needed the night to finish it. He needed the silence of his own house with no distractions so he could get the thing done and prepared for the show.
When he gets down to Tony’s lab, he smiles when he hears music playing. He sees Tony bent over a table using an etching tool to put tiny details into a sheet of metal. Steve still has no idea what it is Tony is building, but he is fascinated by the artistic movements the man makes as he moves over the metal.
“We’ve got time,” Steve smiles, and he starts to help Tony unbutton his jeans, works them down his hips.
“God your mouth feels so good,” Tony gasps, his hands coming to rest in Steve’s hair. He gently guides him where he wants to go. Steve just cooperates. He licks Tony’s slit and lets his tongue run over the underside of Tony’s cock. He takes him deep, swallows around him, all the while taking glances up to see Tony’s reactions.
He goes straight into the ballroom and grabs his whittling knife, testing it in his hand a few times before he approaches the sculpture. He doesn’t like the way Tony’s wooden eyes stare at him, his disapproving scowl staring down.
“Then donate the rest of it to charity! Or rip up the check. Do whatever you want to with it. What do you want me to do?”
Steve stares for a long time before he dials his contact at the bar. He knows it’s early, that there’s probably no one there right now, but he’s relieved when it’s answered on the fourth ring.
“Long night,” Tony says, as if that will somehow explain his previous appearance. “The supplies were delivered an hour ago in the ballroom,” he goes on. “I’ll show you to them.”
When the pizza is gone, and Steve’s stomach juts out from being so full, he yawns again and then stands up. “I better get back to work,” he says. “Work in the morning and all.”
The iron gate opens and Steve pulls inside, feeling trapped suddenly when the gate closes behind him. He drives up to the stairs that lead inside the building and gets out slowly, surprised when a man greets him.
Tony nods. “I think that’s a good idea.” Tony pauses, and then he takes Steve’s wrist in his hand. “But first you need to wash this off.” He nods to the blood that is still staining Steve’s fingers, and Steve stares at it for a few seconds before he nods.
Steve runs a hand across his face, trying to form words because he knows he needs to say something. Otherwise Tony might begin to worry, and he doesn’t want to be the cause of any more stress in Tony’s life.
“Come on,” Steve says, more out of desperation to get his guy off him, to let this be over. It comes out in his sexy, musky voice, though, and the guy takes it as the tipping point. He comes hard, painting Steve’s stomach with cum. The guy squeezes even harder on Steve’s dick, so painfully now that he knows he’s going to have bruises for a few days. He doesn’t want to come, he really doesn’t. But the guy isn’t going to leave until he does.
He keeps grinning even when he knows Tony can’t see him anymore and he goes back to drawing. He spends another hour just doodling before he gets up and checks the refrigerator for ingredients for lunch.
“I know that you’re an amazing man, and an amazing artist, and if somebody had just told you that a long time ago, maybe you’d believe it too.”
He’s just about to get out when he gets another message, and he looks at it as soon as he can dry his hand on a towel. “Good night. Get good sleep. Need my artist to be in tip top shape.”
Steve is confused for a moment, but when the elevator opens and Tony leads him into what appears to be a ballroom, he becomes increasingly nervous. He is an artist, and he is confident in his work, but he’s suddenly doubting his ability to
Steve instead leans in and kisses Tony awake, but when he feels Tony start to deepen the kiss he pulls back.
Steve nods, and Tony watches him slide out of the sling. Steve grimaces when he brings his arm out in front of him, stretching it for the first time.
“Let’s talk about what happened first,” Blakely says. “Don’t worry, I just have a few questions about it.”
“Nah,” Tony says back, waving his hand. “I tried to sleep with my CEO for a while, but that didn’t work. Then I managed to accidentally sleep with our valet and got myself into a law suit, so I’m trying to keep a low profile.”
Tony stays asleep, so Steve wanders through the house into the kitchen. He opens the fridge a few times, expecting to see something new, but Tony doesn’t really have much food. He has sandwich supplies, and leftover pizza, and beer, but nothing for breakfast.
Tony isn’t tired, so it takes him a while to fall asleep too. His mind is racing, and he wants to know where they’re taking Paul, what they’re going to charge him with, what security changes can he implement to prevent something like this from happening again. But eventually, he succumbs to the nap as well.
He heads out to his car, holding his stomach carefully as if it’s going to explode somehow. It certainly feels like it. He wonders if something might be broken.
The detective writes a few things down before looking up again. “Mr. Rogers, has Mr. Swanson ever injured you to the point of hospitalization?”
He carefully packed the two drawings in brown paper and taped the ends. He then headed out to his car and put the package in the trunk and patted his pockets for his keys. Eventually he finds them and heads towards the suit rental place.
“Well, give me the tour, then,” Tony says, changing the subject. He wants to keep this adventure light and happy.
“I’m going to keep you safe,” Tony says instead. “I’ve got guards at all the entrances to this hospital ward, and at home I’ve got patrols at every entrance. He isn’t going to be able to get to you.”
Steve’s eyes are a little wide. He wasn’t aware that Lucas had picked up Paul as a client. He suddenly feels guilty. More guilty than he’s ever felt before, because if he’d just said something, maybe Lucas wouldn’t have…
When Steve’s arm falls asleep, be begrudgingly slides himself out from under Tony and heads for the bathroom. They must have fallen asleep, because suddenly their two hours until the show has turned into about twenty minutes, but Steve doesn’t rush. He doesn’t even wake Tony up at first. He just comes back and watches the man sleep for several minutes, loving the way his chest rises and falls in such an even succession.
“I’d like to see that.” When Steve’s eyebrows raise, Tony adds, “Not that I condone violence, but sometimes, some people deserve what’s coming.”
It probably takes ten minutes, but eventually Steve pushes himself back from Tony and wipes his face on the sleeve of his suit. Tony raises his thumbs to wipe away anything else that lingers, and the two of them look at each other for a moment.
“Can I buy you a drink?” the voice asked, and Steve’s eyes went wide. He turned just enough to see Tony Stark there, sitting down, taking the seat even though it wasn’t offered.
Steve puts the suit back on the hanger it came from and then stretches out on the bed. He’s exhausted from the mental stress of the day, and when Tony comes to lay down beside him, just pressing their bodies together, Steve sighs contently.
Tony takes Steve’s tip into his mouth, licking his way down the length before unexpectedly swallowing him down.
“How are you feeling, Steve?” the officer asks, crouching down so he can get a better look. “This must have been very frightening for you both.”
With all Steve’s clothes packed up, he sits his bag by the elevator and turns to say his final goodbyes to Tony. He is surprised when Tony sort of tackles him, pressing him against the wall, and licks his way into Steve’s mouth. Tony presses their bodies flush together, pulling only away when Steve moans into the kiss.
“Don’t leave me,” Steve says. He means more of a short term thing, such as, don’t leave me if I fall asleep, but Tony nods anyway.
Tony signs again, turning to lie on his back. “I want…,” he starts, and then trails off. “I want to take care of you, Steve,” Tony begs. “I want you to come and…
Tony rolls his eyes. “After 90 days, they’ll void the check for not cashing it and then send another one. So you have about 90 days to figure out what you’re going to do with it.”
When he’s actually standing on his feet, the pain seems a to lessen a bit. He staggers as he tries to take a step, and he doesn’t miss the way Tony’s hands reach out to steady him, but at the very last moment Tony pulls back. He wants Steve to know he can do this on his own.
Tony pumps himself a few times before lining himself up, pressing in. Steve groans at the feeling, he tries to bite back the long sigh that escapes his throat.
When he finally heads for the bed, his legs feel weak and his arms are sore from working earlier, but he feels blissful. He sets his alarm for eleven and then closes his eyes, falling asleep to more thoughts of Tony Stark.
By the time he gets back to the sculpture, he’s blocked his mind. He won’t think about Tony until he’s finished for the night. Then he’ll go home, and maybe he’ll just fall asleep. Maybe he won’t. Either way, it’s not healthy to be thinking about the other man so often. It’s going to lead to nothing but lust and heartache.
Steve pulls off and uses his thumb and forefinger to stave off Tony’s orgasm. When the risk has passed, Steve starts riffling through the drawer next to the couch for the lube and a condom he knows is there.
Steve found himself at the bar he picked up clients at on Wednesday night. He wasn’t drinking, but he was there looking for a friend who might be able to help him let Paul go. He didn’t know how to tell Paul that he couldn’t see him anymore. He didn’t want to get on the guy’s bad side, but at the same time, he didn’t want to continue their agreement.
“I know,” Steve smiles back. “But I need to get some work done at home. Clean the place, that sort of thing.”
It takes the rest of the night, but eventually, when he’s finished, he manages to get himself into his bed for a few hours of sleep.
Around eight, he heads back outside and gets in his car. He waits a few moments, taking a breath and trying to get his head back into the groove of things. He doesn’t want Tony to see him upset, so he has to shove that part of him down. When he finally goes start the car, he sighs and runs a hand across his face.
Saturday was Max, a closet gay who had inherited a massive dairy farm from his parents. They met Saturdays because Max’s wife and kids went out every weekend to the beach and he had the house to himself. Max was a little older, in his 50s, but Steve didn’t mind. The guy was nice enough and they’d stay cuddled up together for a while and talk about how Max could come out to his family, even though they both knew there was no intention of ever doing so.
Tony scoots himself over to the other side of the tub and presses himself against Steve, his breath millimeters away from Steve’s mouth. “Of course I want to try this with you,” he says, and he kisses Steve deeply. It lasts several seconds before Tony pulls away and then slides back to his side of the tub. “Anyway,” he continues, “I wasn’t really giving you a choice. I was serious about hunting you down.”
“And I want to look like I’m having fun, but not too much fun,” Tony goes on. “Serious face with a smile kind of thing.” Tony laughs suddenly, but it doesn’t seem to be related to what he said before. “Look, I guess this isn’t nearly as hard as I thought it would be. The other guy, I made him sketch me naked and I wanted to display myself in marble. But after thinking about it, I don’t necessarily want my guests to see me in all my glory.”
“So, if you’re okay with it, I’d like to take a few sketches of you before I get started,” Steve says. “A close-up of your face, and then one or two of your body at different angles so I can get an idea of what I’m working with.” He talks absentmindedly, not meaning to let his mind wander where it shouldn’t go.
Instead, he hears Tony clacking away on a laptop keyboard, and the sound eventually lulls him to sleep.
“I imagine the press will do plenty of that for us,” Tony says back. Steve nods, but then his face sets into a scowl that Tony doesn’t like. “What? You didn’t know the paparazzi would show up to an event that I was attending?”
Steve looks down and sees red blood seeping through his shirt, right over his nipple. He sighs and brushes it aside as if that will get rid of the blood.
He was actually a little nervous now, wondering what people would think, or if they’d even notice his canvases in the back. But the experience was enough for him. Just being invited to a high-end event was enough. It was rare he got to enjoy himself, so he was going to make the most of the night.
Tony shakes his head. “You got the worst of it, babe. A car came out of nowhere and pushed you into the intersection. Two oncoming cars smacked into you from there. Everyone is okay, though. It wasn’t your fault.”
A good friend owns the shop so when he gets there he’s greeted like a long lost brother. They jabber on for a few moments before getting down to business.
They pretend to watch TV, but really sitting like this together is just an excuse to enjoy the closeness of each other. They haven’t slept together, in an intimate way, for a week. Just pressing against Tony is enough to make Steve burn a little hotter. He absentmindedly rubs himself against Tony’s body, and it’s only when Tony pretend coughs that Steve grins.
Tony just grins and steps up behind Steve, pressing him gently into the counter as he reaches around and helps butter the bread.
When he gets to the check out line, the woman smiles flirtatiously with him and he just smiles back because he can’t wait to get back home, to make this food, and to eat it with Tony. And maybe after breakfast they’ll have a little fun. Maybe a lot of fun. Maybe they’ll spend the whole afternoon together curled up on the couch and watch old TV reruns.
Steve doesn’t move, just enjoys the feeling of being wrapped up with Tony. He wonders how long they’ve been like this. How long did it take Tony to come to bed after tucking Steve in when they’d first gotten back?
Somehow, over the last two weeks, Steve had managed to spend every night at Stark Tower. He’d go home in the day time, grab some art supplies, and then end up back at Tony’s place. Tony would work in his lab and Steve had set up an easel in the corner, out of the way, so they could watch each other work.
Tony rubs his temple. Steve can tell that he does not like it one bit, that doing nothing might be the one thing Tony Stark cannot do.
“If you’re going to cut me out, then just cut me out and leave it at that!” Tony says. “Don’t dig into this wound like it’s nothing to you.”
“Just a stressful day before the show,” he laughs. “But show me what you brought so we can get it up on the wall.”
Tony pretend pouts, but he starts going through his closet for a suit to wear. He finally finds one and puts it on, tugging uncomfortably at the tie until Steve comes up behind him and reties it.
“I honestly have no idea what you’re talking about,” Tony insists, taking a few steps closer to look at what Steve is holding up. “What is that? A check?”
“Need anything?” Tony asks finally. He’s got Steve tucked into bed, but it’s clear he doesn’t plan on staying. And even though Steve desperately wants him to stay, he shakes his head anyway. He doesn’t want to be a burden on Tony.
“Whatever you want,” Steve breathes back. He clenches his eyes shut when Paul’s hand grips him again, this time reaching down and painfully pulling at one of his balls.
They take one of Tony’s dozen or so cars he keeps parked in the tower garage and head towards the gallery in a peaceful silence. At some point, Tony reaches over and clasps Steve’s hand in his own, holding it the rest of the way there.
“I’m feeling okay,” Steve nods back. It’s not a lie, either. Steve usually heals very quickly, but the car accident must have done more damage than he initially thought because his body is only almost there. His shoulder is still wrapped up in the sling, which is annoying, but the doctor told him to wear it for a week. Tomorrow will be officially a week, so it’ll be coming off for sure. Steve’s back still hurts if he tries to bend or twist too fast, but he is getting around just fine.
And for Steve, that was okay. The less they knew about each other’s pasts, the less questions that might have to have difficult backstories for answers. He likes that they’re building this new relationship just set in the present. They’re both moving forward from the point they met, and that’s all there is to it. He just hopes that it doesn’t become a problem one day, how little they actually know about each other.
Steve stops drawing mid-way up the arm that Tony had draped across his forehead and forces himself to get up. He walks around for a minute, just trying to ignore how painfully hard he is. He thinks about taking a cold shower, but honestly, Steve doubts it’s going to help. The only way to fix that particular problem is to do something about it.
A few hours later, when Steve’s arm has gone to sleep and the pins and needles feeling wakes him up, it takes a few seconds to recognize where he is. Tony is still wrapped around him, their bodies pressed together tightly. Dried come coats his stomach, but he decides there are worse ways to wake up.
Still dressed in his pajamas, Steve gets on the elevator and rides it down to the basement level. He signs contently when he sees Tony under a large metal frame, welding something onto it. Steve watches him for several minutes until Tony puts the welder down and goes for another tool.
The detective nods. “Cuts, bruises. But he’ll be alright. Mr. Swanson claims that their relationship was consensual. A type of BDSM that both men agreed to in advance.”
Steve eventually steps out of the shower onto the cool tile floor and lets the water drip off him before grabbing a towel. He takes several deep breaths to steady himself and then goes to get dressed. From the living room, he can hear the elevator ding and he assume whatever food Tony ordered has arrived. He tries to put on a strong face for Tony. He’s going to eat dinner with him, and he’s going to find something to laugh about. He’s going to move past this whole thing because there doesn’t seem to be any other choice anyway.
The officer nods, and then suddenly the room is empty. It’s just Tony and Steve, and they’re still clutching each other tightly in the same spot on the floor.
Steve takes a deep breath and it shudders back out. He doesn’t want to get up, but his legs are falling asleep and he’s acted immature for long enough. He needs to get up so Tony can see that he is okay, that they are going to be okay.
Steve takes a shallow breath, lets it out, and then bites his lip. He doesn’t even realize he’s biting until Tony reaches over and touches his mouth gently. “Don’t do that,” Tony says.
“I don’t want your money,” Steve insists. He presses the check into Tony’s hands. “Keep it. I don’t need it.”
see anything dangerous. Steve’s eyes wander over to Tony, and he realizes that Tony is doing the same thing.
cook, you know,” Tony says back. “I just choose not to. And making a sandwich isn’t cooking anyway. It’s more like…assembling. And I’m really good at assembling things.”
He’s about to stick his foot into the water when his phone buzzes and he takes a look, smiling when he realizes it’s from Tony. “10/4 Master Sculptor. Supplies will be delivered by 8am.”
“Alright. Well, come over when you’re ready tomorrow. I’ll let the guard shack to know to be expecting you. I may or may not be here. I have an event tomorrow.”
Steve doesn’t respond, but Tony’s hands are still on his hips. He pulls him back again, kisses him again, and tries to deepen the kiss. Steve lets him, using his own hands to grip the sides of Tony’s jacket and pulls him closer.
Steve wipes his face, managing to get it more wet so Tony doesn’t notice the tear leaking onto his cheek. “I just feel so…overwhelmed by you,” Steve confesses.
He knows he needs to call the police, that he shouldn’t even go inside. The perpetrator could still be in there, after all! But he decides to chance it. He’s pretty strong. He could probably take somebody down in a fist fight if he had to.
It only takes about five minutes, but when Steve has checked every closet and under the bed, he’s satisfied that he is home alone. He breathes a little easier, though his body doesn’t completely relax.
Tony seems to know what he’s thinking because his body goes rigid for a second before he takes a step closer. “You can…measure with your hands, if you need to,” he says, and it comes out just as awkwardly as Steve feels about it.
A few times Tony has asked about why Steve doesn’t invite him to his apartment, and Steve just says he likes Tony’s place better. It’s not technically a lie, but he’s also afraid that Paul might see him bring Tony home. Or that Tony might ask why he doesn’t own any dishes. He just isn’t ready to have that conversation yet.
“Mr. Swanson wanted to press charges against you for breaking his nose. We told him he could not, as this happened during the break in and you have a right to defend yourself. We have security footage from Mr. Stark corroborating the events as you have stated, so from my point of view, you have nothing to worry about, Steve. As for Mr. Swanson, he’s being charged with breaking and entering, obtaining an unlicensed weapon with intent to kill, making terroristic threats against Mr. Stark, among other things. He will spend quite a long time behind bars, Steve. You can bet Mr. Stark’s lawyers will see to that.”
Tony looks back at him suspiciously before drying his hands on a clean towel and cupping Steve’s cheek. “You doing okay?” he asks cautiously, as if Steve is suddenly behaving very strangely.
“But you have an idea,” Steve questions. He wants Tony to say it. He wants Tony to admit that Paul is, in fact, a bigger threat than they thought possible.
Tony shifts again, using his hands to move Steve where he wants him. Tony sits back on his knees and slowly pulls Steve’s pajama bottoms down, revealing his growing erection. He wastes no time in wrapping his hand around the base of Steve’s cock, pumping slowly until he’s fully hard.
It’s probably hours later when Steve shifts on the couch, groans a little, and then sits up. Tony shuts his laptop and scoots over beside him.
It feels weird having to do so, but Steve puts “Stark Tower” into his GPS and sits the phone in the seat next to him. He’s seen Stark Tower in the distance, but never been closer enough to actually know where to park or how to get in. He’s actually kind of nervous about going there. Just the stress of driving through the city and somehow having to explain to a guard at the tower that he’s there to see Tony, on invitation of Tony Stark himself, without sounding like a crazy stalker.
Steve smiles, as if that is the only thing that would stop them. He reaches into a cabinet by the bed and brings out a fresh bottle of lubricant and a condom. He presses them into Tony’s hands and then turns onto his back.
But when Tony doesn’t pull away, Steve leans forward and wraps a hand around Tony’s waist. He brings him closer, kisses him deeply, his tongue snaking out to run along Tony’s bottom lip. Tony grants him entrance and suddenly their tongues are pressing together, the kiss hotter than anything Steve has ever experienced.
Steve sucks in a breath, trying to control his emotions. He’s suddenly terrified, and he’s not sure why. For some reason, talking about Paul makes this whole thing real. Someone else believing that Paul caused the car accident makes it even more frightening, because it means it’s a possibility. It means that there’s a man out there who actually wants to harm him, and there’s nothing he can do about it.
“Anyway,” Paul says. “It was nice to see you Steve. We should catch up again soon. I’ll see you around.”
He marks off what needs to be cut and then goes to plug the saw in. He’s glad that he was given a long extension cord because the room is massive, and the sculpture is in the middle of the floor. He’s got enough slack in the cord to work with, so he turns it on and carefully, carefully slices off the top foot, and then maneuvers around the block to begin cutting from one side.
Tony, however, isn’t able to sleep. When he’s sure Steve is out, he gets up and moves over to the lounge chair at the other end of the couch and opens up his laptop. He checks his email for any updates searching for the hit and run vehicle but there aren’t any, and even though that’s frustrating he wasn’t expecting any less. It’s been a week. The trail has gone cold.
“I’m almost done anyway,” he says. “This is the hardest part. Just free-drawing your face. It would have been easier if I had felt the lines before starting.”
Tony comes around and helps Steve to his feet, and they get in the elevator together, riding to the 51
He isn’t sure what the feeling is in his stomach, why it bubbles when he thinks about Tony. He’s not used to feeling like this. He doesn’t know that he’s ever felt like this before. He’s not even sure he likes this feeling. He does know that it’s messing with his head, and he needs to get a hold of himself again. He can’t afford to think about Tony Stark all night. He has work to do.
“Mr. Rogers,” the detective greets him. “Thank you for coming down. I’ve heard a bit from Mr. Stark. Just need to hear your side of things, and we can wrap this all up.”
“I can be there in thirty,” Steve says. “I’m hungry for real food. Then we can talk about what you’re having.”
Steve can feel Tony’s beard scraping against his skin, he can feel Tony’s warmth. He can feel a slight bulge in Tony’s pants from how they’re pressed together.
It’s only three now, so they’ve got two hours before they need to leave for the art show. By the time they sit down on the couch, Tony’s intention is very clear for at least one of those two hours. He instantly tackles Steve, gets him on his back, kisses him hungrily.
“Thank you,” Steve says eventually, and he manages to let go of Tony and turn back to the last dish he was rinsing. When he’s done, he dries his hand on the towel Tony offers him and then they head into the living room together.
After he’s caught his breath again, Ryan starts talking about his job again, how he wishes he could just leave and find something else to do. Steve listens, or, half listens. He’s busy thinking about Tony, what it would be like to have him under him, begging to be fucked, begging Steve to come in him.
him. He liked being made to feel important, special, like he was someone worthy of love. Even if it was just a façade and it was all just meaningless sex for Tony, Steve was glad he’d gotten the opportunity to be a part of whatever it was. And even if Tony broke things off with him tomorrow and he went back to the way things were before, Steve would still be glad for the short time he got to spend with someone as amazing as Tony Stark.
he yells at himself. It doesn’t really work, but it does help stall the growing bulge in his pants. He thinks about old ladies and cabbage for the rest of the ride, and to his relief when he pulls up to the guard shack at the tower, any interest in his previous thoughts has dissipated. The nervousness takes over when he rolls down the window and a guard comes out to greet him.
Steve puts his phone back in his pocket and then he dips back down onto the bed. He stretches out and slowly pulls Tony’s arm back over him. He closes his eyes again, and within a few minutes, he’s sleeping peacefully. Maybe everything will be okay. Maybe waking up with Tony is the first step in the right direction.
He gets out of bed nonetheless and goes to put on a pot of coffee, glaring at himself when he realizes he never bought a new coffee pot and his was shattered into a million pieces. He then glares at the coffee jar, as if it’s the coffee’s fault he’s been enjoying Tony’s morning routine just a little too much.
Tony’s face brightens though, seeming to actually appreciate that someone noticed that he creates things, and that Steve called it art.
“I’m fine. Not the first time someone’s threatened to kill me, honestly. I get death threats all the time. It is the first time that someone I haven’t paid has tried to save me, though.” Tony grins, and his heart flutters when Steve just smiles slightly.
Steve nods, still not completely accepting the facts. He doesn’t remember being in an accident. He was at the store, getting supplies for breakfast. What happened after?
“My parents died when I was in college anyway,” Tony says. “I sometimes wonder if I’d have been happier with them around. Let my dad run the company. Go off and do my own thing.”
Steve sighs, biting his lip again. He can’t help it. The pain keeps him grounded, and right now, he just needs something to hold him together so he doesn’t fall apart in front of Tony.
“One hell of a ride,” Ryan says, shoving his hand into his pocket. He comes back with a folded stack of money. Steve tries not to feel sick when he takes it, pretending he’s being handed anything other than money. “Same time next week?” Ryan says, a smile on his face.
Most artists would stand beside their work to explain questions anyone might have, or to discuss their muse, but Steve preferred to walk around. He didn’t want his work to have his face, necessarily. He wanted people to make judgements on the work, not on the artist.
“Mr. Rogers, when the police arrived at the scene, they pulled you off Mr. Swanson. You were beating him. Do you remember that?”
“Finally,” Paul breathes, and he yanks Steve into the room. He wastes no time in pushing Steve backwards onto the bed, pinning him down, his knee coming to land painfully in the middle of Steve’s abdomen.
Tony moves his hands up and down Steve’s body while they kiss, eventually reaching under his shirt. Steve breaks away from the kiss so he can pull his shirt over his head, groaning a bit when Tony moves down so he can lick one of his nipples.
Steve leads Tony up the stairs to his floor and then has to dig through his pockets for his keys. It’s been a while since he’s been back here, and when he pushes the door open he expects to see dust and cobwebs. Instead, it looks exactly the way he left it.
“Of course whatever I want,” Paul says back. “You’re my little slut. You love it when I do this to you, don’t you?”
He plays it off and laugh a bit. “It’s easier, if you can feel what you’re drawing before you start. That way you have an idea of where the lines need to go, an invisible weight and texture that helps lead the way.”
What happens after that is all a blur to Steve. Blakely walks him to the door, Tony embraces him on the other side, and they are excused and allowed to go home. Steve doesn’t remember walking to the car, or Tony reaching across to buckle him in, or even the ride back to the tower. Finally, when Tony comes around to his side of the car and opens the door, Steve looks up and realizes that he’s been a ghost for too long.
When they finally emerge, the guards block the view so whoever might have been watching can’t see what shape they’re in. Steve starts to head for the front door, expecting Tony to just follow, but instead Tony leads him back to his work that hangs in the middle of the gallery.
Tony laughs at that. “I’m not worried about cost,” he says, waving his hand. “I just want it finished so it can be the center piece at my party.”
They finally come to the large pile of supplies that were delivered. The basswood is a massive chunk that will certainly have to be trimmed down before Steve can start carving anything. It’s eight feet tall, about four feet thick and probably weighs a couple hundred pounds. All the tools he needs have been provided as well. Paints, lacquers, everything he asked for is right here.
He manages to open his eyes again, and this time keeps them open for a few seconds so he can look around the room. The first thing he sees is Tony sitting in a chair next to the bed, his head leaned back; asleep. It’s Tony’s hand who is gripping Steve’s so tightly, though.
Steve just grins and turns his head so he can press a kiss to Tony’s temple. “I’d say most starving artists appreciate it,” he says finally. “Just not this one.”
Things could have been a lot worse than they were. Steve could have died, and that thought scares Tony. They’ve only been together for, officially, a few weeks, but Tony likes the way things are going. He’s already planning how he can arrange his space, how he can make room for Steve so they can be together all the time. He doesn’t even know if that’s something Steve wants, but Tony is willing to give long-term a try. And that’s a first for him.
Tony isn’t completely sure why he’s so fixated on finding Paul, but he knows he has to do it. Even if it’s simply to make Steve feel safer in the world, Tony will do it.
Tony takes him by the hand and leads him further into his house. They make it to the couch where Tony pushes Steve back slightly, letting his legs hit the edge and he falls into a seated position, Tony coming down to straddle him.
He glances at the clock, realizing that he’d been able to sleep for a few hours. His brain feels refreshed, though his body is still a little stiff from the events of the afternoon. As the seconds tick by, though, the peace he feels is replaced by the feeling of fear he’d been experiencing since the beginning of Paul’s threats. His body goes a little stiff and he sighs, knowing that even though things should be over, they are far from over.
“It’s a habit, I guess. I want everything to be perfect and if my head is somewhere else then it can’t be perfect.”
Tony drives as usual, and since Steve is still a bit weary of cars after the accident. He knows it’s extremely unlikely to be cornered again but he still lets his eyes wander around the streets in hopes that he
“This is the place,” Steve says, his voice still lower than usual. For some reason he’s suddenly very self-conscious about showing Tony where he has lived for so long. It doesn’t look like it’ll be enough anymore, even though it was always enough before he met Tony.
Steve moves slowly, watching the gun as he moves towards Tony. When he reaches him, Steve touches his hand, which is perched on the bar in plain view. Obviously Paul must have told him to stay visible, so Steve puts his hands on the counter as well.
Tony reaches up with his hand and cups Steve’s cheek. They stare at each other, the feelings between them being too much to say out loud.
“I’m too much of a wuss to do anything, anyway,” Steve shrugs. “All I can do is hope he gets tired of bothering me.”
“It’s going to be okay,” Tony says. “This isn’t even my first scandal, Steve. Don’t you watch the news?”
When the doctor leaves the room again, Steve doesn’t want to sit back down on the bed. He actually dreads doing that.
“It’s probably in the trash somewhere. Hopefully some homeless guy finds it and has himself a good laugh too.”
Steve’s alarm goes off way too early and he groans as he reaches around to shut it off. He takes a look at the time, 7:30 AM, before groaning loudly and slowly sitting up in bed.
