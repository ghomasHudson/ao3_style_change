It had been 6 weeks since Ash had announced that she was pregnant, the morning sickness had gotten better if she ate as soon as she woke up in the morning. Dean always made sure she had peanut butter and crackers made and stacked on a plate on her bedside table with a glass of water. He still worried about her and the baby but the weight that she was gaining now made him relax a little.
I…I’m…so….sss…oorry….ba…by…I did...did…n’t…mean…,” God she hated how pitiful she sounded! “to maa…ke…him…go….aa…waay!” Dean griped her tighter and through the tears he stared at her hard. “Ashby Renee Winchester, don’t you even go there! Cas, that bastard, it is his fault!” Dean spit out. Ash quickly said regaining some composer, “NO, NO, Dean, don’t call him that, he is still our fiancé, or rather your fiancé, you know you don’t have to call me a Winchester. Cas is the one you should be calling by your name.” “As I just said, Ashby Renee Winchester, or do you not want me without Cas?” he said with a painfully questioning voice, she could hear the way she had just cut him with her words. “Oh Dean, of course I want you, you are so brave and strong, your My Hunter, you make me feel like I am this beautiful, wanted, creature that I know I am not but that is how you say you see me. I love you so much! I am just afraid without Castiel you wouldn’t want me either! I feel so empty, so alone in my own head, my own body, I mean if I can’t even keep Cas with me, with us, how am I supposed to be able to keep you?”
Dean was the first to break the silence, “So about last night, Sam I’m sorry, I was a jack ass.” Dean said looking at Sam, “I am just protective and I was mad you guys went behind my back to take Ash and Cas on a hunt.” Sam looked at his brother in awe, what was this? Dean Winchester apologizing for being an ass, without having to prod him too, wow, Cas and Ashby were good for his brother. “I get it Dean,” Sam replied, “I really do but Hunting is the family business and if Ash is part of the family she has to learn how to defend herself, you know? Besides she is Cas’s vessel, I mean it is unlike any vessel angel relationship I have ever witnessed or head of, but he loves her too right?” Dean nodded his head and answered “Yes.” Sam continued. “That means he is there to protect her as well and plus, you CAN”T stop Castiel from hunting, I mean he is a freaking angel after all.”
“Oh Crap” is all that Dean can say before he literally leaps up on the table, jumps off of it to the other side to grab Cas as he falls to the ground. “Cas, Cas, wake up Buddy, SAMMY…., Sam places his hand on his older brothers shoulder and says. “I’m here, are they breathing?” “Yeah, yeah, breathing….”as he picks Cas’s slumped form off the floor and carries the unconscious being to one of the couches on the far side of the room. Dean and Sam both look concerned but it its Dean who truly looks like he is about to go into a panic attack. Thought visibly racing through his mind, thoughts of, “Oh GOD what have I done, Oh, Cas don’t leave us, don’t leave ME again!” When he gets Cas down on the couch, Cas’s eyelids flutter.
Sam set at his desk in the war room, Eileen was on a video conference with Bobby and a few other hunters that had been trying to track down Cas. It had been 9 weeks and the only lead they had was Gabriel was also missing. The lead ended up getting them nowhere, they tracked him down to a certain point and then he just disappeared. Sam hated the pain that he saw in his brother’s eyes, he could have never guessed that Cas would willing leave Dean ever again, he knew the angel loved him but to leave Ash, that made Sam Winchesters blood boil! She was in shock, she was disoriented at times and hearing her scream out in her sleep for Castiel was unbearable.
Cas, straightening his back looks first at Sam and then at Dean and states, “Hunting? We can’t go hunting with you except on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, we have a job to do at the nursing home, people who need us. You don’t understand how good a nurse Ash is, how she soothes the weary and gives a little hope to the hopeless. I told you once before she has walked a different path but she is still a righteous warrior, she is a Righteous Woman! WE…” Dean interrupts, “Dammit, Cas,” Dean says while slamming his fist on the table, will you stop with the “We” and “Us” crap, I mean she is just a vessel, I mean that body is JUST a meat suit…. Before he could finish the sentence Cas stood up and with literal white hot holy fire in his eyes and the voice of an angel bellow. “Dean Winchester, I pulled you up from perdition and you know our bond is eternal, strong and far more powerful than you give it credit for but I will no allow you refer to the sweet spirit whom I now call my vessel to be called a ‘meat suit’, she is beautiful, treasured soul and I will not abide it!” At the moment the last syllables of the sentence come out of Cas’s mouth, the fire dies from his eyes and he slumps to the floor.
Ash was more than obliging, as she stood up she removed her skirt and panties and placed them on the floor beside her bra. She took Cas’s hand and pulled him up to his feet pressing herself flush with his body, kissing him as she unbuttoned his shirt and removed his pants and boxers the rest of the way. Leaving him now completely exposed to her. He took the opportunity to take her hand and lead her to the cabin’s bedroom and ease her down onto the bed. She spread her legs wide enough for him to lay between her legs, groin to groin, chest to chest. He braced his arms by her shoulders and she took him once again in her hand and assisted him to enter her.
Ashby Mullins felt she had been on a rollercoaster tonight! She had been hunting with her family, taking down a nasty skin walker in the back woods of Ohio. Before tonight Ash would have told you that in her opinion nothing good ever came out of Ohio, well except for the license plates on Dean’s Baby, she guessed. Well, that certainly changed in a hurry tonight. Now as she stood there in the parking lot of a rundown karaoke bar with one of the two most gorgeous men in existence kneeled down on one knee in front of her and Cas, asking them to marry him, she was gob smacked, standing there with her mouth hanging open, unable to speak. She looked up from those mossy green eyes that she loved so much and looked at the others in their party, they wore the same expression on their faces.
Remembering her own struggle with cancer and the memories of the life she lived in her 15 day medically induced coma. Her memories of nursing school, her first job as at Cline County Jail, working Juvie, moving to Garvin’s Harbor and starting to work at the prison. People getting sick, turning on each other. Her teenaged son dying in her arms, her husband kissing her goodbye for the last time, her little Moma shuffling towards her, she was the one who had to pull the trigger each time, she was the one who had to burn the bodies, so many bodies. Moving through life in a daze just going through the motions.
The last few days had been especially rough on Sissy, Sam thought, she was sick most of time. Her cheeks that were usually round seemed sunk in a bit. It was worrying the hell out of Dean and Sam alike. So today Eileen and Ash went to town alone. Dean objected, no he down right told her no! When he said that she gave him a look that could make the bravest warrior to their knees. “Dean Winchester, you listen to me, I will not be told what to do, I want to go out with Eileen, Dean began to interrupt but Ash stopped him, “no, no, no you are going to stay here with Bubbie and search for leads to find Castiel!” He did as he was told but this had Dean even more on edge than he normally was lately. Pacing back and forth in the War room looking at his phone every few seconds. “Dammit Sammy, where could they be? It only takes 20 minutes to get to town and 20 minutes back, what could be taking them 2 freaking hours!?” Dean growled. “Look Dean, they probably just enjoying the weather, it’s nice out and Ash has been cooped up in here for over two months, set down and stop pacing, you’re working a groove in the marble, dude.” Sam growled back at his brother.
Ash felt like death, she felt like a zombie, like her guts had been ripped out and were swinging around the feet right now, waiting to painfully trip her up. She was moved from the bedroom to the War Room and sat on the same loveseat that they has on the first day they had come to the bunker. “They no more,” she thought, “only me in here now.” She felt so empty that she could just float away if the right wind blew right now. The only thing that she felt that was holding her down to the earth was Dean’s strong arms wrapped protectively around her. She seriously thought that he was thinking she would disappear too if he let her out of his sight for a minute. Heck, he was even following her to the bathroom when nature called.
Sam saw Dean raise his hands in a peace offering and waited for Ash to move before he kneeled down to untie Cas, who had a busted lip and a black eye. Dean looked at Cas as he sat up and said “Cas, Angel, I’M sorry it was wrong for me to hit you, I am just so damn mad and hurt. Why did you leave us? It just about killed Ash, I was afraid I was going to lose her too.” Dean cried. “Dean, I know what I did was right but I went about it the wrong way. I will know I will have to spend a lot of time and effort to gain your trust.” Cas replied. Ash was right there beside Cas and once again wrapped her arms around him, crying happy tears. “Well, we can discuss this shortly but right now, let’s get you cleaned up and all of us changed out of these wet clothes, I am freezing!” “Of, Course My Angel.” Cas breathed, his nose buried deep into Ash’s wet hair, a look of hope bright on both their faces. Dean however was still scowling through his tears as they walked back to their room.
She was getting pretty good at her telepathy and had to really work to keep from hearing Dean’s thoughts all the time. He knew she could hear him and he knew she tried to give him the privacy of his own thoughts but sometimes things bleed through. To be honest they erupted through at times, Dean was a loud thinker especially when it came to three things: food (especially pie), his car and sex. For example Ash would be making food in the kitchen and Dean would walk in the room, loudly thinking about how good whatever it was smelled and then if she bent over or leaned against the counter in a way Dean thought appealing she would know it right away usually hearing a thought of “daammnn”. He often thought about making love to her or Cas in the kitchen, something she nor Cas would let him do but it didn’t stop him from thinking about it.
She looked back at Dean, his hopeful look was slowly becoming concerned, so Ash snapped her mouth shut for a second. Took a deep breath and before she could even think about it yelled, “Are you crazy, of course!” Dean put the ring on their left ring finger and jumped up to give them a fierce kiss.  He grabbed them around the waist, lifted them off of the ground and spun them around as if they weighed nothing at all. Ashby started giggling and telling Dean he needed to put them down or they were gong to hurt his back. When their feet hit the ground again Cas began talking to Ash in a rush, so fast and furious she hardly could keep up. She pulled away from Dean who had the biggest, goofiest grin she had ever seen stretched across his face and said “That’s my answer, Cas would like to speak with you now.” With that she let go of control and let Cas take over.
Dean knew he should be grateful to her for bringing Cas back to them. However, everything was so out of whack with the way Dean thought it should be and he was not ready to just look past this change. It was too much after losing Cas again, thinking that this time it was forever. The loss of it, the loss of his and Sam’s angel was yet another hole in Dean’s heart, a stain on his already tattered, scarred soul. He knew he was being unreasonable, but dammit all, he was going to take his own sweet time working out this in his head.
She stepped close to the man reaching her hand to touch his dark stubbled face. The man visible leaned into the touch, closing his eyes and sighing, turning his nose as if to breathe Ash in. Dean did not like that one bit. “Hey Prev, if you sniff my wife again like that you won’t be able to smell ever again, I can promise you that.” Dean informed the man. The man straightened and opened his blue, blue eyes and stared at Dean with such intensity, once again the twist in his gut and the shock down his spine. Ash spoke then, “I am going to listen to your thoughts, do not try to block me, do not try to lie, I will know and you will not like what happens when The Winchesters are lied to.”
Dean swallowed the sip of beer that he was swallowing HARD, spitting, sputtering and coughing loudly. “Cas, have you lost your freakin’ mind? I am not sharing you and Ash with anyone else!” Cas held up a hand to stop Dean and said, “No Dean you misunderstand, I meant you, me AND Ash, in the cabin between the worlds. I have been learning how to boost my ability to help Ash take all three of our consciousness there. I think I have found a way and as strong as Ashby is now it won’t weaken her. What do you say?” Dean stared at him slack jawed for a moment and then exclaimed with a devilish grin on his face, “Yeah Buddy! That is something I have fantasized about since just about day one with you two! As long it doesn’t hurt you or Ash, I am all for it! Getting to make love to my Heart and my Soul at the same time, did you really think I would say no! That is the stuff porno dreams are made of!” Then he paused for a minute and sheepishly asked, “IS it ok with you Ashby?” Ash then pushed her thoughts at Dean, “Oh Sweetie, yes, oh GOD yes! I’ll be the center of a hunk sandwich, I would be insane to say no.” This made both Dean and Cas laugh so they planned to attempt it tomorrow after a good nights sleep.
“Holy Crap Cas, that has to be the most beautiful sight in all of creation, like ever!” Ash smiled and glanced down the pink flush of arousal and embarrassment noticeably appearing on her soft round face. Cas was the first to move, he was crawling on all fours to the end of the bed, eyes locked on Ash, an almost feral look in his eyes. Dean felt himself harden at the look that was not even attended for him. Cas raised up to his knees and wrapped his strong arms around Ash, kissing her heatedly. Dean was wrong, this was the most beautiful thing in creation, his Heart and Soul locked in a passionate embrace.
Ash felt Dean fill her up for the first time, he felt so right but a wave of doubt filled her mind, "Oh Cas, this should be you, you’re the one he really wants.” Cas spoke to her in a whisper to her mind, “Oh Ash my love, we both want you.” With this she let herself release the worry and fears and be with one of the three parts of her heart, her very being. Oh, how she wished she could touch Cas like this too, but that was impossible, she told herself. She allowed herself to focus on the man buried deep inside her right now. She loved him as much as she loved Cas, she wanted him too, he was so sexy, so handsome, strong and giving. She never had to worry about her or Cas’s protection when he was around.
The rain and lightning was so bad, he did not want Ash out there, afraid for her and his unborn niece or nephew. He knew that she was a tough, smart, resourceful hunter but she was also his family, so he trained his sawed off at the man in the coat and waited for instructions. When Ash told Dean to take the trench coat wearing man into the bunker, Sam took another look at Ash and knew she was about to throw up, pass out, or both. Sam stepped up beside her and held her hair as she lost what little was in her stomach. He walked her back in, making sure she was steady enough to stand on her own before he let go of her.
“Dean, he is listening you know that, besides if I was gone he could just find another vessel. Maybe this time it will be some 20 year old Busty Asian Beauty that you would actually find attractive. I mean at least you could be physically intimate with Castiel without throwing on the brakes when I or Cas attempt to go further with you than making out. You usually stop dead in your tracks when you actually touch any skin on our body other than our hand or arms. I know it because of me Dean, the way I look, my weight, being almost 41 years old! “Ash was yelling, she knew she shouldn’t picked this time to speak her mind. She rubbed her face with both hands, she was getting a headache from the stress of Dean being so upset and the fact that was screaming inside her head right now. Thankfully, Cas did not just forced his way into control or Ash would have been eternally pissed off.
They made back to the motel sometime after midnight, Sam and Eileen going to their room and Dean, Ash and Cas to theirs. As they showered and got ready for bed Ash was back in control, Cas was preoccupied and for some reason he was being blocking Ash from hearing what he was doing. This was OK because Ash would do the same things at times, especially when she wanted to think about something nice she wanted to do for Cas when they stole their time together in the cabin between the worlds. However, Cas had never blocked Ash before but she just let it go. As she and Dean snuggled themselves into bed, Cas felt very distant, it had been such a long day and she was tired so she kissed her Hunter goodnight, prayed to her angel and fell into a deep sleep.
Cas opens up brilliant blue eyes that hold a warmth that comes from deep within, she reaches up her hand and touches the cheek of the man bent over her. Giving a look of pure joy that makes her eyes twinkle like blue diamonds, without even thinking about it Dean leans in to the soft touch. “Oh, you must be Dean,” she drops her hand from Dean’s stubbly face and continues, “What did you do to Castiel?  That boy has been trying to find you for months, he’s here but really angry and hurt.” Her clear, soft voice is very different from the one that comes out of the vessel when Cas is “at the wheel”, the accent a little thicker, the voice a little more lilting. Even though it is so different, Dean doesn’t know why but the sound of it makes him feel that same jolt of peace, comfort and love that he did after listening to Cas’s message on his old phone. The same feeling he has always had with Cas.
Dean is the first one to move, opening the door and stepping out of the car with his hand in the right pocket of his jean jacket. He glances around, and then his face transforms, into the most brilliant smile. Green eyes surrounded by the laugh lines Cas knows so well and has adored for so long. Of course the smile does not shine in his eyes, it stops with the crinkles around them. He opens his mouth to speak, and once again Ash has to remind Cas to breathe. “Hello there Sweetheart, are you ready to take a ride? You know we have so much catching up to do.” Cas takes another step closer to the hunter and looks him dead in the eyes, squaring his posture and simply replying. “Hello Dean, yes I am.” Dean returns the look for a second and then there is a flash of confusion that comes across his face. It is a moment of almost recognition that Cas, knows to be a hopeful look, but the older hunter is a professional and quickly collects himself, opens the passenger’s side back door and holds the door while Cas climbs in.
Ash breathed a sigh of relief, she could still be very over sensitive, especially when it came to the thought of Cas or Dean leaving her. She felt tired all of the sudden, the cabin around her began to fade out again, and she felt herself melting back into her body. For a second she did not feel Cas there with her but then he was there in the foreground of her consciousness telling her that he was there. She then let herself slip into unconsciousness and she slept a sleep full of peace.
The Wedding:
With this on his mind he asked Ash a question, “Do you really think you will be able to stay with Cas very long? Angelic vessels tend to have their souls burn out pretty quickly, of course I have never heard of or seen a case where the host and the angel both share control of the body voluntarily. Most angels are so strong of will to hold the control of the body that it takes the persons soul a significant amount of energy to take control. This burns them out faster and it only usually happens in times of severe emotional, spiritual or physical pain.” As Sam was talking she nodded her head a bit, showing that she understood what he was saying. “Frankly, I don’t know. We have never really discussed it. I have always assumed that once we found Cas’s family, when we found Y’all, he would let me just fade into the back ground. Cas never gave me any indication that he would want me to continue to work at the nursing home, or that he wouldn’t resume hunting with you and Dean.”
As they stepped out of the piles of clothing on the bedroom floor Ash stepped back and looked Dean up and down. The look in her eyes told him that she liked what she saw. Dean watched her face as her hands ran over his shoulders, chest and stomach. Her eyed dipped lower to take all of him, she made a little O shape with her mouth, reached out with her small hand and delicate fingers wrapping them around his length and began to gently stroke him, Dean started to fall apart. He grabbed her and laid her down on the bed taking a moment to take all of her in, trying to memorize every curve, the way her strong legs spread inviting him to come closer, the way her arms reached for him, and the delicious way her very full breasts heaved with the movement of her chest where she had been breathing heavily, from all the running, all the emotions and all the want and need. He couldn’t wait any longer Dean had to be one with this wonderful woman. He bent down to kiss her again as he took his hand and touched her most intimate places for the first time.
As soon as they had the Impala safely parked in the bunkers garage, Dean and Ash jumped out of the car. Dean grabbed Ash once again, claiming her lips, running his hands over her rounded bottom and wide hips. “Cas she feels, tastes and smells so freakin’ good.” Dean thought to himself and to Cas, his hands sliding up under her t-shirt to feel the velvety soft skin of her back, crushing all those gorgeous curves against him. “How did I ever not want a woman like Ash, Cas, it makes no sense?” he prayed. Cas was silent, but a burst of angelic grace radiated out from Cas essence, through Ash and into Dean, leaving Dean and Ash both trembling and so in need. The burst of grace also healed the marks on Ash’s body from the hunt earlier.
Dean once again did as he was told and he sat up on his knees and lined himself up with Cas and pressed himself in. The tight, warm, slick feeling of Cas wrapped around him felt like a dream. He looked down at Cas, his Angel, he was muscular and strong, Dean did not have to worry about breaking or hurting him like he did some women he had been with. He took the lead and reached down to Cas with one hand, once again wrapped his fingers around Cas’s penis and began to stroke him in rhythm with the strokes he was giving to Cas. With the other hand he held Cas’s hip to better secure them together.
Unlike Cas this was not Ashby’s first wedding. That had happened over 20 years and a lifetime ago. She had married Dean in a small ceremony at the bunker when she was about 6 months pregnant with DJ. Cas and Dean wanted to wait until Cas could legally marry both of them before having a big wedding. To be honest she would have been just find with a ceremony at the bunker for the three of them, just surrounded by close family. However, Castiel and Dean wanted everyone they had ever known (and who were still alive) to be at their wedding. So Ash said yes to the whole thing to make her husband’s happy.
She was trying to tug his shirt above his head as well but having very little luck because Dean wouldn’t give her much room to move. She only managed to get his t-shirt and undershirt pulled up under his under arms. Dean didn’t want to brake contact with her, she felt like a dream, but he knew in order to feel as much of her as possible pressed up against him they both had to get their clothes off. He pulled out of the kiss once again to look into those amazing blue eyes and let her pull the shirts the rest of the way off.
Cas opened his mouth to meet Dean’s tongue with his, Dean didn’t know what to do really but just kept kissing Cas. Even in this male body Cas aroused him in a way no other person ever had, well not until they had found Ashby, at least. Dean realized in that moment it didn’t matter what form Cas took, male, female, it didn’t matter. He would always love and want his Angel, his Soul. With that thought Dean pressed Cas up against the log wall of the cabin, pressed his body up against the shorter man and intensified his kiss.
Sam noticed that Ash was chewing one minute then stopped, she was looking up from her bowl of chili and cornbread eyes fixed straight in front of her, then she muttered in her sweet drawl, as she met Sam’s eyes,“Uh,oh, Bubbie now we’re in for it!” Sam turned his head to see his older brother rage walking toward them a frantic look in his eyes, Sam rolled his eyes. This was NOT going to be fun at all! Sam stood up and but himself between Dean and Ash and Cas. “Look Dean don’t freak out, everything is ok…we are all OK!” Sam saw Dean raise his hands and place them palm side up, an offering that said, “Hey, I’m cool, your cool, we’re cool.” He sat in the both beside Ash and Cas and threw his arm around their shoulders. He leaned down and gently placed a kiss on their lips avoiding the split on the right side of their lower lip.  This was a shock but a relief to Sam because he had never seen his brother do anything but hold their hand or kiss them on the top of their head. He was glad they could share that kind of affection.
They spent another hour or so laying in the big bed together, talking and snuggling. There happiness and contentment are palpable to them all. Then they feel Ash begin to fade slightly, the potion reaching the end of its efficacy. Cas kisses both of his lovers again and “We will be together again, I love you both so much, Dean you are my hero, my hunter and Ash you are MY Angel! Just know that no matter what happens, I love you two. I will fight heaven, hell purgatory and earth to come home to you no matter what the odds. Ash I think you need to return all of us back to the bunker, I know you are tired.” “Ok, Castiel,” She says as she kisses him again. They all slowly find themselves back in their bedroom. Cas and Ash once again in one body and Dean holding them tight. The humans drift off to sleep and the Angel waits to make his move.
After Dean got out of the shower and dressed for the day it was only 0630 so he thought he might as well get some coffee going and cruise the internet for a case. After all they were all hunter’s here and despite preparing for the wedding, they had nothing productive to do. Well, Dean thought to himself, making love to his fiancés all day long is highly productive but not in the traditional sense. They needed to work, so they needed a case, so research it was.
Sam ponders what Ash's presence will mean to all of them and tries to get some answers and Dean pops off at the mouth because, of course he does!
This came in very handy in those times that one or more of them got separated from one another. Her range was getting better all the time. At first she could only hear thoughts a few rooms or maybe 6 feet over from where she was. But unfortunately she could not pick out individual background thoughts, they all had to think “really loudly” at her to get to her. Now she could hear the thoughts of everyone with in a quarter mile radius, she was able to selectively pick out different “voices” and tune into them.
At first she had as hard time shutting down the ability, when walking in a crowded grocery store or bar, it was enough to almost floor her at first. Cas was there at first to help her cope in those times, shielding her mind with his presence and his grace. However, it had been months now since Cas had to intervene and even though she was proud of her ability to be more self-sufficient in the field, she missed that protective presence at times. Dean also was a lot more at ease having her on cases, knowing she knew how to fight and how to use her powers well. Physically, even though she was now 42 years old she had not been in this good of shape since high school and her days of softball and weight lifting. This being said she was still very curvy and had a lot of softness still over all that muscle. AS for her looks could still pass for a woman in her early 30’s and did on a lot of cases. She often wondered if her youthful appearance didn’t have to do with Cas’s angelic influence but she never thought to ask and Cas never mentioned anything about it.
“I will not fight or lie to you Ashby, I just want to be home with my family, with my Hunter and my Angel. You know that is what you are, don’t you Ashby, you are my Savior, my Angel, it was your strength that got me through the process of re constructing my body.” The man said to Ash, staring deep into her eyes. Dean had to jump to catch Ash as she cried out and slumped to the ground, her head landing in the man’s lap. “Cas, Cas, it is you! Oh My Angel!” She cried out throwing her arms around his middle, tears streaming down her face. Dean was on his knees beside her in a blink of an eye, looking the man, looking Cas in the eyes.
Dean ran to her, wrapping his strong arms around her and pressing her to his chest. She began to cry and shake uncontrollably. She was so scared that Dean would freak out but she had to tell him. If she could only get herself under control. She took a breath and focused on the little flitter of a heart beat she had saw on the screen earlier. She opened her eyes and stepped away from Dean and for the first time in several weeks she felt like she could breathe a little. She still felt somewhat empty inside, like her body and mind were just too big for just her to be in there but she was carrying inside her another life, another soul. She needed to pull up her big girl panties and cowgirl up.
It took them 10 minutes to travel what would have taken them at normal highway speeds about 25 minutes, to get home. Dean was basically on auto pilot at this point because all he could think of was how long he had waited for this. He could feel the want and need coming off of Ash and Cas in waves. He needed to let Cas know that wanted him too. So he said a silent prayer to Castiel and got an answer right away. “Make love to her tonight, I will be there, I will feel it. I want to feel her too you know, I want to feel you, I want all of us to complete the circle. I will find a way, just give it time. ”Cas told Dean in his head. This only made Dean more desperate to get in the bunker to his room, hell, it was going to be hard for him to get them through War Room or hallways without possibly making Sam very uncomfortable.
Cas huffed, “Her name is Ashby Mullins, she prefers to be called Ash, she is a gentle soul with a will of iron. She may have walked different roads and taken a different path than you but she is just as much a warrior as the two of you! Yes, I have changed because of her, she can interact with me in a way that no vessel ever has been to before and if you two do anything to harm her soul, her spirit I will SMITE you!” With this both Winchester’s actually gulped at the ferocity of their voice, the smooth, sweet Southern tones and the force of angelic power combined with the “Nurse Mullins mode” voice to make the hairs on their neck’s stand up. In fact, Cas could see the hairs on Dean’s forearms standing on edge right now.
Ash let her hands roam over the hard contours of Dean’s back, his round muscular bottom and his strong upper arms as he leaned into her. He was moaning with every stroke of her hand over his body. “Oh Ash, oh my Heart, you feel amazing, so wet, so tight, like silk.” He moaned into her ear. His hips were steadily gliding him in and out of her, his mouth on her neck or mouth. He sat up on his knees and adjusted her to meet his body. He looked down at her and at that moment, for the first time since her best friend, her Husband Alan had died she actually felt beautiful and sexy.
Cas laughed, “Yes, I know this and neither am I, although Ash has helped me learn what it means to feel and how to process emotions. More than I was ever able to with Jimmy Novak’s body. I learned a bit every time I was turned into a human but Ash knows how to open my sense of self and teach me what I am capable of. We can learn Dean, together, Ash is willing to teach you as well.” Dean, looked his Angel in the eyes and nodded. Dean spoke, “Cas, I know you know her really well and love her too but I have just met her and she seems like a great gal but she’s a stranger.” Cas took this as a turn to nod their head. “Here Dean, let me show you, who she is.” Cas placed a hand on Dean’s forehead and a rush of images, emotions and memories flooded the hunter’s head.
Ok Guys, I would love some feedback on where to take this next! Thanks in advance!
Cas and Dean profess their love for one another and Cas helps Dean and Ashby get to know each other better.
Even now with Cas back home, back safe with his Family, Dean felt that hole as real and raw as it was the day before he had just happened to check one of his old cell phones to look at messages that Cas had sent him before he was gone. This was when he found the new message from an unknown number from Washington State. This sweet, lilting voice with a slight Southern drawl was telling him that “Dean, this is Cas, I know you thought I was gone forever but, I have a new vessel and want to come home to you, to you Sam and Jack. We have made our way across country and are living in Lawrence. Ashby Mullins is my vessels name, we are working as a nurse at a local nursing home facility, The Shepard’s Field. Please, call or message me back.”
Ash as a little girl talking to a young boy with dark circles under his eyes, who no one else could see. Her singing on her Pa Schmitt’s radio show with her uncle Robbie on Sundays mornings. Her playing softball as a child, running and falling over her own feet because she was so pigeon footed. Her and her little sister in the back seat of her Moma’s 1965 Mustang watching the cars behind them. Losing her Grandmother at 9 year old, feeling rejected by her Dad’s side of the family. Coming home from Elementary school and doing chores around her Grandma and Grandpa Jenkins laundromat. Having to move away from her home to follow her Moma to a new life with another husband. Her Moma’s bought with cancer and how scared she was that she would lose her like she lost her Grandma Schmitt. The abuse and bulling that surrounded her, the self-loathing, how she saw herself as ugly and fat. Playing softball and learning to weight lift. Losing her Dad at age 18, watching him wither, and caring for him while he fought cancer. Her friends, her first love, her first lover and then her husband. Nights of love, the long wait for a child, the joy of being a Mommy, and a wife.
At first Dean wasn’t sure how deep to take the kiss only placing his lips against the lips of the blue eyed, brown hair individual before him. Dean knew Cas had just told him how he felt but there was Ash to think of as well. This was still her body after all and he did not want force her into anything. It was with that thought on Dean’s mind, Dean heard Ash’s voice in his head, “Dean, Sweetie just show him how you feel, it is one of the reasons I am here. I want him to be happy.” Dean didn't even think to ask how Ash was able to speak to him this way, not until much later anyway. However, Dean took what she said and deepened the kiss, moving his lips with Cas’s in a slow soft motion. Cas let a small happy moan escape and parted their lips slightly. This was all it took to convince Dean to give Cas the deepest kiss he had ever given to anyone in his entire existence. Their tongues slowly but firmly sliding against one another, not waring for dominance but as equals who knew exactly how to share the same space at the same time.
They had reached the nine month mark already when Cas and Ash had finally wore him down enough to convinced Sam to sneak them out of the bunker to go on a hunt. They had been working really hard with Ash to train her to know what to do incase Cas was incapacitated and she had to fight her own way out of a situation. Sam was more than willing to take them on a hunt but Dean would not hear of it. “Sammy,” he said, “I know it’s Cas but it is not just Cas anymore. Ash was not raised for this, she is a civilian really and way too fragile, she can’t protect herself and I can’t protect myself if I am worrying about her. I can’t risk losing Cas again, what if he can’t find a new vessel and on top of that losing Ash would kill me and Cas both! Is that what you want to do? Do want to kill both the loves of my life and me too, do ya Sammy?”
Ash yawned a big yawn and Dean smiling at her and did the same thing. Cas spoke to Ash, “My love you rest now, May I talk to Dean?” To which she answered him with her mind, “Of Course my Angel, I love you, thank you for giving me this.” Cas told her that she did not need to thank her, he quite enjoyed himself too and that he loved her very much. With that Ash slipped into the back ground of their combined consciousness and Cas could tell that she was content and peaceful and felt wanted, needed and loved. This made him overjoyed.
They met Eileen and Sam in the hall as they were heading to the security monitors. Dean and Ash signaled that they were going up the stairs, when Eileen made the most god awful sound out of her throat, like she was being strangled and Sam was white as a sheet. Ashby, must have heard their thoughts because her head snapped in their direction, stopping dead in her tracks and yelling, “CASTIEL!!!” Confusion, anger, and then relief flew over face and then she was off in a run again, heading up the stairs before Dean could even blink.
“Cas, my Soul, you have been my savior, my defender, my best friend, and all around pain in my ass for a long time now,” Another babbling of laughter, “ I mean that in the bast way, you have pulled me up by my bootstraps and carried me through some of the roughest times of my life. Buddy, I KNOW that without you I WOULDN”T be here today, marrying you and Ash. NO one here could have ever pegged me for falling in love with a dude, least of all me but you are more than that, you are my eternal companion, no matter what vessel you might have. I love you Cas, more than life itself. I promise you to never let you go, I will go to hell myself and pull you out if I have too. You and me and Ash we are it, we are the end all, be all for me. I promise to turn to you even when it is hard. I promise that I will try to live up to the righteous man you are, the righteous man you have made me to be.” Dean let out on big whoosh of an exhale at the end of his vows. He looked younger than his almost 45 years he had been on earth; that in and of itself was a miracle Bobby thought.
Dean laid down in the bed and scooched in closer to her again, wrapping his arms around her and kissing her softly. “Don’t you ever think that I don’t want you Ash! I want you forever and always. You are perfection for me. Cas and I would be lost without you now. I know I was umm…being an...um….ass earlier but I just freaked out. I know you and Cas can handle yourselves, you can handle yourself even without Cas but the thought of losing you was too much. Then where talking about Cas getting another vessel and you leaving us, I don’t know. The thought of being with anyone but you and Cas just seemed, it just SEEMS wrong.” Dean said as he hugged her tight.
“How the Hell did we end up here?” Robert Singer thought to himself. Sam and Dean Winchester were like sons to him, son’s he would and had laid down his life for. Now Dean was married and had a kid, but not only that but Dean and Ash were marrying a friggin’ male angel! How the ungodly hell! Don’t get him wrong he loved all of them very much. Heck, Ash had quickly became his “baby girl” and Cas had long been a Winchester in most ways but now it was going to be official! Now Boddy did not want to think about the dynamic of their love life, that just made his head swim but he was so glad that his kids were happy and in love.
He was so caught up in his own thoughts that he practically plowed through Cas, who was standing in the open door of the room that Dean wanted Cas and Ash to call home. He instinctively wrapped his arm around Cas to steady the angel. Dean felt a warm current run through him as his arm cradled around the Angel’s back. Dean’s eyes trailed from the electric blue eyes to the small, pink lips that were slightly parted, he looked over the face of the person in his arms and saw his best friend, his fellow warrior and at that moment he knew that there was no denying that his feelings for this celestial being ran deeper than he could ever admit and it had been that way for a long time. He tried to deny it for so long but this time it was different, this time he was not going to let himself chicken out. Dean Winchester was going to tell Cas the truth. He didn’t know how or when but it had to be soon because it was about to kill him if he didn’t get it off his chest soon. Dean shook his head to clear his thoughts and after making sure Cas’s feet were firmly on the ground, dropped his arm to his side. Dean looked Cas in the eyes once again and said, “Um, sorry there Cas, didn’t mean to run ya over. Let’s go into the room and talk about our next steps.”
Cas stepped in then and kissed Ashby, he wrapped his arms around her and held on for dear life. He had never felt like this before. Sure he had his share of sexual encounters but this was different, Ash filled him with wonder, with love and with hope like no other human ever to exist save for Dean Winchester. Dean was right, she felt, smelled and tasted divine. Castiel was unsure what to do next, he didn’t know how far to take the kiss, or where to put his hands that was acceptable to Ash. It was as if she could read his thoughts because she stepped back from the kiss for a moment to look Cas in the eyes.
We learn more about Cas's new vessel and begin the task of reintroducing Cas to Sam and Dean.
Over the next two months everything for Ashby was amazing, except for one thing, Cas began to be more and more distant, shutting her off from him more and more often. At first she really didn’t think about it but as the weeks went on she noticed that he would be shut off for hours at a time. They still spent a few hours a week in the cabin her and Cas, Cas and Dean also spent time there, while Ash would help them have their time alone. Cas still seemed like he wanted to be with her as much as he always did but when she would start to discuss the wedding, Cas would become distracted and insist that they return to her body and let her rest.
He saw Dean flop down on the loveseat against the wall, head hung down with a hand on each side of his head elbows braced on each knee rubbing his face and hair. “Ash is sick, Sam, I think being without Cas is going to kill her, I want you to know that if we have to burn her body your gonna have to burn me too, right beside her. I won’t live in a world without her, not for a minute. I have lost my Soul, that we know can be lived through,” he laughed bitterly, “but Sam I can’t live without my Heart, I just can’t, not for you, not for Bobby, not for anyone.” Sam looked at his brother. Dean was not kidding, it broke Sam’s heart. “Not even for Cas?” Sam asked but before Dean could answer Eileen and Ash came the down the stairs.
“Dean, are you sure this is what you want? You can be sealed with Ash but you do not have to be sealed to me.” Cas breathed. Dean looked at him and frowned, a deep consternated look that made the lines between his eyes bunch up. “Yeah, Cas if I didn’t mean it I would have never asked. Why?  You don’t want to marry me, be with me forever?” Dean asked with an edge of panic in his voice. “Of course I do Dean, I just wanted to make sure, and yes Dean Winchester I too will marry you.” Cas replied. Then Cas grabbed dean by the collar of his shirt and pulled him down in a heated kiss and applied just a touch of his grace into it to really seal the deal.
As soon as both their hands were down they both went to remove each other’s jeans and underwear. It took Ash a second longer to get Dean’s belt undone and then to slide his boxers and jeans down to the floor than it did for him to pull her pants and panties off in one smooth motion. The release of pressure on Dean’s groin was enough to make him groan with pleasure. His blood filled member brushing against Ash’s soft abdomen, made the groan last even longer. He wanted her so bad but he didn’t want to rush this anymore than his body would let him. It had been a long time, well over a year, almost two since he had slept with anyone and YEARS since he had made love to anyone.
Sam was walking quickly, holding a small child that did not look too happy about what was going on at the moment. Dean’s heart swelled with pride, that child was his son, his name was Dean Winchester Junior but they just called the green eyed boy DJ. He was 14 months old now and a hand full, of course he was, he was his son and a Winchester after all. He began crawling at 5 ½ months and was walking by 10 months old. By the time he was 1 year he was talking in full sentences. Dean could hear him now Crying, “Unc Am, Unc Am, I wan my Dada.” Mom, Dad, I really wish you could be here right now, I miss and love you guys so much. I hope that you both are proud of your sons and the life we have built.
Once safely inside bunker Dean, Sam and Cas enter he war room he sees Jack setting at the large map table that dominates the center of the room. Jack jumps up and makes a bee line for Cas. Dean moves to step in but Sam grabs his arm and shakes his head at Dean. Sam the nods toward the Nephilim and whispers, "Wait." Dean then turns to look at his Son and his Angel. Jack already has his arms wrapped around the shorter, curvy, brunette in front of him. The boy is furiously kissing their cheeks and crying. "Papa! I am so glad you are home I have missed you so much! Daddy and Uncle Sam have been a mess with you not here. I kept telling them that you are fine and that you were just getting things ready for you to come back home, but would they listen to me, No!"
Dean had never really kissed another man before, it was quite different from kissing any woman he had ever kissed. His lips were soft but a little chapped. The stubble on his face scratched against the stubble on Cas’s face but it wasn’t unpleasant, in fact it felt good, too damn good. This was Cas, the being who had pulled him out of hell, the Angel who changed his life forever. He was the angel that no matter how far down a dark path he or Cas had ever taken it had led them right back to each other. Dean took all that love, lose and unspoken words of love flow from him as he crushed Cas to him and deepened the kiss.
He want to try the projection process with Ash and Dean but knew that it would be tricky. Maybe, he thought, it would be easier with just Ash to start with. So on the same night Dean had his dream of Cas, Ash and the baby, Cas told Ash he wanted to try something, if she was willing. “Oh Cas, “she thought, “sure, what do you want to do?” He had her lie down on their bed and relax, taking deep breaths and focusing on the sound of Cas’s inner voice, the gravelly, deep rumble that used to come out of Jimmy’s body. At this time Cas’s essence projected his physical self into a dimensional space that he had created several years ago. He then he took Ash’s mind and projected her there as well. He was worried that it was going to be difficult but it was quite easy actually.
He had removed his grace from Ash 9 weeks ago and with very few exceptions most hours out of the day he could hear Dean and Ashby call out to him. They were hurt, Dean angry and Ash feeling guilty and lost. Cas’s only peace came from the knowledge that they had each other. He had to hold onto that, he knew that he may have killed the happiness that could have been between his Hunter, himself and Ashby but he had to make the move. He had to find a way to save Ashby and still be with both of them for as long as they both lived and afterwards as well. Ash was strong, more powerful than Cas, Dean or even Ash herself had ever imagined. She was not weakening as quickly as they suspected she might but she was still weakening, her soul was weakening from the connection her and Cas shared. The fact that the two could exist in one body mostly independently was unheard of, literally. In the millennia Angels had been taking earthly vessels never had there been a bond like theirs.
Cas and Ash reached Bobby and took them both by the arm one on one side and one on the other. They both looked at Bobby, eyes misty and sparkling with joy. When they all stopped at the end of the procession Bobby loos up to see the officiate Pastor David Gideon, standing  in the middle the platform, Dean and Sam off to the left, Jody and Eileen off to the middle right and Gabriel and Charlie off to the far right. Gideon began to address the audience. “Friends, family, hunters, angels and demons alike we are here to witness a very special occasion the joining of not two but three individuals in eternal matrimony. Who gives this bride and this groom away? “I Bobby Singer do, I place this woman Ashby Renee and this angel Castiel into the eternal care of my idjit of a boy Dean Winchester. Dean stepped forward, Ash and Cas both gave Bobby a kiss on the cheek, and then Dean took a hand from each of his loves.
Cas was the one who cut the umbilical cord as well, Dean was way too shaky and frankly Cas thought he might pass out at any second. Cas looked into the soul of the tiny child and saw the same supernova bright light just like his Mother and Father had but what was really surprising was that there was also a touch of angelic grace attached to the child’s soul. What was even more fascinating was it was Cas’s grace that was held in the soul of their child, so in a very real way the little boy was Cas’s child as much as Dean’s The child was not a Nephilim but something different all together. He was a human with some of the powers of an angel.  What those powers would look like when the manifested no one knew.  What Cas did know was that he had never felt as complete as when he was surrounded by Ash, Dean and holding Dean Jr. for the first time.
“Dean my Hunter, my protector, my love, you have never had an easy road, betrayed and cast aside so many times. I want you to know I will never leave you, I will love you until the universe dies away. You are such a good man, a man who has fought and will fight for his family and this world even if it means his life. You do not have to fight alone anymore, I am with you. Do not be afraid to turn to me, no matter how dark, how hopeless you may think it might be, we can overcome together, you, Cas and me. I promise you that I will always do my best to help you remember how strong, good and righteous you really are.” Ash had managed to keep from bawling, which is more than Bobby could say for himself at the moment.
Ash and Cas were both really glad to hear from him, and to know that the whole hunting party was ok. When Dean told them it would probably be another two or so days before he and Sam would get home, they took it well but he could tell they were disappointed. Hell, he was disappointed! The thing was that Cas was a hunter too and understood how it goes on a hunt. Ash had learned a lot in the almost year she had been with Cas and the Winchesters and was a good soldier about it as well. That broke Dean’s heart to think about, Ash being yet another Winchester solider against the ever rising tide of the supernatural but he was so glad to have her. She had brought Cas back to him, she had brought herself to him and for that he was forever grateful, forever changed.
“I understand that, you two have been manipulated, mutilated, killed, resurrected and lied to more than should ever have been allowed, but I am not here to deceive you. I am here to be reunited with my Family. I found this new vessel and she found me, she willingly gave herself so that I could be in human form once again. I am not as you say “screwing” with you about any of this.” was Cas’s reply.
When Dean thought he couldn’t take it any longer, Cas relented and stood up to look into Dean’s eyes. “Dean, I want you to make love to me now. If that is what you want.” Cas and Dean both removed their clothes as they made their way to the bed kissing as they went. Dean trying to reconcile what he should do with what he wanted to do. So he thought, what the hell, just roll with it Dean. “Yes, Cas, I want to make love to you too, but I don’t know how, not really.” Dean admitted Cas replied, “OH Dean, I have been doing research so let me show you how.” The thought of Cas’s “research” made Dean even harder, imagining Cas reading and watching porn to learn how to make love to him, it filled him with a sense of happiness that a few years ago, heck a few months ago he would have never expected to feel.
She looked at between him and Dean, and Sam was sure that she would stare at Dean for longer than was comfortable, like Cas did, but she didn’t. If anything she was looking as Sam more than Dean, because Sam was actually looking at her when she talked to him. Dean was the one staring, just he would at Cas but when Ash looked Dean’s way Sam noticed he tended to look the other direction really quickly.
“Hey Dean, you listenin’ boy?” Bobby was yelling over the phone. Sam punched Dean in the arm gently to rouse him from whatever thoughts he was sharing with Ash. “Yeah, Bobby I’M here. So is Ash.” “Now you two don’t panic, I know that you both are already there but, try to relax. We don’t know what Cas has in mind. Ash did he give you any indication that he was leaving?” “No Sir, we were so happy last night, he and I talked for a minute after Dean and I had gone to bed and he said nothing, just that he loved me and for me to get some rest.” Ash replied. “Well baby girl, we are going to find Cas, but let me tell you, he is going to get an ass whoopin’ for scarring and upsetting you so, oh and upsetting Dean too, ya know.” He said almost as an afterthought but not really. “Let me run down some leads, call in some favors and I will call back in a couple of hours. Sam, Dean, and Eileen you take care of my baby girl you got it.” Bobby said. To which they all gave a resounding yes.
Cas was expecting Dean to close the back door and get into the passenger’s side front seat but, to Cas’s surprise he walked all the way around the Impala and opened the back driver’s side door and crawled in. His right hand still in his jacket pocket. Cas knew it most likely held a gun or an angel blade, but he was still able to keep a neutral expression on his vessels kind face. “A resting Nurse” face was what Ash referred to that particular facial expression. The tone of voice that accompanied that particular face was a no nonsense, authoritative way of speaking to the individual on the other side of the conversation. Right now Cas was using Ash’s “Nurse Mullins” mode, to let Dean know that they were “not bothered” by his menacing posture.
I speak to her through the Spirit, “My name is Castiel, I am what you would call a heavenly messenger. I am here to help you, let me in and I will give you purpose once again and a family to love and cherish, forever! All you have to is except me, let me become part of you, let me ease your pain. Do you accept me.?”  She whispers in a sweet, soft voice that sings to my very essence, “Yes, Castiel, what do I have to do?” I reply, “Just let me in.”, and she does.
Sam heard someone padding down the hall and looked up to see his Big Brother strolling through the door, scratching his chin and yawning widely. “Hey there Dean, I expected you to be the last up and out of bed after the night you had.” Dean gave him a pointed look but shrugged his shoulders and smiled wide enough Sam thought his head might crack open. Sam shrugged his own shoulders and said.” Oh well, there’s coffee and OJ, I made eggs, sausage and bacon, oh and toast if you’re hungry.” “Yeah Sammy, that sounds good,” Dean replied as he grabbed a plate and started to pile it up with food. Of course just as Sam predicted, Dean scrunched up his nose at the turkey bacon but took some of the sausage. Amazingly Dean did not complain about the healthier options, “WOW,” Sam thought, “He must be in a good mood.” They set there in silence until both of them were done eating, just enjoying the quiet of the morning.
Dean felt a relief wash over him and as he listened to the message several times again, that voice called to him. He didn’t know why but it stirred something in him, in fact he knew from that moment it WAS Cas who called, it was his best friend, his angel of Thursdays and temperance, his Angel.  Of course, that was too much a chick thing to say so when he told Sammy about the message he explained it away as checking the phone was just to see if anyone from their past needed their help.
Sam wondered at first how Eileen and Ashby would get along. Sam wasn’t too worried though because Ash was so easy to like. She knew how to just listen and let people vent but she also would call bull on you too if she thought you were being a “Ninny” as she put it. Her smile lit up the room, she was smart, funny and she was someone Sam and Eileen could talk to. She had actually video chatted with him and Eileen one night just a few weeks after Sam and Dean had found Cas and her and both he and Eileen were pleased to find out she knew sign language as well.
Now lying in bed his head on Ash’s breast, her strong arms wrapped around him, stroking his hair and back kissing the top of his head, he was beginning to drift back off to sleep.  As Ash was humming softly to him, warm and content, the alarms started going off. Dean and Ash were both on their feet in an instant. Dean pulling on lounge pants and his boots. Ash throwing on her leggings under her long t-shirt that she was sleeping in and her boots as well, both pulling their bedside guns out of their respective night stands. He looked at her and his heart swelled, this was one bad ass woman, funny, smart, strong and sexy. She gave him that look again, “Cowboy get your head in the game.” Sometimes it was hard living with a telepath.
He saw the man tied to the chair, it was more than he looked just like Cas, the voice, his mannerisms, exactly the same, unsettling to say the least. If this wasn’t Cas, this person was a dead man, hell, even if it was Cas, the looks that Dean was giving him did not bode well. Sam jumped from his musing as his Sissy fell to her knees into the man’s lap. Dean fell beside her. Sam could not look away as both his brother and Ashby kissed this man in a very passionate, intimate way as if they were the only people in the room. Sam had never seen Dean kiss a man before but obviously he had kisses Cas many times because he kissed him like he knew exactly what he was doing.
Dean looked over, rolled his eyes and took his hand out of his jacket pocket and grabbed Cas’s hand. Dean once again looked them in the eye and peered deep, shifting forward so that their noses were almost touching. Dean took only a second longer before he looked away again, scrunching “Oh Cas, Dude, why did it have to be a fat chick, couldn’t she have been hot or something, I mean, son of a bitch, what the hell!” Sam looked back and hollered at Dean, “Dude, that is uncalled for! There is nothing wrong with Cas’s new vessel! Besides, it sounds like Cas’s is half in love with her as it is, you better watch out or he might just smite you.” He said with a kind smile and hearty chuckle. It’s good to have you back, Cas. I knew it was you as soon as I saw your eyes, they are exactly the same, how is that even possible, I mean not just the presence behind them but the color and everything? It is kinda freaky though.”
With this they had arrived at the bunker and all piled out of the car, Sam ran around the car and grabbed Cas, to which Cas was bracing for a fight but to his surprise, the younger of the brothers wrapped Cas in the biggest bear hug imaginable. Sam was squeezing so hard that it took all the lung power that Ash’s lungs would muster to wheeze, “Can’t breathe, human still needs to breathe!” Sam relaxed the hug just a little bit, at that point Cas then threw their arms around the middle of Sam and gave him a long hug back.
Sam and Eileen saw his brother and his future sister in law signal for them to monitor the video surveillance, while they went to check the doors. When Eileen and Sam looked at the night vision camera that was located just outside the main entrance to the bunker, they saw a familiar figure wind whipping through his coat, wet and standing so still he very could have been a statue. Sam snapped his head to look at Eileen as she made a loud strangled noise, he looked to her and mouthed, “Cas?” She quickly signed “God, I hope it’s him.” Ash had stopped so quickly she looked like she had hit a wall. She looked at them and yelled the angel’s name, then she was in motion again. Dean paused for a second but was quickly running to catch up with her.
As promised, five minutes later, the car Cas was anticipating came around the corner and stopped just of 20 ft from the bus stop pavilion. Ash, was quietly reminding Cas that he needed to breathe and that he might as well go introduce this new face to the two of the three most important people in his existence. So Cas stood up and straightened the royal blue scrub top and bottoms that were standard issue at the particular nursing home that they had been working at for that last month, which was fine with Cas, because they made these new eyes appear even a deeper blue then they did in any other color clothing. It was comforting to him to look in the mirror and see almost exactly the same color blue that he had worn with Jimmy Novak, looking back at him in the mirror.
They were there in heartbeat it seemed, Dean shutting the door and locking it behind them. He spun around and faced Ash, grabbing her and undressing her as he backed her to the bed. Ash watched Dean look her over hungrily as she backed up to place herself higher on the bed. Then Dean stripped his clothes as well. Crawling toward her on the bed, taking her knees and pushing them apart. He then dipped his head down and buried his face in her lap. She felt a shock go through her as his skilled tongue met the small bundle of nerves at the top of the most intimate part of her body. She heard him moan, the most wonderful growl bubbling out of his throat. “Ash, oh GOD, you taste so good, mmmmm, oh how I am going to make you come again and again and again.” He breathed. All she could do was call his name and thread her hands through his short cropped hair. He slipped two of his wide fingers into her and moaned again. “So wet, so wet for me.” The vibrations of his moan vibrating threw her and bringing her to the edge of ecstasy and with the next lave of his tongue and push and pull of his fingers it through here over the edge and into full blown orgasm.
“God, I love you Ash, god, I want you, need you so bad right now, for now and ALWAYS.” Dean growled, his already deep voice thick with need as he began to kiss her as if he wanted to devour her. Ash responded in kind but after a moment she broke away from their passionate kisses. “Dean, Sweetie, If you don’t get me back to the bedroom I am going to have to make love to you right here, that would be quite a show for Sam and Eileen when they get home.” “Well, we can’t let them getting all jealous of the way you make me scream, now can we?” Dean replied a devilish smile on his handsome face, his eyes a stormy green. It was enough to make Ash remember her own name. He grabbed her by the hand and started leading her to their room.
It was a crisp autumn day in the Great Smoky Mountains, the leaves bright in their reds, yellows and oranges. The little cabin and surrounding area was a buzz of activity. There was a catering tent at the far side of the clearing, the smell of Big Bob Gipson’s BBQ thick in the air. One of the many things Ash had taught Dean about that he now loved. To be honest though, for once, Dean was not hungry he was way too nervous to eat. The ceremony was only about an hour away and Dean could not set still, he was pacing back and forth on the cabin’s front porch, trying to drink some coffee. Sam was walking up the path to the cabin from further into the woods were Ash and Cas’s dressing tents were located, the ceremony would be at a small pavilion by the deep creek that flowed through the woods.
Cas looked up to see that Sam had tears streaming down his cheeks. He stood there in front of them while Eileen held him, his chin resting on her head. Eileen stepped back from Sam, with a bright smile on her face and signed so fast that Dean had trouble keeping up so Sam had to translate. “About damn time Dean, somebody needed to make you an honest man a long time ago. I should have guessed it would take more than one person to make you settle down. It took an Angel and a Telepath to get to you!” Sam stepped up to Dean, Ash and Cas and wrapped his long arms around them. “I am so happy for you three, Cas you have been family for a long time and Ash, I love you Sissy!” Cas replied to Sam. “Ash says she loves you too Bubbie, as do I Sam.”
So with these thoughts running through my consciousness, I am listening, waiting for someone to call for help. I wait and listen and remember the days that have been, the fleeting moments with my Family and longing with every fiber of my being to return to them again. To be able to tell all of them things I never got to say, to say. Show them things I never got to show them. I want to be able to tell Dean that I love him, more than just a brother, that my whole being calls out for him. I know I may face rejection but is something I have to do. I need to do.
Sam was the first to stir out of bed the next morning. He had not come home right away after the diner but had come home in time to hear the ruckus coming from Dean’s room, then Dean’s bathroom and finally Cas and Ash’s bedroom. Well, he figured that he might as well start making breakfast because the other human’s in the house were probably going to be ravenous after a night FULL on exertion.
Dean opened the passenger’s side door of the Impala for Ash and promptly closed the door behind her as she put on her seatbelt. She knew Cas felt it ridiculous that Dean would not even consider starting the car without them buckling in. He was an angel after all and would not be seriously hurt, thus Ash would not be either but Dean INSISTED. As he climbed into the driver’s seat and put on his own belt she wondered if he was even too mad to tell Cas and her apart, but after about ten minutes  of traveling in silence  he cleared that up when Dean growled at her. “Let me speak with Castiel!” She looked at Dean and simply said, “No.” What do you mean no? I want to speak with the Angel, you know the one willing to sacrifice you and him both, to leave me alone, I can’t handle, Ashby, I can’t, Sam would have to burn my body right beside yours.”
“So your, Cas huh? If you are who you say you are, you know it is not going to be that easy! We will meet you five minutes after you get out of the nursing home. Yeah that’s right, we know where you work, live, eat and by this point we know where you shit. So don’t worry, we can find you, and if you ARE screwing with us you WILL regret it!” Cas sighed loudly, of course they wouldn’t be easy, they had been lied to, manipulated and hurt so many times and he had been gone for several months before he was able to find Ash. Cas replied back to the boys (with the encouragement of Ash, because she found the phrase and the story behind it “hi-larious”), “Ok, just don’t be too much of an Assbutt!” and then sat down on the bus stop bench and waited for the sound of an very specific engine to arrive.
Ash is setting in bed, holding her chest, crying uncontrollably into Sammy’s arms. Her lovely face transformed into a mask of pain and sorrow. She turns her head to see Dean standing there, “Dean, He left me, oh my God, he left us! He’s gone, he’s gone, I, I….”back into uncontrollable sobs. Dean takes her into his arms from Sam and pulls her into his lap. “My Heart, oh my heart, shhh, can you guys go call Bobby and please get her a glass of water and a cool wet rag?” Dean felt his voice crack and waiver, he could feel the tears pricking his eyes. Sam squeezed his shoulder and nodded his head, he and Eileen exited the room.
and all set down around the map table. They all set in uncomfortable silence for several minute until Sam is the first to speak up. “So..uh..Cas what are you going to need? I mean your old clothes don’t fit and we don’t have anything in..um..your size, do we need to go shopping?” Cas then replies, “No I have all I need back at the apartment in town. I have two sets of street clothes for our days off of work and 9 sets of scrubs that we wear while on duty.” Wait,” Sam interjects, ”You can’t go hunting in bright blue scrubs Cas, I mean, you will stick out like a sore thumb!” Dean immediately starts shouting in an angry voice, “What the HELL Sammy, we ARE NOT taking her, er...him, oh hell…them on a hunt! He rubs the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger, trying to stave off the headache that threatens to become a supernova of a migraine.
Cas had never leaned on the knowledge and skills of his vessel before and found it exhausting but fascinating, in fact he never knew he could interact with his vessel in such a way. He kept reminding Ash’s soul/consciousness that she could rest once he was home, however, she was insistent that helping him learn “a good bedside manner was wonderful” and that “she was not alone anymore,” so she was fine with the arrangement right now. Plus, she knew that this could not last forever, she would have to move on eventually or Cas would have to find a new vessel. Seeing that he was so fond of Ash, he did not want to do that if it was not necessary, or if that was what Ash wanted.
“Oh, I see.” Dean said. “But, Cas you can’t keep her forever, eventually she will start to fade out and it will just be you in there. I know she made the bargain, but did you expect this?” Cas made a contemplative face that told Dean all he needed to know. “No, I guess you didn’t. Look Cas, I don’t know how this is going to work, but man, I’m here for you, you know that, right? I mean you deserve love and comfort and Sammy and I have you back so I guess…um…you have finally found a…um…soulmate. I’m happy for you!” Cas felt a stirring from within his consciousness, it was Ash telling him to spill it already. “Tell the boy how you feel, he deserves to know that you love him in every way possible. He loves you too, otherwise he would have not reacted the way he did to me. He won’t reject you.” Ash thought at him.
They went on dates and had nights in just like other couples except Cas and Ash shared the same body and had to take turns spending time with Dean. Cas and Ash each took their turn manning the wheel as it where throughout their day and Dean had long since been able to figure out which was which by body language and tone of voice. However, those deep electric blue eyes always were the same. Always calling to him in the most profound, deep, meaningful and at times needy ways. It was enough to drive him crazy at times. Yet Dean Winchester promised to be a good boy and wait it out, even if it killed him.
As Ash walked through the door she saw both Sam and Dean standup as if they were preparing to go into battle at any second. She felt horrible, sick most of the day for days now and emotionally drained. Smells bothered her, especially fried chicken, when she realized that and the fact that she hadn’t had a period since the first one after Cas left she began to panic. When she was much younger, 24 to be exact she had gotten pregnant with her and Alan’s only child James. One of the worst things about her pregnancy was that any time she smelled fried chicken she got violently ill.
Angelic essence is all I am now, I feel so un-tethered after being in human form for so long. I miss so many things, the feel of the wind on my face, the smell of pancakes on the griddle and being able to touch things. I know that Sam and Dean are probably mourning me, again, and that makes me feel even more unfettered and it scares me. I miss Jack, the child that chose me. How is he processing this? He has lost his Mother Kelly soon after his birth and now less than 3 years old he has once again lost a parent. The only thing that brings me comfort is that Jack still has Sam and Dean to love and nurture him. I do not know how long I have been gone but I know it is at least a few weeks. So here I am after so many years with my own body, the body that once belonged to Jimmy Novak, the body that I thought was mine, and I am looking for another vessel.
Cas makes his way across country to Kansas, where he has to lean on Ash's experience as a nurse and waits for the boys to reply. They do after a month.
The first months after returning with his body it had been trying on all of them. Ash was an emotional wreck, pregnant and still feeling lost without Cas’s indwelling; Dean was angry and very protective of the mother of his child, even with Cas. It took a good 6 months for Dean to stop looking at Cas as if he was going to bolt at any minute, which Cas could not blame him given his past but the looks still hurt. Emotions were still new to Cas in grand scheme of his life but Dean and Ash had taught him so much. Every day the three of them grew once again close, sure there were some fights and a lot of Cas proving himself to them again but eventually they all three fell into a rhythm and were insanely happy for the first time in a long time.
He had not told either one of them what he was doing, he knew he couldn’t because they would find it too dangerous and unnecessary. He knew that Ash was finding him more and more distant from her, hiding his thoughts, feelings and intentions from her, he hated it but didn’t know what else to do. The research and preparation was very consuming by itself but to block Ashby took extra. Once he left her body, he felt that sense of being untethered, floating through the ether once again until Gabriel could harness him into a focus that would hold him until the long ritual was done. There he had been for 40 days, the only way he knew was Gabriel informed him of each new day on Earth. Not that Cas really needed it he could hear his lovers call to him in their waking hours and only heard silence when he knew that must be sleeping. Even then their dreams could come to him as if they were prayers.
It was decided that for the time being Cas and Ash would continue to work at the nursing home, and spend their weeks at their apartment. Their days off they spent at the bunker with Sam and Dean. There were a few weeks that they wondered the halls of the bunker alone when Sam and Dean were out hunting but for the most part Tuesdays and Wednesdays Dean made sure they were home so that he could spend time with Cas and Ash. There were several nights Thursday through Monday that you would find Dean over at Cas and Ash’s apartment after they got off of work, to feed Ash dinner or set on the couch and hold hands. Even when Dean didn’t drop by they never let a day go by without at least talking on the phone for a few minutes to at least tell one another they loved each other.
Dean reached out and gently touched the screen, his eyes full of wonder. “He healed you, Ash, Cas healed you and as soon as he was gone you got pregnant with my baby. My child, Ash you are going to have my child, I’M going to a DADDY! Hell, yeah!” Dean got the goofiest grin on his face and it changed his whole body. His spine was straighter, his smile genuine stretching from the crinkles at the corners of his eyes to his mouth and echoed in his hazel green eyes. “Sammy, you’re gonna be a friggin’ uncle, I gotta call Bobby, he’s gonna be a grandpa! It is a boy or a girl? Wait it’s too soon to tell, right? Oh God, I hope it’s a boy, I don’t think this Daddy could take a teenage girl but then again she’ll be raised by a bunch of hunters so she bound to be bad ass, especially with you for a Momma.” Dean babbled at them all. For the first time in over a month, the Winchester family members who still living in the bunker laughed together. It was good.
He did not know who to touch or kiss first, his head spun at the very idea of what was actually going on here. He was having a threesome with his fiancés, but it was nothing like he had ever experienced so far, the Double Mint Twins paled in comparison to this! His very being, his soul burned for these two amazing individuals. Dean came up right alongside Cas and looked at Ash and then Cas and whispered, “Keep kissing, please.” They were kissing again before the please was out of his mouth. Dean then reached down and placed on hand on Cas’s cock and on between Ash’s legs. They all started moaning. Cas was so hard and Ash was so wet and her clit as hard as a pebble. After only a few strokes of his fingers, Ash broke her kiss with Cas and threw her head back and started calling their names. ‘Oh, Cas, Oh Dean, oh yeah, oh God, Dean, umm, so good, CASTIEL!”
As the music began to play Bobby turned to look down the two branching aisles to wait for the groom and bride to appear. Cas was the first to catch his eye, handsome and proud, with a smile of contentment on his face, walked toward him. Ash was next, she looked like a goddess her Brandy colored hair swept up in curls and her face covered by a lacy veil, the creamy colored dress making her skin glow. Bobby immediately started to choke up, tears threatening to spill over looking at his adopted daughter.
Their lives had been happy through the year and a half and Ash liked to think she had something to do with it. They ate, lived, hunted and played together. The road was theirs and they always had the bunker to go home to and if you asked Dean or Sam they would tell you that they had never been so happy. One of their favorite things to do after a hunt is to find whatever dive bar nearest to the hunt that they just finished and have a few drinks, shoot some pool or throw some darts. This is where the whole clan, Dean, Sam, Eileen and Ash and Cas found themselves on a cold, wet night in December somewhere in Ohio just a few days before Ash’s 42nd Birthday.
Sam will never forget about seven weeks ago Dean called them, while they were on the road tracking down another fruitless lead, in a panic. Forty-three years old and he was freaking out because Ash had started her “monthlies” as Dean put it  for the first time since Cas had found her and Dean had to go to the store and get “supplies.” He had no idea what to do and was freaking out about being away from her, and was too embarrassed to call and ask Ashby what she needed. Eileen just rolled her eyes and signed to Sam what he needed to get. Dean groaning with each new item, pads, cramp relief meds, a heating pad and Eileen stressed, chocolate! That was the only item on the list Dean seemed more than happy to buy.
Dean and Ash made love again in the shower, they took their time and only stopped once the water had ran completely cold. Cas just sat back and let it happen. He tried to keep his own thoughts away from their time together but their emotions, Ash’s hormones and brain kept bringing him back to them. He watched through Ash’s eyes as Ash and Dean washed each other in the very cold water. He listened as to them talk as they were dressing for bed and making their way back to her and Cas’s bedroom. Ash and Dean were both exhausted and in need of rest, but Cas needed to talk to Dean. Ash kissed Dean Goodnight as they tucked each other into bed.
Boddy looked from Cas to Dean when it was his turn to speak, Sam was standing right over his shoulder because the boy looked like he was about to drop. Dean looked at Ash and then Cas and began to stammer like the friggin’ lovable idjit Bobby knew he was. “Um, well, most of you, well, all of you know I’m not much for speeches but…I…UM,” he took a deep breath and looked once again at Ash and Cas, and continued more steadily than before. “Ash, my Heart, you have made the world a place of wonder and peace for us. I will never be alone again, I will never have to feel as if I am alone, because of you. You came into my life as a way that Cas could be with his family again but you quickly became a part of that family. Your brains, brass and beauty are amazing, and on top of that you’re sexy as HELL!” The crowd laughed heartily a moment before Dean continued, “I am the luckiest SOB ever to walk this earth because of who you are and how you love Cas and me. I promise to protect you and let you protect me, I promise to never shy away from letting you into my thoughts and feelings. I will, with every fiber of my being for all eternity show you that you are the sexiest, most beautiful, bravest, most loving woman I have ever met.”
Dean and Cas had worked hard to mend their relationship for all their sakes and as a result had grown even stronger. To see Dean so happy after such a sad life before was such a gift for Ash. They still had their moments but it was few and far between that they actually fought nowadays. Dean still got sulky and lashed out a bit when he was hurt but those emotions and actions were more tempered now. Cas with his reduced power had become more and more in touch with his emotions even without Ash and Dean’s assistance. Cas was a wonderfully giving, loving individual who never sought anything for himself, not even in the love making department. He was always focused on Ash and Dean, sometimes the literally had to make him lie still and allow them to focus on him.
Dean is moaning into her mouth as she kissed him while she stretches him out, her nimble fingers brushing against the bundle of nerves that curve inside Dean. He knows that she can find it easily, because she has with him many, many times. Dean is hard and throbbing so Cas reaches down and begins to gently stroke him, making him buck hard on Ash’s hand. She looks up at Cas and says in a husky voice, her accent still lilting, “I think he’s ready for you Angel.” “Are you ready Dean?” Cas asks. “Yes, oh yes, Angel, yes.” Is Dean’s reply.
Gabriel popped back into the tent holding Dean Jr., the child had been teleported so many times in his short life he thought it was normal. Those lessons would come later and Cas would be there to guild him. Dean Jr. was laughing wildly at the crazy faces Gabe was making until he saw Cas. “Papa, Papa,” Dean Jr. squealed and stretched out his chubby arms for his Papa to take him. Cas gathered the little boy in his arms, holding him close and kissing the top of his head. Never in all the millennia that Castiel had lived would he have ever imagined this life. Not only was he marrying Dean Winchester (who would have ever guessed Dean would marry anyone let along a male angel AND a curvy woman), he was also marrying an amazing woman who had at one time been his vessel. The cherry on the top of it all was the fact that Cas was a father.
The Wedding:
As he lay there on his back Cas laid down in bed beside him and began to kiss Dean, his hands running over the planes of Dean’s chest and stomach. As Cas kissed Dean, his tongue dancing in and out of Dean’s mouth, Castiel moved his hand to where Dean and Ash’s bodies met and began to stroke both Ash and Dean. Two fingers sliding against Ash and branching in a v to rub Dean on each side of his penis as Ash rocked back and forth on Dean. She placed her hands on Dean’s chest and raised up on her knees to allow access for Cas to touch Dean and Ash both but not breaking contact between the Hunter and his Heart. It was almost than Dean could stand, he was barley holding in, trying not to come so quickly. As if knowing what he was thinking, Ash spoke, “Dean Baby, let go, I want to feel you come inside me.” That did it! Dean came apart, his orgasm making his whole body shudder. He was practically screaming around Cas’s tongue. After a good two minutes of feeling himself pulse gush after gush unto Ash, he found himself softening and Ash moving off of him.
“Ash My Heart, you never have to worry about me leaving you, even after death I will be with you, your eternal companion remember? I mean it, you are my Heart, I can’t live with a heart I can learn to live without my Soul but never my Heart.” He kissed her then, hard and needy, she poured ever feeling of need, ever feeling of wanted to be wanted, loved and cherished into her kiss. She wanted him to know how much she loved, needed, and wanted him. She moved to straddle him on the love seat, he grabbed her hips with his large, strong hands and pulled her closer to him bringing their torsos flush to one another. All she could do was hold onto him around the neck and if her life depended on it. His hands snaked under her t-shirt caressing her back and sides.
“There is nothing I wouldn’t do for you and Sam. Dean, you are my family but there is something I have never told you. Dean I love you…,” before Cas could continue Dean burst in, “Cas I love you too, your my family, my…” Cas then held up a hand and Dean stopped from continue to talk. “Dean,” the angel replied, “I didn’t even truly realize how deeply I felt for you until I lost my old body. It is more than just familial love I feel for you, I am completely and utterly in love with you. You are part of me, and I know that you could never feel the same way about…” Before Cas could finish the sentence Dean was on his feet and standing in front of Cas. He dropped to his knees to the floor and grabbed Cas by the shoulders putting his torso between Cas’s knees and pressed himself flush to their body and pulled the angel into a kiss.
About one hour latter Dean was scrambling eggs, baking biscuits (Ash had taught him how) and cooking fresh country sausage that he made himself from fresh ground pork ( another thing ash had taught him). God, he loved that sweet, smart, sexy woman. In the middle of his musings, he heard Ash scream “Cas, Cas, OH MY GOD, Castiel, where are you?” Dean took off in a dead run down the hall and her start screaming his name, “Dean, he is gone, oh my GOD he’s gone, Dean, DEAN!!!!” Dean then hears Sam and Eileen come running out of their room and throwing Dean, Ash and Cas’s door open. He is there just a second behind.
Ash spoke up to stop Dean from storming out the front door of the War Room. “Dean Wait, I am sorry I laughed. Please stop, don’t leave, we really need to talk about this.” Ash really did not want him running off, she felt for this beautiful, broken man. Cas had shown her all his memories of the man he loved. Because that was what was between them, a deep and profound love, that neither had ever really spoken about in those terms. She tried to put all that love, desperation and heartfelt concern into her voice as she called for Dean.
Ashby began to cry, her face and lip hurt now and she was not about to let Cas heal her right now, she was too upset. As the tears began to flow in earnest, Dean opened the Impala’s door and jumped out. He ran around to her door and threw it open, she knew what was coming; he was going to throw her out of the car. She unbuckled the seat belt and with great sobs of remorse and loss she grabbed her small duffle bag, she stood up and went to step past Dean, but he was there like a wall in front of her, arms braced one on each side of the door. He was staring at her with such intensity it hurt her to look at him but she did, she met his gaze and tried not to flinch. He grabbed her by the arms and crushed her in a kiss that was hot, needy, and full of electricity but tinged with desperation.
The fact of the matter was when Cas left he left a huge frickin’ hole in Ash and his lives. They still weren’t even close to good but it was better. The nightmares that came now were mostly about Cas. He was strung up on a cross being tortured by demons or having his grace sucked out of him by another angel or rotting away in some heavenly jail. They were bloody and in them Cas always died screaming his and Ash’s names with his last breath.  He missed his Soul but as the weeks dragged on he was more and more certain that something big had happened but he didn’t know what.
Dean began to feel himself float away, this was normal for the process and he was used to it by now. When he come back to himself he was in the cabin standing by a big four poster California King sized bed. “Well, that’s new.” Dean thought. Usually the room was smaller with a full sized bed taking up most of the room. Setting on the bed cross-legged in his boxer shorts was Cas. Dean looked down and noticed all he had on was his favorite pair of black boxer briefs. So Dean flopped down on the bed and scooched closer to Cas. “Hey, there angel, My God I have missed your face, well especially those lips of yours!” Dean whispered.
This happy rhythm went on for several minutes before Dean was the first to pull away. He looked at the person before him and wondered why he had never done this before, No turning back now. “Cas, I love you too, you are my home, I am your home and I have loved you from the moment you pulled me outta Hell. I just never let myself think about how much until I lost you this time around. It about killed me to see your body burn on that pyre and I thought that was it, I would never get a chance to tell you, to show you how I felt. Then you called and Sam and I tracked you down, to see if it really was you, and the moment I laid eyes on this vessel, on you and Ash, I knew it was you. I was just scared and afraid of losing you again. You know I am not good with emotions.” Dean explained.
“Speaking of angels, there he is, Good morning Cas.” Sam said. Dean turned around and stood up so quickly that Sam was worried that he might lose his balance and land flat on his face. As soon he had his feet under him Dean was right beside the individual who was the center of his universe now. “Morning Gorgeous!” Dean greeted and them took this curvy being in his arms and kissed them for all it was worth, so much so it made Sam a little uneasy after a good minute. “My little brother here seems to think you’re Cas, take another look Sam, it’s Ash.” Dean was right of course, is was Ash but the stern look on Ash’s face had reminded him so much of Cas that he assumed that is who it was.
To this day if you know where to go in Lebanon, Kansas there is a bunker full of hunters, who have saved the world several times over. They are all there because of Dean, Castiel and Ashby Winchester fell in love and changed the world. We all could be happy with such a legacy.
They flew through the War Room and down the hall to Dean’s room. When they were in the room Dean shut the door hastily behind him. He turned around and there she was, cheeks flushed, eyes sparkling with need and love, lips reddened from the hungry kisses that they had been sharing and she was all his, no all his and Cas’s. Even though Cas was not in control of the body he shared with Ash, he was there, Dean could feel him but Dean wanted to focus on Ash at the moment. He once again stepped up and took her in his arms. Her body was radiating heat and he could tell that whe wanted him as much as he wanted her. He once again slide his hands under her t-shirt, this time not only caressing her soft curves but pulling the whole thing up and over her head.
Well, she was 42 now and way too old to get pregnant, in fact the last time she had went to the gynecologist before Cas had found her they said was close to menopause. Also there was the fact that she was not able to have children again after chemo when she was 29. It sterilized her, she no longer created viable eggs. Alan and she had went through a long painful process of trying to get pregnant again only to have the Doctors tell them it was absolutely not a possibility without IVF and a donor egg, maybe not even then.
You see, one of the reasons I prayed to anyone listening was I had lost my family. My Momma, my Husband, my only child, my Son and almost everyone I ever loved to that durn virus that swept through the United States and Canada last year. “So Cas gives you control at times?” Sam asked. “Yes, most the time I am happy to let him take charge but at work it is me who runs the show. I mean can you imagine him in a Memory care unit, he would be sapping his grace plumb out every day trying to heal EVERYBODY! I mean, I know he means well but he taxes himself too much. I’m sure you boys know what I’m talking about.” Ash replied. Sam just simply nodded his head up and down in agreement.
Dean thought about is for a second and replied, “Yes, yes I do, I didn’t think anything of it at the time but now that you mention it, wow, is she a Telepath, did you know this beforehand?” Cas shrugged, “I knew she was an Empath when I first heard her pray to me but I had no Idea how strong she was. I am afraid if she uses those powers too much it will burn her soul out quicker. I’m not even sure if she is totally aware of what she is doing, I really haven’t brought it up.
As Cas approached the Impala with hands out in front, level with his waist, palms up showing Sam and Dean that he held no weapons and meant no harm. As Cas came closer to the car he saw the faces of his family for the first time in months. They both looked the same really, Sam tall with dark hair that he kept longer, Dean with his shorter military style cut, both of them staring hard at the figure approaching there car. The one surprise is that Sam is in the driver’s seat, Dean riding “shotgun”, which almost never happens, at least not in a long time.
I am still losing time, I know it! I can only set back and wait for someone to call for me, for someone to be desperate enough to call out to the unknown. I am beginning to give up hope, will I be floating through the ether forever? Sam and Dean could be old men by now for all I know. Jack, he must have forgotten about me by now. I know they are alive because I would know if one or all of them had met their final end. If that were the case I would just ask for entrance into their heaven, I think it would be granted. I have to hold on to the memories and pray that someone will call soon. I must not lose hope!
Dean felt himself getting even harder, although five minutes ago he would not have thought that was even possible. Ash moved to touch Dean, to stroke him, and said, “Lay down my Hunter.” He obliged. Ash pulled Dean’s boxer brief off and tossed them out of her way. She climbed up to straddle herself over him, lining herself up to plunge herself down on his length. This sent a wave of pleasure run up and down Dean’s spine, her warm, tight, wetness wrapping around him and when she began to move her hips to roll against him, he began to pant.  It felt so good, safe and warm. Love and need all wrapped up in one slick, silky movement.
The next morning, Dean awoke to Ash and Cas’s side of the bed being empty. He got up threw on some sweat pants and a shirt and padded down the hall to the bathroom and then the kitchen. Cas and Ash, Sam and Eileen sat in the kitchen eating cereal and drinking coffee. Dean managed to make himself grumble out “Mornin’ everybody.” There were various levels of enthusiasm in the replies. Ash had just finished her frosted shredded wheat and asked Dean what he would like for breakfast. Dean really didn’t care, he was too busy thinking about what the rest of the day would be like but he knew he needed to eat. “Ha,” he thought to himself, “you know it’s gonna be good if it distracts ME from Ash’s cooking.” She was staring at him waiting for a response but he could tell by the twinkle in her eye that she had heard his thoughts. “Damn inconvenient being in love with a telepath, couldn’t even freak out in his head privately.”  That thought made him inwardly chuckle.
Pastor Gideon spoke once more, “Now it is time for more of the formalities, please Ash repeat after me,” Ash repeated, “I Ashby Renee Schmitt do take this man Dean Winchester and this Angel Castiel to be my lawfully wedded spouses, to have and to hold, for richer, or poorer, in sickness and in health, to cherish and adore, to honor and support, both now and for all time and eternity.” The pastor then had Castiel, then Dean repeated the same litany. Except for Dean, of course who had to throw a few sexies, dudes and babies in there for good measure.
Dean had a nightmare, this was nothing new; Dean’s dreams were often filled with nightmares and blood, a reflection of the life he had lived since he was young. Waking up in a panic, covered in sweat and ready for battle was nothing new either but now he had Ash’s calming, loving presence to sooth him. She snuggled close all night long, every night and Dean wouldn’t have it any other way. When the nightmares did come she would hold him that much tighter and run her hand over his hair and back until the panic subsided. She had asked him about counseling, but he knew they would just think he was crazy and he didn’t like shrinks at all. However, since asking Ash and Cas to marry him and then finding out he was going to be a Daddy he had been seriously thinking about finding some help. Ash said she was looking for someone familiar with the life because she knew she needed it. Especially since Cas left them, flat on their asses, gripping to keep it together, clawing to tread water. Dean still longed for Cas, still missed him terribly but he was pissed as well.
Once outside in the parking lot, Ash is shaking her hand. She then says, “Cas says it’s not broken just bruised with some strained tendons, but dang that hurt.” Dean had her in his arms kissing her before she knew what was happening. He broke of the kiss, “Wow, Ash that was one hell of a punch! My baby don’t that shit off of nobody.” Sam and Eileen were now out in the parking lot coming up to the Impala. “Hey guys, did you get a load of your sister in law Sam? She told that loud mouth in there who was boss, didn’t ya Ash?” Ash just looked at him with a baffled look. Sam replied, “Real mature there Dean!” “What? It was awesome, I’m in love with one sexy, badass lady and a friggin Angel! How could it be any better?!” Dean replied. Eileen just shook her head at Dean and signed, “You do realize Dean that you just proposed to Ash and Cas in the middle of a bar fight?”
