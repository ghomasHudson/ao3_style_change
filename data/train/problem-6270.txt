He sighs, long and dramatic and too close to the microphone. It crackles in my ear. “Because we’re going skating tonight, obviously. Come on, doll, keep up.”
Steve yawns again, lifting my whole upper body with his heaving chest. I think he tries to say something through it. He ends up trailing off. I let the silence linger for a while, listening instead to his rhythmic heartbeat.
“It’s a mom-and-pop type establishment,” I say, as we pull up alongside Antones. “Not exactly the fanciest—” At this, he makes a tutting sound, “—but it’s one of my favorite restaurants in the city. It’s been around since I was a kid. So, you know, a really long time.”
It’s been a few days since I’ve heard from him. I’m trying to not freak out, to practice patience…which translates to taking out my worries on a punching bag rather than pacing a hole in my apartment floor. My fist isn’t hitting hard enough today, though. Distractions have a way of seeping through.
I look down at my skates, which have started to drift inwards. When I try to straighten them, I stumble again.
The log comes to a halt, frozen on a wavelength I can reach out and run my fingers through. Steve's words are still ringing in my ears, heavy with raw emotions I can barely begin to unravel. Even in the silence, it feels like he's in the room with me.
“It’s an incredibly important position, Tony,” Sam spits back. “I kind of figured the guy with the armor wouldn’t mind a little action, but I guess I was wrong?”
“It also wasn’t a question, Tony. I’ve put up with your little vacation for as long as I could afford to, but it’s time to suit up and step back up to the plate. I expect to see you at the airport within the next two hours,” Fury says. “Oh, and make sure to pack some T-shirts, you’re going to California.”
I hand him the bouquet, and he just frowns, sets them down on his bedside table, and reaches up to take me by the lapels. He pulls me down into a sloppy kiss. "I was grabbing for
He complies and I hand him a screwdriver, which he inspects as if he’s never seen one before. “Huh.”
Steve glances at the speakers, located in strategic areas around the room—the top of the cabinets, nestled into the bookshelf, on the shelf next to my potted fern. He seems moderately impressed. “F.R.I.D.A.Y, can you play
“Buck. Great to see you.” And it really is, though it’s difficult to mask my surprise. I didn’t expect Bucky to get an invite, all things considered, but I suppose Tony is just full of surprises these days.
I wonder if he’s mad at me under that smile. I wonder if he knows how much he means to me. I wonder if he knows just how utterly terrifying this all is.
All the opportunities I had to say no, all the excuses I could have given, flash in my head. I could’ve said I was busy, that I wasn’t feeling too good, hell, I could say that right now. I could tell him I have a stomachache and we have to go home, that I’m really sorry…
He’s not in the living room when I bust through the front door. Or the kitchen. Someone says something to me, but I don’t stop to hear it; I pick my way through the throng of well-meaning friends and jog downstairs, into the basement.
He puts a hand on my shoulder and creates some space between us. "It's late," he says. "I should probably..."
I slipped into bed next to Steve about an hour ago, mostly to quell his worries. He's snoring softly, even though he claims he doesn't ever snore, and his limp forearm is flopped around the small of my waist. It's almost cute enough to convince me to stay in bed, just to watch the pillowcase flutter under his breath until I can't help but fall into my own fitful sleep.
Tony downs a shot and slams the empty glass down on the bar so forcefully that I’m worried it might shatter. Thankfully, Tony’s glassware seems about as thick as the brick wall he’s built between the two of us. “F.R.I.D.A.Y, pour me another round,” he says, words thick and slurred, and waves his hand dismissively when his AI begins to warn him against getting more blasted than he already is. “No, no, don’t get up. I’ll pour it myself. Want somethin’? Whiskey, brandy? I have a nice Chardonnay if you’re a wine guy….”
He helps haul me to to my feet, and I thread my arm through the crook of his elbow for extra support. The ice looks bumpy. Intimidating. Uninviting at best.
"Yeah..." he says, his voice taking on a wistful tone. He drifts into a moment of contemplation. I don't know if I should shake him out of it. Eventually, he matches my gaze once with pointed clarity. "You know, Steve, I had...another thought."
Steve sets the magazine down on the coffee table along with his cup—god, I want some coffee— and stands up to face me. He’s sporting some pretty serious eye-bags and pursed lips that refuse to give away their genuine expression. “I’m here because I needed to talk to you while you’re sober,” he says. “And I’m not about to let you ignore me for another three months.” He gestures to a pile of folded linens. “I slept on your couch.”
She chooses a flick that I’ve never seen before, and when it’s over, I still don’t feel like I’ve watched it. I just stare past the screen and feel grateful that at least I don’t have to pretend to remember what we were talking about anymore.
in sharpie. I stare at it for a moment. The handwriting is familiar, but I don’t let myself jump to conclusions. At least, not until I get inside, slice it open with my fingernail and come face-to-face with a gaudy Iron Man themed birthday card. I flip it open. Tony’s scrawled a note: “You’re cordially invited to a kick-butt Christmas/housewarming party on the 20th. Be there, be square. Oh wait, that’s not a threat to you, is it? Hah. Anyway, you better be there, a-hole. Party starts at 6PM. Presents not required, but I wouldn’t complain…. ;)”
I glance at Tony, who seems frozen in shock, eyes wide and panicked, hands balling into fists. I turn back to Sam and lay on my best fake smile. “We couldn’t sleep, so we were just strategizing about tomorrow. Right Tony?”
The whole building is shaking, now. Crumbling. Spitting out large chunks of sheetrock and letting loose light fixtures, which crash to the ground below. If I get out of this alive, I'm telling Steve—
“Right,” I parrot. “No, yeah, Grandpa needs his beauty rest. Wouldn’t want to keep you up past…” I check my watch, “10pm.”
It's some ungodly hour in the morning when our plane finally touches down on familiar, snow-frosted territory. Steve chauffeurs me back to my place, with the very unconvincing intention of dropping me off, getting me settled, and taking his car the rest of the way to his apartment. I stand in the doorway and wait for him to process the indisputable fact that he's not leaving my house tonight.
My pity-party is rudely interrupted by a glass of something bubbly being shoved into my face. “I couldn’t get you a Margarita, but I got the next-best thing: ginger ale, and two bags of peanuts,” Scott says, as he spills most of the soda on my pants. I jump and make an inhuman noise, something between a squeal and a grunt.
“Panic. Hysteria. A healthy dose of depression,” I say. Steve doesn’t seem amused by this. As he shouldn’t, I suppose; it’s only partially untrue. “Look, I needed to get away for a bit. Figure shit out. Is that good enough for you?”
Maybe it's creepy. I like to think of it as an auditory diary, a way to categorize and compartmentalize my life. A way to feel a person's presence, to analyze their speech patterns, to remember them when I can't be there. Creepy or not, it comes in handy on nights like this, when my brain is on a treadmill and my boyfriend's on REM.
I’m trying to listen to what he’s saying. I really am. The problem is, his voice is competing with a million other thoughts already taking up residence in my head. I attempt to sneak glances at Steve, who’s sitting across the aisle next to Natasha, but that involves leaning around Scott— who decided to plant himself right next to me— and he’s trying to figure out what I’m looking at. So I sigh, settle back in my chair, and force myself to focus.
Most of the night goes better than I had previously expected, though I can’t say I know what I expected at all. A date with Tony stark was just a big question mark until this moment, up until he sat himself in front of me. Until he shot his straw-wrapper at me. Until we made small talk that quickly broke down into a rapid-fire game of true or false to see who knew the other better. (I won, though he was a worthy adversary. I managed to trip him up when it came to childhood pets. I did not, in fact, have a hamster named “Stuffy”.)
Tony makes a move to correct me, but seems to change his mind. He folds his menu and stacks it on top of mine and gives the waitress one of those tight-lipped smiles, the kind you only give when you’re being polite. He squints at me when she leaves. “Rogers, you’re lucky I was gonna order that anyway.”
I lower my brows at him. Unconvinced. He offers a stiff smile that does little to persuade me, then reaches over and turns the music back up again.
I bring up Steve's folder. Hundreds of logs of various lengths pop up. I lean back in my chair and let it roll away from my desk, clasping my hands behind my head. "FRIDAY, be a doll and shuffle all, won't you?"
I nestle my face into his neck. He smells like hotel soap still, something woody and fresh, and I can feel a tiny bit of stubble growing in on the underside of his chin. I wrap my arm around his bare chest and he, in turn, pulls me tighter, before his muscles relax around me once more. He's fading into sleep, I can tell. His whole body is relaxing. His breathing is regulating. It tickles the top of my head.
I tell myself that it's okay. That I'd seen the end before, already stared it down and accepted it. I could do it again. I have to do it again. This is how it ends, for real this time, and I just have to lie here and wait for the inevitable. I should be a pro at this by now. But I'm not.
I start to respond, but he continues before I can get a word out. "I know, I know, it's...mushy. I just.. It's more than just dates, it's more than just sleeping together. It always has been, but...I don't know. You give me something to care about beyond myself, and there are times when I feel like I really need that, you know? God, I'm bad at this..."
When I open my front door, the last person I expect to see is Steve “Captain America” Rogers. Well, maybe not last, but the odds are pretty damn low. His broad frame fills my doorway, and his dimpled smile fills my chest with warmth and dread. It’s a harsh reminder of why I haven’t reached out in months.
“You’re coming over to my apartment next Friday. 8PM. We’re going to go out to dinner. No binge-drinking, just us, just honest conversation. Agreed?”
I storm the catwalk, metal on metal reverberating throughout the corridor. My vision is clouded with images of Thanos's army, of all the people I wasn't able to save— it's like all my worst memories are fighting to take the helm of my downward spiral. Everything is congealing into a single, constant sense of existential dread, and my adrenaline is far too high to stop. I'm a tank without a driver. Or, maybe, a tank driver going through a manic episode. Neither is preferable.
Sam points into the woods. "We're walking the rest of the way. I've routed a path that should avoid any tripwires. You all know your positions, right?" He waits for our nods and one-word confirmations, before turning and beckoning for us to follow. "Good. Lets move out."
He turns to look at me, and his surprised expression melts into a smile. "Well, well, well. Look who it is. The one and only Captain America, in my hospital room...tell me, did I sign up for the make-a-wish foundation? Is this a subtle way of telling me I'm gonna die after all?"
He smiles. It's weak, but there's a renewed spark in his eyes. "Is that even a question?" I match his smile, however fleeting. We don't have time for sentimentality. "This is going to hurt. Bad. Can you take off your armor?"
After the events of Civil War, Wanda and Vision go off the grid, and find new hope in the form of a garden.
“Right now? Yes, it would. Steve, I have enough to worry about here. I don’t need to add extra anxiety to my plate just for the sake of telling the Avengers that we slept together,” I say, only realizing the sharpness of my words after they fall from my mouth.
Sam shakes his head and turns to Natasha. “Nat, once Scott gives the all-clear, you’re going to sneak into the control room through this window—” he points again, “And download their schematics.”
Oh god, I’m an idiot. I’m an idiot, and I haven’t done laundry in so long, and what am I supposed to wear to a date with an ex-rival, anyway? Business casual? I don’t do business-casual. All my shit is either business, or casual. What is he gonna wear? He didn’t even tell me where we’re going, and when I texted him about it, all he said was “you’ll see”. You’ll see?! Unbelievable. The audacity…
“You can skip the formalities, Stark. You’re needed back in the field. We’re on the verge of busting a new Hydra facility, and I need you to be there.”
"Whatever the hell I want to, I suppose." He runs his fingers in small lines up and down my back. "Move in or not...I hope you'll be there for that. Whatever it is."
I hang up and set down my phone. God, my heart rate has only increased, I don’t know why I thought that’d be a good—My phone is ringing. It’s the National Anthem. Shit.
I laugh and plant a couple kisses in quick succession—first on his lips, and then a couple on his cheek and neck for good measure. He hums and rakes his blunt fingernails through my hair, which is something he's taken a liking to doing lately. He likes that it's grown out a bit in the last few months, and seems personally offended if I mention my need for a trim.
I laugh slightly. Maybe I’m bad at reading sarcasm, or maybe I’m just bad at reading Tony, but I still can’t quite tell when he’s kidding.
Peter's eyes are wide as saucers as he steps into my living room. Well, stumbles; the floor is strewn with cardboard boxes that Steve has been pressuring me to unpack, and it's created a maze of sorts by the elevator. I'm waiting until he gets fed up enough to do it himself, which works up until I have to entertain guests. Though Pete's soaking up the room like it might as well be a museum, so I suppose he doesn't mind the clutter.
“Tony…” Rustling sheets, a click. He sounds slightly clearer the next time he speaks. “Are you okay?”
I extricate myself from his grasp as carefully as I can manage, put a pillow in my place, and tiptoe to my workshop. I know the path well, even in the dark. I don't turn on the overhead light, just a small one by my desk, and pull up a holographic screen. "Voice logs," I say.
Steve's phone buzzes, and he glances at the notification. "Sam says he wants to get everyone together tonight for drinks before we leave."
I consider Steve for a long moment, and then turn back to my desk, raising my hand to dismiss the program. It would be easy enough, just a quick flick of the wrist and they'd be neatly filed away, my little secret until it comes time to draft my will.
I shake my head and pull him into a lingering kiss, deep and insistent. I wish I could express the way he makes me feel. The way he sets my insides ablaze every time he threatens to rip me further from everything I've ever known or thought to be true.
“Wow, that’s great. Sounds like you all have this whole…thing…under control,” Tony says, setting down his glass and splashing his drink onto the tablecloth. “I guess you won’t need the rest of us, huh?”
She laughs. "Well, in any case, I'm throwing my support in the ring. You two are like family to me, of course I'm going to have your back. Like family should. Congratulations, boys."
I lock eyes with Steve, who has raised an eyebrow with unspoken but mutually understood curiosity. "I'm hanging up the suit for a while." I hold up a hand as the rest of them start preparing their protests. "Not just because of the leg situation. And I don't know for how long, so don't ask. Any further questions, or should we clink glasses and move along with our night?"
He launches into some rambling story that I immediately tune out of. I take a seat in an empty row opposite Rhodey and look out the window, eventually pretending to take a nap so I don’t have to see the judgment on my friends faces. I don’t sleep, as expected.
“I’m sorry I brought it up,” Nat says. “But I’m serious, if I need to tuck-and-roll, you guys gotta give me a fair warning.”
I’ve been thinking a lot about being upfront with Steve, and it sounds great in theory, but I’ve also been thinking about just how drunk I’d need to be to make that happen, and how big of a chore that would be, and how it’s actually not so great in theory after all.
I'm staring past all of them. My short-lived relief has already worn off. Come on, Tony. There's movement inside the building, I can see it— a figure stumbling through the smoke. I'm the first to the door, and just manage to catch a limp Scott Lang as he falls to his knees in front of me. One of his arms is drenched in blood, spouting from a sizable gash in his shoulder, and his complexion is paler than a ghost. I open my mouth. Nothing comes out. In an instant, the others are by my side.
I engage my thrusters and rocket towards the catwalk. Behind me, I can hear the rest of the machinery starting to explode one-by-one, as if on cue, releasing shock waves that threaten to throw me off course—which isn't hard. I'm already unbalanced by the extra cargo clinging to my side. All I can do is grip Scott tightly and hope we don't hit the ceiling, or hope the ceiling doesn't hit us.
I jolt. To my surprise, Steve actually is in the room with me— bleary-eyed and all, wearing only his pajama bottoms, leaning against the doorjamb for support. Mo is perched on his shoulders, and she uses his arm as a springboard to hop onto my table, mewing at me like she's equally confused as to why I'm not in bed. Indignant, even.
“I don’t know!” he says, nearly shouting. “I don’t know, okay? I was expecting you to say that it didn’t mean anything, or it was just a one-night…thing. Tony, I was prepared to never talk to you again if it came to that. Jesus. I didn’t think you’d actually be honest with me.”
“Don’t go outside without your coat, silly, you’re gonna catch a cold,” Tony says, patting my cheek with his metal hand. And then he ducks back into the house.
I sit on a stiff leather couch and eye the stack of magazines in front of me, none of which would pacify my nerves, and await the nurse's return. My leg is bouncing, fueled by numerous cups of shitty coffee. To say it's been a long day would be the understatement of the century. The ticking clock in the corner is eager to remind me just how many hours I've been waiting to see him again, and my urge to refill my cup with
“I’m not sure if ‘fine’ is the right word to use, but sure,” I say under my breath, regretting it as soon as the words pass my lips; exhaustion has started eating away at my ability to censor myself. I know they both heard it, too. Even the slightest whisper would be impossible to miss in such palpable silence.
“No, you don’t strike me as a wine guy…scotch it is, then. Great idea.” He pours himself a scotch on the rocks— most of it gets on the counter—and tops off my half-empty glass from earlier.
It was late when I recorded it, not quite as late as it is right now but late enough that Steve's voice was husky. Sultry. Slow and deliberate. Late enough that thoughts poured out more easily, coaxed with a few cups of wine.
I use the back of my chair to push myself upright and clink a metal finger against my glass, suddenly facing a a quiet room full of friends with color in their cheeks, studying me with varying levels of amusement and interest. No turning back now. I plaster on a grin and hope it helps mask the nerves that alcohol has only partially smoothed out. "Friends, colleagues, fellow Avengers. I have an announcement to make, and I'm gonna need your undivided attention. But...god, that's a lot of eyes. If a few of you could like, look over there—"
Scott turns around in his seat and raises the half-empty glass of ginger ale. “Tony, do you want to finish this?”
But since the final snap, since Tony nearly tore himself apart from the inside out for the sake of humanity, since I realized the intention behind his actions…the colors seem blurrier than before.
It's a relief to finally pull over, though the bad energy follows me like a cloud. Steve won't look at me. I pretend that I don't want to look at him, either, but there's not much else to see; we've stopped in the middle of nowhere with only trees and assorted wildlife to keep us company.
He stands up and sidles out of the aisle, disappearing behind the back curtain. I sink deeper still into my chair and try to stop my legs from shaking. We’re in for a long flight, and I can’t imagine myself sleeping, so I’m gonna have to get used to it. Or, at least, pretend that I’m used to it.
I give him a look, as does Sam. Tony’s leaning back in his chair, nearly far enough to tip over, and is nursing a margarita he ordered from room service. Sam clears his throat.
The ride to the airport is quiet and tense. The air feels thick with apprehension, hard to breathe and compressing me from all angles; I squeeze the steering wheel until my knuckles start turning white. Steve’s sitting beside me, one of my extra backpacks at his feet, full of a borrowed clothes and some toiletries we bought at the dollar store. He didn’t have time to run home, given that his apartment is nearly an hour away, so we’re…making the best of it. I tried to give him clothes that I haven’t worn in a long time, so it’s less obvious, but none of them really fit him and there’s only so much a Coney-Island tee from 2011 can do.
I can hear muffled commotion from either side of the building, intermingling with the blaring alarm, which doesn't help to orient me. I know Sam's in the east wing, but my head is too scrambled for that to mean anything. All I have now is left or right. I choose right. I suppose it's up to fate if I've chosen correctly.
“I saw it light up when you went up against Thanos. When you laid everything down—your body, your life— for the good of everyone else. I realized that I was wrong. You are crazy, Tony…”
Wannabe cuts off mid-sentence, and there’s a pause before the familiar sound of strumming guitar fills the speakers.
"Be careful, Steve," Sam adds, resting his hand on my other shoulder. Worry has etched deep lines into his forehead. "Bring him back."
My head was already reeling a moment ago, and now it’s spinning out. Images of the party last night, of Steve’s face so close to mine, the kiss, the blurry aftermath… it all flashes in my mind and refuses to solidify. What happened after the kiss?
Tony dips down and starts flying almost vertically in the other direction, then swoops back up again before hitting the treetops. A shout escapes my lips, followed by dazed laughter.
"Jeez, easy tiger," he says breathlessly, while I'm sucking on his collarbone. "And here I was having a whole speech planned and everything."
He rolls over to me. I have to say, I kind of enjoy watching America’s favorite poster-boy scooting his way across my floor. He folds his arms across my work table and peers at my organized chaos with that indifferent yet slightly disapproving expression of his, and asks,  “What’cha need?”
“Basement, with Nat and Rhodes.” He points to the back of the room. “It’s the door on the other side of the staircase.” He grabs my arm before I go, and I turn to face him again. “I gotta warn you, though, he’s in a…strange mood tonight.”
“Scott, when you’re done disabling security, I’ll need you to plant a bomb in their assembly room.” He uses his finger to circle a portion of the map. “That should be around here somewhere. Once we have the schematics, we’re blowing this place to kingdom come.”
It's darker than pitch in here, and the air is thick with smoke that pours from an unknown source. It's hot, suffocating, disorienting, and I'm immediately thrown into a coughing fit. It doesn't matter. None of this matters anymore. I cover my mouth with the crook of my arm and run, shield raised above my head, trusting blind faith that the ground, or my legs, don't give out beneath me.
And now there's something in my life that comes first, and I'm leaving them, for what? Because I wanted to prove something?
I wonder if he can tell that my pulse just quickened, or that my cheeks have taken on a touch of color at the blunt sincerity in his words. “Consider myself checked,” I say. “I’m fine, Cap. This civilian’s not in danger, you can take the night off.”
My kisses start traveling away from his lips, onto his chin, his nose, the underside of his jaw, his temple. He laughs and wraps his arms around the small of my waist, tugging me down to lie on top of him. I graze my lips over his neck, his adams apple, the slope of his shoulder, his earlobe. I want to trace all the hills and valleys of his form with my mouth. I want to memorize him with my lips.
My phone rings while I’m blotting the sweat from my forehead. I check the caller ID—Tony’s face stares back at me, that blurry selfie he took when he put his contact in. “Hello?”
I stare at the space he used to occupy, draw my jacket tighter around my body, and heave a sigh of defeat. “Tony, wait!”
"Slow going," Natasha replies. "It's not even a quarter of the way downloaded. You're gonna have to buy me more time."
I don’t wait for an answer, instead pushing past him and heading for my workshop. I don’t know what I’m doing, but Steve’s trailing behind me, so I guess I have to commit.
“I could,” I say, partially under my breath, but I can tell by the slight tilt of his head that Steve caught it. He seems contemplative, like he’s weighing his options. Or perhaps doubting my sincerity.
The moon is almost full overhead, filling the valley I’ve nestled myself into with a wash of blue light. I can see nearly everything, though there’s not much to see beyond miles and miles of snow-frosted trees and the dirt road that leads to my house. I follow that road until it branches onto the main drag, and then keep going. Past more trees, towards the mountain.
S: Un-ratable. He was a super fluffy, some kind of German Shepherd mix. I swear he winked at me, Tony.
She wheels me into the waiting area, at which point Steve pops up from the couch and melts my heart with one of his...heart melting...smiles. I dunno, my brain too sludgy from my extended bed-riddance to think of anything more poetic. He's poetry in motion, anyway, so it's hard to improve on that.
“Shit, right. Uh…we’ll just tell them you were in the area and we’re carpooling to save gas money, or whatever,” I say, turning the volume back up.
The inside of Antones lives up to expectations as well. Warm, close quarters, filled with circular tables and booths upholstered with cracked red leather. I request a booth in the back, and the hostess leads us through a pair of double-doors into a smaller, darker room that’s lit mostly with candles and string lights wound around the ceiling beams.
I break into a smile and grab him by the lapels of his fancy jacket, pulling him into a kiss much different than our first. This time I’m ready for it, and Tony seems almost unsure, though his lips quickly soften to match mine. When I back off, his mouth chases after me, brushing my chin in the process. He keeps his eyes closed for an extra second.
Tony’s air of cool indifference melts into wide-eyed disbelief. “What, really? Wait, wait, wait— You’re telling me you’ve had this favorite-restaurant-since-the-fucking-forties card stowed away in your back pocket this whole time and I’m the one you decide to use it on?”
"Are you ready?" Steve says under his breath. He's standing by my side, nearly shoulder-to-shoulder, still not meeting my eyes. Tense. Shield forward. A soldier, ready to fight.
Tony considers our hands for a long moment before his attention drifts to the sweets menu. “That’s pretty gay. Wanna order dessert?”
"Are you really not gonna be Iron Man anymore?" he blurts, immediately shrinking back from the bluntness of his own words. His face flushes. "Sorry, Mr. Stark. I just...I find it hard to believe."
Steve stands and makes his way over to my other side, wrapping an arm around my waist. Partially, I'm sure, because I've begun to wobble, though the gentle squeeze tells me it's also more than that. It's an acknowledgment. Our own personal celebration.
I reach over and set my open hand on the table, leaving it there until he hesitantly lays his own hand on top of mine. I give his a squeeze. “I want you, Tony. Can you accept that?”
He hovers just out of reach. “I’m taking off your training wheels,” he says. “Push with the sides of your skates. You can also shuffle if that’s easier for you.”
The ceiling is failing, dropping large chunks of rubble that hit my shield with surprising force. I just let it rain. There is nothing in my head but the will to keep moving. To find him.
Silence. I let it simmer for a moment before bursting out laughing. “Sorry, sorry…she’s only activated by my voice. Hold on. F.R.I.D.A.Y? Play
I turn on the radio to a 90’s-to-now station and crank it, just to have something else to focus on besides the road ahead of me, Steve’s intense stare, and the doubts in my head. Steve lets a few songs play out without protest  before turning the volume down a couple notches. “They’re gonna ask us why we’re showing up together.”
My breathing is labored, my knees feel like jelly, my lower back is screaming is pain. The only plus side to a laser wound is the instant cauterization, but man does it hurt like a bitch.
The pond in question is a reasonable size, hemmed in by a tightly-knit forest, and it looks like someone already came before us and shoveled it off. Possibly Tony. I wonder if he thought that far ahead.
I brandish my shield and jam it between the pillar and rubble that has avalanched around his leg, and push down with all my might. The pillar raises an inch before falling back down, hard. Tony yelps.
“Falcon’s already on site,” Nick Fury explains from a projection at the front of the cabin. “He’s been monitoring suspicious activity for the past week— they’re transporting large shipments of unknown materials back and forth to a high-security facility, we’re talking off the grid, incredibly secretive. We have reason to believe they’re manufacturing weaponry there, but I can’t speak for what kind of weaponry, so be on your guard.”
When I wake up again, I’m immediately disoriented by the blinding light filtering through my curtains. How long have I been asleep? I sit up, wipe some drool of my chin…it’s almost noon, so far too long. Jesus Christ. I grab my phone to check my notifications, and falter as soon as I unlock it; I’m still on a call. With Steve. A call that apparently has lasted seven hours. I unplug my phone—it’s hot to the touch— and put it to my ear. I can hear some activity on the other end but can’t discern it. “Steve?”
I lay my head back and close my eyes. I can feel the ache in my temples worsening, knock-knock-knocking on my skull, building pressure with no way to release it. Rhodey nudges my arm after a moment. I open one eye.
“I’m fine, just—I’m fine.” I dart back to the bathrooms, where I immediately fall to the floor in a desperate attempt to ground myself. I stay kneeling until my breathing starts to regulate again, and my vision starts clearing up, and the room is no longer spinning around me. I pull myself to my feet and flush the toilet. Wash the dirt off my hands, splash water on my face. Pat myself dry. Talk myself down.
"Yes sir." He scrambles to perch on the stool across from me. His backpack is heavy enough to throw him off balance, so he swings it around to cradle it in his lap.
After I’m done scrubbing my skin pink, and after I’ve dried off, slicked back my hair…all that’s left to do is stare at myself in the mirror and have second thoughts.
I can see the gears turning in their heads, struggling to put a puzzle together without all the pieces.
Lang was already admitted, thanks to Rhodes, and got a couple stitches in his shoulder. They wrapped him up real nice, prescribed him some painkillers and some serious down-time. Sam took him back to the hotel— which we've been forced to extend our stay at— leaving me, Natasha, and Rhodes to wait for the all-clear to visit Tony. Of course they need to make sure he's stable before we can go see him, but my anxiety spikes with each passing minute.
I wish I could bundle up this moment and keep it in my pocket. Steve's eyes shining like the reflections on the ocean, soft music wafting on the breeze from someone else's speakers, junk food dripping grease between us...none of this would come out in a photograph, but it's worthy of a frame.
When I’m all clipped in, I wrap my arms around his neck and grab hold of his armor, where the chest plate is slightly raised. I’m hanging from his back like a monkey, and I’m having some serious second thoughts about this whole thing, particularly the part where I put my life into the hands of an over-tired Tony.
Vision glances to the plant in question, and his blonde eyebrows furrow. He reaches out to graze the wilting leaves, one of which falls into his palm. "Basil. I gave it too much water. The poor thing can hardly breathe." He holds the leaf up towards the sunlight spilling through the foliage—the sun has been our only visitor for months—and studies the back-lit veins.
Scott stares at me, and I recognize the emotions flashing over his face. Pure and utter hopelessness. A desire to help. The ability to do nothing. Slowly, he nods, turns, and staggers down the corridor towards the left entrance.
I mean, honestly, what am I doing? I was fine alone. You know, relatively. Sort of. Okay, not at all, but that’s neither here nor there. Am I even ready to get into another relationship? Especially with someone like Steve, with the kind of history we have? What happens if we fall in love, get married, then one day get divorced because of a spat over who lost the remote? We’re just two prideful assholes that think that their way is the right way, no exceptions.
The building rumbles again, a tremor coursing from the depths of their facility. They must be planning to sink the whole place, get rid of all the evidence; including me.
“Going on? There’s nothing going on,” Tony says, spitting out the words so fast he trips over most of them.
"You don't have the emotional range, honey, I'm sorry. You and I both know it would have sounded like a eulogy."
“I’m sick of beating around the bush. What changed since I came over? What did you mean that night, right before I left?”
Blame is a slippery slope, and one that I’m more apt to fall down while sitting through an endless flight. Maybe I shouldn’t have said anything.
I can’t help but remember the feeling of Tony’s warm breath on my neck as he gave me instructions, standing so close that his body brushed against mine. All those little looks, those little comments. Words I used to believe to be empty, but that night, felt so loaded.
“I can’t figure you out, Tony. I really can’t,” he says. “I can never tell when you’re flirting, or just egging me on, or when kisses actually mean something to you, because it certainly meant something to me. Meanwhile, you were drunk to the point of standing on the bar screaming Brittany Spears songs.”
“I see how it is.” He picks up his own menu and sets it upright on the table, so all I can see are his eyes over the top. “You think you can out-flirt me. That’s blasphemy, you know.”
Steve sits up straighter in his seat and turns to look out of the window. “Okay. That’s settled, then.”
Steve wraps his arms around my waist. Immediately, I feel warmth spreading through my cheeks; I turn away so he won’t notice, and he leans his chin on my shoulder. He starts swaying. “Do you like to dance, Tony?”
Steve hands me a pair of crutches, which I'm eager to accept. Even hobbling feels so freeing. He hovers by my side and lends a hand for support when I need it, and I pretend that I don't until I get to the stairs. Then I'm appreciative of his chivalry.
I wake up to the sound of rustling sheets beside me. “Tony?” I murmur. If he heard me, he doesn’t make it known. The door creaks open, spilling dull light into the room, and I catch a glimpse of his silhouette stumbling out before I’m left in darkness once again.
He keeps talking. I stop fighting it and close my eyes, letting his words drift through my subconscious until I, too, drift off and find myself dreaming of criminally boring errands, narrated by the one and only Steve Rogers.
"I dunno, Rhodes. I think that's asking a bit much of me," Steve says through a smirk mostly aimed at me.
“I’m good.” He eyes my arm, or at least the place my arm should be. I’m only sporting the shoulder piece to my prosthetic. “Is…are you…”
“You’re not a charity case. I checked in on you because I care about you, not the other way around. And are we ignoring the fact that
“Yeah…” he says, and it seems kind of sheepish. “I wanted to make sure you were okay. You were pretty shaken last night.”
Without warning, Tony releases me— regardless of my shouts— and glides away from my grasp. I’m left spinning my arms like a pinwheel in a last-ditch effort to stay upright. “Tony!! What the hell?”
The drive there is mostly devoid of conversation; I don’t think either of us have the right words to say. There are so many things we’ve swept under the rug for so long, that peeling it back is anxiety-inducing. Tony fills the void with 80’s rock blasted over the radio. He knows the words to most of the songs. I sneak glances at him every now and then, looking away when he tries to catch my eye.
I feel like I’m coasting on clouds until the moment when he puts down his fork, staring down at his partially eaten food with furrowed brows. I can almost see the gears whirring in his head.
“Is there anything I can do?” I ask, shuffling across the floor to his side and resting a hand on his arm.
I find a human-sized Scott lying on the ground of the equipment room, surrounded by charred fragments of what must must have been some heavy machinery, now little more than an imprint in the tiles. Blood pools from his shoulder. His eyes are closed. He's unresponsive.
He had rolled to safety, and is now watching me with eyes the size of saucers, grasping his blood-soaked shoulder with an equally blood-soaked hand. "I...I don't know. Maybe? But I won't just leave you like—"
I open the door slowly and peek my head inside. Tony's lying in bed, staring at the TV and flipping listlessly through the channels, seemingly more interested in the white noise generated by all the half-second snippets than actually finding something to watch. I open the door further. "Tony."
I stumble to my feet. The room pitches. I feel drunk. No...no, being drunk would be better than this.
I heave a sigh and, clinging to Tony for balance, drag my left foot underneath me. It sets me into panicked motion once again, struggling to keep both of them in line. They want to go backwards or forwards independent of each other, leaving me to shuffle in place. Tony squeezes my arm tighter.
“Tony. You’ve been avoiding me all night, and you’ve drank so much you can barely stand. I think it’s time to stop avoiding this conversation.”
Sam meets my eyes, and the moment of recognition is mutual. "Maybe we're not stalling them... they were stalling us. God fucking damn it. Steve, update, now."
I return to the cabin with as much poise as I can muster. Rhodey is sitting alone a couple seats back, and I take the opportunity to slide in next to him. He glances at the dark spot on my pants and raises an eyebrow. “Rough flight already?”
I wipe my hand on my knee and start rocking slightly. Breathe in, breathe out. Calm down. This isn’t new. Panic attacks aren’t new. But I can’t let this happen. Not here, not now. My vision is blurring. Hands clenching, shaking. Breathe in, breathe out—
Sam snores gently in the bed next to mine, and I haven’t heard a peep from Natasha in the adjacent room. The only sign of activity in our suite belongs to me, driven by my inability to sleep, and my only companion up until this point has been the ticking clock on the wall.
"Okay, picture this: two of your coworkers have a rivalry so strong they nearly throttle each other on multiple occasions, but then they realize they're actually not so different, or rather, they're not different in an incompatible sort of way. Now, imagine now that these two start dating, and they really really care about each other. A lot," I say. "Are you imagining it?"
I don’t want to work right now, though. I’m squinting against the glare of my phone, and my finger is hovering over the call button, and I don’t even remember pulling up his contact but I’m not about to give myself time to over-think it. The phone rings three times before he answers.
I brush off the log next to me— resigning myself to my regrets and a damp ass— and sit down. I try to put on the skates as quickly as I can despite my shaking fingers.
I brace myself against the counter and stare into the mirror. A tired man stares back at me. My eye bags give my emotional baggage a run for its money.
I’ve lived my life based on predictability and singular goals. Enlist in the war. Make a difference. I suppose that second one hasn’t changed much, though I suppose I hadn’t counted on it the impact it’d have on my own life. I’ve always been a constant of my own right, turning my nose up at Tony’s unpredictability, instability, his rash decisions. He exists in the gray area, and myself in the black and white.
His eyes widen like a child that’s just been given the green light to gorge himself on Halloween candy. He turns back around in his seat and I can hear passionate crinkling, followed by Scott tipping the whole bag into his mouth like a shot.
No response. I slap his cheek gently, to the same result, and then once more, not so gently. He spasms into consciousness and lets out a shout. "Wh—what's—"
“For the first time? Very. Like, right now? Not at all. Though I probably still have morning breath, so I don’t know how much of a pleasant experience that would be for you.”
I rocket out of the trees, weaving between their fresh barrage of beams, and send a couple of my own in retaliation. The middle gun explodes on impact. Satisfying.
Tony splashes his feet idly. “You know, Cap, I was thinking…we’re at a hotel, why not make the best of it? We’ll get our own room, single bed, and pretend it’s an accident. You know, forget all the other stuff.”
The entrance hall bleeds into a large living room, a kitchen, and a stairway to the second floor. It’s a rustic house, built from sturdy oak beams, and Tony’s populated it with his minimalist furniture. There’s a good amount of people here already, filling out the space. There’s Bruce, now idly mingling in the kitchen with Scott and Doctor Strange, who’s practicing witchcraft to refill his drink. There’s Wanda and T’challa, sitting on the stairs, engaged in idle conversation. Sam and Bucky sit across from each other on the couch, and they wave when I enter. I gravitate towards them. They both stand up to greet me.
A flash of blue fills my visor. I've barely registered it before I'm spiraling out of position, knocked aside by a sudden force on my right shoulder.
He considers me for a long moment. Something has changed in his expression, and I can't pinpoint it; he seems absorbed in his thoughts. I tilt my head at him. "Something on your mind, Tones?"
I shift my weight from foot to foot, visually contemplating the sequence of bad decisions I’m about to make. I invite Steve to step inside with a flick of my head and, to my surprise, he accepts. I close the door after him. “Can I get you a drink?”
I sit up and pry the guards off, tossing them in the snow next to Tony’s. My blades shine against the glare of the lantern. They’re taunting me, reminding me how real this is. I consider sitting here for the rest of the night; I mean, the seat of my pants is already wet, I might as well be Tony’s cheerleader from the sidelines. That doesn’t sound so bad.
The stairs to his workshop creak underfoot. A sliver of light shines from beneath the door, so I suppose my suspicions are confirmed. I knock. “Tony?” I say, a bit louder this time. “Are you in here?”
He tries to pass me the backpack filled with borrowed items and dollar-store toiletries, and I just push it back into his hands. "Keep em. You can huff my gym shorts if you get lonely."
"I'm...Roof, I'm on the roof," I pant. I brace myself on my knees. "They have energy beams. Big guns, lasers. The kind that cuts through your suit like butter."
“It was a surprise to get the invitation, huh?” Bruce says. “Ol’ Tony’s been pretty quiet these last few months. I was beginning to think I’d never see the place.”
I take a deep breath, smooth out the napkin in my lap. “Okay. Look. I don’t know how to explain it, but…you’ve got this… drive. This spark. I overlooked it for a long time.”
"Been worse." Natasha brandishes an SD card. "And just barely. I'd prefer not to cut it so close next time."
"Oh, it's nothing. I was just thinking about how vast this tower is, and how tiny your apartment is..."
It's the face I see when I close my eyes, it's the singular person overriding every thought, taking up residence in my heart.
"Please, I'm not gonna give you the luxury of missing me. I'm moving back into Avenger Tower. Effective...soon, I don't know. Forgive me for not smoothing out the details, I just came up with it on the spot. Impressive, no?"
Walking through empty hotel hallways in the middle of the night is one of life’s most surreal experiences. The carpet is a dizzying pattern of colorful swirls and shapes contrasted horribly by a gray backdrop, and all the doors look exactly the same. Despite the relatively simple layout, I feel as though I could get lost in here for days and come out a changed man.
I'm chuckling to myself until the next log comes on, and the smile immediately drops from my face. It's a segment of a conversation I have nearly memorized, now. One that I've gone back to on multiple occasions, and that leaves me with the most to think about.
This isn't the fight I care about. What I wouldn't give to take him aside, lay it all on the line, apologize and hear him say it back—instead, I'm left with unanswered questions and no time for answers. Do you still see a future in me?
“It’s a screwdriver, Cap. If you think I’m gonna trust you with my ‘fancy’ stuff, I’m taking you to the hospital for head trauma,” I reply, and then gesture to my hand that’s sitting on the table. “There’s a plate on the base of my wrist that I need you to unscrew. I’d do it myself, but I’m working with…minimal assets, here.” I do a singular jazz hand.
Hospital staff try so hard to distract you from the fact that other people have been sick in the same bed as you. They scrub all the surfaces until they sparkle, only to achieve an overwhelming stench of cleaning products, yet this room still isn't my own. The walls are too bare, and there's never anything good on daytime television. Steve's visits help, but they're monitored and limited, and the staff keep saying things like 'you need to rest'. If I never nap again, it'd be too soon.
The likeliness of getting back to sleep now is slim to none, and closer to none— given that I haven’t been able to swing it, yet. I usually use these rude awakenings as an excuse to get up early and start working, with the knowledge that I’ll probably fall asleep at my work station sometime in the afternoon, regardless of how much coffee I force into my system.
S: It was my fault, though. It was my decision to take the plane down, the cryogenics were an accidental side effect.
“Alright.” He starts recounting his day with agonizing—and appreciated— detail. Woke up at 6, hit the gym, got lunch at that deli,
I don't have time to admire my handiwork before I'm jumped from behind. My attacker wraps their arms around my neck and squeezes with all their might, and all I can do is engage my thrusters, sending both of us rocketing backwards. I try to ignore the ungodly
The concept of keeping up with this conversation has long since been out of the question. “Is this a prank call? Are you gonna ask if my refrigerator’s running next?”
I reach around him to point at the screws, and he dutifully gets to work. It doesn’t take him long. He manages to pop open the panel, revealing an intricate system of wires, sensors, and a couple override buttons. “What now?”
Over the years, Tony has recorded a multitude of voice logs as a way to preserve memories of the people closest to him.  One sleepless night, he decides to listen to a few of Steve's.
“They’re getting worse,” he says. It’s quiet, but I catch it. “I don’t think there’s anything anyone can do for me.”
My heart pitches. I scream his name, and he shifts slightly, awarding me a brief moment of respite. Very brief. I hug the wall and make my way over to him as fast as I dare, obliging the catwalk's wishes by pausing every time the metal groans underfoot. I drop to my knees once I'm close enough to reach out and take his face in my hands. He's not wearing his helmet, so I run my fingers over his cheeks, kiss his forehead, stroke his hair. "I'm getting you out of here."
“Maybe,” Rhodey says. “But I don’t think that’s all there is to it. Last time Tony was like this, he was actually— like, literally— dying.”
The screen changes, and I'm presented with a series of virtual folders, each labeled with the name of someone close to me, and my favorite picture of the subject. Not necessarily the most flattering picture, but my favorite. They're sorted in order of closeness, proximity, amount of logs, and though there's a wide variety, each folder has one thing in common: they're all recorded and logged from my glasses, and no one—and I mean no one—is allowed to know about them.
We both whip around to face Sam, standing in the doorway, looking like he just crawled out of a zombie apocalypse. His eyes are nearly glued shut, and he’s leaning against the doorframe to keep himself from falling down.
He whips around to face me, stumbling over his own feet and catching himself on the counter in the process. Tipsy like a first-time drunk. “Cap! You’re, ah, still here. Good, good. Goooood,” he says, drawing out the last word as if he doesn’t know what it means.
someone else. Someone that’s got his arm around Stephen Strange’s shoulders, and is nursing a cocktail like his life depends on having a drink in hand at any given moment.
I snuggle closer into him and close my own eyes, allowing a good-nights-sleep to claim a second victim.
He opens his mouth to say something else, seems to think better of it, and plants himself in my high-backed office chair. I turn back to my work, but can’t focus. His eyes are boring a hole into the back of my skull. Sitting with that damn perfect posture, a hand on each knee, index fingers tapping with restless energy. I put down my tools. “What? There’s a staring fee, you know.”
Natasha takes the first stab at a conversation. “So, are you guys at each others throats again, or what? Because if you’re gonna get into argument and crash the car, I’ll need a heads up.”
And then he hangs up. I stare at my phone for an extra moment, trying to process what just happened. And then, slowly, it dawns on me; if I wanted to experience the spontaneity of Tony Stark, I suppose I’ve bought myself front row seats.
Tony sends me a text that contains only a water-droplet emoji. I stare at it, and consider responding with a few question marks, and then I consider not replying at all; it’s far too late to open this can of worms.
Tony lets the words settle before reaching out with a shaky hand. I accept it and bring his fingers up to my lips, finally meeting his gaze as I kiss his knuckles. Tear stains leave shimmering channels down his cheeks. He takes in a hiccuping breath. "You're a noble man. I always loved that about you, you know. But sometimes you're too noble for your own good."
He studies me for an uncomfortably long moment. His eyes bore a hole through my skull, like he’s trying to peer inside and see for himself whether I’m telling the truth. “You’re a lot of things, Tony,” he says. “But you’re certainly more than Iron Man.”
I think, now, it's time to appreciate the universe's decision to keep me in it. And the people around me that helped make that happen. The man who saw a future in me, too.
The speakers spring to life to the sound of the Spice Girls enthusiastically telling me what they want (what they really really want). I knock some extra sauce off my spoon and hike up my grip on the handle, scream-singing into it like a microphone—and also like my life depended on this performance. Steve continues to sit still as a statue, though the corners of his mouth are starting to twitch into a smirk.
"I had time to think about it. And I came to a...realization...while I was contemplating my certain doom. Something I probably should've realized a long time ago."
I accept it and take off the lid to find a brand-new pair of figure skates, bright white, staring back at me. I raise an eyebrow at him. “You, uh…didn’t need to buy these, you know. We could’ve gone to a rental place, or something...”
still alive," I say, sidling into the room fully and closing the door behind me. I pull out the flowers from behind my back—an array of red and yellow roses—and he makes a grabbing motion.
"Can you build another one?" I ask. My voice is trembling worse than the facility. My whole body is trembling.
“Is this an interrogation? I dunno, it just felt like time to jump back into the saddle, or whatever. Nick Fury is very persuasive,” I say. My pulse is pounding, now, matching the insistent rhythm of my headache. Fuck.
"No one could have expected it," I continue, "But, uh...unexpected things happen all the time, and it's not always bad. Sometimes things happen, and it's confusing at first, but in the end you decide that you still love and support your friend and don't want to hurt his feelings. So you reserve your judgment for when he's turned around and out of earshot. You know?"
He unzips his duffle bag and pulls out a couple lanterns, one of which he nestles in the snow bank and the other which he slides out onto the ice. “For you,” he says, passing me a shoe-box.
That’s a good question. I didn’t really think that far ahead. “I just…I can’t sleep. I kind of need something to take my mind off it.” I pull my blankets back up to my chest. “Uh…tell me what you did yesterday.”
I sit up against the headboard and attempt to collect myself. The darkness is suffocating, so I click on my desk lamp and blink through the harsh yellow light it emits.
I’m rubbing the goosebumps on my arms and considering heading out early, further solidifying Tony’s idea that I don’t like to stay out past 10PM, when the door swings open again behind me. I don’t have time to turn around before somebody wraps my leather jacket around my shoulders.
And then they're all gravitating around us, offering pats on the back and one-armed hugs. Scott gives me and Steve high-fives. Steve's a little over-eager, leaving Scott's palm tomato red.
His voice has an extra touch of warmth in the morning. Low, sweet, a little raspy still, and he speaks so methodically. I sink deeper into my bed and roll over, sandwiching my phone between my cheek and the pillow. I’m not even sure if I’m listening to the words anymore, I’m just listening to him. He could read me a court summons right now and I’d probably say thank you.
“How much have you had to drink, Cap? I think it’s time to cut you off.” Before I can stop him, Tony grabs my drink off the counter and drains it all. This sends him into another wheezing fit. He thumps his chest a couple times.
Tony stands with the grace of a trained dancer and steps onto the ice, skating out a few feet before spinning around to face me. “What’s the hold-up, Cap?”
Somehow it's still surreal. Especially when it finally comes time to start moving things into the tower; Happy's been managing it in Tony's absence, so it looks largely the same as it did last time I saw it, though I can't say I ever felt more welcome than I do now as I'm helping my boyfriend rearrange his furniture.
“Here’s what we know so far,” he says. He points to a doorway labeled with a red X. “This is the loading area, where most of their shipments come in. Big palettes covered in tarps, padlocked boxes, the whole shebang. The place is always guarded, and the interior is crawling with operatives. They monitor everything that comes in and out.”
It's a long walk. None of us offer to break the silence, not even Scott—and my apprehensions are only solidified when we crest the hill. The facility is a massive brick of a building. Flat, expansive and rectangular, built mostly of steel with very few openings beyond a couple tiny inlaid windows. Most of the traffic seems localized on opposite sides of the building, where operatives are coming and going in single-file lines. It's a bottleneck, tough to get into under normal circumstances, and the only element playing into our favor is that of surprise.
I’ve barely fallen asleep when I have to wake up again. It’s still dark out, with only a sliver of light peering over the horizon. Four in the morning has never felt so dismal.
After a while, Natasha seems to pick up my apprehension. She lays a hand on my shoulder, startling me out of my thoughts. “Hey, are you okay?”
Nat frowns into her glass. “We’ve all lost so much. But Tony…I think he’s had the hardest recovery.”
And then that dumbass sticks out his hand. I stare at it, smirk, take it, give it a firm shake. “It’s a date, Cap.”
“Cap! You son of a bitch, you made it! Come, come, let me make you a drink,” he shouts, ushering me over.
I can see Rhodey controlling the flow of guards, who have started flooding out the door like homeless ants. Steve is making quick work of anyone that gets through Rhodey's fire— He already has one on the ground, and another knocked backwards with a shield to the chest. My breath hitches. Steve fights like a deadly ballerina, hyper focused and graceful, allowing nothing to deter him from his goal. And god, his ass looks so good in those pants.
“Don’t worry, it happens every time I tell someone about my daily routine. I guess I’m just that boring.”
The table erupts again. Rhodey cradles his forehead in his hands. "If you keep dropping bombs like this, Tony, I'm gonna need you to buy a round of Aspirin instead."
I knock on his door at 6:30. Normally I’d be on time or early, but this is one party I don’t want to be the first guest to; the whole thing has got me on edge.
It's like a switch. Suddenly, he's considering me in a different light. "Me too." A silence passes, and he fills it with a deep sigh. "You know, Steve...it's not the first time I was faced with death."
“Wow. You’re one of those people who take “make yourself at home” way too literally, huh?” I say.  I shake my head and instantly regret it. “Alright. Spill. Talk. But I’m getting coffee first.”
"Of course, this leaves me with some extra time on my hands," I continue. "I was thinking...it might not hurt to impart some of my endless wisdom on the...next generation."
I shoot him a glare with enough fire behind it to melt this whole damned pond. He counters it with a wink.
I reach down and cradle his cheek in my hand. I trace my fingers over his soft and delicately wrinkled skin, savoring the warmth at my fingertips. "Tony—"
Youthful impatience...can't say I've never experienced it before. I clear my throat and straighten in my seat. "As you should. Because that's not exactly the case. This— " I gesture from my head to my toes, "Is Iron Man. Not this." At that, I tap the arc reactor on my chest. "I'm just...taking a break. Hanging up the suit for a while. That's all."
It jolts me out of my thoughts so abruptly that for a moment all I can do is stare at him. My mouth twitches into a smile that I attempt to hide by turning back to the road; a futile effort. I know he saw it. I can see his own smile in my periphery.
It takes me a minute to get my bearings again. I’m drenched in sweat, my blankets are halfway off the bed and tangled around my legs, and I’m gulping in air like I just ran a marathon. Every muscle in my body is tensed and ready for action. There are no actions left to take.
I falter. Everything I considered saying to Tony once we finally talked again has fallen out of my head, replaced with a single question: “Ice skates?”
I don’t have a visual on Tony, but he’s the only thing clouding up my brain— I’m torn between worrying if he’s okay, and replaying his words over and over…
“I mean, calling them ‘blasters’ is a little diminutive, don’t you think?” It’s equipped with fully functional heat-seeking lasers, a pulsar ray, and a few other tricks I’d rather keep hidden up my metal sleeve, mostly because Steve would give me a whole spiel about “safety” and “regulations”. Yawn.
“Not so fast,” Sam says. “Rhodes, Steve, Tony—you’ll be running distraction, same as myself. I need you to get in, split up, and cause as much ruckus as you can while keeping them away from Natasha and Scott.”
I comply, wiping my feet on the welcome mat that definitely wasn’t there last week. It looks like something a wine mom would buy— if only for the fact that it says “wine mom” on it.
"Noted. Now get your ass down here, there's a swarm of them—" He cuts off, followed by the sound of grunting, the clank of metal against metal.
I rip off my shirt and tie it tightly around the wound. He groans, but doesn't protest. I drape one of his arms around my shoulder and scoop him up, pressing him tightly against my body. I run fast as I dare. We're no longer afforded the luxury of tiptoeing, and the catwalk makes its protests known, finally collapsing behind us as I clear the threshold. The pillar hits the ground with a resounding crash. I don't stop to look back.
The nurse comes to fetch us after what feels like eons. "He's ready for you. Are you all coming back?"
“Oh, yeah, I feel ya there, bud,” Scott says through a mouthful of Peanuts. “I got this sushi the other day…”
For a moment, I consider calling him, asking him to meet me somewhere, talk, spew all my problems onto a willing ear. Just a moment, though.
He flies upward for what feels like ages before I feel him turning forward, leveling off. He slows down a bit, just enough that I can open my eyes again and squint against the wind. When I look down, I can’t help but utter a “Wow.”
I imagine him standing there, wherever he is right now, holding the phone to his ear and expectantly waiting for me to say something else. Maybe getting ready to say goodbye and run a few hundred laps. I want him to be standing in front of me, I want to reach out and feel the forms of his face, his sharp jaw and soft cheeks…
My skull feels like it's caving in more than the snapped bones and crushed tendons in my leg. My vision is clouding. My breathing is irregular. I know why. It's not the pain.
It’s Nat’s turn to arch an eyebrow. I heave a sigh and settle back into my seat. None of us say anything for the rest of the drive.
I let out a loud bark of laughter despite myself. “Really? I lay my heart on my sleeve, just to get a ‘that’s gay’?”
S: They didn't live to see me again. They died thinking that I was lost forever. I know it's counter-intuitive, but...I can't help but feel a bit guilty about that, sometimes.
"We don't need to. I mean it. If you're not comfortable, you know I would never force you." "I know. That's why I came to the decision on my own, while I was being crushed by a concrete pillar. You know, delusions of a dead man, or whatever. I love you, and I want to tell them. If you do, too."
“If I don’t get back into it…If I can’t just, get over this…then I don’t even know who I am anymore.”
He slaloms through the air with the grace of a trained pilot and pulls up to a stop on Mount Heremar. He lands on his feet and kneels down to let me slide off, unclip. My limbs feel like jelly, so it’s all I can do to stop myself from stumbling backwards. Tony extends an arm for balance, which I accept.
There are times when I feel like my rigidity is who I am, at my core. But there are other times when I wonder if it’s who I
I pull up to a stop on top of Mount…I actually don’t remember what it’s called. I’ve been calling it Iron Mountain for quite a while. Small mountain, impressive view. I open my helmet, taking a deep breath of the cutting night air, and release it in a visible cloud. I dust some snow off of a rock and take a seat. There I remain, scanning the valley, the roads, the twinkling lights of the nearest city in the distance, until I can’t feel my face anymore and need to fly home.
He’ll drop me after this mission, I’m sure. Oh, Tony—too bitter, too selfish, too…emotionally stunted. I won’t blame him. I’ll let him go with grace and watch him fall back into his perfect routine, and I’ll be nothing more than a rock in his running shoes.
Time is a cruel yet merciful mistress. She marches on, not caring for your wishes, knowing that it’s all you can do to run after her. Forcing you to mend yourself along the way, to turn your head towards the future. But when I turn my head towards my future, I don’t know what I see. Is it Steve that holds the key? If I look into his eyes, will I see the answers to all my deepest questions staring back at me? Or am I just desperate to fill this void with something other than my own anxieties?
He laughs, and I feel it through the springs of the bed. His hands travel from my hips to wrap around my back, dragging me back onto him. "Sorry, no take-backs."
Taken from me, so prematurely, as we dangled off the precipice of our next big life decisions. If I think about it for too long, I still feel the smoldering hands of anger tearing away at my chest, up my throat, pulling everything inside me taut.
The idea that maybe I just want to see his face again pops up in the back of my mind. I push it down, save it for later. Tony’s been taking up residence in my thoughts for far too long already, I don’t want to give him the satisfaction of knowing he keeps me up at night. I like to think I’m above that.
Rhodey's the first to reinstate some semblance of order, gesturing for everyone to pipe down. He takes a moment to study my face. "You're serious," he says. It almost sounds like a question, but
I know something changed since I checked in on him that night; Something shifted. I can’t help but over-think it.
My stomach turns. I don't have time to think about it. Or anything. I shut my helmet once more, aim down at the smoldering remains of the nearest gun, and blast it until the wreckage falls away in a plume of smoke. I leap through the opening feet-first.
I scan my keycard to get into the pool room, immediately squinting against the fluorescent glare. Tony’s sitting on the ledge, PJ’s rolled up to his knees, feet dangling in the water. He doesn’t look up to greet me. He just keeps staring down at his reflection.
“Nothing,” she says, shoving her barstool back from the counter and standing up. “We enjoy the party and act like everything’s fine, if that’s what Tony needs from us.”
"You can't just drop a bomb like that, man, we need you," Sam says. "Who's gonna fill your shoes when you're gone?"
“On foot, no. That’s where Scott comes in.” He turns to face Lang, who’s watching videos on his phone on low volume. “Scott.”
It’s not long before I’m out of breath and bending over, hands on my knees, questioning all of my life decisions.
He glides back to the shoreline. “You’re not fucking with me? The great Captain America can’t ice skate?”
“I surely don’t.” I pick up my menu and scan it as if I don’t already know what I want. “I recommend either the lasagna or eggplant parm. They also have really good ravioli here.”
I’m struggling just to stay upright. The ice has a mind of its own, and I swear its agenda is to take me down to its level. I wouldn’t be surprised; we have a bit of a rocky history. “I’m not gonna ‘shuffle’.”
I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to fully predict Tony's next move, though I can say with decent certainty that I've gotten better at rolling with the punches. He has a way of keeping me on my toes. (Exhibit A: the signed copy of The Life of Iron Man he gift-wrapped and hand-delivered to me the other day. It's now sitting on my coffee table as promised.)
be. What is it like to live like Tony? To allow a little spontaneity into my routine? What is it like to love him?
I finish assembling my arm and stretch it out, rotating it gently until the shoulder clicks into its proper place. It’ll do for now. I check the time; it’s only been an hour since he left.
“Ah, shit, sorry. But I mean, who’s ever really ready to lose anything, know what I’m saying?” Tony laughs while waving his prosthetic hand. Rhodey and Natasha share a conspiratorial look.
That’s when my phone decides to vibrate itself nearly off the counter. I release Steve and pick it up, glancing at the suspicious lack of caller ID while Steve dusts the flour off of his shirt. “Probably spam,” I say.
I push off with my left and immediately wobble to my right, scrambling to balance on an ankle that’s threatening to give out. I don’t know what to do with my foot once it’s lifted off the ice, so I bring it forward again, but my toe catches and I fall the rest of the way. Tony grabs me by the elbows and my momentum pushes us both backwards.
“That was amazing,” I say breathlessly. “Parachuting out of a plane is one thing, but…whew. I can see why you like that suit so much.”
I can’t for the life of me figure out what changed his mind about having guests over at his new house. Though, I can’t pretend I understand any of Tony’s decisions. That man is an enigma, with a sharp tongue and a penchant for flirting. Plus an ego big enough to fill up one of those suits of his. Sometimes I wonder what he actually sees when he looks at me.
"You bastards," Natasha interjects. "I can't believe you managed to keep this from me for this long. The clues were right there, too—I should've known from the second you two started bickering like a married couple."
I barely have a moment to register the situation before Tony grabs the nape of my neck with his prosthetic, cold metal sending shockwaves down my spine, and mashes his face into mine. It’s not like any kiss I’ve ever experienced before; messy, rough, electric. Fueled by frustration. Sustained by everything we’ve left unspoken until this moment. Tony’s mouth is insistent, and it’s all I can do to lean into it. I place my hands on Tony’s hips and pull him tighter to my body.
I fall in after Rhodey, and I think Steve's behind me. I try to ignore the burning feeling in my stomach, and the tightness in my chest. This is fine.
I hold up my shield and point the jagged edge towards his leg, watching as the confusion drains from his face.
I don’t blame him for not wanting to come out, to tell our friends and colleagues before he’s ready. It’s not that. I just can’t quiet the doubts in my head telling me that from his perspective, we were never going to be anything more than a casual affair. I curse myself for getting so invested.
He doesn't answer right away, instead letting his hands travel from my hair down to my chest and hips, eventually finding their way to the small of my back. He offers a tentative smile. "Is it bad if it is?"
The valley looks so small, yet so vast. Filled with what looks like model trees, and a winding road that looks little more than a squiggly line drawn in the earth. I tighten my grip. “It’s beautiful.”
Tony takes my hands again and starts skating backwards, pulling me with him. “Remember what I said about pushing with the side of your foot. Just go easy. There, see? You’re getting it.”
“Yes, and I hate you for it.” I accept the call. “Tony Stark isn’t available right now, leave a message after the raspberry.
The next hour is a bubbly blur of laughter, conversation, clinking glasses. An unexpected yet appreciated celebration. They have a lot of questions— "So, who initiated it?" "He kissed me first." "Okay, but you were totally coming onto me." "Was I? I can't recall." And the like. They seem genuinely curious how we've been able to make it work. Steve says that it's been surprisingly easy, and I question his use of the word "surprisingly."
"First off, is that an intentional joke? I only have the one shoe and it wouldn't fit any of you assholes, so don't even think about it. And besides, I already told you, it's not about the mission. I just have some... personal battles that I think I'd like to win, first." I turn back to Steve.
The recording comes to an end, and there's a few moments of silence before it cycles to the next one, dated for a couple months later.
"This place is practically a ghost town outside of that control room, Sam," I say. "I guess it's possible there's less of them than we thought."
I open the passenger door and allow Tony to slide in before taking up the drivers seat. “I’m excited, too,” I say, quietly.
I scoot to my left, allowing Steve to take my place. He picks up my hand gingerly and turns it to examine the base.  I lean over his shoulder. “You know, we’re technically holding hands right now.”
He taps the reactor on his chest and the nanites shrink away, leaving Tony in only his shirt and jeans, which are dark with blood. His upper thigh is exposed, just enough to make the cut. I turn back to him. "You'll bleed out."
When the dust settles, I feel Natasha's hands on my shoulders. She's still trying to say something. My ears are ringing.
“…bly good at kissing? Thanks, I know. Been practicing in the mirror for years.” He gestures to his lips. “The trick is to keep ‘em loose, especially when your opponent is stiff as a board.”
"Catwalk," Scott sputters. His voice is faint and weak, topped off with a guttural cough. "Inside. On the...on the..." Another cough, worse than the last. Rhodes and I share a look.
She nods. I pick up my bouquet from the table— it's smaller than I'd like, the best I could do while staying within a close proximity to the hospital— and follow the nurse through a pair of double doors. I hope the two of them don't think it's strange, buying him flowers. I mean, Nat bought him a stuffed bear, and Rhodes got him a semi-sarcastic helium balloon, so maybe it evens out. I don't have the energy to over-think it. The romantic ambiguity of my bouquet feels like an insignificant thing to worry about within the grand scheme of things.
I sink to my knees next to Tony, unable to meet his eyes. My attention is on the remaining half of my shield, little more than a jagged edge now.
I'm daydreaming about assembling the prototype for my new prosthetic when the nurse returns once more, this time with more to offer than aftercare instructions: she comes bearing a wheelchair and a warm smile. "Are you ready, Mr. Stark?"
"It's gonna have to be good enough." Natasha brandishes her pistol and cocks it. "I'm going in. Cover me." She doesn't wait for a response before sliding down the hill towards the side of the facility.
"I'm sorry, Steve." His voice breaks. "I didn't want this to happen. And I— I didn't mean to say the things I said. I'm sorry I couldn't—"
He turns his head a little. I think he's trying to look at me. "That's not for me to decide. But I'm with you, no matter what you choose to do." He yawns mid-sentence and flops a limp hand onto my face. "No matter where you go."
I try to enjoy myself, I really do. I talk to Bucky for what must be over an hour, leaning against the wall near Tony’s potted ficus, fondly recounting tales from our youth. I listen to Bruce monologue about his latest scientific endeavors and nod whenever he pauses. I play beer pong with Natasha, who absolutely decimates me, but I physically can’t get drunk so she says I’m no fun.
“Right. I’ll follow you,” I say, standing and giving Tony a lingering glance over my shoulder. He won’t meet my eyes. I suppose I should stop trying.
It’s not the first time I’ve had this dream, though it’s never exactly the same. Sometimes the events are shuffled around, sometimes it’s Pepper that dissipates in my arms, sometimes I snap, sometimes I don’t.
"Tony, what are you doing? You were supposed to fall in behind me," Sam's voice crackles through my headset.
Steve: Well, there's not much to talk about. We were a small family. Never had much. Never needed much.
I spend most of the night hovering just out of reach, and Tony spends most of the night avoiding me. Dodging eye contact. Mingling with everyone except me. Deflecting any subject matter that borders on serious conversation.
“Not Olive Garden. Trust me, I think you’ll like it,” I say. I offer my elbow, which he accepts hesitantly, threading his arm through mine and hooking them together.
I shake my hand out. The repulsor springs to life. I lift off of the ground slowly, and to my relief, evenly. The energy distribution is perfect.
We end up at the beach on a cheap picnic blanket that crinkles every time we shift our weight, squinting against the setting sun. Steve's fingers are laced with mine. His shoulder is under my temple. "This feels very stereotypical," I say.
"Get Scott," Sam says, pointing towards the door. "Get him the fuck out of here. I'll take Natasha. Steve, Rhodes, clear the area. Get as far away as possible."
I sit up rigidly, hit by the force of his words. “What? No. I like you, Tony. Sorry…I thought that was obvious when I invited you on a date.”
There's a short pause before Steve's warm voice starts dancing out of the speakers. It's a log from about half a year ago, when Steve moved into the tower with me. A text transcription scrolls down the screen line-by-line as he speaks.
I grab him by the shoulder, rough enough to recapture his attention. “I don’t need your book, Tony. I need you to be honest with me. Can you do that?”
Is it getting hard to breathe in here, or is that just me? Can Rhodey hear my heartbeat as clearly as I can? Is it getting hot, or is my palm just sweaty?
He stomps the snow off his shoes. “Thanks, doll, I put gel in my hair for you. You better make it worth it.”
It took a few prototypes for Tony to settle on a design that he's satisfied with—a fleeting sentiment, anyway— and for the swelling to go down enough for him to start constructing a more long-term model. He's nearly done, save a little tightness in the knee joint that puts some extra spring in his step, literally and metaphorically. He revels in the extra mobility regardless.
His hands travel under my shirt, and the cold metal sends shivers up my spine. I rest my forehead against his. "I'll think about it."
I hit a button on the wall and watch my garage door creak open as I step onto my assembly platform, allowing myself to be swaddled in the only constant in my life. I need a test run. I need some air. I need to get a fucking grip.
“Alright, alright.” He exhales slowly and pinches the bridge of his nose, taking a moment to collect himself before he meets my eyes again. “I wanted to check on you.”
He's smiling now. Only slightly, but the twitch at the corners of his mouth tell me that he's holding himself back from beaming. "I think so, sir."
When I’m less worried about falling on my face and getting my fingers run over, I allow myself to focus on Tony. He seems so content, in his element. There’s something softer in his expression that I’ve never seen before. It warms me from the inside out.
He contemplates this for a moment, nodding slowly, scratching his beard. He seems to come to a conclusion, because he extends a hand and says, “I’ll teach you.”
“About what?” Tony pops the cork. It goes flying over Rhodey’s head, who scrambles to cover his face.
“Hey, I also mentioned dessert. Don’t you want to share a milkshake or something? Pretty romantic, if you ask me.”
Scott shuffles out of the way and I stalk past him to the bathroom, shutting the door behind me and leaning against it. I can feel the low thrum of the plane vibrating through my skull. When my brain’s been thoroughly scrambled, and the ginger ale has had time to thoroughly soak through my pants and my briefs, I grab a fistful of paper towels and get to work sponging up the mess. There’s only so much I can do. I’m cursed to have damp jeans for most of the flight, I guess.
Tony reaches over and takes it for himself. He blasts the sharp edge with his repulsars until it's glowing red hot. I think, with some amount of dry wit, that maybe being the only person in the world to weaponize your prosthetic does have its perks.
I take a tentative step forward, placing my right foot on the edge of the ice. It immediately slips out from under me, and Tony has to throw out his other arm across my chest to keep me from falling flat on my face. “Steady, Cap, you got this.”
I smile into his mouth and plant another kiss, warm and oh-so-needed, before pulling away just enough to get a good look at his face. He's got good color again. His face is flushed, his eyes are bright. I lay a hand across his forehead. Temperate.
"Thanks, means a lot. Okay, anyway. Uh. Good. Now that you have a clear mental image, just one quick...minuscule...tweak, nothing major, but—those two beloved friends and coworkers are me and Steve. Me and Steve are a couple. Cheers!" I raise my glass again and down the rest of it in one gulp, while the room erupts into muddled chaos.
It’s about a hour drive to get to the facility, and we’re split into two cars— Sam, Scott, and Rhodes in one, and myself with Tony and Natasha. Tony had tried to insist on flying there in his suit, but the idea was quickly shot down— about as quickly as he would have been. It’s not worth the risk.
He’s still looking at me with that dumbfounded expression. He turns around in his chair and back. “Are you sure you’ve got the right guy? Maybe you know another Tony.”
Fat snowflakes swirl lazily in the air and melt as they hit my skin. The whole yard is swathed in a white blanket, covering everything like a fluffy layer of soundproofing. It looks picturesque. Fake.
As for myself, when I'm not hovering around his station, I fill the time by helping him pack. I learned quickly that out of the two of us, I'm the only one that packs with any semblance of organization, so I took on the role of head supervisor. Helping him cull, organize, fold...and scolding him when he throws a bunch of junk into a box without batting an eye.
