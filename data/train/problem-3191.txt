for Sam, but he really doesn’t need to see it.  When Eileen and Sam pile into the back of the car, Eileen pressed into Sam’s side, Dean takes off for the bunker.
There’s a knock on the door, and Jody grabs her gun before she answers it.  Claire and Kaia pull knives from nowhere, just in case, and everyone falls silent as they wait.  Family or not, they’ll always been
Together.
“A little after 1 AM,” Claire responded before rolling her eyes and huffing, “and I think what you meant to say was
Dean returns the kiss just as hungrily, fingers threading into Cas’s hair.
“Many, many decades,” Cas agreed, moving the bible to his bedside table and burrowing into Dean’s side.
“You didn’t,” Dean asserts, knocking back the shot and pouring another one.  Cas takes a sip of his own drink.  “I’m – you
“Are you telling me,” Crowley interjects, “that my
And then Eileen is there, lopping the head off the vamp.
Dean proposes to Cas in the barn where they first met.  Or, well, next to the barn, because the barn itself is barely standing and is definitely a health hazard and picnics are better under the stars anyway.  He does the whole thing where he gets down on one knee with a ring and a speech.
To grip him tight and raise him from perdition, Dean thinks wryly.
“I love you, Cas.”
“Hey, kid,” Dean greets.  “How’s being God?”
Dean,” Cas says emphatically.  “My grace has been… depleting.  It has been for a while now, but it’s been happening faster since I returned from the Empty.  I do not know if I could have-.”  Dean cuts him off with another rough kiss.
Overwhelmed, Dean pulled Cas into a rough kiss, because he knew his voice would shake far too much if he tried to find some way to reply now.
“I’m not used to the bunker being so loud,” Sam says, his smile soft and fond as he hands one of the bottles to Dean.  Dean chuckles in response before taking a pull from his beer.
Dean thought about it, about
“I’m in,” Dean says, ignoring the way Bobby rolls his eyes.
As he and Sam watch Jack fade into the distance, Dean feels a weight lift from his shoulders.
“Thank you,” he finally managed to say, and his voice only shook a little bit.
Jack lets them know that he’s settling in nicely upstairs – Jack and the angels have long since finished their remodel of Heaven and everyone is together and the two Bobbys are getting along great.  Charlie pales, realizing this means there’s another Charlie upstairs.
Everything is falling into place.  There’s only one person missing from it all – two, if Jack’s refusal to return to the bunker is intended to be permanent (Dean has some strong feelings on that front).  One problem at a time.
Cas is in the library, reading, when Dean finds him and drops both the bottle and the glasses on the table and pulls up a chair next to the angel.
“You can have one,” it offers.  “And then I get to sleep.”
Still, he had promised himself he would remember the nuns, and so he thought about them on his birthday every year.
tshirt, which had led to a moment between them that actually felt like
“Do that.”
Dean realizes he’s… happy to see him.  He squeezes Cas’s arm one more time, reluctant to let go, before stepping past him and pulling Crowley into a hug while Jack moves to hug his dad.
“To the family we built along the way,” Dean replies, holding his bottle out to Sam, who clinks their drinks together.
They track the vampire nest to a dilapidated barn, and one of the vampires ambushes them from behind and grabs Eileen.  His head rolls from his neck a split-second later, the blade of Cas’s machete now stained with blood.
Heaven is quiet, when I am called.
I tell them why I call on them and there is hurt and confusion and anger in their faces. I realize that they have been betrayed too many times, burned too often, for them to see this for the gift that it is meant to be. The choice that it truly is.
Castiel stood silent sentinel in the dark. He didn't have to — Dean was his charge no longer, and he wasn't quite bound by duty. Yet, he was here, standing across a lit window, - quiet, watchful- his wings spread wide, iridescent in the starlight that touched them; his grace seeping into the ground underneath his feet, enveloping those around him in the soft warmth of protection.
Sometimes, freedom meant that you chose the wrong things.
They tell me they are ready, a small smile on each of their faces and I believe them. When I take their hands, they look around at the place that is home, and their eyes water and their smiles widen.
There are questions in their eyes when they look at me. This isn't the Heaven they know.
And I am leaving now, morphing into the thing the universe will make me into for the next turn of the wheel my grandfather set in motion, the wheel that doesn't quite need so much fixing anymore.
Steeling himself, he turned from the man whom he'd called his friend, the man who had given him the gift of freedom, of free will.
In this final story he has written, this is another thing that I fix.
The air in the bunker has a heaviness to it tonight, a somber weight that feels oppressive and stifling. Something that would clog your throat, leaden your arms, cloud your sight.
Despair and fear burned in him, melting into anger. Resentment and pride fuelled his fury. He could see his failure in front of him, a premonition taking shape, but he was too far into the trenches to turn back now.
man, that he had hurt him, that he had been cruel. It shouldn't have mattered that he was leaving him behind, left alone to fend for himself on earth made hell by his hand.
I understand the rules of this universe better than anyone else, not because I am blessed with the knowledge, but because I am a consequence, come to consciousness.
We fix the things that need fixing.
weighs my tongue down, even when I know this is hardly that.
When the brothers look to me, they are young once more in all but the glint of their eyes. They look the way they did on the day of my birth. On the day I was reborn. On the day the universe demanded one last thing from them.
, he thought to himself, as his vessel was beginning to burn at the stake of Leviathan power,
It is a moment longer before the angel's eyes drop from the skies and when he looks, he beams. It has been too long; it has not been long at all. It has been a moment and an eternity, but it is all now the past and it is time to move forward.
So, I look, and I find.
They look like they did when they were heroes in a story they didn't know was being written.
The day Castiel made the choice that would doom him for an eternity, Dean had been raking leaves.
C A S T I E L
It is the scuff of my tennis shoe that startles them, and Dean, almost instinctively, reaches for the gun tucked into the waistband of his worn jeans.
It is not easy, though, to watch. As Dean lifts a steady hand to the angel's cheek, as Castiel leans into the warmth of the hand he has missed for too long. As they draw close enough to share the same breath. As they press their foreheads together, their fingers intertwined. Here is a tear that falls from Dean's eyes, shining like a pearl, and here it slides down Castiel's cheek, like a comet leaving a trail of stardust. And it is like they are one, and they are whole, and it is too much, and not enough. Overwhelming and heartbreaking.
And so I am here when the light from the sun is slanted, and here is Dean, and here is Castiel, and this...this is their ending.
Perhaps he would lose, his worst fear come to life, ripping him from everything and everyone in this world that he had placed his life on the line for.
It is hope.
And that is enough.
And he knows, there will be a moment, when the surface breaks. A moment his lungs will fill with crisp, fresh air, and the world will stop to sway. But until then, he swims, knowing the only way out is through.
It shouldn't have mattered that he had betrayed
It was.....fear. That he'd lose...everything. And everyone.
And on nights that the darkness within reared its head, leaving Dean tangled in his sheets, soaking in cold sweat, screams tearing his throat raw, Castiel felt the horror of it all through him. For him. First, he'd felt it as if it were a thing existing just beyond him, as if all that separated him from that broken, burning world was the thin wall of a motel room. Why he was so attuned to Dean's unguarded mind, he didn't know, but he reasoned it had something to do with the mark he had unwittingly left on Dean's soul as he'd raised him from hell. They were bound now, an inexplicable thread of power too ancient for him to understand tethering his grace to Dean's soul.
“Did you have a nice birthday,” Cas asked once they were comfortable in their bed.
“A normal life, then,” Cas asks, his voice neutral.
“They stay.”
For a while, the hunt itself had blocked the panic Dean had felt earlier from rising to the surface.  Now, though, the nuns were gone and Dean was left with the pulsing in his ears.
“When did you get here,” Dean asked, looking at Claire as his brain struggled to catch up with him.
They talk, and Jess forgives him for not telling her everything – tells him she was never angry in the first place.  She asks about Eileen, and tells him she’s happy for him, and they both cry and she agrees to visit sometimes – she lives in a section of Heaven with her own friends and family.
They kissed languidly for a few minutes, Cas’s hands resting on Dean’s shoulders as Dean’s found Cas’s hips.  When Dean moved to trail kisses along Cas’s jaw and down his neck, Cas tilted his head to grant Dean better access.
“Cas,” he calls out, and Cas turns just in time to be crushed into Dean’s chest.
He flipped open the old bible and saw an inscription in beautifully looped cursive.
It had started out pretty good – he’d woken up to Sammy jumping on his motel bed, and then his dad had taken him shooting.  He never really got to celebrate his birthday, but this was the first one in years his dad was
“Early,” Cas grumbled, burying himself further into Dean’s embrace.  Dean chuckled and nuzzled into Cas’s neck.  “Deeeeeaaaan,” Cas whined, and Dean couldn’t help but laugh at his adorable, grumpy boyfriend.
“I want that, too,” Cas replies quietly.  “I know it will not be… romantic.  I know you do not feel that attraction towards men.”
The four of them work seamlessly after that, eliminating the nest.
“Does he know yet?”
It’s another week before they take a case – the four of them, together.  Sam sits in the back of the Impala with Eileen, and Cas takes the passenger seat, and they head to Akron, Ohio to investigate a case with a father drained of blood, a mother’s tongue ripped out, and two missing children.
“Seven,” Dean replies.
.  She shows up with Adam, which is.  Weird.
He doesn’t follow that train of thought any further, losing himself in Cas’s mouth.
Dean and Cas move to Sioux Falls three months later.  Sam and Eileen come with them to help them move, and Dean and Sam pretend not to get teary at the idea of living so far apart, but Sam and Eileen still take cases sometimes and they’re hesitant to move so far from the bunker.
A year later, Sam and Eileen move two towns over from Sioux Falls.  The contents of the bunker moves first – slowly, in to Dean and Cas’s basement that now doubles as their research library, because Cas and Bobby are managing the hunter network.
“This way,” Jack says, and takes off into the nothingness.  Dean follows him, passing by countless angels and demons, who look at them strangely but say nothing.
“I’m rebuilding Heaven,” Jack replies, looking thoughtful.  “I could use some help?  And I’m sure Rowena wouldn’t mind two more subjects…”
The next day, Dean, Cas, Sam, and Eileen stop by the house to say goodbye before they drive back to Kansas.
He would do the same.
“Best birthday ever,” Dean told him genuinely, pressing a kiss to his lips.
“Thank you,” Dean replied, gaze jumping between Claire and Jack before he glanced down at the spread.  Each tray had coffee, orange juice, bacon, sausages, and pancakes.  Emotion welled in his chest, and he felt Cas squeeze his hand, grounding him.
“Your ankle is hurt,” It was more of a statement than it should be a question, it was evident that it hurt.
"Then why tell me anything in the-"
Once inside Castiel looked around, they found themselves in a large hall, like a parking garage, but completely empty,  the high ceilings causing their footsteps to echo. Before they could try any of the metal doors at the end of the hall, Castiel heard something, and it was coming towards them. Footsteps and muffled voices grew closer with every second, Castiel looked around and Dean was right behind him,
“No, it’s okay,” Dean said. “It’ll heal,” he decided he shouldn’t test his luck any further.
"I assume you’ve heard about the whole negotiation?" Dean got out, glad he actually thought of something to talk about.
The night was running long and Dean was still exhausted. He hadn’t had a good night’s rest in at least a few days, and the previous night posed no exception. He leaned against the door frame of the bedroom, his shoulder against the wood, and stared at the bed pensively. The harder he wished to sleep, without the nightmares, the more confident he was in the fact that it probably wasn’t going to happen, and as tired as he was he really didn’t feel like putting himself through it again. He cursed the fact that he hadn’t brought a bottle of Jack to lull him into a dreamless slumber.
“I just thought I’d let you know, because you saved me and all. The whole an eye for an eye thing,” Dean couldn’t look at the angel as he spoke.
The next day Dean and Sam went to get briefed. It was fast and unceremonious.
“They’re not gonna bite you,” Dean said as the angel had been staring at them for nearly a good minute.
The Roadhouse also functioned as a networking place, where hunters discussed their missions and requested help from others. But it was mostly a place to get drunk and play pool, which was music to the ears of Dean Winchester.
“What does water have to do with your sexuality?”
"I'm not sure I want to, no offense but-"
“One can never be too careful, Sammy,” Dean said.
“I’m making you something to eat,” Castiel answered, now facing the items in the pantry. “I’ve seen it’s a common tradition amongst humans, utilizing food for comfort”
“Castiel, you know our orders. Metatron won’t be patient for long.”
The archangel Michael was surrounded by large stains of blood, both old and new. His head slumped against his chest, curls matted with blood-covered parts of his face.
Realization set in, slowly, like waves licking the sand, one after the other, until the tide covered it up completely. Castiel still saw him as an angel-hating hunter, as someone who saw
He was about to climb carefully over Cas when something caught his attention. Drooped around his neck, falling over the linen of the bed, a silver chain ending in a crystal-like pendant. Dean recalled Cas telling him it was an amulet, that it had something to do with his
Even so, as he woke in the next morning, alone in the cabin, everything seemed so distant again, and he could make Cas smaller, small enough to fit in a little box in the back of his mind. And there, stored away, Dean saw him as a friend - but now, he needed to take Cas out of this little box, and let him stand right in front of him. He needed to ask him questions, he needed answers, and he desperately needed not to feel a damn thing that would get in the way of that.
All things considered, it was the most adequate place to tell Sam he was going to betray his entire city, by freeing their most well-guarded prisoner, oh and that Cas, the guy he had been talking about for months, was an angel. (Maybe not that last part just yet. He couldn’t have Sam having a stroke in the Impala. That would be a terrible first.)
The garage wasn’t much more than two petrol pumps and a small workshop. Sam and Dean walked past the petrol pumps and an old Suzuki-model that looked like it had been there for years.
“Heaven has many prophets and many prophecies, not all of them are sure to pass, most of them actually only predict one of many outcomes. But there is a prophecy that has been passed around for eons, many tries at interpretation have been made, but no one ever actually deciphered what it means.” Castiel tried to recite it from memory: “
Metatron turned to her, his head tilted slightly and an eerie smile spread across his face. “We play,” he paused again, causing a stir of confusion amongst the other angels at the table.
The conversation fizzled out, the three of them with sober expressions - there wasn’t much else to talk about.
Dean knew what was on the other side, or, at least, he thought he did. This was it. This was what he’d been wanting to see for months, but the once hunter-like curiosity was partially clouded by the fact that he knew an angel, well he was actually friends with one, that was still hard to admit even to himself. And this prisoner, captured by his fellow hunters, also happened to be this friend’s leader.
“Exactly,” Gabriel smiled. “Beautiful isn’t it? You’d think daddy really put his time into this one but then he also invented threesomes so who am I to guess.” He looked off into the distance for a second as if he was reliving an old memory. “ Anyway, I’ve been informed that you are under direct orders from Metatron.”
Dean watched as Castiel fumbled with the knobs of the shower until hot water poured out, fogging up the small mirror above the sink. He could feel a slight blush creep onto his cheeks now, normally, he wouldn’t hesitate to undress and just step into the shower, but this was
“Not that there’s anything wrong with that,” Dean backtracked, feeling slightly guilty for making Cas feel embarrassed for the second time today.
“Good to know you’re finally awake,” Sam said.
“Certainly makes my top ten.” Cas huffed out a laugh. The sound echoed into Dean with such ease that he felt a little overwhelmed, he couldn’t help smiling at the sound. Maybe it was the tiredness, pricking away at him, maybe it was the darkness that surrounded them, lit only by the stars, maybe it was the fact that Cas knew how he felt, and was yet to walk away. Or maybe, it was just the nagging thought in the back of his mind, that they wouldn’t make it another twenty-four hours. Whatever it was, Dean was too tired to fight it, to change the subject, to keep his face in check. If his days were counted, what was the point in pretending he wasn’t completely head over heels about Cas?
Cas looked down at their hands, and then his gaze turned back up at him, his mouth opening and closing. It was almost imperceptible, and Dean would have missed it completely had he not been staring at those lips all this time. He waited for Cas to say what he wanted to, he waited until the moment passed and Dean realized he wouldn’t share whatever was on his mind.
“You hunters sure seem to enjoy your barley,” Curt paused in thought. “But yes, why not indulge a little?”
Castiel followed his every move and undoubtedly noticed when Dean tried to play it cool through the pain. But Dean could feel his eyes on him and made extra effort to play it off like it didn’t really hurt.
?  He hadn’t even noticed her walking up to them.
“Gabriel,” Castiel greeted his brother. The wooden floor of a boat churned beneath his feet with the current. That Gabriel always insisted on meeting in remote locations he could understand, but why they had to be so arbitrary he didn’t know.
“Wait, why are you showing me this?” Dean had been so fascinated by the sight in front of him that he hadn’t questioned the reason behind the angel’s little rendition of Outlander.
“It just makes sense, Dean. If we both go a different way, I can lead them elsewhere and you make a good chance to get away from them.” He explained as if Dean didn’t already know that would be the point.
“When are you gonna tell me about you? Or am I just supposed to pretend I don’t know you’ve spent the last week hiding out with your new boyfriend?” Sam raised his eyebrows.
“He has a terrible sense of humor and is actually
The next morning Dean woke up to the sound of his cell phone ringing.
“Jeez Cas, you could at least buy me dinner first,” Dean laughed nervously. What the fuck was up with the nickname?
“Would you allow me to heal you?” Again, Cas’s voice was so soft, so gentle, and Dean wasn’t sure if he would ever get used to it.
and he had to let Cas know
“Dean” He heard Cas mumble his name, but it was barely a whisper. He hurried down the steps, careful not to fall face down. As soon as his eyes adapted to the darkness, he saw it. Cas stood in front of an iron cage, and Gabriel was hanging on the other side, motionless. Dean moved over to stand next to Castiel, staring at the sight in front of them, unable to say anything.
(See the end of the chapter for
He felt the cold air breeze of December hitting the back of his neck, right above where his leather jacket ended. He shivered and decided to pull his collar up, to protect him more from the cold. His eyes darted from the lake, to the trees, startled with every little sound, every time expecting it to be the angel, and every time disappointed when it wasn’t.
“Sam! Dean! Wait up,” a familiar voice called. Dean sighed, he had hoped to avoid this today.
“I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself,” the angel appeared affronted.
“I don’t know Jo, it’s whatever.”
“Yes Dean, she’s not so little anymore, you know.”
“Gabriel has an idea of what the prophecy is about - if Metatron were to be equated to the false God the prophecy claims, that would make Michael’s era as ruler of Heaven what was forgotten, which should rise again,” Castiel spoke slowly and paused to check if Dean was following. He still looked lost in thought, and Castiel was sure it was way ahead of what he was explaining, Dean was far more intelligent than he gave himself credit for.
There was no time, though, to feel any sort of way about his first angel-kill, because more angels were at their throats, and Dean’s face collided right into a fist, that left him seeing black around his peripheral vision. A body was over him, large and heavy, and his lungs felt like they were about to collapse under the weight. His hold on the blade weakened, and he felt the cold, unmistakable feel of a blade against this Adam's apple.
“Of course, my little brother,” Metatron picked a single flower from one of the nearest cherry blossoms.
“You’re right. On the other hand, though, the dude’s aim is to do just that, so what’s the difference?” Sam scratched the back of his neck. It was a nervous tick, he always used to do it when he was anxious as a kid. Well, now would, in fact, be the time to be anxious.
Castiel opened his mouth to disagree.
“I kinda feel bad for her,” Sam said over the loud Metallica song.
“I ain’t taking it back, so y’all can go...” the last part of his sentence was muffled out by a sip of beer.
He hurried to join Dean.
“Interesting,” Metatron raised his eyebrows, as he pulled the blade from the carcass of the angel, cleaning it with a pocket-handkerchief.
“One of my brothers questions the loyalty of our current leader,” Castiel spoke quietly.
“Are they at least hundreds of miles out of reach from the city?”
tried to get away from the demon as quickly as possible while looking around for the flask which he had dropped.
He took a good, long, look at John. He wasn’t looking so great himself. From what Dean had managed to get in, he looked pretty shaken up, his face not looking better than Dean’s, he was breathing pretty heavily, flushed and sweating. If he was as hurt as he looked, Dean could,
Cas didn’t even flinch, steady as a rock. “In case you haven’t noticed, this is a war, Dean. People
. The memory of the morning’s events made him even more flustered. He tried to shake it off. “He’s not my-” but they were gone, and Dean was left standing there, feeling like an idiot, with a sharp and annoying pang behind his ribs, somewhere between hunger and an empty feeling he couldn’t name.
“It’s not safe to stay here,” Castiel said, his eyes never leaving Dean’s face.
He remembered that night, sitting on the sidewalk of some sleazy motel, deciding he needed to see Castiel, just to be sure there was nothing there, nothing but a somewhat weird, secret, friendship between a hunter and an angel. The last time he’d seen Cas, though, at the lake, he felt himself get closer to this being, and at the time it was easy enough to let his guard down, to get closer, and to let himself be
Dean shook his head while he tried to hurry his fingers along the locked cabinet in his dad’s office. He’d waited until everyone had gone home, to sneak in and try to get some of the information he’d told Cas he’d try to find out. High up on his list was understanding what the hell his dad had to do with some angel, followed closely by what the hell had been in those boxes and why they’d taken them out in the middle of the night. It was all extremely shady and there was only one way to find out what was going on.
bath amused Dean.  “Yeah sure you can just take a bath, I won’t take long.”
Bobby didn’t respond, instead, he gave Dean a look that could mean he was either constipated or, and this was the more likely option, it meant ‘we’ll talk later’. Sam stared between them, his mind obviously catching on to the unspoken looks, but he didn’t look caught up on the whole ordeal, so if Bobby did know something, he was yet to share it with Sam.
After a quick breakfast and a short text to Sam, explaining why he wasn’t at training today (he was running a car parts errand for Bobby) Dean made his way to the edge of Welldale.
“I-” Castiel closed his mouth again quickly like he changed his mind midway through talking. “If I were to tell you, there would be certain risks that even I wouldn’t be able to protect you from.”
A waitress made him a sign, wondering if he wanted a refill.
Dean leaned back, giving Cas a little breathing room. He looked at his own hand, wondering if this was a coincidence or if he’d actually done something. He then looked at Cas’s torso, where his own shirt was crumpled against the had-been blood. There was nothing anymore. He let the soaked shirt fall to the floor and stared at Cas, wide-eyed and in disbelief.
to die. And I’ve lived far longer than I can even begin to tell you, so, it might as well be me, if it means doing
Sam was fully dressed to go train. Even though it was freezing cold outside, he was in nothing but training shorts and a t-shirt. Dean knew Sam was right, plus he hadn’t trained in a while, so the idea of spending quality time with his little brother was welcome, even if it was, potentially, getting his ass kicked.
“I’ve been told I don’t have one,” Dead said dryly, but his heart was beating fast, he knew he was in deep shit.
“We’d better ask around for any witnesses when we get there.” Sam tucked his pistol into the back of his belt.
sitting down, busty Asian beauty dancing before him, making him all hot and bothered.
“I figured you probably haven’t tried beer either,” Dean announced, as to explain himself. “And ain’t no time like the present, am I right?”
“We have no
“First off, I was fourteen, and second it was Halloween, it was the perfect crime.”
“That’s exactly what I think,” Bobby said with determination. “It’s been three months since we trapped Michael and they haven’t tried negotiating with us once, now that don’t make a lick of sense if you ask me.”
Sam seemed to be going over the meaning of that in his head, squinting his eyes at the possibilities, but he didn’t ask any more questions. “I’m still coming.”
“Sure,” Dean didn’t feel like arguing with his dad
“Sir?” Uriel asked, uncertainty laced in his voice.
“Dean?” Castiel spoke hesitantly, his eyes still scanning Dean’s face...
The angel stared at the extended hand for a few seconds before shaking it (a little too long). He looked pleased with himself and Dean would call it endearing (
They were both breathing heavily by the time they parted. Cheeks flushed and lips red, glistening in the weak moonlight. Dean refused to let go of Castiel, his hands still laced together at the back of Cas’s shirt. They stood there for a few minutes, giddy smiles plastered on, just breathing the same air, their foreheads pressed together and their eyes closed.
, Dean thought. This plan had been a stupid idea anyway, and that was a massive understatement.
Dean’s legs moved by their own accord, and he was running back to Cas, blade in hand, and there was just a second’s worth of hesitation as he pierced it through the back of the angel that had Cas in a stronghold.
gotten too close, close enough to let the angel manipulate him.
The box wasn’t any old regular prison cell, it was actually a normal room surrounded by four grey walls. There were no windows, no beds or toilets, no metal bars, and only one way in. There was one piece of furniture in the middle of the room, a simple iron chair. It was completely surrounded by hand-painted sigils and heavy iron chains. For years this chair had been empty, unused for the most part, besides a few demons who had only lived to sit in the chair for a few hours. However this time, the iron chair had been occupied by someone for months.
Castiel enjoyed the duskiness of the evening setting in. He had come to notice the shifts in Dean’s disposition that also set in with the dark hours. It was a different side of him, one he was enjoying getting to know, somehow it felt like a side of him he didn’t show many people - of course, Castiel had no real way of knowing that, but he’d settle for the belief. It was softer and more malleable side, the small touches that set Castiel’s skin on fire, that sent surges of power through his veins, were getting more frequent and they lasted longer - he closed his fist, trying to invoke the memory of Dean’s tender touch on his hand, his fingers intertwined with his, a ginger stroke of thumb on the back of his hand, how close they laid, how their breath mixed until they were breathing the same air. He would never forget the hushed conversations they had, the words spoken in the dead of night would forever stay engraved in his mind.
"I think we'll pass," and before any of them could react he thrust the silver blade into the angel's chest with such force that the blade emerged on the other side. For a second, disbelief spread across the angel's face before it turned into an agonizing scream, a blue light emerged from its eyes and mouth before it fell to the ground, scorch marks in the shape of wings surrounding it.
“I was starting to think you’d be a no-show,” Dean grinned, fidgeting with the label on one of the beers with his thumb. His eyes drew to them, remembering they were there “Oh, I brought this for you.”
“It’s not like you tell her much about your stuff either,” Sam teased him “Hell, you don’t tell me much either these days”
If he just managed to fall back asleep somehow Cas would be next to him again. The heat of his body would make Dean’s skin crawl again, aching to reach out, and he would. He’d trace along the lines of Castiel’s body and watch him get little goosebumps where his fingers touched the skin, which was strangely human, but he wasn’t complaining. He would get to watch the way that Cas’s crystal flickered with blue every time it touched his skin and the way it made his eyes appear even bluer and-
“They want us to acknowledge their pain; the apes think that we exist to fulfill their needs, make their miserable little lives meaningful. So we play the part and they will trust us like the blind-”
Sam, on the other hand, was quite the opposite of his older brother. He got outstanding grades in school, and while his training skills weren’t bad, they couldn’t compare to his brother’s. Though that could be explained by the differences in their personalities. Dean had always been more of a take action first kind of guy, while Sam always made sure to estimate the situation they were in and act with more caution.
“Yes, that’s it. And Gabriel has other thoughts on the prophecy.”
For a while, they just stared out of the cabin’s porch, over the forest. Dean’s hand rested on the wooden structure that separated them from falling over a story down. Cas’s left hand was just half an inch away, and Dean just stared. His mind wandered to the night before, just some hours ago, they had slept intertwined, so close, and now the distance between their fingers seemed impossible to close.
“You’re an angel right?” It sounded like a question when it shouldn’t, he gave him no time to answer. “Aren’t you supposed to have you know, wings and whatnot? Isn’t that the whole package deal, fluffy wings, and halos?”
“What?” Castiel asked as he licked a splotch of mayo from the back of his thumb. “Is there something on my face?”
,” Dean shrugged. “And I’m
“What the hell happened?” He wasn’t sure if he meant to Cas, or just now for him to heal. Cas looked back at him, probably unsure as well, as to what Dean meant. “Did you heal?” he added.
As he let the hot water rise in the tub, he thought back to all the times he’d done this kind of thing. It felt so foreign to him, meddling in human affairs - if you could even call a bath a human affair, still it was a very human thing to do. Still, Castiel was never one to refuse to try new things, and when Dean had asked him what else he had never tried, this activity immediately popped to mind.
“Uriel,” Castiel turned around.
“Thank you” She handed him the receipt, her number scribbled in rounded numbers on the bottom. Dean couldn’t help but smirk at the hastily written numbers, behind the waitress’s back -
“I mean if it doesn’t get you in too much trouble.”
“So, are you going to tell me why she’s here?” Dean tried again.
The angel rolled his eyes, but he didn’t try to argue with him. Instead, he sat back against the couch, his body relaxed until Dean’s feet touched his legs with enough pressure for Cas to know he was planning to place his legs there.
A grunt was all the answer he needed. A few more moments passed and Dean was getting impatient. “
to talk to Cas, which seemed to happen more often than Dean would have liked.
“That explains the remote location,” Cas answered dryly.
Once again the garrison of angels had gathered at the round marble table in Heaven. A murmur traveled through the table, some voices raising here and there. Things were a-changing and they all felt it. The air was tense, you could just about cut it with a knife.
“OUT!” Barnes stood up so fast he sent the chair underneath him flying back.
“Great, now I won’t, either,” Dean replied, upset that his brain was so graphic. “What about in the house?”
He could feel his brother's eyes on him, but what could he say? There was no way Dean could explain the way they both got healed without involving the supernatural. And Sam had never bought Dean’s explanation of ‘being there just in time’ in the first place. The worst part of it all was that he didn’t know who he was protecting by keeping the truth to himself, if he was protecting Sam or Castiel.
“Sure,” Jo smirked, knowingly.
“Well, they sure as hell ain’t taking a day off for some jet skiing.” Bobby
All the while Castiel stood staring at him like he was afraid Dean was going to collapse. Dean finally managed to pull himself together, but not without having to wipe away a few tears from his eyes.
And then he almost laughed out loud at the whole thing, hell he’d been played himself.
"Not really," Dean admitted. "Do you think the angels will trade them just anything in return?"
"You should close your eyes," the angel ordered.
We did not come to bribe you with pretty things.” One of the angels took a step forward, tilting his head, his eyes squinting as if trying to understand how one man could stand alone and be so defiant. “We know our leader, he would not have told you anything you wanted to know. So why would you keep him your prisoner? Why make yourselves our target?” One angel spoke with almost a genuine tone of curiosity.
“Are you alright?” A voice jolted him from these thoughts.
Dean furrowed in confusion, waiting for clarification, but before Gabriel could speak, his face lit up like a light bulb. “Michael is an angel, not a man.” Castiel’s chest filled with a sense of pride in this human,
He grabbed his duffel bag that hung by the door and mindlessly started making his way over to the Echo zone. It was around noon, so, he figured, the inside training facility would be empty until at least 3 pm when the younger ones would start their afternoon training. It meant he had about two hours to spend alone, just him and the punching bag.
“Right,” Dean sighed. “Angel secrets.” Damn angels and their strict policies, maybe next training should be to get the sticks out of their asses. Dean had never quite understood why a lot of their books on angels could only be accessed by higher ranks. It was supposedly dangerous information, did this mean angels would kill anyone who obtained information about them?
When they were sure no one was close enough to hear them anymore, they let out a relieved sigh in unison, and while Dean wanted to address the fact that he was shocked to have seen his father in the midst of what he was sure was something really questionable, he had no idea what to say.
It was a whole scenario. Even though it was about eleven at night, all the lights were on, books were spread out around the floor, and every available surface. Documents that he could spot the Command Center stamp on, were also spread out. Bobby was nursing a bottle of Jack like his life depended on it, Jo had post-it notes stuck to her arms, and Sam’s under-eye bags made him look older.
He followed her gesture inside the house. It was much tidier than his house, but then again, they were women, and in the Winchester household, just three men. And it smelled good too. That’s something he’d always loved about Ellen’s house -
He parked her and followed Sam into the leaving room.
“Really?” Dean asked. “Because last time I checked angels were a bunch of arrogant dicks.”
Sam rolled his eyes, but couldn’t help but laugh at his ridiculous brother.
. Not even with Sammy, not even with Bobby. They all knew of course, but they would just patch him up and give him a pat on the back. Sam would get furious about it some days, yelling and promising to step in between them the next time, but Dean didn’t want him to. Whenever Sam did step a toe out of line, John had no problem putting him in his place too, but Dean would never let their dad close enough to hit Sam.
Gabriel winked at his brother. “How about you open up to your big brother and then afterward we can figure out what that dick Metatron is up to.”
“Yeah, I’ve, uh, been busy.” Dean gave the guy a quick smile, moving past him. “You startin’ or finishing up?” He pointed at the gym.
“Castiel! I need to talk to you.” It felt off, like his voice wasn’t his, he could hardly identify the name he spoke, ridden with such hostility, coming from his own mouth. “Get your feathery ass down here.”
“I mean we’re still friends,” It was more of a question than a statement, and he was clearly trying to convince himself and not Sam, “We talk,
It was getting dark outside, the weak January sun already swallowed by dark clouds. There was really no point in staying here, if Cas would visit the cabin there was no telling when. He forced himself onto his feet, ignoring the part of him that wanted to stay and wait. He quickly added a few more words to his latest note, asking Cas to let him know he was okay.
On the weekends they would be at home with their dad but even then Dean and John would have training from 9 am till 3 pm leaving Sam at home alone. Sam didn’t start hunters training at the same time as Dean, as he was four years younger than him. Dean had always felt guilty about leaving Sam at home, but Sam had always told him he didn’t mind as long as Dean promised that they would watch tv together when he’d get back.
He was significantly tired, and mostly out of it, watching a rerun of some shitty cartoon while dozing off. That was probably why he didn’t notice the door opening.
There was a long pause where neither of them said anything.
So here they were, an angel and a human in a sex club, about to enter private room 11. If Dean wasn’t so uncomfortable, he would make a joke about this being an intro to bad porn, he could practically feel Sam’s aversion to this joke.
“Both of them would kill us within a second, isn’t that saying something?”
Sam was staring at him eager for an explanation. Any explanation.
“Hey, son.”
“Sorry, you’re not really my type.” Dean managed to get the cap open and with a swing of his arm, he splashed the demon with holy water.
But Castiel also knew that wasn’t what Dean was, not completely. Dean was more than that, he was intelligent, resourceful, funny and he was a
“Why would you think that?” The lines in Castiel’s forehead creasing, and his shallow breath didn’t register in the mess that was Dean Winchester at the moment.
“Do you think this is a good opportunity to try the bubble bath?”
Part of Dean didn’t want to expect anything from Cas, any response, good or bad. As long as he kept his expectations low, he wouldn’t get hurt. But another part of him felt like the words would tsunami out of him again, aching to be heard, to be answered, and that part of him felt uneasy, felt more upset with every second passing that Cas wouldn’t bring it up.
they possess, and it is our job to help them believe this is true. For example; when a hairless ape chooses between left or right, we let them think either results in a different outcome, when in fact, we know that everything is already set in stone.”
“So Curt,” Dean started, not really knowing where to take his first question, or whether this guy would even entertain his meddling. “You’re like a walking and talking angel-encyclopedia, right?”
“Can we just focus on the mission?” Castiel asked, his tone clearly uncomfortable.
As always, the biggest shout out to my grandma in crime Fred, who has been supporting me and helping me write this fic. Go show her some love on
“Hey Dean” She yawned, “come in”.
“You wouldn’t,” Dean warned.
Dean took his sweet time taking a shower, brushing his teeth, and when he thought it was an okay time to wake up the angel, he snuck out of the bathroom just to place a Zepplin tape in the Stereo in the kitchen.
“But how do you suppose we’d know the difference? It’s not like they’re just flying around offering their side of the story” Sam got up from his chair, making his way closer to Dean in the kitchen, his interest in the conversation a mix of incredulity at Dean’s thoughts and of wondering about these creatures “And if they were I bet they wouldn’t be willing to simply have a heart to heart with one of us.”
“Careful brother,” Ezekiel warned, “you’re insinuating an archangel has given weapons to hunters, to kill angels, and worse than that, it would mean he does not want Michael freed, and that is a serious accusation.”
“I’m coming with you,” Sam turned his back on him, and ran downstairs, presumably to put some shoes on and get his own gun.
“You have?” He could only bring himself to ask, hoping his dad would take the hint to explain
Dean’s hand reached out to touch it, a small smile creeping up on his face at the memory of an 8-year-old Sam giving it to him on Christmas morning all those years ago.
, Dean thought, he’d always been good at research and Dean just never gave it much thought - he knew what was out there and he knew how to kill it and that was all there was to him. Except now, he found himself getting dragged deeper and deeper into something he had no knowledge of, just bits and pieces of information passed down to them, that every day seemed to stray further from reality and left him confused and weary on how to handle himself.
“Yeah, I guess,” Dean didn’t really know what that was, he would have considered them friends before he had stupidly tried to kiss him, and even if he would try his best take it back, it was out there, that he’d done it, that he’d wanted to do it, and hell that if given the chance he probably would do it again. As much as he wanted to attribute his pass at Cas to alcohol, and that’s the story he was sticking to, he knew damn well that it was more than that.
Except, Dean was worried for him, for his safety, he didn’t want Cas to get hurt.
he was a man, he could handle it, whatever it was they hushed in those meetings, Dean wanted to know. It felt personal now, like everyone was in on some sick joke he still didn’t get - Castiel, not telling him any more than what he “needed” to know, his dad, walking around with a holier than that attitude, always talking about angels like they were the most dangerous creatures out there, well he was starting to doubt it, had his dad even met an angel, apart from Michael? Well, he had! And Castiel wasn’t like they made them out to be. He just wanted
After a few dizzying seconds, Dean got a hold of himself and created some distance between him and his assailants, carefully deciding whether he would try to use the demon knife again or would wait for the others to arrive. Dean got a glimpse of one of the demons that was eyeing his movements and noticing his limp before it tried its luck by kicking Dean hard in the upper thigh. A stabbing pain shot through his leg, causing him to fall on his knee while gasping for air.
So angels
The day passed by, Dean cleaned his gun and spent most of the afternoon outside the cabin cutting wood for the fire. He wasn’t sure how Castiel occupied himself inside, but he figured that he wouldn’t pry, as long as he knew the angel was safe and close, he could relax. What he hadn’t expected though, was that as he came back inside when his hands had gotten too cold in the January chill, Castiel had been keeping himself busy by going through the entire contents of his duffel bag. It was all there, spread out across the wooden floor - jeans, jumpers, underwear, t-shirts, knives, gun, ammo, energy-bars, holy water, a bible, a measuring tape, a book, his mp3 and headphones, his hunting journal, a bunch of pens he didn’t even remember he had tossed in there. Before he could even react, his gaze found Castiel, sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of all of his things, smiling at a piece of paper. Upon closer inspection, still, the grimace of incredulity spread across his face, he realized his
“You knew?” Dean didn’t know whether to feel relieved or just more conflicted. If Cas already knew and he was still here, with him, that was definitely a good sign, but it could also mean he didn’t have a chance to get mad,
“Did you just say ‘figures’?” Sam’s eyebrows shot all the way up his forehead. “Dean, you’d probably be the first one to do the same thing. That’s what our whole family does, we hunt and kill monsters.” That was true. Or, it had been true for a long time. Now, the whole shoot first, ask questions later philosophy was stashed away inside him - he hadn’t shot Castiel, and he still didn’t have many answers to the million questions he had. Some of it was his fault, he knew, when instead of asking him necessary questions he’d pondered about wings and halos.
“If you wanted to undress me, you know all you had to do was ask? - ” He laughed, his eyes closing for a second. “Castiel,” he made his voice sound deeper, trying to imitate Cas’s. “Angel of the lord,” he mocked him, and Cas rolled his eyes at the whole ordeal. “The most adorable angel in the garrison,” his voice back to normal, even if dragging the words a bit.
The mention of his father took Dean by surprise, his arms crossed over his chest, and he took a step forward, to stand closer, looking down on the angel. “What do you know about my father?”
Castiel fell silent for a moment, he seemed to be contemplating something. “There’s nothing I gain by healing humans. Not everything I do has ill intentions, Dean.”
“Yeah, I uh- I know.” Dean wasn’t sure he knew, or if he agreed. Maybe he just thought his dad’s ‘best’ was close to a participation trophy at most, and that was being generous.
“Would you like me to?” Dean nodded in affirmation. “Then yes, I will.”
But when he looked up he could see that Castiel was smiling again, actually smiling at something that Dean said. And his heart did another one of those involuntary flutters as he decided that he liked it when the angel smiled.
Dean sat on a log, facing the lake. He’d gotten to the place they set up, a little earlier than he’d intended, so it made sense that Castiel was nowhere to be seen.
Once again Dean found himself wishing that he had more self-control and cursed his eyes for not being able to look away from Castiel’s body. His eyes darted over the muscles in his chest, the amulet Cas always wore, down to the muscles in his stomach
it was impossible not to be charmed by this literal angel.
“Can we not go over this again? I know the dude’s not into me. Which I know, is hard to believe, guess it happens to the best of us.”  Dean gave her a smug smile and raised his beer bottle.
“But I need to meet with my brother.”
He kept replaying the conversation he'd just had with Castiel.
Dean found it very hard to keep Cas in the friend zone, where he desperately needed him to be, for the sake of not going crazy. But when Cas said stuff like that, it was proving hard to do. It wasn’t Cas’s fault, the angel social skills classes in Heaven were clearly lacking. The thing was, sometimes Cas said things, and they didn’t exactly mean what Dean wanted them to. He was getting used to it by now, so he just gave him a quick smile and a nod.
"They wouldn't tell me over the phone, Dean." Sam stated, "How long have you been here?"
Dean preened at the praise. He’d had very little with John, so he’d become a sucker for it. Sam seemed to have noticed and smiled to himself- proud of his brother. They sat a couple more seconds in silence before Sam seemed to think of another question.
Dean, too focused on getting away, entered the first door he came across- that turned out to be the boy's restroom, where he heard crying coming from the last stall. He also noticed a crumpled up paper next to the trash. He picked it up and despite what his dad had taught him; he read it.
Dean rolled his eyes, "Hey, let me in. I'll fix those shelves for you. So you don't steal Jimmy's crowbar again."
"Hey, Dean! What's up?" the three greeted at the same time.
"Yep. Can I get some grub with you guys tonight? Also, didn't the doctor tell you to take it easy?" he already knew the answer to both questions.
"Eyes on your own paper, Fergus MacLeod." Dean hadn't even noticed he had turned around, but he glared at Dean, then scoffed and turned back in his seat. Scribbling answers harder than he’d been before.
"Nope. The bologna keeps getting worse. This is our best chance." after a beat where Dean could physically hear Bobby's worry, he spoke again, "I can slow it down at least. Maybe you if you book it you can make it before we get in too much trouble."
She laughed to herself, "most story endings are a lie we tell ourselves to create a false sense of hope." What a ray of fucking sunshine, Dean thought to himself, used to her downer attitude by now.
"Who are you?"
"Dean-!" Castiel tried to protest.
"Hello?" He called out- he'd nearly forgotten about the person crying, but they were still crying.
His limbs flickered, black and misshapen before returning to their normal shape. It took Dean back to the level select menu again. There was nothing else to play though, so he quit. Although, he now had all the pieces he needed to open the puzzle box, thanks to the game. He opened it and a blank computer chip lay in the bottom.
"I don't-" he strained, "please, I don't understand. Speak English, please."
"There's no bones in there. It's all just.... meat."
"He might have, though it's far too late now, I couldn't possibly abandon this place and all of its wonderful tenants. I wouldn't be able to live with myself."
Dean left the treehouse and went back into the apartment building, waving to Cas and heading into the other boy's kitchen. Where His Gameboy started acting weird again, the light that Charlie installed, glowing blue. When he pressed the button, a weird symbol came flying at him for no reason. He didn't recognize it, but he remembered it.
Dean didn't bother trying to figure out exactly what that meant, just continued walking until he came to the lunch counter where the emo guy stood alone, cleaning up and putting old stuff away. He looked up and noticed Dean greeting him while working.
Ben thought about it a moment, "I think when you're alive, you can't see the other side."
Dean took that as a goodbye and left. He went to the basement first, thinking it'd be best to check the Lost and found first. He found it there, tucked beneath the shelves. He'd had to lie on the floor to reach it, but he got it.
Dean felt sorry for the author. Whoever it was, they were clearly struggling with something. He felt sorry for whoever the letter was for, too. Someone clearly loved them, but all they got was someone who was mean to them. It wasn't fair, Dean decided. He shrugged to himself. He was glad he'd never have to deal with that.
"I don't know, we can't let Mrs. Carrigan get away with chopping people up and serving... ugh."
"Hey, man." He said, purple bangs peaking out from underneath his hairnet, "Is there a problem?"
"Oh, uh," he really didn't want to tell the old lady that he was ghost hunting, "It's hard to explain."
"I don't like you kids looking into this on your own. Where's dad? Or any of the other kids’ parents?"
"Are you the beast?" Maybe not the best assumption, but he wanted to know.
King of hell, more like, Dean thought to himself, "Dude you seem super depressed, like all the time. Are you really sure your dad isn't pressuring you? It has to be hard being the Son of such a violent man."
"Please..." it pleaded and fell silent, breathing heavily.
Ben cut Dean off "Uh-oh! Mommy's coming- I gotta go!"
"Let's take it for a test run." she bounced in place, excited.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck, uncomfortable. "It's alright, man. Gabe's probably looking at his file now-I better uh, I better go check on him." And with that Dean dashed out of the room, not giving Cas a chance to reply.
"Holy crap," she said, astounded.
Chuck whimpered, but allowed Dean in. The nails holding the shelves up were hardly in the wall. Dean took the hammer resting on said shelves and forced them in. Fixed. He glared at Chuck from behind his prosthetic.
"But-" she disappeared, leaving an envelope where she'd stood.
"What's up, Rowena? You don't sound like yourself today." He asked.
Cas had given Dean 10 Polaroids last week of the same picture of Gizmo over and over. He pulled one out of his pocket. "Will this work?"
Awkward. "Uh, no, bud. I haven't, sorry."
Chuck winced at the curse but nodded, "I-I'd do it my-myself, but I- uh- I'm out of c-clean clothes."
"You seemed to enjoy it, what's wrong?" That was true. The last few times Dean had visited, she'd go on and on about it, "Did you not like ending?"
She moved quicker than Rowena, but Dean could get through the mazes with little difficulty. The final one led to a sarcophagus, but no cut scene appeared. Instead, it whited out and sent him back to the level select menu.
"I found that in Cas's puzzle box, think you can tell me what's inside?" he asked.
"Oh, my!" she exclaimed, "What is that horrific device you have?"
Instead, he found himself older, about 15, with his prosthetic strapped tightly to his head. He stood face to face with a very alive Jody Mills in her apartment.
She appeared like she normally would, and Dean thought she looked more relaxed than she had last year.
I'm going to have a few chapters written in advance, just as a cushion to myself- but things at work are picking up, so after chapter 4 things might get a little wonky.
Ben shivered, "Mommy scares me now. She scares everyone... but she wasn't always like that. She used to be nice, like daddy." he continued, unprompted, "I remember they had a fight and then she was really sad. Then her sadness turned into angriness."
"That's your only issue? Mrs. Carrigan lives in your apartments. There's no way she can make bologna there." Gabe stated.
Chuck opened the door wide enough to get the crowbar shakily through, but didn’t open it further. "P-please no yelling" he cried from behind the door.
"Hey, dude," he called, "what happened to that chip I gave you?"
"Dad's at work- you know that, Bobby. The others don't belive us- it'll be the egg incident all over again- Jimmy still teases Cas and I about it."
It interrupted Castiel, "Yes. Please."
He nodded, "That actually makes sense."
Dean looked inside the fridge. Empty. Looked like he'd be eating at Cas's again- he didn't mind. Jimmy's cooking was the bomb. Dean closed the fridge and went to his room, grabbing his Gameboy. He made his call to Bobby on the way to his dad's room.
On the floor of the Livingroom was a spirit box, giving Ben the opportunity to communicate even if he couldn't or didn't want to appear. Dean walked past it to the bathroom where the Gameboy was glowing. He used it like usual and Ben appeared.
Dean knew exactly what to do. He matched himself up to the mysterious V. "Hey," he called, grabbing him.
"On way. 20 min. Go ahead, but delay."
Okay, so maybe that last one was from a joke paper, Dean thought. The last nail was empty, but it was making the Gameboy light up. He used it and another envelope with his name appeared. Again, it contained a journal page. Dean wondered why the pages were only appearing to him one at a time, but didn't dwell on it too much. He quickly left again and stepped into 504. Time to visit Ben.
"Oh, I guess our mommies were friends." Ben giggled.
She'd attached bright red handles to his Gameboy, and parts from her own walkie talkie- how did every kid in this apartment have walkie talkies Dean wondered to himself- he flipped it over, the strange cartridge was still in, but she kept her word and Dean could change it out easily. She pointed to the light she'd added near the antenna at the top.
Dean pulled his friend back by his shoulders, "Dude, chill. I don't think he's gonna respond."
"So," Gabe said, clapping his hands, "what are we doing about it? Do we report it?"
Chapter 4 will be up at 11:59PM on the 22nd and it will be little shorter, but hopefully this chapter will make up for it. And for those that don't know what to comment: What was the last thing you ate? Did you enjoy it?
"Dean, I'm getting worried. Call me. Now." said the last one.
"Do you think he--"
"How is that even possible?" he asked.
"Don't you have sandwiches to attend to? Be a good little boy and eat your lunch, Fergus." Dean mocked.
Dean ignored her a moment, "Hey, uh, Lady. What's the matter?"
Most of the place showed no activity except the kitchen where the light suddenly stared, glowing. He pressed the buttons, like he'd already gotten used to doing, and a letter addressed to him appeared on the floor. He picked it up and opened it, only to see another journal page. Which he placed with the others. Dean searched the rest of the place, but didn't end up finding anything. So he left.
"My dearest one," it read, "day after day, I ache for a glance from you my way. Maybe it is because of that terrible pain that I make myself cruel- or maybe a boy, a young man, my age should not feel such things for one like yourself. I beg of you, of God, to forgive me of such feelings- I will burn for them, no doubt. I blame you. Your existence is pure temptation. Your--" it stopped there. Who knew a highschool student could write like that.
Cas turned to glare at Gabriel, "No, it is not. I cannot condone such an action."
"You could always sell? There's got to be someone who you'd trust to take good care of this place. And you could pocket the profit to set up your own little shop." Dean suggested.
"Cas, dude. I'm pretty sure he's just upset they switch bologna day to tomorrow." Dean replied, receiving a chuckle from Gabe, "Seriously, no one I have ever met has so much excitement for the creepiest lunch day. The dude is so not wired right- he hates pizza day! Who could hate pizza! It's almost inhumane."
Cas walked a few paces to a cooler she kept in the kitchen as well. When he opened the lid, Dean could see that it was just more bologna, and some frozen vegetables. Although he saw it himself, he acted surprised when Castiel relayed what he saw to Dean. After he walked off to look at the rest of the apartment, Dean got the freezer unlocked fairly quick- but waited until his friend came back to the kitchen before he opened the freezer.
"You know what, forget I said anything. Must be the nightmares bleeding over." he sighed.
"Hey, squirrel!" Crowley called, "nobody likes a goody two-shoes, Deeeeean "
"Castiel, please. No." Bobby begged before promptly vomiting on the floor again. He panted with his hands on his knees for a moment before blindly closing the cooler. "This... this is way over our heads, Dean- even mine."
"I hear you and Gabe connected over the case, Sammy, hows that going?"
"Then I pray to God and all his angels that this works." Greg replied.
"Are you the oracle?" he asked.
"What's this?" Dean gestured to it, buying more time.
"Don't hold out on me, man! What'd you find out?"
"You mean the old hag who lives past the field of death? Just take the ladder down. It's always a ladder down."
He walked straight to the bedroom and pulled the boards from the door. He didn't want to wait, so he walked in by himself. Against the wall was a blood stained mattress and broken shelves. The Gameboy was going wild, so he pulled it out. Pinned to the Mattress with the springs of it was a tall, slender, black man. He seemed unable to speak as one was in his throat, but Dean still called out to him.
"So," the other boy replied, a wide smile on his face.
Dean rolled his eyes and led Bobby further into the room. As he passed by Cas, he pulled him up.
For the first time, Dean didn't know what to say- he'd never been good at the whole comforting thing, but he knew what to do though. He pulled his friend in, hugging him for all he was worth as his best friend sobbed into his chest. Dean ached for him, almost feeling his broken heart for himself. He still couldn't believe that Cas's mom would just up and leave him. Something would have pulled her away. After all, Dean couldn't imagine anyone not loving this boy enough to stay.
"Didn't several students call out last Wednesday after eating the sandwiches from the previous day?" Cas asked.
"Yeah, actually Cas and I-"
"Hey this isn't a good time," she called out. Ignored, Metatron bust her door down, "What the hell has gotten into you?!?" She cried.
"Really, baby, again?" She laughed at him again, when he looked up at her with his big, green eyes, apparently affronted. "Alright, alright-you don't gotta look at me like that."
"It looks like a slaughter factory in here," Dean mumbled to himself, looking at the machine.
He picked up the small radio she kept on an end table in the living room, just to fiddle with it. He changed, flipped through the stations, as Cas attempted to move the clock hands again. Suddenly they both heard a click, as the first bedroom door unlocked. Dean looked at the clock Cas had been messing with and the hands were at 12:12. Dean carefully pushed the door open, immediately freezing.
Ollie Sky (Colorado Springs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Dean, please get some rest." She said sincerely as he left. He didn't know why, but he wanted to tell Cas about this as soon as possible, so he headed down.
"Charlie, you okay?" Dean asked, concerned.
"Oh, I'm alright," she said, in the same tired tone. "My thoughts distracted me, you know me."
"Oh, God." Bobby exclaimed, hand over his mouth.
"Look, is your dad pushing these vie"Look, is your dad pushing these vie
"Hey, Jodes." Dean greeted her with a wave. "Still no bright light or anything?"
"Class is almost over, everyone hand in your papers, please." She announced right before the bell rang.
"I don't understand." he begged.
"I miss you, mom. Are you happy where you are?" He asked aloud, stroking her smiling face. Dean looked at it a little longer and he took a deep breath, and put the picture back where he found it- and instead found another envelope with his name on it. He opened it and got another journal page. Dean put it with the rest of them, mildly confused. He made sure the safety was on, then shoved the gun into the back of his waistband, covering it up with his shirt.
“The sticks call me many names. “

The bathroom still stunk to high hell, so Dean wouldn't be going in. He stood in the Livingroom when his Gameboy started glowing again- another symbol. He drew it and continued down to the first floor.
Turning the safety off, he pointed the gun towards the sky. He took a few calming breaths and yanked open the door, aiming the gun at the person in the living room.
He couldn't, he realized.
But my grandfather never understood these things. He was a writer, you see, and his stories were all he had.
Dean quips about their moment of vulnerability, and Sam laughs, and it is different, but it is familiar.
This is another gift, I suppose. One I've kept hidden from them too long.
It is here that the gilded angel finds his soul, and here that the men who were always too much, always too little, find the freedom that seemed to evade them - find their peace forever.
I hear a whimper in my ear, one that escapes his lips, and he cradles my head, like I am a child, still. Like all that I am to the universe will always be something that comes after all that I am to him.
I leave them, for one last time, and it is not easy.
There wasn't much Dean wanted for in this life he'd chosen for himself ; this life that had kept him out of a world which chased him into the darkness time and time again. This much, Castiel knew. But he also knew that shadows lingered, still, as they often did. Some, waiting in twilit corners to dig their claws into his skin, others curled in his mind, restless, poised to pounce when the world would still, just so. There wasn't much Castiel could offer Dean, with Heaven tilted on its axis and his shoulders burdened with the weight of something he didn't quite understand yet, but this...this he could do. He could protect the one person he had promised to stand by, a promise that had been the first to break past the bounds of his duty. A promise that had left the bittersweet taste of freedom on his lips. A promise he clung to now, as much for Dean as for himself.
Dean jerked upward, his heart pounding heavily in his chest.
Three college kids sat in their livingroom starting at the TV.
"I don't know. I didn't feel like it was my place to ask him, and with Cas being, well, Cas, I doubt he would have brought it up with me, anyway."
"Oh... uh.." he tried to think of something to say, "did you finish that book you were reading?"
"That's okay," he rocked on his heels, "everyone here seems lighter now. I just hope she's happy wherever she is."
But sometimes, you did things to protect those close to you. Things that were without reason.
And so it goes, and it gets easier. Not quite always, and not soon, but it does.
But then, his thoughts flitted to the months he had spent posted across the brightly lit window, the canopy of leaves overhead his only shelter, all in the name of keeping a word that didn't need keeping. He remembered the weight that had settled behind his ribs on an autumn evening, when he had made the choice that would come to break his world. He recalled the hurt glinting in eyes that shone like cracked emeralds in firelight, and the way his chest caved at the sight of it.
It is...hard to speak. The word
Still, Sam and Dean do not leave.
So, yes, Castiel prayed. And all that greeted his pleas was the heavy tread of silence.
But, this is an ending, and it is inevitable.
It is not easy to exist in this space with them, with the grief surrounding them like a storm cloud, with anger simmering under their skins, guilt flooding their veins.
Castiel had seen death before, in a manner of speaking, but this was different. Death, for him, had never been the slow descent into darkness that it was now. It had never been the awareness of the fire within snuffing out, a stale breath plunging the world into darkness one candle flame at a time.
It had never felt so deliberate, so much like a

. He had no strength, nor desire, to deny himself the simplicity of truth. The odd comfort of it.
who refused to be wielded in a war that would break the world for the sake of it, in the name of an absent God.
I leave them with tokens that can call on me when they're ready. If they're ready.
In the silence that hovers over them in between the words, Sam looks to Dean, brows creased. And Dean picks at the slivers of wood protruding from the carvings of their names.
They talk through the night, trading stories they hid within themselves all those weeks ago. Their memories are blurry - they are older than they think themselves to be - and so they snap their fingers as they try to recall a name, a place, an event. And there is laughter that does not echo in the empty corners, and silence that is not too loud.
Omniscience is an odd thing to experience. It is not a word I am overly fond of speaking out loud, either. I do little of that now, though, so it is not as bad.
Dean turns his face away from mine, and Sam begins to ask me a question, hurt lacing his voice and his words. And it is all too familiar, this distance I feel now. This chasm that seems uncrossable.
