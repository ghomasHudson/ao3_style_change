The kidnapper laughed before going up to him and said “see that’s what happens when you don’t listen to me and tell me what I want to know. Now would you like to do this the hard way or the easy way. Where and who is the spider-kid?”
Steve looked Tony in his eyes and nodded his head. “I’m okay, it’s really not that bad. It’s helping, I promise. Just gonna take some time.”
Bruce frowned and looked at his nephew and began to check his nose. Damian let our little hisses as Bruce’s hand made contact with his broken nose. Bruce hummed to himself, this was definitely broken.
“Are you sure bud? You know uncle Bruce wouldn’t mind and we’ll be right there with you.” Tony said.
The man’s eyes bulged out as he saw who was holding his wrist. Steve stared at all of them before speaking in a calm but scary voice.
“But doesn’t this just prove I’m not as smart as Peter. And maybe you’re wasting your time on me.” Liam said in a whisper.
Liam looked at both his dad and papa before looking back down at the envelope. He opened it up carefully, pulling out the piece of paper that held it all. He held it in his hand and began to read it, his face dropping when he read the first sentence of the letter. He finished reading the letter, folding it up and putting it back in the envelope. He looked up to see both Steve and Tony giving him worrying looks and he gave them a hesitant smile.
Liam’s eyes lit up at the question. He never really had the chance to go on runs with his papa because by the time he woke up for school, Steve would return back and they would carry on with the day. But now he really had the chance and he wasn’t gonna let it slip.
Peter whined before looking over to his dad’s side and sobbed loudly when he didn’t see that Tony was there.
Tony smiled at Bruce before engulfing him in a hug. Before they could say anything else Peter began to stir awake.
“Alright I’m gonna stop you right there. You aren’t broken Steve. You’re so strong babe, you really are. No one thinks that you’re broken at all. You fought through this Steve. Your a hero and you stayed so strong through all of this. I heard who they wanted because I saw the recordings that they left and I heard how you defended Peter and made sure that they didn’t get to him. You took the torture that was meant for him if they had gotten their hands on him. Steve you protected our son and that makes you a hero in my eyes as well as his. You didn’t deserve it babe. We all know that what he did to you, you did not deserve but it’s because of you that he’s here today with us. It’s all because you were a hero and you put everyone else first before yourself. We love you Steve. No matter how broken or battered you are, we’ll always love you no matter what and we’ll always be here for you whenever you need us.” Tony said.
They all smiled back and shouted one last “happy birthday” and Peter knew that this was indeed the best birthday ever.
“I’m gonna miss you too babe.” Tony replied as he pulled them both closer to his chest. Steve looped one of his arms around Tony while putting the other one around Peter.
“You don’t have to worry about that kiddo. Just keep him distracted and we’ll be right out as soon as we finish tidying up.” Steve added.
“Listen stop complaining and being whiny and stop annoying him. Leave him alone and stop bringing your stupid complaints to me alright. Man up and take the hit.” Coach Wilson said.
“Hey kiddo. It’s okay bud. Take a deep breath for me buddy. It’s okay. You’re alright. Deep breaths for me bud.” Steve said as he grabbed the glass of water and brought it to his son’s mouth.
So here he was now, his dad driving him to the restaurant and he couldn’t wait for the magical night. But he was also nervous and he didn’t know why.
He waited for a reply to come but it never did. He sat there in silence, stirring his drink absentmindedly as he waited another 10 minutes for Ryan to arrive. He tried calling Ryan to see if he would pick up but it kept going to voice message.
Lilly took Liam’s hands and pinned them above his head, opening the button of his jeans, taking out his cock and jerking him. Liam let out a growl, using his knee he kicked her hard until she let go of him and he scrambled away from her.
Days later, Peter was feeling better and everyone was happy that he was his happy and goofy self again.
Liam nodded his head and pressed himself closer to his papa. Steve tightened his arms around his son and they stayed like that for a bit. He pulled away and gave his papa a smile. Despite the worry, Steve smiled back at his son and ruffled his hair.
Sam bumps his hip against Steve's. "No texting on the job, lover-boy," he teases, carrying a tub of flour.
He looks up at Steve, the only light now coming from the fire, his reactor, and the blinking control panel. Yeah.... he's not exactly sure what he's going to do about this.
Tony is a little surprised to feel an arm around his neck, pulling him into a hug. Tony let's out a chuckle, relaxing and hugging Bucky back gently. "Thank you. This has been better than any doctors visit I've had in a long time."
Steve understood more than most really. Things happened so fast. Things changed so fast. Just last year, it had seemed impossible that aliens would descend upon earth. Yet, the future came, and with it, changes to social trends.
Then Tony's gone, only to appear standing next to James a minute later. "So when did that happen?" Wanda says.
To Howard's credit he only looks mildly fazed. "Taser gun. So.. you're really Steve?" Steve nods. "Then how are you here?"
Steve answers instantly, in the way that makes it easy for Tony to tell exactly how desperately Steve has been counting. "Six months since I woke up. Seven since the battle. I missed you."
"Yeah. They had a hard life, but.. well to put it simply, they're both great kids." Steve feels the almost wistful smile he gives back to Tony creeping across his face. "For what it's worth, I'm fairly sure she loves him. A lot."
Nat walks into the front room, stepping around Tony and his scattered circuits to sit gracefully on the plush white couch. "Whitehall wants us to come in. To do real work for HYDRA. At a facility in Siberia."
He's a bit breathless when he looks up at Steve, a wide smile on his face. "Hey there," he says, removing his wet jacket and hanging it up next to the door. "Thanks so much for doing this, it means a lot to me," he says, his brown eyes twinkling at Steve.
Unfortunately for Howard, at that time, Steve and Nat have risen enough in HYDRA's ranks to have become a staple in HYDRA procedures, and therefore an obvious hole of they were gone. They were getting close, Steve knew it. Howard could wait. They hadn't been here the past nine months only to compromise everything now.
"Right.. well, I'm sure we'll be able to fit your needs, if you'd like a card." Steve plucks a business card with the words Star Bakery written on it in swirling blue letters.
Steve nods, then he picks up a pancake and bites into it, leaning over the counter, carefully avoiding the ants. His phone buzzes in his pocket, so he pulls it out.
"I want you to stay out of it." She squints at him, then opens her mouth to protest. "Please, we don't know what's happening here and you're not at 100%."
His cheeks flush bright red as he goes back to what he thinks he was doing—a rag in hand could only mean one thing, right—and continues to wipe down the marble countertop. He steals a glance in the mans direction and catches him mid yawn.
"Promise." Then Steve pulls Tony and himself out of place and towards the front table, close enough to hear, but only for a moment before Sam meets his eyes.
It's another five months before Daniel Whitehall calls again, at which point Steve can sense that Nat is getting antsy. Seven times in two months, her eyes had flashed gold at him. She answers the phone this time, nodding and making confirmations. Her posture changes the moment she picks up the phone, shifting from her to a spy right before his eyes.
Tony grabs the remote, turning on the TV. "Jarvis?" The channel switches, and Steve sees two women sitting at a table.
Then there was Wanda and her brother Pietro that were his youngest employees by far, but when the young twins had come into the store with flourishing Western European accents and nowhere near enough meat on their bones, with resumes and what were clearly their nicest clothes, Steve couldn't help but feel responsible for them. He had taken them on as a kindness, but they had turned out to be wonderful employees. Both could bake well enough and they were good at following instructions, even if they had a bit of a rebellious streak. They had been adopted from Sokovia when they were only 5 by a man who had turned out to be a psycho murderer who's name they never uttered. The cops had got the twins out just in time and they got stuck in the system, but it was the American system at least. When they turned 18, they moved to New York with nothing but the clothes on their back, hanging out around a homeless shelter. That was where Clint had met them and directed them to the bakery. Now the twins crashed in Bucky's old room in Steve's apartment. It was a little weird, but they helped cover rent and they were technically adults, so really, it wasn't wrong.
"Well, at first watch, all I can really say is that he seems very happy. We see a lot of the Avengers team on social media or out and about, but it's a rare occasion we see Captain America out of the suit."
"Sex, Howard. When you gave me the penicillin, I thought it was the serum. After Bucky died, I tried to get drunk, but I couldn't. I made plans to go dancing with Peggy right before I died. When I found the vibranium shield, I asked why it wasn't standard issue. Peggy shot at me. It's me." Steve leans forward, his muscles groaning in protest. "What the hell did you shoot me with?"
"Not upset. Not even surprised." Steve runs his fingers through Tony's soft hair. "He trusts you." It was almost hard to say. Steve had longed to get to Bucky first, be his anchor and such. But Tony had found him, and Bucky had decided that he wanted to trust Tony, and he hadn't been able to look at Steve. Just how the cards fell, he supposed.
"How about matching wedding bands." It's asked casually, so Tony blames both Steve and his foggy mind fog the fact that he didn't understand the question right away.
Sam's eyes darken at the mention of Becca, but he snaps back to his senses quickly. "Well, I know this is a little old fashioned, but I kinda wanted to ask your blessing to—"
Then Steve gets called in on a stealth mission with Nat. An unknown assassin tries to kill Fury like a common man. Fury shows up at Steve's hotel, bleeding and proclaiming SHIELDS newfound compromise. Steve begs Tony not to come down. Tony, bastard as he is, listens to him for once, and not a day later Steve is missing, a fugitive, and not answering his phone.
"I know Tony please I know. I love you so much, you can't do that." He's hugging Tony again, but Tony can only bristle under his touch now.
"You're not wrong. But we've made it work so far. Obviously we would have to wait. A while. Bucky's still... well, you know better than me. But if the opportunity ever presented itself..."
His hair is smooth through his fingers as he washes it, rubbing at his scalp. How would he be able to face anyone he knew ever again knowing what he had done. While it wasn't exactly illegal, it was still wrong, no matter how right it had felt to his heart. At the time he hadn't even registered how wrong it was. He kissed a man who he still wasn't certain liked men, but that he was certain loved someone else. Loved Pepper a lot.
"Sure yeah," Sam says waving him off, focusing on Bucky before Steve was even gone. Not that that was really going to be a private conversation, they were still surrounded by their friends and family.
Steve rolls his eyes, opening the container Howard had made them for the Power stone. It wasn't much like the original, but it would work at least. "I'm not dead either, Starlord." Nat opens the bag, putting the stone into the opened capsule.
"Love is in the air," Steve says, smiling sweetly. Tony hums a gentle affirmation, leaning up into Steve's neck to plant a little kiss there. "I'm pretty sure Bucky wouldn't let me live it down if I got hickeys at his wedding."
In a moment of what feels suspiciously like the onslaught of a panic attack, he pops the trash can lid open and dumps the cake, slamming the lid back down. It rings through the room and Tony's eyes close, his chest heavy with difficult breaths. "Tony?" A quiet voice calls out from down the hall.
Inside the stone, he can feel the raging spirit of the Skull, who he could bring back with no effort at all.. but below that... below that was a quieter presence. Natasha. He tries to pull her from the stone, but she remains firmly on the other side of the soul realm. "Nat," he says, looking down at the stone, and the orange light wrapped tightly around his hand. "How. Please," he begs with the stone, falling to his knees.
Steve takes in a shaky breath through his tired lungs. "I love you." He emphasized his words, hoping that they could get through Tony's thick skull. "I loved Bucky, but I love you. I have to... you understand right? I have to find him. But not because I want him back, or you're not enough, or whatever your dumb head says."
"That's really sweet. From what I've seem, you did a great job." Steve says, squeezing his hand as they step out the sliding glass doors onto the street.
Before he knows it, he's at the cottage, driving down the driveway he had been so scared of. Pepper sits on the porch, Morgan on her lap. She musters a weak smile for Steve, and he finds one for her too. "Hey Morgan!" He says, walking up the porch stairs.
Tony whirls his head, hovering in the air. "Steve!?" He swears he had seen a glint of red. Again, there it was. Tony races down into the trees, landing in the deep snow. "Steve!"
Pepper purses her lips at Tony, and the brunet shrinks back into his chair, crossing his arms over his chest and mouthing something that Steve can't make out. "Thank you for the cake, Steve, it looks wonderful."
"Can you do.. black?" Bucky asks tentatively, walking up behind Tony to look at the holographic image in wonder.
Tony pulls into a spot and snaps his fingers before going for the keys. "Exactly! People like Bucky." Steve smiles, stepping out of the car. Tony follows after a moment later, linking arms with him. "I'm going to be honest, this was the most exciting date I've had in a long time," he concedes as if it's a scandalous secret.
"That would be nice. Also, thanks for shutting me up." Steve moves his hands down the fitted seams to hold his hips gently.
Steve slides off the counter, feeling more then a little ashamed that they were not only snuck up on, but also scolded. Nat on the other hand, has regained her cool composure. "Mr. Jarvis, I'm afraid, I have to ask, how much of that did you hear?" She takes a few steps forward, closing the vodka bottle. Steve leaves the other god awful one on the counter.
Tony clicks his tongue on the roof of his mouth. "I'm a genius, remember. You sent your address once, you'll never have to send it again."
Steve shakes his head, almost frantically. "I-" he coughs once, grimacing. "That was really good. Hot. Thank you."
"It's Howard's alcohol!" He protests, despite his body trying to kill him. Seriously, what the fuck was in that shit.
"Hello to you too. I was wondering if you could do a wedding on Sunday," Steve says, leaning back in the armchair.
Better him then Natasha though. She could never get in a combat situation, not here. Lucky for him he had been able to play it off as her bring a secret weapon, but in reality he was scared that the power inside her would be released. So far, the only evidence of anything beyond her eyes glowing when she gets emotional was when she had calmed his body down after dinner with Peggy. Maybe that was it. It would be really nice if that was it.
"Woe is you. If it makes you feel better, we can skip the rest of the fundraiser." Steve tugs his tie out of Tony's pocket, looping it around his neck and tying it.
"Tony?" Steve knew very well he wasn't the smart one out of the two of them, but he felt the need to voice what he was thinking about.
"Not even the stuff about him sleeping with men?" She gives him a look out of the side of her eye, almost as if they're back on the helicarrier and ashes seizing him up.
Once night falls, they take the party up to the roof, where Tony has all his pool chairs and some blankets  brought up and positioned to face the impending fireworks display. Steve and Tony share a picnic blanket with Tony nestled perfectly into Steve's side. "Thank you for all this, Tony." Steve says gently, right as the first firework shoots up into the sky.
Steve can't help but blush, as the rest of the room groans. "Shut up Stark," Rhodey says, covering his eyes. Luckily, nobody is looking at him, so he's free enough to grab and down one of the champagne flutes on the counter.
"I'm good." Steve looks up at him with a smile. Tony walks back up to the pilots seat. Friday immediately begins preparing the Jet for take off and they get up into the air in only a few seconds, heading straight for New York.
Steve winces. "Rebecca," he says, almost pleadingly. "You said you weren't going to cause a scene." As much as Bucky was his brother, Rebecca really was like a sister for a long time... ok, maybe more like a favorite cousin or something. Steve really didn't want to have to cause a scene either, but it looked like it might be coming to that.
"My pleasure." Tony rubs Steve's knuckles in a way that the both of them did a lot since coming out of the war.
Steve can't help but laugh, even when Tony fixes him with an annoyed look. "I think it's cute. Do you have a TikTok too?"
"You have been undercover for quite some time then. I'm sure you are unaware of the plot to dispose of Arnin Zola." He says it like it isn't a bomb shell, like it is just another tidbit of unimportant information occupying the vastness of his mind. One thing was for sure, Daniel Whitehall made Steve's blood boil. "He should be... rather unwell soon. I suggest not eating anything meant for him."
Steve looks up in surprise. He hadn't really.... expected to get even this far. "Great... um. Great. Yeah."
"Sounds like the Howard I knew. Did I ever tell you I thought Howard and Peggy were sleeping together?" The snort she replies with is enough to tell him that he had in fact, not told her about that. "It's true. They had been talking about stopping for fondue on the way back from dropping me off in enemy territory, and I was absolutely convinced that meant sex."
As they fall asleep in silence, her hand finds his, holding it between them. Her eyes stop glowing and she closes them slowly in the cool light of a full moon.
She doesn't even use the Mind stone. That's just straight up assassin training right there, and it scares the shit out of Steve.
The shadowed figure chuckles menacingly, not doing as Tony asked. What a pisshat, really. "Consider me a guide, to you, and all who seek the Soul Stone."
He falls to his knees next to Steve, reaching out slowly with his good hand towards the tree branch protruding from his gut. "Jesus Christ, Cap." Ok. Plan of action. What was the plan. He needed.... a plan... that's it. Just.. What to do next? Steve was relying on him, now more than ever, and Tony needed to come through. "I'll um. I'll take it out and then cauterize it. Then we can get back to... well I'm sure there's some antibacterial stuff, then um..."
"Mother fucker. Friday, take me up to the clouds." This was just like Steve. Tony hadn't even remembered the override codes, but of course he had. Tony had tried to save Steve, and no luck.
Steve squeezes his hip gently. "Isn't the best man supposed to help clean up?" No matter how good of an idea it sounded to him, Tony did technically have duties or whatever.
Finally, just as the sun is beginning to lower itself in the sky, they head back to the tower. Steve holds his hand as they walk through the busy streets, an adoring look on his face. They stop on a corner, and he leans in closer. "Can I kiss you?"
His friends were the worst. Sure, they got him out of more sticky situations then he cared to count, but they were so mean.
Tony leans further back until his back hits Steve's lap, his brown eyes now looking up at Steve. "I mean... I won't stop you. I.. I just don't celebrate." His voice is the only indication that something is amiss. Somehow in front of a crowd Tony could hide anything, but if it was just them, he was shit at secret keeping.
"Every night before I go to bed." His voice drops in an equally not subtle way, a pretty grin on his face. "In fact I'm a little sleepy even now."
Except by the time they arrive, a plan appears to be no longer necessary. The drones are retreating into the sky and there's no screaming or crying. Just eerie silence.. the kind that comes after a disaster.
Steve shakes his head no with an attempt at a serious look on his face. "Best part was that the cat had actually died that morning." Needless to say, Peggy hadn't exactly been happy with him. They had a good laugh about it now, but certainly not then.
Well, surely Steve hadn't been the only one to have to leave behind a sleeping partner this morning, given the question Sam had asked him. A wedding. An engagement. It would be perfect. Steve was almost positive that Nat and Clint would force the happy couple to hand over the planning, and if anyone could plan a party it was those two. They were both hard asses, but they were hard asses that loved their friends to death.
"Of course sir," JARVIS says, the TV turning on as if of its own accord and switching to the display screen.
"I knew I was forgetting something. Hold on, I'm definitely gonna blow you. Wouldn't want your delicious come wasted on an expensive suit." Tony winks, moving down to undo Steve's pants, pulling his dick out with reverence. "Mmmh... yeah, I want you inside me at home." He strokes up and down Steve's length a couple times, watching the blond bite at his lip.
"If you ever need help, I'll be more then willing." He was planning on coming back once he could, so it wasn't an empty promise. Really though, he was a relatively capable guy and would be ready to help her with anything she asked for when he came back.
He laughs. "Well when you put it that way..." He looks over at Steve with a wide smile. "Not all of them, no. In fact most people don't make it past one night."
"Lemme stop you right there Buck. Sam loves you. Sam asked you to marry him. Everyone out there loves you and Sam, and nobody doesn't want you to be happy ok?" Steve sets a hand on his shoulder. "And if all else fails you can get a cat or fourteen and move back in with me."
"Thank you," Steve says with a smile. His eyes aren't on the cake though, they're on Tony across the room, dressed up in an impeccable tux, far more expensive looking then the one he had originally come in wearing. His hair is impeccable too, and Steve's pretty sure he's the prettiest sight ever. Which makes sense. It's his wedding night. He's a married man by now. Which is odd, because Steve doesn't catch the glint of a ring.
He nods, even though she can't see him. "Yeah I'll see you. Be safe." That was just a blanket recommendation. Safe on the roads, safe walking up the stairs, and maybe safe in the bed if they so chose.
Steve's heart stops the second this man walks through the door. He has his hands in the pockets of an incredibly tailored suit, and he's wearing these stupid red sunglasses over eyes that are turned away from Steve and towards the cakes in the display case. His hair has this messy quality to it that makes Steve feel all tingly, like he's seeing this man in bed in the morning, his hair over closed eyes. To put it simply, Steve was fairly certain that an actual deity had just walked through his door. Luckily he doesn't look at Steve, because Steve thinks he would die of embarrassment given how long he's been staring.
"Yeah yeah, get outta here Starlord." Peter gets stars in his eyes, but he goes back to his ship dutifully, a bit of a skip in his step. From the machine on his belt, too loud 70's pop music starts playing and he gets into the ship, taking off.
"You mean since we saved the world? Pretty well actually. I took a vacation for the first time in a decade. Fiji is nice." They make it through the doors into the large hall, filled with people who have more money then Steve could imagine. "Sweetheart, if you think of yourself as a fish out of water, you're going to be one." She plucks two glasses of champagne off a tray being carried by and hands him one.
"I mean, really it's only fair. You met some of my family," Tony says, buckling himself in and starting the car, "this time, I can meet some of yours."
"I get the feeling. Now what do you say we have some drinks?" Tony bats his eyes at him. Steve rolls his eyes with a fond look, only letting go of Tony's hand to climb into the car.
Tony grabs his hand across the table before Steve can say another word, pulling him away from the newlyweds. "Um, right," Steve says, too little too late. But Tony keeps holding his hand once they've cleared the table, so maybe it's all a win in the end. "Tony, I don't think you're going to avoid her wrath," he mutters.
"Good idea." Steve leans down to gently work their lips together, as close as either could get to making out without busting stitches.
The two Stark's herd them towards the dining room, and they all end up seated around the table. Steve is sitting with Nat on one side and Daniel on the other. Part of him wanted to be next to Peggy, but the logical part of him knew that that was actually a terrible idea. Peggy returns shortly, looking as impeccable as before, gracefully taking her seat next to Daniel. "So I'm assuming you're Natasha?"
"People like Bucky," Steve says softly, steering the conversation back in a way that wouldn't make Tony look so sad.
He would do anything Tony asked. "Yeah. I um, took my friends van here though, and I think he'll kill me if I leave it here overnight."
Tony drops his head back down onto Steve's chest. "That asshole is too charming for his own good. The hair doesn't help."
"What about Bucky. He... I know how much he means to you." Tony sounds small in a way that Steve was under the impression he never could. Tony was always supposed to be the biggest person in the room, even if not physically.
"Yeah I know." Bucky shrugs, handing him the golden envelope in his hand. "And you're a secretive bitch."
Steve and Natasha lock eyes. She shrugs. "Maybe," Steve says. "We could come around for dinner once."
Tony spears it on his fork, raising it to Steve before he puts it in his mouth. If there was one thing Steve knew how to do, it was make a good cake. All of them were moist and mostly fresh, but most importantly they had a lot of love put into them. It was a good job. Everything was worth it to see the way Tony's eyes light up with that one bite. "This is amazing, Steve," he says, taking another bite. "Here, do you want some," he offers a fork full of cake to Steve.
But the smile on Tony's face when he looks up at Steve is enough to eradicate his common sense. "That would be nice. Thank you so much." Steve goes back around the counter, trying to ignore the man who was ruining his composure. He is, however, pretty fucking surprised when he turns to find Tony leaning across the counter next to the cash register, a plate of raspberry chocolate cake in his hand. "So where'd you learn to bake like this," he says, taking a large bite.
"I meant it," Steve says, so quick it's like he's trying to rip off a bandaid. "I mean, absolutely no pressure, I think it's clear I can live with it, but.. um. If you.. want."
Tears form in Steve's eyes, and before Tony can realize what's happening, Steve is hugging him as tight as he can through the armor. "Tony. Tony. I've always loved you."
Tony let's go of his hand. "Sounds great Steve," he says, turning away like that one word wasn't enough to send Steve's heart up into his throat. Steve turns away before he can further embarrass himself, heading back to the kitchen. He really couldn't be acting like this. That man was happily engaged and Steve was a looser with a crush. He had to get himself back under control.
"What's my surprise?" Steve's voice comes out like an innocent enough question, but they both knew he was trying to coax it out of Tony.
She jumps out of her skin, pausing it. "Fuck. Hi.. hey Tony. Sorry. I thought you were Steve." Tony lets out a good natured laugh at her expense.
Tony looks at him, chewing the inside of his cheek. But Steve doesn't know what to say to make anything better. Apparently dissatisfied, Tony turns away and walks out the door, pulling it shut behind him. Steve struggles to pull in a single breath, tears pouring down his face in full force. He knew.. of course he knew this wouldn't be pretty, but he couldn't help but hope. It's hard to have your hopes smashed.
Steve smiles softly, interlacing their other hands once more. "You could. If you want." He gently leans in to kiss Tony, and Tony smiles against his lips. "Let the whole world know you're mine."
She tucks a strand of hair behind her ear. "It's ok I'm just.. startled is all." She stands up. "We should be going though."
"I hope we get it back and something like a normal version of the planet is restored if there ever was such a thing." It was. It was, you did it, Steve wishes he could say. It is back, we got it all back, but it wasn't worth it. Wasn't it though? One man and one woman for half the universe? Wasn't that a fair trade?
"To find a hotel. I need to stay somewhere," he says as if that's the most obvious thing in the world. Maybe it was, to him. He clearly wasn't exactly thinking straight at the moment.
Steve clenched his jaw and tried to move but he remembered that he was restrained. He growled again at the nickname that came out of the kidnappers mouth. No one was allowed to call him that besides the people who were his family and friends. And the way the kidnapper was saying just made his stomach clench and twist with disgust.
Tony left the room and Liam got out from under the covers, grabbed his clothes and heading towards the bathroom. He quickly brushed his teeth and jumped in the shower.
Tony picked up the call and asked, “Steve? It’s a bit late for a call isn’t it. Is everything okay?”
Tony and Steve looked at their son and felt their hearts break. Their son was so insecure about himself.
“Alright, alright. Let’s call him yeah.” Steve said as he tried reassuring his son. Peter nodded his head quickly and clung tighter onto Steve.
Peter continued to cry, not believing that his dad was here. The nightmare he had still in the back of his mind. He squeezed his dad tighter while tears fell down his face.
They both nodded before entering the room. They saw their son laying down while Ned was sitting beside him and holding his hand. They walked forward and when Ned heard the footsteps he looked up.
Peter backed up out of his reach, let out a harsh laugh and turned to the girl sitting next to him. “He’s not single. He’s been dating me for the past 4 months. He asked me out on a date after a long time because we were both so busy and I agreed. I’ve been waiting for him for the past 10 minutes to arrive but I guess he had other plans.” Peter said looking over at Ryan with anger and hurt in his eyes.
Liam looked up at Steve and bit his lip nervously, not knowing how to tell his parents about what had happened.
It took Liam a while to understand what his parents were exactly saying. They weren’t mad, he hadn’t disappointed them and they were upset. And maybe they were right, this wasn’t the end. Yeah sure he got rejected by his top college and he had doubts on whether he could get into any other colleges but they were right. He did have lots of options open for him and maybe he’d find the right one if he kept looking.
Damian’s eyes widened as he saw and heard how his classmates put the blame on him. What did he do to deserve this kind of treatment and why was everyone so against him?
“Hey kiddo. This came in the mail for you.” Steve said passing the envelope to his son and giving him a gentle smile, knowing exactly what was in there.
He rubbed his son’s back as he murmured comforting words to help soothe him. He pulled back, took his son’s hands in his own and started to talk.
Steve and Tony arrived in 10 minutes and saw that there son was waiting for them outside. They got there and before they could get out the car, Peter was running towards them. Tony opened the door and Peter climbed in and began to sob. Tony quickly pulled his son into a hug and wrapped his arms around him. They sat in silence as Steve drove them home and Tony did his best to get Peter to calm down.
It was that time of the year when Liam, Peter and Damian were all due for their yearly check ups. Tony had scheduled an appointment with their own personal doctor ahead of time so they wouldn’t have had to wait for hours. So when Monday afternoon rolled around, Steve and Tony both picked there kids up from school and headed towards the doctors office.
Peter and Damian nodded and made their way to their rooms, grabbing their presents and making their way towards their parents room behind their oldest brother. Peter opened the door as quietly as possible and peeked inside to see if his parents were awake and found that they were still asleep. Damian ran inside and climbed on top of the bed, sitting on Tony’s stomach.
“While we don’t mind it, you need to get your rest so your ankle can heal. How about you guys finish your snack and you rest while Peter and Damian get started on their homework. And then when you wake up, we’ll watch a movie and have dinner. Sounds good?” Tony said.
Both brothers chuckled as their younger brother’s actions as Peter grabbed him by the arms and pressed kisses all over his face. Damian giggled and squealed as Peter attacked him with kisses while Liam watched with a fond smile on his face.
Both Steve and Tony then got up and went to go change and freshen up. They came back and sat down on the couch, taking a couple of slices of the left over pizza and snuggling with their kids as they watched the movie. Liam snuggled into Tony’s side as he felt the pain relievers start to make him droopy. Peter cuddled against Tony’s other side while Damian cuddled up against Steve’s chest. They all watched the movie and Liam sighed in relief when he felt the pain lessen in his hand. He knew it would be awhile before his skin grew back but atleast from now on he would make sure he’d be more careful when he was in the kitchen.
They broke apart when they heard Peter entering the room again to walking his way to Steve’s side and handing him the stuffed bear that he brought. Steve wiped his face and took the bear in his hands.
“I’m sure he’s gonna love it babe. It’ll give him something to do while he heals up. He’s gonna be on bed rest for a while so he’ll definitely enjoy this.” Steve said giving Tony a kiss on his cheek.
Steve flinched but didn’t move and Tony whispered softly to him. Bucky shot Tony an apologized look and Tony shook his head saying that he understood.
“100.8. Not too bad. How about you drink your soup, I’ll give you the medicine and then you can sleep? How does that sound bud?” Steve said.
“I-I don’t k-know.” Peter said as he closed his eyes again and made sure that the nauseous feeling wouldn’t come back up.
“You know bud, we’re always going to be here for you whenever you need us right and that we love you right?” Tony said.
Liam swallowed the lump in his throat. He really thought that they were going strong. He never thought that she would do this to him.
Steve and Tony looked at each other trying to figure out what they should do next. Tony ended up taking the lead and asking Peter a question.
When they finally arrived home, Peter ran into the house, up the stairs and to his room. Steve and Tony followed him, casting each other worrying glances as to what could have happened. Peter threw himself on the bed and cried, his heart hurting at the thought of how someone he loved could do this to him. How someone who he finally thought truly loved him for who he was, would do this. His thoughts were interrupted when his bedroom door was opened and his parents walked in.
Peter nodded his head and went to the board. He grabbed his desk to steady himself as he took the paper and headed towards the board. Mr. Jones eyed his pupil carefully and his frowned deepened a bit when he saw just how distracted Peter was being.
Steve and Tony felt their blood boil at the thought of someone making their son feel that way. Who the hell did this guy think he was calling their son names and telling him that he was a piece of trash? And the nerve of him to cheat on Peter and then tell him this, oh hell no.
“Err, well. I was cooking noodles since we had gotten hungry and my side ended up hitting the handle of the pot. So I was trying to save it from falling but it ended up slipping anyway and it poured over my hand.” Liam explained to his parents.
“We were working on problems and I called everyone up to answer them on the board. Peter came up to the board, worked on the problem and when he was returning back to his seat, he ended up fainting.” Mr. Jones explained.
Liam laid there in Tony’s hold until he fell asleep and soon Steve thought it was best that they all headed to bed. They cleaned up the living area, putting away their games and the cups. He scooped Peter and Damian in his arms, earning him shouts of glees and giggles and he chuckled. They made their way upstairs and Tony headed to his son’s room, tucking him into bed. Steve made Peter and Damian brush their teeth and change into their pajamas before tucking them into bed, kissing their forehead and telling them goodnight. He then made his way to Liam’s room and gave him a kiss on his forehead while Tony went to tell his other two boys goodnight.
Peter looked up at his dad and pouted. He hated it when one of his parents went away for long periods of time. Whether it was for Avengers business or his dad’s company business, he always had a fear in the back of his mind that something would go wrong and he would lose one of them. Of course, Peter being Peter, hadn’t talked to his dad or pops about this because he didn’t want to worry them but the thought was always there whenever something like this would happen. He had lost enough people in his life and he didn’t want to lose his dad or his papa. He wouldn’t know what to do if he lost one or both of them.
Peter hissed at the reddened skin and examined it carefully. He let Liam put his hand back under the cool water while he went to grab the ice. He walked back over to Liam with a ice pack and handed it to him.
Liam trembled in Tony’s hold and they squeezed his hands, letting him know that they were here for him.
Steve bit his lip trying to figure out how he would ask the question. “Um do y-you s-still l-love m-me?”
Tony let out a wet chuckle and brought his youngest son into a hug, burying his face into his shoulder as he rocked them back and forth. He pressed a kiss to his cheek and just held him in his arms while his husband and other two kids held him in theirs. He could hear the reassurances that they were saying. It took him a couple of minutes to calm down and once he was sure that he wasn’t going to break down again, he pulled them apart, giving them all watery smiles.
Peter let the words sink in and he tackled his dad, getting out of Steve’s hold and wrapping his arms around Tony as he buried his face into his dad’s chest and cried. Tony gently rocked them back and forth as he let his son cry, while Steve ran a hand through his son’s hair and held his hand. When he stopped crying, he looked up to his parents and gave them a smile.
“Wake up, please. I need you daddy. I need you and I love you. Please don’t go. Don’t go.” Peter sobbed.
Tony arrived in a matter of time. He quickly dissembled the suit and ran up the stairs to his bedroom.
“Shh, it’s alright bud. I’m okay, you’re okay, we’re all okay. I’m right here kiddo. It’s alright.” Tony spoke to his son softly.
Tony took one glance around to look at his team before telling them all to suit up and head out. They were all about to leave when a video call appeared on the Tower’s cam. The team looked at each other in confusion before Tony went over and picked up the call. The sight that he saw made his heart stop and blood boil.
“No problem kiddo. Just be careful and don’t strain yourself too much. The more you rest, the faster it’ll heal. Also make sure to ice it for a couple of hours each day, that should bring down the swelling and taking Tylenol or Advil should help lessen the pain.” Bruce said.
“Such a good boy you are Pete. Our good boy. So perfect for us. Who owns your pussy baby?” Tony purred out.
Peter quickly responded to the text. Although he didn’t know about what was happening, if it concerned his boyfriend’s family then he understood completely.
Steve and Tony nodded at the explanation, understanding what had happened and that it was just an accident.
“Alright so best thing to do would be to ice it for about 15-20 minutes couple times a day and then I’ll prescribe you some ibuprofen that’s for kids and just take that twice a day. It’s liquid so he won’t have to worry about swallowing. Give it about 2-3 weeks to heal, alright?” Bruce said taking out the medication that he had prescribed and passing it to Tony.
“I’m sorry bud.” Tony spoke and Liam buried his face into his dad’s shoulder and released a shaky breath. Steve looked over with worry and concern but Tony just shook his head and Steve didn’t say anything.
“I want all of you to back the fuck away from my family right this second. I want all pictures deleted from your damn cameras and phones and I want you gone in the next 30 seconds.” Steve said, staring at them with a fierce look in his eyes.
Steve shivered at the thought of what might happen next. He was praying to god that someone would notice that he was gone and that they would come and save him.
Entering the living room, they took in the scene. Peter and Damian were laying on the ground, coloring books, crayons, markers and colored pencils littered the floor, a tv show was playing in the background and they were both coloring and giggling at what they were watching. Tony and Steve smiled at the scene in front of them and headed towards the kitchen to warm up dinner.
“Daddy, daddy, daddy, oh god.” Peter moaned and arched his back as he felt the vibrating sensation travel all throughout his body.
Bruce nodded his head and went outside to send Peter in. When Peter entered the medical wing he quickly rushed to where his papa was lying.
The teacher then got all of the students attention and started to teach class. He handed out a worksheet for them to complete while he took attendance.
Steve clenched his teeth to stop himself from screaming and tried to move away but he couldn’t. Tears streamed down his eyes as he felt the blade of the scalpel pierce his skin. His captivator kept on pressing the knife or blade, whatever it was into his skin and Steve couldn’t do anything about it.
Steve and Tony woke up like any other school day. Steve went downstairs to the kitchen to prepare his kids their breakfast while Tony woke up their 3 kids. He headed towards his oldest son’s room, opening the door, quietly stepping in and making his way towards his bed.
Tony and Steve pulled the vibrator away and ran their hands along the puffy lips of Peter’s pussy. God they were so ready to stuff his hole with their cocks. Peter let himself calm down from the intense orgasm as he waited for his parents to get into their position. Steve and Tony sat with their legs looped around each other’s back. Their cocks brushed up against each other’s and they let out a groan. Steve grabbed the lube and coated both his and Tony’s cock, while Tony fingered Peter with lube to make sure that he open enough to take their cocks.
Apologies if it’s not good enough and it took so long to write. It’s just been a shitty week and it messed up my mood and I didn’t feel like writing.
“Oh my god. Pops, this is, this is amazing. Oh my god. I love it. Thank you guys. All of this stuff is incredible.” Liam said.
Liam chuckled fondly at Damian’s actions and picked him up, carrying him to Peter’s room. He opened the door and made his way over to Peter’s bed as he sat Damian down while gently pulling back the covers, brushing the hair out from his face and shaking his shoulders.
He got outside and looked around to see that everything was done and that everyone was waiting for them. He gave them a huge smile and nodded.
“No, I’m good. Thanks pops.” Peter said as he got up and checked to make sure he had everything while he waited for his dad.
Tony and Steve loved their son more than anyone could imagine. They spoiled him so much, fulfilling all of his wishes and making sure that he was always happy. They wanted to make sure that he got everything he always wanted as long as they got to see his big smile and the twinkle in his eyes. Peter trusted his parents a lot and was always very open with them, seeking praises, affection and reassurance from them. But it wasn’t only just emotional reassurances but also sexual.
Everyone tightened their grip on Tony and Steve began to assure him that nobody was going to leave him.
“W-where’s dad? Where is h-he? W-why isn’t he h-h-here?” Peter hiccuped as tears ran down his cheeks.
Liam chuckled, giving one more kiss to his little brother’s cheek and let him sit on his lap, wrapping an arm around him to keep him steady.
“It does buddy, it does. You start realizing that they weren’t worth it and that in the future, you’ll find someone who loves you for who you are and will always be there for you. But you still have a while before you get there so don’t rush it.” Tony said.
The captivator was so intrigued in watching the torture he was impending on Steve that he didn’t hear a voice from behind.
And with that Peter waited until it was time for him to go. He was just finishing up tidying his room when he heard his door handle turn and saw his dad peak inside.
So here they were now, sitting on the park bench as they watched their son play in the small sandbox that was built within the playground. They both chuckled as they watched Peter dump the sand on himself and then giggle with delight, trying to bury himself in a pile of sand while failing miserably.
“Mr. Stark Rogers, Mr. Greens, I’ve called you in here today because your children ended up getting in a fight. And according to the students that were present in the room, they say that Damian started the fight.” The principal said.
Peter stood in front of the mirror as he adjusted his tie and fixed his hair. He was going on a date with his boyfriend and he was glad that they had finally gotten some time together for themselves.
Peter looked down between his legs and moaned at the sight. Both of his parents were between his legs, their mouths ghosting over his mound. They took their hands and spread apart his moist lips, gently running a thumb across his folds.
“Guys Jarvis picked up a location on where Steve could be. Sending coordinates now.” Tony spoke into his com link.
“There we go, all done.” Dr. Richards announced as he finished putting the band-aid on him and disposed the needle.
Tony grabbed the lube and drizzled it over Peter’s mound and then spread it around with his fingers to make sure that it covered the whole area.
“Hey, it’s alright buddy. You’re okay. We got you bud. You’re alright.” Steve said as he gently rocked his son back and forth in his arms and rubbed his back.
Peter kept walking further until something hit his foot and he stopped. He looked down to see what he had bumped into and froze.
Peter nodded his head and Tony carried him up to their room. Steve went and grabbed 3 bowls of ice cream and then went up the stairs to find his husband and son in bed while Peter was buried into Tony’s side, a random movie playing. Steve handed both of them a bowl and gave them a smile. He grabbed his own and sat down on the other side Peter as they enjoyed their ice cream.
“Let’s go see what your brothers are doing and then we’ll have dinner.” Tony got up and Steve and Liam followed behind.
Ned quickly helped his teacher and grabbed Peter. He put his arm around Peter’s waist and put Peter’s around his neck while he and Mr. Jones did the same with Peter. They both carried him to the nurse’s office.
Liam shook his head and the doctor nodded, writing it down in the folder. He looked at it one more time to see if he missed anything and once he was done he closed the folder the set it aside.
“I promise you that you haven’t disappointed us, we’re not mad at you and we aren’t upset with you at all. We love you buddy and you gotta understand that this isn’t the end. You have so many options opened for you and like we said, we’ll be happy and proud of you wherever you get accepted into to.” Steve said.
One of them cornered Tony, pressing up against him, touching him and Tony started to feel uncomfortable. He could practically feel the man breathing down his neck and his hands traveling somewhere that Tony wished was just some hallucination that he was having. He clenched his jaw when he felt a hand grab his butt and stopped himself from doing something that would not end well.
“Sure babe.” Tony said walking over to the cupboard and grabbing the plates and then making his way towards the table to set it.
Steve woke up early like any other day and got out of bed. He looked over at his husband and saw that he was still asleep and smiled. He planted a kiss to Tony’s head before getting changed into comfortable clothing so he could go on his run. Steve made his way downstairs and entered the kitchen and was surprised to see his oldest son already sitting at the breakfast table looking at the bowl in front of him. He looked at the time and saw that he still had two more hours before school started. He made his way over and gently put a hand on his shoulder which caused Liam to jump.
Steve smiled giving Tony a kiss back before making his way up the stairs and heading towards Damian’s room. He opened the room and stepped inside, making his way towards the bed and sat down on it. He gently pulled the covers back and started to rub his son’s back while gently coaxing him to wake up.
Damian stared at Steve before putting his head down and covering himself up with the blankets which made Steve chuckle.
Laughs erupted through the air as they raced against each other. Sometimes Steve would end up taking the lead while other times Liam would. They continued their run as they still had a bit to go before they were going to run back home. It was at one moment when Liam wasn’t looking ahead and paying attention because his eyes were focused on something else, that he ended up tripping and falling. His foot collided with the rock, ended up twisting and he cried out at the pain, falling down to the ground. Steve stopped quickly when he heard the noise and turned around to see what had happened. He saw Liam on the ground and ran his way over to him.
“Okay, okay. Oh my god. Is he okay? I’m on my way right now.” Tony said as he quickly went upstairs to tell his husband.
After everyone had signed his cast, they ate their snacks and made their way up to their rooms. Liam laid on the couch in a comfortable position and before he knew it he was asleep. Tony draped a blanket over him, pressed a kiss to his head and left the room so he could let his son rest.
Tony’s bottom lip quivered. He took a deep breath to calm himself down, trying his best to get rid of the tears that kept on filling his eyes.
Tony placed the crockpot of pasta in the middle of the table while Steve and Peter went to get the water jug and glasses. They began digging in and Liam tried his best to keep the food down and the nauseous feeling at bay. Once he felt that he couldn’t eat anymore, he put his fork down and pushed the plate away, grabbing his water and drinking it.
Peter and Damian looked at both of their parents and then each other. Liam watched his parents handle his brothers in silence.
Liam nodded and headed upstairs going to his room to get a change of clothes and then to the bathroom to shower.
Bruce nodded his head before entering their room. Steve snapped his eyes up when he heard the door open.
“He was for a couple of minutes until he fell asleep again on the way home. He has a fever and said that his head and throat were hurting.” Tony informed Bruce.
Damian sighed again and rolled his eyes as he waited for their coach to start class and tell them what they were doing.
It was another special day in the Stark-Rogers household. It was Peter’s 15th birthday and they were all excited for this day. Peter woke up that morning with a big smile on his face, got ready and made his way downstairs. As soon as he got down he was bombarded with happy birthdays.
Liam whimpered at the question and ran over to the sink, turning on the faucet and putting his hand under it. He sighed in relief when the cool water ended up soothing his skin. Peter turned off the stove and then walked over to where Liam was and put a hand on his shoulder. Liam jumped a bit and looked up at his brother before looking back down.
Steve and Tony glanced at each other, worry and sadness clearly showing on their faces and in their eyes. Tony pulled Liam back into a hug and Steve joined as well.
Steve and Tony moaned at the splash of wetness that squirted out of their son and how his hole was clenching around their fingers. They fingered two more orgasms out of him before letting him calm down from his high.
Liam helped Peter set the board up, placing all the pieces in the box and putting it in the middle where it would be accessible. They explained the game to everyone and then started.
“I made you some soup. Hopefully that’ll help you feel better. But I’m going to check your temperature first okay?” Steve said.
“Steve there is no way in hell we’re going to let you cook dinner alone.” Bucky said putting his hands on his hips.
Tony frowned even harder, sat his cup down on the table and helped his husband carry Liam down to the lab. Once they got there, Tony saw Bruce hooking up the x-ray machine and made his way over.
The man chuckled and said, “let’s see how long it takes for you to find me Stark. While you do that, I’ll have a little fun with your husband.”
Peter mumbled in his sleep and rolled over to the other side of the bed while clutching the blankets. Tony chuckled at his actions. There was always a challenge in trying wake up his kids for school.
“If you think your gonna get away with this, then you’re in for a treat. You won’t make it out alive once I find you.” Tony said growling at the man on the screen.
Liam took a deep breath, trying to calm himself. “We were….we were just having a date night. We had dinner and were watching a movie when she just climbed over onto…onto my lap and started….g-grinding against m-me. And I…I told h-her to stop but she w-wouldn’t so I-I tried pushing her o-off of me but she g-grabbed my c-..down….down t-there. I didn’t…I didn’t w-want it but s-she wouldn’t s-stop.”
Peter nodded his head and gave his uncle a smile. Bruce then said his goodbyes so that Peter could rest and Tony and Steve thanked him one more time.
“Tony.” Steve said, cupping his face in his hands and making him look up. He gently wiped away the tears and looked him straight in the eyes.
The pizza was delivered in 15 minutes and they all ended up enjoying. Damian’s laughs filled the room along with everyone else’s and the family was glad to see their youngest smiling and laughing again.
Damian bit his lip at his coach’s words and left returning back to where he was playing. He grabbed a ball that he saw wasn’t being used and tried his best to stay away from them.
“Yeah, your ankle definitely has a fracture kiddo. We’re gonna put it in a cast so it can heal which will take up to about 6 weeks.” Bruce said.
Steve carefully looked at the bruising and Liam ended up hissing out when there was pressure applied to the spot.
“He came home a couple of minutes ago from his girlfriend’s house, hugged me and I could feel him trembling. I asked him if something was wrong but he didn’t say anything. Also his smile didn’t reach his eyes and I’m really worried.” Steve told him.
Steve hummed at the answer and ruffled his son’s hair, checking his temperature with his hand to make sure that he didn’t have a fever. Parental instincts, what can you say. He sighed in relief when he didn’t feel his forehead to be hot before asking his son a question.
Peter wailed out at all the yelling and clicks of the camera and hid himself behind his father’s legs.
“Tony, Peter had a nightmare and a really bad one. Can you please tell him that you’re okay?” Steve said.
Steve flinched and whimpered, and Tony pulled him closer while looking the direction of where Clint and Thor were holding him and growled.
Peter squinted his eyes and looked at Liam and then said, “right, having a cast on your foot is definitely not a big deal.”
Prompts for this story can range from: family fluff, hurt/comfort, bullying, protective family members, nightmares, etc. All ideas are welcomed.
Liam snapped his mouth shut and look down at his hands. His eyes started to water and he bit his lips to stop himself from crying out. He didn’t know why this was affecting him so much.
Peter laughed as the pout on his brother’s face before saying, “nope, I don’t think so kiddo. We definitely love you more.”
Peter woke up feeling dizzy and hot. His throat felt scratchy, his limbs felt sore and he felt like a truck had run over him. He looked at the time and groaned, knowing that it was time for school. He shakily got up and sat on the bed, taking a deep breath to stop the feeling of nausea creeping up from his stomach. He made his way to the bathroom and as soon as he stepped inside, he felt the bile come up his throat and he ran towards the toilet. He slid on his knees and began to retch, feeling his stomach convulse as he puked up what he had ate last night. When there wasn’t anything left, he took a shaky breath and leaned against the wall.
Steve blinked his eyes opened, trying to take in his surroundings. He tried to speak but he couldn’t because there was a gag in his mouth. He tried to move but found that he had been restrained to a table. He tried to calm himself down but could feel the panic growing in his chest. Suddenly he heard a voice and he froze, feeling the fear crawl up his throat but he swallowed it down.
“Bye babe, stay safe please. Love you.” Steve said as he pecked his husband’s cheek and the corner of his mouth.
Once he got home, he took another deep breath and made his way inside. His whole body felt shaky as he tried his best to keep himself composed. The feeling of her hand around him made him shiver and a lump grew in his throat again. He walked inside to see his papa in the kitchen and his dad and brothers playing a video game. He really wanted a hug after what had transpired minutes ago. Making his way to where his papa was at, he looped his arms around Steve’s waist and buried himself into his papa’s back.
“Liam just got a letter from the college that he applied to and we’re waiting to see if he’s gotten accepted.” Steve said.
“God Steve you scared the shit out of me. I’m so sorry I didn’t get to you sooner babe. I’m so so so sorry I failed you.” Tony said.
“Alrighty then. Just going to ask you a couple of basic questions and then we’ll get to the routine checkup. Sound good?” Dr. Richards asked.
“Good morning. Need any help?” He asked as he put his chin on Steve’s shoulder as he watched him cook.
Lia led Peter to a table and sat there while he waited for Ryan to arrive. He ordered a glass of juice while he waited for his boyfriend’s arrival.
Tony made his way towards his son, crouching down in front of him, cupping his face in his hands, pulling it up so that he could see his face, taking his hand and pulling it away from his nose and clenching his teeth when he saw the damage. He hissed when he felt his son flinch as he gently touched the nose. Definitely broken.
“Alright then. Next I’m just going to check your heartbeat.” He said, placing the stethoscope on his chest.
Steve took Liam’s face in his hands. “Did she touch you anywhere else that you didn’t want to be touched?”
“We’ll talk with her tomorrow okay bud. Me and pops will be right there with you if something happens.” Tony said.
“Sir, I guarantee you that we have strict policies against bullying and-“ the principal started before being cut off.
Tony pulled his son in a hug before explaining that Steve had told him that he would be at the tower by 4pm. He said it would only take him about 20-30 minutes and now it’s been over 3 hours.
Mr. Jones nodded his head and said, “alright, great. You’ll have an hour to complete the problems and if you are struggling, please do ask for help. The other 30 minutes of class, I’ll call each of you up one by one and ask you to complete the problems on the board and explain what you did to get your answer. Is that understood?” Mr. Jones said.
Liam sighed, his stomach still churning with guilt. He heard footsteps coming into the kitchen and looked up to see his youngest brother.
Hi guys, hope you’re all doing well. Sorry for being inactive, I sorta kinda lost interest in my writing but I’ve decided to start again with a different prompt.
“Everything looks great and you’re all healthy. There’s just one more thing left. Peter and Damian are due for vaccines as well so I’m just going to administer those and then you’ll be done.” Dr. Richards.
Tony turned around to see his husband and other two kids standing there looking at them. Steve quickly made his way towards his son and looked at his face.
Liam had been in a relationship with his girlfriend, Lilly for 5 months and everything was going great. They had went on cute little dates, spent their time doing activities that they loved and showered each other with treats. She lived alone in her own apartment while Liam lived with his dads and brothers. Some days they would spend their time at hers, some days at his and other days they would go out and have fun. Right now they were both snuggled up on the couch, dinner out of the way and watching a movie because they didn’t know what else to do. Lilly snuggled up closer to Liam and he rubbed her arm, bringing her as close as he could. They watched the movie but as they came to the ending Lilly became bored. She climbed over Liam and sat down on his lap and began to grind against him.
Peter murmured in his sleep and turned away from Liam which caused his brother to roll his eyes at his actions.
Peter let out a hiccup as he listened to everything his dad was telling him. Tony maneuvered himself so he lying against the headboard. He and Steve got under the covers and pulled them over Peter. They both gently ran their hands up and down his back and through his hair. Peter started to calm down and he listened to his dad’s heartbeat knowing that he was with him. He sniffled a bit before burying himself farther into his dad’s hold. Tony laid down and turned so Peter was in between the both of them. Steve snuggled even closer to his son and wrapped his arm around the both of them. They both rubbed his back and whispered reassurances telling him that “everything was okay”, “they were alright” and that “they loved him.”
When Liam didn’t get a reply, he frowned. That’s weird. Dad always replied no matter how busy he is.
Tony looked at his son one more before nodding his head. He knew in the back of his head that Peter was hiding something but he chose not to comment on it. Peter got out of the car, waved goodbye to his dad and walked inside the school
Now that surprised both Tony and Steve. They never thought that their youngest son would voluntarily ask to get checked by the doctor but nonetheless they were happy to see that he was being so brave.
Everyone’s eyes filled with fear as the Captain’s voice cut through the air. They pulled out all of their devices and deleted all the pictures of Peter and Tony from their phones. When that was done, Steve gave them one last stare before saying, “if any of those pictures leak out anywhere I swear I will make your life hell. Got it?”
“You seemed perfectly willing at the time sir.” Tony stuck his tongue out and reached for his drink. “And Sir, may I suggest that you not show up intoxicated for your first religious experience in at least 30 years.”
Steve and Thor had taken over the second half of the room and were engaged in epic combat.  Thor nearly drove Steve through the floor with a windmill of an overhead blow.  The impact took Steve to his knees his every muscle straining to hold off Thor’s fist.  The fight looked to be over.  Steve was quicker than Thor though and he managed to roll out from under the crushing force and send Thor stumbling toward the wall.
A smile lit up Tony’s face.  Steve wasn’t sure if it was because he used Jarvis or just that he was happy to see him.
“Lets go.”Tony said. “more things to see” Steve waved goodbye to Bruce and followed Tony through the rest of the common area.
“You move an’ I’ll nail your dick to the ground with an arrow” he said lowering his aim to the boy’s crotch.  Steve remembered what Natasha said about the car incident and grimaced.
He was waiting for the postman two days later and nearly ripped the letter out of his hands before running upstairs. This one wasn’t a postcard but a sealed envelope.
Tony walked over to Steve and placed his hands on his arms.  “Steve, I haven’t even heard you say the words come out yet, you blush and look embarrassed every time someone mentions it. If you aren’t ready the media will eat you alive, they will try to anyway.  If you aren’t sure don’t do it because you can’t take that back.”
“Sir?” Jarvis’s voice cut through his music and he sighed. It was bad enough that the Stark phone prototypes the SI engineers had sent him were so bad he had decided it would be more productive to start from scratch, but just as he was starting to like the circuit board layout projected in front of him he was interrupted.
When bucky died he sat there in disbelief, he had known no one was guaranteed to survive to their soul day but he had let himself see their far dated tattoos as some kind of assurance that they would wait for their soul mates together.
Tony walked in to the living room after pulling an all-nighter in the lab.  He hadn’t meant to stay up all night, but he owed Stark Industries R&D a new concept on an electric car.  Normally such a simple design would have only taken an hour or two, but Tony had been too busy acting like an idiot high schooler, pining and daydreaming, to get anything useful done.  Steve was engrossed in a game of Risk with Natasha and Clint and seemed to be giving serious contemplation to how to best take Canada.  All other eyes in the room seemed to be on him.  He rolled his eyes.  He should just give up on keeping secrets in his life between the paparazzi and living with spies it was a lost cause.   Tony grabbed coffee and retreated to his room to change clothes.
“Yeah, spill.” She agreed. Clint made what looked like a particularly obscene sign and Natasha chucked a throw pillow at him.
“Sit this one out.” He told him already running towards the situation room where his suit was kept. “Jarvis tap security cameras and let authorities know we are on our way.” He looked back at Tony who seemed to be frozen half way between sitting and standing.
“Hey,” He put his hand on Tony’s cheek and turned his head to face him. “None of that has anything to do with who you are now.  And even if it did I’d still want you to be the one I do this with.” He brushed his thumb across Tony’s cheekbone and marveled at the way even that small intimacy felt so significant.
Tony longed to pull Steve into his lap so that he was straddling him.  He longed to unbutton Steve’s shirt one button at a time and use every dirty trick he knew to make him shiver and blush.
Tony hadn’t looked at his mark in two weeks, but he had known it was coming, and if he got up on the morning of May 3rd and spent a little extra time on his morning routine, well he was only human. Even he couldn’t help but have a little hope for true love. He was just finishing brushing his teeth, for an unreasonably long amount of time when Jarvis addressed him over the loudspeaker.
Steve beat Clint three rounds to none the next morning but Clint made Steve promise that he’d have a go at the archery range.
Thor arrived with a crack of lightening and a five minute spell of torrential rain that sent New Yorkers running for cover.  Steve watched as Natasha walked out to greet him.  He enveloped her in a bear hug that lifted her over six inches off the ground.  He walked in to the common area and clapped Steve on the back hard enough it actually hurt.
of 2008.  Even though Steve felt bad for Bucky he was a little relieved that they were looking at the same prospect of a lonely life.
By the time he returned to the living room Clint had already lost all his territory and was sitting on the couch grumpily looking at his smartphone.
“What’s up, Tony?” He wheezed.  He rolled up on to his hands and knees and slowly got up and walked over to his water bottle.
Some people said they could feel when the date changed, a little tickle or sting.  Tony’s nanny as called it ‘the strings of fate weaving together’ Others said they could always fell a small amount of warmth radiating from their mark.  Tony’s was always cold and numb compared to the skin around it.
She’d laughed. “I’m not far from it.”  She’s said, then her eyes had lost focus and when she looked at him again she called for the nurse and told her she was seeing ghosts.
Thor was victorious, not that anyone expected differently.  He claimed the last of the dumplings as his prize and he and Natasha gloated with every bite.  Steve spent the rest of the evening smiling when the situation required it, and trying to imagine himself content with a life with no plan and no war to win.
The door pinged and slid open and Steve Rogers cautiously stepped out.  The sarcastic words Tony had planned died on his lips.  Steve only had a duffel bag and the shield which was treaded through its strap.  As he stepped out of the elevator he seemed small, he looked scared.  His fingers brushed the edge of his shield as he looked around taking in the floor to ceiling glass windows, all of which had various data and information projected on to them in real time.  None of this was what stopped Tony from saying something.  What stopped him were the bags he noticed under Steve’s eyes and the way he pinched his lips together between his teeth as he actively held his chin high. He’d seen that look too many times in the mirror after he had returned from Afghanistan.  When he had spent days working up to touching the arc reactor and months trying to get used to the literal hole in his chest.   He remembered how he had felt back then, like someone trying to fix porcelain with scotch tape while the whole world shrieked at him for breaking it in the first place.  He knew that even a touch of hostility now would be cruelty.  He waved his hands and all of the data on the windows cleared.
Exactly one week after he and Tony had initially discussed making their relationship public, and thusly his coming out, Steve made his way down to Tony’s lab.  He didn’t flinch when Jarvis asked him what floor he wanted to go to in the elevator and was a little bit proud about that.
“I don’t know. Why is it that you are always getting knocked out in fights?”  He helped Tony to his feet.
Steve grabbed him by the collar of his shirt and crashed their lips back together. Tony let him keep up the brutally quick pace for a minute or two before pulling back.  He slowed down to the point that it was nearly unbearable simply to see what Steve would do.  He gently pulled Steve’s lower lip between his teeth and rubbed the tip of his nose gently against Steve’s. Steve rested his hand on Tony’s chest and he barely noticed how numb the scar tissue felt.
“You want coffee? I want coffee.” Tony said suddenly and darted off in to the next room. Minutes later he dashed back in and pressed a steaming cup of coffee in to Steve’s hands.  Tony took a sip from his own cup and sighed happily.
“Yeah.”  He put a hand under Tony’s chin and pressed their lips back together. For a moment the kiss stayed a gentle grazing of lips before Steve got up the courage to gently suck at Tony’s bottom lip.  Tony breathed in sharply and his hand slid behind Steve’s neck.  He let Steve pull him closer till his legs were slung across Steve’s lap and their feet tangled on the floor.  Tony slid his tongue into Steve’s mouth and slid it across the front of his teeth. Steve sighed.  To his embarrassment it turned in to a small moan. Tony smiled against Steve’s cheek.
“Just be honest” Natasha said. “And just so we are clear, despite what Barton says, Lord of the Rings is the defining series in fantasy.  Not Harry Potter.”
Wine was brought, and dinner was served and even though Steve knew he should be impressed by the meal but he was too busy appreciating how when Tony laughed and meant it he snorted and how he tilted his head ever so slightly when he was being sarcastic.
“Ha-ha!” Clint sprung up and began doing a victory dance on the couch cushion. “I just hit a million followers on Instagram!”
Tony tossed the keys at the valet and wrapped an arm around Steve’s waist as they entered the restaurant.  It was fancier than anything Steve had ever seen.  A hostess led them to the back corner table. Steve looked around nervously.  There was more silverware on the table setting than he knew what to do with.
“Thanks, Tony.” Steve said he rested his hand on Tony’s shoulder for a second before leaving the lab.  Tony was already engrossed in whatever he was doing on his tablet by the time the door shut.
Steve declared an official team training session necessary, which was fine, theoretically.  What was not fine was that he scheduled it for six in the morning.  Tony had been willing to forgive him for that even, until Steve had mentioned that it was going to be all hand to hand combat. No suits, no weapons allowed.
“No shit,” Clint said gesturing about the training room. “Look, just wait till he gets here then it will be easier to figure out.
Tony drove and the traffic lights always seemed to turn in their favor.  After the second red light in a row seemed to inexplicably change before Steve’s eyes he began to suspect some meddling was involved on Tony’s part.
“How’d things go?” He tossed a bottle to Steve. Natasha was hunched over her tea cup inhaling the fumes.
An hour later Steve headed to the lab holding the largest mug in the tower, full to the brim with disgustingly dark coffee.  Jarvis let him in before he had to ask.  Angry rock music blared from the sound system Tony was hunched over a work bench poking at a circuit board.  Tony saw him and waved for the music to turn off.  Steve notice that Tony had both coffee cups sitting on the work bench, both empty.
“You sure he’s not just masturbating Jarvis?” Tony flipped the page to find a photo of him and Steve kneeling next to each other shoulders touching in the pew.
Live footage followed Steve as he rushed through the halls of the tower. A group of three super powered individuals were attempting to rob a bank.  Clint appeared to have them pinned down with suppressing fire.
“Couch then.” He pulled Tony to his feet.  “You need sleep.” Tony didn’t resist but he didn’t help either. He fell forward until Steve caught him.  Steve wrapped his arm around Tony’s waist and slowly shuffled him over the couch. He sat Tony down slowly. He then unlaced Tony’s shoes and set them at the end of the couch. He had done the same countless time for Bucky both before and during the war.
He beat Natasha three to two.  After that fewer men showed up trying to prove something and he was bored enough that he almost missed them.
“Cap!” Tony said by way of greeting.  He was now the level of drunk where he should most definitely not drive a car and his friends could tell because he was noticeably more agreeable than he ever was when sober or caffeinated.  Steve picked his way around the lab’s eternal mess and eventually found his way to Tony at the center.
He then headed into the city towards Avengers tower.  He wasn’t quite ready to call it home. Though he was willing to think that one day he could.
Tony led him over to the mat and sat him down.  He plucked an expansive first aid kit off the wall. He began wiping blood away with alcohol wipes that didn’t seem big enough.  After a moment he switched to a water bottle and a towel that someone had left on the mat. The smaller abrasions were scabbing over but the center right knuckle was split to the bone. Tony knew that Steve would heal within a few days so he didn’t bother to stitch it he just gently placed gauze over it and wound a bandage around Steve’s hand which was swollen to the point he struggled to take it out of a fist.
“Don’t override it Jarvis.” Pepper called out as she tried to pick her way through the mess of open boxes and uncoiled extension cords.  Dummy stopped moving towards the coffee pot and again picked up the duster.
Steve’s jaw clenched.  He stood up and walked out of the room without saying a word. Natasha smacked Clint across the back of the head.  He looked confused for half a second then realized what he had done.
“I already got a few bruises, thanks.” Tony said.  “I saw you going toe to toe with a literal god over there. I don’t think I need and of that.”
Bruce showed up a few minutes later and tried not to look too put upon when Thor made his request.  They barely managed to all squeeze into the frame.  Thor snapped the photo and they all leaned in to observe.
“You can go back to sleep in a second,” Steve said, he handed Tony the water glass and two pills. And prompted him to raise them to his mouth.  “You’re gonna feel like shit in a few hours no matter what but this might help.”
“What is a hickey?” Steve sounded as though he knew it was something dirty.  Tony could see a hint of a bush dusting his cheekbones.
Steve only glanced at the pictures. Before he swatted them away.  He was grateful that they disappeared when he did.  While Steve was slightly annoyed that Tony had clearly pre-prepared this counterargument, he mostly felt sad that this was something which Tony judged himself by.
Steve woke up in the future, to bright lights and a room where everything seemed just a little off. He looked down at his arm and his soul mark was still there, bold as ever.  He felt a moment of relief but then I hit him, he knew the batter was going to strike out before the pitch was thrown, he had watched this game. He ran. Hours later after processing what the agents had told him, that he was in the future. That the world was a different place now he looked down at his arm and realized his soul day was only a few months away. He should have felt happy but all he felt was dread. He was a broken man now and his soulmate didn’t deserve that either, wherever they were.
“The safe word’s stop.” He said only half joking.  Steve brought both hands up to comb through Tony’s hair and kissed him, which Tony took as permission to continue.  He traced his lips over Steve’s chin and found a place where jaw met neck in a particularly compelling way. Tony began to suck at the skin, gently at first.  When Steve didn’t object he ran his teeth against the spot that was already red and redoubled his effort.  He felt Steve breathe in sharply.  He pulled away tongue tingling from the effort.   He sat back to take in view of Steve face bright red, pupils completely blown.  The picturesque sky blue from earlier was gone, replaced by a look Tony was more familiar with.
He tried to get back up to the radio but his leg gave out with enough pain to make him vomit. Peggy was calling his name over the radio sounding more and more desperate.  He knew that even if they told he told them he was alive they wouldn’t get there in time.
“Hey Steve! Come beat Natasha at arm wrestling for me! Tony called. Steve rolled his eyes. Thor grinned.
“I need coffee and a shower.” Tony wiped away sweat that was beading in his goatee. “Definitely in that order.”
Tony was sitting on the couch barefoot.  Thai food sat unopened on the coffee table.  He was scrolling through his tablet but looked up when Steve entered.  Tony stood up and smiled.
’ Steve hurled the shield at Tony’s shoulder missing his neck by inches. It had the intended effect though one of the rockets flared up from inside its slot it the suit knocking Tony forward and the boy backwards at the same time.  Clint rushed forward and aimed his bow at the kid.
“Your request is noted sir.” The disembodied voice said. Tony stuck his tongue out at the wall and Steve decided that even though he was brilliant he was definitely not sane, even by the superhero standard.
“Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.”  Tony straightened the knuckles gently and taped another layer of gauze over to worst of the damage.  “Let’s get out of here. I need your advice on the new comm design.”
“There is no good or evil, only weak minded men.” there was pure deviousness in Natasha’s voice. “Clint’s the loser so he gets to make breakfast.”
Natasha looked up from what she was reading and quirked an eyebrow at him.  Steve smiled sheepishly.
Bruce had quietly retreated to his favorite armchair. “When you are ready to come out though.” He looked directly at Steve. “It’s going to mean a hell of a lot to LGBT kids everywhere to have a literal hero they can look up to that’s like them.”
Tony had chucked a tablet at Steve and told him it was time to catch up on pop culture.  He had then rambled something about dinner with Pepper and left Steve to watch movies.  He had filled several pages of his notebook an in the process decided he understood less about the future than he thought.  He felt like he was in a wind tunnel trying to pick up people whispering to him.  There was just so much and every answer came with new questions.  He wandered through the kitchen looking back through the little notebook. Thus far his list included the words: face book, selfie, mp3, Survivor, X-box, hipster, sharknado, Dodgers not in New York?!?!?!?!?!, and Kardashians.  He also had jotted down a few recommendations Clint had thrown at him upon seeing the list while gulping down the eggs and sausage that had been abandoned on the table hours previously.
"It wasn't him." Steve is sure he looks pathetic, sitting here with fresh tears streaming down his face.
"Classified," She says, squeezing Steve's arm. He would be insulted if he hadn't been willing to straight up tell her. It was important that the plan went off without a hitch, and interference from SHIELD would be a really big fucking hitch.
"That's true. He has been photographed intimately with several members of the same sex over the years."
"Oh yeah. I only worked under him for a couple of years though. Then it was mine and I pretty much gutted it. He worked on the Manhattan project, and I work on sustainability mostly." Tony scans it and hands it back. "Any spot?"
"We can't thank you enough, Howard. It sounds like you need to get to your wife, though, so don't let us keep you." Steve says.
"Yeah." Steve gives Natasha a telling look and a small shrug. Her eyes conveyed a similar message: the sooner Howard was out of their hair, the sooner they could start.
"Yes. Right. Yes." Tony slips his eyes shut. "Ok. I'll cauterize it then, and then I can bandage it up with.. back at the wreck."
She bites her lip, swiveling in her chair to face him. "I want to try to find my dad. My family. I have a name, that's it. Ivan Romanoff—"
Nine months into their infiltration, Captain America is the news on everyone's mind. More importantly, that Howard Stark had found him, and sent a team to the Arctic to explore the fallen Valkyrie before removing what was believed to be his remains from where they were frozen. Clearly though, that was a front presented by Howard to explain why he wasn't going to thaw him right away. To Steve and Nat, it was a poorly veiled call for them to reach out and tell him what to do, how to explain all this to Steve.
Steve laughs as soon as they're gone, and Natasha quickly follows suit. "From all Tony's stories, I woulda thought him a dead beat," Nat says, once she catches her breath.
"I don't think anyone wants my actual genes. If I had kids, I honestly don't know if they'd pop out tiny and asthmatic or hopped up on baby serum."
You know, Steve’s shield is actually listed as “the new shield” in the script, so if you were wondering, he actually probably did it get from Howard again
Well.. the gift was already wrapped, so there wasn't really any harm in that. And clearly Tony needed some supervision right about now. "Okay baby. Come on." Steve pulls him up off the couch, the blanket coming too, slung around his shoulders. "It's gonna be alright.
"Can you repeat that for me?" Tony asks smugly, gently stroking himself a few times to take the edge off.
"Oh that's okay," she straightens up, and he finally gets a good look at her, closing Bucky's door. "Oh, hey Steve. It's been too long."
Tony shuts his eyes. "You've gotta study kid." Yes. Yes he wanted to watch Monty Python, what the hell kind of question was that.
Steve nods, pushing the cart up next to the display cart. "Thank you." Indeed, the chefs help him assemble the towering cake onto the cart, the fondant flowers complimenting the cloth nicely. "Does the cake have a place where it should be?" Steve asks the chefs, glancing around.
"Nat. That's not.. important to me, ok. If we ever get there, I'm more then okay with adoption." He rubs her arm soothingly.
"No buts. Do you think Tony could've given me biological children? That's not why I loved him and it's not why I love you. Most importantly, it's not the only reason to fall in love, ok? I promise."
“Yeah, Thanks for that one.” Tony walked in to the room. He had finally managed to negotiate his was out of the mangled armor with the help of several robotic arms.
Clint declared that they should celebrate with takeout and beer.  Steve managed to convince Tony to come out of the lab and they all sat around the coffee table waiting for the delivery to show up.  Chinese food was eaten and the evening devolved in to Tony and Natasha competing to see how many shrimp they could throw in to Clint’s mouth in a row.  Natasha was slightly drunk, Tony had abstained claiming the title of “designated Avenger” of the evening, so she was only beating him by a factor of two.  They had called on Bruce to judge.
Steve headed to the common area to make breakfast a little earlier than usual and heard heavy feet stomping down the hall ahead of him. Followed by an unintelligible mumble. He turned the corner to find Tony in what must have at one point been a well put together suit but now it was untucked and what looked suspiciously like pizza sauce was smeared over the tails.  He turned around and ran straight into Steve and said a few things Steve couldn’t really understand through the slurring.  Steve caught him and attempted to right him but Tony overcorrected and began to fall again So Steve just held him against his chest.
Steve lowered his lips to a point just above the collar of Tony’s shirt and placed his lips there.  He hesitated for a moment before opening his lips and sucking.  Tony moaned into Steve’s hair.  He was going to have one hell of a mark tomorrow.
Steve’s arm felt as though it had burst into flames but he had to grunt through and keep fighting, Tony would get through,  Then maybe they would have a chance of winning. That was the best he could do for himself, for the world.  The portal closed, and all the soldiers collapsed. But the pain on his arm did not stop.
“No thanks, Cap, but if you have some coffee I’ll take it.” Tony walked further into the kitchen and leaned up against the counter. Steve grabbed a pot and poured a cup tony took it gratefully and rooted around the cabinets until he found sugar, he scooped three spoonful’s into the cup and stirred before happily drinking.
He hadn’t shown this much restraint in a relationship since middle school, and only had then because his barely pubescent self-had been unsure how to proceed.  Now Tony knew exactly how he wished to proceed but he had promised he would let Steve set the pace. Tony laid back against the arm of the couch and Steve slipped by his side and laid his head against Tony’s chest.  They listened to each other’s breathing slow back down to normal.
The sound of rushing water increased in volume.  Steve could see it coming up through the grate in the floor.  He pulled himself slowly up the slanted floor toward the front of the plane.  Each motion sent a burning pain through his leg and up his spine. He didn’t start screaming until the water hit him. Everything it touched felt raw.  He could feel his bones freezing in his body.  The water made it up to his waist before the cockpit gave a final groan and sunk beneath the dark choppy waves.  Even above the water the temperature was dropping fast.  Steve could no longer feel his fingers where they clung to the dashboard.  The water stopped rising and the room got darker and darker as the ship sunk leaving Steve half submersed in a pitch black air pocket every nerve in his body shrieking.
“Why do I have to do this anyway I have a suit.” Tony whined.  He was still lying on the mat watching the fight.
His had been there since he was five, from when he finished building his first car engine from scratch.  He was too young to know he should care about it. But he ran to show his dad the car engine, sleeves rolled up and arms covered in grease. His father froze when he saw his arm and looked like he would be ill. Tony later decided his father was simply jealous, though he couldn’t fathom why, knowing he had a soulmate, that he wouldn’t meet till he was almost forty was incredibly stressful. His never changed until he woke up in the cave he noticed it had shifted earlier by a few weeks. He almost laughed at how little of an effect it had
Steve looked up.  A woman who he had never seen before was standing in the door way.  The shirt he had seen Tony wearing last night hung too big off her shoulders providing modesty to a dress that was otherwise without.  A pair of heels hung from her hands. She was classically beautiful although in the morning light she looked over blushed.
He had just finished a match when Natasha sat down next to him.  She was out of uniform but even in sweatpants and a T-shirt every eye in the room seemed to be on her.
The war began, and friends went off to fight, and that was when Steve learned the bad side of the soul mark arrangement.   Just because you had a date didn’t mean you were guaranteed to meet your soul make.  Men went to war and soul marks disappeared from the arms of people they hadn’t even met yet. People posted ads in the paper wanting to know who they had lost.  Hoping the family member would recognize the description of the matching mark and reach out.  Sometimes the ads ran in the paper before the letters made it home to the families.  Every day he checked his holding his breath hoping it hadn’t vanished overnight.
The man lets out a laugh. "I think Pepper would kill me if I got cupcakes. She's already a bit of a bridezilla, so the cake is the only thing I'm allowed to be in charge of, even though I'm paying for the whole ordeal." Even though Steve just got hit by a truck, the easygoing smile on the strangers face is almost enough to make Steve feel better.
But Sam doesn't respond before Tony pulls into a parking spot, turning the car off. "Come on," he says, opening his door.
Tony smiled and moved closer to Steve. He put his arm around him and began pointing at different icons on the screen and explaining what they do.
“This is what it looks like when you come out as a famous person, or in my case rather are outed,” He said.  “I wasn’t ready.  It was really rough.” Tony swiped again, the next cover was a photo of an older him. A skinny to the point of starvation woman on his arm and
At first Tony wanted to scream but then It occurred to him: if Steve knew what Natasha and Clint like maybe they would know what he liked.
Tony was reading the tabloid headline A Stark Contrast: Aliens Cause Heroes to Find Religion when Jarvis spoke up despite having been put on mute for the night.
Happy dropped them off at the church and it was everything the pictures online had promised; towering stone walls, massive stained glass, and people who seemed to be happy minding their own business and saying a quiet prayer before the service started.  They slid in to a pew half way back.  As soon as they sat Steve bowed his head and clasped his hands together.  His eyes were lightly shut and his thumb rubbed back and forth on his palms.  Occasionally he would pinch the skin on the back of his hand for a moment.
“Best idea I’ve heard all week.” Tony said.  He leaned in slowly giving Steve every opportunity to pull away. When Steve didn’t Tony brought their lips together with a feather-light touch.  He ran a finger down Steve’s cheekbone and kissed the corner of Steve’s mouth.
The whole essence of missing things is that they are gone… Steve thought but he smiled and nodded anyway.
“Jarvis, put all the numbers and shit back up.” Tony said.  Many years of experience had taught him that the only bad time for showmanship was funerals, the best time being first, or in this case second impressions.  Steve walked in with his hands tucked in his high waisted pants, or trousers rather, Tony thought. Any pants that looked like that had to be given their own distinguishment that made clear the lack of modernism they possessed.
At night he would sit in the ten by ten bedroom he had been given and their words would spin around his head and echo off the walls while he tried to not fall asleep.  When he eventually did he would wake up sure he was falling through the air, sweating and uncontrollably shivering at the same time.  Sometimes he woke up screaming, but no one ever came to see if he was alright.
“Hmmm.” Tony said not concerned.  After the events in New York meetings with Fury had become common place.
“Shit, Cap, it’s not like you didn’t already do enough,” Tony said. He started another pot of coffee, the bags under steves eyes seemed to be growing by the second, o
“I am certain Sir.  He appears to be having a night terror and he is not waking up.” Jarvis said.  Tony had never programmed the A.I. to convey tone but it managed to anyway.  Tony was already in the elevator by the time Jarvis had finished speaking.
“Send him up Jarvis.” Tony said.  He sprung off the couch and then changed his mind and sat back down.  He eyed the elevator as the door panel counted up the floors.  Captain America had been his childhood hero, and he would have been lying if he said the man’s words on the helicarrier had stopped stinging every time he thought of them.  He was a petty person there was no sense in denying it. He planned on being a jerk even though he knew Pepper would slap him in to next week if she knew anything of it.
Happy was waiting for them when the service let out.  Tony could see a few smart phones emerging to document their presence.  Steve must have noticed as well because he moved quickly to the car without question.
“How is he?” Her voice sounded worn.  Steve could see the red marks left from her scrubbing running eye makeup out from under her eyes.
Steve frowned.  It was a stern frown; the kind disappointed fathers gave their genius sons when they brought home a B in chemistry because they couldn’t be bothered to the homework.
Every few days a postcard would arrive, sometimes prompting Tony into some form of self-care, sometimes asking how he and the rest of the team was.  Always signed Best, Steve.
The suit tony gave him seemed a little too tight everywhere.  The vest seemed to cling to his torso and the ankles of the pants were so small he had to wiggle his feet to get into them but Tony assured him it fit perfectly.  The two of them walked through the living room and Clint looked at them confused.
Steve knew it must be something serious when Nick fury came to personally invite him on a mission.  Steve grabbed his things and boarded the transport provided for him. In the back of his mind, a little voice nagged that today was his soul day, but he shut it down.  Duty came first he told himself.  He read the mission file an watched the security video, he felt more confident, this was more familiar, this was something he could do, this was something he felt comfortable in unlike so much of the future.
“It’s true.  Just ask Steve. He’s the one who beat me.”  She set down her empty tea cup and picked up her bottle.  Steve was trying to hold back a smile.  Clint looked from Steve and back to Natasha.
He was about to start explaining but Tony cut him off by beginning to work kisses down his jawline.  He tugged gently on Steve’s shirt until they were facing each other. Steve tensed a little bit.
“That’s me.” He said.  He finished off his coffee and stood to pour himself another.  “Would you like some coffee” He asked.  About three seconds later it occurred to him that offering you housemate’s one night stand coffee was not what the social script demanded. Fortunately he was able to find a disposable cup to put it in so she wasn’t obligated to stay around to drink it.
“Technology is great and all I guess.” Steve swirled his fry in his ketchup. “and modern medicine is incredible.”
Steve wasn’t surprised by the reaction.  The gay rights movement had been the first and only thing anyone bothered to explain to him.  The first time he had been slightly surprised; by the third he had been more annoyed than anything else.
“Here” Steve said. “It didn’t look like your, um, friend made enough this morning.”  Tony took the coffee cup and sighed.
“Because he doesn’t know anyone there Tony.  He has nothing to do but beat punching bags to a pulp all day.”
“No.” She said simply. “I have some papers I need you to sign before you ‘forget’ about the board meeting this afternoon.” She grabbed his hand and held it up between them.  He tried to hold it still but his fingers gave involuntary squirms and twitches. “You can’t sign things if your hand has shaken off you wrist.”
“We aren’t sure we are ready for that to be public knowledge yet Thor.” Tony reached for Steve’s hand that hung at his side and gave it a light squeeze.
“What’s there to talk about?” Steve put his book down.  He knew he wasn’t likely to get out of it that’s easily but he had to try.
“Just override it bud.  I don’t give a fuck about what I thought was a good Idea last week.”   Dummy had just begun to roll towards the coffee maker when tony heard footsteps from the stairwell.
“I have a question.”  Steve asked.  He looked up at Tony through his eyelashes.  His eyes were such a deep blue in the fluorescent light of the lab that if had he seem a picture of them he would have sworn they were photo-shopped.
“I thought he had clearance to fire at will?” Steve asked.  Natasha smirked and snorted a little bit.
Busted.  Tony just wiggled his eyebrows and took another sip of Scotch.  There was no sense saving face.  He had a lost this round.
“Yeah, well I'm not really good at small gestures,” Tony said, and then a little more quietly possibly because he sensed that Steve was more than a little overwhelmed, “I’ll Leave you to explore the rest, Yeah?” Steve nodded.
He had given his speech, and everyone had applauded politely. And now came the socializing, that part that really brought in the money, and that was truly the worst.  He had taken up a position by the bar because, well honestly wasn’t that what was expected of him anyway?
“Not even entirely sure I’m dealing with a frequency here Cap.  That’s my fundamental problem.” He said.  The graph went back to normal.  “What can I do ya for?”
“Hey, Cap.  How ya doing?” he asked standing up from the couch.  “Oh, and welcome to avengers tower and stuff.”
Steve began to calm down.  He separated himself from Tony and sat against the headboard of the bed arms wrapped around his knees head tipped back so that he was looking at the ceiling.
Steve read the paper every morning and every morning it horrified him in a new way.  The politicians didn’t respect the people who they represented and in turn the people didn’t respect their politicians.  That story was the same every day and after a week or so Steve had grown used to it.  Today’s unique horror was that police were allowed to carry and use assault rifles against citizens. His thoughts were interrupted when a woman, this one fully clothed, walked in to the room.
Steve sighed and walked back to the living room. Clint and Natasha were engaged in a conversation in rapid fire sign language.
It was raining the next morning, so Steve swam laps instead of running.  When he finished, he headed back up to his room for a shower and had to pop back into the living room to ask Jarvis how exactly the thing worked. After a mild struggle with the control panel, he managed to get just one of the three shower heads to turn on, no need to be wasteful after all.
“Better now that you aren’t trying to tell me how bad you are for me.“ Steve Wrapped an arm around Tony’s waist and pulled him closer. He kissed him deeper this time, gently ran his tongue over Tony’s lips.  And even though he had instigated it His heart raced, and he felt dizzy.  Tony Stepped back took Steve’s hand and led him to the couch.
“It’s all still there Steve.” Tony said. He didn’t move his face from Steve’s had but looked as far down as he could without doing so. “It’s not going away.”
After that night Tony disappeared into his lab for two days.  Steve saw him once raiding the fridge but he pretended not to notice him and let him skitter away.
He walked into the room just in time to see Clint take a swing, and Natasha break several laws of physics while taking him to the ground.  Natasha had her hair up in a sloppy ponytail and was barefoot,  Her arms were bare and Tony couldn’t help but glance at her wrists, an ingrained habit. Where her soul mark should have been a dark rectangle was instead. He looked away quickly but he suspected she noticed.
“It’s a photo sharing app. Come, look.” Clint sat back down on the couch and gestured for Steve and Thor to come over. “You take a picture.” Clint pointed the camera at Tony.
“A good prank should bring the team closer together, not keep them split.” Steve then told him about the time he and Bucky has spent the entire night swapping the entire company’s boots around so everyone woke up with either two right or two left shoes.  “We didn’t want it to be obvious right away so we spent the whole night matching shoe sizes.” He struggled to finish the story for laughing so much. “They never did figure out that it was us.”
Steve gave up on attempting to deflect his way out of the conversation. “I think I messed up…” He whispered.  There was no one else in the room but he felt that if he talked too loud everyone would know. He told Natasha what had happened last night and Quickly repeated Tony’s offer from earlier so quickly it might not have counted as English as much as a shriek with slight inflection.“What do I do?” he asked miserably.
“Just the basics” Steve reassured him. “But you need to be able to defend yourself without having an incident.”
The elevator opened. Steve shuffled his feet as he got out.  He was unsure of what he was supposed to do at this point in the evening.
“I don’t know.” Uncertainty plagued Steve’s face again. Tony realized Steve likely did know what he wanted but didn’t know if he could ask for it.  Tony didn’t exactly have a reputation for fidelity.
Steve backed away. “I… I…” He face was flushed.  He took another step backwards and then turned and fled.
“The city at night with all of the headlights, especially from up in the tower.  It is kinda amazing the scale of it all.”
“Food first,” Steve said, and Tony sighed.  He knew when he was being conspired against. He put a fork full in his mouth, and it was good, excellent, in fact.  …
Sooner than he thought possible Steve was due back to the tower within the week, and Tony sent a request for his things to be sent over from Shield. A single filing box came by courier the next day and at first Tony thought there must have been a mistake. After being assured that that was all he took it the elevator up to Steve’s floor which now seemed ridiculously large. He set the box on the coffee table and opened it gently. Inside there was a copy of the Bible, a photograph of the howling commandos and a pair of dog tags worn almost bare.
It was a poorly planned questionably executed affair of a kiss.  Their noses bumped and their teeth clattered until Tony processed the fact that it was Steve’s hand barely touching his cheek and Steve’s lips pressed firmly against his. He pulled back to just hovering over Steve’s lips.  The elevator dinged.  They both opened their eyes.
Tony turned.  He looked put together but his eyes were blood shot. “Hey, Cap.  Don’t mind me. Just going out for a bit.” He said with a well practice toothy grin. He pushed the elevator call button and the doors slid open.  Steve put a hand on Tony’s arm to stop him from walking in to the elevator.
Worse than the changing though was that there was no way of knowing who his soul mate was except to ask every single person he met on his soul day if it was theirs as well.  And if he didn’t realize when he met them there was little to do about it.
“Penny for your thoughts?” Tony pushed the elevator button and it slid open.  They stepped inside and the elevator began to rise.
Tony huffed out a breath. “That’s always going to be a tall order Cap. Most would say you’ve done more than your fair share of time.”
“Where is Bruce? He must join us.” Thor gathered everyone on a single couch. “Jarvis.  Summon Dr. Banner from his lab.”
The elevator dinged, and the doors slid open.   He took a deep breath and stepped into the lab.  Rock and roll music blared one of those really loud bands that hurt his ears, but Tony really seemed to like.  He waited until he was just a few feet from Tony before he waved his hand in the air in the hopes that Jarvis would turn the music off.  Somewhat to his surprise, the AI seemed to understand.
“Firstly, there is no way you aren’t hungry. I’m starving and you got three times the workout I did with three times the metabolism. Secondly, we don’t need a repeat of last week.” Tony tapped the back of Steve’s hand One of the knuckled was still sporting a light pink scar.  “Let’s go get burgers.  I know this great place, lots of grease, huge milkshakes, the works.”
“I thought we talked about how you weren't to implement changes I made while drunk until you confirmed with me while I was sober first.” He complained without bothering to lift his head from the desk.   He swore he could hear Jarvis roll his eyes before he answered.
“Jarvis, I’m going to have to be the mature one in this situation aren’t I?”  Tony asked.  The alcohol sang to him from across the room.
“I did he said he didn’t want anything.” Tony said, “I don’t think he understands how much money I have and how not a big deal it is.”
Soldiers rushed in and Steve only hoped that they would make it to his soul mate in time, He would check the hospitals later he told himself, and then If he had to, the morgues. He looked up at where the portal had closed and saw Tony Stark falling from the sky.  He clutched his burning arm to his chest and ran to where he fell.  The burning stopped but he didn’t look to see if his mark was still there or not. He ran to Tony, and Tony jolted awake.
“Master Stark left the charity gala four hours ago, at which time he had his driver drive him to five separate pizza placed because the first four did not possess his desired cheese to sauce ratio. As you might be able to infer he was drinking all the while.”
Steve and Thor traded blows for a minute but it was clear Thor’s strength was wearing on Steve. Every one of the blows he blocked sent him staggering back.  Only his agility kept him from being defeated.  Thor seemed to realize it and began to strategically back Steve in to a corner.  Steve tried to skirt around Thor but he was anticipating it.  His arm shot out at lightning speed and clothes lined Steve flipping him on to the mat.
“I’m kind of um… new to this part of town.” Steve said with a wince and a Brooklyn accent that was on the tolerable side of noticeable.
“That hardly looks like a breakthrough Tony.” She said. “More like a plate of spaghetti.”  Tony threw up his hands in exasperation.  Pepper was right of course.  He was at least several weeks away from isolating the Chitauri control frequency… mostly because it didn’t conform to the human definition of frequency… as in waves. Yeah, it might take him more than several weeks. At this point however he was perfectly happy to be overly optimistic about his prospects if it got him more coffee.
“What I’m trying to get at is would it be presumptuous of me to ask you on a date?”  It was a corny thing to say.  So corny in fact that he would have Jarvis alter the security recording later so that there was never any proof such hideously sappy words ever left his mouth.
“Captain Rodgers is requesting entry, Sir.” Tony swiped away the design and pulled down the sleeves of his shirt which had been rolled up to his elbows so they covered the cuff around his wrist.
They walked out of the restaurant in to the mid-afternoon sun.  Steve’s hair glistened in the light that reflected off the buildings.  It was mildly ridiculous, offensive even.  They wandered their way toward a nearby park.  Tony’s phone gave a buzz in his pocket.  He flipped it open.
“He lost money on me in a fight.” Natasha smiled mischievously at Steve. “A lot of money apparently.” She took a sip of her tea unperturbed.
“Thanks for the other night Cap.”  Tony pulled out of his grip and stepped in o the elevator.  The doors gave a ping and slid shut.
The more Tony thought about what had happened in the elevator the more it made sense.  He and Steve had really hit it off in recent weeks in their own weird way.  If they were any two other people they would have gotten together by now; but Steve was from the forties and Tony was an emotionally constipated wreck who had failed to commit to a relationship, or anything really, till the age of thirty eight.  Tony wanted a drink but he knew that with the way the sensations of the too short kiss were burning his lips he would go do something stupid and well and truly fuck something up.
Natasha had returned from wherever she had been, she wouldn’t say, with a black eye and a split lip, two duffel bags in tow.  She had plopped down unceremoniously on the couch and mumbled something about hot tea and then a beer. To Steve’s surprise Clint, despite not having heard the comment, emerged from the kitchen a minute later with a mug in one hand and three beer bottles balanced in the other.
That gave him pause.  He was just beginning to adjust to the way things were in the future… no, the present… maybe he wasn’t ready to take something this big on.  He had never enjoyed the spotlight.  Maybe Tony was right, but he knew Bruce was right too, and he knew what he had to do.
As time went on there were some days he almost forgot about it, and when he realized he was happier not thinking about it. He began to wear a thick bracelet right over it, so he couldn’t see the letters that looked as if they were from a typewriter, “May 3
“Natasha, take Bruce through the basics. Clint, try not to kill Stark.”  Steve stretched and twisted from side to side.  Tony spent a moment contemplating the impossibility of Steve’s waste line.
He let he thoughts tumble around and resolved that he would face his problems in the morning.   He suddenly felt very alone and out of place in the world again.
“And by the looks of it your ego could probably use it.” Natasha said.  “Banner and I are finished.  Let’s go bird boy.”
“The Captain is in his room but has requested to be left alone.”  Jarvis said. Tony thunked his head against a work bench. This was going to have to wait till morning.
“Thanks.”  Steve said.  The smile was back and Tony remembered reading somewhere that even if you new someone was conditioning you with positive reinforcement you couldn’t stop it from working.  “See you in the morning Tony.”
“Ask away.”  Tony pressed a kiss into Steve’s temple.  It was all he knew he had permission to do.  Tony had never experienced this in a relationship before, even with Pepper.  He felt like he and Steve were still holding on to platonic’s cliff edge by a single hand.
“I have come up with a five-step plan.” Tony grabbed his phone out of his pocket. “First we must make social media accounts and build a decent following. I had Jarvis make you an Instagram and Twitter. Barton and Thor have agreed to tag us in welcome posts on both platforms.” “Jarvis, log Steve in on his phone, will you?”
“Right, Church, God, weekly worship.” Tony said. Then his alcohol fuelled agreeability found himself continuing to talk before he could stop himself. “Sure thing Cap.  Any particular place in mind?”  Steve smiled a lopsided smile that could only be described as American good ol’ boy.  Tony’s brain completely skipped the exit where he regretted what he had said, and got thoroughly lost in an intersection of nostalgia for worshiping the high school quarterback and trying not to smile himself.
Tony seemed to hesitate for a moment but then pushed his chair back and gave Bruce his coffee cup back.
Tony could feel Steve’s pulse racing underneath his skin. “Think about it for a week or so before you make a decision. That’s all I ask”
“Steve you’re shaking” Tony pulled away.  Lines of concern creased his brow.  His hand slid down Steve’s neck to rest on his shoulder. “Is this okay?”
The meal seemed to end entirely too soon and the lights all magically turned green on the car ride home.   Steve was surprised to find that he actually thought of Avengers tower as home now.  For a moment he wondered if it was just the luxury getting to him, it was easier to long for a warm bed and a hot shower than a lumpy cot or an unheated room and a thin blanket. Tony drummed on the steering wheel along to the music.  They pulled in to the underground garage.  It wasn’t those things Steve though, but It was pretty much everything else that made it feel like home.
Tony thought he heard Clint mumble”fucking casual” under his breath. He then dropped to a crouch swept Tony’s legs out from under him with his foot.  “The problem with boxing as that there are rules.” He popped back up to stand over Tony on the mat.   “It leaves you with an inflated sense of power and no preparation.”
Steve hangs up the phone, putting it back in his pocket. "I'm really sorry about this, but I kinda need a ride."
"The world needs protection, and I'm not saying it has to be you, but you know it needs to be done. Whatever you choose, I'm sure it will be right."
"Yes," Steve practically moans, knotting his red white and blue tie over his eyes, letting his hands settle on the backs of Tony's calves, which Tony knew had absolutely nothing to do with Steve being unsure where he was. He had phenomenal spatial awareness without his eyesight, due to his heightened hearing and other senses. It was more comforting than anything else.
Wanda laughs. "You didn't know? Allow me to be the first then," she gesture to where Tony is taking a mic from the table. "That's Tony Stark, sole heir to the largest tech company ever, built by Howard Stark. The Manhattan Project? Stark Tower? Ark Reactor technology? The whole family is full of geniuses."
"That's my line." Steve says solemnly, getting into the car with a sad look on his face. He was wearing Tony's clothes, if only because nobody else's would fit him now. At least, not that's in the compound. Steve drives away, the engine on the sports car revving of its own accord.
"Steve," Tony whispers, looking up at Strange pleadingly. Apparently he gets it because a portal opens, Steve Rogers in a set of Tony's clothes—even those were too big for him now—on the other side, stepping out, with his eyes wide. "Steve."
"My bad." Tony winks at him, then goes back to what he was doing. Of course, this could be done digitally, but he found that most people preferred tangible measurement as opposed to trusting computers. Whatever. Tony was flexible. "You're really lucky, in the grand scheme of things," Tony says, switching to the holographic model, looking at Bucky's nervous system now.
"Yes. That is a great idea. See you guys later." He also looks like he wants to praise god right now as he darts past Steve and out the door.
Tony follows after him through the door, flipping his keys into his hand. "So real talk. Wanda. She's a good kid?" He looks up at Steve, walking towards the elevator.
Steve only went to the ER in that town once, but the woman had made an impression to say the least. She was beautiful, but far too interested in getting Steve's number for his taste. Besides, she wasn't really his type. He had had a really bad allergic reaction to some poison ivy in the woods near the campus, so he hadn't exactly been in the mood to flirt at the time either when his legs were covered up and down with blisters.
"Boss," Nat says, bumping his hip with hers and looking up at him through her lashes. She's holding a tray of chocolate peanut butter fudge destined for the display case, but she apparently felt the need to interrupt Steve's pining with a teasing smirk. "I think you might need to remember to blink," she teases, continuing on her trip to the display case.
"Yes, the program is very much real. I'll allow you to clean up now." Adam walks away swiftly, not waiting for a response. He still made Steve's skin crawl, but not as much as his boss, who was apparently manipulating the strings of an entire underground organization from a prison cell. Daniel Whitehall scared the shit out of Steve.
"I love you too Tony." He holds Tony's arm, then pulls it back to kiss his hand. "Can you... um." He gestures down, and Tony snaps his fingers.
"You're not dead." Tony says with aN award winning wink, "How did none of you see the press conference?"
"So um, feel free to touch anything that doesn't look super expensive or dangerous," Tony starts out as soon as the doors open, walking through. Bucky's light footsteps follow after him. "Most of that stuff is upstairs though, so there's not that much to concern yourself with. So, today, we're going to be doing preliminary scanning and some rudimentary design. By the next time you come, I should have a functioning prototype, and we can run from there."
Tony slips down to kneel in front of Steve, his pants tented obscenely with a dark wet spot sticking out. He pushes the blindfold away from Steve's eyes, both of which were closed as he sat, still quite stiffly against the wall. "You okay?" Tony asks as he tucks the tie into his pocket.
They arrive to the venue, three layer cake in tow, almost an hour later due to the carefulness required to move a wedding cake. Though, with Tony and Peter helping, it was easier than the last time he made a wedding cake. Tony hangs off his arm as they enter, an indescribable look on his face as he gazed around at the hall. It was the same room in which the reception would be an hour later, with a massive window taking up the back wall. The sun shone through the window, filtering through masses of lavender and white balloons, placed specifically to cast the colors around the hall. Steve knew that because he had helped set it up only yesterday, along with Nat, Clint, Wanda, and Pietro. "I personally think it's quite unfair that you have to leave me now," Tony whines, batting his lashes up at Steve.
"Sounds perfect." Steve can imagine the dazzling smile on the other side of the phone. "I'll see you then."
"Your brother was the first option, but well.." Gideon blinks once, his grip tightening on the glass in his hand. "Anyway, if you're really unwilling, I'm sure we can find someone else, I just figured it wouldn't hurt to ask."
Steve looks down at his spaghetti, feeling a blush creep up his cheeks. "Would you like to get dinner?"
Tony shrugs, a breeze blowing through his soft brown hair. "You don't have to decide now. It's just an offer. Even if you just want the current prosthetics."
"One of my close friends outed me to my dad when I was 14. That's why I came back so fast." Tony takes another casual bite of his spaghetti. "You don't need to look at me like that. I'm over it."
"Don't. I'm alright." Steve tries to muster a smile, but he suspects his efforts failed judging by the look persisting on Scott's face. "People die. Tony and I weren't close." He wasn't lying, he wasn't. Tony and he weren't friends anymore; Steve had burned that bridge long ago. He would fight Tony again in that bunker to save Bucky's life, but given the chance he wouldn't lie to him. Not again, not ever.
"Oh. Well, my name is Maria Stark. I'm an artist. I was born to wealthy Italian immigrants who fled Italy after Mussolini was kicked out. My mom taught me to cook. We haven't spoken since I started dating Howard; I think she wanted me to marry an Italian." She strokes Tony's cheek with a finger. "Keep the bloodline pure or whatever."
"Right." He closes the stones back into their case. "I'll show you up to the the guest rooms, I guess."
Tony turns to him, stopping at a mostly open space. "I think this is the most expensive room I've ever been in," Bucky says, looking around appreciatively.
He leans up, grabbing five more pancakes, and biting into the small stack. "I've gotta go, Scott. Bruce and Thor should both still be here."
Nat picks up the phone on the second try once Steve gets back to his apartment. "What do you want Steven," she snaps at him, clearly cross, despite it only being 3.
"And what a shame that is, but I can. Come on cap." She tugs on his arm as she walks past, heading presumably towards where the kitchen might be. He follows diligently, with only a slight exasperation in his step. He was so happy to have her back that he probably would let her lead him right into a burning forest. Liquor was probably a safer bet then that, so he'd take it.
Wanda huffs in disbelief. "I can't believe you hooked a billionaire in three fucking minutes." She slides her way into Victors arm, holding his hand tightly. "Took me months."
The kiss tastes like strawberries and vanilla, the dim lights shining down on them making Steve feel dizzy. Or maybe it was the man in front of him and the hand on his cheek that made him feel dizzy. Why had he ever tried to fight this? What had he thought to gain from denying himself perfection.
"Sure no problem," Tony says with a shrug. With Bucky leaning down, Steve has a clearer view of Tony's sparkling eyes and blowing hair. He's willing to bet that it would take to curls like nobodies business given the chance.
"Then we'll be ruined together," Steve says, still groggy from sleep. His eyes finally flutter open, revealing blissed out blue eyes. He looks unbearably comfortable in Tony's arms, but Tony certainty doesn't have the heart to ruin that. "Tony," he mutters, rubbing their noses together.
Her gaze redirects on him and she deflates with the realization that this was still her wedding and they still had an audience. "You—I—ok. Thank you. I like dark chocolate. Tony, I'm still going to beat your ass," Tony winces, "but I'm not going to kill you anymore, so take what you can get."
Peter squints at him. Damnit, that boy was too smart. "Don't lie to me Tony," he grumbles, pulling down a box of pop tarts. He offers one to Tony with a raised eyebrow.
The loud sounds of the popcorn machine follow shortly and Tony finally looks up at Peter, who politely ignores the glistening in Tony's eyes. "Thanks kiddo."
"Can't stop thinking about her, can you," Tony taunts, bracing his arm over Steve's chest and baring his teeth angrily. "I'm gonna make you forget everything but
Tony nods, his eyes large. "Deal. We'll see you in a few hours." Peter makes an affirmative noise and the line goes dead, Tony immediately slumping back into his arms.
"Same old same old. Where's Tony? Aren't you two supposed to me making out in a corner or something by now." Victor teases, grinning at him.
"Well that can't be true," Steve says, pouring out some strawberry syrup into the almost finished frosting. His fiancée had to like him at least a little. Tony doesn't answer that, and Steve can't decide if he thinks that's a good thing or not. Steve finishes up the small batch of frosting with a faint pink tint and brings it over to Tony, who was still leaning over the counter. "Here you go," Steve says gently. He looked vulnerable in a way that Steve hadn't exactly been expecting.
"Did you know that we have a security system that alerts us when someone enters our private property. You visited at least once a month for five years. But oddly enough, you never came up. Not once." Steve's cheeks flush, and he opens his mouth to offer a half assed explanation. "I know you were in love with my husband. I don't care. You never came up until it was with the idea of the time heist. Point is, for five years, you've lived with a nagging hope that you could get Tony to forgive you. He did. The first time you came up, he told me to tell you to piss off and he went down to his lab. Eventually, he would watch you pace in the middle of the road. Sometimes he would say he wanted to go out there and invite you in. Bit by bit, he forgave you. You can let go now Steve, you have to let him go. There are no more what ifs. So you just have to move on like the rest of us."
"Please," Tony says, peeking up at the mention of Peter. It was good to know he was ok, and apparently hitting it off with Princess Shuri. He would have to remember to tease Peter about that later. She walks away, leaving Tony alone with his thoughts for only a few minutes before Steve bursts back in, also missing an arm. Tony blinks, before he feels an arm squeezing tightly around his neck and the weight of heavy breath against his neck. "Steve."
The TV kicks back to life and Steve finds himself staring up at the video he had just recorded, near the end. "Spread love, not hate." He says, then he salutes and relaxes, a large smile blooming across his face. He knows he's looking at Tony, and if he didn't know any better he would say he had little hearts in his eyes. Great. He looked like a sappy dork on national television.
"Steve, thank god. I need your help, like right now," Bucky says, sounding absolutely panicked out of his mind.
Nat nods, smiling down at Tony who had crawled over to her and was leaning against the side of the couch, offering her one of the circuit pieces. "Thank you, dear."
"Shut up Rogers. I'm just glad you're alive." Tony breathes in his scent for a moment, thankful for everything. Whatever it takes had—for once—not meant everything they had. "For the record, I love you too. And hey, we got the stone," he holds it up between his fingers.
Steve fixes his brunet curls with a look that he knows Tony can sense. "Then why would you mention it?"
After a full night of avoidance, Peter was.. well, not really cornered. He was next to the elevator, but at least he didn't look like he was going to bolt. "What, dad?"
The hammer in his hand seems to crackle with energy as he grows nearer to the peak, the feeling of heavy electrified metal grounding him to reality. Since the moment he lifted it, he had doubted his worthiness. He had almost killed the man he loved. He was a liar, a killer, a traitor. He had led his friends to treason punishable by underwater super max prison, and they had followed because they thought he was a good man. He had no regard for his personal safety, would always throw himself on the blade of the knife, with no regard to what it did to those around him. He had tried to kill himself after loosing Bucky, but instead he found himself lost from his life seventy years later. For whatever reason though, the hammer decided he was worthy. Maybe he was.
But that was all gone now. He was alone—save for Bucky and Sam, but they were strangers now. She was his everything, his closest friend, his sole confident. Sure, he had held group sessions for people to talk about their losses, but he never once mentioned Bucky, Sam, and Wanda. They were too fresh in his mind, an open wound even now. He still missed Peggy, but she had lived a life. That had been easier to talk about. He lost so much, but he always had Nat right by his side. He wished they could've traded places. He would give anything for her to be okay. He loved Tony, but he loved Nat too. The ever looming cloud of swirling purple glares down at him as the rocky terrain grows more solid. His boots don't crunch anymore, and his hair blows in the ever present wind.
Peter looks at him and waves, but doesn't stop singing or dancing, which is pretty on par for who he is as a person. "Hi Victor. How are you two.. um.. doing?"
Tony doesn't look at him, instead tossing the tablet onto his own bed, turning around and shaking his hand. "Fuck. Fuck! Steve, he killed my mom."
"Rude! I would think I'd get a special discount for being pretty, right?" Tony protests, gently smoothing Steve's jacket with his hand. The simple action is almost enough to make Steve's knees go weak. He got what he wanted, and never thought he could have. What's better then that?
"I'll be ready." Steve's answer is easy, but his mind is racing before he can even get the words out. That's how he could leave. He could go somewhere his mistakes could never catch up with him. Better yet—he could fix his mistakes. Bucky—Peggy—Tony—he could even say goodbye to Nat.
"That you loved him?" He nods, to shaken to form a response. "You looked at him the same way I did at our wedding." She shrugs. "Besides, why would you chicken out of seeing him so many times otherwise."
Steve hears the sound of racing engines nearing the tower, similar and comfortable in a way that almost surprised him. He looks out the window, unsurprised to see Tony's armor disassembling around him. "Cap!" Tony says, a funny look on his face.
The gentle music ended and at the front of the room a beautiful brunette stands, clearing her throat. "Thank you all for taking the time to serve the  national wildlife conservation organization. Dinner will be served shortly, so please begin making your way to your seats." She steps down and the music starts back up.
"And he can't touch your butt!" Tony protests, prodding a finger into Steve's side. "A promise is a promise."
When Tony wakes up, it's thankfully not to the sound of the plane burning down, or the sound of Hydra coming to kill them, but his own name, gentle on Steve's lips. It was still dark out, and the fire was little more than embers, but Tony could feel blue eyes on him. "Cap?"
The only thing that could go wrong here would be the eventuality that Tony never became Ironman. That... well, Steve couldn't bear to think what that would do to this reality. It was risk that had to be taken though.
Tony shrugs. "You're friends with my favorite intern, and Peter is friends with Spider-Man, which is how Happy found you guys."
She snorts, looking up at the waitress who comes up to the table with two takeout cups of coffee. "My manager said you have to leave, I'm so so sorry, the coffees are on the house." She says, setting them down in front of the pair quickly as if she's afraid of retaliation.
"You're in a recovery room in New York," she fiddles with the leaf of the potted plant, feigning nervousness.
Except they were already going down. Or more accurately, he was going down, because Steve was gone. Fuck. Tony's fingers close around the USB, laser focused on the uploading bar, as if he could will Hydra tech into not sucking ass. He looks up at the tree line as the plane feels the first tops of the snow covered lines grazing its underbelly. Seconds later, the plane is ramming through trees at full force, and the only thing keeping Tony from falling out the gaping hole is the fact that his arm was twisted in the seatbelt. By a stroke of luck though, the upload does complete, and Tony is able to fumble the USB into the slot on his suit before the plane slams into the ground, and he knocks his head against the roof of the plane, finally loosing consciousness.
"Well given that we got his bff back from the dead, I'd say he's gonna be pretty chill with it." Slowly, they watch him begin to stir, blue eyes fluttering open. "I'll see you in a second dear." She opens the door as he looks around the room, going over to the stereo to turn it down. "Captain Rogers, it's nice to see you awake."
"We're not dating, but yeah." Steve helps him out of the cell smirking at the shocked look on his face.
Tony laughs. "I'm going, I'm going." His hand brushes Steve's butt as he walks away and Steve has to stop himself from smiling. Tony was a force to be reckoned with, but Steve didn't mind dancing with fire when the fire was funny and nice. Steve goes back to the cake, moving it into its cleared out spot in the fridge. By the time he shuts the door, Tony is back, leaning against the wall wearing one of Steve's shirts and a pair of grey sweatpants. "How's this?"
So sorry about the wait! In order to make up for it, I’ll be posting a couple of shorter fics that take place in the months between Stevetonys first date and Sambuckys wedding. They should be coming out pretty quickly, so stay tuned 💕💕💕
The kids file onto the jet, and Tony can feel the adrenaline wearing off of them. Yeah, they were going to crash hard and fast. "So everything's good boss?"
Now on the other hand, he kind of was expected to be somewhere important in an hour. Even if he didn't want to be there.
The first thing he does is hug her as tight as he could. She just pats him on the arm. "I know, Steve. Ok, if I can get this under control, we can just blast our way out of here, right? Maybe?"
Thor smiles up at him when he walks in, looking for all the world like a teddy bear instead of a god king. "Greetings, Steve. Are you feeling better?"
"Um..." Steve blinks. "We can just have leftovers. It is his day off." He didn't know what he had expected, but it wasn't this. He had suspected Tony to mop up the mess, then take off, back to wherever he had been before coming back to the tower.
That's all Steve needs to turn and jog up towards Bucky, who is clutching his phone with white knuckles. "Bucky," Steve announces, falling to his knees beside his friend. His nice pants soak through quickly, but he doesn't exactly care. "Hey pal, it's Steve. You called me, can you look up at me." Bucky shakes his head no, clearly too numb to really understand what Steve was saying. "Can I touch you," Steve says, holding his hands out in front of himself. Bucky nods, and Steve immediately pulls him close, Bucky's weight now resting fully in Steve's lap. He moves closer to Steve with a whimper. Steve looks up at Tony, who is standing by the fountain with his eyes fixed on Steve and Bucky with a concerned expression.
"But. So did I. I get it, but I need you to be strong. I need you to not gush to my five year old. I need you to move on. The world is sorely lacking with Tony and Nat gone, and you need to get it together so nobody can take advantage of us again. Whatever that means for you, it needs to happen." Her voice isn't pitiful, but it isn't mean either. She doesn't waver once, and Steve has half the mind to think that she would be the strongest of all of them if she took up heroism.
"That's right," Tony says with a cheeky smile, kicking off his shoes by the door before shutting it with an echoing click.
"You're invited to my wedding," Bucky says. "Pretty sure it's an empty gesture because Steve would bring you along anyway, but you're invited."
"Yeah yeah, hey pal. Like she said. Lots of catching up to do." Steve looks at Bucky, registering the hidden absolute delight in his words.
He walks back out towards the front and up onto the stage, much of the room falling immediately silent. He grabs the mic off its stand, holding it carefully. "Hi everyone," Steve says, receiving a chorus of hellos back. "For those of you who don't know me, I'm Steve Rogers, aka, the best man. I'm out here to let you all know that the wedding is going to start in twenty minutes, so it would be appreciated if you all could start to sit down." He puts the mic back down, walking back off the stage. As instructed, people begin sitting down, so they could start now. He definitely didn't blame Bucky for being nervous, Steve had the jitters and he wasn't even getting married.
"Do you want to try and do something about the red room, while we're here?" He drops his shirt, pulling on a loose cotton one, waiting for a response. She is silent for a long time—long enough for him to get rid of his pants and trade them for softer fleece ones and begin hanging the suit up.
Every Sunday for the past nine months, they had attended combat arena, where underlings volunteered to be sent in to fight to the death for a chance to come out victorious and move up in HYDRA ranks. It was vicious, brutal, bloody. Nothing Steve wanted to partake in, but something he knew he could excel at given the proper motivation. Nat could too, perhaps easier then him, but there was no need to reveal how deadly she was to these people. He scrawls his fake name on the sign up sheet in small print, sealing his fate.
"Peter isn't here Tony." Steve deadpans, adjusting the arm around Tony's shoulders to turn off Tony's  phone then go back to holding him. "What if I want to."
Clint was perhaps Steve's only friend who wasn't also his employee, because he had a job at the YMCA as an archery instructor. Even then, Clint hung out around the bakery a considerable amount, and sometimes he would pick up a shift that nobody else could. He wasn't allowed in the kitchen though, the one time Steve made that mistake he had gotten cookies about the constancy of a rock. Clint was deaf too, but he was the only one of Steve's friends who was married with a kid, so he had that going for him. Him and Nat had gone to high school together, which was how he joined the friend group. He helped out at the homeless shelter pretty often, because that's where he found his dog Lucky.
He also hopes that Pepper doesn't show up at the shop to try and kill him. That wasn't even something he had been worrying about, but now that he thought about it, it was a real possibility. He doesn't really know if he would even have the heart to try and stop her from breaking his face. He deserved it.
Tony's eyes slip closed and he takes a shaky breath. "I'm sorry I—crowds." His breath catches in a way that makes Steve's heart throb.
The restaurant was really nice too on the inside. It was covered in these string lights hanging from the ceiling that cast a warm even glow around. Tony looked angelic with his chocolate brown curls basked in gold and a smile crinkling the corners of his eyes. They talk and talk and talk for what feels like hours, trading easy laughs and stories and lives. It was almost easy, to get lost in the conversation. Tony just talked and talked when he really got going. He explained his most recent project in words Steve had no real hope of understanding, but the way he lit up talking about it, Steve didn't really feel the need to understand. Steve shares things he hasn't spoken aloud in years. His friends were right, he was usually a pretty secretive person, but sitting here, he couldn't help but talk and talk and talk. The conversation was so easy it was almost scary. Steve was trying desperately to not over share too much, but Tony was oversharing too and it was okay. It was all okay.
