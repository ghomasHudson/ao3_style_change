Wandering down the corridor, Dean cracked his knuckles, and let his eyes roam across the crowd dancing in the foyer— grinding their bodies, humping, laughing, some even passed out on the floor. But he wasn't interested in them. His eyes scanned for one, only one person who he was sure would stand out in the crowd with his height and build. Sure, Alastair was not quite as tall as Dean, and talking about body? He was average, punier than Dean. Dean was over a hundred and fifty pounds of muscle, thanks to his work as a mechanic.
Absently, he reached a hand out, and slid it into Meg's to give her a light squeeze. She seemed to jerk out of her thoughts, and turned to face Castiel, wiping away a stray tear on the back of her palm.
"I'm sorry, but some of the most capable men in this company have constructed these papers, and they have put an immense amount of effort into—"
An unlikely tremble had made its way to Bobby's lips as he shook his head, and let out a deep sigh. He pulled away from the table, only to rub his hands over his face, as he tried to control his breath.
The kiss wasn't urgent or rushed in any way— but heated, simmering and threatening to teeter on the edge of something new, something the two of them had never done before, and yet, Castiel was ready, he had never been more ready before. He wanted it as it came, he didn't want to think, he didn't want to consider the consequences and he didn't want to wallow in doubt— he knew Dean would make him feel good, and that was all he needed.
"I'm sorry, I didn't see you come in," Dean whispered, and tightened his hand around Castiel's wrist.
It was Anna. Her eyes looked to Dean first, before glancing at the others. She sent them a smile, and they smiled back. Castiel pulled out a seat for her right next to him.
The question made Castiel falter, and he hummed for a moment, trying to think of how to respond, before finally— finally, he could think of what he wanted to be, not what he was supposed to be.
. His face was bright, brighter than the sun, and his grin was almost blinding. Dean had never felt as insignificant before as he felt in that one moment, gazing upon what he considered to be one of the most sublime things in existence. Something about Castiel was so utterly
"I'm sorry if I brought up an argument between the two of you. I swear, I'm not—" Anna started, but Castiel brushed her off with a smile.
"No, don't make me challenge a kid." Michael laughed, and Dean felt some of the tension seep out of his body.
In the evening, Castiel would walk by Dean's house, deposit the notebooks in his younger brother, Sam's hands, and be on his way. On the brighter side, at least Castiel was getting himself some revision, even though it may be under the obligation of writing the same answers twice.
"On Friday, I— it was the three of them, but, it was their fingers. And Alastair forced it into my mouth. There was this bottle of beer I had with me, and they emptied it, and shoved the thing inside me."
Pain because he would never, ever, ever in his whole, entire life, ever understand the fear, the helplessness, and the horror Castiel must have felt in those few moments.
"I love you," He whispered, and felt Dean falter. He went silent for a few seconds, before hugging Castiel back, pressing his lips to Castiel's forehead.
, and squeezed his thighs around Dean's face. Their breaths hung in the air, loud and expectant, until at last, Dean pulled his head out of Castiel's thighs. Castiel fluttered his eyes open, feeling his spent cock twitch at the sight of Dean, his hair a completely crazy mess, his eyes narrow with lust, and his lips slick with spit drooling down his chin. He sat back on his knees for a moment, and rubbed the back of his palm across his lips before sending Castiel a smirk and climbing off the bed.
"Look, Winchester, we're not good people, and you know that. And you're fucked-up, let's face it. You put on this mask where you're a suave, tough, fella' who gets chicks left, right and centre, but that's not what you are, is it? You hate that, I know it. But when you're with Novak, I see you smile. And not the smile you give all of us— the smile that comes from in here." Benny clapped a hand over Dean's chest, and Dean stood, mouth hung open and eyes glistening as he listened to Benny.
"Can't we stay like this forever?" Dean asked, his voice breathless as he pressed another trail of kisses slowly down Castiel's chest, rucking his t-shirt up, and holding him as delicately as a porcelain doll in his arms. Castiel whimpered, shoving a hand over his mouth to stifle his noises, when at once, Dean reached up to link his fingers through the hand on Castiel's lips and bring it down.
Dean's fingers brushed against the bruise, light as a feather as he snapped his eyes up to meet Castiel's. "Benny," He whispered, and fished the keys to the Impala out of his pocket, "-drive Castiel home."
the ones doing the torturing. If anything, he never treats me the way he treats everyone else. He calls me one of his boys, and he splurges on me."
"Do s-something," He urged Dean, who glanced up at him for a moment, as if having been pulled out of a trance.
"Hello to you too, Dean," Castiel deadpanned, before narrowing his eyes at Dean, who seemed to be fidgeting with something in his hand, "—why won't you leave me alone, for
Michael let out a groan and set his glass down on the table in front of them, before clapping his hands together and rubbing them with a grin.
"Oh?" Alastair cocked a brow, a challenge evident in his eyes, "-is he yours then? Are you a fag too, Winchester? God, have you been one this whole time?"
"Not the first time you've caught me when I was falling," Castiel grinned, and Dean trailed his eyes up to Castiel's big, round ones, somehow filled with adoration.
Castiel paused for a moment, simply staring at the ring Dean was holding out— thinking of everything it meant to Dean, and now, everything it would mean you Castiel. He swallowed thickly, still unable to digest how sure Dean was about something as grave as
Standing at the Novaks' door, Dean composed himself, trying his best to put on a smile but failing each time he was reminded of what Benny had said to him that morning. He rung the buzzer, and stepped back. The door opened a few seconds later, and who would greet him but Cas? And said Cas was clad in nothing but Dean's flannel t-shirt, which Dean remembered losing at Castiel's home on Saturday, and to match with the red shirt, a pair of short, black tights. And nothing else. He looked as tempting as he did adorable, and Dean burst into a smile on instinct.
"Try me," Castiel said after a while, and leaned back against the cushion of the seat they were at. A small laughter erupted from the table, only making Castiel frown harder. "I'm serious, I'm not a bore. You people just don't know me well enough."
Teary eyes met Dean's, and he hitched a breath. Castiel turned around to stare at him for a moment, silent, before his lips trembled, and Dean could tell he was trying
A choked cry drifted through the air and Dean squeezed his eyes shut, gritting his teeth together. A shudder wracked his body at the anticipation of what he'd see, what he'd find—
Sighing, he sunk back on his bed, and turned over to face the wall. His eyes roamed across the small scratch marks on the wall. He remembered leaving them the night before, when Benny had driven him home. It was one of the few moments Benny had left Castiel to himself, he'd gone down to fetch Castiel a bottle of water. Castiel had wanted to claw at something, to break, smash, rip something apart. He felt anger, more than anything, and he wanted to take it out on something. But then again, his room was nothing but a glorified white prison, with almost nothing that belonged to him. Scratching at the plaster, clawing at it until his fingers went sore— it was all Castiel had done to vent his anger. Observant as he may have been, Dean hadn't noticed the scratch marks, and Castiel was thankful for it.
"Yes, precisely." Castiel laughed, and turned around to face Dean. Still basking in the high of their orgasms, Castiel smiled, and pressed a kiss to Dean's nose before erupting into a chuckle.
"The suspension will naturally leave a stain on their record, y'know," Castiel added, before letting Meg finish.
Castiel's voice was cracked every semblance of sanity in Dean's mind, and all he could think of was how Castiel didn't deserve it. Not a single thing, not a single bruise, not a single scratch— no, he didn't deserve what happened to him. He was just a child, for God's sake, so naive, so pure, with such radiance in his soul. Even the brightest ray of sunshine wouldn't live up to the way Castiel illuminated Dean's life, how he made every day bearable; livable. How he made Dean felt safe, loved, cared for.
"Then," Benny grinned, "-you just gotta' put it out there to see what happens. Don't hold back. Tell him you like him, or
"So, Dean, tell us about your family." Naomi asked, as one of the manservant's in Castiel's house began to serve Dean food.
"Good." The conversation died down, and the air had turned sour. Castiel wished desperately to say something to break the silence, but he wasn't as skilled with conversations, and everything he could think of Dean already knew.
"So, lunch? Benny and Meg might be waiting for us. We've got to put down some plans for the website too." Castiel said, and tugged Dean along to the cafeteria.
Mr. Singer's eyes roamed their faces for a moment, before he smiled in the slightest, and nodded his head slowly. "That would be an apt statement, yes. So I do know everything that happened on Friday. And I'm sorry I couldn't bring it up in school. The conversation Dean and I had was strictly out of school hours, so neither him or me are liable to record those statements as valid during school time. But I just— no one should have to go through what you went through, son," Mr. Singer's eyes stared right into Castiel's, and for a moment, Castiel could feel this immense affection and wisdom coursing through him, coming from Mr. Singer, and he hung his head down.
"Father," He started, and settled down beside Dean on the seat, linking his hand absently through Dean's, "—Dean owns a 1967 Chevy Impala. She's gorgeous. He loves her more than anything. Oh, and classic cars— you can ask him anything about classic cars, and Dean will have the answer to it. He's basically an automotive god."
"Dean, please, just stop hanging out with Alistair and his gang of crooks. You're not a delinquent. Stop acting like one. You're better than this." Sam sighed, utter disgust on his face, and Dean watched as he dashed out the door.
A few moments must have passed, before Dean found a question he didn't understand, and he turned to Castiel. Castiel sighed for a moment, before hopping off the seat and onto the bed. He scooched his butt towards Dean, and sat with his back pressed against the wall, leaning into Dean's space, and although it didn't seem intentional, Dean could feel the warmth of his body radiating towards him, and he breathed in Castiel's gentle, minty scent, before letting his eyes wander down to the questionnaire.
Dean swallowed down the complaint on his tongue, and let himself drown in the scent of Cas's cologne and laundry detergent. It
Shame and hurt, and indescribable pain caused a strange nausea to bubble in the pits of Castiel's gut, and he stumbled backward, letting his feet carry him away as his vision blurred. The moment Castiel turned around the corner, he let out a broken sob into his palm, and let a fresh round of tears pour down his face.
Dejected, Castiel slouched down over his desk, and continued writing the equations, feeling Dean's eyes prick his skin with every passing second. For some reason, Castiel found himself liking the attention. Oh come on, who was he kidding? He thrived on attention. Especially Dean's, because he
Unbidden, tears rose to his eyes at the memory, and he tried to stable his breath. He couldn't say with certitude, what Gordon's purpose to have him alone, but at such a time, he was sure of one thing, and that was of the fact that he wasn't as weak as he had before. He was a changed person, in fact, he was changing everyday, growing stronger, more determined everyday, and whatever it was that Gordon had to say, be it a threat at that, Castiel wasn't going to back down before listening.
"Jesus, fuck, you're gonna' make me come before I even start—" Dean muttered, and with the thumb sucked inside Castiel's hole, started pulling around and opening him up, almost wondering how tight and pink and hot he'd be inside.
is on board, and we can get this started, what say?" She looked over at Castiel hopefully, and Castiel grinned.
Pink, lacy panties greeted Dean's eyes, perched on a round, peachy ass Dean would give anything to sink into. His teeth, his fingers, his tongue, his cock— Dean would ravage every inch of the boy's juicy ass if he could. Dean couldn't even tell if the boy really
"Mr. Singer, we had something to talk to you about. It's a somewhat long discussion, is now a good time?"
Both of them had gotten quite close the past few days. To the point where touching became almost casual, and the teasing was a regular part of their conversation. Castiel wouldn't admit it out loud, but Dean's cockiness was somehow attractive, and he'd some times find himself flustered at the things Dean would say.
Benny stared at Dean for a moment, before Dean realised what he'd said, "-I, I, I mean, not, erh— n—not adorable, but uhm."
Almost instantly, Castiel noticed, Sam was online again, and the ellipses on the screen began to bounce as he typed.
what Castiel had done had him shuddering, and he let out an incredulous gasp as he watched Dean hang his head down.
, but the words never came as he gaped at Castiel's face, the image of Cas riding a cock, even if it was fake, suddenly flashing everywhere in Dean's mind, and he felt his cock throb inside his trousers.
"You look gorgeous, Cas." Dean breathed out, Castiel fluttered his eyes up to stare at Dean, his breath held in his chest as he met Dean's eyes.
"Now you're ready." Dean whispered, before pulling his fingers away and unbuckling his jeans. Castiel propped himself up on his elbows and watched Dean. Dean never stripped save for his jeans and boxers pooling at his thigh, but Castiel craved to see him naked one day, in all his rugged, sweaty glory. From the touch of it, Castiel knew Dean had muscles, and
For the past seventeen years, not once had Castiel sat in his mother's lap and felt indescribable joy, or played with his father and enjoyed some normalcy. All he had was large, blank white bedrooms, since neither of his parents knew him well enough to get it customised to his tastes, and books. Once he'd found a way to distract himself from books, it was his OnlyPics account.
"Look Cas," Dean started, as he sat himself down next to Castiel with an equally full plate of pancakes, "—the things I did, I'm not proud of any of it, okay? If I could change my past, I really would, but I can't." A beat passed between them, "-I'm scared of not being able to belong, Cas. I need someone who accepts me. Before you, it was Alastair. At home, it's Sammy. And at school, I had to pretend to be someone I wasn't to be able to belong. I've told you already, I got in on a scholarship, I wasn't born into a rich family, neither are my parents hardcore corporate workers with a shit ton of money to spend on my schooling. But I wanted to do something worthwhile, you know? And I wanted to be relevant to the people around me."
Dean wanted to call out, to go after him, but a hand on his arm stopped him. He glanced up to find Michael shaking his head gently. Naomi seemed slightly ashamed, which surprised Dean, because honestly, who would've thought the bitch had feelings? But she buried her face in her palms, and Dean heard her let out a small sob. Michael made no move to console her, and Dean almost felt bad for her. Instead, he knew what he had to do.
The four of them, save for Castiel, broke into a murmur of agreement, and Castiel simply gaped at then, mouth hung open.
Dean, Lord bless him, spanked Castiel's ass before heading towards his bag, only adding to the disgust on Michael's face.
underestimating Dean, so he wouldn't have gone as far as leaving the party, which meant he was somewhere in the farmhouse with his two, loyal knuckleheads. If Dean was lucky, Alastair would be drunk enough to be caught off-guard, just the way Castiel was when Alastair found him. Oh, how Dean wished he was a crueler person so he could put Alastair through the same thing he put Cas through, but some semblance of righteousness still prevailed in Dean's mind, and he hoped a good, long thrashing would show Alastair his place.
Dean's hand covered his own, and he gripped both of their cocks together. The touch of their heated cocks sliding together had Castiel letting out a soft gasp. Dean thrust his cock against Castiel's, and Castiel almost felt his mind spin with how sensitive it was.
A rustling of fabric caught his ear, and he turned his head to the the side to watch a woman, their school-nurse, Alex, walked in through a door of curtains. She glanced up at Castiel, and sent him a warm smile.
"Suspension is too light, those sons of bitches should be in jail, but they won't. They're loaded, after all. Besides, we'd need evidence, a proper report case, enough support to the allegation— it's complicated."
The finger was dry, and yet, it teased Castiel's tiny pucker, rubbing the rim, poking inside, grazing with light touches, and prodding so obscenely that it almost had Castiel shaking in Dean's lap.
Castiel lay stunned for a moment, before going deep red in the face, as he turned his head to the side and reached up to hold onto the hem of the pillow. Dean pushed his legs apart, and at last, Castiel felt his tongue— hot, wet, sticky— lap at his hole, drinking Castiel in as if he were ambrosia.
Castiel snorted, and let himself be pulled into a hug as Dean wrapped his arms around his waist, and pressed a kiss to his neck. Castiel felt his skin dot with a shiver at the touch of Dean's warm, gentle lips, and it seemed like Dean knew just what he was doing as he pressed another trail of kisses down Castiel's neck and shoulders, down to his collarbone.
. For once, he realised, he felt what Dean was used to feeling— having no idea about what the other was thinking. Dean was sitting there, right next to him, so close to him, and but at the same time, Castiel had not a single clue as to what he may have been thinking about.
Castiel grit his teeth. Every ounce of regret inside him had now laced with anger— sheer rage, and he locked his jaw with a gulp. He realised, never before had he despised Dean as much as he did now. Class rivals or not, Dean had always been someone Castiel thought would stay away from him, but here he is, right between Castiel's thighs,
, and turned his eyes down to the picture again. If he was being honest, it wasn't that bad, and the fact that Dean had made it his lock screen
"Cas," Dean mumbled, and watched as Castiel looked up at him. Their faces were a mere inch away, and even closer, were Castiel's lips. Plump, soft, inviting.
"How you gon' prove it?" Ketch asked, obviously trying to rile Castiel up, and it seemed to be working, because the smaller man huffed, and bit down on his plump bottom lip in thought.
But Michael turned around and walked away. Not saying a single word. He seemed traumatised, to say the least.
"How about you take me in your car? Spread me open nice and wide like the good girl you want me to be, and just take me, yeah? Fuck me nice and rough till I'm sore and limp. I bet your cock's so wet for me, so hard for me, would you like it if I touched it?" Castiel grinned, knowing damn well the effect he was having on Dean.
"You're quite keen on getting me alone, aren't you, Winchester?" Castiel's voice was low, a teasing tone to it, and anybody with a keen ear could have caught on to the intentions of the words.
Silence washed over them. Castiel hiccuped softly, trying to catch his breath as the tears in his eyes poured down his face and onto his thigh. He felt Dean drop to a crouch before him, and not a moment later, there were broad, gentle hands cradling his face. "I'm sorry for not answering. I was mad, Cas, I really was. And I was tired."
"I almost thought you were the one who leaked Anna's nudes. I don't know what I would have done if it really was you." Castiel said, his voice low.
is but, but all I know, is that every morning when I wake up, I'm really thankful that I get to see you."
They would never agree upon certain things. Perhaps, Castiel would always love Led Zeppelin II and Dean would always love Physical Graffiti. Perhaps, Castiel would always love reading, and Dean would always love to tease him for that. Perhaps, Castiel would always scold him for not caring about his own self, and Dean would always look out for Castiel before himself. Perhaps, Castiel would always be a bit of a brat, and Dean would always try to tame him. Perhaps these things might never change, and yet, Dean was ready; had never been as ready before as he was then.
Dean stomped forward, only for Castiel to pull him back, and Dean glared back at him, before turning to Nick and Gordon, his fists clenched and ready for blood.
"Dean," Castiel admonished, but Dean tuned him out in favour of pressing his hands into his face as he sucked in a deep, laboured breath. Castiel seemed to have noticed his lack of attention, because he went silent, and Dean wondered if he would walk away too. Dean wouldn't be surprised if he did.
Castiel sat at his desk in the first row, nibbling at a pen between his fat, pink lips, eyes tracking the way Dean paced from one end of the room to the other, his voice resounding through the speakers at the very top of the classroom, where he continued to ramble about Vonnegut. Inside Castiel, something shifted in his gut, and he clenched his hole, mouth dropping open as he felt the large, cock-shaped plug thrust into his prostate. Dean's come, fresh from the morning when Castiel had woken him up and bounced on his cock, squirmed inside Castiel's stomach.
Before Castiel had time to respond, Dean pulled his cock out and stepped away. He grabbed his husband by the neck and yanked him up, forcing him to look Dean in the eye.
"So, we're cool?" Dean asked, rubbing his thumb down Castiel's jaw. Castiel broke into a grin, and nodded.
Castiel considered it for a moment, "-hmm... Queen, ACDC, Lynyrd Skynyrd... Mm... Pink Floyd... Oh, Aerosmith—"
A small chuckle slipped past Castiel's lips, and Dean watched, slightly hurt, as Castiel's teary eyes blinked up at Anna. "I suppose yes."
As they pulled onto the main street, a comfortable silence settled between them, and Castiel let his eyes wander out the window, simply watching people go about their lives. And yet, Dean's words resonated in his mind, stirring around thoughts and questions, and Castiel wanted to ask Dean some more, pry some more, but he had no right to.
"So," Dean started after a while, "—wanna' grab a bite? I'm starving. Oh, oh," His apple-green eyes lit up, and Castiel couldn't hold back a smile as he watched Dean speak, "—we haven't been on a date, so uh, you wanna' get lunch with me?"
They may have stayed that way for a while, before Dean's stomach rumbled, and they pulled away after a laugh.
With an exasperated eye roll, Dean sat up, and found himself right in Castiel's space. Just a few inches more, and goddamn, he'd be able to taste him, to kiss him. Castiel might be a good kisser, maybe. Or maybe not, since he might never have had practical experience before. Besides, his lips were too chap for someone who was used to kissing. Chapstick. Chapstick would do him good.
"Hey," Dean whispered against the girl's ear, watching as Alastair's eyes narrowed with confusion, "-this guy bothering you?"
Meeting at the library had become one of their routines, since no one ever checked the corners of the library, it was too vast for that, neither did anybody frequent it on a Wednesday afternoon, leaving both men alone. Pretending both of them were strangers was easy. They would avoid each other's eyes, would avoid each other's paths, and would leave the library at different times, with different books, never the same.
"Dean— oh god—" Castiel gasped, only for Dean to press his lips against Castiel's face, not kissing, simple resting.
"Like I said," Castiel gave a lopsided grin, and reached for the glass of whiskey on the table to take a sip, "—try me."
It was a boy, barely eighteen, clad in a soft, oversized graphic t-shirt, and nothing else. At least it seemed to be nothing, until the boy, whose messy, raven-black hair made him look like he'd been fucked to an inch of his life, reached up on his toes to fetch something from a high shelf, and his shirt rucked up. Dean caught a glimpse of pink, but it was enough to have him hitching a breath.
"I'm not perfect, Dean," Castiel sighed, and his lips turned down in a frown, "—I'm far from perfect."
"I'm sorry, man. I really am, please, please just, just try to control yourself, I swear, I mean it, I'm sorry—" Gordon was whispering now, and Castiel almost broken down on the library floor.
"I shouldn't have left," Dean whispered, squeezing Castiel's hands within his own, holding on as if Castiel would disappear the next moment if he wasn't too careful, "-I should have stayed, I'm so sorry," Dean stuttered out, and wiped his face on the back of his palm, before clenching Castiel's hand again.
"Have you ever—" The words caught stuck in his throat, "—have you ever seen—" A sigh slipped past Dean's lips as he turned his eyes away, "—have you ever seen the person you love just, just completely break apart in your hands? And you try to say something, try to do something, but there's nothing you can do to put them together again."
, but it was terrible what they'd witnessed together, and Dean wasn't surprised that it would take Benny time to recover.
"Don't accuse him, okay? Just, just ask him, quietly. Be calm. Dean you—" Benny sighed, "—just remember you'll never be able to see the world from his eyes. You'll never be able to feel the pain and the hurt and the regret that he did on Friday. So just go easy on him, okay?"
Something in the air had changed— gone sour. Bobby shifted from one leg to the other, swallowing thickly as he stared down at Dean. The silence between them had begun to itch Dean, and he sucked in a soft breath to ease himself, because each moment was a dive into his memories— memories where he could feel the way Castiel's shoulders jerked against his shoulders when he cried, or the way his fingers curled around Dean, even the way Castiel smiled against Dean's chest, and Dean could feel the touch of his lips broadening against his own skin. It had been two days since Dean had seen Castiel, and though they called each other during recess and some times in the evening, texted quite frequently, nothing could beat being next to Castiel. He was addictive— everything about him.
"Look, I'm not gonna' get all pally-pally with you just cause you're friends with Cas, but look, I've been where you have, I know how it feels to want to fit in, okay? And sometimes, when we want something so desperately, we end up making bad choices and taking the wrong decisions. I don't blame you for not knowing better, but you can't keep living with that burden holding you down," Dean sighed, and his eyes wandered downward, "—all you can do is think twice before making another decision, and move on. Alright?"
"Like a sixth base." Meg and Castiel chuckled, and silence washed over the rest of their conversation, until at last, Meg spoke up again.
And Castiel realised then in that one second, that yes, he truly did love Dean. Because if he didn't, he would have never trusted those words.
The sexual frustration, paired with Michael's incomprehension of Castiel's high libido, and the painfully boring and innocent conversations between them had pushed Castiel to a new height of anger.
"How can you be so sure?" Castiel asked, his voice barely a whisper. Something about the way Dean smiled then, wide and full of conviction, had Castiel's heart skipping a beat.
of things," Dean grinned shamelessly, bastard that he was, and Castiel chuckled. In an instant, Dean was dashing them up to the bedroom.
Castiel watched as his mother stared down at him, shock, incredulity and pure, unfiltered anger curling at her face as she regarded Castiel.
He set his spoon aside, and thought of what to say, before realising there was nothing he actually could. Every time he thought of it, he could see nothing but Castiel's swollen, miserable face. The fear in his eyes, the pain, the agony, the guilt— Castiel said he was alright, said he wanted to move on, but even then, it had only been three days, and he knew the type of person Castiel was, meaning he would be thinking of it even now. Every morning, the thought haunted Dean— how he hoped he would have never left; how he hoped he could have been earlier— how Castiel would never have gone through what he did if Dean had been there.
"You're hard for me, aren't you, boss?" Castiel whispered, and Dean pushed his ass down harder on his cock, but Castiel simply moaned. "You want to fuck me? Put your cock inside my hole and come in me as much as you can, get me all nice and sticky and wet with your come— you want that, boss?"
A woman walked into the elevator, speaking animatedly on the phone. She smiled at Dean, before turning around and facing the door. But everything she'd been speaking faded into white noise as Dean turned to stare at Castiel, who kept his eyes glued to the door.
Then came Chemistry, Biology, and then there was recess, where everybody but Castiel flooded into the cafeteria.
"If you're going to sit on the first row, Mr. Novak," Dean crooned in his whiskey-smooth voice, "-at least
"— Ah—" Castiel moaned, and let his mouth drop open as Dean grabbed a handful of Castiel's ass, and squeezed the juicy flesh in his hand, loving the way he left a bright red imprint on Castiel's skin. With an ass like that, only a fool would be dumb enough to not worship it. Soft, ripe, big and bouncy— Dean could bounce a quarter off of it if he tried. It was lewd, an absolutely perverted fantasy of Dean's, but he had always wanted to fuck someone who had their guard down— someone who wouldn't see it coming. If it was dangerous or not, he didn't know, but then again, everyone had a reckless side.
"You know Winchester, I'm gonna' make sure my buddies don't kill you today," Alastair laughed, stalking towards Dean with his hands stuffed in his pocket, eyes dark, darting from Dean to Castiel, "-I'm going to make sure they leave you conscious enough so you can watch me eat your boyfriend apart, piece by piece, and not be able to do anything at all."
Castiel's throat went dry as he gazed up at Dean, who appeared to still be in a minute shock over Castiel's existence at Benny's party.
"Well, if there's anything I've learnt over these past few months, it's that blackmailing may not be a good thing, but it sure does get the job done, doesn't it."
"I know you, Dean. I know you're short-tempered, but you aren't reckless. I know everything you do is for a reason," Bobby trudged back to the window and sent Dean a quiet, pleading look, "—why did you do it?"
Castiel snapped his head around to find Dean's eyes glued to the way Castiel's ass was spilling out from the small seat of his chair, and he froze for a moment, realising Dean had witnessed it— the fabric brushing against his taint— and he'd gasped too. Which meant he'd been as surprised as Castiel.
Silence lingered between them, before Castiel sucked in a deep breath, and fluttered his eyes up to meet Dean's.
Music boomed through the three-storey farmhouse, and dim neon lights flickered from red, to green, to blue inside the windows. All three storeys were bustling, the energy in the house above par. Castiel was unfazed, however. He'd been to a few parties before, hosted by his parents' friends. They'd all been lavish and elaborate, but it was the kids, the teenagers that had all the fun. Smoking weed, drinking beer, truth or dare, girls stripping, people grinding and humping each other— it was nothing short of chaotic. It was what Castiel had expected it to be. And yet, the crowd, although smaller than expected, quite buzzed, was new to Castiel, and he decided to simply grab a few drinks, then call his parents' driver to drop him home. Of course, he hadn't come with Dean that night. For reasons.
Castiel swallowed thickly, before rounding the corner, when at once— broad, rough hands grabbed him by the shoulders, and shoved him back into a wall. Castiel gasped, eyes widening as his gaze met a familiar pair of apple-green eyes, staring down at him with such admiration it had his face flushing pink with heat. Dean was dressed in his usual, a black canvas jacket, black jeans, and a grey Henley.
So he barged into the bathroom of the club, and held onto the edge of the sink to calm his breathing. Not a moment later, somebody else barged into the bathroom, and Dean glared up at whoever did. It was Castiel.
"Good. I'll have the bottle." Castiel plucked the bottle ( Hennesy? Corona? He couldn't tell in the dark, not that he could tell the difference between either under normal circumstances), and grabbed an opener. He flicked the cap of the bottle, and flung his plastic cup away, pressing the bottle straight to his lips and guzzling down a mouthful of bitter, shitty beer.
"Dean," Benny was speaking, concern and worry in his voice, and he'd even held him by the shoulder for support, but Dean couldn't hear him. All he could hear was vague, distant mumbling of
Castiel nodded, and rubbed at his eyes, breath shaky and hands trembling. Dean let out a loud sigh, and pressed a kiss to Castiel's head, before pulling away and gazing down at him.
"Okay," Dean hummed, obviously dejected, and as much as Castiel hated being harsh to him, mentally, he wasn't ready for a therapist. There was a great deal of things he would have to face, starting from telling his parents about the rape, down to finding out a good therapist who was able to guide him in the right way. Perhaps some day, he would choose to go to therapy, but for now, he was content with taking rest. Besides, Dean and he had decided already (more like Dean had endearingly threatened Castiel) that Castiel would take a leave from school for at least three days to rest and get better, and over that course of time, Dean would give Castiel the notes for every lesson, every three days.
"You're mine, Cas. And I'll mark you up, just to show the world you are. Remember back when we got our shit sorted, when we got together— I made you a promise. I told you I was here to stay, that I was going to be with you, like it or not. So don't you dare assume, even for a second, that I'd ever let my promise down."
One hour later, Castiel was bent over on the large, rosewood desk in Dean's office, with his shorts pooling around his ankles and his knees spread apart wide as his hole, swollen and gaping, quivered from having been fucked with a plug over and over again. Dean crouched behind him, stealing gentle, sneaky licks from Castiel's hole, and the unpredictability of when his tongue would tickle Castiel's hole and send a wave of pleasure through him had Castiel thrumming with anticipation.
"Thank you," Dean said in a breath, and couldn't believe for a moment that he'd said it, but it was too late to turn back, and Castiel's eyes had already lit up, but Dean simply turned away to avoid him.
"Is it because of what Alastair did." Castiel stated, more than asked, and on instinct, began to pull away, but firm, strong hands held him in place, and when he turned back to Dean again, tears laced Dean's eyes which stunned Castiel for a good, solid moment. Dean wasn't one to cry. He was reticent, rarely ever showed his feelings or shared his problems with Castiel; he repressed them until they ate away at him, but he never let them show, he never cried— but this Dean. This Dean was something unlike the hot-headed volcano of a man that Castiel knew Dean to be. This Dean's eyes were twinkling with tears, and he almost let out a small laugh at that.
Silence settled between them— no, in truth, Nick and Gordon were laughing, but the ringing in Dean's ear had drowned it out. Castiel gulped behind him, and Dean felt his fury rise higher every second.
"You want me to be your slave? To do your assignments and essays for you while you go sleep around with whores?"
The terrace was much windier that morning, and the air felt moist and humid. Dean loosened his tie, and undid the button at the top of his uniform to allow some ventilation for his body. Castiel handed him an earphone, and Dean plugged it into his ear without a thought. They rested their heads against the concrete wall, and Dean fished out a cigarette and a lighter from his pocket, lit it up, and took a drag of it.
Said Dean sucked in a deep breath beside Castiel, and Castiel was brought back to the present. He watched as Dean groaned under his breath, and furrowed his eyebrows, before blinking his hazy, sleep-soaked green eyes open. Their eyes met, and it must have caught Dean by surprise for a moment, since his eyes widened, before a smile spread across his face.
"You didn't have to do that," Dean breathed out, still recovering from that soul-sucking blow job. His legs were as good as jelly, and he had to grab a minute for himself to recompose his thoughts.
"I've always wanted to be a teacher. Or maybe a college professor. I've wanted to teach Literature."
Alastair, but we don't want to be the monster that he is. So please, Mr. Singer. Help us. This school has seen too much of that bastard."
Castiel chuckled. Something about how Dean's eyes gleamed in the sunlight had him entranced for a moment, and he couldn't help but stare at Dean. "I don't think you are."
Dean let the words sink into his chest as he played them in his mind, on repeat in an endless loop. Castiel was sick of him. Castiel was sick of Dean. And Castiel could much rather be with someone better. Someone who thought of Castiel before themselves. Someone who could deserve Castiel. And that's when Dean realised. Maybe it was better if he never called. Maybe it was better if they went their own, separate ways.
Friday was alright, Castiel wasn't lagging behind at school, thanks to Dean's regular updates and tutoring (as wild as it sounded, Dean had taught Castiel three new chapters for a few subjects over the course of three days). Of course, since their classmates had caught wind of their
"I feel it too some times. But I like to believe it doesn't have to do with us as a couple, but more with us as individuals. You have shit to sort, I do too. Maybe you'll never really understand me, and maybe I'll never really understand you. Are you fine with that, Dean?"
Through the grinding, the rubbing, and all the dry humping, Dean had to physically restrain himself from pulling Castiel's underwear down. Even then, he managed to slip his palms inside Castiel's tight shorts, and cupped them over the globes of Cas's warm, round ass, and spread it open, only for Castiel to wince, and Dean froze with a jerk.
Castiel wanted to punch himself in the face, in the gut, right in the fucking' nose, for saying that. Did he really say that? He really said that.
They walked into the living room in silence, before settling down at the couch, and Castiel watched as Meg pushed off her leather jacket to reveal a loose, black tank-top. She spread the jacket across her knees and turned to Castiel.
Castiel beamed at him, punching a fist into the air as he chuckled, and found Dean staring at him, a strangely gentle (very un-Dean-like) expression in his eyes. "I knew it," Castiel grinned smugly, folding his arms across his chest, "-I was right."
The picture was from one of their dates at the Roadhouse, and it was a picture of Dean biting unceremoniously into a big, cheese-loaded hamburger.
Because standing at the terrace attached to the abandoned third floor, leaning over the railing, was Castiel.
"No, I mean… " Meg chimed in, "-what happened on Friday, I know what it was. After that, how have you been?"
Dean raised his eyebrow at that. "I don't want to hide it. I want everyone to know you're mine. See," He brought his finger down to a round, purple mark on Castiel's neck— a hickey he'd left on Cas when they were making out in the shower, "-that's my brand right there, don't want anyone putting their hands on what's mine."
Dean would finally say the things Castiel hadn't been able to, but instead, Dean's hands on his body fell away, and he sighed, "—because I saw the book you brought for me, I didn't want to wait for it any longer."
Behind them, Dean snorted, and Castiel nodded. "Of course Mr. Singer. We know school policy doesn't allow you to participate in all of this. Which is why we appreciate your help so much."
Something in Mr. Singer's eyes softened, and he stepped aside to allow both students in. Castiel noted how Mr. Singer studied his wristwatch, before shutting the door behind them.
"I— could you get Mr. Singer, please? I'd like it if he escorted me back." Castiel whispered, and let out a laboured breath. Alex nodded, and disappeared into the room outside, leaving Castiel alone. Castiel lay his head back down on the pillow, and waited for someone to come get him. Mr. Singer was someone he could trust, and if not Dean, being with Mr. Singer would bring Castiel some peace. He let his eyes slip shut, and recalled the events of the morning.
Dean laughed, and crossed his way into the corridors of Benny's farmhouse for some privacy. He had to call Castiel, he had to make amends, he had to apologize and confess— he only hoped Castiel would take him back. Somewhere in the midst of an empty, darkened corridor, where the music was muted and faint, and silence prevailed over the noise, Dean fished his cellphone out of his pocket, and took a deep, composing breath—
The pressure hit, and Dean came, so so deep inside Castiel. Castiel cried out Dean's name, his face a picture of pure fucked-out ecstasy.
A few choked groans slipped past Alastair's mouth as Dean let him go, and he dropped to the floor— like a bird with its wings clipped. Someone grabbed Dean from the back, it was Gordon, and his fingers dug into Dean's shoulders before moving up to his neck, and Dean grit his teeth together as he gripped the fingers on his neck, and snapped them to the side.
"Yeah, yeah," Mr. Singer hummed, a bit flustered, before he set his glasses on his nose, and pulled a binder from a stack on the desk. He flipped it open, and Castiel watched in silence, as he ran his finger down the page, before giving a satisfied hum, "—according to the information I have, Alastair is scheduled to come back on the second Monday from now, so you have
Dean had never moved faster. His feet had grown a mind of their own as they scampered through the foyer, once again haphazardly kicking and knocking people aside. It earned him a plethora of glares and scowls, but Dean couldn't be less bothered as he ran from room to room. The kitchen was empty, the guest room beside the kitchen was empty, the bathrooms were vacant, and each corridor, although dark, was completely empty.
"Hmm?" Cas hummed, and went about the aisle, browsing through the various books packed into the shelves. Dean stood rooted to the ground, simply watching as Castiel moved effortlessly, and an air of ease and nonchalance surrounded him.
"First," Alastair started, and straightened his shoulders to meet Dean's eyes. Had it not been for Castiel holding him back, Dean would have ripped the bastard to shreds, "—I'm going to tear his clothes off. He'll try to hit me, punch me, slap me– anything to resist me, but let's be real, fag can't even punch right. Then," Alastair glanced back at Castiel, and Dean bared his chest, standing up tall to hide Castiel from his perverted, depraved eyes, "—I'll make sure my buddies hold him down, arms and legs. What a sight, huh? Would you like watching that? No?"
"I— sure." Sam whispered, and the line went dead. About a few, agonizing minutes later, Castiel heard the door click open as softly as it could, and Sam delicately pulled it open, glancing behind his back to make sure he was alone. Castiel slipped in through the gap, and threw his hands around Sam. "Thank you," He mumbled, and ran a hand through Sammy's hair. Sam flushed, before clicking the door shut. He put a finger to his lips, and Castiel nodded.
"For now. We're hoping to get more people soon. But for now, these are the ones who've been there from the start."
Since Castiel wasn't as repulsed by Dean as Michael had been, spending time with Dean was actually refreshing. The boy had a seriously good sense of humour, and hey, they shared a passion for Star Wars and Dr. Sexy and Dean made a mean apple pie. It was about four days into their partnership that Castiel pitched the idea to Dean. He was nervous sure, but he also knew that if this failed, he had other ways to rile up Michael.
"Fuck," Castiel cursed, and Dean rubbed the sticky head of his cock against Castiel's taint, before watching it slide inside. This time, he didn't wait for Castiel to adjust to the pace. He went rough, holding Castiel down with strong, broad hands, basking in Castiel's pained, breathless moans, and pounding away at his tiny, pink hole.
"Are you feeling better? Did you take the meds? And lunch, did you have lunch? The doctor said you need to eat at least one meal before consuming the meds, so don't you dare skip out. Or I'll have to come over and shove it down your throat—"
But the moment the door swung open, who was standing there on his porch but Dean fucking Winchester.
he'd looked that night when Dean had bumped into him on the foyer, and he still did. But more tragic now. More ruined. More broken. More hurt.
The two of them stood at their locker, with Dean lingering behind Castiel as Castiel picked out his textbooks. Anna and Meg were a few feet away, laughing and engaging in what Castiel could only describe as
Michael nodded. "That's the spirit of a man, god, I like you, I do like you, Winchester. And I might like you more if you lost to me."
"I know— I know I promised, but I can't focus— and you, well, you have been more productive in this past hour than I have been in this past
"C-can you go back to your seat, A-Alastair?" Castiel stuttered, and hung his head down, not wanting to meet Alastair's eye.
"Good boy," Dean growled, and fucked into Castiel, slow at first, then gaining pace. Castiel gripped onto the desk, as his knees knocked against the wooden legs of the desk, as Dean nailed into him, every thrust brushing against Castiel's prostate, a show of how well Dean knew each spot inside Castiel.
Broad, callous hands slipped into Castiel's slender, soft ones, and his round, blue eyes dropped down to stare at their twined hands for a moment, before he was letting out the softest of breaths.
Castiel quirked a lip, and followed after Dean who slipped out of the car, and slammed the door shut behind him. They eyed the diner for a few moments, before Dean stretched his arms above his head and yawned. Castiel snorted, and wrapped his hand around Dean's arm with a smile.
Dean watched as Sam hopped onto his bicycle, and drove down the pavement, turning right around the corner.
Without another word, Dean slipped back into his seat, pointedly avoiding Castiel's eyes, and Castiel noticed how being with Alastair had caused him to shift his demeanor so quickly. From soft and funny to cold and brutish.
"Woah, you're a pistol, huh? I did not see that coming," Benny gave a low, incredulous chuckle, and Castiel simply shrugged. He knew the beer would hardly have him drunk, but it would get him buzzed, and that was more than enough. He was ready to make mistakes. He was ready to risk his sanity, his dignity, and perhaps, even his virginity if he found someone hot enough.
Castiel smiled, eyes brightening as he pressed against Dean's side, sliding an arm around his waist to nuzzle into his neck. Perhaps it was the sudden realisation that Dean was here, that he had always been there for Castiel, and how Castiel was lucky enough to have someone who loved him unconditionally.
"You're not being a crybaby, sweetheart, it's alright," Castiel whispered, rubbing a hand down Dean's face, and feeling Dean lean into the touch.
Before he could move however, Castiel was yanking him down in a tight, crushing koala hug, with his thighs and arms wrapped around Dean, not allowing Dean a fraction of mobility, and he couldn't help but yelp as they crashed to the floor.
Castiel let out a low moan and tangled his fingers through Dean's hair as Dean spread him open, causing the air to kiss his quivering hole, sending a shiver down his spine. Dean rubbed his thumb down Castiel's dry taint, before licking a thick, fat strip of spit across it, almost sending Castiel into the void and back at how the pleasure seeped into his veins. Dean pulled Castiel's hole open, letting his tongue prod and play at the throbbing ring of muscle. Castiel was by no means, a stranger to playing with his hole, but in the past few weeks, he hadn't touched himself much. And now, all that pent up tension, all that frustration that wound Castiel up just seemed to drain out of him as Dean's nimble fingers slowly took him apart and put him together.
Castiel's eyes snapped over to meet Dean's. It was the first time Dean had called him, anything besides
"It was easy for you to mould me when I was a child— to manipulate me the way you wanted to, but I'm growing up. I have my opinions, I have my own choices, my own decisions, and I take responsibility for them. And I made a choice to choose Dean as my partner." Castiel sighed, feeling his restlessness grow with every second that passed by, but his mother remained silent. "I don't care if he isn't good enough for you to boast about to your friends, but he's the first person who has ever treated me like I actually matter, he's my best friend, he's my— he means everything to me, and I can't lose him. I could risk losing you, but not him."
At last, when Dean thought it was enough prep, which it so, so certainly wasn't, Dean spat some more on Castiel's ass and on his cock, and pushed into him with one, harsh thrust. Castiel screamed out Dean's name, and Dean clasped a hand over his mouth to suppress his moans. In the mirror, Dean watched as Castiel's face glowed red, and his eyes rolled to the back of his head as Dean fucked into him.
"Novak, boy, please do. Are you feeling better?" Mr. Devereaux asked, his eyes tracking Castiel as Castiel walked into the class.
Without another coherent thought, only an abstract of Castiel's face in his mind, Dean reached for the stairs, but a tight grip on his wrist stopped him, and he turned back to face Benny. His eyes were wide and glowering, lips frowning and sweat beading down his face as he panted, chest heaving with each breath he sucked in. A growl lingered at the back of his throat as he tried to squirm his hand out of Benny's grip.
The air changed, now charged with electricity as Castiel, his gaze steely and determined, trudged over to where Dean was seated at the front of the table. Part of Dean knew he should have stopped Castiel from doing something they would regret, but it was too late. In a second, Castiel was leaning into Dean's space, grinning down at him so wide and free. "Hope you don't mind, boss." He whispered against Dean's ear, and Dean's cock gave an interested twitch.
"Hmm," he hummed, "-keep them. I'm not doing this so you delete the pictures. I just couldn't bear to see the bruise. It weirds me out."
"O-oh," Castiel stuttered, a bit flustered, "-I'm sorry, I, I just sort of, got lost in my thoughts..."
"And then, once he's all tied down and naked, I'll split him open slowly, making sure he feels every thrust, every inch, every push— I'll make sure he knows I'm fucking him as hard as I can—"
Anna's eyes softened, and she blinked them around as if trying to catch some semblance of what she'd heard. "God, I couldn't think he'd stoop that low."
"Mhm," Meg snorted, "—sorry, but I only open up about my deepest darkest insecurities on the third date."
English passed by in a flurry, and so did Calculus, Biology and Geography. Before Dean knew it, it was recess, meaning he ended up at the cafeteria with Benny, who trailed after him quietly. It was strange for Benny to be quiet, especially at recess, but Dean didn't ask him much about it, until they were seated at a table at the far corner of the cafeteria.
The moment Dean's eyes landed on Naomi, he could tell, even from a distance, that she was clearly who Castiel had taken after. Bright, yet deep, wide-set eyes, a slender nose, a chiseled face, thin yet broad pink-tinted lips. Fine wrinkles lined her face, suggestive of her age, and yet, she managed to look as radiant as fearsome. Her chocolate-brown hair was tied up in a hair-bun, and she was dressed in a sleek, glistening peach-coloured pant-suit. Michael, on the other hand, was dressed in a black, long-sleeved polo shirt, paired with beige chino pants. A pair of spectacles sat on his face, and his hair was brushed and set almost immaculate. He seemed a tad bit older than Naomi, with lines along his face as well, and yet, his eyes weren't as blue as his son and wife's, instead, they were a deep, hazel brown, and a strong sternness lingered within them.
?" Castiel asked, batting his eyelashes in a coy, cheeky manner that had the guy next to him blushing too. Dean locked his jaw, and
The crowd shuffled again, and this time the man pressed into Castiel completely shamelessly. He leaned his face into Castiel's shoulder with a dirty, sly grin, pressed his crotch against Castiel's, and held onto Castiel's waist with his broad, warm palms. His breath stunk of alcohol and cigarettes, and he sucked in the air Castiel had let out. Disgust coursed through Castiel's body. Disgust, shame, fear. In the man's green eyes, was a brazen lewd expression— predatory almost, as if he wanted to rip Castiel apart into pieces.
"I know. I understand what you did and why you did it, Dean. I don't forgive you because you and I both know they were extreme, but they don't mean as much to me today as they did before. I love you, I really do. And I want to help you change, and I'm proud of you for doing it."
A wet, gentle laugh bubbled past Castiel's mouth as he hung his head down, "-I'm sorry for pushing you away."
Dean's eyes softened, and his lips spread into a wide smile as he strummed his fingers against the strings of the guitar. "You remember that?"
out of Alastair. Stepped on his ribs, punched his nose off, ruined his jaw. There was so much blood. He broke Nick and Gordon's bones too, their fingers and their ribs," Meg chuckled, "—as much as the bastard annoys me, I wanted to go over and hug him, thank him. I couldn't stop smiling about how Alastair was lying in his own blood."
"It's a pillow fort," Castiel squealed, and Dean watched as he jumped face first into a large, thick mattress on the floor with a loud
The song came to an end, and Castiel scrolled through his playlist. Dean in the meanwhile, crushed the butt of his cigarette against the concrete floor, and turned to Castiel, who glanced up at him once before shaking his head.
"Hey, Cas, I don't wanna' hold you back sweetheart. And I'm always going to be here, so you don't have to be worried about me, 'kay?"
Castiel let out a low groan, and the noise had Dean's cock perking, but he ignored it in favour of shoving the boy down on one of the chair at the dining table, and fetched a rope out of satchel, working quickly as the boy tried to push him, resist him, do anything to rebel against Dean, but Dean secured the rope firmly around the boy's chest, stomach, and legs.
"Dude, you've already made me come once. You keep talkin' like that, and we're going to have to go round two."
Dean sighed for a moment, before draping himself over Castiel and nudging him down into the mattress, making Cas laugh and squirm. He squeezed Cas in his arms, before resting his chin on the boy's chest to gaze up at his bright eyes.
Silence crept up between them, before Dean turned around, grabbed their bags and walked towards the exit, as Castiel followed after him, still smiling giddily for some strange reason. It wasn't until he crashed into Dean's back all at once, that Castiel realised not only had Dean been carrying his bag around, but also that they were the only ones in the school parking lot, and that at that moment, they were standing right before Dean's big, black car.
"Last year," Anna started over, "—near the end of the semester, Alastair started texting me. We were paired up on a project in our biology class so we shared contact information. We started texting, it was alright. I knew he was dating Meg, so I didn't probe much. We talked a bit, and then I started dating Dean, which didn't last long, but you were a part of Alastair's gang," Dean's eyes stooped down to the floor in shame, and he felt Anna's gaze pierce through his skull. Castiel's eyes stared at Dean, and Dean could feel it. He just didn't know what it was within them. "—I erm, I— I don't think I should continue." Anna whispered, when a sharp voice came up from Castiel.
times." Dean sighed, and reached out to grab himself a bottle of water from the fridge. Castiel pursed his lips, sharing a guilty look with Meg before walking over to press a discreet kiss to Dean's lips. But the moment Castiel pulled back, Dean, shameless as he was, pulled him back in for another kiss, and Castiel gave in. Meg, to her credit, was respectfully looking away, until Castiel broke their kiss and cleared his throat.
"I mean, I'm going to be at the library for a little while more," Castiel murmured, and slid his chair back, pushing himself to his feet as if to get away from Dean, "-You should go on home, I don't want to keep you waiting."
Thursday had been hectic— coming back after almost a week, some of his classmates had expressed their concern, and Meg, surprisingly, had been more than welcoming. She'd gone as far as bringing painkillers for Castiel, as well as she would check in with him after every lecture. As loved as Castiel felt, he realised the more pitiful reason behind why she continued to do so— to do for Castiel what she wished someone would have done for her. As upset as Castiel was at that discovery, he didn't bring it up with Meg, simply to respect her decision to move on. Dean however, had been annoyed by Castiel and Meg's sudden, fast-paced friendship. Maybe because Dean had been unaware of what Alastair had done to Meg, so he assumed she was still one of Alastair's gang members. Though Castiel desperately wanted to let Dean in on his and Meg's shared trauma, he knew better than to violate Meg's privacy.
And that arrogance, boy, that arrogance got on Castiel's nerves. He sucked in a breath. He was right, and he knew it.
Alright. Enough was enough. Castiel needed action, and he wasn't going to let a woman like Berry stop him from getting in the way of it. "Meg, you're father owns The Times Express, doesn't he? Think he'll listen to me if I want to get an article published? About his daughter? About Lawrence High? I mean, last time I checked, the Novak, Masters, and Milton families are some of your highest donors, losing them would mean losing some of your biggest financial funders. Oh, and Ben, you're mother's a lawyer, isn't she? Think we can get enough help? I mean, Alastair is old enough to be tested as an adult. Us on the other hand, some of us are still minors. Mrs. Berry. Now, it's your call."
That only had Castiel laughing more, and he slapped a hand over his mouth to refrain his laughter, lest John hear it. But Dean pulled his hand away, and curled it around his head. "I like it when you laugh. Every time you laugh, I feel like I'm falling in love with you again."
"That's what it took for you to realise you were a bad person?" Castiel asked, his voice broken, "—at my cost? At the cost of my, my everything? Why me, Gordon? Please, I need you to tell me. Why me?" Castiel's shoulders wracked with sobs as he hunched over, stifling a cry in his hands. He felt someone try to hold him by the shoulder, but he jerked the touch away. "Don't touch me, don't fucking touch me."
"More what? And did I say you could call me Dean? Where's your manners?" Dean growled, and plunged the plug inside Castiel's hole. Instead of thrusting it, he twisted it around with loud, wet squelches, and Castiel's jaw dropped open as he let out another moan, and curled his toes, bucking his hips back against Dean's face.
Castiel hummed at that, before closing the binder, and tossing it on to the table. "Revise it? I suggest renewing it from the start. Even an amateur could do better."
"Dean," Castiel whispered, trying to hide the trembling of his lips, "-I love you too. I never said it back last night."
Dean went silent once again, and yet, Castiel was focused onto nothing but him, watching and studying him, listening with rapt attention.
"Oh?" Castiel turned around, facing Dean. Castiel's face had gone pale and wet, and his eyes had swollen up all red and pink, "—is that not why you've been trying to set me up with someone? It's just an excuse, isn't it? So you can get me off your back? Well, you could just say it to my face, I won't mind—"
Dean looked lost for a second, before his face lit up. "You know what," He started, his eyes bright and intrigued, "—I asked Bobby the same thing the other day."
Guilty silence met Castiel's words, and all Dean could do was watch, entranced, as his boyfriend thundered down on the people in the class.
A few minutes later, when Dean had made sure to tend to every tiny bruise on Castiel's face, and after Castiel had spent ten more minutes kissing Dean senseless, they decided to move to the kitchen for some breakfast.
"No, it's too much—" Castiel moaned out, digging his fingers into Dean's shoulders as he felt his hand milk him dry. Dean groaned, and let out soft curses under his breath, before spilling into his own hand, and staining Castiel's t-shirt with thick, white blobs of semen.
Castiel let out a choked whine as he came, splattering hot, thick white come across his chest. Dean followed not long after, coming inside Castiel deep and thick. His seed spread around the insides of Castiel's hole, leaving him sticky and slick and wet, but instead of pushing out the come inside him, Dean plugged Castiel up with his gorgeous pink glass plug. A small, thin drizzle of come trickled down Castiel's taint. Dean ran a finger through it before holding the finger out in front of Castiel.
Dean let out a staggered breath. His fists curled, his jaw tightened, and he felt his chest ache with nausea at the thought that—
Oh, Christ, you're obsessed with this thing, aren't you?" Dean laughed, and Castiel froze. He wasn't sure why he was surprised to know Dean had seen his post. Maybe Dean was on OnlyPics too, and wait, did he follow Castiel? How was he able to see his post so quick? Usually, it would take people at least an hour to start commenting or liking the post. Unless. Dean was following Castiel— no, he must be stalking him for more blackmail. Fuck.
"Another fight?" Castiel asked, as if exasperated, and his shoulders drooped as he moved aside to let Dean in. Dean swallowed nervously, and followed him inside wordlessly.
Castiel would stop him. He paused. He turned his head around ever-so-slightly, and caught the silhouette of Castiel's face, wet and glowing in the moonlight, with a thousand unsaid words lingering on his lips, but Castiel never turned around. Not once. He didn't stop Dean, he didn't call out for him, he let Dean go. He just let Dean go. Just like that. After everything they had been, after everything they had shared, Castiel wanted to let it all fade away into some distant part of their memories, as if it had never existed.
"You won't ever leave, right?" Castiel asked, childish, as it may have been, round eyes peering up at Dean, who brushed some hair away from Castiel's forehead and sent him a vague smile.
"Is this what the rest of you are alright with?" Bobby asked, and held the drawing up. Castiel studied it for a few seconds and nodded, while Benny snorted at Dean's drawing. "Alright then," Bobby added, and set the page down on his desk. "Let's get to work, okay? Start from step one, and let me know if anything goes wrong or if you need help."
The sound of a throat clearing pulled both Dean and Cas out of their moment, and they turned to the side to find Mr. Singer watching them from a few feet away. Oh shit, Bobby saw them? Saw them
The moments they'd shared, where the tension between them had almost become palpable, and their faces; lips had been mere inches away— they were simply accidents. They meant nothing to Dean, and yet, everything to Castiel, because they were a few, fleeting moments where Castiel could claim Dean as his own. A few moments where their skin would touch, and Castiel would feel a spark igniting under his flesh. But Dean would never feel those. He would never understand Castiel. He would never understand how
Sighing, he sunk down against the railing, feeling strangely empty now that Castiel wasn't here to press against his side.
Mr. Singer hummed, and stepped aside to let them in. Castiel walked in, followed by his group of friends behind him, until the door shut, and Bobby walked over to the back of his desk, and grabbed his seat. He urged the four of them to sit down, and erm, there were only two chairs, so Dean, chivalrous as he was, offered up his seat for Castiel, and Benny for Meg.
"I get it, I'm sorry. You're not broken, Cas, not at all. And what happened to you absolutely doesn't define you and it sure as heck shouldn't stop you from being happy. And I get it, okay, I really do. There's, there's things you can't tell me right now, I'm cool with that. Take your time. But please, if it ever gets too much, you'll tell me, right?"
?" Dean asked, as he snatched the spoon of ice-cream Castiel was going to eat and ate it instead (Castiel kicked him in the gut).
"Hey," Castiel called out, and slipped a hand over Dean's jaw, rubbing a thumb over his cheek, "—thank you for looking out for me, Dean."
Castiel to become his personal slave. It wasn't half as bad as Castiel assumed it would be. For starters, Dean never spoke to him in class, only taunts and insults, which Castiel was thankful for. After class, Dean would lay down a stack of notebooks and binders on Castiel's desk, and send him a charming grin, one that made Castiel want to rip his guts out, and the only instruction was
"Dad," Dean called out after a few seconds of lingering at the door. The only response Dean received was a disgruntled hum. "Castiel and his parents want me to come over for dinner. Mind if I go? I'll stay the night at his place."
The timer of the video beeped, and indicated the end of the video, and Castiel hastily pulled his trousers up and zipped himself. He grabbed his phone off the toilet-seat lid and browsed through his gallery to review the video he had just recorded. The video played, and Castiel watched himself bent over against the wall, only his hips and legs in view as he spread his knees apart and stretched his ass wide open, watching as the green plug fluttered inside his asshole.
Unable to find his voice, Dean simply watched Castiel, before croaking out hoarsely, "—The things he said about you, I should've emptied a whole fucking pistol into his head then and there—"
Dean sighed, and slipped his phone back into his pocket, pushing himself up to his feet to make his way back to class.
Dean dropped his keys into the bowl near the door, and let his backpack sit against the wall as he kicked his shoes off, and trudged into the passage with heavy footsteps. He was tired. The deadlines at Sandover were coming closer each day, and each day, Dean had to toil harder at his desk. His head ached with the throb of a soon to come migraine, and his muscles had all but gone sore. With a sigh, he walked into the living room, where he could hear the sound of a video game playing. His boyfriend was sure to be there, and Dean hoped Castiel would be able to make him feel better.
"Fuck," Castiel groaned, and their eyes met for a moment, both hazy with lust and high from their orgasms.
Castiel sighed, and grabbed his History workbook with him as he slipped out of the empty classroom, and sneaked his way into the emergency staircase, where he climbed up to the abandoned third floor, the same place he had taken several of his OnlyPics hits, and discreetly, pulled his phone and earphones out of his pocket. He decided to go to the terrace, which was attached to the third floor. The terrace was Castiel's favourite hideout, since the railing was made out of solid concrete, and when Castiel sat huddled against it in the corner,
Silence evaded the room, and Castiel snapped his eyes up to meet Dean's. Dean watched him for a moment, how wrecked he looked. He remembered somewhere in the back of his mind, how
Mrs. Berry grinned. "Lawrence High's name in this country has remained untarnished for years. What do you kids think you can possibly do?"
"I erm, I was going for a walk this morning, I erm, I needed some air and I thought I'd give you your notebooks too, so you could have ample time to study for the test on Monday, because surely, you don't expect me to write both yours
Dean pulled away, and fixed everyone in the room a charming smile, "-thank you for being with us, gentlemen. It was a pleasure meeting you. I'm afraid Mr. Novak and I have some things to discuss in private. I hope to see you all again soon." And with a courteous nod, he held his hand out for Castiel, who stared at it for a moment, before slipping his own, warm calloused hand into Dean's.
But the next moment, Castiel opened his eyes, and met Dean's at once. Their breaths hitched, and yet neither of them pulled away, simply staring at each other, before Castiel's eyes dropped down to Dean's cheekbone, and he grazed the tip of his finger across the bruise. Dean winced, but couldn't find it in himself to move away.
Michael led Dean over to a seat in the parlor, and sat down on the seat right across it. Dean sat, nervous and fidgety at first, since he felt strangely out-of-place in the room. But then Michael began to speak, and Dean shifted his attention to him.
"Cas," Meg started after a few seconds, "-you've always been alone. Didn't you ever feel the need to fit in?"
Maybe Castiel never should have invited Dean over. Maybe he shouldn't have been to hasty and rushed into it. Despite having promised to Castiel to be on her best behaviour, Naomi had ended up doing exactly what she had vowed not to. She had been so convincing in the morning— almost had Castiel fooled right through.
Bile rose at the back of Dean's throat as he croaked out at last, "-I think Alastair's going to rape—"
A beat passed between them, before Castiel was fuming, and he smacked the book right across Dean's face with a hopeless groan.
Castiel whimpered, and raised his ass higher till it brushed right over Dean's cock. Dean grabbed him by his hips, and pressed his large, aching cock against Castiel's tiny, slick hole. With one hand on Castiel's hips and the other guiding his cock inside, Dean sunk into Castiel. Sinking into Castiel's tight, wet heat, and the feeling of holding onto his peachy, ripe ass when fucking into him was a luxury Dean was blessed enough to experience every, single day. The slide of his cock inside Castiel, when he was down on his stomach, was something Dean would never give up for anything. Even when they had missionary, the grip of Dean's hands on Castiel's hips, the pressure of Castiel's legs around Dean's neck— it was nothing Dean had ever felt before. Pure, unadulterated ecstacy.
Hands slid across his shoulders, rubbing and patting, and Dean let Bobby pull him close. Bobby's arm felt safe, and for a moment, everything was too overwhelming, and Dean wanted nothing more than to pour his guts out, but he sniffled, and tried to compose himself with a hiccup.
Castiel laughed nervously, before rubbing a hand at his neck, and snapping away from Dean. A bright, red blush spread from the tip of his nose to the tip of his ears, and it made Dean smile wider, knowing he wasn't the only one flustered by their sudden intimacy.
"I dated Alastair throughout junior year. I liked him, at first, y'know. He was badass, he was ruthless, he was—"
"You're gonna' re-do my work. And I'm gonna' be watching you, smartass, so don't try bein' a bitch again."
Standing at Castiel's door, Dean was hit with a strange sense of deja vu, as he recalled the first time he'd felt something other than hostility towards the boy. Perhaps it had been in the way Castiel had nursed his bruise, despite it being barely visible in the light, how their faces had been close, too close, and Dean wondered distantly, how freaking clueless he'd been. If only someone had told him back then, that someday, he would need Castiel as desperately as he needed the air to breathe, he would have laughed in their face, and called them an idiot for even thinking Castiel would ever be a
people considered him to be at school. The wind seemed to tangle through his hair and kiss his face, leaving a soft pink blush on his nose and cheeks, and as Dean watched, he noticed it rose up to the tips of Castiel's ears.
"Yadda, yadda, yadda. All bark and no bite, aren't you, Dean-o? Can't even fuck someone up without gettin' all touchy feely. Fuckin' fag." Alastair patted Dean's cheek, and Dean shook his hand off with a growl, trying to squirm out of Castiel's tight, iron grip on his shoulder.
Before Dean knew what to say, Castiel turned to walk away, but it seemed as if Dean's body reacted before him, and he held a hand out to grab Castiel's wrist, pulling Castiel closer to him.
Their lips met in the middle, intense and desperate, as Castiel scrambled to pull Dean in closer and closer, scratching at his canvas jacket and rocking their bodies together. The air around them was thick with arousal and impatience. Castiel had already begun to feel the first few traces of his arousal reaching down between his legs, and the bulge in Dean's pants kept brushing against Castiel's taint through the fabric of Castiel's thin trousers.
Dean sighed, and leaned back against the base of the tree, uncapping the cap of his water bottle to press it to his lips. Sweat dripped down his brow. His football jersey, a yellow and red jersey with the school logo on it, was soaked with sweat for having played in it for hours. After school football practice had become a routine on Thursdays, and those were the only days Dean and Castiel parted ways when school finished. Water dribbled down Dean's lips, and he ran a hand through his sweaty, damp hair, before reaching for his phone. Practice had just ended, which meant everyone had a while to relax before showering. The sound of grass crunching softly under somebody's feet caught Dean's attention, and he glanced up only to find Benny leaning against the tree beside him.
"T-thanks," Dean managed to mumble, before turning his face down to hide it on the pretence of reading the questionnaire.
"Okay, shut up," Dean sighed, and slipped off the stool, obviously trying to stifle his smile, as he walked to the sink with his empty dish. Castiel followed after him, and they rinsed up the dishes in silence, before making their way into the bedroom again.
Benny had a point. He really did. And now that Dean thought of it, he was right. Why should Dean care what people thought of him? Or of Castiel? If anything, it would be better if people knew Castiel belonged to Dean, they'd trouble him less at school that way. But then there arose the question of
"Don't you think you talk too much?" Castiel asked, and turned around to meet Dean at last. His face was pink, eyes were wide and dilated, and his lips were slick, as if he'd been licking them over and over again, and ah, he just licked them again—
Things had been normal. Perfect. Ideal. Not a single thing to have hindered Castiel in any way. But then there was the sight of Gordon, and with it, the memories of being used, being played with, being assaulted— and the worst of it all, they'd kept Castiel awake through it all. No one but Alastair, Gordon and Nick knew the entirety of what went down at the farmhouse that night. Not Dean, not Benny, nobody but Castiel knew what it felt like, or what actually happened.
There were hands on his shoulder— soothing him, guiding him— the voice of a woman, it was Meg, it was undoubtedly Meg, and she was whispering to Castiel, telling him to be strong, but Castiel couldn't. The ground slipped from below Castiel, and he felt his body drift to the floor. With each passing second, his eyesight grew hazy, and at last, the colours blended into black, until black was all he could see. He wasn't even sure if his eyes were open or not, or if he was even breathing, but there was a loud scream, it was Meg, she was screaming out Dean's name. And Dean's name was the last thing Castiel heard before he slipped out of consciousness.
"Why do you keep doing this?" Dean asked, his voice unexpectedly exasperated as he clutched his head in his hands.
The words pulled an unbidden laugh past Castiel's lips, and he pulled away to stare up at Dean, "-is that so? Was it that light of a punch?"
Lisa rubbed a thumb across Dean's jaw. Castiel remembered how it had felt under his own skin. Soft, but dotted with the slightest of stubble.
, but Dean couldn't care, because he needed to come, needed to fuck something, needed to let go of all that tension in his body.
Dean did not say a word. Castiel steadied his breath, and wiped away a few stray tears on the back of his palm. Once he recognised his neighborhood, he turned to Dean, who was driving with his eyes fixed to the road, never deviating. Saying something would have pierced the silence between them, and Castiel didn't find it in himself to risk that, for he knew once he said something, he wouldn't be able to take it back. Dean's eyes flickered from the front to the side, and he pulled the car into the driveway of the Novak residence, before shifting gears and turning to Castiel.
Their bodies moved in a quick, haphazard rhythm with Dean thrusting into Castiel with all his might. Castiel felt his thighs tremble as he held them around Dean. The sheer force of Dean pounding into him was enough to bring him over the edge, and yet, Dean managed to brush against Castiel's sweet spot.
Dean hummed around his cock, and carefully spread Castiel's legs apart, eyes bright and filled with mirth as he sucked Castiel, laving his tongue around every crevice and curve, licking at his frenulum, soaking the head with spit, sucking and nipping. It was strange how Dean could fit Castiel's whole cock inside his mouth, of course, given it was smaller than average.
Softly, the drift of slumber began to tug Castiel away from the present, and he found himself falling to sleep. But the warm touch of Dean's skin to his own persisted throughout the night.
Alastair watched him, but Dean turned away from him, instead letting his feet carry him towards Castiel. Each step Dean took closer to Castiel only curdled his blood, and he could see, clearer now, how Castiel's lip bled, how his teary eyes were swollen from crying, how his jaw was dotted with blue and purple bruises. Dean reached out, and Castiel flinched.
"I, uh, I dated Alastair for about a year because I thought he was cool, and badass, and my type. And I thought he cared for me, but he didn't. I was naive, stupid, desperate. And the tipping point was at junior prom. Uhm—" Meg swallowed thickly.
"We all need attention, Cas. We all wanna' feel important, and that we matter to someone. It's as human as can get, if you ask me."
"Well, this ain't really a Supreme Court case, so I think, yeah, it might just work. And the thing about pressurising authority— pretty neat. Bully them until they don't have a choice. But you're going to have to keep this whole viva la revolution attitude going. If you falter, you lose your chance. Unity is the key, okay?"
"You better," Benny smiled vaguely, and Dean felt himself being pulled back down to the ground, now nearing the downfall of the high of his adrenaline.
Their eyes met for a single second, and Castiel pushed his tongue into his cheek. This was fun. This was hella' fun. Watching Dean having to take the bait helplessly.
. Castiel arched off the wall, grinding his ass down to lather his insides with Dean's fresh, hot, come, and Dean almost groaned at the feeling of having Castiel's ass use his cock. Loud, filthy squelches filled the air as Castiel kept fucking himself on Dean's spent cock. It was quick, dirty, fast, and every thing Dean could ever imagine.
." Dean bit out, and Castiel held a hand out to hold him down. Castiel appreciated Dean's passion for this cause, but his short-temper could end up sabotaging this conversation.
Castiel stared at Dean for a moment, before turning to Meg, "-that's exactly what we wanted to talk to him about. Dean, baby," Cas smiled, pulling a flustered Dean in for a kiss by the lapels of his jacket, "-thank you so much."
"Just roughening him up. Stole some cash off the fag." It was obviously a lie, and Castiel realised sooner than he liked, that hanging out with Castiel was
"I already have what I want, Cas. Besides, I don't have big dreams. I don't want to touch the sky or anything, or bathe in money. I just want a family I could lean on, a good, secure job that would help me keep them safe, my Baby, and some pie."
"B-boss?" Castiel asked, uncertain, as Dean flipped him around, and bent him over the sink, forcing him to look at himself in the mirror in front of him.
The elevator dinged once again, and this time they'd reached Dean's cabin. Dean grabbed Castiel by the hand, not caring about the woman, as he dashed out the door, Castiel dragging behind him as they crossed the distance towards the sleek, brown rosewood door to the cabin. A bang and a thud, and they were locked inside.
"Me too," Castiel whispered, and crumpled the front of Dean's shirt in his hand as he tugged Dean down for a long, wet kiss. It felt magical, and cheesy as it may have been, time seemed to stop for a few seconds as they kissed, their hands still wrapped around each other. It made Castiel realise once again, how much Dean meant to him, and how he craved to be with Dean always. Their eyes met, and Dean's bright green eyes regarded him with a strangely fond expression as they dived in for another, brief kiss. Castiel pulled away first, and Dean groaned in protest, only causing Castiel to chuckle and push him away.
"Good," He quirked a lip, "-next time, don't fuck up. I made you keep your panties on this time, next time I won't."
Naomi gasped at Dean's tone, but refrained from commenting. Michael, a silent spectator so far, decided to continue being silent, never saying a word back to his wife.
"Hey," He croaked out, trying his hardest to not let Castiel know he was on the verge of crying. Dean flicked his cigarette away and crushed it under his foot. He wiped a hand over his face, and pressed his phone to his ear.
"He's resting. He's a bit sick." Dean leaned forward, cold eyes staring into the boy's, "—you wanna' know more?" He growled, and watched as the boy retreated to his desk with a soft apology.
and that's when Dean felt the need to step in. "Hey, hey, cut it out. Cas isn't like us, guys. He doesn't like this stuff."
"Nah," Dean said, recalling Castiel's words, and the way he'd looked that day— resplendent. It had only been a week, but Dean had controlled his urge to smoke. Every time he wanted to, he thought of Castiel, and the fact that Castiel hated the smoke of a cigarette, and how Dean had to do this for him.
Castiel yawned, and rolled over onto his back, staring up at the ceiling and hoping it would help him form a coherent thought.
"Well, I'm dressed to impress, sweetheart." Dean smirked, watching as Castiel grinned and stepped aside.
Castiel jerked at that, and turned around in his seat, feeling Dean's disgusting eyes track over his body.
With that, he tossed his phone aside, and sat up on the bed, pulling on a pair of sweatpants that clung to his ass, and sauntered down the stairs, into the kitchen. Right as he ducked into the fridge to grab a piece of chocolate, the doorbell rang.
"You stood up for me, Dean. I don't think there's anything more you could've done. I'm so proud of you."
His words trembled, and Castiel noted how his eyes had lined with a sheen of tears, and he realised at once, Dean was serious, that he was struggling, that he wasn't the careless, mischievous delinquent Castiel had always thought him to be, and Castiel realised, that stepping into Dean's shoes was something he could never truly understand. Dean and he led two very distinctly different lives, and perhaps, there was a reason, something that had pushed Dean to become into what he was today, and knowing that he was sharing it with Castiel, letting himself be vulnerable, Castiel could do nothing but hold back his awe.
Castiel smiled, and let his fingers play with Dean's hair, curling them and brushing them as Dean rucked his shirt up to his chest, and kissed his navel.
"Well," Naomi started, obviously flustered by Dean's comment, "—I just think he isn't working hard enough."
"I saw your face, it ain't good anymore," Dean grumbled, and waited for Castiel to step in. Castiel's smile dropped, and for a moment Dean regretted saying that, but he couldn't turn back time, and the silence between them had now turned sour.
Dean paused. A sudden pang of uncertainty washed over him. He wanted to stay calm, to be positive and to be true, to let them know that he only meant Castiel well, but somehow, Dean found himself doubting his own actions. What if he did or said something offensive, and never even realised it? How off-putting would that be. The Novak's would surely despise him. But then again—
Dean backed Castiel up until the smaller boy was pressed into the teacher's desk, and flipped him over so his stomach pressed into the table. Dean snapped Castiel in half, shoving him down roughly on the surface and keeping him there with a hand on his face. It was rough, quick, vulgar and everything Castiel had craved for. His cock leaked with arousal, and behind him, he could feel his trousers being pushed down to his ankles along with his underwear. Castiel shut his eyes, and felt the big, hot and heavy bulge of Dean's cock against his bare ass.
"No," He smiled innocently, and leaned down to press his lips to Dean's. Dean tried to turn them over, but Castiel simply pinned his arms to his side, and rubbed his hips over Dean's crotch, much to Dean's
s here and there, and it got Dean's cock throbbing, but no. He was a creep, a sick, twisted psycho pervert.
Castiel felt his chest ache for both Dean and Meg. He wondered why he never felt the need to fit in. Perhaps, he did— always had, and that's why he used OnlyPics. Maybe that was how he coped.
"Mr. Novak has also called in sick, he will be absent till Thursday, please do take care of your classmate when he returns."
Dean paused in his tracks, and Castiel watched his face falter as he struggled for words, before grabbing Castiel by the hands and rubbing his thumb over the ring on, Castiel's finger, "—hey, sweetheart, you know I didn't mean it that way. I just, didn't know how else to put it. I'm sorry."
they took every chance to tease them about it. Benny, who had bonded with Castiel over the past few days, would shout out inappropriate comments in the middle of lectures, and as funny as it was for the rest of the class, it was embarrassing for Castiel. Castiel remembered how the last lecture of Friday had been a sex-ed lecture, and Dean, being the most disruptive in the class, had been called on to demonstrate how to quickly slip a condom onto a plastic banana. Unfortunately for Dean, who got his fingers slippery, the condom took him a whole six minutes to get on, and Benny,
Dean leaned in for a fraction of a second, before letting go of Castiel and staggering back a few steps.
"I know… But forget about that. What colleges are you applying to?" Castiel asked, and Dean quirked his lips. He pulled his phone out, and began surfing through his playlist, before putting on a Black Sabbath song.
Quietly, he plugged his earphones into the earphone jack, and pressed play on his favourite playlist. At once, Led Zeppelin's Tangerine blasted through the earphones, and he hummed along to the tune. He grabbed his workbook, and flipped open to the chapter they were being tested on after lunch. It was their last lecture for the day, after which they would be on their way home. Castiel skimmed through the questions, feeling his memory jog and the images from the night before flashed clearly in his mind.
"Sam doesn't go to my high-school. He's yet to join, but I know he will be next year," Dean said, and tried to scoop some of the gravy into his mouth.
I had intended to make this fic much smuttier, but the boys have a mind of their own. But I promise, the angst and smut tag is up there for a reason, and it will be coming soon. Here is the chapter you must have been waiting for sincerely.
"Eh, I don't even know if I'm applying." Dean said after a while. "I mean, I'm already eighteen. Once I graduate high school, I'm just gonna' join dad. Look, I love the work he does, okay? Cars, antique, classic cars— but I've got some large scale renovation ideas going on for that place. Maybe I'll broaden it out, get a few more people, shine up the place."
Since I made you guys wait for so long the past week and also suffer, here is some fluff, a smidge of smut, and a lil dash of hurt/comfort.
Dean shrugged, and nudged Castiel down on the edge of the bed, before dropping down to a crouch before him.
Heat crawled under Castiel's skin, and he shoved his tongue into his cheek to hold back a wide smile. He nodded slowly, and let his face hang down, only for Dean to tilt his chin up and press a kiss to his lips.
"Sam— do you think Sam could help me? I know he's not in our school, but he could help us formulate some kind of systematic campaign, right? He's smart, and he's organised, maybe he can help? What do you feel?" Castiel asked, as he sat up and hovered over Dean, pressing a hand into Dean's chest softly.
Driving back to Castiel's house had been one of the most harrowing, nerve-wracking, and impatient drives Dean had ever experienced. The desperation to see Castiel, paired with his penchant for being tetchy when things went against the way he wanted them to, caused Dean to become a tangled bundle of nerves by the time he arrived at the house. Dean pulled into the pristine, wide driveway, and cut the engine. He felt the Impala's steady purring falter, and fade into silence, before he stepped out of the car, and let his eyes wander over the large, elegant house before him.
That being said, I do hope that you continue to support this fic as you always have, and that your comments (although I don't tend to respond) are the very reason that I continue to write my fanfics.
His eyes wandered over to Dean, whose face was stoic, but Castiel knew that look. The gears in Dean's mind were crunching, he was contemplating about something— Castiel couldn't tell what, but he knew it was
Castiel considered it for a moment, and Dean killed the engine. The two of them stepped out of the car, and walked over to the front door where Dean jangled a small bunch of keys in his hands. "Let's wait for Sam, 'kay?"
"Mhm," Dean hummed, and squeezed Castiel in his arms, "—at least I have you." He fluttered his eyes open, and gazed down at Castiel. The two of them shared a tender look, before Dean leaned down to press his lips against Castiel's, sliding his hands under Castiel's shirt and over his warm body. But that was that. He never pushed Castiel on, and simply lay snug next to Castiel. Castiel smiled, and curled his arms around Dean.
Castiel seemed to calm down at the sound of that, as he sniffled, and rubbed his hands over his face. "You're not allowed to leave me."
"Fuck—" Dean hissed, long and incredulous, as he twitched inside Castiel's mouth. Castiel groaned around Dean's cock once, before bobbing his head down with obscene, wet slurps. He made sure to look up at Dean, whose eyes darkened the moment they met Castiel's. Castiel knew Dean loved watching him. Watching how spit dripped down his chin, how his eyes teared up, how his tongue laved around, how his cheeks hollowed out.
"No, but in a while he will be. We've got some time to ourselves, sound good?" Dean asked with a cheeky smile, and Castiel pushed his face away with a laugh.
Castiel smirked "Perhaps we should move to somewhere quiet…" He mused, and yet, didn't make an effort to stand or move in the slightest. But his eyes were challenging, and Dean knew exactly what he wanted to do. So, Dean rose from his chair, and with him some of his men rose too. But he waved a hand at them to dismiss them, and walked around the table— every step bringing him closer to Castiel. It wasn't until he was right at Castiel's side, that he leaned down over Castiel's shoulders, and ghosted his lips against the man's ear.
"Dean, why are you being so rude?" Sam's words, his raised voice, the teary, puppy expression on Castiel's face, it brought Dean crashing back to the present, and he wondered why he was being so touchy this morning.
Thank you for your immense support so far, and I promise I will be back with a better chapter in a little while!
Dean stood silent, hoping to let John's words fade from his mind as he hummed in answer, and threw some bacon onto the pan.
"Ah," Dean clicked his tongue, all male bravado on display, "-what was that?" A sharp tug at Castiel's arm had him arching off the wall and crashing against Dean's chest, causing both boys to moan softly. Castiel's eyes fluttered open, and he tried to suppress the blush rising on his face, but failed.
"For a minute, I thought it was me too. I troubled a lot of people, Cas. I was a bully. And I'm sorry, I truly, deeply am. I'm trying to make things better, and I swear, I won't be the person I was before ever again. For you, Cas. For us. For our future."
Dean snapped his eyes up to meet Castiel's, whose face was flushed with heat, and gaze nothing short of lewd, just begging to be fucked to an inch of his life.
"Hey, okay, alright, Cas—" Dean started, a bit panicked as he rubbed a hand over Castiel's jaw and tried to get him to look up at Dean, but Castiel couldn't stop crying as he mumbled to himself, over and over again, until at last, he felt Dean speak again, "—Cas—" Dean said, louder and alarmed, as he scrambled through the room for a bottle of water, and pressed it to Castiel's lips. Castiel let the water run down his throat, a much-needed relief, before setting it away. He sucked in a deep breath, and turned his gaze up to meet Dean's nervous, stricken eyes.
Dean's footsteps were heavy and slow as he climbed up the stairs, and snuck into the terrace. He let his bag fall to the side, and walked over to where he had been sitting with Castiel a few days ago. Castiel paused at the corner for a moment, not wanting to surprise Dean, because hey, who knew what Dean would do if he was frightened, punch someone maybe? And Castiel was not in the mood to be
Now that Naomi had nothing to say to Dean, she turned to Castiel. "This is who you choose? Out of the million men who could love you, cherish you, and be respectful and classy at the same time, you choose a mutt. An pathetic rebel with no manners, no respect for his elders, no morals—"
Dean sucked in a shallow breath, feeling himself fluster under Benny's eyes as he hung his head down and shrugged. "Nah, uhm, it's for a friend."
Castiel hopped off the bed, and Dean sprang up to help him down. It irked Castiel for a moment, that Dean was being a wee bit
"R-right," Castiel stuttered, and took his bag from Dean's hands, and slipped into the passenger seat, while Dean slipped into the driver's seat. Sitting in Dean's car, side by side with Dean, it was an experience Castiel had never thought he'd ever feel. The car was everything Dean was. Big, loud, shining— and it smelled like Dean's cologne— something Castiel would never tire of. Dean grabbed onto the back of Castiel's seat as he turned his head back to reverse the car out of the parking lot. Castiel watched him, strangely captivated as he watched Dean drive, focused and natural, as if he'd been doing it for ages. But then again, like Dean said, his father owned a garage, maybe Dean was used to being around and driving cars. His hands were rough too— coarse palms that you'd get if you used work with your hands a lot.
Dean had said things had been rough between them for a while, but now though, Castiel could see, the two of them had reached the point of breaking.
"Inside me, daddy, I want your come inside my cunt—" Castiel cried out, and bounced his ass back on Dean's cock, taking it in deep— as deep as he could, like a cock-hungry whore, and Dean pounded him, no mercy at all, as he watched Castiel squeeze the couch, and whine, his delicious, breathy moans and his soft, needy cries filling the air as Dean fucked into his tiny, puffy red hole, before jerking inside him, and slamming in. His orgasm struck him at once, and Dean held onto Castiel's waist as he came in thick, hot, white splurts, and flooded Castiel's inside with his seed.
Their eyes met, and Castiel decided to tease Dean by holding his gaze, and sucking the back of the pen into his mouth. Dean did not falter, although his eyes lingered on the pen for a few seconds, before he turned to face the others in the classroom, and continued to discuss the symbolisms in Slaughterhouse Five.
Dean stepped away, pulling his knife away from the boy's throat, when at once, the boy kicked him in the gut, which had Dean faltering back, as the boy scampered to find something, and at last, settled for—
"You don't have to keep it in anymore," He whispered the words prompting him to think of Dean, who'd said the very same thing to him two days ago.
loveseat at the corner of the room, his shoulder crashed against something firm, and he clicked his tongue at the person in front of him, looking up to reprimand them, only to find—
"Mhm. Now come on," Dean reached up to wipe the back of his palm over Castiel's face, much to Castiel's fond protest, "—give me a smile, baby, come on."
"If we can go long enough tonight, I'd love to come on your face, Cas, paint your pretty, boy-toy face white with my come. And then I'd lick it right off, kiss every single inch of your face—"
Castiel blushed at the memory of it, and shoved his face back into the pillow under him. He tried not to shift too much, or else he would end up waking Dean, who slept so calmly, it almost tugged at Castiel's heart. A moment after he'd cooled down from his tiny meltdown, Castiel rolled onto his side, and stared at Dean's face. It was smooth, devoid of any wrinkles or spots, save for his beautiful tan freckles, and a few scratches here and there. There was a bruise on his jaw, which Castiel realised belonged to his own hand when he punched Dean the day before.
An unrestrained pang of sheer, red rage coursed through Dean's body as he grit his teeth, and turned around, eyes wide and glaring as he pushed and shoved people aside in the foyer. Benny was to the side, eating something, but Dean couldn't care less, as he grabbed Benny by the arm, and dragged him outside the house, all-the-while Benny gaped at him and demanded an explanation.
Damn it, he thought, it's all his fault for roaming around in those obscene little things. Hmph, did you see the size of them? Castiel could have worn a loincloth for all it's worth and it would have been more modest.
, as he came with a whine of Dean's name. When Dean pulled out at last, come leaked down Castiel's ruined asshole, and he watched as the pucker— now swollen, gaped and fluttered, before guzzling out another load of come.
Castiel smiled, and Dean felt his heart skip a beat as he loosened the tie on his uniform, rolled up his sleeves, and rummaged through the shelves.
"500$. And I'll clear your raise." Mick snapped a five-hundred dollar bill down on the table between them.
Absently, he reached a hand out under the table, and slipped it into Castiel's. Castiel turned to him with a questioning look, but Dean simply smiled. Castiel squeezed his hand under the table and turned back to the conversation. This time, Dean decided to listen in as well.
Dean wrapped his hand around it, stroking it deliciously before pushing a thumb between Castiel's legs. Castiel faltered, his mouth dropping open in pure ecstasy as he fell back against the desk, and spread his legs open wide for Dean. Dean cursed, and felt an insatiable hunger take over him as he stared down at Castiel's gorgeous, perfect pink pucker. It quivered when Dean brushed his thumb over it— greedy for a cock to swallow— and Dean's breath hitched the moment his thumb slipped inside and Castiel let out the loudest moan Dean had ever heard.
"It was," Castiel tried to think of a word, but found nothing that could possibly be said, "—indescribable. I've had fingers, and erm, toys up there before, but never a, never a—"
Dean Winchester would glance at her. Dean dated only the prettiest, skinniest, and spiciest of girls. The ones that had no qualms against getting caught by a teacher with cock in her mouth in the janitor's closet, those were the girls he would toy around with. He lived close to Castiel's house, and Castiel had seen him driving down in his muscly, black Impala on some days, donning an oversized leather jacket that showed off the curves of his back and shoulder.
By Monday, things at Lawrence High had changed. No, the senior year batch at Lawrence High was on a way to revolution. Thanks to Anna, the list of supporters for Castiel's anti-bullying campaign had grown from five to almost thirty-five. And paired with the inflow of submissions on the Lawrence High anti-bullying blog, Castiel's campaign was soaring. In the corridors, people would smile at Castiel, thank him for starting the campaign, and they would chat with him for a while— even people he didn't know. And then there was Dean, who stood by Castiel as unwavering and solid as a boulder.
"I thought you just, just liked me—" Castiel mused, eyes floating across the room, before settling on Dean again.
"Castiel, take a breather, we'll go over the chapter at the end of the class. Rest if you have to, alright." Mr. Devereaux said, and turned back to the blackboard. A tap on his shoulder, and Castiel turned around to find Benny handing him a small chit. Castiel took it, and discreetly opened it up on his desk.
Somehow, they had traveled from the wall to one of the tables at the corner, and Dean laid Castiel down on the table with utmost care, warm hands gliding down Castiel's arms with such affection, it had Castiel's gut pooling with arousal. He spread his legs open to hook one foot around Dean's shoulder and the other around Dean's waist. Dean leaned in, kissing with the passion Castiel knew he always had in him— every suck, every nip filled with heat and pleasure, and Castiel hoped Dean would make him forget about the world, at least for a few hours.
Dean nodded, and rose up from the seat, as did the others. Castiel stayed by Dean's side every second, silently reassuring Dean with small squeezes to his hand and wide smiles. It was adorable. And then there was Michael, whom Dean had begun to like. The man wasn't as stern as Dean had thought him to be, and hey, he was good at conversations, and a fellow classic-car enthusiast. Nothing could top that. Even as they headed down to the dining room, Michael indulged Dean in a conversation about a story he heard from his father, as in Castiel's grandfather, about the Ford Mustang, and Dean listened with intent, asking questions and humming along routinely to keep Michael engaged.
"So," Castiel asked, grabbing his workbook as Dean pushed himself to his feet, and handed him his phone and earphones, "-what do you think?"
Their eyes met, and Castiel held Dean's gaze, mouth faltering open as he sucked in a breath. Inch by inch, Dean pushed his cock inside, watching how Castiel's hole dilated around it, before meeting Castiel's hazy eyes again. The boy threw his arms around Dean's shoulders and pulled him in, burying his face in the crook of Dean's neck as he trembled. Soft, pained whimpers pressed into Dean's skin, and he reached a hand up to rub it over the boy's back, pressing his lips to Castiel's cheek as he shushed him softly.
"Good improvement, you can do better though." Dean remarked, and Castiel hummed as he arched his back, and felt Dean's large, thick veined cock— pink and fleshy— searing hot, nudge against his hole. Castiel clenched his ass, already eager to have Dean fill him, but the man simply rubbed the tip of his cock against Castiel's hole, and gripped him by the hips.
"You're a strong boy, Cas. And you've got the brightest future ahead of you. So please, don't let it hinder your future in anyway. I know it can be,
Enter Dean Winchester. Captain of the school football team. Big, broad guy built with solid muscle and nothing else. Jock through and through. Every girl at school
Of late, Michael had become absolutely redundant to Castiel. Sure, they'd started dating because they were the only two openly gay boys in the entirety of Lawrence High, and at the beginning, it was cute. Sweet, even, since Michael was a nerdy, dorky guy with long hair, and a weird fashion taste, and hey, the two of them liked talking about classic Literature. But after a point, Castiel had gotten bored. Literally. It seemed as if they'd speak of nothing but small talk, and sex? Out of question. Every time Castiel had tried to do something remotely inappropriate, Michael had shunned him away. God, the guy wouldn't even understand when Castiel was coming onto him.
He wasn't blind. He had noticed the stream of blood pouring down Castiel's thighs when he had helped Castiel into the shower the night before. Of course, he had saved both of them a great deal of discomfort by not bringing it up, but the way his eyes had softened, Castiel just knew he wanted to say something. But he didn't, and part of Castiel was thankful for it.
to be fine, so stop acting like what happened on Friday has completely broken me, or shattered me in any way. Yes, it hurt. And it still does, but I don't want to sit around and mope about it. There's things that I don't feel comfortable enough telling you now, but when the time is right, I will. So stop forcing it out of me. I know you love me, and you have every reason to be worried about me, but please, you making me feel like I'm weak, and that I need to be tended to every hour isn't helping."
"I heard it. Well, parts of it. You were speaking too softly, but I could hear your voice. You stood up for him, I'm proud of you, son." Bobby sighed, and his eyes, wise and deep, peered into Dean's.
"To who." Dean growled, and Castiel caught a glimpse of raw, unhinged fury in Dean's eyes, something he'd only seen a few weeks ago, at Benny's farmhouse, when Dean had stormed into the room Alastair had Castiel locked inside.
Michael looked horrified. A living corpse, if you asked Castiel. Colourless, speechless, and scarred.
Crying, Castiel stumbled into the classroom, and tried to school his appearance in front of the others, when at once, a hand clutched at his shoulder. It was Benny, Castiel's classmate, and Castiel sent him a vague smile.
"I want to see you come on my cock, Cas. Could you hold on a little longer?" Dean asked, a soft, tender grin playing at his lips. And with Dean smiling down at Castiel, almost like an angel, how could Castiel even be angry at him. He nodded, and pulled Dean down into another kiss, this time shifting the spotlight onto Dean's cock as he rose up to his knees, and pushed Dean back on the bed in his place.
"I won't say what you did was right— beating them up, breaking their bones, going crazy— but I won't say you were wrong either. Some times, not everyone can be brought to justice with peace. Sometimes you need a little kick, a little punch to remind them that you've still got a fight in you. I'm proud of ya'."
"You know," Castiel started, and a smile grew at his face at the recollection of the memory, "-remember when I told you that sometimes it feels good when people
The summer before school, while surfing around on the internet, Castiel had stumbled on to a picture of a girl, dressed in a skimpy corset, black stockings and bunny ears. He hadn't thought much of it, but the website he had been led to after clicking on the picture had been OnlyPics. OnlyPics was a strange place. People seemed to flood it with comments and posts, and without revealing any information about yourself except for a username, you could post pictures of yourself. Premium users could even earn money from the pictures the posted. And when Castiel had ended up falling down a rabbit-hole of OnlyPics, he'd found
"You didn't have to, Cas. I knew already. I felt it in your punch yesterday, just how much you loved me."
Castiel sighed, and though Dean tried to move, Castiel squeezed him in his arms, and rolled them over until Dean was lying on his back with Castiel straddling him.
A hand cupped over Castiel's crotch, and he let out a soft moan, eyebrows furrowing as he held onto the man's shoulder. The man chuckled darkly in his ear, before muttering a deep, rumbling, "
"It doesn't matter how good you are to me, Novak, don't fuckin' suck up to me at school. I'll beat the shit out of you."
, he mouthed, and turned back to look at the screen. He adjusted his headset and console, and sucked in a deep breath.
It seemed unreal, and Castiel fought with himself to give into the dream, or to get a grip on himself.
Everything seemed to come to a static halt as Castiel sucked in a deep breath. He felt the colour in his face seep away, and he swallowed nervously for a moment, simply staring at Meg, who stared back with an equally nervous expression. Silence ensued between them for a few long seconds, where Castiel's heart pounded in his chest. Meg sighed, and looked away, playing with a loose thread on the inside of her jacket's lining.
"What'd she say?" Dean asked, as he pressed a kiss to Castiel's head, and ran a hand through his hair.
"And you think I can? C'mon, let's get you some ointment, and hey, have you had anything after lunch? It's been a few hours already, I'll cook you something."
"I have a bedroom, by the way," The boy chimed after a few minutes of silence, "-I want to ride your cock. And I want you to keep coming inside me, keep filling me up with your come until I can see it through my stomach."
Castiel felt his bottom lip tremble, and yet, he bit the inside of his cheek to refrain the tears welling up at the pools of his eyes. He forced out a smile, and nodded. "Thank you, Mr. Singer. I appreciate it. And uhm, Meg and I— Meg and I wanted to talk to you about something along the same lines."
A brush on his arm drew him out of his paranoia, and he stepped back, watching as Benny reached for the knob, and with a deep, laboured breath, burst the door open. Dean pushed him aside, and barged in, pausing in his tracks with a gasp as his eyes met—
"You're gonna' pay for this, Winchester—" Alastair gasped out, and Dean laughed a proud, hysterical laugh as he stomped a foot onto Alastair's ribcage, and leaned down to meet Alastair's helpless, wide eyes.
"You know, there's a reason I love torturing you, Novak. The look on your face? When you're being absolutely humiliated, absolutely suffering— it makes me feel so happy," He gave a content sigh, and Castiel remained silent, simply listening, "-here's what I want you to do."
The air was heavy with sheer anticipation and desperation, and for a moment, the two of them studied each other, eyes roaming across each other's face, before Dean licked his lips and dove down to press a kiss to Castiel's lips. For a moment, Castiel was stunned at having to taste himself on Dean's lips, but the more Dean kept going at it, sucking and nipping and biting— Castiel could hardly care.
"Jesus Christ—" Dean grumbled, as Castiel rolled his hips over the bulge in Dean's trousers. Dean groaned, and felt Castiel's mouth devour every inch of his neck as he rocked in Dean's lap. Dean snaked a hand under Castiel's undone uniform, and felt Castiel shiver at the touch. "God, I can't believe we have to wait till Sunday—"
"Yeah, I'm not." Dean breathed out, a small smile at his lips as he pulled Castiel into a hug. Castiel let himself press into Dean's chest, inhaling a lungful of the comforting scent of the fabric softener clinging to Dean's shirt, and felt his hands run down Castiel's body. "I never expected you to come all the way over here to talk to me."
Meg paused for a moment, and Castiel glanced at Dean to gauge his reaction, only to find his frigid, dim eyes glued onto Meg.
the panicked pounding of Castiel's heart, as he plucked him off the step-ladder, and set him down on the floor. Castiel's arms remained hooked around Dean's neck, and Dean couldn't find it in himself to pull his arms away from Castiel's waist as they stood there, simply drinking in the moment.
"God, Cas, you're so tight—" Dean whispered, and Castiel clenched his hole around Dean's cock. Not a second after, Dean let out what had to be one of his loudest groans, and Castiel felt his pace stagger. Dean opened his eyes and caught Castiel staring, only to dive down into a kiss.
"Knowing you has changed me. For your sake, and maybe for mine too, I've been kinder these days. I've been trying my best to be someone you can be proud of. I've tried my best to deny my urges to fight, to rip, to tear something,
"Drive safe, Ben," Dean croaked out, before watching as both Benny and Castiel disappeared down the stairs. Dean would much rather have driven Castiel home himself, oh, he would have given
"Nope. I'm not going to my room, and I sure as fuck am not listening to a woman who shows up in my life every once in a year and expects me to love her, despite her constant taunting and neglect. So, please,
"Hey, Novak," Dean called, and Castiel could practically see the wicked grin that must be curled on his lips, "-your panties blew up on OnlyPics. I mean, fifty thousand hearts? Can I expect to see you on PornHub now?"
Castiel tried to protest, because hey, he clearly remembered copying the formula word to word into Dean's notebook, and he was sure the answer was right. He had stayed up late at night, way past his bedtime to write Dean's homework. How could Dean say otherwise? No, no, this had to be a mistake.
going to do it. After craving it for months, Castiel would finally have Dean inside of him. Every fantasy, every night Castiel had spent wondering how Dean would be, and nothing had come close to even grazing the tip of what Dean turned out to be. Dean was a passionate lover, a ferocious, rough lover. But then again, he was gentle, he was a soft, patient lover. And maybe that was why Dean was who he was.
"You're not in the mood? How about I get you? Will you like that, bitch?" A hand grabbed Castiel by the back of his neck, and he gasped. Behind his back, he tapped on the contact he hoped belonged to his driver— at least a missed call would work in favour of him.
A beat passed between them, and Castiel pushed himself up to his feet. Before he could take a step forward though, Dean shot an arm out to grab his wrist, and Castiel stopped dead in his tracks. Dean snapped his eyes up to meet Castiel's, and urged him down.
"C'mon, dude, are you going to keep denying it just because you don't want to be labelled gay? Or bi? I don't know what you are, but if I was in your place, and I was so in deep for a boy, I wouldn't give two shits what people thought of me if I got to be with him."
"I swear, I swear on you," Dean pressed a hand over Castiel's chest, "—I wasn't, I just wanted her to leave sooner—"
A pair of rushed footsteps echoed through the passageway, and Castiel paused his pacing to turn to the source of the sound. Rushing from down the corridors, was Dean, with Benny at his back. Dean's stern face brightened, and he reached out to pull Castiel into a tight hug.
"I know," Castiel said, as if surprised at himself, "—but it's not half as bad as people say it is."
Quietly, Dean waited for the boy to stand still against the counter, and snuck into the room. The boy made no effort to move, until at last, Dean creeped up right behind him, simply watching as the boy spread some peanut butter on a piece of toast, and brought the butter knife up to his mouth to lick it clean. Dean watched, entranced, as his pink tongue rolled around the knife, and swirled every last drop of it into his mouth, before he set it back on the table, and turned around.
Silence crawled over them, and both of them simply listened to Benny and Meg talk about something with a few, quiet chuckles. It was sweet, but then Dean squeezed Castiel's shoulder, and Castiel turned to him. "Hm?"
It was a simple Friday evening, and Castiel had no plans, no friends, no parties to attend. He lounged back in his bed, scrolling through his OnlyPics, replying and liking the comments on the video he'd posted the week before. Of course, looking at the video reminded Castiel of only his deal with Dean, and he tried to avoid thinking of it, but the love pouring in from the people on the app made him smile, and believe that in some way, he was important to someone.
"What can I say? I'm famous," Castiel smiled, and part of Dean wanted to punch the smile right off his delicate fucking face, but he kept his urges in control, instead, sitting up on Castiel's bed and taking his jacket off to toss it on the floor.
"I don't usually open up to people, I'm sorry, I don't know what came over me," Dean sighed, and shook his head, as if trying to reboot his system, and Castiel smiled, letting his hand slide down to Dean's jaw.
These days, Dean had changed somehow. He was relaxed, not as tense or defensive as he used to be around Castiel, and he had a knack for pulling Castiel's leg in class, which seemed to have considerably decreased in the past few days. Dean was studying diligently, and he was making notes, answering questions, raising doubts. Watching Dean change was as beautiful as watching a butterfly break through its cocoon. What's more was that Dean had given up on smoking. Although Castiel had advised him on several occasions to go slowly, Dean had insisted on going cold turkey, and be what it may, Castiel was proud of him.
Hooking his fingers through his sweatpants, Castiel bent over and slowly, slid the pants down his slender, hairless legs, courtesy of his genes, and let Dean watch him. In the distance, Castiel could hear Dean suck in a shallow breath, and let it out weakly. Castiel stretched the elastic band of his panties, before letting it slap against his navel, and slipping down onto the chair with both feet spread apart. If Dean wanted to watch, he could gladly, and for the sole purpose of annoying Dean, Castiel rolled his hips back in the chair, and let his ass bounce as he pretended to adjust himself in his seat.
"I never should have left him, Bobby," Dean whispered, unable to hold back a sob that wracked his body, "—if I would've just stayed there a few minutes—"
"Saved by Devereaux," He sighed, and his sidekicks, Nick and Gordon, brushed past Castiel roughly, bumping against his shoulders, before at last, Alastair walked past him. For a moment, he paused beside Castiel, and leaned into his ear. Castiel froze, his body tensing up in anticipation of something rough—
Castiel's eyes met his, and Dean tried to let the words in his mind come out of his throat, but they simply wouldn't, and all he could do was marvel at Castiel.
"Your classes start now, so you should head back. I want the both of you, along with whoever you have on your team, in my office, the moment school ends today. Clear?"
But the words never escaped his throat. Castiel wanted him to say it, Dean could see it in his pearly blue eyes. The words never came, and instead, Dean moved away. Benny helped Castiel up, draping a jacket over his shoulder, and they passed each other a distant, expectant look, before Dean turned away to watch Benny help Castiel out the room, an arm on his shoulder and one around his back.
Andrea joined them, Benny's girlfriend and Dean's classmate, and she rambled on about something, but neither Benny nor Dean seemed to care as they trudged down the corridor.
Castiel blinked his teary eyes up at Dean for a moment. They were puffy, swollen, and red at the rims, and yet, it was the way they stared into Dean's soul that still managed to baffle Dean.
"Yeah? You moonlighting as a stripper or sumthin'?" Victor called out, which earned a loud, cheery laugh from the table, including Dean.
"Yeah? Awh, I'm sorry, I'll knock next time, okay?" Dean snorted. The boy kicked him in the ankle, and damn it, he was feisty, wasn't he? But that's alright, Dean liked them
"Dude, really? Me too, I mean, I'm a Zeppelin fan, have been for years now. And yeah, Aerosmith, ACDC, that's all good stuff."
"Yeah, I'm awesome," Dean chuckled, and let some smoke slip past his lips. Castiel scrunched his nose in disgust, and turned his head away with a frown.
Meg flustered for a moment, and tried to cover up her embarrassment with a cough as she stepped aside from the front door to Castiel's house. Castiel lingered there for a moment, neither of them acknowledging the silence between them, before Castiel spoke up.
"So I'll see you Thursday, and oh, I've got your number, I'll text you, okay? And let me know if you need anything. Maybe there's something you can't ask Dean, I could help you with it." She smiled, and Castiel walked her to the door.
over and over again as he felt his orgasm rip through his cock and splatter across both of their stomachs. But Dean didn't stop, he simply kept at it with a fast pace, until at last, he dropped his head against Castiel's and let out a groan.
Castiel snorted, and flipped the menu around, before deciding on a cheeseburger with a side of fries. Something on the side of the table flickered, and his eyes snapped over to where Dean's phone was sitting. On the lock screen, however, was a picture of him, in the Impala, laughing and eating a hamburger. His eyes widened as he reached for Dean's phone for a better look.
At once, Dean's finger sunk into a hot, slick wetness, and he felt Castiel roll a tongue around his finger. With a silent gasp, he pulled his hand away, and slid his finger down into the boy's t-shirt, grazing over one of his nipples, and Jesus Christ, the whine the boy let out— downright filthy, and Dean was now chubby and bulging in his underwear at the mere thought of playing with the boy's nipples until they were swollen blue.
"My, look what we found," Alastair laughed, baring his ugly, yellow teeth out, and Dean clenched his fist, already feeling exasperated at the sight of him, "—Winchester and the fag, with their clothes all rumpled. Is the nerd a good fuck, Winchester? Bet he is. Bet he's a screamer too. It's always the quiet ones."
Castiel chuckled, and stole a soft, lingering kiss from Dean's lips, nudging him back until his back hit the counter, as they made out lazily, hands flying, scrambling for purchase, as Dean swallowed every last inch of Castiel's mouth, hands traveling hesitantly under Castiel's shirt, until they pulled away to catch their breath.
Dean simply let out a groan, and grabbed Castiel's wrist, pulling it up over his head, listening with a satisfied smirk as Castiel whined, and shoved Dean's shoulder.
"So you won't mind us playing with him then?" Alastair asked, and Castiel caught his sharp, predatory glare, which had a shiver running down Castiel's spine.
"And I wasn't the only one." Meg added, with a glance at Castiel. Anna picked up on it, and Dean watched, a bit awestruck at how they managed to avoid the word as if simply saying it would prick them.
It was futile now, living in the past. Castiel would never tell Dean what they'd done to him— especially after last night, after Dean had confessed, no, declared his love to Castiel with such exasperation and intensity, finding out the person he loved had been raped in such a vulgar way, it would shatter Dean. Castiel would never tell him. And eventually, he was sure the horror of it would wear off and they could go back to the way things were. Castiel didn't have to make a big deal of it. If it had been his mother, that's what she would have said.
"Here," Castiel said, and rubbed some ointment over his cheekbone. The gel was cold but soothing, and Dean furrowed his eyebrows at the sting of the bruise. Something lay over his skin, and he opened his eyes to find Castiel focused on to his cheek, pressing a bandaid onto the bruise, "-I don't know if this will help at all, but something's better than nothing."
Meg sighed, and her eyes glanced between Dean and Castiel, "—I promised my dad I'd come. But I'll text you, 'kay?"
to be by Castiel's side right then, but time was of essence, and he for once, had the opportunity to pay Alastair back for the years he'd spent kissing his foot, for all the times Alastair had threatened Castiel, for the taunts, the teasing, and for— for hurting Castiel. Even then, the sight of Castiel on his knees, clothes torn and disheveled, and his eyes begging for an end to his misery—
"I know it's too early to think about but—" Castiel paused, and let his eyes scan the rest of his room in bids to not meet Dean's eye, "—do you have anything in mind for the future? I mean, senior year is ending in a while, we have colleges to apply to. Things are gonna' get crazy for a while. Would you still be with me?"
He paused outside the library to catch his breath, and mumbled to himself, "-I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. I'm gonna' be a fucking man, go in there, and tell Castiel I like him, and that I wanna' be with him. I'm going to tell him I love him, and that I've never loved anyone else so much before," Dean panted, and sucked in a deep, refreshing breath, "-Cas, I love you, please go out with me. No, no, Cas I'm in love with you, I want to be with you. Too proposal-y. Oh, oh, Cas, I think I'm in love with you, please be my boyfriend. My boyfriend. Oh my god—"
He was vicious in the way he kissed, but gentle in the way he held Castiel by the jaw. He was rough in the way he nibbled a mark into Castiel's neck, but sweet when he licked at the bite to soothe the pain. His eyes were rigid in the way they stared down at Castiel, full of conviction, but a trace of affection lingered through them, and Castiel couldn't help but be drawn in deeper into the enigma that was Dean Winchester. Even then, in that moment, when Dean was pouring lube down Castiel's taint, massaging every inch of his hole, making sure it was easy enough to slide into, his fingers were deft and soothing.
"He isn't at the front," Dean answered, and at once, both boys turned to the flight of stairs behind them.
"But," Castiel sat up, and turned to Dean, "-every song on Zeppelin IV is a masterpiece. Rock and Roll? Black Dog? Stairway to Heaven? Misty Mountain Hop? When the Levee Breaks? Gem after gem— they're Zeppelin's most critically iconic songs?!"
Poor Dean. He thought he'd figured out Castiel. Oh please. It was far from the truth. But for now, Castiel wondered, he was happy to play along with Dean's misunderstanding.
"Just say the word and I'll make sure they can't speak again." Dean whispered, reaching for Castiel's hand, and Castiel smiled.
's, the four of them scuttered out the room, and into the passage. Dean slung an arm around Castiel's shoulder, and pulled him into his side. "Nice work, yeah?" Dean asked with a grin, and Castiel turned to smile at him.
Silence spread across the room, and both of them simply lay with their eyes shut. But moments later, Castiel felt Dean's arm snake under his waist and curl around his side, and then Dean was pressing into his shoulder, wrapping around him like an octopus. Castiel chuckled, and ran a hand down Dean's back. "God, I'm tired."
"Thank you." It was an odd thing to say, but hey, the entirety of this was an odd thing to do, but in that moment, with Dean grinning down at him so lewdly, it felt like the right thing to do.
, he really shouldn't have, because Dean was two seconds away from losing his conscience, and Castiel absently biting down into his plump, wet bottom lip was
"Hello Sam," He smiled, and brushed his fingers through Sam's hair before joining Dean at the kitchen counter. Dean was cutting up some vegetables, and Castiel slipped his arms around Dean's stomach. "What are you doing?"
"My father owns an auto-repair garage next to our house, so I usually spend my time working at the garage. I fix old cars, get them running, I paint them, clean them, clean the parts, get them all restored. Especially classic ones. It's tough work, lots of grease, lots of heat, lots of sweat. But I love it. I mean, I could spend a lifetime working on cars, and I wouldn't regret it." Dean sighed, and watched as Castiel walked over to them, a smile at his face.
"Stop pretending to be my friend. I know you don't want to, and I don't mind, I really don't mind, go back to the people you used to be with, Lisa, Alastair, I don't care—"
Castiel growled. A vicious pang of hunger and desire coursed through him. He grabbed Dean by the back of his thighs, and pulled him down until Dean was crashing into Castiel's chest, his cock nudging at Castiel's hole. Their eyes met, Dean slightly surprised, and Castiel frustrated. "You talk too much, Winchester, don't tell me what you want to do,
wrapped around a cock; a structured face, stunning vibrant baby-blue eyes— frigid and indifferent, and an athletic, well-kept body Dean would love to bruise and tease.
Like Meg, Castiel felt himself fall victim to his anxiousness. He fidgeted with the hem of his shirt, and pressed his legs together. He didn't mean to, but his shoulders tensed up, and he realized he was being too silent. Meg wasn't saying much at all— her eyes were glued to the ground and Castiel knew just why. Opening up to a stranger, an adult at that, was
…" Castiel whispered, and pressed a finger to Dean's lips. Dean dropped his eyes down to gaze at the finger for a moment, before licking it. Castiel, who was leaning down to Dean's cock snapped his wide eyes up at Dean, and watched awestruck as Dean sucked the finger into his mouth, before rolling it out. "What, think you're the only tease here?" Dean grinned, devilish bastard that he was, and Castiel grunted, before going down on Dean's cock, swallowing him in right to the hilt. Dean's balls slapped against Castiel's chin, and Castiel kept himself buried in the trimmed bush of dark blonde hair above Dean's cock, as he felt tears threaten his eyes.
"Thank you for speaking up in the morning, it really made me feel much better about my speech. I thought I would've been preaching to the deaf but I'm glad at least one person made an effort." Castiel chuckled, and Dean watched him fondly, in awe of how fucking adorable Castiel was when he nibbled at the cap of his pen between his teeth.
"Now we're getting somewhere. Beg for it harder," Dean grit out, and tugged a fistful of Castiel's hair, before slipping his fingers out, and slapping Castiel's ass with a loud, clamouring
A wave of warmth had coursed through Castiel at the sight of his parents talking to him, talking about him, asking up on him— and he had let himself go. Castiel had spent another hour speaking about Dean, about how he had a difficult childhood, and yet, how he managed to be so kind, so loving, so gentle. And Castiel had talked about how Dean was his first friend, his very first best friend, how he and Dean had no secrets, how Dean was a smart, bright boy. Castiel had even mentioned how Dean loved classic rock, and his father had perked up, hitting Castiel with
"Saw your post crossed twenty-five thousand hearts on OnlyPics. Lotta' people wanna' fuck you. You must be in heaven, yeah?" Dean smirked, watching as Castiel flipped a notebook open, and skimmed through it.
Castiel fidgeted with the hem of his sleeve, nervous, but annoyed. He wasn't in any mind to deal with Alastair at all. What with Dean, what with their fight, Castiel was
Dean swallowed down his guilt, and Castiel watched with pride in his eyes, as his face flustered, and he turned away, averting his gaze towards the other side of the room, as he spoke about Billy Pilgrim, and the credibility of his memories. Castiel smiled, and slouched back against the seat, tapping his pen against the desk with a soft, thrumming noise audible to barely anyone but him. He waited until Dean had turned back to him, to let the pen drop the the floor.
"It's valid. Being exposed on the internet, thinking of what your friends would think, what your parents would think, what your school would think— the fear drives you crazy, doesn't it? And you can't help but comply to whatever you're asked to do, because in that moment there's nothing more dangerous than having your dignity crumbling to the ground. It's valid, and I—" Castiel breathed out, pinching the bridge of his nose, "—I get it."
Although Castiel didn't know why Dean's silence irked him so much, he wanted to find out if Dean was alright. On Monday, sitting with Dean with a single pair of earphones plugged into their ears, it had shown Castiel a side of Dean he had never seen before. A side of Dean he
Dean tossed the keys back to Benny, who caught them in his hand, and walked over to where Dean was crouched before Castiel. Behind them, Alastair and his sidekicks lingered at the corner, speaking to each other, before slipping out of the room. Castiel's eyes followed them, but eventually ended up back on Dean.
A cold laugh slipped past Dean's lips as he trudged towards Benny. Something had changed in the air between them, Dean could feel it. Dean's legs were heavy, and he picked up feet after feet as he cornered Benny against a wall, watching as the colour seeped out of his eyes, now replaced with a grey overcast of fear.
"Novk, we're leaving today. And we're not coming back. I wish I could undo all of that pain, all of that hurt— I wish I could take it back," Gordon gulped, his face stained with tears, "—I really wish I could. But I'm sorry that I can't. All I can do is leave you be, and go my own way. Try to do good in the world. And you helped me open my eyes to that, and I'm forever grateful to you for changing me. I just wish it didn't have to be at the cost of yourself. I'm sorry, Novak. We'll be leaving now. Nick," Gordon said, and Castiel watched from the corner of his eye, as Nick and Gordon trudged away. The door to the library opened and shut, and Castiel let out a deep sigh.
John grumbled to himself before grabbing the news paper, and flipping it open, "-you added too much salt last time. Don't do that again. I thought a boy your age woulda' had some common sense, but no."
Castiel's eyes rolled to the back of his head as he dropped his mouth open, and reached down to clasp a hand at Dean's shoulder. "O-oh—"
"God, I love you—" Dean groaned, and pulled his thumb out, only to wrap his hand around the side of his fat, throbbing cock, and guide it to Castiel's fluttering, pink hole. He spat down on Castiel's taint, and watched it drip down to his tight pucker, before spreading it around with the tip of his cock— causing obscene, disgustingly perverted squelches to echo through the air. Castiel rocked back on Dean's cock, needy cockslut that he was, and Dean pressed the fleshy, fat tip of his cock inside, and let his hand fall away.
"That won't be necessary. Understanding your deal with its obvious loopholes is already a tedious task in itself, I don't know how you expect me to do so intoxicated."
and Dean could do nothing but watch as Castiel broke down, spit drooling down his chin, tears streaming down his face, and his voice growing hoarse each minute.
"Yeah, I figured. Anyway, we've got beer, vodka, diluted beer which is basically beer with water, it tastes like crap but y'know. We also have fruit punch, in case you don't want to get smashed," Benny rattled off, and led Castiel towards what seemed to be a counter, more like an indoor-bar. On the counter were large bottles and jugs, and Castiel reached out to grab a plastic cup for himself.
"I don't, I don't want to talk about that," Castiel stuttered, his voice wet and low, and Dean noticed how he turned away, not meeting Dean's eye. Dean wanted to know more, though, even if it was selfish of him to. He wanted to know if Castiel was fine. He had the goddamn right to, because he loved Castiel, would always love him, he would do or give anything just to see Castiel smile the way he always did— light, carefree, toothy; something so unrestrained about his happiness, something so contagious it helped brighten Dean's mood as well, Dean wished it would return. He wished Castiel felt happier. And he deserved to. Castiel deserved every, single joy in the world, and Dean would die trying to find it for him.
