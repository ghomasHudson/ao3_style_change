How could something so small cause him to feel like
“We better rest up then.”
It takes a few minutes for Dean to come back to himself.
Cas's voice was deep and measured.
“You calling me a slut, angel?” Dean forced out a breathy laugh.
Cas squinted at him momentarily before circling around the bed.
Dean groaned and squirmed in his grasp even as he felt his peak ebb slightly.
Dean couldn't help the soft, pathetic noises falling from his mouth. The feather-light touches on his oversensitive clit were driving him insane and he could feel the heat coiling low in his belly again already.
Dean's hips twitched up as Cas rubbed just a bit harder.
Cas chuckled and sped up his ministrations.
He speeds up as Dean careens over the edge for one last time – unable to do more than gasp for breath as Cas works him through it. Dean's vision whites out with something that sounds like Cas's name on his lips.
stop -”
“I was just thinking. You're probably feeling like all of your pelvic muscles are under pressure – aren't you, Dean? So close to something and yet no way to push yourself over the edge? Nothing to light that last fuse? Why, that almost sounds like torture, doesn't it?”
Dean swallows.
“Do you think you deserve that? That you've learned your lesson?”
Cas nodded a little too quickly, his voice rough. “Yes, that sounds...more than alright, Dean.”
Unfortunately, he had other plans and pulled back.
“I will not allow any harm to come to you, Dean.”
It should be teasing but Cas is so goddamn earnest Dean feels himself well up a little.
"At least with Sam being off with Eileen for a few days more we never, ever have to tell him about this."
And boy did Cas find it.
“At least not much.” Cas grinned as he soothed the bite with his tongue – his fingers stilled as Dean adjusted.
Without breaking eye contact he licked a firm, flat stripe up the center of him and up over his clit.
Cas pulled back to look him in the eyes as he slid his hand under the band - stopping just short of where Dean wanted him.
"Yeah, yeah..." Dean stilled for a moment to let Cas work his own mojo and clean him up.
“I did know tha-
"Please sit against the headboard. Shirt off. Arms out. Legs apart."
Cas licked his lips as he spoke, low and gravelly, just how he knew Dean liked it.
“You're going to kill me like this.” Dean tried to move again with limited success.
"You seem otherwise unharmed. Is there anything besides your genitals that -"
– Cas please stop- don't stop it's too - I –
Cas considers for a moment.
By the time four minutes had passed Dean was covered in sweat and shaking from head to toe. Cas knew he couldn't take much more and decides it's time to let his human rest.
“Perhaps you have.” Cas said with amusement, “You've been such a good boy. That deserves a reward.”
"Yes- fuck yes, Cas." Dean's voice was surprisingly thin to his ears. His clit felt so hard it hurt.
"Dean, you know I do not intentionally read your thoughts but you are thinking very, very loud."
And if
“Would you like that?”
Cas didn't seem worried and that put Dean at ease. It was only temporary and it wasn't like he was incapacitated. Hell, wasn't the weirdest thing that's ever happened to him, and maybe another time he'd be freaking out more, but the whole scenario just made it...kinda hot.
"Do you trust me, Dean?" Cas is softer now. A genuine question, not a role being played.
"Yes- yeah. Yeah, Cas, of course I do."
? His eyes were clamped shut as Cas continued leisurely alternating between sucking and licking.
"Cas!" Dean arches off the bed so sharply Cas has to hold his hips in place.
"Please Cas. Please don't stop I can't -" His voice sounded pathetic even to his own ears.
“I told you, Dean, you need to learn patience.”
"Sexy day-pass." Dean chuckled to himself.
“AH- fuck! Fuck that's – yeah, Cas. Right there. Right there you got it-”
didn't send a spasm straight through him, the next thing certainly did.
The bed is a disaster area but he can't bring himself to care. He's kinda impressed, honestly.
"Why does this shit always happen to me?" Dean grumbled as he threw his bag on his bedroom chair, "Every time we run into some magic something or other how am I the one that ends up in the hocus-pocus crossfire?"
“Hey!” Dean yelped.
Dean nodded vigorously.
– Cas it's not –
“Hey Cas? How long do you think we have left before this spell breaks?”
Dean just grunted as he stripped down to his t-shirt and now ill-fitting boxers.
Dean's senses were in overdrive. Everything was so sensitive it felt like the air in the room was trying to paw at him. And Cas just kept rubbing in the most tortuously deliberate way.
“Look at you." Cas practically growled, "I've barely touched you and already you're quivering. Perhaps I need to teach you patience.”
Dean kissed the top of the angel's head and settled down into the pillows behind them.
Without any more warning, Cas used his free hand to spread Dean open and swirled the point of his tongue around his painfully erect clit.
Dean mused to himself.
Dean moaned in frustration. Cas was right, of course. He knew exactly what he was doing.
Dean couldn't help but shout.
Dean gasps.
“It was amazing, Cas. Holy shit I've haven't come that many times in...ever.
"Well, I mean, maybe? It's only right to take the new equipment for a test-drive, right? Make sure everything's working?" A strained smile pulling at his features.
“Cas-
Dean was babbling but Cas got the message.
Cas's pupils were blown wider than he'd seen them in a long time. Hell, his own probably looked the same. The top buttons of his shirt were undone and his clothes were a mess.
Cas lent down and pressed a finger lightly to Dean's newly-minted entrance. Circling lightly before dipping in. With almost no resistance, he pushed in further while Dean made small noises above him.
The sound sent a twinge right down to his...
"Thank you." Cas softened, "As I've explained the spell will wear off in a few hours. As for 'why you' I think it probably had something to do with you insulting his mother."
“Incredible, isn't it?” Cas mused, “The great Dean Winchester, reduced to moaning like an animal in heat by just 2 fingers.” Cas pressed in hard for emphasis before resuming his languid pace, drawing a whine from Dean.
“I love bringing you pleasure, Dean, whatever form it's in. Whatever form
Dean cleared his throat and shifted a bit. "No - uh. No. I think everything else is fine. Walking feels kinda weird. Whole thing is a bit of a mindfuck...but I'm good."
His orgasm hit him like a tidal wave. His whole body seized as taught as a piano wire. Fluid dripping as he spasmed around Cas's fingers and against his tongue.
- that. Thank you Cas can you please get to the point.” Dean grit out through his teeth.
“I'm going to speed up. And you are going to come for me as many times as you can just from this. Is that clear?”
“You deserve all of it.” Cas responds, laying his head on Dean's shoulder.
The praise sends a shiver through him.
Feeling Dean relax, Cas began slowly moving his fingers in and out, crooking them inside, searching for that spot Dean knew was there.
“Just call me Niagara Falls, baby.” He chuckled as Cas waved the mess away with his hand.
"Impala."
Cas pays him no mind, switching sides and repeating the motions before trailing kisses up Dean's chest until his mouth is right against the shell of his ear.
An amused look passes over Cas's features as he continues in slow circles over the bundle of nerves - Dean's own slickness easing his way.
Cas fastens the restraints - leather and sheepskin lined cuffs that were laying around the bunker for who-knows-how-long - keeping Dean's arms outstretched comfortably on either side.
His legs were shaking now. He'd never needed to come again so quickly in his life.
Dean couldn't think straight. His head was swimming. Is this what it's like for other people all the time? Fuck, he's been missing out.
"Dean will you at least let me-" Cas was reaching for Dean's bloodied forehead, annoyance creasing his brow.
Dean made a noise he hoped was affirmative.
“Awesome. Because I feel like if you touch me again right now I might actually die, but let's say we take a quick little siesta and then,” Dean brought his hand down to cup Cas's dick, hard in his pants for who knows how long at this point, “I wanna ride you. Wanna see how good it feels with you in me like this.”
Cas smiles and cups Dean's jaw in his hand. His eyes darker than before.
Dean scowled down at him but there was no venom behind it.
Dean fell apart. It was under a minute before he was coming again. And again.
"Am I correct, Dean?" Cas held his gaze. If Dean weren't otherwise occupied he might have noticed how hard the angel was working to keep his composure.
Cas brought his fingers to Dean's open mouth and he took them hungrily.
"You don't know how intoxicating you are, Dean." There was a reverence in his voice that made Dean flush impossibly more than he already was.
Dean howled.
“Did you know many people can't orgasm from vaginal stimulation alone?”
Dean could taste himself mingling with the clean taste of Cas's skin and he couldn't help but moan.
His chin was shiny and wet with, well, with
“How was that for you, Dean?” Cas's voice is soft and fond. Dean's arms have been uncuffed and Cas is running a hand through his hair.
Cas lavished his tongue over the bud a few times before sucking it gently into his mouth and smiling up at his captive.
Cas was watching him. Something in his face Dean couldn't quite read.
“Cas -” Dean was gulping down air like a fish out of water but he didn't care. Not when Cas just kept rubbing. “Cas, please. Please make me come. Please let me come I'll do whatever you want.”
“Cas…” he starts to question, but Jack clears his throat across the table and catches their attention.
“… he didn’t know that he can,” Dean gasps and oh god, oh
He meets Sam’s eyes, Sam who looks like he’s vibrating with barely contained excitement behind that concern itched out over his face. “Yeah?” he says, uncertain as he fidgets with the ends of his sleeves.
, a sharp agonising pain ripping down behind the backs of his eyes and he presses the palms of his hands tightly against them as he lets out a groan.
Maybe he should look into a harness instead? They’re just below the collars and seem like they’re a lot more stable than just a normal collar, and Dean drops his attention to them only to freeze.
“Maybe we could make a deal.”
It really is shocking, Dean realises as he looks around. The table he’s at is covered in books yet to read, the one beside him covered in books he
Cas is gone. For good.
Because Cas is back and Dean had let the world disappear behind him in his grief, something he realises when Cas turns to him with a bright smile and asks whats next?
Everything hurts, everything burns, and in the quietness of the bunker kitchen, Dean Winchester lets himself fall apart.
His breath hitches in his throat as Cas meets him halfway, as their lips press gently together. It’s chaste, soft and warm, and Dean’s hand slides up into Cas’s hair as he pulls him as close as he can. Cas comes willingly, one arm slipping behind Dean’s back to bring him further up the bed, and Dean doesn’t hesitate as he once more settles into the crook of Cas’s thighs, kneeling until he’s higher and can tilt Cas’s head back.
,” he hisses under his breath, feeling himself start to tremble over a sandwich, a stupid fucking
Sam frowns. “But that was over two years ago,” he mutters, “why would the Empty take him now? How was it summoned?”
“Oh fuck,” Dean mutters, “that’s me.”
Dean shoves the harness back onto the rack, his lips tightly pursed together as he feels his eyes start to sting. No, not here, not now, and he just grabs a plain black quick-release collar off the rack above and tosses it into the trolley with a matching bland lead before pushing out of the aisle.
“Here’s the deal,” the Shadow continues. “You can take Castiel with you, but only if you make it to that rift without
Dean to the last, and Dean has to wrap his arms around his stomach as he rocks forward on the log and ignores the burning of his eyes.
He looks like he’s ready to throw up as he drops his eyes from Dean. “It was your seventeenth,” Sam mutters darkly, “and Dad wanted to spend time with just me. He thought it would be a good test.”
. He’d thought there’d be something else, noises like there had been in Hell. Screaming or pleading maybe. It sends a chill up his spine, the reminder of anything to do with that place a quick way to make him feel nauseous. Jack had mentioned that he’d woken the place up when Billie had sent him here, but there’s
Dean stands up, cutting off Sam’s sentence with his sudden movement, and he’s breathing heavily as he forces his fists to stay at his sides no matter how much he wants to start swinging. “Why the
Sam is being. “What do you mean?” he says, elbowing Sam as he does so. “Of course he’s gonna back to the bunker.” He grins at Jack. “He’s the man with the plan. He’s top dog. He can do whatever he wants! Come on!” Dean turns around and starts to head back to the impala, waving a hand at the other two to follow. “You know what? We’ll spruce the place up. We’ll get some recliners. We’ll get you one of those big-screen TVs-”
Dean shakes his head. “Bitch.”
“It’s all that matters,” he practically spits, ignoring Sam’s flinch in response. “So
He shoos Sam away as he gets out of bed. He contemplates getting changed for a moment but instead settles on pulling on some overly fuzzy socks that Sam throws his way and tucks himself into his woolen robe that Jack seems to have brought back. Even though Dean feels vulnerable in only his pajamas, he knows it's making a statement of some kind, obvious enough when Sam pauses by the door for a moment as he looks Dean up and down.
Jack can’t be… but then why would he bring it up? He’s right to say there’s so many books that have been untouched and unread, books that date back past dizzying amounts of years, but it would be strange for the Men of Letters to have ever come across the Empty before, right?
Sam looks so downcast, so broken down that Dean nearly steps forward to wrap his arms around his brother just to try and push that look away.
There’s a long beat of silence as they look at each other, Sam looking rather surprised as his eyes flick from Dean, to Miracle as he approaches with a wagging tail, to the complete and utter chaotic mess of the library, before they lock onto something and narrow considerable.
this before. He’s not sure who’s taken it, most likely Eileen from the angle and considering its in the bunker, but it’s definitely been a sneaky photo since none of them are actually looking at the camera. Jack’s in the middle, a brilliant smile on his face as Sam stands behind him with his large hands resting on his shoulders. Dean and Cas have their arms around each other as they face the other two, Dean grinning back at Jack with his hand extended as if he’s just shoved Jack playfully.
Sam’s the researcher of the two of them. Dean knows enough to get by, but Sam’s is definitely the one who will spend hours and hours reading books just for fun. Hell, he’s the one that’s willingly creating a giant archive for all hunters to have access to, which Dean will admit is a decent thing to do, but Sam actually
“Oh my g –
Cas took the whole bud into his mouth and the added suction was too much for Dean to bear.
“So don't you want to play with the other kids?” he asks Ben.
The man looks at him and smiles softly. “Actually, I did.”
“So, this is how normal people celebrate Christmas? “Jack asks as they start to walk in search of the perfect tree.
“Sam, this is the closest I have to find him, I need to do this.”
Anything.
He arrived at the motel first and waited in their room, a few minutes later Dean arrived, and he started to get undressed like he usually did. Once in his boxers, he moved to kiss Castiel who eagerly kissed back and moaned softly as he felt Dean grinding against his hips. Dean gently pushed him on the bed and started to remove his clothes, he stopped at the zipper before he used his lips to lower it, Castile watched with lustful eyes.
Uriel ignores him and grabs Jimmy by the top of his shirt. “You killed them, didn't you, Nathaniel? Are you gonna confess, you bastard?” he then kicks Jimmy over and the other falls on the floor.
“Thank you.” Cas steps back and goes to join Sam and Jack since he doesn’t know if the brothers want to go with a theme or just decorate with random ornaments. "Sam…are we following a theme?”
between us, one that would help us to rise from the level our
“That sounds fun, Dean-o, when are we going?” Gabe shows up at the door eating a lollipop and wearing an ugly Christmas sweater.
the names of all the capitals in the world- that the smile that appeared
Dean nods walking out from the laundry room. “I know man. They arrived just after I talked to you. I just want to be left alone.”
Anna walks inside and smiles at the receptionist, as she walks in she can hear the TV where a news reporter is talking about the missing boy Ben Winchester, there are mentions of the police and how they are sure its the Origami Killer the one that's behind it, they know the boy is alive but time is running out since the boys have been found three to five days after being kidnapped.
on his face, that night while he was looking at the sky, made the last few minutes worth the waiting.
Gadreel opens the box and finds 5 origami figures.
Castiel nods. “Jimmy, do you remember where you were last Tuesday at 4:30 PM?”
“No, no, now is a perfect time. I just have to get a press conference. Ever since the first kid was found, we have had to have them every day. And most of the time there's nothing new to tell them, is difficult to plan these things and fortunately today we do have something to say. Have you met Lieutenant Ward?”
“Do you have anyone you care about? A girlfriend? Boyfriend? Family?”
Sam sighs as he goes to search for some pills he has in his bag and returns to see Gabe cleaning Dean’s face and hands.
That...
Cas puts away his wallet and nods. “Captain Zachariah said that you could show me to my office?”
“Well, I was just getting bored in my apartment and I decided to come to spend the holidays here with you yahoos and my little brother also you guys need to step up your decorating skills.” He points to the hallways that didn’t have anything.
“No...no, I was alone.” Jimmy looks at them playing with his hands.
He walks to the room after grabbing some water for Kelly.
my arms out to him, "Come here"
“Hey Donna …. I´m off for the conference, please sent the reports to my desk and cancel some of my meetings from tomorrow morning.”
Dean nods and looks at the phone and the memory card. He inserts it and turns on the phone. As soon as the phone turns on there's a video loading and then he can see a hole with water and bars before the camera moves and he sees Ben inside the hole and he is screaming for him. He almost drops the phone.
Cas nods as he listens to him. “What do we know about the victim?”
I wish that I could hold him close and never let him go. I wish that
I wish....
He sighs and opts for another way. “You are right, why should you care? It's not your problem anymore if there are other parents out there! That will soon get a call from the police telling them that their missing son is dead!” he turns and starts to walk to the door.
“Mrs. Kline, It is me, Gadreel, we talked on the phone! ” he calls as he walks through the small kitchen where he can see mostly things for the baby and an old newspaper. He keeps calling and in the living room, he sees a piece of paper on the floor. He leas down and picks it.
“I don't really feel like it” Ben looks at his hands.
Dean thrusts his hips in slow rolls, easing Castiel into it. Not wanting to start too fast and hurt him. Castiel's ankles cave into Dean's ass, forcing him to slam in harder. Castiel sets the pace for him. Moving his bent legs in quick runs.
Dean squeezes in between Castiel and another mother, Ruby. Her eyes are glaring. If she didn't look so pissed off, Dean would've said she looked attractive. Gabriel hands sandwiches to both Dean and Cas, "here. Eat up. They were short lunches so I had to pay for some more." Dean laughs at that.
“You have reached your destination, are you prepared to show your courage in order to save your son? Listen carefully: Take the highway and drive against the traffic for 5 miles, if you haven't reached your destination in 5 minutes, you will have failed. ”
Castiel tries to keep him focused on him as he starts asking him about his job to which the other answers that he only serves God. Castiel nods at that and asks about the crucifixes and nods as the other explains that he is just afraid of the wrath of God.
“How did he disappear?”
Toxic By Britney Spears
The angel tugs Dean upright, thankful for a moment that the rink is almost empty at this time, cuz he knows his human might feel embarrassed for not being able to skate like the other. Together they make their way around the rink glad that there are no kids to avoid or something like that, by the end, Dean can slide with a bit of confidence and won't wobble as much as he did at the start. They had even managed to talk while skating at a slow peace and Dean had actually relaxed and enjoyed it.
Anna fills the form and pays for a week before she grabs the keys for room 202 and goes out before following the hallway to the stairs and then up until she gets to her floor and looks for the right door. Anna is almost near the door to her room when she sees a man that can barely walk and looks injured.
“Yeah, babe..” Sam ends the call an sighs. He will need time off from work if he wants to help his brother so he goes to his office to get everything ready.
“I guess I can do that and I can make you change it if you went overboard,” Sam said and walks with him out of the kitchen after the small angel started to walk in the hallway.
“Listen, kid. If I'm honest, I'm pretty sure that I could have done this investigation without the FBI, but the press was and is all over us, demanding information. This origami killer as they have named him it´s fast becoming a national concern even if he only hits on my city. I mean, there are hundreds of killers in this country, but what do you know, this guy is kinda exotic, He leaves flowers and paper stuff and them the press knew about his MO and suddenly we become the center of the universe. ”
10:37 a.m
Cas blushed a bit and shows him his bag. “Just something to decorate the tree.”
Uriel stops and looks at him. “Well there are no marks on the body, the only clue we have at the moment is that it looks like he was drowned like the others.” He turns to the cop. “Where´s the coroner? We have been waiting for over an hour for fuck's sake!”
“Looks like Jimmy Williams is a pretty religious guy...”
first of all sorry for taking so long to update, life was crazy for a bit. I finished nursing school and started my residency so I was trying to balance the change. Now I´m back and hope to at least update once a month.
Third Song.
“The teacher was angry cuz I was late again. She said that if it happens again she will have to send me back home.”
“I think it´s a bit too tall but it will fit in the …er… living room.” He adds as he doesn’t want to say control room. “We will need some ornaments, man, and lots of lights.”
“I guess it wasn’t so bad,” Dean said as they are sitting on a bench getting rid of their skates. He grabs his boots and looks at him.
“I think it has to do with the fact that this is a vessel and I have a good control of it,” Cas answers with a shrug. He looks at the other people that are there and sees a woman doing jumps in the center. “Here, give me your hand. You need to keep your weight more balanced.”
Kelly nods. “It is in a drawer in the living room next to the couch. You can have it. I'm sure it's more useful to you than to me.”
“This is the one, Cas.”

“And what size is this er... "zone"?” Uriel looks at him.
“If the weather forecasts are right...less than 72 hours.” Castiel grabs his things. “That´s all, I have to say today.”
Once he is as far away as possible, he inserts the memory card and looks at a video of Ben, and then the screen changes to show a few letters that form an address but nothing recognizable yet. He falls down in part feeling relief that Ben is okay so far but is also feeling apprehensive about the rest of the tasks.
“It´s Andrew…”
“Well excuse us for never actually celebrating and we didn’t have anything,” Dean said opening a beer and offers on to Sam who shakes his head.
Dean walks and sees Cas before he goes wraps his arms around his waist. “Hey… what have you got there?”
“Yeah, I think Ben will like that. Well, I’m getting in the car, talk later, bro.” Dean said and ends the call, he is halfway to the elementary school when it starts to rain. He sighs and parks before getting out an umbrella. He waits for Ben, who spots him and greets him.
Sam looks torn at that, he doesn´t want to lose his brother but understands that losing Emma really hurt his brother and then the shit with Lisa. “I don´t like it but… okay, Gabe and I can help you”
“So how´s school? Any new friends?” He asks as he eats some of the spaghetti he had made.
“Oh hey! Sorry, I didn´t see you, how can I help you?” he uses his coverall to clean his dirty hands.
Dean hesitates but finally looks up. “As I told you… I´m still suffering from these blackouts? Don´t know if that's the right word, doc. There are times when  I don´t know what I'm doing… I recover consciousness but I'm in another place and I have no idea how I got there. I had an episode the other day. Do you think it has to do with the accident?”
Ben looks at him. “It was okay.” And then returns to eat.
“Same as always, Sammy. But the good thing is that this is my weekend. I´m on my way to pick Ben from school and tomorrow we are going to the park since he gets bored by staying in the house all day.”
“What was your impression about him?” he glances at him and chuckles. “He has his own methods and I know people don't like them  but he is a good cop. He has his head on the case. I´m pretty sure that both of you will get along just fine.” He fiddles with his necktie. “Damn it! Do you know how to tie a knot?”
His son nods but doesn´t say anything else.
“None is going anywhere, Gabe.” Dean stares at the sweater that looks to have a Santa giving the finger.
“Lucky for you, I’m here now.” He grins as he snaps his fingers and suddenly the whole place is decorated with either lights or wreath or both and there´s music coming from the control room. “Better, now Sammy, I think the traditions say we kiss.” He smirks as he points to the doorway and looks at the tall man.
His bother nods and texts his boyfriend and gives a bit of privacy to Dean so he can call his ex-wife.
“Hey… Cas. It’s a place where people go and there are competitions and… stuff... you know what… maybe we can go tomorrow?” Dean asks as he realizes he is doing a poor job of explaining the festival to his angel.
"No. I just do a lot of reading. Just give me anything and I'll read it." Castiel shrugs, "education was important in my family. Jimmy- my brother and I, we used to make up trivia games on road trips. Who ever could name the most facts would win. It was really stupid. But I know a little of everything now."
Dean helps lift Sammy up into the wagon and the other woman smiles and lifts her son into it. "Thank you so much! You're so kind." Mary and Ruby continue discussing boring stuff that Dean really has no interest in. Grown ups sure can talk a lot. Sammy and the little boy are giggling in the wagon, the other boy holds onto Sam's hand and hands him a sucker from his pail. "Can-dee is the bestest."
"It's okay," Castiel feels bad watching Dean's entire body sliding at every turn the bus takes. "Here," he wraps his arm around the bottom of Dean's waist, pulling him in closer so he doesn't slide out. Castiel realizes that this may look rather skeptical to the other parents and kids so he slowly hides his hand under the back of Dean's coat. Dean doesn't say a word, instead he lets his leg brush against Castiel's.
“Casanova?” A voice calls out. Castiel barely registers the question until a different voice follows up, ‘Clarence?’ He’s met with a sharp elbow dagger to the side.
John makes a joke about how Dean could still impress some ladies; and then coughs and says ‘maybe some fellas,’ if he wanted to offer anyone some work on their car. Dean blinks at the slight recognition from his dad and feels a ping of anger.
Dean's eyes fall closed when he prepares himself mentally, seconds before Castiel's first digit slides in. Dean definitely hasn't felt anything like this before. It is surprisingly better than he could've imagined. Once another finger is in and becoming more comfortable, he relaxes.
Krissy frowns and Castiel feels his heart drop. That's the same face Claire makes at him all the time. "Fine." She doesn't blink and Castiel sighs. Great. First cry of the day. Castiel never has been around too many kids, he wonders if there's an age that the crying dies out. He thought it was infants and possible second graders who cried. He figured fourth graders started to mellow down and stay that way until puberty. Maybe not. Maybe that was just him.
Dean gasps on his own wail and brings their lips together. The two of them give in to the kiss, pulling each other closer and closer. Their tongues brushing against each other’s as their tears and snot mix together. Cas groans and pulls Dean with him to the floor. He kisses Dean’s neck and sucks over the exposed skin. Not until Dean moans through his hiccuped cry does Cas pull back.
Now, Dean doesn’t have a single bit of motivation left to pay attention to this class. Before, he sat with Cas in the back row. The two would hold hands when no one was watching and Dean would type comments on his laptop and wiggle his eyebrows each time for Cas to look down and read. All of the messages were anywhere from funny jokes to heated flirtations. The whole time Cas would type back ‘pay attention, Dean,’ but his face would keep grinning because of the love they shared. Dean feels his tears build back brick by brick. He rolls his eyes to stop them from falling.
Meg and Dean start to part ways when Lisa and Cassie run over to Dean. Cassie looks at him in confusion and asks about the sweater, while Lisa shrugs it off, “it’s super cute, think I could borrow it sometime?” Meg overhears and scowls at the scene unfolding. No faith. Not that Dean deserves her good thoughts.
Dean smirks at Castiel and Castiel squints, trying hard to throw him a face of anger. But it mainly looks as if Cas is trying to hide a laugh.
Dean tries his best not to meet eyes with Cas as walking in. But he was never a lucky man. The two look at each other with red rimmed eyes. The stare ends with Castiel’s eyes blinking closed so he doesn’t have to see Dean any longer. It reminds Dean too much of the exact last moment he and Cas had, the last time that they were so close in his room before Castiel rejected Dean’s love.
“Do you need a ride home anytime soon?” Castiel points at the small dresser in the corner, “your clothes are probably dirty by now. You can wear something of mine if you'd like, but fair warning, I basically just have a bunch of sweaters.”
Dean notices all of the rooms upstairs are dark except for the bathroom which he can see the sliver of light under. He knocks on the door and hears his friend grunt “go away,” and he knocks again. “Seriously, fuck off.”
Cas feels lost but says his goodbye to Max and keeps going. He sees Cassie; typically near Dean, and notices how she gives him a glare and he shakes it off. He is ready to give up and head back to the dorm when he sees a bouncy redhead jump and point at him. Anna, if Castiel remembers right.
Castiel leans back and coats his fingers in lube, "I have to prep you, Dean." Dean hisses from his clenched jaw when Castiel's finger traces the rim before sliding one digit of a finger in. When Dean relaxes a bit more, Castiel goes in deeper, once again waiting for Dean to have comfort. He follows the same method when he goes on to the next three fingers.
Cas whispers, his voice shaking, “Dean I really appreciate it, but I have a fucking plug up my ass right now. I’m fine,” Dean’s face looks across in surprise and slight disbelief. When Dean goes to talk, Cas whispers again, “if you’re about to ask me if I'm sure- I swear…” Cas looks winded all while finishing his Ratatouille and Dean understands. His boyfriend is fucking hot. “It’s a pink silicone plug. Rainbow gem.”
“Daddy? Are you going to pick me up? It’s eleven,” Dean hears his phone echoing a small kid's voice. He startles up and shakes Castiel. “Cas- the kids,” Dean cooes into his ear. Castiel jumps and searches for his phone under the blanket. Dean laughs winking at Cas, “not your phone, bud.”
Cas smiles and holds Dean’s hand. “30… 29…28...”
Mary and Naomi scream their joys and it’s not long before Dean sees Castiel’s phone pinging on the table near him that John and Sam are sending congratulation texts. Mary puts the other men on and they both wish Dean a happy birthday, after sharing their happiness for the two boys.
Cassie groans but rolls her eyes. Obviously more tired by Cole’s annoying ‘rule explanation’ than the actual thought of kissing her friend. She leans over to Hannah and kisses her lips and Cole all but shouts his happiness. Dean isn’t going to pretend it wasn’t something that interested him but he’s never going to say that to his own girlfriend. He rubs her back as she sits back down next to him.
Claire laughs at his comment and he gives her another stern look. “So we learned to quit it with starting the spread of rumors, then?” Dean asks. Claire nods her head in a heavy head bang and he pulls out his lunch from his desk giving her a thumbs up. “Anything else on your mind? Or are you going to head out for your own lunch? Not that I don’t just adore this fun hour of freedom crashed by my students.”
“I love him.”
Cas sighs. “He didn’t do anything. He’s uh- he’s in the closet. I broke up with him.” He bites his lip. “I thought he’d come out. Or at least tell a few people but he’s so scared and I couldn’t be there to watch it anymore… it was almost a year.”
Let me cut your cake with my knife.”
Dean sits on the side of Castiel’s bed and sighs. “I think… Cas, we should talk about something.”
Castiel quietly rolls out from the covers and tucks the blanket back around her.
Dean grins at his friend, obviously proud of himself. “Ok, your turn.”
Dean gets up quick and lines himself behind Cas. Palming his ass and tracing over the lace. He can see the plug under his thong and groans as he taps on the gem and listens as Cas moans at the pressure. Dean would love to stare and admire Castiel’s ass all of his life but the guy feels like he’s about to come all over the bed and he’d rather get a bit of touch before that.
Castiel bites his tongue and makes eye contact with Dean. "Hey, I probably should fill you in on this-" Castiel feels his heart throb inside his chest but he continues on. "Claire's my niece. Her dad and mom died this year, and they left her to me. Kind of new to the parent scene but if I can ask to maybe silence the family talk around her- well, that'd be the best."
Castiel sighs and closes his eyes. He feels a light brush of soft cushions plant onto his face. Dean's lips glide over his entire face, “I'll always come back for you. Next time I'm on the road this way, I will come see you.” Castiel lets go of Dean's hand.
Castiel cuddles into Dean’s arms when he starts the Lord of The Rings, hugging Castiel to his chest under a thin blanket.
Cas sighs, “it’s not.” Here it comes, he thinks to himself.
“Son of a bitch, how did I get so lucky?” Dean hasn't ever been with someone who would have done that. “I love you,” Dean speaks before he can swallow his words down. Castiel's eyes bulge and Dean chokes on saliva. “I mean- no... I didn't mean to, I know we've only been together for two weeks, I can go-”
So instead of being alone in places that let him spiral out and second guess, he’s nested on a bar stool chair, overlooking the campus through the giant window in one of the many study nooks in the building. He has his headphones in and his laptop is plugged into the table top outlets. He's wearing his fluffy purple sweater that Castiel bought him after Dean panicked about not being able to pull this look off.
Ruby picks up Gabriel and smiles at Mary’s save, "I think he's about to fall asleep anyways. Sugar crash. I'll call you to schedule a playdate next week, have a safe walk back home." Gabriel waves at Sam with his sticky hands and then claws them into his mom's hair.
Dean smiles, "okay. But you still can get your own. Just gotta walk faster."
“Really? So I should go impress some ladies, and maybe some boys, by fixing their cars?” Dean huffs out an annoyed breath. “Why would I do that? Only person that matters is Cas and you can’t even talk about him.”
“So how did it start with you and lover boy? When?” Meg drags on, “Balthazar didn’t know anything until you came around moping but I could tell there was someone. You were constantly happy. It was a bit sickening, really.”
Cas shrugs. “I don’t think it would’ve mattered. He was so set in the fact that he didn’t want anyone to know. Becky, the RA, even caught him leaving my room one day and she started asking the two of us questions about “us” and Dean acted like he didn’t understand. Said we were just friends. That was our first big fight. But we made up, obviously. He just looked so small talking about being scared and not knowing how his family would react. I couldn’t make him suffer like that. And it’s not like when I came out it was all sunshine. I understood how it could impact someone so I let it go.”
Cas kisses Dean and gets out of bed. “Come rinse off with me, then we can go to bed.”
“I will be fine, I promise you won't hurt me.” Dean grins sincerely and watches as Castiel's face remains concerned. “Okay, fine, I'll get myself off,” Dean laughs slowly rubbing his hand over his cock. His breath hitches and he closes his eyes. When he feels Castiel's body weight shift onto him, he doesn't open his eyes. But when he feels a small slick circle be placed against his nipple, his eyes flutter open. He sees the top of Castiel's head as he continues to lick over him. God dammit.
Dean sighs as the girls leave him. His heart sinking at the feeling of being alone. It doesn’t help that every time he’s near the girls, he’s reminded how hurt Cas looked talking about them. But just because Cas was jealous doesn’t make it his fault. And obviously Dean knows there was more to it than jealousy- but he will keep trying to convince himself of it, so he doesn’t feel shreds of metal tearing him up from the inside every time he feels guilt and dread about breathing another day without Cas. He always notices Cas watching the group before he walks by. How his eyes stare with daggers at the girls. He can see the way his brain changes from hatred to sadness each time, too. His eyes turn soft and he always looks away. Trying his best to participate with his own friend’s conversations.
Dean can taste his pre-come as he rests his tongue against the tip. "Dean," Cas moans stroking Dean's hair. "What do you want Cas? Tell me what you want," Dean moans against Castiel's cock. Castiel's hips lift up shoving himself farther into Dean's mouth. "I'm so close, Dean. Ah," Castiel's hands untangle from Dean's hair and they claw into the white sheets. Dean smiles and sucks Castiel farther down and then pulls back up to breathe. The first few goes are tough, Dean can't get his mouth to take enough down without a gag. He hopes Castiel doesn't mind that, but if he does, the guys got to realize this is Dean's first given blowjob.
Dean admits that he and Lisa broke up. He explains how Lisa thinks Dean likes Jo more because she saw him hug Jo before the dance started. And Dean tried to say he was just saying hi to her but she wouldn’t believe him.
He tries to see any emotion Meg is feeling towards him but is unsure. “Listen, I still love him. I’ll always love him. And I want him back and I want to make him proud and I want to give him everything he deserves. So I’m trying to help myself so I can actually love him how he needed the whole time.” He laughs, “I wouldn’t be sitting here; in public, in a fluffy purple sweater listening to Taylor Swift as I write a paper on gay panic if I wasn’t really trying.”
Dean gets up quickly, feeling weak and sore, but he ignores it. “Honey-” Dean grabs Castiel back towards him, “Cas. Come with me then,” Dean strokes up and down Castiel's arms. “We can pack whatever you need and you can come back with me. If you want to keep working with animals, there's a ton everywhere you will go.” Dean kisses Castiel's nose, “and if you want to find something else, then I'll be right there to help you.”
Dean walks over and plants a kiss to the top of Emma's head. "I'm not looking for a girlfriend. And if I were, your mom and I still wouldn't be together. I got you out of this deal, and that's all I need. I love you, Emma."
Castiel blinks and holds his eyes closed through a deep breath and then he leans forward and pulls Dean close. The kiss definitely could have stopped sooner than it had, but it lasted almost as long as Cassie and Dean’s kiss in a previous round. He quickly lets go like his hands were burned on Dean’s shirt and he looks over at Inias who is chewing his lip.
Despite that dream, they have a plan already and Dean’s not wasting time to strip Cas down and see this plug for himself.
Dean groans at the speech that Cas repeats far too often, “I know, I know. But like, you fully went all the way?” Cas lets Dean have the moment and says yes.
Dean grins at Claire’s obvious embarrassment. “Plus that Becky can never keep her mouth shut.”
John’s under the car and asking for Dean to pass him tools. It’s so awkward but at least he can’t see his dad's eyes.
Cas gasps, “I’ve always wanted you. Don’t say that.” He looks at how sincere Dean’s eyes are gazing into his own. “Dean, but what about your family?”
Mary looks shocked and Sam laughs. “Dude, I think I already knew.” He then follows up with, “besides it doesn’t matter. My friend Gilda is a lesbian. And she’s dating this girl Dorothy right now. I think she’s bi. Or pan.”
Max looks at the shots and flashes an ear to ear grin, “what’s the occasion?”
Dean looks at the chair next to him and she takes the hint and sits. He goes to pause his music and she lets out a far too loud of a laugh. “Sorry, sorry. Just didn’t think I’d find you listening to Taylor Swift.”
Shit hits the fan when their mothers FaceTime the boys together asking them for any requests for this year's Thanksgiving. Cas anxiously asks, “would I be able to bring someone home with me?”
Castiel sobs into her shoulder, “he was fine. I- I- I said his name,” he chokes, “I wasn’t thinking of Max. I was thinking of Dean. I love him so much, Meg.”
Castiel looks around, "I'm not sure. What one is the teacher?"
Dean crawls onto the ground and takes a knee in front of Cas. The sight of his cock makes Dean feel flustered.
Cas makes sure the clasp gets through the hole before he lets the necklace flop back down onto Dean’s neck.
He tries to convince Cas to cancel but he stops himself. He wants to admire Cas for longer and if they stay here, Dean’s only going to tear it off Castiel's body sooner.
Castiel looks over at the wall of recently turned over photographs. He doesn't mind the fact that Claire flips them around every time she walks into the house. He gets it. Why would she want to stare at the pictures of her dad and mom?
Dean feels his body flushing over in heat and he steps closer. “And I don't have a husband either. I- I am not gay.” Castiel grins and wipes his mouth, “so what are you?” Dean feels his stomach tingle. “I like women.” Castiel smiles, “good for you. Some ones ought to.”
"When did you learn about dinosaurs? Don't tell me you had a Dino collection." Castiel punches him playfully in the shoulder.
Castiel brings his mom's attention back to Balthazar and she looks far less excited but exchanges pleasantries. She calls Dean back over and gives him a casserole dish. “Would you bring this in, hun?” Dean solutes and winks at her. ‘Anything for you, Naomi.’
As they arrive at the home, he sees Naomi pulling up to the house also. She jumps out of her car to hug Cas and before Cas can introduce Balthazar, Naomi turns away to face Dean and kisses his forehead and gives him a warm hug. “Oh I’ve missed my boys so much.”
Charlie looks torn but then smiles when she knows he’s done asking and talking. “From how little I know of you two; no, I don’t think you did the wrong thing. It’s important for everyone to make decisions that will impact them positively. It seems being open and present is a value to you and asking for that is not a crime.”
Claire grins at the two talking; the rest of the class knows the drill by now. When Mr. Milton comes in, they will have at least 5 minutes of free time to pull out their phones and talk to their friends. Claire’s just happy that both of her best friends are in her class, so she doesn’t have to worry about busying herself on her phone each time. Instead she sends a knowing smirk to both girls and crosses her arms.
He meets Dean at recess that day. Dean invites Cas to play with the boys in their grade. When Cas sees the football he grimaces. Dean sees his pained gaze and he waves bye to his other friend in class. “It’s ok. Let’s go play something else.”
"What's wrong?" Castiel pats her shoulder. God he's going to feel this in his knees and thighs when he stands back up.
John meets the boys in passing but doesn’t do much besides shake the new boys hands and give Dean and Cas hugs before he leaves to turn the television back on.
The long blissful noises escaping Castiel's mouth may be Dean's favorite noise. Even before the loud purrs of his babies engine when he takes off. Castiel is the most angelic creature Dean has ever came in contact with.
Emma shrugs and climbs up onto the bar stool. "Mom said she's having a date this weekend. Am I staying over here?"
Cole chuckles, “okay fine. The next person to land on the same sex has to do it, too, and then we’ll take that rule out.”
Dean and Castiel thank Jody again and she just smiles, “and anytime you two need a night, just call. Your girls are lovely.”
Because they moved in earlier than when the school year starts, the two thankfully don’t have to start work and are still on a summer break for another week. It allows them to finish; almost, getting all of the boxes out of the way and having everything set up how they chose together. And it gave them time to decide what they still needed.
Charlie claps and doesn’t make the moment any more serious or saddening. She reads Cas and what he needs after vomiting his emotions out for so long. To a practical stranger. “We’re actually having our meeting in a few. Wanna stick around and attend? Honestly we’re probably just going to talk about Hollywood stars and rate our options. And eat pizza. If that’s your kind of thing.”
Dean looks at Castiel and nods, "yeah something like that."
So they can get through a dinner date before they fuck each others brains out. Right?
to her. Dean doesn’t know what she means but figures it’s about his and Castiel’s kiss. Dean tries to tell her it meant nothing and it was just a game, but when she says, “Dean, it’s either Castiel or me. You choose,” Dean doesn’t let the moment skip a beat before he says ‘Castiel.’ Like that would ever be a hard question to answer.
“Are you ready to head out? We are going to be a bit late,” Castiel whispers into Dean's neck. Dean groans and nods, “yeah.”
It’s been less than a year since the New Years party but the memory has long been repressed by both boys. Dean and he talked about what it meant for them and Dean’s answers weren’t reassuring. He had explained how he didn’t know if he even liked guys and that Cas didn’t need to wait around for him to figure his shit out. Cas shared his worries of dating Dean and then losing their decade and more of friendship. So it seemed smart. Seemed mature of them to pull back and go back to being friends.
Dean works up a quick rhythm, meeting Castiel’s desperate attempts to get Dean deeper. Dean holds under Castiel’s waist, making sure there’s no space possible between the two bodies. He slams into Castiel until he goes incoherent and the only words leaving Castiel’s mouth sound like a foreign language.
Cas shakes his head and goes with Sam and Jack to find the ornaments for their tree. He looks at the different stands that offer a vast variety of them. He can´t understand how humans can come up with so different ideas and create different themes for ornaments. He stops when he sees a set of bee ornaments.
Hold him.
“He was a good kid, he sometimes got into fights with other kids because they called me a…. A whore… I think he knew what it meant and what I did for a living.”
Pamela nods as she listens to him and looks at her clock for a second. “Is there something else, Dean?”
“I´m Gadreel Shurley. I´m a private detective. The families of the victims of the origami killer asked me to investigate the case. I´m here just to ask you some questions about your son.”
The bunker was no exception to this since the monsters and everything else seemed to be taken a holiday, Sam and Dean figured they should take advantage of that and actually decorate the place and celebrate Christmas without the fear of one of them dying in the near future.
And I can honestly say, as I sit here in the comfort of our couch
Castiel tries to intervene. “Ward, what are you doing? That's enough! Leave him alone!”
He stood up and placed his hat on his face before he grabbed his guitar and walked to the stage, he smiled as he listens to the crow clap and the lights dimmed before he started to play a song, he scanned the crow and couldn’t help but to notice a man, wearing trench coat near the left of the stage, he kept playing but he would stare at the guy, he had something that drawled him towards him.
“I made them the old way.” The owner of the stand says. “I also have some made of wood in case you are interested in changing styles.”
“Very interesting...and where does all of that get us?” Uriel asks rolling his eyes, he is still against them having an FBI agent there, they were very capable of finding the killer.
as he studies the light of the moon. Smiling softly, I tilt my
“How could Shaun have disappeared without you even noticing? Weren't you right by the carousel?” Urial asks as he looks at Castiel for a second before focusing back on the father.
“Good timing, Jimmy. Just the man we're looking for.” Uriel walks to the main room and looks at the other.
“I had a lot of fun, Dean.” Cas smiles and once they are done, they stand up and hold hands before they go and explore, unaware that their brothers were watching them from the other side.
It´s the middle of the night and its raining when Gadreel parks and gets out of his old car, a beige Peugeot 505 from 1981 and goes into the building where he knows Lilith White lives, she is the mother of one of the murdered kids. He is glad that since it´s past midnight, there are no other cars parked. He walks to the clerk. “I´m looking for Lilith White”
Kryptonite by 3 Doors Down
Sam nods and looks at a piece of paper he saw on the corner of the table. “Ice festival?”
“Sure, I wanted to introduce myself before getting started but perhaps there´s a better time…” Castiel starts to say before the other interrupts him.
“How are you feeling?”
Kiss him.
Wish...
“Not really, most of the time he stayed here but I always made sure he never met or got close with my clients. I was trying to get enough money so I could leave with him, give him a better childhood, you know?”
“He was near the back, agent.”
Gabe shakes his head. “Deano this is crazy! Look at you! What if something happens to you?”
, all of Sam’s usual caution clearly having gone out the window at some point over the night. Dean doesn’t make a comment about it though as his brother lets out a celebratory noise that draws his attention. Sam pulls out a large piece of paper from under a collection of things, Dean winces as a mug shatters when a few things fall to the floor, and turns to spread it out over one of the empty tables.
But then there’s a sudden noise from across the street and, without thought, Dean takes off towards the cafe with Sam hot on his heels. His heart is thumping loudly, blood rushing in his ears, and he can’t explain the sudden burst of
Jack blinks at him for a moment with his mouth open slightly in surprise before he ducks his head as guilt creeps over his face. Dean grits his teeth, angry at having let Jack think he was at fault for this whole mess for too long, and he has to turn away as his hands shake themselves into fists. He takes one last look at Jack’s room, notes the hotdog pants resting under the discarded photograph, and Dean swallows thickly before he forces his hands open to turn off the light and pull the door closed with a definitive click.
There’s a small part of him that’s slowly getting louder. The part of him that’s been sitting dormant for so long, that’s been creeping forward since that moment with Cas before he… before the Empty. He’s been silently sweeping it to the side and shoving it down as deep as it will go because Dean can’t think about it without feeling like whatever pieces of him he’s managed to glue back together will just
, and Dean slams his fist down on the table in anger, at himself and at this shitty situation they’re in.
Dean swallows thickly, finding it hard to keep Sam’s gaze, and eventually, he drops his eyes. “You’re right.” He lets out a shaky laugh. “Bitch.”
Dean can’t help but smile. “You’d have already done it by now if you could,” he says confidently. “Every moment I’m here proves that.”
Dean narrows his eyes. “That’s it?”
Something is broken inside him, something is clawing at his insides and screaming in his head and Dean doesn’t know what it is. He looks up as Sam closes the door, meets his brother's eyes through the window before he feels his own start to burn and Sam starts to become blurry. He feels his chest clench, his breathing becomes haggard, and this time he can’t force it back.
Now, driving back, it's Dean’s turn to feel empty.
There’s a whole isle dedicated to pet gear, and Dean cruises down it carefully. It takes a few minutes of weighing up all the different types of dog food before he settles on a chicken and rice kibble, specifically the largest bag he can find of it. He throws in a handful of different types of treats, some chew sticks that look like they’ll be good for Miracle’s teeth, and two large stone bowls that won’t be easy to move around the kitchen when he’s eating or drinking.
“It’s not your fault, Jack,” he says, keeping his voice steady and even. “It’s never been your fault. Cas wouldn’t blame you and neither do we.”
in this bunker he’s attached to, maybe something in his room that Dean has missed. Not that Dean can’t focus on that too much as he narrows his eyes at how shifty Sam looks.
Miracle just bumps his nose against the inside of Dean’s wrist, eyes bright and soulful, and Dean swallows thickly as he reaches up to rub his hand over his face.
His head rockets back up, his eyes widen with surprise.
Instead, he walks, walks until his calves burn and his knees ache, and then walks some more.
for that day to come.”
, and Dean knows he can’t waste it.
“We were running low on some things,” she says with a winning smile before she turns tail and disappears. Dean follows her without hesitation, his grip on Jack’s shoulder strong enough that he pulls the boy with him.
his wrists.
nearly knocks Dean’s knees out from under him, and he has to lean against the counter between them lest he sinks to the floor. Of course,
All of a sudden, he just feels so painfully alone. Sure, Miracle is with him, Sam and Eileen are never far away, and if he just picked up his phone and responded to all the messages that have been blowing it up for the last month then maybe that could be solved. But he knows, part of him knows that isn’t what he wants.
There’s not much in Lebanon itself, so Dean drives straight through the centre of town and out the other side, turning to head to Smith Center instead.
He thinks he can do this, he’s
He looks back briefly, over the balcony, to see Sam standing in the library doorway looking back. He seems torn, like he wants to chase Dean up the stairs and yet let him go at the same time. It makes Dean sigh and shakes his head as his hand grips tight around the handle.
Dean feels like a part of him has broken away as his shoulders lighten and a weight leaves his chest in one swell rush that would have him crashing to the floor if he weren’t already seated. He smiles back, leans forward against the table as he shakes his head.
Because he’s scared, he’s so scared. He trusts that Sam knows what he’s doing and he has the utmost faith his brother will come through with something, but Dean is hesitant to let that hope slip back in again.
There’s a long moment before Sam clears his throat. “I thought we’d agreed on just beer,” he murmurs, and Dean’s hands shake.
“Yeah, but shouldn't we show it to the police or something?”
“And how do you feel, Dean?”
Say the words.
Zachariah stands up. “Boys! Continue, Novak”
Welcome, Novak!
Uriel starts to walk again and Castiel follows him. “Do we at least know who the victim is?”
We get to see how Cas's research is doing and Uriel kinda loses it.
The cop nods and goes to the construction site next door. Uriel starts to walk to the place where the body is. He tells Castiel that a man earlier that morning had gone out with his dog and had found the body and from the things found so far it seemed to be another victim of the origami killer.
He was so absorbed in his reading that he didn’t notice the arrival of the impala nor how Dean called his name. he was a bit ashamed to say that he jumped when Dean opens the door.
Dean nods and grabs his jacket. He watches as Sam goes outside and almost immediately the press is surrounding him asking questions which Sam doesn't answer and asks to please leave them alone. He slowly as to not attract attention makes his way to the car and drives off towards the main station.
“I suppose…” Castiel looks for a second at his shady job and starts to do the tie for the captain.
He is halfway to the stairs when he hears screaming from the room and he goes to investigate. As he gets closer he hears thing breaking and how Lilith is shouting in pain. He being one to protect the others opens the door and tries to stop the other man, he is thrown onto the table and does his best to get away from him and finds a bottle which he breaks and uses as a weapon but the other man is a bit faster. He is thrown on the floor and he dodges to the side before he makes the other fall and hits him on the face. The man leaves when he realizes that he isn't winning the fight. He stands up and cleans his face before he looks around.
