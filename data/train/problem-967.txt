He started to drag his feet back to his bed, but his phone started to vibrate in his pocket. The blogger let out a small growl at the thought of it being a random call keeping him from his much beloved sleep. “I just want to sleep... Can’t a man get some sleep?”  He picked it up and saw that it was not just anyone randomly bothering him, but his one and only good friend Sherlock.
The intensity of emotion in John’s eyes made Sherlock shiver for a moment.  Gently he reached out and touched John’s face, confused at the reaction his body had to John’s statement.  Glancing down he saw he was getting hard.  “I…”
“These things take time, m’lord.  But I believe his highness will be pleased if you take a wife to father an heir.  She is a worthy match for you.”
“If I knew of some way to track her and bring her back, I would.  All I can do is send word.  If she doesn’t wish to be found…”
“H-how did you know about that?” John asked, confused.  He thought their sleeping arrangement was unknown to everyone.
When John woke several hours later the candle had guttered out.  His head was on Sherlock’s shoulder and his king was softly snoring.  Their skin was still covered in dried seed.  It was beginning to smell but John found he didn’t mind.  Wrapping his arm around Sherlock’s body he closed his eyes and went back to sleep.
Sherlock leaned down and kissed John’s lips.  “I look forward to many more mornings awakening beside you.”
She said it before time was called.  But then it turned out that neither of us had to go through that at all.  I was so angry, so disgusted, I smashed the casket.  I knew I could never have John.  Never!  It wasn’t fair!
Eventually Rosie tired herself out and fell into a fitful sleep.  Sherlock gently lay her on his bed and curled up beside her.
John ran his hands through his hair before reaching into his pocket to pull out a foil wrapped Alpha-sized condom.  Tossing it on the bed, he began to undress.  “You could have gotten pregnant… Studies show that the treatment for estrus poisoning has a high percentage of pregnancies even if the Alpha doesn’t bite.”
The faun pulled away.  “I want more.”  His hands reached down to touch the flies of Sherlock’s trousers.  “Do you want this?”
“I told you… Often bed slaves are left waiting on their masters.  I was drinking my tea.”  John sat on the edge of the bed and stared at the naked consulting detective.  “I don’t want to be your master.”
“I’ve gone too far?  I’m not harboring the bastard daughter of the one who tried to overthrow your throne.”  Magnussen answered.  “She’s a traitor.”
Hastily the faun turned him around and pushed him so he was bent forward.  He nearly lost his balance when a warm, wet tongue teased his anal sphincter.  The sensation was almost decadent and yet completely filthy.  The faun, John, did not seem to mind.
And then on his tenth birthday he had seen young Lord John Watson at the tournament.  Young Lord John flashed a smile at him that melted his soul.  At 16 he was already beginning to fill out into the young man he would soon become.  Sherlock watched as Lord John’s eyes trailed down to an older fighter’s codpiece and he blushed with a nervous smile.  In that instant Sherlock knew that Lord John was like himself.  In that moment he gave his heart completely to the young lord.  And as he grew he kept his eye on him.
“This is what I have, John.  A man who regards me as his best friend and his child who calls me ‘daddy.’”  And with that Sherlock entered the building.
Sherlock shut his eyes and shook his head.  “Just go.  You’ll be given a chest of coins and jewels for your service.”
Their movements became gentler.  Sherlock relaxed enough to allow John to lazily thrust into him.  His fingers eased in their grip of John’s body.
Sherlock led a grim John to the car.  “It won’t be forever.  Just a few months.  Then we’ll have her back.”
“How far will you let it go?  You are aware at least theoretically what a bed slave does.  Can you go that far?”
The king stepped back and looked away.  “I’ve come to realize that I forced this upon you and I regret that.”  With a heavy sigh he returned to his desk and sat down on the chair.  “You and your wife may go.”
“I don’t care as long as we experience it together.”  Sherlock responded as he wrapped his arms around John’s back.  They took a step together and then another.  Suddenly they were back in Sherlock’s clearing.  Both somehow managed to sit down on the grass despite being tangled together.
I wiggled in anticipation.  I wanted him.  I ached for him.  I wondered how far he would go.  Would he fuck me?  Use my body for his pleasure?  I thought I felt his lips touch the back of my neck.  His breath was warm and fanned out across my shoulders.
It took several minutes for both to recover.  Finally John pulled off and righted himself to lay beside Sherlock even though they were oriented the wrong way across the bed.  “Next time…”
Sherlock closed the laptop lid.  “I suppose I’m asking if you will come with me tonight… to hunt the warg and his mate.”
“Really?” His partner’s response was just as soft.  “We share a bed… We share a home… Your child is my daughter and you think it was merely sex?”
John didn’t even look at him.  Quickly he pushed his hands under his thighs so he wasn’t playing with his fingers.  “Not really.”
Sherlock bit his lips and nodded.  “It’s you.  It’s always been you.  I tried to deny it, but I can’t anymore… I need you.”
John firmly planted his feet on the ground and kicked back with his caught feet.  And then the gorgon dropped him.  John stumbled and fell, his eyes accidentally opened and he took in the scene before him for the first time.  The gorgon, Moriarty had a long, snake body.  Sherlock was caught in his coils.  John had escaped a length of coil.  The gorgon himself had his attention on Sherlock.  Moriarty turned and John gasped.  Dark hair, dark eyes… There were snakes in the man’s hair.  From the waist down he had the body of a snake.
Sherlock reached for the sash that was held out to him for the ceremonial tying of the hands.  At the last moment he added his hand to theirs and wrapped the sash around all three.  “What I have joined together let no one take apart.  So be it.”
Sherlock nodded in agreement, only because he did not want to alert Watson that he was not the Holmes he thought he was.  “Very well.”
Sherlock sobered and absently patted John’s shoulder.  “There’s many things you’ll forget while you’re here.  But I know your name… And I’ll never let you forget it completely.”
“I know what I said.  But that was a month ago when we barely knew each other.  As you recall it was a test.  I didn’t want anything immediate.  I wanted to take my time and find someone I could trust.  I knew if I gave them what they wanted they would immediately pack up and leave.  You’re here.  You’re still here.”
“This isn’t right, Sherlock!  He can’t do that.  You’re the king.”  John snarled at him as they walked, careful to keep his voice low so no one could overhear.  “I’ll kill him.  Give me a sword and I’ll take that smug head off his shoulders and present it to you on a pike.”
John had to admit, Sherlock certainly did know what he was doing.  And Sherlock’s fingers probed him, pushing in what felt like two fingers into his arse.  John hummed his approval and continued.
But it didn’t happen.  The crowd exploded in wild applause and surged around John, dragging him off with them out into the forest.
“If you don’t, then I’ll kill him.”  A metallic squeak and a flap on the metal door opened to allow a barrel of a gun to aim at them.  “Do you want him to die, Watson?”
Sherlock watched as John began to unbutton before pulling out the plug.  “Should I refill the tub or will it be a shower?”
Reaching up, John wiped the stray tears away with his fingertips.  Biting his lips, he glanced at Mary’s ring.  “When I’m ready… Will you marry me?”
“Warg… male… human mate.”  John sniffed deeper.  “Lost his pack a while ago… it smells like… Red Sigma pack.  They were killed over a year ago.  He’s a beta… and… Alex.”
“Now think about the one that brought you here.  Concentrate really hard on them.  The way they look… The way they smell.  Their taste… Anything you can tie to them.  Concentrate on them and when he are ready open your eyes.”
“His highness will send word, m’lord.”  Lestrade stated one evening as he took his post outside Lord John’s bed chamber.
I know what sex is, why does everyone assume I don’t?  I know how impersonal it can be.  From my first time on my knees at uni with an acquaintance eagerly shoving his cock between my lips to the chips vendor who offered a trade in services when I was starving.  My performance earned me a lifetime supply of chips because I was his alibi when someone who looked like him was seen fleeing a murder.  That’s when I met Lestrade.  I’ve seen men experience pleasure, I’ve tasted their semen.  The chip vendor was surprisingly tender and sentimental so the experience wasn’t as bad as my first.
John continued to stare at Sherlock as if to assess him.  “Fine… I’ll take you up on your hospitality.  But I have some money so I’ll pay you back.”
John frowned and lightly touched Sherlock’s chin.  “Sherlock…”  With a sigh he sat on the floor beside Sherlock’s feet.  “You’re right… I am just an animal.  I’ve been reminded of that every single day of my life since the moment of my birth.  I am an experiment.  Could they breed a group of warriors who are far more cohesive than any human group?  And they sent us women to breed with… relying on their conditioning us not to do what came naturally for our species… to share mates and cub more times than was necessary or healthy for our pack to maintain.  But what do I know?  I’m just an animal.  Feral werewolves can at least spend twenty seven days a moon cycle pretending to be human… I lived in a cage.  I never could forget what I was.  And when they sent us out to kill…”  John bit his lips and bowed his head.  “I lost everyone I ever loved.  I only escaped the slaughter because they thought I was dead.  But I’m expendable… because I’m just an animal.  I sired sixteen cubs… there are plenty to take my place.”
“Friends…” Sherlock nearly spit out the word.  “What need do we have for friends?  We have each other.  That is all we need.”
“Many kingdoms have master blackmailers.  They are like leeches.  They suck down power by draining those that already have power.”
The man bowed deeply before his new lord, indicating the three at his feet.  “I bring you these… Gifts, my lord.”
My fingers explored the front of John’s trousers, searching for any indication of an erection within.
Sherlock wrapped his lips around John’s glans and softly suckled and laved the urethra with his tongue.
At that moment the king entered John’s throne room clad in clothing more fitting of his class.  Behind him followed Lestrade.  “Is the prisoner ready for transport?”
“You should have told me.” John agreed.  “But you didn’t.  Instead I learned it from a sister you didn’t even remember you had.”
The boy sloshed out of the stream and to Irene, taking her hand when she held it out for him.  Together they disappeared.
“I think it is bloody brilliant!” Greg answered.  “And you said I am going to turn into something else?”
John watched him until the last of his long body was completely gone, leaving only a grass trail to show he’d been there.  Finally he turned his attention to Sherlock.  “Are you ok?”
I leaned in and lightly pressed my lips to his.  I could feel his breath fan across the lower part of my face as I opened my mouth and licked his bottom lip.  I wanted him.  I wanted to consume him… Offer myself to him.
In less than a minute they were swarmed by Lestrade and his team.  Jim and Seb escaped, leaving Sherlock and John to be rescued.
“That’s good!” John smiled.  But the look on Sherlock’s face immediately made him frown.  “What is it?”
“You’ll bring him around.” Mary smiled at John and jumped back into the water, waiting for Molly to pull on her coat so they could swim away together.
“Oh… Look at him.  Isn’t he precious?”  Moriarty whispered.  “He will make a handsome sculpture to cheer up your dreary garden.”
My andogynecologist made a face as he assessed my paperwork.  “Mr. Holmes… Something came up in your bloodwork.  I can’t put you back on suppressants… You’re pregnant.”
“I will take off this ring and you can woo me properly…  No messy dating of strangers.  I will take this off and I’ll be yours… If you want me.”
“Oh my god!” John cried out as the back door shut behind them.  Hyperventilating a bit, he placed his hands on his knees and leaned over.  “I thought I was going to die of laughter.”
John giggle softly to himself.  “Of course this means you have to take care of yourself for the sake of the baby.  No skipping meals or staying up for days on end.”
The next day was another case which was quickly solved.  Sherlock spent most of the day fiddling with his counterpart’s ancient collection of laboratory equipment, trying to make it work.  None of it was as refined as his own collection in the 21st century.
Sherlock gave half a smile, gently touching John’s cheek.  “Until the day you grow tired of me and want something more.”
“Did Siger tell you?  Rosie will be in Sherlock’s old room and you two will be in the guest room since you share a bed.”  Eudora informed them.
“A house?”  Sherlock echoed as he climbed onto the rock to lounge beside his husband.  “What sort of house?”
John smiled and closed his eyes.  “Thank you… first time since the night they died… thank you.”  Very soon the werewolf was asleep.
It was near dawn.  His torch long since lost power, Sherlock managed to make his way through the woods in pursuit of his quarry.  The man he chased could barely fare any better in the half light of early dawn.  His stumbling through the bushes and over fallen tree litter made it easy to track.  Somewhere ahead he heard a fall and a curse.  But then there was the sound of movement.  Sherlock pushed on ahead and tripped, falling hard on the leaf strewn mossy ground.  Cursing softly he looked back to see what he legs were tangled on.  A naked person lay with his back to him.
Sherlock turned to regard John, for the first time noticing that his companion was flaccid.  Several emotions passed through the detective at once.  There was surprise at John’s limp state.  That was followed by disappointment and sadness.  It never occurred to him that John wouldn’t want him.  But there was the evidence, plain as day.  John didn’t want this.  John didn’t want him.  And suddenly he was ashamed of his arousal… Ashamed at his casual nudity.  John didn’t want him.  No one wanted him.
Master ignored that. “I told him to cover up and wear sunscreen,” he agreed. “Everyone has to do that. And we do try to eat in a civilized manner,” he went on, and Aquamarine paused, lowering the bowl from his mouth where he’d been shoveling grapes, almonds, and olives directly in. “You’ll be fed regularly, there’s no need to stuff yourself.” Easy for
“He must have wonderful knees,” Irene said enviously as he bounced lightly on the balls of his bare feet. She must have really meant it, because she forgot to put a salacious spin on the comment.
With the door open the voices were louder, but not what he considered excessive. “Irene’s bought some real clothes for Aquamarine,” he told her conversationally. “I expect he doesn’t like them. Would you like some tea? It’s lovely out here.”
Magnus huffed at him. “Don’t patronize me,” he snapped, and Bay decided he ought to sit back up. Was the confrontation finally coming? “You didn’t even try it. Try it and see.”
Seeing no deceit or hidden motive there, Sherlock nodded.  This wasn’t like with Victor Trevor.  There had been a hidden motive in his eyes but not John’s.  “Will it hurt you?”
And all John could do was obey.  Pulling his fingers out he used the remaining oil to coat himself and then he was pulled into Sherlock’s embrace.  There was barely enough time to line himself up before Sherlock wrapped his legs around him.  Sherlock was tight and warm.  His hips made slow thrusts to give Sherlock time to adjust but his king would have none of that.
“I… don’t know what came over me.  I was breathing heavily though… he could hear it.  And really it’s none of his business what I was doing.”
John relaxed, hearing Sherlock’s heartbeat against his ear.  Sherlock readjusted the embrace and pressed his face to the top of John’s head.  “Does this mean yes?”
John slowed for a moment, looking down at the mess I made between us before speeding up again.  I watched his eyes close and his mouth form that ridiculous ‘o’ as his semen joined my own.  John collapsed atop me and for a moment I was elated at his surrender in my arms.  But then… “Oh, Mary…”
“The feast?”  John echoed quietly.  There was no mention of a feast when the plans were made for the wedding.
John shook his head.  “This way.”  Leading the way he followed the scent trail that was still very fresh and almost too easy to follow.
“The Mists of Time are filled with many memories.”  Sherlock answered.  “That was when she took me.  Nanny fell asleep.”  The faun indicated the woman sleeping under the tree, completely oblivious to the fact that her charge was missing.
John shivered and finished his climax, melting down onto the bed with Sherlock still wedged inside of him.  Years of careful behavior conditioning by doctors intent on breeding him put John to sleep almost instantly.  Sherlock had no such conditioning and pulled out when he heard John snore softly.  Sitting back on his haunches he stared wide eyed at the man who slept in a puddle of his own seed, bite mark oozing blood.  Licking his lips, he tasted the blood still there.  What did it mean?  Quickly he got up and pulled on a dressing gown to do a search on werewolves and biting during sex.
“No, it’s not alright.  He wants us to live here with him and he puts us in the guest chambers away from the keep?  What happens when he summons me?  I cross the courtyard and knock on the keep gate? ‘Please let me in, I have business with the king in the middle of the night.’”
“I may be your paramour, but I’m also a land holding lord.  I have an army at my fingertips.  Doesn’t that give me any sort of leverage over him?”
“Please… Milverton is my mother’s family name.   This must be your newest plaything.  He is shorter than I imaged.”  Magnussen smiled coldly at John.
John pushed back against Sherlock and raised his head to howl as his seed spilled on the sheets below him.  “Bite me…”
John smiled back and curled up on the couch, his head resting on Sherlock’s thigh.  Tucking his hands up under his chin, he gave a small sigh.  “Full moon is in four days.”
I reminded myself that Rosie was taking a nap.  She would not disturb us for at least an hour.  I could take her father right there in the living room without fear that we would be interrupted.  Mrs. Hudson might drop in, so for that reason I took my groom by the hand and pulled him to his feet.
“Congratulations?  Or no?  You haven’t told anyone.  Not even the Alpha that impregnated you?  I wonder why…”
John was broken and cruel.  It was almost as if he lost something vital when he lost Mary.  And I accepted this John.  A part of me knew this John was better than no John at all.  This John may take his anger out on me.
Sherlock Holmes woke up in the year 1895.  Sherlock knew it was 1895 because he had woken there before.  Of course then he had been high as a kite and nearly overdosed to get there.  This time he was quite certain that he woke up in 1895 purely by accident.
John felt something stir in his chest at the easy, casual way Sherlock was able to show affection to his daughter.  A glance at Molly revealed that he wasn’t the only one who was affected.  There was sadness in her eyes.
They traveled through the twisted hallways to the keep gate.  It was shut and the door’s guards refused to open it.
“Did he touch you?  Hurt you?”  Sherlock asked needlessly.  He already knew the answer, having deduced it before he had offered John his jacket.  Still… He had to be sure.
Sherlock walks behind John after his pet and sits letting his tongue hand out and to try and cool down for a bit.
He seemed a bit skeptical about what was really in store for Sherlock. “You make it all seem a bit too easy Mycroft. Just one little chip and you can track him just like that.”
Sherlock sits close to John’s feet looking up at him and drooling with his tongue sticking out to the side ready to eat the feast. “Bark!”
Sherlock left his flat and started up the stairs to John’s flat. He tried to keep it as quiet as he could so as to keep John from waking up from his much-needed sleep. He finally arrived at the top of the stairs, ready to retrieve the package his brother left for him to deal with.
Walking over to the small wooden table in the centre of the kitchen, it was full of test tubes, conical flasks, vials, and bunsen burners. Some were covered in blood and deer fat - residue from one of his last experiments. Another held a bit of Prussian blue sealed off, waiting to be cleared off the table. A whole network of pipes connected one flask to the next, not unlike roller-coaster hoops, as they knotted, twisted, and went on and on as if it had no start or an end. Some broken shards of glass were scattered across the wooden floorboards at the other side, and the wood was bleached into a yellow tinge. Some mold was growing alongside several of the pieces, and Sherlock vaguely recalled John telling him to clean it (although it was for an experiment).
Sherlock was still hanging off from the tree drinking his soda enjoying the sun upon his face. Felt so new to him and somewhat exciting to be experiencing. If you were to ask Sherlock what he thought about the sun in his old state, he would not have bothered to explain the feeling, nor did he really care about it. Looking down at the three was a sight to behold the fatter-looking one wanting him to come down looked worried but seemed like he really did not care that much. The blond one was cute he thought, sort of looked like one of the flowers he saw under the tree. He had no idea what it was called. Last was the older man with the small dog. He looked confident, the dog not so much it seemed sad to be with him but happy he guessed.
“Sherlock tea is done.” Sherlock blinks his eyes again looking around the room in confusion once again.
John walks off to the kitchen to make a sandwich both of them could share. With what he had gotten at the store there was enough to choose from. “I guess all Sherlock might eat now is just a meat sandwich, ham, and a bit of turkey then. He starts to prep Sherlocks side of the sandwich. He grabs one the clean knives left in the drawers of the kitchen sense Sherlock keeps putting acid on them or they are coated in a deep layer of blood that has created a form of rust on them never to be taken off. He slices the two pieces of bread he laid out on a small white plate with red flowers lining the ends creating a stitched pattern on top of the plate. With layers of ham and the turkey he had bought, he sets them upon Sherlock’s half of his sandwich.
money, if Bay had been in any doubt before. Money did not impress him, though—it just meant certain things were predictable, and others not.
Slowly he pivoted back around to face her and she gave him a pointed look. What kind of world had his new master dragged him into, he wondered futilely as he limped to the car door.
“Stop it,” John told both of them with a sigh. He hoped he wasn’t always going to be moderating spats between them. “Aquamarine, it’s not yours, is it, so put it back. Irene, why don’t you and Molly go and have a lie-down, you’ve been up since before dawn.”
these ideas, he didn’t even much care for that genre. Not born a werewolf, a recently-acquired condition, somewhat embarrassing but not unknown in this world. He tried to control it with drugs, but stress brought on an episode—the humiliation of his new flatmate discovering him mingled with the delicious freedom of his limbs stretching, strengthening, past the point where it should have been painful but was instead profoundly satisfying, enough to ignore the footsteps on the stairs, the knock on the door, then a deep, rich, smooth voice saying—
Aquamarine seemed to know it and dropped back down on all fours, crawling around the deck to show off his rear end in the jeans. That also enabled John to notice his still-bare feet. “Didn’t she get you any shoes?” John asked, as Aquamarine came back to him.
Magnus’s explanations were tidy, but did seem to rely on the statistical likelihood of normalcy, Bay reflected as he dropped the coveralls from his shoulders. A good thing to rely upon, usually, but he’d seen plenty of weird exceptions himself, freak occurrences or personalities or the sheer randomness of life. He’d spent a long time searching for meaning, for purpose in everything that had happened to him, and he saw none—no brilliant conclusion to be drawn at the end of the chain of events. Maybe Jennifer Wilson’s ring was clean on the inside because she took it off every day to shower, maybe the mud on her legs was from being splashed by a cab, maybe her hair was mussed during a struggle with the other person, maybe her case was stolen from the crime scene by an unrelated hoodlum.
“And how old are you, Nico?” Ivan inquired, tipping his face up in the firelight. He saw no deeper spark of recognition in his eyes.
blood,” she pointed out, and Aquamarine growled by way of confirmation. He would do the same to protect either of them.
Bilbo carefully sponged the gown. “I never fit in,” he admitted. Magnus was sometimes surprisingly easy to talk to; he’d heard dragons could weave spells with their words and make you spill your secrets. Though Bilbo’s secrets weren’t worth much to anyone but him. “I was always just a little bit different.”
John lets out a small smile back at ‘Sherlock’ knowing he will have his back throughout this, and he had no need to worry for the worst.
Both John and Mycroft lift him off the ground and back into his chair. John keeps his hand on Sherlock just if he collapsed again.
He took one of the vials filled with the clear light purple liquid and poured it into the closest empty beakers within reach. Holding it up to eye level, he let the liquid sit in the beaker for a moment before peering at the bottom. The detective set the beaker down on the table and grabbed a notepad that rested on one of the small wooden chairs behind him, plucking a pencil off the shelf. After tearing out some old notes he’d left behind in the notepad, each falling to the ground in his haste to start his experiments, he started to write down what he could tell from just observing the liquid. Strangely, the liquid started to bubble ever so slightly, and he stared at it until his phone buzzed.
Sherlock blanks out again just standing still, having John tug at him trying to get him to move. “Wait what box?”
“When he does wake up later.” He walks over to the small table next to Sherlock’s chair and sets the small plate with his sandwich down on it. “It will be ready for him.”
Greg’s german shepherd starts to sniff the air and tugs at this leash to get his attention. “Well looks like they got here in the nick of time. Hey, glad you got my call, John.”
John opens the door to the one and only Mycroft. “Good to see you Mycroft just been dealing with Sherlock.” He points down at the exhausted Sherlock.
“Well, that’s up to Sherlock to find out and God, I hope he can figure it out soon.” He handed the black leather case over to John, who grabbed it and started to drift off again while the DI explained what the chemicals were and what Mycroft’s scientists had figured out so far. Mycroft did not tell him everything, it was still a top-secret project that only whoever was in that room testing those chemcials knew about.
John was holding onto him after he collapsed from sitting in his chair. “Sherlock, wake up! God, please do not do this again to me!”
He walks over to John rubbing his arm. “Um... mister. Do you know what I am at all? I heard you call out my name a few times, but I keep forgetting it.”
Lestrade rubbed the back of his neck and let out a small chuckle. “Mycroft wanted Sherlock to test some new chemicals for him... it seemed like they were having some issues down at the lab.”
Sherlock wasn’t sure what he needed to say, but he felt as if he was a newborn baby just now learning about the world around him and figuring out who he was. He was left confused, did he need to copy this person in front of him? Seems like I should. His gut told him, yes but something in his head said no.
The boy grabs the ball out of Sherlock’s hands and heads back to the game, “thanks, mister.” He waves back at Sherlock.
John hears some rustling coming from Sherlock's chair. Sherlock starts to wake up again after his short nap. Pushing himself up his vision is somewhat blurry but starts to look around his own flat like none of what happened a minute ago ever hit his mind. He rubs his drooping eyes and spots a sandwich. “That looks great, it must be for me.”
“I’m sorry miss about being so proper with you but I am just confused that’s all. Maybe some tea might clear up my head.”
John stops tugging at Sherlock and looks right up at him. “You were just talking about it a minute ago Sherlock?”
Mycroft had a look of relief upon his face. He held out his arms just in case Sherlock fell. “Do not worry I have you sherlock.”
“I’m glad you liked that old jacket, Sherlock. I was going to give it away but never got around to doing it but seems like it might be better off in your hands.”
“This might be more than I was dealing with down at the laboratory. John, would you come over here for a minute? We need to have a talk.”
He rested his hands on the case, feeling the surface and searching for the area where the red liquid had leaked out. Nothing… just absolutely nothing, there wasn’t even any signs of a tear or hole. This was rather strange, even for Sherlock’s standards. Checking the case thoroughly once more, it looked like nothing had ever happened. Weird… He brought the case up to his nose and started sniffing it for any traces of the unknown chemical that had gotten on his finger a while ago.
“Not really. I was going to ask you know what my purpose is. I’ve been sort of lost on what it is really.”
A few hours passed, and John made it back to Sherlock’s flat with all the groceries. He noticed how the door was not locked. Sherlock always locks his door when doing experiments.
John comes running back into the flat pushing the door wide open till it slammed against the wall, shaking the bookshelves. “Mycroft!”
Sherlock was just keeping quiet as the rest of the adults just talked about him. Did he do something bad it was possible he might have done something bad? Still, he did not want to interrupt the conversation and it might be best for now.
Pondering for a bit something passed by his eye. Turning toward it was a crimson red balloon high above a large group of people. Sherlock's curiosity got the better of him and he started to follow the eyesore of a balloon. Crawling his way up to the next group of people the balloon makes a sharp turn around the corner. Now Sherlock starts to panic knowing that was his only lead to somewhere important. Bolting around the corner of the red-lined brick building was a park, a pretty one at that.
Sherlock sits still trying to keep his excitement in for as long as he can before he hears something. A loud knock in that matter now has gotten Sherlock all stirred up. “BARK BARK BARK!!!” He pushes himself off John and makes a run for it to the door at full speed. He starts to glide around on the floor like it is thick ice trying to keep his balance on his hands and feet. Landing on the carpet he digs into it turning the corner and jumping right toward the door. He starts to scratch upon the door letting John know there is danger at their door. “Bark Bark!”
The man huffs back at him before walking once again. Sherlock starts to look around again seeing some small clothing shops that lined the street around him. Now just a few blocks away from his flat is more confused than ever about where he is. Just leaving his last location seemed like a challenge but now he was out but now what was he to do.
Sherlock looks up at John before pouncing on him, giving him as many kisses as he could manage. “Arf!”
The blogger ran out into the living room of the flat, holding his gun in his clammy hand, ready to put a hole into whoever had intruded into his house. He skidded to a stop when a tall figure came into view, and let out a sigh of relief when he saw that it was just Sherlock. “Oh, God. Sherlock! Are you alright?”
He opened the door wide into the living room. It is way too quiet, he thought. He set the groceries over by the front door before shutting it.
Sherlock slowly opened the door. He made sure to keep the creaking of the door down to a minimum, so as to not wake his blogger friend. The green oak door opened just wide enough for Sherlock to slip in and grab the case. Slinking into the apartment, he made sure his own footsteps were light and tiptoed towards the case. Upon reaching it, he extended his right arm and grabbed the handle.
Sherlock starts to focus on the two of them before stabilizing. Blinking a few times, he looks at the two more confused than he has been. “Wait two Sherlock’s but how. I was just how can I be in two places at once.”
Knowing Sherlock is fast asleep now he responds just enough not to wake Sherlock. “Yeah, I did have it open. The case was scratched a bit as well this morning. Anything else you might need?”
Sherlock stands up and starts to walk over to the front door of her flat before heading outside to see how big the world was. “Thank you, Mrs. Hudson, for everything I hope I can come and visit soon again.”
The loft upstairs where John’s flat resided had a nice exterior. Some small plants and a pair of shoes sat close near his door but did not clutter the decent-looking modern exterior. The wallpaper around the door was worn down and slightly old-looking, otherwise the entrance looked quite nice. Next to the door of John’s flat was a small hole. The state of that particular wall’s wallpaper had deteriorated enough to reveal the small hole, just big enough to hide the spare key. He looked down at his hands knowing only one finger was able to fit in the hole to fish it out, and thus he walked over to the hole and shoved his middle finger in it, fishing around for the key.
“God who is it now.” He rubbed both his eyes, then looked back at his clock. He propped his body up from its lying position and slipped on his white slippers. John started to make his journey across his dimly lit flat, sleep still clinging onto his limbs and eyes glazed from being awakened so suddenly.
Mycroft lowers his head a bit and pinches his nose in displeasure at what has happened to his brother. “Just get him in a chair if you can I will try to talk to him if that is even possible right now.”
Setting his phone back down on the table, the smartest man in London noticed how the chemical was not bubbling in the beaker, more than it had been a few seconds ago. He took the beaker in his hand again, bringing it close to his face. Fumes started to waft upwards as each bubble popped, and before he knew it, it filled Sherlock's nose.
“Yeah, that will be fine. Scotland Yard needs me back sooner than I hoped, but do not worry I can text you the place later it is not that far from baker street. Just make sure you do not get rained on looks like that might be coming in soon.”
Tears start to form in John's eyes. Holding one of the viles tightly looking like his own hand was about to burst under the pressure. “At the moment I cannot even tell him when ‘him’ does not even know who he even is or what he should even be anymore!”
“I am not old.” He did get his feelings a bit hurt but that was beside the point, what are they doing to the once great detective.
Both men stood in the demi-dark flat, hyper aware of the dangerous item behind Sherlock’s feet. Each of the vials holding the clear tinted purple liquid wasn’t broken on impact but was now seemingly activated, looking like a shaken fresh bottle of champagne ready to explode. Both looked at the dark case, and back at each other.
Sherlock walks in past the kettle on the stove starting to boil and a bit of steam starting to come out of it. The kettle did interest him a bit, but he walked over to the table to grab a seat and wait for the tea to finish. Sitting down at the table looking over at the vase he delicately picks up one of the small white flowers. Just looking upon it a feeling came to him looking around him now he is in a grassy flower field. A steady breeze flowed around his body while his hair flowed along with the wind. The beating sun just right within the air creating that spring warmth. He feels free of all the burdens of the morning and of his past life gone just pure bliss.
Sherlock gets off John and starts to wag again and panting in excitement. John starts to chuckle looking at his friend. “You are quite a handful even as a dog now, but you are still the same old Sherlock to me.”
Mycroft is in awe about what just happened that he dropped his phone on the ground. John’s mouth drops his eyes are all wide like a deer in headlights on a nighttime drive.
Sherlock opened the case and immediately noticed that each of the vials were back in their positions in the case. “This… What? Is there anything messing with me? I swear, it…”
John comes over to the two brothers holding two of his fresh sandwiches. “Is Sherlock still hungry at all Mycroft?”
Mycroft on the other hand was more focused on getting his brother down the tree. If he fell out, he had no idea what might happen, could he be stuck in this state forever where he could never get him back even with all the testing they might do. “Sherlock, I need you to get down, you are worrying me a bit now just hanging upside down like that.”
“You’ll be fine, Sherlock. We will figure out what is wrong with you and contact your brother about the briefcase.” John wiped off the red substance that had hardened over his eyes.
“So yeah, he is alright, I found him, he is just upside down in the tree just hanging off a branch drinking soda. He says hi as well.”
She brings back a light blue jacket. The inside of the jacket was covered in sheep’s wool making it look a bit puffy but just enough to keep him warm if he was out for too long. The shoes she brings over looked like an old brown pair of loafers with small black laces that were tied once before him. Reaching out and grabbing them slowly from her hands, he plops the shoes on the ground and slips the jacket on. It felt so soft upon his arms making just smile in glee. He hugs himself making Mrs. Hudson smile along with him knowing he loves it a ton.
“But it’s gossip!  Who is this Lord John Watson and why does he have so much control over the king?  Is he planning to overthrow the crown by seducing his way into the king’s bed?  And what of Lady Janine who has been rumored to be the king’s choice for a queen?”
Greg interferes for a bit after calming down. “Can anyone explain why Sherlock is acting like this or just better off explain to me Mycroft, what was in that briefcase?”
He quickly slammed the beaker down onto the table, making sure that the liquid didn't spill out. Something is terribly wrong.
Sherlock shuts the flat door before John comes and grabs him. Sherlock starts to squirm around while John drags him back upstairs to his flat. “Let go of me!”
While John and Mycroft are talking Sherlock spots a fly out of the corner of his eye and starts to follow it. He had never been intrigued by something so small, but it brought him a little bit of happiness. The fly heads right for his flat’s door and lands right on it with Sherlock looking up at the little creature in fixation. Sherlock stares at the door not knowing where it leads too but his curiosity starts to overwhelm him. Looking down at the golden doorknob he stretches his right arm out slowly; stretching each finger out ready to make contact. The knob was cold to the touch freezing Sherlock’s fingers a bit, making him flinch. Turning the knob, it stops dead not knowing what he might have done and shakes him to his core. He pulls open the squeaking door slowly and peaks around.
John mumbles something under his breath before going back into his deep sleep once more. The mumble scares Sherlock a bit making him back up toward the t.v before you know it, he lets out a large squeak.
Naturally, as most people would, John woke up at the loud sound, nearly falling out of his bed in blind shock. The blogger tensed up and climbed out of his bed, fumbling blindly for his curtains before whipping them open. A feeling that something was wrong started dawning over him, and he quickly tried to blink the sleep from his eyes as he stumbled towards his small wooden dresser, fumbling with the handgun he kept in the lowest drawer. Whipping out the gun, he proceeded to frantically search for a particular white cigarette-looking box that held the brass golden shells for his gun. When he finally found it a few seconds later, he tore it out from the drawer, but his hand was shaking so much that the shells spilled out of the box, scattering across the floor. He started to pick them up, hastily putting them into his gun.
Sherlock walks over to the bags by the door. “I am surprised at what you bought for my dear brother. He has a natural chef on his hands!”
“There’s no need to yell, John, I’m fine. Why do you have a gun in your hand? Were you planning to shoot me?”
Sherlock knows John is in pain just keeping that private for so long. It feels like it was meant for someone else but him. He sheds a small tear from his eye. “I am sorry you have to deal with my brother like this or me in that matter. If it helps after I go back to that state before I came here, go on a walk with him. It is the least I can ask for.”
Turning back from one of the large windows within his ‘own flat’ everything looked new and interesting. ‘Something missing might be here’ he thinks and starts to search the room for it. Checking under the couch and over by his chair and johns he cannot find it. He knows it’s there but where? It was a place one of a large library of something.
Sherlock on the other hand had no idea what they were talking about let alone why they were laughing so much, but he was craving for something sweet. “C-Could w-we get some c-candy.”
John turns back at Sherlock and squats down putting his hands on his knees. “Sherlock let's head to your chair alright then you can eat your sandwich.”
Sherlock started to ponder on what mysteries could be revealed in light of this investigation. “Wouldn’t I like to know, John? Keep your chin up, we’ve still got a long day ahead of us.”
She giggles a bit. “Stop messing around with me Sherlock. I bet you are doing this for one of your experiments. Let’s just enjoy our tea before it gets cold.”
Letting out a deep breath of slight annoyance and fondness, John calmed down and answered. “Early morning and I’m guessing you’re wondering who came by… But if not...” He yawned again. “Tell me later. I am going to head back to sleep.”
“Hey, I’m not going to bother to deal with this too much, but john call me if you need me or just text me. Alright, there boy no need to get worked up I know you want to head back to your trainer.” The shepherd wanted to go back to the yard. It was just as tired as Sherlock; he just kept whining till Greg took him back.
“Both me and Sherlock before all of this happened knew of one dangerous man. One that has control over all of the high-level criminal activity in London. The one person is James Moriarty. In his hands with the state of the chemicals regenerative abilities, he could create an entire army of just him.”
Sherlock Holmes set the chemical down on the table to check his phone. A text had come in from Molly. “Of course, it’s Molly...” He started to type out his message not noticing the chemical bubbling more and more as it sat in the flask.
Mrs. Hudson walks over with the kettle and two sets of little teacups. “I hope these little cups will not bother you that much, I know you hate it when I get them out.”
“W... Who turned out the lights?” Sherlock stuttered, holding his hands out to find something to grab on to. His phone buzzed again, and he scrambled to find it. He stepped forward, resting his foot on one of the larger test tubes that he left on the ground. He started to stumble, losing his balance backing up into the nearby bookcase. That hurt. The wall and bookcase shook, and at that, the overfilled shelf above him gave out.
Sherlock looks around not knowing where the sound came from but spots the large rubber red playground ball at his feet. “What an interesting ball. Never seen one like this before, or have I?”
“Sherlock you solve crimes, you’re amazing at just finding the stuff I miss... well I miss more than I hate to admit it.”
Just the thought of Mycroft calling John family, it felt like a huge honor even if it was not from the man himself. All he knows is that he can fix Sherlock and get him back even if it takes days or years, he knows he can do it. Walking back to the kitchen with the two vials in his hands he notices something off about them. They were not red anymore but yellow. Just a dark but very creamy sunset looking yellow. He stares at it and starts to wonder. ‘Did I change the chemical? No, it has to be something else at least that is all I know of.’
There was another room just across from his and he peered inside, careful not to set off the bells. The room smelled like Molly. He could see several pieces of furniture, a trunk, a low table, a chair back, a rod holding clothing, a wooden folding screen. Behind it there was movement, faint splashing. He slipped inside, drawn by curiosity. Molly had helped him. It was difficult to trust people, the dynamics were always complex, but she
“Yes, I can see that,” Magnus agreed, in such a matter-of-fact tone that Bilbo turned to him sharply, and was momentarily startled to realize he was still a dragon, and not a dark-haired Elf with piercing blue eyes. “You are hardly an ordinary Hobbit,” he continued by way of explanation, “or else you wouldn’t be this far from where you started, consorting with thieves. Hobbits not being known as particularly adventurous.”
a washerwoman, and make sure she does it,” Ivan clarified sharply. He appreciated the boy’s cheek, but he really shouldn’t let him get away with it. “And when I said
“Surely you’ve had more adventures than me,” Bilbo demurred, stirring some clothing. Could he rig up an automatic stirrer somehow?
“He’s never had a slave before.” Bay was not surprised to hear that, but he didn’t know what reaction Donovan expected. She gave him a critical once-over, eyes focusing on the cane, then on his face, but only as you might inspect a car. Bay knew instantly that she didn’t understand what appeal he held for Magnus. Frankly, neither did he.
Ivan grinned, slightly incredulous but also delighted. The spirit came through as well, even if he didn’t understand who he was talking to. “Well clean it then,” Ivan repeated, and Nico fetched a cloth and some water, his body language very put-upon.
“They take the poison themselves,” Magnus was muttering to himself. “Somehow they’re induced to kill themselves.”
Master was not intimidated by him and calmly stroked Aquamarine’s hair, trying to get him to kneel quietly instead of crawling around. “He kidnapped my slave, I followed them, I shot him,” Master summarized smoothly.
“Come here, lad,” Ivan instructed, waving the boy closer to the fireplace. Reluctantly he came, wary and tense. Ivan looked him over, marveling at how the key features always came through—the high cheekbones, full lips, blazing blue eyes. This time his hair was dark and curly and he was skinny as a rail—but he would be strong, Ivan predicted, and quick. “What’s your name?” he asked conversationally.
“If you like.” He had to catch himself from adding the ‘sir’ automatically—it covered so many sins, like an intemperate tone.
The policeman led the way up a creaky circular staircase, he and Bay in full coveralls with shoe covers and latex gloves, and Magnus only with the gloves. The coveralls were definitely not stylish enough for him, contamination or not.
“D—n,” he muttered, contorting himself trying to see the wound. “Get some water and clean that off.”
He sensed Nico’s surprise when he actually pulled back, withdrawing to his own side of the bed and putting some breathing room between them. Most people in this world just took what they wanted, commanded and expected it would be done. Nico had been at the mercy of his parents all his life, doing as they ordered; now he was at Ivan’s mercy, technically, but he didn’t have to think of it that way. He didn’t have to be afraid that his will would be overridden—at least, not in this particular instance.
, in fact, much cleverer than anyone else. And he had the scars to prove it, or he used to until they were healed by Molly. Masters didn’t like having a clever slave, a slave who was cleverer than they were. His breath came quicker as he tensed, unable to deduce what Master would do next.
“I don’t think he’ll fall,” John countered mildly. Without his father’s more adventurous influence she might have smothered him and Harry as children, with all her worrying. The leaves rustled and a green acorn bounced off his head, and then Aquamarine crouched on the lowest branch, blinking at them. “See, he’s fine.” Aquamarine, for his part, seemed slightly suspicious that he’d been allowed to do such a thing. “You’re a good climber, aren’t you?” John praised. “Are you ready for some lunch now?”
“Come on, let’s go in before it rains,” he murmured to Aquamarine, trying to get him to stand. “Come inside, maybe you can figure out a better explanation. There’s a good boy.”
Magnus looked pensive. “Mycroft will find out sooner or later,” he predicted, exasperated at this inevitability. “I wonder—“ He broke off and made eye contact with Bay. “Would you rather go to the country?” he asked. “Would you feel better there? More peace and quiet…”
It then occurred to Bay to wonder if he should look at this as an opportunity, rather than an inconvenience imposed by his careless master. Unsupervised, new city… Bay squashed the thought right away. The police had seen him. Lestrade even seemed to know him, somehow. He might be able to take off his makeshift collar and join the homeless population for a while—but honestly, at his age and with his leg, that prospect was unappealing.
Bay took a deep breath and nodded, and Magnus stepped away and let him sit up. His dream had been so vivid, so immersive, it was hard to believe where he really was. Sometimes he wondered if
the flogging, Aquamarine reflected pragmatically. His new master might feel moved to do the same at some point. “Reach back,” his master told him, rest his own hands on Aquamarine’s hips. “They’re gone, too.”
serial killers!” Magnus declared in delight, causing everyone to stop their activities and stare at him. “There’s always something to look forward to.” Bay arched an eyebrow, safely out of view, and Lestrade huffed, something more than exasperation.
Bay glanced over at Lestrade and found his expression was attentive, mystified, but also oddly satisfied, like he knew Magnus was going to crack this one somehow, once he got going. He sensed Bay’s eyes on him and his face went more neutral, slightly concerned, and he glanced at the slave, who quickly went back to watching his master.
“That’s right,” John agreed. In the upper crust of society, then, at least before you hit barons and earls. So were the Holmeses, on the rare occasions they chose to socialize. “All three of them belong to her? Why is she selling them?”
“I was worried I had awakened you,” the dragon claimed, his silky tone too innocent. “I had the most interesting dream, and awoke to find myself kicking at the wall.”
“No,” Magnus interrupted seriously. “Don’t underestimate him. He’s the most dangerous man you’ve ever met. But not our problem right now,” he added dismissively. “What purpose would this game, this… conspiracy against you serve?” He seemed genuinely curious.
“Yes?” Sherlock was looking at him questioningly. “Oh, I thought you were just summoning me,” he realized, as John’s attempt at a clever comment failed yet again.
Aquamarine nodded and leaned his head against John’s thigh, shoulders slumped in defeat. “I know, it’s a big world,” John confirmed in a comforting tone. “Most of it’s
Master didn’t sound angry exactly, he sounded… concerned. Aquamarine remembered how stunned he’d been to realize Master would kill to protect him. Stunned, and grateful, and like everything had suddenly changed. Impulsively he launched forward, bringing Master’s lips down to his in a raw, messy kiss that tried to express everything he couldn’t seem to say in words.
Bay judged where the main road might be and awkwardly lifted the police tape to get past it. “No, lots to do,” Bay agreed with her lightly. “I’ll just pick up a cab on the main road, ma’am.” Because cabs stopped for slaves
This was the wrong approach. “What’s missing?” Magnus asked, indicating the suitcase. Bay was not going to dig through a dead woman’s clothes, so he just shook his head. Magnus was eager to tell him anyway. “Her phone! Where’s her mobile phone? There was no phone on the body, there’s no phone in the case. We know she had one—that’s her number there. You just texted it!”
The first step was moving, which he did cautiously, quietly, until it became apparent this triggered no outside response and he shook his limbs more freely, stretching and testing their usefulness. It was not true he had no pain; but it was slight. He felt almost light-headed without it, like he’d forgotten something he needed. He was clean, too, a curiously bare sensation; he was dressed in a simply shirt and trousers, nothing else, plain and sturdy but well-made and softer than typical slave clothing. The only things in the room were the pillows and blankets he lay on; they weren’t the height of luxury, but soft, durable, serviceable. Good quality, money was at work here, but also pragmatism, a lack of ostentation.
“It—it needs to go around the neck, somewhat tightly,” Bay offered, feeling slightly light-headed with the surreality of the situation.
he get worked up about such things? It seemed dangerous. “Well, you don’t remember that, I suppose.” Pause. “Bay? Bay? That’s you. Are you listening to me?”
They threaded through the tents and cages of the slave market, ignoring the calls from vendors advertising their wares. Despite disliking the close proximity with irrational humanity, Sherlock appreciated the energy, the possibility of London, its speed and convenience and capacity for distraction. He missed it, and he knew John did, too, by the way he was staring at the buildings looming around them instead of at the slaves they were supposedly looking for.
“Well, come on,” Magnus encouraged, hovering by the door. “I think better when I talk aloud. And Mrs. Hudson’s taken my skull again, so—”
“He wasn’t born a slave, he got into it as an adult,” Magnus explained to Lestrade as Bay continued wrangling the coverall. “Med school, Army. Presumably an abusive childhood.”
A shot rang out in the still air, echoing slightly, making Aquamarine jump backwards and drop the pill. The man lay on the ground in front of him now, not quite dead yet but rapidly bleeding out. “Aquamarine!” His head jerked up, toward the jumble of boulders nearby, and to his astonishment he saw his master scrambling from them, in his hand literally the smoking gun. Master dropped to his knees beside Aquamarine, setting aside the gun so he could pat the slave down, squeezing his arms and ribs, cupping his cheek. “Are you alright? Are you hurt? Did he hurt you?”
wanted to know. “You, and my master, and Detective Inspector Lestrade”—he didn’t think it would hurt to imply that there was a police officer who was know to him—“all seem to think we’re old friends.” This was a bit cheeky; but the man didn’t seem concerned with that as he frowned deeply at Bay. Then he lifted his umbrella and jabbed Bay in the thigh.
been rolled up at the bottom of a saddlebag on the back of a horse for a while. “Tomorrow have all my clothes cleaned,” he added to the boy, who was gingerly washing his own feet—no doubt he considered that a safe place to start undressing.
Sally’s face took on a look of mild alarm, and Bay knew Magnus had been correct. “I don’t—“ Then she spotted Bay and decided to use him as a distraction. “Er, who’s this?”
Inside the house a not-unattractive man with a laddish air was pulling on a not-very-attractive coverall, and Magnus pointed to a pile of others on the floor. “You need to wear one of these,” he informed Bay matter-of-factly, who began the slow process of dressing.
Not for this man, though, whose eyes raked assessingly over Bay. It made him feel quite naked, which had ceased long ago to be a good thing. “Why don’t you take a shower,” Magnus finally suggested. “It’s there, across from the loo. The shower doubles as a health scanner, so do that first.”
like being towed through the tent by his collar, it choked if he didn’t keep up with Master. And it made him feel like he’d done something bad. But he hadn’t! He’d done something good and saved Master’s life. And, he’d helped catch a serial killer, when no one else realized who it was. But now he was being dragged along like an undisciplined child, and he growled to show his displeasure.
“I’ll find you a collar,” Magnus promised, beginning, absurdly, to dig through cabinets when he ought to be sitting down. “Are there any specifications? I might have one here…”
Bay had been stretching, and marveling at the lessening of the pain he felt while doing so—his leg was still horrible, of course, but other things were much better. Shower, food, and sleep were indeed a potent combination. “Sorry—crime scene?” he said to Magnus in confusion.
This was ignored as Magnus dangled a tag before him victoriously. Actually it was a business card with a hole jabbed in it, through which was threaded a piece of string. “
There was a movement outside in the hall, then the bells jangled as someone burst in and started speaking. His master tensed beneath him in surprise and Aquamarine tensed in response, turning on the intruder with a snarl. Female, collared, impractical black lacy dress, no weapons, aggressive, froze when he growled at her.
“Yes. Thank you,” Bay added, with more sincerity than he usually allotted. He wondered if he ought to apologize for his outburst. But the outburst had impressed upon Magnus the seriousness of the situation, and Magnus didn’t look like he was waiting for an apology. So he kept silent.
. Maybe… he was a genius. Geniuses were often eccentric. Didn’t necessarily mean they were bad. Bay shook his head slightly, telling himself not to let his guard down for cheekbones and cleverness.
Bay wondered if this was going to cause Magnus’s carefully-constructed assertions to come crumbling down around him, like the baseless hustling they were. He fervently hoped not, and was surprised at himself for that. But he knew his hopes didn’t influence anything in the real world, so he let them live this time.
“I need a collar!” Bay snapped, forcefully enough that Magnus stopped in his tracks and slowly turned around to face him. Bay clutched the cane between his knees until his knuckles turned white, trying and failing to keep himself quiet. “Do you know what happens to uncollared slaves who get picked up by the police?” he asked, and tumbled on when Magnus didn’t respond quickly enough. “They’re held in jail for thirty days while the police advertise their picture. They won’t contact the owner, even if the slave gives them their information. If the owner doesn’t come to claim them—and get in trouble for letting them out uncollared—they’re sold at state auction.”
Irene started out by kneeling in front of Aquamarine as Molly had, her flirtatious looks keeping him in place. But he really didn’t like the shoes and he twitched away from them, ending up with his feet dangling over the arm of the chair. Irene huffed and changed position. Aquamarine tipped his head back over the other arm, trying to get someone’s attention. John ignored him except for a quick progress check. “You want to buy anything online?” he offered to Molly. “Did you get to the bookstore?”
that because you realized the case would be pink?” Bay said to Magnus on cue. His master appreciated a bit of disbelief and challenge, which highlighted his amazing achievements.
Oh, only bitter agony shooting through his thigh. “It’s fine.” Magnus shrugged and turned away, as though watching for his transport would make it come faster, and Bay vanished. It was somewhat foolish, here and now, but he had gone without it for so long. A supernatural fantasy, in which he was a werewolf—where did he
Naturally. Of course they could. They could all wear funny hats and clown shoes if he wanted. Magnus was the one with all the power here. “If you’re this—magical being,” Bay began carefully, and Magnus nodded readily, which said something right there, “why don’t you know the answer to this mystery already? Why don’t you just catch the killer right now?”
“How horrible!” Molly exclaimed, kneeling to hug Aquamarine tightly. “Poor thing! You must have been so scared!” Molly was warm and soft, so Aquamarine decided to whimper in agreement and nuzzle against her.
more nutrition than a single vegetable could provide. As soon as they got back to London—and John thought he wouldn’t flip out—he was going to give him a complete physical, and possibly start him on some vitamins.
“Oh, he can say his name, and mine,” Master replied, a bit dismissively. Aquamarine was not offended; he understood this was merely a ploy, to make the Detective Inspector think he was a complete savage whose actions were instinctive, rather than anything he might be held responsible for.
When the scan ended, Bay turned on the shower. He couldn’t escape the spray, which was breathtakingly cold at first. At least cold was numbing; as the water heated up it began to burn his raw flesh, although the temperature was really quite low, to dig into every scratch and sting, to pound every bruise into a throbbing fury.
Every day, or rather night, Ivan pushed a little further. When Nico said stop, he stopped; the novelty had not yet worn off for the boy. He was not allowed to run wild, though; during the day Ivan kept him busy on domestic errands or set him to practicing with his sword. He had some skill with a blade as he’d claimed, quick and strong as Ivan had predicted. Defeated nobles, in between trying to parley with Ivan about their estates, mentioned that the boy’s mother was worried about him, and so Ivan sent him along to her chambers for an hour or so, showing how magnanimous he could be in victory. He regretted it when Nico came back looking tense and guilty.
“Doesn’t matter,” Bay dismissed. The man should’ve stopped with the offer of money. Offering his freedom, too—that’s when Bay knew he wasn’t sincere. Or at least that the plan was too risky for him—freedom had been dangled in front of him far too often for him to put his trust in it.
“They’d be easier to get on, at least,” she grumbled, refusing to sympathize, and John rubbed her knee lightly.
The car pulled into a warehouse, dim and nearly empty. Such wonderful things always happened in warehouses, didn’t they? Anthea nodded at Bay to get out when the car stopped, and as he did he saw a well-dressed man leaning on an umbrella standing before him. No point in asking which way to go.
“It’s a crime scene,” Anderson snapped, contempt dripping from his tone. “I don’t want it contaminated. Are we clear on that?”
him, and saw that the tent he’d just walked through and stepped out of was actually quite small, a domed structure just large enough for two people. He had to drop to his knees and crawl back in—and found himself on all fours on the floor of the spacious foyer, with more rooms beyond. Aquamarine scrambled back out. The tent was small again. He circumnavigated it and poked at it to be sure.
Lestrade nodded soberly. “Well, you’re here now, right?” he offered to Bay, as if this was an improvement. “Shall we get on?”
in the house through a slot in the door, bad things undoubtedly, and Taffy let him curl up in his special corner to sulk after they were chastised by their unappreciative masters. They really had
“Does he, um, speak?” Mrs. Watson asked, clearly not sure if this was the sort of thing one discussed.
“Goodness,” Mrs. Watson commented as they crossed the deck. There was dismay in her tone, but then again there usually was. She moved aside to let John and Aquamarine enter the kitchen.
“Yes, another murder,” Magnus repeated impatiently. “You were an Army doctor, do you want to check out the body?”
His master’s hands moved to trace over his chest. Aquamarine mostly watched the other man’s face, reading the signs of his next moves there so he could prepare himself. “You had deep scratches here, do you remember?” his master said, and he finally glanced down at the smooth skin his master’s fingers were lightly stroking. “Two or three months old. They’re gone now.” Aquamarine frowned, trying to remember. Bodily injuries were often deleted from his memory once they were no longer an immediate threat; the body was merely transport, a tool housing his mind. Its discomforts were distractions he couldn’t afford.
On the desk he found a luggage label with a phone number. “Jennifer Wilson?” he checked. The desk was rather a mess. “Wasn’t that the dead woman?”
