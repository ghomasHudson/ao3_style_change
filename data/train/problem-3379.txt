But nothing feels embarrassing, right now. Not Dean making a noise that somewhat resembles a squeal and twisting away when Castiel's nails scrape across a certain arc of his ribs. Not even when Castiel's arm gets caught in his sleeve while Dean is wrestling him out of his shirt.
"Fuck," he breathes. He wants to close his eyes to squeeze in some control; he wants to watch Cas and never stop looking, because Cas riding himself down on Dean's cock, thighs tense and legs spread so wide, is the prettiest thing he's ever seen.
They get to Bobby's at the crack of dawn. Jimmy grumbles as he gets out of the car, stretching and mumbling about old cars and their older seats. (Dean takes note and decides to take offense later.)
But, at least, that makes the anger in Sam's shoulders duck down again. He slumps in a way that makes Dean’s chest hurt. "What, then?" he demands.
Some moments he thinks it's all true, that he deserves everything that’s happened to him. He thinks he left himself behind somewhere, and there’s nothing left but the hunt. And some moments he realizes he's got a problem, but he's not sure what to do about it.
About one third of the way into the sketch book, there’s a drawing of a stained glass window. They pull into a motel parking lot to steal some Internet, but they find a promising lead. Sam even pulls up some photographs of a now-defunct church on his laptop: it matches nearly exactly.
Cas—and there's no confusion about it, his whole body immediately knows who's behind him; there's no flinch or tension—is pressing small kisses across the line of the back of his shoulders. His hand has migrated forward, resting on the just-slightly-squishy rise of Dean's belly. "Good morning," he whispers, small and intimate. It’s the nicest wake-up Dean’s ever gotten, like he got smoothed right from one dream into another.
Next to him, Cas smiles gently at him whenever he gets the chance. He hasn't drifted more than a few feet away since he woke up, and has found some way to keep touching Dean in one manner or another through the whole dinner—a hand on his thigh, their elbows brushing. About halfway through, they just give up, and Cas scoots his chair a little closer.
Ruby—because of course it's fucking Ruby—is the one who smirks. "Well, big man, unless you're planning to keep your little buddy locked up here in your little sex dungeon..." She spreads her hands and flicks a finger like she's pinging the demon ward she can't get through, even with the door open. "Don't rightly know what you're planning to do to stop it."
"What would it have even mattered, Sammy?" Dean asks, looking up. His brother and Cas blur in front of him. He swipes at his face. "It’s done. Or are you just so desperate for someone else to blame for everything that you're grasping at straws?"
Cas is silent for a long time and Dean thinks he feels a trickle of apology. But no, Dean wouldn't have wanted to know, at least, not now, not yet. Maybe not ever.
Christ. Dean really is kind of angel-dating a guy who’s a hell of a lot smarter than he is. But Cas almost makes this kind of shit sound interesting.
Cinnamon and syrup and tart sugar on his tongue, the flaky, buttery crust and the way the edge pieces crunched. Baby’s hood still warm under the back of his thighs in the late fall air. The way Dean tried to give Cas the last bite, and Cas wouldn’t let him. The taste of apple on Cas’s tongue, and the tight, sweet feel of his smile against Dean’s. The shyness in his smile when he called that their first date.
Cas's arms don't loosen. "You can’t stop me from thinking it, whether or not I say it," he murmurs, his smile sweet. "Do you truly want me to release you?"
Cas smiles back at him and carefully turns the piece back in his direction. Dean gently lips it off the sun-warm plastic fork. That last bite is always so damned good. "I am developing some theories on it," Cas answers, finally, watching Dean chew. The next kiss Cas presses on his lips is careful.
He’s not sure which of their breathing is more uneven when he leans in and kisses it, softly. Then again. And again. With each press of lips and then, eventually, little licks and nuzzles, Dean finds his rhythm.
"You're a menace," Dean sighs, pulling Cas's body down against his in a slow rock of hips. It's still weird to Dean how easily he can move Cas, because he knows how impenetrable and marble-like he can be. Hell, Cas has held him up against a wall like it was nothing. Dean gets this soft, pliable Cas and it's a gift Dean never wants to take for granted.
“Everything is accounted for,” Castiel said efficiently. Selma waited a moment to see if he would go on, and her shoulders slumped a little when he didn’t.
“Asa,” Mary nods towards him. “Charlie. Sorry to see you here so soon. At least, I assume it’s soon.”
“Still late. You’re always late for Christmas,” he mutters, and an overwhelming feeling of Not Yet fills him. He moves on, a slightly watered down whiskey neat waiting on the counter behind him.
A slight nudge in Cas’ side woke him from his dreams, which slid from his mind like water through a sieve. Any attempt to seize it would have been futile, so Castiel let the feeling fade, surprised by the deep calm that filled him.
“I’ve been told the Egyptians worshipped cats,” Castiel said evenly. “I can see why. They don’t really take no for an answer.”
In other words, Castiel had been knocked out all for the sake of a test. He hoped to God he passed considering he really did not enjoy being rendered unconscious and unable to defend himself.
Dean feels his throat close up. So he stops talking and lets Michael fill in the blanks for himself.
“I do… want to get better,” said Cas, feeling hollow just by saying it out loud. It was as though the heavy pool of guilt he’d been carrying in his stomach had lightened, if only a little. He wasn’t sure whether or not he liked the feeling. Letting go of even a piece of it felt like cheating. He’d held onto his despair for so long, he didn’t know what it would feel like to just be happy again. He didn’t even know if he could do it, especially not when the world was showing no signs of being any less cruel than it had been.
And then he feels Billie’s eyes on him. He knows, somehow, that she is waiting for him to fail. That she has a plan in place for when he does. It is that, which allows him to realize the inevitability that something will happen and he will interfere again. This is simply something that is true.
As she drives, she thinks. And the longer she thinks, the more her pain and shock and sadness starts to simmer, starts to build into a quiet kind of anger she remembers from the months she spent questioning her every action, her every stray thought, her every instinct. The months she spent wondering if she was still a side character in Chuck’s story. Only it’s worse now, because all the tricks she taught herself to make those feelings of helplessness go away, they aren’t working anymore.
Claire can feel Cas’ eyes burning into the back of her head. She doesn’t take her eyes off the road.
“I also know that cat fishing is illegal and I could sue both you and Lydia to fucking timbuktu,” says Dean. “Call me again, and see if I don’t.”
Sam was outright staring at him now, seemingly caught between amusement and disbelief. Castiel didn’t think either was an appropriate response, but what did he know.
“So this really is like the old timey cults they used to have back in the pre-Lightbringer days. Like Jonestown?”
“I don’t remember you being… so forgiving,” says Mary then. Billie looks at her and the searching glance raises goosebumps on her arm. There is nowhere to go to avoid Death’s attention, so she does nothing.
“Dean’s already taking care of that,” Cas retorted. Dorothy gave him a look. “What do you want me to say?”
Castiel briefly considered disarming and knocking out the irritating guard, but ultimately decided against it. It would likely cause trouble in their negotiations, and it wasn’t the guard’s fault that Cas’ fears of being trapped were acting up again. He ended up pacing the length of the hallway and focusing on his breathing while the guard watched him. He grew more and more wary the longer Castiel paced the hallway, and after fifteen minutes, Cas disappeared back into his room to put the guard at ease.
“Officially?” Harriet said, pretending she didn’t notice Benny and Jo both falling silent and turning to look at them. “He fell.”
“Well, yeah, I got that part but you could have touched down to say goodbye,” says Claire. “To all of us, actually.
“Okay, fine, Jack’s hopped up on angel juice, and it’s the good stuff,” says Dean, blowing past the cannibalism point. It’s a part of Castiel that Jack had never consciously known about, though he supposes he must have known somewhere in his own head when he was God. He wishes he didn’t know now, though. “So he’s good? No relapsing into explosion territory?”
Charlie looked ready to ask him where his mind had gone, but ultimately her excitement to share her book came flooding back to her face and she began speaking at a rate Castiel found almost impossible to follow.
“Dean is trying to get in contact with Billie, but the signal they usually use is jammed,” she said. “Other than that, Charlie and Dorothy are fussing over the equipment and reports from Mary, respectively, Betty and Wendy are arguing about the Toni Morrison novel Wendy borrowed from Rufus, and Jason has been trying to flirt with me. All day.”
“Bunker doors are locked,” says Patience suddenly. “Dean’s about to find out. Cell reception is out too. Billie doesn’t want us leaving until it’s time to deal, I think. No phoning a friend, either.”
About a week later, he turns on the evening news. Miracle (who Dean has decided to keep because the poor guy had nowhere else to go) sits in his lap, head tucked under Dean’s elbow and tail wagging lazily as Dean pets behind his ears. Sam is nearby, watching a foreign film with subtitles on his iPad and texting back and forth with Eileen. There’s an uncertain set to his face, like he doesn’t know whether or not to be happy. Dean thinks he must look the same, because although they’re in the same room they don’t talk to each other. For a little while, there had been no one in the world but them and Jack. The existence of other people, their sudden re-emergence, was simultaneously a great relief and an overwhelming return of stimuli. There were people again. Walking, living, breathing people.
“Alright, I hear you,” Charlie said, interrupting Castiel’s thoughts. “But that doesn’t change things. Dean usually knows what he’s talking about and if he wants you out of the loop, that’s what’s going to happen.”
“Fancy seeing you here,” he hears himself say. Cas narrows his eyes at him in a way that tells him he’s in a world of fucking trouble, and if he weren’t so numb he might take that a little more seriously. But all he can do is take in the sight of his best friend in the world, whole and real and alive and in front of him and-
Castiel was mostly bored with this. He didn’t care about the significance of using different prepositions within a contract, especially when one such instance caused a fifteen minute showdown that almost had the king walking away from the table. It all seemed like useless chatter.
“Patience is gonna come too. That way we can make the drive in one go, and I can catch some sleep on the way back.”
Billie’s scythe is closer to him than to her. She rolls her eyes and leans back in her seat. Dean can see something of the old Death in her now. Something tired, something arrogant, and something beyond sadness. Dean might label it pity if he was feeling generous. But he knows the word isn’t right, because Billie has seen too much to pity any longer. Cold compassion, maybe. The kind of empathy one might feel for a hypothetical ant about to be crushed beneath an unwitting foot.
“It’ll teach me how to think,” Jack says, when Cas hesitantly brings this up to him. He doesn’t like to contradict Kelly, as Jack’s preference for his advice and guidance is already unfortunately obvious. He knows as time passes, Jack will grow closer with his mother and the tension between himself and Kelly will start to fade. Until then, however, it is like walking on eggshells, trying not to overstep.
Sam groans, as he sees Dean’s eyes light up with the opportunity to mock him for something. Oh well, he’ll let them all have their fun at his expense. He has a spot earmarked for him in tonight’s poker game and he is going to win back that cursed object Dean lost to Amara, so help him. If only because he is ninety percent sure she is plotting with Michael to use it on Chuck and the new Supernatural book coming out is already really mean (according to baffled early copy fan reviews, including noted quote “it’s almost as if Carver Edlund decided between this book and the last that he hates his own characters and wants to alienate his own fanbase?”). Sam thinks it's probably best to limit the defamation at least a little.
Jody glanced at Castiel and didn’t finish her sentence. But despite her polite greeting before, it was more than evident she didn’t trust him much.
“You’ll give us the ceasefire?” Dean interrupted forcefully. Azazel nodded. “Fine. You’re shooting yourself in the foot as far as Naomi’s concerned, but hey. Whatever floats you boat. Want me to take out Kelly too while I’m at it?”
This was about causing him pain. He wasn’t expected to survive this, not really. They didn’t care how functional he was at the end of the countdown because whether or not his limbs were intact, his throat was getting slit.
“I’m glad you two are talking again,” Castiel said. Selma very skillfully masked a snort at this, and Charlie threw her a look before clearing her throat. Noticing her discomfort with the subject, Castiel decided to change it. “Tell Jo that I wish the worst thing someone has done to me is shot me in the leg. She’s done nothing unforgivable.”
He’s gone before Mary can say anything else. There’s a mountain range some of Heaven’s residents like to frequent. Cas knows a place near the summit that usually goes undisturbed, and he decides he is just going to sit there for an eternity. Maybe in the meantime everything will just fix itself on its own.
“You wondering how we managed to keep the damage so minimal?” Dean asked, noticing Castiel looking around. He had asked that question earlier and Dean had ignored him. Castiel guessed that this was another olive branch.
Cas had visited in the intervening years. Or at least he’d tried. Naomi wasn’t always accommodating, and Cas didn’t always know which gates she had left open and which ones she had closed to confuse him. Once Jack had died, Naomi had perfected her method of keeping him out of heaven unless he was willing or able to agree to whatever task she wanted of him. Rationing out his visits with his family had allowed her to ask much of him in the last few decades. The tasks were usually dangerous, and the evidence would suggest his most recent task had proved fatal.
“I’m sorry,” she said when she’d calmed herself down. “I just can’t believe you bit him. I wasn’t eavesdropping or anything, I swear, but Dean yelled pretty fucking loud.”
“Rami, be a good boy and stay quiet. It’s what you do best,” said Dagon to her fellow hostage. “Think you can get us out of these, Azazel?”
“You don’t want to be alone either,” said Dean, and he could see he was right by the way Jo’s expression changed. “No one wants to be alone.”
“Well, good news, then,” said Dean. “Since you have so much practice, why don’t you babysit him and make sure he doesn’t do anything stupid for a while? I’ll catch you up later.”
“We don’t have time to talk,” says Cas, looking around him and catching sight of Billie for the first time. She acknowledges him with a nod that reads to Dean as a particularly pronounced ‘fuck you.’ Cas glares at her. “Aren’t you going to stop me?”
Jack was the first to sit down, yawning as he did so. He curled up on his side and was asleep in no time, to the amusement of Cas, Charlie, and Dorothy. They looked at each other, their previous argument momentarily forgotten.
The engine is still running behind her when Patience walks up to her father’s door. She knocks once, twice. The door flings open, her father standing behind it wide eyed and hopeful. When he sees her, the look of relief on his face is so stark that Patience can do nothing but hug him. There’s still some anger there, on both sides, but Patience forgot how much she missed the man who raised her. It’s good to see him again. It’ll be better when he realizes who she’s brought with her.
“Put them in a cell,” she said. Cas and Jo were dragged once again from the room, kicking and screaming as they tried to fight their way out. Of course, fighting while you are outnumbered and tied up is about as effective as a tantrum would be, but still Castiel strained at his ropes and did his best to hurt the people guarding them as much as possible.
“No,” said Dean, still staring him down. “Don’t kid yourself this anything but an execution. I’m not going to make it easier on you. You have a choice right now. Make it.”
Dean loved him, but Castiel was starting to wonder if Dean trusted him anymore. Or if there was something else amiss between them, some unspoken tension spilling over from Castiel’s drug addled state at Nowhere Pass. A hesitancy and fear in Dean’s eyes that made sex with him actively unpleasant, for the first time. He wanted Dean still, but there was no pleasant buzz in his bones anymore. There was just… worry.
Cas leans in and drops a kiss on the tip of Dean's nose. He doesn't move back after he's done. "I know that you told everyone you loved me," he whispers. "And I would have been okay if you never said it, because I... know, I know that. But I didn't think I'd ever hear it."
Once they get into the room, that’s when the kissing starts—good move, waiting until they’re behind a closed door, because Dean doesn’t know if he’s going to be able to stop. There's soft little playful pecks and long languid things that seem to say more words than Dean can ever seem to manage all on his own, and everything in between. Cas smiles into Dean’s mouth, and their hands tangle as they brush past each other to touch their fill. Dean definitely feels drunk now, but it's on soft skin and softer kisses, Cas's sparkling eyes and low, tiny laughs of happiness.
Cas shakes his head, then tips it. "Wait. Yes, but it made him throw up when he had his appendix out."
Castiel gives himself a good and firm pep talk. Charlie's gift to Dean is a good solution, and it gives Castiel the space he needs to handle whatever it is that's happening in his slow, stupid, overly emotional human brain.
A line of letters right down his sternum, followed by soft, wet kisses, leaves him tingly but fine. The slow lick of his collarbone, followed by soft fingertips and a slight ache, hitches Dean's breath. Cas shifts him around; the other collarbone gets a similar treatment and Dean's definitely getting hard already. He closes his eyes and sighs when Cas slowly licks the nearest nipple and warm lines of gentle pain run slowly down each rib.
Michael has the grace to wince slightly at that. "Dean Winchester, you coaxed a seraph of Heaven to fall for you.” He nods an acknowledgement towards Cas. “You and yours, two humans and a fallen apostate, killed Lilith without breaking the last Seal of prophecy—all with Heaven and Hell actively hunting you, and attempting to facilitate your failure. It should have been impossible. All of this should have been impossible. If nothing else, it has shown me how many of us may have... misjudged humanity."
"Your work?" Dean sighs as Cas's hands finally touch again: hands on his knees, gentle, warm. Then motion—sliding up so very, very slowly inside of his thighs.
Cas looks up and shakes his head. "I'm not... replenishing my grace the way it should. I'm not sure what will happen when it runs out. If it means I become human, well... I've been human. It has its upsides." He smiles, small, a little rueful. "I won't be as much use to you two, though."
Dean waits to see if there's anything left—if Cas feels the need to confess more sins that, in a way, aren't really sins. Sort of. When none come out, Dean takes a deep breath and asks the question he's been afraid to ask since Anna first mentioned it. "How pissed will Michael be when he finds out?"
Cas shrugs. "Neither of us is biologically capable of having the other's child, so there's no risk of Nephilim? Because that would be an immediate death sentence."
"I had—we had—another brother. We never knew about him." Dean tilts his head back to look at the sky again, but he can feel the weight of Cas's attention, that thing that's old and quiet and gentle inside his skin. They’re close enough that the motion makes Cas's dark hair brush against his ear. "He's dead."
"Amelia must have shown Sam the guest bedroom," Cas murmurs as they pass a closed door with light leaking around the edges. Jimmy bids them a quiet goodnight as they pass another door, barely propped open.
Dean forgets to untangle their hands before returning to the kitchen. Sam gives their fingers curious eyes, but the burning need to prove something wrong isn't there. Mostly. Well, maybe there’s a bit of suspicion, but the biggest difference is that Sam stows it for later. He asks, instead, about the plans they've made for the thing with Crowley.
Dean and the ME back-and-forth it a little, but the truth is, they have nothing and it's bugfuck annoying. Dean stomps back to their motel room to do a little more research, and to verbally encourage Bobby to stop dragging his ass.
Cas is already waiting by the door, leaning against the wall with his head tipped back and one hand in the pocket of his coat. The empty plate is in his other hand.
Cas's hand slides up Dean’s arm further, stopping just shy of the still-healing handprint on Dean's left shoulder. "I—I would like to see it? This? If that's okay." His fingers twitch. "I've seen it in my mind a hundred times, and I'd like to know I'm not going mad."
, but pleasure is white-hot up the line of his back and between his legs and he's gonna lose coordination any second now.
Dean knows death coming for him when he sees it, he knows damnation, and that doesn't mean he's gonna run from it. He takes one step forward—
It takes a little work to get both of them covered without untangling them, but neither of them’s in the mood to be untangled, so they manage. Dean nestles his face into Cas's neck, inhaling the just slightly tingly scent of, well... Cas. Dean's pretty sure he's going to sleep for about a century. He's totally fine with that as long as he wakes up with the same guy next to him that he went to sleep with. Heck, Cas'll probably still be watching him with that just slightly soft look in his eyes a hundred years from now, if it comes to that.
"He's a conduit for the Word of God. The past, the future," Cas says, very seriously. "Prophets are protected and monitored—an archangel may come and attempt to smite you if he perceives you as a real threat."
"If he is, he stopped very recently," Cas says. His eyes are downcast, and suddenly, he looks older than is possible. "I'm sorry, Dean."
Dean tilts his head and pokes his tongue into his cheek. Zach is really not good at this, is he. "Angels really don't know how to soft sell, do they? I mean, really, if you'd spent half a second treating me like a person instead of an incredibly smart dog, we might not be having this problem right now."
"But it's possible Heaven is learning and they may have just attempted to trail her to Bobby's?" Dean guesses.
That's probably too close to the truth. Jimmy's face crumples. He sags back into the sofa. "Why is this... why is this happening?"
His head thunks into Cas’s shoulder.  "That…" he grumbles into a mouthful of t-shirt, "was not cool."
Dean sits up, stomach muscles flexing, so that he can run his hands up Cas's back. The flat planes are deceptively soft-skinned, but Dean can feel the muscles under them, flexing along Dean's hands. Cas grinds down on his hips and Dean's brain short-circuits, briefly.
The food, however, is amazing, and yeah, the yoghurt works really well with the warm spice that all of the meat seems to have. The beer is also pretty darned good, but Dean makes a point to drink it slowly and mostly stick with water.
He says as much once they're back in the car, then adds, "Also, what the hell is with taking the food?!"
Still. Castiel knows this isn't quite the same thing, but he feels far too good to think too hard about it. Dean appears to have assumed negotiations are closed and Castiel is content to let him. It takes a couple of days before Castiel stops falling asleep nearly instantly, and he has time to take in everything that is Dean and Dean's bedroom at night.
Sam bobs a nod, pressing a hand to his shoulder to keep it stable until they can get a sling around it. "If she has ID, maybe we can leave her clothes and stuff near where she comes from, or something."
"You too good for bacon, now, Sam?" Bobby growls, taking a nearly vicious bite of a piece. It snaps between his teeth like good bacon should. "Or to say good morning?"
"Yes," Cas rasps. "Very much." He doesn’t move from his heavy slump over Dean's chest. Dean is just fine with that.
Cas, this time, stares right back. "If Dean said he was 'fine,'" he flicks up his air quotes, "would you be concerned?"
, Cassie!" Jimmy answers, his voice rising to a harsh squeak. "Okay, I get that you've been dreaming of this guy here all your life, that's nice for you, but what part of that
"We're all scared," Dean tells the wisp of a memory of a pretty great kid. "That's the big secret. We're all scared."
The silence in Dean’s head is thick and staggering; not even the scream of the demon as it dies punctures the strobe lights that are going through Dean's mind.
human beings around for it, because he, Sam and Cas will be in the Impala and booking it down the highway. (If Dean’s feeling nice,
Finding a spot with enough cellular coverage to reach Sam sounds an awful lot like returning to the real world from a nightmare that, miraculously, turned into something much nicer. Dean doesn't want to, but he also doesn't want to put Sam through too much distress, either.
"Just hold me?" Cas asks and he's so tentative and quiet about it that Dean hurts inside. He's so mad, but not at Cas.
Death selects a cube of red meat on a toothpick and chews for long seconds, before taking a sip of soda and swallowing. "You can't imagine how trivial you are to a being like me. This is one little planet in one tiny solar system in a galaxy that's barely out of its diapers. I'm old, little seraph. Very old. So I invite you to contemplate how insignificant I find you."
Cas stretches on the bed, pointing his toes, pushing his fingertips upwards until they just brush the headboard. It accentuates every lean little line, every hint of softness, the heavy male curves of bone and hair. Dean's mouth waters. He's got his eyes on Cas's erection, curved sweetly upwards towards his belly, and he's heading down in that direction with his lips already parted for a taste when Cas's hand lands gently on his shoulder.
The doors fly open with a blast. Uriel strides in first, and the asshole is fucking smirking. Inias doesn't look as thrilled to be there. Well, la-dee-dah for him.
Cas told him—Cas warned him. But Dean didn't want to believe it of Sammy. Ruby is one thing. She's bad company, a bad decision.
He feels soft skin against his fingertips and realizes that he reached up with one hand to trace those deeply curved lips he was admiring.
actually seen in real life, just, well, in porn. Because he's pretty sure that's a vibrator, that's a dildo, and over at the end, that curved metal thing? That's a plug.
"You have a chance," Death says. "Maybe. But I cannot promise what Heaven or Hell might do if you subvert this before it even gets started." He shrugs like Heaven or Hell don’t matter, and chooses a different platter this time: something else small and round and fried. "But because you are ants—and not just any ants, but interesting ants who've managed to find their own path out of the anthill—knocking it all over might not completely obliterate you."
"Don't feel bad, son," Bobby says gruffly. "That hex bag stuff Sam filled us in on last night would be plenty even if you were at full power."
"Pretty sure you said that the first time you touched that thing, and look what happened." Dean leans his forehead back against Cas's, and he's smiling, too.
It's only now that Dean realizes he's made a mistake. Sam and Cas will absolutely team up against him if they think it's the right thing to do. That's just unfair. Dean narrows his eyes. "You gonna keel over or not?"
They all turn to look at Bobby. Bobby hasn’t moved from his casual lean against a support pole yet. "Oh please.” He rolls his eyes. “I figured out it was gonna be me hours ago. What's one old man’s soul compared to the world?"
But what the hell, these days Dean’s coming back from the dead, and they have preppy boy angels with floppy hair popping into their motel room (what kind of name is ‘Inias,’ anyway) and
that pops through Dean’s ears, like that instant before the relief of blowing his nose. There’s a soft noise, like someone left laundry in the wind.
Everything feels like it's changing, though, and that little detail doesn't seem important right this second.
Cas's groan gets cut off, muffled, as Dean licks a long stripe up him, base to tip. When Dean glances up, Cas has squeezed his eyes shut, the back of his wrist pressed to his mouth. Yeah, Dean gets that feeling, he gets it all too well... but if Cas isn't gonna open his eyes, well...
"Hey, uh..." Dean flashes a sheepish grin up at him. "Do you, um, want me to put on a condom?" He's kind of remembering the expression on Cas's face after, the last time, and it took him a lot longer than it should have to realize what exactly caused it. Dean’s got no problems with the mess that good sex can make, but he’s also never exactly felt what Cas was feeling, either.
But no matter how relieved he is that Michael won't be able to trick, press or cajole him into saying ‘Yes,’ it may take him a little longer to forgive.
"Well," Bobby eventually says, three more hush puppies and a wedge of fried green tomato  later, "It's worth asking."
"I'm pretty sure our father didn't think ‘oh, a miracle!’ when they figured out they were coming home from the hospital with two babies rather than one," Cas answers, amused. "But it may have contributed to everyone thinking I was going to become a priest."
"There's a lot you probably don't know about all this bullshit," Dean warns him. "And most of it’s bloody and ugly. If I had my choice, I'd leave you out of the life completely.” He rethinks that for a second, though, because the fact is: Adam was never a part of the life, and it got him killed anyway.  He shakes his head, ruefully, and studies him. “But considering you can house an archangel, I guess that's just a pipe dream."
"Dean," Sam says. Just the tone of his voice is enough to make Dean want to press his face to the window really hard. Until he knocks himself out again.
It's a dream. Dean knows it, but he just doesn't care. It’s still Cas, whole and complete in front of him.
Dean's vision whites at the edges and he gets one loud "Fu—" out before Cas slaps one hand over his mouth. He's looking down at Dean with dark intense eyes and their hips move to slightly sharper motions. Yeah, that's not gonna last long. Cas collapses forward again, his other hand landing next to Dean's head, crumpling the bedding with effort, using it as leverage to push down into Dean’s hand, sharp and perfect.
Cas folds his arms around him, running his hands down the planes of Dean's back, and pressing just hard enough to rub at the tight muscles under his fingertips. "I've never done this, either," Cas says, quietly. "But I've wanted to." His voice gets small, right then, small and lost. "Jimmy and Amelia... I've watched them for more than a decade. I've seen what they have. I know it's not always perfect, but they know how to be angry and then come back together. I’d like to figure that out. Forgive me?"
Cas just smiles slowly and continues on his journey. There's a tiny eternity that disappears into Cas's need to map out every single spot on Dean's body that makes Dean gasp. And there are a lot of them. Eventually, Cas gives him some relief, gently taking Dean’s aching dick into one hand and pumping a few slow times before smiling down at him. Dean has to swallow down a groan that might be relief, or might be the anticipation of more torture.
Chuck's description of Cas's entrance into the barn is actually a lot better than Inais popping up like a jack-in-the-box in Dean’s motel room. Cas, if the writing is to be believed, is a dramatic fucker and Dean has seen it in person, so yeah, the writing for it is probably accurate. That’s exactly how it would have gone down.
So with a shaking hand, he reaches between them, arching his back just enough to fit his hand there. He presses his palm right to the straining bulge in Cas's pants. It's warm even through the thick fabric and Cas's chest hitches a pleased, happy moan. Dean traces the outline of it, thumb and forefinger running up the sides. Cas's lashes flutter shut.
"Hey, how do you know he's not talking to you, you're family now, too!" Dean objects, just as quietly. Oh hell no, he is not answering. For one thing, they might not be smeared in come anymore, but they’re both still naked under the blanket. Dean doesn’t remember if they locked the door, but at least they’re both covered...
Speaking of not liking this situation. Dean grits out, "And you've got some goddamned nerve showin' up in Adam's body like that. Couldn't be bothered to help him out in life, and now you're gonna wear him around while he's dead?" Hell, if they're gonna get smote he might as well get out everything he needs to say now. Cas's hand twines into his left, the one that's not holding the angel blade. He squeezes, but it feels like solidarity, not a warning.
"That's that, and this is this, those ain't remotely the same thing," Bobby says, firmly. "You get 'em confused, someone gets killed." He shakes his head; Dean sees the motion of it out of the corners of his eyes. "Jimmy's that twin, then. His... brother." He snorts. "You got damned in-laws now?"
No, fucking not a chance. Dean jabs a finger at his face. The defeat in Cas's shoulders is hard to see. The way he won't look at Dean anymore is even worse. "No. You do
Cas nods, and his muscles shift. Dean realizes as Cas's face lifts that he's still planning to keep guard.
"Yeah, that's it," Dean croaks, his hips starting to stutter and roll against Castiel's, hard and fast. "Fuck, that's good. You're good."
Dean licks his lips and fumbles for the lube Cas dropped a few kisses ago, pressing it back into Cas's hand. "Maybe, uh... y'know?" he offers, because 'hey, what about now?' sounds weird, and he doesn't know how to even verbalize what he wants to maybe kind of try.
Cas is smiling at him through Dean's fingers. He mouths at them, playful in a way that Dean suspects Cas never got to be, not in any of his lives.
Sam can’t even off Ruby first and just set up at the convent and wait, though, because if Lilith knows they’re onto her? They’re all screwed. Shit, Sam can’t even come to meet them. He’s gotta stay right where he is and be the good little sacrificial attack dog. Up until he isn’t.
Dean believes him; he can almost feel the not-quite-electricity coming off Cas's skin. But he can feel Cas's contentment more, and he dips his chin for just one last kiss before he knows sleep's going to have him.
The hand Cas has behind him moves aside after a brief tangle, and Cas breathes out, and out, hard. Suddenly, Dean’s fingertip settles against the soft wrinkle of Cas’s rim, but there's space for him. Carefully, watching Cas’s face, he lets his finger sink in, slowly. It’s tight—especially with Cas’s other finger already in there—but he remembers exactly how enthralling this was when Cas pants over him. It’s an easy glide, though: even though Dean’s finger was dry, Cas must’ve been generous with the lube earlier.
"Perfect," Cas says with so much self-assurance and absolutely no hint that it just fundamentally rearranges every single thing Dean knows to be true. How can he just
It’s not that the guy lived (possibly through really dumb means like a demon deal). It’s that he has family: loved ones.
The dream is nice, though. There's a lake and a dock. Dean feels relaxed, and with each slow lap of water against the shore, he gets more relaxed. There's a fishing pole in his hand and an empty chair next to him. Dean knows with the kind of certainty he's just getting used to that Cas is off, just out of frame. He’s probably in that small cabin up the hill. He'll be down soon. There’s a second fishing pole by Dean’s foot, already baited and ready for him.
The fact that Dean’s never kissed another guy before Cas isn't even a blip on the radar. Cas's hand moves from Dean's hair down his neck and to his spine. It strokes softly and all Dean can do is grind down again, gasping helplessly.
For a moment, just a brief moment, it's Cas Dean sees on the floor, bleeding out and helpless. Dean never had trouble telling the twins apart but right then and there, Jimmy is close enough for his mind to panic just a little. Dean manages to clock the demon trying to pin him down, and just as Dean’s heading towards Amelia, Sam's reassuring voice picks up the chant where Jimmy's left off.
Dean knows he's making some kind of noises: he can feel the vibrations of them in his throat, in his chest. He doesn't try and speed this up, because his body's already tight and shaking. He's not even sure he needs the hand Cas has around his cock anymore, but the fact that he's surrounded by Cas on both ends, that's what makes it perfect.
Castiel stumbles on the words, but forces them out anyway. They've spent enough time not talking. "I care about you, Dean and I don't--I don't want you to hurt--but--" He doesn’t want to say it, but the honesty of it is what Dean deserves. "I can't hurt myself too. Anymore." Castiel stares up at the ceiling. "I'm going to want things you can't give."
"You," Cas threads his fingers through Dean's hair, thoroughly messing it up, blunt nails scratching at his scalp. "You are my exception." He kisses Dean, tongue sliding past Dean’s lips, licking at the roof of his mouth. "To everything," he adds when he's done. He kisses a tingling trail down Dean's neck to the fingertips marked on his shoulder. He licks one gently and Dean's entire body jolts, right up into Cas. The smile against his skin tells Dean that was planned.
He and Cas move as one, shoulder to shoulder. Cas's blade whistles, but the song of it ends in a thick, meaty thunk and a scream that hurts Dean's ears. Or it would, if he weren't busy dealing with his own little friend.
Dean snorts and crosses his arms. In one way, Cas had it easiest of all of them: he was never actually declared dead. What they didn’t know, though, was that while they were off stopping the end of the world, Jimmy put in all the paperwork with the university to make like Cas was on “research sabbatical” from his job, because the two of them had been forging each other’s signatures since they were teenagers. Cas’s big brother always,
It takes Dean's futzed-out, hormone-riddled brain a few seconds to figure out exactly what Cas is doing and it’s possible he loses consciousness for a second when he does.
Without another word, but a few knee knocks and the occasional brush of fingers, Cas joins Dean in folding his clothes. Dean pulls the pile of flannels towards him. One of them static shocks him as he shakes it out, and he mutters "Sonofabitch!"
“Sorry,” Dean says, easing up on how tight he was wrapping. He forgets not everyone’s as used to getting banged up and patched up as him and Sammy. He wasn’t kidding around: he cut deep, and between, not against, the tendons. Ordinarily, Dean would sew it up, but they don’t have any numbing stuff left, either.
Cas, patiently, lets Sam sprinkle holy water on him, and touch his arm with silver and iron. "You can try to cut me if you like," he says, almost apologetically, "but it would ruin the edge."
It's their rhythm now, and it's goddamned perfect, pulling them both up and up. Dean wants to just keep going and going, but he also can't wait until they fall.
"You really saved our bacon, Cas," Dean says. "Thanks, but... uh, who was the dick in an ugly suit? Er, no offense," he adds, as Cas gives him a rueful glance.
Cas glances at her before looking to Sam. "I'm glad you're alright," he says. "And I..." his jaw tightens, and he loses some of his calm steadiness. "I'm here to make amends. For what my brothers have done."
"Hope I did something for you, too—ah!" Dean gasps as Cas turns his head, and the trail of his scruff runs tingles up the inside of Dean's knee. Cas's lips follow.
Sam sputters. "What—no, Bobby, that's not—it wasn't like that! Not that there's anything—but I'm not—It was... He was... It was like he made himself this... perfect..." His eyes slide to Dean and slide away. "...Partner."
"C'mon," Dean groans, because fuck if he's going to give it up this easy. But he hasn't got a free hand to work with, and last time, Cas took it upon himself to finish himself off. This time, though… shit, Dean’s getting desperate, here. "C'mon, sweetheart, d'you think—"
Cas sighs. "Well, seeing as how I'm already covered in blood,” he mutters, grouchily, “what's a few more open wounds between friends?"
Look, Dean's not out. But in the abandoned church where they first found Cas? No twin sibling freaking out...  Even if this was some sort of weird erasure thing, from the description of how she talks and acts and looks, 'Anna' doesn't seem all that much like Cas.
Dean rocks gently upwards into Cas's hand, and the roll of exploration as Cas wedges his hand deeper into his boxers is almost distracting enough that Dean stops his own hand moving. Especially when Cas lets go of Dean’s cock and his fingers pet curiously at the thin web where the base of Dean's cock meets his balls.
But just 'cause they're angel-married doesn't mean that Dean ever got to say the words. He didn't even realize he might want to say them, before now.
Cas goes rigid. He’s shocked and it’s showing: he's actually shaking. Everyone stares at him until he replies, his tone almost
"For now, I should rest, as well," he says. But his eyes flick to Dean's. Dean doesn't even think it's a lie, and that worries him a little
Cas shakes his head, his shoe rubbing in a soft sweet scrape against the side of Dean's. "No, that’s not what I’m talking about." He looks up at the laundromat, squinting gently as he looks into the fluorescent overheads. Dean, indulging himself, glances around and, real quick, runs a thumb down the side of Cas’s cheek before pulling it away. "I was referring to having both the memories of, well, my human life and... everything else. Everything I've... been?" He smiles and touches Dean's knee, as quickly as Dean brushed his face. "These memories are among the better ones, though."
," into Dean's ear, and he realizes with a jolt of what feels a whole lot like lust that Cas isn't quite done yet,
Cas doesn’t look all that apologetic. In fact, his eyes narrow—just slightly. Well? he seems to be saying.
Dean snorts. So what if he is? "Alright, wise guy, what's your idea?" Cas already said ‘too complicated,’ so it’s not the first thing that came to Dean’s mind.
He shakes his head, slowly, very deliberately, and looks back at them. “That was when I realized that angels don't understand what 'broken' means. And if they will sacrifice things that are 'broken' for the greater good... they are sacrificing those things that burn most brightly." He looks at Sam, and from the way Sam glances away, looking at the blaze of Cas’s eyes right now is like looking into the sun. "And
back in the old angelic days. He's got a couple of ideas for exit routes that won't involve the normal Sam'n'Dean technique of, well... running in opposite directions.
Morning dawns slowly. Cas kisses his temple just as Dean's awake enough to appreciate it. He wonders how much Cas slept. Recharge or not, Dean suspects Cas naps just a little bit now and then, like he does in Baby’s back seat. They haven't moved much from the positions Dean fell asleep in. When Dean finishes opening his eyes, Cas looks at him like he's won the best first prize in all the county fairs.
They hash it out in seven minutes, and that includes the time Dean needs to digest that Sam is back on the demon blood. Detox, when they get to it,
When he bends in, the kiss is careful and slow, just an easy flirt of tongues, tight lips as they both smile into it. Dean doesn't know when this began to feel so familiar, like sinking into the Impala's purr as she goes down the highway. He presses Cas back against the headboard, and the feel of bare calves sliding over each other isn't familiar yet... but Dean likes it. A lot.
It's a tight, nearly uncomfortable fit with two guys stretched out in the back seat. They're overlapping, interlocking. It's everything Dean wanted it to be.
, hunched over its neck. Like a bloodsucker. God, if he pops up with teeth Dean's done. That's it. Someone else can save the world.
Dean scoffs and points his fork at the way all the onions in hers have melted into the thick, savory broth, and the carrots still have just the tiniest bit of crisp to them rather than becoming mushy the way Dean’s did by the time the roast itself was tender. “Wasn’t like this, though.”
He kisses Cas's neck a few more times, mumbling nonsense about how perfect and amazing he is because, fuck, that just redefined Dean’s entire world. Dean manages to get his boxers back up, sort of, with trembling hands before carefully sliding off Cas to the side and wiggling down. This way, all he has to do is encourage Cas to tip to the side and lean a shoulder against the headboard, so Dean's mouth can reach.
"May I have one of your credit cards?" Cas holds out one elegant hand, palm up, open and waiting. "I'll secure this room while you call your brother. I'd use one of mine, but I suspect I’ve been declared missing, and possibly presumed dead."
Cas chuckles and shrugs underneath him. "Bobby Singer is an ornery bastard who strikes me as the type to be very patient in his revenge."
Dean drops his head back, onto Cas's shoulder, giving him more space to work. "Hmm. Gotta say, yours is pretty nice, too." He remembers the other night, his hands spread perfectly over two round globes, the muscles flexing under his fingers as they worked together to come. Dean moans softly at the next kiss, shifting his hips back into the cradle of Cas's pelvis. He can feel Cas's dick, mostly soft, but still definitely there, pressing into the firmness of his ass.
, there's a hand on his shoulder from behind: it's small and delicate, and he knows that it's Anna's. "I'm sorry, Dean, but you can't interfere."
better days, now.  "I'm thinking," he says, settling further into the mattress, and grabbing with uncoordinated toes at the blanket folded at the foot of the bed, "the beach."
Cas stalks by his side as they slip into the convent. There's no way to move all that quietly, not with the floor being as creaky as it is, and anything that might soften the sound of their boots has long since rotted away. But that doesn't matter; that's not the plan. It's not long before they come upon the first few demons standing guard.
It's rare that they've got cases in the middle of big cities, and even when they do, they normally stay at highway motels off the exits—people don't ask as many questions. But they've been here before: Denver's gotten crowded enough that just driving in and out on a weekday leaves Dean riding the brake while people struggle their way into the city from the 'burbs.
Dean sighs, warm tingles running down his spine at the firm touches. He hurts a little for the Cas that lived that life: the Cas whose brother was the only one in his family to stand up for him when shit got real; the Cas who had to sit there and live with this nice thing he was sure he wasn't even going to get.
After an hour of watching everyone flipping through what few books they brought along with them, Dean fucks off to cool down. He's perched on the trunk of the Impala, a book in his lap that's he basically just staring at and not reading at all, when the crunch of gravel catches his ears. He looks up.
The second envelope is from the registrar. Dean took one class this semester, one hand-chosen by Cas. Something about the modern American novel. The essays were a steep curve, but the rest? Much easier than Dean ever expected. And he
That's Dean’s brother, reaching out. That's Sam, not under Ruby's clutches. That's the knowledge that Sam said he ran away for, but until this moment, Dean couldn't be completely sure that it wasn't just the lure of, well.
"Dean," Cas sighs. Just like in the dreams, he reaches out one hand. He stretches out his fingers towards Dean’s side.
Chuck flinches. "Look, guys," he says, uneasily, then tries on a sickly smile. "This was so much easier before I knew you were real."
“It’s not the first time, and it won’t be the last,” Sam says, with a certainty that should really bother Dean. But it doesn’t, ‘cause, well… Sam’s right.
A thought—the very idea—sticks in Dean's mouth, makes it thick and dark and unpleasantly bitter, but he says it anyway. "Cas, maybe... shit." He blows out a harsh breath. "You know better than anyone 'bout research and signs and sigils and shit. Maybe... maybe, while Bobby's riding the police databases, you should, uh.” He clears his throat. “You should stay here, try to get a handle on this Lilith key bullshit."
His expression when he looks at Dean is bewildered and young, and a little like he just got dropped on his head. "You... went back to school? At the
Cas gives him a snooty look down the bridge of his nose. "That's just... reinforcing a spiritual connection,” he huffs. “That it happens to feel good is very incidental."
Dean finishes on an awkward shrug. "I'm not proud of it, okay? But that's... it's all part of the family business. Ours." He gestures between himself and Sam. He'd include Cas, but he doesn't think Jimmy would appreciate that.
The edges of the handprint are flat, now. Once, insanely, Dean thinks of scratching at the edges of it, getting it all scarred up again. But he knows what Sam would do if the blood started peeking through his shirt and jacket.
But there is a lot about Dean that doesn't fall under the bell curve of normal behavior (Sam has been teaching him statistics terms) that he's learned not to question.
Dean doesn't look. Sam doesn't look. Cas might look, because Cas does not look away from shit. But it's just too childish even for Dean to stick his fingers in his ears to avoid hearing the wet sound.
Cas steps up beside him. He's better for the big picture universe stuff anyway. "Heaven is flawed,” he admits. “But Death said it himself: we've subverted prophecy enough that a new path has formed. It's the only reason he found us of any interest at all."
Yeah, well. Dean doesn’t know if Cas is referring to the archangel or Chuck, but Chuck had better fucking perceive them as a real threat.
He thinks, abruptly, about what Cas said about how his grace is fading, how him touching Dean helps... recharge him. When’s the last time Dean even put a hand on his shoulder or his arm? How low have Cas’s batteries gotten? Why didn't he fucking
Thank you for reading, for following along, for commenting, and for loving these boyos as much as we do!
A shy hand creeps into Dean's hair, but it's not demanding or guiding, it's just... holding. Like Cas feels just as unmoored as Dean does.
Bobby leans into the table, elbows braced, fork casually dangling from his fingers. "Near as we can tell, it's the combination of timing, location, and her death that nails it. Too late now to off her before the rest of the seals go out,” there’s no judgment in his voice, but Sam still flinches out of the corner of Dean’s eyes. “But if we can kill her someplace else, or somewhen else, then we've still effectively broken the key off in the lock. The question is, are there any other factors we should take out of the equation in advance." He gives Sam a long look.
"Yeah," Dean answers hoarsely, and tightens his grip, giving Cas a long stroke from base to tip before gently extracting him out from inside his boxers and looking between them. Shit, that looks just as hot as he thought it would, framed in the vee of Cas’s black pants. "Yeah, just admiring the view."
"Mmm," Cas says, in a dark, throaty purr. When Dean peeks sideways, Cas's eyes are all the way closed now. "Yes, very. It's wonderful."
"I'm alright, Dean, go." Cas raises a hand and loosely pats at Dean's upper arm. Then he lets his head rest back against the sofa back and his eyes drift closed. Dean spends a second making sure he's still breathing before realizing that that's dumb: he's not even sure angels need to breathe.
Dean flicks his chin at his brother in an obvious demand of 'Go, git, go now.' But Sam, being the good hunter that he is, is already moving, nodding. He touches the demon blade at his hip, raising his eyebrows.
The Toreador (R-ED are the only letters that are actually working) Motel is exactly the kind of dump that Dean and Sam normally stay at. Dean knows just where to find his brother—corner pocket room, right off what passes as a fire escape in a place like this.
The light is blue-white, and it’s beautiful. It makes his eyes burn and sting. It takes Alastair screaming. It’s so
Dean is already moving and once he's in the room, he can practically taste the sulfur in the air. Dammit.
Cas smiles, a little shyly. "If you count the evening with the pie on the hood of the Impala, that would make this our second date?"
But they're at the church before they hit another stop light, the sun edging over the church and catching on the steeple in a flash that makes Dean shade his eyes through the windshield. There's an old sedan half-on and half-off the gravel, tipping into the grass by the side. Dean checks his bullets before they get out.
I've been told that this is a cliffhanger and I should apologize, but really I just wanna cackle and say "hey, at least they got all their clothes off this time?"
"Everything?" Dean can't help but ask. He's still got only one eye barely open. His entire body is pliant and heavy, like there's weights attached to his extremities.
Cas reaches behind himself to rest one hand onto Dean's hip, helping him with those last few shaking thrusts, and Dean loses track of everything but the slick slide of dick as it presses so sweetly into and against Cas.
Dean drives them to a shady, empty glen he noticed on the way into town, and parks them in the sunshine. It's a cool day early in winter, but with the sun beating down onto Baby's black surface, it should be fine.
"Oh, Castiel," she whispers, but her eyes are on Dean. It's like she hasn't noticed the blade that's sitting at her throat, and fuck, that is creepy. She's looking up and down Dean’s body like she's seeing him for the first time. "What have you
Dean hears Jimmy yelp from the other room and then Cas explains that he's just warded him from angels, at least. Ah. The rib carvings. They should form a gang when all this is done. Dean gives Jimmy an anti-possession amulet for good measure and hastily draws a few devil traps in the most useful places.
"Not tonight," Dean agrees, then takes a deep breath and blurts out, "But, uh... what if I am interested?"
Cas rouses himself with a little shake. Sam hands him a bottle of water over Dean's shoulder, and Cas takes it gratefully. He doesn't drink it, though, just holds it against his cheek with a small sigh.
Dean sighs and puts those thoughts out of his head. There'll be time for all of that other stuff after, when his brain isn't pleasure-soaked and his limbs aren’t still tingly with orgasm.
Dean falls into violence the way skydivers pour through the sky: controlled freefall, familiar, white-noise and the thump of his fists. Amelia cringes back against the wall. Sam's got the kid and is hauling ass with her out of the room. Honestly, Dean's grateful. He just wishes the wife would go with them.
Dean lets it go and shrugs. "Looking more and more like an ex-blood junkie than a current one. Not sure about letting him out any time soon though."
The fact is, Sammy was right: there would’ve been no way for them to know. Their Dad was gone for weeks at a time. Sometimes that meant he left them with Bobby. Sometimes, well, they got left with each other. And they took care of each other, no doubt about that.
They can't really both thrust at the same time, it turns out, and for just a little bit the shaky intensity of the mood is broken by them both trying, and neither of them getting much of anything out of that. They end up chuckling about it together. But that's good, too—Cas raising his head to wrinkle his nose at Dean, and Dean grinning back, shaking his head. Sex with Cas is so easy that even the mistakes are hot, and funny.
Uriel leaves him with an ultimatum that sinks into the pit of his stomach. Fuck, no. Not Sam. Anyone but Sam.
Jimmy sits up, then presses a hand to the shallow cut, wincing. It's still oozing a bit, but there's nothing there that looks... wet and pink in a way that it shouldn't. "Cassie," he breathes. He looks scared. He looks hopeful. Dean gets that, too. “Castiel.”
"Of course it does," Cas says, softly. "Dean, I know you. We fought our way out of Hell together, and even with you gravely wounded, you did not stop fighting. Even as angels fell, even as your blood and mine spilled and I faltered... you did not stop fighting."
"Dean, what's Bobby going to tell us that we don't already know?" When Sam gestures at Cas, Dean realizes that Cas has looked away again—that he's looking at the huge tree, up at its branches, with a tiny, resigned smile, like he doesn't think he's ever going to see it again. "Castiel already knows more about angels than anyone, than there is in the lore at all—I just spent the whole afternoon looking through Bobby's library!"
Cas steps past Dean—because Dean really doesn't know how to handle normal people—and gently presses her back into the sofa with both hands. "Sit down, Amelia." His smile quirks a little. "You don't need to feed us. I know where the microwave is."
The bed falls away and Dean with it. He lands in a blink on Baby’s hood, legs splayed, arms akimbo. The greenery around him as familiar as his own face. That night is burned into his memory. Adam’s dead, that poor damned kid. He told Sam that a bartender might be the love of his life. He lied, and there doesn’t seem to be a reason for it, because it’s winter and Baby’s getting colder and colder underneath him.
Well, if Cas is giving him the go-ahead, who is Dean to tell him no? He's still hard, and still sort of spilling out last little bursts of pleasure—they both are, Dean can feel Cas adding to the mess between them with every motion. So Dean keeps moving in little rolls even after he thinks they're both done.
Inias says, "Dean, you have to do this." He sounds like he might even believe it. Dean doesn't give a shit what Inias does or doesn’t believe.
Dean gets them comfortable on the couch near the tv, pops on something old, interesting, but not too loud, and places a bet with himself on how quickly Sam will pass out. He loses at 13 minutes. Darn.
“No!” Uriel howls, and that’s enough to distract them all. Dean didn’t think the angel could make a noise like that.
Cas's eyes soften and the look he gives Dean physically hurts him. A tiny smile sneaks at his lips, and then is gone. "We broke the rules one last time, my love."
Dean's breath hitches. It's so much. Also, he… understood that: now, and ever shall be, world without end. That makes not a lot of sense, because Dean’s Latin just isn’t that good. But with the way Cas is saying it, smiling down at him, Dean knows it’s a prayer. Maybe he’s heard it before in some church.
hinky!" He stops to pant in a couple of breaths. “But yeah, that… I don’t care that Cas is man-shaped, but you can’t tell me that’s not weird. Dean, you’re a manwhore, and you’re totally freaking heterosexual!”
When Dean looks around, though, it looks like the Great American Midwest at oh-dark-hundred, so anywhere within about 500,000 square miles. "Cas?" he asks, a little more gently. "Buddy, where'd you put us?"
There's a brief moment where Dean realizes exactly what he's done, but fuck it. He's all in. And he can’t look away from the sight of his ring on Cas’s finger. It’s scratched-up and imperfect, but it fits.
Sam barrels into them, ginormous arms wrapping around both of them to squeeze tightly before letting go. He’s grinning, hugely. His eyes are bright, but not in that crazed, flat way that Dean’s come to dread. "I'm so glad you're alive, man. I don’t know how, but I’m glad you are."
"You're not going anywhere," Cas purrs. He's trying for 'sweet,' Dean thinks, but it's mostly terrifying. And a little hot. "Talk."
Ruby nods, tightly, her arms crossed over her chest. She looks like she's trying not to be scared. Good. Dean's seen what angels can do to demons, and she seems to be remembering that, too. "Lilith is our priority."
Dean realizes, dizzily, what's happening when Cas makes a small, inquisitive noise around him, and makes like he's actually going to pull
Castiel keens. He scrambles to get his hands under Dean’s shirt, running his own nails down his sides.
It's not meant to shut him up. It's not meant to stop him crying, even though Dean really, really, goddamned
Cas smiles at him, silent, water beading on his eyelashes. Honestly, Dean's rarely shared a shower with someone once; twice is weird, especially since it's less raunchy than Dean's been imagining. Or maybe hoping for, since that first one was about anything but sex, too. Still, just being close to Cas inside a warm and relaxing cocoon of water and soap and steam, is so, so perfect. He laughs, softly, and bends down to put a kiss on the tip of Cas’s wet nose.
"Ah!" Cas groans, loudly enough that for one horrifying second Dean's afraid he hurt him. But then Cas’s lips curve in a sly little smile. "Oh, I hoped you'd do that. Again, please."
They're so close. This is the end of the line. What the fuck could Anna have possibly said to scare him?
Sam's shoulders drop and his frown takes over his face. "Are you kidding me? Her husband just dropped dead two months ago!"
Dean lessens the sting of betrayal by spending time with Sam. Who's looking like he's ready to drop off for a nap.
The last of the demons on their side of the door screams its way into... well, wherever the fuck it is that demons go when they die. The floor is slippery with blood, but none of it is theirs. Dean's got a few bruises, and he might be carrying himself like something hurts—it does—but that's not gonna keep him from his little brother. Nothing's gonna keep him from Sam.
"I would like you to be happy for us," Cas says to Jimmy, with the same quiet serenity. "Though if you can't, I understand. The circumstances are... strange, even for me."
The fact that they’re all trusting in a Winchester plan is also really saying something, but fuck it, they don’t have anything else right now.
"Uh. I. Yeah, uh, I'm... Dean," Dean says, and he almost drops the angel blade. Almost. He thinks this could be a trick, but Cas doesn't seem to think so. And since Cas is pretty much the only trustworthy angel he knows, what Cas says about the dickless winged ones pretty much goes. "Fuck. Are you really… you okay, kid?" ‘Cause really, that’s what matters, right?
"Cas, sweetheart, oh God, Cas," he gasps, and his hand grips tightly into Cas's hair because Dean sure as hell doesn't want to move and hurt him or something, but he has to do something. He knows he's babbling, went down the wire into babbling a while ago. The little tuck of Cas’s mouth that says that Cas is proud of himself tightens around the base of Dean’s cock. Cas swallows. Oh, holy shit. "I can't, I can't..."
He doesn't know if it's lust that Cas shoves at him through their connection, if it's love, or if it's both and Cas can't even tell them apart anymore. If that's the case, Dean gets it, he gets it—at moments like this, he can't tell them apart, either. Dean's thighs clench on the thick one wedged between his, Cas rocks against his hip, and he doesn't want to go over the edge yet, he doesn't—
Castiel thinks that nothing in all of humanity could feel better than this. Nothing possibly could--wrapped in wings, embraced in Dean.
He doesn't have to take long to consider it. He's never really thought as much as maybe he should have about what happens if they don't make it—if one of them doesn't make it out. He doesn't work that way. He can't. And if he keeps thinking about what could be happening to Sammy right at this second, he’s going to go fucking insane.
The windows are already foggy and Dean pants out air, hot and humid against Cas's temple. They pump each other with slow, careful movements and it's like pleasure washes over his entire body.
the assigned reading. Dean never really had the chance to read things like The Great Gatsby and Their Eyes were Watching God before… though he’s still not sure he enjoys Hemingway. (And he swatted Cas when Cas asked, innocently, “Too many similarities?” Dean just knows a total asshole when he reads one.)
He lifts his head and Dean cups his cheek, thumb stroking at the last of a bruise on his cheekbone that's slowly disappearing. Cas leans into the touch and smiles. "Hello, Dean."
"Because you—" Then Dean gasps as a tongue sweeps wet in the little hollow of his collarbone, then starts down the other side. Cas licks his way down, and the asshole just puffs once at Dean's nipple before mouthing at the little curve where muscle meets ribs. "Shit, Cas. I can't think when you're doing that."
They cuddle, for lack of a better word, until the air in the car is chilled and the mess in their pants is kinda gross. Dean pulls away reluctantly, but Cas chases him with hands and a small sound of disappointment.
"Search the place for hex bags," the grumpy one instructs his lackeys before turning his attention to Dean. That expression on his face is probably supposed to resemble a smile. "Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Zachariah, and you two are a pain in my ass."
Castiel rolls his eyes, mild annoyance overtaking the sharp prickling in them. For the first time, he turns to glance at Dean. "You've been very vocal about it for as long as I've known you."
It occurs to Dean that this is probably not a trap, because Cas would have had to tell Anna how to reach him and he’s pretty sure Cas wouldn’t accidentally let that slip, even under torture. But he doesn't actually know what he's walking in on, either. So when they pull up to a generic-looking house on an ordinary-looking block of Midwest suburbia, Dean has no idea what's going to happen after he knocks on the door.
He's always thought about certain things. An idea that there is something out there for him, waiting, watching, has circled in and out of his brain for years. Before Hell, in his last run of sin and vice because fuck it, he was going to die so why the hell not, he'd given in to an impulse. One that he’d buried deep—but old, familiar. Not something he acknowledged often, or ever.
Cas's hands like to wander, running long fingers all over Dean's skin. They like to push his shirt up so that he can trail warmth across Dean's ribs and backbone. The backs of his knuckles like to brush down Dean's stomach and his fingers seem to enjoy tweaking Dean's nipples, soft bits of friction that zing through his entire body.
Dean sighs into it and then lifts his head. They kiss softly, a slow press of lips, and Dean can feel Cas’s body curve into him like it's exactly what he needs. When they part, Cas presses one last peck on Dean's lips before pulling away.
At one point, Cas's eyes focus on something that’s not visible through the windshield. "It's started," he says in a low voice. "Fifteen demons have just entered the convent. More are coming."
Sam ducks his head. "We think that last standoff burned through a lot of what I'd taken in the days before. I've started feeling the withdrawal, but so far I can tell, it's not
Dean grins into Cas's temple, so happy that he thinks he might be glowing a little. "Yeah I did," he says, smugly. Then he whispers, "Made you swear, too, sweetheart."
"Is he okay?" Sam asks, softly, as they're cruising down the highway towards what sounds like a nest of vampires. Dean really hopes it's a small one.
(Also, now he’s got to wonder if coming untouched feels as hot as it sounds and looked from his point of view. Because, holy fuck, that was unbelievable, and Dean’s definitely going to want to do that to Cas again.)
It's Sam who starts asking some of the questions going through Dean’s mind.  "Hey, you okay, man? That looked like it took a lot out of you."
"Room's all ready," Bobby says, grimly, without a greeting—as usual. "Dean, you sure you wanna do this?"
Dean flashes, briefly, to a struggle with a certain warmth—a cocoon of strength—a cool, gentle blue that started out otherworldly but became so, so familiar..
"Isn't everyone in this bar such a darling?" Crowley laughs, and shifts from side to side like he’s square dancing. "You didn't really think those tunes came from
When Castiel blinks, Dean rolls his eyes and gestures impatiently to the inside of his own bedroom, holding the door open.
"Had... lunch?" Crowley crosses himself. Cas squints. Okay, Dean will admit that that gesture’s really bizarre in an actual demon; don’t those guys flinch when someone says ‘Christo?’
Cas isn't fazed, though. "I think your 'boys' bring enough trouble to themselves that way,” he answers, a little wryly. “But... strictly speaking, no. Relationships between humans and angels are not unheard of, just... exceedingly rare. The last I knew of was a century or so ago." His lips crease. "I'm much more likely to be hunted for flouting Heaven's will than that."
“It’s been around sixteen hours since you were exposed to the gas,” Castiel said, checking his watch before looking back at Charlie.
“And what’s that supposed to mean,” Dean said flatly. “All I’ve ever done is give you chances, Cas.”
“You didn’t shoot Anna. Trust me, Charlie hacked into Superbia’s system and I read the incident reports when Jo first suggested we take you in,” said Dean, sounding wary. “Gabe said you were hallucinating after you took those pills in Superbia. Selma told me about all those bad dreams you’ve been having and then Sam put together a theory that you’ve been having a strong mental reaction to whatever Naomi’s been putting into your system. The subconscious rebels, or something. I don’t know, I didn’t study this shit. You’ve been seeing Anna all this time, ‘cause Naomi fucked up your system and I’m guessing she was your way of fighting back.”
“Yeah, we got a deal,” said Dr. Newman. He smiled with a look in his eye that told Castiel he was day dreaming about getting his hands on state technology. Cas had managed to redress himself by the time Dr. Newman broke himself out of it. “Hey, one more thing though.”
“Mandy, girl, what are you doing here? You don’t work until tonight,” came Ellen’s voice from above as Mandy crawled out of the trap door that was located behind the bar. She went silent when she saw Castiel climbing up behind her and that the two of them stayed crouched down behind the bar. “You two nearly gave me a heart attack. Castiel, what are you doing in uniform?”
“You should work on being nicer. Then we can be friends like Aunt Jo and Charlie,” she said happily, looking up at Jo with the kind of admiration that Castiel was sure Jo usually appreciated instead of looking like she was about to have an aneurysm. Castiel was distracted from Jo’s expression of sheer horror when Emma thrust a hand in his face. “Pinky promise?”
Claire spotted them and hurried over, a somewhat recovered Dean struggling to keep up behind her. As soon as he reached them, he grabbed at Cas’ wrist, as if to reassure himself that Cas was actually there. Cas wondered if he would have noticed this as more than just part of Dean’s tactile nature if it were not for Benny telling him just how Dean had reacted to what happened to him at Nowhere Pass.
And then he was gone again, likely off to make sure that everyone he was responsible for was operating smoothly. Castiel stopped watching him leave when Crookshanks pawed at his pants again.
When they got there, everyone leapt into action. Dean pulled over, and checked behind him that Benny had made it before quickly and quietly murmuring a last second set of orders to Charlie and Betty. They nodded seriously and Charlie got to work on their radio and satellite equipment, fingers flying across her portable keyboard and adjusting dials left and right. Jack sat and watched this with rapt attention verging on awe, sullenness forgotten. Jason and Betty took up position to guard Charlie while she worked. Everyone else grouped around Dean similarly defensive.
“If it isn’t sleeping beauty,” said Risa. She was elbowed in the side by Corbett, who proceeded to give Cas a sympathetic look. Castiel knew then that they all had some idea that he had had something of a breakdown the night before. He nodded gratefully at Risa for treating him with normalcy and then walked up to Charlie.
Cas cuts himself off. Jack stops doing his homework, pencil resting on the page as he stares down at it.
Mary finishes drinking her bourbon, looks over at Asa. He shrugs at her, and it’s a relief to see someone else who thinks this whole thing is above their paygrade. Charlie has one ear on the conversation they’re having and one ear on whatever Jo is ranting about when it comes to Sumerian knives. It occurs to Mary they’re all waiting for her response. For her to tell them what she’s going to do, give them a direction to look in.
Castiel was lost in thought as he made his way up to Naomi’s office. Ambriel waved him past, hardly looking up from her work. So that meant Naomi was waiting for him. He doubted that was good.
Mary had insisted on that when she and Bobby had started dating. She’d been worried Bobby’s drinking would influence Sam and Dean into similar behaviors. She was half right.
It wasn’t long until sweat was streaming down his face, and he lifted an arm to wipe off where it pooled on his chin with his sleeve. The steady pounding of his feet was an excellent distraction from everything he’d rather not think about, and it was a long while before he convinced himself to loop back towards the section of Ira that the resistance had claimed for themselves.
“After whatever happens tonight,” says Cas, slow and steady, as if easing Dean into bad news. “I’m going to start looking for a plot of land to buy.”
Castiel didn’t agree, but he kept that to himself. Selma gave him a sideways glance but seemed to be above picking fights with someone who wouldn’t indulge in them. She was wiser than most in that regard. Instead, she gracefully moved on to another subject.
This isn’t Castiel’s fault, for once. He was very careful to contain his work within a small patch of Heaven, testing only whether his solution to a problem Jack hadn’t even figured out existed (that people don’t always like each other, that lasting contentment and true happiness cannot coexist, that Heaven is not a reward and never has been-) would work. As far as she could tell, he had been planning only on seeing whether the change in Heaven’s architecture was viable, and afterwards had likely intended to have Ash determine whether there would be any risks to implementing the change. Of course, he hadn’t planned for Billie to take advantage of his leaving to save Dean Winchester to simply… uncontain the architecture he had been building.
“Why are you trying so hard?” Gabriel asked as soon as Cas had responded. “I’m serious. Stealing medicine is a dumb idea, and you aren’t dumb. At least as far as I’ve been able to tell.”
He didn’t stay long after that announcement. He also didn’t bother acknowledging anyone as he left. Jody frowned after him and Bobby sighed.
“It’s a sobriety thing,” Charlie explained, though the way she said it made it seem like there was a lot more to that story than she was letting on. “Jess and Sam look out for each other.”
Luckily, Jesse, Cesar, Dean, and Benny had been released at this point, or Castiel might actually have tried to shoot out the door in anger and probably gotten himself killed in the process. But it was hard to feel panicked when he finally caught Dean in his line of sight and closing in. Despite everything, despite the bone numbing fear that he was about to die, for a moment nothing mattered but that. The second Dean was within a foot of him, Cas found himself crushing Dean into a bone breaking hug. Dean let out a surprised, slightly strangled laugh.
“Yeah, I do,” said Charlie, excitement ratcheting back up in the time it took for Castiel to blink. Charlie shifted in order to make herself comfortable and went through no small amount of ceremony to find her place on the page and prepare to begin reading, which Castiel knew was Charlie being dramatic for his benefit. “Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways…”
“You’d enjoy that,” Castiel observed, noting that although Sam seemed to be telling him not to, he didn’t look put off by the idea of watching Dean attack him. “I suppose I could provoke him, if you’d find it entertaining.”
“Look who finally decided to show up,” said Dean, already annoyed with him. Charlie elbowed him, but he ignored her. “I sent Jess to get you twenty minutes ago.”
But there is a soft glow of silver light, as Cas lays Dean on the ground and heals him. He touches Dean gently, despite his strength. And the second he lets go, Sam sees the movement of Dean breathing evenly again, and it is all he can do not to collapse in relief. He looks at Cas, who looks back at him placidly. There is a moment where neither of them say anything.
“Desperate times,” Naomi said to him. “Like it or not, you mean something to those rebels. They like you. And in case that wasn’t enough of an incentive, I made sure to include someone else that would catch one ex-prisoner’s attention. It’s the details that sell the story, Castiel.”
“I know what I’m doing,” said Dean. Castiel made a disbelieving noise before he could stop himself and Dean narrowed his eyes. “Zachariah wasn’t going through with this without taking a good chunk of the people causing him trouble anyway. He just would have had to work on his PR a little. Now that sucks, but its a fact of life and not one I want these good people to have to live knowing about.”
For a moment something frantic in her eyes seemed to calm. There was an iron will behind everything Selma was, but maybe she needed to be reminded of that every once in a while. It wouldn’t heal her, but it would keep her going for now.
“Well, not that I’m not sorry to leave the bunker behind,” says Dean. “My very own batcave, Cas, I hope you appreciate how much I love you. Anyway, since we’re gonna need something reasonable, I thought we could rebuild Bobby’s old place in the salvage yard. He left it to me, and I’ve been having Jody keep the records in the clear. I mean it’s under a fake name, but we can figure that out and Bobby’s tool sets are probably all rusting, but I might be able to get away with cleaning them if they’re not too bad, so that’s one way to bring in a little legal revenue-”
“He, uh…” Sam says, gauging Dean’s reaction. “I wondered sometimes. If he… But it’s not like he’s human, so I just sorta figured he was just... like that, y’know?”
“He is sitting here and can hear all of you,” Castiel broke in quietly. He catalogued the different reactions to this statement. Charlie’s half smile of apology, Dean’s sharp shift of attention, Sam’s steady and calculating gaze, and Jo’s half snort. Billie’s expression was unreadable, and Castiel found her gaze the most unsettling. “I understand you don’t trust me. I also understand that that’s the worst thing you can do in this situation. If you think I’m here to harm you, you should get rid of me. If you don’t, I need access to everything. I can’t make informed decisions otherwise, and someone is going to get hurt because of it.”
“That took ten years,” Castiel pointed out. Naomi raised an eyebrow in challenge and Castiel sighed. “I think… perhaps I could make more frequent attempts to make more friends among those of lower rank. It might set them at ease if I seem to have an emotional stake in their wellbeing. And… gossip can be useful source of information.”
Then Dean went back into his cabin, shutting the door behind him, and Castiel tried to figure out what the actual fuck that was supposed to mean.
“If I were you I’d keep real quiet there, Chuck,” says Dean. “Because unlike Eileen, I won’t stop until your face is about as abstract as a Picasso.”
“What is this?” he asks, wishing he could bring himself to turn her away. Wishing that the both of them didn’t already know exactly what is about to happen. “Temptation?”
“Our secret,” he says pointedly. Miracle just wags his tail. Dean ruffles the dumb little guy’s head, and picks up the phone. Claire is calling, so Dean answers without thinking and doesn’t even stop to say hello. “Call Jody’s work phone, kiddo-”
“I’ll drive,” Cas says immediately. He spares a regretful glance for his bed and then squares his shoulders and marches for the car.
“The Mary Winchester? Like burned on a ceiling, became a ghost, was a kickass hunter before she gave it up for love Mary Winchester?” Charlie asks. She pauses after a second. “I’m sorry, that’s kind of intense. And personal. And none of business. Uh, nice to meet you!”
Dean led Castiel and Kelly over to where Dagon and Ramiel were standing. Dagon was smirking at Kelly, and it reminded Castiel of the one time he had seen a bird eat a mouse. There was something smug in her expression that Castiel bristled against. He stepped in front of Kelly to block her from Dagon’s view.
“What part of let me say my piece didn’t you understand the first time? You got your big, damn speech, now let me fucking talk,” says Dean. He stops walking then, and Cas stops retreating a moment after, stuttering to an almost robotic stand still. They’re at the far side of the room, away from the frozen confrontation with the crocotta. It’s almost private, and for whatever reason time is still stuck and it’s not like Billie is showing up to clarify matters, so Dean is gonna lay it out on the line. For whatever that’s worth.
Dean looks up from the book he wasn't looking forward to picking up again. He's not quite sure what comes to his brain first: checking on Sam, or 'what the hell, are you a shapeshifter?'
And on another level, the idea of learning all these new things with Cas, their connection making everything feel warm and intimate and deep in a way that Dean never thought was possible? Having Cas touching him, inside him in pretty much any way? Christ.
That night, Castiel sleeps immediately--sweetly, dreamlessly. He tries to be polite: it’s his last thought before he dozes off, that he really should keep the distance between them.
Sam's other phone catches his eye, sitting just inside his duffel, and it takes seconds to confirm that the bulk of the calls are to Ruby. Great. Dean has no idea what to do with that.
Cas blows out a small breath. "I don't know," he says, carefully. His thumb rubs at Dean's tight, tense joint. "I know it is
Dean gives a second shaky thrust and Cas moans, mouth slipping down to sloppily kiss the bite mark. Yeah, that definitely feels good. Very good. It doesn't take much to find a rhythm that works for them.
Cas seems to focus off on a point in the distance. "I have… memories. I think that’s what they are. They used to be mostly in dreams. Some of them are not… great memories. Of a battle, a great and terrible battle for a single soul—the brightest soul you could imagine. It was the most important task in all of creation."
He sits back down again and watches Cas remove his boots and socks, stuffing the socks into the empty shoes the same way Dean did that night before everything went to hell. Then Cas touches his bare leg. It's not even sexual, but it still takes Dean's breath away: it's gentle and warm, and Cas's fingers run along the slightly swollen lines of his knee so carefully.
Cas shrugs. "Nothing. I'm not sure what happened next." There’s a long pause. “I didn’t have that memory before you touched my arm, though.”
"Like, the Grim Reaper?" Bobby says. Well, at least Dean's not the only one who's tilted sideways by this.
Cas gently thumps his head on the table and groans. "That was one time, and it's absolutely not what you thought it was," he grumbles.
surprised at the next kiss: it's slow, but it's not soft, Cas's tongue dipping in and in and in like he can't get enough of Dean's taste.
So he feels it through every damned inch of him when the fingers Cas has between his legs skirt a little further back from Dean’s taint. Just a little, narrowing down to just the tip of one finger, and the sensation goes from being pressure to, to... he's not even sure what to call it.
Dean curses inside: Sam doesn't know about the angel blade yet, so he wouldn’t know how to distract this Zachariah douche. Though the fact that Tweedledum and Tweedledumber are searching the place for hex bags? Means that hex bags work on angels. That's definitely a thing to keep in mind.
Dean takes a deep breath and slowly withdraws. Cas makes a noise of complaint that Dean shushes with another kiss to his temple. "Just need to load up again, you wanna do that one-handed trick for me?"
He looks at them, between them. "I think that's why the narrative in these stories is… different. In these, I am a soldier of Heaven, a... a tool. Sympathetic to your cause, but ultimately, misguided. As I was for so long."
Dean wonders for a crazy moment what would have happened if they'd just... met. The normal way normal people do. No angels, no apocalypse. No Cas dying in front of him, no demons. Would he have even known to look?
"Cas." His voice cracks. "I- I- want." His lungs tighten and he can't finish, which is fine because he's not sure how to finish.
Sam is still staring at Dean like he's never seen him before. Dean knows it's not actually about Cas's junk, but that little something deeper and much more fundamental about their relationship. Dean can’t exactly blame Sam: Dean’s got Cas’s
Cas is gentle, deliberate and careful about it. He pulls gently to tent up the cloth so it doesn't catch on where Dean's hard in his boxers. But the deliberation in it makes Dean shudder anyway. Especially when Cas's fingertips skim lightly down the bare lines of his hip bones, the boxers at Dean’s thighs still trapping his legs together.
Crowley raises an eyebrow. "Excuse me? Did I not hear correctly, am I not the lynch pin in this operation?"
Dean laughs and pops a bite of lemony, garlicky chicken and follows it up with a spoonful of the best-tasting rice he's ever had. Rice is usually a way to finish the sauce that comes with Chinese takeout. This rice is a whole different world: it’s got enough lemon to brighten up the chicken, some sort of dark smoky spice, and little bits of spinach that Dean is trying to pretend aren’t there even though they’re delicious. But there’s something else. He has to have another bite of it to try and figure out the something fresh that hangs out on the back of his tongue.
Cas, on the other end of the phone line, sighs. "Please take care, Dean. I will be there in precisely fifty nine minutes and thirty two seconds."
Dean's the one who parts them first, but he doesn't let Cas pull back, tugging him back in with the hand he still has in his hair. Their foreheads clunk together, gently.
The ride to the old barn they spotted on the way to the field is completely silent. Not even Ruby smartasses anyone. Which just goes to show, she’s smarter than she lets on, sometimes.
"One second," Cas says, and he breathes out slowly, his entire body relaxing forward and against Dean. Suddenly, his fingers are gliding in like before.
"Okay," Dean says, hoarsely. Shit, he knows he doesn't deserve this. He doesn't deserve this weird, wonderful version of them. "Lie down?"
"You're learning," Tessa says, with a twitch of a smile, and that takes all the triumph out of it. And then she's gone.
Sam backs off, but Dean knows him too well. There's still a suspicious glint in his eyes and Dean bets its name is Ruby, dripping poison into Sam’s ears.
Cas's hand blazes around the edges, and the host's eyes bulge—but even as Dean prepares to watch it go up to angel flame in front of him, it... doesn't.
Sam's cell phone ringing jangles Dean’s nerves more than usual. He checks the time; he knows what that call is. Cas is already standing by the time Sam hangs up.
As the weeks turn into months, the dreams start coming fewer, farther between. They're still so damned clear when they happen, but they happen less and less.
The glow fades from Cas's fingers. She looks better, though her blouse is still torn and there are still bruises scattered over her neck and face. One sleeve of her suit jacket is ripped almost in two, and there's blood staining the sleeves underneath it. But she's not moving like she's bleeding from the inside anymore, and there's no pale, shining trickle at her neck; the arm that a second ago was bent in a way that made Dean's head swim is straight, now.
Dean's hands come up to grip Cas’s hips, and he sneaks his hands tight under Cas's waistband, fumbling for his belt. But once their pants are open, it's like that edge is off the need. They know where this is going. (Sort of.)
Sam's been... what's the term? Groomed for this. Since even before Dean came back from the dead. Hell, the powers that be probably started leaning on Sam then
Cas smiles, just a little, but there's no real joy in it. "I learned that your body is... strong, Dean. Resilient. You don't break easily; you heal even faster. Your reflexes are very good, and the firing of your synapses is fast even by the standards of synapses."
It's not exactly a chore, though, to help Dean make these sounds. Castiel’s own pleasure is secondary for long seconds at a time as Dean slowly comes apart, but it always comes back to him--because Dean
When Sam turns his whole body towards Dean, swinging his legs over like the motion can't be seen from the Space Shuttle, Dean knows that there's going to be a serious set of 'We've gotta talk' incoming. He sighs. Just because this shit has gotten easier—the first time that he and Cas had a bad fight and weren't talking it was
"Sam," Cas says, kindly, and with a little twinkle of amusement. "I may be an angel, but a very poor example of one. Also, I taught grad students at a liberal college. It will be very hard to mortally offend me with talk of doubt in God." He looks at Dean and then back to Sam. "In fact, I think the ability of human beings to balance faith and doubt is one of their more amazing qualities."
Dean chokes, and he actually manages to process something other than the sexy goddamned angel rubbing their cocks together.
Dean goes to Sam, and it almost physically hurts to walk away from Cas without even a hand on his shoulder first. But they need to get going. He doesn't even give Sam a warning before slamming his shoulder back into place. Sam bites back a scream and goes very white, but he nods in thanks anyway. He's dabbing at the head wound himself and Dean can finally turn his attention back to Cas.
"Dunno how this got into my room, buddy, but I'm pretty sure it belongs here," Dean murmurs. "It's nice, though."
Connection, bone-deep and pleasure-sharp, springs up between them. It's more than they need, and more than they've really played around with, but it also communicates more than Dean has ever been able to say out loud.
But now, with Cas's cool hand steady in his, Dean thinks maybe it could be pretty damned exciting with the right guy, after all.
Dean's had a finger pressing into the stretch of his taint before, and it was just fine, really. It was okay, especially when he was really turned on. It was how Dean knew Cas might be into it when it was Dean's turn to try. But it wasn't like being splayed open on his Baby's hood with his toes curling into every motion—as far as he can, anyway, with both legs hooked over Cas's shoulders and his whole body arched open for Cas to touch and taste.
From the way Cas wraps his lips around the head of Dean's still-clothed cock and sucks, his tongue darting right at the brand new wet spot in the cloth like he's trying to taste Dean right through it, he somehow knows it.
Dean's not watching as Sam wipes blood off his face. He's not watching as his brother straightens. He doesn't look up as Sam says, "I'll take them if you and Cas take the other cars."
"No," Dean answers, stubborn. He doesn't know if he's answering the question, or the idea of Cas—weird, dark-voiced Cas—getting offed by penises with wings. "No fucking way that's happening."
The whole family sees them out the door. Dean's had families they've saved that did that, of course. But this is... different, somehow.
Only in these pages, there was no closed door between them. Alastair said them to Dean's face as Dean held up a syringe, a knife, holy water. Alastair laughed and screamed and laughed again as Dean cut and stabbed and sliced.
The sound of wings startles Dean because he didn't feel the pressure change first. There's no nearby weapon in this dream. This dream isn't about that. This is a
Dean rolls his eyes. "For the love of all that--" He breathes out heavily and his shoulders drop. He waves a hand aimlessly at… nothing that Castiel can see. "Just get in the bed. I am too damn tired to do this right now."
So Dean doesn't expect the little flare of hunger that aches in his gut, and he pushes it back down before it can make a damned nuisance of itself. Cas smiles and it's like warmth against his side. His free hand strokes Dean's face slowly, in soft tiny stretches. His fingertips travel down Dean's chin and neck in gentle teases of sensation that skitter down his spine.
Yeah, they will. But right now, they’re still molded together like spoons in a drawer. They’re both warm and shivery and with Cas’s ass still pressed against him as he shifts around, Dean almost, almost thinks he can get hard again.
Cas looks back at them and then goes to the bottom of the pile, to what Dean assumes is the first unpublished manuscript. Cas looks at the title page and raises an eyebrow. "’Lazarus Rising,’" he recites, then shakes his head. “I wonder which this refers to?”
Dean doesn't look over as Sam flips through the sketchbook. The sun is starting to come up, and it's touching the Impala's dash, glaring off the white pages his brother's flipping through. The smell of sulfur from the asylum is still stuck in Dean’s nose. Fuck, that takes
He's not even touching the handprint—for once, he's nowhere near it—so Dean has no explanation for why just talking about the thing is making his left arm tingle all the way to the tips of his fingers. Maybe it's because Cas is down at his breastbone now, placing little kisses down the bone like dropping warmth all the way down Dean's chest. He hasn't lifted away, so Dean's cock is starting to say hello right at the smooth, flat line of Cas’s chest.
Dean’s set up a beach umbrella, now. It was a lot harder than he thought; who knew that the damned things had to be screwed into the sand, and the deep layer of the sand had to be firm enough to support it without it blowing away? In the end, after they got giggled at by some kids, their mom came over and gave them a hand. He and Sam set up the beach chairs under it, and Cas lugged over the cooler. It had Coronas and cut limes inside.
"Dean," Cas murmurs, right into Dean's shoulder. "Oh, my Dean, you are so perfect." He kisses gently into the center of it, then scrapes his teeth over the whole palmprint.
"Read for more?" he asks, not sure if he actually is, himself, but willing to give it a good try anyway.
"Will never trouble anyone again, in this existence or the next," Cas answers, smoothly, before Dean has to. "It wasn't an idle threat when I said I don't need an ancient knife to wipe their like out of existence."
in a way he couldn't when he was on top before: the way Cas's cock dips and jerks as Dean settles deeper inside him, the tension of his belly as he holds himself straight, the little quiver that shakes through Cas's shoulders and the way his head tips back on his shoulders like it's too heavy to hold up when Dean bottoms out.
There's a swell and a crest of pleasure starting at the soles of his feet. Cas swallows his sounds with a deep, biting kiss. Dean's holding on for dear life, arms locked around Cas's neck, one of his legs pressing and working along Cas’s cock, knowing this roller coaster ride is just about to make its big finish.
They get into it, about Ruby and the phone calls, Sam’s shady and secretive actions, until finally Sam hits back with his own list of accusations.
Cas lets him go, briefly, something happening that involves a little bit of wiggling just out of Dean's line of sight, and then he's being covered by something warm and familiar-smelling. Rather than pulling up the blanket, Cas has wrapped them in his trench coat. It's his second favorite thing to do with that trench, apparently.
Dark eyelashes flutter as Cas peeks at him over his shoulder with one blue eye. "Oh," he mumbles, sounding sheepish. "That came out wrong." He scrunches up his nose in a manner that's so damned cute that Dean wants to kiss it. So he does. "You know what I mean."
The feel of a thin dribble of room-temperature lube being poured over both their cocks would make Dean arch off the bed if his legs weren't already pinned under Cas's weight.
Of all the things, that seems to stop Crowley, briefly. He squints in Cas's direction before widening his attention back to all four of them. "Well, let's get on with it, lads. Chop chop, what’s your question, there's an orgy somewhere I'm sure I need to be a part of."
Cas's thumb strokes back and forth across the center of the palm-print, his mouth leaving small sucking kisses up and down the curve of Dean's neck. Dean thinks about getting a hand between them, give them both something to push into that's not just the slip and slide of their bellies. No sooner has he thought it than Cas groans against his throat. "Yes, please. Do that, please."
Jimmy’s the one who mutters, “‘Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some have unwittingly entertained angels.’" Dean’s not really sure who he’s saying it to.
There's a little tickle in the back of Dean's head that's saying that maybe he should ask Cas what exactly he means by 'what heaven wanted from you,' because as far as he knows, Cas hasn't said anything like that before. He's always said that he doesn't know how Dean fits into the plan. Something changed.
Still, the shaky breath he takes in the bathroom, hands on the sink, bent over and feeling a little sick, is what gets them their second shared shower. He doesn’t know how Cas realized what was happening, but he feels the gentle pressure of a hand on a small of his back, lips resting against his shoulder. Dean doesn’t even have the energy to grumble at him for following him into the damned bathroom.
"There's something wrong," Cas says quietly. He doesn't ask; it’s not a question. He doesn't make Dean speak. "I can tell—and I know that must feel unsettling for you, how often I know these things—but I like knowing how you’re feeling. If that's okay with you?"
Cas wiggles again, then shivers, hand on Dean's ribs tightening briefly. "Yes," Cas rumbles. "Just one thing to fix." He hums briefly and Dean feels the telltale disappearance of drying come off his stomach. He'd object more, but Cas leaves everything else: sweat, spit, a little stickiness. It doesn't take away from the experience, it just means they don't have to awkwardly clean up, with Dean’s limbs like a newborn foal's. Or accidentally fall asleep and glue themselves together.
“Yeah I’m glad you’re okay too,” says Sam. Another thump in the trunk distracts him from what he wants to do then, which is kiss Eileen stupid. Especially considering she looks like she wants to do about the same thing to him. Still, they should probably get going back to the bunker. Honestly kidnapping Chuck wasn’t a terrible idea, because clearly something is happening. Sam doesn’t like the odds of him and Dean surviving another couple of attempts on their lives. There’s only so many times you can get lucky with that kind of thing. Sam knows that from experience. Speaking of Dean… “Hey, did you tell Dean that I-?”
Dean forgot how sarcastic Cas could be. The familiarity of it is a punch to his gut and he’s never liked Cas more than he does right now. Never hated him more either.
“She qualified for leadership,” confirmed Tamara bitterly. “They test at seven in Ira. They took her away when she was seven years old. Isaac and I thought she went missing. No one told us anything for months, and when someone finally got around to it, they told us congratulations. Our daughter was serving the state, and weren’t we so proud? She’s twenty now, and for all I know she doesn’t even remember me.”
So John Winchester had pretended he was defecting with his two sons and gone to the city of Acedia. After that, no one knew much, excepting perhaps Charlie and Jo (neither of which was likely to share something the Winchesters didn’t want them to). All that was certain was that sixteen years later, John was dead, Dean came back to the resistance, and Sam didn’t. In fact, Sam had apparently been quite a prominent scientist in Acedia for the state. Jess and Cordy had been working at the same facility as he was, but something had happened while they were there and it had ended with the three of them burning the place to the ground and Sam reaching out to his brother for the first time in years. Selma had only just joined when this happened, and she said it was a lot like when Castiel had first come, except worse because something had been very wrong with Jess and Sam when they had gotten there. Whatever it was, and Selma said officially no one knew and she certainly never found out, it had only increased suspicions in camp, especially when it came to Gordon and Kubrick.
“Mom,” Dean says, finally turning to look at her. But her arms are crossed and her eyes are steely. She’s not budging. “I’ve got the flu or something-“
Castiel looked up. They were nice, he thought to himself. And not something he would have thought to look at had it not been pointed out to him.
Though thinking about it again, he definitely should have told Eileen. Or at least in retrospect, he’s realizing he probably should have because… Oh god, Eileen thinks he’s dead. She must, right? The spell takes a few hours to activate, and again, Sam isn’t entirely sure he even did it right. It might be days since he died. He doubts it’s longer than that, or the fact that no one had bothered to burn his body might hurt his feelings a little. Sure, not like he expected them to try nothing to bring him back, but by the time decomp had set in well… you’d think they would have at least buried him instead of left him under the funny smelling tarp they kept folded up in the Impala’s trunk for impromptu (and usually hunting related) camping purposes.
First, they set off a bright light once the garrison guarding Castiel had exited the building, briefly blinding everyone who had been looking in that direction, which included Castiel. Afterwards, there was a series of thuds as Castiel tried to blink his vision back to normal. Then a familiar voice made him go almost weak at the knees.
For once, Jack doesn’t back down when Cas yells at him. Instead he keeps staring straight at Cas like he’s disappointed with what he sees. It hurts more than Cas was expecting. Perhaps he’d grown more used to having someone look at him like he was a hero than he should have.
“I am defending myself,” said Castiel, finally feeling himself break through the strange fugue of awful emptiness. Finally able to remember the things Garth and Dean and Selma and Jo had told him, about being worth something. As a dearly loved friend, as an ally, as a person. “I have done things for the people I love that you could never imagine. I… I withstood torture, I turned my back on everything I knew to do the right thing, I risked whatever sanity I had left in my attempts to leave the world a better place than I found it. I am not selfish. We are not the same.”
The thought of Dean in a soldier’s uniform was like looking through distorted glass. Cas felt ill thinking about it.
Kelly Kline was staring at him. He stared back in utter shock. She looked healthier than she had in Ira. Her cheeks had filled out, and her skin had lost its pallor. She had something of a glow to her even, and Cas was even more shocked when he saw the way her belly was gently curving outward. Kelly opened her mouth as though to say something, but Castiel shook his head at her.
The two of them discussed what they knew about Ira from their experiences until Charlie showed up to interrupt them and announce it was time to drink their worries away. As expected, they did right downstairs in Harvelle’s.
“I’m not supposed to talk to you,” Emma said confidentially, but still much too loudly to be much of a secret. “None of us are. Why’s that?”
The amount of people watching him also began to lessen as time went on, so either something serious was happening and Castiel had been demoted to a second tier threat, or perhaps he had proven himself to be so inept at physical activity after spending a week on the verge of dying that his current pathetic-ness had outweighed whatever threat they thought he posed before.
“You drugged me with Sweet Dreams,” Castiel countered. “The unaltered version, I assume. You risked my sanity and the sanity of everyone else you’ve ever drugged with it.”
“No, duh,” she said. “I mostly swing the other way, if you know what I mean. But, hey, when you look like the way I do and men are reliably lust driven idiots, you take your advantages where you can get them. And it’s not like I wouldn’t have taken advantage, if you’d ever shown any interest. Tall, dark, and handsome is a good look on anyone. I just kinda figured we played for different teams.”
“Lydia hates everyone,” Dean reasoned. Benny made a grudging grunt of agreement, while everyone else remained suspiciously silent on the matter. Castiel gathered that this Lydia was for some reason or another, a touchy subject. “And would you rather I move Kubrick?”
When he walked out of the supplies cabin, it was to find Jo standing in front of the door. Cas came to a stand still, knowing he was caught red handed and desperately searching for some explanation that Jo would actually believe.
“I kind of think you’re not sure which side you’re on either,” said Meg. The elevator dinged as it reached it’s destination and Castiel stepped out of it quickly. Meg stopped him by reaching out to grip his arm and looked him in the eye. “Just remember what you’re going to be losing, before you do anything stupid. I remember what it was like being in a garrison. You have a chance to get that back. Don’t blow it”
Charlie took his hand and pressed the two pills into them. Now resting on Castiel’s palm were two small invitations to complete loss of agency. Loss of control and surrender to the enemy. He let them rest a minute on his palm, gathering his courage before swallowing the both of them.
Dr. Newman nodded, as though he had been expecting that. He patted Castiel gently on the arm and then sat on the chair next to him, face careful.
“Yes, well,” says Cas, looking away from the screen, a feeling of profound uncertainty filling him. “Neither am I.”
It’s a few days before Dean is cleared to leave the hospital. At first, Sam isn’t even allowed to visit him, and the nurses side eye him as he resolutely parks himself in the waiting room. Eileen has to talk him down over text from just trying to sneak into the actual hospital area and figure out what the fuck is going on.
Dean stops with the cheesy little fried bite halfway to his mouth. Okay, maybe Dean's not stupid enough, but apparently someone forgot to put Castiel in line when God was handing out self-preservation.
Dean looks up and forces his hands not to turn the pages in his hands into paper mache. "You know her?"
Cas ducks his chin and kicks some small piece of junk away with the tip of his shoe and that's when Dean realizes he said it out loud.
Dean gapes, then crosses his arms back at Cas, fighting back a smile. "That's it, I'm returning you for a less sassy angel."
All of a sudden, Dean understands. He gets why Jimmy looked at him like that, like he isn't sure Dean's good enough for Cas. Like he's not sure he wants Dean anywhere near his brother.
Dean follows swiftly behind as Cas makes a beeline for the front door, and charges through it without so much as pausing. Cas lets out a worried "Anna!" before Dean can even see what's happened.
