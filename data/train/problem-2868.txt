“Castiel Milton,” she croons at the mere sound of his voice.
“No, no, please. I won’t.” The tears start back, and all at once, he remembers his panic attack at ten over cops and robbers with Dean. Dean had been the hero, as always, but Cas had been the bad guy he’d tied up instead of the partner who usually helped him. Cas had panicked and stopped breathing, and Dean had hugged him after he’d freed him, apologizing profusely again and again, refusing to relinquish his hold on Cas. Castiel swears Dean never really forgave himself for that. “Please, I won’t fight.” Castiel hiccups, tears falling as he tries to breathe around the restraints. The one around his breasts is the most problematic. It is constricting his lungs, confining his airways, closing his throat against the oxygen. His mind is attacking him, telling him that the straps are tighter than they are, that they are harming him more than containing him. “Please,” he gasps, tears falling down his face. April’s eyes narrow, but he is too focused on the air barely moving through his lungs to plead more.
“Daddy,” Emma asks softly when they are alone in the car. “Does Mommy hate me?” Dean’s throat closes up a little.
“Winchester…” Cas mimics, barely able to get it out.
“If you tell a soul, I will
“He’s gorgeous,” he murmurs finally, consciously aware that the last thing he needs is for Dean to over hear him gushing. Charlie nods slowly.
“Boy, what do you think you’re doing?” the man asks, raising an eyebrow at Dean. Dean snaps his head up, turns four shades of red, and stands immediately.
“Traitor,” Charlie snaps, pulling open her bedside drawer and taking a picture out.
"Did you love her?" he asks, and the look of confusion on Dean's face deepens. "Just trust me, Dean. Did you love her?"
“Sure thing, bug,” Dean says after clearing his throat and turning his thoughts away from Cas. He reads with Emma until Lydia shows back up, wearing that dress Dean swears he likes with lips painted pristinely.
he thinks, making his way to the living room and slumping into the armchair.
“Shhh, Dean. I was never angry. I wasn’t even hurt, really. Sad, maybe, but
he means. “I love you,” he says, but Cas understands.
“I just mean that Benny had his head angled completely wrong, and the audience could see that you weren't reallly kissing.” Cas sighs again.
“Just go,” she calls after him, but he is already out the door. He spots Cas near the highway, ready to walk back to his car and back to his life in Kansas.
They are brown, sometimes gold. Castiel draws in a slow and deep breath.
“Okay,” Cas murmurs finally, reaching out and brushing his thumb over Dean’s stubble, and that is the end of it. When Cas returns to his motel room later that night, he begins looking for apartments. He does not want to be separated from Dean, and if Dean doesn’t want him to go, he’ll stay.
“Would you like living just with your dad sometimes?” Judge Mills looks concernedly down to her, but Emma just grins excitedly.
“Yeah, so did I,” he teases, squeezing Cas’ shoulder with a grin.
Hi everyone, just wanted to let you all know that there may be several things in this chapter that are triggering to some. Cas' rape is mentioned a good deal, along his struggle getting through that, and this chapter is the reason for the tag "Terminal Illness," (Not Cas or Dean). I just wanted to give everyone a heads up.
When he reaches that old house on Sceadan street, he expects to find his mother the same as when he last saw her, chunky, covered in too much make-up, self-righteous grin. Granted, it has been nearly six months since he has last seen her, and Gabe said she had faded quickly. When he opens the front door—didn’t bother knocking—he finds her sitting at the dining table, pictures spread out before her. She looks up when he enters, and Cas looks down to the pictures.
“Lost my job. Thought I’d take a crack at bumming.” Cas snorts again.
When he finally gets to take her home, he cradles him to her and points to her every room, every new face. He shows her the sculpture, the one that brought him back to Dean, and she is fascinated by the lifelike clay before her.
“What about me?"
“Holy shit,” Dean mutters when he’s gone. “Getting caught is not as hot as I was expecting.”
“Hey, Sammy,” he says, stepping forward because he doesn’t want to play games anymore. “Are you two ready to go?”
, and no son of mine is gonna be queer!”
“No,” he replies, and she drops her eyes. They stand in silence for a moment, Charlie fumbling for a way to console him and Cas too trapped by his thoughts to notice.
“Sure,” he says, glancing over at her.
“Can the next dance be a Cassie-daughter dance?” she asks, reaching a hand out to pat Cas’ leg. Cas swallows back his happiness and nods.
“That’s big brother talk for ‘anything for you, baby bro,’” he says, and Cas grins.
clinic?”
“Oh, fuck you,” Dean shouts, fishtailing and spinning across the banana peel his little brother threw at him. Sam laughs and crosses the finish line ahead of Dean for the sixth time that night. “Whatever,” Dean grumbles, tossing the steering wheel to the couch and standing. “I’m going outside.”

“I just gave you this card, Dean. I know what it says,” Cas replies, his patience slowly leaving him as his spirit falls.
for an explanation. What the
“Thank you, Bobby,” Dean says, stopping behind his chair and laying a hand on his shoulder. “I know it seems like we’re ungrateful little prats now, but we really do appreciate what you’ve done for us. If there’s anything we can ever do to return the favor…” Dean trails off. Bobby doesn’t seem like he’s hearing them anyway. Dean knows the feeling.
Damn right REO.
“You’re going to go with your
“What the fuck is this?” he asks, his voice low and deadly as he holds the papers out to Cas. “What the fuck is this?” he shouts, shaking them so violently in Cas’ face that a few of them fall to the floor, and Cas sees that it is a collection of
“Christ, I’ve missed you,” he says, tears lining his eyes at the fact that she is real and here and alive.
Dean. “I swear, if you went through all that just to die now…”
“Please, Dean. It’s going to break.” Dean can hear the terror rising in Cas’ voice.
Again, Cas received a standing ovation, to which he stood, bowed, and winked down at Dean. Dean, beneath the pride of seeing Cas,

“Spit it out, Cas,” Dean says teasingly, a gentleness in his face.
ask Cas to marry him, they’d been back home in Kansas, visiting Cas’ mother. She had apologized to Dean, profusely, honestly, and it wasn’t really enough. He still didn’t forgive her for what she did to Cas, but Cas did, so Dean cut her a break. They didn’t go see John while they were there, but they did make a trek out to their old treehouse. The years had grown the trail up, made the wood of the actual house precarious to stand on. Their beanbag chairs had been covered in dust and pine straw and disuse. They still loved the place, and as they took a seat out on their little balcony, staring out at the creek that has remained the same even with all the years and all the moments, Dean decided that he had had quite enough of this slowness. He wrapped an arm around Cas’ waist and pulled him close. Silence passed, contentedness.
“I never told,” Cas starts, but Naomi keeps right on.
“No, smartass. I’m bisexual,” Dean counters, watching as everything drops off Lisa’s face. Her arms come up to cross over her chest.
Cas writes Dean letters. Long ones, short ones, ones about Charlie, ones about Lucifer. He writes to Dean how much he misses him. He begs him not to give up. He never gets a response, and by week two, he is becoming slightly discouraged.
getting what she deserves.”
“Did you go home last night?” she asks, putting a cup of coffee into his hand. He takes an absent sip before setting it beside the untouched cup she gave him last night.
“No, of course not. That’s different.” He can see Jess flustering.
Cas is a cuddler. The nerd. The moment lasts for a small eternity, Cas curled perfectly against Dean’s side like he doesn’t belong anywhere else and Dean holding him tight like he wouldn’t allow him to be anywhere else anyway. Dean reaches over and takes a handful of tissues and wipes his stomach off, offering some to Cas to clean his hands before tossing them in the garbage can by Cas’ bed for later disposal. Then, he pulls Cas tight to him again and pretends the rapid cadence of his heart is just from the sex.
“Yeah, because I have a whole lot of reasons
He asks for Dean.
“I start with broad licks, you know. Spread her legs wide and dive right in, licking her open until it’s more than spit slicking the way. I may suck a little here and there, just to—”
“Well yeah. It’s hard for me to talk about her…” Dean shrugs and tries to shake away the feeling of sadness rising up in him at the thought of her.
"Well, yes. I knew we couldn't do this 'friends with benefits' stuff forever. I've seen the movies. It was either going to end here," Cas pauses to kiss Dean, and when he pulls away, his eyes are incredibly sad as he thinks of the other possibility. "Or with us apart, and I mean really apart. I think I was just trying to figure out if I would ever be happy without you."
Cas blinks. He is here. He is here. He is parked in front of that old house built of a million memories, thirteen years of brotherhood, one endless Autumn of passions, and ten years of wasted time. Cas’ heart slams wildly in his chest.
It’s the thought that, if this
“Sell it.”
“Jesus, Cas. You’re really gonna make me say it?” Dean pulls in a deep breath and lets it out in a rush, voice shaking with the terror of losing him. “I fucked her, okay. She came rubbing up on me cause it’s my birthday, and I guess I was feeling nostalgic and vulnerable because I
“How do you manage to stay strong?” Cas asks, teasing banter gone from his words with the very real warning Charlie is offering. She smiles a bit and motions her head over her shoulder.
” Dean says with a roll of his eyes and a bite to his voice. Cas cuts him a sideways glance, too consumed to even spare him a full glare. Lisa’s hand creeps further up his leg.
“Back the fuck up,” he spits, and she reels away, eyes wide.
story as a bedtime story,” he had explained with a shrug, allowing Cas to raise his eyebrow before kissing him softly. “She told me I shouldn’t let you walk away, so I didn’t.” He tugged Cas even closer, but he did not miss the grin Cas tossed his way.
Dean’s hands clench around the wheel.
“Hey, Cas," Dean calls, sidling up to Cas and leaning close. "Wanna go to a party tonight?"
“What’s a pirate’s favorite letter?”
He is an elderly man walking down the street with his husband.
"Look, lady," Dean starts, sitting up and cocking his head at her. "You don’t know anything about my life or what he’s put Sam and me through."
“She’s so beautiful,” Sam murmurs finallly, and Dean nods.
“But in the car…?” Dean trails off, the world swinging around him from the alcohol and from the dried tears and, frankly, from how close Cas’ lips remain to his. He never wants to be further from them than this.
“I’ll bring you boys the regular,” she says softly, and Dean thanks her, hoping she knows he means for more than the birthday wishes and food. She merely nods, and Sam and Dean make their way to the back table, Dean’s bones aching with every step. Sam sits across from Dean with his eyes cast down, and they exist in that silence for what feels like am eternity.
To top off his considerably shitty day, he fails a test that he actually studied for, and with a very small amount of debate, he elects to ditch class and go the fuck home. When he gets there, he elects to ignore his dad’s drunken ramblings and instead, to sit and to play Mario Kart until it’s time to pick Sam up. Sam, of course, is bouncing when he gets in the car, going on and on about a test he aced, and Dean sinks lower into his funk. He decides then that the only thing he needs is the solitude of the treehouse that Dean and he-who-shall-not-be-named built.
“I know,” he says simply. “It was something, wasn’t it, Cas? We were something.”
called
“Of course it means shower blow jobs,” Cas assures, turning back to the road with a smile.
“Well damn.” Dean offers Cas a grin, and what can Cas do but smile back? “You’re a pretty cool guy, Cas.”
“Dean here has been taking good care of me,” she tells him, smiling over at Dean. Cas turns around and looks at Dean.
“Is he…fornicating with a woman?” She hisses, slamming the door behind her and stepping towards Cas’ room. Clothes line the way, but crumpled on the ground in their hurried liberation, whether they are a male’s clothes or a female’s clothes cannot be discerned. Anna knows. She knows the leather jacket, and the worn boots. She knows the faded plaid and the large socks.
take care of us. Always have.” Sam smiles a small smile and ducks his head. “We’re gonna be fine,” Dean promises, ruffling Sam’s hair teasingly. Sam smiles, broader this time, but as soon as he sees Dean’s eyes flick away, the smile slips away.
Cas swipes an angry arm across his face then scoffs.
“Hell yeah,” Dean says and starts to walk away.
“I would not argue with you on that.”
This chapter is the reason for the rape/non-con warning... Just thought I'd give you a bit of a heads up.
Dean blinks and finds himself staring into Ellen’s eyes, her lips quirked up in a confused grin. He realizes she has probably been speaking to him for quite a while. He clears his throat and looks around the table. The rest of the dinner party has eyes on him also.
to Cas.
“I was really wanting you to meet Emma," Dean says, putting his hands in his pockets and looking around. He is nervous, caught up in his thoughts.
“Castiel Milton,” Cas says, still looking at Dean. Dean’s mouth hangs open, and Cas tries to tell him how sorry he is just by the look in his eye. What Cas doesn’t see, however, is Lydia’s hushed and frantic conversation with her lawyer.
“I’m hungry, daddy,” Mary says, turning and pulling gently at his ears like she sometimes does when she wants attention.
with Cas. He wants more than the sex and more than the friendship. He wants Cas in his laughter and Cas in his joy and Cas in his grumpy mornings and his lazy afternoons and his sleepless nights. He wants Cas, and he wants Cas to want him back.
to step forward, Emma pokes her little head in and speaks loudly and confidently.
and worth the fight. He even manages to sing a little on the way, tell Charlie that he’ll be to their meeting in an hour, and when he gets to Dean’s house, he finds Dean sitting on the front steps, arms curled around knees and a cigarette in hand. He does not look up when Cas parks, gets out of the car, and approaches him. Even so, Cas approaches and sits next to him. Cas wraps an arm around Dean’s waist and tugs him close, pushing the coffee he bought him into his hand.
So is Dean.
Even when he has to tell Dean goodbye, he knows it is not forever. Goodbye has never been permanent for them; even the first one, the big one. Dean however, Dean is not convinced that if he even lets Cas out of his sight, he’ll return. The first goodbye, the big one, left Dean scarred and crippled. He clings to Cas too tightly, but Cas does not mind. He clings right back.
The guilt is even worse than
“Stop it. That isn’t what I mean, and you know it.” Cas looks down to Mary. “Don’t you think it will be confusing for her?”
“Risk what?”
“Something like that,” Cas allows. He swallows back the rest of his whiskey, then grimaces. “I have no idea how you drink this. It is incredibly unpleasant.”
the point,
“Are you okay?” they ask, and of course, they mean physically.
Dean thinks idly, taking in the sharp contrast of his blue eyes to the deep, rich purple of his shirt Dean is so caught up in the disarray of Cas’ hair that he misses his response. “What?” he asks, hoping he can blame his slip on the music, though it is considerably quieter in the kitchen than the living room.
Dean.
“You want…”
“It’s just…I know the couch isn’t very comfortable, and I know you ha—” Then Dean is close and pressing his lips to Cas’ softly, gently, exactly as Cas said he liked to be kissed, and the words get lost somewhere between the two.
“No, no. You’re perfect,” he tells her, taking her hand in his and bringing it to his lips. “I think I’m just too stressed.”
“Bobby, damn it! You can’t just push into my house and demand that I let you stay here,” John half-shouts, but he sounds more irritated than angry.
“He liked grown-up movies.”
“Guess so…” he murmurs, and Cas offers him a sad smile.
Dean doesn’t see Cas again until later that night. He and Sam sit in the living room playing Mario Kart (Dean is just letting Sam win so the little bitch won’t cry), and John is dead to the world, passed out in his bedroom.
Eventually, after they have seen the city, eaten the food and swallowed the coffee (because Cas is cliché as fuck), their day comes to an end, and Dean is left with a cold question aching in chest.
“He needs you here to support him, Cas,” Sam says, leaning forward and pressing a hand to the counter beside Cas’.
“What? Why?” she asks, leaning back so that they are no longer pressed together.
“So, I tried calling you,” Lisa says instead, her voice quiet so it’s clear the conversation is just between the two of them. Lisa
Cas looks up at him, and the sharpness in his eyes softens.
“Dad, when he said Mom would be disappointed…She wouldn’t be. She would be proud of you. She would be glad you found someone who makes you happy.” Sam offers Dean a smile, one that Dean tries to return around the tears that
the basis of his shit day. His tire had finished a long winded leak of air on his way home this afternoon, and because his spare was already on his front right and he was still many,
“It has been far too long, big brother,” she murmurs into his shirt, and Cas knows. It has likely been seven months. The past ten years shoved a wedge between Castiel and his siblings. But now,
"Some other time," Cas replies easily, stepping a bit closer.
“You need pants!” Cas looks down to see that she is right, he is still wearing only his boxers. He laughs a giddy laugh and runs back to his room, stumbling around as he tries to run and pull his pants and shoes on. By the time that he’s dressed, he emerges from his room to find Jess ready too, hair pulled back in a quick braid, pajamas replaced by sturdy jeans and a cream sweater that makes her blonde hair and blue eyes look lighter than they are.
“Sure you did, Cas,” Gabe says, stopping and turning back to Cas with an unreadable look. “You were confused, brainwashed, convinced it was wrong, so you broke up with him, told him to go. I’m sure he didn’t agree to that easily, so you had to say what you had to say to get him to leave. You needed to hurt him to make him leave, and I get it. I get it, really, I do, but don’t say you didn’t mean to hurt him, because you did.” Gabe’s voice is not angry. He is not being harsh; he is not being cruel, but by the time he finishes, Cas is holding back tears again.
“Yeah, well at least they were here! At least I
“You really loved that boy didn’t you?” she asks softly, and Cas blinks his way into a smile.
to be with me!” Dean turns, eyes blown wide as he takes in Cas’ anger.
"So when you began the affair you were having, why didn't you just leave Lydia and be with your partner?" Dean's face clears, and Cas can tell he understands, even if none of the rest of them do.
“No,” Dean says, sitting up and looking to the voice. She’s very pretty.
“What?!” Dean groans. “I dunno if you noticed, but it was kind of a hard night for me, too.”
“I’ll be back tomorrow, Emmie,” he promises, and at the words, she springs away, her pinky outstretched.
“Did you not want a Vonnegut?” Lisa asks, pushing her hair back from her face concernedly.
“No, but Lisa’s coming. I figure she’ll want to hang out after,” Dean says with a shrug. Cas smiles, but Dean doesn’t like the look of it.
“You’re smart,” he says softly, running his fingers through her soft child-like hair. “But they couldn’t kiss forever. They had talked for so long earlier that by the time Dan finally kissed Clarence, Dan had already missed dinner with his family, and they were calling worried about him. So they went back to Dan’s family, and seeing Clarence with Dan’s wife, well, it made him realize that it was wrong, being with Clarence when he has a family and a home and people who love him.”
” Naomi spits, interrupting Charlie's verbal porno. Cas watches at least half the girls in the room shift, crossing their legs a bit tighter than necessary. “You are dismissed from group.” Charlie whoops and stands.
Dean’s sure his breath smells like whiskey. He kisses Cas anyway, presses into his mouth until he sighs his lips open, and when their tongues meet, it’s all he can do to keep his every thought from scattering in the wind. He pulls away with a gasp, an ache in his chest from so long breathing in the cold and from going so long without this love he’s craved all his life.
“Good,” Cas whispers, right as the world slips away from Dean.
. He should not be so broken, but here he is, holding back sobs over Dean. He is grieving Dean like he has died.
“There was nothing left for me,” he says finally, fingers still in Cas’ hair.
“Dean!” Cas yelps, tears welling in his eyes and hands reaching for Dean.
As they wait for her, Dean fixes coffee, and Cas tells him who Charlie is to him.
of hurting Dean. “I just want to make things right with him.” Sam takes him in slowly, from his two-day-old rumpled suit, to his shaking hands, and up to his bloodshot eyes.
“Yes, but I don’t mind,” he says, shrugging and threading his fingers together. Dean wonders in passing if it’s okay for boys to hold hands with themselves.
“Thank you,” Dean said softly, and Cas had smiled.
“I’m so sorry,” she repeats, thumb brushing his cheek as much as she can manage with his hand clenched around hers. “That was before I knew. I just wanted what I thought was best for you, just wanted you to have a happy, normal life.”
kiss, the single, solitary, most heart-wrenching kiss in the whole play was staged!” Cas sighs and runs a hand through his hair.
“I wanted you to be happy when you came home,” he says, voice small and sheepish.
“So hold on to that. You’re going to be fine without me, and if not, just give me a call." She smiles at him, all teeth and crinkled eyes before she pulls him close and buries herself in his neck. “Thanks for being awesome,” she whispers, and when she pulls away, he swears he sees tears in her smiling eyes.
"There is no jury here," she says, reaching her hand out for the packet Lydia's lawyer is holding.
“Of course, Dean.”
“So he wants to change his name?” Anna asks, confusion riding into her voice. Her mother shouldn't be so mad about Raphael wanting to change his name.
“I know funny jokes! Wanna hear one?”
“Thank you,” Cas says with small smile, because he doesn’t know what else to say. He never does. At least now he knows where he knows her from…Dean’s funeral. The thought makes him ache. “I miss him every single day, but I’m ready to take the next step in taking my life back.”
“Yeah, but you missed waffles!” She says excitedly, pulling back to grin at him.
be able to sign her out and see her for just a moment.
and so on into eternity. Cas pushes his door open and stands tall.
“Do you even remember your combination?” Cas asks with an incredulous scoff. Dean shrugs.
” Cas groans with a little more force before turning and pulling the door open. He makes his way towards the living room, the beginnings of a headache starting behind his eyelids. When he breaks into the room, he is met by Dean staring darkly at him. Cas’ eyes drop back down the length of Dean’s body, only to find him absolutely bare. “Uh,” Cas starts, his face heating as he averts his eyes.
and your
“Yes. I have,” Dean says, eyes suddenly dark, and Cas blinks.
“Because I fucking love you, okay!?” Cas shouts. His chest heaves, his words hang heavy between them around the stares of the people watching. “It’s been ten goddamn years, and
“Yes, please let me in. My arms are getting tired.” Dean scrambles onto the foot of his bed, and opens his window, even going so far as to help pull Cas in to save him from hanging there much longer. His window isn’t too high, but he knows from experience that crawling through it can be hard, especially for someone little like Cas.
“I’ll deal with this myself,” she says eventually, turning on her heel and stomping off towards the front door. Cas watches her for a long moment, half of him jutting his chin up and refusing to give her the reaction she clearly wants.
“You didn’t tell me you had company, Castiel,” a woman says, and Dean turns to see a tall lady with reddish brown hair and a tight smile.
“You’re staying, right?” Dean asks. He really tries not to sound desperate. Really. He does.
not the other way around.” Her fiery eyes drop a bit, but Cas just smiles. “I know you love me, Anna, and I love you, but I love him too. We’re all trying, doing everything we know to do to make a bad situation better.” Anna drops her eyes, and Cas, seeing that he’s won, kisses her cheek.
But Dean, he wants more than a silver-dollar sureness. He wants to see it. Needs to see it. He stands there under the buzzing neon of a backalley bar, and he pushes down the lump in his throat, wondering if the shifter is gonna change right in front of him.
“Thanks, Bela,” he says, and when he looks up, he sees a predatory smile on her lips as she sinks onto the bench beside him, her fingers still rubbing through his hair. Bela Talbot, British foreign exchange student, two-time ex of Dean’s, promiscuous extraordinaire. There have been times when Bela was a very appealing prospect to Dean. He liked her hair. He liked her accent. He liked her boobs. So he’d dated her, but it was less dating and more unattached sex. Apparently that was Dean’s thing before Cas.
“Come eat. I made breakfast.” So Cas puts the sign aside and makes his way into the kitchen to share a meal with his mother. She has cooked pancakes, and Cas eats them slowly, chewing mechanically even though they are the same fluffy, delicious delight from his childhood. The ache is too big to fill with yummy pancakes.
Dean doesn’t have the energy to point out that he obviously hadn’t been
“Mmm, do tell,” Dean says with a grin.

“Dean? What’s wrong?” he asks, voice immediately concerned. Dean shakes his head.
“Does he still love Clarence?” she asks finally and yawns again.
Winchester, am I correct in saying that you are asking for a divorce and full custody of your and Mr. Winchester’s child?”
“Dean, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me,” he chants, fingers holding tight to the sheets and spreading wider for Dean. Dean has three fingers inside of him, brushing against his prostate again and again.

, and she can’t.” Dean sighs and stands. “You want a coffee?” he asks, and she nods. He leaves the booth immediately. "Two coffees please. Oh, and could you grab Ellen for me?" he asks the guy behind the counter. He says nothing, instead pours the coffees and disappears into the back to get Ellen. She comes out almost immediately, a grin spread across her lips.
“Took you long enough,” Dean says, but Cas barely hears him over the roar in his ears as he sprints across the room and flings himself into Dean’s arms, sending Dean’s game of solitaire scattering around on the ground. Dean catches him, holds him as tightly as physically possible as Cas cries. He pulls away, kisses him, kisses him, kisses him, goes back to squeezing him.
“I am,” Cas agrees. “But I chose that. I understood the cost of coming home to you.”
hit his daughter. He loves her too much, and he deserves to have her.” When Cas looks up, Judge Mills has a glimmer in her eyes. Cas looks to Sam who wears a small smile. He is too scared to look at Dean.
ripped Dean’s heart out.” Sam says, and Cas flinches away from the words, finally closing his eyes against Sam’s accusing stare.
“What?”
“Sammy,” Dean calls when he makes it back to his own home, throwing his keys onto the table and pulling open the fridge in search of something to eat. No response comes from his little brother, so Dean spares the microwave a glance to check the time, finding it only 11:20. Sam’s usually not asleep yet. Dean swallows a gulp of milk from the carton and closes the fridge. He walks down the hall to find Sam’s door cracked enough that Dean can see the little twerp sleeping peacefully, legs sprawled out and covers barely holding on through Sam’s tornado-like slumber. Dean smiles fondly before taking a running start and leaping on top of him.
“I’m gay as shit, but it isn’t a problem. I love cock. Cock is the best thing that ever happened to me. Do you even
He wakes up in Wyoming, a knot in his neck the size of a ping pong ball. He groans as he sits up, and Gabe immediately starts in on him.
and Dean is all that is in the frame, his face shadowed by the sun behind him.
“Of course you have a dad. Everyone has a dad.” The kid blinks again, slowly taking in what Dean says.
“You don’t think that would make things weird?” Dean asks, for the first time in a while catching Cas’ eye.
“Hi there, Mr. Winchester,” Dean says, eyes playful as he tugs Cas closer.
“That was terrifying,” Cas mutters, tears springing to his eyes. “Dean, please get me off the ice. What if it breaks?”
“Technically, we’ve just been fooling around. We haven’t fucked yet.” Dean shrugs, as though that or his words would make the situation better. All anger drains from Lisa’s face.
“What do you mean?” she asks, brushing her hair back from her face.
“Uh, you wanna sit?” Sam asks shakily, but Jessica just smiles and nods, taking a seat on the end of Dean’s bench, leaving room for Sam between them. He takes his seat dutifully and silence falls around them. Dean can practically feel Sam panicking.
“Do you want to do it again?” she asks, eyes bright and open. Castiel swallows thickly, his throat clenching shut. He hates himself for wanting to be better, for wanting to like women and pussy and
is Clarence!” Dean watched her for a moment before remembering the story from all those months ago, the one that encouraged him and Cas back together to begin with, and Dean grinned.
Dean rolls away immediately, swallowing the whimper and fumbling into his jeans. Cas just lies there staring slack-jawed and horrified into his mother’s wide eyes. The moment lasts an eternity.
“So what do you wanna take pictures of first?” Dean asks, watching as Cas fiddles with the focus on his camera.
“Dean,” she calls, opening her arms wide to him. He smiles and steps to her, hugging her tight and remembering what it was like to hug her at two, at four, at the funeral. After that, John stopped going to see Ellen, and really, Dean can’t blame him. Ellen was the living reminder that Mary was dead. They all were. “How have you been?” she asks when they pull apart, and if Dean didn’t know better, he’d think she was just making small talk, being polite. However, she has a glint of concern in her eyes, and when he shifts his eyes to the others, he sees them watching him.
“You didn’t want
“How long do you want me to stay?” Cas asks softly, and Dean’s heart slams once, twice, and again.
,” he groans before spitting his toothpaste into the sink and jogging to the door. “I hope you don’t want to sleep here tonight,” Cas threatens emptily, turning back to face Gabe as he pulls open the door.
He dips forward, catches Dean’s lips gently.
“Where are you going to go, Dean?” She asks, stepping closer and closer, obviously trying to get a rise out of Dean, but he has nothing left to offer her but a small exhale.
Dean trails his hands over them all with a sigh, straightening the ones that need it and the ones that don’t. Then he is in the living room, surrounded by dirty dishes and limp clothes and the stench of stale alcohol. Dean sighs again.
“Dean,” Sam says, leaning close and tapping his shoulder. Dean reluctantly tears his eyes away from the fact that
“Babe, what’s wrong?” Dean asks softly, stroking his thumb over Cas’ stubble.
and your refusal to do
Cas’ eyes whip up to him.
His hands reach for the trenchcoat without Dean’s permission, and when they sink into the lapels of that damn thing, it’s all he can do to draw him forward, press their foreheads together, and breathe.
“See that’s just it. She won’t have Dean. Dean is gone.”
“Not the time,” Dean grunts in response, bringing his forehead against the curve of Cas’ shoulder in his state of sated bliss.
"Not very much,” Dean grits, eyes burning like hellfire as he stares at the lawyer.
. Cas swallows hard. Continues. “Dean’s not a bad person. He’s the best person I’ve ever met.”
"Yes, your honor," he replies softly.
“Different…” Dean mulls, but it doesn’t matter, and he tells her as much. “It doesn’t matter, Anna. He’s still, Cas.”
Dean. You are extremely aesthetically pleasing.”
“Yes,” Cas laughs, bringing a hand to his chest “Yes, please.” Dr. Roberts smiles and waves her arm towards a set of doors.
“Wait!” Cas cries, latching a hand around Sam’s arm to keep him in place. “Please, Sam,
“I do want to see him again,” Sam says sadly, dropping his eyes yet again. “He’s still my dad. I just wish he didn’t suck so much…”
“I love him,” Cas insists, a bit too forcefully to be an honest completer of stage four.
” Cas smiles a sad smile.
, and Cas groans, picking up a pillow and throwing it at Gabe, effectively getting him out of the room. Dean grins when Cas settles back near him.
“He’s my best friend,” Cas says with a shrug, his face hot with the accusation. “Of course I know this stuff about him.”
“Shut the fuck up. We don’t have long,” he says, pushing his hips against Cas’, jerking Cas’ head back by the roots of his hair, and latching onto every piece of skin the motion exposes. Dean needs Cas as hard as he is, and he needs him there
The play that Cas and Dean are preforming in the beginning is actually a fanfic idea of mine that will be my next project after this series! It will be a historical AU based off the life of Frederick the Great of Prussia and the fact that he tried to run away with his best friend and suspected lover. It may not follow through, but let me know if you'd be interested in reading such a fic! (If I do go through with writing it, sorry about the spoilers from the play... It was unavoidable)
The nurse comes back a few moments later, a bottle in one hand and a cloth in the other. She sits in the vacant chair beside Cas and instructs him through the feeding and burping of his daughter.
“No.” Dean sits straight up in bed.
“That’s fine,” Dean says eventually, setting Emma on the floor so she can tell her mother goodbye. Emma runs to Lydia and wraps her skinny arms around Lydia’s legs, but all she gets in response is a couple of pats on the head from Lydia. Dean stands to the side through the exchange, and when Emma runs away, not having noticed the neglect, Dean steps forward and leans in for a kiss.
“Well, he likes
“I’ll go too,” Lisa says, pulling her purse higher on her arm and standing with Dean. His smile deflates.
He never does.
, close to Cas in the way he so desperately needs to be.
“What were their names?” she asks excitedly, and Dean smiles. It’s not as difficult with her as it had been by himself.
Cas leaves his mom there eventually, packs up his things—street sign included—and makes the long trek back to Seattle where Dean is, where he will not see Dean. Sam calls again on the drive, but Cas doesn't answer. He is probably only calling to offer him a shoulder to cry on, someone to talk to when his undying love for Dean becomes too painful. Cas appreciates the gesture, really, but, he’ll do better to suffer in silence. Cas ignores Gabe’s calls too. They’re probably together anyways, discussing all the ways Cas will need to be babied until his broken heart is healed. Well fuck that, in Cas' opinion.
He parks next to Baby, and the first thing he does is run his hands over her glossy black paint. He sees the army men in the ashtray, the Lego’s in the vents. He sees S.W., he sees D.W., and he sees every moment in between. He sees the drive from Double Springs to Sceadan, cramped in the back between hastily-packed boxes and a car seat. He sees his father’s tear-stricken face, and he sees baby Sammy oblivious and asleep. He sees his whole life in a rear-view mirror and the house before him.
“So what’s teaching like?” Dean asks, and it begins. They sit there in that tiny booth for nearly six hours, laughing, drinking, reminiscing. It is great, like nothing ever changed, that is, until all the laughter and nostalgia is broken up by Cas’ ringing phone which he silences quickly with a roll of his eyes. “Girlfriend?” Dean asks, not so much because he wants to know who is calling, but because he wants to know if Cas is available, because he wants to know if he is still the person that said Dean was wrong for loving him. His heart clenches. He does not want Cas to be that person. He wants this to be the Cas that kissed him softly, told him he was the only thing good in the world, the Cas who loved him unconditionally, even as a friend.
“He doesn’t fucking
“Mom’s sick, Cas,” Gabe says finally, and Cas snorts.
and they’d both gotten a laugh out of it. What he hands to Naomi though, is pages upon pages of anxiously scribbled assessments, becoming truer and truer as the pages wear on. It began much like the one he gave to Charlie, covering the basics with a few more adjectives, but when he got to Dean, his short, choppy sentences became sprawling symphonies, singing his praises with a melancholic voice. The last lie he’d told…
“I’m not here to make friends,” he says, so Cas drops his hand.
“Alright that's enough.” Bobby stands and crosses the room to stand nose to nose with John. “You’re a sorry son of a bitch, John Winchester, you know that?”
“Kind of dumb to keep alcohol in the house of a recovering alcoholic, don't you think?" Dean retorts, locking eyes with her before laying down on his bed and staring up at the ceiling.
, Dean." Cas’ voice is low and deadly. Dean flinches at its magnitude. "What you do is filthy. Everything you touch, you ruin. It will take an eternity to wipe your stain off me.”
“Hello,” the person on the other side says, eyes boggling when Cas turns back to meet him. “Holy blue,” the man says, staring at Cas with wide eyes, and Cas cannot say that he was not thinking the same thing, except,
“You can’t leave,” she screams, slamming her hands down on her desk. “You are
And now this.
As it turns out, he does not need to. Castiel gets out of the car slowly, unlocks the front door mechanically, and stops in the threshold, eyes wide and horrified. Steve barks happily at him, but Castiel is seeing something else. He is seeing the emptiness of his home, the emptiness of his life.
“What else did you say?” Cas chokes out, glancing at the worker who is watching him intensely.
“That’s better.”
When it is over, Cas sags against Dean, wilting slowly inside of him, Dean’s come slowly cooling between them. Dean lets him, holding his boyfriend close to his chest and staring up at the ceiling, uncaring to the nastiness of this post sex state. Dean stares up at that ceiling for an eternity.
“Don’t remind me,” he grumbles before Dean shuts the door between them.
“Oh yeah? Never pictured you becoming a teacher,” Dean says, smiling a bit at the road ahead.
“It’s okay if you’re mad at me,” Dean whispers before Cas can get a word in. “I fucked up again. I love you, and it’s all different now, too late now. It took me too long to say it, and I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. You didn’t deserve to, to
This is what I live for,
“Thanks, Dean,” she murmurs as Sam hands her the pen back.
“I’m glad I got to hear your voice.”

“Baby,” Bela croons. “Your girlfriend isn’t here,” and that is it. End of discussion.
“I’m trying, Cas,” Dean said, voice almost desperate.
be the way he tells Cas, Dean furious and Cas reeking like prostitution. Dean refuses, and Cas gets even more pissed off. "You know what, Dean," Cas says finally, his voice angry but controlled. "I don’t want to be around you right now.”
. He pours himself a whiskey, downs it, and pours himself another. Day five meets him with a hangover, but he does not mind. The pain keeps the sadness at bay, and by day seven, Sam has fresh news to press into him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Happy birthday,” she says when she hugs Dean, pressing a kiss against his cheek and pulling back to wipe the lipstick away.
just because you loved him.” He closes his eyes to her words, drops her hand, turns away from her. He chews his lip to keep from sobbing, breaking right there in the middle of his childhood home. “I should have baked you a pie the day I walked in on you two together. I should have hugged you, congratulated you on what you had with Dean.” She lets out something between a whimper and a cough, and a sob chases its way out of Cas’ chest. “I’m so sorry, Cassie,” she says, and that is it. He begins sobbing, wailing until his face is being pressed against his mom’s shoulder.
“What are you doing?” Gabriel demands, arms crossed across his chest.
"Yeah," Dean says softly, kissing Cas' forehead again. "I wanted to tell you sooner, but then I got nervous and started rambling and then
you were this, this empty shell of yourself, emotionless and
“Aren’t you going to read the card first?”
“Oh, she’s just doing it to piss her off, now,” he says, but Cas is too busy listening to what the judge is saying to find anything too funny.
tell him your name?” She asks, and it suddenly dawns on Cas that no, he hadn’t.
“Dean, are you ever gonna talk?” Cas asks finally, swaying his shoulder into Dean's as they break through the line of trees around the creek and their treehouse.
The next morning hits Dean like a bag of bricks, but instead of pretending the pain doesn’t exist, he faces it head on. He is eager to see Cas, so much so that after crawling back into his own window, he only showers and catches a couple hours of sleep before heading back over to Cas’ house with Sam half asleep in the back seat.
“Relationship, huh?”
Dean is on a lake, his back to the setting sun and a fishing pole in hand. His eyes are closed. He doesn’t need his eyes open to catch a fish. The breeze ripples the water slightly, coaxing the afternoon heat into a milder evening. It’s nice.
to you. Dean, you couldn’t see out of your left eye for two weeks. Sam, your rib is still broke! Don’t forget what he’s done to you boys.”
“Always a pleasure, Doc,” she says exiting the circle and heading for the door. “Peace out, bitches.” As soon as the door shuts behind her, Naomi visibly relaxes, fists unclenching in her lap.
“Dean?” Bobby calls from the back, concern etched into his voice.
“Because it’s true! I killed my mommy,” he wails, and Cas’ heart wrenches in his chest. He scoots a bit closer to Dean and wraps a skinny arm around Dean’s heaving back, pulling the taller boy close to his chest and letting him cry. Cas doesn’t think Dean killed his mommy. He doesn’t think Dean could hurt anyone on purpose. Even so, he holds his new best friend tight to his chest until his sobs become snores and the moonlight becomes sunlight. They are awoken by a squealing child and thundering footsteps. Dean is jolted awake thinking it’s Sam, thinking it’s his father. Cas is jolted awake because Dean shoots ramrod straight in his bed. He watches with sleepy confusion as Dean takes in his surroundings in a quick succession, his mouth set into a deep frown. When his eyes land on Cas, his face relaxes a bit, realization smoothing his mouth into a more neutral state.
he deems, and lets sleep overcome him.
“You’re taking everything from me,” Dean says, his back still to his dad, his head held high. “You’re taking my home, my life, my school, my boyfriend. You can’t even let me keep the fucking car?”
“I think that's enough questions from Mrs. Winchester," Judge Mills says after another long moment. She misses Lydia mouthing
“Was it me? I know I gained three pounds, but,” she starts, watching him sadly with her hands in her lap. Dean cuts her off.
“You’d think by now I’d feel like I deserved at least a little love,” he mutters finally before shouldering his way out of the truck and heading for the school.
be. He can’t go back to the empty bed that smells like Dean, so he’ll stay here tonight, curled in Charlie’s office chair beneath his jacket. He won’t sleep.
“What do you mean,
“Yes,” Emma says quietly, and Judge Mills eyes cut to Dean. She looks sad, like she knows Emma is not telling the truth but is trapped with the reality that she can't prove it.
rather than admitting he’s reached his breaking point of the number of times he can think about a man without seeing him again. After day four of subway rides, he retrieves his car from the yard, airs up his leaking tire, and limps into the auto-shop downtown.
“Wow,” Naomi concludes, startling Cas away from the darkness of his thoughts as she straightens the last page of his inventory before folding it into his file. Cas looks down. “You felt pretty strongly about
“Your brother must really love you,” Dean drawls, leaning close and running his hand over Cas’ chest. “I’m your slave for a whole 24 hours.” Dean presses a kiss to Cas’ jaw, to which Cas backs away uncomfortably.
Cas kisses him softer, sweeter.
“Do you agree that homosexuality is wrong?” she asks, and Cas knows that this is his chance. If he tells her yes, he’ll move on to step two, and be only eleven steps away from Dean.
“Do you think he saw?” Cas asks worriedly, wiping absently at his swollen lips as though he had come on them. Which he did not. Because
Dean pulls it together eventually. He stands from that damn slick pond and starts the trek back up the hill to Bobby’s truck. He doesn't know why he went there anyway, only that he wanted a place where memories of no one but Cas permeated. He sees he was wrong; he pushes away all thoughts of Cas. He thinks of Sam instead. He thinks of Bobby. He thinks of Ellen and Jo and Jess and Benny and anyone else who can make him forget.
I’m sorry,” John says, but even from his room, Dean can tell John doesn’t know. Sam continues to tell John everything, be it things about Jessica to his latest victory with his academic team, and when there is nothing left to say, there is a beat of silence, rolling footsteps in the hall, and John’s face in Dean’s door. Dean sees his reflection in the dark window, a smile plastered on his face. Dean doesn’t turn. “And what about you?” John says finally, but Dean does not respond. “What have I missed in your life?” Dean does not respond, simply continues putting away his clothes. “Come on, son. I’m trying here. Tell me what I’ve missed,” and Dean responds.
Also, um...a lot of you saw this coming...it was bound to happen eventually. I know that doesn't get me out of the doghouse with you all, but I'm still sorry. There is a lot of angst up ahead, and for that I also apologize. Have faith that I will fix it, because I swear I will.
“Dean,” Ellen says, laying a hand over his shoulder. “You’ve been sitting here for hours, honey. Are you alright?” Dean looks up.
“And you’re in love with him?” she asks, and Cas prepares himself for the lie, swallowing the bile that the thought of not loving him brings.
“You know, Valentine’s day is coming up. You could ask him then.”
Naomi’s eyes darken, and Cas decides right there that he rather likes this Charlie girl.
“You love him, and he willingly went to that SOCE clinic, and now, he’s ignoring you,” Sam starts again, his voice louder this time, more sure of himself.
he means.
When he gets to the living room, he sees his family there, grinning at him in their suits and dresses. Ellen approaches him first, plants a wet kiss on his cheek and reels back to wipe the lipstick away. He grins at her.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean groans with a grin, tucking his dick back into his pants and zipping up. “That was hot,” he says and stands, walking over to Cas and kissing his neck. Cas smiles softly, scrubbing his hands to get Dean’s come off of them.
“Dean,” Lilith says sweetly, smiling her way closer. “I’m not going to make you stay. You’re obviously very distressed.” She smiles again, her smile turning to that old familiar sadism. “But I am going to make Sam stay. He’s really the only one we want. He is John’s favorite, after all.” Dean would scoff if it didn’t hurt so much.
Cas thinks venomously, but says nothing. Naomi eventually sighs. “Fine. You should know though, that we are only here to help.” Cas looks away, and after a while, he is dismissed into the hallway where he comes face to face with the girl from group. Charlie, Cas recalls, slightly dazed.
“Did it…” she clears her throat, drawing his eyes back to hers. She looks embarrassed. “Did it
“Dean’s court date is in a week,” Sam says, and Cas freezes.
He stays gone for the rest of the morning, only resurfacing to have lunch with Dean and to insist that Dean fix his hair before coming to the school. Dean obliges simply to take some of the stress off Cas’ shoulders, and the next time the curtains part, Dean is ready for the glare of the lights. He is ready for the sudden silence of the crowd. He is ready for the immediate attention, and he works it. He knows Cas will be out shortly, so he performs. He squares his form into the soldier Cas wrote him to be, and delivers his lines. He loses himself in it; so much so that when the curtain closes for intermission at the end of act one, he is left upstage breathing heavily.
“Hey, Lydia,” Dean calls, his head searching between the shelves of the refrigerator. “Where did you put the steaks?”
she was on the pill, and when he found out she was pregnant, he had been
feel about him. We wouldn’t want him diving in with the devil half informed, would we?” And that is it. Cas springs forward, a single hand finding a very satisfied grip in the roots of her scalp as her eyes stare into his, terrified.
“When are you going to be back?”
“I don’t know, Cas.”
“Hey, Dean,” John says when he spots him, a big smile covering his face. Dean offers a small one in return. “Sit down, son. I want to talk to you.” So Dean sits because John gave him an order, and that’s just what happens when John gives an order. It is obeyed. “I’m sorry I was so tough on you yesterday.”
“Was there anything else?” Dean asks, and Cas shrugs.
“Bobby,” Dean starts, shaking his head slightly.
“He drugged
“I’m so s—” he starts, but Dean interrupts him.
a hellhound. He is a pomsky, and he is adorable.”
“That why you’re dressed all snappy?” she asks, offering him another coffee, one that he accepts.
“I love you, Dean,” Cas whispers because even though there is no one around but the cars passing by at seldom intervals, no one but the trees and the sky, it is too public. The words are for Dean alone, and no one else should get to hear. Dean, half a country away sitting on the hood of his car with his wife asleep just inside the house, feels the same way. He doesn’t want his neighbors, his sleeping daughter, his sleeping wife to hear him, and Cas doesn’t miss it in Dean’s reply.
“Dean,” Sam whines, slapping at his brother and wriggling until he’s free. Dean grins and leans back against the wall through Sam’s bitchface.
He is not
“No, it doesn’t,” Dean argues, his head falling lower and lower into his chest. Small is less threatening. Small is less punchable, and that includes with words.
He always thought they would be best friends through everything. Now…now, he’s not so sure. He just needs to talk to Cas. He needs to hear that his doubts are completely invalid and that Cas still loves him with every ounce of his being. He needs to hear that he’s been worrying for nothing, that Cas would have called if he could, written if he could. He needs to hear that his love—and God, does he love Cas—isn’t unrequited, isn’t unwanted.
“You should go anyway,” Sam says, but Cas doesn’t respond. Of
“Ken,” Cas grits out after a moment, not wanting to tell her anything. Cas knows Dean would hate the Ken Doll reference, but he’s in a corner here, and Naomi nods as she jots down the false name.
“Please tell me you didn’t just quote John Green to me,” Dean says, looking back to his movie, and Cas smiles. He hadn’t meant to quote John Green, but now that he has…
smart. You’ll fit right in.”
“Those are my siblings,” Cas says, watching as Dean reaches up and covers a yawn before trying to straighten his blonde hair down into its usual bowl shape. Cas rolls out of bed and stretches. Dean follows shortly after, walking with him into the hall and poking his head out to see the running children. “Anna is three, and Gabriel is fourteen.”
Charlie is staring straight at him, a smile on her face, clearly expecting him to come to her register.
“Okay. Good. Now, why don’t you tell me about this best friend of yours?”
“Come on, Dean,” she says, sliding closer until she is practically in his lap. Dean has nowhere to go. He’s not sure if he wants to anyway. “Just for old time’s sake.”
“I don’t know how he’ll ever top this,” he says, and leans forward to kiss Dean.
“Hey, watch it buddy. Can’t a guy say he misses you without you automatically jumping to the conclusion that it’s flirting?” Cas snorts, that grin still playing with his lips.
“Yes, but why?”
there’s fucking
“Have you completed your inventory?” she asks when Cas is seated across from her.
Dean chastises as he walks around to the driver’s side.
He doesn’t even know why. All he knows is that it hurts. All he knows is that everything hurts like a bitch and that if he doesn’t fall to the floor and cry like a goddamned baby, he might just burst into a million pieces. So he does. He sits in the middle of that nasty boys’ bathroom, hands shaking and knees refusing to hold him every time he tries to stand. He sits there, covered in shame and
When they pull up beside the quaint little house fit for a white picket fence, Sam jumps out of the car and bounds up the steps. Dean turns the volume down so they don’t get a noise complaint called on them, and watches as Sammy raps against the door with his knuckles. Jessica comes out a few minutes later in a thick, white sweater, hair twisted back but falling into her face. She grins at Sam like he hung the moon, and Dean quietly loves her for that. It reminds him of the way he’d seen Cas look at him so many times, even as kids.
“Why the hell didn’t you tell me some hot guy took your register?” he demands of her, though she can barely speak through her hysterical laughter.
he can’t have from Dean. Tell him the cost. Let him choose.
out from around his chattering teeth.
“Good,” he says with a smile. April gives Castiel another smile before pushing herself away from him, leaving him lying there naked and alone. He stares after her for a long moment, watching the curve and sway of her walk as she makes her way to her desk. She dresses smoothly, never sparing Castiel another glance before she unlocks the door and leaves. Her smell is all over him, clinging to his skin in the way Dean always did.
“I know.”
about you, son. We’re worried that this,
“On what?”
Dean chokes again. He’s staring at Cas, terrified.
stop loving him. I will always be
“Yeah you do,” Dean mutters, tilting his hips so that every drive down rubs against his prostate. “Fuck yeah you do,” Dean says, throwing his head back again. His cock is achingly hard, rutting back and forth against Cas’ stomach. He’s torn which he wants to do more, ride Cas’ cock until he comes untouched or jerk his meat and blow his load all over Cas’ chest in mere minutes. He starts jerking. Dean knows the closer he gets, the louder he gets, but they’re alone, and Cas likes em loud. “Fuck yes,” he groans, his hips slamming down into Cas’ again and again. “I fucking love you, Cas.”
"No," he replies, and Cas sees Lydia's face harden, her jaw clench.
Dean’s feeling pretty fuzzy around the edges right now, so he doesn’t immediately remember that he’d been drinking to stop thinking about Cas, and with that oversight in mind, it takes very little for Dean to plop down opposite Cas at the table and drag over another tumbler.
“I can tell. You know it’s liquor before beer right, bro?” Dean teases lightly, scanning his face for any signs of real trouble.
“Yes, you do,” Dean says finally, speaking louder and louder as though it could drown out the shaking in his voice, the shaking of Cas’ head. “You love me. You’ve always loved me!
“It’s okay to cry, Sammy,” Dean tells him, shifting his shoulders against the cooling tears and spit and snot his baby brother laid into his shoulder. Sam snorts another half-laugh and shifts back on Dean’s bed. “Listen," Dean continues slowly. "I know you miss her. I miss her too, believe me.”
“Jesus Christ, Dean. What time is it?” Sam asks in exasperation, running a hand through his ratty hair, smoothing it slightly. Dean doesn’t mind. He doesn’t even notice.
meant you were already past the first stage, but..." She lets out a breath as though she were extremely disappointed in him, as though Cas gives a damn if she is. "As I can see from our group session today, you aren’t ready for stage two.”
. Cas pulls away immediately, face ablaze. A look of exasperation washes across Dean’s face before he can cover it, and it is like a punch to the gut for Cas. It is the same look that has passed everyone who’s ever even been remotely
can do about it.”
“Jess is dead,” Sam bites out, and Cas’ heart stops. A moment passes, and then another.
“Naomi,” he says shortly, eyes locked dead on her.
“Yeah,” he says, flashing back to fingers trailing over spotted shoulders, lips pressing against each and every freckle. “Millions and billions of shapes.”
“Wait. What do you mean ‘get your things’?” Cas asks, excitement growing in him.
“You’re already in my pants, Dean. You don’t have to say that,” he replies, just as Dean had all those years ago. Dean grins and stares up at the ceiling.
“Well, I’m gay, so,” Cas says with a shrug, pulling a laugh out of Dean.
“You know what, you
He thinks he’s going to die here.
Dean closes his eyes against it, and when Cas sags against him, he does his best to wrap him in his arms.
rolling around like animals!”
Eventually, they each get settled, Cas’ things in Cas’ room, Gabe’s things in Gabe’s room, Sam’s things in the spare closet beside the couch he’ll be sleeping on. He bitchfaces as he piles his belongings on the shelves, but whatever because, had he just
“Well don’t leave me in suspense,” Dean says with a snort. His fingers trace the lines in Cas’ back. The years melt away between them.
“I would love a beer,” Sam says, so Dean unlocks his door and pops the top on a beer for his baby brother. They sit together in the kitchen and talk for hours, spending no time at all and all the time in the world there in those chairs. When Lydia pushes open the door, Emma on her hip, she finds them still nursing their first beer and appropriately buzzed on the presence of the other.
been like.
After the announcement, Cas made dinner while Emma played in the living room. Dean sat on the counter, watching every move Cas made with hungry eyes. Cas knew what they would be doing that night, and as Cas moved about the kitchen, he found himself starving for it.
“Yes, I noticed you seem a bit obstinate about the whole endeavor,” Cas says, deadpan.
“He said he was sorry, Bobby,” Dean says, staring at his Uncle Bobby, the man who’s been more like a father to them than an uncle or the non-relative he really is.
“I don’t know how an hour before noon could be joyous,” he mutters, scrubbing the hand down his face again.
“Why don’t you record it, and we can watch it tomorrow?” Dean offers because he does not like the sight of Cas walking away from him, not in the least.
And when he raises his eyes from his list, his heart beats in a steady and lilted cadence. His hands shake, but it does not matter. Charlie gone, Dean is gone, and the fight is over for him...
“Sure, Cas,” Dean says after a moment. They sit on Cas’ couch with a respectable distance between them, the curtains drawn tight around them. The movie, which Cas offered Dean choose, is an action/thriller, and it has Cas’ stomach rolling. He’s not much of one for blood and guts and gore, so he takes to watching Dean watch the movie and ignoring the sounds of guns and blood spatter. Dean’s eyes are wide and childlike and Cas is once again struck by his beauty. He is struck by the openness he finds in Dean’s face.
until the sweating palms and the frantic lips becomes all that they have. Dean needs Cas in his entirety, every damn blink, breath, and smile.
“Benny, you have to! Tonight is the important show! You can’t be sick!” Cas’ voice is frantic, but Benny can’t help but cough over him.
Onward to part three.
“Dinner in ten,” she says shortly, and before Dean can open his mouth to say anything, she is starting back in, her hands on her hips and her eyes narrowed. “Do you want to know what my problem is? I’ll tell you what my problem is. My problem is that your father has worked
“What? Seriously?”
They would think he was pathetic. He kinda thinks he’s pathetic, and even as he tells himself it’s just morbid curiosity—a shifter sex worker? That’s bonkers—he knows it’s a lie.
Dean walks them backward towards the bed until Cas is sitting down and Dean's leaning over him. Cas doesn’t break the kiss as he leans back, pulling Dean until he’s hovering over him, arms bracketing Cas' body. Dean runs his hands along Cas’ sides, taking a moment to pull away from his mouth and suck at his pulse point, lick into the hollow of his throat, nip along his shoulder, before pushing his lips back against Cas’.
“Why aren’t they to you? He’s your best friend,” she counters, mirroring his leaning back and adding a glare.
“Cas,” he tries again, whispering, and he flinches at the reverberation of his own voice. His heart is trilling in his chest, and his lips are barreling, choking out uncooperative, chopped up sentences in the cold. “Cas, gotta wake up, man, gotta help me find you. I need you…I can’t…I need you to help me. Please.
“True.” They both stare out at the audience. A quiet hum runs through them, half of the students waiting to tear the play apart and the other to put it in the pile with the rest of the school’s greatest.
“You are
“Not the time, Gabe,” he warns, still shaky over his past conversation, but Gabe just ignores the tremor in his voice, snickers, and goes to crawl in behind the Sasquatch who claimed shotgun.
“Hello,” he asks, but he isn’t sure if he’s really hearing.
"In that packet, you'll find pictures of their daughter three days after they escaped Mr. Winchester's clutches." Cas watches Dean turn to Sam in a confused panic.
It’s still fucking cold, but Cas is warm, and Dean is warming, and he’s got his nose pressed right against the juncture of Cas’ shoulder and neck, and though he still smells faintly of the Empty and more strongly of the dried blood crusting his shirt, beneath it all, he smells like
“I do. I really do.” Cas imagines Dean’s smile, the spattering of freckles across his nose glowing softly in the moonlight.
“She was my only friend in the clinic,” he says, sipping the coffee Dean offers him, two creams and three sugars, just like he likes. “She was this rebellious little shit, talking about lesbian porn to get out of group sessions.” Cas laughs, and Dean smiles, taking Cas’ hand. This is the first time they’ve even come close to talking about the past. “I told her about how much you meant to me, and we vowed not to let the other forget how much we needed our partners.”
He always draws up a blank; the only emotion he's been able to process is the harrowing guilt that has been eating him hollow for the past month and a half. If Dean ever agrees to talk to him again, Cas doesn’t know how he’ll be able to sputter anything other than
the reason I’ve managed to stay strong.”
“Are you calling
“Actually,” Jess says, and Sam’s eyes snap back to her. “My mom said I had to be home by dinner.” Upon seeing Sam’s disappointment, she adds a soft apology.
“Sam,” Dean starts finally, softly, warily. Sam looks over, eyes wide like Dean just told him he ran over his puppy. “You don’t see the way she looks at you.” Sam’s eyes grow even wider, and it might be comical if he didn’t look so terrified. “Give it to her, and let me be the best man at your wedding,” Dean says with a smile, and the terror slowly seeps out of Sam’s eyes.
“What’s wrong?” they ask him.
So Cas hides in his house for the next two nights, texts Dean still, and plans his move. He decides to go simple: flowers, card, dinner, but then Valentine’s day comes and butterflies slam in his stomach so violently that his boss snipes at him twice to keep his head on his work. Eventually though, he makes it to closing time and makes it home. He spends the next few hours preparing. He cleans house, cleans himself, breathes slowly, and then it’s the start of Dean’s shift.
me,” Dean says accusingly, and Cas grins, snuggles closer.
,” Cas says, refusing to let Dean look away. An eternity passes.
you love him,” he starts, trying desperately to catch Dean’s eye. “I know you do, and I know it hurts that he’s not talking to you, even more so now that you know he’s talking to other people. It hurts me
“Yeah, yeah,” Sam counters, sitting down on his bed and dropping his head into his hands. “Why are you here?” he asks, snapping his head up suddenly and staring at the couple.
“Nah,” he says shrugging. “They didn’t have the one I wanted.”
“I don’t, Dean!” Cas shouts, his voice echoing off his empty walls. “I don’t love you! I never did! I should have never let you touch me the way you did! You sodomized me,
“Dean doesn’t love me,” Cas replies, and the words taste like bile on the way out.
“So Charlie told me today that Gilda started polishing the play. She said Gilda thinks it will be ready in a week or so, and then we’ll start pitching.” Cas prattles on and on, and Dean’s face gets harder and harder, the farther into the letter he reads, and by the time Cas notices, he is on the last page. “Everything okay, Dean?” Cas asks, turning away from their lunch to look at Dean.
“Yeah, buddy,” Sam says gently. “He is,” and that sad smile on Cas’ face grows a bit.
I got paid for it. But now I see that…I’m just an object to them, a toy or a game. It’s a fucked up business, Cas,” Dean says, his fingers toying idly with the fabric of Cas’ shirt.
“Young man, you had better go apologize to him.”
“You know I love you too,” he replied, and they went to
“Then what’s the problem?” Dean pulls away, blinking earnestly at Cas while Cas chews his lip.
“Cas,” she starts with a sigh, sliding her bag off her shoulder and sitting next to Cas on the bed. “You love Dean, don’t you?” she asks softly reaching out and taking his hands in hers.
“Sure,” he says, looking up to the ceiling as if inspiration will strike from there, and strangely enough, it does. His heart aches when he begins, but Emma will enjoy the story. “Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there were two boys who were bestest friends in the whole world.”
“I love you, mommy,” he says softly, and she tells him she loves him back before standing and leaving. The beginning of the school year passes in a blur for Dean. He learns his alphabet, all the way up to his P’s with example words and silly songs for everyone. “A says ah or aye or ahh. Apple or alien, alligator too,” follows his every step. He learns his colors. “My eyes are green,” he tells baby Sam one night. “Your socks are blue. Mom’s hair is yellow.” He learns his numbers. “Onetwothreefourfivesixseven—mom look how fast I can count!—eightnineteneleven,” becomes his favorite game. He is happy. He is normal, and as Mary puts him to sleep one night early November, no one has any idea that when he wakes, he will no longer be the normal and happy child he once was.
, that I only cause him pain.”
“The ice won’t break. Me and Sammy have done this a million times!” Dean wraps his hands around the ropes and jerks forward, letting out an excited shriek as they begin to slide. Cas’ face buries in Dean’s layers of clothes, his arms wrapped around Dean’s middle. Dean just laughs, eyes glued open against the cold and joy as they slide on and on, down each hill they go over until they ease to a halt over the frozen pond. Dean rolls off the sled laughing, but Cas stays frozen, even as Dean falls away. “See, Cas!” Dean hoops, jumping to his feet and slipping back across the ice to his best friend. “Wasn’t that so much fun?” Cas pries his eyes open and stares at his best friend in horror.
“You said that already,” Cas reminds with a grin.
The Daddy Room isn’t really a room, and it isn’t really for the daddies. The Daddy Room is simply the hallway outside the nursery, across from which is the nurse’s station. However, dads are swarming the place. Some have their faces pressed against the glass, others talk to one another, some talk to the nurses on duty about their children, while others sit in the lobby a few rooms away, still waiting for their children to be brought in. Cas freezes outside the window, Jess by his side. He takes a long look at each of the babies in pink, some sleeping, some staring, some crying. He doesn’t notice a presence step up beside him.
“Look, Cas,” Dean says, looking down and rubbing a hand across the back of his neck.
The reality of the moment is this:
her,” Gabe says again, stressing the word harder this time, and Cas snorts.
“You and me both,” Dean grumbles around his slight panic.
“Hello,” he asks, scared that the call might be an emergency.
“Okay, Dad,” Dean says, his eyes on his hands.
“I wanted to thank him,” Sam says, that dopey grin coming back full force around the chunk of apple in his mouth. “He said he’d put in a good word for me with a girl he’s been tutoring, and last period she asked me to get a milkshake with her after school.” Sam is practically giggling. Dean barks out a laugh.
“I can’t believe I let you talk me into this,” Dean says, his eyes shining in the darkness. The collective breaths from the audience are nothing but a whir from the other side of the curtain. His best friend grins.
They will be fine without him, really and truly. The bills will get paid and the children will get bathed and the family will get fed. They will be fine even when the silences stretch too long, when the cold becomes too cold, when the drive becomes too long. They will survive without him because they have one another, but sometimes…sometimes they just need to see him smile.
“Actually," Dean starts seriously. "He might already know." Dean sighs, earning himself wide eyes from Sam.
Cas was always there when Dean needed him.
to start swinging fists on instinct alone when they jerk his headphones off his head to wake him up? Lucky for them, Sam ducked and Dean woke up enough to realize that it was Bobby he was swinging for, not some burglar or monster. Even so, Bobby drops the plate he's holding in order to block the punch flying towards the side of his head, landing Dean's special birthday waffles syrup-side-down on the old, shaggy carpet.
he asks himself, tugging his hair out of his face, his forehead knocking against the steering wheel. He stays in his car for a while, trying hard to get a grip, and when someone knocks on his window, he stutters in a shaky breath and looks forward. He can’t look at Charlie yet.
Anger unfurls in his gut because Cas fucking
sticky hands. They rub down her face, pull on her hair, pat against her calf. It doesn’t matter that they have each other, or that Anna doesn’t want them, each and every one of her little cousins want her. They want her undivided attention, playing games with them or listening to them read or walking to the bathroom with them. Whatever the task may be, they need her there beside them, and the way they ask for that is with their tiny,
“Fine, I won’t forgive you, ever. Does that make you feel better?” Dean asked, trying for a lighter mood and even managing to get Cas to snort.
“That sounds…”
“Dean!” Benny shouts when he catches sight of him. “You are my
“Yes ma’am,” he says again in an even quieter voice.
“What happened?” Cas asks finally, his eyes still on the outside.

The adoption agency isn’t very full. Apparently, very few people felt their child was worth enough to brave the storm, but Cas, Cas is sitting patiently for the consultant to call him back and put him on the list. Eventually, someone does call his name, but it comes from the front desk instead of the back rooms.
“Dean, I never meant to hurt you,” Cas says, reaching out and wrapping a hand around Dean’s arm, only to have Dean jerk away and turn on him.
, you hear me?”
making Gabe clean his car when they get back to Seattle. For now though, he merely yawns and tells Gabe to pull over.
“What are you…?” Cas asked, voice trailing off.
“Let loo—Gabe! I’m not
“Oh, he just

“He wasn’t,” Dean mutters, even though he had. He doesn’t want Cas to get his dad in trouble.
"Is that true?" she asks, and Dean's eyes fall. Cas' face flames.
“No, Dean, of course not. I was,” but Dean is cutting him off again, reading this time from the apology.
His wake up call sounds bright and early the next morning.
“That’s terrible,” Cas murmurs, and Dean nods.
it reads inside in Dean’s shaky scrawl. Missouri smiles.
does not envy Sam or Gabe their turn as Cas sleeps, especially with the heavy silence that has been pressing down on them since that previous morning. Cas doesn’t ask. He doesn’t want to know, so when Sam drives and Gabe swears he’ll keep him awake, Cas closes his eyes and sleeps.
“Watch me,
stare.
“Miss you too, baby sister." Cas fiddles with the hem of his shirt. He knows what he wants to ask her, but he's not sure if he wants to know the answer. "Hey," he says finally, feigning nonchalance even thought his voice is shaking. "Will you ask Deana if she got my letters? I haven’t heard anything from her since I got here.”
Cas blinks up at Dean, his eyes as green as ever. His heart aches for all that he put Dean through.
Dean breathes out a slow breath and tries to get used to the feeling of someone else holding him together.
“Seriously, Cas. Just take the day off. It’s your birthday, for Christ sakes.”
“Personal? Kid, I raised you. You can tell me what you got your girlfriend.” Dean lets out a snort of teasing laughter, and again, the look on Sam’s face tells him it’s not a joking matter. “You okay?” he asks, and Sam nods.
“Lydia,” he’d said, and she sighed. “Please, I need to see her.” Dean’s voice was almost as sob, and Lydia had sighed again.
Sam hugs Bobby from behind, his scrawny arms wrapping tight around Bobby’s scruffy neck and his face pressing into Bobby’s shoulder. Bobby blinks and hugs Sam back a little, but Dean doesn’t think he can stand hugging Bobby right now. He might break.
“Yes. Dr. Roberts said that you could help me find my daughter. I’m adopting.”
“Are you my best friend, Cas?” Dean asks, his voice soft like Cas’. His hair is white in the moonlight.
Dean needs to hear from Cas. He needs to hear that voice and see those eyes and know that this silence is not by choice. It’s driving him crazy. It’s making that terrible little voice in the back of his head laugh that Cas doesn’t want him anymore, laugh that the best relationship of his life is over. He eats slower after that, sure that any sudden movement will send his already rolling stomach protesting into sickness.
“’M alright,” Dean says, but it falls flat when the iced vinyl of the backseat whips out across a suddenly-exposed strip of flesh. He shudders.
“I know what you’re doing,” he tells her, and her eyes widen comically in her “innocence.”
don’t know why, Cas,” she says softly, and it occurs to Cas that no, she doesn’t know.
More non-con ahead...
? I haven’t heard your voice in weeks.”
He’s fine. Really, he is, and he continues to be fine with every year that she grows. He is fine in the house without him. He is fine with his clothes boxed away and his car covered in canvas. He is fine because Mary babbles in her sleep. He is fine because she swims as well as she walks. He is fine because of the shock of red hair she grows. He is fine because she is laughter to fill the silence, she is warmth to fill the bed on stormy nights, she is a million questions and sticky hands and toothy grins, and she is his life. He is fine every day, waking up and brushing his teeth with bubble gum toothpaste and showering with pink rubber ducks. He is fine.
they could have found an apartment with three bedrooms instead of two. Even so, when they finish, Sam groans about needing to see Emma, Gabe groans about needing a beer, and Anna groans about needing a nap. The three of them leave Dean and Cas alone to christen the new place however they see fit.
“You just gonna sit there, Romeo?” his waitress calls to him, snapping him out of his trance.
He sees that very first day, how he was standing across the playground with Crowley, listening to them laugh at the crying boy under the tree. Cas didn’t think it was funny. Not in the least. So instead of laughing along, he left the circle and went to the boy.
. Unfortunately for him, Bobby beats him to the punch. “I just want you to know that…Your dad never...It doesn’t matter….I still…even though you’re…”
"Please continue, Mr. Winchester," she urges, waving to Sam.
“What?” he asks, leaning forward to catch Dean's eye again. “He already knows you're in love with him?”
His fingers map an invisible constellation. He focuses on that, and his breathing deepens a fraction.
“Good,” Dean says, even though he knows Cas is still nervous. “Because your best friend, i.e., me, has got this play in the palm of his hands.”
The light glinting from Dean’s wedding ring catches Cas’ eye, wrapping the coil around his heart even tighter. Dean continues.
With the years since Cas left, he has started to see himself as a statue, rigid and permanent, forever the person he was when he walked out of that clinic. But then there is Dean, who never
“What do I want?” John asks, stepping closer and raising his arms. Dean flinches involuntarily, but if John sees, he doesn’t comment. “I want to tell my son happy birthday. It’s been too long, Dean.” John moves forward again and wraps his arms around Dean, squeezing harder and harder to the point of pain until Dean hugs him back. “I’m proud of you, boy,” John says, and Dean does not know what to do. His entire existence warms at the words of praise coming from between his father’s lips.
“How many times have I let you and the boys stay at my house?” Bobby asks, pulling away from Dean and glaring at John. Judging by the harsh silence that follows, John knows the answer just as much as Dean does, the answer being any time they ever needed to. “You’re saying I can’t stay here for

“Cas,” Dean hisses, the heat inside of him coiling tighter and tighter as Cas’ breath pants against his neck.
, Cas.” Cas has tears in his eyes too, and they are standing nose to nose. “Not you…”
“Sam,” Dean starts, tears in his eyes as he reaches out for his brother. Sam jerks away, and the ache in Dean’s chest deepens.
, but I guess this will do,” he teases, flinching when he realizes that he
“Can you,” she hesitates, and Cas waits patiently. “Can you tell me what it was like…being with Dean?” Cas’ mouth hangs open, speechless.
“No, damn it!” Cas spits, eyes blazing and shiny. “You can't just do that!" Cas shouts, hands flying rapidly around his head as he screams. "You can't just make me all angry, and then kiss me like that will make it okay. You can’t! It doesn’t make it better, Dean!” Cas takes a breath, his chest heaving, his hands shaking. “I
“Of course you did,” he spits. “I
“Is it working?”
“Dean,” he breathes when he is fully seated inside of him.
“Going to pay our dear mother a visit,” he growls, heart beating hard in his chest. He is doing everything he knows to do to keep his anger hot and here and at the forefront of his mind. If he lets the anger leave, all he’ll be left with is the unavoidable hurt of Dean leaving him, the ache of being left completely alone, and the raw pain of knowing his mother betrayed him again. So yes, he keeps his anger hot.
“Dean,” Cas says, turning his head at the last moment so that his kiss presses to Cas’ neck instead of his lips. “It’s
“Thank you,” he whispers.
“Let’s go to bed,” Dean murmurs when Cas pulls away, and for this, Cas is very,
“Dean!” John shouts, startling them all with his sudden outburst. “Apologize.”
“Okay,” Dean says, swaying gently into Cas’ shoulder to get his attention. “So, we’ve been best friends for what, twelve years? Thirteen?” Cas nods, swaying back into Dean. “And they’ve been great,” Dean continues as their houses come into view. “And recently, we’ve started making out and giving each other killer blow jobs and just being generally sexy.” Cas laughs.
“We had Dad,” Dean defends weakly. “Uncle Bobby was here when he could be.”
“And I’m so excited to be your new mom,” she says, and Dean’s hands are slamming against the table before he realizes.
“Maybe…no. Do you?”
keep the car. It’s got some pretty nasty stains in the backseat anyway. Who knew gay sex could be so messy?” Dean grins at his father, swallowing down John’s disgust and hate-filled glare.
“Not yet. Everyone except Clarence thought the kiss was pretend, but Clarence got scared and ran away from Dean.”
“Dean,” Sam starts, looking at Dean earnestly. Dean can’t look at him. He might cry if he does, seeing his emotions reflected back in Sam like that. “You don’t see the way he looks at you,” Sam says, throwing his words back at him, and Dean scoffs, eyes burning.
” John swings again, but Bobby’s hold keeps him from getting close.
“Wonderful. There’s someone I want you to meet, in that case.” Naomi smiles at Castiel again before picking up her phone and pressing a button, bringing it to her mouth. “April,” she says into the phone, her eyes never leaving Castiel's. "Can you come in here?” Naomi puts the phone down and keeps that smile trained on Castiel. A moment later, a knock on the door has them both turning, eyes landing on a soft smile and strawberry blonde hair.
Eventually, they move from the kitchen and lie together in the bed, exchanging lazy kisses but mostly just looking at one another, taking in what the years apart have left them with.
I drove sixteen hundred miles to see you, to see how you were and to maybe…maybe fix things, but then Sam said you were happy! I was so fucking glad that you were happy. I cannot even tell you the weight that lifted off my chest to know that you were truly happy, Dean.” Cas’ voice softens, his eyes fill with tears. He continues after pulling in a shaky breath.
Staring down at her, he forgets every unhappiness he’s ever known. He forgets his parents abandoning him. He forgets finding his sister dead. He forgets losing Dean. He forgets every disappointment along the way. Staring down at her, her tiny blue eyes staring back, he thinks every heartache up until now has been to balance the sheer happiness of this moment.
“I hope you used protection,” he says instead of a simple
By the time they make it back to John’s—
“Alright, line up, children,” Bobby says, and they all grumble good-naturedly, shuffling in to their places. Sam shows up just seconds before Bobby asks where he is, Emma on his hip. Ellen hands her the little basket she’ll carry with her, and with her free hand, she reaches for Dean. Dean smiles at her and takes her hand.
“Hence, why we’re where we are today,” Cas replies with a nod. He throws back another hot swallow.
He calls Sam along the way.
“You’ve turned into a slob, Sammy,” Dean teases, tossing aside a pair of underwear so he can sit. Cas stands behind him, his hands resting on Dean’s shoulders.
As always, thanks for reading and I'd love to know what you all thought!
“Yeah?”
could soil and ruin. It made Cas feel better, more at home, but nothing made him feel quite as at home as when Emma crawled into his lap and curled up against his chest, her little hand patting over his chest.
