How was he doing this? How?
Dean could feel himself panicking. Could feel the terror grip and ice his heart.
“Oh, and I am to believe this? Fine, then, I’ll play. Why did he do it, then?”
Cas scowls and tips his chin up. “I don’t know what you mean. Your story was just boring me.”
for a dark god?” He asked.
Once, it was a salt lick. Dean always had a shard of salt with him whenever he craved it, so he’d given Castiel his own piece. The way his face had brightened and giggled when he first licked it… oh, it lit the night brighter than it had ever been.
“Oh, no, I’m so sorry,” he said with a gasp. “We can’t keep doing this, I can’t keep doing this to you, making you want me. What have I done?”
“Oh, Dean. I’m so sorry. So very sorry.”
The Pageant had ended in the way everyone assumed. Dean won with a clear and decisive margin. Now that his sponsors have settled their endorsements for the coming year, Dean has some free time. Of course, Cas being as street-wise as his  twenty-six years have made him, that time is spent mostly together under the guise of Dean bettering himself for upcoming projects.
Cas sliced into his side.
“You are a very quick study.”
“Sure?” He has no appointment except with a shower and his bed, but he lets Cas lead him away.
“Of course. I would love to, Castiel.”
Crowley storms to the front of the crowd, growling his displeasure with a beet red, apoplectic face. “Where have you been? Did the peacekeepers find you?”
“You don’t understand! It’s a curse! He’s under a
“Okay,” he responded, following him blindly as his brother took the brunt of the river’s strength. After all, Jimmy’d been able to rest for the last couple of hours. Even if heat was tearing him up inside.
Cas backs off, his eyes filling with tears. He understands. He’s just so damned frustrated with repeating the same steps like they’re on a roundabout. He wraps his arms around his knees and props his head on them. He’ll watch again. He’ll watch the damning footage that took Dean away from him.
Dean was gone.
“You wanna know how we broke him, ‘Caaas’?” he sang. “Bitch went into heat. Oh, and that bitch has such a sweet heat. We worked him constantly the whole week, filled him from both ends, didn’t let him sleep. Made so much money.”
“Look,” Jimmy finally said, pointing ahead. “A cave!”
Naomi smiles proudly. “You’re right, of course. You’re such a natural at this, Dean. You were absolutely born to it.”
And Cas made so many
Then he smelled it.
"Oh, Dean," he said, huddling closer. “That’s just
“Hello, Mr. Winchester,” Cas teases, his tone full of propriety. Before he was allowed to interview for the position of valet, Dean and Sam had given him a veritable master class on the rules of the caste. Sam had gone a step further and somehow produced a CV of past experience complete with verifiable references. Cas and Dean had both questioned him about it, but Sam would only smile and say, “You’re welcome.”
As some way to thank him, to show his appreciation, Dean would make things for him, give him things. First it was a full set of clothes (accidentally too large - Dean’d used himself as a reference), but Castiel was thrilled, and always wore them every time.
Determined to be a big brother, Dean has to tease him a little. “So you’re giving up all those others and settling on one woman?”
Cas soothes him. “Most people know the sounds well enough that they stay out of the way.”
“What’s so funny?” Sam asks his brother who up until his uptight chuckle had been stiff enough to snap.
Dean immediately started rubbing the offending shaft, making it release a soft dust.
*****
The crows lept into the air, attacking him, biting him, fluttering all around him, wings beating deafeningly in his ears.
Desperately, Dean took one of his now slick-wet hands and grabbed his love’s cock, squeezing and tugging on it, making Castiel mewl in ecstasy, then…
His wolf wasn’t coming.
Another aspect of these soirees that rankles is that other men in his caste are here to perform the same function. This might be his sponsor’s party, but all of his rivals will be here, too. He doesn’t truly have a problem with them. After all, there is more than enough fame to go around. But, two of them in particular have a noticeable problem with him. He knows that Gavin will be here. His sponsor won’t allow him to miss a single social event where he might build his brand. Dean feels for him because no matter how much music the older man makes, he’s never going to surpass Dean’s popularity. It sounds like a remarkably conceited thing to say, but it’s true.
“Who?”
“He was, for a while,” Dean said, clenching his fists and his teeth. “Until I shot him. With the last of Mary’s arrows. Right between the eyes,” Dean said, gaze hardening with anger.
“To what end?”
Dean.
“Me?” Megara asked, pulling out her crossbow from the latch on her back. “No. Which is why I requested Pamelia and dear Rowena to join me. Who else could imbue an arrow with enough spellwork to kill anything?”
But now the last one of them had grabbed Castiel and pulled him under the water of a murky river. And was holding him under.
“Of course you think that!” Megara snapped. “Don’t you see? He put you under a spell! You’ve been bewitched! The only question is why. Why
Cas snorts. “That is one of the many differences between us, Dean. I see it all the time. Just put on these robes, and you’ll witness it aimed at you, too.”
Sabanto are not allowed any education but the most rudimentary. It was a decision that he fought for the first two years of being an orphan. The courts were not willing to make an exception. Despite being born into a higher caste, his guardians were Sabanto, so he became that as well. At the time, it had felt like the doors to the ivory tower slamming in his face. Now, he realizes that education is more about personal discovery than the once coveted classrooms. He’s as knowledgeable about art history as any professor in this city or any other under the dome of Kanpeki Basho.
“What else do I need?” he said, moving to hover over her shoulder. He didn’t fully trust her, so whatever she said, he wanted to corroborate it with the book.
Castiel swallowed, watching his shadow dance on the cave wall. “You aren’t far from the truth,” he said, drawing the cloak tighter about him. “But there is nothing you can do. I’m bound to it ‘until the twilight of the gods, when the realms will be bathed red with blood and the suns’ rays turned black as pitch.’”
Cas notices that Dean doesn’t return the hug, his arms hanging loose by his sides, but he leans himself into Cas’s body with intent. He wants to be held. Cas’s heart breaks when he realizes that Dean probably doesn’t know that he can hug back. This poor man has been touch-starved and lied to his whole life.
“Because…” Dean drifted off. At last, though, he sighed, heart aching at the thought of him. His beautiful beloved. “Because he… he loves me.”
“Why?”
How stupid of him. How could he not have seen?
He really wished he hadn’t thought about it.
At last, though, someone broke the silence.
Dean nods knowingly. He can’t say the words here. If he were to be overheard, or even if someone here could lip read, they could both be in dire trouble. Leaving the dome is utterly forbidden.
Dean’s heart jumped in his chest at hearing the Omega speak his name so sweetly.
More intense pain shot through him, and all his strength left him.
Now that he could stand, in a search for something to do, he swept the dirt and leaves away to see what this was a shrine for.
“Well
That bit of information stings. Dean wasn’t aware that he was sheltered from knowledge, just actions. “It seems that you know more about what is being kept from me than I do.”
In a panicked, jittery voice, Dean asks, “What was that?”
“Where would I find a Worthy mortal?”
“I can’t,” he said, voice audible.
Cas barks out a laugh. “You don’t need to be appropriate with me, Dean. You have my permission to say anything you want to say.”
“I think that’s all of them,” Castiel said, sounded rather blissed out, letting out a hum of contentment.
“Except for stupidly privileged Yumeijin, you mean?”
Dean’s skin is heavily jeweled by the time Joanna steps back to admire her work. She pronounces the job complete not a second too soon. The studio manager, Rowena, approaches. She looks unhurried and nonchalant, but the younger women several steps behind her appear to be caught in a whirlwind while they are attempting to make appointments, answer calls and do their boss’s bidding all at once. They say that working for Rowena is hell, but these young women are getting the experience of a lifetime. When she fires them, and she always does, they will have their pick of jobs.
“Oh, that. I’m… I’m sorry for scaring you. I am not skilled at healing magic, so it drained me greatly. I’m more skilled with light magic,” he said, giving a sidelong look at Dean. “Smiting magic,” he said, staring, ready to gauge his wolf’s reaction.
The Omega gasped, whimpering pitifully as he felt himself stretch around Dean’s thick, heavy cock, working itself deeper and deeper inside of him. God, it was so thick, spreading him open almost painfully. Even when he thought Dean couldn’t delve any farther, he just kept going, burying himself deep within him. God, he could feel every single inch of Dean’s cock, the width of the head, the swell of the knot catching on his insides and sensitive rim.
“Then why do you want to take care of us?”
The sounds Dean releases aren’t anywhere close to the words that he was going to say, but Cas gets the general idea. More. More of this feeling. Cas obliges while he kisses the muscular swell of Dean’s shoulder. Feeling Dean’s bare skin beneath his lips is a dream come true. He is going to relish each touch, each taste of this spectacular man while he is allowed.
“Black and gray?"
“Dean, you did nothing wrong. This was a decision that Cole made. A terrible decision, yes, but you didn’t make him do it. In fact, you’ve been a friend to him for years. Betraying our trust like this is an egregious violation.”
Cas grins. This is exactly the reaction he wants. Dean is held immobile in his pleasure, waiting for Cas to take the reins and give him everything.
“I love you, Dean. Please, Alpha. Please forgive me.”
“I’m sorry to ask this of you,” he whispered into Dean’s ear, suddenly filling with guilt, “but, Dean, I just ache, I feel so empty, please.”
A dull thud.
“Please,” he said.
But he’d tried to drown Castiel.
“But you almost died.”
An example of one of the Fell Creatures that wander the dark, the kind of thing you have to watch out for at night, especially during a Black Moon. A Fell Beast is a manifestation of darkness, demons can take on their true form sometimes as Fell Beasts, as their humanoid form can be somewhat limiting.
“We can call it whatever we want,” Cas reminds him. “It’s not like it’s going into any scientific journal.”
“You stay right there.”
“What?” Dean asked, still coming off the high of the scent and the feeling of Omega on his lap. God, Castiel was still astride him, arousing him even more.
Only a couple days to the Black Moon. Any other month, he’d be on his way to the lake.
Dean leans closer. “You have? What is it like?”
“Uh, Cas?” Jimmy said, confused, breaking them out of their reverie.
But there was no crying.
Castiel just stared at her. “Um.”
“The dust didn’t stop you!” Dean grinned.
“Go talk to him.” Alfie suggests with such sweet encouragement that Cas is seriously tempted.
“Hold still,” Dean said, gingerly grabbing his wounded leg. “I need to finish wrapping this.”
hear you. Do you want me to answer?” She chirped.
“You have no cloak of your own. I want you to stay warm. It would be my honor if you would keep it.”
Obediently, Dean drank up the potion, something green, but not altogether unpleasant. It felt so good in his throat, and he for some reason he couldn’t get enough of it. He was so thirsty all of a sudden.
Though that day seemed afar off, Dean drew closer to it every moment that he worked to gather more for the spell. As of right now, Dean had only collected one ingredient - horn of a golden stag, the easiest one to obtain. Besides a bit of information on the rarer pieces, that was all he’d accomplished in one month.
“You’re going to give me ideas if you keep looking at my mouth like that,” Castiel grins.
“Of course, Cas. Whatever you need. My quarters or…?”
“Let me try,” Castiel said, pulling Dean’s hand up to his face and licking the remaining slick from it, sucking on his fingers to get every last drop.
Cas is right. He doesn’t trust himself to speak his mind. Quite honestly, he doesn’t even allow himself to create strong opinions about anything because his mind veers toward rebellion every time. Years ago, he realized that he was never going to make it in his career path if he didn’t stifle that part of him. Since he was a very young teenager, he’s forced his mind to maintain focus on the horizon line and float. The longer he’s been doing it, the easier it has become. Until Cas.
Setting down the knife with his now shaky hand, Sam tries to deny what his brother said. But that’s the real problem. Dean is absolutely correct. He would happily hang up his cleats for a seat in a classroom. Not only does education speak to his very soul, but it would allow him so much freedom. He could have the relationship he wants without others forbidding it.
As Castiel slowed down, Dean even was able to whip up a few little desserts for his spouse. Granted, they weren’t the most beautiful things in the world, but he knew for a fact they were delicious, and, judging by Castiel’s smile and the way his new tail curled while eating them, he thought so, too.
“Of course,” Dean said, spooning his mate close. Oh, he smelled so good, all wrapped up with him, lying on his bed, naked…
Quickly, Dean snapped out of his paralysis, leaning down to hold his mate, who was pathetically flopping on the floor, trying to move but completely at a loss as how to move without legs.
When he frowns, the other two share a look. Crowley continues, “Well, there was an incident in the crowd. It was handled professionally, so very few people are even aware it happened.”
The world was dark again.
Cas is there after all. Dean smiles as he sees his shadowy form appear behind him. He’s far enough back that Dean can’t see his features, just the chaos of his hair without his wig on. Dean loves the uneven, dark strands. When Cas told him he cut it himself to save money, Dean had spent yet another sleepless night. He’d bet that his sponsor spends at least ten thousand credits on Dean’s hair every month. Cas won’t even spend one.
Suddenly, Rowena flicked her wrist, and Dean’s body was instantly twisted, limbs and body contorting painfully.
That’s all he was now.
And he loved them, as he would his own family.
Castiel couldn’t stand - his legs were too frozen - so he pathetically crawled around to the far side of this large alcove.
“There it is,” Dean said with a smile, slipping a third finger inside and gently rubbing at that spot inside him even more.
The shape of the amulet is very important in wolf culture. In this case, the shape is meant to evoke that of a wolf’s tooth. This symbolizes both the protection of a sharp fang and the healing of a gentle tongue. The runes carved upon an amulet can emphasize this or add to it.    For blessings, a wolf (druids especially), would hollow out a part of the amulet and put enchanted herbs or dust or something meaningful inside to aid in the amulet in its purpose. In Dean’s case, it was blood, the most powerful of protection/healing magic (the giving of oneself for another). Also, in wearing it, Castiel would always have a part of Dean near him always.
“I really do.”
After a few hours, Cas held his Omega up, gently giving him a drink of water and feeding him the now cold soup. It was the best thing Dean’d ever tasted.
Dean awoke to a loud, frantic pounding on his door, making him jump out of his sleep and instinctively reach for his spear.
Cas held his mate tighter, burying his face in the space between his mate’s tawny wings as he moved faster. His mate had smelled so wonderful ever since catching; Cas could never get enough of his sweet scent.
Dean gave him a gentle smile, “You’re hungry.”
“No, Dean. Some things cannot be changed.”
“But you can only see him on a Black Moon?”
“And your mother?”
“Let’s not ruin this sweet moment with the realization of how awful morning breath is.”
“Cas?”
Dean gives him a wobbly smile. “If I freeze, just push me.”
“That was true when the structure was erected and was still true until about fifty years ago. That’s my best guess anyway.”
Push.
“I’ve always hated these things,” Dean confesses. “Now, they really freak me out. I had no idea they were dangerous to other people.”
“Fuck no,” Cas replies, but ends his tirade. They walk together towards the tube lift slowly. A minute or two later, Cas stops him with a hand on his arm.
He’s been in various states of undress with his valets, but this is the first time he’s offering his body to anyone. He knows his body is beautiful to look at. He works insanely hard to keep it this way. It is still difficult to allow this vulnerability.
The Omega took a deep breath. “I’m going to help you, Dean.”
A glimmer of life.
“No, Dean, it’s real, I’m here,” Cas tried, but Dean wouldn’t stop muttering the phrase over and over, whole body quivering with fear.
Castiel gasped. Dean’s cock was so much
“Cas, what’s wrong?”
“Come on, Dean, push!”
“I think of you to the exclusion of everything else lately.”
Cas rolls his eyes. “I live here. Unlike those of the upper castes, though, I don’t have electricity, so I don’t have access to the Stream.”
But there’s someone he needed to talk to first.
Dean didn’t care, though; he had other things on his mind. He had a goal, had focus now. He knew what he wanted, and he wouldn’t need this pack much longer. After he freed Cas, he’d start a pack with him. He didn’t need all these people who, just a week ago, treated him like refuse.
But Castiel didn't return his gaze. His eyes were so unfocused, so dim, and the horrible gurgling croaks in his throat soon turned into the unmistakable sound of death rattles.
Dean almost came on that feeling alone, of his love’s tongue sliding across his fingers, of his warm, soft mouth and lips sucking on him.
Dean rose, rubbing the back of his neck as, suddenly, words didn’t form right in his mouth. “If you - if you need a bath there’s a hot springs through that, um,” he said, pointing towards the doorway, “through that way.”
“What’s wrong?” Dean barely breathed out, almost unable to think with his love on top of him like this.
“Don’t say that,” Castiel said, looking up at him. “I just need you to trust me.”
It was so dark. But it was so warm. And it smelled like Dean.
Does he care?
As quickly and as thoroughly as he could, he “polished” the wings up, almost unable to bear how turned on he was, it was all he could do to keep himself soft. He hoped the rumor that Angels could barely smell was true, because Dean was sure he smelled like a Naga going through puberty.
In the next, they hear the sounds of helos landing on the roof and an EMP shutting down all electricity in the house, including the locks on the doors. Peacekeepers shoulder through them, jockeying for position to be the one to take him down.
It was the pills that’d done it. He and Cas had been trying for pups and were having trouble, so Dean’d started taking fertility supplements. Must’ve fucked up his cycle.
“You know what I mean,” Dean purses his lips as he does when Cas annoys him.
Dean kisses him again, moaning at the touch of Cas’s tongue pressing into his mouth. Without any guiding being needed, Dean straddles his body, lowering himself to brush their chests together.
Shrugging his shoulders, he explains, “A little bit of everything. I sing, act, model.”
Oh no.
“He said that you must be blind.”
Dean never looked up from the ground. He merely heard Castiel’s footfalls as he left the den.
“There’s someone here to see you.”
“So far, I have cobbled together a decent kitchen and a comfortable place to sleep.”
“I’m insightful,” Castiel chirped.
Cas gently set his Omega down in the backseat, gingerly curling his legs up so he would fit. Despite Cas’s tenderness, the Omega still hissed in pain.
Dean took a deep breath, closing his eyes and blocking out the sound of the swamp, taking in deep breaths as his sensory tongue flicked in and out, searching for a heat mass, a warm spot, anything.
He pulled his brother’s head up.
Even while he’s receiving confirmation that Dean is one of the elite celebrities that are pitted against each other for their sponsors’ bragging rights, he forgets himself.
“I’m so sorry, Dean.”
Oh, god, it was so cold, it felt like their very bones were freezing solid.
“How did you get her to leave?”
“D-don’t let me stop,” he barely breathed out.
Dean’s beautiful, tired face resolves out of the deep shadows. Cas throws his arms around him, a sob that he didn’t plan sneaking out of him. Dean grips him even tighter; his lifeline. When they part enough to see each other’s faces, Cas leans in to kiss Dean.
They can’t swim. Because, if they do, wings get soaked, turning them into anchors, pulling them under. Drowning them.
“Will you undress?”
“Seriously? You heard them call me by name.” Dean says, scrubbing at his solid black hands.
“I have to, Dean.”
It wasn’t anything masterful, but it would have to do.
“How?”
“Do you have any family, people to look out for you?” he asked.
“Uriel, please just let me complete the shift?” He asks quietly, nausea bubbling in his throat at the thought of Dean hearing any of this conversation. “I won’t cause any problems. Just please.”
At that, Cas took his hand away from his Omega, who whimpered in protest. He lifted his hand up to his mate’s lips.
free me, Dean. You can’t,” he said, weeping quietly into his lover’s chest. “You need to give up on me. Please. I don’t want to hurt you anymore. Please. Please give up on me.”
Where was he? Where was his love?
“Keep me safe?”
No time to celebrate, though, as Castiel would need something more substantial - he needed meats, and quickly. Fortunately, having lived with soldiers for years, Dean knew how to whip up a quick and dirty Feast. He quickly set to finding meats to cook, as well as a few other quick and necessary things, and rushed back to his room, where he set about cooking over his fireplace. Normally, he’d cook in the kitchen, but he wanted to keep an eye on Castiel, and by now Dean could cook over just about anything hot.
Tenderly, Dean licked up the little droplets of the Moon God’s blood, kissing the new mating mark he bore.
Then he couldn’t move.
Cas’s hands go numb, allowing the tray full of drinks to wobble a bit before he gets it under control.
Cas can’t leave it there. He has to take it away from someone too ignorant or careless to own such a piece of history. Because the Roman Industries complex is typically under intense security, tonight’s party and its open door policy, is the only real opportunity Cas has to grab the endangered painting. So, despite not enough research and the presence of at least a hundred wealthy Jinushi witnesses, Cas is going to take the painting.
They are quiet as they change back into their respective uniforms, taking last kisses from each and giving them in return. Who knows how long it will be before they can be alone together again. Dean nods and Cas engages the magnetic tube that will bring them to the sprawling mansion Dean calls home.
“No,” he repeated mindlessly, rocking his beloved in his arms. Dean was limp and cold in his grasp, motionless wings rustling against the floor of the nest. Their nest. The one he’d made especially for his precious mate. His Dean.
Castiel gasped. “I can see pictures in some of them!” he said, focusing on one of his shoulder blades. “This one looks like Duneyr.”
“You could say that.”
The look on Dean’s face tells him that he isn’t making the connection, so he gives him a little nudge by lowering one of his fingers below Dean’s heavy balls until he rubs the knot of muscle. That makes Dean practically levitate off the bed. He rolls over, away from Cas’s errant fingers and holds his gaze with wild eyes.
That glorious toothy grin makes Cas’s heart pound. “Yes, we will.”
“Hm, good point,” Megara said, thoughtfully.
“It warms my heart to think that you are willing to show it to me,” Dean comments and then hums his appreciation when Cas nudges his head out of the way so he can plant kisses down the side of his neck.
Cas nibbles his bottom lip and takes in his potential conquest. They are of the same caste. There’s nothing stopping him from talking to a stranger. It’s not as common now that most people meet with an introduction, but it’s definitely not outlawed. He feels like he has to at least take a chance.
Dean’s scandalized sputtering is exactly what he’d been wanting, but it still makes him feel a little bad. It’s bad form to rub salt in that particular wound. He and Dean have never talked about sex because it isn’t appropriate for their caste. They aren’t allowed to date, or to be in the presence of a woman alone unless they are family members. Again, Sam is afforded so much more leniency than Dean. He’s had fans that offered to show him the ropes, so he lost his virginity while he was still an undergraduate student. He has a healthy sex life, even though he isn’t allowed to pursue a relationship, which is what he really craves.
Eggs.
The tree shook.
The wolf ran his hand through his hair with a sigh. “I know. I just, I wanted to protect them. Protect my brother. And I couldn’t.”
Castiel leaned his head back, already so enraptured by his gentle touches. At last, though, he managed to say, “I want your knot.”
“I need a valet. I came to you tonight to ask for a reference. After what happened with Cole, I am having a difficult time trusting someone new. I trust you, so I would trust someone you recommended. But, this would be so much better, Cas.”
An unfamiliar choking filled the Omega’s throat as the first light of dawn glowed at the den’s entrance.
“Castiel? What the hell kind of name is that? Sounds Fae.”
Castiel himself was confused by the feeling, but not unhappy. He’d been astounded at how much he’d eaten, but it felt so right, and how that he felt so full, it felt so
“Dean?”
Cas didn’t respond.
Cas went back to eating, a blush kissing his cheeks, somehow making him even more beautiful.
Sam ponders a life with Eileen. A life where they are free to marry, have children, and live a simple, happy life. It’s his every dream come true.
“I’m sorry to be the bringer of bad news, but we will need to get ahead of the news cycle and provide a video message.”
“I am somewhat aware.”
Dean has learned a certain kind of Zen during these long hours in a makeup chair. After all, he can’t read, they get rather frustrated if he tries to talk, and the only thing that they play on the vidscreens anymore are commercials. He doesn’t need or want anything, so there’s no conceivable reason to watch them.
At least he didn’t have to carry it all; he could leave some of it at Megara’s turfhouse for safekeeping, with the horn he’d left there a couple days ago. But not all of it. He didn’t trust her with the rarer items.
Who was Castiel?
“Drink. It will dim the heat.”
“Yes, I did.”
“Cas?” He called out, the knocking bringing him to a panic.
God, he was so cold. And trembling.
“Yes. They look nearly starved.”
But what really shone were the runes carved along its rim:
“Keep it,” Dean said, eyes to the snow-covered ground to grant the frail, naked Omega some privacy.
But, they only have a little more time here before they must head back, and they have to return to Kanpeki Basho late tonight. He wishes that they had more time here, but it is imperative that Dean’s comings and goings stay under the proverbial radar. The longer he is silent, the more people will question his location.
Sam appreciates that Cas has become a member of their family, but he aches to make Eileen one too.
“What?” he said, utterly confused as he looked down at his left arm.
He was going to do it. He was on his way.
Castiel froze for a moment in shock, before warming up at the feeling of Dean gently nuzzling into his shoulder. “I must say I’m surprised to find you here. I was sure you’d forget, or not bother.”
Gakusha: “Academics”
And, for the first time, he’d been given a glimpse of what he could have had, the life they could have shared. And he wanted it. With all his heart, he wanted it.
“It made me very angry to see him treat you like that.”
Shockingly, in the middle was what looked like a fire pit. It was perfectly round, with all kinds of sticks and leaves in it, still somehow dry. Though it was half rotten.
He could just cry as the world grew dark. So very dark.
“Come here, Cas.” His words are a request, not a command, and Cas moves closer without thought. At the same time, Dean scoots up to sit with his back against the wall. Cas straddles his lap again, surprised at how calm Dean is now.
Jimmy had no time for such pleasantries, however. “Why are you helping us?”
The figure appeared lost in thought as he ran his gaze up and down the Alpha wolf’s body. “I very much doubt you are the sort to be led anywhere against his will.”
He might be Sabanto now, but his parents were Shokunin, skilled workers. Aside from giving him an education which no Sabanto has a right to, his parents taught him a great deal about the world beyond the borders of this sanitized dome. He longs to leave one day, but he needs more than just the desire to leave. He needs a means of survival, and those resources are far out of his reach for now. So, he contents himself with planning, saving, and relieving the occasional treasure from the hands of those that would ruin them.
Dean immediately tried to move back, held close by Castiel’s grip. Even when he tried to move his hips away at least, Castiel pulled plush up against him, belly against Dean’s hardening arousal.
“I wish to speak to the druid,” he said to the wolf guarding the turfhouse.
“…Yes.”
“How did you come back?”
Cas barks out a belly laugh. “Maybe a little bit of both. I do know that the outside world is habitable. I’ve been out there frequently.”
in Castiel’s wing oil. And that his wing oil smelled
Castiel whimpered. “Please give up on me.”
Cas shakes his head ruefully. “No, but with enough money, we could gather everything we need before we go.”
“Why are you up so late?” he asks as he flops gracelessly on an oversized leather sofa. The cool, smooth texture is tempting to lay his face on. Samuel has several books open on the research table he claimed for his own back in grade school. Dean has never wanted to challenge him for the seat. He prefers the small conservatory upstairs. Its soundproof walls and view of the gardens are perfect for practicing his music.
Dean wasn’t there.
“I love you so much, Castiel. With all my heart. I know, I know that you probably don’t want to mate. And that’s alright. Just so long as we can be together.”
“Pleased to make your acquaintance,” she said, mockingly.
Suddenly, the grip on Dean’s veins was released, and the wolf fell limply into the water as the pain of his broken bones surged over him.
They put tranqs in his IV. He needed rest.
“You did all this for me, precious wolf. And all I did was hurt you. I don’t blame you if you decide not to forgive me. I don’t deserve to be forgiven,” he said as he stripped off all the gifts the wolf had given him. The pants, the jacket, and the cloak, laying them neatly on the bed.
“Thank you,” Cas choked out.
Suddenly, claws buried themselves in his shoulders, ripping Dean backwards with sore-covered wings. The wolf roared in anger, spearing the beast and rushing forward to clutch his beloved once more, but more and more creatures kept grabbing him, latching onto his limbs, pulling him back, laughing maniacally. He kept fighting, flailing wildly with his arrow, but more kept on coming, before finally tearing the arrow from his grasp.
Fortunately, Dean understood his voraciousness, setting them all down beside him as Castiel greedily dug in.
Cas patiently explains the wood stove in the cabin with a smirk to his lips.
“Dean…”
“…Yes,” he whispered, holding Castiel tightly. “Oh, yes, little one.”
“Rowena?!” Dean said, looking up at the redheaded woman in front of him.
“Is that what you’re doing? You’re flirting with me?” Dean sits up straighter, his voice tightening in alarm. He isn’t angry, but Cas can sense his discomfort that is bordering on fear.
“Yes.”
The room was decorated with various shades of deep red and furnished by one large bed in the center. Various implements hung on the walls. In front of the bed was a pillow, and on it, kneeling, was an Omega. He was completely naked, head bowed low. The omega was utterly emaciated; you could count the ribs in his chest. There were bruises all over him, and several cuts. He was shivering. But not from the cold. No, judging by the line of trackmarks on his arm, he was strung out.
“Feeling better?” Cas asks, trying not to sound smug or teasing.
Dean looks over his shoulder to see his valet, best friend, and lover. “You’re awfully sneaky.”
The strange wolf pinned Dean against the tree, going for his throat with teeth bared. Before she could rip into his neck, though, he stabbed her in the belly with one of the arrows, growling at her.
“What do you want with me?” he said as more footsteps gathered about him.
“Please…” Dean whispered between sobs. “Please, stop.”
“Fuck, you’re gorgeous.” Cas murmurs into his ear as his head sags against his shoulder. Dean is sweating with his exertions, panting in between tender kisses along Cas’s chest.
The wolf shrugged. “I doubt that. You however seem quite suspicious.”
Dean didn’t care, though. Megara knew the steps to breaking Castiel’s curse, and that’s all that mattered. “What else?”
Upon eating as much as he could, he fell asleep nuzzled close in his Alpha’s arms. Cas held him the whole time.
He has managed to find his way to the kitchens of the complex, hoping to find a way into the interior of the building without drawing attention to himself. The obvious choice would be to don the uniform of one of the Sabanto that are serving food at the party. But, then he would have no reason to be in the other parts of the building. If he was found on one of the upper floors, he would have no viable alibi. Watching from one of the dry pantries, Cas worries his lip while he studies the bustle of people coming and going through this junction. Suddenly, the perfect answer arises.
“Kind of, but much worse.”
Dean looks up, stopping to observe the waving, undulating leaves which are close to his size. He never would have believed that organisms this big existed, even after Cas had showed him proof that giant animals called dinosaurs once roamed the planet. It’s just something that has to be seen to be comprehended. The sunlight peeking between the leaves above dances elegantly and causes the leaves to flicker between multiple shades of vibrant green.
“Please.”
And no matter what it took, he was going to break it. Just the thought of Castiel under a curse was enough to break his heart. He had to get to him now. Had to set him free.
Her body broke his fall, at least, but he still hit the ground hard, and his throat was still pouring blood. He barely had enough energy to roll off her.
Cas knows he’s pushing. He should apologize and head to his room for the night; give them both some space to cool down. Instead, he reaches out and touches Dean’s arm, running his thumb over the material in question.
Cas stops and looks up at Dean. “Do you think we will?”
“I’m fat now, you gotta be gentle with me.”
“Can I see you?” Dean asks when he next breaks away.
The cut was supposed to glow with grace. But it barely flickered. Dean didn’t even react to the wound beyond a weak shudder.
“We’ll take it slow. Let me know if you’re dying.” With those words, Cas sucks his middle finger into his mouth, playing with it in and out, letting the innuendo carry to Dean and keep the flames burning hot. The next time Cas takes the length of Dean into his mouth, one hand drops lower and rubs over Dean’s little puckered hole.
He’s thought about his cock being in someone else’s hand. Well, Cas’s hand. It’s a favorite fantasy of his, mostly because he can’t imagine what else men could do together. As he considers it, he pulls the tie on his sarong and lets it drop to the floor.
“No!” Dean shouted. “He’s not evil! He’d never be evil. He’s just cursed.”
The wolf smiled. “What are you doing out here on your own?”
“God of Families?” Castiel said, remembering the inscription.
“An unauthorized entry occurred, but it was in the sauna. You’re perfectly safe.”
“Can you make it?”
“Don’t say that.”
He took a breath. “Are you alright?”
“Dean?” he asked as his mate’s gaze grew distant, cloudy.
Taking a few steps inside, the dark is utter and complete. He hears scuffing footsteps as Cas walks around behind him. With a click, he sees a flame to his right and sees Cas holding a lighter flame to the first of several simple candles.
Dean gasped for air, his body fully healed as he woke, eyes brightening and color flushing his cheeks.
Dean finally opens up about finding Cole in Sam’s room, snooping through his belongings. The news is highly distressing, considering that his personal tablet carries several juicy bits of information that he does not want to become public knowledge. Most of them involve only him and his choices, but he would hate for Eileen to somehow get dragged into a scandal. Her options in life are already unfairly stacked against her.
He was here. In Heaven. Had been for four months.
*****
Dean was in heat. And he needed to get home. Now.
Oh, god. The Castiel’s scent was so perfect, so wonderful. He couldn’t help but bury his nose in the Omega’s throat to inhale more of its heavy ambrosia. He always wanted to smell that scent. Forever.
“You don’t seem mindless to me, Dean,” Castiel smiled.
The perfect innocence of this man is making Cas feel all sorts of things that he shouldn’t. It should not make him feel this fiercely protective of someone he just met, for instance. Okay, he’s always been partial to the underdog in every story he’s ever read, but that doesn’t mean he is Dean’s savior, come to break him free of an emotionless existence.
“Watch out!” he said, rushing to Castiel’s side to catch him when he lost his balance. “Here, sit down until you feel stronger,” he said, guiding Castiel back to the bed to sit on. He weighed so little, like he was made of sticks. It made Dean want to feed him, make him strong.
“Oh, so it’s a no, then! Well, you’re in for a treat.”
“Cas!” he heard his wolf shout, but he seemed so very far away, or so close, or echoing around him, he wasn’t sure.
“So how is it?” Pamelia said, walking up to the other side of the thin creature that merely looked up at them with bright blue eyes, struggling to breathe. It seemed to be trying to speak.
He reached up to a small niche in the wall, pulling out the flint and crawling back to the pit, frantically trying to light the tinder with his shaking hands.
With a snap of his meaty fingers, Crowley waves a cameraman over. Dean looks up at the camera and waits for his cue.
“Nothing, Sam. Everything is fine. I just got home and I can’t wrap my head around all of this.”
Dean pouts, trying to coerce Cas back to him, but he is emphatically denied. It’s probably a good thing that Cas can resist him, but it just makes Dean want to try harder next time. Suddenly, it is imperative that he find something that Cas can’t resist. With his thoughts following that lovely path, he slides out of bed to make himself presentable. If he wears a shirt that is at least a size too small, and lounge pants that hang precariously off his hips; that’s fine. That’s what he had planned to wear even before the revelations of last night.
Due to scent of the oil and the fact that his fantasies now had a
“Here,” the wolf replied, forcing himself to look away as he shrugged the cloak off his shoulders to offer the poor Omega.
“Dean! Dean, are you alright? What do you need?” Dean’d had pains all throughout his pregnancy, and whenever he did, Cas would help in any way he could.
“Be reasonable,” Cas scoffs.
Dean huffs out a curse, his eyes glazed with a fucked out interest that makes Cas puff up with pride. That thought immediately brings him to wondering how wrecked he could make Dean. What glorious, nasty things would Dean find pleasurable? A few images flit through his mind, pushing him towards the finish line. Just then, Dean licks a broad stripe up his neck and nips at his earlobe.
Dean sits cautiously, hesitating to let it take his full weight. “It’s safe. It’s sturdier than it looks.”
“The demon must have been after you, too, though. Is it still tracking you?”
“Is there a free table where I can wait?”
“Castiel?” Dean yelled, turning around once more, searching for those large, beautiful wings.
However, when he came to his senses, he realized something very important.
“Dean!”
“But that’s expensive.”
He cried out in despair.
Rowena rolls her eyes at him and then speaks sweetly to Dean. “My dear, I would never compromise your modesty. Of course you will be surrounded by screens. You may choose to have your valet assist you or dress on your own.”
Taking the knife out of his hand, Dean sets it aside and looks at Cas with intention. His desire, his affection, his need to be closer to Cas, all work together to halt Cas’s complaints before they begin. Dean cups his cheek gently, tilting it to just the right angle. His lips glance across Cas’s before his tongue begs entrance. Unhurried, uncaring of their surroundings, they get lost in each other. Kissing until their lips are chapped and bruised, Cas leads them back to the bed.
It was a simple thing. Crudely polished bone, inlaid with a fair green stone.
“Race preference? Hair? Eyes?” The attendant said, cheeriness dripping from his lips.
“Of course,” Rowena said off-handedly as she snapped her fingers - and another one of his ribs.
Fascinated, Dean moves closer, trying to see the car underneath the vegetation. “How did they move?”
Shaking his head, he kisses Dean and tugs him towards the bedroom.
He needed to get Dean to a hospital. A torn Omega in heat was serious - without medical help, he could inadvertently maim himself without being able to help it. As it was, even if nothing like this had happened, by the end of heat Dean would be fucked almost raw. With a torn channel?
Castiel tilted his head. “Run with you?”
“Want to-” Dean gasps again, his legs trembling with pleasure. “Touch you.”
“You weren’t kidding.”
Castiel was the first to break, slowly pulling his head out of the water.
Oh, god.
“Which is your favorite?”
Suddenly, he gasped as Dean started to rub his finger along his entrance, jumping at the sudden contact.
“You can’t. You’ll die. They’ll rip you apart,” Castiel said, reaching to gently lift Dean’s chin to meet his gaze. “I’m so sorry for being so cruel to you, you don’t deserve that. If you don’t want to see or meet me next Black Moon, I’ll understand. You have a life to live here, a home to be made
Oh, god, no.
“I want to protect you always, Castiel,” Dean said, swallowing down his fear. “Because I always want to protect the things I love.”
“I’m sorry you lost them so young.”
The man smiles. Now that he is closer, Dean sees the rich blue color of his eyes. He’s never seen their equal.
Oh, god.
Because he’d been wounded fighting for them, the pack took care of him and fed him and let him sleep under a roof. But he was nothing but a burden now. Good for nothing. They wouldn’t let him do anything, as they still didn’t fully trust him. So now his life consisted of living in the den with the infirm and the elderly, shoved aside to be ignored.
Castiel screamed, clasping his head.
Below his face, his label.
“Please, Dean, please.”
The wolf shut his eyes for a long while. “Castiel,” he said, very gently, holding his love’s chin in his hand, finally opening his eyes to meet the Omega’s own. He had such beautiful blue eyes. “I’m weak and wounded. You know what that means.”
Which was a good thing. Dean could live his life, be happy. Castiel could no longer ruin it. Dean could have his family, his joy, have pups, enjoy the world. This was a
It wasn’t long before Castiel had enough of the soup, so Dean hung it back over the fire just in case he wanted more later. When he came back into the den, he found Castiel, wrapped only in his bearskin cloak, trying to stand on slender, wobbly feet.
“You may speak freely.”
The figure giggled. “I am Castiel.”
“Please don’t be afraid of me, Dean. Please,” Castiel begged, his wolf’s actions like knives in his heart. But Dean wouldn’t respond, wouldn’t look at him for fear of angering him. Finally, the Moon God licked his lips, shoulders drooping, knowing from experience what he had to say.
“I’m sorry I didn’t build the fire closer to the lake shore, I didn’t think it would be safe so out in the open,” he said, leading him to the small clearing still glowing with the fire’s warmth and the sweet smell of cooking meat.
“Hey, hey. That’s not what I was implying. I’m happy to take you outside. I’m just arguing for some precautions and secrecy.”
In a last-ditched attempt at survival, he shoved her as hard as he could. Surprised at the move, she fell backwards off the branch.
Dean furrows his brow in confusion and the man tries a different tactic. “I’m Castiel.”
He clutched the arrow tighter. “I’ve got you Castiel. I won’t leave you. I’ll never leave you,” he prayed into his love’s now-deaf ears.
“Oh!” Castiel yelped in surprise, overwhelmed at the care he was being shown.
Dean thrived in Asgard. He protected and cared for his beloved while his mate rested there between his nightly flights, often passing between worlds to bring the god wonders from each realm to taste. They cherished each other, having many adventures by each others’ side, and together bearing nine strong pups to their name. Even against the darkness and evil that threatened Castiel and his precious pups in their weakness, Dean forever defended them with his own cunning and and magic and skill, so that his soul burned gold with light and love.
Minutes later, though, Dean spoke. “Did you mean that?”
Dean was in pain.
And then he felt Dean’s heart stop.
He nodded before reaching into his spell cabinet. As he touched the bottles within, dust fell from them, as he mixed what he needed into a small bowl. Upon finally completing the mixture, he sat beside his two little charges, holding the bowl to the one’s lips.
“That’s a lovely idea, Cas. I’m sure it will be wonderful.”
. He didn’t know how to explain it, but he could tell by looking at them how hot they were. He could smell the heat off of them, it was so strange.
They were so small and light. It made his heart ache.
The wolf seemed frozen at the action, unsure of what to do, what to feel, how to act. All he could understand right now was Moon God’s nearness. Castiel’s nearness. That, and the sweet, bright scent of his tousled hair. The same smell the wolf had fallen in love with almost a year ago.
Castiel looked down at the ground, lost in thought. “It's... complicated.”
“Shhh,” Cas said, taking a deep breath in an attempt to cool his instincts down even as Dean’s scent set them on fire.
“Where are we going, Cas?” It is killing him not to reach out and take Cas’s hand, but that would draw the attention of people around them, which could be deadly right now.
“Dean?” he asks, quietly enough that it sounds like a plea rather than a question.
Looking back and forth between Cas and his former boss, Dean’s eyes go wide and his mouth drops. “You fired him?” he finally accuses.
No, he wasn’t going to last long at all.
“Why? What do you want of me?”
This appears to be the very last straw for Dean. Cas has spent the past several hours challenging his every belief and overturning every undisturbed piece of his world to reveal horrible new realities that he is not prepared to deal with.
Dean is playing with bravado he doesn’t really possess. Humor has always been his coping mechanism when things feel out of his control.
His soul had almost forgotten what it was like to live, so long he’d wandered alone in the nothingness. It’d faded, given up, gone dark so long ago.
Cas chuckles and explains, “No, we don’t, but there are other openings that we can use.”
“Cas, really.”
“Yes, Dean,” he said with a whisper. “Yes, you may see me again.”
Obediently, Dean lapped at his Alpha’s hand, licking his palm and sucking at his fingers clean.
“I’m sure.”
Dean took a deep breath, forcing his hands not to wander as he held his beautiful, ex-Angel mate close. Castiel needed to properly rest after eating.
Her jaw was tight, and her eyes were deathly serious.
________________________
“Yes. Night during a Black Moon is very dangerous. And you… you look so helpless. I don’t want you to get hurt or killed.”
“We’re just a little farther from what I wanted to show you. Are you good to continue?”
Yet he dared to hope.
“No,” Dean whispered. “That’s not true. All things end, Castiel. You taught me that.”
Cas chuckles. “Not by much. You’re thicker.” He raises up on his elbows to watch Dean discover a man’s body for the first time. His body.
, but they looked… they looked
Cas laughs and then realizes that he’s laughing alone. The look on Dean’s face isn’t teasing. It’s open and innocent.
“Don’t be modest. It doesn’t suit you.”
The figure appeared lost in thought for a moment. “Yes,” he at last responded. “Yes, I am cold.”
The one was too lost to heat to even comprehend his words, the other could do nothing but shake his head pitifully.
Castiel let out a long, shaky breath, Dean’s gentle kisses making him weak, making him even more slick. He could feel its heat soaking the bearskin cloak beneath him as an ache coursed through his veins, an ache he’d never felt before.
“I’m sorry, Sam.”
“Oh, fuck, Cas, you’re so tight,” Dean breathed. “Have you done this before?”
“It’s for you, Cas,” he said, offering it to the Omega. Castiel took it gingerly from him and slowly draped it over his neck.
Castiel stopped.
There was a thump inside followed by a half-asleep, “Is something wrong? Are we under attack?”
Dean took a deep breath, smiling determinedly. “If you’re so sure,” he said with a growl. “Then come and get me.”
During his career, he’s never been allowed to write his own music. Sure, there have been promises and platitudes, but he isn’t stupid. The risk of him writing something that wouldn’t satisfy his fans is too great for his sponsors. It’s the same reason that they won’t let him choose his movie scripts or even his own clothes. He’s been their puppet, their doll to dress, for too long already. He doesn’t know how he’s going to get out of this life, but he has to. Somehow.
“You never would have been allowed this position if I didn’t trust you.”
Dean is reticent to leave the outside world and go back to the life that he always thought he wanted. Its shine has worn off, its appeal lost.
“Oh, don’t be stupid,” Megara said, loading her crossbow and rolling her eyes. “Only a demon or warlock would have enough power to heal a limb on a Black Moon. Besides, only evil things wander the world on such a night - it’s a wonder we haven’t encountered some by now!”
And, finally, he broke.
didn’t.”
“Yes, it is.”
“That is acceptable.”
He smiled down at them, rising again to put his instruments away before looking back at them.
And then there was light.
“How did they get to their destination if multiple cars used the same road at the same time? What navigated for them?”
“No,” he whispered, heart breaking in his chest, ripping apart.
His body on fully automatic. If he let himself feel anything, if he let himself crack, he’d just break down.
There he was. His pretty freckled face lined up with a bunch of others. He wasn’t smiling in the picture, and the twinkle in his eyes was gone.
When they leave to continue their journey, the monks present them with gifts. They give Cas a conch shell necklace on a silk cord. The conch is a sacred symbol that means having a fearlessness to share teachings and ideas. Dean is given a similar necklace, but his symbol is two golden fish that represent happiness and spontaneity that comes from freedom.
Once they were brought back to the lord, they would never be given the chance to escape again. They would probably be locked up for the rest of their lives.
As the Naga worked on backing himself up so he could lower himself more, the witch looked over at Cas, giving him a predatory smile. “Hiya there, songbird. Don’t see many legged people around these parts.”
“I…” Dean said, almost unable to absorb that was happening, but the scent of his beloved Omega couldn’t help but calm him, relax him. Couldn’t help but make him feel at home.
Cas lets Dean explore him at his leisure. Patient and content with Dean’s interest in him. After the third time that Dean asks permission to touch or kiss, Cas tips his chin up with one finger and promises, “I give you blanket permission to do whatever you want where I am concerned. Every touch you wish to give me will be welcome and appreciated.”
Dean hardly ever lets himself think about these things. He accepts their money, their patronage, and just lets his life run its course. All of the concerns that he shoves down and represses are for future Dean to deal with. It’s never bothered him before because there was never anything he wanted badly enough to question his path. Now? He wants something a thousand times more than any fame or career.
But he didn't have time to enjoy that. Because something was wrong.
“Cas?” Dean said, suddenly stiffening in his mate’s arms.
He couldn’t wait to meet them.
Cas let out a low groan.
Castiel was very quiet for a long time, lost in thought.
“What?” Dean said, mind still fuzzy.
But he didn’t get to finish.
When asked what they should do, Castiel would often ask for Dean to surprise him, and Dean would be enchanted by Castiel’s enthusiasm and delight at even the simplest things. What Dean saw his whole life as ordinary suddenly became magical with the addition Castiel’s boundless curiosity. The world became so much more alive, more vivid, with Castiel in his life.
And anyone who can wield it is not to be trusted.
“Dean, I can’t stay,” he said, pulling back to look his lover in the eyes. “I can never stay. I am bound to the cycle of the earth until the end of time. But, Dean, I- I should have known that such a pure, selfless, loving soul like yours would be Worthy.”
“Castiel, please!” he shouted upon reaching the lake. The calm, still, silent lake.
Castiel shook his head. “How could I
He knows that Dean will tease him for his vocabulary as he always does. Sure enough, right on cue, Dean smirks.
Finally, he looked up at the sky as the last rays of sunlight began to fade behind the mountains, and he howled mournfully up at the lightless, moonless sky.
Dean studies the menu that he doesn’t need because he’s already ordered. His fingers tremble at the thought of getting caught out after his curfew, but also alone and unprotected. His manager would have his head, and that’s before they found out why he was really here.
They had to find safety before that. Somewhere, they had to find safety.
So, one day, as he walked through the barren woods, among the remains of houses now dilapidated and grown over from over a century of disuse, Dean’s strength failed him, and he fell.
Because there’s something Dean didn’t know about Angels.
“If you’re hurting me I’ll tell you.”
“Yes. Please, Dean. Trust me.”
Cas clenched his jaw.
“I- I’m sorry I made you hate something you love, I-”
Dean growled. “I’m so useless, can’t even fuck me, I-”
And there he lay, the God of Togetherness, dying alone.
. All over the back of his wings and his scapulars was a persistent, incessant itch. And that would be bad enough, if it wasn’t also accompanied by a prickling pain, like thousands of tiny needles were jabbing into him.
Sam leans in, eyes widening in surprise. “Who is this friend?”
Cas’s eyes grew wet as his wolf, his lover, constantly broke down his every wall, his every defense.
He wants Dean; he wants him in a way that defies all reason. If he had his way, he would ask Dean to run away with him to the world outside this dome today. Together, they would live a simple life of complete freedom.
Dean let out a long groan.
Setting a kettle on the fire to heat the water, Cas takes a basket out back to see what he can harvest. The berry bushes are producing prodigious amounts of fruit right now, so he selects only the ripe and juicy ones. The tomatoes are heavy, pulling their branches low to the ground. Finally, a few squash are ready to be cut from the vine. He selects a large spaghetti squash to add to his basket.
“I stopped you from shifting. I’m sorry.”
Jimmy shook his head. “No, you must be a demon,” he said, clutching his crucifix.
Heat.
“If you’re a pretty Omega and you get kidnapped, scar your face. Scar it bad. That way at least you’ll be sold to a breeder.”
“Excellent choice, sir! Very popular. He’s currently in use, if you don’t mind waiting… twenty more minutes until the previous client’s time is up. Otherwise you can choose another.”
Dean clears his throat and tries to laugh it off with a shake of the head. “Nothing. It’s nothing.”
He was trapped.
He sighed. “You want to try?”
Dean has the grace to look away, but he isn’t forthcoming with any information.
But he was nowhere to be found.
“Cursed? What, so he’s some dark god only allowed to walk the earth during a Black Moon, and he wants free of his chains?”
At last, though, he pulled away, resting against the furs laid out behind him and staring vacantly up at the ceiling. “How long was I unconscious?” he asked, voice scraping his throat.
“Oh, Dean…” Castiel said, pulling away from the terrified wolf, heart breaking in his chest. At last, he just knelt submissively at the wolf’s feet, head lowered. “Forgive me for not telling you. I mean you no harm. Please don’t be afraid of me,” Castiel swallowed, before finally whispering, “Please don’t be afraid of me, Alpha.”
The brilliant grin Dean gives him makes his heart ache. “Thank you, Cas.”
“Hm?” Megara said, in the middle of mixing some potion. “I didn’t say anything.”
Dean still can’t get used to being invited, to being wanted, not like this. Intimacy with Cas is addictive. Dean craves his touch, wants to be in constant contact with him. He can’t imagine a time when the answer to that question would be anything but a resounding, “Yes, please!”
