,” he let his hands trail down Sherlock’s nape, slid them underneath his collar and along his neck to his shoulders.
John cleared his throat. “Just think about it... what if my first fears would have been confirmed, what if he
Greg's look at John softened a bit as he asked quietly, “Isn't that exactly what you already were… are?”
As in a daze, John was staring, all the reasons he initially came for forgotten, adrift in empty space, all grip on the world he once knew was lost.
until now. Perhaps because she had proven to understand Sherlock better than he had expected her to, shown that she knew him on a level far beyond just acquaintances would. Perhaps because he had seen in her eyes that she still held some affection for him but nonetheless supported him to find happiness elsewhere. However most of all, what shocked him into silence was her trust. As she had said
John was about to turn and leave the bathroom when Sherlock took a deep breath and looked at John from under his lashes.
Greg looked puzzled because he couldn’t quite follow the apparent mental leap. Shaking his head a little, he asked, “Sorry, mate, what?”
He had just entered the flat, getting back from his grocery shopping marathon. He had had to visit five (5!!) stores to get the most basic shopping done and he still hadn’t found any toilet paper. Same with the flour and eggs. So no pancakes or scrambled eggs for breakfast. He had been lucky to get hold of the last cans of baked beans in the second store he had been in and some toast, even if only the thin sliced one, in the fourth.
and sent me off to follow you to Battersea. When I saw you dance that day, for the second time by then, I understood though. 'The last time I'll abandon you'," John nodded, looking down at his feet. His insides felt twisted by sadness and hurt. It was merely a whisper when he continued, "why, Sherlock? I… I didn't understand. Still don’t... I kept asking myself what I had done wrong, what I could have done better. And then, when you… you wanted someone to make you feel alive and I thought it wasn’t me, I took a step back to give you space and…”
John wrapped his arm around him to hold him close and looked down to revel in the rare opportunity to watch a sleeping Sherlock—and started chuckling to himself. Grouchy, Sherlock popped his eyes open and glared at John.
And John, John had been sure. He knew Sherlock. He was the only one who knew who he really was… what kind of man he was. That was what John had thought. But now, he wasn't so sure anymore...
Finding himself a bit ridiculous, he took a deep breath and tried to consider what Sherlock needed him to do. Taking position backstage, so to speak, he peeked through the gaps into the actual club. It wasn’t much different from the club they had met in, a mix of dance floor, bar, dimly lit nooks and space for an audience. Probably they were all the same in some way even though they tried to stand out by ambience, music, themes, audience, level of luxury. But at the end of the day, it was all about the same thing—booze and sex. Admittedly, he enjoyed both those things for himself, but not related to Sherlock and clubs. Well, okay, not entirely true… Sherlock and clubs and he himself being
was even more fun.” A genuine warm smile had relaxed Sherlock’s features and John could detect traces of the easiness of their early days together. What the fuck had happened to them, John thought. They should just have run off together into the sunset that first evening and never turn back around. But that hadn’t happened, had it? What had happened was
By now more than a bit bored he called himself to attention, wondering if he should sneak over to the bar and get himself a drink. He hadn’t even averted his eyes from the stage for a fraction of a second, when a familiar sound of creaking wood and roaring wind pierced his attention. He spun around with a speed that almost gave him whiplash and all of a sudden his boredom had gone up in smoke. His heart pounded in his ears and his lungs decided to forego oxygen. Apparently with immediate effect on his brain, because… A case? Case, who? Other dancers? When? Where? He wouldn’t know…
John led the way, Mycroft in his wake. John was fidgety, didn't know what to do with himself. So he did the first thing that came to mind. Tea.
“Yes, true. There was love. But never like this.” He grabbed Sherlock’s chin and pulled it down to lock eyes with him. “I told you; it had been an escape. It had been an attempt to find some happiness. It never worked. But then they had never been
“I’m not authorised to give any further information.” And with that she returned to silence. Chewing her gum, she ignored John again.
“Was it?” Sherlock looked at him incredulously. “Considering the case is about a territory feud between the self proclaimed head of the business and the old-established community of procurers…” he went off on a rant.
“So, yes, if you want you could say I’m not very experienced with this...” For the first time Scott sounded a tad insecure then.
Fuming, he stomped through the corridors, people shying away from him without him noticing. Being left in the dark like this was simply not on. And it hurt more than just a bit to be dismissed like that, too. He felt like a pouting kid, from whom someone had snatched away his favourite toy.
The eloquent silence that followed spoke volumes. But both brothers feigned indifference and refused to acknowledge the unspoken communication. Just before the seesaw of their immature game of power threatened to tip over, Mycroft gave in and spoke again.
By now, he had an inkling where this evening would lead to, but he had absolutely no need to let that happen. If this was the glorious idea Mike has had then… no, thank you very much.
Everything seemed out of context, out of place and Sherlock felt utterly lost in between the overwhelming amount of John around him.
“You’re an idiot, declining that offer even though you desperately want out of that depressing and boring flat of yours!” Scott exclaimed, agitated, angrily even. Why was he so passionate about it? Who was he to berate John like that? “Why not grab that chance? It could turn out just fine, even if that… bloke... might be a freak. And what gave you that silly idea that you wouldn’t be suited to share a flat with someone?” Was he honestly scolding John now? John was rendered speechless. “I’m fairly certain there would be at least one person in the London area who’d be delighted to have you,” Scott added matter of fact. As if he’d know! He knew shit about John and his fucked up life. How dared he lecture John about what to do?
"Because I do! Just because… it's you. I did from the first moment we met, even though you gave me enough reason not to. But I knew it, Sherlock. I
John, was back. At Baker Street. Back to living with Sherlock Holmes, as the man's flatmate and as the best friend of the brilliant, charming, annoying, absolutely mad and most human human being he has ever known. Because as far as John was concerned, the… arrangement… with Sherlock was definitely permanent. Separation or no.
“So… and now you extended your… vocabulary… to being boned like animals or what?” John asked, still a bit out of breath, wiping tears from his cheeks, uncontrollable giggles sneaking in.
Sherlock didn‘t even realise he was moving until the fresh May air hit his face. The moment he stepped on the pavement, he remembered his coat still hanging upstairs, but never mind, he definitely would not go back for it now. And the spring sun warmed the air enough to not freeze anymore after all. All he wanted was to leave everything behind. Away from Baker Street, away from 221B, from John, from arguments, from abominable feelings.... he groaned and gave a strangled frustrated cry at the thought, and made an older woman passing him jump. He only gave her a moody glare and she hurried away.
He shuffled in the direction of the sofa, nearly getting his feet tangled in the towel on the ground, and picked up his phone. Shuffling back to the kitchen, the clothes got strewn bit by bit across the living room floor.
John swallowed, intentionally not avoiding Sherlock’s questioning gaze. Alright then, he had seen it coming. But even then, digging deep to wake the buried ghosts took the kind of courage that was never honoured with a shiny medal. At best, afterwards, one was no longer haunted; rewarded with one burden less to carry.
,” Eyes locked with Sherlock’s, John took a step back, easing the pressure on both their trapped and stirring cocks and popped the button through it’s hole. The hiss of the first zipper teeth letting go of each other pierced the quiet as if amplified by the gravity of the moment. Sherlock swallowed, never avoiding John's eyes, a flicker of shyness in his otherwise devouring gaze.
But her only reaction was a grin spreading her lips and her hands sliding down his lower arms. She loosened his grip, laced their fingers together and raised his hands to her mouth. A hint of a kiss blown onto his trembling fingers and she lowered them again to place them on both sides of her hips.
“On crime scenes during the cases, talking to clients and suspects, you’ve shown your jealous streak as well, mind you. Only then, it was more a kind of being proud. Of me. Of calling me yours.” Sherlock squinted his eyes, seeking for confirmation, a faint tint of red colouring his cheeks. “True, you lashed out at everyone who came too close or threatened me with words or deeds and defended my honour. Although, it felt more like your way to show me off.” Sherlock huffed a small laugh.
"Not everyone of course, there're always new players in the game, but most of them I've met before. The community of the scene is much smaller than one would think. People know each other. And I'm certainly not one of the players that is easily forgotten." Sherlock said more to himself than to John.
“But… what about Molly?” He asked, a bit sceptical now. How could John not have thought about her until now? He knew exactly why though. He had been too perplexed. Not that he had any problems with it, but seeing Mycroft Holmes in such a state of agitation had been an experience on a heretofore wholly unknown level. And Greg? Flirting this boldly? Above all, with… well…
He turned and slammed his empty tumblr that hard on the bar that he was certain the clang of glass on wood would echo through the entire club. He already headed for the door, torn between fleeing the scene and not wanting to leave Miss Pirate to the apparently immensely appealing Mister Military.
"What if one of us needs some distance; just physical or... otherwise. If it takes longer to sort than just a walk in the park could achieve.” Sherlock swallowed. He didn’t want to imagine it, but it was likely to happen, better talk about it now than when it is too late.
When John had agreed to go out for dinner it was mostly an attempt to get out of the prison that was his own head. He hadn't taken into consideration that there wouldn't be anything to do but talk while they were sitting together over their food.
However, while munching on his cereal after he had conquered the journey from his bed over to the kitchen counter and then to the chair at his kitchen table — which all in all took approximately 5 steps — he couldn't shake the weird sensation of feeling content.
“So, does that mean there will be another vague suggestion of violating animals?” Scott asked just as seriously. He really did mean it, it seemed. That guy… Did he live under a rock? Well, where
Making her way through the paths between the tables and chairs of her silently begging admirers, she kept glancing at John as often as possible and John’s muddy mind tried to figure out the reason. Suddenly stopping in the midst of her stroll, she just stood there facing John, looking at him. He almost jumped up to elbow his way through the crowd to get to her because obviously there was something wrong, but before he could get his body moving he froze and his stomach dropped.
Shouting out John’s name for the entire neighbourhood to hear Sherlock came into John’s mouth. Buckling over, his legs turned to jelly and his belly muscles spasming, Sherlock nearly collapsed while John tried to swallow away spurt after spurt of his semen. The moment Sherlock’s orgasm ebbed away John dumped the trimmer, tried to guide Sherlock to the floor next to him as best as possible while simultaneously reaching for his own belt. Breathing harshly, hand trembling, he one-handedly fumbled to get his flies open while holding a limp detective in his other arm. The zipper wasn’t even lowered completely yet when John impatiently pushed the waistband of his pants out of the way. He hissed sharply when suddenly a chilly big hand reached for his dick, pulled it out and wrapped tightly around it.
can put one and one together… with you staying with me and being gloomy as fuck, he not answering his phone and such...” Greg said running his fingers up and down his glass gathering the drops of condense.
“Good… well… where was I?” John tried to buy himself some time. Why did he even hesitate this much? Greg was a friend. Someone who listened. But John found he actually didn't really know what to say. How could he speak words that hadn't taken shape in his own mind yet?
“Yes, of course, I know you have all the right to be angry. With me only ever burdening you, letting you down. I should have helped you… after Mary… let you do whatever you wanted to do. Not make you… Maybe I shouldn't have come back… And then afterwards and now… taking to old habits.” Sherlock winced a bit.
He had seen this before, several times. Sherlock playing his violin to be able to think, to process. As an outlet for his emotions. Only, he had never thought he would be the reason for it at some point. Or, in hindsight, hadn't he taken Sherlock's playing for what it was? Sherlock had said, or rather the songs they shared these days had, that he wanted a second chance. So had Sherlock, just as John, missed his first one?
Ha! John was one to talk after that irritating phone call earlier. As if he knew anything about all the research Sherlock had done just for him, especially for his well-being.
As if that was reason enough Sherlock turned and leaned backwards against the sink, his hands holding him up steadily, his legs spread wantonly. He looked down at John, who waited for a confirming nod before he sank the trimmer in the dark nest of curls around the base of Sherlock’s cock. When the hum and the buzz of the device vibrated against Sherlock’s erection his knees buckled slightly and a drop of precome slowly dribbled down the slit and the underside of the glans. Without thinking, John leaned in and caught the droplet with his pointed tongue, flicking the sensitive frenulum on its way.
Bent forwards he buried his hands into his curls, he clenched his fists, pulled hard. He wanted to tear his hair out, his scalp, his brains.
“Oi! Gregory Lestrade!” John shouted while turning and flinging one of the cushions at the man, who was full on laughing now. “What kind of friend are you?” He tried to sound offended but had to laugh himself.
Along the walls, the room was lined with rectangular pillars on both sides, which parted into some adjoining spaces lying in the dark, from which Sherlock now emerged into the light.
Short, denims, plaid button down, neatly trimmed blond fringe shimmering golden in the incoming light.
"It's all proper English, John. But if it is, as to be expected, straining your mental abilities to file away this basic information, I'll think of a more suitable method to communicate some of the items I might require."
"And then you happened." John shrugged a bit bashful. "You just came barging in my life, pulled me along, made no demands. And, yeah… you saw me. Like no-one ever had."
He propped the disc into the front pocket of his violin case. Closed the zipper. Patted it once, his hand lingering for a moment on the rough fabric.
Well, yelling via text message may not have been one of his most brilliant ideas. Who could blame him suffering like this? After all, if John hadn't looked at his phone the first time, the yelling wouldn’t have any effect either. Annoying that! At this moment he would very much prefer yelling at John face to face! Or? No! Better not!
"If you don't want me to act like a prostitute," he growled dangerously and lifted himself up, "then stop treating me like one." he hissed and slammed himself down forcefully, making their skin slap, forcing all air out of John's lungs in one sharp exhale.
the case, I can’t be completely sure of course,” Sherlock teased back. John dared to look up at him, now that there was no need to hide anymore, and was relieved to find a playful smirk on Sherlock’s lips and his eyes warmly looking back at him. Just as gently he said, “Although, I’m quite certain I’m not familiar with it.”
"Sherlock…" John moaned, "you know what I mean." But Sherlock just kept doing what he was doing which was driving John crazy. "The texts, come on… can't read them like this…"
"Oh, I fully intend to, sweetheart, I really do.” The man in the dark laughed lunatically. “But will
His joints were refusing to flex, to bend, even though they did all the time - unable to hold him up, unable to provide any support. His muscles sore, no strength left, cramping, acidic. They felt almost etched away.
The violin sounds getting more and more distinct, John could tell the melody Sherlock was playing was unfamiliar to him. Naturally he didn't know his entire repertoire, that'd be impossible, but he recognised that this wasn't one of their favourites. It was beautiful though, heartfelt, but at the same time it was sad, sounded torn, wavering, alternating, between slow and rushed, loud and hushed. Sherlock was playing sad music. John remembered another time when Sherlock had played sad music. Now he wondered if he had interpreted it all wrong. On the one hand he hoped he had, on the other hand deep regret settled in his bones about all the missed opportunities, about all the time that had passed.
He felt himself being washed away by the music, thrown on the shore and pulled back into the deepest waters. His body and his soul were torn back and forth, turned, tumbled.
“Of course, right, I see…” John laughed. He really didn’t know why this sort behaviour was only ever acceptable of Sherlock—even if it actually wasn’t, but he couldn’t help it to find it as endearing as he found it infuriating. And of course the bastard was fully aware of that.
“Doctor Watson.”, he said as a farewell as he closed the buttons of his suit jacket and opened his door. Without any sign of acknowledging John, he addressed the driver and said: “Please give Doctor Watson a ride. I expect you know where to.” With a final hum he left the car and John found himself once more left behind. What was this cryptical talk meant to be about? John felt a mix of emotions surge through his body - anger and confusion, indignity and by now also just naked fear. Life-changing decisions? '
A sad huff. Sherlock was still staring at the tabletop. John squeezed his hand a tiny bit, whispered “hey” to gain his attention, but Sherlock only shook his head no.
All air was forced out of his lungs in a rush, carrying a faint “Sherlock” with it. The buttons of his shirt were pressed painfully against his chest, as Sherlock was leaning against him with his entire weight and pushed him flush against the surface.
I carried it all the way up the stairs! I am of the opinion that you, too, can contribute a bit to our shared household duties!”
Oh no. He hadn’t, had he? Holy Hell! This couldn't be true. He could never go back to Baker Street, he’d have to live under a bridge! Preferably somewhere in Africa so Sherlock wouldn’t find him! Although, if he hadn’t told Sherlock… things… during that call, it would be most unfortunate to make all the efforts to move to Africa for nothing. Problem was—there really was only one way to find out.
“Love, I don’t think it’s good for anything really.” John had shaken his head at his nutter of a boyfriend.
He knew they’d done it. They’d taken the first hurdle. The biggest one, because from here on it was merely looking for the right path. But at least they were facing the same direction. They’d go that path together. That’s all that counted. They’d get there.
"Operator?" John asked, amused. God, who was this guy who seemed to know everything but had no clue at the same time. For clarification he added, "Not what I mean."
"Not what I mean," Sherlock huffed. "The dancing was quite intense and… dusty." Sherlock looked up at John and added a bit embarrassed, "Also, I'm afraid I might smell a bit."
But was she a she? Or a he? Or something else altogether? He decided he didn’t care. This person currently captioning all his senses was the most gorgeous creature, the most fascinating human being he had ever seen in his whole life. Who cared what label they gave themselves?
Maybe deciphering his thoughts on his features, maybe not caring at all, maybe just to continue their game, the Pirate lent forward, increasing the pressure on their cocks.
Sherlock took several deep breaths, letting them out in a rush, suspiciously resembling a sob. But before John had a chance to take a closer look, to act, to approach him, Sherlock turned away from John and dove back into his dance.
They stood there for a moment neither of them knew or cared about how long it lasted, frozen in time and space, just looking at each other, sharing the bubble that enclosed them.
"Then I think," John said slowly, as if waiting to be contradicted, "we need some help to get moving, yeah?" John gently peeled Sherlock's hand from the phone. "And now… we're both here. We can ask. We can explain. We can stop…" winking he gestured to Sherlock, indicating that he had already made use of that option. "There shouldn't be any more misunderstandings, if we don't want it."
"Will you keep him… uhm… updated?" Sherlock glanced up, only briefly, however long enough to see the compassionate look on his brother's face, and regretted it immediately.
“I honestly don’t know, Greg.” He said silently and swallowed. “I mean… most of the time it was Sherlock talking…”
They reached the centre of the hall and John stopped walking, though he did not stop tugging on Sherlock’s hands. He pulled him closer until they stood only centimetres apart and guided Sherlock’s arms around his waist until his hands rested on the small of his back. Sherlock snapped back into his body in time to feel John run his fingers through his curls. They found their destination when they loosely circled his neck, arms resting on Sherlock’s shoulders. Their weight somehow grounded him, kept him in place without holding him back.
just FYI: I upped the chapter count. Which could have been expected actually, because… well… it's me. That's what I do... 😆
"I called them first. They were already on their way." With that he released John's hands shortly to turn him around and push his back against the surface; only to immediately grab his wrists again and hold them above John's head.
Mycroft had his eyes squeezed shut and his face was still an interesting shade of red. When he calmed down a bit, Greg stood again and looked down at Mycroft, his hands stemmed into his sides, frowning. After a few more coughs and downing his tea Mycroft looked up, embarrassment clearly written over his face. He winced and opened his mouth, obviously to offer any kind of excuse, but the moment his eyes met Greg’s, no words did come out. For a moment there, John felt reminded of the situation on the porch with the two men ignoring him. When Mycroft’s gaze started roaming over Greg’s body, still damp from the shower, drops of water still clinging to his skin, some slowly sliding down his neck, shoulders or biceps, others meandering their way between softly defined pecs downwards over a not quite muscled but nonetheless fit and trim middle, John actually had to avert his eyes because he felt like an intruder. His eyebrows raised till under his hairline and his mouth pulled into an unbelieving grin. He shook his head. A high pitched chuckle escaped him, which seemed to shake the other two men out of wherever they had drifted off to.
"Of course! Of course I will." John reassured her and earned the cheek-pad Sherlock had avoided, before the tiny woman vanished behind the door to her flat again.
Sherlock wasn't sure. They hadn't got anywhere with this call. It even was rather depressing. And still… still… John had called. Him. On purpose. On whatever purpose that was. Sherlock had heard his voice… spoken to him. And that was something. Better than nothing… maybe? Perhaps it meant that 21 guns was possible after all… given some time...
John was angry but at the same time appalled by his own thoughts. Guilt creeping from his heart up to his throat until he felt nearly choked by it.
“One can never start early enough to prepare, John. This is hardly something I could have accomplished on a whim. I had to try out the different methods to find the most effective way to…,” Sherlock started his explanation in the most scientific voice.
"John Hamish Watson," Sherlock pushed himself up and away from John to be able to look him in the eye, "what have you done?"
The next morning he would pretend that nothing had happened. Sipping tea in his armchair, easy conversation about nothing important at all before burying his nose in his laptop, tapping away on his blog, writing emails or whatever…
When he put his phone back, suddenly Mycroft's phone took over the stream of messages. Mycroft read it, raised his eyebrows, and put the phone back where it came from without further reaction. Sherlock felt an unease creep up his back, making the skin of his nape tingle, spreading all the way over his scalp, making it tense and announcing a massive headache.
How can John not know that Sherlock couldn’t stand this any longer? How could John not see how this was tearing Sherlock apart? He didn’t know what to do anymore… as if he ever actually had...
He didn't realise he took a step with his eyes closed until he felt his shoe hit something on the floor. Soft, still robust, didn't belong here.
"Oh, believe me, she does bow for me," John smirked; he couldn't just ignore an innuendo presented so willingly. His smile fell quickly though.
"We could've just had dinner, you know?" The poorly hidden jealousy and rather desperate attempt to cover it up by nonsensical reasoning made John's irritation dissipate into thin air. He smiled a small private smile, his heart doing some funny things in his chest.
"No. Oh my god…" he tried to catch his breath, holding onto the pole next to him for some desperately needed support. "Christ no," he said, shaking his head, an incredulous grin still on his lips. "I fully agree. No bestiality for me either."
When the door to his room creaked a little from being pushed open, he spun around, shocked, feeling caught out. As if he were still the kid from a lifetime ago, discovered by his big brother, nursing the injured hedgehog in his bedroom, feeding him insects, keeping track of it's progress of recovery in a spreadsheet. He even expected the same displeased scowl and the all present 'caring is not an advantage, Sherlock'...
“Bit of trouble too, I bet.” Was there some hope resonating in that otherwise so self-assured voice? John even thought to see a little sparkle in the capturing eyes.
"That was me, Sherlock. Blood tests, IV's, fluids, nourishment… all me." a sad little chuckle. "You were a pain in the ass of a patient even in the state you were in… unconscious and still a brat." an actual laugh. Sounded honest, sounded real. Sherlock frowned, shook his head. He found himself rolled up, folded around himself in his chair. Lying on his side. Watching John's chair. Was it still John's chair? He knew his mind wandered because it tried to evade John's words, because they couldn't be true…
John watched the beloved face in front of him for a moment and couldn't believe his luck that this otherworldly Miss Pirate had chosen him out of all people, that this extraordinary man called him his friend, his partner, his lover, his… just… his.
“We can use that illegally distilled corn schnapps the one client gave us. Alcohol works much better anyway…”
"No, Father, I'm afraid I can't take credit for your present. That was John's idea. He can relate to your interests much better than I ever could… See, John, false expectations. Your fault."
Even more worried when he didn't see any flashing lights at Baker Street when they turned the corner—had the ambulance already left? Had he missed his last moment with Mrs Hudson?—he almost forgot to pay the cabby in his haste to get to 221A. Arriving there, he immediately heard the noise—Iron Maiden roaring in an ear-splitting volume from Mrs Hudson's headphones.
“Thought about going out?” Greg sounded insecure. “Only if you’re okay with it of course! Didn’t want to assume… Actually, I think you really could do with a change of scenery to be honest. Clear the head, ease the mind, have some fun and so on…,” he tried to lure John in. "Sound good?"
One hand diving deeper, sliding lower, chilly fingers brushing the side of a scorchingly hot erection. The other hand efficiently unbuckling the belt, opening the button, lowering the zip. He shifted, lifted his hips to push down trousers and pants while the other hand got in the way, battling for space to get hold of the cock, already rock hard, needily throbbing, flushed deep red. The moment he took himself in hand, he hissed. Ice meeting heat, desire meeting pleasure, giving and taking melting into one blazing ball of passion. He didn't know anymore where his own body ended and Sherlock's imaginary one began. He wanted to give him everything he himself longed for. He wanted to take everything he had to give.
He couldn’t remember when had been the last time that he had put that much effort in his appearance. Maybe the night he had proposed… well, had planned to propose to… he shivered. He refused to even think that name. No, not even for that half-hearted proposal had he taken this long.
He took in the unfamiliar sight of a certain Government official lacking the mandatory three-piece-suit. Still dressed impeccably, he was clad in camel linen trousers, light blue shirt with sleeves rolled up, no tie but matching waistcoat. Looking very… summerly, despite his ever present but pointless umbrella. John wondered if perhaps there were secret weapons hidden inside and if that'd be the reason why Mycroft took it everywhere. He grinned at that ridiculous thought. His attention drawn back, he realised that Mycroft was still staring, stunned. Gobsmacked really.
"Indeed. That was my intention. I took care of what I came for, now I'll have to see to my other duties." Mycroft delivered coolly.
Now he mouthed along, approaching Sherlock slowly, still keeping a safe distance that he admittedly was only barely able to maintain.
was the only Captain that had the right to come anywhere near Sherlock. He got sick at the sudden thought of how many "captains" Sherlock might have had before him.
He freed himself from John's hungry mouth and dove for his neck, sucking hard one time before sinking his teeth into the soft tissue of muscles right above John's scar.
“Exactly that.” Sherlock stated. “You saw Miss Pirate and treated her like a delicate flower, like a breakable porcelain doll. Like something to wrap in cotton wool and protect from the bad bad world outside. However, when you see the Consulting Detective, you admire him for his mind and wit, you’re impressed and like to show your ‘Posh Boy’ off.” He lowered his chin to look at John, whose face was on fire, and challenged him to deny it. “You want to support him to get along with the idiots that normal people are to him; but you’re also of the opinion that he’s a great pain in the arse sometimes and that it is his own fault and he has to deal with it himself. Am I right?” He raised his eyebrows and waited for an answer.
Now though, after a whole afternoon and evening and night and morning without rest, mind circling only the one topic, he couldn't help it. Sighing, he took out his phone and started typing a short text to Sherlock. After a moment of doubt he sent it.
Leaning over a person you expected to be wounded and in need of help only to be shot and left behind to bleed out in the dirt?
This was a quite appealing thought, as it meant nothing of the horror he recalled would have been real.
Peeling himself out of bed, pulling a face due to sheets being unyieldingly glued to his belly, John realised it was time to concede — actually, he hadn't been alone last night. Not really. Apparently his libido had decided to develop a new kink. A voice fetish. More precisely: a 'The Voice'-fetish.
John blinked. This confirmed all the fears he had tried to temper down. Never in a lifetime he would have expected Mycroft to express more than restrained acceptance on his behalf. This was different. This was acknowledgment, this was a confession of having been mistaken. Sentiment was an advantage after all.
A thought popped up. John must have been there to collect the mp3 player - afterwards. John had been there. He had seen Sherlock dance.
"So, Captain, what else can I do for you? I assume this wasn't what had been your intention dialing this number..." the man said in an affectionate smooth purr that, for some reason, sent a rush of heat straight to John's cock and reminded him what had actually been the reason for his call.
John felt as if he was slapped in the face, or rather only half of him, which felt weirdly surreal; the jealous John part within himself got slapped in the face and the protective pimp part got kicked in the balls. Either not very desirable.
The moment he stepped on the boat, John heard Greg shift on the sofa, folding the papers he had apparently been reading. He had hoped for some solitude and squeezed his eyes shut.
!!!  It wasn’t me! I just copied and pasted! I didn’t actually check it out, but if you do let me know how it went! *wink wink*
“John…,” he said under his breath, voice low and dark, sending little sparks of fire through John’s veins. “We’re not done yet.” And it seemed to be a reprimand and a whine at the same time. And it was true, they weren’t and John doubted that they’d ever make it to the club, but it wouldn’t matter because he wouldn’t survive that long anyway.
“Checked on you constantly. But he himself didn’t even bother to eat. I made scones for him. He didn’t eat them. What a waste. Would you believe that, Sherlock. Scones! I mean, it’s John. I didn’t think I would live to that day…” She wasn’t aware of Sherlock’s face paling and just rambled on and muttered curses under her breath. Probably about all the effort she had put in the scones.
If John would know what Sherlock really wanted him to fight for, for what Sherlock would willingly surrender, it would ruin everything!
Shame started to spread its queasy slimy goo through his belly and chest and mind. But Sherlock wasn't done yet.
He didn’t even know why he had chosen this song. Was it a reaction to John’s grief, to John’s memories about his fall? Was it about his present feeling of confusion? What was it that he wanted to say? Did he even want to say anything? To whom? Who would listen? Who would understand? There had always been only one person who he had trusted, who would understand him. And he had tried, he had tried so hard to tell, to explain. But finally he had given up, best not to make himself too vulnerable, it wouldn’t do him any good as he knew from experience.
At that Greg's look had turned serious again. “You still don't wanna tell me what’s wrong?”, he had asked with a little tilt of his head. At loss for words John had only shaken his head a little. He didn't even understand himself, let alone willing to explain to anyone else.
John remained silent and Sherlock started to feel uneasy. He got fidgety, didn’t know what to do with himself. Could John please start speaking again, no matter if he was only berating him. After a while John pulled out his phone and started fiddling with it. It took him some time, he just kept scrolling and looking.
, I never came close enough to reveal what was hidden under my skirt—even though they no doubt assumed, I never gave anyone any physical confirmation. Except you. Also, I never enjoyed it myself—at least not the way I did with you..." Sherlock winked.
"You have to admit that it was pretty intimate what you did with that greedy ape there." John didn't even want to think about it anymore, but they had to get this out.
"Wild guess at most!" Scott protested vigorously and by now John could almost see the petulant pout before his inner eye without ever actually having seen the man in his life.
Short, denims, plaid button down, neatly trimmed blond fringe shimmering golden in the incoming light.
"Yeah. Yeah, I'm knackered, too. Has been quite the day…" John made work of pulling the sheets over the sofa to make up his bed.
“I know it's not my business and…. and I absolutely don't want to tell you what to do, John. Really. I know you only want the best. I know that … I really
He looked down at it lying on the floor, looming over it, towering it, trying to intimidate it in defiance of the feeling coiling through his veins, boiling his blood, that he himself was the one being threatened. The target. The victim. The dread built up a pressure inside him that almost bubbled over, tearing other feelings with it which were burning in his heart, laying them bare out in the open. He couldn’t let himself be defeated. He couldn’t get weak. Because… He. Didn’t. Care.
Much later, when breath was back, sheets were rumpled and the two men were happily holding each other, the initial cause for the latest encounter regained their interest. Sherlock reached over to pick up the laptop again.
Sherlock gaped at him, eyes blown wide—the perfect picture of an indignant drama queen. John laughed heartily.
John almost choked on his own breath. He got caught in a cough fit until Sherlock thumped him on his back a couple of times.
"I'm starting to suspect that might be actually true." Scott murmured and John could have sworn he could feel a companionable grin on the other end of the line, carried all the way through the wires. Wires? Air? Waves? Whatever…
"Okay, I think…" John cleared his throat. Not formal but at least conversational he continued, "think about it, Sherlock. I know you need time to think it through. Just… promise me that you will, yeah? Can you do that? Will you at least… think about it?"
“John wouldn’t leave your side the whole time.” She took a step into the flat and Sherlock’s widening eyes snapped back to her.
Sherlock was rubbing his eyes. This was really getting to him. This was not what he had planned for. His mind should have slowed down by now. He should have been able to sort his thoughts by now. He should have been working on storing away his sentiments. He should have been preparing to face the next day, to get through it, to stay at distance, not to let John come to close. Dangerous.
Suddenly Sherlock took a leap John thought wasn’t humanly possible, like rolling through the air, arms spread wide. Landing steadily on both feet, resuming his former position. Like breaking free, came to John’s mind. Their eye contact broken, Sherlock closed his and was fully absorbed in his dance. His head dropped back and exposed his stretched neck. John stood close enough to see Sherlock’s throbbing pulse under the pale skin and his adam’s apple bob up and down as he swallowed. John swallowed in sympathy. Sherlock’s lean frame started swaying and rocking more intensely, becoming one with the song.
“Second…. I’ve been home for more than half an hour now, and…,” he winced a bit and threw a hesitant and sheepish gaze in John’s direction, “… I saw you.” he admitted. “The whole time you were staring at that same screen there. So unless that mail is written in Sanskrit…,” he aimed for a joke but it fell flat.
With that Sherlock reached for the lace panties and pulled them up until they clung to his arse and his groin like a second skin. He adjusted his flaccid penis to point up.
“That’s not… no… you didn’t…” John didn’t know where to start, his thoughts getting tangled with his words.
Sherlock could feel the breeze sneaking through the gap of the half closed window drying the sweat on his damp skin. He was exhausted.
With this in mind he made his way inside, which he could have done blindly by now. But as he reached the hiding place of his belongings he cursed. Being angry with himself he picked up his needed items.
“I meant what I said—I survived. Not everyone was good-natured regarding the services they thought I had to offer. There was more than one interested party who wanted to earn their money by selling my… company. I always succeeded to scare them off—quite literally sometimes. Even to fight them if they got too nasty. I always found something that was their ruin or at least hurt them enough to teach them a lesson; after a while they left me alone, you know my methods, John.” Sherlock looked a bit proud of himself. “And I’ve always,
When he realised that it threatened to drown him, that it was too much at once, he tried to channel it, to guide it. He tried to make use of the well known tunes of the grandmasters of classical music, of his personal favourites of modern compositions, but his mind wandered, he got distracted. He didn’t dare to access his own compositions, too charged, too many spectres hiding there.
Sherlock had obviously noticed, too, as he now lifted his foot and placed it, heavy boot and all, in John’s lap, putting delicate pressure on his trapped erection. John groaned, dropped his head. Fuck. What was his life?
Suddenly there were arms engulfing him, holding him. He felt a warm breath on top of his head, John scattering little light kisses on his hair. Low murmured words.
he tell John, if it wasn’t anything out of the ordinary? Should John ask him? Wasn’t it his duty to ask and make sure that Sherlock was okay? But then, why would it mean Sherlock wasn’t okay? What did John even suspect? On the other hand, was it that far fetched that something fishy went on here? Or should he rather not ask? Maybe it was overbearing? Not his place? Then again, why would Sherlock leave him out? What did he have to hide? If he had to hide anything in the first place. And if not, what would Sherlock think, if John interrogated him about it? Maybe he would think John didn’t trust him. But... did he trust him? God gracious, what a freaking mess! Why was it even such an issue?
That was an innocent question, wasn't it? If John would remember their conversation on the phone he'd probably mention it.
For a moment there he had thought John would kiss him. Suddenly, he had turned serious in the midst of his laughable and therefore refreshing act. A genius move to alleviate the tension and lighten the mood. His John was smarter than he looked after all.
“Noooo, I’m callin’ Greg. You said so yourself, Ssshherlock. He better not speak to you either. Tell h’m that I’ll kill h’m if he spills anythin’ I told h’m tonight. You’re never allowed to know that I dream about you. Maybe I’ll dream about you tonight? What do you think, Ssshherlock? Do you know that I dream about you? Did you deduce who I’m thinkin’ about… when I’m wankin’ in the shower… in the mornin’? Ha, forget it, I’ll never tell you! Never! I’m not crazy!”
John knew his place by now though—seaking out conversations, making contact. He was so fucking tired of it. He wished this case would end; rather sooner than later. In the meantime though, he couldn’t deny that he was looking forward to Miss Pirate’s show tonight—finally her delicious body slung around a dancing pole again; he had hoped for this to happen since the very first night they had set foot into a nightclub again. He deserved a bit of a reward for enduring all the teasing of Miss Pirate’s masterful seduction skills, but never being on the receiving end lately. Didn’t he? If only the rest of the audience didn’t get more of a “show” than John was comfortable to share with them.
He wasn’t in the least surprised when he was greeted by one of Mycroft’s shiny black cars the moment he opened the front door. He had texted after all. He hadn’t mentioned a time though, but it wouldn’t be beyond Mycroft to have a car on stand by at his front door all morning.
Sherlock had lost all  control of his body, it wasn’t possible for him to command it anymore; what a relief to let it go, to not hold back anything, to not being responsible for anything… to surrender; for once without the feeling to have lost the game.
It hadn't been like that. Only recently he had realised that there was a deep desire in the first place. Only now he was aware of the nature of his feelings towards Sherlock. Of course, he had always loved Sherlock. And he had always known it. Although, he had thought it had been in the range of friendship. A quite intense friendship admittedly, but what wasn't intense about Sherlock?
been someone who had gotten to Sherlock through John; someone who had gotten under Sherlock's skin - quite literally.
“Sherlock,” he croaked, not sure if he wanted to stop or to encourage the man, his arousal evident in the way it tented the front of his today’s black dress pants.
So it seems that he had to rely on his own techniques. He just had to assume that he knew John well enough by now. He did, didn't he? He knew that man better than he had known any other person in his life before! Never in his life had he spent more time thinking about someone than he had about John! He could do this!
"I love it." he said. Kissed him again to emphasise his words. "I love it! And it's only for me. My very own gingerlock." he hummed.
No! He had to stop this! This was not about keeping up old patterns. This was not about their usual manner of communicating. Because that had led to nothing. It had only led them to the mess they found themselves in right now. He had to do better. He still had to do better. Why was it so hard to break old habits? Why was the relapse always the easier option? Easier perhaps, but from experience he knew that it also was—almost always—more painful. And lonely. He had lied to John. More than once of course. Constantly. But the moment he had been most vulnerable, most afraid, he had told John the biggest lie. Alone didn’t protect him, no. Rather, always when he had tried to protect himself, in the end he had always ended up alone. It was a pattern. It had become his normality. He had started to be a step ahead and make it his state of being. Only now, he wasn’t alone. John had absolutely incomprehensibly come back. John was miraculously still here. With him. Together. They’ve had enough of alone.
"Yeah, seems like it." That came out sharper than intended and Sherlock promptly turned his head to watch him, eyes squinted suspiciously. "What I mean is…" John hurried to reassure his partner, "I noticed people recognising you. People you probably know from before the time you met me because I've never seen them before… like…" he rolled his hand in the air, indicating he lacked some crucial information there but Sherlock only cluelessly raised his eyebrows. "Well, the… redhead…?"
"The only thing I can't remember is, how I paid them…" he couldn't avoid sounding rougher, the thought alone that he'd sunk that deep again appalled him, made him sick, "... but considering that aside from the overall soreness there were no notable bruises or injuries, visible or nonvisible, I live in hope that…"
Sherlock craved to have John here with him for whatever John was willing to give. And apparently this was the one thing he was willing to give to Sherlock. That much he had understood from John’s letter.
“Baker Street?” the cabby looked delighted, then suspicious. “Hey, don’ I know ya? Aren’ ya that guy from the papers? Would know yo’ face everywhere, mate! I DID like your blog though, ya know?! I’m a great fan!” The cabby pointed gleefully with his stubby finger in John’s general direction. “Ya should be used to ghosts, innit? With all that dead and not dead pal of yours...” He made ghostly noises wavering his hands in the air to underline his apparently meant to be spooky appearance. He was giggling to himself as if he had made a very clever joke, pleased with himself.
John stood slowly and said while stretching his back, “Yes, of course. Anything in? Sorry, didn’t check…,” and marched over to the kitchen counter.
John closed his eyes, took a deep breath. He feared that he had made things worse even though he didn't know what things that actually were, but there was nothing to it now. He already regretted his temper, he really had to get that under control. He couldn't allow himself more than… smash that slimy spider under his pretty sparkling slippers and for good measure stomp and jump on his remains like Rumpelstiltskin. Yes, that had to do.
“Scott?” John shouted harder than necessary. Just in time. He didn’t want to imagine! Well, yes, he did, he was calling a sex hotline to fuel his imagination after all.
“Checked the back door, boss.” One of the guys slurred, apparently equipped with the brain of a mayfly.
“Done?” John asked quietly after a short moment. This was confirmed by a very satisfied hum. “Good. Now, rub your wet fingertips over your nipples, imagine it’s my tongue. Flick them…” John instructed, accompanied by a beautiful background melodie of panted breaths and grunts. “Are you doing it?” John knew he was, but he wanted to hear it.
Pinned into place he was mesmerized. Watching the slim waist waving from side to side, the thighs tensing, muscles working in a slow rhythm, bare feet tapping in the dust.
John hadn't known what to make of it. It was for the case; he knew it was. Or at least, he hoped it was. He didn't want to imagine any other scenario in which it wasn't. Of course, they were paid for The Work, nothing uncommon. But then, this was a case they were consulting for the Yard. More so, the case wasn’t even closed? So, this wasn’t the usual payment for their services. But… what else? As the money apparently ended up in their tea tin, he probably shouldn't worry. However, that was easier said than done. Why wouldn't Sherlock tell him, if it wasn’t anything obscure? Although, why
"Well, I had hoped to introduce you to my roof terrace, maybe…" Greg answered and John sensed the teasing undertone. "I could get us some… donuts, for starters." Greg smirked and it made the skin around his eyes crinkle in glee. Even John had to admit that Greg was a handsome man, although he had never felt anything but camaraderie for his mate. Surprisingly though, Mycroft seemed to think differently.
Never leaving his eyes, Miss Pirate planted both her feet on the stage again and ran her now free right hand down her front, sliding over one of the firm breasts and along a flat stomach heaving from heavy breathing only to stop at her groin and to cup herself through the layers of leather and lace of her skirt.
John was stubborn. As usual. Sherlock should have expected it. But he hadn't. John had left. Why would he put effort in staying in contact now? They had talked. They had agreed. Sherlock had told him. But John didn't give up. Sherlock wasn't prepared. He tried not to care. He tried to stick to the plan. Bloody Mycroft! Why was Sherlock forced to still be here? To still be him?
While John was musing about the might-be, probably-was experience his Pirate had, one of her high-heel-clad feet lifted and the tip of her toes wandered sensuously slowly up her calf, dragging the thirsty gazes of her audience in its wake. When it reached the hollow of her knee her leg snapped to her side like an arrow and made her spin that John got dizzy just by watching. John really had no idea how it was humanly possible, but in the end Miss Pirate sat gracefully on the chair, straddling it backwards, her back turned to the audience. As a consequence she was facing John and immediately locked eyes with him. Miss Pirate's intense gaze kept him hooked, never leaving him when she rolled her shoulders, her upper body shifting from side to side, legs splayed obscenely wide, the skirt even if short sufficiently draped over the intentionally not-hidden demonstration of Miss Pirate’s actual genitalia. Now John saw what Sherlock had meant with ‘the eye sees what the mind wants to see’. If one really cared, there would be enough opportunity to sneak a peek under that skirt to discover who Miss Pirate really was.
“Oh.” It was more a rush of air against the speaker than an actual sound. “But there were… dates…” stated-asked Scott again after a moment. John grinned. So much for ‘I know everything’.
was definitely an improvement. Unfortunately not something to enjoy and indulge in on the tube… Damnit. Before Scott could go on like this and John ended up embarrassing himself, he hurried to interrupt.
And once again, Sherlock left. Left John behind, not saying anything, not explaining, just whirling around and rushing down the stairs. John didn’t even hear the front door closing.
“Nothing I’ll see here will scare me away, you know?! I’ve already seen so many facets of it… of you, and they were all stunning.” He glanced over his shoulder. Even quieter, “all of them, do you hear me?”
The damp layer of sweat covering Sherlock's body, reflecting the sunlight. Tiny droplets merging into one another, letting a gleam wash over working muscles and firm skin. He was panting. The soaked wild curls coloured even darker than normal in contrast to the faint flush on Sherlock's cheeks.
“Greg. I had to promise him. It’s the least I can do, no? Keep my promise?” John pleaded, the last bit of energy pouring into convincing himself, not giving into the temptation, the curiosity to know what Sherlock had wanted to say.
He would play along, smile when expected and leave as soon as possible to return to his bedsit. And add this to the long list of “unsuccessful experiments”. Back to normal, back to boring, back to depressing then.
Sherlock didn’t sleep for the rest of the night. He should have been used to it by now, but somehow this night was much more exhausting than usual. So his mood, when he finally got up, was more than petulant.
Sherlock began to get fidgety. This was confusing him. This conversation was pointless. They didn't get anywhere like this. Did John really not know?
“I wasn’t a good man, Sherlock. The same indifference took hold of me, because that wasn’t what I wanted either. A war that was impossible to win, at times I wasn’t even sure if we were the good guys or the bad guys. But I stayed anyway, because I didn’t care. I killed people and I saved people’s lives back to back, Sherlock. And I didn’t care. Wrong uniform? Kill! Right uniform? Save! That is all it was.” He felt drained. He had never admitted all that. Had never even voiced his thoughts, the guilt he felt. The disgust. Nausea churned his stomach, pictures of bloodied bodies of all kinds welling up from the depth of his memory. Then suddenly there were Sherlock’s hands slowly sliding up his back, cradling the base of his skull and gently guiding him until his forehead rested against Sherlock’s shoulder. John let out a shuddering breath. The hands steadied him, held him. He felt Sherlock rest his cheek against the top of his head. The tenderness of that gesture broke the dam he was trying to keep up, his breath turned into a sigh, into a sob and suddenly he felt his face wet with tears he hadn't known he still had to cry over this. He thought he had left all this behind a long time ago. This chapter was closed, goddamnit.
“Anyway, your pants —” No matter all the heart-eyes-emojis swirling in John's head, there still was a job to be done! “Off with them! Now!”
"I solely... belong to... myself," Sherlock puffed out, almost a sob. Sherlock's thighs were trembling, losing rhythm. His eyes were glued to John's—both their gazes were hooded, dazed, eyes held open with difficulties, but neither of them wanted to break their bond. "And if I stay," he forced out under his breath, "I'll do so…" he paused, unable to speak, eyelids fluttering and almost falling shut. Focusing again, Sherlock gasped, "I'll stay… out... of my own... free... will..."
Honestly @unavoidably-hotson, I don’t know what to say… Jeez… However, I’m off, patient calling (well yes, my username is real life related, not fictional… I’m REALLY the “medical assistant” of sorts. Army doctor actually. So.. uhm… yes, admittedly also the military lifesaver… God, I better stop talking LOL) Thank you again U-H!!! Can’t thank you enough!
John had things to do! Lots of things! A whole bunch of things! Well… maybe he shouldn't have tried to fix the last couple of months of his life in one single day, though that wasn’t any of Scott’s business, was it? And anyway — why did he even care?
John was furrowing his brows, squinting his eyes. Bewildered. He then turned to the other man. Not less wary.
One moment you wonder what purpose life still held for you - the next moment there’s a John Watson standing in the middle of your lab. One moment you're telling the man sitting across from you (and most of all yourself) that you're married to your work - the next moment you regret the words tremendously when you see the disappointment they cause in that man's beautiful eyes. One moment you finally dare to ask said man out to spend some time together and have fun - the next moment he brings one of these annoying women to your date. One moment he’s jealous of The Woman - the next moment you hear him say “I’m not gay”. One moment you are on the height of your game - the next moment you’re falling harder than you would have ever expected. One moment the thought of a certain man keeps you alive through the darkest hells - the next moment the sight of the very same man is throwing you into the darkest hells of them all. One moment you think you have lost him forever - the next moment he’s back in your home and your life…
After a while, Sherlock started to take cases again. Short and easy ones at first, the more difficult ones after regaining some confidence. Sometimes he would take John along, but sometimes he wouldn’t, even when John had nothing else to do, no shift at the surgery, no social calls, no anything.
But watching his friend being this devastated, on the verge of collapsing, breaking, John swore to himself to never let this man down again. No matter if Sherlock wanted him in his life or not and no matter how strongly and often his own feelings would be hurt, John would never be far away again. He would always have Sherlock's back. If Sherlock wanted it or not. That was where John belonged.
It dawned on Sherlock that maybe… just maybe… there was justification for sentimental terms such as... a wounded heart, an aching heart… a broken heart.
"Well, it seems I'm not very talented in removing eye make-up." he snickered. "I might have missed a bit yesterday."
When his laptop had finally started up and he watched his desktop flicker on, his eyes fell immediately on that little icon he ignored successfully most of the time. He wasn’t able to bring himself to delete it. But he wasn’t actually keen on being reminded of it, either.
"Had a little present there for you in the beginning. Hope you liked it." Miss Pirate's eyes gleamed and John knew immediately what she meant.
When he popped his eyes open again, Greg was gone and the creamy white envelope was in his place on the deck chair. John watched it. And watched some more. And finally came to the conclusion, that the moment had come.
Sherlock smiled tenderly at him, releasing John's waist to reach up and cradle his face, running his thumbs slowly and gently over the bristly hair on John's cheeks.
“The only reason I put up with an old man like you!” The corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitched mirthfully when he turned his face back to look out of the window.
he heard, screamed, frightened, desperate. Running towards a raven black abyss, out of breath, never getting closer.
He literally jumped up from his chair to grab his laptop. He had to do research. That's the way he always started a case. With facts.
He felt the urge to find out, to study them until he knew. To look as close and as long as he liked and to memorise each little shade until he could find a name.
Then he turned one last time, squared his shoulders and marched away in the direction of Marylebone road.
He ran and slumped on his knees, sliding over the floor, well aware about the abrasion on his shins and patellas but not caring. Pain. Physical pain was good, pain was easy, something easy to treat!
meant." He waited a moment, let it sink in. John didn't respond. Didn't argue. Good. He was finally seeing sense. "I keep hurting you, John. Mary…"
“So…” he started, his back still towards Sherlock to give him some space, “how are we going to do this? What did you imagine? What do you need from me?” He turned slightly to look at Sherlock over his shoulder. The man didn’t look back, but John saw him shrugging.
With Sherlock standing in the door opening and John standing at the kitchen counter, the table was between them and blocking his way. Or it could work in his advantage as it gave Sherlock more time and him a bigger stage.
"Ha… yeah… last time I checked…" she said, followed by the uncertain-shy-nervous laugh-giggle-chuckle very own to Molly.
John huffed and turned, looking forward to easing his mind with some more delicious Pirate… and was presented with an empty stage. Damn, shit fucking camel's balls. He had missed Miss Pirate leaving the stage. Where was she? That dickhead had totally distracted him. He wondered if that had been the reason for Mister Creepy-Crawly's turn up behind the stage. Had he been here deliberately? Maybe even especially for Miss Pirate?
But Sherlock was already on his way back up the stairs, his gown slightly askew, carrying two heavy bags of Waitrose instead of their usual Tesco carriers. Well, not
He didn't step back though, for it was something he was not willing to do anymore, at least not in regard to Sherlock. All he wanted was to take that last step forwards and close the last remaining gap between them, but he
It didn’t take long though until a fuming John Watson stomped out of the bathroom anyway despite Sherlock’s efforts. After having endured Sherlock’s meticulous instructions and his complaining about John’s lack of technique, it was Sherlock shouting abuse at John for ripping off the strip — as instructed by the way — that was the straw that broke the camel’s back.
"In particular about my trousers and shirts, and that person asked me to do something about that. I thought for once I'd be considerate and indulge them. Wouldn't want to displease that person, right?"
There was Sherlock standing in the middle of the open space. His upper body bare, nothing left to the imagination of what was hiding under his snugly tailored shirts. John had to acknowledge that during the last months he had wondered and spend more time thinking about it, than he would ever admit. Even living in the same flat he had nothing to go on but his own imagination when it came to Sherlock's physics.
"Swirl your thumb over the head with the upward strokes; imagine it's my tongue… Jesus Christ...fuck…"
... He cringed. He wasn’t so sure that was something he could say out loud. Of course, Sherlock’s happiness was all that mattered to him. He himself would cope.That was what the song on the usb device was about, wasn’t it? I’ll protect you, if you want me to or not. I’ll help you find the way of life that makes you happy, if it includes me or not. But… would he really survive seeing Sherlock with someone else? Would he be able to contain himself, to let Sherlock have with another person what John so desperately wanted to give to him himself?
And finally he could vent, let go, abandon himself to the real cause of his exasperation. Soon his back started shaking. After a short while his whole body was taken by convulsions from crying, from sobbing, his tears seeping away in the dust on the ground.
John caught him in his arm, pressing them flush against each other. Their stiff members trapped between their bodies, panting mouths only an inch apart. The increasing hum of pleasure radiating through his body caused John’s own eyelids to drop. Moaning, he captured Sherlock’s lips in a kiss.
He hung up and dropped the phone to the floor. Then beamed up at Sherlock with the widest grin Sherlock had ever seen.
matter, otherwise you wouldn't have called. Is this some kind of interrogation for… I can't imagine what actually?"
"Don't be so dramatic. It's hardly the first time we find ourselves in a situation similar to this one."
"I like to not hide at all. I don't like to pretend to be someone I'm not. And I don't identify as female nor as non-binary, genderfluid or any other not definitely male gender."
looking at me now, though.” Sherlock looked at John from under his lashes, well aware that John could
“If I remember it…?” John croaked. He wasn’t quite able to swallow against the sudden dryness of his mouth.
We wanted to thank you somehow, as it obviously all “worked out” between us. He says I don’t need to be so posh here, but I have appearances to keep up as the genius detective amidst this community after all. If you feel amenable to follow me, I’m running a regularly updated blog now. The content on my blog will meet the highest standards and I don’t know why John is laughing while I’m typing this. Anyway, you can expect to see my name among your followers. You seem to be not as much an idiot as most people.
, Sherlock spat out in his mind palace as if the word itself tasted bitter on his tongue. He had no friends! He only ever had a John, but that was so much more than just a ...friend! But then, was this… assessment… mutual? What even was
That was true. John knew it was true. However, he had to shake himself out of his pondering and sort his mind to be able to keep up with the direction the conversation was heading for. It was hard to be honest, but that was the only way if they wanted to solve this mess. He cleared his throat.
“Beer?!” Greg asked again, now standing by the fridge, holding the door open and waving a bottle at John. When John didn’t answer Greg said: “That’s what we always do, yeah? Have beer and talk. And it always works. And it will work now. Because, as far as I see, the world is still turning.” Greg picked two bottles and some nibbles and settled back on the couch.
he could feel the vibrations of the trimmer pressed against Sherlock’s perineum transferred all the way to his palate. He groaned around the cock in his mouth and Sherlock bucked his hips and thrusted even deeper into John’s mouth.
He knew he was repeating himself. He hated repeating himself. Right now though, he'd hate any other option even more. He was lost. He was staring in the face of life altering events and was lost for words.
” John spat in his face. “I warned you to keep your hands off her or you’ll regret it. I told you—she’s mine!”
Still no message from the man upstairs. Apparently this wasn’t enough. After all, John has always been an idiot. One always had to spell out everything for him to finally get it. Annoying!
“Just teasing, yeah? God knows, that woman might let us starve to death to repay the costs if we crack the sink.” He brushed his nose against Sherlock’s, marvelling at the ease with which he did so. No hesitation, no doubts or restraints. As if it has never been different, as if this was their natural state of being. And still, the excitement at the novelty of it all sizzled through his system and sent sparks flying into the thin layer of air between them.
When Sherlock heard a choked gasp his gaze involuntarily wandered to the spot, to the figure that slowly got shape.
Why? Why would John write such a thing? On his blog! Openly for everyone to see! And again in this letter he wasn't supposed to read.
He had slowly approached the woman known as Mary step by step and had forced her back towards the stairs until she bumped against the handrail. Before turning and rushing down the stairs she had narrowed her eyes at John, only smirked, which had made John furious, and had said : “I have to admit, I almost got used to it, you know? It was nice to pretend this would work… with us… this life. But honestly, we both always knew it wouldn’t, didn’t we? Not with
"I hope, whatever is in that letter, my brother has thought it through well." he said, while shaking John's hand. "If you're ever in need of help, you know where to find me." He nodded, took his briefcase and went to the door.
"I? I distanced myself? You can't be… Sherlock, seriously??" He heard more rustling and footsteps on a wooden floor. John was pacing. "You can't honestly… fuck, this is not how I wanted this to go." The pacing stopped. Then with apparently new found certainty, "Sherlock, we need to talk."
“Didn’t know you had company, Elle,” she said wonderous but good-naturedly. “Wouldn’t have expected that from you.”
“Only… it didn’t match any of my former convictions. It wasn’t logical, damnit.” Sherlock growled the last bit and ran agitatedly one hand through his hair. “It scared me and that in itself is unsettling when nothing was supposed to matter anyway.”
"I don't want to get that dirty," he said and pulled it over his head in one movement, cursing when he realised he had forgotten to open the cuffs. After a bit of fumbling he got rid of the rebellious piece of clothing and saw Sherlock smirking.
doing something useful. Ending a war, you know,” he chuckled and Sherlock joined in. He caught a low murmured ‘all by yourself’ and threw Sherlock a glance who looked back with an open and honest smile; like the one after their first night out, in the hallway, when Angelo had brought back his cane, John thought. He smiled back, “To be honest? I just wanted to get away. Start over, pretend to be a good human being. Which I was not...”
Only now he realised that his arms were still awkwardly bouncing against his hips; he hadn't really known what to do with them. What was allowed? What was expected? Now though he couldn't withstand the temptation. Haltingly his shaky hands found their destination on John's waist; holding him cautiously at first, gaining confidence when he felt the warmth radiating from John's body and saw the heat in John's eyes.
All John wanted was to rush after him, but he tugged on that warm hand in his and pulled the man back.
"Well, what are you waiting for then?" Greg squeaked at him, seemingly only barely able to contain his frustration.
With a last merciless snap of their hips, the Pirate ripped John's dog tags from his neck, rolling their pelvis to give John's cock one last tease and taste of what could have been, nearly tipping John over the edge.
“Please, tell me. I want to hear it.” he said seriously. “It’s important to you, so it’s important to me! And I told you, I’ve been an idiot!”
But he hadn’t realised until now that he lived through John. John was the blood running through his veins, the air he breathed. John was his life.
It was difficult to form a coherent thought like this, let alone speak. His breath was going fast, matching the quick rise and fall of Sherlock's belly and chest against his back.
Mycroft looked at him, his expression saying enough. No, at this point there was nothing more important to him than Sherlock. John could trace a shimmer of worry and protectiveness on 'big brother's' face. One of the kind that could only be caused by two years of fear and helplessness and guilt. John could relate only too much. He knew this feeling by heart.
“I have no control over it. It just happens.” He turned around, needed to see John’s reaction, look him into the eyes. John was standing next to the table, close, only two steps away from him, still at a safe distance. “You know what can happen when I lose control, John. Remember Baskerville?” A short nod, although not as repulsed as Sherlock would have expected. The expression on John’s face was rather one of concern, of affection. He even took a step closer. Sherlock flinched back.
He reached over and inspected it. No writing, no other marks, just the thick paper with a watermark John didn’t recognise. He pulled the lit open and took out two sheets of paper. A letter then. He unfolded it. His heart made a flip at the sight of the scribbled words. The man who had written them felt much nearer like this. Sherlock felt within reach again. He took a deep breath and began reading.
"Dunno…" John squirmed, averted Sherlock's eyes. "Yeah, okay, I do, but… it's silly actually." To put it in words was actually pretty embarrassing.
“We don’t want to get that dirty, do we?” Sherlock said sultry and captured John’s mouth with a kiss again.
How could life be this cruel? The very moment he realised he wanted nothing more than to be at this extraordinary man’s side unconditionally, to share his life indefinitely, the opportunity was ripped away under his waiting hands once again. Why was it that he had to let go over and over again. All he wanted was to get a new chance! A second chance? A third? He had lost count. And this time not because he thought it was his one option, his one way to carry on, to survive. No, this time it was a conscious decision, this was out of his own free will, out of commitment, out of acknowledgement… out of… well… out of love!
Sherlock stifled his voice and exhaled slowly before the pain forming in his chest could escape and form any sort of sound.
good.” John confirmed convinced in at least that part of his abilities. He raised his head to show that he accepted whatever game this man was playing.
John startled when in this moment his Pirate-non-pirate jumped from the roof, all grace and ease, coat billowing behind them, and landed at John’s feet. Raising to their full height and needlessly, teasingly ruffled their hair, they said in a low voice, holding John's gaze: “No. Consulting detective. The only one in the world. I invented the job.” And when John failed to answer, just staring, they added: “And very much male, if you wondered.”
John abandoned his steadying fixing stare on the floor for a steadying hand on the wall to be able to study Sherlock's face. Not that he would be able to draw any conclusions right now though.
John had, unnoticed by Sherlock, moved them into the corridor leading to Sherlock's bedroom. But the moment Sherlock thought his heart would jump out of his chest as hard as it was suddenly beating, John gave him a calming and reassuring smile and slowed them down until they were standing still, John leaning against the wall with his back, just watching each other.
Ask Hudders, Lestrade, Stamford, Hooper and Sawyer for assistance. For now: Sherlock was the one to react, not on the phone, John didn't like it, still a question to answer: how to save lives, when: as soon as possible!
"You mean here?" he whispered and John felt the tip of Sherlock's hot tongue flick against his skin, licking a quickly cooling wet spot where John could feel his own pulse racing under his skin, echoing in his skull. It was intoxicating—his own emotions bouncing in lightning speed between anger and relief and want and confusion; the sensations Sherlock's touch elicited setting his nerves on fire; the sudden dizzying shift from control to surrender. John closed his eyes, head falling back against the door.
all of that, John. I’ve never known a person more dutiful or loyal than you.” Sherlock said, sounded insecure, as if he was afraid to have misunderstood. John was somehow a bit proud of him for speaking up. He smiled at him, showing that he had noticed; that he appreciated it. It was most uncomfortable and painful, but also freeing and necessary.
Flashes of Sherlock turning and whirling in his bare torso and tights mixing with Sherlock spinning at the prospect of a serial murder, eyes glittering, pure joy, so young, so beautiful.
But… was this what John was thinking. That he could have avoided it, if he had stayed up that night, talking Sherlock out if it, finding a different solution? If he had only known how? Did he really think he could have changed what happened? None of this was John's doing. If he'd really think so, it was in no way acceptable! Sherlock had to tell him. John was not allowed to blame himself for Sherlock's faults… for any of this!
"Shit…" John forced through gritted teeth. His hips were bucking uncontrollably now, thrusting his cock even deeper into the tight slick channel of his rapidly moving fist. "I can’t hold back. Sorry…" He said, apologising for imaginarily taking advantage of his not so very imaginary partner. "Can’t help fucking your mouth. I can't… I'm…"
This couldn't be it though, could it? He couldn’t go on like this, otherwise he would grow old until he’d retire, and all he would have left would be the loving relationship with his left hand. No, he had to take matters in hand. Although, not in the way he usually did...
He picked up his shoes and socks and reluctantly put them on. He would have loved to feel London underneath his bare feet, but even he had to admit that there were too many undefined substances covering the pavements. He rolled down his trouser legs because it would look ridiculous otherwise and started to button up his shirt. When he caught John looking, well rather staring actually, he smirked and intentionally left one or maybe two buttons more open than usual. John cleared his throat and looked away. Sherlock was very pleased with himself. He also left his sleeves rolled up, having the unfamiliar urge to let his skin be covered by the sunlight and the London air.
“God, you…” John whispered when they parted and looked at Sherlock in wonder. “How do I even deserve you…”
In between the steps his feet traced broad circles in the dust and he could feel the point of contact between his body and the ground, the dust being parted by his toes, leaving evidence of his progression by drawing patterns for everyone to see. Evidence. That he had been here. That he had let go. For a split second he wondered what the construction workers would think of it the next day, but was then pulled back under the blanket of the trance like state evoked by the music.
He opened his eyes, looked back. His eyes able to say, what his lips couldn't. His eyes able to plead. His eyes able to beg. His lips couldn't. Because he didn't care. That was the plan.
There stood a naked Sherlock, looking sheepishly at him, hair a rumpled mess, chest and arms and legs a map of patches in different shades of red. Shifting awkwardly from one foot to the other he was wringing his hands.
“I don’t know what to do about it! I thought I knew myself, John. I don’t. I don’t understand.” He wanted John to come closer. He wanted to vanish into thin air. He wanted to see John’s face. He’d never dare to look at John ever again.
"Right…" John laughed out loud which earned him some suspicious and annoyed glares. When he glared back at the man sitting opposite of him he noticed the world floating by outside of the windows for the first time and he jumped to his feet like a scalded cat.
“Because I don’t intend to!” John said, vehemently. With his unoccupied hand he reached between them and grabbed Sherlock’s forearm, which made him aware of their joined hands again, still tightly holding each other. It helped him focus, literally something to hold on to. John made him turn his head. “Sherlock, what do you think I was doing at Greg’s? What do you think he is to me?” he asked puzzled at seeing Sherlock’s face. Sherlock shrugged.
He dumped his bag in a corner, carefully placing the violin case on top of it. He then closed the curtains. He didn't want to be watched, not even by the sun, or the bee, or anything or anyone else who wasn't himself. Actually he didn't even want to be here himself, but it couldn't be helped. He couldn't hide from himself. As much as he would like to.
“Of course I have,” he reached into his breast pocket and pulled Sherlock’s phone out. It was warmed by his own body heat.
They were standing around the corner of their destination. Sherlock could almost feel the pull towards the shelter behind the shiny black door of 221 Baker Street. But they weren’t there yet.
"Hmmm, I can think of a few, yeah… watching you the whole time was very… uhm… stimulating," John grinned back.“Pity about the Purple Pirate dress though. You sure it's lost? Can't we go back to the club and get it? Or send Mycroft? I will miss it.”
He could see that this pulled the strings that kept Sherlock moving. Let him change from crunching down to rising up, taking leaps,  bowing his body in impossible ways, flexing his back, raising his arms high above his head only to slump down, restlessly stretch his legs again to turn and turn and turn.  John was barely able to catch a glimpse of his face. Bending his knees of obviously tired legs hardly keeping him upright, Sherlock didn't stop, kept going, on and on. Faltering, gaping breath, a desperate silent whine in between.
“No,” Sherlock answered, fondly, “you wouldn’t be you otherwise.” He gave John a warm smile. “And you’re incapable of bothering me.” Sherlock locked eyes with John for a while and John realised that this had been Sherlock’s version of ‘I know, …’. A grin spread on his face.
I get paid. Absolutely paid! For this… the… uhm… talking!” he said, a bit too loud for John’s liking. And a bit too — well, what was it...? Artificial? Not sincere? Was he lying to John? John’s brow furrowed and he couldn’t exactly find a reason for the stab of pain he felt in his chest. He only grunted as a response.
"I have to collect my bag first though. I can't leave my belongings in this place considering we won't come back here."
Without any possibility to be sure if his plan had worked John decided he had done everything he could. At least at this moment. He didn't dare to think of all the wasted opportunities in the past and how he could have prevented this. When he could have done something, much earlier. It would pull him down into the dark and muddy depth he tried to avoid at the moment. No benefit in looking back. Nothing that could be changed there. However the future might. Although not by waiting and hoping, but by hoping and doing. That's what he tried right now. Keeping up hope. Trying to think what else he could do. How could he contain information that would lead him to Sherlock? Would he be able to coax Mycroft into telling him? Probably not. The man had kept secrets of the kind that John probably wasn't even able to imagine. There was still Greg, who might be able to check airlines and check-ins. Maybe even international airports. Perhaps he could bring Greg to call in help from Interpol? But where to start looking? What would be Sherlock's country of choice to hide. Something far away probably. Or even exactly the opposite? Would he expect John to assume he'd go far away and stay much closer on purpose? Or was it a double bluff and he'd escape to a far away country after all because he'd have predicted that John would think that he'd think…
to know by now…” He fell silent, not knowing how to react. Thoughts, emotions, fears and sorrows whirling in his mind. Did Sherlock really think that low of him? Where had that come from? Who had hurt him this much, that he would expect people to react this way? Suddenly some gears clicked into space. “You still don’t trust me.” He said a bit more forcefully, taken aback.
My most heartfelt "Thank You" to all of you for reading along. These two silly boys talking, mostly between the words, helped me to get through this Christmas season and I sincerely hope they brought you some joy and happiness as well.
"Huh?" John frowned, distracted by the map of the London underground he was now studying. "What?" Seriously — what was Scott talking about
"Ohhh… if I didn't love you so much, you foolish boy, I'd pull your ears and tie them under your chin!" she had snarled. “Drink your tea, young man. You look horrible!” She had nudged Sherlock’s cup a bit closer. “And that’s not negotiable! It’s an order!”
This time, knowing he had said what had needed to be said, he could allow all the happiness to bubble up and to infuse the way he met John's kiss; much firmer, less chaste. A tight press of dry lips moving against each other, slowly more and more sliding, moistened by nipping teeth, sucking lips, the tips of tongues darting out, tracing lines.
! He did mean it. He’d always be Sherlock’s friend, regardless of the outcome of this meeting, this talk. Damn, it all sounded so bloody formal and serious. Although, maybe a bit of formality would be for the best. They’d had enough emotional mess and drama and misunderstanding. Serious it was, so serious it should be treated.
Ashamed, John lowered his eyes, but Sherlock caught them and almost invisibly shook his head. John understood and was grateful—that part was dealt with. Done. Chapter closed.
The never-changing cheeriness of the song now stood in contrast to their slowing movements, to time slowing down, to the anticipation and possibilities and probabilities and desire-heavy laden atmosphere.
“Don’t go all sentimental on me, Watson!” Greg tried to banter, but John could see that he was moved nonetheless. “Just… get on with it and get your guy, yeah? That’d be thanks enough… if I won’t have to watch you two morons pining after each other anymore.”
Still lying on his belly John grabbed his phone and opened his music app. Scrolling through his playlists his thumb hesitantly hovered for a moment right above the one playlist called ‘Fucking Shit’ before finally tapping on it. He avoided looking when the list of songs appeared, scrolling blindly a bit down, knowing what would have awaited him at the very top of it.
“Didn’t want to say it, mate, but now you mention it…,” Greg teased again. God, John was so grateful for Greg being in his life. That man really had kept him sane the last weeks. He could see more and more the reason why it was Greg who had been the only person to handle Sherlock in his early days of consulting for the Yard. Maybe even the only person who ever would have gotten him so far in the first place.
It only popped back up in his mind, when one night after a show he spotted Miss Pirate in a remote corner of the club, talking in hushed tones with the owner. The moment John wanted to approach them, the guy pulled out his wallet, sneakily handing over cash which Miss Pirate immediately shoved into the pocket of her bag.
"Nah, it's alright, Greg. Tomorrow is another day, right? We both need some hours of sleep, I think." John released him from his friendship duties. Immediately Greg looked immensely grateful. "It's your day off tomorrow, right? Any plans?"
“Well…?” He prompted. When John only stared at the ceiling, he added: “Now comes the talking part, you know…”
John's eyes grew wider and wider, his breath became a bit shallow and a confusing mix of warmth of a variety of origins flooded his body and mind. He hadn't known, suspected yes but never considered to this extent, what those things meant for Sherlock; what they did to Sherlock. He knew Sherlock liked him being a doctor, and his military kink was more than obvious. However, that these things, which were basically just John being John, were everything Sherlock desired and wanted, was a bit mind-blowing to be honest.
. Yoga guy? Or the jogger? He was quite handsome as well. Scott had to be handsome, right? With that voice? But what if he was just an ordinary looking bloke? Most likely John wouldn’t even look at him twice. What though, if
When Sherlock didn’t answer, just rolled his eyes and looked away again, she added: “And not just me, you know?” There was a hint more stubborness in her voice now. Sherlock sighed.
breathing—made John’s eyes well up with tears of gratitude. Slowly, tenderly, he let his fingertips slide down Sherlock’s torso, aware and relieved that it gave him a reason to hide the traitorous moisture in his eyes.
After sorting out limbs and tissues and clothes, after getting themselves cleaned and freshened up, after sharing some reassuring kisses, they settled on the sofa; too emotional to go to bed, too many things still unsaid.
“Right then,” he nodded, couldn’t hold back the grin spreading on his lips. He saw that it was contagious, Sherlock's smile started to stretch, parted his lips slightly, formed that dimple on his left cheek John loved so much and the laugh lines around Sherlock’s eyes appear, which were proof that the detective wasn’t as gloomy as he always tried to pretend to be. Yes, this was his Sherlock. The one he had been looking for for months. Years, if one counted the time Sherlock had been away. John didn’t allow his thoughts to go there. This was now and Sherlock was here—right in front of him. Within reach. Not only that, but holding his hands!
“Unscared skin, on the pale side it’s said,” Scott began after a moment, more quiet now, his breathing evident in each word. John held his, impatient to finally learn more about his mystery guy. “On top we start with the claviculae, rather sharply pronounced due to minimal fatty tissue…” Scott continued, almost murmured under his breath, although clearly audible for John, as if spoken close to the speaker. It had something thrillingly intimate. “Same applies to the costae, I’m afraid they’re quite visible at the flanks. If your… fingers…” Scott swallowed audibly, “would continue in the direction of the sternum however, there would be, I dare say, noticeable pectoralis muscles covering them.”
“How did you even do that? Jeez…,” John couldn’t believe his eyes. He ran a hand through his own hair, still staring in horror.
"Then stop behaving like my pimp," Sherlock growled between breaths, marking his words with the bold movements of his pelvis, raising himself only to sink down on John's stiff prick again with vigour. "Because you're not!" he hissed, never faltering in his efforts. Sweat making his skin sheen, and his curls cling to his forehead. John held on for dear life, even though he was convinced he had actually died by now; if this was heaven or hell he was not sure yet. "I'm not yours to sell. Nor anyone's." Sherlock's short hot breaths met John's parted lips, they shared the spare oxygen in the narrow space between their faces. Sherlock relentlessly rolled his hips, rose and fell in John's lap. John's sight started to blur at the edges, even if his focus on Sherlock never lost its sharpness. "But you, acting as if you own me..." Sherlock went on, voice becoming rough and ragged, interrupted by breathless grunts and moans, "... is exactly the same thing."
“This, Sherlock. Don’t think you’re alone in this. We’ve all been there. I’ve been there, God knows.
John never called. At least not in the last few months. So it had to be urgent? He had no choice, he had to answer the phone.
And he had needed an outlet. Needed to get rid of the heavy cape of dirty grey sentiment that threatened to pull him down, to bury him alive. He needed to get clean. Get bare.
“Don’t want to let me wait, do you? Go on then. Shoes off!” Sherlock said in the same detached tone of voice.
“Of course,” Sherlock said in his ‘don’t-be-an-idiot-John’-tone, but all sharpness was lost in the hoarseness of his voice and the desire dazed gaze.
"As much as I loathe to confess it," Sherlock said after a moment, trying to sound aloof but the slight shaking of his voice and the trembling hand reaching up to caress John's forearm betrayed his attempts. "I appear to be quite sentimental about the Purple Pirate dress as well. It was… special. We can have something similar though, custom made. I already looked up a specialised tailor for more exclusive kinky stuff. We can make an appointment after our quarantine period, what do you think?" Sherlock offered excitedly, looking over his shoulder up at John, who knew he didn't have to answer because that decision was already made. "On their website I discovered that they also have a variety of other options; they really do live up to their reputation."
"Okay, true. Hedgehog rather..." Sherlock drew his eyebrows together as if contemplating, but grunted out a laugh when John poked him in his side.
Sherlock was already standing up from his chair, making his way to the door as he stopped and silently said without even turning: “That shouldn’t be any of your concern, Mycroft.”
"Right. Get it. Overstayed my welcome… in my own home. Haha." Greg joked, rubbing his neck again. Was he straightening his spine and pulling in his stomach? Greg? Puffing out his chest? Really? "I'll just go take a quick shower then, yeah? Won't be long…" All that still not said to John. No. Mycroft even nodded in confirmation. John couldn't believe his ears and eyes. He felt invisible. He could just as well have stayed in bed, do belly dancing, turn into a Hobbit or vanish… the two men wouldn't care less. He huffed a laugh. Still smiling he shook his head.
"Christ, Sherlock!" John hissed as if Sherlock had just confessed to have kidnapped someone. "Alright, alright." he tried to calm down. "It's nothing," he mumbled to himself while preparing and arranging everything, "can shave a face, can shave an arse, skin and hair, skin and hair, all the same…"
It was too much, Sherlock had lost track, his mind unable to keep up. He felt the path underneath his feet become a bit wobbly. John was there, held him, steadied him with his gaze. Their fingers untangling, for the first time in it felt like ages. His hand felt incomplete like this, amputated. Immediately John’s hand was back though; both of his holding one of Sherlock’s.
Obviously unaware of John's presence,  Sherlock rummaged in a kind of nook hidden from John's view. He seemed to be agitated, restless, tense. He pulled out some items, let them drop carelessly next to his feet. He seemed to search for something specific which apparently he didn't find. This was confirmed when he slammed his flat hand against the wall and cursed something John couldn't exactly understand across the hall. But when Sherlock suddenly stood, running his fingers through his hair and yelled "Fuck!" from the top of his lungs, John started to worry. Hearing Sherlock swear like that was a very rare occurrence in itself, witnessing him do so in the state he seemed to be in was even worse. What was he searching for? Was it the drugs John had disposed of after Sherlock's break down? Did Sherlock expect to find them here? He hadn't taken them after all… He almost tended to leave his hiding place when he saw Sherlock slightly shaking his head and starting to look around, scanning the room to all sides as if to be sure not to be watched. Although he hadn't moved one inch, John withdrew further into the shadows. He felt himself getting smaller by the second, shrinking, crumbling…
So he had picked only his most necessary belongings to live through a couple of days and had contacted Mycroft again. They had agreed that the cooperation would be much easier, if Sherlock stayed at Mycroft's… or maybe, Sherlock had insisted… just a little bit. And here he was. In this impersonal room, with its perfectly comfortable bed, with its neatly made up linens, with its everyday dusted furniture, with its emptiness, with it's Johnlessness.
He picked up his phone and unlocked the screen. His fingers found the speed dial without thinking and when he pressed the button ‘1’ he wondered how long it had been since he had last used it. It must have been ages.
A hiss and a sharp exhale, followed by what John assumed was a confirming grunt, was all the answer he needed.
“Just say the words. Just tell me.” Sherlock, inhaling shakily, tightened his grip, almost crushed John’s hand.
He clenched his hands around the corners of his seat, tried to hold on for dear life, not able to think one coherent thought. He could feel her body warmth seeping through the fabric of his trousers, only adding to the heat pooling underneath. His body was on fire and he didn’t know how much longer he would be able to stand it.
John swallowed. Suddenly it got pretty hot here behind the stage. Someone forgot to turn down the heat? He remembered his disappointment when he had been seated in front of the stage, not being able to take a look under that skirt. Now though, he got rewarded more than he had dared to hope for. Standing behind the stage meant also standing behind Miss Pirate, meant also two sinfully plush globes of pale skin barely covered by a black lace panty now in full sight. The straps of the suspenders straining over the oh so familiar flesh, leading the gaze downwards towards the crotch, where a bulge caused by very much not female bits stretched the thin black fabric. John’s breath hitched and he felt his face heat up. This was definitely worth his position
"John!" Sherlock called, pulling John back into the moment, already reaching for the door handle. "Do you have your gun?”
Their discussion had led to them suggesting the wildest code words, throwing them into fits of laughter, releasing and easing the tension of the previous events. When Sherlock finally came up with ‘Vatican Cameos’ they both had found it that hilarius and absurd that they’d agreed on it without hesitation.
“Yes.” Sherlock said, calmly, closing his eyes for a short moment before looking back at him, “Yes, John, you’re right.”
“You assumed damn right then.” He nodded. He set his tea cup back on the table trying to hide the tremor in his hand. “So… he… it worked then? He… he heard it?” He asked nervously. Dread and hope and embarrassment fighting and roiling in his stomach. When Mycroft only nodded slightly and no other information came forth, John frowned.
“Oh bollocks!” John huffed, letting go of the remaining bit of his clothes, only hoping Mrs Hudson wouldn't make her way upstairs.
was getting hotter and hotter. With his one unoccupied hand he fought off the thousands of blankets, being afraid of combusting on the spot and when his evil mind provided him with a sultry purr directly into his ear, saying
John smiled faintly, pleased, and Sherlock could relate. It felt like they'd taken a huge step, one of the most important of all. There was a weight taken off his shoulders. Even if a different one was put in its place. Though, the former one had seemed like an unsolvable burden, a debt he didn't know how to repay, a currency he didn't know how to spend. However the second one was a purpose, a commitment—to make sure that John Watson never had to live a life that didn't feel like his own ever again; to make sure he never again thought his life was not important or worthless.
He kicked at his blankets, it was getting much too warm underneath. He got fidgety and shifted restlessly under his sheets. A fine layer of sweat started to cover his chest and lower back and John felt more and more uneasy. Only when he wanted to get rid of the t-shirt he normally slept in he got aware that his left hand had sneaked into his pants and was tightly gripping his cock, already hard and dotting his underwear with wet spots of precome. Suddenly, all sensations narrowed down, concentrated and zoomed in on the cause of his current turmoil. They all fused into one tight knot of lust and longing which burst and seared through his veins and almost overwhelmed him. He gasped. He had no capacity or will stop. His body was screaming for release - God, how long had it been - and his mind opened all floodgates and drowned him in flashes of memories, fantasies, dreams and hopes he had denied himself for far too long.
be the reason to delight the whole neighborhood with your angry choice of coping music? Hadn’t Sherlock fled from this in the first place? How very nice to come back to exactly the same mess as before. Stupid.
"See…" now they were getting there. John needed to understand. It hurt. God, did it hurt. But it needed to be done.
They just lay there for a while, panting; John sticking to Sherlock's back who was sticking to the sheets. When John got a bit of his breath back he pressed a tiny kiss to the sweaty nape of his lover and chuckled.
Sherlock was still facing the window. He had closed his eyes, not wanting to watch the world outside of 221b Baker Street right now. Didn't want to be distracted by anything that didn't matter. There was really only one point of interest.
"No…" John tried to recall the man's words. "He said something like… caring is not advisable and that one only gets one's heart broken otherwise?" He knew that wasn't the precise words but he memory of the whole evening was a bit muddled in his brain. The only things he was able to remember very clearly were related to dark night eyes and fan-like lashes, a lean body clad in purple velvet and black leather, tight straps straining over soft flesh, endlessly long legs covered in lace thin like spider-web… "Spider!" John shouted, looking at Sherlock with wide eyes." He called himself Spider!"
There were two yellow post-it notes stuck on first the plate and second the kettle - the same notes he used to plaster his deduction walls with. They read “
A story popped into his mind Mycroft had read to him as a child. Of course he had been much younger than was advised for this book, but that was the way it had always worked with the two of them. He had always been out of his time. It was a story about a little curly haired girl living on her own, away from the outside world. In an old amphitheater. Helping other people by listening to them and figuring out what they needed. Always on the run from the government's grey men in suits. He just now realised why he had always loved the story and related so much to the protagonist.
“Oh, I'd love for Mycroft to pick it up and bring it over," Sherlock grinned, "but I'm afraid Moriarty's minions took my bag with all my belongings including the dress when they found me. I haven't seen it back. Don't know what he has done with it. Probably getting a plushie Purple Pirate made of it."
"By your request, I will reassure Dr Watson of your wellbeing. Although I doubt that he will settle for the sparse information he will get. I'm afraid that he will unleash his misdirected fury upon me." Mycroft confirmed.
Finally, preventing himself from hitting the ground just in time, he lay on his front in the dust. His whole body trembling, not able to move anymore.
“And that doesn’t mean by the way, that you aren’t brave already,” interrupted John. “I told you, I think you’ve always been brave. Maybe you just don’t see it yourself…”
Nonetheless he arranged the breastplate and fixed it behind his neck. John tilted his head and wrinkled his brow, watching Sherlock push and squeeze those fake boobs to get them in place.
Nobody seemed to look suspicious, nobody watched him or laughed at him. So it must have been standard procedure then?
So, how was he supposed to have a sensible conversation there and then? Being brutally pulled out of his reverie, still half lingering in his mind's delights, facing the object of his indecent thoughts and trying to withstand the almost unnatural gravity surrounding his… friend?
If John was absolutely honest, which of course he was NOT, then he would have to admit, that this were the best moments of his god damn crazy life. But what he did instead of being honest, was muttering curses and glaring daggers at Sherlock who seemed to be oblivious to his current state.
Pirate. How dare they?? Oh right… They were in a club, wouldn’t do without audience. In the meanwhile Miss Pirate had fetched a chair from somewhere and twirled it with one hand while rounding it.
Okay, this was enough, too much. He had to stop this. Now! However, the phone was glued to his ear and his thumb apparently didn’t remember where to find the red speaker button.
"I… I'm not sure… if that'd be wise, John. What would we have to say to each other anyway? Bouncing pleasantries back and forth? Blaming each other for occurrences in a far gone past one can't change anymore anyway? Don't you think it'd be better to spare us both from that? I'm tired of  it."
Sherlock was sure that his mind had short circuited and his heart had a meltdown and that was the reason why he couldn’t speak. Problem was, it seemed that John wasn’t finished yet. He’d definitely not survive this.
"Good." Plain relief. Simple and plain and honest relief. Almost seeping through the speaker. Almost seeping into Sherlock's brain and heart and soul. Almost.
But why would John need this volume and why the hell would he need to listen to the same song on repeat? This had to stop! Immediately! But how? Staring down the phone hadn’t worked, but Sherlock absolutely wouldn’t give in and go upstairs to beg for it! Never!
“Yeah… guess I am.” John huffed, out of breath, and smiled warmly. God, he had really lost his mind, hadn’t he? Well, never mind, if losing one’s mind was this much fun, he’d sign up for it in an instant.
"No. Didn't know, if… do you think I should? What if he doesn't want to see me?" John rubbed the back of his hand over his forehead.
After that text message from Sherlock, after Sherlock had apparently discovered the song and understood what John had wanted to say, John had gotten cold feet. He hadn’t dared to answer immediately, overwhelmed by the sheer amount of possible outcomes of such a talk. He started to wonder if he maybe had only acted upon the hope Sherlock would decline anyway. Always easy to blame someone else for your own cowardice.
It took John until the next morning, pondering the whole night. He should do something. But what? Greg was right, he wasn't the one to help. Even though he had proven to be a great friend. He had tried, but he couldn't give John what he really needed. Actually there was only one person who would be able to help in any way. And John didn't desire to make use of this possibility. First of all because Sherlock wouldn't appreciate it, certainly quite the opposite, and second because John still wasn't over their last encounter. Damn Mycroft. Damn him, knowing about everything. He fucking knew and still he had let John walk right into the trap. Even more, he had given him a shove in the back.
Already, John was about to continue convincing Sherlock that this really was a good way for them to approach the issues they needed to talk about when he realised that, completely unexpectedly, Sherlock snickered.
He stared at it. This sounded frighteningly familiar. Almost too much to be a coincidence. But this can’t be what John had meant. Why would he go back there? There was nothing to talk about after all this time. And more importantly, it had never been John’s responsibility to save his life in the first place. Neither during the operation, nor afterwards, nor before it had even happened. He did save him though. John was the only reason Sherlock was still alive! Not medical skills of the doctors, not a surgery-shot of the woman known as Mary. Only John had been motivation enough to fight back to life. But that was something the man himself didn’t know and never needed to know. Not ever. This article had to be a coincidence… He decided not to dwell on it and quickly went back to his search and kept on scrolling.
John threw his arms up in helplessness. He walked into the kitchen, put on the kettle, first choice of activity to regain some composure. He switched the kettle off again, turned, squinted his eyes.
Sherlock swaying on his feet, hips moving in sync,  muscles rippling underneath scarred skin suddenly merging into Sherlock’s backlit figure against the window of their flat, his features highlighted by the glow of the little rainbow-coloured light bulbs, playing his violin… ‘
"I think…" John said, a bit breathless, "I can make an exception for this one. Dig as deep as you want…"
"Tickles!" Sherlock giggled and squirmed, but didn't move an inch away, nor did he loosen his hold. "John, your beard!"
John’s blood first ran cold before heating up to boiling point immediately afterwards. He coughed, looked around, certain everyone was able to x-ray his brain and private parts and deduce his urge to slam Sherlock against the next shelf and rip his clothes off to indulge and enjoy all of that body hair which would come off at the end of the day.
John got moving again as well, glanced back, wondering. What the fuck? What did that bloke think? That he was Scott The Voice or what? Ha, as if. John huffed. Then, his head whipped back around. What if indeed though? How would John know? He didn't know anything about Scott after all. Although… the guy's voice wasn't right. John
His never yielding erection was evidence enough though, that his interest hadn’t faltered in the slightest. Neither had John’s; a simmering heat was still throbbing in his cock. In a wordless understanding though, as was common between them, they had settled in companionable endurance of their mutual want to get the job done.
Why was all this so complicated? He had always been of the opinion that it all was nothing but simple chemistry. If that would be true he had found a solution long ago. Literally…
John darted forward and, without any ado, licked a broad wet stripe over Sherlock’s beautifully displayed entrance. He winced at the bitterness of the shaving foam on his tongue but the surprised gasp and the power to shut that pert mouth up for a moment was absolutely worth it. So he did it again and again, pointing his tongue, flicking and teasing, pressing it firmly against the rim. When there was nothing left of his partner than a muttering and trembling mess, he trailed one long slow path from perineum over Sherlock’s cleft up to his tailbone, lingering a moment, flicking and twirling his tongue over the sensitive spot he knew drove Sherlock crazy. As expected it elicited goosebumps and shivers all over Sherlock’s body and John continued his way upwards to soothe and smooth the tingling skin. Small licks and lewd kisses up his spine made Sherlock moan and squirm and when in the end John reached his nape, blew his hot breath up his neck and sucked on his earlobe, Sherlock all but collapsed onto the mattress, leaving John no choice than to bump onto him, trapping him under his weight.
Mike looked at him thoughtfully for a moment before a little smirk crossed his lips, there and gone.
In silent agreement they refrained from taking a cab even though it meant a walk of an hour to get back. It would give them time to adjust to the new situation. Sherlock wanted nothing more than to have John back at 221B, at the same time he was nervous. What would it mean to come home as more than just friends? How much more than friends were they now? Were there expectations? Or rules on how to behave? Did John have expectations? They hadn't particularly defined their status, they hadn't even clearly vocalised it yet. Was it what Sherlock thought it was and wanted it to be? What if John didn't mean it the way Sherlock thought he did? What if…
Feeling lost, John rubbed a hand over his face, lingered, the hand clasped over his mouth. Deep in thought, he turned his head slightly, slowly, and let his lips slide over the rough side of his forefinger. He felt his own warm breath ghost over his clammy skin. His focus shifted, from irrevocable incidents and past places to the here and now, to his own body. Narrowing down, turning an unintentional and insignificant touch into the centre of his attention. It felt strange, the contrast between the brushes of vivid warm puffs of air and the chilly nightly breeze. The rough cold skin of his knuckles, slightly numb, touch only registered like through a layer of wool, against the over-sensitive soft tissue of his lips. It was a give and take of sensation. The rough smoothing the soft, the warmth leaving traces on the cold. The tingling on the lips increasing, the numb fingers fading into the background of awareness. The overload of sensation made the tingle merge into numbness. The ongoing movement forces numb skin into sensation. Humid breath leaving a moist layer on knuckles where it brushed over them. Lips drying damp fingers under their warm touch. The soft slightly scratchy sound the contact caused recognised from inside and outside of his head.
"When will you…" apparently he had stared open mouthed without realising, because he was a bit hoarse. He cleared his throat. "I mean the make-up… Do you need help there as well?"
He felt a drop of sweat run down his temple, following a path next to his earlobe along his jaw and down his throat to pool in the small hollow above his collarbone. The slight tickling send a shiver down his spine, his skin being over-sensitive sending high-voltage through his synapses. He didn’t allow it to distract him. He had to be in charge, controlled, shielded.
John snapped around, never easing his hold on Moriarty, and looked straight into a pale face, blank and cold as stone.
"Don't worry, John. It doesn't bother me. So it shouldn't bother you. For my part let him be happy with it; as long as he stays away from you. From us. Maybe it's good this chapter is closed and we start writing our own story. Together."
"I do, indeed." Mycroft answered and John wondered how such innocent words could sound that indecent. John hoped for the ground to open up and swallow him, when Mycroft added as if John wasn't even in the room: "I hope, by then, you'll have finished your efforts to make your boat… steadfast." Mycroft made it sound like a challenge which Greg immediately picked up on. John felt like watching a match of ping pong.
"When?" he whined. He was really so done with this case, he couldn't bear any more of it anytime soon.
!! Somehow all my senses screamed… dunno… it sounds silly, but…" the fond chuckle was back. John's mood swings were impressive, fascinating, so very him. It made Sherlock's mind swirl and swim as it always did. Damn John Watson for being so very much him. How was Sherlock supposed to withstand him. The chuckle died down, a seriousness in its place that made Sherlock swallow. "I don't even know what it was, but something told me… 'Don't let that man go. Hold on to him. Keep him'. That's what I'm trying ever since."
Preparations… That was what had pulled him out of his thoughts. He had realised that he hadn’t much time and opportunity left to fetch the last remaining belongings he wanted to take with him from Baker Street. And if he wanted to avoid running into anyone, he only had nighttimes to make use of. Which meant his only opportunity was the following night… or now. He weighed it in his mind and decided that he couldn’t take the risk to waste his only chance because he would be hampered or worse...interrupted. Better to make his first attempt now and, if needed, try again during the following night. Sure, he could also send some of Mycroft’s minions, but he didn’t trust them to pick the right things and furthermore… a bunch of men absolutely discreetly clad in all black driving up in an absolutely discreet black sedan might attract some attention and give some clues about his whereabouts. No, he had to go himself. And he had to be careful.
However, his chair held him hostage. He was glued to the surface. His gaze never left his brother while the presenter chattered on, unaware of the storm her unconsidered craving for recognition left behind.
That it truly had been John on the radio. That John would tell the whole world… well, half of Britain… about his feelings. For Sherlock. After the horrible day when John had found him at Battersea, he had to admit that there had been signs. Now in retrospect, maybe… just maybe… Sherlock had seen, but not observed. John had tried to get in contact. Only, Sherlock hadn't realised the depth of John's affection.
