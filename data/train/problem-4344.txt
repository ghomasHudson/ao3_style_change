“Hey,” Sam was in front of Dean then, him and his Gigantor legs bending down to look at Dean from over the top of Miracle’s head. “How about you and I take off for a few days, huh? Find a hunt somewhere close, get some air.”
“So much,” Cas said eventually. He couldn’t even look at Dean; his words dove straight for Dean’s throat, choking him. “You’re just so much.”
“She doesn’t need to see him. Not like this,” Dean insisted, and it felt like a losing battle, almost like he was trying to tell his mother what to do, and the thought made him wince, ears flushing with shame.
“Dean.”
“No, no you don’t. You said it yourself, you’ve been different. Not just on this last hunt, not with what’s been going on with Cas, but this entire year.”
“Cas,” His voice got caught somewhere along the way, crackling in his throat as he swallowed and breathed. He stared at a single patch of carpet in front of him. “I don’t know how this works anymore. I don’t even know if you can hear me but— if you can, you gotta know… I
He’d almost forgotten what it was like to be in the fire, right in the hot seat, and now he was broiling in it, breathing thick and heavy through dirt and grime, his hands shaking around the grip of his gun.
“I used to think it wasn’t but… but I want to. I want to try, Cas.”
as they had made their way out of the hospital and fumbled into the car, Cas tripping into the back seat face first, groaning in pain as they sped off before the police could show.
The tattoo artist leaned back in her seat with a silent glare, lips pursing. Dean did his best to smile at her, but the feeling of Cas’s skin beneath his hands was distracting and the action came out horribly shaky. He forced out a breath, eyes trailing down to where he’d grabbed Cas by the stomach to hold him down again.
Almost like he wasn’t upset that he’d managed to scrape the entire left side of his face off, the skin that
“Call me if you need anything.” He said, attempting to pull the blankets back over Sam who slapped his hands away.
“Shut up,” Dean growled.
Watching the two of them navigate this thing after nearly losing it entirely had been the only thing holding Dean together for the longest time. It had given him something to hope for, to look upon and think,
The desire to kiss Cas is almost crippling.
Dean clenched his jaw. His eyes dashed away, avoiding someone that wasn’t even there. He could feel Sam staring at him from his right, painfully patient.
could really use you here.”
He just knew that Cas, somehow, was also his name, and that the universe carried it towards him with a voice he didn’t recognize and a jaded pair of green eyes that looked strangely close to tears.
“What’s wrong? What happened?” Sam demanded, quickly setting his coffee aside to grab Dean by the shoulder.
“Fuck, I’m sorry,” Dean rasped. Sam was eying him warily, but he stayed silent, patient as ever. “You keep asking me all these questions and I— I don’t
“The blood, Sam. Does it have to be fresh?”
“Odd is one word for it.”
know, but Dean’s guilt outweighed all of it when it came to Jack. At that point, not telling the truth would have just hurt all of them more.
Dean was drunk. That much was obvious now.
He wanted to ask that more than anything.
Fuck. Should he have sent an emoji or something? Cas used to send them sporadically, smiling to himself like an idiot every time Dean caved and sent him some half assed thumbs up. Maybe it would make him happy.
“And what’s that?” Dean pressed.
Cas was right. He was being
Dean jerked up at the sound of Sam’s voice, eyes wide and guilt ridden. As discreetly as possible, Dean wrenched his arm back behind him, hiding the spoonful of peanut butter he’d been feeding to the vibrating Miracle at his feet.
“Yeah, well, you’ve been ignoring me for a while now anyway. So this is me giving you your space.”
The snow had already begun to let up, but the wind that carried the specs of white was still cold and unforgiving, burying itself into Cas's hair and pushing it in all directions, the absurdity of it making Dean laugh even more than the look on Cas’s face.
Dean gasped, startled by the hands that flew to him in the dark, framing the sides of his face.
“What about you?” Castiel nodded, pushing over a tower of red chips and watching them scatter. “You never answered what—”
“Christ,” Dean breathed, sliding into the closest seat at the bar. His free hand instantly moved to fiddle with one of the pepper shakers, swirling it around absently.
He thought about Charlie and Stevie and their sunlit apartment in Oregon, where they had been spending the last week issuing adoption papers for a little black boy with the kind of smile that made your chest melt into pure gold. He thought about Jesse and Cesar in New Mexico, together and retired on a horse plowed farm with apple trees lining the driveway, truly at peace, achieving the impossible.
Once Castiel’s feet were sewn up and bandaged and Dean had given him the rundown about walking slowly, being careful, open-toed shoes only— Dean moved to his busted knees. The pair of jeans he was wearing were just baggy enough to be able to roll them up from the bottom instead of having to take them off, but there was still something about being crouched down in front of Cas’s bare legs that made Dean’s hands unnaturally shaky.
“I’m a hundred feet away from you, Sam. Can’t this wait?” Dean tried, shrinking into himself.
Sam melted with a smile. “I don’t plan to be.”
“Time,” Cas repeated, finally raising his head to look over at Dean with a dip in his brow. Dean stopped; his fingers were brushing Cas’s ear. “Are you going to be able to handle that?”
“You can be quite over enthusiastic about certain things,” Castiel mumbled through a mouthful, looking up at Dean to find the man staring incredulously. Cas stifled a smile. “I was almost certain pie was one of them.”
“Cas,” He said.
“What case, Dean?” Sam asked tiredly, giving in to that urge, that need to be honest with Dean in the hopes that it made it easier for him to be honest with himself. “We both know there’s nothing in this town that needs killing.”
“Anything. Everything. It— it's overwhelming. What I feel, what I’ve been through, what
“Dean?” Cas tensed in the sudden silence. He turned to try and look at Dean, hoping to catch his expression. “Dean, you’re beginning to worry me. What’s—”
Dean straightened immediately, all amusement, all sarcasm draining from his face. He shoved the Impala’s keys into his jacket pocket and bent his head down to catch Cas’s gaze.
about you,” Sam said instead, and Jack raised his head with shining eyes. His chin was quivering, the miserable kind of sorrow residing just behind his features, waiting to burst free, and Sam latched on desperately. “I don't know what you want. I don’t know where you wanna be.”
“Odd is one word for it.”
“You’ve got no idea the kind of shit your boy here is in,” Lundy’s grip on Castiel tightened, fingers curling just enough around his windpipe to have Cas clawing weakly at his wrist. “Escaping the Empty? Returning to Earth not once, but twice? Now, that’s somethin’ that don’t just happen every Sunday,” He nodded at Castiel smugly. “Every demon and angel in the country has got their eyes peeled for this one. Hoping to make things right.”
Even after the leviathans had obliterated Castiel’s vessel, ripped apart his grace, against all odds he had come
“Nothing, don’t worry about it,” Sam brushed off, clearly grossed out. He smiled tightly and moved a hand to Eileen’s back. “Hey, uh, Cas? This is Eileen. She’s—”
His head was pounding now that the pain medicine had worn off, a belch of nausea circling his gut, but all Dean could focus on was the heat in his arms, the steady beat of a heart pressed right up against his palm. He blinked through murky darkness and stared straight ahead, feeling without seeing.
Cas was falling. Dean could see that now, all of that confidence from before, all of that forced serenity and understanding was dripping away like wet paint, a false mask. He was just as afraid as Dean, troubled by where they stood; this strange inbetween of friendship and love that neither of them knew how to navigate, and for Dean that was all he needed to reach up and take Cas’s hand.
Dean shook his head and inched forward, moving until he was sitting at the very end of Cas’s bed with his hands in his lap. He didn’t miss the way Cas stiffened. He just chose to ignore it.
“I’m here, Sam,” He said in greeting, and Sam whipped around to find the kid smiling at him, his hand held up in a subdued little wave. “I never left. I told you, I’ll be watching over you all until Cas heals from the connection. That way, the plan won't... 'screw us in the ass' as Dean put it.”
And it’s sick, and it’s horrible, and it’s been nearly fifteen years, Dean should be past the pain of it, but it’s in that moment that he thought about John. His grief hollowed face staring back at Dean over a dog— a dog he would’ve hated, would’ve thrown out onto the side of the road the second he caught sight of it— rather than the puppy eyes of his brother, and Dean could feel himself flare up with anxiety, straighten as if called to attention by a commander, not a father.
He stirred when he felt a presence by his feet, his instinct being to kick blindly, but his body sank with relief once he looked down. One by one, Eileen made careful work of unlacing Dean’s muddy boots and sliding them off his feet. She gathered them up without a word and walked over to the kitchenette, placing them on the counter.
“Fine, just—” Sam gulped down the rest of the water without even finishing, spilling a little on his shirt. “Go save Cas, or whatever.”
Dean found himself outside Cas’s bedroom door later that night, hovering with an odd sense of nervousness coating his insides, licking the usual coolness from his posture. He was so used to avoiding Cas’s room completely, that the concept of knocking on the door with full intentions to
The hand that came up to cradle the back of Dean’s head was what did him in, the comfort in it overwhelming.
Dean believed it for a while, those following weeks so peaceful it was almost unsettling. There was no dirt beneath nail beds or pitchy hearing from too much shooting practice. Sleep finally felt like something Dean could have rather than steal, and Cas hadn’t had any more episodes since that freak out in the garage.
“You mean dead,” Castiel said absently. “I could have died on that road—”
“Okay,” Castiel forced out, voice pure gravel. “Yeah, okay.”
“Dean, what are you—”
“Just— scan his pie so we can go, please,” Cas suggested awkwardly. The kid jolted into action, shoveling items into grocery bags as fast as possible. “Thank you. We’re—” Dean gave Castiel a hard look. “
“Look, Sam and I are gonna do everything we can to try and help you get your memories back,” Dean told him, desperate to get Cas passed this. He started unwinding the wrappings with quick fingers, cutting them evenly. Cas didn’t argue when Dean drew closer this time, but his shoulders were tight and his breath fell heavy as Dean brushed over seared skin. “But at this point, I think we’re stuck playing the waiting game. We’ll just give it some time.”
“I was scared,” His soul split and cracked, eyes bleeding. “It scared me how much I cared.”
“I can’t think about that now,” Dean squeezed Sam’s shoulder as he pulled away, eyes flitting down the hall. He coughed, forcing the emotion out of his throat. “Not with Cas being—”
” Cas was smiling, the fullness of it evident in the lilt of his voice. “
“You wouldn’t be leaving me, Dean,” Sam tried to reason, eyes shining. “That’s just it. I’m not your responsibility anymore. I never
“Did it work?”
Sam threw him a desperate look, close to begging. “Dean, please. I’m not trying to—”
Dean snorted. “Sweeping me off my feet here, Cas.”
The heat fled back to Dean’s face in a senseless swarm, no amount of relief capable of stamping down the immediate swell of shock he felt course through him, blood pumping with it.
“You—” Sam reached up and stopped when he felt blood brush his fingertips, a faint trickle leaking from both nostrils. He fixed his brother with a glare and said, “What the hell, Dean?”
Dean raised his head with softened eyes, instinct having him poised and worried even before Eileen could get her words out.
“Because I care,” Dean heaved, and there’s a weight that followed. “I care a lot, Cas,” A weight that looked heavy and adoring reflected back in Cas’s eyes, both of them realizing with painstaking clarity that they had somehow managed to piece something of the past back together.
A figure appeared in front of them, shaking them apart.
It had probably been days, exhaustion making every minor movement feel like a whole body effort. He had two laptops open, a police scanner standing up to his right, and a beer in hand, clicking away article after article.
“That was pretty smooth, Cas,” He smiled, and Dean wondered if Cas could pick it out now. The warmth in his voice, how every part of him ached in moments like these when it was just the two of them. “You know, for an angel.”
Cas sighed. “I think you know the answer to that.”
Lundy released his grip on Cas’s throat, and the relief was instantaneous. Color broke free and fled to Castiel’s face, and he gasped as if surfacing water, spluttering through wet lungs, coughing until his ribs cried through every inhale.
Dean shrugged. “The guy could use one.”
“Damn it, we can still try!” Dean cried, thrashing in the dark, but it only took a second for everything to still when he felt their noses brush, his body shutting down completely.
The light never came.
Dean swallowed forcefully, letting his arm drop. He turned to Sam, forcing a smile, “Ice that shoulder, alright?”
Sam visibly deflated in the silence, and when he spoke next, his voice came out trembling, “I didn’t mean to make it seem like what’s going on with Cas isn’t—”
He watched silently as Cas staggered out of the car all on his own, following Dean without question. He looked over at Dean for a reaction, eyes hesitant, and Dean felt a curl in his stomach, a swarm of happiness that in turn made him force his expression into something cold as he passed Castiel and headed into the store.
Dean felt a tick in his jaw and looked up, meeting Cas’s eyes and finding nothing but hope and adoration, his eyebrows drawn in calming patience. He looked like he was waiting for something, for
“What are—”
“Don’t mind him, he hit his head pretty hard,” Sam said helpfully, coming up beside them to squeeze Claire’s shoulder. “He could really use a nap before you try and start explaining Gen Z to him.”
As Dean worked his way through disinfecting the cuts around Cas’s knees and trying not to swallow his tongue in the process, Cas stayed unnervingly quiet. His grunts of pain had slowly ebbed away, and the only indication to Dean that he was feeling anything at all were the sudden knots of tension appearing and disappearing around his thighs, carding down his calf muscles.
“Thanks, but I’m good,” Dean finally answered, grabbing his beer by the neck and standing up.
“Did he believe you?” Sam appeared to his right, bringing with him the kind of wordless comfort that had Dean breathing again, however shallow.
Dean raised his eyebrows. “You’re kidding.”
Sam swallowed down a lump of pain building in his throat, burning through his chest. Choked out, “He can’t just—”
“You’re oddly frustrating sometimes,” Castiel sighed, picking at the comforter.
And Dean sped on.
This wasn’t who he was supposed to be. He should be ashamed for even thinking otherwise.
It was a crime having to decide on a flavor of pie for the two of them once their food was gone, but Dean went with classic apple and didn’t look back, sticking to his gut.
Cas didn’t move. All he did was blink at Dean as if he’d just said something impossible, improbable, simply untrue, and it was with that same bewildered gaze that Cas frowned at him and pulled their hands apart.
To Dean’s relief, Cas at least had the decency to look appalled by the question. Dean could see his shoulders flinch even from beneath the thickness of his coat, the skin around his eyes wrinkling with shame. Cas even looked a little hurt, brows furrowed into this puppy eyed expression that had Dean releasing a stilted breath.
Dean had just managed to get his jeans off and tossed across the room when he heard Cas grunt from the opposite side of the bed, his arms dropping heavy and useless by his sides.
He wanted his question—
Everyone but the person who mattered most.
“I’ll be home as soon as I can,” He said, a promise of his own, and he tried not to imagine a life where saying this to Cas was normal and ‘home’ was something that they shared. “I’ll keep you updated.”
His skin flared to life the second the words were out, quick and thoughtless, batted up into the air where it hung over them like a physical weight. Dean flicked his eyes over to Cas, fear catching his breath, and found that Castiel was already looking at him, gaze chipped and shaped into something unbearably gentle that made Dean feel as if he was suspended in time.
He shook his head, trying to refocus. “Listen, Claire—”
“I should be punching you right now, you know,” Claire mumbled, unable to speak any louder without the shake in her voice getting noticed, and Dean nodded. He knew.
won't be able to…”
Dean would’ve found it endearing how Cas managed to look even more confused in that moment, but he was far too busy being disappointed.
“You’re referring to the incident earlier today,” Cas blinked up at him steadily, frowning the longer Dean continued to stand there.
for him in the way that he needed, the way that Dean craved in the dark and quiet. He could only articulate it in his dreams. The entirety of what he wanted, the vastness of it digestible so long as he was wading through the dimness of his own head. Things were different in the daylight. Dean wasn’t sure he’d ever be able to explain how even the timeless car parked in the garage meant nothing as long as Dean didn’t have anyone in the passenger seat next to him.
Dean waited for the sound of rustling sheets. He ached for a grumbling voice, rough with sleep but soft with fondness, embracing Dean with a feeling he’d only ever known as being home. But the moment dragged on, dread settling high in his throat as he stared at the grate at the bottom of the door, waiting for the sight of lamplight to spill out into the hallway.
“It doesn’t have to be, alright? I don’t want it to be, but
No response. Not a single peeking mess of dark hair over the seat. Dean let out a breath, hands tightening on the wheel before slipping further down, gripping it at the bottom.
Something shifted in Dean’s chest. Fast and particular. Small but significant. Dangerous, no doubt, but
It’s Sam who stirred first, bolting up in shock before turning to Dean in question. He lifted his eyebrows, panicking behind kind eyes.
” Sam raised the bottle. “Isn’t the solution. It never has been,” Sam’s eyes stayed perfectly trained on Dean’s face as he set the beer down on the counter behind him. “I’ve always stayed out of it because it’s
Dean wondered what would happen if he told Sam the truth. Whether it would lessen his guilt or pile on more, take some of the pain or multiply it tenfold. He knew Sam would try and convince Dean it wasn’t his fault, but his words wouldn’t even begin to make a dent; Dean had never felt so much like poison.
“What’s okay?”
However possible, Cas’s gaze seemed to grow even softer, the focus in his eyes turning slow and warm as he looked at Dean.
” Cas repeated. Dean could practically hear his pout, the indignant jut of his stubbled chin. “
“You made this for me?” He asked gently, fondness bleeding right through to his tongue.
go, and maybe it made Dean the biggest dumbass to ever exist, but he still wanted to
An infinite year old being who had witnessed space from the heavens, seen galaxies erupt and bloodlines run dry was telling Dean that he’d rather be riding shotgun with him than creating stars. And for once Dean was listening.
“So, very different from you then,” Castiel said, and it’s familiar, everything about him is familiar.
Cas didn’t even blink, utterly monotone, “Dean.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, I mean your form is shit and I’d rather not have you crush your own windpipe,” Sam said, already reaching forward and pulling the bar up himself, racking it while Dean frowned petulantly.
He didn’t expect her to look so...
Instantly, Sam started shouting above the deafening chaos.
“I think you would be more comfortable if you..." Cas muttered shakily, voice trailing off as he placed a comforting hand on Dean's shoulder.
Cas stared at Dean owlishly, features flickering between confused and flattered before tightening altogether, a deep rooted blush flooding to his cheeks. It was hard to see with the facial hair blocking the way, but Dean could see it rise up the bridge of Cas’s nose anyway, slithering towards his ears.
A slow creeping bitterness that made him want to stiffen up and cry, and he refused.
“This sure doesn’t feel like handling it,” Dean mumbled, rubbing a knuckle into the corner of his eye. He stood up abruptly, raising his eyebrows at Sam. “I think I’m gonna go for a supply run. Need anything?”
Dean didn’t know why he said it. Even Cas didn’t seem to understand the emotion in his own voice, how one word could be both a thousand questions and a million understandings, but the way he looked at Dean once he finally brushed past and joined him in the hallway— quiet and soft and profound as if just looking at Dean made him feel the most impossible things— that was something even Dean didn’t think could be a coincidence.
Oh. Right.
Dean tensed with anger instantly, mouth pulled into a snarl.
Because Dean gets trauma. He gets the nightmares and the pacing and staring off into nothingness for hours at a time, his body nothing but an empty, useless machine with no will to function, let alone live. He understands, in his head, that this is Cas now, and it’s not his fault when he shuts down, it’s not his fault when he breaks apart.
It was there to be picked at with eager eyes, and Jack was taking his time; he was looking at Dean as if he was watered down with an unthinkable weight, softened with guilt, and Dean knew he was the most powerful being in the world, capable of uprooting all of existence and hurdling it towards the sun, but at that moment he looked seconds away from falling to his knees.
Dean raised his head from Eileen’s shoulder, squinting at Sam through one eye. “I don’t get a shower?”
“I was just making sure you weren’t gonna give yourself a scar,” Dean teased, sliding his way through the crack in the door. His ears were itching with embarrassment, tempting him to reach up and touch, but the smile Cas gave him was sweet and familiar, warming Dean up the nice way instead.
Dean nearly laughed.
Dean stepped over to shield Cas from view, and the boy’s gaze immediately snapped back up to Dean’s face with dreadful realization. His face flushed red in a matter of seconds, making it even more satisfying when Dean leaned in closer, voice pulled low, and said, “Look at him again and I’ll knock you on your ass, capeesh?”
That’s how it would feel.
There was a fine line between lying to Cas and simply refraining from the truth. It had gotten easier to navigate between the two, realizing the kind of things that just couldn’t be said, or the questions that were better left unanswered. But this… this was different. Cas had done more for Jack than both Sam and Dean combined. He’d been a father to Jack, in every sense of the word, and yet Cas couldn’t even remember the kid's name.
He made the mistake of looking at Cas and trying for a smile. It was too much, even for Dean, and his heart all but stopped when he felt a tear slip down his cheek, managing to push past all his bravado, all his bullshit talk of hope and time, and Cas stared at him like he was breaking. Like he was watching Dean shatter apart and suddenly recognizing the man staring back at him; the tremor in Dean’s chin, the glassy green haze of his eyes— all of it.
you,” Cas laughed, drunk off the wonderment of it, the bliss of certainty, all of it rushing in too fast to monitor. “You’re the man with the green eyes. The one I keep seeing, the one I dream about, it’s you—” His smile flattened, gaze dripping, “and you won’t stop crying.”
“S—sorry, I didn’t even…” He trailed off, eyes stuck somewhere past Dean’s shoulder. He brushed a hand down his arm, the movement bristling with quiet nervousness.
“I’m coming right back,” Dean said, staring straight down at the bedding, a pulse in his throat. He wished it weren’t like this. All he wanted was for these things to feel normal. For Cas’s touch and Cas’s skin to stop feeling like happy accidents every time he got a taste. “I’ll be right back, I promise. I just gotta explain some things to Sam.”
It made Dean want to ask Cas to hold him again. To grab his hand, lace their fingers as one and hold Dean the same way he did when they were asleep and could blame anyone but themselves.
He knew it was the beginning, his surroundings unfamiliar, and yet he was aware that something was different. He was aware that this was Earth, and he was human, and that that, in itself, was a miracle.
Meteor shower. Strange lights. Craters in the ground.
“How is this your fault?”
The demon faltered for only a second, body contorting wildly before his eyes cemented black and he grabbed Castiel by the throat, jolting back with the force of his laughter.
Dean shook his head. He could feel Cas staring at him.
“You better be by the time I get there,” Dean warned, though the fondness in his voice might have been a bit too telling. Cas smiled through the phone. “Be careful.”
“I told you there’s not much pain,” Cas tried.
Everything. Dean thought it would mean everything. He made up his mind.
“His grace,” Patience said. She pressed her lips thin. “It’s gone.”
And the tide crashed around them.
Dean threw out a smile carelessly, nothing about it real or remotely what Sam wanted to see. It was demeaning more than anything, forced for Sam’s benefit, and there was nothing Sam hated more in the world than when his brother lied to his face.
Dean almost didn’t ask. He couldn’t imagine he’d like the answer.
He turned towards the hallway to his right, fighting just to conjure up a smile.
Dean stared for a long moment. His eyes had no chance to dry. Even in darkness, Cas still shined.
They finally stopped at the Impala parked by the sidewalk, Dean fumbling for his keys. Their eyes met over the hood, something unspoken passing between them, a comfort of sorts.
do this shit, Dean. But the second I ever ask you anything about the music, you give me that ‘driver picks the music, shotgun shuts his cake hole’ crap.”
“Is Cas in there, buddy?” Dean crouched down to tug at the dog’s ears, smiling gently. Miracle hardly even glanced Dean’s way. He inched closer to the door, budding his nose against the wood with a whimper that forced Dean to his feet again. Dean pressed his ear to the door, frowning. “Cas? Not to sound like a fucking adult or whatever, but falling asleep before dinner is gonna screw your body clock.”
Dean was struck by just how
“Not a chance. You see, at first I figured I’d wait him out. See if he was strong enough to take me on, but if you two are here— well,” The demon shrugged, face twisting up in this humiliating mix of jest and pity. He clicked his tongue, pressing the gun harder into Cas’s skin. “Castiel must be in a bunch. Cat got your wings, angel?”
Dean couldn’t keep track of them all.
It wasn’t that Sam didn’t fear failure. He simply just refused it. While Dean evaded and broke ranks just to avoid slipping up, a habit undoubtedly brought on by John, Sam soared beneath the dawn of his mistakes. He’d risen above the impossible, surged back from the claws of demon blood and the tailing of Lucifer, redeeming himself from the seemingly unredeemable, and unlike Dean, Sam wasn’t above asking others for help.
“I want you to be here too.” Dean said, their noses bumping, eyes bright just standing there under the fluorescents, and Dean decided that was it.
Dean didn’t react for a moment. His face stuck in this breath between nonchalance and anger, unsure of which one to let take over.
” Claire scolded, clearly able to tell what Dean had done, and that just didn’t settle right with Dean; damn her for knowing him so well.
Dean opened the fridge door too quickly, the bulk of it rearing back to slam against his hip bone. His hands were trembling.
Dean didn’t think he’d ever understand it.
Dean didn’t even have the time to splutter or trample his way through
Cas just shrugged and reached for another bite, fork moving fast enough to rattle the plate.
Sam wrapped his fingers around the edge of the plate, hands unsteady, and cleared his throat. He had just enough nerve to ask, “Why aren’t you giving it to him yourself?”
Sam didn’t even bother looking up from his place on the bench press. His lips were curled and his breath was steady, all of his attention zeroed in on the metal biting his palms and the weight bearing down around him. He pushed the bar up, shoulders steady, and made quick work moving up and down, hardly even breaking a sweat.
Dean clasped the amulet desperately, allowing the chill of the metal to press relief into the wallowing heat of his shaking hands. There were stories behind this amulet; the entire lifetimes of two boys fighting to live and to feel deserving of the air it took to
“What if something else cut it out? The Empty is swarming with dick angels, any one of them could have taken a shot at Cas,” Dean tried to insist, but he softened when he saw the look on Sam’s face.
“I don’t recall a code,” He said petulantly, and suddenly, without warning, Dean felt a slow grin curl up the sides of his face. He nudged Cas with his knee, affectionate.
“No thanks. Ice cream doesn’t exactly complement beer.”
“You’re asking me if Cas—
Dean blinked wildly, head rearing back. “I’m sorry, what?”
“I— I didn’t—” He gulped hard and looked back over at Cas unintentionally, eyes delving right for the mesh of battered skin on the left side of Castiel’s face.
“I get surprised by how you talk about her,” Castiel looks almost completely unaware when he smiles. He always has. Dean knew this, but it still rattled him to his very core to watch as Cas’s face bloomed with light, this otherworldly awe that only seemed to appear when he was talking to Dean. “You care very deeply for her, and I admire that.”
“Complicated how?”
“Fuck off,” Sam laughed, smiling hard enough to let his head fall, and when he blinked up through wild hair to push at Dean’s shoulder, the two of them drifting in the hallway like lost boys reluctant to race home, Dean knew that the twenty-year-old kid with a freckled nose and the forest green eyes of a mother passed no longer had to worry about his greatest fear coming true.
Dean sunk to the ground in a watered down haze, eyes glowing red and white, heart splitting open. He pressed a hand over his mouth, forcing himself quiet as he leaned back against the edge of his bed.
It was strange, to say the least.
this man was
“Like what?”
Sam rolled his eyes. “You have a concussion, Dean.”
“Of course they do. That’s the code.”
With a smile of his own, Dean continued. “I would’ve knocked his teeth in. Maybe spanked him and sent his ass home to his mom— dude, I have a
Somehow.
“As if you don’t give the same response when people are worried about you.”
Dean shook his head. He couldn’t afford to be thinking like that. Not while driving in the opposite direction of the place he suddenly wanted to be.
“I thought—”
Dean snorted. “Baby.”
Leaving Sam meant failing him, failing everything, and Dean couldn’t. In every sense of the word, Dean couldn’t.
“Dean,” Sam muttered, trying to be mindful, but Dean was staring through a field of sweltering heat, his heart vibrating in the shell of his ears.
He shook his head.
The warding should be enough to keep the angels away, at least for now. Dean could get Sam to scrounge up a more permanent solution to get Cas off the grid later, but for the moment this was all they could come up with. They just hoped it would be enough to get them back to the bunker without any trouble.
He didn’t go look in Cas’s room straight away. If he was really gone, Dean would figure it out a different way. Any way was more preferable than seeing Cas’s bed neatly made and untouched, dust gathering over his books and odd little trinkets he’d collected over the years.
“Uh—hey, Cas,” Dean managed, grinning a bit too wolfishly. “Ready to go?”
It’s almost endearing how fast Castiel's anger faded. Dean could see it leave his eyes, melt off his skin, easy in a way Dean didn’t think it could be. That was new. That was
” Jody greeted, cheerful. Then, growing softer, “
“Strength’s got nothing to do with it,” He muttered.
No one had ever said that to Dean before. No one had ever felt that way about Dean before, not even Sam. For Sam it was a given; Dean was all he knew, all he’d ever known, and he’d be stuck with him long after death. But this— Cas was different.
Dean had half an instinct to just turn around and leave the same way he came, when Cas suddenly dropped the hand that had been pressed against his cheek, the entirety of his face coming into view.
know. Dean had figured out two days ago where he wanted to be, and it wasn’t chasing some nightmare in the-middle-of-nowhere Texas.
Cas looked confused all while leading Dean inside and pointing out a singular washing machine in the far corner, but he didn’t choose to speak up about it until he saw Dean hurriedly opening up the machine to drag his clothes out.
“Sure you have,” Dean pushed his cards down and away over the kitchen table, voice suddenly serious, close to frustrated. “You just can’t remember.”
The shake in his voice was telling enough to have Cas shutting up completely, eyes big and worry-filled even as his lips clamped together. He had a hard time meeting Dean’s gaze, every brief start of eye contact ending in the same hasty turn of his head and clench of his jaw.
Sleep came for him soon after that. Dean fought against it restlessly, fading in and out, and when Eileen finally got up for her turn to shower, Dean was just conscious enough to reach a hand out and stop her.
“You are a lying son of a bitch,” Dean said, tossing the bloodied cloth aside.
“Time's up, little brother. Hate to make you pull up the drawbridge early, but Cas and I are back. You’ve got five minutes tops to get decent.”
“Mildly? Don’t put it mildly— share with the class, Cas, come on.”
“It’s fine, Cas. Really, I just… I don’t know,” Dean couldn’t quite look at Cas once he’d gotten his coffee and slid into the seat across from him. There was a pressure building behind his ribs, and he felt as if he was bursting when he finally said, “I’m worried about you.”
Dean stopped mid stride, phone propped up with his shoulder, hands filled with laptops and beer. He started walking again just a second later, setting his things down in the map room, but his face was set with a permanent frown now.
blood— it was still fucking
Cas had been staring so long and so earnestly at that one spot on the library table, it only seemed inevitable that he asked, “Who is Jack?”
He looked otherworldly, paying no mind to the chaos around him, and it was times like these that it was almost impossible for Dean to get his mind around the fact that this was his
“That was then,” Castiel slowly turned the shard around in his palm, the edge of it catching a sliver of crisp white sunlight that pooled in from behind them, casting the room with straining black shadows. “The Empty might be happy its loudest guest is gone, but rumor is, it didn’t give you permission to leave, did it Castiel?”
“And you have a bitchy face. Your point?”
“Cas is scared, Dean. He might trust us, but he doesn’t know us, and if nothing changes, if things don’t go the way we planned...” Dean could see the words forming before they were even out. “We might just have to start over with Cas.”
They were all spinning this lie together, telling Cas everything he wanted to hear, but the details were vague and the guilt was palpable, and Dean knew it was only a matter of time before Cas caught on. Before he realized that Eileen’s smiling was turning pained and Patience had decided on silence entirely, afraid of saying the wrong thing. Sam was trying to make conversation, pulling topics from seemingly random blimps of space, but to Dean it was obvious; none of them knew what to do.
“I want to remember, Dean. You have no idea how badly— because it’s important, I know it’s important— I can feel it. I keep seeing these moments, brief glimpses. One minute I feel like I’m standing alone on the side of a road in the middle of nowhere, and the next I’m sitting on a park bench. Or in an empty bar, or the backseat of the—
anywhere, Cas.”
“Dude,” Dean grabbed two menus from the corner of the table and chunked one at Cas. “You think they got pie? You need some pie.”
“I have been thinking…” Sam started haltingly. He paused, hesitant, and spoke quickly through a rattling laugh, “I’ve been thinking about asking her if she’d like to move in.” His eyes widened after a few seconds of Dean staring at him in silence, mouth open. “If that’s alright with you, obviously. I haven’t exactly run it by Cas either but—”
Dean didn’t quite know how to articulate twelve years of friendship into a single answer. Twelve years of sleepless nights waiting for his damn phone to ring, for his worry to be lifted when he’d finally hear Cas making his way down the bunker stairs or shuffling into the motel room smelling like damp grass and distant rain.
Dean didn’t deserve her worry. All he’d done since she came back was ignore her, doing his best to avoid looking too closely when Sam and her would hold hands beneath the table at dinner, Cas suddenly feeling too far away every time Dean saw the way Sam would look at her, almost like he was a kid again and this was his first love touching his shoulder as they ate.
Sam cleared his throat pointedly, half a beat away from kicking Dean in the shin when Dean finally reeled himself back in.
“We’ve been looking—” Dean started.
“What do you mean you can’t?” Dean demanded, the panic in his limbs forcing heat into his voice, a misplaced anger he couldn’t control. “Haven't you heard my prayers? I’ve been praying to you all night.”
Castiel shook his head, unfazed. His voice hardened with certainty, “It wasn’t lying.”
“You’re not thinkin’ straight, man,” Dean interrupted, refusing to believe what he was hearing. “You’re not— you don’t mean that. You don’t seriously think—”
“We will figure things out with Cas,” Sam said. “We won’t stop until we find a way to help him. You know that, Dean.”
Dean nodded, his eyes no longer dry. He wiped clumsily at the tears before they could fall, dragging a hand back through his hair to try and hide them, but his ears were red and Cas could hear him sniffling and
He stepped in closer, gesturing towards Cas’s hands. “Do you want me to…?”
Gentle and warm, doe eyed and sweet. Decidedly human enough for Dean, but just a little more badass. Perfect.
Cas didn’t seem surprised that Dean was there. He must have seen him come in.
“Let’s get you fixed up,” Dean said, hollow.
“Cas, I— I would’ve done something the second you got back from Purgatory if it wasn’t for Kevin and the friggin’ demon tablet. Benny and his—” Dean couldn’t say it. Not now, this wasn’t the time. Benny was gone, and Dean breathed through the pang in his chest. “That’s what I’d been hoping for. That we’d get out, we’d be alive and— and
“Yeah, and he’s old enough to know better,” Dean insisted, glancing back at Cas. He turned to the red-headed boy, smirking indignantly. “Ain’t that right Archie?”
Cas smiled to himself, leaning further back. Dean didn’t miss the way the movement made his hand graze Cas’s shoulder.
Dean hadn’t known Eileen planned to come with them, not until he saw her standing at the passenger side mirror pulling her hair into a ponytail, but he found himself accepting it rather easily. He patted her on the back as he passed, giving her a small smile that seemed to surprise her, and she returned it with double the effort.
“You’re hurt,” Castiel breathed, right into Dean’s skin, and Dean felt it course through him like a waveless current, soaring to the tips of his fingers and the depths of his heart.
When Dean turned around, it was Cas standing in the archway, his hands raised to his stomach, brows pinched weakly. He stared at them, features broken up and dismayed.
The chief made a face before he could help it, eyes mirthful. “The FBI cares about some Ancient Aliens bullcrap?”
“I’m fine, Sam,” He said, before turning over his shoulder bitterly to add, “don’t you need to answer that?”
Patience stood up from Cas’s bedside the moment Sam and Dean returned to the infirmary. Sam flocked to Eileen’s side instantly, needing her close, but Patience had a shakiness to her features that qued Dean in, setting alarms blaring through his skull before he could even think to bolt towards Cas.
“Really,” She smiled, and it was warm and genuine, pouring straight from her skin. Moonlight bent over her cheekbone, turning her lashes into delicate shadows. “You don’t have to apologize, because there’s nothing to apologize for. I like to think I’m pretty attuned to all thing’s Winchester at this point.”
He turned to blink at Dean once he’d clicked the metal latch into place, tugging loosely at the strap across his chest. He was clearly expecting a reply, and Dean startled when he realized, straightening up and deflating all at once, face suddenly burning.
“Sure is,” Dean grinned. “Claire Novak, the one and only.”
“He’s in Colorado dealing with some angel crap. I gotta go get him before he gets himself killed, so,” Dean lifted his duffel bag as explanation, shrugging. “You good staying here by yourself?”
In the moment, Dean was too flustered to care all that much about what Cas was doing, why he had almost made Dean crash into a damn traffic barrier for no apparent reason. But once a few minutes passed just like that, Cas standing outside, motionless, Dean in the Impala, dazed and confused, Dean’s desire to
That was the dream. That was the only ‘more’ Dean had ever been able to imagine, and by now he knew it well. He just wasn’t sure it was something he could have with his family ripped apart.
was nothing.
Dean collapsed into bed the moment he was inside, and the pain to his head was immediate, burning between his ears and crackling down his spine. He choked out a groan into the pillow and rolled over, an arm thrown across his eyes.
And it’s insane just how fucking weird it really is. Dean calling Cas on some new number from the other side of the bunker, too afraid to go out and leave a Cas that wasn’t even his.
He’d grown up right in the storm of it all, fighting for his life before he could even see through the peephole of the motels they stayed in. His childhood filled with hunger pains and nightmares and getting up before the sun just to ice bruises he didn’t want Sammy to see, and Dean had done all of it without a single prayer to the man upstairs, to anyone.
This had been a horrible idea.
It was all sensation then; Dean’s mind went glassy, his vision swimming in the dark, but Cas’s lips were trembling and Dean’s heart was racing, and Dean held onto the nervous press of fingertips at the bolt of his jaw, claiming them to memory just in time for it to all fall away.
The gas pump clicked, and Dean let out a terse sigh, pulling himself up from where he was leaning against the back end. Sam stayed quiet as Dean unlatched the pump behind the license plate and ripped his receipt from the machine.
Shockingly enough, of all the scenarios Dean had ever had of him and Cas holding hands, he’d somehow never imagined this one.
Dean pulled away to fumble through his pockets again, head bent low. He didn’t give himself time to think, just grabbed his wallet— his
“Was it?” Castiel asked, endearingly interested, blue eyes softened and mid-day sweet, worn down at the corners.
“I’ve always been pursuing you. Sweeping you off your damn feet— that’s what I’ve been doing.”
Dean pulled open a refrigerator door and plucked a six pack of beer from the shelf. His arm brushed up against Cas’s side on his way to maneuver the pack into the basket, and his head rose in a flustered rush, stance rigid.
But even that had been too much, not enough, Cas slipping out from under Dean with his shoulder flared alive and his heart gone entirely, blown apart without a purpose.
All he could do was stare at Cas in complete shock, eyes searching frantically for a sign, some indication that Cas wasn’t serious, but there was nothing. Cas stared back, blinking through tears, and there was
Dean thought.
“I couldn’t help but check in,” Jack said, frowning like he couldn’t compute the look on Sam’s face, nothing in the world making sense. “I wanted to make sure you were all alright. That you… were capable of moving on.”
It’s all he managed to get out, and even that came out garbled to hell, the emotion in it strong enough to make Dean stagger back just at the sound of it, eyes blinking rapidly.
“Damn it, turn that off!”
Dean was almost surprised at the lack of sympathy he felt watching the boy blush and melt his way into the floor as he rang them up. He ripped the receipt from the machine shyly and made quite the show of handing it over to Cas instead of Dean, head bent low.
“No, I’m good,” He said, and Dean nodded, turning to leave. Sam continued just a second later, a grin in his voice, “Maybe you should let Cas tag along?”
“He cut out what he needed to survive,” Patience added mournfully.
“Thank you,” She said, giving a firm nod, and Dean squeezed her arm once more before letting her go.
"What the hell, Cas?” He said, throwing the Impala into park more aggressively than he needed to.
“You missed the upholstery at least,” Sam muttered. He hauled Dean up from the ground by the shoulders, lips curling into a hidden smile as Dean cursed and swayed on his feet.
Yes, he’d heard his prayers. Of course he had. “Metatron— he—” There was a weariness in his tone that set Dean in unease, stomach tensing. “He took my grace.”
But it was still blinding. It was still fucking mind-splitting, a feeling that rendered him useless, toeing the line between heated rage and desperate grief. It ricocheted through him, and it made him just mad enough to crawl into bed right beside Cas.
He was annoyed at first, swearing under his breath as he fumbled for it blindly and stepped out of the Impala into a sheet of humid rain, but once he realized it was Cas he froze up, something similar to relief making his heart beat faster.
Dean couldn’t say he was surprised by the presence that followed, but he still whipped around to glare at Sam when he heard footsteps enter the hallway. Sam didn’t let it faze him; he simply gave Dean that soft mannered look, eyes big and comforting, and asked, “You alright?”
Dean was too busy looking at Cas that he almost missed what he said entirely. Almost. But then it came to him, seized and shook him like a storm, and Dean knew.
The amulet still felt the same as it always had in the cusp of Dean’s palm. It burned cold when Dean snatched it from the bottom of the drawer, and the tarnished metal still grated against the grooves of his thumb when he brushed over the surface.
“That’s not it,” Dean said. “You’ve always been the one I’ve talked to about the shit that makes me uncomfortable.”
” Cas said, and for a brilliant moment, it was as if nothing had changed.
“Look at you, rockin’ the peach fuzz again.” Dean said playfully, dropping his hand to squeeze at Cas’s shoulder.
Blue eyes peered up at him, shy and doubtful beneath a flutter of lashes and a stretch of warm skin that had filled out with tension over the years. Dean had always wanted to ask him why his vessel seemed to age, his face ridden with frowning lines and eye crinkles similar to Dean’s own, almost as if they had been mirrored that way.
A force stopped him before he could get there. A steady hand fell across his chest, holding Dean back. “Wait, just— wait a second, Dean.”
“I didn’t understand it back at the hospital. God, I barely understood it yesterday— but I recognize you. I
“I feel…” Cas swallowed, sitting up with great effort. Dean moved to help him, a hand cupping his shoulder, and Cas turned to look at him sharply, his eyes pulled wide with alarm.
Dean had fucked up somewhere. Cas had no idea just how precious he was, how irreplaceable, how
“If you’re worried about whether you’re actually some crazy dickbag, don’t be. You’re not,” Dean rolled Cas’s jeans back down for him once he was done, smoothing out the fabric with a too-firm palm. “I ain’t gonna pretend like you haven’t made some mistakes, but you’re one of the good guys, Cas. Always have been.”
“What?” Cas paused, eyes widening ever so slightly. “Do what?”
Dean was all too used to the way Sam sighed and slumped against the door in defeat, sucking away at his dark colored smoothie.
“You already are,” Cas said.
Castiel's eyes softened with understanding, frown deepening. “I’ve never been a regular angel, Dean. But especially not since I met you.”
“How are you feeling?” He asked, unmistakably fond.
All you’re doing is killing yourself.”
“I was going to clean them, but I only had so much money and I was thirsty,” He said quietly, staring through the laundromat window to frown at the vending machine inside. “Dehydration. Such a strange human sensation. Very unpleasant.”
The two collided in the darkness, a spray of glass and blood that blew into the night and sent Castiel sliding across pavement, crying out in pain.
Dean glared down at him, his heart leaping ever so slightly when Castiel raised his eyes. He was laying down on one of the infirmary beds in a ratty flannel and faded blue jeans, his hands folded neatly over his stomach, and the smile he gave Dean was something playful and all-knowing, nothing like Dean imagined it to be in this situation.
“Do you remember where the garage is?” Dean asked, clearly bothered. “Sam should have shown you when he gave you the tour of the place.”
“It’s Cas, right?” Sam said without warning, leaving him to witness Dean’s expression soften unbearably, gaze wavering. His throat bobbed around a heavy swallow, lips parting to speak— but Sam beat him to it. “You think that somehow, this has something to do with Cas.”
Dean took Cas by the hand before they could reach his room, pulling him along, grabbing him close. They moved further away from Sam’s room and stumbled into one of the bathroom’s, the light above the mirror flickering on just as Dean kicked the door closed.
And somehow, they had found their way back. Like some sadistic loop, a torturous curse. Cas was dying because of him,
A reminder. The last goodbye.
It was too bizarre to look at head-on. So close to what he’d always wanted that Dean often woke up in a panic, reality splitting apart the second he’d roll over to find Cas snoring beside him. He’d think
“I wasn’t finished,” He muttered.
He was just so tired of giving.
“No? Cause it sure sounds like you’re whining,” Dean pointed out, and that seemed to do the trick; Cas clamped his mouth shut, a heavy sigh spilling past his nose.
“It’s mostly numb now. Not much pain,” Castiel picked at the hospital blanket with his fingernails as he spoke, vacant with his words, not all there. Dean couldn’t tell whether it was the drugs or something else, something more. The thought terrified him. “But the doctor said he’s not sure whether I’ll get feeling back in that part of my face.”
It had been too long since he’d seen her. Too fucking long.
“Yeah, you’re probably right,” Dean let out a slow breath, his relief barely making it half mast before Sam added, “guess that makes two of you.”
“She’s a psychic,” Dean started to explain, slowly untangling himself from the table. He ignored the pop in his knees, straining as he moved. “She lives with Jody and Claire, and she's driving a long way to come take a look at you, so behave.”
But the urge was unusually strong this time, pounding away in his ears. Dean’s eyes softened when they landed on Castiel’s lips, watching his breath fan out over pink skin, studying the flash of tongue and teeth when he wetted them.
“Does Sam need peanut butter?”
He was a goddamn
“And she’s a good plan, the only one we’ve got,” Dean continued, ignoring him.
Somewhere behind him, Dean heard a gasp.
If there was any sure sign that Cas was fully human now, it was that he slept and ate like nobody’s business.
“We’ve agreed to much worse with a lot less,” He said wistfully. “We’re lucky to even have him back at all. If he wasn’t here, Dean would still be—”
“Alright, okay, we can do that just—” Sam sighed deeply, exhausted. Dean didn’t say anything. “Let us get back and pack, and while we’re there Eileen and I can take showers before we head out.”
Dean smiled darkly. “He always does.”
Dean felt a pang of guilt, brief, smothered by the smile he forced. “I’ve been a little busy, kid.”
Cas made a face. “Dean, you’re being ridiculous.”
“Listen, Dean. I know how this looks, okay? I do. But, Cas, he—” Sam turned his head to look back through the room’s window, expression falling.
“My pride certainly is,” Cas mumbled, and fuck— Dean would be laughing if he could.
He’d discover that he’d somehow imagined the whole thing; created the burn in his fingertips as he’d stitched Cas up, was plagued by nothing but his own mind as he watched Cas sit up in a hospital bed and stare right through him.
“There’s more. There’s so much more, but— everything else is distorted. Blackened around the edges like my mind doesn’t want itself to see,” Castiel said.
Flustered, with a voice wrung tight with chipped composure, Sam groaned out, “Dean, come on—”
but Castiel having no memory of not just Dean, but everything they’ve ever fought for had never even crossed his mind.
“You should eat something,” Sam called out weakly. “You know, before you go back to your room.”
He looked further through the treeline, stared harder, and yes, yes that— that was the warehouse he’d seen before, that was the soft glow of wide-open doors and chipped metal beams, and standing there, right before Dean’s vision went blurry and grey edged, was Sam and Eileen.
There was something in his voice that had Dean raising his head almost shyly, looking at Cas from over the roof of the Impala.
” Castiel gave him a pleading look. “I don’t know what’s real or made up, none of it makes any—”
He had more to say.
Their table ended up a mesh of breakfast and lunch, Dean going with a cheeseburger while Cas had a strong inkling for bacon and hashbrowns. The smell alone made Castiel practically double over in his seat, eyes turning glassy and bright.
you up for it?”
“Okay,” Dean said, struggling. “It’s okay! Look, we gotta get out of here before someone sees this body. You mind showing me where your clothes are?”
“Language,” Jody said weakly. She turned to Sam just in time to miss the way Claire’s eyes rolled. “Hi boys,” She smiled, and Sam embraced her so eagerly that she was lifted off her feet for a second or two, a startled noise spilling out of her.
“Wow,” Dean laughed. “Care to share with the rest of the class, asshole?”
“Then what are you, Jack?” Dean took a daring step forward. “Because the last time I checked, you sure left us like God.”
“I’ve never been capable of that,” Dean shook his head, adamant. “If you weren’t such a blank slate you’d know that I can’t do this without you.”
” Sam sighed, but there was an odd hitch of embarrassment in his voice that had Dean grinning into the phone’s receiver. “
Not even this Cas could deny Dean anything. His resolve sprang away, honesty winning over, and Cas looked at Dean as if that was his only way of steering clear, his mind flickering back and forth between dusted polaroids of time.
Castiel pulled the tape back towards himself, brows furrowed. He read the label again, and then once more, lips moving with it, head spinning right along side it, and Dean— much like the first time he’d given Cas his gift, felt ripped apart from his heart entirely, the very thing beating in Cas’s hands as he pulled the cassette free and raised it against the low lamp light.
Dean pulled away instinctively. “What? No I’m— fuck, m’ fine. S’not even that bad.”
Dean closed his eyes and dropped his hand, wading through the room in darkness. The last thing he needed was to shine any light on the heat rising to his face.
“Of course not,” His gaze on Dean was practically soft enough to feel, featherlight and delicate even as it burned down Dean’s skin, traveling up his figure. “You know how much I enjoy your company. Our time together.”
it made Dean dread the times when his mask slipped and he’d be left staring at Cas, both of them knowing full well that Dean was more troubled than he ever allowed himself to admit.
“Thank you.”
“He’s at the hospital as far as I know, being treated for some killer frostbite. There’s no telling how long he was out there, lying face first in the snow,” Lundy explained, giving both of them odd looks. He especially seemed to be studying Dean’s reactions, a crease in his forehead. “He was in too bad a shape for me and my boys to take him in immediately, so we’re having to wait til’ he gets discharged.”
“No cause’ I know you don’t,” Dean murmured, eyes glued to the table now. He had this far away look on his face, the skin around his eyes twisted and red. “Nobody wants him here more than I do.”
“You know, I didn’t call to get my ass spanked by a Bratz doll. Hand the phone over to Jody,” He said briskly, silently enjoying the sudden scramble over the line as Jody pried her phone back from Claire.
Dean shrugged. “You don’t see me complaining,” His voice faded as he tipped his drink back, draining it with a dramatic gasp. Dean came back smiling from it, the heat outside making his skin shine red, and he slid the empty glass to the far side of the table.
“Metatron tricked me,” Cas said, regret already making his voice shake. “I’m sorry, Dean. It wasn’t angel trials, it was a spell. I wanted you to know that—”
He couldn’t because Chuck was gone and the world was saved and Dean still couldn’t find a damn reason to be happy.
is why I didn’t want to tell Sam that something was wrong. He’d do anything to help you, including risking his own life to fix me and that’s— I can’t—” Cas’s face contorted miserably, and everything inside of him seemed to be crumbling as he said, “Nothing is worth losing either one of you.”
The conversation was short.
A small part of Dean hoped Cas wouldn’t notice the touching, how self-indulgent it all was. But a larger part of him wanted Cas to call him out on it, to spring up a conversation that could possibly shift whatever puzzle piece out of place in Cas’s head back where it belonged.
They had never talked about it. Not once, not even a little. But Dean… well, Dean had just assumed-
“I know, I know,” Cas breathed, shaking his head. He gave Dean a look, eyes abnormally big. “Still hurts though.”
” Cas asked, helplessly interested, and Dean couldn’t get over just how shy he sounded, as if calling Dean had taken the kind of courage to make him breathless.
“I’m aware,” Castiel smiled, and it was amusement that poured from him then, subtle but heart-kiltering, Dean’s body erupting in flames. Cas didn’t even seem to care about the pain in that moment; he was smiling wide and uninhibited.
“Would it be better if I was different?” Cas demanded, rightfully defensive, eyes burning blue.
We're officially halfway through this story! Thank you all so much for sticking with me, and taking the angst like fucking champs. These two will get their happy ending soon, but for now- this chapter has a lot going on, so please enjoy!
“Drink,” Dean pressed the whiskey bottle back into Cas’s hand, ignoring the other man’s frown as he crouched down at the side of the bed. “You’re gonna need it. Your feet are fucked.”
From somewhere behind him, Dean could hear the shuffle of Cas’s slides against the building's grimy tiles, struggling to keep up with Dean’s pace. There was something inexplicably shy about the noise, the desperateness of it making Dean eventually soften and slow down, waiting for Cas to catch up.
Because that was all Dean ever worried about anymore. Jody and Donna and the girls, the Charlie that felt far away and the Bobby that was so similar to the man he’d watched die in a hospital bed that it fucking hurt— he cared about all of them, and he needed them safe. But the secret was out, Claire knew, and Dean once again found himself scrambling for a way to help.
When Dean fell asleep, his stomach grumbling and his skin still heavy with the scent of smoke and dust, it was with Castiel curled up tight in his arms.
Castiel plucked the towel between two fingers and snatched it quickly, wringing his hands. He gave Dean a small smile, this fleeting little thing that was the kind of pretty that made Dean blink stupidly in response, unable to give anything but a nod in return before Cas was turning and walking out of the room.
His body shook and rippled beneath skin, vibrating with pain, breath coming fast and labored before stopping just as quickly. Cas straightened and stilled, hand slipping off the door. He turned back to look at Dean with blatant shock.
“Are you gonna take Cas?” Sam asked pointedly.
Dean raised his eyebrows. “Sorry— they?”
Dean could imagine that in any other state of mind, he would’ve melted at the way Cas seemed to lean into his touch, following him blindly in the dark. But now it just made him want to hold on tighter, touch him deeper so that Cas didn’t feel the need to reach out for something Dean had been trying to give him for years.
“Please.”
“These are good.” Castiel said after a while of silence, the two of them eating quietly with their eyes ahead.
This was Cas without the burdens, without the torment, and Dean loved him— still, always. But if stripping Cas of his pain meant changing him entirely, then Dean didn’t want it. He didn’t want some squeaky clean version of Cas that walked and talked and smiled at Dean the same way, this gummy toothed pull of his lips that always sent Dean’s heart batting around his ribcage.
He’d come to Dean to find his coat tucked into the trunk of some nameless car, forgiveness woven into the warmth of Dean’s eyes as he handed it over and said, “part of me always believed that you’d come back.”
Immediately, the words
“They’ve never stopped being a problem,” Cas scowled defeatedly, staring down at the floor, and Dean made a decision.
“Which hospital was it?”
But with Cas it had almost become a comfort. Just as easy as breathing, as instinctual as popping in with a shitty joke that Cas would belittle him for the next time he saw him, as simple as closing his eyes and asking,
There was a screech in the distance, the sound of a horn and a scrape of rubber, but Castiel refused to move his eyes away even when his instincts screamed, heart rising to a deafening drum in his chest.
And the thing about fear was that Dean had a history with it. He knew where it started— deep in his chest, hot in his throat, and he knew where it ended— people leaving, people hurting, people dying. It ended with bodies in graves and bathtubs and hospital beds. It ended bloody and bad, and Dean knew this better than anyone.
“No, everything’s not okay,” Dean hadn’t come up with a plan for this yet. He knew telling Sam was all he could do now, all he could hope for, but the fear that came with it didn’t register until it was already out of his mouth. “Cas is dying, Sam.”
Dean stared at him, swallowing.
“Who’s it for?” Castiel asked.
Castiel tilted his head towards the carved lettering, thoughtful, and Dean felt it like a punch to the gut. He hoped Cas had enough sense not to mention the other name on that table he didn't recognize, but ultimately it didn’t really matter either way.
The ghost of Lundy’s fingers were already embedded into the whitened skin of Cas’s throat, and the freedom of air was brief, rupturing into something much darker when the demon took Cas by the chin and turned his head to face him.
Eileen had been staying with them in the bunker on and off again ever since the world had been put back together, and her and Sam’s relationship had only improved because of it. Before, where Sam had been shy and jittery with every smile Eileen threw his way, now he was certain and effortless with which he moved around her, clinging to her on all sides.
It was almost alarming just how quickly Castiel let his arms drop, his eyes widening in their search for Dean’s own, trying to catch his gaze, but Dean couldn’t look at him. Dean couldn’t acknowledge anything beyond the sweat on his skin and the heat in his gut, countless years of wishing and wondering all coming to a grating halt as his thumb brushed over the top button.
Lundy fell to the ground in a lifeless heap, glass crunching beneath him.
There was an unusual chill in the bunker that morning when Dean got up, and he padded towards the bathroom with socked feet and jittery hands. He scratched at his jaw as he walked, grunting at the back of his throat when his shitty night’s rest almost made him collide with the wall.
"If you don't want to… you shouldn't feel obligated to, Dean." Cas tried to remain distant, unaffected, but his voice came out broken and weak, his biggest fear unfolding right in front of him. Dean stiffened with confusion, heart leaping when he caught Cas's eyes and saw barely concealed tears. "I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. I just thought..."
Dean tipped her graciously. It was a ridiculous amount that most times would have left Dean anxious out of habit, a lifetime of dwindling money and scrounging for food making even the smallest act of charity feel like suicide, but it was worth it if only for the tearful smile she gave in return.
“Sure seems like it,” Dean said.
Dean’s smile was pained.
It was fine. They had time for these things now. No need to push himself.
It was hard, being vulnerable with Cas. But it was easy too. Easy in the sense that in the past Dean hadn’t had a choice. Cas had seen his soul since the beginning, understood the brokenness held inside, and he’d stayed. He was one of the few who had seen Dean for who he was, and
Cas still knew to look at Dean for help, for safety.
it appeared. “Dean, I— I shouldn’t have called you. This isn’t your war and I dragged you in it. I got you involved in matters that don’t involve you
“Can you hear me?”
He had done it all by himself. No begging or praying for it to all go away, because praying meant there was hope. Praying meant Dean believed there was someone out there who gave a damn about how much he hurt, and he couldn’t bear to be let down by another father.
Dean nearly doubled back from the force of his shock. “You mean you’re not done probing the guy?”
” He said, clearly not understanding, and Dean fell silent, an ache spreading through his limbs.
Castiel looked down at his pants, pinching them between two fingers. “I think they’re cute, and I’m sure the old me shared the same sentiment.”
“I know,” Jack said, and the silence turned deafening.
“Don’t mention it, Cas.”
“Listen,” Dean started, straddling that ever changing line between angry and worried. “I’m sorry your life isn’t what you pictured it’d be when you were in that hospital. I’m sorry you don’t have a girl to come home to, or a kid to keep in line, or whatever other Hallmark crap you hoped for. You drew the short end of the fucking stick ending up with me and Sam.
Dean pressed the phone closer to his ear and trudged his way through the rain. The chime of the diner’s bell as he pushed his way through the front door was sharp and ear splitting, the damn thing rusted to high hell. Dean was almost certain he’d witness it snap and fall to the floor by the time he made it out of there.
“Your sentiments towards your car are rather funny.”
“You are
but Dean Winchester, for the life of him, still couldn’t tell the difference between being left and being abandoned.
Dean froze, hands falling uselessly to his sides. There was a heartbeat in his throat suddenly, a broiling singe in his cheeks. Cas stared at Dean curiously, almost like they weren’t nose to nose, breathing each other’s air. His gaze flickered between Dean’s features aimlessly, blue meeting green in a heated look that seemed to stretch for eternity.
They weren’t in the clear by any means, Dean knew that. The angel tablet was still in the wind, Metatron was nuking Heaven as they spoke and Sam wasn’t fully healed up yet, but god— they were alive.
“It’s one in the afternoon, Dean,” Sam said, looking at Dean clearly for the first time. His eyes lingered on the patchy bruise at Dean’s temple, before moving back to the door. “Is everything okay? Cas seems—”
Dean hurriedly reached over and unlocked all the doors, heart hammering.
have cable. The problem is your taste in movies is crap.”
Dean turned his blinker on and looked over his shoulder as he switched lanes, throat tightening in a single breath. The hole in his chest grew bigger, louder, everything inside of him screaming out all at once.
Unlike Dean, Sam didn’t let something like failure chip away at him until he was stilted dust. It wasn’t part of his wiring, his brain worked much differently, and Sam already had a plan whirring behind the panes of his eyes before the smoke from the failed spell could even reach the rafters.
Soon enough, dizziness cloaked Dean’s vision, and arguing became more of a hassle than anything. He was asleep within the second hour, and by the sixth he was standing beside a gas pump in Oklahoma while the sun did its best to boil him from a distance, the burn of it at the back of his neck jarring his head with whiteness.
Dean suppressed a smile.
Sam bristled in his seat. “Dude, this isn’t Fight Club. The three of us can talk about it, I just think with Cas we really shouldn’t—”
“Out getting food to take back to the motel. We didn’t bring much to eat, none of us figured we’d be here long.”
Doubt was beginning to weigh on him now, the powerless impairment of it sinking into his bones, wringing him dry. Dean didn’t know what to expect. He could walk through that door and find Cas limbless and shaking, blinded and touch-dead, his face torn open and his mouth sealed shut. Cas could be
“I—” He didn’t know what to say. It felt like he’d been apologizing to everyone lately, cleaning up his own messes as much as he could, but he still didn’t understand how to do this. He tried again, “Eileen,” and his eyes bled water, “these last few months—”
“No, I mean it,” Sam gritted, all but stomping on Dean’s amusement. “I’m an asshole. I mean what kind of brother am I to let you keep—
Cas tried for a shrug. It didn’t quite convince Dean. “I’ve put it off long enough,” Was all he said, and after applying another ridiculous layer of shaving cream, Cas made careful work with the leftover stubble on his jawline.
“How bout’ that,” Dean said, balancing something like awe between his eyes as he looked up and smiled at Cas with everything he had. “That sounds pretty useful to me.”
“M’ not sad, Cas,” He said, softly.
Eileen grabbed the tissue box from the counter. Dean’s eyes glazed over as he watched her do everything she could to clean the mud and grass from his shoes, her fingers nimble, shoulders squared.
“Look, I’ve been practicing how to enter the subconscious for a while now, but I can’t make any promises that this’ll work,” Patience said. She turned to Cas again, expression unreadable. “Especially with him being an—”
“We can’t let you shower alone with a concussion, and I’d doubt you’d want me in there supervising,” Sam raised his eyebrows at the both of them.
“It’s been days, Cas,” Dean sighed, the usual bags under Castiel's eyes impressively dark, the age in them endless. When Cas didn’t respond, Dean softened, feet moving all on their own until he was sitting next to Cas and asking, “Scared you’ll have nightmares?”
“Cas is a big boy, Sam. He was able to get it up when he needed to, alright? Are we done?” Dean didn’t let Sam respond before he was clicking his tongue and rounding on his heel, “Awesome. I need a beer.”
He kissed Cas’s cheek because he wanted to. Watched the way it made the angel smile all handsome and gummy because
Dean rolled the windows down the moment he was back behind Baby’s wheel, and they sped out of the parking lot fast enough to kick up loose gravel, the smell of tart smoke and frosted air making Dean’s eyes sting.
“I thought we agreed you weren’t gonna do this.”
” Cas squirmed painfully beneath the needle at his hip, groaning in frustration. “I don’t understand. I’ve fought against Lucifer himself, why does a battery powered needle elicit such a response—
Dean’s breathing turned harsh, eyes fogging over with panic. He could feel himself slipping, quicker than usual, hope making everything crumble twice as fast, and it’s an embrace that pulled him back. A brush of stubbly lips against his cheek that made Dean’s eyes rush up out of amazement rather than fear.
And slowly, Dean remembered. He remembered Sam’s phone call and Cas’s presence spinning circles around him, scorching his nose and searing his eyes and shredding his heart. Dean remembered the taste of love at the back of his tongue and the bitterness that had followed when Cas collapsed without warning, striking a fear in Dean that had for once in his life seemed to finally quiet down, for however brief.
Dean reached for the medicine first, screwing off the lids of three plastic bottles.
Sam shrank back, a sweet sort of skittishness flashing across his face. He gave Dean one of those smiles of his, something about the shape of it worn soft and smoothed over, budding with quiet acceptance.
“Dean,” He said, choked, and Dean just held him tighter, coaxing the pain away, wishing to meld broken skin.
There was snow trapped between his toes, slicing through his skin, but it was the sudden appearance of lights from a distance that drew Castiel’s attention. He stopped in the middle of the road and turned, facing straight ahead at what looked like sunlight, felt like fear.
Jack’s smile was awed, and his cheeks rose like golden hills, framing the sides of his face. “You don’t?”
The tattoo artist scoffed and brushed past them with a hitch in her step, shoulders tightened with anger, and Dean was laughing so hard on his way out that he almost forgot to pay.
Jack had already taken care of Dean’s concussion just before vanishing, relieving the throbbing ache at the base of Dean’s skull with a sweep of his hand, but Cas couldn’t know that. Which meant Dean was going to have to lie and
He didn’t want to go.
flickering between them like static.
There was a lightness in her step as she brushed past Sam and moved into the bathroom, her ponytail swishing back and forth. Sam turned to watch her leave, eyebrows raised.
“Eileen?” He rasped, and there was a pain in his chest that just kept building, an emotion that churned and boiled at his very center.
“There’s nothing wrong with being afraid of having something,” Cas said gently. “It’s usually not the having that people fear, but the losing. For some it’s not worth it to even try.”
Jack’s body was shaking, arms wound tight, but he stayed smiling. Even through the covered sniffling and the hastily wiped tears, Jack stayed smiling, all crooked teeth and kind eyes, the glow in him remaining until the very last second where Sam watched him fade away with a gust of wind.
“I’m fine, but, Cas—” Jack shuttered against a sudden wave, eyes closing. Light poured from the breath of his fingertips, surging outwards across the plain of Cas’s chest. “I won’t be able to hold this connection for long. He’s weak.”
He seemed uncomfortable. Freaked out even, and Dean took a hesitant step back, terrified he’d done something wrong.
“I thought you’d say red,” Castiel frowned thoughtfully. When Dean gave him a questioning look, Cas gestured towards his flannel, which on that day just so happened to be a checkered mix of red and black.
Not to mention Cas had been acting differently lately. More distant, less willing to talk and put up with Dean’s antics like he was now. Dean tried not to appear too excited to be seeing him like this again, but there was a drum in his chest pounding away and the smile on his face was nearing painful.
“You know ASL?” Dean asked, staring at Cas with what felt like a glimmer of hope. “You— you can remember something like that?”
“And my clothes were on. Your observation skills are unmatched, Sam.”
tactical, everything Dean had lost a grip on sometime between driving to Colorado and grabbing Cas’s hand, and Dean had all the intentions in the world to agree.
“Don’t go in there again,” He couldn’t quite comprehend why Cas was standing so close, Dean’s panicked breath fanning out over dark lashes, grazing pale skin, but he knew he wanted to touch him. His hands shook with it. “I duh— don’t ever wanna see you in there, you don’t need to be in there. I’ll get the blood, just—”
Dean laughed before he could help it, relaxing just enough to be able to guide himself down and sit on the bed without cracking apart.
Cas let out a gurgling burp out of nowhere, eyes bugging out in shock. They both stared at each other with matched disbelief, frozen still until Dean erupted with laughter, the force of it crippling. Cas visibly relaxed at the sight, eyes softening as he watched silently from afar.
Once again, Dean wondered,
to look at owning anything under a legal name. Dean could admit that he was ready— past ready to start a life that wasn’t brimming with hellfire. But none of it would matter.
It was similar to watching the sun die, seeing the way in which Cas softened inexplicably in the silence that followed. There seemed to be no reason for it, nothing Dean could try and tread through, and he watched as Cas’s face peaked with frustration, his hands wringing through the ratted hand towel before dropping it completely.
If things were fine and he was allowed and this was really Cas staring back at him, joking in that clueless way of his that in Dean’s perfect world would be followed with Dean kissing him stupid, Cas kissing
And he said it so matter of factly, so swift and thoughtless that Dean was left wading through water without a raft, heat sparking behind his eyes. It made sense, he supposed. This Cas couldn’t remember anything before Dean, couldn’t recall the years before him and his brother pulled him into the whole shitty mess of their lives and claimed he belonged there.
“What?” Dean prodded, a fire building in his lungs. “You don’t understand what, Cas?”
The man at the front desk gave the two of them odd looks as they signed in, and if Dean hadn’t thought they both looked like microwaved crap then he probably would have said something about it. Instead he just checked them in under some fake name, slapped down a handful of cash, and winked at the man as he left with a hand on Cas’s shoulder, leading him away.
Castiel looked between the boxes of shelves and Dean, eyes filled with worry. “Why? I just need—”
“A life of your own.”
“What are you boys chasing?” He asked slowly, finger tracing over his holster in a way that had Dean eyeing him silently.
“Nah, I’ve seen enough red for a lifetime,” He sat up and stretched off the roller, craning his neck a little to grin incoherently in Cas’s direction when he added, “blue though— now that’s a different story.”
wasn’t a sin after all.
He even finished his pie before Dean did, eating up every little crumb and piece of filling until his stomach ached and he leaned back in his seat with a groan.
“Get out of there, Cas,” He said, voice breaking with it, fingers creaking against the hold he had on the doorframe, and Dean couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt this afraid except that it had probably been in this room, in this moment that felt just like the last.
Dean glanced in the rearview mirror, hesitant as he whispered, “Cas?”
Dean smiled softly, clearing his throat.
And the confusion didn’t startle Sam this time. It wasn’t fueled from ignorance or disbelief, but rather from loving bewilderment, an incredulous
” He grumbled, undeterred by Dean’s attempt at a joke.
Dean blinked in surprise. He pulled his phone back to stare at the caller once, twice. “Claire?”
“Damaged? Why the hell is it damaged?”
“No,” Cas murmured. He looked back at the bed he was sitting on. “I’m… anxious to try, to tell you the truth.”
“As far as we know, he’s the only one who has any idea where Cas is. Best we keep it that way.”
“And why not?” Castiel asked.
was suddenly upfront and all bearing.
He stopped and he thought about Claire back at the bunker waiting for him, and Kaia in Sioux Falls waiting for her.
“Patience struck out,” Dean told him, flashing an easy smile. “We didn’t figure out much but, how are you feelin’? You took one hell of a nap.”
Chapter Warnings: canon-typical alcoholism gets addressed, minor mentions of sexuality repression, and more acknowledgement of a generally shitty John Winchester because this wouldn't be a spn fic without that shit.
“You don’t wanna know,” Dean waved him off, pulling a face.
Showing Cas to his own room in the bunker held a weight to it that Dean hadn’t been expecting, an odd sense of normalcy that made it hard to breathe as him and Cas walked shoulder to shoulder through the hallway.
“Figures,” Dean grumbled, looking away. It was silent for a moment, Dean blinking languidly through the window, his thoughts going from liquid and slow to hot and painful. He said, “I wanna go home.”
did you let Sam talk you into watching that?”
Dean lifted his eyes, and Sam’s expression instantly shattered. He set his gun down on the map table and hurried to Dean’s side, his eyes pulled wide with worry.
Dean's knees twitched, his feet shifting slightly forward, and then suddenly Cas was gone, a gentle flutter of wings the only indication that he was ever there. And Dean, the poor bastard, was almost relieved. He’d been close to doing what he couldn’t, what he’d never been able to do, and maybe this was a sign.
“I know,” Sam smiled. “But I want you to promise me,” Dean somehow found a way to meet Sam’s earnest gaze, ignoring the number it did to his working lungs. “That when this is all over, good or bad, you’ll make a choice for yourself. Promise me.”
we could—”
“No jokes before noon then,” Dean mumbled. “Got it.”
Dean raised his head to look at Sam, ready to turn the blame on him before he could really let the sudden guilt in his stomach simmer, but his eyes met Eileen’s instead, and his body caved. She didn’t have to hear Dean’s outburst to know exactly what had happened. The weight in Dean’s shoulders was telling enough.
So, Dean hadn’t been the best influence when it came to table manners. Sue him.
“So, you got Cas a babysitter,” Sam deadpanned once Dean was fumbling with the music again, acting as if nothing happened.
“Really,” Dean said, not believing any of it.
Dean ignored him. He pulled his phone out of his pocket and looked at the Chief expectantly, gaze sharp.
Dean swallowed, said, “I’m not kidding, Cas.”
Above them, the bunker lights flickered, the air spilling with static, and all it took was Dean blinking against a breach of wind for Jack to appear beside them.
“We found this guy half-dead, naked as the day he was born passed out on the side of the road yesterday morning,” Lundy said, shrugging. “We figure he was probably the one making the light somehow. Fireworks maybe, but when we tried asking him he said he couldn’t remember. The boy seems to have more than a few screws loose.”
“It’s not like you’d remember even if you had, Einstein,” Dean mumbled. Cas squinted at him, clearly wanting to ask who the fuck Einstein was, but Dean just waved him off with a roll of his eyes and helped him to his feet, the two of them staggering towards the exit of the garage in a discombobulated shuffle.
And then he was gone, disappearing around the corner again with his shoulders tense and the stale smell of beer stuck to his back.
And now…
He had given enough. All three of them had, and all Dean wanted in return was this; Cas by his side, safe and content just down the hall from him where all Dean had to do was call his name, and he’d be there. Trench coat or not, human or angel— Dean didn’t care so long as it was Cas telling him good morning, Cas smiling at him over coffee, Cas looking at Dean like he’d rebel and fall all over again if it meant he got to have the very same thing.
“It’s not like I have much say in the matter.” Castiel murmured, forcing Dean’s smile away along with his hand, no longer amused.
” Dean shook through the outburst, eyes moving rapidly around the room. “I’m angry, alright? I am, I’m pissed. But all of that can go away if you— if you could just—” He let the silence resurface, coating him thinly. Dean looked down at the shirt clutched between his tear soaked hands, “
“What happened to sticking together?” Cas asked, hurt flashing so prominently in his eyes that for a moment Dean was at a standstill, flushed with uncertainty. “Doing what we can to stave this off? You said… I thought you wanted—”
“Yeah, no,” Sam smiled. “He seems fine to me, Dean. He might seem a little off sometimes, sure. But wouldn’t you be?”
“I’m sorry, Dean,” He said, squeezing Dean’s shoulder, and Dean felt a shock zip down his spine so fluidly that he flinched back, ripping them apart.
And Sam didn’t want any part of it.
Pain flared up bright and hot in his legs and around the rim of his head, blinding him as his vision sparked. His gun clattered to the ground in front of him, the weight of it in Dean’s hands feeling all wrong— and when had that happened? When had he forgotten how to do this?
The lights didn’t give him answers. Not a single one, but they did give him something. A memory, a flash of before. The briefest taste of what used to be, and in the last moments before darkness came to swallow him once again, Castiel remembered home.
“I did not fall out of your car,” He muttered, looking down at his shoes. “I… struggled to exit the vehicle.”
“Cas seem any different to you?”
“Of course,” Cas smiled knowingly, accepting the answer, but Dean knew he didn’t understand. Not really, and he didn’t know how he was supposed to explain that he wasn’t talking about the bunker.
Something told Dean that the joke hadn’t been all that funny to him.
“It was my fault honestly,” Dean sighed, resigned. “I never should have shown you the magic of Amazon. You went on a shopping spree for weeks after that.”
It was dangerous, how much Cas reminded Dean of himself in that moment.
“I can’t show myself to Castiel, Sam. It’s too much of a risk.”
Black and blue swirled in his vision once he was upright again, and he blinked at Sam blearily, wiping his mouth.
“Wanna go
“It is,” Dean rasped, emotion wrapping itself around his torso, squeezing relentlessly. “And it was my fault then just like it’s my fault now.”
Dean reached for the wrinkled paper in Castiel’s hands, and his breath stilled when their fingers brushed, the barest contact enough to pull his heart back down from his throat. Cas didn’t say anything as Dean smoothed the paper out across his thigh, looking at the list of ingredients, but his eyes trailed him wordlessly.
It was almost impossible to bring himself to look at Cas again.
“Yeah, yeah.” Sam grumbled, pouting.
With Sam pushing eighty on some dirt backroad that felt as if it hadn’t seen a pair of tires in over a decade, they got back to the motel in less than half an hour, and Dean barely made it outside before he was hunching over and throwing up right there in the parking lot.
Before Dean could say anything else, a careful hand came up to wrap around the back of his wrist. With both hands now on Dean, Castiel exhaled slowly, the warmth of it spilling out between them. Dean shivered.
“I don’t want you hiding anymore.”
“I can’t,” Jack spun around to face Dean, serving him this crushing look that had Dean struggling to breathe. “Chuck was never meant to be able to enter the Empty. That’s what was written, that was the truth. But he rewrote the rules, he— he changed the story to
And looking at Cas now, dressed in a god awful mix of Sam and Dean’s clothes, the oversized flannel he was wearing making him look especially small, Dean still couldn’t bring himself to feel relief that Cas was back. Not completely, not without a million other emotions battling it out for top pick.
“Damn right you don’t understand,” Dean scoffed, doing his best to swallow down a stab of annoyance. “You don’t understand half of it.”
“God goes dark side, shit hits the fan, but none of that matters because Jack brought Eileen back. Jack brought everyone back, good as new— so why is Cas the fucking exception, huh? Why do I feel like getting him back this time was just a worse way of losing him?”
Dean didn’t know what he’d do if that was the case.
Sam waded through a sea of dark smoke and drunken limbs before bursting out of the bar’s alleyway. A woman reached out to him, a pair of blood-red nails brushing sensually over the bulk of his shoulder, and he jerked away on instinct, cowering as he moved past.
Emotionless, Dean stood up and walked over to the coffee machine with his head low and his heart hung lower, finding exactly what he’d feared. Cas hadn’t made enough coffee for the both of them. Dean couldn’t even remember the last time that happened.
There were people already pouring in the doors by the time they arrived at the bar, heavy groups of drunk friends and nervous teenagers lingering in the smoke-hazed gravel lot. The sun hadn’t gone down quite yet, but the sky had already started to break apart, streaks of orange light fading into the surrounding trees. Dean had been to this place plenty of times before, and never had he seen it quite like this.
Dean snorted. “You think?”
“What? You mean lay down?” Dean mumbled roughly, body turning to look at Cas in question, an eyebrow rising as his voice fell away.
“The grace won’t be left unattended, Dean,” Jack warned lightly. He already had this look of regret on his face, his forehead pulled down in a way that made him look alarmingly like Cas. “You both might have to fight your way through.”
That and a vision of green eyes. There was something about green eyes.
Slowly, Jack curled his fingers into the sleeves of his jacket. His leg bounced nervously, and he looked down at his sole-worn shoes.
“I don’t know what you expect him to do. I mean, you said it yourself, Cas was taken by the Empty. A place we happen to know nothing about, and a place Jack can’t even enter.”
“Isn't drinking on pain medicine rather unwise?” Cas asked through a scowl, blinking down to find Dean giving him the most deflated look.
Dean walked up to the frozen meat section with a grin split halfway up his face. He threw a package of bacon into the basket— the regular kind, not any of that turkey crap Sam was always begging him to get— and turned to gawk at Cas, uncertain whether to be amused or offended.
“Well,” Dean smiled languidly. “Anything worth doing is worth doing right.”
“What,” Dean laughed. “You can’t spare a little God juice to just go in and take it?”
memories. Dean and Cas, Cas and Dean. The quiet sittings and the heavy talking and the smiles they hid by dropping their heads in the darkness, averting their eyes before the smoke between them could spark a flame.
after weeks of radio silence, not expecting an answer but
“You’re human,” Dean started, already heading for some cliff, some distant fork in the road he wasn’t prepared for. “You’re human, I mean— I mean you could just… and
There were simple changes. Like how her hair was shorter, cut right passed her shoulders, the ends curled. Or how her makeup was lighter, less smudged and more neat, blended nicely with her eyes. But there were grander changes as well, skin deep and core driven, changes that went beyond physical.
Dean was still just as scared, even full-grown and able-bodied and angry enough to take down anyone who tried to step on him. Speaking his truth was still terrifying, fundamentally unthinkable. It burned through his blood and churned acid in his stomach. It still brought him back to a time when hiding was all he could do, and breathing a word of any of it was dangerous enough to get him killed.
And with the way Rowena breathed in, almost like she’d just been told something that meant a great deal, Sam figured she believed him.
“Mmh? Do what?” Dean asked innocently, raising his eyebrows. Miracle whimpered from the ground, nose budding against the front of Dean’s thigh.
Dean thought instead.
“You mentioned it briefly over the phone, but,” Patience rolled the sleeves of her sweater up, features shaping with nerves. “What exactly is wrong with him?”
“Alright, it’s gonna take me a few hours at the least. You gonna be okay for that long?”
“I know it hasn’t been easy for you, Dean. We’ve done our best to make things feel normal, for as long as we can. But seeing Cas like this, it’s...”
He asked again, once more, and this time he shook with it, “
Cas’s eyes turned painfully soft, sorrow melting him to the bone. “I don’t know if that’s—”
His mouth didn’t move and his body remained frozen, but Dean felt his own lungs gasp for air, expanding in their need for more. His pulse was flaring wildly, hot beneath his skin, and he looked at Sam to find his brother sitting rigid in his chair, his feet pushed out in front of him as though he’d been seconds away from bolting towards Dean.
Dean wasn’t sure who leaned in first, but it was Sam who led them. It was Sam who threw his arms around Dean’s shoulders before Dean could try and do the same, and he pulled Dean down as if Dean was the little brother this time, seeking something he could never voice.
“You alright, man?” Sam asked, clearly amused, and Dean didn’t know how much of the phone call he could hear, but the grin on his face as he signed to Eileen in the backseat wasn’t promising.
“Cas—”
was here, dying, and you fucking—”
“And you did what you did to stay alive. Just like you always have, just like we all do,” Dean said, and Cas seemed to understand what that meant.
” She sighed back, effortless and serene as if she was merely fiddling with her nails. Over the line, Sam heard her close a book with heavy finality, the image of orange hair and golden dust flashing in his mind as she said, “
This hurt was never going to go away. Not while Cas was still gone, not while Dean still had so much left to say.
“I’m what?” Dean asked.
“I’ve always wanted you, Dean,” Cas said, voice sweeping low. “Angels inherit sexual desire in human vessel’s the same way we inherit their sight and hearing. It’s something that’s always been there. It’s only now that I…” There’s something undeniably gripping about the way he looked at Dean then, eyes blazing hot, reaching right through Dean to pull at his stomach. “I’m feeling the full extent of it.”
“Oh, yeah, we’re great. Real connection there, me and him,” Dean smiled, throwing his feet up on the chair Cas had just been sitting in.
Cas was just too damn brave sometimes.
“You don’t mind do you?” Dean asked as they stepped into their shared room, figuring he should at least act like he’d be willing to hit the road again tonight if Cas really wanted to.
“You are more to us than a meat suit full of angel juice you dick,” Dean snapped. “None of that matters, that’s never been what mattered,” Cas was looking at Dean now, waiting for him to continue, but Dean didn’t. All he said was, “I thought I told you that.”
“What is with you?” Sam finally asked once they were on the road, the Impala’s heater running full blast. “Just the other day you were serious about laying low, and now there’s some lighting strikes and you... wanna just take off?”
“I mean with the world the way it is, you could get out of the life if you really wanted to. Haul ass to California, or wherever the hell it is you wanna go now. Start a family, have a few flannel wearing rugrats with your stupid hair,” Dean shrugged, mustering up a smile. “It wouldn’t be the worst thing you ever did.”
” He said, and Dean had to refrain himself from punching the damn steering wheel.
Dean turned to walk back to the driver’s side, fully intending to haul ass back to the bunker and drink a few too many beers to fall asleep, but stopped dead when he heard the Impala groan painfully under a sudden weight. With a jerk of his head, Cas came back into view, his body outstretched across the hood and the front windshield in a manner that would have been sexy had it been demonstrated on
Sam exhaled shakily, “Jack?”
“Almost finished.” The woman mumbled, slowly tracing over the Enochian lettering etched right above Cas’s hipbone.
Dean huffed out a laugh and kissed Cas before he could overthink it, needing the contact again, wanting the heat he could feel building like a cloud around them. Castiel responded so beautifully to Dean’s pressing mouth, head tilting just right, back bending beneath Dean’s wandering hands.
” She said instantly, so sincere that Dean could only stare out at the road for a few moments, throat working slowly.
“No, no no no— you said Cas wasn’t strong enough yet! We gotta wait until he wakes up, until we know the grace won’t tear right through him.”
a dark reminder of what Dean had lost that day, what he couldn’t afford to lose again.
Bullet wounds, battle scars— that’s what he could handle. That’s what he’d been ready for. He could have built Cas from the ground up again if he had to. Dean would have taken Cas for what he was, broken or not, still beautiful—
So it’s familiar, the feeling that washed over Dean. He imagined the look he gave Sam was familiar too, the smile on his face nearing painful. But it’s the realization that followed that made Dean clamp up unexpectedly. The understanding that, if Sam stayed, if Sam chose the life, then Dean would have no choice but to follow.
“We don’t know that for sure,” Dean demanded, hellbent and desperate. “He’s God. I’m sure he can figure it out.”
Dean had never noticed before— maybe that damn trench coat had always hidden it, or this was something human and genuine and
“Is there anything else?” Cas asked, encouraging, and Dean fought back the urge to laugh.
The woman plucked a tissue from somewhere behind the counter and handed it over without a word, mouth pinched. Sam took it graciously, bowing his head, but the second he turned around his eyes went wide with embarrassment.
“You don’t have to apologize. There’s nothing to apologize for just... where are you? Sam had a close call and I—” Dean swallowed, heart jolting in his chest, eyes closing. He curled his hand into a fist. “
“A little, but it mostly just feels sensitive,” Cas’s shoulders gave a little jump. “It’s not like I’m having to go over the worst of it. I won’t have to worry about hair growing there anymore.”
“What the hell’s happening?!” Dean screamed, and when he moved, he might as well have been wading through water. He could barely put one foot in front of the other, the weight of him teetering left and right as he stumbled towards Cas’s bedside.
“Were all my purchases of this quality?” Cas countered back, clearly expecting a genuine answer.
He didn’t pull them closer, or drag his hand up. All he did was hold onto Dean, but with the way he looked at him— captivated and endeared by the very sight of him, the most minute details of his existence, the way he had
Dean clenched his jaw and listened for the tick, teeth aching as he bit back the tremor he felt trying to creep into his mouth and chin.
“Don’t worry about that,” Dean said, sounding sincere, almost certain. He smiled at Cas and patted him lightly on the leg, not expecting the way his heart immediately settled at the touch. “We’ll figure it out, alright? Find some angel to patch you up, you’ll be good as new.”
“You obviously know who I am,” Cas spoke quietly, brows furrowed as he watched Dean tie the cloth around his wrist. “Probably more than I know myself. But how do I know you’re not lying to me? You— you know I don’t remember anything, you could very well easily—”
For the first time that night, Eileen’s expression wavered. Her gaze settled tensely on Dean’s mouth, making sure she was understanding him right, and her eyebrows arched in a way that made her look helpless with emotion.
Cas looked down at himself, hands smoothing over the front of his maroon hoodie.
Ultimately, Dean was grateful that Sam had kept the amulet all those years. Hiding it away with the hope that maybe, someday, when the tide had turned and the pain of his choices had softened and eased, he’d give it back to Dean and know for a fact that Dean would accept it; and Dean did.
“But… it’s different now,” Cas murmured, thoughtful.
Or at least Dean couldn’t allow himself to think so. He wasn’t sure there was a way out if he went down that path, the spindling thought of Cas and humanity and the choice to abandon it all— abandon everything he’d been just to look at Dean from level ground, just to breathe the same air and drag through time with his feet firmly planted. Dean didn’t want to think about it; what he’d
It’s almost alarming how easy it really was. As if Dean didn’t have twelve years worth of restraint still screaming at him to stop.
“Woah! Hey!” Dean moved to help, a helpless chuckle rolling off his tongue, but he stopped just short of grabbing Miracle’s neck, heart slowing to a graceless stop in the middle of his chest.
This wasn’t even a choice. Dean knew that; but the pressure was on and he felt sick to his stomach as he left to get dressed, just the sight of his own bedroom again making his head blare. He took the gun he kept under his pillow, and continued on, checking the rounds as he made his way back to the war room.
“Oh I’m fucking terrific,” Dean smiled, averting his eyes.
I know this didn’t turn out the way you wanted, and as far as last chances go I definitely dropped the ball—”
“What do I do?” Dean asked. He could feel Castiel’s breath on his cheek. “Tell me what to do. Tell me how to help you.”
“You seriously expect me to believe that Cas chose this? Willingly? No fucking way,” Dean knew how he was looking at Sam, desperate and imploring, needing Sam to just fucking get behind him on this, but Dean didn’t care. He didn’t care how unethical, how impossible of a wish— Dean couldn’t accept that Cas had given up something else for him; something even bigger than his life.
Dean parked the car away from anyone else, not looking to risk some drunk bastard getting so much as a fingerprint on her, and turned at the waist to look at Cas.
It used to make him anxious, as if he was nothing more than an animal being stripped bare for the taking. Now, it just made Dean’s head spin, body warming up like a furnace. He wondered if he’d ever get to feel that way again.
Agonizing in every nerve, every shredded inch as he ripped himself apart just to come out the other side alive and breathing. Not swimming, not drowning in a sea of black but really, truly, breathing. He inhaled once, choked and desperate, and felt the air around him bend in motion, rippling as if pushed.
“I’m not going anywhere.”
“Look, I’m glad you’re feeling up for a case now. I am, but that’s just it,” Sam frowned, lowering his voice slightly, “
“You know,” Dean repeated, disbelief forcing a sharpened smile to pull at the side of his face. “Well, news flash, kid. The phone works both ways! While you were out of commission doing fuck all, we were here.
“Best flavor of pie?” His voice rang through the dead silence of the library, and when Dean turned away from his tray of pie with crust flakes still stuck to his chin, he found Cas grinning at him from across the table.
Grown and full-bodied, existing with an identity that even he knew was muddled and trapped somewhere deep, deep down. Hidden as though it was alive and horribly afraid.
“Does it bother you that she’s…” Dean could hardly recognize his own voice with the ringing in his ears, blood suddenly running thick and hot through the pulse in his neck. “That she’s gay?”
“It’s enough,” Sam rasped out, grateful beyond words. “It’ll be enough, I promise.”
” Cas deadpanned, looking Dean straight in the eyes.
There was a certain rhythm to the way they did this now; habits had been made, a ritual established, but Dean’s heart still pounded all the same when Cas started kicking off his shoes, his steps familiar, the sound of him breathing all too comforting.
Dean was half way through a smile of his own when he felt the car teeter beneath him, the passenger door squeaking harshly as Cas collapsed into it with a grunt of pain.
Cas watched with soft eyes as Dean laughed, the act feeling so unfortunately rare yet special because it was all for Cas, because of Cas and his adorable innocence and blue eyes and wild hair. Because Cas had confessed his feelings for Dean through a goddamn
Softly, he said, “That’s not the life I want, Dean. At least not right now.”
“And though you might not want it, I’m gonna give you some advice about that girl of yours, free of charge,” She said calmly, forcing Dean to stop and look up in surprise, his wallet not even halfway out of his pocket yet before she was smiling and saying, “call her back. Do somethin’ other than skirt around the obvious, because honey,” She scoffed, curling a hand around her hip. “It’s obvious.”
“Or a kid that’s been given too much responsibility,” She countered, and Dean hadn’t noticed it before, but when he turned to finally look at her, it was sadness that registered first, glaring off of her in shimmering waves.
and it hurt just to think about. The past, the present, any of it, but Dean knew what it meant and he knew where it led. “That’s how you know they’re family,” He said, nodding. “That’s how you know that you care.”
Castiel lingered, swaying as if in a dream. He held Dean still with careful fingers grasping at his chin, his skin warm and his kisses warmer, starting from innocent and small to indulgent and heavy, scattering them all over Dean’s forehead, breathing them both in.
And then, with disbelief clouding his judgment and worry pressing urgency into his fingertips, Dean reached a hand out to cradle Cas’s face, thumb brushing scar tissue as he asked, “You really can’t feel anything?”
What had Cas expected? Of course Dean was going to look for him, find him,
Dean went quiet, shoulders clamping up. Sam continued with a sigh.
He was too focused on his ice cream sundae to care all that much.
There was never a time where he hadn’t. And then, because Dean was already falling, already fumbling for Cas’s hand— he breathed in deep and said, “I fucking
come up with a plan, and for Dean’s sanity, Cas needed to fucking cooperate.
Dean didn’t understand who Jack was supposed to be now. He was their kid, the son of Satan turned good and Castiel’s most precious gift— but Jack’s memory said otherwise. His knowledge held the weight of their creator, their puppeteer, the very thing that had damned them all since the beginning, and that wasn’t something Dean could just ignore.
“You alright?” Sam asked, and Dean looked up just in time to catch the bag of Funyuns that came hurtling his way.
“If you want, I could—”
“Fuck,” He gasped, and it’s terror that steered him then. It grabbed two fistfuls of his soul and dragged him sideways— his hand meeting the sharp scrape of tree bark. He tipped his weight into it, bit out, “
Going on with this story, I just want to address that Dean’s relationship with his anger is going to be dealt with as accurately as possible. There’s no doubt in my mind that Cas’s confession helped Dean’s self image, but anger is tricky and it’s not something that just goes away, especially with decades of trauma.
Sam was typing frantically on his phone when Dean stepped out into the hallway. Dean tried raising his eyebrows at him, wanting to know what was up, but Sam quickly slipped the phone back into his pocket, giving Dean a guilty smile.
Dean peered over at him. “No. Not yet.”
“Yeah?” Dean laughed. “You used to scarf those things down by the handful, man. Or, that’s what you told me anyway.”
The room took in a breath. Dean tried not to drown in it.
“I’m fine, Dean.”
and at least there would be
Cas looked back down at the table with his hands folded gently in front of him, relaxed in a way Dean had come to recognize. Cas almost never wore his bandages anymore; his face was dark and patchy with facial hair, unruly around his bright scarring, but the lack of care didn’t bother Dean in the slightest. As long as he could still see Cas’s smile, he was content.
It was on and off, back and forth, nothing lasting long enough to cling to, and Dean was being bled dry. He knew he was losing Cas, again, somehow, and all he could do was watch. All Dean had ever been able to do was watch.
Patience opened her eyes slowly, breathing hard, and all the tension in Castiel’s limbs was released back into the bedding. His eyes slipped closed.
Most people would think Dean would have gotten used to this overtime; Cas’s general lack of understanding when it came to giving Dean his personal space, but that was just it. It only seemed to happen with Dean.
Cas gave the tiniest smile at that, just the impression of it tapping at the corners of his mouth before it was gone, leaving with the briefest wince.
“You don’t like them?”
“Come on, man, let me see. Shirt off,” Dean said, trying to sound encouraging, but his own ears heard nothing but blatant excitement, and Dean dropped his gaze against a rush of crimson red, his face burning with it.
“What’s the plan, Jack?”
“He’s lost all of his memories, and has only recently started getting them back,” Sam amended quickly, frowning. “What we don’t understand is why his memory is so selective. He can walk and talk and function like normal, he remembers that much. We’re hoping you can tell us why everything else is just... gone?”
“I don’t know, Cas! I didn’t mean to say anything, just forget it.” Dean clamped up and closed himself off just like that, jaw clenching bitterly.
“Yes, Dean.”
Dean grinned. “You alright there, Rocky?”
Chapter Warnings: discussions of death, and brief mentions of Dean's past involving sex work. None of it is heavier than what's already implied in canon, and isn't descriptive, but please stay safe <33
Castiel blinked at him, slow and imploring, wanting to catch even the smallest shift.
“Look, Dean, I don’t know much about angels, but I do feel energies, and when I looked inside of him—” Patience leveled Castiel with a heavy look, eyes tracking over his sleeping figure. “His insides are charred. His soul is shredded,” Her face softened. “I’m sorry.”
In theory, it should be easy. Dean should be able to just take the hit and keep pushing. Keep fighting back, keep up the smiles and the cutbacks and the sarcasm. He’s had plenty of practice, hasn’t he? But Dean couldn’t shoulder it any longer, not all at once, and his mask slipped like wet paint, trailing down his face miserably.
“You look sad.”
“Dean,” Castiel scolded, reaching for Dean’s arm. “He’s just a kid.”
“Miracle!” Dean called suddenly, letting out a whistle that echoed throughout the entire bunker, hands clapping in front of him. “Here boy, daddy’s home!”
He knew it was. That voice, that presence, the very shape of Dean’s name on his lips bringing Dean enough comfort to close both laptops with a soft click. He turned the police scanner off, scooting his beer to the side.
is what Dean really meant, and Sam gave him a tired smile, his eyes warm.
“Cas, there’s someone on their way to see you,” Dean said, and the look Cas gave him was close to terrifying. “Sammy called her. She’s… she’s the plan.”
The staring and the watching his every move, studying Dean with what he’d thought was cruelty, when all along it had stemmed from quiet interest; it had come from a place of honest love tearing through a borrowed heart that hadn’t yet learned how to beat on its own before it was stretching towards Dean.
“I thought you said you liked it.” He murmured, staring at the side of Dean’s face while Dean gaped at the two of them in the mirror.
calling. “You… you drink coffee in the morning, don’t you?”
Dean dropped his head at the thought, mouth stretching with a smile. His boots scuffed against the floor.
Dean stopped. Heart falling still in his chest, jaw tensing as he pressed his lips closed. Right. Dean was going to have to get better at this whole honesty thing wasn’t he?
“Funny,” Sam scoffed. “You must have misplaced that phone number. Again. Cause’ I still don’t have it.”
Dean stared out at the road in front of him, silent. Telling Jody that Cas was gone, that the world was back and the people were home but somehow they’d still gotten fucked over because
Castiel cleared his throat. “Come in.”
“I was right about that too,” Castiel said, blinking up at Dean wondrously. Dean stared back, seeing him as nothing but slivers of blue and grey. “I don’t know how, but when I’m around you, the pain subsides. For brief moments, it becomes bearable. But there’s always a limit. There’s always a cost,” He swallowed hard, struggling for a moment. “Every time the pain comes back to me, it’s worse than before. And I—”
Dean took an awkward step forward, smiling through the falter. “Three cheeseburgers to-go, please. Oh— and one with extra onions. Thanks, sweetheart.”
Dean had to be careful. There was a line here somewhere, hidden in the sand. Cross it and the walls of Cas’s mind go crashing down around him, his life like a woven string attached. But watching Cas wade through his wars and stare past a blinding sun just to get a taste of what lied beyond was hollowing, a creature begging for the past.
” He spoke vehemently, suddenly feeling more exhausted than he had in days, everything catching up to him all at once. “Reverse spells, potions. Anything useful Rowena might have had we’ve searched it twice. We’re doing the best we can.”
For years, it had worked.
“Man, I must be losing my mind, cause I know you’re not still thinking about it,” Dean dragged his eyes up to Sam’s. “I was talking about Jack, Sam. What’s the word on Jack?”
Dean looked over, eyes falling to the tired slouch of Castiel’s shoulders; the subtle curl of dark hair at the shell of his ear. He was tracing the interior of the door with his finger now, head resting back against the seat with forced patience. It didn’t take long for Cas to notice Dean staring at him. He raised his head almost instantly, blue eyes full and earnest.
everything the same but everything different. Deeper and better but harder and scarier, the world growing with them.
“Wait,” Castiel said suddenly, drawing Dean back by the arm. “You can’t tell Sam about what just happened.”
“It’s good to meet you. How long have you known Sam and Dean?”
Sam inhaled deeply, ignoring the heat in his eyes and the itch in his throat, all of it finally starting to settle in. Fixing Cas wasn’t going to be easy, but since when was anything?
It wasn’t that he never thought of Jack anymore. Not at all. It was that he never
“What I mean is, as good as things can be I guess, considering.”
Calmly, Dean switched his phone to the other hand. Then, he proceeded to slap Sam across the shoulder hard enough to feel the sting of it ring back through his own palm. He cursed as Sam flailed his arms, shaking his hand out. Dean could see Eileen giggling through the rearview, eyes mirthful and bright.
“Right,” Sam muttered, wistful. He answered the video call with a tap of his thumb, managing to smile just at the sight of her. “Hey, Eileen.”
But somehow none of it seemed to matter now. If the Cas that loved him was gone, then who was this Cas supposed to be?
“I said it—”
Dean didn’t stop, but his footsteps got heavier, arms dragging behind him as he marched down the small flight of stairs into the war room.
“Send Castiel here back to the Empty, and an eternity of fulfillment awaits,” Lundy said breathily, the very prospect of it making his eyes glaze over. “That’s the idea anyway. Death isn’t pleasant for anybody, but the one who wrangles this one back might just get themselves a penthouse view down under.”
” Sam said, making a face as he balled up his bloody tissue and stuffed it away. “It could just be any other angel out there.”
Blood is all there ever was.
For a second, the only movement was Lundy’s mouth, his upper lip curling into this repulsive division of a snarl and a seething smile. A picture of pure evil that Dean knew Cas— this Cas, had never faced, and yet was now staring at head-on with an unwavering intensity that only came from a being who knew exactly what was coming next.
“Dean,” Cas said softly, apologetic in a way that told Dean
“You…” Cas swallowed, the corner of his mouth pitching upwards. “You mean-”
Castiel was born missing the sun.
Dean absorbed it all. Loved every second of it.
A train blared in the distance, a stream of light cutting through the trees and heading North. Dean looked up through squinted eyes, trying to find the warehouse he knew was somewhere nearby; at the very least, he could still remember that.
“Uh, like— like markings in the ground, or some sort of energy… thing,” He made a gesture with his hands, ears turning red. Finally, he coughed out, “Blood? Was there blood?”
The door closed behind him with a soft click.
I was also really excited to add Jody and Claire into this chapter, considering the actual writers completely forgot about them *pained laughing* so I hope you enjoyed their little moments! Thank you all so much for reading, and make sure to come scream at me here and on Twitter @ricochetdean where I'll keep you updated on future posts.
“Whew! You boys just don’t stop do you?” He exclaimed, face splitting upwards with a teetering grin. “And here I was thinkin’ that I’d let you live. I’ve got no business with you, no hard feelings— though I probably ought to, knowing your history with my kind.”
“I suppose I’ll take your word for it. You were right about PB&J after all,” Cas said, and with an adoring timidness that Dean felt all the way to his fingertips, Cas set the Walkman aside on the nightstand next to the empty plate from earlier, lips curving upwards.
“I don’t know what you want me to say,” Sam muttered painfully, brows knitted together. “Jack’s still off the radar.”
It took Cas approximately five seconds to respond, all of which Dean spent feeling like his ass was hanging out in the open, his heart pounding through his skin.
With his voice tethered straight to his heart, all Dean managed to say was, “You have no fucking idea,” and it was a helpless, trembling thing that barely caught wind.
“Because if you so much as
“Cas,” He sighed. “That’s the last thing I’m worried about right now.”
“If you’re scared of my judgement, I can assure you there is none. Not for anyone, but especially not you.”
Dean grinned at her and finally looked down at his phone. His features hardened. He tried not to think about it too much— he just raised the phone to his ear, breathed in, and answered with a sharp, “Yeah?”
Dean’s eyes flickered back and forth between Cas’s before the angel finally turned away, a faint smile playing across his plump lips.
no matter how much his tax accountant vessel liked to convince Dean otherwise.
“If Jack could be here he would,” Sam said quietly, hardly even a whisper that Dean stamped out with a wave of his hand.
“You’re not handling shit, sweetheart,” Dean retorted, and it took a few seconds for his body to fully react to the word, everything inside of him pulling taunt. He tried not to remember how the last time he’d let it slip was in pitch-black darkness. Dean flicked a finger at one of the
“You did fine, kiddo. Really,” He said. “There’s nothing to apologize for. Now finish your ice cream before it melts.”
he loved him. Dean was so fucking in love with him, and he didn’t know what to do about any of it.
“You look badass, man.”
The knock he eventually managed was stiff and awkward, rattling horribly as though it was his own voice stuttering through the hardwood.
"You already told me that, Cas," Dean frowned tightly. "I don't blame you."
Dean watched Cas silently, observing the way he dug through the drawers in search of sugar and groaned as he bent into the fridge to grab milk, spine cracking when he straightened back up.
“But he’s alright?” Cas pressed, the urgency in it making Dean shake his head as he stood up.
“Hey,” The boy didn’t respond, but he looked away hastily, panic flaring in his face. “
But none of Dean’s questions were for this Cas. This Cas couldn’t give him the answers he needed, because this Cas didn’t feel the way Dean needed either. It wasn’t hard to figure out.
“Because you really think you won’t be able to move on from this. From what’s going to happen to me. You don’t realize how strong you are.”
“Because you’re Castiel and these are your clothes— I don’t know!” Dean exclaimed, throwing his hands in the air when Cas’s furrow only deepened. He hastily started searching for his wallet, needing an excuse. “Here, go get you a candy bar or something. You must be starving.”
Sam let out a bark of laughter he immediately regretted, pain slithering in fast. “Just a scratch actually,” He grimaced, clearing his throat.
“Reverse exorcism,” Dean nodded, tucking the knife back into his pocket. He sucked in a sharp breath, exhaling with a wince and a weak thumbs up, “Good call, Sammy.”
He even says Dean’s name the same way. Gentle and overbearing all at once, pushing through the mesh of it like it’s the single most important word in the universe, the only thing that comes out of his mouth with a piece of his being still attached.
“Nothing happened, man. I’m sorry to say we rolled snake eyes on this one, but we’ve still got time. I don’t want you worrying about it, alright?” It’s sad just how easy it really is. The words run smooth and Cas’s eyes soften instantly, his concern ebbing away at the certainty in Dean’s voice.
The three of them were just a few miles outside of Kansas when Dean’s phone rang again, forcing him to grunt awkwardly as he grabbed the wheel with one hand and reached into his back pocket.
Beautiful. This angel, this… man, was beautiful.
Overall, it was a fairly easy spell to gather. Once the bunker was quiet and Dean had finally gone to bed with his breath reeking of whiskey, Sam had been able to collect the ingredients and recite the Latin without even glancing at Rowena’s spellbook; Sam had nearly memorized it by now, and somehow, he knew Rowena would have preened at the sight of him.
Dean looked at Cas with pure love in his eyes, face melting with it, insides crackling away as his heart ached something awful. Dean had missed this more than anything.
He let go of Cas's hand to take a tuft of his dark hair between two fingers, watching the strands curl around his skin when the wind took control again.
“This is why we stopped?” Dean grunted out, but his face took a softer shape when he saw the way Castiel was looking at him; quiet and thoughtful, hoping Dean would understand.
Cas surfaced with a pinched face, clearly uncomfortable.
“Drinks must be half off or something,” Sam shrugged, leaning forward to stare out at the crowd.
“It’s quite alright, Dean.”
His eyes stayed locked onto Dean even as he was torn from his hospital bed by a familiar face and dragged into the center of the room. His IV ripped once he was pulled too far, and Cas growled in pain as bright blood made a path down his wrist, bare feet cracking beneath broken glass from where the window at the back of the room had been blown through.
you to know,” A breath, short and miserable, Dean’s features mangling into something raw. “Me too. Okay? Me too. Do you get it, man? Do you understand?”
Dean padded into the kitchen, looking to find Sam, and he nearly collided with the doorway as a result, hands reaching out to steady himself against the frame.
“Thank you.”
“Rowena,” Sam berated.
“Well, he’s not comatose or drooling all over himself, so I’d say that’s a win.”
“I’m a Winchester,” Jack answered, smiling through the truth, and Dean couldn’t help it; his heart burned hot in the center of his chest. “Besides, even if I could sneak in, the Empty would sense me immediately. I’d be swarmed, thrown out,” He raised his eyebrows, the lilt of his mouth turning giddy. “But just like any Winchester, I have a plan.”
” Dean snapped at him, finally getting the boy to raise his eyes long enough to fix him with an ugly glare, jaw set hard. “Anybody ever told you it’s rude to stare?”
And then there were arms wrapping around Castiel, a body melting against his own, and Cas’s voice stopped as if clipped at the root, completely insignificant. There was a silence that followed, heavy but adoring, genuine but dazed, and Dean did his best to breathe through it, the shake at his core forcing his limbs to move faster than his thoughts. He couldn’t think about what this meant yet; only that he needed it, and Cas was
There was a Gas N’ Sip just five miles West of the bunker that was always Dean’s first pick for supply runs, but the thought of going there now reminded him of human Cas in Idaho, nuking taquitos and going on dates in that stupid sweater vest.
“Don’t kick me,” Dean gave Cas a sharp look, warning, and Cas just took another swig of whiskey and shrugged, completely indifferent as Dean pulled off his flip flops and began unbandaging his feet.
Silence filled the void until Dean was ready. And when he finally spoke again, his lips turned loose with a lopsided grin, he found Sam already frowning.
“God, you
Dean was quiet for a long moment, hands fumbling with the needle and stitching thread.
Truth is, Dean wishes for a lot of things. But there was just something about Cas being human, matching the gaunt in which Dean walked, copying the way Dean stuffed his face when he ate and wiped his hands on the front of his jeans— it all made Dean ache for the kind of normalcy he hadn’t let himself think about for years.
Cas dove out of the way just as Dean came forward with the demon knife, but the second he got close Lundy’s body bent backwards with an inhuman cry, mouth erupting with black smoke.
The plan was that there was no plan. At least not one that Cas knew about.
It’s an attest to just how well Dean really knows his little brother that when Sam looked at him next, nothing but a sigh leaving his lungs and a slight heat stirring at the corners of his mouth, Dean already knew he’d made a wrong turn.
Warmth pulsed through Dean, persistent and unbelievably hot, and more than anything he wanted to kiss Cas; to finally feel the softness of his mouth and strength behind his hands, to stop dreaming and start
She left his shoes on the counter and drew closer, sinking down to sit at the edge of his bed. Her eyes were worried, already, instinctively, and Dean sat up with a flaming headache, wanting to reach out for her but unsure how to.
It didn’t go unnoticed by either of them. Castiel’s entire demeanor changed, body slumping with sympathy that only made Dean’s ears burn with shame.
until he felt his hand retract at the sound of a guttural scream.
Dean wanted a lot even when he asked for nothing, and if he tried hard enough, accepting the pain that came with it, Dean could even imagine that he and Cas were together. That they were happy and content and bickering in the middle of a grocery store over what to make for dinner, and that was it. That was their lives.
If Cas would have just turned, looked, then he would have seen how fucking in love Dean was. How enamoured, and maybe he would have even realized that it had been that way for years. Ever since Castiel laid a hand on him in hell, restoring Dean from nothing but a few burnt out nerves and strips of flesh into something whole and real and capable of feeling so goddamn much.
“I’m sorry, have you met me?” Dean asked.
“Longmont, Colorado. I’m… outside a laundromat.” Cas replied, sounding confused.
Human Cas was a sore subject. It used to be that way for both of them, neither of them ever wanting to talk about it. But with the way Cas was now, he had no problem with looking over at Dean and diving head first into the tension that had surfaced there, head tilting gently as the skin around Dean’s eyes grew tight and thin, any warmth in his face retreating back inside of him like a skittering animal.
“Dean,” He sounded pained, straining with the word. “It would be impossible to try and maintain—”
Castiel waited a beat before asking, “Like what?”
Dean didn’t know how it happened, but Claire ended up being first in line for welcoming hugs, and he was almost knocked back into the map table from the sheer force of her colliding against his chest. Dean groaned on impact, withering against her, but Claire’s arms wounded tight around the back of his neck, forcing him still, and Dean smiled through the sweetened pang in his chest.
There was a frantic hitch over the line, the receiver passing through a rush of air and a swearing Castiel before settling and, in the most sickeningly sweet voice possible, came a— “
Dean figured out pretty quickly that Cas was probably finding these questions online somewhere, every one of them cheesy enough to make Dean’s eyes roll back, but something about them made him feel warm too. These types of questions, the silly ones, the
“Sam?”
Thinking of Jack always led to thinking of Mary one way or another.
Close. Dean knew he was close, but in the end it was Cas who found Dean, calling from some payphone in the middle of nowhere.
” She repeated, only this time she actually said it.
“I know I’ve never met him, but when you said Jack took God’s powers I guess I just expected him to look… older.”
“Hey, Cas!” He called out, lifting an arm to try and get the other’s attention. “The hell are you doing, man?”
“Oh? And where is he?”
that sucked,” He groaned.
“I know a very small amount,” Cas said. “I’m… not sure why. I don’t remember ever learning.”
Sam grimaced. “Don’t ever say that again.”
“I’ll be damned,” Dean breathed, swelling with warmth. “That’s great, Sammy. Great for you, I mean. Eileen not so much, but—”
