Sherlock blinked down as the good doctor moved the stethoscope slowly lower, making more inquisitive noises. Finally, with a lick of the lips, John sat up, looked at Stamford. "Just as I thought."
The horse, who is exceedingly fond of apples, lowers his head and noses at John. He does not, however, press his velvet against the pocket in which John still has a half dozen succulent slices. He presses it between John's legs.
know is that a crapload of caffeine is sizzling through his veins and it is about to set his little brain on
London…he can see for miles in every direction it seems, and this woman, so excited, standing on tip-toe to see over exactly nothing…well.
Back then need was expressed in the innocence of hand-holding and knowledge sharing. Today it was expressed by offering his body to a husband that had stayed up too late, over-caffeinated himself stupid, and knew that "an orgasm stimulates the release of melatonin, oxytocin, and vasopressin and should calm me down" something-something "before Lestrade" something "any moment."
Sherlock grunted deep, and John's teeth tugged. Sherlock keened and John tugged harder. This went on awhile, until Sherlock started to shake, and then five, four, three, two…Sherlock moaned, stilled, and started to come and come, a wonderful sticky-wet heat that pooled right through John's dark jeans.
He told John how the prickly-soft hair felt against his kissing, kissing mouth. How Sherlock couldn't lip at it, could barely take hold of it with his teeth.
Because it starts immediately, with nearly every platelet donor. The moment the exit needle is placed in the crook of one arm, the return needle already in the other, suddenly, inexplicably, and absolutely people find themselves riven with
The second kiss was the kind of friendly buss John likes. Firm but not aggressive, a bright hello, a promise, and John was sure it was from the host's sister. (It was from the host.)
This was not one little bit of all right, and so, before his fifteenth birthday, he'd (mostly) stopped doing the second, which helped him gain control of the first, and so cease coping with the third.
Lestrade stopped so he could remember the point. He stared at his hand. With the pen in it. On the pad where he was two days into tracking his daily life so he could look back on—ah! Okay.
Instantly the tension released and the rope fell away. They'd been tied with nothing more than a slip knot.
Pacing, tapping, pacing, tapping John hadn't noticed that the big, shouty man had shut up. John stopped pacing just short of his favourite corner. He liked this one, the corner with the crooked inlay, the strange one that didn't look like a starburst at all.
John stood, started to say something, then changed his mind about what he was going to say. He gestured at the abandoned Borgiolis. "Your shoes."
—tube car and faced the annoying git whose expensively-clad penis he had, indeed, been unintentionally touching.
Yes, well, it was gone for just a few seconds, the few it took Sherlock to give mummy the thumbs up and then shout at the boy he couldn't see, "Stop throwing things!"
John slid off his chair, as if this would somehow bring him closer to his own hand. He looked along with Sherlock, who pointed to three red dots. "There are too many for a honey bee. They can only sting you one time. I guess it was a bumble bee then."
Or sometimes, well sometimes it's John, on his belly on their bed, back bowed so that his bare arse is presented perfectly for eating out, and he groans as Sherlock laps at him, and he keens as Sherlock's tongue slicks inside, and for the longest time John's close, close, so close, humping his own hand and spreading his legs wider, and it goes on so long his throat gets dry and he's dizzy from panting and then Sherlock will do it. He'll reach up, thread the fingers of their left hands together, and he'll hold so fast and so tight, that finally, good god finally, John comes.
One time that shifting had John having a one-sided fight with a bumble bee. He didn't know she was on the rock and he didn't know that it was a bee stinging him over and over in his little finger but he started whimpering and then fell back onto his bum, clutching his hand to his chest.
For those purple shirts of sex and perhaps Sherlock's fanciest lingerie, this dry cleaner would be the closest to their home as it's just across the street and a bit to the right. I have decided that this dry cleaner has seen many, many interesting things in the windows of 221B because she's up extra early to be available to the before-work crowd, while John and Sherlock are sometimes up extra late. Doing frisky things near the sitting room windows…
Sherlock Holmes both lifted his chin and looked down his nose. He's unused to being sassed by strangers. By 'colleagues,' yes, by his brother, his brother's assistant, the downstairs neighbor, the corner grocer, the dry cleaner, and by his landlord, certainly, but not usually by people unfamiliar with him.
John knows when people will hear. Yet even when he knows they won't, sometimes he talks anyway because sometimes it's he who needs to hear what he has to say.
John H. Watson is a war veteran, an ex-surgeon, and once chased an insurgent through a field of detonating fireworks. He is a difficult man to startle.
Sherlock was so shocked he hiccough-inhaled his own spit and then cried some more because that hurt. After awhile he wiped his nose with both hands and cried even more because now the snot was just so shiny and disgusting and by the time John came back Sherlock was in such a state it took an entire ten seconds to realise his new friend had returned.
That was when John and Sherlock learned exactly who they were together and that together was what they were meant to be.
For once Sherlock doesn't care about the case. Sherlock cares about remembering the first time John did this, fifteen years ago, after he joined the army. Sherlock hadn't liked it then. He feels differently now. John isn't going away this time.
"Oh god, he's in a storage—" John stopped talking when the detective actually looked as if he'd cry.
They'll release him in a couple hours, but right now he's weak but alert, getting fluids. John is asking him questions, and Sherlock is answering.
(really John?) [Yes, really Sherlock] I may or may not have got our hire car up onto two wheels as we chased a suspect down by the wharf. I consider it ironic that this upset John, since he can't even drive a car on four.
They didn't quite cry at the end of their final lesson, but the boys did put their foreheads together and whisper to each other for a long time.
"I read something once," John murmured a bit later, shifting again until Sherlock's massaging hands were well north of his knee. "It said to fall in love with a person's eyes. Because eyes never age, so if you fall in love with someone's eyes, you'll be in love forever."
John Watson grew five inches taller and three stone heavier and also maybe started breathing fire. "How
you are. And yes, I watched you at the pub quiz nights and at the bonfire—you could have just said hello—and all that time watching you was helping me figure out something that probably I should have figured out a long time ago. Yet, despite the fact that yes, I broke up with Grace because I realised I fancy you, as evidenced by daydreams that have a dozen times left me breathlessly hard in a public place—"
They have a three hour stop over in Jerusalem, then another in Istanbul before arriving in London—Sherlock lies twice so that they're seated together, once claiming they're married—and by that time they have talked without pause for twenty-two hours.

like. He wanted to understand its darker emotions: jealousy, grief, regret. With that data he was sure he'd be a good twenty-eight to thirty percent faster at cracking the grimmer cases, the ones that hinged on love's irrational passions, its inevitable disappointments.
The fifth time Sherlock fell over trying to take his jeans off so John got on the bedsit floor with him. They watched each other masturbate until their bellies were messy and slick.
pleasantries, Sherlock gestures with his chin at a lean woman in an expensive suit. "Financier. She's pretending each person is a possible stock pick."
John was about to say something when the man pointed behind him and precisely at Grace. "DC Superior, the very tall black woman who you—"
John Watson is an exceedingly patient man. John's seriously, bloody well, off-the-mother-fucking charts patient. But— "That's god damn
Where do the boys shop? Have a pint? Get over-tight shirts dry-cleaned? Well....maybe at these places right on Baker Street.
Mr. Pretty, however, offered just the two and then began wandering toward the floggers, garters, and handcuffs, so John quickly held up the curvy black item he'd been clutching this whole time and half-shouted, "So you'd suggest this one then?"
"I'm sure the close quarters you enjoyed during your military service left you comfortable with the intimate proximity of men, you might even find it—"
The three main schools, each less than a minute from Montague Street are: University of London (UL) where John Watson "in the year 1878...took my degree of Doctor of Medicine" as he says in
At the fourth lesson Sherlock observed that John breathed faster just before Sherlock touched him, but steadied to calmness when he did.
Not so Mr Holmes. For most of his ninety minutes on the couch, Holmes is inflamed and afflicted with dozens upon dozens of itches in need of immediate scratching.
Yet, though he closed his eyes against the travesty before him, this did not stop John Watson from seeing everything in mind's eye. The man's pale eyes partially obscured by waves and waves of dark fringe. His long legs drawn up in coffee-splashed surprise. The frown on a face with the most fantastic cheekbones John has probably ever seen
"That's…great," Sherlock says because he can't think of anything else to say, which is good because it gives John something to say. "So you, uh, you want a ride on my bike then?"
John barked a laugh. "Yes, exactly, that's it, do you see?" More laughter but it sounded like breaking. "I'm a doctor. A nosy doctor who did something he very much shouldn't, who got so curious about the new guy, the so-smart one, the one I thought was beautiful…got so curious that I
John tugged until his scarred shoulder was bare. "For the longest minute of my life I believed in god. I prayed the same words Yvonne did, exactly the same. 'Please god, let me live.' But I'm not elegant like she is, I kept going, a babble of promises, things I would do, wrongs I would right."
Cesare, for his part, was not at all sure this interview was helping him with his essay. This wasn't Mr. Holmes' fault. It was because talking about sex to strangers made Cesare extremely uncomfortable, yet he didn't know how to say, "I think maybe we should stop now. I think maybe I shouldn't be a sex therapist. Also this blush I have feels like it's going to kill me."
Sherlock would later reflect that there was absolutely no way John could have known how many times he'd donned false noses, capes, wigs, and arse-hugging mini-skirts, so there was no reason at all to use the word
So John grabs his new friend's small hand and he pulls him off the bench and he waves to his mum and to the boy's dad and he points at all the park flowers surrounding this little cafe and when mummy and Sherlock's daddy nod their permission he pulls his new friend toward them and he says a crapload of stuff super fast.
That eighth lesson John learned that Sherlock was inclined to ever grander words, gestures and, yes jaw-dropping dresses because he so obviously wanted-needed-yearned for John to
"My name's John," John says, wiping his nose on the back of his hand and sitting down on the little bridge, small feet hanging over the water but not touching.
and so John kept talking and before he shut up they were in Barking for Christ's sake and the tube had long since emptied but neither of them had moved much, neither had stepped away.
Fuck it. John does not want a 'nice' sandwich. He does not want pretty greens with sliced beetroot and English cucumbers and soy-seared salmon god damn it. He wants a fucking savory pie because he has walked half a mile in the Thames and his best shoes have been in a sewer and Regent's canal is a whole lot fucking deeper than it has any right to be, so for dinner they are going to this savory pie shop and they are having piping hot, calorie-dense, wonderful English
Instead John does what he still thinks is delightfully dirty. He pulls out from between Sherlock's long legs and makes little noises while he jerks himself off, coming all over Sherlock's beautiful backside and even pushing his still-coming cock between the cheeks a bit so he can get Sherlock wet.
Mummy took him to A&E, but it was a Saturday night and so they had to wait for a long time, which in the end was fine because that's how five-year-old John Watson met four-year-old Sherlock Holmes.
I also haven't noticed any particular jam flavour favoured in the UK, it seems strawberry, apricot, marmalade, and all the typical flavours you find in the US are popular here as well. You can get jam for super-cheap in the large supermarkets, literally 25 pence for a normal-sized jar. Lemon curd is usually there too.
"I—I…um, wait wait wait." John suddenly stopped dry humping Sherlock. He climbed off the table. Took a step back.
Now John did a little rhythmic samba with his anus. Sometimes the tight-tight-release-tight gets Sherlock off faster and John thought Sherlock needed to get off before he broke either himself or space-time.
Then the man held out his hand. John blinked at it a few times as if near-sighted and then the good doctor took it. Didn't even discuss the matter with his own hand, just
To be sure, John was as drunk as every other man at that outdoor table, but none of the others had twice served under a doctor constitutionally unable to remember the names of anyone, and so called everyone—
When the great big seventy kilo dog opened his giant mouth, John saw so many terrible sharp teeth and such a huge wet tongue, that little Johnny Watson completely lost his shit and screamed—
Then John Watson went to one school, Sherlock Holmes went to another, and over time, time did what it does…filled up with other things.
"Are you blind? You're not even trying and—there, him, the blond? He's attempted to catch your eye half the night. And that woman? Her military kink's nearly as big as she hopes your—"
John smiles that smile again, the one Sherlock will later tell him is angelic, but right now Sherlock doesn't know how to behave around that smile, so he looks out the window again, saying, "Yes."
John turns. The door whispers closed again. Sherlock's still looking at the wood paneled wall and it's to it he speaks. "Why did you thank me?"
Frankly John didn't really understand so he just laid back and spread his legs so he could watch all the action down there, while Sherlock just kept
It's fine, it's all fine. Gentle and steady Mike takes them through dappled light. He's got them. Mike's a good boy. A good,
. Who knows, maybe when it was rainy Sherlock would have walked the two minutes from his flat to go visit Mr. B…
solving the little cases with sherlock would have to be the best few years of johns life. once he was settled into life at 221b, the everyday pace of tea in the morning, cases in the afternoon, and whatever sherlock had set himself to do on that particular day. the rhythm was as comfortable as can be, like john was meant for life with sherlock. when james moriarty was a fleeting thought, a filler task for when sherlock and john weren’t busying themselves with a case or each other. simple life.
he could finally think of sherlock's beautiful, pale body and his long slim fingers padded with callouses from relentless violin playing and remember that man was not rotting in a box six feet under. he is alive. for now, john thinks.
before the fall, before any wives or children or secret sisters, john was almost totally happy for one of the first times in his life. almost. there was always that nagging thought that would remind john of his eternal reality every day: sherlock will never feel the way a real person does. john grew to be content with that fact, to live with it. you can’t change the truth.
after they wheeled him into bart’s, a pool of blood left where sherlock had landed, john had nowhere else to go but back to the flat. he sat alone for a while, in his chair. the flat looked so strange, peaceful, as though sherlock had never left. his violin resting against the mantle, the indent on the seat of his chair, a half finished cuppa on the table, the spy camera sherlock found in the bookcase still resting on the laptop. john imagined that if he left everything undisturbed, sherlock would come waltzing back in, coat swaying, returning from one of his bizarre missions.
shaking in panic and sadness, john slid to the floor, and crawled over to sherlock’s chair. he kneeled in front of it and inhaled deeply, trying to catch his breath, but sherlock’s smell only made him cry harder.
and then there’s john; not exactly his polar opposite but definitely a contrast.  john believes he and sherlock compliment one another to the extent that it makes them, together, tolerable.
sometimes it seems as though everything would have been better if sherlock stayed dead. it’s horrible, john knows, to think that way, and he doesn’t really mean it.
tour will be railway stations and soon I'll do pubs, parks, and shops close to New Scotland Yard. After that KtwoNtwo asked if I could discuss places near 221B that do takeaway/delivery. I shall try! P.S. Read the comments on each of these entries because people have great tips about things mentioned in each chapter!
Woozy with too much whisky John Watson blinked at the tall, slim man wildly gesturing at a big, burly man two pub tables over.
John had no actual answer to give and so he gave none. That was apparently fine by the drunk guy, who suddenly shouted, "I know, I'm Herlock Sholmes!" The outburst caused the man to sway again, this time with less serenity. He employed the wall to help the room stop spinning. "No, wait."
John Watson turned from the bridge railing, blinked himself alert. A dark-haired boy stood a half dozen feet away, wringing his hands. The boy looked simultaneously murderous and terrified.
Licking his lips, John grins at the stranger queuing behind him. He gestures to his own groceries on the chip-and-pin machine. "Do it," he sighs softly to the man.
him and Sherlock wants to talk about the stupid spot on his stupid lung, the one they thought for months was cancer, the one that made him finally stop smoking but sometimes he can't stand it, sometimes, sometimes he just can't breathe unless there's smoke and fire and—
Giving flu jabs was not fulfilling. Explaining the difference between a virus and bacteria vis-à-vis antibiotics left him restless. And so when Mike told him about a part-time position with the Metropolitan Police Service, John quit his small job at a small clinic and took it.
"For eight months Grace told me about your deductions, your mad derring-do, your demands. She told me how you just about dance around crime scenes, how you strut and cock and crow, how
His movement was so sudden his coffee cup swirled on its saucer in a sort of ballet. John watched it in the slow-motion way of one who has enough time to realise something bad is going to happen but does not have time to stop the badness...
Mycroft liked the jam-filled crepes and daddy liked the cream. Usually mummy tried something new and so Sherlock often did, too.
Sherlock, who in circumstances such as this would usually say something cutting because in any situation where he feels a fool Sherlock's too stupid to do anything else and yet, well, this time Sherlock did something new: He giggled. He giggled his head clean off.
The moment the man realises John's not interested his interest evaporates. He sits down hard, scowling. "This isn't half as easy as I thought."
I know it's not the fault of my records, which are meticulous as ever: back garden, 28º north, 45.3º west, well behind Hooper's hyacinth border, left of the snail planter.
John came over just as Mike's dark-haired companion walked off, mobile to his ear, calling back, "Won't be a moment Mike, must berate my brother more directly this time."
Sherlock didn't use to know what that was but he looked it up. Next time John asked his rhetorical question, Sherlock answered. "I think it looks like Ten's sonic, though maybe a bit of the eleventh Doctor's as well." John had got so over-excited he crawled on top of Sherlock right there on that hillside and snogged him senseless. (And yeah, I think the BT Tower most closely resembles the sonic of David Tennant's Doctor Who.)
Maiko Sato Mayfair Jr. (yes, a woman can be junior, something Maiko still explains with more good grace than her friends think reasonable) nodded at her prospective client.
Maybe I'll do an entry here focusing just on the museum. Sherlock could find no end of clues in there I think, and so could
Sherlock put on his scarf and coat and he opened the door. That his trousers were still pooled at his ankles was beside the point...
He hasn't been by since then—was it only last week?—so Sherlock waits. He tries going down to the morgue but they don't let him in any more, so he sits up here and he stares at the little doctor with the easy laugh and the easy smile and he wonders if everything about the man is easy, and then he wonders what would happen if he said that, if he went over there and—
Or in this case a tree. Specifically the one behind which he was currently hiding. From his brother.
"That's good because I did not." Very casually Sherlock placed another palm on the wall, being as the first one hadn't quite done the job. Despite both of these he still listed sideways. "
heterochromia. how strange, john thought, as his eyes graced over the person in front of him. under the harsh lights of the lab, his eyes appeared blue, but when focused on the lens of the microscope, they were a soft green. not extremely uncommon, but still peculiar. one of the many things john noticed when he first met sherlock holmes.
john wanted somebody to love him so much he met a woman to brought him back to normality from depression and within a year decided to marry her.
it was her who rescued him from the depths of his own mind, and spent countless hours as his shoulder to cry on. he owed her at least a ring. and now a baby.
john knows that sherlock packs the capacity of understand the emotions of normal people, but he cannot wrap his brain around why sherlock would ever think it would be a good idea to come back from the dead after two years by disguising himself as a waiter while john was on a date.
it was after the baskerville case, when john really felt it. but he noticed glimpses of it before. in dartmoor, and then back in london, sherlock was changing. it was ever so slight, not even enough for mycroft or lestrade or anyone else to notice. but sherlock was different, there was no mistaking it. he was softer, somehow. in the way he spoke, his movements, and his gazes. all very soft compared to the harsh way he did everything when he first met john. in fact, it was so slight that not even sherlock noticed it himself. but, then again, john thought, sherlock was always so bad at knowing himself. how ironic, a man who reads everyone has such a difficult time reading himself.
the pair had worked so well together in the past that john never dreamed on finding another partner, someone to work with. he could never solve cases without the one and only chance maulting detective.
he shakily lifted the gun to his chin, sobbing in grief as his finger hovered above the trigger. one slip and he’d be gone, and it would all be over. he gasped for air, his heart thumping against his chest.
john tried to work out his decisions logically in his head, and when he decided mary was the one for him, he finally felt close to happy.
he used to spend his time thinking about what life would be like if sherlock had been normal, and come back into johns life calmly and quietly. of course, he knows sherlock could never carry out a silent return; he is far too much of a drama queen.
"Beauty and the Beast". this was the story that seemed to smuggle itself into john's mind whenever sherlock, either sitting at what used to be the kitchen bench using his microscope or lying on the sofa with his eyes closed, the marvelous brain of his working at incredible speed, thoughts going out as quickly as they entered.
in that moment, john cursed the world. cursed sherlock for doing this to himself, to john. cursed those bystanders and first responders for not letting john save sherlock. he just wanted to save him.
but after all, the what makes sherlock sherlock. his quick wit, deaf he’s desuctions, and his never-ending attempts at making a scene.
john had become very accustomed to things being ripped away from him; the temporary loss of use of his leg after the war, every single failed relationship he had whilst living at 221b, he digresses. but he thought all of that was behind him. only smooth sailing ahead. but after witnessing that, the smack of sherlock’s body on the pavement, the sickening snap of his neck, seeing the blood drip down his face as john frantically reached for his wrist, desperate for a pulse.
all john ever wanted was to be loved back by the person he admired most. after the fall, he had no one to hold on to. he was so alone, and felt just like he did before he met sherlock, subtracting the huge hole in his heart.
"yes sherlock?" john's gaze shifted from his laptop to the kitchen, where sherlock was busy at being sherlock.
it hurts to think about the months after the fall. he still feels a twinge of anger towards sherlock whenever he remembers the days and weeks following sherlock's 'suicide'. the empty chair, the stack of papers still pinned to the mantle with a dagger, the skull slowly growing thick with dust as the 221b flat is neglected by a grieving and broken john. each day reserved for a different emotion.
"mike, can I borrow your phone?" john felt a pang in his chest from the moment sherlock spoke, and wondered who this strange man could possibly be. curiosity, formerly hardened by the tragic conquests of war, stretched its arms and blinked its sleepy eyes, as john felt, for the very first time in a long while, butterflies flutter their tissue paper wings in his stomach. the coat, the deductions, that horribly cheeky wink, it all left john feeling quite intrigued. this marked the end of john's conquest in Afghanistan and the beginning of his conquest for sherlock holmes.
If you've wondered what biscuits, tea, jam, or honey John and Sherlock rub onto one another, eat, or otherwise experiment with, wonder no more!
He watches their reunion, then leaves beneath one of the arches and goes out into a somehow-slower city. He smiles at nothing and everything. And he just…walks.
Pushing his bulky body—they'd tried to get him to check his coat—through the crowd, then past a dozen sets of knees, Sherlock at last arrived beside his seat mate.
Sherlock scowled. He was seven and small, but his scowl was already quite a bit bigger than the rest of him. Problem was, the blonde boy wasn't even looking, and it had taken nearly all Sherlock's courage to come over and say the few words he'd already said.
This memorial is a wall of plaques remembering women, men, and children who gave their lives to save others. Many of the people are siblings who died saving a sister or a brother, or young people who put themselves in harm's way so another would live and in that act they themselves died.

like porn so much I don't know, but they do and there are days where they simply tap me on the head and there my hands go, taking dictation.
When his boss had set them up John hadn't thought to ask about his date's rare name. The good doctor's gone out with an Envie, a Bronte, and a Brooklyn, Sherlock hadn't seemed any stranger.
Still, now that he's up close, just about touching it, he's surprised at its delicacy, its warmth, its beauty.
Sure he'd heard about this Holmes guy, another poncy git if the stories were true, a mouthy man who'd second-guess every diagnosis, argue the placement of a plaster each time he came in bruised and bleeding. The thing is, when John asked
. Literally at the tip of the arrows those two things can be found. I'll have you know I risked getting run over by motor vehicles so I could stand in the road to show you how close the park is to John and Sherlock’s home. So if you wish to set any sort of story in Regent’s Park know that the boys could crawl there with utter feasibility. Depending on your kink one of them might actually be crawling so there you go...
And maybe the young constable was never a friend, maybe she never saw him that way. Maybe he doesn't think of
Sherlock toed off a Fratelli Borgioli, placed a long, bare foot in John's hand. The good doctor slipped a black-velvet stiletto on to it, then shod the other foot.
called—"hurry, please please please"—was very aware that seconds are sometimes all that stand between a dead hostage and a living one.
Sherlock never did learn that Mycroft had watched over him that day in the park, nor would he ever know how many times his brother clutched at a bench or a desk edge or an umbrella,
"People forever think the tall wish to be short. They don't. So that beige, kitten-heeled number? Ridiculous. Unless you
All of this was super-okay-fine with John who is a low-key man and who has, since childhood, got off one thousand percent on Sherlock needing him.
I've completely lost sight of the objective. I absolutely can not find where I buried either of those damned thumbs!
And right now, walking away from the body of a wing-wearing man sprawled face-first on the cobblestones, an unfortunately-dead individual in swaddling-cloth, strappy sandals, clutching golden arrows in one hand, and a half-empty quiver in the other, Greg was pretty sure of one thing.
The Thames shore is made up of many things, stones, chalk, bones, sand…and sometimes things that take the breath away. What can you image on that rocky shore?

On six-inch stilettos Sherlock slowly squatted, looked John in the eye. "There's a rather large—" air quotes "—shoe carnival at Selfridges right now. Tell me more about this girlfriend on the way and we'll get you into your sister's good graces."
Sherlock Holmes stepped over the sheet-swaddled corpse, got right on up in his appropriated stranger's face. "All I need are your thoughts on cause of death,
Sometimes Sherlock will, but most times Sherlock just hums back, weaves his fingers through John's hair, and opens wider, whispering, "Fuck, fuck, fuck," until eventually his thighs are shaking as he comes.
While each of those half dozen times came with fine orgasms, none offered the sweetness of slowness, the chance to truly see.
Sherlock's eyes drift closed on the exhale and he counts the heartbeats thrumming away beneath their hands.
Suddenly important parts of Sherlock were very sober. The parts that allowed him to kind of throw himself at John, spin around in something of a ballet move, and drag them both down onto a conference table, where fingers clutched, mouths mashed, suited bodies started to grind.
Sherlock nods again, as if now everything makes sense. With the heady musk of pheromones in the air, actually it feels like everything does.
And yet…he'd grown so weary of talking to the skull that he did a spectacular series of not-good-things until at last he owed his absurdly-patient brother an absurdly large favour. Then, pretending pique, he'd said, "Oh all right, Mycroft. Tell your little opera friend I'll meet her 'enthralling' army doctor. I'm sure he's very
The pub owner answers him again, but Sherlock Holmes doesn't hear her this time either. Doesn't matter, he's already told the woman which employee absconded with the holiday receipts, where the pilfered gin is, and that her girlfriend isn't gay.
Those times John learns the best thing of all. He learns he can fall a bit more in love with his gangly, fluffy-haired love. Just a little, wonderful bit.
In the dark Sherlock nodded. In the dark John wriggled his wrist until he could feel…there it was, a trailing edge of rope. He clutched as much of it as he could with his fingertips and gently tugged.
turned in his seat to look behind him. Then, completely understanding that the parametres of his life had irrevocably changed, John Watson stood and, with nineteenth century manners, murmured his
John Watson went on and on and endlessly on about absolutely nothing—the expense of public transit; the cold; army pensions—because it felt like he hadn't talked to anyone in days, maybe weeks, and now suddenly someone heard him and it didn't matter that the man's interest was physical, it didn't matter John believed himself straight, and it didn't matter that they didn't know each other. What mattered now was that John could see the chest in front of him and John's observant, he is, and so he could see the quick rise and fall of the man's breathing, proof that
Sherlock remembered that day at the build-a-bear workshop, how patient his parents had been at how serious he was about it all. How intently they'd watched Sherlock put his bear together. And how solemn their faces as he pressed Rosie's purple-sparkle heart to his little-boy lips. "I would like a friend please," he'd whispered, "A very best friend please. Thank you."
What did surprise John just now, stretched out on their bed and eyeing Rosie stuffed up on a cobwebby bookshelf corner, was that he'd never asked Sherlock a very important thing about that bear.
Harry shouldered John in the back. He tripped forward and was about to whine his petulance at her—which Captain John Watson does
It was the first time that 'the Holmes guy' would say yes to the army doctor, but it wouldn't be the last. Though he
It ended with their first kiss, their second kiss, and a good old-fashioned feel-up as Sherlock rubbed John's decrepit knees, which had refused to unlock after John had crawled under a table in search of a tiny eyeglass screw.
It was about being eight-years-old and making a promise. It was about being only little and not realising how long some promises take to keep.
As they got to the award for best theme music in an advert of over fifteen seconds but less than thirty, a bored silly John wandered toward the dark-haired man, ready to strike up a conversation.
Head bowed, shoulders shaking, silent but for the gentlest sobbing, he made every effort to respond, but due to the profoundly unfamiliar thing happening between his legs, he was simply incapable.
Sherlock talks to himself often. He answers, too. What you'll hear him say depends on when you eavesdrop.
However, the thing for which she'd be most proud, a dozen years hence, would be an award-winning, two-part documentary about a detecting duo she met at a little awards ceremony one long ago night in east London.
At this point the cells in John's body are moving so quickly he can almost feel his fingernails growing and his wisdom teeth coming in. He vibrates at Sherlock to share these facts and Sherlock does a thing.
He liked it when grandmum laughed so he'd usually do both arms and puff out his chest too, which made her absolutely howl. It wasn't until dozens of years later that John realised his grandmother was pushing those rocks out of place on purpose. So that they could laugh. The thing is, when John realised this he cried. Sherlock had held him and asked him why.
Actually he notices much more than that. The flex of hip and thigh as John guides the horse with subtle pressure. He feels the puffs of breath when the man murmurs words surely the horse can't hear and yet seems to and—like Mike—Sherlock relaxes when John reassures, "It's fine, it's good, such a good,
Before they each went in different directions John said, "There's something strange about your bear."
Though the grave before which he now stands is not sad in the conventional sense. It's well-cared for and beautiful, a fine monument to William Tyler, a man who, like John, did his duty and, like John, was shot in the doing of it.
been right about that—seemed to grow six inches. "Listen, you over-pretty little shit, the DI has no claim on that skull and no right to give it to anyone and I'm betting he never even said that and even if he did you're not getting it. She's mine, she's been mine for a long time now, and you'll have to pry her from my cold, dead hands before you have her."
John started to say something, but the man had already dropped the shoe and moved to a display of stilettos. John followed.
"Your hair," said John, looking up into pretty sloe eyes, his heart going skittery-thump, "is kind of floofy."
When they arrived at seven sharp, John asked the good doctor to stay for a cuppa, but Michael Stamford's no fool. He doesn't need a stethoscope to know when two hearts are beating fast.
Eventually he was assigned to the Met's Westminster borough. There, in the heart of the city, things picked up. Sometimes he saw officers who'd suffered an interesting sprain, a scrape, a bruise. More times he saw officers who needed an ear, or encouragement, or just a moment to breathe. Before he knew it, John felt relevant again, of use. Whatever he'd missed, he'd finally found it.
Hands shoved in coat pockets as he leaves the party, he glides toward the Shard's 62nd-floor lift. He's already phrasing his altruistic
A breeze that does a little samba over those blooms sure, setting them to dancing, but a breeze that also gusts over the five empty tables around little Mr Watson, bringing him not the scent of blossoms but of
John gets it, he does, because John's good at snap judgments, at understanding the gravity of any given moment. And so the doctor knows the man isn't high or drunk, he's just one thing: Hungry.
For Sherlock Holmes, before there was Baker Street, there was Montague Street. Says the good detective in
Later the boys of Baker Street celebrated the closed case over a curry at Angelo's. In the middle of the table lay a bouquet of foxgloves, daffodils, and irises, Sherlock's gift to John. Because nothing says
John Watson held his breath. He succeeded in not looking the man up and down, in not letting his gaze roam to plunging neckline, lacquered nails, the curve-following fit of the dress.
Both men turn. One pales, the other flushes. The pale one stares a long surprised moment at John Watson, then at the caramels, then at Sherlock. He does these things twice before finally mumbling, "I have to…I just remembered…I'm really sorry."
But John didn't. John doesn't. Because he learned fast that if he wrote letters to the men and women he left behind they'd contain nothing but the breathless refrain:
No. No. And no. What John Watson reflected on just then was that he was absolutely thrilled it was so cold that even inside the heated car he was still wearing an over-sized winter coat. A coat that just about reached his knees and so hid one mother of a surprising erection. Correction: It hid the erection that surprised him. John completed this reflection by acknowledging he hadn't intended his day to go in precisely this direction.
Mycroft checked his watch. That reminded him, it was time for Sherlock's literature tutorial. With any luck his little brother wasn't still angry about this afternoon's small contretemps vis-à-vis the cinema. He could be such a petulant creature sometimes.
The stranger shuffled round a bit on his knees, sat back on his haunches and Sherlock saw that the man with the nice teeth and big blue eyes, he also had at least four sorts of blond in his hair.
When mum left him at grandmum's and grandmum was busy doing other things, John would patrol the back garden and tidy things. He'd been taught how to deadhead roses and so he'd do that. And he'd gather up some of the fallen leaves from the hydrangeas, and he'd shift the rocks until they were just, just
"Yeah it is. The drinks are fantastic, the girls even better, and the decor—" Here Harry raised eyebrows toward the reclining man. "—leaves very little to be desired."
"I'll come back," they'd whispered to each other, foreheads pressed together that long-ago afternoon, before Sherlock moved away. "Promise."
Currently made up of mostly growth-spurt arms, Sherlock threw himself forward and used those lengthy limbs to smack all the flowers out of John's hands. He then step-tripped backward and started to cry.
asked me to come so I could be your wingman and…and…" Greg remembers exactly what Sherlock had said, but he wants to make him say it again.
London is no battlefield but when John Watson sees one man in a fireman's carry over another's gore-red shoulder his response is immediate: Stop the bleeding.
John pushes him to his knees, then his back, lays his other hand on the man's chest. "Look. Look at my hand. Do you see it? Make it go up. Do that for me, make my hand go up. Slow. Slow."
John Watson's eyes shifted back and forth fast. His sister does this to him. She always does this to him. She plays word games. No, not games,
Though the long years would garner him the data he'd originally craved—no one is immune to grief or disappointment—it turned out that in the end Sherlock had to make do mostly with love's pleasanter aspects—contentment, lust, joy. Which was fine really. In the end it was these that made him better, much better, at what he did.
(and yes, that red circle is Baker Street; you can see much bigger images of what's mentioned here on
Sherlock smiles big and, leaning toward his new friend, Sherlock bows his head and pipes, "Want to touch it?"
Still, the DI does love a puzzle and so eventually there was a baker, a beekeeper (that had a promising five minutes), another coroner, and an undertaker. There was an older man, a younger woman, an older woman, twins (one of each), two detective constables, and a chemist.
Sherlock was instantly entranced and mortified. He hiccupped himself to quiet weeping and tried to explain. "They're only little and y–you w-were mean!"
Sherlock sits and stares at the little doctor with the easy laugh and the easy smile, and he wonders if everything about the man is easy, then he wonders what would happen if he said that, if he went over there and...
John couldn't tell who was yelling because, as the woman outside had implied, the place was crawling with cops and John was one body among far too many.
He says I can't drive, which is entirely news to me as I've had my licence since I was ten years old. [No you haven't Sherlock.]
Two men ordinarily quite uppity in their own self-regard stand there like awkward idiots. The less idiotic apologises first.
Sherlock doesn't reach for the man's extended hand. Instead he stares at John's shoes, then his ears, then out the window. "You didn't know."
The view from on top of the hill is wide and lovely during the day, showing you a broad swathe of south London, but it's at night when the city shows to its glittering advantage.
"Where does it hurt," he asks because, though he can see where it hurt—the man's fists are pressed against belly and chest—the asking helps a person focus on something
Sherlock leans forward as if to get out of that magically appearing chair and he frowns and blinks and opens his mouth from which a tongue pushes, and he huffs and puffs a couple times and he mutters a thing and then another thing and at this point John's come in close and it takes some effort, some focus and careful listening, but eventually John hears what the man's mumbling soft and careful, as if the language is new and sweet and strange.
Finally he says, "Friends…help one another. They have faith in each other, protect each other. If they're good friends, they change everything."
John rushes back to Holmes' bed, tugging a tissue from a box on his way. He calms the furiously beeping machine and says in a rush, "Pleasesqueezethebanana! Where!"
Right, after checking his watch Greg may go to the post office. If your Greg has kids or siblings or
That was precisely when John took Sherlock's wrist and tugged him from the hotel banquet room, down the hall, down another hall, and then randomly through the first unlocked door he found.
is probably not what he's going to say—but he never does find out because Sherlock talks for him. And for his brother. And probably for god and his twelve apostles, who the hell knows?
Through the window both men see Johnny bang down his beer glass again, heading toward the door. "Your boyfriend's coming to claim you."
The young detective frowned, wide-eyed. "There are six hundred self-storage companies in greater London.
"When we went to the bear shop to make her they had all these things you could pick for eyes and heads and clothes and stuff and they also had these hearts you put inside with your secrets. The prettiest one was this sparkly yellow heart with orange on the edges that looked just like the roses that daddy grows for mummy. But I think mummy gets, um, mucus when she smells them but she won't tell daddy because she doesn't want him to be sad that they make her feel that way and so that's why she's called Rosie."
John Watson batted at the air, as if at vexing dandelion fluff. "What I'm trying to say is I got on my knees on pavement to pet him and then I couldn't get up. Well clearly I could because I'm here and not still there, but my knees is what I'm trying to say. My knees had done something and I don't even know what, I just know that I needed to put my hands on pavement with spilled cola and nasty gum and push my way up, arse in the air like a toddler, and what I'm trying to say in the most painfully round-about-fashion possible is welcome to getting older, a boon not given to as many humans as might want it and so aren't we lucky?" The stranger with the lovely hair and the blue eyes and the nice shoulders didn't wait for a reply, just went ahead and said brusquely, "We are lucky, trust me, I know. And here's the other thing I know: We can complain or we can kick arse, those are our choices."
Sherlock slid right on down, nuzzled with that nose at the top of John's arse, then dabbed his tongue on a freckle at the plump swell of John's left cheek.
Sherlock Holmes stands at a dusty window and stares out at tarmac, grass, and aeroplanes all faded in the Kabul sun.
This was the third studio he'd come to and he'd have gone to a fourth and a fifth until he didn't see someone slyly narrow their eyes, until he didn't notice a flaring of nostrils as if something smelled bad, until he found a place that didn't care he was the best man at the wedding of two men.
What really happened was they tussled for a good twenty seconds. There was a lot of teeth clenching and jabby fingers annoying grippy ones. Then, when he finally heard himself grunting his swears, John Watson yelled, "Fine!" and let go, and the not-really-a-driving-instructor shouted back, "Okay!" They both sat back hard with jaw muscles twitching and chests heaving and now the windows were fogged up and because Sherlock Holmes just now realised that John Watson's hair smelled really, really good and the man had very strong hands and a deep-voiced way about him when he was cursing, Sherlock sublimated a whole raft of confusing emotions by shouting, "And you failed the driving test!"
Sherlock took a deep breath and at last committed to this stranger, plopping his butt onto the lawn. It was here that the universe, which has always and
Sherlock says what he's thinking, like he always does. "You belong to a gay, left-handed biker group?"
But the short man's piping-hot mocha latte at last stopped spinning and plunged to the floor—splashing smartly over both of Sherlock's seven hundred pound Tom Ford monk-strap brogues—and the contents of the saucer that had been under John's coffee cup, now ever so full of slightly-cooler latte, landed in the lap of Sherlock's Spencer Hart suit.
So when John's mum comes back to their table with a tiny dark-haired boy beside her and says a bunch of stuff to him about "son of a friend's friend" "play together" and "do you need anything?" John's young nervous system is entirely too overloaded to do anything but allow for blinking and vague nods.
For his part Sherlock took his time coming back not because he needed the skull for as long as all that but because he'd deduced a whole lot of things about the short, angry doctor in their unusual acquaintance and he knew the doctor needed time to deduce those things about himself.
Sherlock shrugged his forgiveness and after introductions on both sides, including names, the schools they attended, where they lived, how many siblings they had, which movies they liked, how fast they could run, what they wanted for Christmas, what crepes they liked, which ice cream flavour was best, and how big the dog had been—"really fucking big!"—and then some giggling about the naughtiness of swear words, Sherlock held out his hand, John took it and, their small frames counter-balancing so naturally that neither boy stumbled, both boys stood.
He pissed again, flashed a post-case grin in the mirror, bounced on his toes. He strode into the bedroom, hands on his hips. Another case closed! Another foe vanquished! Another—
After the pub closes the bartender opens the cubbies. He finds in each a single serviette. On every one, the same two words.
Afterward he holds Sherlock close against his chest. It's been a long day spent saving the world and they need to rest before it starts up all over again. So John pets Sherlock and whispers, "Must sleep, Sherlock. Must sleep."
"I fell off my bithycle and hit my head on the kerb," he said, lispy-tired. "So I have to thtay up until they make sure I'm not having a concussion."
For a man on his knees, the good doctor was awfully light-headed. He swayed woozily, reflexively clutched the man's fancy trousers, then squealed.
Twelve hours and three minutes later Sherlock Holmes appeared suddenly beside him and they both walked out the Met's double doors.
Or there was the time Sherlock briefly lost every deductive capability he had and was so sure John secretly hated his fiftieth birthday gift of a dozen different sorts of haggis—"In honour of your Scottish heritage John!"—that Sherlock actually got nervous hiccoughs and had to put his head down between his knees.
He may not have a living one, but Sherlock thinks that probably qualifies the young woman as a friend, though they spoke just one time when she was alive.
John stepped closer. "A four-year-old old kicked me in the bollocks this morning. I'd love an excuse to vent some pent-up irritation."
Despite intensive study, despite interrogating Lestrade—who'd forbidden him to speak of the blackmarket porn case in words of more than one syllable (amazing how constraining such a restriction was on questions of a sexual nature)—Sherlock was no closer to understanding two critical case points. Okay, four points. Maybe six.
"DI…what? Come again? No, I know what chicken feathers are, what the hell is a Fresnel lens? Oh, that's no problem, I've already said they can have everything they ask for. No I'm not angry."
The point is that John was already in a confused snit by the time the instructor held out a long-fingered hand with perfectly manicured nails, so John just cleared his throat aggressively, shoved his hands in his pockets, and said, "Right. Let's get this over with."
John's heard just about everything at these events. From toe-curling lies to heart-palpitating candour, he's watched lonely people move from table to table, trying to change their voices, their expressions, their
The second time was pretty much the same, because this time an interminable red signal on the tube meant John was thirty minutes late.
The stranger placed his palms flat on pristine floor tiles and his attractive rump in the air. "I'm—shit, my knees are so fucked—John Watson." John of the fucked knees grunted himself vertical. "Sorry, that last bit's my name, not the rest. The rest is just me being on some sort of fucking pilgrimage to decrepitude. I solve, uh, I guess I solve diarrhea and lingering coughs. I'm a doctor and I'm generally more cheerful than my swearing might imply." John Watson held out a hand. "What sort of murders?"
Sherlock pretended a disinterest he didn't feel. Central London would put him much closer to Scotland Yard than Mycroft's ridiculous Kew Gardens 'bungalow,' and he'd stop feeling like he owed his brother something. Before Sherlock could drop his indifference in the form of a flood of questions, the cocky little doctor continued.
home. So every afternoon the fourteen-year-old boy brought back a dozen heavy books, curiosity, and questions.

However, unlike Sherlock, Mycroft would not call himself stubborn. Capable of finding the perfect path toward a goal, yes, focused, yes. Just as he believes his bright brother should be vis-à-vis studying for his GCSE exams.
because John heard that deep-voiced purr loud and clear and that made heat rise, incandescent, up his neck and down between his legs.

Having said that, right now NSY is where it's been for nearly half a century so here's what's close to it, here are the things Greg Lestrade sees and, one hopes, enjoys. Like a sandwich at Gregg's, or a stroll in the park with the British government.

wide, admiring, and he says softly, as if right against Sherlock's ear, "It's against every human instinct to let ourselves be hurt, it takes so much bravery to calmly walk into that kind of suffering."
So if he tries telling the man his date's about to excuse herself to the ladies and leave through the back door with his wallet, Sherlock knows somehow he'll say
Sherlock Holmes' eyes dart from the woman's frothy hair to her heels. "She's coiffed to perfection and her shoes are inopportune for dancing."
That ship has long since sailed (ha, another pun!), though I'm still friends with him and his husband John of course. Currently. As of today. I don't know if that'll be the situation tomorrow because it's Sherlock who's taught me I can actually want to eviscerate someone. Someone who–
Because Sherlock Holmes will not define himself as gay. Or straight. Or asexual, bisexual, or any mixture, animal, vegetable, mineral. He…he's a Schrödinger's box of sexuality, neither opened nor closed, in a state of forever being anything, everything, or nothing and, and, and
No, in that narrow aisle Sherlock did what Sherlock does: Exactly what he wanted. And what he wanted was to stare down at his sandy-haired seat mate and flick-flick-flick past the obvious—military, doctor, alone—to observe the less obvious: This small, silent man thrived under fire. Under metaphorical fire, under literal fire, under battlefield conditions that threatened soul and safety.
And that thing is jerk off into a small vessel, so that the result can be frozen against the day there is not a sufficiency of Holmeses (being as some believe the two currently residing in London are twice more than enough, this problem seems somewhat manufactured).
until he's woozy with the scent of pipe tobacco and cigars. But it still isn't helping. This time it doesn't
Sherlock smiles when he spots a tiny black woman approaching. He knows she looks for the loud talker, he knows at a glance they're lovers. Two colours, one gender, and when this station was built they could never have been who they are to one another, but Sherlock's city has changed, and she'll change again and again and again.
Then, bowing once more over his careful work, Sherlock Holmes said, "I'm sure you know she was also seeing another doctor in the practice, that they just got back from a holiday to New Zealand and are contemplating being exclusive, and that she was less than keen on your taste in clothes, cologne, and hair style. This was likely the first in a progressive series of personal…upgrades."
No, all Sherlock Holmes notices is the measured breathing behind him, the sweet smell of it (apples, the man's breath smells of summer apples), the hand gently holding him steady.
"See you at seven. Mike'll bring you round?" Mike nodded and with that John Watson swaggered away. Sherlock blinked, jaw slightly unhinged. He had the distinct feeling he'd been standing in a very small, very sexy hurricane.
Greg squints owlishly at the dance floor. He doesn't giggle. No instead he breaks into a cold sweat. "With you? I'm…we're…"
Right about this point John should have tugged his shirt back up, hidden his scars away again, but he didn't. And that? That more than anything is what changed everything.
It doesn't take any kind of genius to understand what Sherlock's not saying, so John says it for him. "So you exposed yourself, because you're allergic to kapok, too."
I am sure mileage on all of this information varies, I'm just sharing what I've experienced in my three years living here. If you have questions, do let me know, but you can also make up the most special tea or jam or honey you like! There are more than these four supermarkets, they just happen to be the chains most often seen in London. I'm certain you could find all kinds of lovely, rare things in other shops so feel free to invent!
"What!" Lestrade closed his eyes in contrition. He micronapped for three seconds. He woke in time to hear PC Ahuja murmuring soothing sounds to the new constable. She must have taken the phone.
Foregoing the benches to sit on the grass, John'll point out things that are so obvious as to be pedantic, yet he does it every time and every time Sherlock—who sits behind him, arms wrapped tight around John's waist—nods and says softly, "What else?"
was not his fault that sunshine makes him sleepy and, after being in bed for three days, he was awfully tired of being sleepy.
Six hours later the barista goes about the business of closing the shop up around them. She brings them a bit of cake first. They try to pay. She doesn't let them.
"You wouldn't tell us why you're here, not last week, not the weeks before." John started unbuttoning his shirt. "I thought it must be awful, what happened to you, because you've been so awful to us."
"Mind you I do a lot of locum work on the side, so I keep odd hours. I like a pint now and again, too. And I do date a fair bit." John took the stethoscope Mike had finally dug from his cavernous bag, donned it in a way that could only be described as
Turns out he didn't actually, not until John grunted and started to come. That's when John's hole clenched around his tongue. When blood blushed John's skin, raising the hot scent of sex. That's when wonderful and necessary became what they would be from this day on:
with all of the buzz around sherlock’s fraud, john knew there would be that one arsehole who would deface the grave. john had failed before, and wanted to stay and protect, but he knew that no matter what he did, sherlock would not be coming back. so he left, only returning once more with mrs hudson so she could pay her respects and so john could say goodbye one last time.
the new warmth john found between himself and sherlock gave him a feeling of hope he had been lacking for far too long. the war stole away all hope he had before, and his failed attempts that dating and reintroducing himself back into society as the man he was before only reinforced johns feeling of utter hopelessness. but then there was sherlock holmes. proud, cocky, and indestructible.
the funeral was three days later. it was quiet, and john figured that with the amount of people who hated sherlock for his alleged fraud, there wouldn’t be much attendance. but lestrade came, as did mycroft and molly hooper. mrs hudson was a wreck when she found out, and told john she would visit the grave at a later date when she wasn’t as broken down. john understood.
tale as old as time, he supposed. it certainly was. though told countless times before, john found himself living within the famous story. there he was, a gruff little soldier with nothing but an empty blog and psychosomatic limp, and the magnificent creature that was sherlock holmes. tall, dark haired, and majestic as he seemed to float from space to space, mind solving every problem he comes across. beauty and the beast. john was struck in awe at first, unable to figure out the inner workings of sherlock's impossible head,but he eventually grew used to sherlock's day-to-day sessions of violin, silence, tea, research, and so on. normal life. ha, john thought. no such thing when you're flat mates with sherlock holmes.
The two doctors caught up briefly, made plans for dinner. By the time Sherlock's 'moment' was over, John was long gone.
John and Sherlock would see each other over the years, at one another's birthdays, occasionally on summer breaks, but by the time the boys were thirteen each had become a bit of who he would later be: John more studious, serious, and popular; Sherlock more ethereal, abstract, and alone.
Because even while they ate, every few minutes some adult would duck through the door of the crêperie and ask, "Has anyone seen a little blond boy? His name is John and he was scared and someone saw him running this way but no one can find him."
So. This completes our brief tour of the shops near Baker Street. Please feel free to use any of these images or anything I've said here in your own stories. And I'm happy to take requests for where to follow our boys next in London.
After awhile the boys stretched back onto the grass and chattered about nothing much. Eventually it was time to go back inside.
Sherlock clenches his jaw. He contemplates opening the door with his fist wrapped around his prick. He does not do this. Instead he puts on his scarf and his coat and he opens the door. That his trousers are still pooled at his ankles registers instantly to the short doctor standing there. The man steps inside quietly—
John rose, swayed, then stilled himself with an index finger to the tall man's chest. "Imagine I said that without shouting. Or swearing. Or calling you…" John looked to the left, as if the word he needed was—
Leaning close to her friend and giggling, as if suddenly tipsy, Bethany said softly, "But I sort of wrote a few things. About what I imagine they did after that kiss. Do you want to
"He's not…" John sighs. Grinds his teeth. Starts walking. After a moment he hears the click of the man's heels going the other way. Once out of sight of the pub John's unsurprised to find the man beside him again.
The man who remains, the one with the faint flush, looks at John Watson and realises three things. John Watson has been here the whole time. He's heard everything. And certainly he thinks Sherlock Holmes is a dick.
And in the middle of the street, in the middle of these thousands, stands Sherlock Holmes, not moving. Staring.
Sherlock frowns, puts the wallet down, steps back…and sits hard in a chair that wasn't there before.
For the next little while they potter the tiny garden hand-in-hand, Sherlock excitedly explaining the dread poisons to be found in daffodils, foxgloves, and irises and John—who has been reading
Though he really didn't have the temperament for it, Cesare would have made a good therapist. Because Cesare realised something lovely was happening just then, and that something didn't include him. He also realised that if he made a break for it now, they probably wouldn't notice.
John clears his throat. John clears his throat a second time. Still and all his voice is a bit croaky when he reaches a hand up to Sherlock and says, "Let's keep riding awhile."
He looked at his pinkie and it was dotted with red marks and already hurting. It hurt too much to cry so John just clutched it close and rocked and rocked.
Greg turned. "The bloke in the white coat? That's Chris's ex." Momentary rumination. "They stayed friends though, which is really kind of ni—"

business, but before he knows what he's done he's blurted it out and so no, just no, he would not fall for that again.
It wasn't until a dreadfully dull two hours in—and they'd only just got to best supporting production assistant to the executive editing producer or something similar—that John noticed the dark-haired man circling the edges of the gathering.
Sherlock's gaze slicked past John. His grin faded. He went dead-eyed. He dropped John's hand, stood, and walked away.
He giggled at his caffeinated crotch and giggled at his mocha latte'd shoes and then he did the thing John will say was the second best thing he ever did: He looked up and he giggled
Though it's a bit of a solemn place, do make a point of seeing it if you can. It's lovely and worth a bit of time so that you can appreciate that sometimes people do extraordinary things for each other.
Sherlock curled lower, crossed his little legs tighter and sniffled against his stuffed bear's heart place. "It's okay," he told her.
John's breathing heavier than any of this warrants and he realises he's being a dick, dumping his own frustrations onto a stranger who doesn't owe him shit. He blows out an exasperated breath and says, "Well. Right. I am…so sorry."
Sometimes it's palm pressed against palm on a restaurant table while they bicker about the basics of a case.
But right now John was kind of woozy with his disbelief so he whispered, "Your brother should be sorry."
John seems to think about his answer, then shrugs. "Sorry. I didn't mean to test you." Before Sherlock can say anything, John does. "Okay, I did. But I have one more."
John went and sat back down then but, as if they were connected already, satellites bound tight in orbit around one another, Sherlock followed and stood in front of John's chair.
This concludes our short little tour of Regent's Park as it relates to 221B. If you want a super large map of the Park, so you can get the names of places right, here is
They both narrowed their eyes. For a good ten seconds each man was pretty sure this has gone oddly pear-shaped and probably they should just be on their way. Then, of all the words in all the world that Sherlock could say just then, he said the only ones which would have intrigued.
The man smiles down at him, all teeth and curls. John's cheeks go hot and already he's lost his train of thought. The ill-tempered thud of Johnny's beer glass focuses him fast.
Sherlock's brief joy at the admiration is tempered to resignation, because here it comes. After Sherlock does his Sherlock thing, he's grown used to thank yous that aren't, thank yous that ignore what he just did by asking him to do more, but that's not what he gets now.
the killer, it's what he did when he was ten and one kid punched him so badly he couldn't breathe, it's what he will do every single time his mouth or his brain or his
Maybe that promise was why John returned to London after Afghanistan. Maybe it was why Sherlock turned down that perfect job offer in Paris.
Maureen Vernet knew that this bit of exotic fruit also cost six pounds, and that there was a seventy percent chance her picky child would take one sniff of the sliced thing and pronounce it either indigestible, unpalatable, revolting or, his current favourite, "Poithonouth." Sherlock might be only four but his feelings were much larger than the vessel in which they were contained.
And suddenly John understands that the man is lying. And why. He glances toward the ladies and plops back into the booth with an "Oh shit."
Sure enough it wasn't even five minutes before he saw a wood ladder nailed to the side of a single-storey nail salon, and with just a glance at mummy Sherlock ran to it, and clambered up, up, up.
Sherlock grinned down into his plum wine. He was pretty sure he adored plum wine. Plum wine intrigued him. Plum wine excited him. Plum wine was interesting and tiny and stroppy and made him want to…made him want to…made him
—scowled. Ordinarily John was perfectly content working graveyard shift in St. Mary's morgue. Despite being wildly over-qualified, despite spending most long nights alone with a tiny TV and his own moods, John often sometimes somewhat almost actually
What was here was Sherlock's craving to be not-bored. So he decided to help a boy figure out his path in life—Cesare would quit his degree next term and happily go on to be middle management at HMV—and to liven up the day of a man whose mocha latte was its high point.
So a few folks asked what sort of shops are near 221B Baker Street…where might John and Sherlock shop? Get laundry done? Have a pint? Here are the real-life things near 221B Baker Street. Hope they help with scene-setting for your own
Sherlock buys them sandwiches which contain a filling neither can identify but it tastes of fish and smells like pineapple.
did it some more. This time with open legs. John cleared his throat so sharply he got saliva in his sinuses, then sneezed so hard his ears popped.
"I'm sorry," Sherlock said. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry," he said again and he kept saying it and they let him keep saying it and saying it until he ran out of pain to fuel him, then ran out of arrogance to protect him, until he could finally
that by the time John turned away in a huff and got in the car he forgot why he was there until he was buckling up in the
As if it was feeling left out, Sherlock's half-empty coffee mug tipped over for no reason whatsoever and joined the mocha latte all over everything.
John tentatively opened his mouth, then waited. All Sherlock did was list left a little more. John waited a little more.
Sometimes John wonders what would've happened if he hadn't stopped for coffee that day. If he hadn't seen a stranger trembling. If he'd kept quiet like he told himself to do.
John nods, pulls into himself in a way no one ever sees because no one sees the doctor who saves them, not really. And it's fine, it's all fine, John understands that people need plausible deniability of their own fragility.
It was blissful-warm beneath the duvet. Sherlock's cold toes sang an ode. Then John sang one when Sherlock discovered his morning wood and wriggled deep to get at it.
assuming you're a bit dim or extremely unobservant, I'll let you in on a secret mister: The tube's crowded today. Do you see? Can you see?"
Mr Gentle Hands is nice though. When Mr Fast Talk comes to borrow me so we can all go sniffing along the river or in the woods to find crime, Mr Gentle Hands calls me a
John looks at his mum. His mum's peripheral vision is quite good and so she catches this gaze, returns it, and freights it with a blown kiss. A low-key kid with a stack of books in front of him and the remnant of some sniffles, John does a little finger wave back, and he pretends to read his book for a second but…
And, sat under a shade tree a few dozen feet away, Mycroft Holmes echoed those grins. Slowly he withdrew the fingers he'd tight-clutched into the iron lace of his park bench.
Sherlock Holmes would not define himself as gay. Or straight. Or asexual, bisexual, or any mixture, animal, vegetable, mineral.
Madam was saved from relationship fraud by the insistent purr of the deep-voiced technician. "The curtains at your left will take you to…"
But Sherlock doesn't look up and John doesn't come back and so Sherlock reaches for a fresh pile of napkins and Sherlock writes and writes some more and then, chin to chest, he goes to the card catalogue and puts a note into every one of the four dozen drawers and a pretty patron nearby says something witty but he doesn't look up, Sherlock doesn't look up, he goes to the pub window and he counts his breaths and he doesn't look up.
, which is a tiny wood-paneled museum with a very Victorian aesthetic. About one minute from Montague Street, it's full to the rafters with stuffed old creatures, things in jars, and the mezzanine—which visitors can't reach but can see—has skeletons leaning over the railing looking down at you (see the photo!). The museum is free and I have this idea that if enough bored Sherlock would wander its small space peering into the many, many specimen jars—including the lion's mane jellyfish.
often as it does to Sherlock, but sometimes the grey weather gets down into John's bones and he feels a weird sort of fatalistic. Words won't work in that instance, so they go to the hill and looking out over things, well for some reason it sets John right.
Apparently proximity wasn't necessary for continued conversation however, for the man added, "Though not all men find prostate stimulation stimulating of course."
Then they waited until the barista was done serving two fitness teachers four espressos before asking the man for a damp cloth.
When Sherlock's consulting mess drives John round the giddy bend, or flames force them both to decamp to more alcoholic pastures, the nearest pub to 221B is The Volunteer. See those flower bedecked windows to the left of the pub? That's 221B. To get a sense of The Volunteer's take on
No, suddenly something was very near and warm and smelt of liquorice and righteous indignation. That something was blue-eyed, squirmy tongued, and
Maiko Mayfair is a dancer right down to her DNA. She knows how to move. She is no one's obstacle. "How sweet your friends found one another. May I ask their names?"
Mike nodded, reflected that it was odd to say 'great' when talking about a killer, but that was Sherlock Holmes for you. He hadn't known the man long, but the poisoning case had gone on for weeks and they'd ended up sitting around a lab, talking into a few long nights, waiting for test results. He was a rare bird, this Holmes, a good heart in there, underneath the scowling armour.
Before John could ask who or where the man swooped away and, for the very first time but not the last, Dr. Watson ran after Mr. Holmes.
He'd seen Sherlock's jutting chin and hesitant march, saw the blonde boy and ducks in the near distance, and Mycroft knew what his little brother was about to do. He had almost risen, followed. He had wanted to, started to, he—no.
And when he finally said, "Seriously Sherlock, what the fuck?" Greg was flattered when Sherlock explained. Look, he may want to punch the man as often as praise him, but the git's good-looking, brainy, and has a certain charm if you squint hard and feign deafness.
dragged around, sometimes literally, john secretly enjoyed sherlock taking him on cases, just as so sherlock enjoyed little john trying to unravel every seemingly and increasingly impossible case the pair encountered. after all, where would he be without his blogger. john's incessant documenting of their many adventures brought sherlock a great sense of satisfaction. the baker street duo were perfectly, though quietly, content with one another. however, all great things must come to an end.
“john.” john gave no reply, only staring stony-faced at sherlock’s empty chair. he rested his cheek on his hand.
he never understood what sherlock gained from these small and trivial  bits of conversation they shared every day, but then again, who knows what sherlock goes on about while john is out.
john never once slipped, never let his affections truly show in the way he wished to express them. rather than wake him up with a kiss on the forehead and a steaming cuppa, he glimpsed up from the morning paper to briefly remind sherlock that mrs. hudson had left breakfast on the table. it was enough. it had to be enough. he understood sherlock could not return his feelings. he knew the man he was, and sociopath or not; sherlock was incapable of romantic love. it was not an insult, nor a fault; simply a fact john knew.
sherlock is eradic, his behavior unpredictable and impulsive, not able to distinguish a good plan from a horrible decision. but it always is these small quirks about a person that makes everyone who loves them love them so much. they’re not pet peeves, but quite the opposite. the little things a person does that makes you smile, not resent them for it. it was the same for sherlock; the way john would stop and think things through, scold sherlock for behaving inappropriately in a situation without treating him like a child. the little things.
he couldn’t return to the flat, it was too painful, so lestrade invited him to stay at his house, but after a week john knew he was overstaying his welcome and found a new, smaller flat for just him.
darkness. john had never known sadness like this before. sadness was a stranger. the grief he felt for those lost in the war was nothing. his feelings were indescribable. john had always been in touch with his feelings, at least reasonably in touch. but with all of these unfamiliar emotions, for the very first time john felt like sherlock. oblivious to himself, only observing life around him.
whether it’s playing roulette with a serial killer, taunting a psychopath, or faking his own death, sherlock always has to have the upper hand, and always has to have the last word.
sometimes, john would find himself standing at sherlock's grave at 5 am, silent tears rolling down his cheeks as the sun rose.
others he found himself standing in the heart of the flat, tempting to go reaching for his gun and putting himself out of his misery, as his heart ached for sherlock to return. to not be dead.
My, what a perfect pair. One brings he other up, which the other brings one down. perfect coexistence. before the fall.
john struggled so much after the fall, but he moved on with his life, as all must do in the wake of a tragedy. but then sherlock comes along and messes up johns life all over again.
john never knew why exactly he was so drawn to mary. sherlock had informed him so matter-of-factly that it was because she was the the way she is.
"normal people don't run around chasing after criminals and psychopaths with their best friend who happens to be a sociopath. normal people find spouses, have children, work the 9 to 5."
John's mum has a lot of friends. Because Madeleine Hamlyn Watson is that perfect balance of inquisitive and conversational. She listens, she talks, then she listens again. There is no one who walks past Maddy who doesn't stop to chat.
Greg looks up. Breaks into an entirely different cold sweat. He instinctively wants to decline but he's blushing too hard to remember how, so he stands. After a confusing moment involving how to step around each other, Greg follows the man to the dance floor.
From the man's averted gaze and the speed at which he rapid-fired his monologue, John's pretty sure Sherlock just asked him out.
After a few minutes of saying, "No, we haven't seen him," mummy and daddy decided it was time to help look, so Mycroft went with daddy and Sherlock with mummy and they began searching for the little lost boy.
At Sherlock's muttered name, John grins, taps his guest's right arm. "So now, take hold of his mane here. Yes, just like that, then pull and step…yes that's good, now up you go!"
John smiles to himself. If he'd been fractious, very gloomy with his important four-year-old problems, the scent of his grandfather's pipe smoke always soothed him.
The tenth kiss was disqualified when the kisser growled low, the eleventh likewise because the man couldn't stop giggling.
A pretty one, yes, but this is London and let's be frank: it's loaded with posh pretty. Young men in suits snug-perfect, others gone Goth with black-smudged eyes half-hidden behind voluptuous drapes of hair. Or this one, rather au natural with his head full of messy curls, pale mole-dotted skin, and a way of moving that was both balletic and indifferent to his place in space.
After awhile John'll say what he always says about the tall thing to the left of the Eye. "The BT Tower looks like a sonic screwdriver, don't you think?"
John presses his ear to Sherlock's back and listens to the rumbling, then the pounding of Sherlock's heart, then its slow steadying. Eventually Sherlock says, "Y'r turn," all lispy-tired, and John holds him still when he tries to shift.
Sherlock squinted at his own reflection in one of the big, shiny shop mirrors. Despite being barely two feet from the glass, he couldn't actually make out his own face all that well, so he raised his eyebrows the better to see.
Sherlock turns, looks. John's smile is—Sherlock can't think of the word for it right now but he will later, he'll think of the word and that word will be
("Yes you did," John would say seventeen weeks and two minutes from this moment. "You licked your lips and cocked your hip like a giddy stripper.")
enough, not for either of them. Sometimes you have to know that, you have to grow awhile without the love of your life to know that that's what he
Quickly they again settle one behind the other. For a long time neither is aware of much but the other's breathing, of murmured words, low laughs. For a long time they completely forget to guide the horse.
It'd be very ambitious of him, of course. Sherlock out masses him by more than a stone and a good half foot. Still, it'd be brilliant if he tried. Like any tantrum-throwing child Sherlock'll take shouts over silence any day.
He leaned toward John and Sherlock said, "I was a queen bee on her mating flight. I flew over the top of the tallest trees with just one drone. He stayed close, he fed me honey, and we danced. Then we mated for hours, rising ever higher on summer-warm air until…until we, until I…until…the dream…"
I have no idea if this place sells lube or jam or sex aids, so if I don't know and I took the photo then probably very few of your readers will know. So have the boys pick up any old thing you want from this newsagent and convenience store! Maybe the shopkeeper is sweet on John, maybe she stocks obscure medical periodicals for him. Sherlock is so
John Watson's girlfriend sat up quickly. The long-fingered man depilating John's privates went still. And John Watson quickly realised he had said way the fuck too much.
So Sherlock said, "Was it enough for your essay on human sexuality? That in the first wet dream I remember I was a queen bee on her mating flight?"
He looked so annoyingly GQ what with that hair curling perfectly against his collar, the flawlessly pressed suit, light eyes slanting up just-so, voluptuous lips that—damn it, that's not the point. The point is...
irked he'd got one bit of his original deduction wrong: Dull was the last thing John Watson was. The very last.
"Even better. I'll buy us both enough alcohol to make the kissing we're going to do in about 60 minutes feel natural and right and not even a little bit awkward if you let me pass my driving test."
The museum is a frenetically busy place at almost all times and to be honest my head canon for Sherlock wouldn't have him there over often. It's just too jammed with human bodies to be of much use to him, but your mileage and your Sherlock may vary.
Three feet from Sherlock's table John Watson leaned on a cafe counter and avidly watched the barista make his mocha latte. He was not aware that his tongue stuck out, or that he was leaning forward a bit, or that he vibrated with eagerness. This would be his first mocha latte of the week. He was only allowed three. He rationed himself. He had no idea why.
she told me to come talk to you." Sherlock took a deep breath…held it…held it… "Deductions! I deduce things! And I deduced that you fancy me!"
time. Instead he just blinked and waited for the therapist's inevitable follow-up question (even her statements had rising inflection).
For the last three years I've attended a college right behind Montague Street, so I can tell you what I know of the area. Montague Street is very short—one block long—and it's in the Bloomsbury district, a tidy, urban, pleasant part of town very dense with museums, universities, and student housing.
"Pressure's her thing. Dom, sub, oh that's for confused children. But a deadline, a ticking clock, the need to hurry, to do it now or not do it? That's what gets her going."
Usually Sherlock stirs then too, sighing and loose-limbed, and underneath the cover John'll keep licking and sucking and between those he'll hum, "Fuck me, mmm, please fuck me."
So the thing is, I know how stressful the lockdown situation is for everyone. I'm a homebody at heart and even I sometimes go stand in the back garden in the middle of the night, just so I can feel like I went somewhere. So I know people are coping just how they can, and I also know the pandemic is bringing out new sides to people you thought you knew but, but–
"You've never talked to a John Watson who's had a string of six truly awful first dates. I'm sure your cousin's lovely Mike, but I couldn't pull right now if you gave me a rope and a winch. Coffee?"
John grins and wonders how the big git got his number. He shoves his mobile in his pocket, pretends he's not going to reply. At half six he does.
The park often sees city workers taking their lunch on the benches there, but it is never really a busy place, so it's easy to take your time and to see what it is that makes this place so special. And that is this:
Greg Lestrade was patient. Greg's pretty much always patient. So he tolerated the sudden onslaught of lingering looks; the pointed, personal questions; the bizarre and random touches.
thank you, he'll come back tomorrow or the day after and he'll see what people keep telling him isn't there, he'll
Sherlock stepped close to the shiny, shiny mirror in the very white optometry show room and he scowled. Ha! And there it was, the expression that made the violent voluble and the tremulous talkative. Would the scowl still work if he wore glasses?
John'll get muddy helping a goose get free of a piece of wire that's trapped it fast, he'll make silly faces at a weeping baby in the park when the father looks so stressed he's about to fall apart, and John'll stand up so fast to get to a hurting human being that he'll knock over his whisky, a double, no ice.
While John might have been completely unaware of the location of his tongue and that it was now doing a sexy, anticipatory samba across his bottom lip, he was, peripherally, quite aware of the conversation of the two strangers just behind him and to his left.
"Shut up John."), shook it with the sober solemnity of a diplomat about to negotiate a disarmament treaty. "I'm Sherlock Holmes."
On that same day Sherlock learned he could be brave and that the d-thingy Mycroft taught him really worked. This led to learning he could make a living from the science of deduction.
Hearing these few highly unusual words in a sinful baritone so surprised the good doctor that he reflexively turned to gape at the man who'd purred them.
Sherlock loved sucking John's cock. Sometimes what he loved best was feeling John twist beneath his hands, a warm-body squirm that made Sherlock emphatically feel John's presence, blood-warm and real in their bed.
So their first time neither man even got his kit off. They kissed, they humped, they shoved their trousers to their thighs and stroked one another until they came.
The funny thing is, John doesn't find the question funny. He should, it's an odd question. But John's not laughing, he's thinking about his answer and he takes his time.
The genius who notices the furled-up edge on a plaster, the stopped watch on a wrist, the stain on the knot of a tightly-tied tie, does not for the next five minutes notice when they stop so a child can pet Mike; doesn't feel it when a low-lying branch brushes across his forehead; doesn't see the Queen's Guard contingent of twelve plumed soldiers ride by on their own fine mounts.
Sherlock knew how to say lots of other things. Things like "—and obviously the ladder in the man's stockings spoke of
John Watson, after eighteen months of being mostly-unemployed—because no one hires a surgeon with a visible, fucking tremour, and probably incipient alcoholism—yeah, after all that, John can really get behind the whole stink-eye thing.
little flirt is a ruse and you have no intention of putting out, as the Americans so quaintly say. So, you can stop trying to trick me, it won't work."
Sherlock grinned. "I'm Sherlock Holmes. I'm the man who's about to make your life a lot more interesting."
sort of way, so John looked back to the tall, drunk guy, who still held a long finger aloft. "I'm…Shhhhhhh..."
London is still London and forever will be, but she's a slower city now in some ways and watching people march through the railway station's arches, Sherlock wonders what his world would have been when this station was built, if 1840s London was
"I could have helped reduce the severity of your allergic reaction…I could have helped it not hurt you so badly."
For his part Greg proceeded to stand—or rather sit—his ground like a sword-wielding angel, a fierce expression driving off Sally, Superior, Haddad, Baines, Dimmock, and even the chief superintendant when each tried joining their small band for a pint.
He went to that crime scene and saw what everyone missed and it doesn't matter it took all day, it doesn't matter no one said thanks, what matters is he showed them
The point, the whole point, the sharp pokey point of the point is that Sherlock is three seconds from either telling the man to go away so that he can
This sergeant had not made the emergency call that got him out of a warm hospital and into a minus ten degree night.
