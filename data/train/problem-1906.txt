“Quick question, Sherlock.”
Sherlock's heart skips a beat. Again. John Watson will surely be the death of him. “Yes, John. Do that.”
“You’re very calm for a man who is about to die."
He feels John smiling.“Yeah?”
John tries to understand. He could never have predicted her role in this. He was certain the clues were carried out by Molly, considering her photographs and the computer tricks; or Irene, planting her contact information for him to find. Why would Mary—who barely knows him—be the one to help him?
“Who’s that standing next to you in the picture?” The man looks familiar to John: long nose. Thin lips. Condescending glare.
Gabriela writhes and moans at her touch, and Sarah's fingertips eventually work their way down the front of her top. She massages her breasts wantonly until they pour out of her clothes, her nipples dark and round and hard as Sarah continues to tease them.
be a candle at dinner, Angelo insists. It's more
He opens the app to see what she posted.
John breaks into an uproarious fit of laughter. "Kill you? I'm sorry, why—" He sucks in a breath, barely able to speak. "Just...Why?" He wheezes. "Why on earth would you think that?"
The very second he is within Sherlock’s reach, Sherlock swoops him up into his arms and pulls him in for a firm, lingering kiss. John leans into him, allowing his crutches to clatter to the floor.
“Morning.” John’s heart is warm, his voice rough from sleep. “You look radiant.”
least."
“About thirty seconds before I told you. Though, come to think of it, I’m positive I’ve loved you for much longer.”
With a low hum, Sherlock pulls him closer; nibbling at John's bottom lip gingerly before trailing his tongue over it. John’s lips part, and Sherlock licks into his mouth, commencing a slow tortuous forwards and backwards motion of hips. It elicits a chilled moan of anticipation from John, driving him absolutely mad in the best and worst possible way.
John takes a deep breath and exhales. Shakes his head, repeats Sherlock's name several times. Leans forwards to set his wine back onto the table. Brushes his elbow against Sherlock's knee. Goosebumps. Finally, he looks back over at Sherlock, his expression bewilderingly soft. "You honestly have no idea?"
Sherlock exclaims. "Your story is very wrong. It was not just one goose. It was a gaggle of a half dozen, if not more! And they were unnaturally large!"
Beyond their bedroom walls, all of their lingering glances become furtive; their smiles become restrained. Beyond the walls, John ignores every buzz of sensual magnetism between them. He tears his eyes away each time Sherlock's standing close enough to puncture him with his gaze. Ignores every desire to hold Sherlock's hand when their knees graze together beneath the table.
"Got it!" Sherlock finally says. He takes in a deep breath. "Alright. Tell me what I'm thinking of, John."
"Yeah." John looks up beneath his dark, shadowy eyelashes. "I don’t think I saw stars like that again until Afghanistan." He gives Sherlock a nod of encouragement. "And how about you? What’s the best memory you’ve got from your childhood?”
He’s drowning in John and never wants to be rescued. Overcome with a surge of passion, he slides his tongue back into John's opening as he pushes a second finger in.
It bleeds into his ears, sending ripples of nostalgia down his spine. Each chord grows more dissonant until the piece finally approaches a cadence. As this happens, Sherlock's curiosity grows, and he opens his eyes to see who plays.
“Ooooh, let me see!” Sarah leans over immediately. “Oh, yeah. Damn, girl.”
“I’m here,” he shushes him gently. “I’m here, sweetheart. And you’re here, and we’re both safe. Please don’t cry.”
Sherlock is not quite prepared for the pain of rejection that he feels. In nearly four years, the two of them have never worked on a case without each other.
to say. That Sherlock’s the most treasured person in his life; and far more treasured than any person in his past. That he's never known anyone kinder or wiser.
It doesn't work.
John ruffles his hair playfully. “Yes.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. "To—”
The room grows so silent it's deafening. Even with John's exhalations in his ear, he feels only the warmth of his breath. Perhaps, he thinks, all of his senses have been exhausted. Perhaps all of the pleasure that exists in the universe is right here between them, leaving space for nothing else to exist.
They’re the only two in the room. The man regards John apathetically, his fingers crossed together over the tabletop.
The haunting music of the pipe organ echoes from every wall. Sherlock doesn't recognise the melody, yet there's a familiarity that resonates deep within him. Buried in his subconscious—something he knows he knows, but doesn't know why. Perhaps it was a nursery rhyme his grandparents sang to him as a boy? A tune from another life, or another universe altogether?
“Perhaps,” John says. “But if I may be so bold… it
"Driving
"Okay, fine!" In a dramatic gesture, John flails the blankets off his upper body and onto the foot of the bed. “You’re right! I've got no idea what to talk to you about! And it's driving me mad!"
Sherlock looks up at him. "This murderer can be stopped. But I need your help. I need
“Sounds quite pleasant, I must admit,” Sherlock says.
Their bodies have been entwined countless times before, but this time, it’s different. They don't speak of not knowing when they will see each other again; but they don't need to. It’s spoken in the way that they drink one another in, wrapped up together like blankets.
Sherlock swallows thickly. “Then why haven’t you already killed me?”
He will fill the John-shaped hole in his life somehow. More cases, more research, more experiments. He will figure it out. And he will miss him still, but he can wait. Perhaps it won’t be forever.
John grins and hums with happiness. "Wouldn't dare."
"Yes." Sherlock nods slowly. "With your one good hand."
But John knows; he knows how madly in love he is. He also knows that at best, Sherlock loves him as a friend. But that’s an issue for Future John to deal with. For the time being, he’ll focus on healing and on being an adequate pretend husband.
"Something you've always dreamt of doing," Sherlock repeats. "And the reason you have not."
“No. Not that.” John pushes himself to keep going, though his heart is roaring in his throat. “The feelings. Were they real to you?”
of them. Just the ones who are here."
Sherlock tries to respect Brook's wishes. It proves difficult, at times, to keep his findings to himself--but he soon becomes to think of it as a furtive mission of proof that he can, indeed solve it on his own. The two of them go on as normal, but Sherlock spends his own spare time--when he’s not studying or helping Brook--looking into the Oxford murders. He frequently contacts Sergeant Lestrade, a New Scotland Yard detective in London who begrudgingly consults Brook and himself when the London police are in over their heads. He cautiously allows his confidence and fascination to grow, especially when a third murder occurs a few weeks later, and then a fourth.
Sherlock rolls his eyes but doesn’t argue. It’s not a completely inaccurate observation.
Sherlock glares at him. "That is a very smart, and also a very stupid, answer. Try again."
"How do I do what?"
Brook and Sherlock soon become inseparable. They spend most of their spare time together: hours of exhilarating conversation mixed with late night investigations in Brook’s lab, solving cases both old and new. Due to Brook’s prestige in the field, they have a constant incoming of cases, and between the two of them, nothing goes unsolved.
As he steps over to join his friend for dinner, a wave of warmth courses through his body, and he wonders if the wine is already kicking in.
William suctions himself to John’s body, claiming that he produces more heat than a furnace—so he’ll have to share. John wraps the two of them tightly in their cocoon of linens until there’s not a hair’s width of distance between their skin. William thanks him. He presses the cold tip of his nose against John’s neck, and he presses his dry lips to John’s throat. They kiss inside their cocoon until their cheeks are flushed with heat and their skin is drenched in sweat. The silent room is filled with shivering sighs as their cocks grow hard, sliding luxuriously together until the two men are overwhelmed and overheated.
Outside, they don’t talk about the kissing. They don’t talk about it inside, either, but perhaps that’s because their mouths are otherwise entangled.
And that's when his foot becomes stuck in the leg of his trousers. They end the kiss only to break into giddy laughter, grabbing on to each other as they tumble down to their knees.
The details of the case aren't particularly memorable; what's important is how rapidly it’s solved. In record time, of course, due to Sherlock's genius, and also due John's solemn promise to continue kissing him once it’s over.
"Pistachio?" Sherlock repeats, gracefully tossing his belongings to the ground and whisking himself off the sofa. "Wait. Since when do you bake macarons?"
Sherlock's not
"We are a couple," John reminds him.
No. He’s not going to talk about William. He smiles. “I think I’m just a little intoxicated, that’s all.” He gestures towards the two of them. “So tell me. How did it all happen?”
John reacts quickly, catching his waist to steady him. He smiles at Sherlock, his hair perfectly windblown and matted to his face—and he’s so achingly beautiful that Sherlock can hardly believe he’s real.
“Oh my god,” Gabriela says. “I’m sorry, John. I’m really...affectionate when I’m drunk.”
Sherlock rubs his temples. “You’re ridiculous. And I fail to see why I require you to approve of this person, anyway. I’m simply going to choose, and you’re going to have to deal with it.”
It’s been almost six weeks since John and Sherlock have begun to perform. There have been dozens of hours spent holding hands and hundreds of practiced kisses. Yet butterflies fill John’s stomach every time their fingers brush together; somehow, every kiss only tastes sweeter.
Molly takes a drink of her green tea. "Not last night. But you
She sighed happily. “Well, I’ll see you there, dear!” and she turned to go.
John kisses William with his entire soul, and William doesn’t hesitate, kissing him back with a soul that’s every bit as heated.
"Because you already know me better than anyone else." John turns his head towards him. "And half of those things you figured out on your own. So I’m not really sure what you
“Then you’re an idiot,” William says through tight lips. “Everyone in their right minds went indoors hours ago to have a drink in their own bloody homes—and yet, here you are, treading through the snow like some stubborn mule!”
Sherlock's heart skips a beat. The two have spent nearly every day, alone, doing nothing. Sherlock has wondered when John would become bored of this, but in the past three weeks, the only thing he sees when he observes John is that stupid, beautiful smile.
—it’s not open for discussion.”
John leans away to meet his eyes. “Very smooth, Holmes. You’ve gotten quite good at this, haven’t you?”
The tug at John’s abdomen becomes impossible to ignore. He dips his head, pressing his lips against Sherlock’s throat; against his jaw; at his earlobe. He threads their fingers together, softly guiding Sherlock’s downwards past his abdomen and between his legs. Sherlock takes the hint, wrapping his fingers around his own hardness to take control of his pleasure.
“I don’t understand,” John says aloud to nobody in particular—a clear sign he’s going mad. “Who is Sherlock?”
“You were just... in the neighbourhood... at one in the morning? In the middle of a snowstorm?” William crinkles his forehead with confusion. “And were you...reciting the anatomy of the hand?” His expression is one of disbelief, but it also contains a possible hint of fond amusement.
"Did you ever think about how things between you two are going to be so, so different now? Because you
Before anyone answers, the planchette begins to move. Donovan has taken her hands away, however—and it seems to be moving, again, of its own accord.
John has never wanted to punch a man so badly in his life. How dare he detain him for no reason, interrogate him—and now, he’s got to know his business with Sherlock?
“Extremely certain.”
Sherlock drums his fingers on the arm of his chair. “Thank you,” he says abruptly, though he’s not sure why he’s thanking John for giving him such a stomachache.
“This is, of course, the one mystery that our minds cannot yet comprehend,” Sherlock responds.
“John.” Sherlock butts into him sideways with his shoulder. “Where do you think you’re going?”
Releasing his arms, William slides his palms down to tuck them behind John’s upper thighs. John gives in, wrapping his arms and legs around the taller man’s shoulders and hips.
Sherlock stills himself. “It surprises you.” He looks directly at John, but John won't meet his eyes. "It surprises you that I've had sexual experiences with other people, because I have always said that I'm not interested in sex. You know that closeness is what I am interested in; therefore, it also surprises you that I wasn't in love with them."
John’s not completely accustomed to having Sherlock care for him this way—he’s very good at it. Or good at faking it, as the case may be.
“If you're in love with him, Doctor, heed my advice: forget it. This performance may have served the two of you while you were here, but to continue beyond these doors will unquestionably be detrimental to my brother’s mental state."
John tells Sherlock that his hair is every bit as soft as he imagined, and that he’s brilliant and beautiful—just as they practiced, too. He brushes a very soft kiss against the crown of Sherlock’s head—which is something they did not practice. He didn’t plan to do it. It was sort of automatic, given the proximity, but very subtle—perhaps Sherlock didn’t notice.
“Of course it’s not, silly.” Sherlock carelessly flicks the dandelion away and reaches for another.
Whatever. He’s tremendously exhausted. So as he dozes off, he tells himself that tonight he can ignore the bizarre events of the evening, and it will all still be there for him tomorrow.
He closes his eyes, warmed by the sunlight on his skin, relishing the cool morning breeze on his cheek. He imagines the sun's rays are John's fingers, trickling over his arms as they lie beneath crisp white sheets, and John tells him that he loves him for the first time. The breeze is John's soft lips on his eyelids, his nose, and his forehead—as they picnic against a willow tree in the park. They are at a lake together in Greece, swimming and dining on fresh figs, and in a small, dark flat in Central London, where they raise their daughter. They're growing old in Sussex, John looking on lovingly from the garden as Sherlock tends to his beehives. A wedding on a white, sandy beach in Bali; another in the sprawling Swiss Alps; and yet another in the Sahara.
When John releases him, it feels too soon. His mouth reforms into an enormous smile, and he continues as though nothing has happened. “You were right about the launderette.” He turns to walk to the cupboard, leaving Sherlock breathless and stunned. “However, I didn’t go to the bakery this time. In fact, I...”
He hasn’t even had William in his bed. Sure, he’s had him everywhere else: the floor. The table. The bathroom counter. The wall, the alleyway, the kitchen. And now, he’ll have him nowhere at all but his dreams.
Molly. Molly
It shines brighter than a diamond.
The sound of his name alone sends John. His thrusts gain speed. Sherlock is an observant man; he notices his effect immediately. Nuzzling against John’s ear, he playfully whispers his name again, holding onto the vowel until it becomes a moan.
There’s an inconvenient lump in Sherlock’s throat that seems to have formed down in his chest. It threatens to work its way upwards and spring out through his eyes, so he squeezes them tightly and swallows hard, just to be safe.
The man’s lips curl in disgust, and he closes his eyes, taking a moment to compose himself. John smiles with the satisfaction of having wiped that smug smile off his face.
"Death. Madness. Love. It’s all the same—do you see that now, Sherlock? It’s all the same.” He drops his voice low, breathing into Sherlock’s ear: “It was all. For. You.”
"Yes?"
John's heart thumps. “Yeah?” he says, a bit roughly.
"Your faith in me is much appreciated, as always,” Sherlock says. Then, without warning, he heaves John’s chair forwards at full speed.
But Sherlock can think of a number of ways that sentence might continue, and seventy-six percent of them are not good. So he decides he ought to speak first.
John wastes no time. He’s hungry, and his appetite is desperate to be sated.
And oh, it’s quite comforting to know that Donovan has returned to her baseline of insufferability as well.
“I find it funny when you say that.” Sherlock is distracted by the dandelion he twirls between his fingers. He’s no older than twelve or so. His reddish-brown hair is just as curly—if a bit messier—at this age; his jawline is soft, his cheeks bronzed with freckles.
As the weeks and nights go by, John continues to stay with Sherlock. Because it’s no longer Sherlock's bed—it's theirs. He's got his own side, with a nightstand where he keeps his watch, and his books, and his wallet. He stays not because he needs to, but because he must.
Then it hits Sherlock like a blunt object.
Jumper collection
“It’s easy to see how much you love him,” she remarks.
Hand in hand, beneath the blistering rain, the two of them make a run for it.
In turn, Anderson sets a hand on his shoulder. “I hate you too, Sherlock,” he says. “I hate you a lot.” And in Sherlock’s heart, he knows he means it.
“Molly,” Sherlock notes. “If you’re attempting to put out the candles, perhaps you ought to light them first.”
Oh, god. The absolute intimacy of this moment grips Sherlock like a vise. He moans, reigniting the arching of his hips.
John shuts his eyes and takes a moment to breathe in. “The Woman will tell you where to go,” he whispers to himself, echoing the words of the note he found in Sherlock’s flat.
John chokes again and attempts to mumble a thank you. Sherlock sends Angelo off to get a glass of water. As he goes to retrieve it, Sherlock bursts into a fit of laughter.
"What is that supposed to mean?!" Sherlock leans towards her with a look of intimidation, arms crossed over his nucleus.
"Do you think it may have been a simple grammar error?" Gabriela asks.
"Yes, I want it. Yes." John thinks he's stating the obvious, but one never knows with Sherlock.
The shiver that's been on the verge of release finally shoots through John's body.
“Again, I ask: who?”
John's fingers twitch in his. "I'll need my hand back for that."
“That makes me happy to hear.”
“I’ll go!” Gabriela chimes in. “It’s my hometown. I can definitely help you out. Plus, I’d love to see my mom and brothers.”
Once he’s fully seated, Sherlock turns his head back, reclaiming John’s lips and continuing to kiss him passionately. His lower body moves in waves as he rides him, and John bucks up into him, slowly, slowly, slowly.
Enjoy!
“Not like this. Not in a way that’s so…” he trails off, seeming at a loss for words.
He can feel John's sides contracting with laughter. "Oh my god.”
"That's not necessarily a bad thing."
It’s well past midnight—the witching hour. Molly has just placed two dozen unlit candles on the floor with no explanation. She begins to sprinkle generous portions of an especially pungent liquid over them.
“But in all seriousness—“ Moriarty clears his throat.
"You make it very easy. All it takes is a slight brush of the knees."
“It was like I became two different people. I would study and go to classes and see you when I could—and I’d spend evenings at the restaurant, then with Nicholas. I was in deep. I gave him as much of my time as I possibly could. But eventually, he demanded more and more of it.”
“Aren’t you the slightest bit curious?” John asks one morning (six days later), as the two of them are drinking tea.
John nods. "Two weeks."
Mary looks back to John. “Did he tell you why?”
"Glad to be of service," John says, voice a bit husky. "Actually, would you like to lie down on the sofa? It may be more comfortable."
Sherlock. Why would we bring you here, knowing it would only hurt him?”
The melody of the pipe organ returns, and it's all Sherlock can hear. He allows his eyes to fall closed as he immerses himself in the music.
"And just because he didn't
John Watson is thirteen years old when he kisses someone for the first time.
“Mrs. Hudson?” Molly asks.
This is true. And if John wants to go on buttering Sherlock up like this, he's allowed a few more quiet seconds.
Sherlock grins and sets his hands on John's waist. "People are watching, John."
Sadly, it comes to an end when there's a knock at Mrs. Hudson's door.
“Mary, I—”
fit...in those earrings...which I got you...and which I also definitely noticed that you are wearing. I think...that you should continue to wear them...later...at your flat...while we have sex. Love, Anderson. Aaaaaaaaaaaand send!" Smiling with smug satisfaction, he winds his finger back and pokes the screen of his phone enthusiastically.
John kisses the damp curls where his hairline meets his neck. "You are my forever safe space, Sherlock,” he continues. "You are radiant in every sense of the word, and I'm the luckiest man in the world to be caught in your afterglow."
“Yeah. Me too.”
Mary stands a few yards away, still—and the wooden columns of the deck partially cover her view. It’s completely possible, John realises, for her to be fooled; he’s just got to keep her from coming closer.
His descent would align magnificently with the Virgin Sacrifice—if John didn't show up to save him. But he does show up. He shows up, grumpy and heroic. He yells at Sherlock a little bit, and calls him an idiot a little bit, and then he yells at Mrs. Petrova (more than a little bit).
John walks down the driveway, deciding he’ll let himself cry once he’s returned to the car—not a second before. He doesn’t want to risk Sherlock overhearing him. So he chokes back his emotions, reaching for his phone and any distraction it might provide.
"Of course!" Right now, John will do just about anything to move the conversation forwards.
“And your mum?” he asks.
I can’t say enough about how important your comments are. I’m no good at responding, but I see each one, and they are what keep me writing. So if you enjoy this, please leave comments—short ones, long ones, simple ones, complex ones. Just one, or one per chapter chapter, or one every two chapters...there’s no such thing as too many.
John has never felt anything like this. As he drives himself into Sherlock, everything else fading away, his entire body is lit with more pleasure than he ever thought possible. Sherlock has never been more beautiful than right now; head thrown back wantonly onto the pillow. Shadows dance over his exposed neck and throat; his curls are tangled and matted to his forehead with sweat, and his naked body surges beneath him like ocean waves.
"You most certainly are!" John has given up the fight; peals of laughter echo through the room. "Do you remember that time we were walking through Regents Park? And we’d just had lunch, and I was carrying some leftover chips—"
"Up," he urges, patting him softly. John raises his hips so Sherlock can remove the rest of his clothing, and before he's even settled back in to his chair, Sherlock's got his long fingers wrapped around him. And within seconds, he's got his fingers around his own cock—gorgeous and more erect than John's ever seen it—encasing both of their lengths at once.
As a fake husband, Sherlock's presence isn't questioned by the medical staff. He's regularly briefed on John's condition (a concussion, bone fractures, internal bleeding—spine and skull intact), and he's allowed to stay after all other visitors must leave. This is good, because after surgery, John sleeps for far longer than Sherlock finds convenient.
“Sunrise?” Sherlock panics. "But I haven't prepared my lines."
John stares at him, with so much to say, none of which, he’s sure, Sherlock wants to hear. So he only says: “Have fun.”
"Yeah." John glances briefly at the crutches and then back to Sherlock. He’s intentionally aloof in his response, though it’s true—he's learning to walk with crutches very successfully. It would be something worth celebrating if weren't the reason he’s leaving.
Blah blah blah blah blah. John continues on about something uninteresting, but Sherlock isn’t listening; he’s got a million other things on his mind at the moment. Of course, the bakery was simply a hypothesis based on John’s known habits. But it doesn’t even register with Sherlock that his assumption was off the mark.
"Where
John's voice is firm; it’s quite sexy, and the only thing distracting Sherlock from the fact that he does not currently have a brownie in his mouth.
"John," Sherlock repeats; he’s two or three steps behind him. "Will you look at me? Please."
"Have you been to Poland? Switzerland? The Cayman Islands? Cambodia?"
She smiles warmly at him. “Come here, you,” she says, holding her arms out for an embrace.
Sender: Molly Hooper
He glides his hand over William’s breast pocket, over his shoulder, and sets it on the collar of William’s dress shirt. “I don’t know,” he replies. "Is it customary for the groom to be desperately in love with his best man rather than his future wife?”
"Yes! Yes, exactly."
John doesn’t turn or acknowledge him; he simply waits for him to speak.
Sherlock refuses to acknowledge the sarcasm in his tone. "They had a fascinating selection. There was the iron maiden, of course. Essentially a standing coffin, completely lined with sharp spikes and large enough to contain a living human. The thumbkin, which, despite its childlike moniker, was a vise used to crush the bones in a victim's fingers and toes. And there was The Rack, which just stretched a person out from head to toe, more and more, until they were stretched so far they would just p—"
John purses his lips and looks back up at Sherlock, apprehensive. He takes a deep breath. "You know how, sometimes, people say your life flashes before your eyes when you're about to die. Well, mine didn't, really. Not in the way you'd expect.”
Sherlock stares at him quietly. "Yes. But John, I think I've come to the conclusion that I—“
A few hours later, Sherlock shows his mobile phone to John. “How about this one?”
As the clock ticks past noon, the two finally sit at a booth to drink their breakfast. Then, they drink another. They share a tipsy cigarette in the alleyway, and afterwards, William playfully shoves John into a snowbank. John swears at him affectionately, pulls himself up, and shoves a handful of snow beneath William’s shirt. William yelps at the coldness, runs back inside and rips his shirt off over his head. John declares himself the winner.
“It’s possible someone posted the photo of her on that day as a way of leading you to the library for the next clue,” Gabriela says.
It’s 2 am and 2 am is the best time to publish new chapters :))))
Sherlock softly bites his bottom lip as he drapes one leg over John's thighs, and then the other. Circling his arms around John's shoulders, he sinks into his lap.
He smiles at her. “You can bet on it.”
“Oh, look at you,” the florist coos. She turns towards John. “He’s so happy. You love him; why not give him everything he wants for your special day?”
Sarah pulls her attention back to him. “I don’t need to."
heart, somehow.
John peeks over her head to survey the room. Gabriela is on the bed next to Irene, her hand resting on her knee. It’s no surprise that she’s already comfortably intimate with The Woman, he thinks.
He falls silent, and Sherlock falls silent as well.
William swears at John for torturing him, so John roughly pushes his cock in—but only the very tip. He stills himself for a moment and then pulls himself back out. He drags the cool, silky tip of his cock underneath William’s entrance, above it, around it. Ruts against it until William nearly sobs with desire, begging for John to fuck him.
will understand.
“Be quiet, John.” Sherlock moves closer. “Be quiet and have sex with me.”
Sherlock, who isn’t as good at hiding his feelings as he believes he is, displays a series of several emotions within a span of three seconds. Confusion, comprehension, disbelief, disappointment, neutrality. And finally, he forces a smile.
Who knew that attention from John could be so addictive? And in true addict form, Sherlock wants every bit of it—which seems to work in his favour, because tonight, John is giving it all to him.
John’s eyes dart between the four women, who all appear deeply confused. “Am I to understand that none of you had a thing to do with those clues?”
John sucks in a short breath, unsure of whether he’s shocked, confused, grateful—or all three. “That was you?”
William wraps his heart-shaped lips around the filter of his cigarette and inhales, the tip of it glowing like a firefly. He forms a delectable “O” shape with his sinful mouth, and he exhales, flicking pieces of ash onto the pavement.
John pauses. "Do you want to?"
“Yeah?” John’s embarrassment quickly turns into excitement. “Do you think I could come along with you to Bart’s, then?”
“Yes. Happy. Amongst other things.”
"No." Sherlock won't let go of him. "Stay. Please."
"There had better be a kiss. At the
It’s quite the injustice, and it’s driving John mad.
"Sherlock," he says with a sigh of satisfaction.
Besides—he wasn’t in love with them. Not even close.
"Sherlock," Lestrade says.
And if the stars align, perhaps he'll get to kiss him at midnight.
“Yes?”
And it's not the first time he's thought of these things. He's thought about them many times—even before they were fake married. But back then, it was a fleeting curiosity that he fully suppressed. He had no choice. Nothing could possibly come of such a fruitless desire. But tonight, John's presence has disarmed him. And the sounds that he makes as he kisses Sherlock back—low moans and rumbles and delighted hums—only serve to disarm him more.
The next morning—very, very early—the two of them are awakened again by Gemma coming into the room to take John’s vitals. After remarking how adorable they are, she lets them know that the psychiatric specialist, Doctor Torres, will be paying them a visit this morning to discuss John’s recovery.
“Yes?”
“Hello, ghosts!” She says cheerfully. “Happy Halloween!”
John takes Sherlock’s head back into his hands—so delicately, this time, it’s as though he’s sure Sherlock will break. “Look at me one more time, Sherlock,” he whispers. “And you tell me what you see.”
"One of your wishes is about to come true."
"Absolutely," John says raggedly. "And getting better."
“Oh! I would love that. Obviously! Or you could just make it easier and take your own. His lips brush against Sherlock’s earlobe. “While I force him to watch.” Slowly, he begins to move his fingers down Sherlock’s abdomen, resting them over the zip of his trousers. “But why don’t we start by giving him a different type of show?”
Sherlock sits in a soft patch of green grass, legs crossed, hands in his lap. His skin is sun-kissed, and he wears a thin white cotton shirt and loose khakis. The morning sun casts light over him, causing his profile to glow like an ember. Its rays reflect on the crown of his soft head like a halo, turning the black curls into a radiant plum-colour.
: John, Mrs. Hudson, Donovan
"And furthermore, today is Saturday!" Sherlock exclaims. "Traditionally, you've spent Saturday nights with your boring girlfriends, presumably to engage in various mating rituals. But it
“Sherlock!” He hisses, his voice low. “When did Death arrive?” He points his finger to a dark corner on the other side of the room.
and it was just, ‘Oh, god, oh god! John is kissing me!' And it was all so...momentous, and… and meaningful… and the possibilities of consequences of every kind began to overwhelm me, and my fight or flight response kicked in, because sometimes that happens. Why? Dear god, I wish I knew!”
Perhaps Sherlock ought to just kiss him. What would be the harm in that? They've kissed many times before.
"Blah blah, blah blah blah." Sherlock hears the brilliant words flowing from his own mouth as he divulges his findings on the victim. Lestrade nods along, because he’s fluent in gibberish.
God, how lovely he is. And how desperately Sherlock wants to kiss him, to hold him, to marvel over what they have just done. But he can wait.
God, it’s cold. He takes out his phone to reserve an Uber, trying to distract himself from the likelihood that he’s about to develop hypothermia. “Trapezium, scaphoid, capitate, radius...” he murmurs to himself. Ha. He suddenly remembers anatomy again. “...ulna, lunate, triquetrum, metacarpals, distal, middle, proximal phalanges, pisiform…”
John sets his hand on the door handle and pushes. The door swings open, and the lights are still on. “Was there someone inside?”
In the center of the room is a large booth with a circular table. On the table, an unopened bottle of Cabernet is placed next to two empty glasses.
“No,” he growls. “We are not.”
At some point that morning, and several times after, Sherlock peeks his head into the room to check on him. This is real. Mrs. Hudson stops by mid afternoon to bring lunch. Real. John wakes up briefly to roll over in his bed and take his medicine. Real. He wakes up another time to check his phone. It’s already eight o’clock at night. Real.
"John," Sherlock murmurs against his lips. "Do you know that you're the only person I've ever loved?"
Gabriela laughs and shakes her head. “Nope. No blood.”
John beams. "Same." He pauses. "Only not right now, because you're going to follow me. We were speaking in terms of figurative following, like in a romantic way, right?"
”Yeah.” She casually takes a swig of her drink. “MIT, engineering PhD candidate.”
“Indeed.” Sherlock grins, playfully pinning him back to the wall with a happiness he can’t contain. “Which leads me to ask—would you mind showing me that last...technique...one more time?”
"Christ," he laughs breathlessly and sighs, allowing his body to relax. "You are a wicked, wicked man."
Brook suddenly snaps out of his haze, familiarity settling over him. “Sherlock! Jesus, where are my manners?” His voice is coloured faintly with the warm cadence of an Irish accent. “So sorry. I was in my, uh—brain attic, if you will. It sometimes takes a moment for me to come out of there.” Rising from his desk, he extends a hand in greeting.
“Jack the Ripper,” Brook responds with a smile. “It’s inconclusive, of course, but it’s fun to think about.” He gestures towards his desk. “Want to join me?”
Molly bursts into laughter. “God, no. I mean, I’d love to be. Been madly in love with that bastard since the moment I met him. But he’s not attracted to women, and, well.” She looks down to her breasts, and then back up at John. “You think a smart girl like myself would have moved on by now, knowing that, but...nope.” She sighs deeply, slumping her shoulders. “Seriously. Fuck my life.”
"You did a great job!” Molly says, and abracadabra, they are friends again. “The costume is
John shrugs. "He's the observant one."
"Don't pester me with logic, John!" Sherlock protests. "Ugh. I liked you better when you were unconscious."
Next up: Molly attempts to hold a seance. John attempts to save Lestrade’s life. Neither attempt goes as planned.
Mary presses her lips together, huffing something like a laugh. “He’s not wrong.” Her eyes move away. “I’ll spare you the details, but...” She begins to fumble nervously with the hem of her shirt. "...I also have a past I left behind. The difference is, there was nobody for me to take the fall for. In my story, I was the villain.” She pauses, carefully forming her words. “I hurt others. I took lives. I don’t think I can ever hope to redeem myself; I definitely don’t deserve it. The best I can do is spend my life protecting others from people like me.”
Sherlock decides to take pity on Anderson—but only because the conversation is beginning to make him queasy. “It's because she's wearing the earrings you bought her, and you didn’t notice.”
“Yeah. Yeah, right as rain,” John says breathlessly. "You?"
Sherlock’s eyes are fully leaking now. He buries his face into the pillow to hide the tears.
Brook sets down the core of an apple— with his left hand—next to a jar of red ink. He plucks the seeds from it, quickly and skillfully, and he turns to drop them into a box on the bookshelf behind him. The box is large; large enough that if it were full of apple seeds, and the seeds were ground together, their cyanide complex could potentially be detectable. On the bookshelf behind him, the book he was reading the day they met: a profile on a man theorised to be Jack the Ripper.
But Sherlock isn't actually thinking of that. Obviously. All Sherlock does is go to sleep immediately. He doesn't study John's nose hairs, or count his breaths, or wonder whether the mole on his left inner arm was there the night before.
Sherlock listens.
“Quite aware.”
John suddenly pulls away.
“Exactly!” Sherlock is practically wriggling in his seat with excitement. “Do you think your colleague at Bart’s hospital could get her hands on the lab results of the tissue that tested positive for cyanide? I think it’s worth looking into.”
Sherlock opens his eyes and gives him a sleepy, contented smile. “Hi,” he says. “That was quite nice.”
Sherlock then takes off his own shirt before working to remove the rest of their clothing and sealing their naked chests back together. He covers John in a deluge of kisses, and John releases stuttering sighs as his lips are consumed by Sherlock's.
dangerous for me to come along! That’s the best part!”
"No. But I need to know. It's very important."
John groans. He wants to close his eyes and cover his ears and go to sleep for the next seven million years. Instead, he chugs his coffee, plans a
Sherlock closes his eyes and lowers his head, willing himself to go back to sleep--so that the time passes quickly, and he doesn’t have to hear Moriarty’s voice.
In a minefield of unknowns, John is sure of one thing: as long as the two of them are fake husbands, the kissing practice must go on. They can sort the rest out later.
"Oh." Sherlock swallows. "Sorry."
John kisses William. “I’d like to kiss you until the stars come out,” he tells him.
“Absolutely not.”
John looks at Mary’s hand in his lap, still curled over his.
. That word again, in the space between their sweaty bodies.
“But no kissing,” Sherlock adds, laying his head onto the pillow. “And no holding hands. And definitely do
John nods. "That's my guess. And if Molly was involved somehow...or Irene... I don't think they would have come right out and said anything about it. Possibly to protect William. Or themselves. Or even me. Molly could have purposely, perhaps falsely, checked in at the MIT library to lead me there...and to lead me to the Get Sherlock message."
John leans back to look him in the eye. "I will allow it indefinitely."
John wraps his arms and legs around Sherlock once more. Sherlock lifts his body back into him, sealing their lips together the moment they’re close enough to do so.
"Hello!" says the brain. "Quick question—you know how you and John kissed last night?"
After he bids everyone farewell, someone among them decides they’ve got to end the night by playing a game called Never Have I Ever. Sherlock is unfamiliar with the game, so he lets John explain the rules.
“Sherlock!” The two of them exclaim his name in unison, creating a wondrous surround sound effect.
Mrs. Hudson sets her hand over her heart, her expression growing nostalgic. "There hasn't been one moment I've known him that he’s not been smitten. It's obvious as the noonday sun."
good places. To the taste of Sherlock's lips paired with the taste of Château Pape Clément. To the way his cold, graceful fingers might feel as they slip beneath the hem of John's shirt and up his spine. To the crumpling noise Sherlock's pristine shirt might make as he tosses it carelessly onto the floor. To the luxurious sensation of Sherlock's silk sheets on John’s back.
"Smart women," John remarks. “But do you think maybe one of them mentioned it to someone else?"
“Sherlock?” He clears his throat and looks up at him.
There's a knock at the door. The nurse barges in with her stupid nurse tools. John pulls his mouth away and rests his head on Sherlock's shoulder casually. Sherlock curses beneath his breath and laments the fact that they didn't use the door lock.
The awkwardness is louder than whatever they could possibly say at the moment, so John abruptly pulls away to thank him.
John’s eyes flutter open, and the first thing he sees is Sherlock next to him. He’s already awake, smiling at him like a man in love.
"Mm. What else?"
Gabriela's face is buried into Sarah hungrily, and even as John drops to his knees behind her, they can't be pulled from their own world. He finds it insanely arousing—the two of them, so in love with one another that nothing can break into their cloud of joyous lust.
“Have you told her that we’re together?” Sherlock asks.
John smiles. He's glad he met her. She's pretty, and nice, and her laugh is quite addictive; he finds himself wanting to do what he can to hear more of it.
And that is when The Woman decides to text him back.
"Hmm. Well, most of them."
"I've been here. With you."
Sherlock is grateful for their arrival, and for their careful handling of John as they take him to the ambulance. He's
Afterwards, they elect to drag themselves up from the floor and into Sherlock's bed. John is the one who decides; he wants to know what Sherlock's satin sheets feel like on his skin. They collapse onto the mattress together, punch drunk and exhilharated by what they've just done.
When John stirs a few hours later, Sherlock rises from his chair, tugged by the urgency to be closer to him. As John's eyes slowly come into focus, he sees Sherlock, and his face lights up with a smile so bright it could recharge the sun. He opens his mouth to speak—but he's too exhausted to produce a sound, so he beckons for Sherlock to come nearer.
“Still good.”
John to decide.”
John glances away from the television screen and up at Sherlock. "Hi." His expression is worried and amused at the same time. "You alright, there?"
Sherlock sinks back down over him, setting the bottle of lube down onto the bed. He brushes a kiss to John's forehead and then to his lips. "You'll probably want to hold on," he says with a quirk of his eyebrow.
Sherlock mouths in return.
"Oh. No, I don't suppose she is."
"I’m concerned about dropping you,” Sherlock says. “So I'm going to need to try lifting you again, if that’s alright.”
She giggles. “Ignore me. I’m just living vicariously through you. Been single for awhile now.” Molly decided months ago that she was done with “losers” and that she was going to take time to work on herself.
Dear John.
John glides his fingertips over the coarse hair on his chin. Sherlock tries not to look.
John nods slowly. "Yes."
"Oh. Hm. Well. I was certainly talking about it this morning, and fairly sure that I was speaking out loud. When you failed to respond, I assumed you simply had no objections." He takes another step towards John. They’re so close that their knees would be touching, if only John’s legs weren’t so short.
This is why he treads through twenty centimetres of snow, through empty streets, because nobody else in Boston is enough of a nutter to be outdoors. This is how he braves the bitter wind and snow, making his way slowly towards The Strand, regretting every decision he’s ever made in his life.
“About a quarter past eleven,” Gabriela responds. She takes his hand, and until then, he doesn't even realise he's shaking.
With this, the center screen flashes back off. The two outer monitors simultaneously turn on, displaying the same bright red lettering:
To ensure he doesn’t trip on his own feet, Sherlock reorients himself and takes six long strides to the bathroom. He closes the door behind him, removes his coat and shoes and the rest of his garments, and he steps into the shower. Turns the water on. Washes himself. Bides his time. Dries himself. Brushes his teeth. Briefly considers taking a swig of mouthwash to lower his inhibitions, but spits it back out into the sink instead. Puts on his night robe and exits the bathroom.
The weeks and nights go by without any more kisses or love confessions, but their bed is far from empty—there is body heat and warm breaths and murmurs of happy things. Cold noses bumping together; smooth curls and shallow exhalations and eyelashes whispering against bare skin. Cold ears pressing themselves into warm ribcages to listen to the
"Funeral," Sherlock responds in unison.
Sherlock holds to John tighter. Kisses his cheek and his jaw. Presses his lips to his wet skin between claps of thunder.
"Nevermind. Michelle?"
“It’s not?” Sherlock finally tears his eyes from the lily and back to John.
“I’ve never had this dream before,” John remarks, his adolescent voice brimming with awe.
The type of succulent in this chapter, Aeonium Blood, actually does exist. As mentioned, it’s a rare cross breed, and there’s only one place that grows it! You can find it on google :)
“Yeah?”
John frowns. The man sighs.
“I could, erm…” John fumbles. “I could tell you what it’s like, maybe. Perhaps that would be good enough for now.”
Sherlock’s face goes white. “He didn’t… tell you any embarrassing stories about me, did he?”
Sherlock shrugs casually. "I've never had any interest in emotional intelligence, either. But I've got a reason to be, now--and I've got a brilliant teacher."
John’s cheeks grow hot—due partially to Sherlock’s inquisition and proximity, and partially his own embarrassment. He shuffles his feet nervously and shrugs. “It’s not a big deal. It just hit me how much I miss going out on cases with you.”
Sherlock's lips move to the collar of John's shirt; he slips his fingers below the hem and pulls it over his head, and John is speechless and still with anticipation.
Low murmurs rush through the officers standing by, and a few of them lift their guns towards Sherlock. He releases Mycroft's collar, and the elder brother signals for them to stand down. He exhales a long-suffering sigh and glances over to Lestrade.
"Yes, I’m alright.” John looks down at himself to examine his injuries. He’s got one arm in a sling and one leg in a cast. Much of the rest of him is bruised or bandaged. “Well, no. I feel like I got thrown from the third floor of a building, but all things considered...not bad."
had been shot!” He presses his lips onto Sherlock’s neck, kissing the skin, feeling his pulse, savouring his taste and scent. “How did you—when did you even—?”
That's when Sherlock knows: for John, this is not an act—not anymore. That's when he knows: perhaps John means it. Perhaps John means it all.
He turns off his phone and stares out the back window of the cab. It’s not even quite noon, but daylight hours are almost half over. He begins to doze off a bit, until his phone buzzes in his lap, notifying him that someone has posted a new photo.
John momentarily loses his senses. He also loses his grip on the book, and it slips from his fingers, falling to the floor with a loud, echoing thud.
He makes towards the train station so he can return home to his tiny flat and his medical textbooks. As he turns a corner, he notices a neon blue sign tucked into the back of an alleyway:
After that, they climb beneath the soft covers of the bed, wrapping themselves in each other's arms. It occurs to John that it's the first time they’ve fallen asleep together since Christmas Eve.
I knew what I had to do. I knew that it was the only option to protect my loved ones from him. So I notified the court that I would no longer be testifying against him, and I constructed the plans for my death.
Sherlock prods John's lips with his tongue until they eagerly part; moves his hips in slow waves, their thin T-shirts and underwear serving as the only barrier between their naked skin.
“You must be John. I’m Irene.” She leans away to make his drink.
Besides, both of them are brimming with the urgency of pining for far too long. So with the same lack of grace they've displayed thus far, they wrestle and tug at one another’s clothing until they’re both completely naked.
“You stopped in at the launderette earlier.” His eyes snap open. “After that, you visited the bakery at the corner, where you ordered a cherry tarte. You ate half of it and gave the rest to the stray dog that sits outside of Speedy’s Cafe.”
“I am more than alright, John. I assumed it was obvious."
“You’ve made a wise decision.” The Woman’s hand falls from his mouth; and like a gust of wind from a hurricane, she plunges her knife into his abdomen.
In conclusion: I love John Watson
Sherlock’s back is to him. He leans over a table, his knuckles white from fear. He tilts his head down, his curls falling over his face. He says nothing.
aware that I occasionally leave the flat?”
unforgettable. A New Year’s Eve threesome with two gorgeous women? That’s a tattoo he’d gladly wear.
Sherlock Holmes
Mary Jane Kelly. Maria Jose Kabara.
With that, she ventures outside and into the blistering cold, leaving John and William alone in the silent, empty bar.
"I've had practice." Sherlock is unable to resist impertinence, even in the eyes of death. He's referring, obviously, to the fact that he's been pretend-dead for two years—but he tries to shake off the strange vision of himself on the rooftop at Bart's.
Sherlock nods. “Need I remind you that a killer is running free?”
Sorry in advance for the typos. You can think of each one as a tiny little mystery I left behind for you to solve. Great work, you genius, you.
“You must be brilliant,” John says with true admiration.
“Noted, and already forgotten.” John glares across the table, standing tall, his shoulders wide. “And if you continue to fuck with me rather than letting me go,” he utters, clenching his fists to his sides. “...
"Hmmm?"
“No. No, not at all. We’ve got a half dozen cases right now, and we will continue to take more. It’s just one investigation, my friend. And I’m looking forward to seeing what you make of it.” He smiles at him reassuringly.
The man waves his hand dismissively. “Go.”
He sets his phone back down and continues to doze lightly for a few minutes, his heart filling up as he thinks of the previous night. Obviously, he and Sherlock will need to talk about what happened, but for now, he just wants to bathe in the afterglow.
Sherlock blinks a few times, silently stunned. He looks at Molly in awe, then to John, then back to Molly, and finally, he takes her by the shoulders.
Soon, the morning comes, and the weeks and days and nights continue to go by. And somewhere between the blankets and the walls, it all fades back to a dream.
But he doesn’t wonder for long, because John smiles, and his smile is warmer than the sudden heat prickling at Sherlock’s ears.
He places kisses and small bite marks on John’s neck, continuing this rocking motion. He spreads John’s legs further apart with each one, bucking his hips with so much force that John wonders if their trousers will be ripped open.
“There is
"What did you regret?" Sherlock asks.
John thinks he’s misheard, but when he looks up at him, he sees that he's still wearing the same guilt-ridden, distraught expression.
Sherlock would have to be mad to do so.
"Let’s see," he says quietly. He slides his fingers delicately over the side of Sherlock's neck, and it sends another jolt of electricity through Sherlock’s body. He applies a bit of pressure there, causing Sherlock to wince in pain.
"You okay, Sherlock?" John asks, just as Sherlock can sense himself returning to reality.
After he takes a moment to collect himself, Sarah appears besides him, handing him a blanket and a glass of water.
Mycroft looks to John, seeking confirmation.
Sherlock pauses, his sandwich halfway to his mouth. He sets it back down, crinkling his forehead with confusion. “Why would I do that?”
A moment of silence; a surge of palpable tension in the air.
“Not long. Thirty minutes, maximum. Any longer than that, and Mycroft will notice the cameras have been shut off, and he’ll lose his shit.”
He thought of John then. He thinks of him now. It’s obvious that John Watson is the best person in the world. How could anyone argue otherwise?
so bad.
"Fine." He exhales, adjusting himself to a seated position. "I'll drink with you."
Sherlock speaks through clenched teeth. "I would prefer to die."
Sarah sighs. “I’m so sorry, love.”
William lays his head peacefully on his stomach and murmurs a sleepy good morning. His voice fills the emptiness in John’s chest, and the pain seems to disappear. And when he touches John, all of his loneliness fades into a barely-there memory; a brief chapter in another person’s story.
“Wasn’t offering.” Sherlock quickly makes for the other room, because he does
John’s nose bumps against his. “You are. But Sherlock, I... I don’t know if this is a good idea.”
Their days largely emulate life before John's injury, the one clear difference being that John no longer goes with Sherlock on cases. John is not thrilled about this arrangement. He misses the adrenaline; the marvelous experience of watching Sherlock's phenomenal genius-at-work as he solves a crime. Alas, he’s had no luck trying to discuss it with Sherlock, who is quite masterful at diverting the conversation elsewhere.
"Alright. On the count of three. One…"
Apparently, it takes a lot of energy to bask in the glow of being fake newlyweds, because that’s exactly what he does.
Millions of tiny flames, and it doesn't come close to the unbridled love he feels for John, nor the knowledge that John feels the same.
“Sorry. You just seem agitated. Bit worrisome, is all.”
“If it will make you feel better; if it will make you stop talking about it, I will use an app, and I will find a stranger to kiss.”
Sherlock's hand in John’s is not. It's very, very pleasant, in fact. It fits as if it were tailor made for John's hand alone: effortless. Instinctual. Amazing, fantastic, brilliant.
“One evening at the restaurant,” Sarah continues, “I served a charming man in a business suit who took a liking to me instantly. He spent fifty dollars on his meal and tipped me two hundred. I was flattered, but chalked it up to luck—until he visited my section a week later, and the week after that, and the week after that. Each time, his bill amounted to the same, but each time, he tipped me the same two hundred dollars.”
John shifts in his armchair, visibly uncomfortable. “Y-Y-yeah, I… heard you the first time, but, erm..." he sputters. “The solution to
“Oh, fuck.” John leaps from his chair, knocking over a tray full of quarters, sending them pouring to the ground with a loud pitter-patter. He ignores it, making his way towards the elevator.
Sherlock pulls himself up and dashes to his bedroom, dialing The Woman's number on his way.
Sarah begins to speak, but as she does, a low bass note booms from the speakers, and John hears none of the words coming from her mouth.
William purses his lips together, lowering his head.
Sherlock stops what he’s doing immediately. He looks up from his laptop, steadily meeting John’s gaze, and he smiles brightly at him. “Good morning.”
“I’m...simply trying to figure out why you seem suddenly...different, somehow. Did you hit your head?”
Sherlock aligns himself with John's opening, sets a kiss to John's inner ankle, and then the other. He circles the head of his cock at the center a few times, teasing until John’s pressing against him, desperate and begging hoarsely for him to enter.
“Oooh,” Gabriela says with amusement. “Wearing sunglasses and a sports cap at the penny slots. You sure you haven’t been to Vegas before?”
Sherlock reaches for the blade just as the door swings open and Donovan pops in.
“Mmm. Promise?”
Mary's grip tightens around her knees. “Quite a lot, I suppose. My own role in this mission, to begin with. But I’ve already risked a lot by simply getting you here.”
John lifts his hands to the sides of Sherlock's head, gently raking his fingers through his curls. "I love you," he says, looking him square in the eye. He coaxes Sherlock forwards until their foreheads rest together. "I can't begin to tell you how much you've taught me as well, you utterly breathtaking, extraordinary genius."
After that, Sherlock says nothing more on the topic. He simply gazes openly at him, as though he’s waiting for him to say something profound.
But it's not until John combs his fingers through his hair that he begins to truly lose control. They drift over his scalp, tugging lightly at his curls, and it's positively earth-shattering. Sherlock's body twists and turns, and his moans become near-whimpers, and he thinks he might even be saying John's name.
“Song of Songs,” Moriarty murmurs, his face hovering against Sherlock’s. “I opened myself to my beloved, but my beloved had turned and gone. My heart went out to him as he spoke. I searched for him but did not find him; I called him but he did not answer.”
I’ll never get tired of writing scenes where Sherlock stumbles and John catches him. This is probably my 89th version of it. It’s just so soft, especially when he touches his hair. 🥺🥺🥺
“Marci?!” John exclaims. He slumps forwards a bit into Molly, and she guides him to a chair where he can sit down. “What are you doing here?” he asks. “Is Stamford okay?” He swallows nervously, his eyes falling to her midsection. “And, um—aren’t you supposed to be pregnant?“
He arrives at Sarah’s apartment at half past nine. The party is well underway. The place smells of sweat and vapes and cheap beer, and downtempo music booms from speakers. People at various levels of intoxication laugh and snog and murmur in the dim light.
“The gun you used to shoot Mary. Where is it?”
Sherlock huffs dramatically. "No!" He's sure he's grinning like an idiot. "I mean. You don't typically speak to me in that manner. Ever. And the playful, childish banter? And the touching? Oh, the touching. The petting!"
Sherlock thinks of dragging his tongue over John's slick chest. He thinks of removing the towel from John's waist and worshipping the treasure that lies beneath. And as the kiss lingers, it quickly steers into new territory—Sherlock can't fight it.
He doesn’t say this aloud. Where would he even begin? What are two people to talk about when they’ve got less than ten minutes before they part ways indefinitely?
“We should probably put your gun away, just to be safe.”
"Lestrade."
Sherlock sighs. “Yes,” he acknowledges, silently cursing him for never failing to recall these types of things. “But—
“It makes me happy to say it. Although my cheeks seem to be strained from smiling so much.”
John’s jaw drops. “Holy shit.”
,” he says. “Sometimes I wish you could see yourself through my eyes, you know. How much you’ve grown in the past two years. Even after all this time, your brilliance never ceases to amaze me, Sherlock. You're so invaluable, both in your talent and your friendship. I feel incredibly fortunate to experience the joy of both.”
“Oh. Does it bother you?”
“Sherlock?”
“No.” Sherlock picks up the bottle of wine to pour himself a glass. His stomach growls.
William finally releases him completely, and John feels it deep down in his bones—like the air has been ripped from his lungs. He closely regards the man before him, searching for a sign that he’ll reconsider. And though he’s stopped crying, his face remains blanketed with a stoic sadness—and there’s no question that he’s made up his mind.
William smiles warmly at her. “Of course, Doctor Hooper. I want to be sure you make it home safe.”
"If I'm going to relieve some of the tension, I'll need a better angle to work with."
“Come look at this,” Sherlock insists.
“Look, Sherlock. I don’t know
"He's already done that."
He leans away from Sherlock to look him in the eye. "They're sending me home tomorrow. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner. I guess I just wasn’t sure how.”
“What?” John asks giddily. “What is it?”
"Endeavouring to be." Sherlock takes another brownie and offers it to John. “Join me?”
You may have heard about the Oxford murders, a string of serial killings that occurred a few years ago. After the fifth, a man named Moriarty wrote a letter to the police confessing to the crimes.
John lifts an eyebrow. “Mycroft?”
"Your neck is absolutely exquisite," John remarks softly. He keeps kissing his neck, over and over—there isn't an inch of it that he doesn't kiss. His tongue peeks from his mouth, working simultaneously with his lips, turning the kisses into dangerously arousing swirls and nibbles. But it's when he begins sucking lightly at Sherlocks skin that Sherlock loses control.
“Sherlock!” A haughty voice calls out. John instantly recognises it; it's Mycroft, Sherlock's brother. He approaches the two of them, dressed in a bespoke suit. He's accompanied by a man in his early thirties with black and silver hair who appears to be an
“My attorney!” John exclaims, wrapping her in a hug. “Gab! Oh my god, are you...are you hurt?” he leans back, studying her face. “Where is The Woman?”
His lips part, but his throat is dry, and no words come out.
“He’s
John simply chuckles at his observation.
For several moments, they say nothing, but stare at one another reverently. Then, John gets onto his knees in the bed. He drapes his legs over Sherlock, lowering his body down to straddle him.
“John,” he whimpers softly. “Oh, god. John. ”
“Meet me in front of the El Cortez at seven o’clock sharp. I’ll have a car waiting for us. It shouldn’t take much longer than an hour to get there.”
"That's not a Chateau Latour, is it?"
John gulps down his (hatefully exquisite) drink. He’s feeling things again. Many things. Mostly profound irritation. His heart beats fast as his helpless gaze wanders to the bar. William, with a cigarette and a ghost of a smile at his lips, gracefully wraps his scarf around his neck and walks out back.
“It's not—” John shakes his head. “It’s just, lately I've had—” he inhales.
But then, something else happens. As Sherlock leans away, his cool skin glides across Brook’s stubbled cheek, and he experiences yet another, wholly unfamiliar urge. His breath catches. Giving in to the urge, he drags his lips over Brook’s and softly begins to kiss them.
“Liz!” Marci kicks her under the table. “Keep it in your pants. We've only just met these two!”
"Well made," Sherlock says against his. "And John…"
He had the audacity to tell me I look
one actually supposed to do when one has just kissed his best friend—the man he loves—and said best friend didn't want to be kissed?
“The difficult part of it all,” Sherlock says, “…and also the most irritating…is that Mycroft’s not entirely wrong. About my tendency to go off the deep end when faced with certain emotions. It’s happened before, and I’ve ended up in very dark places. Mycroft has always been the one to pull me out.”
He grins widely. "That’s the fastest I’ve ever gotten drinks from the bar! And they’re on the house! Except for yours, John. William said something about you insisting on buying.”
John stands before an antique mirror, wearing a grey bespoke tuxedo. His black shoes are almost unbearably shiny, and a sprig of dried lavender is pinned to the collar of his jacket. He stares at his reflection, fully knowing that he’s looking at himself, but the man he sees feels unfamiliar. The dark skin around his eyes has grown far more prominent, and his hair is cut very short, embedded with wisps of grey.
"Sherlock," he says softly. "May I take you to bed?"
(See the end of the chapter for
On the sixth night of their routine, while they watch television, their fingers interlocked—he gets an idea. Without thinking too much, and without explanation, he lifts John's hand to his mouth, turns it over, and places a kiss to his open palm.
“Wow,” he remarks eloquently.
“You’re so lovely that it’s actually painful to tear one’s eyes from you. I know; I speak from experience.”
Latin: “Remember death.” In layman's terms: remember that one day, you will die.
"You as well," Sherlock says. "It's always nice to see you, John."
"Well. First..." Sherlock curls his fingertips beneath the fold of the towel. "I would remove this."
“When I say what?” John inquires.
Ah, so the Sherlock of this universe hasn’t yet been told.
John forces a smile, though he actually feels quite nauseous. He searches for someone—anyone—to take their order who isn’t William. But no such luck. So he inhales a breath of determination and walks right to the bar where William stands. The man’s gorgeous eyes flit to him and quickly away. He combs his gorgeous fingers through his gorgeous hair and turns, darting to the opposite end of the bar. He doesn’t give John a word or a second glance.
Every day, John loves Sherlock more.
Sherlock's expression grows more and more bewildered, and John does not blame him one bit. "Since when do you call her that?"
Sherlock feels a rush of blood flowing to his face and ears. John is using his Captain Watson voice, and when he pulls out that trick, Sherlock can’t follow orders quickly enough. He bites his lip to keep from responding “Yes, Captain," and flops down onto his back.
Christ. John has been so distracted that he looked
He looks at him the same way he always has: as though he’s the most beautiful thing in the universe. As though he’s hung the moon. As though he's more valuable than all of the world's gold. As though he could easily peer directly into his soul, if such a thing existed.
John singlehandedly pops open the lid and pours the lube messily over his fingers, sliding them down Sherlock's skin to the small of his back.
“You were perfectly capable of walking then. I already knew it; you didn’t.”
, and especially when his lips are heart-shaped and pink like cotton candy and full and beautiful like
They may no longer be in their perfect little corner—but here Sherlock is, standing in front of John, waiting for him to say how he feels.
“Brilliant!” Mary replies. “That’s likely where he is. Let’s go.”
"Come over here and you'll see."
Sherlock digs his fingers into the sofa beneath him, fumbling at it, overcome with the need to touch something. Then, he remembers that John is something he can touch, so he raises his arms behind himself, clasping the back of John's head. He pulls him in, pressing him closer until their kiss is deeper than the ocean.
"And although Lestrade is an idiot, he does have a point: they've been happy for us all along, and we finally have a chance to partake in
He goes back to his phone.
“I thought you’d been shot,” he chokes out, touching every piece of John that he can, just to be sure he’s still there.
“That’s where it gets
“They’ve been coming here together for quite some time, you know. Same spot—a standing reservation on Thursdays at 7:30. Though I often see them here on weekends as well.”
That's good enough for now.
There are two layers of clothing between them, but John clenches at him, begging him to rut harder, hoping that somehow he will penetrate him. So William slides his hands down to John’s knees and grips them firmly, spreading them as far as they will go, pressing against him relentlessly; and their mouths and tongues slide together as they gasp and groan in between the filthy words escaping their mouths.
"But kissing is not something you and I do!" Sherlock hisses. His gaze shifts suddenly. "Kissing
“Sherlock." John takes a step towards him, fighting back the urge to smooth his hair away from his eyes. He reminds himself that
They fall into bed together, just as Sherlock dreamt they would. There is touching, and kissing, and heat, and sighs of adoration.
He hears a fuzzy sound from his earbuds before Gabriela’s voice comes through. “Hey, friend. Can you hear me?”
"Nice words." There's a glimmer in his eyes as they wander over Sherlock's face. "I could tell you that you're brilliant and beautiful."
He definitely wasn’t expecting William to meet him at the entrance. He wasn’t expecting to be dragged indoors by the drenched lapels of his coat; or for William to kiss him as though he’s been longing to kiss him for a hundred years. He wasn’t expecting him to taste of vodka and tears and cigarettes, and he wasn’t expecting the soft, sweet whimpers of affection.
“Molly,” he says happily, resting his chin on her head. “Hey.”
Sherlock’s eyes fall, and he takes a moment before responding. John braces himself for a difficult answer.
As they climb the front steps, John’s heart pumps so fast he thinks he may pass out. His thoughts have mostly gone blank other than the spinning out of Sherlock’s name on repeat. They reach the door, and Mary nods her head. John knocks. They wait. There’s no answer.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “What do you mean,
John’s index finger begins to move in circles around Sherlock’s arsehole. Then, he feels another finger join in. Both fingers slide into him at once, and he inhales sharply, his body searing with burning pleasure.
They stand frozen, knowing that if they cross this line it can’t be uncrossed. So they breathe steadily, waiting for permission or a reason.
Sherlock has been sharing his bed with John since the day he came home. This is indisputably for medical reasons.
“What rules?”
Today, there will be no fear—only fond, flirtatious glances. And laughter—the kind that begins below the belly button and bubbles up through the chest and rolls down the cheeks in the form of tears. No fear, only stolen kisses, and fingertips laced through fingertips, tracing hip bones and rib cages and clavicles.
It will be here in the morning—we can pick up where we left off after your exam.” Brook stands, taking his coat. “Patience brings peace. Proverbs 15:18.”
We talked about the weather. We talked about binary code. We talked about the Bible, and what it truly means to be saved.
Gabriela turns and walks back to Sarah. They smile at one another, and she sinks to the ground, spreads Sarah open, and fucks her with her tongue.
Nobody says a single thing for several moments.
“You okay?” John asks.
"Ham on rye. With extra pickles. What's your favourite?"
So he sets a final chaste kiss to John’s lips, creating a trail of them across his jaw before resting his head in the crook of his neck.
Light pours in. Bloody awful light. John rubs his eyes for far to long, hoping he’ll go back to sleep. “Already?” he groans.
Sherlock jabs him in the chest with his elbow. He yelps in pain. “—not sure of the wedding date,” he concludes. His gaze wanders back to the succulent collection. “Though we could use a talented florist.” He grins politely at her. “Do you do such arrangements?”
John cries out; an even mixture of shock, pleasure and ecstasy. "Christ, Sherlock," he breathes. "You are a fucking marvel."
Sherlock is trembling all over with anger, his heart racing so fast he can barely speak. "If you didn't want me to figure it out...why on earth did you set yourself up to be caught?"
So John runs. He runs for Sherlock; to get him his life back. He runs so the two of them can finally be together without fear. He runs so that Sherlock can return to the family he’s loved and lost.
“Morning,” John says, envisioning a million good ways and bad ways Sherlock could respond to a single word.
That's right. John is kissing Sherlock. Sherlock is kissing John. They're kissing.
Oh, it's sensational.
"I don't want to think about it." Sherlock jerks his head away, unbothered by the pull of Moriarty's unrelenting grip.
Mary rolls her eyes at him, but there’s no malice there. “Sit,” she commands, pointing to the sofa.
“His hair is completely white.”
Gabriela bends over to pick up the book. As she stands, an index card falls from the pages and floats onto the floor. She kneels back down to read it. "Find the woman. She will tell you where you need to go.”
But this time, the planchette stays put.
You were right. -SH
“Yes.” Growing ever more impatient, Sherlock wraps every limb at his disposal around John’s body. "Now." He kisses the top of his head. “Have sex with me.”
He pulls John's hand away, his voice fraught with disapproval. “Seagram’s? Really, John? If you want to kill us both, a liter of petrol would taste better.”
John softly presses his lips to his, and everything halts, and there is no longer any doubt.
More silence. Sherlock is starting to realise that it's a bit too hot in their flat; his face is flushed and his heart is pumping, and his body feels quite tense.
Sherlock beams at him. "Oh, yes! You're right! That's fantastic, John! You've got your memory back!"
He brushes the snow from his coat sleeve and huffs a goodbye under his cloudy breath. If nothing else comes from this insanity-fuelled excursion, at least he can say he got some closure.
Christ. John would absolutely
Sherlock and the others stare expectantly at the wooden piece, waiting for it to move. It doesn’t.
Sherlock looks him in the eye, and John can feel himself sweating as he pins him with his gaze. “Alright, then.”
William turns back to him. “It’s been awhile since I’ve played that one, so I apologize if—he pauses. “It’s just that I very rarely play in front of other people—”
Sherlock sprawls out, propping his legs onto the arm of the sofa, eyes drifting closed immediately as his head lolls back into John's lap.
“Neither have I,” John says.
Once they're both ready, he takes Sherlock by the hips and helps him into his lap. Sherlock wraps his legs around his waist and straddles him; wraps his arms around his shoulders and continues to kiss him. The kiss is dirty. Messy. Unrestrained.
“It worked for a purpose,” Sherlock says. “In a contained environment which differs substantially from real life.”
“What else would you like to say?” Donovan inquires.
John envisions Sarah’s next door neighbor, Gabriela, and he allows his mind to wander. There was a time he may have fancied her bit, and he’s certainly not the only one. With her wavy chestnut hair that cascades down her back, her silky olive skin, and her long, long legs—she turns the heads of men and women wherever she goes.
How is it possible to love someone and know nothing about them?
"What was that?" John heard him fine. He just wants to hear him say it again in that deep, sexy French accent.
“Thank
“Can I have one, honey?” Gabriela asks, biting her lip coquettishly.
John straightens his back, clenches his fists, and gives the man his most solemn glare. "I could be wrong," he says in a low, threatening voice. "But I'm pretty sure that's none of your god-damned business."
Sherlock lifts an eyebrow, grinning at him as he pulls on his coat. “There is plenty I can do.”
“It was,” John whispers gently.
"Ugh," Sherlock groans.
“You already are.” William takes a ticket from his billfold and slaps it onto the counter. “How will you be paying?”
"Stop talking," Sherlock retorts.
John takes another step in. “You look a bit...” he pauses. “Perhaps you ought to rest.”
The rain continues to pour around them.
John’s lungs are actually probably imploding now, and he really needs to sit down, because his knees have gone weak. But he doesn’t. Instead, he breathes in more cold air and hears himself calling out William’s name. Feels his legs carrying him down the alleyway behind the building. Feels his hands, banging and pulling on the back door.
"You shouldn't do it anymore."
Sherlock grins before turning to go. “Besides,” he says over his shoulder. “There’s no need to worry. I’ve got Molly to help me.”
"Are you thinking of an animal?" John asks.
“Don’t kill Sherlock yet, I told her!” His voice is suddenly very loud. “We aren’t ready! Don’t mess up the plan, Miss Morstan!” The stairs creak as he climbs the deck. “She never liked to do things if it wasn’t her way. Shame. She was one of my most talented killers.”
“I would love that,” Sherlock says, not missing a beat.
He utters these words, his body still trembling through his orgasm; and then he repeats them, the words a hot gust of breath in John’s ear.
The sun is high, now, and the air is warm, and the ground is firm beneath their feet. Side-by-side, they run as fast as their legs will take them.
John inhales. “Alright, then.” He pauses for a moment, clearing his throat. “I’ve got two very important questions. To start: where is Sherlock now?”
She crouches down in front of him, reaches across his lap, and sets her hand over the one he’s got wrapped around his cock.
“That’s lovely,” he says.
"John," Sherlock says. “One more thing. Please?”
Although there’s a pained expression on his face, Brook is no longer able to resist his pleas. "Alright. Yes, Sherlock. I'll help you solve the case."
“John, wait.”
"Look up at me, Sherlock," John says. "I want to see your beautiful face."
(deep) down—that doesn't dislike being saved. It causes him to feel strange things like "protected" and "cared for" and "safe," and those are things he doesn't feel very often.
Sherlock’s arms are around John’s waist, and John’s arms are around Sherlock’s shoulders, their bodies basking in the warmth of one another.
They step out of the car and onto the tarmac. Gabriela welcomes them with a hug, followed by some egregious winking and congratulations for what sounded like a very pleasant car ride.
"Uhhhh." Sarah frowns at him. "Perhaps you should sit down for a second, John."
Her voice is what triggers his memory. She’s got a British accent now, but before, when they were having drinks at The Strand, her accent was definitely American. It was on Stamford’s birthday, and she was there with her friend Elizabeth, and she was flirtatious and all smiles and touched John quite a lot.
John laughs, sucking playfully at Sherlock’s bottom lip. Sherlock groans with disapproval (although he approves wholeheartedly), scolding John with a nudge of his tongue, and John repays him with a large sweeping motion of his own.
"You don't use a pipe in the bathroom, Sherlock."
John’s pauses again. “Figured what out?” Sensing that William knows much more than he does about Sarah’s rendezvous, he braces himself for the answer.
“John.” Sherlock’s body goes stiff, like he’s been turned to stone; his skin becomes cold.
Sherlock presses a light kiss to his sweaty temple. John tries not to think of the ticking clock moving them unfailingly towards the end of their time together. So as they lie there, breaths becoming aligned, he simply closes his eyes to savor this crystalline moment.
”John. You’re amazing and I love you,” she sniffles. “And I’ll remember what you said. I promise.” She reaches her hand up and ruffles his hair. “But only if you promise to live by those words, too, yeah?”
John tilts his head and holds his gaze, smiling slightly. “But you don’t.”
He swallows thickly before speaking—John wonders if he’s holding back tears. “When we first met, I am aware that I was quite rude..."
”Indeed,” John says. “Born and raised. You?”
Before Sherlock can answer, rain begins to pour from the sky in big, heavy drops. It's all the answer John needs.
“No…” John swallows. “I suppose not.”
“Why not?”
“I’d love to.” John pulls him back in, sealing their mouths together. They continue kissing as if the kiss will last forever; as if New Scotland Yard won't quickly ruin the crime scene with their profound incompetence.
Why did Sherlock say it? Because
John. Loves. Him.
He needs to see William again.
“Ooooh!” Molly claps her hands together enthusiastically. “That sounds like fun!”
He’s not as much of an idiot as most people
He pulls himself up to a seated position in his bed. “Somehow, you look even lovelier than you did when you left this morning," he says. He knows it's the last time he'll get to say so, though it's far from the last time it will be true.
He kisses as though he's waiting for John to take lead. But John won't. Not this time. For now, Sherlock is calling the shots.
John brushes his nose against Sherlock’s, and Sherlock exhales with a shiver. “Must I remind you, Holmes, that I’m a doctor? If I’m ill at the moment, it’s likely you’ve already caught it. But we will care for one another, will we not?”
“Pardon?” Sherlock is appropriately perplexed, and his throat is suddenly drier than the Sahara.
"Sherlock," he admonishes. "What are you doing? You're getting cold and wet."
An expression of what seems like disappointment flashes over Sherlock’s features.
Moriarty's words hit Sherlock like a punch in the gut; bleed into his brain from his ears.
"The wildebeest, I would imagine. A hyena here and there. Zebras, horses. Cows. Geese, perhaps."
“Earlier when?”
"This is all
He peeks down at the clothes he’s currently wearing. Nothing out of the ordinary; a silk shirt and grey slacks, impeccable and neatly-pressed. He’s fairly certain that his hair is mussed after having clutched it in frustration during his research, and that his five o’clock shadow has reached an eight or a nine.
As soon as she's gone, John and Sherlock continue honing their kissing techniques. Sherlock tells John that he's a very quick study, but that he thinks he may need much more kissing practice himself.
Sherlock smiles, kisses him back, and says: "I know."
Sherlock bobs his head, eyes going a bit blank as he appears to reflect on his and Molly’s interactions. "Alright." He looks back at John. "Anyone else?”
In him, there is a void—a hollowness that can’t be put into words. He is not plain—but his smooth, childlike features are offset by his stern jaw and soulless onyx eyes. He’s slight, but his shadow stretches across the garden like the legs of a spider.
“Good afternoon, Doctor Hooper." He deems Molly's presence worthy of a formal greeting at best; her allegations worthy of no acknowledgement at all. Joining her at the examination table, he looks upon a male in his early fifties whose neck is covered in dark bruises and lesions. "Strangulation," he surmises. "Accidental."
Sherlock uncrosses his arms, flopping them down to his sides. "Then I'll ask you one more time. John, what on earth has gotten into you?"
John doesn't stop laughing as he reaches over to pick it up. "Haven’t I shown you how to change her text alert?"
"Stop it," John replies with a grin. "At least I haven't taken to spending my days on the ground like some wild animal."
Sherlock stops typing. He looks up, and the two men gaze at one another adoringly over John’s stolen keyboard.
He shakes his head. “It’s nothing, love. It’s not about you, anyway. Just issues I’ve got to work out on my own. Alright?”
John detects a hint of moisture in her eyes when she says “you’re welcome.”
John chuckles, shaking his head incredulously. “Every time. You never miss an opportunity make fun of my stature, do you?”
Sherlock regards the miniature buffet lain out before him. “You ordered dim sum,” he notes.
Catherine Eddowes. Christina Everson.
The first of the Oxford murders occurs four months later.
The man rests his elbows on the table, fingers interwoven, and sets his head on his hands. “I’ve got a few questions first, Mister Watson.”
John moves swiftly and gracefully. He spins Sherlock’s body around, pressing him into the kitchen counter, and Sherlock succumbs to his movements like a ragdoll. With John’s fingers wrapped around both of his wrists, he moves them to the countertop, lightly pinning them behind his waist.
"You shouldn't be here."
“Lord, same,” Sherlock adds.
Molly sets the envelope in John’s hands. He stares down at it for a few moments before opening it. Tries to take in the enormity of this, Sherlock’s gift.
John stirs. "Hey," he says with a yawn and a smile. "You’re home."
He frowns at her. “Christ,” he mutters as she attempts to lick coffee from the back of her spoon. Honestly, she appears to be no older than eighteen or nineteen. “How old are you, if you don’t mind my asking?”
“You made it.” Sherlock spins John towards his wheelchair and carefully seats him there.
William laughs. “I always assumed our sex would be utterly mind-blowing, John, but I wasn’t expecting temporary amnesia.” He pulls the sheet back. "I suppose I understand." As his gaze settles on one of the portraits, he appears overcome with disdain. “I’ve deleted Buckingham Palace from my brain a few times as well.”
He didn't plan for it this time, either. He blames the macarons. And The Great British Bake Off.
As John breathes steadily to stifle his reapproaching rage, a voice calls out to him.
“Hm. Right. How lovely for you,” John responds curtly. “Actually, we’re just heading out, so—“
Sweet murmurs of affection, spurred by longing, lodge in their throats, captured by one another’s mouths. They cling desperately to every part of each other they can reach, as if they’re discovering the curves of their bodies for the first time. They can’t contain the heat of their passion; of all the yearning of the past and all the yearning that they know will come. They kiss until their lips are bruised; dragging their tongues over bare skin for relief, but leaving tiny welts and bruises there as well. They rock together, lips returning to each other as the curves of their bones bury into soft skin.
"Fake! Married!" Sherlock pouts, and when John begins laughing again, Sherlock tries very hard not to acknowledge the fascinating way his face lights up. He diverts his focus instead to a bouquet of flowers in a vase across the room—a gift from one of John's coworkers.
Lestrade purses his lips together, nodding thoughtfully. "Well. That's a surprise. But you can't blame me for assuming it's been longer, you know? You're practically already married. Always together, making lovey dovey eyes at one another, giggling like school boys. It was quite obvious from the very start that you were mad about each other, no question."
He keeps me grounded when things inside and outside get a bit too loud
Sherlock shrugs. “Out of all the things you could possibly be, I like
Her name was Meena Natale. She was an ICU nurse—twenty-eight years old; happily married, no children, no known enemies, and no history of health problems. She died by asphyxiation—strangled by her killer. Oddly, trace amounts of cyanide were also found on her lips, though none was detected internally.
Sherlock fully vacates himself from the conversation. He feels that intolerable sensation in the pit of his stomach again. And this time, his pain must be apparent, because John immediately falls silent.
John frowns at him. “
Her lips curve upwards into a smile. “Mycroft may have a flair for the dramatic, but he’s a very good brother. Even though the two of them drive each other absolutely mad, Sherlock is the most important person in his life. And he’s the only family Sherlock still has after...you know.”
Make that six and a half.
Even better—his pretend husband, as promised, helps care for him whenever he can. This is how John inadvertently (though perhaps, fatefully) learns that Sherlock is stronger than he looks. It also (definitely fatefully) leads to their first of many kissing rehearsals.
John shivers at the sensation of Sherlock’s gentle lips tickling his skin. “You know...should you decide to go back to solving murders, I could be your partner. With my medical knowledge and your powers of deduction, we’d make a great team.”
Sherlock proceeds to make a gagging noise. "From the bottom of my heart: no. And please...don't make me food. Ever. Again."
Fear and dread rise from Sherlock’s stomach to his throat as he starts to realise what John is saying.
Sherlock spins the chair to face the bed. “Now I’m going to push you.”
John looks down at it. “What do I owe?”
“Legend has it,” Sherlock says valiantly, “...that kissing tall, handsome geniuses on All Hallows’ Eve will protect one from the cold, bony grasp of death.”
John knocks once more. He listens. But there are no sounds coming from inside; no voices, no footsteps approaching, nor shifting of objects.
That vision seems to have played itself out, but as he faces his own mortality, his brain becomes filled with flights of fancy.
“It’s raining,” John says.
“We’re still downtown. Just a short walk from our hotel. You were in some sort of...casino security office. I knew where to find you, though, thanks to Molly’s brilliant spy skills, and Irene’s knowledge of the area.”
John beams; Sherlock knows it means he feels the same.
”It’s fine. We don't have to talk about it."
“John.”
"Being polite is certainly an effort," Sherlock states. "Too much of an effort. Being disliked by everyone is far easier."
Brook glances down at the relic. “Oh. Yes, thank you. It belonged to my grandmother Joan, a devout Catholic. She’s the one who raised me.”
"Were you planning on staying down there for awhile?" John asks. "Because I had an idea of something we could do to fill the time."
"There are no wild bears in Africa, Sherlock."
And that's when all of the pieces fall together—so sharp and immediate that Sherlock wonders, to this day, if Brook set himself up on purpose.
The alleyways are filled with people crowded around the bars, but he pushes through them, breathing in the icy air until he’s sure his lungs will explode. He’s terrified and ecstatic and wants to scream loudly for a half dozen reasons, but he tries to focus on the end goal: taking William into his arms. Brushing his fingers through his curls. Telling him he loves him, and that his love isn’t going to fade. Kissing him, if he’ll allow it.
They're not falling; they're flying.
Once Sherlock and John return to their flat, they remove their costumes and carry out their bedtime routine; it all happens much more silently than Sherlock would like.
John wraps his arms beneath Sherlock's thighs to spread them open, and he uses his tongue and his fingers to open him up. Sherlock gasps and digs his fingernails into the rug to keep himself grounded, his body rolling and twisting with the rhythm John's tongue creates. John thrusts Sherlock's legs open wider, buries his face deeper and deeper, and the sounds coming from Sherlock's mouth are nearly feral.
“Yes.”
Sherlock tries not to lose himself in this feeling, whatever this feeling is. But the moans of pleasure that rip from his throat can't be stifled. He feels the cold sweat on John's neck, feels his chest rising and falling as he works to regulate his own breath, hears the words he murmurs, the curses and the blessings and the prayers.
John shrugs. "Just something I've had lying around for a bit."
“I...” Sherlock savours the taste of John’s lips. “I am. Yes. Very much. As long as it’s alright with you.”
The kiss is wet and deep and heated, and they breathe into it heavily as Gabriela's hands roam beneath the hem of Sarah’s skirt.
He wanders through the downtown area aimlessly for quite some time before he reminds himself that he ought to call a cab.
“Y-Yes.” John audibly swallows, savoring the musky scent of cologne. His skin tingles at the way William murmurs his name—the way his long, delicate fingers wander beneath his jawline. Closing his eyes, he melts into William’s touch.
Shortly after, Molly drops by. She’s equally giddy about the fake marriage. She jokes about throwing them a reception. Mrs. Hudson loves the idea. John secretly does as well. Sherlock reminds them that he hates parties. Molly and Mrs. Hudson discuss the details anyway.
“Just you. Sergeant Lestrade will escort Mister Watson back to his hotel and keep a close eye on him until he returns home.”
"Oh, yes please!" Sherlock’s stomach rumbles as he reaches for the tray.
Time skips again. One second, John is looking down at her body—and the pool of blood forming beneath it. The next, Sherlock—who is very much alive—is embracing him fiercely, shaking like a leaf.
John sets his other hand onto Sherlock’s chest, and onto the protective vest that he wears. Though it’s less of a vest and more of an undershirt. John has never seen anything like it, but he’s sure—
He never, ever thought it would come to this. Poor observation skills were to blame for him not to have noticed John’s love. But as for himself, not realising how madly and deeply in love he is with John—what a fool he’d been.
John sweeps his tongue over the seam of Sherlock's mouth until it parts, sucking delicately at his full bottom lip and eliciting a small moan from his partner. Eagerly, they wrap themselves up in each other’s arms, brushing their tongues together until they’ve run out of breath again.
"Yes. Yes, Alright." Anderson brings his phone up, muttering the words as he types a message. "Dear...Sally. I love...the way...you are
He’s becoming all the things he’s spent so much time trying not to become.
”She really is,” William says softly. “And she seems to have taken an instant liking to
It's the best evening Sherlock's had in a long time. With every breath of laughter, every word that comes from John's mouth, he feels a rush of affection.
John pulls away with a sharp inhale, bids him farewell, and returns to the bar to finish his Old Fashioned.
“I’m not going anywhere,” John murmurs. He reaches his hands up, softly cupping the back of Sherlock’s head. “I know you believe that your loneliness will protect you, but it won’t. Just look at all of the people in your life who love you."
: Sherlock, John, Mrs. Hudson
John wipes the saliva from his face. “No, no. I’m fine.”
“Your ID card was on your person when we...collected you, of course.”
John comes to a halt a few steps away from the bed. He certainly wasn’t expecting Sherlock to follow him, though it hinders his intention to vanish beneath the covers and dissociate from everything—and he hasn’t yet formed a backup plan.
Then, John’s cock begins to pulse, wildly and abruptly. His body seizes, and thick spurts of hot liquid pour into his hand.
“Where are you taking us, by the way?” John asks.
"Hello, Doctor Watson," she says with a friendly smile. "I noticed you’re my patient only just before coming in—and although I'm pleased to help you, if you think it might be a conflict of interest, we can request a reassignment."
There
John goes speechless and breathless and still, savoring every word and every inch of him. He lets his head fall back onto the pillow, basking in the scent of sweat and sex and Sherlock, surrounded by love on all sides.
"Absolutely. But before we do that—" John sighs. He knows he's got to tell him about leaving. He may as well just come right out with it. "I just wanted to, erm.”
William narrows his eyes. “Why on earth would that bother me?”
Yes. John loves him, doesn’t he.
It’s a text from Stamford.
Sherlock presses his lips together and pats the right pocket of his trousers. “If you don’t like the idea, it’s alright.”
His heart is tugging him in another direction, however. He finds himself longing to take a drink with John.
"May I see it? The card." John extends his hand.
"Yes, I've got it. Thank you."
It’s the final week of Sherlock’s second year at Oxford. As usual, he and Brook are engrossed in a late night investigation at the laboratory—just one result away from breaking open a case they’ve been working on for weeks.
(See the end of the chapter for
If this letter has made its way into your hands, it means that either I’ve died, or that Molly has given it to you despite my wishes. If the latter is indeed the case, please remind her that she has drunkenly poured her heart out to me many times, and I know just enough about her to be dangerous.
He stares through the clear window into the bar, where the lights are turned on, and blissfully, the curtains are still drawn. It’s closed for business, and empty except for Molly and William.
John laughs at him. "Just give me a chance to show you."
“Yes.”
“The police will be here
John stirs in his lap. He yawns, rubs his face for a few seconds, and opens his eyes, allowing them to adjust. As things seem to come into focus, however, they immediately widen with alarm.
"Keep it up, Holmes, and I will throw this glass of wine at you," John threatens.
As they walk into the building, John has a crushing feeling in his chest. The place is exactly as it had been a little over week ago, but with one very obvious, tall and beautiful and bright light missing. The lack of William there causes the place to be disturbingly quiet; the type of silent that's so persistent, it almost shatters your eardrums.
It's a cool evening, half past something or other. John tends to lose track of time when he and Sherlock are in bed together. Tonight, Sherlock's eyes are a shocking shade of blue-green, glowing aqua like the clear waters of the Aegean Sea.
The next part of John’s night is surprisingly pleasant. As the drinks keep coming, the four of them laugh for what feels like hours. Elizabeth and Stamford seem to be hitting it off, and he truly enjoys Marci’s company as well.
"Yeah?" John says this with the precise combination of surprise and relief Sherlock predicted. The question causes the first beat of hesitation in him since they awoke, but he doesn't stop driving their bodies together; doesn't let go of Sherlock, doesn't stop pressing warm kisses to his neck. "Alright. That's..." he quickly gives up searching for the words. "...yeah. Good to know, I suppose."
“So.” She stirs her coffee and lifts her eyes curiously. “How do you and William know one another?”
“Sherlock is absolutely right,” he says steadily. “We were pretending. One hundred percent.” He looks at Sherlock. “But it’s over now.”
"Same thing, really." John turns another page. "You just have to learn to breathe through your feet. And there are a hell of a lot more Journey songs."
For a fleeting moment, he feels Brook’s willingness to reciprocate: a sharp exhalation, a forward tilt of his head, the tightening of his grip on Sherlock’s shoulders.
“And what if he doesn’t come by then?” Sherlock asks, a glimmer of hope rising up within him.
The two of them continue to squabble flirtatiously, and John decides to lean into it.
He wraps his fingers over Sherlock’s thin wrist, and when he feels the life flowing beneath his skin, relief overtakes him, and he nearly collapses again.
“And why not?”
"So that's all? I suppose I could go ch—”
"Sort of. Metonym: a word, name, or expression used as a substitute for something else with which it is closely associated."
His face brushes against John’s cheek, hovering a hair’s width from his. He pauses, lowering his head. “There.”
"I'm--" John sputters as Sherlock rouses him with a deliberately restrained touch. "I'm yours, too. God, I'm yours, Sherlock. Wholly. Completely."
He meets Sarah and Gabriela at the back end, and Sarah explains why she came back there: at some point the prior evening, she’d apparently lost her wallet—so the two of them came to search the area.
He hasn’t even had William in his bed. Sure, he’s had him everywhere else: the floor. The table. The bathroom counter. The wall, the alleyway, the kitchen. And now, he’ll have him nowhere at all but his dreams.
But will normalcy even be possible after tonight? After their sweet words, and the even sweeter touching of fingertips?
Sigh. The lack of words they experienced was irritating, of course. And the Medieval acts of torture he spoke of were indeed ruthless and inhumane.
John’s hips lift involuntarily from the ground, and it occurs to him how badly he’s aching to be touched. He slides his hand below his waist and takes his twitching cock into his hand, still keeping up with every movement as William rides his tongue.
“Are you seriously asking me to piss off?” John asks, laughing uncomfortably.
He looks back downwards, and the face of the monster has returned. “My god,” he says with disgust. “Why, Sherlock? Why have you chosen this man over your very own life?”
He decides he should go. But as he turns to leave, the lights go off again, masking the room in blackness. In a few seconds, they turn back on.
John presses down on Sherlock’s chest, looking for a wound to cover, anywhere, anywhere—
They take John next door—to Gabriela's much quieter place—so they can continue their conversation.
Sherlock promptly closes his eyes. Because it might be the only thing to curtail him from touching John's cheeks, from feeling his body heat, from kissing his scruffy face off.
John’s lips tremble, overflowing with venom. “Pity that you didn’t.”
“Whatever feels natural, I suppose.” John is certainly not exhibiting any signs of intoxication or insanity. “But it’s alright, Sherlock. A response isn’t mandatory.”
Her gasp of excitement is so loud that she almost bursts his eardrums. "You were kissing, weren't you?!"
"Oh." John picks up his glass and takes a sip. Because he's avoiding the question. Sherlock waits.
The end. (For now.)
“Oh!” Molly interjects. “Perhaps she did have a gift, and she passed it to you.” She moves over, patting the spot in front of the ouija board. “You ought to try.”
When John dreams, he and William—Sherlock—are in a dark room with a fireplace, sitting comfortably in armchairs across from one another. Sherlock is dressed in a waistcoat, and his dark curls are slicked back, which does much more to enhance his already-high cheekbones. He smokes a pipe as he reads from a paper.
“It’s fine,” Sherlock says, even though he and Molly can no longer be friends. "Apparently only a genius can understand the—“
"You sure you want to do this, Sherlock? This isn't even the most complicated part."
John takes a deep breath and sighs. "Yes. As I said, it's a work in progress. I love and respect you far too much to treat you as though you're a prize for me to claim."
And although he's afraid, he feels a tiny grin on his face. "...but only because I wouldn't dream of going against my doctor's orders."
It's the only thing that makes sense. He picks up Sherlock's book—The Science of Deduction—and he points to a quote from the back.
“John, wait.”
"Me too!" He nearly spills his drink as he whisks himself across the room to join John.
John finds Sherlock’s crabbiness endearing. “Past your bedtime, is it, gramps?” he teases.
“Sherlock.” Molly reaches across the table and sets her hand over his in a gesture of solidarity. "Let me ask you frankly. Do you love him back?"
Sherlock exhales a heavy breath of relief, but his expression is somewhat mournful.
“Sometimes.” Sherlock continues toying with the stem, plucking seeds from it. “Sometimes not. It really just depends.”
"We made it," he pants.
Marci rolls her eyes and laughs. “Mike’s okay. And I was never actually pregnant—Sherlock was just being a dramatic arsehole.”
"Sherlock."
“Remember how my mother fell ill last year?” she asks.
“What of Moriarty?” Sherlock asks.
Elizabeth. As Mycroft says her name, John's chest aches. He thinks about how difficult this must be for her. It’s doubtful that she knew her best friend was a government agent who lied about her identity, and even more unlikely that she knew she was an assassin. Have they even informed her that Marci was actually Mary, and that she's been shot dead?
John kisses William. “I’d like to kiss you until the stars come out,” he tells him.
Sherlock gasps as his body goes stiff, tears stinging his eyes, and he pours his love out into John. John is so utterly awed and overwhelmed by his beauty that he can’t seem to catch his breath; without warning, his cock pulsates and he comes as well, untouched.
"You said you weren't very close with your parents. Why not?"
is not something you do. Is it?"
"Everyone needs a break once in a while. Even myself. Besides, if you didn’t save my life, I would never be able to take a case again. So being there to help you recover was a priority."
Over the following days, William crosses John’s mind more than he would like—inevitably stirring up a confusing mixture of rage and pining. Ugh. He hates everything about him, but he can’t shake him off. So he convinces himself that it’s not worth dwelling over, because there’s no way he’s getting involved with someone who sends such mixed signals. He’s done with that.
Sherlock squints at the final message, resisting the urge to throw his phone again. Oh, no. No, no, no.
"No, thank you." There’s no point. John is probably just going to fake divorce him, anway.
William acknowledges him with his characteristic aloofness, an unlit cigarette dangling from his dumb gorgeous mouth. “Sorry, sir. The bar is closed. I’m going on a cigarette break.”
pull your hair while you drive your fingernails into his skin, begging him not to stop? Does he—?”
They tear through the sky, welcomed by pink and white cotton candy clouds. Wrapped up in each other, their hearts in their throats, they feel the purest joy. It swells in their chest, threatening to burst open like a monsoon rain. The building above them grows smaller, and they leave one life behind, rising from the ashes to begin their lives together anew.
And if heaven exists, the sensation of John's fingertips on his skin is the closest to heaven Sherlock has ever been. He alternates between deep, skillful strokes and light, gentle ones, grazing over the tops of his shoulders, his chest, and his clavicles. Sherlock notices John's breaths growing heavy and irregular as he finally drifts up to the sides of his neck. Sherlock himself has, at some point, stopped attempting to hold back his long, guttural moans of appreciation, and he realises that his breaths have grown short and unsteady as well.
“Come over here,” John says, patting the spot on the bed next to him. “So I can kiss you.”
"Yes." John wraps his legs around Sherlock's waist to the best of his limited ability.
the most familiar option of all.
John nods. “That's good enough for now.”
The two women glance at one another, and they seem to have an entire conversation without using any words.
Are they all aware of how utterly cringeworthy this is? Yes. But do they all keep staring at the board in hopes that something happens? Also yes.
“What. Uber?"
“I can neither confirm nor deny your theory." Sherlock takes John's hand as if he knew John hoped he would; carefully, knowing it's still damaged.
It shuts Sherlock up completely (after he makes an embarrassing noise that he will never admit to making). He lies back and shuts his eyes, focusing on John, and only John, breathing and sighing and trying not to buck wildly; murmuring John’s name as he rakes his fingertips through his own hair.
Mrs. Hudson is having a Halloween party. And to make matters even more gruesome, Sherlock has unwittingly accepted her invitation.
With that, John and Sherlock dissolve into laughter first—and into kisses second.
John can feel it: he and Sherlock share the same urge to leave, but they also share the same—stronger—urge to linger.
"Me, too," William says, and kisses him back.
John clears his throat pointedly. "Why are you here, Lestrade?"
And he thinks, perhaps, that is exactly what he and Brook have become.
John has the best ideas.
“Ooooh,” Moriarty drops his jaw dramatically. “Dear lord, he speaks my language. But I suppose it’s not so rare that one would die for their lover. The question I have for you, though, is this: Would you do what I've done, Sherlock? Would kill for the man you love?”
"See?" John says. "A clear sequence of events."
must be the reason people get married for real.
As Sherlock watches him walk briskly ahead, he's overcome with sheer panic. What on earth is he running from?
"Really? That's absurd. And also, cheating."
John lays himself flat on his back, raising his hips to allow William to remove his trousers. William tosses them onto the floor, drapes John's legs over his shoulders, and immediately begins to to prepare him—spreading him open with his fingers and brushing against his prostate until he starts to beg. He unbuttons his own trousers, and they slide to the floor, but he's too caught up in the moment to kick them away. Just like that, over the bar, he buries himself into John with urgency. Just like that, trousers at his ankles, skin slapping against skin.
John knows that it’s silly to be a tiny bit saddened by Sarah’s happy ending with Gabriela, and he wants to kick his own arse. But now, he can’t stop thinking about what it had felt like to wake up in William’s arms.
“If you believe it’s important."
"Mmm. Yes." Sherlock rubs his hands together to create heat. "Could it possibly be due to the fact that it's cold and wet where I'm standing?"
John pauses, his mouth against Sherlock’s jaw. “I don’t have a gun with me, Sherlock.”
They go to leave, giving Mrs. Hudson a hug and thanking her for a genuinely fantastic evening. Sherlock nods in Anderson’s direction and reassures him that he still hates him.
short, pretty doctor soldier has done the same.”
He touched my head earlier. Well. It was petting, really. Like one would to a dog. -SH
John’s heart is in his stomach, but he feels a tick of relief. “Did you say Thursdays at 7:30? Can’t be her—she’s got an anatomy lecture at that time.”
Molly’s face lights up, her heart suddenly in her eyes. “Yeah, he’s pretty fucking amazing, isn’t he?”
Sure enough, like clockwork, their morning nurse wakes them up at five the next morning.
The corners of Sherlock’s heart-shaped lips tug upwards. There’s a subtle awe in his expression. It’s a look that John is fond of, but rarely sees—the one he gets when John does something that befuddles him beyond words. But it doesn’t last long; a serious expression quickly sweeps over his features.
John lifts his one good hand—very cautiously at first—and Sherlock's anticipation is so acute it nearly aches.
And one is from Sarah, his ex.
She chuckles softly, pulls away from him, and peers into his eyes, unblinking. “You’re very quick to speak for him, love. But I’ve known him far longer than you have.”
Still doing it.
Mary nods stiffly, pursing her lips. “Yes.” She offers no further explanation.
There is, indeed, a trunk full of bills hidden beneath the floor. However, it’s all Bolivian peso, a form of currency that’s been obsolete since 1986.
”Thank you, love,” she says. “You’re the best friend a girl could ever ask for.” She lets go of him, and he squeezes her shoulder.
“I promise I’ll be sharp as a tack once she arrives,” Gabriela says with a wink, taking a sip of her muddy-looking coffee. “Now let’s review the plan.”
He is dead, and you are the monster who killed him. And I have mourned him; as much as I have mourned my life and my family, I have mourned the loss of my friend, Richard Brook.”
The pleasure is unreal.
“Bed,” John says.
"Two weeks?" Lestrade asks incredulously.
All he knows is that the man he loves more than anything in the universe is in his lap, frotting against him, kissing him desperately as though he knows it will be the last time.
It’s been five minutes on the dot. John knocks tentatively at Sherlock's door.
It's Sherlock who finally gives it.
"Have sex with me."
The sun sets. The room grows dark, and the two of them make love. And the love they make is volcanic: an eruption hotter than magma, an insurgent blaze that could take down a village.
know.”
"Oh, god. You two are such idiots. It's a match made in heaven."
Thanks for your patience on this update. Life has been wonderfully crazy lately...I actually got married! Like, for reals married! My wife and I are in a haze of wedded bliss, so the emotional and angsty nature of this chapter made it challenging to write—but it’s finally here! I hope you find it worth the wait :)
“Home.” John feels a rush of bliss spread through his chest. “Our home, correct? In the year—“ he ventures a guess. “Eighteen hundred and—“
"Must I?"
His eyes fall closed, and he inhales. Exhales. Inhales. Exhales.
One week after he passes his comprehensive examinations, the fifth murder occurs. Her name is Maria Jose Kabara, and she is the county commissioner’s eldest daughter. A handwritten note, scrawled in bright red ink by someone who appears to be left-handed, is placed next to her corpse:
jealousy at this point seems inevitable. But why should it be? Whether or not William is into that—or her—who can blame him? She’s clearly a beautiful, very sexy woman who would know how to treat a man in the bedroom.
Sherlock peeks over his phone. John stands before him, holding an empty wine glass and a bottle of pauillac.
Again, he doesn’t push for the details.
As the morning passes, they drift in and out of sleep and kisses and heavy breaths, but they never emerge from their cocoon. Eventually, John’s empty stomach grumbles loudly enough to pull him from his slumber. William is napping beside him. John kisses the bridge of his nose, and he stirs; insisting he’s been awake the entire time due to John’s stomach "roaring like a crazed hyena."
“Thank you, Molly Hooper,” he says with sincere gratitude, pulling her up and kissing her on the cheek.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think she’s talking about you, Sherlock,” Molly acknowledges.
: Ridiculous question given the audience
has actually caused both of them to become even more aroused.
“And then, you’re going to have sex with me.”
John pauses. Frowns. Watches his expression closely. Frowns again. "...What?"
"Bees in the countryside," John muses. "That sounds wonderful." His head becomes filled with lovely images of the two of them growing old together in Sussex. Sprawled out over blankets in the green grass; having nighttime picnics while staring at the stars. Sherlock, head of thick white curls, talking about the seasonal behaviours of the honeybee.
“Bad idea.”
And William? William looks happy. Perhaps not for the same reasons, but he looks carefree. Content. Unbothered.
fill the air.
Gabriela begins using a low, breathy voice to share her fantasies with Irene, and John gives in and listens. He’s sort of got to, right?
"Hm." John playfully runs his tongue over his own bottom lip. “I’d like to try it in the cocktail before making a final decision."
It’s one in the morning, and the two of them have been laughing boisterously over Brook’s retelling of a case that involves a well-known political figure and a few embarrassing credit card purchases.
Overwhelmed by the urge to flee, John turns to exit the kitchen as swiftly as he can. "I'll be in the bedroom if you—right. Okay." Cowardly? Perhaps. But what
Molly reads. “She’s laughing at you.”
“There is no way you can be certain of that,” Sherlock says.
"Yes. The one with all of the costumes and fake weapons. Could be interesting."
The room grows warm; warmer than Sherlock can stand, and he finally pulls back from John to take a moment to breathe.
"Good." Sherlock smiles into his neck and works on unzipping John's trousers. Kisses John's neck, his Adam's apple, his jaw; digs his fingers into John's hipbones.
to avoid me."
The show must be ending, he thinks. He's got no idea what’s next, but he's not worried. He's safe in John's arms now, and he fears nothing.
, John slips past him just short of the entryway.
"No need." John brushes his fingertips over the cool skin of his neck. He moves a step closer to him still, and closer, as if gravity were somehow working to pull their bodies together.
"Hello, dears!" a familiar voice calls out to them.
No matter. Sherlock huffs. “I was talking to John. Obviously. Right, John?” He looks back down at John for confirmation. He’s peacefully dozing. Sherlock pokes at his sternum.
"Now," he says.
Instead, he watches John closely as he opens the cupboard door, his eyes roaming over his body. It suddenly occurs to him how oddly out of character John’s current attire is. Typically, he looks as though he’s raided his grandfather’s wardrobe—but not now. Right now, the jumper he wears is dark cashmere and quite form-fitting, as are his denim trousers. Hm, yes. Quite form-fitting indeed.
John’s got his own life now. He’s got a wife, and a home, and a baby on the way. He’s got his own Christmas this year.
"Not really the same," John explains. "Try being more specific, perhaps."
Sherlock doesn't drink wine often, but when he does, the world becomes warmer and fuzzier than the jumper John is wearing.
Sherlock considers his question for a moment. “I feel...like I want more.”
"My pleasure," Lestrade says, shaking it.
angry with yourself for missing that one."
Sherlock stands, holding his hand out to John. John takes it and pulls himself up—but the moment Sherlock touches him, he detects a sense of restless indignation.
John wants his heart to slow down—but he doesn’t know where this conversation is going, or if it will leave his heart intact or shatter it to pieces. So he simply listens, hoping William will quickly get to the point.
John squeezes his eyelids tightly and takes a deep breath. “Yes. I will.”
Showing how you feel is often easy. But the feelings don't gain life until you give them a name. And no matter how much you may regret what comes of that, there is no way of shoving those words back into your mouth.
"That I love you?”
“No.” John shifts his body closer to him, setting a hand on his hip. “It intrigues me, actually.”
”Anyhow,” Sherlock abruptly continues. “I suppose this is also a silly question, but—are you feeling alright?”
“You’ve only just figured it out, then?”
Sherlock looks down at their hands, and he’s grinning like a madman as well. Seeing this, John thinks, just for a moment—this is true happiness, isn’t it? Sherlock could never fake such a thing.
"Hush! It was only kissing!"
Before long, the hardness between their legs is throbbing with the need to be released. Sherlock, ever observant, reaches down and unfastens John’s trousers first, and then his own. Their naked cocks pour out, dark and thick.
"Well, yes. My idea was murder. After that, I'm spent."
It's John's turn to dissolve into laughter. "Calm down. I was just going to propose a toast."
you feel it. And I know that you want these things. With me.”
"John—“ he says softly.
Even Harry and Clara are there. Once John finally worked up the courage to tell Harry how terrible Christmas had always been without her, she told him that she felt exactly the same; so she and her wife immediately booked a Holiday visit. The two women sit at the bar opposite him, swept up in each other as if they’ve forgotten they aren’t the only ones in the room.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock,” he says, leaning steadily backwards to settle into his seat. “Perhaps I overstepped. I didn’t intend to make you uncomfortable.”
know."
The streets are covered in fog, and the sky is blanketed with clouds, and there isn't a celestial body in sight. Other than John's, obviously.
“Great,” she says. “I’m learning a lot. But it’s still fun to hear about other people’s love lives. Are you two officially together, then?”
“You’re ready," Brook says. "You’ve got no need to prove that to me. But what better way is there for you to prove it to yourself? Especially with a case like this.”
“Just another minute or so,” the driver says, adjusting the rearview mirror. “Are you ready?”
“I want you to handcuff me to the bed,” he hears Gabriela moan. “Blindfold me. Wrap your legs over my legs, and rub your clit against mine, over and over, until I’m just about to come. Then ride me with your wetness, sliding it over my naked body until it reaches my mouth.”
John feels as though every cell in his body is suddenly screaming.
John takes Sherlock's hand before letting his eyes fall closed. As he drifts off again, Sherlock squeezes his hand gently, because he wants to be sure John knows he's going to stay.
“Sorry, sorry,” he apologises as he stumbles through. “Didn’t mean to reveal your identity to...whom, exactly? Though to be fair, I’m certain every word I said got soaked up by that thick, shaggy carpet."
John has watched Sherlock stroll into his hospital room each day since the very first. Every day, he’s more beautiful than the last. Every day, John tells him; and every time, Sherlock's cheeks become a gorgeous shade of pink.
John watches her shift continuously in her seat, nervously wringing her hands. A former assassin, he thinks, though she's not being candid.
The Strand is closed to the public today, and they’ve got nowhere else to be but together.
Tearing his eyes away, he checks his phone for messages. Still nothing. He screams internally as he begins to type.
“Right.” He clears his throat. “So, Molly, are you a student here as well, or—?”
Sherlock peers over at him with curiosity as he loops his scarf around his neck. “What’s the matter?” he asks, taking a few steps towards him.
“But that’s where
“He’s pretty clever, isn’t he?” Gabriela grins and gives him a playful push on the shoulder. “I can see why you like him.”
It's a seed that became sowed in John's head long ago, perhaps that fateful evening one January, when they first stepped into the restaurant. And by the time he realised the seed had even been planted, it had already grown and sprouted several more seeds, which in turn became a labyrinth of lush green trees and weeds and twisty-turny vines.
"That feels amazing." He sighs happily, leaning into John's touch.
“Hey, all!” Lestrade nods a greeting. “Sorry I’m late. Just left work.” He is predictably not wearing a costume, because he’s predictably boring.
he’s saying.
Sherlock tiptoes to the bed, draws the blankets, and slips in next to John, quieter than a mouse. John doesn't stir. Sherlock sets his head back onto the pillow, closes his eyes, and settles into the comforting ritual of counting John's breaths.
Received ✓
"I thought she
John smiles politely at him. “Cheers. Thanks for doing this."
Sherlock shrugs. "I've spent hours holding your hands. I've memorised everything about them. I know everything there is to know about all of your fingers, too, like the fact that your left pinkie is slightly shorter than your right."
The woman in the flower shop nods at Sherlock. “Yes.”
And then it happens. John presses his lips to his, timid but purposeful.
John’s eyes fly open at the sudden absence of William’s warmth. He’s not entirely sure what’s just happened; all he knows is that he’s insanely aroused—and insanely confused. He frowns at William, who simply looks back at him expectantly.
He pushes forwards, digging his elbows into John’s chest, trying to wriggle his body past him. But he does. Not. Move.
"That we're in love," Sherlock continues, smiling softly. "That we're perfect together. However, we were—"
"It's alright if you don't want to hear about my past, John," he continues gingerly. "But there's one very important thing I must say to you: sexual activity is not always contingent upon sexual arousal. And it most definitely is not always contingent upon feelings, even for myself. I know that sexual attraction, for me, is somewhat of a question mark--I always have. And so I did what many others do: I endeavoured to find an answer. What I discovered was a lack of interest. But I am most definitely interested in sex with you--so I suppose in this manner, you've got every bit of me as well."
It doesn’t budge. He pulls again. Nothing. He pulls and pulls and rattles it, but it’s stuck.
got hurt?" John turns on his side towards him. Gazes at him for a moment. Swallows. "I could never forgive myself if something happened to you and I didn't at least try to protect you."
The past six weeks have been the best of his life, and Sherlock's the reason. Though things between them have always been good, for the most part—nothing can compare to what they have now. And John doesn't want to let go of the solving crimes and the Chinese food on Wednesdays in front of the television, but he also wants to kiss Sherlock every day. To hold his hand every day, tell him how gorgeous he is every day until he can no longer speak.
And he never could have predicted that anything could bring greater joy at a crime scene than solving the crime itself. But here he is—here John is—wonderful and funny and sensual and kind. John, who has helped him discover so many great joys he’s never even come close to knowing before.
Donovan laughs nervously, her body tense. “I wouldn’t say normal, exactly. Something similar happened a couple of times with my grandmother. I was too young to know if it was real, or if she was just making it up for fun. But I do remember always thinking she had some type of gift.”
And with all he has in him, he begins making love to Sherlock Holmes.
"You look very, very nice tonight," John hums. "Would you like for me to keep saying it?"
"Which would lead you to find the book..." Gabriela continues.
Sherlock continues to stroke his hair. Per usual, John is very pretty, and he smells very nice. Sherlock thinks he could do this for hours. Has he been doing this for hours? Maybe. It feels like it. Time is odd.
"Alright." Sherlock pulls the door closed behind him. Ever so stealthily, he presses down the lock.
The vulnerability of Sherlock's words—of this entire moment—sets John’s heart off dancing. He begins to realise the intimacy they’ve become encased in. Sherlock gazes at him expectantly as John holds his head in his hands, their faces inches apart.
Sherlock bursts into a state of wake, drenched in sweat and gasping for air. He digs his fingers into anything nearby that will root him in place: a disheveled pile of blankets on one side, and on the other side—John.
“Sure.” Sarah says. “We’re poly. You know, not monogamous."
The tone abruptly cuts him off. "
John tilts his head thoughtfully. "I could probably get into the bed myself if I needed to."
“Yes, it looks like it,” Sherlock acknowledges. However, he finds it much more delightful to watch John fixating on the developing scene before them, narrating every movement as his concern gradually approaches panic.
Sherlock sprawls out face-up on the floor. He doesn't know how long he's been there; the days spill into each other and the winter sun lasts only a few hours.
, just as large and menacing; and beneath that,
"What's your favourite gelato flavour?"
She makes a tiny gasping noise and begins patting down her pockets. “Oh, no! I don’t have any matches!” She turns to Lestrade. “Have you got any I could borrow?”
I didn’t ask what he meant. I already knew. An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth. A life for a life. I had all but taken his.
shut up. Because I would still like for you to say—“
“Forget it.” Sherlock drops his arms to his sides. “I’m going to make some tea.”
"I think we ought to talk about you saving my life."
John's fingertips make their way to the most sensitive place on Sherlock's head—the place where his hair meets his neck. He rubs slow circles with his thumb and forefinger there before gliding back over his scalp in a light scratching motion.
“This is someone who ran away, presumably to be safe,” Gabriela reminds him. “She could be fine with seeing you, but she could also refuse to accept the booking. Especially if she’s sworn to secrecy, or whatever.”
And suddenly, William’s body is crowded against his. He towers over him, peers down at him; his racing exhalations hot on John's neck.
John inhales Sherlock's scent; his shampoo smells like lavender and honey.
John’s skin tingles from head to toe. “Don’t stop.” He places both hands on the door in front of them, splaying his fingers over the cold, foggy glass. “Please. Don’t stop.”
It’s far from the first time he’s woken up rock-hard and drenched in sweat after dreaming of William—but it’s the first time since they ended things.
“Alright,” John says slowly. He expects his world to come crashing down. It doesn’t. “It’s just—the stars. They haven’t come out yet.”
“Shut up,” he replies aloud.
I waited for him to complete the verse, but when he didn’t, I finished for him. “I say unto you do not resist an evil man: if he strikes your right cheek, turn your head and offer him the left one.”
everyone to know. Everyone in the whole damn universe. I would scream it from the rooftops if I could."
Behind the counter appears to be a new barista: a tall, pale man with dark, curly hair. John nearly drops his books. His pulse beats faster and faster, and his mouth grows dry.
"Same place I nap most days. The sofa."
“Jesus. I’m sorry. I know,” Sherlock says weakly, the sharp sting of embarrassment immediately overtaking him. ”I-I don’t know why on Earth I did that. I simply wanted to thank you somehow, and—“
"Calm down. You didn't allow me to finish. The flat is on fire,
"Sherlock." John says his name steadily, because after Sherlock's explanation, it's become apparent that he might benefit from some empathy and patience. "It's fine."
"Perfect. So this time, do you want me to use my hands to—"
"No!" John chuckles. "I mean, yes. Yes, I want to do that. But you're wrong. I am so proud to be yours, and I love that everyone knows. I
love him.
As the thought enters his mind, Sherlock feels John reach the tipping point. The movements of his body accelerate until their rhythm is lost altogether; he chants Sherlock's name, pumping into their hands with reckless abandon. And as he reaches climax, he tells Sherlock that he loves him--and Sherlock knows he's got no reason to be afraid.
“Alright,” John says. “I’ll be right back with some water and acetaminophen. You’ll feel better in the morning.”
“Good point." John grins at him.
John is certain he’s real, this time. He’s hunched forwards in a chair with his head on the bed, his cheek flat against the mattress. He’s snoring. John thinks he might be drooling as well.
“It’s fine.” Sherlock smiles, and the errant curl falls over his forehead. It takes every ounce of self control John has to leave it there.
John dissolves into laughter; he never tires of how adorably clueless Sherlock often is with basic biology. "Don't think we'd see any geese, either." He glides his thumb over Sherlock's waistband. "But if we did, I'd definitely need to protect
William follows her, still saying nothing—which drives John mad—and continues on with whatever task he was doing previously.
The sound of the wooden spoon hitting the floor aligns perfectly with the magnificent sensation of their lips crashing together. In an instant, John’s hands are clasped to Sherlock’s waist, and he's spinning his body around, firmly pressing him into the kitchen table and kissing him like mad.
“Yeah. I get that,” John says. “MIT students are a pretty intellectual bunch.”
The all-too familiar feeling of tears stings John’s eyes. “Sherlock. My love." He attempts to steady his voice, but he’s barely able to hide the emotion in his words. “You are the loveliest thing I have ever laid eyes on. To behold you is to behold even more beauty than the moon, or any ocean, or any mountain on Earth."
“What
"Alright.”
“I don’t know. I see. Would you like to see as well?” He smiles at John, then—and with that smile, John suddenly feels no fear.
She lifts an eyebrow at him suggestively. “Heard you did, though. You know. With your
Baker Street is exactly the same as John remembers. Every wall, every step of the stairwell, every unique scent. Mrs. Hudson greets them at the entrance and gives John a long welcome hug, promising to bring him lunch later, once he’s rested up.
Sherlock raises his eyebrows. He drives his gaze into John as if he's attempting to drill a secret message into his brain.
Sherlock shrugs. "If that's what helps you ignore the truth of your mortality."
So the two men lie next to one another in bed, staring up at the ceiling. Predictably, they say nothing.
"I think you ought to demonstrate," John rumbles against his neck.
John reads the message five times. Surprisingly, he doesn’t feel annoyed or anxious or angry. Actually, he feels nothing.
"It's a thing. Google it."
John stops immediately. "I'm sorry," he says gently. "Too much?"
Quickly, he picks his phone back up and types his next message.
John smiles warmly. “Will do.”
The crowd’s murmuring grows louder and more excited.
Donovan takes a deep breath before returning her attention to the ouija board.
“So what?”
He glances over her shoulder at the other barmaid: a dark-haired woman who’s all curves and bright red lips. She wears a tight black leather corset and an even tighter black skirt, batting her eyelashes flirtatiously at her patrons as she makes their drinks.
married."
to remain close to him. But Mycroft is firm about us letting on what we know."
John nods stiffly. “I gathered. Goodbye.”
John’s eyes fly open. Light pours in. He groans and his head throbs. His fingers drift over the uncomfortably large bulge in his pants.
"No, it's not broken—the wheels are locked. You just need to flip the brake."
"Lestrade," John utters. "What the fuck?"
He has never kissed John like this; with the throbbing desperation of wanting to give him everything. Every part of him, every piece of the universe that the universe will allow. To hold him. To make love to him. To be his.
“I had this thought, or an occurrence, rather—“ Sherlock stammers. “That is to say, a thought that occurred to me…” he briefly pauses as if summoning coherent words. “And, well, I discussed it with Molly, and she thought it was a good thought, so I thought, perhaps—"
“Who cares about that?” Sherlock leaps up from the floor and makes his way to Mrs. Hudson’s fireplace. “Let’s see what’s beneath the floorboards!”
Towards the end of the second week— after constant prodding from John, and Molly, and Lestrade, and Mycroft, and Mrs. Hudson, and according to Mrs. Hudson, "God himself”— Sherlock finally agrees to take a case. It's on a Saturday evening just after dinner. He makes his way to Ealing to help Lestrade with a matter of missing persons. He solves the case in four minutes and locates the persons in another seven. It takes over an hour to get back home in traffic.
“John. Is that you? What on
She waves him off with a dismissive hand. “It was the life I chose to live, and if karma repays me, so be it.”
Mid-afternoon, they fill bowls with stale popcorn and settle in front of the television. William adamantly refuses to watch sports, but only half-heartedly refuses to watch
And if John’s hands are magic, his tongue is a fucking marvel. It swirls in and out and around Sherlock's mouth, sweeps over his lips as his fingers skim down his neck and over his bare shoulders.
Sherlock drums his fingers rhythmically against the arm of his chair. “No.”
”Ummmmmm...” John eyes the mugs, but doesn’t answer. Instead, he picks it up and takes a sip. Because after tonight, he really doesn’t know the answer to that question.
“Night, John,” she says, her eyelids heavy. “Love you.”
Sherlock's throat tightens and he lets out a rattling sigh. This is probably his new, even more favourite thing to do with John.
Especially when her loud, obnoxious text alert rings out from his pocket and fills the entire room, moaning even more loudly than
John actually knows nothing about William.
Three weeks, by his estimation. It's been three weeks since the blizzard; three weeks since he and John became stranded in this horrible cabin in the woods. Sherlock doesn't mind the isolation, of course—but he's on the verge of going mad.
“Good.” He lays his on John’s chest. “I hoped it was on purpose.”
Love. That powerful word enters Sherlock’s mind, and he comes so hard that his knees buckle. He falls forward over John, and John catches him, steadying him as he rides out four or five heavy tremors, and again, and again, until they collapse into the bed, crazed and exhausted and fully satiated.
John has very quickly moved from utter loneliness to having the best friends in the world.
"Hmph. Wrong,” Sherlock replies. Because he
"Oh!" John's eyes grow wide. "Oh.”
John dreams that he and Sherlock are children again. They’re in a vast meadow of lush emerald grass, and they're surrounded by brightly-coloured dandelions. Seated together, they lean against a gigantic oak tree, looking out into a cloudless cerulean sky that’s as large as the land.
He appears to be in a fancy hotel room. At a wedding, judging by the expensive suit, flowers, and half-empty bottles of champagne on the counter top. William stands behind him, looking over his shoulder. He’s dressed similarly, but his tuxedo is a lighter colour than John’s, and the collar of his dress shirt is slightly unbuttoned.
With these words, John's soul and heart and mind leave his body entirely.
Brook rolls his chair back, switching off the desk lamp. “The results may take several hours, Sherlock. Don’t you have an exam in the morning?”
“You saved me the pain of having to do it myself,” she finishes. “And you owed me absolutely nothing, but I can’t tell you how much of a relief it was.”
Sherlock stares blankly at his screen, waiting for a response that doesn’t come.
But his brain is screaming something altogether different.
“Yes,” Sherlock agrees.
“Oh, what a great joy.” Sherlock rolls his eyes.
John makes his way home from the MIT campus, his head spinning with all of the odd things to happen in the past twenty-four hours.
It’s a British news article:
John nods.
“God, god, god, John,” William chants over and over as he begins to erupt into his own hand. A pulsing wave seems to shoot through his entire body. It begins near the leaping pulse point at his neck, flows through his chest, his trembling abdomen, all the way down to his curled toes.
"Yeah." John squeezes him closely. "I really would."
"Mmhmm."
John ignores him and presses on. "When you and I looked at the flat together for the first time, Mrs. Hudson presumed we were together."
“John!”
John's kissing Sherlock because Sherlock asked him to, and he can't say no to the taste of his honey-sweet lips. John's kissing him as if he's waited to kiss him forever, and forever felt far more likely, but he's grateful that forever has turned into now.
“No.” Exasperated, John unwraps himself from Sherlock and stands, dusting off his jacket. His stature turns serious and soldier-like, sexy and protective and a tad angry—Sherlock loves it. "We did not."
Do you imagine Doctor Watson tops? He gives off some serious top energy, if you ask me.
Sarah pats her on the shoulder. “Sure! Next time you're in Vegas, go for it."
“From Leeds, actually, but I moved to London when I was ten.” She smiles again. “Are you a student here?”
Sherlock nods and returns to his Masaman curry.
"Nothing." John hands him the laptop. “Here you are, gorgeous,” he says with a wink.
William always keeps him guessing.
"No. You only told me you play the piano.”
“John."
During one of those days, John and Stamford are at the table in their apartment eating breakfast. John asks Stamford about his plans for New Years Eve, and Stamford grows visibly uncomfortable. Apparently, Elizabeth’s best friend is throwing a party at her house.
He thinks of Sherlock. If only makes things more awkward.
John’s shaft within his velvety, warm mouth, taking it in all at once; and John has to dig his fingers into his flesh to keep from rutting into his throat. But William urges him otherwise, guiding John by the hips deeper into his mouth.
William shuts the door behind himself quietly. “I’m not entirely sure yet.”
William realigns himself, guiding John’s thick, heavy cock into his body.
“If you'll excuse me for a moment,” Sherlock says, “I'm going find Angelo and thank him. I'll meet you outside, alright?"
“Say it, John.” He clings to John desperately, riding his thick cock as he arches into him.
"Absolutely," John says. "I hope I am, too."
“I’m kidding.” Gabriela winks.
"Nothing. I'm simply waiting for you to start a conversation."
Their names are Elena Sharpe and Christina Everson, and they fit every part of the killer's profile.
John throws his head back and laughs. "And there's Irene Adler, making an unexpected appearance, something she is uncannily good at."
“Irene,” Molly softly admonishes.
before.”
"So you claim every day," Sherlock states, but doesn't argue against it—his cheeks burning the bright pink shade John has come to adore.
"Yes," John agrees. "A bit higher up than the chair. Less lifting."
He guides Sherlock's body forwards until his opening brushes against the tip of his cock, and he arches his hips into him.
Sherlock cannot believe the audacity of this man and the tea-stained shirt he's wearing for the second night in a row.
"Alright, sweetheart," John says. "On the count of three."
memories exactly; they're more like a state of infinite awareness—of every life, every moment in time, every universe in which he and Sherlock have lived. And there are thousands and thousands and thousands. He sees Buckingham Palace, of course, and the pool, and John’s wedding, and the Victorian flat—but there are countless other memories as well. In some, John is a medic during a war in Afghanistan, or in Iraq, or in Vietnam, or in worlds he doesn’t even recognise. In some, he and Sherlock are parents. A baby girl—or sometimes, it’s a boy, or sometimes both. Sometimes, John and Sherlock even give birth themselves. In some memories, they simply have different occupations; surfers, tennis players, actors, park rangers, detectives. In others, they’re mythological creatures; vampires or mermaids or faeries. They're pirates. They're Greek gods. They're alpha and beta and omega. They're pansexual, homosexual, bisexual, cis, and trans. Like Sherlock said—everything imaginable.
"John," he says. “Now that you're awake, there's a matter I should probably fill you in on."
After a few more pointless minutes of browsing, John receives a text message from Sarah.
Yes. This is very good. Kissing is good. Talking is boring. Who needs talking, anyhow? Kissing is a far more enjoyable use of their oral cavities.
“William.” The word comes as a gust of air from John’s chest, rustling black curls as the man brushes his fingers to the nape of John’s neck.
“Not yet. You?”
John, who is touching him.
William sighs with a deep dejection, leaning forward again to bury his face into John’s abdomen. “Actually, I’m the one who should apologize."
“Oh!” She exclaims. “It’s only you two. With all the pounding into the walls, I thought someone was trying to get in!”
Immediately next to it, a painting done by his grandmother, which she signed and labeled simply:
John stares. Sherlock is somehow very charming when he pouts. The way his eyes become wide, his forehead crinkles, and his lips form into a perfect heart shape. It's rather nice.
"What's your favourite sandwich?" John asks Sherlock on Thursday. "Like, say you go to a sandwich shop. What do you order?"
She’s right. The highway cuts through some type of valley; their car is dwarfed by beautiful, bright red cliffs that rise high on both sides. Beyond that, they’re wrapped in an infinite blue blanket of snow-capped mountains.
And Sherlock is kissing John back as if he thought he might never kiss again; with a lingering deliberation that sends swarms of butterflies straight to John's stomach. With his long fingers tucked behind John's neck, he sips delicately at his lips, tongue flickering against them in intermittent waves.
They collapse onto the bed, their suits becoming a crumpled pile on the floor. They quietly and tenderly make love, skin against skin, their lips and fingers discovering every inch of one another.
John closes his eyes again. "Erm. Chocolate, I suppose."
It's not until John is carding his fingers through Sherlock's hair that he notices how small the space between them has become; and he doesn't notice how drunk they both are until he's letting him.
It was easy to let himself feel things and do things before John came home. When they were only pretend married. It was safe. And if it ended badly, he could simply blame the game. But real life is real. There's no end date, no quit button until the day you die. No rehearsals. Just a permanent record.
“How do you know all of this?”
"Yes, I imagine we might have.”
“That’s good, I suppose?”
invited for tea?
to die? And both of us unintentionally played into her death wish?" This sends Moriarty into a psychotic fit of laughter; a sound so sinister that John nearly plugs his ears. Thankfully, however, helicopters and sirens soon approach in the background, masking the sound.
"Alright, then,” John says. “I’m going to venture a guess.”
Sherlock flips himself onto his stomach and slides to John's side of the bed, stopping just before his mouth reaches John’s earlobe.
John slides his tongue over his bottom lip, battling the urge to tell the man off. What he can’t fight, however, is his own gaze as it wanders down William’s body, settling on the white, pristine dress shirt he wears. It’s so tight, it doesn’t fully button; perfectly form-fitting over the man’s lithe torso, hugging the curves of his chest and complementing the ivory skin of his neck. The bartender may be a dick, but John supposes it doesn’t matter as long as he can make drinks.
William pulls out his phone. “Your ride is here,” he confirms.
John releases his grip, but he can't look away. “Memories?”
But among the hundreds of titles, there is one book, pulled slightly out from the shelf, that draws his attention:
"Serious?"
“I don’t know, Sherlock." Brook takes a bite of his apple. “You know, with your studies coming to an end soon, perhaps it would be good experience for you to take this case on your own.”
John sighs with frustration—yes, definitely frustration. Why does he think William would want to get in touch with him, anyway? He didn’t seem to care for him much in the end.
John clenches his fist. “If he had tried anything, I would have beat his face in—”
Sherlock stops just short of where John stands, pinning him with his inquiring gaze. “Then why are you sad?”
“You won’t be able to help him.” Mary speaks as though she’s conveying the simplest, most basic truth. “When it’s my intention to kill, I never miss.”
"I will."
Gabriela sets her elbows onto the table, batting her eyelashes at him as she rests her head in her hands. “How will you reserve the booking?”
Sherlock's breath seems to stop as he hangs on to every word John's saying.
Hi! 😄
But he feels it: he’s not the same man he was yesterday. He’s not even the same man he was two hours ago, before being pressed against a wall and kissed by a tragically beautiful bartender in skin-tight jeans.
He stands at the far end of a mostly empty train car, hanging onto the railing with one unsteady hand. He sighs. If he could only speak to Molly, she could clear up so many things. But can she even be trusted? John knows she's lied to him at least once. What other things would she lie about, if given the chance?
John mouths silently.
John’s eyes go wide with shock, and Marci’s expression grows horrified. Scowling, she rises from the table. "John! Say something!”
“But this
Sherlock lifts an eyebrow at him. "Are you suggesting that we drink that?"
"Blah blah," Sherlock concludes.
“Good. Bye, John.”
Sarah smiles, handing him his socks and shoes. “We’ll talk in the car.”
John swallows thickly. "...What do you mean, everything?"
“Am I actually freaking out about a person in a costume?”
Gabriela passes it over, and he rereads it. "No. Not the woman.
With every passing minute, John’s heart beats faster.
"I notice it," Sherlock states. "I simply didn't care enough to pay attention. Not until it was you, anyway. I most definitely paid attention when it was you."
"Yeah, of course we noticed.” Lestrade takes a bite of his doughnut, nodding towards the adjoining room. "We saw you on the security camera."
And there it is again; that stupid beautiful smile.
Sherlock carefully sits—but he doesn't sit too close. He doesn't want to make John more miffed than he already is.
John huffs as he begins to understand what Mycroft is getting at. Of course. The “big brother” talk. Although his and Sherlock’s situation is abnormal, Mycroft is, in some ways, quite normal.
John's forehead crinkles into a frown. “Hey!” He gestures towards the computer laying in front of Sherlock. “Is that my laptop?”
John takes a seat on the bed next to her, nodding firmly. “Right. You stay here and wait for her to arrive. She’s scheduled for 9. Don’t forget to turn on your earpiece. I’ll be in the casino listening in.”
