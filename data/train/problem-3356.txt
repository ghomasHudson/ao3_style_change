Castiel feels some of his delicate self-restraint begin to slip. “So you two came here to tell me I’m the topic of office gossip? Excellent. If that’s all, I have work to do.”
Dean whimpers, his cock stirring, and Castiel grins wickedly—though Dean can no longer see him. “Next, is something you’re familiar with. A ball gag, which is another tool we use to grant you freedom as a submissive. You won’t be able to speak, and so, you have to focus on the sensations you’re feeling.”
. What if he hadn’t? What if his true mate had gone with Dick Roman after all, and been subjected to being sold like a human sex toy?
“I think you would too. I’ve known her for many years. She’s hard not to like,” Castiel agrees softly.
“My place. If that’s not too weird,” Dean says in a rush. “It’s just, if you come into the office, the receptionists will bill you, y’know?”
In fact, Castiel would never consider anything other than a white-collar contract—a business-only agreement. Men like Roman favored the other end of the spectrum, red-collar contracts with omegas that centered around sexual servitude.
“Okay, that—that sounds good.” She gives him a weak smile then and there’s the crashing sound of glass breaking as a foot comes through the front window. “Get upstairs and lock the door now!” Dean yells at them. Both of them hesitate like deer in headlight. “Now! Go!” he yells again and they both run up the stairs. He curses the old ass windows that he hasn’t replaced on the first floor as sketchy dude Tom tries to climb through over the broken glass.
He cleans paddocks as quickly as he can, catching glances at Castiel as he rides around the arena, making it look effortless. He misses a few tosses into the wheelbarrow, distracted by the way the pants cling to Castiel's ass as he trots away from him. Dean somehow manages to finish his task and makes it down to the arena in time to see Castiel riding Rowena’s horse, the large Fresian Oscar.
“See you soon.” Dean places one more kiss on the top of his head before he heads out to put his plans into action.
“Suck up,” Dean elbows his brother who huffs and scowls at him. Sam shoves back at Dean who jabs him in the side in retaliation and a scuffle nearly breaks out with Dean getting Sam in a headlock before Castiel lets out a loud whistle and fixes the Winchesters a look that makes both of them freeze.
“Uh, no, definitely don’t wanna find that sonuvabitch. Sam borrowed my pack, so all the straps are too long.” Dean shifts the pack till it's in the right spot on his back.
Kevin seems to let it go, shrugging and turning his attention back to his computer. Dean gently takes the text off the table and heads to put it back on the shelf. After two weeks, he thinks he’s reached the end of books on the subjects of mates that Castiel has—which is saying something. His fingers linger a little on the spines of the books, wishing they could tell him what Castiel is thinking.
“W-where’s Cas?” he manages to grit out. He’s more certain now that he really had heard Castiel before. He remembers how Pam said Cas might have been on his way to get him. Part of him thinks it’s too much to hope that after Dean has been ghosting him for weeks, that Cas would still come for him. He
Castiel shakes his head resolutely, bringing his hand to Dean’s chin and making their eyes meet. “I don’t believe you.”
“This is your suite while you will be staying here. If there is something you need or that can make you more comfortable, just make a list on this note pad.”
Dean snorts. “You remember the day we met? When my dad and Dick Roman were deciding my fate like I was a piece of cattle?”
“I’m okay, Dean. I handled myself just like you taught me. I’m okay…see?” Sam holds out his arms, wide and spinning in a circle. “No harm, no foul.”
“The most annoying, insufferable, pushy, rude, and yet loving person on the planet. My brother, Gabriel. He sent me an email that he booked a flight for tomorrow morning. I hope that's okay?” Castiel sounds a bit concerned.
Sam chuckles as Charlie rolls her eyes, and Castiel looks between them in confusion. “Apologies, I’ve never played this game before.”
“Thought so,” he says shortly, standing up abruptly and walking toward the exit. “Probably for the best. I’m an omega, and you wouldn’t wanna date outside your, uh, social class anyways.”
“Hush, now. You’ve been a very bad sub and you are going to take what I give you,” Cain tells him, and the tears come harder as he slips a ball gag into Dean’s mouth and fastens it behind his head. “This may be hard to believe, in light of what I'm about to do to you, but I care about you, Dean. I truly do. Please know that I'm doing you a favor. I'm saving you.”
, as you so gracefully put it.” Castiel moves to set a drawers and comes back with a set of scissors.
“The boy’s upstairs asleep. It’s me, you idjit,” Bobby whispers impatiently. “Now, wake up. There’s a problem with Dean.”
Cas lets out a long sigh before responding. “No, Dean. I had no idea. And what’s more, I believe you. I know you didn’t find out until you say you did.”
“Jerk,” he mutters but he can’t keep the smile off his face. He leaves to go catch Decaf who is up grazing in the lower field. He’s truly a gentle horse, if not a little lazy. When he gets to the barn to tack up, it's empty, Cash and his owners are already out at the arena. He hurries a bit to brush Decaf off and get him tacked up before going out there.
“I’d like to take you on a tour to get a sense of your likes and dislikes. If things go according to plan, we’ll have a longer and more thorough discussion about your kinks at a later date. But for now…” He pulls back, sliding a hand possessively on the small of Dean’s back. “I’d love to see how you react to a live show, sweet boy.”
Seeing his eldest brother is never a pleasant experience, and watching Dean undergo such vile objectification from the other alphas had made his stomach turn. Not to mention, all the teasing comments they had made about him and Dean wanting each other—though incredibly rude and inappropriate, might not be entirely incorrect. Castiel wants Dean very much, every minute of the day lately, and there are moments when Dean’s eyes linger on him too long, or the soft timbre of his voice makes Castiel think, maybe…just maybe…
“I never planned to mate. Not after…” Castiel knows his voice sounds desperate, but he has to convince Dean—has to make him understand. “It has nothing to do with you, Dean, believe me. That’s a decision I made over a decade ago, and never doubted it—not until I met you.”
“Messy is fun,” Dean says, promptly plopping the last piece of chicken into the heavy skillet, the oil popping. Castiel grumbles indistinctly, looking down at his soiled button-up and the flour on his trousers. He goes to the sink and washes his hands thoroughly, at least three times, before patting them dry and returning to the stove. Dean shuffles the skillet around on the burner, and when he turns his head, a laugh gets caught in Castiel’s throat.
“You started it,” Castiel points out innocently, grinning widely. “I’m simply trying to confirm the logistics of your daydream.”
“We’re okay now, my omega,” Castiel soothes, and Dean lets his head tip till it rests on his shoulder, his hair tickling the alpha’s stubble. “I don’t want us to dwell on the past. I want us to build a future.”
“Let me go, you sonovabitch!” he snarls, but his head is a bit dizzy from exhaustion and lack of sleep and he can’t fight the drag forward.
“I thought the same when you took my pulse,” Dean breathes, seeming awed. He chuckles, shaking his head. “I was the fuck buddy you were seeing, right? You don’t have a third guy on the side?”
“I know,” Castiel sighs. “If I ever walked in on another Dom fucking you, without my knowledge, I would…” He feels a flash of rage course through him at the thought. “Let’s just say, you’re handling this well, by comparison.”
Castiel nods, forcing all his fanciful thoughts of Dean out of his head momentarily. He needs to stay clear-headed around Luc and his associates—in the time he’s known them, they’ve never
the news anchor says plainly, as footage appears of Alastair being handcuffed and pushed into a police cruiser, “
Dean hesitates a second, leaning against the truck and staring up at the hospital. He’s not sure he’s ready to actually meet FlyBoy yet—and all that might come with that—but he still wants to spend time with him.
Castiel gives him a small, strained smile, touching his hands and gripping them tightly. “I apologize, Dean, I know this isn’t about me. I’m just so sorry for all the things that happened to you, and all the things that
He tries to sit still, but he feels a bit like a caged tiger, and the urge to do something gets the best of him. He goes and grabs the pile of bedding in the hall and carries it down toward the laundry shoot Jo showed him once. He hears the sound of the front door open, and sighs in relief that someone is finally home.
By the time his good boy is conscious again, he’s lying horizontal in a hospital bed. He’s hooked up to a heart monitor—a precaution the doctor recommended due to the stress his heart suffered from the E-collar—and Castiel is checking over his vitals like a hawk. Sam and John are sitting in the only two available chairs, and everyone else is standing: Ellen and Jo, Bobby, Castiel, and even Rowena. They’re not supposed to have this many visitors huddled together in a temporary ER room, but that’s one perk to having a charming lawyer in tow. Things seem to move more quickly after anyone spends a few minutes speaking with Rowena.
He jumps a little when he feels a hand on his thigh, and he glances over to see Cas watching him intently.
“Was nothing, just talked to this guy a little, that's all. He caught me sneaking the crab cakes.” Sam keeps eating his waffle, avoiding looking at Dean.
Dean drags in a deep breath and moves slowly to the desk where Billie is working tonight. “Room seven when the light is on,” she replies smoothly and gives him a wink. It calms him down just a little and he takes a seat with his eyes glued on the signal light. Five long ass minutes tick by before finally the light turns green, and he slowly makes his way over. Hand stilled on the door knob, he steadies himself before going in to face his dom. He hopes he hasn’t ruined a chance at the scene he really needs.
Hey hey to our favorite readers of all time. Apologies for the slight delay—it's a crazy time for us personally, and we wanted to get this chapter just right—but we really appreciate y'all's support.
“Yes, Cas, please don’t stop.” Dean throws his head back slightly, narrowing missing the headboard, and Castiel puts a hand on the back of his head protectively, just in case. “Cas, Cas, Cas, Cas…” Dean chants his name a handful more times before he comes untouched with the most sinful, enticing cry that Castiel has ever heard. Between that and his tight hole seizing up around Castiel’s dick, it only takes a few more pushes before he’s pumping Dean full of come, holding him tightly as they fall to the side in a heap of sweaty limbs.
“That’s extraordinary,” he says breathlessly, while Dean just stands there, looking pleased with himself.
Castiel reaches behind him and pulls out a box. Digging inside, he pulls out two padded leather cuffs, black with a green stripe through the middle and silver D rings on them. He shows them to Dean. “Are these acceptable?” When Dean nods quickly, he adds, “Words, Dean.”
"Well, now you can tell both of us. Alright, get over here and have a seat." Charlie got up and Castiel sat in front of the computer, just as a face came on the screen.
Castiel pins Dean with an intense look. “Because from the second I saw you I wanted you, I wanted to protect you, to take care of you. It’s been like an itch under my skin ever since that first night. I worry about you going to the wrong Dom and ending up getting hurt. I cannot offer you something long term, but I would like to show you what I know, and help you discover your kinks in a safe and healthy way.”
“You’re letting go too early,” Dean notes, giving him a few pointers and helping him try again. Castiel reels back, tries with a bit more focus this time, but still doesn’t meet his target.
“Fuck you, I’m running on like four hours sleep,” Dean grumbles. “Castiel and my…uh, friends with benefits. I found out last night that they’re the same person. Castiel is the guy I’ve been fucking around with, but we never used names so I didn’t know. But I saw him on a call last night and it’s…him. He’s both guys.” Dean can almost feel a small weight lifting as the words leave him.
“Boss…?” Jo begins, standing outside of the car in a sort of daze. Alfie is sitting behind the steering wheel, window rolled down. “Did—did Dean just get
“Told you just a walk…not gonna run you into the ground yet, promise.” Dean smiles at him and leans on the side of the treadmill, standing closer than is probably professional.
Frowning at it, he concludes that the decision can’t be made without coffee. He brews a pot and stands in the kitchen, clutching his mug and staring at the object in question—sitting innocently on the coffee table now.
“When do I get my damn phone call?” he snaps, as Gordon comes around—gripping his bicep in a punishingly tight hold.
“You don’t need to worry about why, Dean. I am worrying about the why, and I am doing what is best for you now. Lift your chin… There's a good boy.” Castiel moves toward him with a white leather collar, and his eyes go wide. He flails backward, the chain catching on his cuffs. He loses balance, and would’ve hit the floor if Castiel didn’t catch him. “Easy sub. You’re alright, just take a deep breath.”
Rufus clears his throat, looking at the two of them. “More fruit?” he says, gesturing at the bowl, and they both shake their heads. Something fishy is going on but Dean can’t quite put his finger on it.
“We’re going to do something a little different today. Something my little whore has been fantasizing about.” Castiel pauses considerably before pulling up a chair into the center of the room, the sound of the scrapping metal vibrating in the air. He takes a seat slowly, eyes still trained on his sub while the man in question still stares respectfully at the floor. “Go to the back table. You’ll find a stereo and a collection of CDs. I’d like you to choose something, anything you’d like, then come to me.”
“That would be me.” Cain smiles and Dean snarls up at him. He doesn’t think he looks intimidating with drool dripping off his chin.
Either way, the meal had ended with Gabriel declaring that their father was “a controlling asshole” and “a big bag of dicks.” No one had ever disrespected Chuck like that, not even Gabriel, and the wrath their father unleashed had been catastrophic. Gabriel had packed up his belongings that very day and left.
“So, Dean. You seem to be doing much better, from what I hear?” Chuck asks, sitting in a leather arm chair, Becky practically vibrating next to him.
Castiel wakes the next morning feeling tired, having stayed up late to finish the paperwork he’d been too preoccupied to finish all week. He sighs when his alarm goes off, tempted to sleep in—but when he checks his phone, there’s a reminder that he has breakfast plans with his father this morning. Groaning with exhaustion and thinking pitifully that Saturdays are meant to be more relaxing than this, he rolls over and out of bed, heading to the shower.
“I can figure it out,” he mutters, finally jerking his hand free and banging it against the door jam. He makes an undignified yipe and shakes his hand, rubbing at the stinging knuckles.
Dean has no idea if Castiel gets what he was trying to say. He tries not to think of that punk exchange student Balthazar hanging all over Cas. If Dean
“I need to get out of this room.” He swallows tightly, trying not to think of Dean being practically naked in his sweet-smelling bed.
Soooo full disclosure that neither of us are beekeepers, and though we research heavily, we aren't experts. Sometimes you have to suspend your disbelief in the name of sexual tension, aka Cas hand-feeding Dean honey right off the comb. Agreed? Agreed.
He opens his mouth to say something when Cas pushes back from his chair, grabbing their empty plates. “You should get some rest, Dean. We have that early call with London in the morning.”
“Really! That would be awesome.” Sam smiles big and bright and Dean can’t help but smile a little, too. Sam’s one of the toughest people Dean knows, but he can see the relief in his brother’s eyes at being there. Dean wonders just how bad it’s been at home since he left.
Castiel searches around in the pocket of his wet and wrinkled dress pants, before finally locating his cell phone. “She hasn’t practiced in a few years,” he admits, “but if anyone could be persuasive enough to get Dean released, it would be her.”
Cas ran into his bedroom and threw on a clean button up and changed out his sweats into a clean pair of khakis. He went back out to find Charlie grinning like a Cheshire cat.
decide what is best for you and where you should go.” Cain looks Dean up and down slowly. “I already spoke with the local public training center, and they will be happy to take in a distressed sub if you can’t appreciate how well I’m taking care of you.”
Castiel bends over low, his lips lightly brushing the other man’s ear as he whispers, “You know what I think, slut? I think—” He gives a considerable pause, letting the tension between them build. “I’ve missed you too.”
Dean feels the eyes on him, but just can’t look up to meet them. “Hello Dean,” the voice is quiet, soft, concerned?
“Fair enough.” Castiel chuckles and makes Dean smile, ʼcause how can you not when someone that beautiful is laughing?
“What are you thinking about?” Castiel says quietly, their gaze deep and meaningful in a way he can’t quite pinpoint. Dean is quiet for a long moment, and doesn’t answer right away—moving his hips so he can rest his head on Cas’ chest. He hisses at the knot brushing his sensitive rim, but they find a comfortable position eventually, and settle in for the wait. Castiel strokes Dean’s hair, feeling messy and sweaty and absolutely incredible. As soon as his knot goes down, he’ll clean them both up and pull his boyfriend close again, breathing in his gorgeous scent and letting it soothe him to sleep. And perhaps he’ll clean up his bedroom, which looks more or less like a tornado has hit. Then again, he reasons, maybe that can wait until the morning. Having Dean in his arms tonight is more important.
“Red to stop, yellow to slow down, and green means you are good to go. I prefer that system as well. I need you to understand Dean, that it is perfectly alright to use your safe-words at anytime you feel uncomfortable. I will never be upset with you for using them.”
Cas hired Gadreel at the start of the summer, after their discussion about Lucifer. He seemed like a good guy, a solid beta, though he may be the most boring man in existence. He did take his job very seriously, maybe too seriously since he always seemed to show up wherever Sam and Dean went. Cas had said he hired him for general security around the property, but he felt more like a personal bodyguard sometimes.
He waits another ten minutes before the light above door seven turns green, making his heart thump in his chest. He moves toward the room, getting a little thumbs up from Lisa—a fellow sub he’s come to know the past few months. Fuck, he should not be this nervous…he doesn’t want to make a bad impression on this new dom. He takes a few deep, slow breaths before opening the door.
“Really.” He gives Dean a small, encouraging smile. “When’s the last time you felt like a Dom truly cared about your wellbeing?”
“Even if I decided to be with an omega, I would never be with someone like him. His father sold him to settle a debt, regarding him as nothing more than cattle. If his own family doesn’t respect him, why should I? Some omegas are too below us to even bother.” He cuts his eyes at Alastair, heart pounding in his chest. “Wouldn’t you agree?”
Castiel’s mouth goes dry, and he feels a sudden rush of shame coursing through him. Though April is paid to assist him during these periods of his alphahood, and has done so for the last three ruts, now that he’s regained some of his facilities, he’s panicking—imagining all the wild, animalistic things he surely must’ve done to her.
The matching program is a whole other mess of uncertainty, too. What if they aren’t compatible? What if they do work, but someone else matches with Castiel even closer than Dean does? Maybe Castiel is ready for a relationship…but with him? He makes just enough money to get by, but he isn’t cultured or educated like Castiel is. He isn’t even a good submissive by anyone's standards.
More than once he considered moving east to a more progressive school, but then he reminded himself that that school didn't need him but the students here did. Someone had to be the voice of reason.
“Do you?” Castiel countered and Dean just gaped at him a moment, unable to come up with a witty reply. “Have a good night, Dean,” Castiel smirked, shaking the snow off his hair and heading into his house, closing the door on a very speechless Dean.
Castiel licks and sucks on Dean’s gorgeous pucker, occasional inserting a finger or two and hitting his prostate. When he spears the tip of his tongue inside, probing and searching the walls of Dean’s hole, he knows Dean is on the precipice of coming. When he pulls his mouth away, Dean lets a sob out, trying his best to arch his back and offer his ass up again.
He also couldn’t seem to stop thinking about FlyBoy. He had a date tonight as well and he kept imagining what they might be doing. He had told Dean he was planning something for them and was excited about it. Of course FlyBoy was planning something, though—he’s a really thoughtful guy. Dean wonders what it might be and hopes the guy, whoever he is, appreciates it. He really needs to stop thinking about it though, ‘cause it’s souring his mood.
"Uh, hey Cas, you got a second?" Dean stuffed his hands in his pockets and hunched his shoulders to the wind, which was picking up. Castiel turned and smiled at him, walking down the steps and standing at Dean's level, which he had to admit made him relax a bit.
He nods vigorously as Castiel’s simultaneously pulls at his nipple and cock in tandem. All it takes is one quick pinch and twist of his wrist and Dean is coming hard, shooting out in front of them, come dripping onto Castiel’s hand. He milks Dean through his orgasm as Dean flops back against him, utterly boneless and spent. He closes his eyes and allows himself to go limp in Castiel’s arms.
summon me here, Your Honor,” Castiel replies cheekily, if a bit unhelpfully, and he sighs when she gives him a flat look. “I’m sorry, Billie. I find myself…” He brings a hand up, grasping in the air.
Eventually they return to Bobby and Sam, and the four of them fish, mostly in silence. About an hour in, Dean encourages Castiel to eat one of the sandwiches Bobby packed in the cooler. Castiel agrees to lunch only if Dean partakes as well, and they look at each other, a heaviness between them as they both acknowledge the state they’re in. It’s clear that neither of them have been able to sleep, to eat. Dean looks frail, and Castiel is more slender than ever. But that afternoon they sit shoulder-to-shoulder and have lunch, and for the first time in a while, a bit of nourishment doesn’t make Castiel’s stomach twist.
Dean hurries to comply, sliding his knees into place, and it feels different with his bare skin now, it feels better. He wiggles a little till he is right where he needs to be before lowering himself across it and placing his hands on the rests below. He arches his back and presents his ass, feeling the satin pull against his cheeks.
. He doesn’t have time to stew in regret, guilt, and shame. All he can do right now is help Sam, then deal with the alphas in the basement—by any means necessary.
“I really don’t need this thing, I can walk,” he grumbles, shifting in his seat and trying to hide his half chub. Just being near Cas again has his body responding in really embarrassing ways. He hasn’t actually come since he was with Cas, and his damn dick is finding that
Castiel shrugs. “It wasn’t ideal, but I had to pick a car to drive back, and yours was the obvious choice.”
Dean opens the pizza box to see a well-done sausage and pepperoni. The second is a Hawaiian. He looks up at Cas, who is seriously blushing at this point. “You remembered my favorite pizza?”
He makes quick work of setting up grain and locking down the grain room, double locks just to be safe, and runs his night check on each stall before heading up to the house. The sky is still fairly light with the long summer days, as he looks over to Ellie's place. His brother's car is there, and lights on inside.
“Oh, of course,” Castiel says, feeling foolish that he’s denied Dean a taste. He picks the comb up with his fingers, sticky and dripping honey into his palm. “It’s quite messy, though. Perhaps I should…”
He fidgets and shifts in his seat on the short drive to the club. He parks, and is actually early, figuring he probably broke several driving laws getting over here so quickly. He shakes his head, slapping himself in the face to get his damn head on straight, when he hears a tap on his car window and jumps at the blue eyes staring down at him.
“Well, Kevin called me. He’s home with a cold today—probably caught it from Charlie who is still on the mend—and I have a meeting all day in the city, so you’re a free man today.” Castiel moves around him to grab some bacon and eggs for himself.
to his chest, and he’s wearing a tight-fitting t-shirt and a pair of loose sweatpants. The yellow light makes his face look angelic—smooth skin, vivid green eyes, eyelashes long and black. He’s beautiful, warm and rumpled from sleep, and Castiel feels a pang in his chest at the sight. He’ll never get to roll over in bed and see Dean like this, never be able to share in such an intimate moment with him, and the longing ripples through him in desperate waves.
“Oh, I’m just getting started,” Castiel growls, clutching Roman by his collared shirt and slinging him against his own desk. He goes stomach-first, the wind clearly knocked out of him. Castiel spins him around, pinning him to the desk as one hand wraps around his throat.
Castiel feels his heart begin to race. He remembers with sudden, vivid clarity, the way Luc had looked at Sam that day at the pool party. It’s one of the reasons he had recommended Sam stay in his suite during the party, but when he found the youngest Winchester out on the patio and had the opportunity to introduce him to Jody Mills, it seemed worth the risk. Now he’s angry with himself—did his own recklessness lead to Sam getting hurt?
“Last question. You’ve been a very good boy.” Castiel’s praise feels sorta amazing, like it tingles through his whole body. “Can you tell me any kinks or activities you have enjoyed in the past, and ones you did not?”
When the call ends a moment later, he leans against his seat, breathing deeply, eager to finally be reunited with his true mate, his soul mate, his best friend. Castiel feels himself grow hard just at the thought of being with Dean, especially during his heat… He wants to be buried inside his omega, wants to cover every inch of his skin in his true alpha’s scent. He wants to bite him, to override the hideous souvenir from Roman’s attack. He wants to mate him, fully and completely, if his omega will allow him to.
“When I presented as omega,” Dean says in an uneven voice, “well, let’s just say my dad wasn’t thrilled. Nothing prepares you for dealing with dickhead alphas as well as John Winchester’s right hook.”
That request is how Castiel ends up with fingertips drenched in egg wash, a layer of flour sticking to his hands.
“How do you know that?” Cas grips the gift bag tighter. “Did you meet him during the course? Or maybe you met my friend, Hannah? I imagine the class is fairly small.”
Castiel feels it then—the glass slipping from his hand, colliding with the hardwood, expensive liquor pooling at his feet. He asked Dean this once, just weeks ago, after their first kiss. But he’s never meant it more than he does now, a question thundering in his head.
Dean eventually grabs his towel and heads back into the house to change for work. He dons his grey slacks and light blue button-up that make him think of his alpha’s eyes. Man, is he one lovesick idiot or what? He hesitates before deciding to ditch his blockers. It’s not like they have any outsiders coming in today.
“Okay, I’ll bring it to work in the morning, uh thanks.” The weird thing is, it feels really good to wear his coat, still having the sweet spicy smell of Castiel’s cologne to it. It feels safe.
He returned with two room keys. “Okay, I got one with two double beds for me and Sammy, and another they had another open at the far end with a single queen sized for Cas.”
“Thank you,” he says tightly, breathing heavily, feeling sick to his stomach. “Have a good rest of your day.” He grabs his bags and exits before she has a chance to extend their afternoon further, running up the stairs and into the safety of his apartment. He dumps all the bags and leans against the kitchen counter, his mind racing. What is his sub doing right now? Who is he with? Does he just consider Castiel his kinky, twice monthly fuck? A blip on his radar, and meanwhile, he’s quickly becoming the person Castiel looks forward to seeing the most?
“Told you he was the loveliest bitch you ever saw, with the neediest holes.” His master preens, walking to stand in front of him without blocking the man’s view. “Show Knight here how good you suck for me.” Two fingers press against Dean’s bottom lip and he quickly opens his mouth, taking both fingers in all the way down and as far as he can, sealing his lips and sucking. He teases his tongue along pads of his dom’s fingers and moans softly at the feel of them.
“Missouri, do you know when Ellen is planning to have dinner ready?” Castiel asks, moving behind his desk and clicking closed a few items on his desktop.
“Dean.” The voice is cold and sharp that greets him, and his eyes shoot up to see Castiel standing in the middle of the room, looking disappointed. Well, good…maybe the sooner he realizes Dean is a lost cause the sooner he can get out of here.
He spins the phone as the instructor moves on to talk about statistics, and he struggles to focus. He has to get through the course, then he can figure out what to do about him and Cas. It terrifies him—the thought of talking to Cas, the thought him not wanting Dean and how much that makes him want to throw up. Cas means everything to Dean, and fuck if he knows what to do about that.
“Always sexy to me, my omega,” Castiel replies smoothly, leaning down to plant a soft, intimate kiss just behind his ear…making him shudder.
Castiel nods, though he’d momentarily forgotten all about the training during his freaking out. Hannah’s right, he shouldn’t be distracting Dean with drunken messages at midnight, not when he has such a big day ahead of him.
The sun is bright and shining outside, which seems out of place considering the circumstances. Sam is waiting impatiently by the Impala—everyone had agreed that the teenager didn’t need to see whatever was happening behind those closed doors—but when he sees Dean passed out in Castiel’s arms, Sam’s face pales.
“Some of it. Like pet play—is that like I’m your dog or something?” He isn’t so sure if he’s into that.
Dean peers around the room…it’s like a small apartment. A couch with a TV and bookshelves across from a small kitchenette. He can see three doors along the back, and he peers in to see two bedrooms each furnished with a queen bed and small bathroom in between. It’s honestly almost more space than he has at his own house. “Two bedrooms?”
“So, why are you leaving those nice digs you had? Thought you said that alpha was treating you real well. Do I need to come down and lay a whoop ass on him?”
“Yes, sir.” Dean lets out a small sigh. It does make him feel better to know he has an out. He has no intentions of using it, but just knowing it’s there settles something in him.
“I’m going to take a silicon cock ring and slide it onto your eager cock, because good boys only come when their dom tells them to.”
. Without them to help us sort through everything from plot holes, to grammar, to tagging, and especially the ever important debates around smut logistics, this story wouldn't be nearly as strong. We are endlessly grateful to have had their help and support. They are the two best friends we could have. ❤️
Dean feels the blunt pressure of a cock pushing at his hole. The tiny voice in the back of his head telling him that this is wrong, that only Castiel gets to be inside him, has almost disappeared. Cain fucks him slow, hands gripping his bruised hips as he rides Dean. Moans of pleasure reach him, and he feels whenever Cain nails his prostate, but his own cock hangs limp and uninterested. But that's okay, he thinks, this isn’t about him. This about his Dom and making his Dom happy.
“Yeah, I thought the new big cinema in Marlboro would have put them out of business. I’m glad they’re still here though.” Castiel thought about the night he and Dean saw an
Castiel paces around the empty school yard. All morning long, he had fretted over everything—his hair, his clothes, even his teeth. He hasn’t primped and preened like this in years, not since he’s been on a proper date, and his heart swells at the thought of asking Dean out today, looking into his eyes and asking him to grab coffee after boot camp—
“Please, just check on him,” Castiel begs, and the officer relents, promising to do so. He finally closes his eyes again and gets another half-hour of restless sleep.
“Don’t do this,” Dean snarls, struggling as Cain grabs a ball gag and crawls back over him. Cain has to pinch his nose to get his mouth open, but he manages to gag Dean all the same.
Dean swallows hard and tries to calm his racing heart. He knows what comes next here—his worst freaking nightmare since the day he presented with the wrong goddamn gender. “Your father tells me you have yet to sign a contract with an alpha? Fairly uncommon for a young, healthy omega like yourself. Now you’re of age, so your father cannot sign a contract for you…so this needs to be just between us.”
“Oh yeah, uh, here, all clear.” He does a little salute, pulling the paper from his pocket. He is glad he got them back so fast, having done the tests on Monday.
“There’s nothing you can do—the damage is done, you greedy, stupid idiot. As of tomorrow, you are no longer my employee. But for tonight, if you don’t want me to sue you within an inch of your pitiful little life for endangering my family, you’ll do everything I say…no questions asked.”
“Beauty is wasted on the young,” the woman sighs. They sign her in and say their goodbyes, heading back to the truck. Jo is unusually quiet and Dean can tell she’s thinking about something.
The omega pinches the bridge of his nose, exhaling a nervous huff before his eyes search again for Castiel. “Okay. Okay, I guess I’ll do it.”
“You're all strapped down,” Castiel tells him, and he blinks his eyes open and tries to ignore the heat he feels rising in his cheeks.
He turns to look at Cas then, meeting his glowing blue eyes. “Can you please just wait by the door, Cas? I got this, I promise.” The alpha eyes him warily. He knows better than to ask Cas to wait in the car—chances of that being slim—but he needs to get some distance here so it doesn’t turn into an all out brawl. Begrudgingly the alpha nods, moving toward the back door with arms crossed—glaring at Dean's father.
Dean can’t hold in the whimper as his body begins to fall victim to his heat. He rolls in the sheets imagining the feel of his alpha holding him, rutting into him and soothing that bone deep ache. His mind becomes a constant mantra of the one person he wants the most.
Castiel barks a harsh laugh. “This house belongs to your son, or didn’t you read that part of the contract? When the debt is paid, this house and your business all go to Dean. So you remember that when you speak to your son, before you dare touch him or threaten him again. You only have a roof over your head because he wants you to, and frankly, I wouldn’t blame him one bit if he wanted to leave you out in the cold.”
He stares his father down then, letting him know that Dean means every single word. John doesn’t say a word, but Dean doesn’t expect him to. He leans down, feeling his head spin a bit as he grabs the bag he dropped. “Let him go Cas,” he says, pulling the bag onto his shoulder, “we’re leaving.”
“I missed you,” Castiel whispered against Dean’s ear. Dean kissed his cheek and turned off the water.
Dean’s rumbling chuckle reverberates in his ear, his lips sucking a spot behind Castiel’s ear that will surely bruise tomorrow. He pulls back finally, his pupils dilated with lust, and leaves a trail of kisses from Castiel’s collarbones to his hips. He removes the last corner of robe concealing Castiel’s groin, and then the alpha is on display for him.
His dom reaches behind his chair then, plops something onto his lap. He sees a flash of leather and looks up at the flogger and small white towel on his lap. The smack that burns across his face takes him totally off guard and knocking him to the side. He catches himself on his hands and rights his position quickly, feeling the sting on his cheek. “Eyes down. I don’t want to see them above my boots, understand?”
“Castiel Novak.” They shake hands tightly, John squeezing a tad too hard, like any insecure Dom might do. Castiel lets the moment pass without countering, secure enough in his status not to posture. He looks over at the other man and offers his hand again.
“Well, my boy, I think we are going to have a lot of fun.” Michael grins down, and Dean realizes just how truly screwed he is.
“Master,” his sub whines, eyes fluttering. “Yes, Master, please. Make me yours. I want to be yours. Please…”
down, after all—he supported through his training. Making Cas proud is the only thing keeping him on task in this class.
Alfie looks helpless as he says, “I know, Sir, but…I just said goodbye to him in the foyer. It looks like he’s found a Dom already.”
his submissive…he’s welcome to engage in a dom/sub relationship with anyone he likes, and even threaten his own safety in the process. Dean, meanwhile, is grinning at Castiel’s outburst… And it occurs to Castiel that he’s stumbled upon a very smart, and very bratty, sub.
Castiel smirks, a little flutter of excitement in his stomach. “You’ve read up on the benefits,” he points out neutrally. “How extended roleplaying can help a high-level submissive like you truly lose yourself in the scene. Leaning into a persona can help you maintain a sense of self, even while getting outside of your own consciousness and living in the moment.”
Castiel tightens his grip, the rush of sudden pain making the man whine pleasantly. “Don’t lie to me, slut. Not if you want to be my good boy.”
“Oh, you’re doing so beautifully, my sweet girl,” Castiel coos, Princess’s head nosing at his crotch, and he realizes belatedly what his pet is up to. “Aren’t you a little minx? One cock isn’t enough for you?” Princess lets out a sound, something between a moan and a whine, that goes straight to Castiel’s cock. “Well, if you want to lick my cock that badly, Princess, I would be a cruel owner to say no.”
Castiel snorts. “Yes, well, I’m not twenty-one anymore.” For some reason the statement strikes him as odd, even forlorn, and then he remembers—he knows someone who’s twenty-one right now.
“Why were you doing research, sweetheart? Neither of us are exactly virgins,” Dean says in a whisper, eyes roaming Castiel’s body hungrily. When Castiel just gapes and doesn’t respond, Dean’s hand wanders down further, until he’s suddenly gripping the alpha’s half-hard cock. He strokes eagerly and Castiel moans at the abruptness, heart racing as his cock fills out again. “Remember that little game you just teased me with? Well, same rules apply. Tell me and you’ll get my mouth.”
Luc grins at him broadly, clapping him aggressively on the back. “‘Atta boy, Cassie.” He peeks behind Castiel’s shoulder, as if just noticing something interesting. “Does that extend to your delicious new assistant?” He whistles loudly, and suddenly, all the attention is on Dean.
“Yeah, I wasn’t sure what to do about that.” Sam shrugs, flopping back down on the bed with Dean settling beside him.
Castiel looks away, feeling his cheeks begin to heat. He thinks Gabriel will tease him for it, but instead, he raises his glass and says, “Hear hear! I can see why you broke your rules for this one, Cassie. I like him.”
Castiel begins licking and kissing at his neck, and he feels his skin begin to prickle as his hole clenches in need.
The blue eyes turn to him now and look over Dean’s face like he's assessing for injuries or something. “I am sure you could have, but you shouldn’t have to.” The man hesitates a second as they stare at each other and fuck, why does he have the sudden urge to drop to his knees in front of this guy?
“Focus, Castiel,” he scolds out loud. The faster he gets his work done, the faster he’ll be able to seek Dean out again. He’s halfway through reading a troubling thread of emails, featuring some of his least favorite alphas—Lucifer and Dick Roman—when he hears a knock on his door.
“You both will be staying with us. We already worked it out,” Bobby grunts and looks at John, who gives a small nod of agreement.
Suddenly the Alpha had moved right in front of him, dipping his head to catch Dean’s eye. “You don’t owe me anything, Dean. I was happy to help you. I know you’d do the same.”
Castiel laughs under his breath, wondering how he can be so gone on this man that he momentarily loses his mind every time they’re intimate. He takes the pad of his thumb and follows an unusual impulse, rubbing his come into Dean’s skin, breath hitching as Dean’s eyes widen. Eventually his fingers join the party, massaging Dean’s cheeks and chest with come.
“Dean! What’s happening? What’s going on?” Castiel calls to him, hands against the side of the cruiser.
“Hmmm, of course you would, little cockslut that you are. You’d take it wherever I give it to you, won’t you?” Castiel nuzzles at his exposed throat, and he feels utterly vulnerable at this fucking sex god's mercy. He whimpers, ‘cause fuck, he just can’t help it. “Your mine, my perfect good boy.”
“Oh fuck!” Dean cries out, and feels his orgasm tear through him at just the touch of Castiel’s hands on him. Dean’s body clamps down harder, his balls pulled up tight, and he hears a strangled sound as Castiel stills on a final thrust.
“Dean, I don’t ask much of my employees,” he begins, watching the omega’s back straighten up, “but I do ask them to be honest with me.”
“No thank you. No way. Not gonna happen.” He shakes his head, backing away as Castiel stands and eyes him.
“Yes Dean, you did very good. Such a good boy for me.” Castiel places a soft kiss on his forehead and he hums at the soft touch, wishing the lips had found his own.
When they get home Sam heads straight to his room for homework and Dean settles at the kitchen table, pulling up the link from Castiel. The page that opens contains a sixty-question test, making Dean groan immediately—he hates tests. He sees a part where he can select Sub-specific questions and tries that. He spends thirty minutes at it before he finally feels a building frustration. Surely he couldn’t fail at a test like this, but he doesn’t know how to answer anything. On a whim he picks up the phone and calls Castiel.
“Did someone do that to you?” Castiel looks heartbroken now, though that wasn’t what Dean had wanted at all. Why is this Dom so worried about him?
“Just how I like it,” Dean jokes, and sees an answering flush on Castiel’s cheeks. He gives himself a mental pat on the back for flipping the tables and leads the way toward the trail head. They hike in relative silence, Castiel stopping to take pictures every so often, camera hung around his neck at the ready.
Castiel’s anger fades quickly to concern, then endearment, and he leans into Dean’s personal space, inches from the temptation of his mouth—that perfect, pink, plump mouth.
He nods and smiles, giving Benny a half hug. He turns to wave a goodbye to the man when his eyes catch a downright terrifying sight. His dom is standing at the front desk, eyes blazing and shoulders stiff.
"Who is this?" A tall, older black man with a rifle resting on his shoulder looked Sam up and down and gestured with his free hand.
the bathtub scene,” his sub supplies easily, but Cas just blinks at him. “Really? Am I surrounded by people who know nothing about pop culture?”
Dean resists the urge to squirm. Naked and draped across Castiel’s lap, he’s lost count of how many times he’s come to the edge only for Castiel to pull him back.
Gather round, story time my friends, get your snacks, find a comfortable spot, don't worry I'll wait... you all good? Okay posting another chapter! and its a roller coaster fair warning, but I am excited to share with you all, plus secret time, its my birthday so what better time to post. Hope you all have a great weekend, see you in the comments! (also I will respond to all your comments from last week tomorrow it was just a crazy week but I read and loved them all!)
He showers on autopilot, trying to push out the thoughts of all the shared baths and showers he had with Dean in this very tub. He wonders if it’s worse for him, living alone again in the space they shared. He feels an ache of guilt and remorse when he pictures Dean missing him, wanting him, calling out for him. But he shakes his head, reminding himself of the twelve unanswered text messages he’s sent the other man. Dean has moved on, and even though it’s becoming increasingly obvious that Castiel never will, he has to let Dean go and stop trying to contact him. He clearly wants nothing to do with Castiel anymore—a thought that makes him sick to his stomach—but what can he do? Castiel wasn’t enough of a Dom to keep Dean happy and healthy, and that’s all that matters.
“You know I’m here for you boys. You can always come here. I’m sure whatever’s wrong, we can figure it out together.”
“And you love to see me beg,” Dean flirts back, voice low and tantalizing. He wraps his hand around the back of Castiel’s neck, fingers brushing his hair, and Castiel is soothed by the feeling almost instantly. He pushes the game box to the side, then lays horizontal on the quilt, shifting Dean beside him until his head is on Castiel’s chest.
“Yeah, I’m ready to go.” Sam folds up the blanket and heads out toward the Impala with Dean on his heels.
Castiel’s voice sounds so confident, and Dean supposes if Castiel is there, maybe he can get through this.
He watched Dean's hand move in long curved strokes over the page, pencil in hand. Castiel settled into his position, which was comfortable enough, and kept his breathing shallow. Dean worked, glancing up frequently and sticking his tongue out to the side while he sketched.
He opens the document to find a multiple choice list with the title “Willing & Able?” at the top. Most of the questions are a bit more straightforward.
“Hey there, sunshine. You got a good night's sleep, I hope.” Gordon grins at him, and Dean has never hated the man more. Too exhausted to reply, he just waits to see if Gordon came to gloat or what. “Alright princess, over to me. Hands out.”
Castiel closes his eyes, letting the feeling of Dean’s hand clasped around his face calm him down. “I know you are. I’m reminded of Jimmy often, actually, when I look at you and Sam. There’s a bond there that most people won’t understand, but I do.”
“Because I have a feeling you won’t like what I’m about to say,” she says with a chuckle, waving the bartender back over. A few minutes later, the sting of liquor travels down Castiel’s throat, and he has an overwhelming impulse to text Dean and see how he’s doing. They’ve never actually exchanged phone numbers though—they’ve never had a reason to—and Castiel regrets that oversight. He’s officially drunk at a bar and he misses his sweet boy.
He thinks maybe he can work this to his advantage, though, and get a much-needed spanking. “Maybe I was tired of waiting, Master,” the sub replies cheekily. The hand lifts from his hair as a boot presses on his shoulder blades, keeping him pinned in place.
Ruby stopped by to check in, bringing burnt coffee for them. Sam thanked her, and she leaned over his shoulder, planting a soft kiss behind his ear. A shiver ran down his back, and the breath of her perfume made his head swim.
“Well, I don’t know shit about fancy parties…but I’m sure I can figure it out.” Dean is already thinking of a few local places he thinks could use the help.
Dean only hesitates a moment before shaking the man’s hand. He gets a faint whiff of alpha off him, but it's hard to tell in a full room like this, and hardly anyone wore blockers to the ball. He seems friendly enough though, and is currently blocking Dean from view.
“The comb? Yes, it’s essentially just wax. Most of it will dissolve in your mouth,” he says. He drags a finger through the pool of honey on his palm, brings it to his mouth, and sucks—moaning a little when the sweetness hits his tongue. Dean watches him with rapt attention, licking his lips.
“No, I believe she’s at the impound lot,” Castiel says casually, musing that he’s never given his car a pronoun before—
“Dean,” he moans, fisting the sheets as lust overtakes him. Dean swallows and the movement nudges at Castiel’s cockhead, the alpha winding a hand down to Dean’s hair and tightening. Castiel knows from experience that his omega likes a little pain with his pleasure, but it’s a fine line to walk, so he always waits for a signal of approval from Dean. The omega hums in acknowledgment, looking up at Castiel with pleasure in eyes, so Castiel does it again. “So beautiful like this, baby…”
—but he knows Missouri is right. He nods, feeling his eyes begin to water for the millionth time today. What a disaster the day has become…an hour ago, he was buying Dean a promise ring. Now he has to comfort his younger brother from a terrifying rape attempt—an attempt Castiel’s actions undoubtedly instigated.
“I know, pretty boy, 'cause I am not going to break you,” Castiel replies, continuing his steady back and forth as he works his way in, letting Dean’s body adjust. Once he is fully seated, Castiel’s hand reaches under him, giving his cock a squeeze through his silk panties.
Pamela nods in agreement. “I was surprised to see you back in the training saddle. You won’t be taking on his care, then, Sir?”
He reaches the end of the drive and holds a hand up as he squints out across the pasture. Two horses stand at the far end, grazing. He leans against the fence a moment, watching them. Tails swishing at the flies, they move slowly together across the field. He thinks they look pretty peaceful. Must be a simple life. He gets caught up in watching them and jumps when he hears a loud whack sound beside him.
, he thinks belatedly, but doesn’t admonish himself too much. For an endangered sub like Dean, having an appetite at all is a step in the right direction.
No, not his friend—FlyBoy wouldn’t do that to him. They’ve been friends for almost a year, he tells FlyBoy everything…well, almost everything. He doesn’t tell him that sometimes he likes to wear a collar and have his dom tell him what a good little bitch he is. He’ll never have to, ‘cause apparently, Cas already knows. He knows everything about Dean, about his family, his job, his favorite movies, his love of puns and all his crazy kinks. It’s too much to handle…he feels exposed, and maybe even betrayed.
Castiel has seated himself at a patio table with Missouri and seems to be enjoying two juicy cheeseburgers. Dean can’t help but smile—he loves when the alpha enjoys his food. Castiel catches him looking and points at the burger, making a face of pure joy and sending him a thumbs-up. Dean smiles hard, blushing, and turns back to his own food.
“So…” He clears his throat, taking a long swig of beer. “Sorta feel like we gotta talk about the elephant in the room.”
“Two can play at this game,” Dean says ominously, though he doesn’t expand or explain himself. The thought of his sub teasing him, though, sets Castiel’s heart racing. They need to get in public, immediately, before he ends up pulling this car over and unzipping Dean’s pants…
“Just came to say goodnight, little omega.” Roman grins, and Dean is shocked as always that his teeth aren’t actually filed to points.
“Yeah, he took her over to his place and is gonna start hunting down parts for me.” Dean spins his bottle in his hands and picks at the label. “Someone’s been taking care of her. No mice in the engine, not even dust on her.”
He isn’t sure why he says it, but he feels like he needs Cas to know that, to know that the house wasn’t always this way. That this house did feel like home once, a long time ago, and that it stopped being his home when his mother died. He doesn’t know how to say all that, though.
“It's alright, though if Oscar tosses me on my ass Rowena will never let me hear the end of it.” Castiel tries for a smile but Dean can’t seem to shake the scowl now.
The subject seems closed the moment Ellen walks through the doorway, carrying a hefty casserole dish containing a cheesy red lasagna. Castiel spends the rest of dinner overloading on carbs and having a conversation with Jo about beginning the hiring process soon for a new head of security. Castiel used to think that their surveillance cameras and nightly alarm systems were enough, but now that the Winchesters are staying under his roof, a little extra precaution couldn’t hurt.
Dean’s eyebrows knit together, a flash of anguish crossing his otherwise beautiful face. It terrifies Castiel.
Dean feels a bit in shock. He’s never seen anyone stand up to his dad like that before. Bobby and Sam sit back down, both wearing pretty impressed smiles on their faces. Castiel gives his leg a squeeze and Dean comes back to himself. He feels a bit embarrassed, but at the same time, he feels incredibly proud to have a Dom like Cas who cares so much about him.
“Yes, we have thirty-five stalls and an indoor riding arena. There’s also an outdoor arena in the back and round pen for training.” He only really understands half of what she's saying, but nodding and smiling seems to be working for him so he goes with that. He follows her through the barn, down a long aisle coming out toward the back, and he blinks at the sudden sunlight. Eyes adjusting, he sees a man standing down a ways in the middle of a circular metal pen…
Castiel nervously fidgeted as he waited on the stone steps of Nick's estate, his suitcase at his side. He had spent the previous evening up late with Charlie, trying to come up with a good option for getting Dean out of Nick's clutches. Castiel had been hoarding his money over the past year. Not hard since Nick was paying him nearly six times his previous job. He figured if he waited for the right time, he could offer to buy Dean from Nick. He would have to wait till Nick was tired of him though, since he would be unlikely to agree to it before then. He mused over planting the seed with Nick that he would be interested in that when the door opened to a surly scowl, Gordon looking out at him.
“Yeah, alpha, let’s go to bed.” Despite his misgivings Dean crawls off the alpha, offering him his clean hand to hold as they sneak off for the west wing.
“Wanna…” Dean swallows, and Castiel peers up at him, noticing his pupils dilated and his eyes fluttering closed. “Wanna taste
“I love you,” Castiel says between kisses, realizing that he feels lighter than he has in months now that he’s finally told Dean how he’s feeling.
“Another traditional choice is cat, though I’d say you’re too high-energy to be a cat. Perhaps a kitten?”
They start clearing up the piles of paperwork, trying to make some semblance of order for the police to sort through.
“He’s underage and off limits,” Castiel says sharply. “The latter of which applies to everyone in my household, by the way. I’m quite sure no one here is interested in being your next conquest.”
“Come with me, sugar. We will get you all settled in and I can take you on a tour.” Missouri pats his arm and heads in the other direction, past the kitchen. Dean spares a small glance after where Castiel has vanished before following after her. There is a long hallway lined with doors and he notices wooden name plates hanging on them. They stop at a door with the “D. Winchester” sign and Missouri opens the door for him.
“I don’t know, but let's go to the main desk and see if we can find out. It's not over yet,” Castiel says the last part to Dean, seeing the fear etched on his face.
The taste of blood slowly goes away, the weight on Dean's chest lifts with each breath. The pain in his leg drains away to a dull ache as he stares at the twisted quilt in his lap. He pries his hands from the bed frame, moving to sit up as the vertigo gives him a rush of nausea.
In fact, in this moment he loathes them completely. Each of their faces comes to his mind, their lewd sneers posed and ready.
Dean slid on the old, worn AC/DC tee shirt and pulled up the boxers. Both were a bit large on his thin frame and he looked at the fabric, pulling at it. Castiel wondered when the last time he wore clothing was.
“S’nothing. Least I could do for, uh, walking in on you all—” He coughs, takes another long inhale of the room, before walking backwards through the threshold. “See you tomorrow?”
Another vicious smack lands on his other thigh and he gasps in a breath, shuddering at the shock of pain. “Tell me how much you like it, pet,” the words are growled out as his master bends down by his ear.
He spent the afternoon working on his laptop in the living room, stealing occasional glances at the sleeping man on the couch. He then began to wonder where Dean slept in the house, and where the other slaves did, for that matter.
“I do mean it. You’re mine, and I’m yours.” Castiel inches closer, and the smell of him is so incredibly good Dean could cry from the relief of it.
“I thought you promised not to ride Cash without Ellie or I there,” Castiel scolds, and if he throws a little dominance in his tone he simply can’t help it.
Distantly, Castiel hears twigs snapping, the patter of rain against the tarp, and then, the sound of the zipper being raised on his tent. Fear grips him for a moment, and he scrambles around for his camping lantern around the same time he hears Dean mutter, “Son of a bitch.”
Castiel sends up his number first, wasting no time in placing his bid. The amounts inch up quickly, the slaughter house buyers don’t even bother bidding, but Alistair and another bidder he doesn’t know keep driving up the price. Castiel licks his lips as he throws his paddle up again for eighteen hundred dollars.
He came in the room, sitting on the edge of the bed next to Dean. His pulse quickened in proximity to the man. Castiel’s long graceful fingers felt his head and then gripped his wrist, taking his pulse.
“All done now, good boy. You did so well. Just beautiful, Dean.” Castiel’s voice is like a balm to all his aches and biting pain. He nods in response—he
He pulls out his phone and sends a quick text to Castiel with his email address. He watches Castiel jump a little when his phone buzzes and he tilts his head at the screen. “Send me the test, alright. I’ll fill it out and send it back to you, but I don’t know how long it will take me.”
He lies curled up on the floor, and has a moment where a chuckle breaks from his lips. He realizes he’s in the same position he would lie in when he was once Princess, lying on the couch next to Cas. He wishes he was back in that safe space where his person—his Master—was watching over him and doting on him. He’ll probably never feel that satisfied and peaceful again. He wishes for the hundredth time he could’ve been a submissive that would’ve matched with Cas, would’ve been worthy enough of a Dom like him.
“Well I clung to Blanca for dear life till she swung close to the fence and I made a jump for it. I managed to roll under the fence before Blaze came after me. With me gone she set her sights on Balthazar and chased him out of the paddock as well. We had to wait an hour for the girls to calm down and Frank to help us get the tack off Blanca. Luckily everyone was okay and Frank, finally seeing the danger in leaving us unsupervised, told us just to pet and groom the horses from then on.”
Just as suspected, the bartender cashes out his tab, passing Castiel his debit card and an incredibly lengthy bill. Luckily he’s too wasted to even register the money he’s just spent, signing off with a generous tip and wandering over to his brother. He’s still sipping his whiskey and thinking about ‘67 and his sub…and that…that is the last thing Castiel remembers for a long, long time.
Castiel grimaces, wishing more than anything that he could bring himself to lie to Dean right now, to let him have some much earned rest—no matter how momentary. Instead, he mutters, “Well, that’s the other thing I need to tell you…”
“He’ll need medical attention soon—immediately after lunch, I’d say.” Castiel pulls up a chair across from her desk, settling in on the cushion. “When he arrived earlier, his subamine was a two. Luckily, we had a quick spanking session that turned his cheeks a gorgeous shade of red—” He brings a hand down Dean’s spine, trailing a finger down his skin. “—and his resistance and irritability seemed to diminish quickly after orgasming. Still, I expect his blood work will reveal dangerous hormone levels, so it will be necessary to use the most stringent training schedule possible for lasting results.”
Gadreel, at the very least, has the decency to look devastated. “The minute I heard the commotion, I came to help—”
Maybe he should just get it over with and go to Roman, serve his time, learn his place. He’s sure Cas would let Sam stay, would keep him safe. He’s not good enough—he’ll never be good enough for Castiel, and it feels like it's killing him. Hurting his body and his pride has to be better than hurting his heart.
Hey folks! I got a chapter done during all the life madness! and yes its been utter madness and its only beginning. I did a quick look and we aren't that far from the end guys so hang in there.
Castiel takes a cautious sip of his drink, looking around the crowded bar. “Not particularly, though I’ve yet to make the rounds,” he says truthfully.
“Sounds good, see you soon, then.” Dean watches as the man hesitates, staring right into his eyes and fixing him in place.
They head down to their office, settling into the respective chairs. Dean rubs at his temples as he scans through Castiel’s calendar for the day. He catches Cas watching through the door. Smiling, he licks up a stray drip of coffee off his mug just a bit slower than necessary, watching the way the alpha’s Adam's apple bobs and hands tighten into fist. He can’t help but wink as Castiel gives him a half-hearted admonishing scowl. “I hate you,” the alpha mouths to him.
He nods, pulling himself up in bed a minute. He glances at the clock…it took him hours fucking himself on that toy to get his latest orgasm. His body is still milking the plastic knot and he’d be more embarrassed about Sam being in the room if he had the energy.
Castiel stops walking, looking at her dubiously. “That’s tempting, but I have a lot of paperwork to catch up on—”
“Go on, Kevin is waiting,” Castiel chides him. Dean reaches over for his computer, tucking it under his arm. He plants one more soft kiss on his alpha’s cheek, enjoying the heat of his skin.
He adjusts himself a little, taking a big gulp of his whiskey and sucking in air at the burn in his throat. As he glances around the room again, his eyes fall on a man leaning against the wall. He can practically feel the heat of his gaze on his skin, and he can hardly pull his eyes away to admire the dark hair and broad shoulders.
They shake their heads mutely and Castiel says, “Good. Now excuse me, I have much more pressing matters to attend to.” He turns to Gadreel, who looks every bit as formidable as ever, though even he looks a little nervous when Castiel places the bowie knife back in his palm.
“You gotta eat some food, Sam, believe me…it only gets harder to stomach food later, okay? Eat up.” He watches as Sam nods, grabbing the plate and eating some begrudgingly. Dean holds the box tightly on his lap and waits till Sam eats most of his food and drinks a glass of water.
“Hello,” greets a petite woman in a white coat, walking in with a warm smile. Her short brown hair frames her face, and Dean thinks he probably would have hit on a girl like this in a past life. “Are you Dean?”
Dean draws in a deep breath before letting it out. He glances over at Cas to see a calm, confident look on his face. “I just have a lot riding on this you know? And I really want it to work but this gonna be really fucking hard.” He thinks about having to spill his guts about all his worst memories and suppresses a shiver. It goes against every repression instinct he has to deny and deflect and avoid the darkest parts of himself.
“Want me to come with you?” Castiel asks, following Dean’s lead in sitting up. He presses a hand to Castiel’s chest, urging him to lie back again.
“If I had god powers, y’think I’d let my tent get flooded?” he gripes, crossing his arms against his chest. Castiel finishes enclosing them in, then sighs, reaching for the lantern again and setting it closer to Dean. His clothes are truly drenched, the cotton soaked through in a way that makes Dean’s nipples appear perky and tempting through his shirt. Castiel swallows a dry lump in his throat and attempts to look away.
He gets so distracted talking to Cas that he doesn’t notice the time...Cas has been on the treadmill twelve minutes already. “That's good enough. Now I can show you some stretches.” He turns off the machine and waits as Castiel moves slowly toward his work table. Dean pats the top of it. “Up you go,” he says, and winks at Cas, who bites his lip a moment before hopping up to sit on the table. Dean guides him to lay back with his knees bent, and snags a pillow to put under his head. “Alright, I can show you a few stretches you can do in the morning and at night, okay?”
He yanks the door open and bolts down the hallway. His cock is rock hard now as he banks around a corner and runs into the open courtyard. Benny and Hannah are sitting on a bench, chatting with a sub he doesn’t know kneeling nearby.
“What? Oh, apologies.” He clears his throat, glancing out the window again, eyes fixated on an unremarkable stone column. “No, let’s head home.”
“Damn right, ya idjit,” Bobby says from the opposite corner. “Thought you could get kidnapped and nobody would come to your rescue?”
Waiting in line for movie tickets, Dean starts running through his checking account in his head. He thinks he still has enough for the tickets and some popcorn at concessions. They may need to head home after and eat some of Ellen’s leftover lasagna for dinner, though. It’ll be pretty late when they get out, anyway.
“Started working nights here for some extra dough since it’s a little slow at the diner. How you two been?” Benny asks, leaning on the counter and looking Dean up and down. “You look good, brother.”
“No! No, don't do that. I'll just have a talk with Cain tonight and let him know he crossed a line.”
“Oh um, working at a horse farm near my house.” He shrugs, thinking it doesn’t sound as glamorous as owning his own business. “Nothing compared to what Kevin would have done.” He says the words without thinking and then looks up slightly horrified. “I’m so sorry I—”
Dean laughs at that. “Dude, that is the most unsexy way to say that. How can you be so awesome and terrible at dirty talk at the same time?”
“Glad you approve.” Castiel leans forward and kisses the side of his mouth. “Hmmm, my sweet boy is even sweeter.”
Dean gives Ellen a hug, then she makes a point to sweep Castiel up into one more hug as well. “You take care of my boy now. He’s so used to taking care of everyone else, he deserves someone looking out for him too.”
“I…” Cas swallows, trying to figure out what to say and how to say it. His eyes are glued to Dean’s face, searching for signs of distress. His expression has changed so much over the last few minutes that Castiel isn’t sure how Dean’s feeling about what’s just transpired between them. Just because Dean has shown interest in the past doesn’t mean he wants to get accosted by an aroused, half-crazed alpha in the hallway of his home.
Dean gnaws on his lip nervously. “Well, it’s just…” He adjusts the small laptop in his lap, where he’s been keying in notes for Castiel in case he needs them later. “I don’t exactly keep up with the news either, but Sammy says this guy is bad news.”
He keeps track of her blood pressure, which is lower than he would like. He gives her a fluid bolus and once her pressure improves he gives her some fentanyl to help ease the pain. The team moves quickly, and soon Dean can see the night sky above him, one step closer to getting his patient out. It’s then that he looks up to see medflight landing, two medics jumping out as they make for one of the other overturned vehicles, ready to take the patient from the medics on the ground. It’s just a glance, barely longer than a heartbeat as he looks harder and sees a familiar square jaw and deep commanding eyes. He’s pretty sure he’s hallucinating, because there is no way in hell that medic is also…his dom.
“He–he wants you,” Sam says in a rush. “But he said he’s scared… He’s practically incoherent, Cas, but he keeps saying he’s scared of you finding something out.”
“I’ll make sure we follow all your directions,” Castiel says dutifully, with a nod. Dean can’t help but smile, a bit feeling relieved just hearing Castiel say
Dean sighs dramatically, mutters incoherently, and begins to strip his shirt, struggling with the collar until it’s lifted up and off his head, and the shirt is tossed away in a wet heap. Castiel’s early suspicions had been right—Dean’s nipples are pert and pink and he swipes a tongue against his lips, fighting the urge to straddle his friend. He suspected that Dean had wanted to kiss him earlier, around the campfire, but the rain had been an interruption. Perhaps now, given the circumstances, the rain is giving them a second chance.
“You,” Castiel whispers, kissing his nose lightly. It’s too dark to see, but if Cas had to bet, there’s a good chance Dean has begun to blush. “Thank you for putting the effort in. I’m sorry your plans got ruined.”
“Thanks,” he says, letting out a shaky breath he hopes the alpha doesn’t notice. “You don’t wear your tie backwards anymore. How do people tell you and your twin apart?” Dean asks turning to face the alpha now, but unable to bring himself to step any further away. He tries to imagine two of Castiel and it about melts his brain.
Dean purrs into his ear the more he scents Cas, whispering, “Fuck, so good…feels amazing, alpha… I feel better than I have in days.”
“I better get going. I like to have time to settle and find my headspace. Have a good scene!” Alfie pats him on the shoulder and heads off in the other direction. Dean watches the tall man as he tosses Dean a wink and follows Victor into his office. Heart pounding now, Dean sprints down the hallway, just wanting to get as far away from that man as possible. He nearly misses room six and stops short, letting out a shaky breath before going in.
Memories of that terrible few days come flooding back, and Dean feels physically ill at the memory. The taste of coppery blood in his mouth and the burning ache on his back. It makes him want to fall to the ground in submission and beg not to be harmed anymore. He takes a few slow, deep breaths and digs his fingers into his thighs to keep himself in the present. He will never kneel for that man again.
“How lovely,” Castiel muses, looking him over. Dean struggles not to blush too hard at the scrutiny, and really hopes he can just get the new clothes on. “Do you like being bare for me, Dean? Exposed and open for me?” Castiel’s voice sinks into a deeper, warm tone.
By the time he comes back to Sam’s room, he’s sitting on the bed, hair damp with a t-shirt and boxers on. Sam hunches over his arms wrapped around himself, sweat already starting on his brow.
He pulls Castiel to his chest, cradling the back of his head like he’s something precious to protect. The idea makes Castiel baulk, but Dean’s chest is solid and warm, his hands soothing and soft as they hold Castiel tightly. It’s the closest to content that Castiel has felt in a long time—like he’s finally exactly where he needs to be.
It takes Castiel a moment—he was practically beaten to a pulp this evening, after all—before Dean’s tone finally clicks in his mind. “Are you being sarcastic?”
At least in his head. Dean plugs it in, puts in a cassette tape and turns the volume down low. The sounds of classic rock begin to fill the room.
“The fuck!” he yells, kicking out and hitting the alpha hard in the gut. The guy goes sprawling across the floor with a yipe.
“This fucking sucks,” he huffs out, “but it isn’t your fault, Cas. It’s my debt and it’s my problem. You’ve already done so much more for me than you needed to.” He reaches a hand across the grass, needing to touch his alpha. Castiel hesitates a moment before his own hand crawls across the grass to grip Dean's. “I wanna be with you, Cas… Fuck Roman, and fuck the contract, okay?”
Sam swallows hard and nods, sliding into the driver’s seat and starting the ignition. Castiel shuts the door behind him and then Sam pulls out of the parking lot, driving fast. Castiel puts Dean’s head in his lap, touching his clammy forehead and whispering sweet nothings in his ear.
“He’s a menace, Sir,” Gordon growls again, putting the bloody towel down and taking an ice pack from the woman.
Castiel nearly drops the fishing pole. “I’m not wearing my blockers,” he mumbles aloud, the realization just occurring to him. “I…I’m so sorry, Dean, I didn’t do that on purpose.”
“Yes, he seems to be a very generous alpha. He has offered to simply take ownership of the properties as payment of your debt, instead of the money. Since the properties are valued at well over the amount owed, this is an acceptable payment method by your contract terms. Mister Novak specifically added in that—if you were to choose this avenue—that any remaining profit made from the sales would be put into a trust for you and your brother.”
“Rise and shine, Sammy!” Dean calls, banging on Sam’s door. He gets only a disgruntled groan in reply. “Your breakfast is getting cold!” he tries again, and is still ignored.
“Good morning, Dean. I trust you slept well?” Castiel’s voice is like a warm, silky rumble and it makes his stomach do backflips.
Castiel had looked so confused, and when he had scented him, that Alpha growl - dear God, it sent such a tremble down his spine and not completely in the bad way. He was just so thankful that Castiel hadn't scented that hint of arousal on his part or he would be even more mortified... or even more fucked, literally if Castiel had decided to go all Alpha knot head on him.
Dean can’t help but roll his eyes as he leans against the truck. “It’s Castiel, which is apparently the name of an angel I guess.” He’d googled the name quickly when Cas had told him the name, and didn’t find any social media accounts, but did find a wikipedia page on an angel with the same name. Kinda poetic that a flight medic is named after an angel, seems meant to be. And Dean doesn’t even believe in that destiny shit.
it’s totally reasonable for him to be worried. But in the end, he trusts Dean implicitly, trusts their relationship to get him through even the most difficult of days.
"Do you have any more updates for us? There have been rumblings that the Perditions have some big plans in the mix and we hope to stay one step ahead of them."
“I let you sleep in a little since you had a long night. Up and in the shower now, then meet me in the kitchen with just the collar on.” Castiel leans over and plants a soft kiss on his forehead before leaving the bedroom door left slightly ajar behind him.
Dean tucks his phone in his pocket and pulls up the hood of his sweatshirt, feeling a chill from the breeze off the water. Maybe he should have brought his leather jacket. Hands shoved in his hoodie, he picks up the pace, heading for the pub. He gets there with a few minutes to spare and finds an empty booth in the back. He rubs his hands over his arms in an attempt to heat up, his leg bouncing under the table.
“Of course I do, but I can’t take that risk. I can make it through this. I've done it alone for years, this is just another heat. Don’t worry so much.” He manages to pat his brother's arm before he slides back low on the bed, his heat amping up again. As Sam gets up to leave he calls out to him. “Don’t tell him, Sam, about the bite.”
“Yeah, he won’t care,” Sam says, almost bitterly. That almost guarantees that John has no idea where Sam is, and maybe Sam is right and he truly doesn’t care. Castiel’s chest aches at the thought.
Dean returns quickly, coming behind Castiel and dropping the coffee mug beside his open palm. He stretches over, a hand on Castiel’s shoulder as he grabs Castiel’s empty plate from lunchtime. Something about the contact makes Castiel’s skin feel warm, his forehead clammy, and he stands up in a rush. Before he’s quite aware what’s happening, he’s pushed Dean against the wall.
"Sounds great," Castiel flashed him his megawatt smile that always made Dean feel like his brain was gonna short circuit. Dean moved into Castiel's space and paused, the tension becoming electric between them. He breathed in the familiar honey scent, and ever so slowly bent to kiss him again. It was soft and unhurried, like it would be one of many kisses. He loved the taste of him the smell of him and he heard that voice in his head chanting quietly,
Dean siddles up next to him, falling in step just behind his shoulder. He focuses on keeping his calm, not wanting to worry Dean any more than he already is. His own stomach in the meantime is doing flip flops.
looks familiar.” He tilts his head, frowning, and Castiel takes the momentary reprieve to check his messages. Surprisingly, it’s his Signal app…and even more surprisingly, the messages are all from Dean.
“I hate that he hurt you.” Castiel’s voice is a thick rumble and he feels that mouth latch on to his skin, over the aching bite.
“You have a lot of equipment here,” Castiel muses, walking around the room. Dean watches his gait, thinking it's time to start loosening that leg up.
“So good for me. What a perfect boy you are, just amazing, Dean.” Castiel's praise barely registers as Dean lets himself float, riding the euphoric high. Castiel shifts a hand behind him, undoing the rope on his wrists and in one smooth move manages to sweep Dean up in a bridal carry.
Dean heads toward Sam’s room, peeking his head inside. It's been two weeks since the incident at the movie theater, but Dean can’t seem to get out of his own head. Sam had actually accused him of brooding the other day.
“Night Carrie!” He calls after her, and she flips him off on her way out. He grabs his own bag and heads for the parking lot. He smiles at the sight of his car, the sleek black ‘67 Impala is his Baby and sliding into her is like coming home. The engine roars to life as he looks back at his phone.
“I assure you, I’m just trying to make you comfortable,” Castiel says evenly, trying to remind himself that Dean has only had terrible interactions with alphas in the past. He has no reason to believe Castiel is trustworthy, particularly after being manhandled in the hallway just days ago. He drops his hand deftly, hands rolling into fists. “May I…continue?”
But Castiel has never been a traditional dom, which means he never wants to offer his sub everything he’s expecting. He’d rather surprise him, provoke him in a way that makes his stomach flip, his heart flutter, his cock grow hard and leaking before he even understands why.
Castil frowns, but shakes his head understandably. A moment later, he slips out of the room when no one is looking, heading for his office. He has no intention of working today—something that would’ve been unheard of this time last year—but he needs some privacy for what he has to do next.
“Your gonna burn ’em if you don’t flip soon,” Rufus grumbles, reaching for Bobby’s tongs. Bobby proceeds to smack his hand with them and shakes them like a damn weapon.
"I don't care, I can't stay here a second longer. You don't need to cover for me, just don't get in my way." Jo pushed past Tessa and stomped off toward the kitchens. Dean waited till Tessa was gone as well before going down the stairs. He couldn't think about eating breakfast with the return of Nick - he wasn't sure he could keep anything down. For a brief moment he contemplated hiding from Cas, not thinking he could bear to watch the man leave. He also knew if he wasn't in position waiting for his Master, there would be hell to pay.
“I will never stop wanting you, my beautiful, intelligent, kind, funny omega. I can never get enough of you, Dean, and I will spend as long as it takes to convince you of that.” Castiel nuzzles at his throat, continuing to scent mark him. “I’m so sorry I hurt you. I never want to hurt you,” Castiel rumbles, pressing him against the wall of the pool. Dean wraps his legs around Castiel’s hips, pulling him in close.
He shuffles around in old sleeping for a few minutes before he finally gets comfortable enough to drift off. He doesn’t know how long he’s been asleep when he hears a snapping sound. He blinks his eyes open, reaching for his flashlight and points it around the tent. There’s a large dip in the center of his tent with a broken support rod, and he only has a second to think,
“You're kidding!” Dean exclaims and Oscar startles a little till Cas calms him with a pat to the shoulder. “Sorry,” Dean mumbles.
Castiel peers down at the man’s naked body, still covered in his quickly cooling come. “I’ve done that quite thoroughly, my lo—” Castiel breathes in sharply, aware that he was just about to say
Another shock quickly follows, and Dean scrambles back into a kneeling position. He blinks in the darkness and realizes they are watching him. Closely. His night just got a whole lot longer.
“Of course. There's a charger by the table.” Castiel smiles, looking a bit relieved just at Dean’s presence. Dean knows Castiel has been making big changes with his business, and not all of them have been easy on him to make.
“Omega,” Castiel whispers, leaning over to lick desperately over the hickey he left last night on Dean’s neck. “Did I mention I love seeing you marked up? I love knowing you're mine.”
Castiel chuckles and spins Dean around, one hand on his hip and the other cupping his jaw. “That sounds like it would’ve been amazing. But you know what’s even more amazing?”
“She’s kinda rude… I dunno, Cas, I just get a bad vibe,” Dean says quietly. Castiel wonders if they were alone if maybe Dean would expand on this. He likely should’ve asked him his opinion in private.
Castiel just hums noncommittally and doesn’t respond. Finally, he says in a level voice, “Thank you for coming, Lucifer, but I don’t believe this opportunity sounds like a good fit for me.”
? I mean, it just usually happens that way. You know people see me and expect me to be a certain way, you know?”
He feels Dean shift around in his lap, feels lips press to his forehead. “Oh, alpha…” Dean noses against Castiel’s neck, leaving kisses on his scent glands that makes Castiel want to purr. “My generous, smart, perfect alpha. You know I’m the one not worthy of you, right?”
“Here, hun, just down to your underwear. And put on this johnny for me.” The nurse hands him a hospital gown and sends him into the standard examining room. He feels his skin itch at the idea of stripping down, but he can suck it up. Plus, they never allow alphas into the omega clinic. Once changed, he shakily lifts himself onto the paper covered examine table, staring down at his knees.
“Did he attend orientation?” he asks, his voice a steely rumble. He stands up straight, fidgeting with his unruly tie. His suit jacket is on the back of his chair in his office, abandoned along with the paperwork he was right in the middle of completing.
Nodding his head, he gives Cas a smile, “I’m good, alpha.” He really is too, he is right where he needs to be and nothing else matters in this moment. To prove his point, he lifts up a little before lowering himself back down, shivering as he feels the cock nudge at his prostate.
He gets so carried away with his fantasy that he’s half-hard and totally ignoring his phone, and when he looks back down he has a string of unread messages.
The door opens and Castiel strides in with a long billowing trench coat hanging off his shoulders. He looks around before those stormy eyes lock onto Dean. He weaves through the crowd with ease, a calm sort of grace to his movement, each step calculated.
Castiel fights the urge to grimace. He knows it’s a necessary activity for any omega in heat, but it’s still difficult to think about Sam as anything but a scared kid calling out for his older brother.
“Was it difficult, pet?” The tone sounds indifferent and it makes him yearn for his dom’s attention.
“I, uh, remember a little of that stuff.” Honestly, he didn’t pay much attention when health class talked about the difference between dominants’ and submissives’ hormones. He isn’t ruled by his hormones, thank you very much.
“Falling in love, huh Samsquatch?” Dean grins, kinda secretly loving the idea of his brother being that happy.
Dean smiles at Sam, swinging an arm around his shoulder. “Don’t you fear, little brother. You’re gonna be so freakin’ spoiled here.” Some of the ache in his chest eases seeing how excited his brother is, and knowing that he’s here and safe where he should be. He can’t wait to show Sam how awesome their digs are, and he decides just to focus on that right now and clear his mind of unavailable, uninterested alphas.
“Guess so.” He shrugs, pulling on a zip-up hoodie Sam had given him. He realizes he is wearing his own sweatpants and t-shirt. “Who got my stuff from Cain?”
“Oh, I do not trust you,” Castiel says plainly. “Nor do I agree with your politics, your business methods, or any opinion you hold.”
He jogs toward the entrance and slows to a walk, peering around the turn before entering the ring. He finds Dean and Cash at the far end walking around the track. Castiel takes a moment to watch—Dean’s posture is nice and upright and his hips are soft and open, rolling with the stride. His hands are wide and low, his heels are down in the stirrups, his legs aren’t swinging. He’s always more shocked then he probably should be, but Dean is a natural rider.
“Oh fuck,” he cries out, bucking his chest up into the touch, his cock quickly hardening again after having gone soft.
“It’s okay. I’m not angry,” Chuck says with a small smile. “He’s your brother—of course you’d want to stay in touch.”
"Ahhh, so you're the hacker that got into the shipping companies’ records? Good work, but uh, how old are you kid?"
“Good, ‘cause you can’t leave him with Gordon…” Sam grinds his teeth as a new wave of agony apparently washes through him. “He’s a friend of my dad’s. He’s a bad guy, Cas, a bad alpha. You’ve gotta get Dean out.”
Okay its here! This is a longer chapter than normal, I could have cut it off in the middle to cliffhanger it but I just wanted this whole thing to play out all at once and so I took a little extra time to write a longer chapter. There is a scene in this that I have planned from the very beginning in fact its one of the scenes that inspired this fic and it took me this long to get here. Thanks to my editor and my betas for helping me on this chapter and thanks to my FB friends for supporting me through some writers block you guys know who you are and you rock. Oh hell we all rock, I love me some Destiel lovers <3 <3 <3 With all that said, I hope you enjoy the chapter, much love.
“None of your business.” Dean tries to push past his brother, but Sam puts up an arm to block his path. Normally a quick shot to the gut would get him out of Dean’s way, but he can’t muster the energy to move his stubborn not-so-little brother.
Dean sighs, moving back into his chair and taking a deep breath to try and gain some control again. “Okay, I’ll listen.”
Which is insane, of course, because they hardly know each other. Well, except for the part where they know each other completely, in every important way you can know someone. Intimately. Sexually. Emotionally.
We're so happy to share this update with you all. Consider it a big hug for being such amazing, faithful readers.
“Oh, god…” Castiel groans, feeling his cock twitch in Dean’s palm. He never knew he was so affected by dirty talk, but he figures anything Dean does in bed is going to affect him, one way or another. His omega is officially wearing way too many clothes, but Castiel can’t seem to protest when Dean is staring at his cock like he’s physically restraining himself from bending over and inhaling it.
“He lay a hand on you, Dean?” John’s voice sounds tight now, and Dean is almost regretting mentioning the whole thing. John had never brought it up—just taken Dean home and given him medical supplies. They never talked of it again.
“Dreamed about,” Castiel corrects, and the omega gives him a pleased smile. “I haven’t stopped thinking about you since the moment we met. I never thought you would want someone like me, but…” He trails off, particularly after seeing Dean’s flabbergasted expression.
“You are most welcome, Dean. Now come with me—I need to catch up on work and I believe you can be of use to me.” Castiel gives his shoulder a squeeze before leading him out of the suite by his leash.
Missouri’s mouth twists into a confident smile, “I didn’t hear a no. There are night classes and financial aid, you know. Could do some real good in this world with your determination, Dean Winchester—you say the word and I can help you make it happen. Sam agrees with me.” Missouri puts all the paper in her folder and sweeps back out the door.
Castiel eyes him a moment. “That’s a lot for someone to take on at your age.” Dean just shrugs again. When were they going to start talking about the kinky stuff? Castiel continues, “I am twenty-seven, by the way.”
“Delicious… And the strawberry is good, too.” He inspects the damp spot where his mouth had been, and blows cool air over glistening patch, loving how goosebumps pebble and rise onto the man’s skin.
“Have you ever been spanked?” Castiel asks, aware that this sub must not be very active in his play—otherwise, his levels wouldn’t have dropped so dangerously low.
“It was your request,” Castiel replies, and the man scowls but nods and takes another sip. It’s so adorable that Cas smiles at him, and finally does what he’s been daydreaming about for nearly two hours…he cups the man’s chin and brings their lips together. The kiss is good, too good, practically dizzying as they lean back against the pillows, lips wet and sliding together. This could escalate quickly, and he’s tempted to lick into the man’s mouth and deepen the kiss, but he pulls away instead. He leaves small kisses all over his face, remembering how his come had been there thirty minutes ago and panting slightly at the thought.
“Just promise me you’ll think about it?” Sam looks at him then with the puppy dog eyes, and if that isn’t playing dirty.
And there it is, because he's an omega he is obviously some wilting flower. Dean grits his teeth at that, 'cause god damn it, he is a grown ass man not a child, even if he is an omega. Stepping up just a little closer to Castiel, he puffs out his chest. “I’m your assistant, so if you’re discussing business I’m going to be there to help you. I promise not to let my weaker gender inhibit my quality of work.” He hates being made to feel this way—like he can’t handle himself because of what’s between his legs.
Dean couldn't hide his self-satisfied little chuckle. "That good, huh?" He ran a hand up Castiel's back and felt immensely proud to have rendered Castiel so utterly speechless.
Graduation day has arrived for our favorite submissive. Hold on to your hats, blankets, pillows, pets, or whatever is closest cause here we go. We will be in the comments waiting for you.
“Should’ve known what a cockslut like you would want.” Castiel reaches inside his boxers, pumping himself, the precome making his hand glide. “Do you want me to fuck your mouth, toy?”
Cas steps closer to the other cheek, making his steps loud and noticeable, before altering back and re-hitting the same cheek again. His sub groans at the sharp slap of the leather, and Castiel begins to fluctuate between each cheek, varying up his rhythm but never diminishing the power behind each strike. He’s going much harder than he had in the last scene, but there’s a possessive fire burning in his stomach, and he’s saying the most filthy and degrading things while his sub’s ass grows increasingly red. Cas wants to gather up every moan, every shake and shudder, every cry his sub lets out in ecstasy. He’s going to hoard them all because they belong to him, because this man is his.
Castiel heads off to his office and Dean heads off to his classes. He finds the bondage class slightly interesting, even though his dad had already taught him how to get out of most ties…a lesson that came after his incident with Alistair. The one run by a submissive named Hannah bores him to tears—he already has safewords he uses with his hook-ups: “Impala” for red and “pie” for slow down.
Castiel grips his briefcase handle, wondering if it’s possible to snap leather in half. “No more derogatory talk about Dean. He deserves your respect.”
“If you're really interested in charity work, I may have a task for you,” Castiel replies, straightening up and acting like nothing had just happened between them. It makes Dean feel strangely empty when Cas gets like this. “My brother started a charity through our corporation, and every year we have a large ball to raise money for it. Jimmy always organized it, but since then…since then Missiouri has taken over. Would you be interested in helping her with it? It's only two weeks away.”
“You always were a cocky little shit, you know that? Not in school anymore, Dean, but I still think you have a few lessons to learn.” Paul lunges for him, but Dean is ready. He ducks before landing a quick hit to the guy’s kidneys. He shoves off the wall, away from Paul, missing a punch that still grazes his cheek and knocks him back.
Dean swallows, looking almost pained at how badly he wants the pie. “I, um…” He looks down. “Well, if you really wanna know, I’m pissed off that you told me to be quiet earlier. I’m not a damn dog, Sir, and you can’t just keep me quiet whenever I do something you don’t like. I’m not gonna become some weird, sub slave in this place. Not for you, not for anybody.”
“Yes. I mean, I’m in love with him. And before you say anything, this isn’t like before, I’ve never felt like this about anyone. It's—it's—” he struggles to find the word, “it’s different. He makes the whole world spin.” When did he become some hopeless romantic, anyway? “Look, I’m not sure if he feels the same or not but if hedoes, I want to be here with him.”
He drags an empty chair across the cement floor, letting the deep, unsettling scrape fill the silent room with tension. All three of the alphas are staring at him with wide eyes, but Castiel just regards them coolly before sitting down. Gadreel stands behind him, glowering at the alphas with a threatening stance.
“Well, I guess I’ve been kinda stressed a little. My brother made me promise to give this a shot.” Dean shrugs, already cursing his brother for getting him to come here.
you need to do. I’m probably just gonna read in bed. I got all those new books today at Barnes and Noble.”
Walking down the hall, he immediately makes a beeline for the library. It's become his favorite spot in the house to just clear his head. As he slowly opens the heavy oak door, he hears a muffled sound coming from inside. He cautiously peeks his head into the room. It's bathed in moonlight, giving the room a soft blue glow to it. He hears something close to a sniffle, and looks toward the couches to see a mop of dark hair sticking up.
“I don’t think so, honey.” Ellen raises an eyebrow. “Sam and Dean are in difficult places right now, but your hands are tied. They’re strong boys, and they’ll push through on their own. The best thing you can do for them is get some rest and recuperate. They’re gonna need your support even more as the days pass.”
“You’re gonna ruin me,” the sub murmurs, a gorgeous combination of arousal and emotion evident in his voice.
“You’re going to be a good little toy for me, aren’t you?” the dom all but purrs, and Dean lets the words sink into him. “I can tell you’re eager to please.”
“There's not that much to tell.” Dean watches the alpha’s face, so open and curious as he moves to stand in front of Dean. Raising a hand, Cas brushes the back of his fingers along Dean’s jaw. Dean leans into the touch until Castiel is cupping his face. He feels the shift, like spinning wheels within him coming to a gentle stop. Just being near this man settles him in a way nothing else does.
Dean looks at the shop with Garth. It’s actually a really nice location, close to the river. They talk about what kind of food they would offer and Dean checks out the back kitchen to see a decent enough set up for a bakery. He had thought Garth was nuts to open a physical location, but the more they talk through the numbers, the more it sounds like a reasonable business venture. Garth even has an appointment with his bank for a new business loan and he wants Dean to come along.
Dean opens his mouth to reply, but he can’t think of anything to say. Sam gives Dean’s shoulder a patronizing pat before he slips out the door and heads for the garage. Dean seriously hopes he isn’t that obvious to everyone, especially since Cas wants to keep things on the downlow.
Castiel crosses his arms and nods, schooling his expression. Dean looks at him curiously, leaning in closer.
, so he works hard to breathe slowly and be patient. Castiel is wearing thin pajama pants and a light t-shirt, and has thus far refused to tell Dean why he isn’t in his normal suit and tie.
Victor makes a few minor clicks on the mouse, then brings up the sub’s profile. His name is Dean Winchester, Castiel reads, and he’s a twenty-one-year-old car mechanic from a small town in South Dakota. He’s a little over six feet, but doesn’t weigh enough for his frame. There are a few notes from his state-required six-month submissive training, and though the information is a few years old now, it notes that Dean is open sexually to male or female dominants, but responds best when dominated by men. Yes, Castiel thinks dimly, that would likely leave Anna out. And she’s the only open dominant accepting new subs today.
“He’s mine,” Castiel states simply, as if anyone could have any doubt. Castiel carries him to his office and settles down in his office chair with Dean straddling his lap and hugging himself close. He drifts in the warm feeling of content, and the slow rise and fall of Castiel’s chest and the clicking sounds of the keyboard.
“Fuck,” Dean huffs, leaning back against the vanity and accepting the cup of water Cas hands him to rinse his mouth.
“Feels fucking amazing, so wet and grips my cock just right.” His master moans again, picking up speed. “Love getting fucked, don’t you my little slut? Just love getting stuffed full and rode hard… goddamn and it’s all mine, no one else gets to feel this, do they? No matter how much they want to.”
“Oh, leave Castiel alone,” Kali defends, sorting through her purse to retrieve her compact mirror and lipstick. “He’ll meet the guy when he’s good and ready.”
“Just wanted to live out a rom com moment,” Dean chuckles, pulling back to look at that gorgeous face. “And I tried to text you and you didn’t answer.”
“My sweet boy mentioned these were sensitive.” He licks at Deans earlobe at the same time he lightly pinches the stiff nub.
“Did it make you hard?” Castiel’s eyes are totally off his papers now, watching the front tent of his sub’s panties, the metal spiral of the cock cage calling to him. “Being denied pleasure? Being at my mercy?”
Castiel fights a smile. All too soon, though, a sense of paranoia overpowers any ease he might feel in Dean’s presence. “I’m…I’m not sure that’s…”
“Still wouldn’t originate from the principle borrower, which in the case is Dean Winchester, standing in for John Winchester. It’s a nasty little clause loan sharks like Roman take particular joy in including, preventing the borrower from simply using another handout to cover their debt.”
“Not a problem at all. Just don’t work too hard, my boy.” Chuck stands up to give Castiel a hug and walk them to the door.
“Launch was a success, so yes, we are all finished. Glad I sent Charlie, though—sounds like she had her hands full.” Castiel sighs, leaning back in his office chair. Dean admires the alpha again—the rough looking stubble on his face and those broad shoulders. Just looking at Cas seems to turn Dean on. He shifts in his seat, and when Castiel looks up at him, his eyes darken.
Castiel is so dumbfounded that he stumbles headfirst into the truth. “No, that’s just me—off the scent blockers.”
“There is nothing charming about ignoring directions, nothing amusing about putting your health and safety at risk. Your tone is nothing short of insolent, which I cannot abide.”
When Dean returns downstairs a moment later, they’re all whispering about the game, strategizing the best way to win. Dean just stands at the threshold of the doorway, staring at Castiel with a warm smile on his face. Butterflies flutter around in Castiel’s stomach, and he smiles back widely, feeling truly hopeful for the first time in a long time.
“I kinda have a favor to ask.” Dean has been trying to get up the nerve all night to ask Benny. “I want to go see his mom but I…I don’t want to go alone.”
“Cas?” Dean’s hand strokes his forehead, his cheeks. “You’ve got blockers on, but I’m pretty sure I can still scent the freakout that’s happening.”
“So, Dean,” Ellen begins conversationally, though Castiel knows the tell-tale signs of an interrogation coming, “how’d you get hired on?”
“I, well…” Castiel blinks blearily around his kitchen. “Truthfully, I was about to have a pity party, which includes ordering myself a pizza.”
Castiel stands up and walks around to the front of his desk—just a foot from Dean—and leans back, arms crossed.
“Alright, we’ll take a quick break for lunch, meet back here in thirty minutes,” the instructor calls. Dean breathes a sigh of relief, snatching up the phone from the table and looking at the app. No new messages from Cas, but then again, Dean had never replied to his ones from two days ago. Maybe Cas already forgot all about him. He quickly closes the app and looks at his email. Pam has sent another email, asking if he wants to talk or needs help deciding on if he wants to continue his contract or find a new dom. Just the mention of a new dom makes him cringe. There’s only one man Dean will ever sub for again, and he hopes to hell he still wants him.
The hand on his head guides him forward and he opens wide to suck down the beautiful cock. He wastes little time bobbing his head and hollowing his cheeks, taking his dom deeper and deeper on each thrust.
“Dean!” Castiel’s voice cracks on his name like a prayer as he stills and fills Dean’s mouth. He struggles to swallow as much as he can, some dribbling out of his mouth. He sags in his binds as Castiel withdraws from his mouth carefully. Drooping to his knees he pulls Dean into a deep kiss sharing his release between them. He kisses and licks at his dom's mouth, floating on a crazy high.
. “Follow me,” Dean says instead, leading Cas to the living room couch and helping him get settled with his bum leg propped up on some pillows. “I’ll grab some ice and then we can order food.”
“Sam, can you help your dad and I with this car?” Bobby waves a worried-looking Sam over. Sam hesitates a second, looking between Dean and car, but finally decides that Dean must be okay so he heads over to Bobby.
,  he doesn’t see the point. He does open a recent text from Dr. Barnes checking in on him, reminding Dean to call if he needs anything. Even Alfie and Henrickson have texted him just to touch base, and he has to admit it makes him feel good to think they care about him.
CB: Trying not to get emotional about reaching the end of this journey is an impossible task. I can't believe what a wild ride writing this fic has been and how much fun we had, especially interacting with all of you in the comments. We have been so lucky with such amazing people to share all the fun with.
“Of course I do,” Castiel interrupts. There’s an edge to his voice and he doesn’t quite know where it came from. Normally he loves being teased by Dean, loves all their banter and flirting, but at the moment it has him all worked up. He doesn’t want to push things with Dean, doesn’t want to propel their romantic relationship into sexual territory just because it’s easy.
has very specific guidelines I have to follow,” Castiel says dryly, measuring out a few tablespoons of packed brown sugar, per Dean’s request. Dean chuckles, throwing his head back against the couch cushion and smirking.
Dean sticks a finger down, spinning it in a circle, instructing him to turn around with the patience of a kindergarten teacher. Castiel chuckles, wondering if he should feel patronized—but mostly just thinking that Dean is being rather adorable. Which is an unprofessional thought he squashes immediately as he turns around, giving Dean access to his bare back.
He spent the evening cleaning up the downstairs, sweeping the floors and then mopping them. He scrubbed at the sink and moved on to the cabinets before it was close to bedtime. He listened to the music coming through the walls and it brought him a strange kind of comfort, like he wasn't all alone as he felt.
Dean grimaces but sits all the same. Sam pulls up a chair beside him. “Can I get you something to drink?” Dean offers, still feeling sheepish that she’s come all this way.
“Winchester, Dean?” a nurse calls out, and Dean pushes out of his seat, letting the dizzy feeling stop before following her to a back room. Dean hates doctors and can’t remember the last time he saw one. The nurse walks him to a chair to get some blood drawn before leading him to a back room.
“Yeah, but look at all you’ve done for Amy, and all you’ve done for me. Just think you could do a lot more kids out there. We can find a way to make it work if you want to do that.”
“Looking gorgeous as always, slut,” he mumbles, trying to keep his voice even but knowing that he’s far from calm and collected. “Do you like my gift?” Cas had mailed off this particular pair of panties to his sub just last week.
He showers and rubs some cream into his reddened skin, at least what he could reach. It’s times like these he wished his dom was there to put the cream on his back where he can’t reach.
“You better have taken good care of my girl.” Dean wags a finger at his brother, but he can’t stop smiling at the sight of his car.
“Right,” Castiel agrees cautiously. He finishes drying Dean with a last, careful swipe across his forehead, then runs the towel over his hair and massages his scalp. Dean hums in appreciation, head lolling to the side, and Castiel wants very badly to make this man feel good in every possible way.
PS: I am starting to organize my next fic and it will involve, A/B/O, tattoos, a record store, motorcycles, cello's and guitars, and a whole bunch of romantic love, with a dash of angst... so stay tuned if any of that sounds appealing.
Castiel grabs a soft green blanket and throws it over Dean's shoulders before guiding him back out into the living room. Dean watches Castiel fiddling with mugs in his kitchen before putting them on a side table next to the couch and settling himself down.
“Mine,” Castiel rumbles in Dean’s ear, feeling blinded by sheer need—he has to claim his omega, his mate.
“Right there, oh…” Dean hands tighten on Castiel’s neck, nearly painful, but it just makes the pleasure cascade even more intensely. “Nnnnnggggh, f-fuck, I’m gonna—”
That earns a small laugh from the alpha, and he shakes his head. “Remind me to give you all raises. You’re good for an old man’s ego.”
Castiel chuckles darkly, the corners of his eyes feeling wet. “But somehow, it did happen. My parents agreed to sign my brother’s contract away, and then, Amelia legally owned him.”
Content warning: Physical violence, including Dean being in a very compromising position that implies attempted rape could occur. Reminder that this story is not tagged for rape/non-con, but sexual violence is an overwhelming concern in Dean's mind. This situation will not be resolved until next chapter, if you'd like to wait!
“Fine, but you gotta just follow my lead with stuff, understand?” He knows he’s taking a risk bringing Cas, letting him see where Dean came from. Still, maybe it's best if Cas knows now rather than finding out later and ditching him.
He wonders what Dean is doing now, with two hours until his next class and Castiel away at lunch. He’s strangely fidgety, imagining his sub feeling panic or in pain and Castiel not at arm’s length…
“You're a Quarter Horse, not an Arabian, Cash,” Castiel mutters, laughing as the horse bounces around him, nostrils flaring.
To his surprise, a small, wet chuckle leaves Dean’s lips. He must’ve showered and changed, since he’s wearing a loose pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt. To Castiel’s dismay, he’s wearing a fresh spray of blockers.
“Yeah thanks, ange—uh, thanks, Cas.” He took the offered snack and started the engine, giving Sam one last glance before pulling back out onto 84. As they drove, Sam and Castiel talked about lore on a nerdy enough level to nearly put Dean to sleep. He was both impressed and concerned with how much Castiel knew. By the time they pulled into the motel he was relieved to have a reason to end the debate on the use of elder wood or pine when dealing with Norse demigods.
"A 1967 Chevy Impala. She was beautiful, shiny black with hints of chrome. You should have heard the purr she had." Dean smiled thinking of his baby. He missed the smell of her leather and feel of her smooth wheel beneath his hands.
“So gorgeous, feel so good, Dean…so tight and warm around my cock. So perfect, god you’re so perfect,” Castiel chants, as his thrusts get more erratic. “Come whenever you want m–my good boy,” Castiel moans, and Dean feels fingers reaching down under his hips and wrapping around his cock.
Castiel nodded and sat back as the food came. They ate in silence as Castiel chewed over what Dean had told him. Yet again it seemed like John was chasing down his vendetta without a second thought for his boys and what it did to them. He held back his feelings on the subject and really looked at Dean. He looked at the two day stubble on his face, the purple shadows under his green eyes. He looked at the wrinkles in his shirt, likely from sleeping in his clothes.
“You heard me,” Dean grumbles, looking at him with unapologetic frustration. “I could’ve handled that—”
Castiel tilts his head, as if just noticing. It’s true—a good portion of the facility will take their lunch outside, at the picnic tables, when the weather is this nice. This is something Castiel is well aware of. He grins and says, “All the more reason to bend over, isn’t it, Dean?”
It’s such a tender admission that some of Castiel’s anger towards himself melts. “Of course I will.” He holds the book and finds the passage where Dean’s bookmark is—at the action-packed scene at Weathertop—and he begins to read in a low, steady rumble. He loses himself in the passage, relaxing against the pillow as his hand travels to Dean’s hair. The omega still smells incredibly good, but more warm now, familiar. Cas’ cock remains soft, forgotten in his pants, and after a while he realizes he hasn’t thought about sex for a while now. Dean had been right to suggest this, Castiel thinks in amazement. Not only did he diffuse the situation, but he gave Castiel a task to do, a distraction. He thinks so quickly on his feet and is an excellent problem-solver. What a clever omega Castiel has, even if he doesn’t deserve him.
Dean practically purrs under the praise, and Castiel considers—one more time—the image of Dean as a sweet little kitten. Perhaps he’ll have to explore that avenue at a later time…
“Look, there’s…nothing to tell,” Castiel says in a quiet voice. “Dean and I are just rekindling an old friendship. That’s all.”
So when I sent this chapter to my editor Ellen of Oz she replied to me using all caps! I place the blame for this one WaywardJenn so please direct all comments to her... lol seriously I hope you guys like and as always I adore hearing from you all.
“The night isn’t over yet,” he whispers, giving him one more kiss before using his cellphone as a flashlight, rummaging around his kitchen drawers until he locates a box of matches. They begin to gather candles—from the dining room and living room and bedroom—and Dean scatters them around, Castiel coming behind to light them. Pretty soon, Cas’ apartment is a glowing fire hazard, albeit a romantic one. The sound of rain is suddenly pounding on the roof, and in the glow of candlelight, Dean is smirking.
“So, just sex then?” That was what he had been expecting, but something about that feels… wrong all of a sudden.
Dean thinks that over and feels some of the urgency leave him. “I bet he put clauses in the contract that the subs who tried to break their deals, like me, would go to the state facility…didn’t he?”
Castiel dreams fitfully, never quite asleep and never quite awake. Most of his dreams are more like memories:
“Hey,” Dean called with a tiny nod and jogged up the steps, fumbling with his key in the door. He heard Castiel walking up the steps behind him and for the life of him he couldn’t repress the tiny surge of fear that ran through him.
“Hush now, all is forgiven, Dean. You have a clean slate. Now, can you tell me what caused all that?” Castiel asks, and Dean tries hard to figure out where it came from.
As if hearing his mind's request the finger is retreating, there's a tear of a foil packet, and the press of something much larger is right against his rim. Hands grip his hips as his body starts to give to the pressure, welcoming Castiel in.
“No, I think I’ll stay in tonight. Have fun.” He waves to her as she heads off, closing up the office and turning off the lights.
When Dean finally pulls away, his eyes are puffy and he looks embarrassed, but Castiel has a hand on his back and is rubbing his muscles gently. “How did it happen, anyways?”
Dean gathers up the stack of invoices he was going through with Kevin, and slots them into the newly labeled folders. He likes cleaning things up and making them neat…it helps keep his mind off things, like why his alpha is acting so distant.
“Hell yes, I do.” The doorbell rings announcing dinner, and he adds, “I got it!” He jumps up to get the food and is surprised to see two large pizzas, a two liter of orange soda, and chicken tenders with honey mustard sauce. “Dude, how many people did you think were eating with us?” he asks with a laugh.
“We’re not together,” Castiel interrupts, knowing his brother well enough to realize he did not want to hear the end of
“Come and stand up for me,” Castiel commands, and Dean moves as quickly as he can but tries to be smooth. Castiel had him practice getting up and down so many times he thinks he can do it in his sleep. “Lovely, Dean. You’ve gotten much better at that. I saw your numbers are improving as well. I knew you could do it.”
“Winchester’s boy causing all the trouble, huh? Not surprised. His brother’s a little shit, too,” Gordon grumbles, moving up to Dean with a pair of handcuffs.
