“Totally dude! Why do you think I suggested this ridiculous thing in the first place?” His roommate chuckled; smirk evident in his voice.
now!) had a cheek in each hand, spreading them apart to expose his hole. He felt self-conscious and vulnerable; his ass had never been touched or even looked at like this by anyone before. But as Cas started to rim him, it was hard to really care. “God that feels good.” He moaned.
“No! No, no I meant, um… I meant I wanna fuck you.” He rushed to clarify, face heating in both embarrassment and arousal. The thought of being fucked intrigued him, but he wasn’t quite ready for that yet.
"Yes. But after I have some questions." Dean gave a nod and let Castiel slide away, snuggling into the pillow.
Dean waved until he was out of sight and smirked. He had a plan for tomorrow. Cas would be totally surprised.
"I made it. It's nothing big. Costs less than dinner." Dean waved a hand. Inside was a metal dog tag on a necklace chain with a masculine heart design, carved into the metal flawlessly. Cas opened the box and gasped. He could tell Dean made this and that he put a lot of time into it. He carefully lifted it from the box and put it around his neck.
Cas complied and continued eating Dean out. He loved watching Dean squirm and moan. He spanked his ass a few more times as well, loving the lovely shade of red it was turning.
"It's a little past 7am" Cas replied as he kissed the top of Dean's head. " I need to be at work by 8:30 so I have to start getting ready. Can I pick you up at 7 tonight for our date?" He asked.
, and for all we know, I’m probably not even close to his type. Dude probably likes fit, muscular guys who could bench press like, a thousand pounds or something. What would he want a twink like me for?” He challenged, self-deprecation clear in his voice, and his shoulders slumped in sorrow, before he felt a sharp sting on his bicep.
"I want you to be rougher, Master." Dean murmured seductively, "Make it so I can’t even walk, or fuck my throat until I can’t talk." His fingers danced lower, circling Castiel’s cock.
“Well I’m a switch so I like both. Although I tend to top more than I bottom.” Cas admitted with his own shrug. He couldn’t deny that it was a little weird to be talking so openly with Dean about this.
Cas quickly dressed and left his house to go to the station. He was hoping his shift ended quickly because he just wanted to get back and take his cute boyfriend out on a date.
Cas held his grip on Dean's hair as he slipped the head of his cock into Dean's mouth. His lips had to stretch obscenely to accommodate his girth. His little brat looked so sexy on his knees for him.
"I'll need to take a look inside. I'll let you know tomorrow. " Dean turned up a dirt road which seemed to keep climbing.
" Of course, Dean. I want you always to be honest with me about what you like and don't like. Its ok to not like something I do, Love." Cas replied honestly. "Is there anything else about what we just did that you didn't like?"
"Good boy." Cas walked to his nightstand and got out his cuffs. He cuffed both of Dean's hands to his headboard. He then climbed up his bed between Dean's spread legs. He lifted his hands and brought both of them down hard on each of Dean's cheeks. Dean arched, crying out loudly and wiggling under Cas, his ass turning pink. Cas spread Dean's cheeks and immediately started rimming him. He licked across his rim and started tongue fucking him.
"Have you decided what you want Dean?" Cas asked while silently hoping Dean wanted to take charge just this one time.
“Heya Cas.” The young man greeted as Cas stood up and leaned in to kiss his boyfriend, causing a blush to appear on his freckled cheeks. Cas loved putting that blush there.
“If the other kids were anything like Bianca, I can only imagine what came out of their mouths.” Cas joked as they made their way into the house, Cas taking the wine from Dean to put on the kitchen counter as they passed through into the living room. “Dinner will take about an hour to cook, so I figured we could sit and talk for a bit first, if that’s okay.”
“Mmm Cas.” Dean moaned behind him as he ground his hard cock against Cas’ ass. Between the grinding and the rough sound of sleepy arousal coming from the man at his back, Cas felt his own cock hardening up between his legs. They were both still naked, having fallen asleep after sex the night before and when Dean’s cock slipped between Cas’ cheeks, he let out his own moan.
“I’m sorry.” Cas said, not sounding the least bit like he actually was. “I didn’t mean to make you jump.”
"Toy, a fucking cucumber, I don’t care." Dean chuckled, "a Toy might be bigger than you anyway.: He laughed.
“He actually did it?!” She squealed excitedly, reminding Dean how Cas had gotten his number in the first place.
Dean flushed a little and smiled, "Well I'm going to get the pasta." He shut the menu. Once the waitress came back, they all placed their order.
Most of the day went the same; small unexplainable things would happen, Gabe would accuse Cas, and Cas would vehemently deny it. By the time night rolled around, they were both frustrated and decided to watch a stand-up comedy on Netflix. Cas clicked play and they both sank back into the cushions to watch. That’s when it started; the living room lights began to flicker on and off making both brothers jump and scream.
That’s what had led him to finally clicking on that damn video. He wanted to see if any of it would turn him on. And oh boy did it! It hadn’t stopped at one either like he had told Cas. No. He had ended up watching at least five different videos that night and jerking off to the point that his dick became sore. What a revelation that night had been. He couldn’t remember ever coming that hard from any of the straight porn he had watched over the years. It had freaked him out a little too, realizing he wasn’t straight, but once he had a few days to think on it, he realized it wasn’t exactly a new development. He was just finally old enough that he didn’t feel like lying to himself anymore. He was almost thirty for crying out loud. If he wanted to have sex with a guy, so what? And the truth was, he really did. He wanted to have sex with a guy; and not just any guy, he wanted to have sex with Cas.
"Fuck" Cas whispered. He was only kind of joking. He had always fantasized about fisting a sub but no-one ever let him. He drew back his hand and let the crop hit Dean directly on his hole.
He listened to the sarcasm being flung back and forth between the two and before long they were both laughing together. Gabe had the waitress bring over coffee for them and they drank while they talked. Somehow the conversation turned to the most ridiculous gay one-liners they had ever heard.
Dean leaned forward against the divider between the back and front of the car. “Officer Novak, you shouldn’t be so rough.”
“Can you…uh, can you repeat that one more time?” Cas asked, still not fully believing he had heard him right. Dean rolled his eyes.
"I’m all yours love. Do what you want love." Cas said as he thrust back onto Dean’s finger.  "Whatever it is that you want Dean. Go for it."
“I’m probably gonna be so bad at this.” He warned before he licked a tentative stripe up the underside of the hard length.
“I-I…want…. I want mouths.” He could barely get words out as Cas kept grinding against his hard dick.
Dean laughed, "I think you'll like it. I don’t know anybody who doesn’t." He relaxed back in the bed happily. This was starting to feel like home.
He parked in the lot and shut off the ignition, before exiting his car to make his way into the convenience store. Since his daughter’s school was just up the block, this place was pretty convenient. He walked up to the coffee counter and fixed himself a large cup just how he liked it; Heavy on the sugar and light on the cream. He took a sip to make sure it was perfect as he perused the pastry aisle, debating what to get. Did he want a doughnut? Or maybe he wanted a danish. He couldn’t decide, so he just grabbed one of each, making sure to also grab one of the pink frosted ones for Bianca. He figured it would either work as a celebratory treat if she had a good day, or a consolation to cheer her up if it had been a bad one.
“I agree. At least most of the time.” Cas joked. They stared at each other, caught in each other’s eyes before they were interrupted by his daughter.
Cas kept sucking Dean's cock. But he stopped for a second "Dean you better tell me when you are close." He said sternly.
Dean flipped him off and Bobby chuckled as they pulled into the restaurant’s parking lot. “Shut up bitch.” Dean grumbled. “ Cas is nervous about meeting you. I just want to look nice for him alright.” He blushed as he got out of the car and made his way into the restaurant. The waitress sat them down in a booth. He told her that Cas would be meeting them and she assured him that she would bring him over once he arrived. He sat on one side as Sam and Bobby sat on the other side.
“Good. Mine is in the bedroom. I can't wait to feel you around my bare cock." Cas said as he finished his last bite of dinner.
“Absolutely not, Gabe!” He hissed after seeing the person in question; An extremely muscular man that looked like he lived at the gym. He was literally the opposite of what Cas was looking for. He didn’t have the slim body that Cas fantasized about every night, nor the freckles that haunted his waking hours. Essentially, he wasn’t
“What?” Cas asked curiously. Dean didn’t answer with words though; he gripped the front of Cas’ shirt and pulled him into a gentle kiss that had the older man’s nerves lighting up. He reached his hand up to Dean’s face and tilted his head to deepen the kiss. His tongue slipped out to probe at the younger man’s lips and Dean opened up for him; their tongues twirling together in a delicious dance.
"Yes, please Daddy! I love your cock up my ass!" Dean felt himself stretch open, feeling like his hole will never close after this.
that you found it so easily.” He sneered as he stood up from the floor and swiped his belongings out of Cas hand. “Better try harder next time.” He muttered as he stomped his way to the bathroom, slamming the door shut behind him.
"Ok You are right I should tell you how I am feeling. Dean, I told you I've never dated. And honestly, I’m still somewhat shocked that we are currently in a relationship because I never thought the young man, I was trying to arrest over a month ago would end up my boyfriend. And um...well... I've
“Fuck, Dean…” Cas growled into his ear, sending a shiver of lust down his spine. “I’ve been thinking about you all day.”
“Yeah…. yeah it does.” He agreed. They stroked each other, strokes getting faster the closer they came to orgasm, and before he knew it, he felt Dean come all over his fist moaning Cas’ name as he did. Cas followed quickly after.
"Because I talk too formal sometimes. Because I can’t always read people. And I usually suck at social interactions." Cas replied, a few tears leaking through.
“F-fuck. Please. Please fuck me.” He begged. He didn’t have to wait long. He immediately felt his hole begin to stretch.
“Hey, dude, its all good. That was probably the funniest thing that’s ever happened to me, so thanks for that bud.”
Dean had seen her safely inside her own house before he walked the two blocks over to his own home. They had grown up on this street together, since elementary school actually, and had been best friends the whole time. Charlie basically took him hostage the first day of kindergarten, declaring them best friends, and Dean just went along with it. When they realized they lived so close, they had both been ecstatic little kids and sleepovers became a regular thing. It wasn’t till they became teenagers that those had dwindled down.
Cas slapped Dean's ass hard and heard him gasp. "Don't get smart with me boy. Or I will add more slaps. And he spanked him hard once more. "Are you going to behave now boy?"
"I figured you would like this much better than some fancy restaurant" Cas smiled as he lead Dean towards the Roadhouse.
“I was thinking, since you are gay and all, maybe we can like, ya know, experiment together?” Dean replied hesitantly. When Cas just sat there staring at Dean in silence, he began to feel insecure. “You know what? Never mind, that was stupid. Forget I even said anything.” He rushed out embarrassed and began to stand up so he could rush to his room. Before he could take a step though, Cas’ hand reached out to grab his wrist.
“No Way! I definitely wouldn’t have pegged you for a fan Cas. You do not seem like the type of guy to like nerdy things.” Dean spoke, mirroring Cas own thoughts.
“Our son has the right to date anyone he chooses. Didn’t you just tell him that?” His father looked properly chastised before he sighed.
Shaking his head in confusion, he stood back up and turned back towards the bathroom sink, freezing as he did so. There, on the mirror above the sink, was a crudely drawn penis, complete with ejaculate spraying out of the tip. “What the fuck?” He pondered aloud. How the hell did that get there? How was any of this happening? He was so ready for this day to be over.
Cas climbed into the driver seat of his car. He looked over at Dean and saw how free he looked. It made him happy. He hoped he could make Dean happy for a long time. He drove off from the Diner and towards his house. He was thinking of the exact scene he had planned for Dean once they got there. He only hoped Dean liked it.
"Now Dean, it really isn't very polite to call me names. Especially when I’m cooking for you." Cas said with a smirk.
“I, uh...it’s just, I didn’t… I didn’t know…” He stuttered, not knowing how to explain himself. “I was scared…” He confessed, voice barely above a whisper.
“Fuck, Cas…” Dean breathed out in what sounded like awe and Cas opened his eyes to look at his best friend. Dean seemed to be leaning closer, and Cas turned his head just in time as Dean ended up kissing the side of his face. “Fuck! Sorry Cas I forgot the no kissing thing.” Dean apologized and Cas felt his heart clench. He desperately wanted to feel Dean’s lips on his, but he knew he made the right decision.
“No need to be nervous, Sugar. Let’s get you settled in and go over a few things before the class comes in." She walked him over to her desk where she gave him his own drawer for anything, he might need it for. She went over the daily schedule and gave him a brief review of what they would be doing this first week. As she was finishing, they could hear students making their way down the hallway towards their classrooms. Dean followed her to the front of the class as kids began trickling in.
“Vibrators? Do you mean those fake phallus shaped objects that are battery operated?” He blushed just thinking about it.
Dean whimpered, his hole fluttering, still slightly open from taking Castiel’s large girth earlier. "Yes sir, such a slut for you. Need you."
“Can we please go somewhere quiet?” Dean hissed, not wanting to have this conversation in a crowded room full of people.
" Why am I asking that you sold your body? Or if you've ever been with a Dom?" Cas asked to clarify.
She had also referred to her classmate Jimmy as an assbutt- which Dean absolutely agreed with but couldn’t tell her that. Dean had had to tell her Dad about it, since profanity was not allowed in school, even if little Jimmy
“Thank you so much Sam. You’ve truly been helpful.” He was proud of himself that he even managed to keep the sarcasm out of his voice.
"Sure. No promises for responsibility if I crash." Dean slid in the driver's seat and turned on the quiet engine, wrinkling his nose.
“Yes! The Pony Movie!” She beamed and Cas chuckled fondly as they buckled up and made the short drive to the restaurant.
“That…that was amazing Dean. You sure that was your first-time sucking cock?” Cas teased, making Dean chuckle with him.
“I’m dead serious. I was…maybe 19 when it happened? Yeah, I think about that age.” He recalled, a small smile on his face at the memory. “I was on a date with a guy I had met in one of my classes and he drove us out to an empty parking lot, obviously planning on getting lucky. I was a virgin myself at the time, and like you, I didn’t tell the other guy. I didn’t even make it to the touching part before I embarrassed myself. Needless to say, that date ended quick and the guy never called me back.” He shrugged as he finished his story. He looked up at Dean and saw a small smile on the other man’s face. “I completely understand why you ran off the other night Dean. But honestly, you don’t need to be embarrassed. I’m pretty sure a ton of guys have had the same thing happen.”
"Yeah you are. You're my dirty little slut. You love having your ass stuffed full, don't you? I bet my huge cock isn't even enough for your greedy ass is it?" Cas grunted as he slapped Dean's ass between his hard thrusts.
Dean grumbled as Cas shifted, blinking sleepily and clutching tighter. "What's time is it?" Dean mumbled into Castiel’s skin; he had work mid-morning.
“LARPing? I’m sorry, I have no idea what that is.” He apologized, having never heard of that term before.
Dean was done almost as soon as he started, swallowing his last bite and sitting back with a sigh. "You make a mean burger." His smirk returned, "But I bet your come will taste even better.”
“I see.” Officer Novak lead Dean by the cuffs into the back of his patrol car. He was definitely not gentle when he threw him in the back. Oh well. After everything Dean put him through, he definitely deserved it. He moved around to the front of the car and got in. He looked in his rear-view mirror and saw the confused look on Deans face. Apparently, he didn’t expect Novak to actually put him in a patrol car. Novak chuckled inside because he knew Dean definitely wouldn’t expect what he had planned next.
“The way who looks at Dean?” Came the gravely voice of the man in question. Dean spun around to face Cas.
Dean shivered, biting his plump bottom lip and goosebumps rising on his legs, cock twitching. "Please..." he whimpered
“Heya Cas.” He held back a giggle. “So, uh…I got the good vibes you sent.” He bit his lip to contain a laugh.
and otherwise. He’d daydreamed about this for so long, it almost didn’t feel real that it was about to be a reality. But he was also incredibly nervous. They had already had their fair share of awkward moments, so it was a real possibility that the date would end up being incredibly awkward too, which would royally
They both lay there together, sated from their lovemaking as their breathing slowed down and they fell asleep wrapped in each other’s embrace.
“Lay down on your stomach.” Cas instructed him softly and Dean gulped before complying; laying face down in the middle of the bed, before Cas had him lift his hips to put a pillow underneath him. The older man covered his body with his own, kissing his cheek before kissing his way down Dean’s back until he reached the swell of his ass. He grabbed both cheeks in his hands and pulled them apart, exposing the virgin hole between them. Dean clenched his eyes tight against the raw vulnerability he was feeling at being so exposed to the older man’s view.
“I dare you to watch a gay porn with me.” He wanted to take the words back as soon as they left his lips. But when he chanced a glance at Dean’s face, he held firm.
“’Course not dude. You’re my brother. I love you. I couldn’t care less who you’re attracted to.” Sam shrugged, a softer smile on his face now. Dean felt his eyes begin to well up, and tried to hold them back.
“Fuck Cas! Yes!” Dean screamed as Cas hit his prostate, relentlessly pounding the small bundle of nerves.
“Of course. Would you like to come over right now? Bianca is at a friend’s house, so we’d have the place to ourselves to talk.”
He wrapped his hand around what he couldn’t fit in his mouth and stroked as he bobbed his head up and down the hard cock.
“Duh Cas….I know that. It's why I didn't repeat the touching part or the giving head part. Loser has to wash dishes for a month or something,
This time, there was no stammering or blushing. Dean and Cas just looked at each other with a smile before Cas turned back to his daughter.
Dean smiled, "I can get on board with that." He slid from the bed, stretching his slender body and sighing happily. "Lead the way, sir."
for a 13-year-old girl, and a 13-year-old boy to sleep in the same room together anymore. Pft, its not like they were going to do anything; They were both
“I…uh…I d-didn’t want you t-to see me like this.” He stuttered wetly, tears still stubbornly leaking down his cheeks no matter how much he tried to will them to stop. He was mortified at being caught, and terrified that Cas would leave him, now that he knew Dean’s biggest secret.
The hostess showed Dean to the table and he slid across from Castiel. He had a big smile on his face. "Interesting choice of restaurant when I'm too young to drink. Unless we are being naughty." Dean wiggled in his seat and gave Cas a huge smile.
“Boy, don't you be lying to me. I can sniff out a lie a mile away. Don't think I couldn't see what went on between you and that Castiel fella.” She chastised the younger man, clearly not believing his lie for a second.
“Oh, don’t give me that crap Dean. I saw the way you looked at him. And you were so distracted you almost drowned.” She said pointedly. “Plus, he’s exactly your type.” She added.
“Cas, look. I can’t promise right now that this will last, obviously. But I know that you being a parent is not something that is gonna play into that at all. I like you, a lot. And I’d like to see where this goes, if you do too.” And he did. He really liked Cas and would love to go on more dates with him. He knew going into this that Bianca was part of the deal. Hell, he already knew the little girl well and he liked her too.
“Come on Sweetheart, knock me down. I could use a dunk in the water. Its so hot out here!” The young man called out. Bianca smiled and threw her first ball, completely missing the target. She pouted.
“Bianca, how many times have I told you not to run down the steps?” He scolded his daughter as she turned the corner into the room.
“Why would you be waiting on me to arrest your young man?” Novak asked, trying to retain some semblance of authority,
“Hm…You never know.” She argued. “Just keep it in your pants till December 25th.” She smirked, making Dean chuckle.
He climbed out of the passenger seat and shut the car door behind him, before making his way up his front steps. He turned to look at Cas and gave a small wave as the other man drove off. He pulled his keys out of his pant’s pocket and unlocked his front door, making sure he was quiet as he let himself in and locked up behind him.
Cas felt his cock start filling out. "Fuck baby, I don't know what you are doing to me, but I haven't gotten this hard again this fast in years." Cas said as he grinded his cock against Dean's ass.
to come out- he would tell them. Yeah, that was a good idea. Its not like it mattered much now since he wasn’t dating.
" I’ll let you cook anytime you want love." Cas said as he kissed Dean back. "Did you eat though? Are you hungry? Or do you just want to come lay down with me?" he asked.
"I know, and it’s probably strange to some people who might not know us as well...but that's not their business." Dean ruffled his hair, "now will you please come eat breakfast.”
“Yeah, alright? Yeah you’re a DILF Cas.” He grudgingly admitted, face about the shade of a tomato at this point. And the conversation had been going
“I’m assuming it was to prank either you or I because he told me you had been asking for this gun. I’m pretty sure he thinks I’m still clueless when it comes to this type of thing.” Cas chuckled.
“I only kiss in a relationship. Kissing is very intimate for me.” He explained, which was mostly true. He had definitely kissed on first dates and on some one-night stands. But kissing Dean would be too intimate. It would be bad enough having sex with him and trying to protect his heart. There was no way he could kiss his friend and not let his feelings show. That was one thing he planned to stand completely firm on.
His daughter pouted for a second before looking at the other man. “What do you wanna listen to?” She asked him.
Dean panted, tears painting his cheeks and stinging his eyes, his cock so hard it hurt. He lay there, limp, waiting for permission to get up or move or please touch himself. He whimpered, tilting his head to see Castiel’s face.
”. They all seemed to gravitate to him, even more so than Miss Moseley, which she teased him about constantly. She didn’t seem to mind either,
Gabe did not believe Cas that there had to be a ghost in his house, but Cas managed to convince him to come over and stay for the weekend so that he could prove it to him. So, Friday night rolled around and Gabe showed up as planned.
One-time Dean had been drinking a bottle of water as they left the classroom and Bianca told him to make sure he didn’t drink it in the car because you should never drink and drive. Cas had been there for that one and Dean had watched him try to explain that that was only for grown up drinks. Bianca’s response to that had been “Oh! Like what you drink at night when I give you a headache!” Cas had turned bright red and Dean had laughed so hard at Cas stammering and quickly guiding Bianca out of the school.
“Ok cool. Thanks. That um, that means a lot.” He felt his eyes being to mist over but he quickly wiped the tears away before clearing his throat. “So um, the next part of this is a little TMI.” He warned.
“So last night was, um… fun.” He blurted out the first thing he could think of as he rubbed the back of his neck nervously.
“Well, he uh, we actually met last summer at the college fair. “He hoped giving her as little information as possible would be good before he could slowly work his way up to giving her more. Of course, she wouldn’t be thwarted in her quest for all of the details though.
“Ok good. Give me a few days to work on him and just make sure you answer when he calls.” She made him promise before she let him leave. He was still confused when he made it back home, but he felt a little less hopeless than he had earlier.
“Thanks Cas. I’m glad my boy has you now.” She squeezed his shoulder before turning back to the graduation ceremony.
“Could we pretend I never said that last part out loud?” Dean pleaded, wishing he could erase the last two minutes of his life.
"No, hold it until I'm ready." Dean was breathing hard now, hips rolling into Castiel with soft noises. He didn’t want Cas to actually know it was taking him so long because he wasn’t into this. Cas, unfortunately, wasn't used to having to wait to cum and he came when Dean hit his prostate on the next thrust.
The two of them were sitting in bed together and Dean had just opened his present from Cas, a beautifully hand carved wooden impala replica, that was even stained dark to match Baby.
“Tough shit Dean. I’m sick of seeing you like this, when I know its your own doing. So, either you spill, or I’ll start saying why I think you ran out of Cas’ house last week.” Dean remined silent, voice decidedly not wanting to work at the moment, so Charlie sighed and continued. “I think you got scared. Cas told me you guys were making out and things got heated and that’s when you ran. I think your own insecurities of being inexperienced came into play and had you freaking out. Am I getting warm?” She nudged his side hard, making him roll over.
Two hours later they were both way past tipsy and bordering on sloshed. Dean had the bright idea to play truth or dare. Cas put up a token protest, claiming they were not teens anymore and were way too old to be playing, but it didn’t take much arm twisting from Dean before he relented. He had to admit, he was having a good time too. There wasn’t a whole lot they didn’t know about each other, so they mostly picked dares, which lead to each of them drinking disgusting concoctions of the other ones making, prank phone calls, and one very funny rendition from Dean of Baby Shark, which had Cas wheezing with laughter. When he finally calmed down enough, he asked “Truth or Dare Dean?”
Cas wrapped his arms around Dean's waist and kissed his cheek. "So, what questions do you have my love?"
“Good. And thank you for telling me what happened. I’m sorry you felt embarrassed, but if you are willing, I’d like to continue seeing you Dean.” He told the other man, a hopeful smile on his own face.
"Your punishment is over baby. Are you ready to be fucked now? I would love nothing more than to sink my cock in your beautiful hole" Cas said as he spread Dean's cheeks to gaze at said hole.
Cas chuckled. He pulled himself out from under Dean and went into the bathroom. He washed himself off quickly and brushed his teeth. Then went into the kitchen and began cooking Dean breakfast. Hopefully food would make Dean more amenable to what he was going to suggest. Fuck. He needed more. Cas set up candles on the table too and set up his music to romantic stuff. He put on Ed Sheeran "Perfect" as he waited for Dean to come out.
“I don’t know Red. I mean, my mom will probably be fine with it. And Sammy too. But my dad? He’s who I’m worried about.” He said as he rubbed his hand down his face.
“Hm.” Sam hummed in thought before Cas saw his eyes light up with an idea. “Oh, I know the perfect gift.” He exclaimed before pulling out his phone and scrolling to find it. He turned his screen towards Cas to show him the picture he pulled up. “Dean had mentioned he wanted this gun really bad Cas. This would be perfect!”
“No one ever gets that line right.” He complained out loud to no one particular. One of his biggest pet peeves were misquoted lines, especially from his favorite movies. He didn’t understand how so many people always misquoted an iconic line like that. It truly baffled him.
Cas answered the door and Dean took a moment to drink in the sight of his boyfriend. The older man was dressed in a pair of tight jeans that had his meaty thighs on full display. Dean wanted to feel them wrapped around his head as he went down on him.
“Well then pick someone else Cassie! I’ve tried to help, but you haven’t liked a single one I chose!” Gabriel complained loudly.
They had been best friends for over a decade at this point and normally they had no secrets between them. Dean knew everything there was to know about Cas, and up until recently, Cas thought he could say the same about his knowledge of Dean. But now, he was sure the other man was keeping something from him. Well, Cas did have one teeny tiny secret of his own. Namely, the fact that he was in love with his best friend. But seeing as Dean obviously didn’t feel the same way, Cas didn’t feel too guilty about not sharing that little tid bit of information. Things would just be awkward between them if he told Dean about his feelings, so really, he was doing them both a favor by keeping this one secret.
"You could have just done this at my place you know" Cas grumbled as he took the box of chocolates. He did think it was sweet for Dean to go out of his way. But he didn’t need to make such a fuss.
“Hm, well your Papa is a lot older than Dean. And I’m not that much older than your Papa.” John remarked, looking at Bianca, while clearly directing that statement as a jibe at Cas. This was not going well. It was clear Dean hadn’t been exaggerating his Father’s disapproval at how old Cas was.
"Fuck you, you little manipulative brat. Stop. Ugh. I’m almost done with my shift. Meet me at my house in a half hour.” Cas ordered in his best Dom voice.
"Green, sir." Dean took a deep breath, eager nerves fluttering in his belly. He tugged one lightly just to see the give and a shiver ran down his spine when it didn’t give.
Cas walked up to the edge of the left side of the bed. He had rope and cuffs hidden on both sides. He cuffed Dean's left hand in his leather cuffs. Then went around his right side and cuffed Dean's right arm. Then he slipped a blind fold around Dean's head. "Give me your color love."
“Wh-what do you mean?” Cas stammered, his own face blushing once more. Dean couldn’t mean what Cas thought he did, right? Dean was quiet for a minute before lifting his face, a determined look on his face.
“Come on, Cas! It'll be fun!” Dean exclaimed as he slapped Cas on the shoulder. He must be drunk; He had to be, to be suggesting what he just did, Cas surmised as he stared at his roommate with a slack jaw. He might not have seen Dean drink any alcohol, but there was no way he would have asked that sober. Right?
“Yeah, that’s what Charlie said. I-I’m just not, uh… ready yet.” He confided in his brother, feeling lighter than he had felt only minutes before. A third person knew his secret and the world didn’t end. Maybe he’d eventually feel brave enough to tell his parent’s, but for now, it felt good that his brother knew and still looked up to him. He’d worry about the rest of the world later.
That definitely made Cas feel better. "You're the only guy I've ever been in love with too." Cas definitely felt so lucky to have Dean in his life.
much. He had walked into the garage to meet Dean so they could go on a hunt, but he had arrived before Dean was ready. The hunter had been washing Baby, getting her ready for the drive and Cas stopped dead in his tracks at the sight of him. Shorts. Dean was wearing shorts, and not just any kind,
He had no real intention of meeting someone tonight, he just went along to appease his friend. He figured he could have a couple of beers, try to talk to a few cute guys, and maybe play some pool, before begging off to go home, claiming he was tired.
Cas rushed in his room throwing on his uniform and rushing back to the kitchen. He grabbed Dean and kissed him. "Lock up after yourself love. I'll see you tonight." He said as he rushed out the front door.
“Fuck, Charlie…. I don’t know what to do…yeah, I know…. yes, I was stupid…. yes, I know…. but what if he never wants to speak to me again…. but what- yes, I know we’ve been friends for a long time, but…fuck. But what if I tell him and he hates me? I don’t know…. What am I gonna do? Just say “oh hey Dean, oh by the way I’m in love with you?” …”
Dean smiled politely at Becky as soon as she took notice to his presence, “Hey Becky, uh, no-no one really, I was gonna send one to my aunt Ellen and maybe Sam just to fuck with him,” Dean shrugged nonchalantly.
“Yeah, me too…” Dean stood up again, “You wanna take a look at your garden? I uh, it’s not dead! I made sure it wouldn’t go to waste.”
Dean stared at Cas, mouth slightly open. Cas wanted Dean to be his best man. What the fuck? Out of all the things Dean thought Cas would ask, he never thought Cas would ask Dean to be his best man.
Dean knew Cas wanted a confirmation in a way Cas always wanted. After all, Dean’s constant avoidance and self hate were the reasons they were in this mess. That and Dean’s father's words that hammered their way into his mind.
Dean could feel his cheeks heating up, no doubt there was a blush sitting on his cheeks and to top it off, his hands were shaking. Dean broke out into a broad smile and turned to look at Castiel. This time, Dean’s breath was taken away when his green eyes met blue.
Sorry, this took so long to update, I had trouble with the first half and when I thought I was done, I forgot I was going to include Mary in this chapter, anyway, I hope you all enjoyed it Xx.
“I hoped we could still be friends if I did this for you.” Dean lied. He must have been convincing because Castiel seemed to believe his words.
“Cas is here, he uh, he asked if he could stop by yesterday and I said yes, of course I did. I haven’t seen Cas one on one since he broke up with me. But I thought he wanted to hang out, maybe talk about us, but he-”
Dean smiled and stepped up next to Castiel, “Yeah, I noticed it last week. I wanted to be sure they were there to stay before I said anything.”
“Dean? Take a deep breath, you’re kinda talking too fast.” Sam sat up straighter in his seat. He was at least able to hear that Cas went to Dean’s place. Which explained why Dean was babbling about Cas but why was Dean in such a panic? Did Cas take Balthazar with him to Dean’s?
Cas looked back at the house and sighed softly. “We should head back.” He looked back at the beehive and smiled slightly, “can I come by more often to work on the garden? We can also talk about the wedding plans, two birds with one stone.”
Cas nodded, “Yeah, I would have. I knew this garden would be beautiful some day. I was right.” He walked around some of the plants, analyzing them and lightly touching them. He missed tending to them.
Dean turned to face the front and stared at his desk. He swallowed thickly, he would not cry over this, dammit. Winchesters did not cry, at least according to his father. Dean cleared his throat and shuffled the cards in front of him. Dean opened them one by one, as Becky had mentioned, one from Lisa, Bella, Tessa, Cassie, Lydia, Amara, Anna, and surprisingly Pamela, Anael, Lee, and Michael? Dean picked up the last card and turned it over in his hands. He tore the envelope open and nearly swallowed his tongue when he saw who it was from.
“Hello, all! I come bearing gifts!” Beck sang as she skipped to the front. How she was always so full of energy, Dean would never know.
Dean’s breath caught in his throat at the sight. It was almost as if they were still together somehow. Cas stood in his garden, that beautiful smile in place, Dean stood in front of him, his breath shortened from said smile and they were looking at one another as if they were all that mattered to one another. It was almost perfect.
“Uh, I think he was thinkin’ of asking Eileen, not sure though. Sorry, Beck’s.” Dean took the cap of the pen off and stared down at the two small cards in front of him. They weren’t anything too fancy, just a piece of index card cut into fours.
Hey everyone! Sorry for disappearing for so long, I haven't been feeling very motivated for this fic, but now that there's all this shit going on, I've decided to try once again. Remember that even though times are hard right now, we'll be okay. Stay home, wash your hands, moisturize, and most importantly, stay safe. Xx.
“Sammy,” He mumbled. He was really hoping she had meant Cas. Dean discreetly wrote Castiel’s notecard, hoping Becky didn’t take notice of the name.
This had to be a joke, right? There was no way Castiel had sent him a rose, right? Except therein Dean’s hand was a card with Castiel’s neat handwriting on it.
“I…” Dean sighed softly and looked into Castiel's eyes. Cas was getting married. Cas was happy with someone else. Dean would ruin everything.
Dean watched Cas walk around the garden. His heart was beating somewhat erratically at the sight. It was almost like old times. The sun shone bright making Cas look beautiful, the sky matching his eyes, the smile on Cas’ face… Dean never realized just how much he needed Cas before. He needed to tell Cas for his own sake because there was no way he'd be able to watch Balthazar make Cas this happy or watch them grow old together. Dean should be in Balthazar’s place.
“Well, Sam helped with most of it. So he's to thank for all of it.” Dean shrugged. Sam actually wasn't too sure that Dean should keep up with the garden since he thought it was a metaphor for Dean’s hope that Cas would come back to him. Of course Dean called him an idiot and said he wanted to do it to keep himself from drinking. Sam wasn't wrong, but Dean didn't want to admit that to him.
“Dean?” Cas asked nervously. Maybe he shouldn't have asked that. He should have just asked if Dean wanted to be a groomsman or to just attend the wedding! But no, what came out was him asking Dean to be his best man, fuck!
Cas watched the bees flying around the flowers, landing on them, and flying back to the hive. Cas couldn't believe Dean kept all of this up even though he used to express his dislike of putting so much work for some plants. Cas looked back at Dean, a small frown on his lips, “you did this for me.”
Dean grimaced slightly, “Yeah, I might have had a feeling. Um, you said Cassie? As in Cassie-Cassie, or Cassie-Castiel Cassie?” Dean asked trying not to sound too hopeful for the latter.
Dean bit his lip and shrugged, “I knew you'd kill me if I let all your hard work go to waste.” He kicked a rock into the rose bushes.
“I- yeah! I uh, of course.” Dean forced a smile and lightly punched Cas’ shoulder, “course I will, buddy.”
“Really? You will?” Castiel looked at the older man in shock. He lightly rubbed his arm where Dean punched it.
"I told you I would be home in a half hour love" Cas chuckled as he got close to Dean and gave him a chaste kiss before he unlocked the door and lead them both inside his house.
Cas pulled Dean down next to him on the couch. " Yes, I’m ok love. I...Uh...I have a question to ask you but I'm nervous" he responded while looking down at the ground. He was afraid to meet Dean's eye.
, he guessed you could call it, things had been much smoother sailing. Cas had apologized for their little tryst on the couch, saying he shouldn’t have gotten carried away without thinking of using protection. Dean hadn’t even realized you even needed a condom for what little they did. That had been a fun conversation, he cringed at the memory.
Cas heard a knock on his front door. It was 10pm already. He hoped it was Dean. Although, Dean was supposed to be there a half hour ago. He got up off his couch and opened his front door.
“You serious Cas? You really want me to move in with you?” He asked in disbelief, and Cas saw his eyes well up.
Dean scoffed “You don't have to worry about that ma’am. He's way out of my league to start with. And I highly doubt he even swings my way. Dude’s probably straight.”
“And you never once mentioned that to me?” Dean couldn’t believe this. He had been so worried about coming out to his parent’s and it turned out, not only did they already know he liked dudes, but they thought he had been dating one this whole time. “I never even came out to you!”
“Here’s the deal Cas. I’ve had a thing-a uh…a crush- on you for years. So, I was thinking, maybe we could use one of the toys you bought me together?” The other man asked, determined, but with uncertainty clear in his voice. Cas’ heart felt like it stopped. Dean had a crush on him? And wanted to engage in sexual relations?
“Fuck, Dean. You look so beautiful right now. Even with the ridiculous bow.” Cas’ voice was deep and gravely, and his eyes were dark with lust. Dean wiggled his ass, making the bow shake from side to side.
Castiel:  I wasn't sure you would actually message me back. But I'm very glad. I'd love to go out with you, as long as you promise to be a good boy."
“That sounds good. Maybe after we have dinner with your parents on Sunday, I can drop Bee off at Gabriel’s to sleep, and you can come over and spend the night?” his boyfriend suggested.
Cas chuckled. Dean could really be adorable. "Good to know. I am clean as well. So, going forward I'll make sure I come deep inside that belly of yours" he said as he rubbed Dean's flat stomach.
"We can watch a movie in my bed if you'd like. Pick out anything on my shelf. I’m just going to use the facilities" Cas said as he made his way to the bathroom.
"I'd take you anyway." Cas kissed Dean back and then walked off back to his bedroom. He wasn't lying though. He didn't care. He wanted Dean with him all of the time.
“F-fuck Dean. I’m gonna come!” Cas called out as he tried to pull Dean off his cock, but Dean wouldn’t let him. He wanted to taste it. He was never as thankful as he was right now that he and Cas had already had the whole safe sex talk after this first started and they both were clean. He sucked harder on the head as he stroked his own dick and Cas gripped his hair tight. Dean felt the cock in his mouth swell up, and then he tasted the salty come that shot out, into his mouth. The first taste had him spilling over his fist, and he moaned, swallowing every last drop that landed on his tongue. He felt Cas shudder, so he pulled back and reached up with the back of his free hand to wipe the corner of his mouth. His knees were shaky so he turned to collapse on his ass against the couch.
embarrassed myself, lets talk about something else.” Dean suggested. “So, if you were 22 when Bianca was born, that’d make you what, 30 now?” He pondered out loud.
“Oh you guys going to spend some alone time together? Getting your freak on?” Sam teases from the other side of the room. Cas had forgotten he was still there, and his words send a blush to Cas’ face.
Cas went back inside to finish his shift. It was the longest 30 minutes of his life, knowing Dean would be waiting for him. Finally, he finished his shift and went home. He hoped he would find Dean there already. He lucked out because Dean was on his steps playing with a ball, tossing it up and down casually. Cas got out of his car and walked up the steps, happy to see Dean was waiting for him.
“Dean! Dean! Did you see me jump so high!” She beamed excitedly before looking down and noticing their joined hands. He could see the gears in her head turning as she processed that, and Dean knew what she was going to ask before she even said it. “So, are you boyfriends yet?”
“You too Cas. See you on Monday.” Dean smiled back as Cas turned to make his way out of the building.
He waved the bartender down, and ordered a scotch before leaning against the bar and rubbing a hand down his face. The bartender reappeared less than a minute later, drink in hand.
"I would give you a huge one right on your neck but that would interfere with work." Dean said in a sad voice. He really would love to leave his mark on Cas.
Dean growled in annoyance, his cock certainly must be purple from need at this point, and he pushed back against the fingers, circling his hips to try and get him to hit his prostate
“Yeah, okay. Uh…see around Cas.” They smiled shyly at each other before Cas took Bianca's hand and walked her out.
Bianca had been very excited when he told her that Dean was coming over their house for dinner. She seemed to really like him, and that made some of the anxiousness over dating the other man dissipate. He hadn’t been kidding when he told Dean that it was difficult dating as a single parent; Many men had said adios after meeting Bianca, not because of anything she did, just because once the fact that he had a kid was right there in their face, they realized they wanted no part of it. He guessed many of them assumed that he was one of those dads who only had their kid on the weekends or something, rather than full-time like he did. He had a good feeling about this though. Dean and Bianca already knew each other, having spent six hours every weekday together for three and a half months. They also both seemed to like the other. Cas just hoped that would carry over into a more personal level outside of the classroom as well.
On the fourth and fifth hit, the tears Cas loved so much began trickling from Dean's eyes, his cock rock hard and swinging with the hits. Cas continued hitting Dean's hole with his crop till he got to 10. He loved watching Dean cry. He set the crop aside and rubbed Dean's cheeks. "Such a good boy love. Do you still want me to fist you? I'd understand if you are hurting too bad and we can just cuddle right now. It's up to you love."
Cas spent the rest of the afternoon unpacking all of his belongings and finding a spot for them before he finally collapsed on the couch. He’d have to go grocery shopping tomorrow, but for now, takeout would have to do for dinner. He pulled out his phone to google what was nearby, before he decided on Thai and placed the order.  When it arrived twenty minutes later, he paid the delivery guy, making sure to tip him well, and he dug in, absolutely starving from hours of unpacking cardboard boxes. The food tasted delicious and he made a mental note to remember this place for the future. Thai food was his favorite, and he knew he would definitely be ordering from this place again.  Once he finished eating, he put the leftovers in the fridge and sat down to call Gabe, who made him promise to call him once he was settled in.
They each shook his hand, Sam's lighter, but a big grip because of his huge hands, and Bobby's rough-skinned squeeze. "Nice to meet you!" Sam piped up, and Bobby nodded, not saying anything yet,
He figured he should have been over Castiel by now. He hadn’t seen the man in two months, and they had only really been acquaintances anyway; They hadn’t even been true friends. They had only had very brief conversations every afternoon, but Dean missed those conversations terribly. He had apparently been having a pity party too long, because Charlie finally sat him down and told him he needed to get over it and move on. Hence, her brilliant idea of dragging him to this bar. She insisted he needed to try putting himself out there and get himself a boyfriend so he could stop pining over his crush.
Once Cas got them inside the house he looked towards Dean. " Dean, do you trust me right now?" Cas asked.
“I was trying to be discreet Dean. I need to go clean myself out if you are about to stick your dick up my ass.” Dean immediately felt stupid that he hadn’t caught on before.
“Ha! You lose” Dean beamed triumphantly, and Cas realized he in fact had been so lost in thought, causing Dean to win.
“Ugh fine. Yes, I found him attractive. Not a big deal. Not like it matters anyway.” He grumbled as he sank down in his seat. “It’s not like I’m ever gonna see him again. And even if I did, I highly doubt I’m his type.” He muttered self-deprecatingly.
"He’s 4 years younger than me, so 16." Dean tugged on boxers and wandered into the kitchen of Castiel’s unit.
"You're absolutely correct." Dean took his hand, smiling up at him, the lights reflecting in his eyes.
“Fuck, me too.” Cas admitted through gritted teeth, his orgasm was so close and he struggled to hold it back. “Can…can I please touch your cock.” He begged the other man, not wanting them both to end up with a mess inside their jeans.
“Sure, yeah. That’s fine Cas.” They both took seats on opposite ends of the couch and turned to face one another, just as Cas heard loud stomping down the stairs.
"Mm. A little, maybe, but we wouldn't be able to sleep over at my house. Hasn't really crossed my mind." Dean flopped back down with sigh.
“Dean. All sex is the real thing. Blowjobs are still sex.” Cas insisted causing Dean to roll his eyes.
When Cas had dared him to watch a gay porn with him, he wanted to scream for joy. He had been shocked of course, but excited at the prospect of doing anything remotely sexual with him, baby steps and all that. Seeing Cas jerking himself off and coming had been the hottest thing he’d ever seen. He desperately wanted more to.
“Okay, got it. No kissing.” Dean nodded in understanding. “I was thinking, maybe we could um…watch another porn but this time, like jerk each other off?” He said in question and Cas felt his pulse begin to race at the thought.
"Yeah, I'm good for tomorrow, but I want to set up dinner with my family next week." Dean paused, then smirked, "So you're working on actual valentine's day?”
, and if that wasn’t a clear enough sign that Cas didn’t feel the same way as him, well, Dean didn’t know what else could be. It royally sucked but whatever; nothing he could do about it except milk whatever he could from their current arraignment. With that in mind, he made his way to the living room where Cas was sitting on the couch, scrolling through his phone. Dean plopped his ass on the seat next to his friend.
Sam also interjected “You're lucky. Dean doesn’t date anyone." Sam smiled, "I'm glad to see him genuinely happy. He deserves that.
"I'm worried they will think I’m too old for you. I'm 15 years older than you Dean. What if they think I'm just some creep taking advantage of you?" Cas was panicking.
Dean watched Cas sleep for a few minutes, fingers twirling in his hair, sighing softly as he curled into his arms and passed out.
“You’re not so bad yourself Dean.” Cas dropped the towel before kneeling on the bed and shuffling close to Dean.
“Hold up, just…hold up, Give me a sec, alright? You don’t need to hang up Cas. I uh…I just wanted to make sure I heard you right.” He gathered his courage before he continued “Are you, um, asking me on like, a…Date?” The back of his neck felt warm, and he fiddled with the loose string on his pants as he awaited a reply, hoping against hope that he hadn’t misinterpreted the question.
“I don’t think you get to decide who is too old for me, Castiel. I think you are perfectly fine. Do you want me to back to stealing peanut butter and gum?” Dean glared across the table, obviously irritated.
The three of them made polite, though stilted, conversation, before Dean decided he was tired and wanted to head home. Cas wished them both a good night, before making his way back to his brother. As he reached their table, a hand grabbed his bicep, turning him around, where Charlie stood before him, face set in determination.
Cas immediately pulled back before his boy could come and gripped Dean's cock at the base to stop him from coming.
Dean hugged back, smiling a little. "I miss when I'm not here too, Cas. I try to be here as much as I can.”
"Just wanted to suck your cock and you wouldn't even let me do that, so I had to get your attention." Dean snipped back.
They both made their way to the couch and sat on opposite ends, Dean still holding one hand behind his back for some reason Cas wasn’t sure of.
“Alright, well this has been fun and all, but we’re gonna go now. I’ll talk to you guys later.” They said goodbye and he ended the call. He turned to look at Cas who was still laughing beside him, wiping the tears out of his eyes. “Yeah, yeah, laugh it up Chuckles.” He scoffed.
At pick up that day, Cas had even complimented him on his choice of costumes, making Dean blush this time, as he stammered out a thank you. It had been a pretty good day, and if he happened to have some
They both took time to catch their breaths before Cas moved back and helped Dean out of his panties and stockings and throwing them towards the hamper.
“Remember when Bianca asked if we were boyfriends, and we said not yet?” Dean nodded in reply, hope blossoming in his chest at what he thought was coming next. “Well, I’d like to be able to tell her yes now.” Cas divulged; The butterflies in Dean going haywire.
Cas lifted Dean's legs up and put them over his shoulders. The new angle allowed him to hit Dean's prostate dead on. He could tell when he thrust in and Dean screamed. He hit that spot over and over and slowly increased his speed. "Are you going to come on my cock like a good boy?" He asked as he pounded into Dean.
“I..uh…I just wanted to..you…know, apologize for before. I’m sorry for laughing at you dude. That wasn’t cool.” Dean apologized sincerely, a curious blush on his face.
“Hm.” She just hummed in response and kept eating as if she didn’t just make the entire meal awkward. Luckily, she finished soon after and Cas excused himself to go put her to bed, telling Dean he could wait in the Livingroom for him to return. When she had brushed her teeth and changed into her pajamas, he tucked her in and read her a story before kissing her goodnight and heading back out to Dean. He found the other man sitting on the couch, and he sat next to him, sighing as he relaxed into the soft cushions.
“Hello Dean” Cas replied, kissing Dean’s cheek and making him blush and Bianca giggle like she always did when Cas and Dean kissed.
“Oh wow! That’s how old I am. So, when you were my age, Dean was just a baby!” She exclaimed in awe, and Cas wanted to die right on the spot. This conversation just kept getting worse and worse. Thankfully, he was saved from having to reply by Mary calling them all to the table. Cas quickly guided his daughter into the kitchen and they all sat down. A young man was already at the table and looked up as they sat. He looked a bit younger than Dean, with shaggy brown hair.
Dean grumbled, stretching. "Gotta work?" He managed to mumble out sleepily, arms tightening around Castiel.
“Hey sweetie. Is everything okay?” She asked in concern. She could probably see the anxiousness on his face, and feel the stress pouring off of him.
Dean smiled, sliding onto his lap, kissing him and curling his tongue along Castiel’s, sucking his bottom lip. "Wait until you see me crying choking on your cock." He whispered in that bratty little voice.
“I like him Cassie. He seems really good for you.” His brother said sincerely, and the honesty in his voice threw Cas for a moment. It was rare his brother was ever serious about anything, always making a joke out of every situation. To hear his brother, speak so sincerely now made Cas’ heart fill with warmth.
“Papa, come on! I want to go home!” She whined tiredly, likely exhausted once the excitement of the first day began to wear off.
“Why don’t you frisk me and find out.” Dean grinned. “Officer Novak, you’re the hottest man I’ve ever seen. If it takes some spray paint to get your hands on me, I’m down”
Cas grabbed Dean by the hair and pulled him up to his feet as he dragged him to the bed and threw him on the bed. "Get on your knees with your face on the pillow" Cas growled as he walked to his closet to get what he needed.
"Fuck!" Cas yelled. Dean's mouth always felt good. But that's not what he wants right now. He pulls Dean off of his cock and throws him back on the bed facedown. And before Dean even realizes what happened, Cas positions himself between Dean's legs. Dean whimpered happily at the change in position, wiggling and trying to get his boxers off. Cas could tell Dean was very happy with the position change. And once he successfully got his boxers off, he pinned Dean down and laid on top of him as he brought his mouth to Dean's ear.
“Because its just so much fun. Besides, I can’t walk into a police station and just ask you out. Especially since I’m so much younger than you.” Dean stood on tiptoes. “Now, what are you going to do, Officer Novak” he leered.
“No worries honey. I won't tell a soul.” She promised with a smile, before turning a serious gaze his way. “Just a warning though, dear. I'd suggest you wait till you finish your semester here before you go hitting on one of the parents.”
“That’s up to Dean, sweetheart. He is our guest, so I think he should be the one to pick. Don’t you?” He asked her with his best Dad voice, knowing she knew her manners and how they treated guests. He was really banking on Dean wanting to listen to anything other than the incessant Pop music his daughter was so fond of. He could sing most of the uppity music in his sleep at this point.
Dean couldn’t handle Cas being sad though. He grabbed Cas’ hand and kissed his cheek. “I’m not really a top Cas. And definitely not a Dom. I could tell you wanted it though and I wanted to do this for you. And I’m not upset about doing it either. You loved it so I’m glad. But I don’t know if I could do this again. I’m sorry.” Dean responded honestly.
“Dean! Slow Down.” Cas cut in with a fond chuckle. “I’d love to meet your parents.” He assured the younger man. Dean’s shoulders slumped in relief.
"Good boy." Cas said as he made his way down Dean's body to his ass. He spread Dean's cheeks and assaulted his hole with his tongue. Dean groaned into the mattress, his body pushing back into Cas, shuddering. Cas licked his way into Dean's ass. He loved eating out his boy. And he knew Dean loved it too.
Castiel went up to pay the bill and turned around to Dean. "Get in the car you little minx" he said, amused at his little boy's behavior.
Dean opened his eyes and looked into the pools of blue in front of him. Cas was smiling at him and Dean felt a surge of intense feelings flow through his body.
Since he arrived before Charlie, he flagged down the waitress and ordered himself a beer, slowly sipping it as he waited for his best friend to show.
"Good boy. You are getting 10 spanks with my bare hand. You don't have to count them this time. Are you ready?" He asked.
By the time he had three fingers fucking into him, scissoring and stretching his rim, Dean was a blubbering mess. His cock was leaking pre-cum all over his soft belly, and he felt like he could explode at any minute. He felt Cas’ fingers retreat and he whined at the loss, feeling too empty after being full.
Cas scooted next to Dean and hit call as he held the phone up so they both could see. Charlie answered on the first ring.
Dean finally wiped his hands with a napkin and looked him straight in the eye. "You're not taking advantage of me. You gave me the choice and now I'm here. I'm a big boy who works and takes care of myself and my brother. So, don’t think I can’t be with you."
Fuck yes, Cas thought. He raced to his bedroom and stripped out of his clothes. He almost tripped and fell at least twice in his eagerness. Thank God Dean wasn’t watching him. Once he was naked, he laid on his bed face down and waited for Dean.
“Remember to be on your best behavior okay Bee? This is the first time we’ve ever been invited to meet someone’s parents and I want to make a good impression.” He instructed her as he pulled up to the house and turned the ignition off.
“Papa, can we go to Wendy’s for dinner? You said if I had a good week in school we could. Please, please, please!” His daughter begged excitedly. He did promise her after all.
“Well, uh…you see, there is something I should have probably told you about before.” Dean took a deep breath before he confessed. “I’m a virgin.”
Castiel was staring at the entrance of the restaurant, praying that Dean actually showed up. He was nervous. Dean was literally his perfect match. He loved bratty subs. Most Doms he knew hated a sub who was bratty and found any reason to punish a bratty sub.  Not Castiel though.
"I was worried you wouldn't want to move in with me though. I love you. But I know I'm much older than you. So, I uh...kind of worry sometimes" he blushed.
“I L-love y-you too.” Dean choked out through tears of joy. He leaned up to place a kiss on his fiancé’s lips
“You have no idea how rough I can be boy.” Novak replied. Dean had successfully gotten under his carefully constructed façade. He had no idea how Castiel really was underneath his officer persona. Dean had no idea how much Castiel’s dominant side was starting to take hold.
"Good. I love fucking your tight ass with my fat cock. You feel so good Dean." Cas changed the angle of his thrusts, making sure he was now hitting Dean's prostate every time.
They left the car and walked up to the house, Cas carrying a bottle of wine to give his hosts. He knocked on the door and waited anxiously for someone to answer. The door opened, and a woman answered, Dean’s mother Cas assumed.
“Your cock feels so big…” Cas groaned. He wrapped his legs around Deans lower back, digging his heels into the top of Dean’s ass. “Move, please.” He begged. Luckily Dean was quick to comply and began slowly thrusting inside Cas’ tight channel. “Fuck yes, like that…god, Dean!” He babbled, moaning as Dean fucked into him.
He didn’t intend for it to happen, but he ended up becoming really attached to Bianca, and it honestly had nothing to do with who her father was either. The girl was smart as a whip and funny as hell too. There were a number of times where Dean had to turn his head to hide his laugh at some of the things that came out of her mouth.
“I see our guests have arrived.” A man’s voice came from the other side of the room, making Cas turn to look. The man was tall, dark haired, and had a stern look on his face. Cas assumed this must be Dean’s father, John Winchester. The “Speak of the Devil.” Dean whispered assured him he was right. Cas stood up to greet him properly.
"It's ok. Your outlandish behavior is one of the reasons I love you." Cas replied as he kissed the top of Dean's head.
"Ok. And I mean it Dean. If you don’t want to, its fine. It was just a thought and supposed to be a gift of myself to you love." Cas said honestly. "If you'd rather do something else its ok too. Cas secretly hoped Dean wanted to take charge though once. He was curious how that would play out.
Cas smirked. And doubled his efforts. He pushed his tongue inside Dean as far as it would go and slapped his ass hard. Dean moaned as he spilled himself onto the bed, body trembling as he struggled not to fall. Cas got up on his knees behind Dean. He unzipped his pants and took out his cock. He spit in his hand and got it wet before he plunged it deep inside Dean in one thrust. He knew how much Dean loved the stretch.
He walked up the stairs to his bedroom and dressed in his pajamas before he slid under the covers, determined to get a good night sleep so he could start his first day at work off on a good foot.
"Well I was talking about the less innocent item you are holding, but good to know you didn't steal anything you little thief." Cas laughed as he followed Dean into the house.
Cas slowly undressed himself. And then he climbed on top of Dean. He made his way up Dean's body and kissed him. He knew how amazing Dean's kisses were.
Cas kissed Dean back. "Thank you, Dean. I was worried you wouldn't want to come out with me." He confessed shyly.
“Cas, its….ha ha….Cas….oh man…hehe… Good Vibes means to like…wish me luck….good feelings….not…n-not….a v-vib….vibrator.” He managed to choke out between bouts of laughter.
Novak had no idea how to handle this man. Although he was barely a man. Barely of age. Built like a twink. And it seemed he really was set on flustering the officer.
Dean cried out with each thrust, the angle making it feel like Cas was almost filling his belly. "Fuck!"
Dean snuggled into Castiel’s chest, leaning up to plant a long, sensual kiss on his lips. "I've never had anything like that, or like this. I love it. Thank you, Cas."
Dean looked taken aback but also, a little turned on. He was biting his lip and settling back against the seat, shifting as comfortably as possible.
“Hmm, I have an idea.” Cas offered before pulling Dean on top of him, making the younger man straddle his lap. Dean squeaked in surprise and Cas chuckled. “You can set the pace this way.” He offered in explanation before pulling Dean’s mouth down to his own.
“Eh, no biggie. You’ve met Charlie. She lacks a filter most of the time too.” Dean shrugged with a smile. “So, Gabe, you own this place?”
Dean crawled to straddle Cas’ waist, leaving bite marks up his spine. Cas was breathing heavy just enjoying what Dean was doing.
He had already taken a shower before dinner, making sure to clean himself out. He’d even used a freaking enema he had ordered online. That had been incredibly awkward. He quickly got undressed and grabbed the giant bow from the box where he hid it under the bed. He laid himself down on the bed on his stomach, reaching behind him to place the ridiculous bow on top of his ass. His present was that he was planning on finally bottoming for Cas tonight. It’s something he had been wanting, but had been too nervous to bring up again after the first time he’d mentioned it. Cas hadn’t mentioned it either, probably not wanting to pressure Dean. But he remembered Cas saying he preferred to top, so he really wanted to give this to him. What better present than giving up his anal virginity. Fuck, he was nervous though.
“Hello Dean. Please come in.” He stepped aside to allow him to enter, dreading what would probably be an awkward conversation.
“It’s fine.” Cas told him. But it wasn’t, not really. He desperately wanted that kiss and part of him wished he had let it happen. But he knew he had to draw the line there. Because, once he kissed Dean, there was no way he’d ever be able to stop, and that’s not what this was about. This was just helping his friend come to terms with his sexuality, nothing more. He needed to remember that.
“Yeah and I get to be reminded on a daily basis that he's so far out of my league, we aren't even playing the same sport. Plus, like I said last time, dude’s probably straight. It's not like I'd ever stand a chance.”
Cas laughed quietly “That depends. And this is another thing that never gets talked about either and why porn and writing are sometimes incredibly unrealistic. Obviously, the anus is meant for waste. So yes, it could be messy. Which is why anal is typically planned ahead of time, and not something done spur of the moment. I personally always use a douche if I know I’m going to bottom that night, and I wouldn’t eat heavy that day either. Its definitely not all sexy, the planning that goes into it, which is why its not always done, blowjobs and such are more common.” Cas explained clearly to him. He felt so much love for the man in front of him in that moment. Yes, Love. He was able to admit it to himself, he was definitely in love. But it was still too soon to say out loud so he’d keep that little secret for himself. But he felt so much love for Cas, that he would sit here and explain in detail all the awkward and messy parts of sex, just because Dean had questions.
“You really didn’t write that?” He asked, still sounding unsure about whether Cas was telling the truth or not.
"Fuck yes." Cas let out once he felt Dean's fingers at his hole. It had been years since he bottomed. But he wanted it. He wanted it so bad.  Dean slowly pressed one in, stroking his thigh with his other hand.
He was still beating himself up over it when he finally slipped into bed that night. As he lay there though, his thoughts started to turn towards how he remembered Dean at the fair, when he climbed out of the water, and his tight white tank had clung to his tone body. Before he could stop himself, Cas’ hand slipped down his stomach and beneath the waistband of his pj's, before wrapping around his slowly hardening cock. He began stroking himself as he thought of Dean’s body in that wet tee. He came with the young man's name on his lips, and as his breathing returned to normal, all he could think of, was how much more awkward he was going to feel the next time he saw a Dean, after getting off to thoughts of his young fit body. Fuck! He was royally screwed.
‘Fuck!’ was all Dean thought as he realized where he recognized her from, and the color drained from his face. Blue eye’s daughter was in the class he was going to be student teaching in for the next three months. He was bound to run into her father at some point. This semester was definitely going to be interesting.
“Wha-what do you mean by official?” Dean said hesitantly, causing Cas to make a frustrated noise in his throat.
So, yeah. To say Dean was on edge most of the week was an understatement. He stood in front of his bedroom mirror, as he buttoned up his shirt and tried to psyche himself up. The outfit Charlie had helped him pick out looked classy, without looking too dressed up. He had on a dark pair of black-fitted jeans, that hugged his body in all of the right places. It accentuated his “bubble-butt”- as Charlie had referred to it-, and hugged his bowed-legs snugly. He paired it with an emerald button-up, that Charlie had told him complimented his green eyes.  He styled his hair with a bit of gel to complete the look. Cas would be coming any minute and Dean was trying not to freak out and sweat through his clothes.
“He, yeah I figured this was all him. Has his name written all over it.” Dean chuckled awkwardly. “I uh…I was thinking. Since you spent all that money on the vibes though, maybe we could…um…t-test one out?”
“Completely, man, unrecognizably,” he says, shaking his head. “Drugs, beard, girls, the works.” He pauses, unsure if he should take the conversation from objectively hilarious to sort of dark, lest he piss off their most powerful ally, but he’s too tired to resist curiosity. “Have you ever…?”
Sometimes, he interrupts, watches as Cas’ face flickers back to life among the leaves and flowers. Sometimes, he goes to sit beside him, itchy grass be damned, and the sun showers them both in warm, unearned forgiveness.
“You—wait, you and—” Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Sam fall back in his chair and make some aborted movements with his pointer finger. “You
“Hey, kid? We got him, you can slam the thing,” Dean said, not looking away from Cas’ face, not quite trusting it to remain if he did.
“Oh.” Dean’s left eyebrow pops up, drawing the same half of his mouth with it, as if Castiel’s just said something shocking, pleasing, equally both. “Yeah, why not.”
“So, it’s a plan?” Dean says with an uncurling sense of relief. Maybe this wasn’t a big deal after all. “You grab a few beers, I’ll get my laptop set up to natgeo?”
“Yeah,” he says, almost unbidden. He half wants Cas to place his unoccupied hand back at his mouth, just to have something to do with it that’s not producing the breathy shit he’s doing now. “Yeah, Cas, like that.”
As far as things to distract him from the line of potential, heat, human guy curled up next to him go, a soap opera with a cult subplot doesn’t actually do a half-bad job.
thing,” Dean says, pointing as he closes the white cabinet door with a reverberating bang-bang-bangbang—he’s gotta get around to fixing the interior magnets, “ain’t older than you.”
“I’m—processing. Okay,” Sam says, staring down at the carpet. “I feel like I should be both less and more surprised. One more time,” he looks up at Dean with one eye squinted, “you’re serious?”
“You like the bear, yeah, yeah, I got it,” Dean says, scribbling the items down. “Any preference for the eggs, your majesty?”
“I, I,” Cas breathes, in, out, so close to the tilted and begging plane of Dean’s face. He wants to swallow it, drown in the air from his lungs.
Hell, even the company, strange as it would have been a calendar year ago, two—strange even in the company of demons and hellhounds and witches—is a thrill. Castiel, angel of the lord, sitting ramrod straight in a flaking polyester booth on the Missouri side of a city named for the state Dean was born in. He’s not entirely sure how the saying goes, more things on heaven and earth, blah blah blah, but right now it seems more like heaven
The whirling black surface shifted, something like an oily bubble popping. Dean didn’t know whether or not to take that as a good sign; looking to Jack revealed nothing. He sighed.
Cas relents after a second, passing off the baby bird in a move that puts more skin against skin than Dean’s felt in days.
“So, whaddya say?” Dean’s hand tightens on his thigh as his face remains shrouded in that same strange half-tender grin. “I wanna—c’mon, Cas, I’ll make it good. Let me?”
That’s what’s on the schedule for today, or, it’s meant to be, when Cas blinks one eye open against the sun.
Dean, for a second of his pathetic fucking life, wonders just how small the percent chance that pretending to be asleep right now will work out for him, and then discards it. He’s dug the grave, time to lie in it. Or whatever.
Too much of the human experience is left blunted by angelic senses—food to molecules, drink to dilutions—and perhaps Castiel has no metric, but he can’t help but feel a certain kind of vindication. He’d been right; Dean Winchester holds divinity between his teeth.
“I mean, c’mon, take a look.” Dean spreads his hands. “Normal life wasn’t enough, ganking the occasional ghoul wasn’t enough, selling my soul, getting wrenched outta
Dean shakes his head. “Nothing worth having gets got without a little risk,” he says. “So maybe he was sleeping vulnerable for a little while, but who was there to take advantage of it? Besides, he wakes up and, bang, world’s first woman.” He shrugs. “Kind of worth it.”
“I couldn’t see it then,” Cas says, pauses. “Or, at least, I couldn’t read it for what it was—but I know the whole of it now.”
Unseen, Dean nods, gets to his feet. He grabs the dead guy robe that’s been hanging off the back of his chair for a few days too long and turns to head towards the shower. Before he does, “hey, you stayin’ here?”
In his room, Dean’s stomach nervous like it hasn’t been since the ninth grade, Cas stops on the threshold and tilts his head, considering.
It was like this the first time too, that strange fumbling night a week or so after Cas’ return. It wasn’t even—it was hardly anything, a few hot, open kisses and something that could generously be called a blowjob and there Dean’d been, hot rivulets down his face before he’d even noticed. He’d wiped them away, they’d replaced themselves, and he’d just—given in to the strangest first sex he’s had with anyone in his life.
“I suppose,” Cas says, words shifting deep and slow like stones under the earth. He is an ancient being; Dean is drawn up short. “I suppose I could spare a few hours.”
Castiel nods, though Dean’s no longer looking at him. How brief it was, that small, sweet interval when he had been.
Again, again, socking Dean over the head with it: I am an angel, I have seen more than could ever possibly be told in words even if your shitty tape deck spewed them until the end of time, I am practically infinite, I am—sitting across from you.
It does manage to get Dean’s eyes back on him, creased in confusion. “Uh,” he says. “I don’t know if you’ve noticed but I’m—I’m sucking your dick, man, what do you mean? I’m doing what I want.”
“It’s not,” Cas licks his lips, searching; Dean wonders about it sometimes, what it’s like to be so condensed, to use only human language to express what used to be beams of light. He thinks they do pretty well, considering. “I’d thought I was removed, somehow, doomed to love you as an angel would.” Dean smiles, feels it lopsided on his face and aches for the man across from him. “I hadn’t yet realized that humanity’s not quite like that at all.”
They eventually stopped for lunch before slowly making their way through more of the carnival. Eventually they made their way to the dunk tank. Bianca wanted to try so they waited on line for their turn.
"Yes sir." Dean purred, "Shall I just lie here? Put on a show? Or I can make brunch." He ran his hand over castiels chest, teasing.
Fuck. Cas was hard as a rock as Dean cuffed him. He couldn't wait to see what he would actually do. He was so turned on and excited to be on the other end for a change. He absolutely loved being a Dom. But he also liked submitting once in a while.
Dean averted his eyes, jaw clenched, "That's exactly what you meant, Cas. Don’t bullshit me.” He yelled.
“If you want to move past this, yes you should. Otherwise its going to eat away at you and that never ends well.”
“I want you to take your last ball and run up and smack it into the target to dunk my friend Dean. Can you do that?” Charlie asked.
“Thanks Red.” He rolled his eyes at her. “Let me just grab my change of clothes and get dressed and then we can head out to the diner.” They began walking towards the parking lot where he got his clothes and went to get changed really quick. He made his way back to his car, a beautiful ‘67 impala that his father had gifted him when he graduated high school. It was definitely his most prized possession. They drove to the Terrace Diner, which was their usual hang out spot. They went in and were seated quickly. Once the waitress had taken their orders, Charlie cleared her throat and Dean looked up at her.
"Get. Up. Now." Cas bellowed as he pulled his cock out of Dean's mouth. He was not pleased at the moment. The little shit couldn't even listen for two minutes and fucking bit down on his cock.
"Well, the bigger question is, would you want that? I wanted it to be my gift to you but not unless you actually want it. I know you like being submissive, but I figured maybe you would like being in charge once for a change." He whispered shyly.
it? He couldn’t wrap his mind around it. In fact, a few turns later it was still all he could think about. When Dean chose dare, he didn’t even think before he blurted out:
“T-thanks man.” He whispered, before Sam pulled him into a hug. “Just d-don’t tell anyone else, please.” He begged as he hugged his brother back.
"In ten years, you will be 30 and I will be 45. It's still a big age difference. And while I don't mind it at all, I'm still going to worry for a while that you will find someone closer to your age." Cas said solemnly.
“What are you talking about?” He asked blearily. It was way too early to be dealing with his brother’s antics right now.
Dean stared at him, frowning as he tapped his fork on his plate. "You're picking at your favorite pasta and won’t look me in the eye.”
"Then why the hell didn't you say that months ago? Why didn't you ask my out months ago? Why did you have tp torment me for months? You've been a thorn on my side since the first graffiti you did. I wish you would have just told me how you felt." Cas saif exasperated.
“Awesome.” Dean smiled back. They both stared at each other, dopy smiles on their faces before they both started giggling like teenagers.
“Sorry.” Dean whispered, as he buried his head into the older man’s neck. Cas rubbed his clean hand up and down Dean’s back soothingly, knowing the younger man probably needed a few moments to compose himself after his first sexual experience. He didn’t push, content to sit there with Dean in his lap for as long as he needed.
Dean was moaning even minutes in and by the time Cas had his tongue pressed inside him he was clawing at the sheets to stay still, messing up the bed and whimpering. "Master, gonna come." He gasped.
” Cas blurted out before covering his face with his free hand, and Dean just threw his head back in laughter. There was never a dull moment with that girl.
Dean sinfully gyrated his hips as Cas continued the assault on his nipple and he heard the other man call out his name, before he felt the hot dampness seep through the panties from Dean’s come. That’s what pushed Cas over the edge and soon he was coming too, messing up the front of the dainty fabric.
“Of course, sweetie. Hey, why don’t we go in the other room and color while the boys talk for a bit?” Mary stood and held her hand out for Bianca who took it and followed Mary out of the room, skipping along besides her. Now that Bianca wasn’t there as a buffer, Cas’ nerves came back in full force. He felt Dean shift closer on the couch and grab his hand, squeezing it in reassurance before a throat cleared across the room. He looked up into the intimidating gaze of his boyfriend’s father.
“Oh man, it’s awesome! It stands for Live-Action-Role-Playing. Soooooo much fun. We dress up as our characters and act out the story. I’m queen of Moondoor!” She explained, voice clearly excited as she babbled about it. Cas was still unsure what exactly it was but it seemed to be something she enjoyed.
"That is the idea, yes." Dean smirked, bending to bite his thigh. He was glad that Cas was enjoying himself.
"Yes. I have the current paperwork. I'll bring it to show you." Dean nuzzled Castiel’s neck, giving a playful little nip."I do love the hickies though. I like to be marked.”
“O-Okay.” Dean breathed out, sounding intrigued by the idea. “P-put one on your laptop then.” He said as he sunk back into the cushions. Cas quickly grabbed his laptop and fumbled with the keyboard to pull up his favorite site. He scrolled through the thumbnails to find one that looked good. One caught his eye of two guys sitting on a couch together, jerking off next to each other. Perfect. He clicked play and relaxed back into his side of the couch.
" That's not what I meant at all Dean! I was literally just asking a damn question!" Cas yelled. "I told you I suck at this shit." He said as his lip quivered.
“Dean, son…look at me.” The gentle command had him following, and he looked up into his father’s eyes. He was expecting disgust or anger, but he only saw a gentle smile. “You are my son and I love you. Nothing, and I mean
“Y-you didn’t, not really. I, uh…I liked what we were doing. I was totally into it. It was just…the whole… coming in my pants prematurely thing.” The blush had worked its way down Dean’s neck and Cas found it so endearing. “If you, um…if you’d wanna try again, I’d be cool with it.” He stammered
“Never, my love. You look stunning. Why have I not seen you like this before?” Cas questioned as he dragged his finger over the lace trim of the panties.
Dean smiled, blushing a soft pink. "I'm glad." He finally raised his gaze, looking at Castiel. He looked embarrassed but happy.
“You gonna make love to me now Cas?” He shakily joked, trying to lighten the mood after their confession of love. Cas reached out a finger to catch the tear.
“I didn’t ask for your help. I have no desire to ‘hook up’ with someone right now. You dragged me here against my will.” Cas seethed through gritted teeth, annoyed at his pain in the ass brother. “I’m going to get another drink.” He stormed off towards the bar, completely done with the whole thing.
“Y-yes. Yes, I am. If, that’s…um…. something that would, interest you?” Cas affirmed, voice lifting up in question at the end.
“Come in, come in,” She moved to the side to let them enter. “Thank you for coming. Let me grab your coats.” She offered, hanging them up on a hook by the door. “I’m Mary and you must be Cas.
Cas chuckled. "Patience Dean. We are only getting started. I’m going to explore every inch of your body before you get to come." Cas leered.
Dean was gob smacked, and gaped like a fish before he was finally able to croak out a response. “Yeah…definitely, um, interested.”
Cas slowly pulled out till only the tip of his cock was left inside Dean and then thrust his cock back inside him hard and fast. He repeated this move again, hoping the hear lovely noises coming from Dean as he was stretched around his cock.
“Oh good. I’m glad it came already. I hope you like them.” His best friend said sincerely, and Dean couldn’t hold back his laughter any longer. He held the phone away from his mouth as he roared loudly, tears again falling down his face.
“Charlie I gotta go.” He said quickly as he hung up the phone. “How long were you listening outside my door?” He asked with a quivering voice.
Dean unscrewed the top and leaned against the counter near Cas, his jeans sagging a little and revealing the sides of a silky red thong when he stretched.
“What happened Cas? Did I do something wrong.” Dean moved to come closer but Cas backed up and held his hands out.
Cas was pleased with that answer. He raised one eyebrow and gave Dean a stern look "Go to my bedroom. Now boy. And I want you stripped naked by the time I get there. Head down and arms behind your back. Don't keep me waiting"
"There is my good boy. Those two didn't count towards your punishment. I will begin now." And Cas started spanking Dean. Once, twice, three times. Dean was making the most beautiful noises. Every gasp, every whimper was music to his ears. He hit him a fourth time, then a fifth, then a sixth. Dean started choking back a cry. He hit him again three more times. He felt a few tears land on his leg. And he felt Dean's cock hard as ever. Then he landed his spank one more time across the middle of both cheeks and heard Dean let out the most beautiful cry.
“This is not a game!” Officer Novak yelled flustered. “You have multiple serious offenses against you. How do you not realize how serious this is? This is not a joking matter.” Novak stated, his normally calm demeanor slipping. He has no idea why this one man got under his skin so bad.
Dean made a surprised noise at the sharp yank, looking at him with wide green eyes, but all it did was make him chuckle. "I don’t think you can fuck my throat hard enough to satisfy me. Guess we'll see."
Their tongues dance together, tangling and twisting, and Cas continued undressing Dean; First his pants, and then his briefs, leaving Dean completely bare and exposed. He stepped back and took his fill of the younger man, and Dean could see the hunger in his eyes. His cock was hard now, standing tall and proud and Dean tried to cover himself with his hand before Cas shook his head.
“Of course, Bee.” He told her, before looking back up at Dean. “It was nice to see you again Dean. I better get my daughter home before she has my head.” Cas joked lamely. Dean chuckled back awkwardly.
“I would never make fun of you beloved. I must say, the sight of you in these clothes is very…arousing.” At those words, Dean looked down and noticed the bulge in his boyfriend’s pants. A jolt of arousal went straight to his own cock at the sight.
“You like that Dean? You like me fucking you bent over your own car? Where anyone could see?” He taunted the other man as he continued to piston his hips at an assaulting pace.
“Mhmm.” Cas hummed in agreement as they lay there together. Dean heard Cas’ breathing even out and realized the other man had fallen asleep when he heard a small snore. Fuck he wished he could keep this forever. Just the two of them laying together like this was exactly where he wanted to be. His last thought before sleep took him too was that he was definitely irrevocably in love with Castiel Novak.
Somehow, his alarm never went off in the morning, even though he clearly remembered making sure it was set before he fell asleep the night before. When he finally did wake up and roll over to look at the clock, he realized he had less than an hour before he was supposed to be at the school for his first class. He scrambled out of bed and rushed through one of the quickest showers of his life. He was thankful he had had the foresight to set out his clothes for the day last night; that was, until he went to put them on and realized it was a completely different outfit than he remembered setting out. None of the items matched, so he had to dig through his closet quickly to grab a new button-down shirt that actually did match the pants.
Cas slapped Dean's hands away. "Gladly my love." He said. He lubed up three of his fingers and pushed them in Dean's ass. Dean felt loose enough for it. He fucked him with his fingers until he was loose enough to push a 4th finger in. He felt some resistance but he pushed further until all four of his fingers were able to fuck into Dean's ass hard and fast.
Dean chuckled, grinding back against Cas. "Do you think it is sir?" He used the term sir very sarcastically.
Dean shook his head, "I think you're absolutely perfect. Don’t ever change, Cas." He reached to squeeze his hand, smiling at him.
"Lay on the bed on your stomach. Now." Cas ordered as he pulled Dean off his lap and got up to grab supplies from beside his bed.
“I fucking came in my pants alright?” He yelled in frustration. “He touched me once and I shot off like a damn rocket. So yeah, I have a reason to be embarrassed.” He snapped, face blushing as he replayed what happened in his head. He was still so mortified about that night.
“I think we ruined these.” Cas managed through heavy breathing; voice raspy after that spectacular orgasm. Dean chuckled in response
Castiel waited a few minutes after Dean left and went to his bedroom. Mainly to give him time to follow orders. But he also had to compose himself. He slowly made his way to the bedroom and once inside, he gasped at what he saw.
“Will you marry my papa and be my other Daddy?” She asked, her smile wide. He felt a sob catch in his throat before his brain came back online. He quickly climbed out of the tank, slipping back in the water in his rush, before he managed to actually get out. He ran to where  Bianca was standing next to Cas. Cas who was still down on one knee. He reached his hand out for Dean and grabbed Dean’s shaking hand in his.
that’s pathetic, you’re drinking with me.” Cas just rolled his eyes but acquiesced to Dean’s demand.
“Relax, Dean. Everything will be fine.” Cas tried to reassure him. But Dean couldn’t help it, he was nervous as hell.
“Yes!” Cas blurted. Dean looked up to meet Cas’ gaze and looked at him questioningly, unsure what he meant by that yes. Cas must have seen his confusion because he clarified. “Y-yes, I will experiment with you.” He whispered.
“God, fuck Cas y-you’re so, uh…so tight.” He chocked out. They both took a minute to get used to the feeling before Cas began lifting up and sinking back down, making Dean moan at the tightness gripping his dick.
“Yes…. sir.” Dean whispered as he followed the Angel’s command. As soon as he stepped out of the car, Cas was on him like lightening, grabbing him and throwing him face-down over the hood of the car, pinning him down with his body.
“Hm…” Cas pretended to ponder that before shaking his head teasingly “Not a chance. Sooo….am I a DILF Dean?” He asked again, shit-eating grin on his face.
Cas grabbed Dean and pulled him back to lay on his lap. "No, Dean that's not it, love. I’m just so sorry you had to do that. No-one should ever have to do that." Cas said sadly as he continued running his hands through Dean's hair. He could tell it calmed the young man.
“Sure. Yeah.” Cas nodded before moving to sit on his bed, leaving enough room for Dean, who sat down facing him. He grabbed Cas’ hand in his and rubbed his wrist with his thumb.
Dean buried his damp face into Castiel’s chest, damp with sweat and tears, and his chest heaved as he caught his breath, reaching back to feel how open he was, and giving a soft moan when he felt his hole gaping.
He slowly got up and made his way out to the kitchen where a pot of coffee was already sitting there brewed. Thank fuck that Cas usually woke up first. Dean fixed himself a cup before turning to make his way back to the safety of his room. Before he reached it, however, the bathroom door opened and Cas walked out, freezing when his eyes met Dean’s. They both stood there awkwardly, neither having a clue what to say apparently. Finally, Dean couldn’t stand the tension anymore.
One of the perks about renting this place was that it had come fully furnished, which was perfect since he had been unable to take any of the furniture from the apartment. Bart had purchased all of it, so Cas would have been left with nothing if this place had been empty. The house itself was absolutely beautiful as well. It was a two story, cottage style home, and had two bedrooms on the second floor. The main floor had the kitchen, dining room, living room and bathroom.
Cas couldn't wait to feel Dean inside him. It had been way too long since he had been fucked. Dean bit and sucked another mark into Castiel’s neck as he slid inside, slowly bottoming out. Cas felt so good once Dean slid his cock in him. "Fuck yes."
Dean chuckled. He finishing his cleaning and he locked the door behind him as he headed out to get ready for work himself.
“Fuck…” Dean cursed as he lined up his cock and pushed into Cas’ hole making Cas hiss at the stretch. He probably could have used a bit of prep but he was too impatient. He loved lazy morning sex.
“I have a shirt you can borrow to change into.” He offered, pointing to the drying come on Dean’s shirt. The other man looked down and laughed.
Cas laughed as well. "I'm not going to lie. I was shocked for a couple of seconds. I definitely wasn't expecting it."
He made his way to the school and walked in the building to stand with the other parent’s again like usual, scrolling on his phone through his emails as he waited. A few minutes later, Bianca’s class was being led down the hall by Dean. Cas felt his palms sweat when he caught sight of the other man.
Castiel had been dating Dean for about a month. He couldn't get enough of his perfect little sub. He knew it was soon but he could tell he was falling in love with the man. And Valentine’s Day was a week away. He wasn't sure what to do at this point.  He'd really love to take Dean out for a lovely date, but he wasn't sure yet that his sub would appreciate it.
He spent the rest of the night googling online sex shops and browsing through the plethora of different vibrators, before finally selecting three that had the best reviews. He paid for the items, making sure to have them sent to Dean’s address with a note letting him know they were from Castiel. He even paid for expedited shipping so that Dean would receive them tomorrow, this way he could relax about the auction as Gabe suggested. He went to sleep that night hoping Dean would be pleased at the Good Vibes he sent him.
Cas arrived and they made their way inside, the hostess directed them to the correct room. A few guests had already arrived and Cas found an empty table for himself and Bianca. There were chips on the table, which was enough to entertain her until the guest of honor finally arrived ten minutes later.
Dean rushed through the alleyways, a huge grin on his face and laughter bubbling up as the officer chased him. He had been taunting this guy for months. It was about time he finally found him. But Castiel was so damn tired of chasing this delinquent. He had no idea why this little twink had latched on to him and apparently found it hilarious to taunt him. He was so done with this Cat and Mouse game.
“Fuck yes! Right there!” Cas screamed and Dean continued his assault, fucking up into that spot over and over as Cas continued screaming profanities. “Fuck I’m gonna…. I’m gonna cum!”
a Star Wars Fan?” He squawked indignantly. “Dude understatement. They are my favorite trilogy of movies!”
"Oh, don't worry love. I plan on fucking you so hard you can’t sit for a week." Cas emphasized his point by immediately pulling out and thrusting back in hard and fast, not giving Dean any reprieve. He pushed Dean so he was lying flat and fucked him into the mattress as hard as he could.
“I bet.” He replied. “I’m so proud of you Dean.” He told his boyfriend sincerely, and Dean blushed at the praise.
He was still so confused about the vibrators though. That didn’t seem like something Dean would normally ask of him. They were best friends, sure, but they didn’t talk about sex much; at least not anymore after Dean realized it made Castiel uncomfortable. Luckily Dean had no idea why it made Cas feel that way. He probably just thought it was another one of his weird quirks. The truth though, was that he’d been harboring a crush on the other man for 5 years now, and the thought of Dean having sex with anyone else made his stomach turn. He’d take that secret to the grave though. He knew Dean would never return his affections.
Dean thrusted over and over between Cas’ plush lips, feeling his orgasm building quickly. He felt Cas gently squeeze his balls as he thrusted deep into his throat and that was what tipped him over the edge. He was coming in Cas’ mouth before he had a chance to warn him, but from the deep moan Cas let out, he didn’t seem to mind. His body shook as he emptied into the other man; Cas sucking and licking him through it before the pleasure became too much and Dean gently pushed his head away. He was panting, trying to catch his breath as his knees finally gave out, and he slid down the door, landing on his ass in front of Cas.
Cas looked down at the floor. He could feel tears building in his eyes and he really didn't want Dean to see. He was supposed to be the tough one, god damnit!
"Well, to be totally honest, I haven't dated before." Cas said. He was very insecure about that fact too.
“I swear I am not making any of this up Gabriel.” Cas grumbled, annoyed at having to explain himself again. “My belongings keep moving spots on me, and unless someone is sneaking into my house when I’m not looking, the only explanation is that this house is haunted.”
“Then why have you been playing this game? Why have you been continuing to try to break the law? Why didn’t you just come and tell me this?” Castiel was still not sure what to make of this. Did Dean want him? Like, truly want him? Or was he just trying to mess with him? Castiel didn’t do one-night stands. He couldn’t. It was too hard considering how controlling he was in bed. One-night stands wouldn’t be able to handle that he was a Dom by nature.
"Sorry. Sorry Love. I'm not judging you or anything. It's just...nerve mind it's stupid." Cas said as he hid his face on Dean's head.
“Fuck…yes….” Cas moaned as he gyrated his hips, swiveling them in figure eights before riding up and down again, blowing Dean’s mind. The pleasure was so intense and he couldn’t hold back anymore. He braced his feet on the mattress and started fucking up into his friend.
"Yes. I can get fucked out as much as the next guy. It just takes a lot more." Dean sipped his soda. "That's probably why guys liked hiring me. My paperwork is in my pocket, by the way.”
Cas just sighed before he made himself a cup of coffee as he waited for his brother to finish his shower. He had just taken the last sip when he heard his brother’s loud voice again.
“Sure. Why not?” Cas shrugged as he leaned back into the back of the couch and spread his legs. “Get to it.” He said, eye brow quirked.
“I can’t wait to make you dirty those panties.” Cas growled in his ear as he thrust his body against Dean’s; their hard cocks grinding together in delicious friction. “They feel so good rubbing against my cock.”
Cas looked up and met Dean's wide green eyes. "Yes Dean. I've fallen in love with you. I understand of it's too soon and if you don’t feel the same. But I just wanted you to know."
“Fucking fist me already!” Dean growled, his hole red and sore and gaping around Castiel’s four fingers.
Cas was so fucked out he just laid there. He couldn't tell whether Dean had actually, liked it or not though. He felt stupid again that this was his 'gift' to Dean.
“Oh, okay that makes sense.” She nodded before continuing to jump around to the music. Cas turned back to Dean who was wiping tears from his eyes still.
“I’m not a little lady anymore Charlie.” She scoffed before the smile made its way back on her face. “And yes, I know what to do with it.” She winked back. Cas hoped everything went to plan.
“N-no. I’ve n-never had anything in…inside me.” He stammered out, voice shaky with nerves and arousal.
“I love your boots. They are so fashionable.” She cood at Bianca, and the little girl smiled before she looked at Mary with a serious face.
“Okay. I, uh…I think that’s all I have. Thanks for, ya know, explaining it and stuff.” He was still embarrassed at the conversation, but at least know he knew what he needed to know.
"I could tell it was hard for you. That's why I’m proud of you. And yes, unfortunately I do have work tomorrow." He said regretfully.
Cas sighed. "Yes, I am a cop. What Dean has failed to mention Is that he purposely committed petty crimes to get me attention."
"I... uh..." Cas was so embarrassed now. He felt so stupid about his 'gift'. Dean would probably think he was stupid now too.
“Okay so about a week ago, I uh…” Dean rubbed the back of his neck nervously, the blush having worked its way down his face. “I accidently watched a uh, a gay porn, and… I jerked off to it.” He finished with a whisper. Cas just stared at him dumbfounded.
“Fuck Cas, not that I’m complaining…. but, where the hell did that come from?” He laughed, still breathless from the rough fucking.
Cas sighed as he closed his laptop, pushing it off to the side. He had been searching for weeks now, but he still had no idea what to get Dean for Christmas. This would be their first Christmas together as a couple, and he wanted it to be perfect. It had taken them over a decade to finally get to this point, and he wanted to celebrate that. He smiled when he remembered how they got together.
Dean felt a shiver run down his spine, and he quickly texted back "can't make too many promises about being good all of the time. Just tell me when and where."
Cas hugged Dean tight to his chest. "Mmhmm yes I won't lie. I do love you calling me Daddy. I honestly never thought that I'd find a lover to share that with"
"I’ll try Cas." Dean chuckled, "and for the last time, you are not old.” He said as he rolled his eyes.
Cas stopped what he was doing when he saw the red of Dean's panties. He ran his finger over the edge "Do you always wear underwear like this Dean?" He asked curiously.
Dean scampered to the bedroom and undressed everything except his red thong riding high up in his ass. He sank to his knees; wrists crossed behind his back and dipped his head in the perfect submissive pose.
Castiel smiled despite himself. He didn't dare dream that Dean would ever seriously want him. But deep down he hoped.
“Dean, Dean, this is for you.” Bianca called from the side of the tank as she held out the baseball, she had used to dunk him. But when he took it from her, he realized it wasn’t actually a baseball, but rather just baseball shaped. It had a split around the middle and he opened the top before gasping; inside sat a beautiful platinum ring. He blinked a few times before looking back at Bianca.
“You’re,” Castiel pauses, wanting to trace junction of Dean’s jaw with his fingers. He gives in to it, surprised when Dean lets him. “You are very good at this.”
“It’s just—” The bed shifts and dips as Dean props himself up further to sitting. “Sam doesn’t know about the whole,” he makes some sort of gesture Castiel doesn’t quite understand. Presumably it is lewd. “You know? So, in case this whole shebang don’t end in the next week, I can trust you to keep this quiet, right?”
Now, there’s a lot that they can get away with without words. How many times over the years has a glance sufficed? Saying stuff like,
They’re not quite the right ones, but true enough nonetheless. Castiel itches, flexes his fingers, searches blindly.
For all the times they’ve failed to actually voice shit to each other, it’s always been a little easier than it should be to read the meaning in Cas’ face.
Sam strolls in just exactly a second later, only enough time for Dean to whip around towards the coffee machine at a speed that is definitely, definitely suspicious.
“Sure you don’t,” Dean says. “The show’s pretty to look at, I’ll give you that much, but if you try to dedicate even one of your other senses to it,” he screws up one side of his face in a grimace, “radio interference, man.”
“And there we have the concession. Cas, am I cool to use your truck?” Dean says. “The, like, wood, and all. Y’know.”
“And I did?” Dean lies, because of course he had; he’s known what it is he’s been looking for since the world first went up in flames. But even now, having it, holding it between his hands, it’s still difficult to put it into words. Cas looks at him and allows it. Understands.
“You did nothing of the sort, Dean Winchester,” Cas says, falsely tart. He turns, slowly, carefully, until they’re facing each other, close enough that Dean is satisfied.
.” It feels like fraud, almost, how easy it is to stand in the kitchen and smile at each other, to know that there’s nothing keeping the two of them apart except a countable number of feet across a white tile floor. Dean ducks his head. “You think the kid—” He taps the side of his fist twice against the shared wall. “Hey, Jack, you want any more of those Scooby Doo fruit snacks?”
The waitress returns, unburdening herself of their plates in a haste that leaves Dean a little worried about their structural integrity. “Can I get anything else for you guys?”
So, the garden actually did turn out to be a pretty good spot for this conversation after all, because at least if Dean vomits everywhere, they’ll just have to break out the hose.
Dean clears his throat. “Alright, a little grim for the barbecue place there, Cas, lighten up,” he says, despite the truth that rings in Cas’ words. “It was—you were human, for starters.”
Sometimes, though. Sometimes, he wishes there was. He wishes there was the worst thing, hidden somewhere in his chest like a disease, a rotting animal. He wishes he could pick up that glinting blade and deal the final blow, the one that’s made of
Cas hits him with that deadpan look, the one that gets Dean’s insides lighting up like nothing else, glowing for hours like hot coals at an abandoned camping lot. “You,” he says, real slow and predatory-like, “underestimate me.”
Dean hums around his dick, thrilling at the jump in Cas’ abdominal muscles. This, he knows how to do. This, he knows how to turn from something you leave the motel room whistling because of into something you start to think about the logistics of proposing to a hooker over. He hollows his cheeks and begins the ascent.
“Nothing, just didn’t want to trigger some sort of,” here is where he’d gesture if his arm wasn’t being held so carefully still, “latent angel training and get my arm twisted six ways from Sunday.” He yawns, tremendous. “You know.”
“The rib, from Adam.” Cas looks at the portion of meat in his hands like it’s something more than the cheapest cut the restaurant could get away with serving smeared in a sauce that’s made by the bucket. Dean thinks he can relate a little. “An interesting choice.”
Dean watches his back, the learned hunch of it, and wants to scream. To claw at him, to sink his nails and teeth and self into the meat of his shoulders. He doesn’t. Born a coward, of course he doesn’t. He doesn’t ask why, why now, what went wrong, what has Dean offered up only to be lacking? He doesn’t know if he wants to learn the answers anyhow.
“I,” Castiel says. Of all the decisions that have been piled upon him in his short interim of free will, this is the easiest. “I’ll take whatever you can give me.”
“No,” Cas says, pushing him ever so gently back down with only the weight of his hand. “No, nothing like that. I was merely referencing what I said before.”
“Yeah, okay, let’s put a giant x-marks-the-spot right over the bunker, and—oh, shit, wait,” Dean says, snapping the fingers not holding his phone, “eggs-marks-the-spot. Eh?”
“No, and the object I’m thinking of isn’t an animal,” Dean says, rolling his eyes. “Enough with the twenty questions, dude.”
Dean smiles. “Nah, I mean.” He sighs, trying to let the released air carry away some of the upcoming statement’s syrupy weight. “Thanks for being here to do that shit in the first place.”
And there’s the problem, because that, right there? It’s sure as shit not even ground. Cas, in a single sweeping move that leveled Dean’s insides like a city block, has already told all. There are no more curling secrets in his guts, Dean’s sure of it, because what could possibly be worse than that confession in the basement? What could be more painful than looking Dean Winchester in his sorry face and admitting that you loved him? Cas, he knows, has no more reservations; if there’s anything left to say, he’s spoken it.
Dean takes a step forward, turns them in midair so that he lands with his back on his familiar rumpled navy sheets. He likes it, this position. He likes the baring of his neck. He likes to offer himself, to say
“Ha, perfect, got a little Wednesday Addams right here. Uh.” Dean thinks for a second. “Deadly sins.”
Now, standing in front of the real deal, Dean knew there wasn’t a picture, painting, hell, any translucent fragment of stained glass that could capture the person before him. Dean wanted to slump into him in relief and, from the look on his face, Cas might even allow it. He settled instead on the most stitched together smile he could manage.
Cas glances over with a soft little smile that basically hogties Dean into smiling back. “Maybe so.”
“Good. Because, y’know, if I made it seem like I was angry at you the other day, I’m not.” It’s true. There are much more genuine targets, he knows. “I just—”
“He would,” Jack said, all earnest eyes. “But keeping a portal open at all is going to be difficult enough. We might only have one solid shot at this—I don’t want to lose him all over again.”
Dean eyes him a bit warily but doesn’t try to escape the touch—a trick of the light, heat, maybe, but it feels almost as though he leans into it. “Okay,” he says, drawing out the word. “Anything else on your mind or can we—?”
It’s an answer to a question that was never posed, but Dean knows it without asking, if only because the bullet in his stomach was formed by worrying about this exact thing. “Yeah?”
Dean leans up on an elbow. He’s grinning, a relief to see, fragile as it is. “Hell, Cas, don’t sing my praises too much there, I’ll get a big head.” His eyebrows jump, and he hides a different type of smile in the purse of his mouth. “Well, I guess you already—never mind.”
Cas doesn’t jolt, but his expression slips a little, betraying in its downward lines the desire to be anywhere but in another person’s company. Yeah, well, tough. Dean was out here first.
“I’ll see you inside, killer,” Dean says, winks with all the polish he’s never had to use on Cas. “And then we’ll—”
“Jail, with an underground bare-knuckle boxing ring, sure, whatever, it’s a dirty system, blah blah—that I can accept.”
“You got carrots out here somewhere? We could pickle those, too,” Dean says. What is he talking about. Whatever. “Hell, you can pickle anything, beets, onions, eggs—don’t start.”
“Anything,” he says, clean and simple enough to cut through Dean’s abstraction, for why put a limit on damnation? “Anything you want.”
“Sure thing,” Dean says, caught up in the lines of his profile. “For what it’s worth, I, uh, miss him too. And I’m,” he wants to say it. He has to say it. “I’m glad he doesn’t have to do that, y’know. God shit. I’m glad he’s just here with us.”
Dean looks down before it can spill out of his mouth, the fact that no number of bumps on any amount of walls could ever drive him from the door of this quaint little three-bedroom; he lets the fact that the happiness he’s touched before doesn’t hold a candle to what he’s got now remain unspoken. Cas already knows.
“I—imagine it was Lucifer,” Cas says, a little halting, like the mere mention of the tragedy that’s become Dean’s entire life will leave him sobbing on the floor; he rolls his eyes. Though maybe it would some other day, right now he’s got company, he’s got ribs on the way, he’s—alright. “Lucifer, in possession of Sam’s body.”
“Let me clarify: I don’t want us to talk about it,” Cas says, taking it for none of those, taking the baby bird back into his hands. He steps away.
Dean knows what he’s talking about, knows the track of this old, ancient conversation. “I told you, you don’t have to apologize—”
“I will admit,” he says, slowly. “Cut loose from heaven’s command, I,” Castiel spreads his hands. “There do seem to be too many hours in the day.”
There are words for it, probably, this thing he is experiencing on an unclean motel bed somewhere in the state of Kansas, but he is at a loss to find them now. He can barely do so for its separate quotients—there’s heat, indeed, pressure, the whorl of Dean’s thumbprint as it presses deeply into Castiel’s hip, holding him solidly in place. This single digit is heavy enough to make Castiel doubt the strength of his own grace in moving it, to wonder why he’d ever want to.
“Please,” Dean says. He feels drunk, spinning, and it’s not the three quarters of a beer that’s done him in. He turns his face into the hand resting on it, the source, and begs with words, mouth, tongue. “Please, please, Castiel.”
something—relief, maybe—with the same urgency in which Castiel now longs for the divine. “We sit like this for too long, buddy, I’m gonna start to get ideas.”
Inch by inch, Cas appeared, hand, wrist, and finally arm, clad in the very same trenchcoat he’d worn an age ago when their positions were reversed. Dean clasped his other hand tight around Cas’ shoulder and hauled him the rest of the way into the light.
Jack blinked. “I don’t know what to do,” he said, and Dean took an unwilling step forward at the lost little sound of his voice. “I’ve been working towards you for so long and now—I just don’t know what to do.”
Dean watches him as he drinks, rooted to the floor without an escape plan. He can’t sit on the bed, he’s not fucking insane, but they obviously have to—God help him, or don’t, really—talk about it. He fidgets.
“The end of days,” Castiel says rather than voice anything of the kind, “is not for entertainment purposes.”
Now, he can’t think much of anything at all, drowning beneath Cas lips and teeth and soul. He holds him by the waist, pulls him down, closer and closer. Soon the salt of the earth will be flavored to the two of their bodies.
He’s glad they understand each other now, glad he doesn’t have to search for some broken word living in his own throat to prompt him forward.
The light of his room is softer when he reenters, the overhead shut off to leave only lamplight to guide by. Cas is curled on his side underneath only the top sheet, a parenthesis facing the wrong direction.
“Sure it isn’t.” Dean sighs. “Ever notice that the rules around here never really stay the same for long? Shut up and eat your damn ribs.”
, but sometimes an itch had to be scratched and—well, hellhounds on his heels, it all really did come down to, wait, why
“There’s only one thing I’ll ever choose again,” Cas says, and if the certainty in his eyes doesn’t make the insides of Dean’s elbows ache. It’s too much, almost, to bear that kind of weight, but at the same time, he knows, he
“Dean,” he says again, with a different note in his voice, one that must be audible for the way Dean looks up through his lashes and pulls off. “Dean.”
Dean balks, as much as he’s able. “Are you—‘course I want you, you’re fucking—dude. You think I’d let anyone else?” He ignores the part where he has, kind of. Sure, maybe he’s stumbled through the same approximation of steps with other people, but it feels—with Cas, he hasn’t even learned the words to describe it.
“I’m gonna need to hear you say it.” His blood beats hot in his tongue. “Or, wait, better—break it down for me, real small chunks.”
Dean smiles, hidden in the bend of Cas’ neck. “You smug son of a bitch,” he says. “You know the answer to that.”
“No, you don’t get to—we’re still talking about this,” Dean says, trying his level best not to smile. “Velma is not—she hit on my brother, dude!”
He brushes through the door to the sanctity of a warm, lonesome shower. It’s good, it’s necessary, to regroup, reframe. He’s just fucked his best friend—again—and it’s all normal, it’s all fine. Nothing has to change. He scrubs his chest with absent-minded vigor until the water starts to go a little cold.
“Hey, Cas.” It’s a bit of a pointless two syllables; Cas is already looking at him dead-on—seemingly he never stopped. Which is kind of rude, considering Dean’s done the polite thing and given him the seat facing out towards the rest of the restaurant—not that there’s much currently to watch, but still. The principle. “So, I, uh—I saw a lot of fucked up shit in the future.”
God, does he feel sick, feels the kind of dragging dread that follows him around for days until he can get it to blend into the low-grade, background misery that beats with his heart. He’s sick, with the feeling and in the head; he should be happy Cas’ stood up against him, unhitched himself from Dean Winchester’s runaway train, he should be relieved at least somebody’s got an eye on the horizon.
The recipe is routine, full of spice and fat and heat and prominent in their rotation; Dean slices the thin plastic covering the package of chicken thighs with the pointed edge of a knife and begins to cut them to pieces. Uneven thirds one way, thirds the other, then slid into a cool, waiting metal bowl. The knife rests gentle in his hand.
Sam shrugs. “I don’t know,” he says. “Just—normal shit. No apocalypse, no opposite sides, no more of whatever Chuck had cooked up for us each week.”
Castiel’s eyes are still closed, but he hears, feels everything: Deans’ ragged breathing against the exposed skin of his thigh, the tight press of his hips to the bed below, the hitch in his inhalation. There’s no rulebook for him here, nothing to follow or break, so Castiel merely holds gently to the side of Dean’s head with one hand and digs the other into the meat of his shoulder to ground him or—take him away.
“The—no, but that is compelling,” Dean says. He sets his beer on the nightstand, already too close to spilling it all over his bed. “The shit that bothers me is—how are his friends working this Gargoyle King thing? If I remember last season, the guy with the hat—”
Dean hums a little under his breath as he puts bowls and spoons in their respective places, pours coffee 3/4ths of the way to the top of a yellow mug, and grabs half and half from the fridge to set down in front of Cas. It’s nothing, just the kind of go-nowhere little tune that used to make Sam threaten to smother him under a motel pillow if he didn’t shut up, but it halts itself abruptly enough at the touch of Cas’ hand to his inner elbow.
