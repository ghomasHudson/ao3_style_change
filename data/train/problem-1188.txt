“So that’s it then?” asked John.  “We tell them the victims all went clubbing at the same place, and then we go home?  That’s not like you, Sherlock.”
John shifted round, showing his neck to Sherlock.  “Nope, or I’d be sore, there would be a mark, and it would have bled too.”
“Mike, can I borrow your phone? There’s no signal on mine.”  John was immediately struck by how attractive the man’s voice was; like chocolate, or some sort of lithe, muscular big cat, if cats could talk.  Mike was obviously more used to it, John thought, that or his fondness for rock concerts in his youth had done some damage to Mike’s hearing.
“But this is important!  You must have someone halfway competent that can see me and sign a piece of paper!”  Sherlock’s keen ears caught the sound of a door closing, and from the direction of the noise, he knew Dr Watson was about to come to the rescue.  “I’m sorry Mr Holmes, you’ll need to book an appointment, like the rest of our patients have ALREADY DONE!”  The receptionist glared at him, and Sherlock stepped away from the desk towards the waiting room, where three patients sat waiting for their turn to see the doctor.
It's raining again here in London, and I'm so pleased the case has been solved so I don't have to go out in it today!  We're out of milk again, something to do with an experiment, but I don't know what kind of experiment involves just drinking a cup of tea every 15 minutes throughout the night unless it's an experiment in how to piss off your flatmate when he wakes up and realises he can't have his morning cuppa, Sherlock, and then refuse to buy any more while said flatmate is out at work all day?!!  Luckily for me, all the local takeaway places get so much business from us that they're happy to pick up a pint from the corner shop and deliver it with dinner, so thanks Raj at the Bengal Tiger, your lamb rogan josh and chicken pakora will go down very nicely with the pint of milk I'm planning to drink just because I can!!
John was fascinated by the book; it wasn’t the most literary tome he had ever read, but it was what his Dad would have called a ‘ripping yarn’, funny and fast moving enough that he went through it in a matter of hours.  He left it in his bedroom when he went into work the next day, and found himself thinking it over in between runny noses, rashes and prescriptions for HRT.  John didn’t have the luxury of a chance encounter on a bus to prompt him to change his ways, but (he reasoned) he was an intelligent man, capable of making up his own mind, and he was fed up with being unhappy.  At twenty-seven minutes past three on a Thursday afternoon, John Hamish Watson decided he would say ‘Yes!” more.  More specifically, he decided, he would accept every invitation he was offered for the next month, any time someone asked him if he could do something for them – providing it wasn’t
(See the end of the chapter for
John sat back in his chair as the door closed behind his last patient, and scrubbed his hands through his hair.  It had been a long shift; the bug that had sent Jason home that morning had resulted in a steady stream of patients through his door.  He sighed, and started to enter the notes into his computer for the last patient, jumping when there was a knock at the door.  He didn’t think he had missed anyone, but it had been such a long day and he had completely lost track of where he was.  He assumed it was one of the receptionists, popping in with requests for signatures on prescriptions, or medical insurance forms for completion or hopefully even just the news that he could go home and the new computer system would magically do all the paperwork by itself.  He was surprised when he called “come in!” and Sherlock’s face appeared around the door, and his unique scent hit John full force.  John realised that he’d been away from Sherlock’s scent all afternoon, and it was all the stronger for that.
“Yes, yes,
John.
“I’m worried about John, Sherlock, he wouldn’t stop drinking!  Pint after pint, every time anyone said anything about another round, he went for it!  I’ve never seen him drink like that, has something happened?”
Omegas need their Alphas with them in labour to prevent major damage to the Omega. Babies bond with the first Alpha they meet, so John refuses to have any Alpha in the birthing suite with him, so Sherlock can bond with his child.  Sherlock doesn't make it until after John has given birth, so John suffers injury that needs urgent treatment as a result.  When Sherlock arrives, he sees Mycroft in his shirtsleeves, and assumes he was in the birthing suite with John and has therefore bonded with Sherlock's child, so he runs away and Greg has to chase after him and put him right.
Sherlock had the grace to drop his gaze as he mumbled something John didn’t catch.
“Oh shit…” At that moment, all hell seemed to break loose.  The doors to the street burst open, and Lestrade charged through, followed by half of Scotland Yard, including Donovan, Anderson and Dimmock.
“Come now Sherlock, I couldn’t have my nephew bonding with a member of staff now, could I?  And frankly, what with the American situation, I didn’t have time to do it myself…” Sherlock knew that despite Mycroft’s apparently disinterested tone, he had fought fiercely to protect the rights of both John and his unborn child; to do what was best for his baby brother’s family.
“Father would have approved,” Mycroft replied, and sat at the end of the bed, his nephew safely tucked in his arms.
John was too unwell for the first week or so to realise that Sherlock was too exhausted to interact with him at all, but as time went on, and John’s health improved, he began to worry about the toll everything was taking on Sherlock.  John spoke to Mary one afternoon, telling her all of his concerns for his mate, and after that, she would take Alex off to “check him over” in a corner of the room while Sherlock and John snoozed together on John’s bed, Sherlock’s arms tightly around John and John’s nose tucked into the join of Sherlock’s neck and shoulder.
"Sherlock? Love?"  The curly head snapped up and Sherlock shot across the room to kneel at John's side.
Just at that moment, the phone on his desk rang.  He picked up the receiver, impatient and annoyed with whoever it was interrupting.  “Yes?!” he barked.  “Oh, sorry to disturb you Doctor, but this morning’s surgery is over, we were going to lock up and go for lunch, then I remembered you still have Mr Holmes in there with you,” said Liz, reproachfully.  “Would you like me to stay until you’re done, so I can let him out?”  John forced himself to be polite.  “No, Liz, thank you, that’s fine.  Just leave the keys on the desk and I’ll let him out myself.  I’ve brought my lunch with me, so it’s not like I wouldn’t be here anyway,” he replied.  “Okay then Doctor, if you’re sure? We’re all out together, if you need anyone, you have my number.  The phone’s switched over, so you have nothing to worry about for the next hour and a half!”  John hung up, suddenly feeling extremely nervous.  “Just the receptionist,” he said in reply to Sherlock’s quizzical look.  “Everyone’s gone for lunch, so it’s just the two of us in the building, I’m afraid!”  Sherlock smiled, a lazy, half-lidded smile, full of promise.  “Good,” he replied.  “I do so hate to be interrupted… now, what did you say you wanted me to do?”
“Oh god Sherlock, that’s amazing,” John whispered, as though the slightest noise might result in Sherlock stopping what he was doing.  He trailed his fingers along the back of Sherlock’s thigh, groaning when it resulted in a small shiver from the man, and a deep moan that seemed to set off some sort of feedback loop.  The more Sherlock moaned, the better it seemed to feel, and the more he moaned as a result.  John yanked open the button on his jeans, pulling the zip down and shoving his hand inside his boxers to squeeze his cock, trying to relieve some of the ache.  He turned to kneel up on the bed behind Sherlock, looking down into his eyes, one hand on the back of each of Sherlock’s thighs.  He gently exerted pressure, pushing Sherlock’s cock deeper into his mouth.  Silver grey eyes widened as they fixed on him then fluttered shut…
Mike had brought a seemingly ordinary Omega man round to Bart’s, a man with an ordinary name, who turned out to be the most fascinating person Sherlock had ever encountered.  His ability to know exactly when Sherlock should be cajoled into doing something and when he should be left alone was uncanny.  His skill in preparing a meal that Sherlock would not only eat, but also desire, was unheard of.  Sherlock found himself drawn more and more to John, wanting to be wherever he was, and miserable when he left to go to work at the clinic.  Sherlock didn’t understand it at all; he had met any number of ordinary people and not been affected by them – other than to be extremely annoyed by them, that was.  He had met numerous Omegas of both sexes, male and female, and had never felt the urge to get as physically close to them as it was possible to be, yet with John, Sherlock’s desire to be close was so strong that he sometimes felt as though climbing inside the other man’s skin wouldn’t be enough.
Three days later, John and Sherlock lay, drained, in John’s bed, in his room upstairs.  Three days of relentless fucking, of John mindlessly presenting his slick hole for Sherlock to slide his cock into; three days of John whimpering as he rammed himself mindlessly down on Sherlock’s cock when Sherlock had virtually passed out from exhaustion.  Three days of John begging Sherlock to knot him; of Sherlock taking John in his arms, hand feeding him morsels of food and sips of water to try and keep his strength up before the next urge of
“So?” said Anderson in surprise.  “I’ve got new glasses, what of it?”
Sherlock and John talk about their shared past, and start to deal with the consequences of their bonding...
John knew he was young to be running this sort of camp, only a few years older than the oldest of the 18-25 year olds he was in charge of, but that was precisely why he’d been put in charge.  His commanding officer believed he’d be able to relate to the lads better than the Sergeant Major who’d been in charge up until his retirement last year, and besides, John needed somewhere to finish recuperating after he’d been shot during his last tour in Afghanistan.  The duty wasn’t terribly onerous, and helping these troubled young men appealed to him, fitting well with his caring medical background.
“It’s the people, right?” Sherlock asked. John still wouldn’t open his eyes, his eyebrows knitted tight on his forehead. He grabbed Sherlock’s coat lapels and bowed his head. Sherlock heard him breath in sharply through his nose. He did this several more times before looking up at Sherlock, and nodded.
For those men, he would always be the doctor that killed.
Sherlock is carried to the chopper and John follows the medics. He settles down beside Sherlock. One of the medics asks him to move out of the way again, and this time, he obeys. Just as John is about to move his away, Sherlock grabs John's hand.
“John, didn’t you hear me?” Sherlock pulled the coat up and fixed the coat collar. He walked in again to stand by John’s chair.
Billy looks disappointed at that, but obeys anyway. "Yes, Mr Forster." He says, in a thick Russian accent.
This fact hurt Sherlock, but he took it in stride, since John was right. He was never Rosie's father to begin with. But he cared. He cared about her more than his dead bodies and more than his cases.
~~~~~~~~~
"It was a good case," John mumbled. Sherlock felt his heart flutter with affection and leaned his cheek against John's head.
It was clear that what he had read as desire in the dilation of John's pupils was there for his girlfriend. He had wanted to touch and cuddle with his girlfriend. Sherlock's stomach churned and he sat down in his armchair, legs pulled up to his chest, chin resting on top of his knees.
Sherlock sighed. He knew John had gone to Sarah's place.
Before John can object, the gun is cocked and pointed at Sherlock's heart.
Billy; stupid though he is, gets what John means. Unfortunately, he knows it's an insult and backhands John.
John shoots a glare his way.
When he opened his eyes next, John was gone.
John woke with a start, a sinking feeling settling at the pit of his stomach, the crick in his neck hindering his movements.
John took a deep breath. Angry though he was, he didn't want to leave Sherlock to whatever trouble he had gotten himself into. Leaving Sarah seemed a necessity at this point.
Sherlock’s resolve crumbled a little more and the scream that ripped from his throat was one of pain let loose. Months of keeping it all in, months of hiding his affection from the very object of his affections and the consequences that had followed; all of it came crashing down on him and he slumped against the metal floor.
Sherlock sprung up from his chair and started pacing around the room, his nerves on edge. He fiddled with his phone, his fingers hovering over the call button, Mycroft's name flashing on the screen.
It has been hours since Sherlock entered his mind palace to revisit his memories. When he comes back to himself, the sun has set, shrouding him in complete darkness. His head doesn't hurt as much though, and there are no screams to be heard; which means the drug is wearing off.
The room was a private ward, but it wasn't the luxury ward so it was safe to assume that Mycroft hadn't been informed yet. John limped over to the window. The sight that met his eyes was horrible in too many ways to count. Sherlock lay there, his body limp and broken. John's breath caught in his throat as memories of war flooded into his mind. For a moment, he was back in Afghanistan, and the bombs had claimed Sherlock and he could do nothing but watch. Watch as the bombs tore Sherlock's body to shreds, watch as Sherlock screamed in agony until he couldn't.
He tried his hardest not to sleep, because he knew what he would see the moment he closed his eyes.
Before he could react, John had tackled him around the waist, sending them both flying into the pool. Sherlock knew something was wrong as soon as he had surfaced. John was nowhere to be seen.
It was Sherlock’s turn to go still. He stared at the laptop, not registering what he had previously typed. His mind was in chaos.
John stood a couple of minutes outside of the front door letting his anger simmer for a bit. When his fingertips started getting cold he fished out the keys and opened the door. The hallway was warm so John took off his jacket and hung it beside Mrs. Hudson’s jacket. His steps were heavy as he climbed the stairs up to the first floor. When he reached the top he stopped at the doorway looking at Sherlock sitting in his chair. Sherlock didn’t register his presence and continued to look down at his phone. Angrily John stepped into the kitchen to make tea. Sherlock hummed but John decided to ignore it. As he carried his tea back into the living room Sherlock jumped out of his seat.
10th November
Sherlock :
"No." Came the stiff reply. Sarah was getting out of bed and putting on her dressing gown when John realized something. He had always known he wouldn't be able to fit into civilian life after coming back from Afghanistan. He had never imagined he would come back from the war in the first place. But he had supposed that if he did make it out alive, he would marry some girl and settle down in a domestic family life. What he hadn't taken into consideration was Sherlock. Whatever vague plans he had had with Sarah for his future were destroyed because of one text. From Sherlock. John clenched his fist.
[04/10, 5:55 pm] JOHN WATSON: Sorry for expecting you to take care of my daughter in my time of need.
[04/10, 6:15 pm] YOU: I'm a high functioning sociopath and insulting me isn't going to earn you any brownie points. -SH
One of the bulkier men frees John from the chair he's tied to and ties his hands behind his back instead. He pulls John by the hair and forces him to his knees. The shorter man still has the gun pointed at Sherlock, so John doesn't raise a finger to defend himself. He swallows down the panic that rises in his throat.
Think, think, think! Sherlock clutched at his hair. As he was about to turn left he heard a banging sound on the right. He spun around and went the other way. As he approached the sound it quietly died out.
He was about to type out a "What the fuck are you doing?" when he heard a snigger behind him.
Slowly, the fog lifted and Sherlock started deducing John. It became evident that John hadn't been staying at the doctor's housing quarters. He had been with a woman last night. Sherlock felt anger and bile rise within his throat.
Nothing more mattered now. Not the world, not the monster in his belly, not even the drink he had ordered.
[04/10, 6:16 pm] JOHN WATSON: What condition.
“Oi, watch out,” John said and continued down the road. Another John touched his arm.
When they reached home, the case was still not solved and he had some very uncomfortable emotions clogging his brain.
"As you wish." And Sherlock began at the beginning, talking about every detail and clue while John slowly fell asleep on his shoulder, leaving a small spot of drool.
Sherlock looked up from his microscope, tilting his head to the right. Upstairs he could hear John moving in his bed. Nothing out of the ordinary so he turned back to his experiment again.
“What’s wrong?” Sherlock asked carefully. John put his cup down with a small slam. He folded the paper, letting it ruffle loudly.
John glanced up at the ceiling for one long moment and decided to head up to bed
"Oh. Okay."
The wide gaping hole in Sherlock's side is just as horrible as John remembers seeing in Afghanistan. He pushes his palm against the wound and lifts Sherlock onto the stretcher they have brought.
He stared at the other chair, idly wondering how long it would be before he lost John to one of his girlfriends.
"I was calling….." John rested his free hand against the wall and panted. "I was calling to ask you to help me with the groceries. They're too bloody heavy and I can't bring them up by myself."
Sherlock took a deep breath and started walking away. He could hear his heart thundering in his chest.
He took a step back from the man, trying not to think about what happened when he got himself into a situation like this. During his twenties, alleys and strange men gave him what he needed most; drugs. But right now, even thinking about that time made him shiver.
“Come on John, Molly’s waiting at Barts.”
[04/10, 5:56 pm] YOU: Not that you were worried in the first place.- SH
Thank you to ixia_ixora for helping me thru this chapter! ❤Hope y'all like it!
He tries to remember how he got in a dingy cell in the middle of nowhere.
"What are YOU doing here?"
“John, I don’t quite under-” Sherlock whispered before being interrupted by John.
His jaw was stinging and he couldn't see or hear anything for the next few seconds. The alcohol wasn't helping either.
Sleeping that night was harder than Sherlock had imagined. The guilt churning in his gut was worse than not being able to solve a case, even though he had solved this one.
comments and kudos are always welcome and will fuel our muses to bring u consequent chapters faster! <333
"Sh'lock?" He asked, squinting in the general direction of his flatmate.
He cannot see Sherlock because two men are blocking his view of him, and he starts kicking at them frantically.
Suddenly, a scream cuts through the air.
The worst part was watching as the magnitude of his words hit John. He staggered, taking a step away from Sherlock.
Comments and kudos are highly appreciated. Comments will certainly make us scream (in delight if that wasn't clear btw)
The voice is eerily familiar.
"Yes." He answered, not daring to meet Sarah's eyes even as his voice sounded steady and confident to his own ears.
John sighed and tried to collect himself. “Sarah broke up with me.” His voice broke.
"Tell me where you are John, I'm coming," Sherlock said, as he thundered down the staircase, not bothering to change out of his pajamas. He needed to rescue John.
Sherlock and John finally slowed down. Even though they were in a park, he knew they were safe for the time being. They both needed the time to catch their breaths.
Mr Forster falls to the ground, his brains blown out. John has a second to wonder where the bullet came from before he hears Sherlock's scream of pain. John tries to rip himself free from the men's hands but their iron grip is too strong for him. He hears himself scream Sherlock's name into the gag over and over as tears threaten to choke him.
[04/10, 5:58 pm] JOHN WATSON: Sarah will be there in 10.
And so, he stared John in the eye and asked him, “What are you trying to imply?”
Sherlock, as a rule, never had nightmares. It was not that he hadn't seen his fair share of blood and mangled corpses.
John slammed his hand down on the table and fished his phone out of his pocket. He tapped on Sherlock's number and opened the chat window.
For Catherine, my wonderful beta, watch out for those knitted condoms!
“Hmmm?” John replied, his mind still on the latest genetic discoveries with regard to Autistic Spectrum Conditions.
“Problem?”  John smiled incredulously, glancing over at Mike as though he might have some insight, before turning back to the man again.
Sherlock was real.  I only met him twice, but I could see how amazing his mind was, even if his manners left a few things to be desired.  John had told me how Sherlock had taken one look at him and been able to deduce almost everything about his life and his career, and he did exactly the same to me.  I contrived to bump into him outside a coffee shop, and he took one look at me and knew exactly who I was, and I mean
A strange noise from the kitchen made him struggle slowly and carefully up from his prone position, and for a moment or two, he didn’t quite believe what he was seeing.  Jilly was standing with a large piece of paper trapped underneath her paw.  In her mouth was a large permanent marker, and she was decisively marking the paper.  John laughed a little and shook his head, instantly regretting it.  “Jilly, come! Come on girl, come here!”  Sherlock poked his nose into John’s side, huffing and butting at him.  “Sherlock, what the hell are you doing?  I’m starting to get seriously worried about you!”
John’s heats had steadily been getting stronger as he had lived with Sherlock, but he had attributed that to the fact that he was an unbonded Omega, living with an unbonded Alpha, as Sherlock had suggested.  John had never lived with an Alpha before, other than when he had lived at home with his parents, so he naturally assumed that Sherlock was right; after all, he hadn’t yet known him to be wrong.  By the time John had presented as Omega, Harry had already moved out, going off to uni, where she had met Clara, and she had never moved back home.  Although John’s dad was an Alpha, she had been bonded to his mum, so it hadn’t been an issue for John.  When Sherlock had sunk his cock into John though, it was as if a switch had been flicked inside him, and his heat had exploded.  John had been unable to go more than about twenty minutes at a time before he was reduced to sobbing and begging for Sherlock’s knot, and Sherlock had been hard for almost the entire time.
“Okay Sherlock, you can come with me to work, but don’t go making a fuss, I’ll be perfectly fine.  Probably even more now than I was last week, since I’m bonded to you, my Alpha.”  Sherlock smiled a little at his words, and the two of them set off again.  John smiled privately to himself when Sherlock’s hand crept into his, and they completed the journey to the Tube station hand in hand.
"Sherlock, what have you done to my bed?"
Feel free to leave a comment about your frustration, it is much appreciated
[04/10, 5:59 pm] YOU: Wow. So I'm Mr Holmes now, am I. -SH
4th November
Four times John fell asleep on Sherlock, and one time it was different.
He turned slightly, eyeing the huge man standing behind him. John thought the man looked familiar, but he said nothing. He shrugged and got back to his drink, trying to type out the message even though his fingers weren't co-operating.
Just as they were about to turn the last corner John stopped walking and looked at Sherlock.
"She's a cat owner, and is expecting a grandchild. Probably a granddaughter. Completely harmless."
There is no John Watson here. There was no one screaming. And John is never going to come to save him. Or talk to him ever again.
Sherlock, instead of taking the cue and shutting up, continues into dangerous territory. “Besides, today wasn’t a date. Judging from your response time, you weren’t even having fun while at Sarah’s. You were LOOKING for a distraction. The only reason you are so angry and upset is that your ego was hurt after she dumped you. She is the fourth female in a row who has ended things with you. And you being-”
The tornado of emotion inside Sherlock did not die away even as John was rushed into emergency surgery, even as the doctors said he was safe.
Sherlock got into the cab. He had left Mrs Hudson to babysit Rosie, but he was worried about her. As arrogant as he was, he knew that spending time with a sociopath was not good for a child and her psychological health. The girl didn't even know what to call Sherlock. She kept on switching between Sherlock and Uncle Sherlock. But Sherlock remembered that initially Rosie had called Sherlock daddy. When Rose gained some years John had successfully made her understand that Sherlock was not her dad.
He knew with startling clarity that if there was one person who needed to get out of there alive, it was John. He didn't know why, didn't know how, just that John's life was important and that he needed to live. He took a deep breath and cocked the gun.
---------------
"Sh'lock…... sherlock help," John was breathing heavily on the other end and Sherlock's relief shriveled and died.
[04/10, 6:25 pm] YOU: Of course. Enjoy being a rubbish father to Rosie.-SH
"You were there the whole time John." His voice was muffled by John's hair.
“Have fun at Barts,” he said and went upstairs.
“Yes,” he growled looking away from John’s beautiful dark eyes. “It’s true.”
The short man snorts, looking bored. "Shut him up." He orders.
"What about the lady over there?" John asked, his voice low. Sherlock looked to the right where a woman stood examining some old plates.
He needs to think about something else. He enters his mind palace and opens the first door he can spot. And inside, are the memories he had been trying to avoid for so long.
John huffs, "You're in quite a strop."
---------------
He squinted against the sudden flash of light as his screen lit up.
John's heart breaks a little as he looks at Sherlock, and even as his side bleeds profusely, the only thing Sherlock is worried about even after being shot and drugged and concussed….. is John.
"Jo-"
Pandemic days had made their impact on Baker Street and it's residents.
Sherlock hugged the sleeping Rosie to his chest one last time and let the tears fall.
Finally, he sighed and sat down in his chair by the fireplace. “How was Barts.” John asked, his voice betraying nothing.
Sherlock waved a dismissing hand and sighed. "I'll clean it up tomorrow."
Sherlock efficiently hailed a cab and helped a half-asleep John in. Carefully he fastened their seatbelts. John slumped down in his seat, as much as the seatbelt allowed, and leaned his head on Sherlock's shoulder.
“You could lay your head in my lap you know.”
Sherlock took a deep breath and dived back under.
What John had implied right now….. It couldn’t be….. How could he have been so stupid. Sherlock had resolved not to let John find out. Not to let anyone find out.
Something was wrong. He could feel it in his bones John picked up his phone and fiddled with it, debating whether or not he should call Sherlock after what had happened.
“He’s been working in an office in the maternity unit, it’s sweltering in there because of the newborns… He had to leave a meeting with the Vice President of America when you wouldn’t answer your phone, you twit!”  As he spoke, Greg could see the light returning to Sherlock’s eyes, followed by guilt as he realised how much John must be suffering without him.
He knew he had sent Dr Watson’s mind in the right direction when he said “Mr Ho- Sherlock, I need to test your reflexes, it’ll be easier to do that if you slip your trousers off.”  Sherlock stood without any objections, and unzipped his trousers, revealing a pair of tight fitting black trunk-style briefs, which did nothing to conceal the hard erection inside them.  “Where do you want me?” he asked, the choice of words deliberate.  Dr Watson turned quickly, clearing his throat, saying “Just where you were before is fine.”  Sherlock sat back on the couch, crossing his legs, ankle to knee to frame his groin.  Dr Watson took a firm grip on his ankle, and slowly pulled his leg, sliding it across his knee until his legs were crossed knee to knee, saying, “No, I mean like this.”  The sight of Dr Watson looking him straight in the eye and taking command of the situation sent another bolt of desire straight to Sherlock’s cock, and he hissed another breath in.  Dr Watson conducted the reflex text, taking hold of Sherlock’s legs to swap them over and conduct the test on the other knee.  Sherlock watched as Dr Watson realised he had finished the examination; this was where things could go one of two ways.  Either Dr Watson would go back to supressing his attraction and the examination would finish here, or he would take his courage in his hands and make a move.
‘Fine’ thought John determinedly ‘I’ll just have to found out myself’
LOCKED’
Emma didn’t talk when John answered her question, because she was right, he did want to talk about him, and apparently, he has a lot to talk about. She learned that her grandchild’s soul-mate is a he, and his name is Sherlock. He told her about his black curly hair, fair skin and about his amazing kaleidoscope eyes. She now knows how they first met, about his obsession with bees and gore, his experiments and everything that John could think about. Her heart warmed at the sight of her grandson’s face when he talked about his soul-mate (and best friend, as she learned), his whole face lit up when he says his name. Her eyes were glossy, she had never seen John like this, she wants to go to Sherlock and thank him so much for making her grandson this happy. She suspected from the start that there was something different about their bond, because of course, she noticed that her 16 years old grandson is talking with a 13 years old boy, it should be impossible, but somehow it happened, and by the way that John is speaking animatedly, she couldn’t be happier.
“John Locke, I didn’t know you were a fan”
“Why is there an ‘Escape’ button in the microwave? Sherlock! did you took it from my computer?!”
And I'm sorry that it's sort of a short one, but I have a plan for the rest of the story, and I plan to finish it.
And waited
“Okay then,” he got up and stood behind him “Do you need any help?” he asked with a smirk as he watched Sherlock Shake from their close proximity.
“Do you know each other?” Mike asked excitedly
Earlier that day, just as he set his foot in the house, he ran to his room and grabbed his new camera and snapped a photo of his arm, especially, a photo of the question that started their conversation. Afterward, he ran to the bathroom and cleaned his arm the best he could, he didn’t want anyone to know, he wanted a secret, something that was only his and Sherlock’s.
With a shake of his head, he stood up and walked away.
John knows about Mycroft (or as Sherlock calls him, Piecroft), and that they’re, supposedly, despise each other (even though John can read between the lines that there’s a strong brotherly love bond between the two of them and that they love each other. But he already learned the hard way not to say that to Sherlock, he won’t repeat that again).
They play the violin, they know chemistry, they’re super smart, he doesn’t know how lucky he is to get this kind of soul-mate.
grade”
I hope you enjoyed it :)
Overall, they were happy, they talked and doodled, got to know each other, talked about their days, their hobbies, thoughts, everything.
He mentally shakes his head,
‘The physics, the logic, the need to understand humans, all the his ‘philosophy’ (John rolled his eyes mentally at this one), it all makes sense now…’
“Sherlock! What are you doing here? I thought that you don’t learn here”
When they got to the school, they laughed like old buddies, Mike with full body laugh and John with fake ones. It’s not that he didn’t find the stories funny, he just wasn’t in the right mood to laugh, but every distraction right now is welcome.
“SORRY HARRY!”
“No problem” John answered, and watched as the kid tensed, and he thought that maybe he felt the same thing.
When he got there, he sat down and pulled out his pen
“Good.
4. You are too (And don’t tell me you’re not, or that you have homework to do, you’ve already done them yesterday)
he took a black marker and drew a big, toothy smiley on the back of his hand and waited in anticipation for the death threat he knew was about to come.
“Helloooooo….? Guys, what’s got into yo-” That’s when he noticed their arms.
“Umm… guys? What’s with all the staring?”
“OH, shush! I’m an old fossil with nothing interesting in her life, give me something to work with! But do it while you finish your arm, we don’t want your betrothed to wake only half painted. But tell me about them, you know you want to” the corners of his eyes crinkled as she gave him a warm and encouraging smile, and he knew that she was right, he really wants to brag about Sherlock.
‘The lock screen…
and waited
“What?” Sherlock answers as Innocently as a grown man that holds a serial killer with one hand and that bloody phone in the other, only can.
It’s quite a long walk to his house, at least 20 minutes if he walks quickly (which is a difficult thing to do considering his short legs), so he has some time to think about what just happened.
they wrote and John’s expression turned worried, but after a few moments, they continued
“THROW THAT ALARM OUT OF THE BLOODY WINDOW!”
Enjoy :D
Sherlock’s eyes widened and he rolled his own sleeve to look at his arm. John couldn’t see from his angle anything, except the boney pale hand twitch under the kid’s intense gaze upon it. A slow smile crossed his face as he raised his arm to John’s eye level to reveal the message written there.
Quiet
John Locked
“I still want to get in” he stated matter-of-factly, and John giggled
He took out a pen, uncapped it and drew a square on his arm and filled it. John can fill it being created on his own arm, so he rolled his sleeve up and looked it mesmerized as the square was being filled with black ink. After that Sherlock pulled out a Q-tip and grabbed John’s arm gently, he dabbed the tip gently on John’s skin, at the square of color he created on himself, until he swiped a little ink from it. And now John realized what he wants to check, he wants to see if it’s the same ink is transformed from one to the other, he must admit that the thought about the subject did not cross his mind, he just accepted it as is, but of course that Sherlock wants to do experiments on the subject.
‘Oh right, he’s in princess mode’ chuckled John, ‘Sherlock in a dress and a tiara is not a bad picture, now, that’s something I’d like to see’ he thought with rosy cheeks. He made a mental note to ask Sherlock about the escape button that he just found, and took the beeping phone.
“OH, yes! Yes, of course, yes, I have to…” and with that, he went away.
Emma thought as wiped the tears that were able to escape.
“Are they sexy?”
“Mike? Mike Stamford, I just moved back last week, we were in the same class in until 3
Just as they were about to round the next turn in the hall, they heard a clanging voice and a curse (at the sound, a shiver went down John’s spine) And they moved cautiously toward the noise (which was near the school laboratories). As they turn the corner, John saw a small skinny kid crouching down to pick… lockpicks, apparently. His head’s full of black curls that covers his entire face, and a dark coat that drapes dramatically around him.
5. We’re soul-mates
“Sherlock Holmes, soul-mate, glad to finally meet you” and finally took his hand.
“John? John Watson?!”
After a few bits of silence, he saw little bees being drawn around the flower.
“Oh, don’t worry, you don’t have to do anything,” Sherlock said with a dismissive hand motion, clearly, he was trying to make John calm, he did not succeed.
6. I want to officially meet my best friend”
“Mike”
“Sherlock!! answer your goddamn texts!”
“Do you want to come with me? I need to go to school, I forgot something in my locker” Mike suggested with a small smile
“THEN WHY ARE WE STILL YELLING?!”
“So… Let’s start over, I’m John and I guess that I’m your soul-mate” he said as he held out his hand to shake, and just as he hoped, it made the other snicker. Sherlock pulled his head up a little, and with a twinkle in his eyes answered
John search the library for Moby dick while Sherlock was in his mind palace, you know, as usual, when a familiar “Ding” was heard from Sherlock phone and pulled him back to reality and snatched the phone to see if lestrade had any updates about their correct case.
“oh I’m sorry, John this is Sherlock Holmes, I moved next door to his family. Sherlock, this is John Watson, he’s an old friend of mine”
One time he drew a yellow smiley face, a gun and dotted the smiley, repeatedly, with a red marker. Underneath it, he wrote in bold characters, with the same red marker “BORED”.
“Double date, or… wait, who else knows about it? Am I the only one?! Did you two meet because of me?!”
“Stamford!” Sherlock tried but to no avail. John turned to face him and saw Sherlock with a red face, and he wouldn’t meet his eyes.
“Sherlock?”
, John answered in his mind, which made him blush and Sherlock smile smugly)
“Yeah, okay.” John said as he made his way to the stool, “What are you going to do?” he asked with a huge grin as he sat down and looked around “It’s so weird” he mumbled under his breath.
He looked at his arm and saw that they no longer had any place on this arm, so he wrote on a patch of clean skin
Sherlock gave him a quizzical look which made John laugh even harder.
“I’-I hav..” John tried explaining, but the laughter made it so much more difficult
John couldn’t realize why she’s drawing another bee until she finished, and then she left John giggling on his bed. Emma never felt this good in a long time.
“What happened to you? It looks like someone ran over you?”
*0o0o0*
And he realizes that he completely forgot his arm and continued to work, while he decided to answer his grandma (not that he has a choice on the subject), and actually, he finds that doing something in this awkward conversation is helping him to calm down.
Sherlock started to calm down first, so he picked up his lockpicks and started again to pick the labs door
Which is the second thing, he talked to Sherlock, his soul-mate, the most amazing person he ever met, it’s not even supposed to be possible, which adds to his excitement, they’re special, he just knows it, there’s something special about the two of them, something rare, unique. He just hopes Sherlock will find something because he has a feeling that Sherlock will not rest until he’ll get answers.
“John Locke” John said
, he thought happily, but he still made a mental note to ask Sherlock when he’ll get home.
He sat back on his bed, turned on his bedside lamp, rolled up his pajamas sleeve and began to laugh quietly (so he wouldn’t wake the rest of his family).
Sherlock haven’t even twitched
) and started to write
A. Electronegativity is decreasing.
“Mike Stanford!” he hears Sherlock roars, and he snorted at the surprised look on Mike’s face as he finally shut his mouth.
And if they noticed Mike hiding on the doorway, with a grin and a small camera, taking pictures of the two. None of them mention it.
*0o0o0*
“Sherlock! you got a text!”
“Yo..you saw t..that?” and now he’s stuttering, ‘what is going on?’ John thought, he tried to connect the pieces
“It’s just Mycroft trying to make me to take the case about the missing puppy of the queen, boring, give me my phone”
“OKAY GRANDMA” “SORRY GRANDMA!” “GO BACK TO SLEEP MOM” “SORRY EMMA!”
But, not surprisingly, Sherlock ignored him and went back to the living room while answering the messages.
After a few bits of silence, he felt the other responses in a slow, unsure writing
He realized,
John thought dangerous thoughts
Sherlock only answered with his annoying “Okay” in his indifferent tone that just screams ‘Shame!’ at the receiving end. But John didn’t miss the quick relief that flashed in his eyes ‘What was that?’
At the timid voice, John realized that he looked up at mike and moved his head back, only to see the set of the most magnificent set of eyes he has ever seen, but he couldn’t speak, not one sound could escape his mouth, so he pulled out a pen that he always carried around with him and rolled his sleeve up, not taking his eyes off Sherlock (
*0o0o0*
“You know what?” asked John angirly in the end of a case.
And John told Sherlock about himself (even though there’s not a lot to talk about, and that in John’s opinion, that it’s not very interesting). He told him about his family, Harry, his mother’s drinking problem and how he fears that Harry is going down the same way, about his thoughts to join the rugby team next year, he shared his dream of becoming a surgeon in the future.
“I wanted to see how the human eyeball would react to being microwaved, But now! Because you’re here, I want to check a something” he exclaimed with an enthusiastic smile.
You really have no idea what that means to me, so, thank you so much and I hope I won't disappoint you.
“John?”
The words flew across his arm in a high speed and John couldn’t contain his amazement
Yes, we know each other; we are soul-mates; we don’t know how it’s possible for us to communicate; It’s going on for about two years now; we like to think that we are somehow special; we discovered it when John was about to fail his chemistry test and needed help, it was a bet, but a good one; again, two years; I guess that I was the reason why he was bitter earlier, so, yes; It works as expected, you write something and it appears on the other’s arm; yes, you’re the only one that knows, so please, don’t tell anyone; No, you will not be a groomsman; yes, blue will complement John’s eyes; No, we will- What?”
*0o0o0*
A month later and he’s still not closer to find it.
*0o0o0*
Later that day, at half-past two in the morning, John woke his pleasant sleep to the familiar prickling feeling.
“For the love of god”
Until he felt he saw that Sherlock wrote something on the first arm
He rolls his sleeve up and sees a red circle around the letter D.
First of all, for the first time in his life, he cheated on a test. He, John Watson, cheated on a test, and he doesn’t even care, because the most wonderful thing came out of it.
He just talked to his soul-mate, and they’re brilliant! So smart and talented!
2. We talk to each other every day, almost all day long, for almost two and a half years now
Furious, John walk around the chair to face Sherlock “I can’t believe it you... you wanker!!”
John Watson is an ordinary kid who’s trying his best at school, even with all the stress at home, he’s trying his best and most of the time it works, almost straight A’s at everything.
What he didn’t expect to see was a yellow color filling out one tooth, also that black dots would also pop up on his hand indicating a five o’clock shadow, and finally a black eye patch was added.
John raised his head from his newspaper to see that Sherlock is still in his mind palace, ‘five hours now, I wonder how his palace is decorated’ John thought fondly, but the affectioness feeling was soon replaced with irritation when another
He told him things that he never told anyone, he felt like himself while talking to him.
“J..John I ca..can explain…”
“What?”
“Oh,” he said as he blushed as he looked at her. Her fair skin looks worm in the yellow light; her light blue nightgown in wrinkled just as her wrinkly skin; her updo, that she styles every night before bed, is now messy, with grey hairs sticking out from here and there. It’s clear that she just woke up. But he doesn’t know how to answer her, he doesn’t know if he could tell her the truth, but her bright blue eyes are filled with understanding, and as the silence continues floating in the air while waiting for his answer he realizes that she averted her eyes to his arm, that’s currently is covered with half-finished birthday wishes and drawings of bees, of skulls with candles on them and of smileys  “umm, sorry grandma that I woke you, it won’t happen again” he says sheepishly as he tries to cover his arm with his rolled pajama sleeve.
John laughed nervously “Nothing, just thinking”
, she thought,
“That’s brilliant! I’m the matchmaker! Unbelievable! May I be a groomsman at the wedding? I want to help plan! May I help you?! Please! Pleasepleaseplease! I imagine a fall wedding, it will be a small one, I can’t see that each of you will want a lot of people there, it will be outside, the ceremony will be near the river, under a tree, maybe a willow, that will be beautiful. We’ll do it in the evening, so fairy lights! Lots and lots of fairy lights! And you John! Will put a dark blue tie, maybe with white dots on it, the blue will compliment your eyes, oh you’ll be so handsome, I imagine you with a three-piece suit, white shirt, grey vest and navy-blue jacket on top, oh, so lovely”
They started to exchange little works of art during the day and it made John happy every single time.
“W..what?” Sherlock asked frightened
The moment their hands touched they felt an electric shock going through their veins. But it wasn’t painful, it was… comforting, it felt good, like coming home.
As if on instinct, he moved next to the kid and helped him to pick all of the lock picks
Relief washed over John that this wasn’t a one-time thing, but he still felt a little bad for disturbing his soul mate
Those eyes are… amazing
“Okay…”
John thought as he wiped the tears that rolled down, quite pointlessly actually, since they’re just got replaced with new ones,
The sound of the notification caught Johns attention and he turned his head just in time to see Sherlock enters his password.
*0o0o0*
“Oh…” John breathed out
3. I’m bored
John doesn’t know how long they sat there on the floor outside the laboratories holding hands, maybe a few hours, maybe less than 10 seconds, but when they heard Mike giggles behind the lockers they drew apart and John felt that it wasn’t enough, like he could stay in that moment for the rest of his life, just sitting there, holding hands and stare into each other's eyes, it will be spectacular.
‘Interesting’ John thought ‘I wonder what’s his password’
The voice shook him out of his venomous mind and he turned around to face the person who called his name.
“You can sit over there,” Sherlock points at a stool near a table “I’ll fetch the equipment” and with that, he walked into the lab closet.
“I give up! I don’t even care what your password is! I declare defeat! you can keep your precious secret password to yourself I don’t bloody care anymore”
“I DON’T KNOW!!”
With his head held up high he’s going to find Sherlock and to start the new plan.
“EVERYONE! JUST SHUT UP!!!!”
John answered with a small smile and a nod and followed Mike towards the school.
After he finished and submitted his test, he grabbed his backpack and ran outside in a beeline towards the quite spot under the tree, in the back of the school.
and when the first sun rays brightened the world, he looked at himself. At some point during the night, they shed their clothes almost completely, only their pants stayed on them, their arms and legs were full of drawings, from little doodles to brilliant sketches that Sherlock drew of skulls and bees (Sherlock is an amazing artist, and apparently, he loves bees). And John shot a picture of every single one of them.
“What?” asked Sherlock
“Hello John”
“Umm I-I…” he shook his hand and cleared his throat “I can ask you the same thing”
And with the happiest smile in his life, he replied “Hello Sherlock”
And just then they allowed themselves to start laughing. They just couldn’t stop. Tears streaming down their faces, they doubled over as their stomachs clenched and hurt, and the muscles in their faces ached from smiling so much.
p.s, thank you sooooo much for your amazing comments! every single one of them made me so happy.
John’s grandmother didn’t talk right away, she first learned to him, and rested her head on the palm of her hand as she raised a brow and the corner of her mouth quirked up, and a dreamy sigh escaped her lips.
The blond boy jumped as he heard her question, apparently, he didn’t hear her coming in,
“What is he talking about?” you might wonder “who are they?”, “How could they help?”
“Bloody children, all of them” Emma, the grandma grumbled as she opened John’s door the reveal her 16 years old grandson scribbling something on his arm under the bedside lamp.
Am I not yours?”
No matter how much time he dedicates to learn, no matter how many times Harry found him at 3 am with his nose in the textbook, no matter how much time he spent with his tutor. Nothing helped, he still failed every single test this semester.
(This one made John snort in the middle of class, and the teacher was not happy about it, and when he answered the question of “What did you find so funny?” with “My soul-mate” at the age of 14, no one took him seriously and with an eye roll the teacher continued the lesson)
he wrote
John began to worry, what if it was a one-time thing? What if it was a fluke?
A toothy grin broke John’s face as he went to work.
“Grandma!”
His eyes widened as he realized what is happening.
He took the marker and rolled his other sleeve up to reveal a clean arm, and drew a flower
John writes quickly on his arm when the teacher turns her back, and now he waits.
he thinks fondly as he watches Sherlock bends over the microscope with a little smile on his lips.
Thirty seconds and no answer, maybe it’s not a really long time to wait, but for a kid who feels like he has false hope, it feels like an eternity.
“BUT I ALREADY TURNED IT OFF AFTER THE FIRST YELL!”
In this universe, almost every human is one of a team, and you can communicate with them quite easily. Just write something on your body and it will appear on your soul mate.
For two weeks, every moment that he could, John would take the phone and tried to guess the password, he went as far as to purchase a small notebook and wrote there the different combinations, already he filled out 18 pages.
I'm sorry for the delay, it's just... life
He turned it on only to realize that there’s a password, and that the lock screen is surprisingly identical to the lock screen of The Woman.
“Mike!”
“NO!”
‘Now it all makes sense’ John thought shocked, ‘how have I missed it?’

(See the end of the chapter for
John never really talked with them, he never really had a reason to. This ability is supposed to appear in 17 y/o, but at 14, he’s not supposed to be able to do it.
Two minutes later he feels an itch on his arm.
D. The atomic number increases.
*0o0o0*
From Grandma Emma
Even though he preferred to talk to Sherlock at a reasonable hour, he couldn’t help but to leap out of the covers and grab the nearest pen.
Most of the times, it was Sherlock who did the drawings (even though it was mostly just the word “bored” in different fonts, colors, and styles), and because he was homeschooled, and was free most of the time to terrorize John’s arm with pens and markers.
“ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! WHY IN THE HELL WOULD YOU SET YOUR ALARM TO HALF PAST FIVE IN THE BLOODY MORNING?!?!”
“What?” Sherlock asked with a confused look on his face
He tried to say something, anything! But nothing comes out. “Oh, stop gaping John, you look like a fish, it doesn’t suit you,” she says with a frown that’s not going to convince anyone.
“Take a few breaths mate, and try again” said Mike, laughing as well
(See the end of the chapter for
I hope you'll like it
“Your password!” John exclaimed and watched as the color drained from Sherlock face, “It was ‘JOHN’ the entire time?!” and... he’s blushing?, the great Sherlock Holmes is blushing
appeared on his arm
he confessed
(See the end of the chapter for
C. Ionization energy increases.
With an eye-roll he replied
B. The mass increases.
“JOHN WATSON!  I SWEAR TO GOD! IF YOU WON’T TURN OFF YOUR BLOODY ALARM, I’LL COME THERE MYSELF AND SMASH YOUR STUPID HEAD ON IT!!”
And when I say almost, I mean all of the subjects except chemistry
“What are you doing’?” John tried to ask between taking deep breaths, trying to calm himself down.
Well, my dear friends, he is talking about his soul mate, the one person he is meant to be with.
“Thanks…” the kid said, not meeting John’s eyes, and his voice ran another shiver through him.
So... I hope you'll enjoy it :-)
So, when he felt the itches, he knew that they have a clean canvas to start whatever they want.
“13 next week…” John heard Sherlock mumble, but that didn’t stop Mike’s enthusiasm
“I was trying to guess the password” John didn’t miss how suddenly Sherlock tensed when John said that “so I could answer whomever Texted you a dozen times in the last half an hour”
“Sherlock!”
“Oh…” was Sherlock’s answer as his blush deepened and he tried to curl into himself
This whole situation is ridiculous, this morning his plans were just to do his homework in history and afterward maybe talk Sherlock, or to catch up on Doctor Who. But then he was on his way to the playing ground that he hasn’t set his foot on for at least for ten years, to meet his soul-mate. But then he turned tail and ran away only to come across Mike, an old lad who he hadn’t talked to in years, who just happened to be back in town, who just happened to start living next door to the Holmes’s, and who just happened to be going to the same place that Sherlock just happen to be in. and now here he is, in school after hours, with his soul-mate that not even half an hour ago, was too afraid to meet, whose red in the face because his old mate is now talking about their wedding, and! Wait
He stares at the circle for a few moments before he can register that his soul mate is writing again
John is a nervous mess by the time he gets to the destined place where Sherlock told him to meet (At the playground near the school). He got there a little earlier than the time they set (they [Sherlock] said they’ll meet at 3 pm, but John arrived at half past two, just in case) and sat on the swings to wait for his soul-mate to appear.
Silence
John turned so quickly it’s a wonder that his neck didn’t break, there he saw Sherlock standing behind him, irritation is written all over his face, but John could see a little… something in his eyes
“What are you doing Johnny?” she asked as she made her way t seat beside him on the bed.
“…That’s so awesome! How long did it happen?!!! I’ve never heard of this before, that’s amazing! Do you think that we all can do it, or is it something only for the two of you? How did you discover it? How long did you two talk? Is that why you were sad before? How does it work? You two can be famous! You two would be such a cute couple! Mayb-“
he laughed
https://www.tumblr.com/blog/chipopo123
He decided to take the long route back home, the one that crossed the park, in order to try and clean his mind.
John sat there opening and closing his mouth like a fish a few times, trying to be able to control his mind
My Muse for Emma came from the amazing Dame Maggie Smith
Mike confirmed with a quick nod and with a shit eating grin.
*0o0o0*
They spent the rest of the day in the school labs together.
John!”
John Watson felt free with Sherlock Holmes.
Nothing
“Umm…”
“OMG!” he shouted and finally got their attention “Are you two soul-mate?! How is that even possible?! John, you’re 16! And Sherlock! You’re just 12!”
*0o0o0*
*0o0o0*
At the soft ‘click’ of Sherlock's door understanding fell on John and he mentally slapped himself while he walked towards Sherlocks bedroom
“Are they cute?”
“YES, MOM?!”
“Sherlock!!”
And no luck
“Just tell me one thing,” she said, suddenly serious.
“What?” he asks shyly with adorable crimson cheeks, and made eye contact with him, and… wow
The first hours were spent in quiet, Sherlock in his mind and John watching him fondly.
He thought with a smile
“Oh, for the love of... calm down, just sit there” he snapped with an annoyed tone. He sat down on a stool next to John after he finished organizing the equipment on the table.
That’s how they spent the rest of the time, with Sherlock talking animatedly about all the things he wants to discover, and with John listening with a blinding smile on his face.
, he thought grimly, going through the possible questions in his head, all the questions that he doesn’t have the answer to.
“HARRIET FENELLA WATSON! BE QUIET!! AND JOHN HAMISH WATSON!”
He thought with a giggle,
Gasping for breath, Sherlock quickly stuffed his cock back inside his underwear, and not even stopping to do up his trousers, he fled from the room as quickly and quietly as he could, pausing when he was a safe distance away to do them up properly.  He made it back to the dorm without incident, and lay down on his bed, gulping in air, trying to calm his racing heartbeat.  He was in no doubt at all now, that the attraction was mutual, and he settled himself down to solve the problem of what he could do about it.
“Of course Mark, I was planning to go for a walk anyway, won’t be too much trouble to take Jilly with me!  What do you want me to do once I’ve walked her?”
“Any idiot can diagnose them,” the rich voice sneered.  “Take the blonde in the corner.  Her problem is obviously centred on her groin, judging by the way she’s leaning in her seat with nobody next to her to talk to, she’s clearly too uncomfortable to sit normally, and the fidgeting tells its own tale.  Could be haemorrhoids, but the constant fiddling with her engagement ring and pained expression says STD, and not caught from her fiancé.”  John rounded the corner just in time to see a young blonde woman with a scarlet face rushing from the waiting room, mumbling something about coming back another time.  “As for him,” the voice continued, “from the way they were making a point of not looking at each other, he’s obviously the source of the problem.” A young man with a face a similar shade of scarlet hurried out of the waiting room, glaring at the owner of the voice.  It proved to belong to a tall, fairly young man, with dark curly hair, a boyish figure, and a pale complexion.  He was dressed in a suit, although without a tie – a wise precaution, John decided, as it would reduce the likelihood of anyone strangling him with it – and a rather ostentatious coat, open at the front, with a blue scarf encircling his neck.  Before the man had the opportunity to begin diagnosing the elderly gentleman who was also waiting to be seen, John stepped up to the desk and asked, “Is there a problem?”
He was amazed when Dr Watson dropped to his knees in front of him, taking the head of Sherlock’s rock hard cock into his mouth and beginning to slide the soft skin over the shaft once more.  His other hand dropped beneath Sherlock’s testicles, slid over his perineum to his arse, and resumed pumping in the same rhythm as before.
“I’m not wearing that, I was a soldier!” John growled, and Sherlock stuffed the next outfit over the curtain – tight pink camouflage trousers and a baby pink t-shirt with a sequinned heart over the chest.  “Sherlock,” John said, warningly.
“I’ll get Sherlock to take me in,” he said, and fumbled his phone out of his pocket.  He dialled Sherlock’s number, but it just rang, eventually flicking over to voicemail.  “Sherlock, I need you, my waters have broken, please hurry!”  He ended the call as another sharp contraction overtook him, and at the noise he made, the waitress shook her head, and called for an urgent ambulance.
“Sherlock, what the hell..?!”
“I’ve always been rather flexible,” Sherlock commented, then promptly took his cock into his mouth.  As John watched, Sherlock’s long, slender length grew hard again in his mouth, as he sucked and bobbed his head with obvious enjoyment.  Very soon he started to make the noises that John had heard coming up through his floorboards.  The noises that had driven John to decide he had to leave, and he thought fleetingly that it was strange that those same noises were currently making it impossible for him to even consider going anywhere.
John knew Molly, in that he'd met her a couple of times at the morgue, but they weren't the great friends he portrays them as in this blog.  In the same way, DI Greg Lestrade isn't a personal friend, but the family liaison officer who stayed with John when they came to tell him what had happened.
John shrugged; he couldn’t explain to Sherlock what was really going on or the man would take advantage of him mercilessly.  “I thought it would be something different to do, that’s all.”  Sherlock decided to be kind, climbing into the taxi without another word.  There would be time to wind him up later, Sherlock was sure.
“Got my eye on a nice little place in central London. Together we ought to be able to afford it.”  He continued to speak as he walked past John towards the door.  “We’ll meet there tomorrow evening; seven o’clock. Sorry – gotta dash. I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.”  He slipped the mobile phone into his pocket, and passed John on his way to the door.  The casual dismissal irritated John, and he barely kept a lid on his anger as he turned to speak to the man.
“Do you want another?” Greg asked, hoping against hope that John would say no; he knew John had a shift at the clinic early the following morning as he’d said as much.  With any luck, John would turn him down, and they could both go back to their homes and crash.
*****
“How much do you charge?  It’s Archie’s birthday next month, I’m sure he’d love to have you at his party!”  Just as John opened his mouth to reply, Sherlock stepped in.
Eighteen-hundred hours:  “So what’s the deal with Westbury then?” John asked, as they tucked into some Chinese takeaway in his office.
“First things first, I need you to produce a urine sample.”  Dr Watson handed Sherlock a specimen pot, and continued, “You’ll find a toilet two doors down on the right.”  Sherlock took himself down to the toilet, and dutifully produced his sample, wondering as he did so whether Dr Watson was reading his medical history, and if so, what he was making of it.  Sherlock finished, zipped up his trousers and returned to the doctor’s room.  “I don’t know why you’re going to all this trouble, there is nothing wrong with me, just sign the form so I can leave,” he said, calculating that the doctor would be one of those stubborn types that are determined to do everything by the book, he had that ‘boy scout’ kind of look about him.  Sure enough, Dr Watson gave him an incredulous look, and said “Mr Holmes, where did you get your medical degree?”
Unclaimed kidneys… I'm not sure how a kidney can be unclaimed, I can't imagine funeral homes turn up and take all of a body apart from the kidneys… Perhaps it's all the people who have transplants, and the ones they that aren't working are left over at the end of the surgery..?  Except they don't usually take those out…  If anyone knows how kidneys might go unclaimed, could they let me know?
"John? What is it? What's wrong?"
Look, I'm sorry for letting you all down, okay, but please, enough is enough… Shady bloke was following me round Tesco yesterday, and he was already sitting in Hart's when I went in there again this morning - if this carries on, I'll have to change my coffee shop, and I really don't want to do that because their tea is the best in the area.
want to be with you, and I’m not with another man!”  Sherlock’s eyes were pleading as he followed John into the toilet, and something about the tone of his voice gave John pause – just for a moment.
Twenty-hundred hours: With all the lads safely tucked up in their beds, John sat back in his chair, glass of whiskey in one hand, and the reader’s file in the other.  At least now he knew who the ridiculous name belonged to.  He scanned through the biographical information; Sherlock William Scott Holmes, 24.  Parents both deceased, car accident 12 years ago, raised by older brother with the even more ridiculous name of Mycroft Holmes, who was a minor official in the British Government, whatever that meant.  Educated at six, no seven different boarding schools in three years, he’d left school at the earliest possible opportunity, then come to the attention of the courts for a number of different offences; trespass, breaking and entering, and on one memorable occasion, attempted theft of a human body part from a hospital morgue.  John flicked to the reports from the various schools, without fail they said the same thing: “Sherlock is a gifted student, but is easily bored.”  “Sherlock has a brilliant analytical mind, but needs to learn to respect authority.”  “Sherlock needs more stimulation than we are able to give him.”
"What do you mean?"
[04/10, 6:01 pm] JOHN WATSON: And who are you to decide anything about Rosie?
"Yes," John hissed, "Of course."
“Mate, are you okay?” a young man asked. Sherlock only looked at him. Not John. He started to mumble, “Yes, yes, yes, yes.” And then he was off, leaving all the not-Johns standing there wondering what was wrong with him. He didn’t stop until he found a narrow alleyway with a container to hide behind. Sherlock leaned back against the container and took deep breaths. He took off his gloves and pressed his hands against the cold metal of the container. A shiver ran down his spine as he lifted his hands to his cheeks. He closed his eyes and now it was John’s warm hands holding him. Tears started to run down his face, his chest once again heaving for a breath. John’s thumb was stroking his cheekbones slowly and Sherlock felt his head being tipped down. He could feel John’s chest against his own. Warm air grazed the side of his mouth, his lip starting to quiver. And suddenly everything fell apart.
It doesn't take long for him to understand who is in the adjacent room. John.
"I need us to get over to that store. Do you think you'll manage that?"
[04/10, 6:09 pm] JOHN WATSON: Mycroft was right? And you know who else was right? Donovan!
John couldn't help the rush of adrenaline that shot up his spine as he read those words.
Sherlock had spent the whole week doing experiments. Failed experiments because he couldn't stop thinking about John. Sherlock really wanted to see him.
His hands are shackled to the ceiling. His legs are free. If only he could get out of here simply by kicking at the air.
John's expression turns cloudy with restrained anger. He says nothing.
His voice is raspy as he says, "John. John, I'm sorry. I d-didn't know they wanted…..they wanted to t-touch you after they had killed me. I would never have s-said that I wanted to die if I had known. I am, s-so sorry, John."
[04/10, 5:54 pm] JOHN WATSON: Today, you made it quite clear, that I wasn't wrong.
“Yes, it was. Almost everything is more important than your relationships John. The average time they last is about 2 to 4 weeks. Sarah’s was the longest. Anything that short lived is not worth my attention.” Sherlock huffed out a breath and picked up the laptop, idly typing out the results of his previous experiment.
Great.
He did not expect Jim Moriarty to retreat but he did expect the snipers to take the shot. They were too eager, too riled up not to do it.
Mike shrugged, "It's true. He DID get into a fight."
“I didn’t go.”
A cold, large hand jerked him out of his stupor, standing out in stark contrast to the hand Sherlock had imagined. This was certainly not John and Sherlock cursed himself for ever thinking otherwise.
[04/10, 6:26 pm] JOHN WATSON: I will certainly do better than a freak.
3th November : Nightmare
"That's none of your business." Sherlock replies curtly, trying desperately to cover up the fact that he does not remember anything after their fight.
My tumblr is @johnlock-and-merthur-4ever
Once in a blue moon, John could join Sherlock for cases. These occasions were rare and extremely valuable to Sherlock.
This chapter will be from the perspective of both Sherlock and John. Page breaks and markers will be added to avoid head hopping.
But John had been staying out for the most of the time, treating patients and helping at the clinic. Knowing that he had a child at home, he avoided any chance of physical contact with Rosie or Sherlock.
“Sherlock, you good mate?”
Sherlock set down the laptop on the coffee table and stood up too. Trying to deny it all was the only option he had left.
Sherlock glances at John. His face is calm, collected. John isn't afraid. But Sherlock is. It's slowly coming back to him now. He knows who these men are. What they're capable of. He has seen the bodies they have left behind all over London. He doesn’t want them anywhere near John.
"I rec'nized it when he inserted it." John smiled fondly at Sherlock. Sherlock smiled back and tried to walk John out of the storage room and out where Lestrade and his team would be soon.
He steels himself and examines the bullet wound himself even though the paramedics have arrived and are asking him to move out of the way; he needs to make sure Sherlock is okay.
“Are you alright Sherlock?” John asked. Sherlock ripped his arm free staring at his face in disbelief. Johns were now looking at him, getting concerned.
[04/10, 5:58 pm] JOHN WATSON: I am so grateful to you, Mr Holmes for doing everything for me from the beginning of time. But that's what we all must be, isn't it? Grateful to the great detective. Today you crossed a line, Mr Holmes and now there's no going back.
And there he was, slowly sinking to the bottom of the pool. Sherlock had only just noticed the bullet wound in John's side.
[04/10, 6:04 pm] JOHN WATSON: If you dare say anything to my girlfriend, you arsehole, that'll be it for us. You are going to quietly handover Rosie as soon as Sarah rings the bell.
Before Sherlock could take off from there, he felt the side of his head slam into the cold hard metal. He groaned and tried to stand up, but in vain. When he had managed to get onto his hands and knees, a kick to his shins prevented any chance of him getting up and going to the safety of home; to the safety of John’s hands treating his wounds.
Just as he was finishing his piece, he heard John come downstairs and set the kettle for boiling. Sherlock turned around and placed the violin carefully back in its case.
Sherlock couldn't figure out why John was taking so long. He had tried texting him of course, but the messages weren't delivered or read.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You can use my bed, I don't mind." Sherlock opened up a new paper and started reading again. As John opened his mouth to object Sherlock cocked a brow and tilted his head slightly without looking away from the paper. John closed his mouth and marched off to Sherlock's bedroom.
Not helping.
He had.
Most people in John's experience were like that. They would get upset and throw a fit if they were refused or if John turned down their advances. Most of John's relationships existed in order to prevent conflict and before he knew it, he had broken another heart. He wondered if Sherlock was going to be like the others in this respect. Because no matter how hard he tried to be an emotionless self proclaimed sociopath, deep down Sherlock was just as human as anyone else.
This chapter is based off of the previous ones. Please read them before you proceed.
[04/10, 5:52 pm] JOHN WATSON : I asked Sarah to pick up Rose.
The men hold John down. He tries to scream. Nothing comes out.
* Read at 4.35 pm *
They rounded the street corner and walked straight into a huge market. Sherlock kept on talking, walking straight into the mass of people, and didn’t notice that John was not at his side anymore. After a few steps Sherlock stopped and looked around for John. He stood by the corner, backing away from the huge market. Sherlock slowly walked over to him.
Sherlock was struck with an idea. He sneaked into John's room and discreetly borrowed one of John's jumpers. He went to sleep clutching the fabric to his chest and dreams evaded him that night.
8th November
John raised his eyebrow in surprise. “Why? Thought you said it was important. Apparently more important than my relationship.”
"If I recall correctly, the exact words in your text were, 'Your wife is creating a scene here. Prolly missing you. Come and collect.' You mentioned nothing about John getting into a fight and being in a potentially life threatening situation while inebriated. Have you no brains whatsoever. "
John gagged.
John was very rarely home. Sherlock barely had any cases.
John's eyes scanned the market, the panic creeping up on his face again. He opened his mouth but hesitated to answer.
"He's stronger than he looks, you know. I know he looks tiny, but he is a soldier," Sherlock says.
He regrets the fight they had and every goddamn text he sent. But he knows that he has already apologized for it. He had apologized to Sherlock the morning he was kidnapped.
The rain pelted heavily against the window pane. John did not know what he was feeling but "cozy" certainly wasn't it. Sarah had said it would feel cozy, warm to catch up in a blanket fort. And so they had set about making the fort. Which consisted of a measly three blankets. Neither of them had the energy to make a real fort. John burrowed under the blanket a little further, winding his arm around Sarah's shoulder when his phone started beeping. Sarah was asleep. He didn't want to wake her but it could be Sherlock. He could be in danger. John sighed and gently retrieved his arm, reaching for his phone.
John has an anxiety attack
“Oh come on John. We both know you crave the adrenaline of being with me.” He gives John a smug grin.
John didn't seem to register the words so Sherlock continued speaking. "See the guy over there?" He pointed his chin to the left, at a man looking at some old books. "He's afraid of dogs."
Tears clouded Sherlock's vision. But he typed back nevertheless.
"What about the man in the red jacket there?"
[04/10, 6:18 pm] YOU: You have to pay attention to your daughter. Promise me that you will spend at least two hours from your busy day with her. She deserves a parent John. Not someone who tries to run from his duties. -SH
John’s gaze followed Sherlock’s form as he ran down the stairs. He heard the front door bang shut and he let his hand, which was reaching out for Sherlock, fall down. John felt his head getting heavier and he stumbled backwards and sank down in a chair. The flat was completely silent except for John’s heavy breathing, his chest rising and falling in a rapid tempo. His pulse was hammering in his ear and his palms had started to sweat. A panic attack was incoming. John tried to calm his breathing before he dried his hands on his trousers. Then he returned to routine, the one thing he did best. Kettle, water, tea, mugs. Water filled, kettle on. Teabags in mugs, turn around to the fridge for milk. Warm water in mugs, seep for three minutes, remove bags. Dash of milk in one mug. As he took both mugs and walked into the living room he realized his mistake. Sherlock was gone. Forever? John didn’t know. A loud sob echoed off the walls in the small flat. His shoulders slumped and tea spilled out from the mugs staining the carpet. He placed the mugs down on the table beside his chair before sinking down to the floor, back against his own chair. Knees drawn up, he rested his face on them. Another sob escaped his lips. His bottom lip started to quiver as he leaned his head back against the chair. Small drops landed on John’s shirt and he tried to dry away the tears but more kept on coming.
"John?" Sherlock called out, his voice echoing in the emptiness. A muffled sound came from behind a storage door behind him. He walked back and listened intently with his ear to the door. Inside he heard the sound of a body rolling around. Sherlock got out his pin and started to pick the lock carefully, making sure not to break the pin. The lock clicked and Sherlock whipped up the door. Inside John lay on the floor, his arm coming up slowly to block out the light. Sherlock crouched down and checked his pulse.
The microwave beeped and Sherlock took out the popcorn. John was already sitting on the sofa, waiting for Sherlock. In his hand were two beer bottles and when Sherlock sat down he handed one to him. Sherlock took it and placed the bowl of popcorn in his lap. John came closer so their thighs were touching slightly, and reached for a handful of popcorn. He grabbed the remote and pressed play, the 20th century fox theme song beginning. Both men sat in silence, their bodies barely touching, sipping their beer and eating popcorn slowly.
Hope you enjoy!
That was all the confirmation Sherlock needed.
He did not look at Sherlock. “Tea?” John asked instead.
They're two meters away from freedom when John stops. Sherlock looks back at him in confusion and freezes in place. Five armed and masked men stand behind John, each of their guns trained on either Sherlock or John.
He decided that he would wait another hour or so before he called Mycroft.
"I know," John slurred, "I still wanna hear you talk about it." He gave Sherlock's knee a pat before putting it in his own lap. Sherlock wished he had kept it on his knee.
“Don’t!” John roared, turning around. “Can’t’ you see that it’s you?” he screamed towards Sherlock. Sherlock felt the hairs on his neck stand up and he sank down in his coat as if trying to hide from John.
"You okay there mate?" He asked.
"What have you done to my bed?" John repeated. Sherlock folded the paper and placed his hands in his lap.
Forster is talking to Sherlock in a low voice and Sherlock grows paler by the second. John can't hear him over Billy's stupid rasp. He throws him an annoyed glance and tries to say, "Shut the fuck up you stupid pumpkin," But it comes out as garbled nonsense.
John picked at his nails, staring at the skull on the mantelpiece and willing Sherlock to come back. Their next confrontation was bound to be awkward and stilted but he could swallow down the discomfort as long as Sherlock was safe.
"You don't look okay," he said, taking a sip from his own drink. Mike had barely finished two glasses.
After the pool, John had shown a certain….proclivity towards physical affection. But in the past week, he had started dating which meant Sherlock couldn't touch or even look at him without feeling guilty.
[04/10, 5:54 pm] JOHN WATSON: I know my family makes your life miserable, and that's why I had been thinking of getting out of your hair.
Sherlock stood frozen in place, the memories of drunken sex and forced blowjobs in narrow alleyways rendering him motionless. His body had frozen up, but he could hear the man talking. He was saying something, if only Sherlock could focus for once if he could just focus. "...... 're not Jim" and "my Jim isn't here" filtered through the fog in his brain. The name sent shivers down his spine.
John walked into the kitchen and started to brew tea. Sherlock looked up from the newspaper and raised his brow.
"John, I need you to breathe slow and steady, okay?" Sherlock squeezed John's arms. Together they took a few breaths, John getting his breathing under control.
He groaned in frustration and picked up the violin. These emotions had to be let out. He started playing, his back to John, pouring his heart out in the notes that flowed from his fingers, willing John to understand somehow. Music had always easier than talking about his feelings.
A continuation of 3. nightmare but can be read alone too
Note: since it's whumptober season, my other fic is on hold for now. Apologies.❤
“I did, I just chose to ignore it.” John took a sip from his tea. Sherlock frowned.
Sherlock was about to press call when his phone rang. "John," Sherlock breathed a sigh of relief and answered immediately.
It had been 48 hours since John had last seen Sherlock. Every time he picked up his phone to either ring or text Sherlock, the thought of Sherlock needing some space, a little time to himself stopped him.
John looked at Sherlock and opened his mouth to say something. He closed it and turned back to the movie, but when Sherlock started to move again he spoke.
From the back of the room came a soft little thud. John turned his head and looked to the corner behind Sherlock’s chair. Sherlock’s violin bow had fallen down from where it had been balanced by the wall. It wasn’t like Sherlock to keep his bow like that. Slowly John got up and went over to the bow. Carefully he picked it up and put it in the case. Hopefully he placed it right. Inside lay the violin, silently and almost dead now that Sherlock wasn’t holding it under his chin. Hesitantly he touched the woodwork, cautious fingers gliding over the strings. G, D, A, E, Sherlock had once told him. John didn’t know what that meant. A slow tear ran down John’s nose and down on the body of the violin. He pulled his jumper down over his hand and hurriedly dried away the tear, afraid it would leave a mark. Afraid of ruining the violin John closed the case and sat down in Sherlock’s chair. He let the black chair engulf him as he pulled up his legs and rested his head on the armrest. He closed his eyes and listened to his breathing. Faint violin sounds started playing, one of Sherlock's favorite pieces. John could see the furrow in his brow in every crescendo, followed by a softening look in every diminuendo. His arm stroking the bow over the strings, loose wrist, fingers running over the neck, steady and gracefully. At one place the music stopped, a sigh, and then played again, the sound a little different as Sherlock fixed his mistake. John hummed in one with the melody in his head, sometimes interrupted by a sob.
Sherlock could not fathom why John had been so upset. He had only just told him the truth. It could have been dangerous. No amount of precautions could really prepare one for the disastrous events that seemed to happen at Barts.
On the third day, John could not  wait anymore. He dialed Mycroft and when he answered, John told him to look for his brother and hung up quickly. He feared that if Mycroft asked for the details, which he was going to soon, he would have to tell the older man all about his brother and how John had broken his heart.
(See the end of the chapter for
He did not know what he was feeling.
When John forced him to go to bed, Sherlock was relieved but also dismayed. He did not want to sleep.
"Okay, well, now that I'm here, you don't need to be worried about being bored. Let's go." He undoes Sherlock's shackles and they step out of the small cell. The light bulb outside blinds him for a second and he stands there, eyes closed against it.
Feel free to leave us a kudos and a comment. They really make our day better <3
Sherlock and John both crave physical touch and cuddles. Neither are willing to ask.
John started to relax more, so Sherlock took John's hand and started to lead him through the masses of people.
[04/10, 5:56 pm] YOU: And don't worry about Rosie.-SH
[04/10, 5:55 pm] YOU: Don't. Just don't throw that at me now. Not after I've done everything under the Sun for you and your family. Rosie is with me.- SH
Sarah grunted and sat up, probably feeling the lack of warmth. She blinked at John, her expression confused but as she looked him up and down, realization dawned in her eyes.
He looked at his phone once again, waiting. When it buzzed next, the number which appeared on the screen was not one John was expecting.
"I g't drugged," John mumbled. Sherlock opened John's eyes, watching the pupils dilate. "It's jus a sed'tive," John continued. Sherlock chuckled as he tried to pull John up.
Sherlock struggles against his chains as John's screams hit his eardrums.
"See that store over there? The antique one?" Sherlock dropped a hand and pointed towards the other side of the street, one block down. John nodded again, the fear in his eyes subsiding a little.
"He called didn't he." Her voice wasn't cold. It was routine, ordinary. To an outsider she would look like the news didn't matter to her.
“You’re right,” John said calmly, “you just forgot about the small tea stain over here-” John pointed at the small table his cup stood on, “-’cause my hand shook when I put the tea down.” John raised an eyebrow and gave Sherlock a look to tell him to move out of the way. He stood up and waited for Sherlock to move. He didn’t.
Sherlock reached the bottom of the staircase and bumped into-
[04/10, 5:55 pm] JOHN WATSON: I should have known from the very beginning.
"You know bloody well what I mean." John turned and leaned back on the kitchen counter. "I can't sleep now!"
He had to forcefully stopped his thoughts from going in that direction. John was just a friend. That's all he was.
John grunted and called for another.
John closed his eyes and slumped against Sherlock, feeling rather smug that he had, in fact, gotten to cuddle Sherlock, even if it was for just a little while.
It did not matter anymore. John knew.
“Woohoo, boys!” John leapt up immediately, calling Jilly, and shoving her unceremoniously into Sherlock’s bedroom.
“Not a word.” Mike grinned back at John, he was obviously enjoying this.
“What happened to the lipstick?”  Ahh, there was the kicker, John thought.  He’d been waiting for one, it turned out to be that the gorgeous man wasn’t into male Omegas, but petite female Betas.
John looked over at Sherlock with tears in his eyes.  “Please, Sherlock, I need your knot, just this one time! Please help me!”
John sat in his armchair, the book open in one hand, a cup of cold tea in the other.  Sherlock had been gone for hours, muttering something about a sample of thighs that Molly was holding for him.  John knew he was conducting an experiment on the effects of cold temperatures on the muscle – the freezer in the flat was too small for the number of thighs Molly had for him, so he had decamped to Bart’s.
“I have to get back up there, Greg,” he gabbled, and ran in the direction of the maternity unit once more.
“John, your journal!”  John spun around, seeing that the journal had finally caught alight, and was burning merrily on the carpet next to the hearthstone.  He rushed over, stamping on the journal to put out the flames, then grabbing it up off the floor to examine the damage to the carpet.  Luckily the flames hadn’t penetrated the entire journal, and the carpet was only a bit sooty.  He made a mental note to get some carpet cleaner next time he went to Tesco, threw the journal into the basket of firewood – it was beyond repair, and he would have to see if he could borrow Sarah’s copy to finish reading the article – and turned back to Sherlock… who was no longer there.  The faint slam of his bedroom door told John where he had gone, but he had no idea why.
“You have no idea what it took to get this right,” he grumbled, and manhandled John to sit down on the pillows at the far side of the bed.  Sherlock lay down, with his head on the other pillow, then the next thing John knew, he was curled up with his legs right over his head, knees on the wooden rail of the bedhead, and feet resting against the wall, as though doing some strange variation on the yoga position The Plough.
“Greg?” he asked, in a sleepy voice.  He sat up carefully, supporting Xander’s head, eyes flicking to the file Greg held in his hand.
“Oh yeah, I know Anderson, he’s a bit of a dick by all accounts.”  Sherlock raised his eyebrows; John was such a stickler for professionalism that Anderson must be bad if John had used that kind of language.
The next few weeks were very difficult for Sherlock.  Alexander was judged to be well enough to go home on the fourth day and since John and Sherlock had decided to bottle feed, there was no need for him to stay in the hospital with John.  John, on the other hand, was still too unwell to be discharged; going through the birth without Sherlock, his Alpha, had taken its toll on John.  Sherlock took baby Xander home, and muddled through as best as he could.  They had discussed how they wanted to raise their baby over the long months of John’s pregnancy, but Sherlock decided very quickly that routine could wait until Xander had two parents at home to implement it.
As the piece came to an end John's face was wet on one side, and his shoulder had cramped up. Yet he refused to move. He closed his eyes, a single tear running down to his ear, before quietly falling asleep.
Another hour passed with no phone calls or texts from John.
"Let's go," he said low, smiling softly. John smiled back weakly and felt Sherlock put his hand on his lower back hesitantly. John could finally relax, after a three day long chase around London.
The man was ruthless. Sherlock blacked out.
Sherlock's eyes close as the anesthesia is administered.
Forster has stopped talking. John thinks it's his imagination but Sherlock looks green in the face. "You have made your choice, Mr Holmes." Forster smiles blandly.
What little hope Sherlock had had of John accepting his feelings and reciprocating them, flickered out. He was being made fun of.
As he was about to fall asleep he heard silent footsteps enter and the bed sank down with Sherlock's weight. Soft light was coming from the laptop on Sherlock's lap, but it didn't bother John. He closed his eyes, leaned towards the body beside him, and fell asleep to the sound of Sherlock's fingers clicking away on the keyboard.
"See John? It's nothing to worry about. I will make sure nothing happens to you," Sherlock comforted.
Four minutes, two punches and a kick to the abdomen later, the man, whoever he was, had been subdued. John was currently twisting his hand behind his back, his knee between the man's shoulder blades.
When Molly told him about how she had found Sherlock, his body bruised and battered, John's first reaction was not anger or hurt or sympathy, even though those were certainly on the list. His first reaction was flight. He did not know whether he wanted to run from or toward Sherlock. The confusion that clouded his mind did not go away until he found himself standing before Bart's, the hospital looming in front of him. In a dazed stupor, he carried himself inside, enquiring in a flat voice about the whereabouts of Sherlock Holmes.
“It’s your fault.” He swallowed hard. He distanced himself from Sherlock, but Sherlock kept his hands on his shoulders. Sherlock looked at John’s face but John only stared back, his face devoid empty. His eyes started to water. Sherlock opened his mouth to speak but nothing came out. John ripped himself free from Sherlock’s grip.
He picked up his violin. It was only three o’clock in the morning, but Sherlock was sure John wouldn’t mind if he played now.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock spoils John's plan of fixing things with Sarah.
John smiled, but there was nothing happy about the expression. “Do you really want me to spell it out for you? Does the genius detective not see something so obvious?”
The next words out of the man's mouth were words that insulted Sherlock. John did not know or understand the context, he was too drunk for that; but he did know that it was something bad, something to do with a case and something about Sherlock. He forced himself to keep his eyes open and let his military training take over his body.
Sherlock groans and tries to open his eyes. The slight effort sets his forehead on fire and the thick coating of blood on the left side of his head refuses to let his left eye open fully.
John knows.
John couldn't hold himself upright anymore. He lost his balance which wasn't very steady in the first place, thanks to the alcohol consumption. Sherlock's arms caught him before he crashed to the ground and John relaxed into the steady, inviting heat of his embrace.
[04/10, 6:03 pm] YOU: Unlike you, I'm someone who cares about her. You take her away yourself or Sarah will come to you crying, I promise. -SH
"Came to take you back home. And can you not shout?" John says, as he starts working at the shackles, careful of the raw, bleeding skin around Sherlock's wrists. "How in the fuck did you manage to get here?" John asks.
6th November
"Don't bother." Sarah said coldly.
Regards,
John was stirring his tea, back ramrod straight. Sherlock could almost taste the tension rippling off of him.
Sherlock’s face fell and he carefully moved towards John, hesitantly reaching out to him. John let him. He took hold of John’s shoulders and slowly pushed him against his chest. John’s arms hung limp by his sides. He raised his head and looked up at Sherlock with blank eyes.
"Hey."
"NO!" He yelled, trying to get away from the man.
Molly.

He went back to Baker Street, having forgotten all about the crime scene. He quietly thanked Mrs Hudson and took Rosie with him upstairs. Just as he was murmuring soothing nonsense to the little girl to make her fall asleep, his phone pinged with a new text.
Athena.
Sherlock played for a long time before everything was silent.
Sherlock looked up, his hair like a halo around his head. The light in the flat was low and it was hard to see Sherlock’s eyes, but Sherlock stared intently into John’s. They looked at each other, their eyes glowing, before Sherlock turned around and laid his head in John's lap. He pulled the blanket tight around his shoulders, his feet dangling off the sofa. John carefully laid a hand in the nape of Sherlock's neck. As the film came to an end Sherlock had fallen asleep, mumbling softly as John ran a hand through his curls.
"Yes it was."
5th November: Cuddling
2th November: First Night
Sherlock did not deserve him. He had no right to even think of touching him. Let alone think of cuddling him.
Sorry guys, it gets better <3
"John?" Sherlock whispered, "Wha-?"
Sherlock took a deep breath. "What the fuck."
People hurried past him, a knitted sweater over a shirt, grey hair slicked back, short, muscular thighs visible through jeans, a strong jaw biting into a burrito, blue eyes looking at clothes, sturdy hands holding mobile phones, John, John, John John John everywhere. Sherlock’s eyes were roaming through the masses of people, everywhere searching for a little part of John. Fingers pulling his own hair with a grunt of frustration. Nobody seemed to notice the distressed man. He stopped, turned around, walked another way.
"If I'm correct about the shoes, which I know I am," Sherlock said confidently, "the murderer is the shop owner."
“No, thank you.”
Several things happen at once in the next few seconds.
A few minutes later John started thrashing around. Sherlock froze, his eyes still staring into the microscope, unseeing. The nightmare didn't seem to stop. After a minute Sherlock rose and walked up the stairs. He stood by the door, his ear against it. John was still twisting and turning so Sherlock opened the door and peeked inside. John's sheet was twisted around his legs and his t-shirt was wet around the collar and arms. Sherlock stood still for a moment before taking off his dressing gown and laying it on a chair by John's desk. He walked over to the other side of the bed and gently lowered himself down, his back against the headboard. John was breathing heavily and his hand shook a little. Sherlock closed in, keeping his distance but close enough for John to feel his presence. As John felt the warmth from Sherlock's body he started to calm down. His breathing got more stable and the kicking stopped but his hand was still shaking. Sherlock reached down and pulled the sheet up over them both. After a few minutes the tremor stopped and Sherlock pulled up a medical magazine from John's nightstand. He opened the magazine and started reading as John slowly fell into deep sleep.
Two weeks in, Sherlock had realised that John was staying at the doctor's housing while giving an excuse for overtime. When he had asked John about it, John had said that he expected Sherlock to understand his concern. Sherlock did and said nothing.
Now that he is free, John wastes no time in spitting out the gag and rushes over to Sherlock's chair.
A pang of loneliness crept up on him as he looked at them. One of them had a dog and worked as a strip dancer in a gay bar. The other man was a writer. Sherlock wondered briefly what their story was, how they had met. He wondered if they felt the same adrenaline rush that he did when he was with John-
John took the coat down from the hanger, and put it on. He was out the door and had stepped into the rain when he had realised he had forgotten the umbrella.
The small comforting hand on his arm brought him back somewhat but he still hadn't come back to himself. Someone handed him a glass of water, which he gulped down immediately. Perhaps too fast because the coughing fit that followed after, took him back again. His mind's eye showed him things he never wanted to see.  Sherlock was being waterboarded as John screamed. Sherlock being held down in the pool, thrashing helplessly. Sherlock as the battered victim of war that John had tried to treat in Afghanistan. He hadn't been able to save him. He wouldn't be able to save Sherlock either.
He put the phone down.
He glanced at John who was staring at the couple too, with something akin to what Sherlock was feeling. Their eyes met for a brief second before Sherlock turned away.
