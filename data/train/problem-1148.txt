"Me too.  I really miss them from when I was a kid.  Only thing to like about Good Friday.  My name's Pete.  Pete Gutteridge."
Sherlock cautiously picked his way forward, and dragged the gray armchair all the way back into the corner he had previously been standing in, all the while keeping an eye on the other people in the room.  Then he took his left arm out of his greatcoat sleeve, and out of his jacket sleeve, and sat down in the chair with his coat still halfway on.  He rolled up his left sleeve and looked at John.
There was a little tapping noise, and the glints came into focus in Sherlock's head.  The glints were from little panes of glass sliding across the lawn and rotating around each other.  It was a sight he had never seen before, and probably bad, if he had to guess.
After managing to choke down the rest of the pepper rum, and being fed a handful of pistachios for some reason, Sherlock managed to finally get away from the store.  It must have been a case of mistaken identity.
He worked silently, keeping an ear out for the very quiet tap of glass on the marble flooring.  He waited for several minutes, silently, until he heard the tap.  He could just barely see a reflection of the hallway in the marble wall at the end of the niche.
This was not how John had expected to spend his Monday morning.  He had called the clinic and said he'd had a break-in, which was true enough, but there was no way to concisely convey the strangeness of the situation.
Eventually he got around all the freeways and got into the airport.  Sorely tempting as jumping over the freeway sounded, that would surely draw attention, maybe even make the news somehow, if someone had a dashcam.
Sherlock had only a moment to feel triumphant before he felt the mark burning off his skin.  That definitely was more painful than any of the other marks had been.  Some of them he hadn't felt at all.  He thought he had heard some saying somewhere about the Prince of Darkness being a gentleman, but this seemed like the sorest loser of sore losers.  Sherlock twisted around as his skin burned.
Sherlock's foot kicked into the curb, and he held his hands a little further out for balance as he came to a stop.  He lifted his foot up behind him, and stepped up onto the grass.
"John, is everything alright up here?"  Mrs Hudson opened the door to the front room and put her head in.  "Oh!  Oh oh oh!"  She held her hand to her chest.  Sherlock stood up off the floor and moved towards her, and she backed up until she hit the door frame.
Except that there was something that seemed off to Sherlock. John had been more distracted and absent-minded lately, to the point that a single message had caused John to abandon the stew he'd been making and disappear from the flat for hours. When he'd come back, he'd made some floppy excuse about important papers at the clinic and Sherlock had let it slide, even if it still bothered him. He trusted John, after all.
Or just one word, to be exact. "Hi." He already knew it was most likely a man's handwriting, possibly left-handed. But that was it, there was nothing more one messy word could tell him and he had sworn himself not to get involved or he would probably just die sooner.
Continuing the massage, John considered his plan once more. He wasn’t still completely sure if interfering with Sherlock's dancing was a good idea, the brunet was always defensive about his hobby.
“Of course I want to hang it here,” he said, smiling and taking the plastic decoration, looking at it. “We should have them all over the flat, so I’d have an excuse to kiss you more often. Well, I don’t really need an excuse, do I?” he asked, grinning widely and leaning in. Sherlock blinked and then smiled, meeting John in the middle and kissing him softly.
Especially Afghanistan had been a wrong move. It could've been alright had he just been a soldier, but working as an army doctor resulted in learning all the obscure places where the Words could be on the human body. Seeing so many people die made John worry about his own life. He had never thought that he would actually die, but seeing a boy half his age getting shot in front of him... They had been talking just a few days before, and even though the gun shot had torn the skin, John could remember the words that had been there.
"Fuck, no. Bloody brilliant, don't you dare to stop," John mumbled, wiggling his lower body at Sherlock. The brunet continued, repeating the process from John's neck to his toes a few more times with a bit more pressure before stopping.
Sherlock blushed very lightly and rocked back on his heels. “Well, you can help me out here, but most of the work is already done. So, um… yes?” he mumbled, nodding towards the bowls.
"Yeah. It was Afghanistan by the way, amazing that you can do that." John extended his hand and the detective quickly reached to shake it. To his astonishment, Sherlock noticed his hand was shaking slightly. He thought about pulling his hand back before John could notice, but then his hand was touching John’s warm and calloused hand and he almost didn’t want to ever let go, emotions be damned.
“Sherlock?” he called out, walking to the kitchen, where Sherlock was cleaning up one of his experiments, dressed in one of his immaculate suits and the damn purple shirt. John stopped on his tracks, licking his lips and swallowing.
“W-what?” The blonde man’s voice was small and he looked extremely shocked now. Temper now rapidly subsiding, Sherlock actually felt he should say something, probably apologise. He took a quick breath. “I’m sorry, it’s just – “
When the angel lifted the glass to his lips and took a sip, leaning his head further back and letting out a satisfied moan, Crowley felt his own trousers get tight, and he doubled his efforts. It took no time at all, the whole situation rather new and exciting, and in what felt merely seconds Aziraphale was coming, his free hand now gripping Crowley's hair rather tightly and guiding his head. Crowley had managed to slither a hand down his own pants, and the taste of the angel's come sent him over the edge. "Oh, God," Aziraphale mumbled, sounding quite out of breath. Crowley pulled back, grimacing as he pulled his hand out of his jeans. "Mmh, no. It was all me."
“Yes, they do…” Sherlock nodded, turning to look at John, smiling down at him. “There’s a lot of decorations for the tree, but we’ll get to that later,” he said, dropping a shy kiss to John’s forehead before fetching a dark red strand of tinsel and what looked like a batch of herbs.
Yesterday had been sunny, still full of summer, but today the blonde boy had woken up to the sound of heavy rain pounding on the south-facing window.
John cut him off with a kiss, sitting down on the bed and tugging Sherlock into his lap. He let his hands wander up and down Sherlock’s thighs and sides for a good while, sucking on his lower lip gently. When they broke the kiss, both of them were breathing heavily, with John’s hand on Sherlock’s hips.
Sherlock accepted the gift with a shrug and carried the box to his experiment cupboard right away. Then he got back to the living room, wringing his hands nervously. “John?”
He smiled fondly at the smaller children when they jumped and leaped around the tree and clapped after the snowflakes finished the first act with particularly impressive leaps and twirls. Since Mrs Hudson had decided not to have an interval, John kept clapping until the second act began shortly. Occasionally when his turn came, Sherlock leaped through the stage with a string of other miscellaneous candies. John clapped shortly after each time, smiling fondly to himself.
“But I want to get you something,” John said, frowning at him over his cup of coffee. But Sherlock just shook his head.
Crowley needed no further encouragement. He leaned in and nuzzled his nose against Aziraphale's already stirring cock while he unbuttoned his trousers, slowly inching them down. With better access, Crowley started mouthing at the bulge through the angel's ridiculous tartan boxer shorts.
John was still amazed by the clean fridge when he made breakfast the next morning, smiling at the now neat veggie drawer and the actually really cute multicoloured containers that were meant for storing the leftovers (in the red and yellow ones) and Sherlock’s “essential experiment materials” (in the green and blue containers).
That day’s surprise was ‘Christmas dinner preparations’, which meant baking and cooking and preparing ingredients for tomorrow’s party appetizers and tasting a few different versions of mulled wine to see which one was the best. Sherlock got clingy when tipsy, and after that they barely got anything done when Sherlock demanded they cuddle on the sofa for hours.
The DI took a quick look at the room where his team was working. "Uh, yeah he does. And luckily it keeps him busy. Even Mycroft's worried whenever Sherlock gets too bored."
Sherlock followed suit and pulled out a ball of fairy lights that were all tangled up. John chuckled and wrapped the tinsel around Sherlock’s neck and pulled him to the sofa, where they spent a good while untangling the lights and giggling.
"John, yes. I love you." He was already out of breath and moaning his name. "Could we try this with - with clothes on? It's not so... overwhelming."
Of course that didn’t last. Now that his job was to observe and deduce people, it became obvious that there was a limit to his abilities. He couldn't figure out what people's Words were. Even though he knew how common some phrases were, he couldn’t even get them right. Sometimes it could have helped to find the culprit but Sherlock just couldn’t. And still feeling a jolt of unexplainable unease whenever hearing someone say hi was slightly more than distracting. Yes, he felt infinitely alive with the thrill of the chase and the threat of a serial killer, and never felt like lapsing when there was a good murder to solve. Still, it took less than two years before Lestrade came to pester him with a case barely a four – that he had been refusing for a week already – to find him lying on the floor of his filthy flat.
“You made oatmeal as today’s surprise?” John asked, frowning as he pulled the card out. It said ‘Sherlock’s Day’ in big letters.
Sherlock opened his mouth obediently - John tried to ignore the pressure on his trousers, he was almost half-hard already - and John gave him the final spoonful. Sherlock tasted, swallowed and then froze.
He somehow knew this winter would be harder than the last few, but right now he wanted to forget it all. And railway stations always made John happy in a funny way, even though he didn't really remember anything about trains anymore. It was old data anyway.
"Definitely drunk," John thought to himself as he explored the inside of Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock ran his hands all over John's chest, but John refrained from going further. Even kissing like this was still quite new for Sherlock, and being drunk as he was, things started to slow down quite soon.
“Git,” John chuckled fondly, starting to peel the vegetables and then frying them on the pan while the rice boiled. “How did I ever survive without you…” he mumbled, seasoning the vegetables with salt and soy sauce.
Sherlock watched John shrug and talk as he thought. A hand gun, shot from across the street. The shooter had known what they were doing, hands extremely steady; experienced, accustomed to violence. But they waited until Sherlock had been in immediate danger, so strong moral principles. Strong nerves, perhaps military… Sherlock’s attention was caught by John’s right hand as he was explaining something.
"I guess I just am more of a summer person, the cold weather just wasn't appealing to me so I used to stay in and read," John swung his hand in the air and shrugged. Sherlock's eyebrows were frowned and his nose crinkled adorably.
When the case was finally solved, they ate homemade pizza with Mrs Hudson and then settled to the living room, Sherlock on his chair and John sprawled on the sofa. After a few moments Sherlock got up and fetched an envelope from the desk, tossing it onto John’s chest before disappearing into the bathroom.
"Um, just let me know if I'm too rough, or well..." Sherlock mumbled, and then John heard the massage oil bottle open. Soon he felt Sherlock's oily hands spread the oil on his back, warming up the muscles with slow, long pulls. Sherlock worked down John's backside, from his neck to his ankles, first slowly and then with more force and tempo, which caused John to make a few joyful noises.
Christmas day dawned, the air was brisk and there was a thin layer of snow covering the ground. Sherlock woke up before John and slid out of bed, brushing his teeth and heading to the kitchen to make tea. As he arranged the gingerbreads on a plate, he heard muffled footsteps and then strong arms hugged him from the behind.
“I’m not wearing that!” John protested, staring at the clothes while Sherlock started changing, leaving his coat and the suit in the cabinet and pulling on his dance belt, a pair of nude tights and a leotard that was the same shade of nude. “Come on John, there’ll only be the two of us. And we need to get going, this place’s going to be flooded with dancers in a few hours.”
"Oh God Sherlock. I want to make you feel so good." It was suddenly much harder to think, but there was something he wanted to try. "But if at any point you feel like stopping, just say 'red', okay?" Maybe having a safeword would make Sherlock feel more confident. Sherlock nodded at that.
Sherlock arrived as if in haste, almost slamming the door and then swishing his coat off, throwing his dance bag on the desk.
John read the card, glancing back at Sherlock in surprise and amusement. “’Warm jumpers, one tolerable and one hideous’ What does ‘hideous’ mean, exactly?” He asked, shaking his head fondly.
They had quite a lot of fun in the end, trying some basic moves and tactics before putting up a small game.
Sherlock giggled, pressing a kiss to John's chest and sighing happily. After a while he shifted again, looking at John. “You read the card, right?” He asked, sounding slightly nervous.
The initial lack of medical concern did make him feel a bit bad, but well, after the horrible moldy liver incident from the very same morning, John wasn’t sure if there was some sort of karma at work. It was the day before Christmas Eve and Sherlock had been actively sabotaging John’s attempts at making a Christmas dinner for them, running to a case when John tried to plan the cookings and spreading his experiments all over the kitchen. The latest episode with the liver had ruined the roast that John “had been bound to burn in the oven anyways” as Sherlock had stated. John knew the brunet wasn’t doing it on purpose, but he couldn’t help the sour mood that had somehow clouded 221b for a while now.
"But I was right here." Sherlock' voice was soft and so small. John immediately turned on his heels and went to sit next to the brunette man.
After dividing the scramble to two plates and fixing two cups of tea, John brought them to the living room where Sherlock seemed to be still doing whatever he did. John waited for a while but when the food started to go cold he cleared his throat and told Sherlock to eat.
“I’ll feed you up. Tomorrow the table, then?” John laughed, starting to make breakfast for them both.
Sherlock's face melted to a smug, warm smile at the surprise surely clear on John's face. Maybe the brunette was going to say something, but the "amazing" that escaped John's mouth again seemed to render the man quiet like it did before.
John had trouble moving around at first, and he had to grip the edge of the rink every few metres while Sherlock glided gracefully next to him and tried to give him advice. After a while, John got the gist of it, and he could grab Sherlock's hand instead.
“Mistletoe,” the detective smiled, lifting the bundle for John to see. “Well, a plastic one, but the idea’s the same… Well, not that we have to hang it here, if you’d rather not to,” he rambled, twirling it in his hands. John smiled fondly and pulled Sherlock closer, pressing finger onto Sherlock’s lips.
"And it was celery in that soup," he practically whined and slumped against the doctor. "It said water chestnut. Celery, John!"
"No, it's... I don't know. It's not like I’d get a lead part or even close anyways yet, but... I'd have to audition," he mumbled. "Probably just to become a dancing candy, John.”
"Three actually; it's a three-patch problem. Could you send a text, the number's on the desk," he mumbled, waving his hand on the direction of the cluttered desk. John got up and found a nametag on top of a wobbly pile of what seemed to be hand-written notes of scientific data.
. You should do something about your knees, Anderson must have quite a lot of gravel on his floors. Good evening." With that, the doctor headed for the main road, the limp easier to ignore for now.
And the way Mrs. Hudson nodded at him approvingly on the next lesson made him grin widely on the inside, however hard he tried to stay neutral. He had had no idea dancing – really dancing – could make him so happy, from the actual dancing to everything related to it.
He cringed inwardly at his sceptic-sounding tone, but if Sherlock got offended he hid it well on the nod of his head, and John quickly rushed to amend his words. "I mean, I'm not saying this isn't the most exciting thing to happen to me in a long while, but is this like your job or something? The police don't consult amateurs."
Molly just sighed and bit her lip before shaking her head. “Well, alright, alright. But you’ll be the one to tell Greg,” she muttered. “And you’ll owe me one.”
When Sherlock came to find him after his part was done, he frowned and tilted his head a little. “What are you smirking about like that?”
"Sherlock's brother, he's my, uh, my soulmate." The DI blushed slightly at that and John's surprised face probably didn't help. "Sherlock's got a brother? Is he like Sherlock or...?"
John grinned, taking Sherlock’s hand as they got into a cab. They went to see the Carnaby Christmas lights and then started shopping. The masses of people made them both a little impatient to get it all done quickly, but they still managed to find some gifts for Mrs Hudson, Lestrade, Molly and a few other people. Sherlock even found something that he deemed useful enough to give to Mycroft.
“Why did you buy one of these now?” John prompted, folding the piece of clothing carefully and leaving it on the coffee table.
As soon they reached the flat, Sherlock practically threw his coat on the rack and then rushed out of the flat. John frowned as he took off his own coat, hanging it on and trying to figure out what Sherlock was up to, since he was making quite a racket.
“John, you do know that one of your new forwards is going to break his knees, don’t you?” Sherlock noted as they were waiting for the bus after John’s rugby practice.
They returned the dog and then ate warm sandwiches at some tiny sandwich bar, which Sherlock claimed wasn’t exactly a part of the day’s theme (“but you get so cranky when you’re hungry, and worried when I don’t eat”).
Ignoring the chiding "Sherlock!" the brunette hustled out. John called an amused apology and rushed to follow. Sherlock somehow caught a taxi immediately and they got in. After John gave his address, Sherlock dug out his phone and turned to face John. “Take out your phone.”
“I doubt you’d serve time for this but keep the gun hidden for a while to avoid any trouble. I’m sure Angelo has kept your cane there, we can go and fetch it today. But now I need to sort out my mind palace.”
’?” He scoffed but picked up the fork and took a few bites. John ate his portion and watched Sherlock sip his tea.
"Yes, love, whatever feels good." John couldn't help bringing his own pelvis up a few times when Sherlock continued his ministrations.
Luckily, the shorter man didn't seem to be put off. "If it has anything to do with that thing you can do, I could come with you." Sherlock almost felt like smiling, but just then the door opened, and a grey head appeared.
Sherlock paid seemingly no attention to the festive decorations as he worked to solve the case, but as they left the Yard John saw him cast an assessing look on the dark green tinsel that was hanging over the break room doorway with cute little red bows on the corners.
Again, John just pulled Sherlock to his chest and hugged him tight. “We’re all broken, Sherlock. You’re not going to ‘push me away’, I love you too much. And I already know how you can be on your worst." He felt the wetness of Sherlock's tears on his shoulder.
John looked at him and grinned fondly. “You silly bee, of course I do,” he chuckled, wrapping an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders. Sherlock just rolled his eyes, blushing so lightly that only John could notice the difference. He smiled to himself and leaned into Sherlock as the bus wobbled on.
"Very good, Sherlock," John praised as he gave Sherlock a sip of water to wash off the taste of wine. "Just a few left."
When they got there, Sherlock led them through the crowds, and suddenly John realised where they were going and looked at Sherlock with a frown. "You're taking me ice-skating?" He asked, definitely surprised. Sherlock looked at him and then grinned, pulling an envelope from one of his coat pockets.
"No, I was just... You don't have a boyfriend, okay. That’s fine, it's all fine, whatever shakes your... boat. I'm gonna shut up now."
That day’s card said ‘Christmas-scented bath’ and John was again baffled by how Sherlock had known John would be in need of a relaxing bath on just that day.
The detective moans and snaps the laptop shut, standing up. Immediately, John pushes the chair back and comes to stand right behind him, sneaking his hands to Sherlock's front and undoing his trousers, sliding them down to mid-thigh.
There were planters around the building meant to look like dry-laid stone walls.  The planters were filled with some sort of strange black grass or sedge, something like that, but it was still pliable-looking and shiny, so it was still being watered.  It was all very monochromatically artistic.
He worked his way along the hallway, step by clanging step.  He still heard no one else at all.  All the rooms off the hallway were open, and each was empty, unless demons were awfully small things.  If that was so, his demon-retrieval instructions had been extremely lacking.
Some very shiny black shoes appeared just at the edge of Sherlock's peripheral vision.  He looked up, and there was an American Marine in full dress uniform, with a drawn sword.  But then again, that wasn't a Marine.  He was strange looking, like the man in the suit.  He was so reflective.  His hat and gloves and belt were as white as lightning.  And all the metal fittings of his dress uniform were impossible to look at.  Sherlock's eyes watered.
He had supposed she would always be there.  And she wasn't even murdered.  There was no one to chase down and catch for having done it.  The only guilty party was time.
"Oh, that's all modern faux-antique trash.  I don't know why I got it."  He looked down at his arm and saw that he appeared to have a blue aura around his arm, actually around every part of his body he could see.
Sherlock ducked his head down for another breath.  He rammed again.  The window flexed a little, and he wobbled on his feet.  It all came flooding back to him, that sound of John on the phone crying out to him.  He ducked down again to breathe for a moment.  Sooner or later, Mackler was going to start moving, or the floor would cave in.
Sherlock set out again from the front of the church.  Maybe he should've taken the priest's offer of a bus pass.  Well, too late now.  He thought his coat seemed a little lighter, so at least some of the saltwater had evaporated.  At least he hadn't swallowed any seawater.  What was the last thing he had drunk?  The pepper rum?  He didn't feel thirsty, and he hadn't passed out recently.  If John was here, he could've reminded him when it was teatime.  This had to be John's fault somehow.  If he had just stayed where he was put, and not come rushing back to St Bart's...Sherlock sighed.  Well, if he caught demons at the same rate, it would only be 224 more days until he saw John again.
Further down the beach, a woman was walking along the beach with a black plastic bag, bending down and picking things up every so often.  She wore an off-white knit hat and a blue, puffy coat, 30 years out of date.  He supposed he might as well walk in that direction.  She might've seen something.
Well, time to grab the bull by the horns.  Sherlock strode up, reached down, and grabbed one of the panes of glass.
"Well, better safe than sorry," she said.  That didn't seem to follow at all.  Who, exactly did she think he was?  Someone who wanted protection money?  Did Americans who wanted protection money often speak of demons?  None had done so when he was in Florida.
Now that that was arranged, Sherlock set off to quarter the city and see if he could see anything demonic, run into anyone uncanny, that sort of thing.
The priest looked a little more distressed.  "We don't usually do exorcisms.  But if you want to go to St Emydius, they have some psychiatrists who can help you if you're seeing demons.  And it's entirely free.  They're there on Monday, Wednesday, Friday."
At about shoulder-height, he felt a smooth patch of metal.  Sherlock pulled off a panel which apparently covered the projector controls.  The metal rectangle did have some sharp edges, but was not at all suited as a projectile.
The man licked his lips, and some drool came out of the corner of his mouth.  That was kind of strange.  Or actually, it wasn't drool.  A drop beaded up and thunked onto the desk the man had pushed himself back from.  Then the surface of the desk began smoking.  More and more drops poured out of the man's mouth, hitting the desk, and dripping onto the floor as he backed up and came around the desk towards Sherlock.
Sherlock wondered what he was doing there.  As the other man leaned back into Sherlock's booth, Sherlock asked, "So, that counts towards the 113, right?"
A dark green flame consumed her from the feet up.  No heat radiated off it that he could feel.  A bright white flare at the top of where her head had been caused Sherlock to jump back.  He was just surprised, not scared, and by the time he could see again, there were only a few green sparks in front of him, drifting upwards.
Sherlock stood again.  There was nothing else he wanted more in any world than to see John saved.  He rammed the window as hard as he could.  The desk slid under him, and the window flexed, and a good third of the window broke off, and fell with him as he rolled out of the building into the air.  There wasn't much time to react, but he twisted so his arms and legs were under him as he fell, and then he crushed in the roof of a car, with the piece of glass embedding in the bonnet next to him.
There were two young men just passing Sherlock,  and one flinched and looked back over his shoulder towards where the man in the suit had disappeared.  After a moment he turned back to his companion, who was dressed identically to himself, in a white short sleeved button-up shirt, black necktie, and black backpack.  They continued on their way.
As Sherlock walked out into the street, he took inventory of his pockets. He had his phone, his keys, his money clip, one of Lestrade's ID's, a squash ball, four bump keys, an upper left lateral human incisor, and a 250 millilitre wash bottle of isopropyl alcohol.  It was night, clearly.  The people whom he passed sounded like Americans, or perhaps Canadians, could have been any accent west of the Mississippi river.  It was rather warm out, with an onshore breeze.  It seemed to be early in the evening, so given the temperature, probably Southern California.
The man opened up to check what was causing him to be stuck, and Sherlock lunged down and stabbed him in the eye with the sharpened money clip.
Sherlock leapt up and planted his foot on the barrel of the tank's gun.  The sole of his shoe hissed against the hot barrel, but he had already jumped to the center of the turret.  Sherlock crouched down out of sight of the viewing port, and held as still as he could.  There was no need to be quiet over the tank noise.  He kept his eye riveted to the hatch and as the tank changed direction again, Sherlock could see the hatch bounce up and down, loosely.
Sherlock was alone again. The feathered creature had let go of his hand. His environment was dark, but it seemed he was standing between two buildings. He looked up and saw that the sky above him was purplish-orange with the familiar reflections of sodium lamps, and he seemed to be in an alley that smelled strongly of urine. He walked toward the alley's exit. There were cars driving by, and people out on the sidewalk who appeared to be living humans. Three women who appeared to be prostitutes stood near the street.
Sherlock pulled up to a likely-looking set of buildings and left the car outside the fence.  Instead of walking up the tire ruts towards the buildings, he went around the side of the property that abutted the creek.  He looked at the round gray river rocks as he walked.
"I don't know what your tattoo is, but I know I just saw an aura around you.  Something is uncanny about you, certainly."
This was also still LA, which, while not consisting entirely of deserted lots, still had some.  There was a restaurant whose entire sidewalk was blocked off.  It was painted black, a modernist building with lots of squares and the name in stainless steel sticking out from the building on bars and lit from underneath.  It was called "Lumen" with all lower-case letters.  The lights were currently off.  The sidewalk was entirely blocked without a plywood bypass, and the sign told people to use the other side of the street.
After a short sermon about why he shouldn't use honey, Sherlock managed to get out of her what road he had to take to get up to the pig farm.
The man in the suit spoke again.  "You'll have everything that you had on your person when you died, and just to be a sport, I'll let you have your phone, too. You can receive any information you want, but you can't email, text, call, or otherwise interact with anyone you knew when you were alive, or you'll come right back here and your time on Earth will be over. And now, this young lady will show you the way back to Earth. I have one request before you go.  Just before you jumped off the roof at St Bart's, you promised to shake hands with Mr Moriarty.  I heard you.  Go on."
The tattoos or whatever they were still covered the majority of his body, but all but one on his left arm had burned themselves away, as opposed to the ten remaining on his right arm.  He still couldn't roll up his sleeves without looking like the kind of person who would permanently cover himself with a lot of faux antique rubbish.  He checked one more time to make sure his shirt cuffs were pulled all the way down.
The clerk handed him a small paper bag and he handed her a ten.  Sherlock shuffled his change and bag around as charmingly as he could and held out his hand to shake.  "George Lestrade."
John thought he had made his peace, but all those thoughts he had had at Sherlock's death were coming back on him.  He would just get through this, see if he couldn't get Mycroft to deal with this man, and then he would go back to how things were.  He might go out to Sherlock's grave again, tell him about the whole story.  He probably would have liked this sort of thing, been able to explain it away immediately.
The man who answered sounded very far from home.  Mississippi, maybe?  "Thank you, ma'am.  Tell your daddy I appreciate it.  Happy Holidays."
As they landed at LAX, the sky looked really strange.  The middle of the sky was a dark gray brown, and down by the horizon, it was a Martian red.  All around, the fire alarms in buildings were going off, and fire truck sirens went back and forth frequently.  The smoke didn't bother Sherlock, but the smoke felt even thicker than Los Angeles' usual, past Bangkok's, even.  It was rare to see Americans wearing dust masks or surgical masks on any occasion, but today they were wearing them.
The glass man said no word.  A cascade of cracks went across him, and as he began to fall to pieces, he began to burn up.  There was a flash of orange fire, and then he was gone.  An old plastic flower high up on the wall was melted, but there was no other sign he had ever been there.  All the other nearby flower holders were empty.
Sherlock took a 20 pound note and stuffed it into the top of the wash bottle full of alcohol.  The note didn't wick, but maybe it would stay smoldering long enough to work.  He pried apart his phone and held his money clip near the battery terminals, preparing to make them arc and light the Molotov cocktail.  He rolled up a few of the bills from his money clip together into a long tube, ready to light and leave burning in case he needed more fire later.
Sherlock looked at Mycroft very flatly, and picked up the violin. As he opened the case and picked it up, he shot a look at Mycroft, one John might almost call surprise.  He spent a moment tuning it and setting it up, and then he drew the most godawful screeches from it. John hissed. His heart fell. He looked to Mycroft.
The noise of the passing train occasionally drowned Sherlock's words, and truthfully John thought the git deserved it. They had finished a case about twenty seconds ago, but the brunette was already complaining about how bored he was.
Sherlock just looked at him and smiled again. He had no idea what to say and he was afraid he'd just end up staring at the blonde again like in the café. He busied himself with his laptop, which he had to dig from under a stack of papers. Luckily, the kitchen table seemed to have passed Mrs. Hudson's raid and she entered the living room, still muttering about the water on the floor. Then she remembered John, and turned to him.
“You’ll start with buying me one of those raspberry muffins, and a cappuccino,” she decided, grinning. John just laughed and turned to the coffee machine. “Right.”
"God, you're doing that on purpose," John pants as his climax starts to get closer. Sherlock just moans in return and tries to spread his legs despite the clothes bunched up at his thighs.
"Sherlock," the man interrupted. Apparently the blinking was over and the man had reached a decision.
“We didn’t, those are actually an extra pair from Mrs Hudson, she didn’t need them all so I asked if we could borrow them,” Sherlock admitted, coming to stand next to John.
Sherlock watched him, smiling fondly to himself. Everything was perfect, the tree, the wine, the atmosphere...
Sherlock rolled to his back now with only the smallest wince. “You demanding for me to participate would be selfish. I don’t mind. Just get on with it, I need to use the loo soon and now I really want to watch.”
Sherlock settled into John's lap so that his back was leaning to John's chest. Then he tried again. "I just panicked. It felt so good, but I got scared. I always do. I can't... I can't think." His voice was soft again. John held him a bit tighter.
He spotted Sherlock at one table, making his way there. Sherlock already had two cups in front of him, and as soon as John had sat down, one of the baristas brought a generous slice of chocolate cake to the table. John grinned at the cake which had holly decorations on it as well.
John was wrapped up in his thoughts and didn’t notice when the shower was turned off. He jumped a bit when he felt Sherlock wrap his arms around him from the behind. “You’re being uncharacteristically jumpy,” he mumbled, sounding tired but happy. “Lost in your head?”
For a moment, John feared Sherlock would run away. The detective was just staring at him, looking completely lost. He kept opening and closing his mouth like he was trying to say something, and John was mildly reminded of the time he'd asked Sherlock to be his best man.
“Where’s the worst pain?” Sherlock closed his eyes at the attention to his muscles and considered the question. John added pressure to his movements and Sherlock opened his eyes again, smiling. When he did that though, a blush started to spread over his cheeks and he swallowed, smile almost faltering.
John sat up and opened the envelope, shaking his head fondly. This time the card was folded, with a detailed number 25 on the front. John opened it and smiled widely. 'I'll wear the antlers for Christmas Day' it said. John was about to put the card back when he noticed it had text on the back as well.
"I know you didn't have a Christmas present for me," Sherlock continued, "and I'm sorry I can't do this for you."
“It’s not the tights,” Sherlock rolled his eyes, clearly missing the point. “The jacket and hat were very detailed, I know I told you Mrs Hudson spent at least 20 hours sewing them.”
Some of the things Sherlock had listed were things John hadn’t realised about himself (‘I love the way you always tilt your head to the right when chewing, it’s cute’, ‘I love how you puff your chest out when we hold hands in public’) and some were so emotional that John wanted to just go back home and hug the man (‘I love you because you are you’, ‘I love the way you look at me when you’re about to kiss me’). Some of them were surprising and even odd (‘I love your toes’), and some were plain Sherlock (‘I love how you tolerate having body parts in the fridge’).
John gave him a huge smile and kissed the dancer again. They laid like that for a while, Sherlock laying his head on John’s shoulder and the blond just holding him. Then Sherlock had a thought. “How are you going to pay that teacher?”
“Mm, yes it’s pretty good,” John grinned, sipping on the drink again. They shared the chocolate cake and then got some more coffee, smiling and leaning into each other and watching as the snow started falling outside.
“Well, I never had a pet since,” Sherlock shrugged, sitting down at the sofa. “We can one of the dogs out for a walk, if you like,” he added, smiling at John.
"It's bloody two o'clock in the morning, it's basically Christmas eve already. This must be the most ridiculous time to do Christmas preparations, and I’m drinking caffeine at the moment." Sherlock did chuckle but John could see that he wasn’t fully in the spirit. “Tea contains very little caffeine.”
They got off and walked to their flat hand in hand, Sherlock’s ears still tinted light pink and John wearing a small smile on his face.
And being the bastard he was deep down, Aziraphale leaned his head back, picked up the wine glass he had freshly refilled, and let out a small contented moan as Crowley started licking. Crowley couldn't even watch his face lest he blush furiously, all the hedonism ramping wild in his field of vision being too much to handle. A very happy angel, having his cock sucked while he enjoyed a good glass of wine. Yep, way too much.
Sherlock almost froze on the spot. He hadn't thought about that, and now Mrs. Hudson was making her own assumptions. Sherlock couldn't think of a reason why she would be thinking that he and John were like that. He hadn't said anything, and she had just met her.
The detective didn't dare to risk a look at John's direction. Surely the doctor hadn’t been thinking that, no. This was probably too much, the blonde had been quite tolerating so far, but the moment on the coffee shop had proved that he did feel a bit awkward. Now Mrs. Hudson had –
"John?" Sherlock looked very confused and very emotional, and John felt a bit light-headed. "I was going to ask if you'd like to marry me."
“The perfect timing. How long have you been waiting at the door?” John asked, amused. He abandoned his phone and sat up, leaning to the headboard.
Sherlock was just putting a tray to the oven and straightened up when he heard John. “Here,” he said, wiping his hand on the cute apron he was wearing before giving John an envelope.
Sherlock, who had walked over to the tree to stare at it, turned to look at him, looking slightly uneasy. "You mean like guests and all? We've done that before. Shall we exchange presents?"
“What’s going on here?” John asked, leaving his coat on the rack and walking to the kitchen. The microscope was still there, but the rest of the table was filled with bowls, empty plates and a few plates already filled with cookies.
They both giggled for a while and then giggled some more as they kissed. Eventually Sherlock had to pull back to catch his breath, while John kissed his throat.
When he got home, he barely had time for a shower and quick dinner before Sherlock was dragging him into a cab. They went to the same place as before, this time they arrived there a bit later so the Christmas lights seemed to be exceptionally bright. It was snowing again and the ground was covered in a thin layer of pure white snow and John thought it was wonderful.
John grinned and pocketed the card, rubbing his hands together. “Alright, where can I get an adorable apron like yours?”
“John, this is almost too easy. A little bit of ballet and eye-fucking, and you’re already leaking?” he teased, now wrapping his fingers around John.
Mycroft got over his insistent urge to leave and when the time for exchanging gifts came, he and Sherlock actually managed to do it with smiles on their faces. Lestrade seemed very happy at the sight, and he actually winked at John, who chuckled and nodded back, patting Sherlock’s back when he came to drop his gift under the tree along with the ones he got from Lestrade, Mrs Hudson and Molly.
Mrs. Hudson had settled the dishes on the table when they returned, John carrying the turkey and the carrot-bean-mess and Sherlock balancing the plates, cutlery and glasses on his left hand. They set the table and sat down. Besides their turkey, there was now potato casserole, carrot casserole, something with fish and blackcurrants in it and cranberry sauce. The other tray, which apparently contained the desserts, was waiting on the coffee table.
“Sherlock? I’m home,” he called out, leaving the bags to shrug off his coat. Sherlock peeked his head from the kitchen and then quickly walked to the living room to give John today’s envelope and pick up the bags. “You’re being helpful,” John grinned and took the envelope, opening it.
He went straight for the stairs, not waiting for an answer, though he heard John apologising to Mrs. Hudson. He grinned, and seconds later he heard John’s steps on the stairs. "Will probably be late, don't wait up. Nice to finally have something interesting to do."
Oh, he shouldn't have threatened Sherlock with the bar last time, the detective always added a little revenge when it was his turn to play. John tried to relieve the pressure on his groin by wiggling against the material of the chair, but Sherlock quickly tugged his hips up just enough so that he couldn't get the friction where he needed it. Damn him, always knowing just what to do.
"Umm, well you know I'm not really a cook, and I thought you could help with the turkey's seasoning." She clapped her hands merrily. "Oh wonderful, you got a turkey! I wasn't sure what you boys wanted and totally forgot the meat in the fuss."
“You know, I’m not fetishizing ballet or anything, believe me…” John panted, his hips twitching under Sherlock’s as the brunet stroked him slowly, smirking from where he was straddling John’s thighs.
Then Sherlock took and left. All they got was an excited and frantic rant and a shout of "PINK!" and the brunette was off. John was left there with the confused team. Sherlock had been shouting at the top of his lungs, and now heads were peaking from every door.
After the dinner, Sherlock was laying on the sofa again, this time merely content. John had persuaded him into trying the food, piling his plate with a small amount of everything. Sherlock ended up realising that he in fact did like the turkey and the weird bean dish and Mrs. Hudson's potato casserole.
Oh wow I actually wrote quite a lot, be proud! Also why can't I write stuff without smut, I was trying to save it for later.
(I honestly considered making that sack contain bongade stuff, wtf... Maybe I'll write a caption like that on my ig page, lol.)
"Alright, um... You can turn around now, and take some water," he said, clearing his throat again. When John turned around on the table, Sherlock gave him a glass of water, trying to keep his eyes off of John's half hard erection.
He did bake another plateful of tiny hearts but the rest of them were regular gingerbreads. Sherlock was still holding the plate when the blond came back, brining tea for them. He looked at Sherlock. “Do you like them?”
As a teenager he’d sported the idea of being able to read his soulmate’s thoughts, but of course it didn’t work like that. They were sitting in a cab, on their way to see a flat, and John really had no idea why this man would be his soulmate. By the looks and sounds of things, the smart, gorgeous man should deserve something a bit better than an old, bored army veteran.
They wrapped the gifts nicely, sipping on their mugs and feeding each other cookies, and Sherlock made big decorations from the ribbon to put on top of the packages.
"God, we're never doing it again here," John groaned, painting as Sherlock let his legs down. "My tailbone is killing me."
“I swear it was an accident, I’m sorry. I don’t know why I’m ruining this Christmas.” John put his hand in Sherlock’s curls and rubbed Sherlock’s scalp with his thumb.
Omg I'm so close to catching up on these :D I wish I could've stayed on "schedule" but oh well I actually have a holiday to have
“So, you’ve got us a tree?” John asked, getting coffee. Sherlock had clearly made him sandwiches already, and he munched on them happily, sitting across from Sherlock. “Uh, yeah… In the living room,” Sherlock replied distractedly, still staring into the microscope.
Sherlock looked absolutely ridiculous in the shorts, the jersey and helmet that squished his curls, but the detective had had time to brace himself to the experience, so he handled it with grace.
"Will you come?" Lestrade looked desperate but knowing the police Sherlock was quite surprised how well they had handled the case so far.
"You think Lestrade won't come looking for us?" Sherlock just scoffed and looked at John, challenge evident in his gaze.
I meant to post this before Christmas since The Nutcracker is a Christmassy ballet, but I'm not exactly surprised it's already February.
Sherlock opened it and picked up the letter that was on top. John took it curiously and pulled out a card that was similar to what he’d gotten yesterday. Only this one had a big number 2 on it. John turned it over and looked at the text written on it.
"I'm hoping so, at least," Sherlock replied distractedly, looking around. He pulled John through the equipment rent and then found an empty bench for them to sit on. There, he finally showed John the insides of the bag.
John felt his brain freeze again then. The candle was really doing things to him, yes, but someone really assumed he was
“Jesus, Sherlock,” John groaned, leaning against the headboard as Sherlock started moving, his eyes screwed shut in pleasure. John struggled to keep his eyes open too, his hands gripping Sherlock’s hips and nearly pulling on him every time the brunet ground down.
"I made you a Christmas calendar," Sherlock repeated, his voice getting small. "I thought it'd be nice, but I don't know, I've never had one and I don't know if you'd eve-"
The doctor closed his eyes and took a deep breath as Sherlock repeated the process of massaging every inch of John, adding more pressure with every pass from shoulder to ankle. John kept humming in agreement when Sherlock found a particularly soft spot, trying not to moan aloud as he only got harder and harder at the sensuous touch.
Saturday, Sherlock woke John up but didn’t tell what that day’s calendar surprise would be until after they’d had lunch (meaning takeaway from the closest Chinese). Then he threw John’s coat onto the doctor’s face and pulled his Belstaff on. “Come on, John!”
That took John by surprise again and he let out a tiny huff. "You really are brilliant." The blonde looked sincere, and that really confused Sherlock and his eyes widened slightly in shock before he could stop himself.
The next day John came home to find Sherlock about to bake something again. Sherlock got him an apron too and then they baked gingerbreads from a dough Sherlock had prepared earlier and drank eggnog that Sherlock had prepared earlier too.
“Yes? You should dress up, I’ve already called for a taxi,” Sherlock said, smiling at him. John shook his head, snapping back to he moment. “Why did you get a suit for me? I’ve got a suit,” he mumbled, looking at Sherlock with his head tilted to the left.
Sherlock had to pause to take a breath and it was John’s turn to just stare. The brunette risked a glance at his direction, and John opened his mouth again. “That really is brilliant. You can do that with anyone?”
John remembered that Sherlock had been worried about the lack of a Christmas tree last year, however short that worry had been. He started to suspect that Sherlock would make amends this year, and he could only hope the detective wouldn’t go mad with the decorations. But no, that wouldn’t be like him, John thought and smiled as they caught a taxi and headed back home.
John had actually put so much effort into this thing that he'd invested in huge spoons, and now he picked the second last and pressed it to Sherlock's lips. “Open up.”
Sherlock nodded sheepishly at her before getting his things and quickly changing his clothes before practically pulling John out of the studio. They walked briskly the few blocks home, giving small, meaningful smiled to each other as they hurried towards their flat.
“Of course you don’t have to, I just thought… You mentioned you weren’t progressing a few weeks ago, and I – well, I thought it could, um, help, maybe,” he mumbled, feeling hot and red already.
It was the first rehearsal with the costumes, and Sherlock was practically fuming at the puffy, pink-white striped candy costume he had been given as he pulled it on.
"Oh, yeah..." John took a sip of water, wondering what to say next. Then it occurred to him, something he hadn't noticed had been bothering him.
When they walked home, the snowflakes clung to Sherlock’s curls and John’s coat, and the doctor grinned at the clichéness of the whole thing and how much he indeed loved it all.
Sherlock hadn’t moved – thank goodness – while he had been away, but he hadn’t been resting exactly either. His feet were twitching nervously and he was already picking on the cast. John tutted and handed him the phone Sherlock had somehow forgotten on his coat pocket and hadn’t bothered to go and fetch.
The next morning, Sherlock was still in bed when John woke up, sleeping soundly with one of his arms trapped under John’s pillow. John grinned at the sight, wrapping his arms around the brunet and nearly falling asleep again until Sherlock spoke. “You’re not going back to sleep, we have things to do.”
When they’d both come down from the high, John cleaned them with a wet towel and then cuddled Sherlock on the bed. Sherlock wrapped himself around John like an octopus, kissing his neck contentedly.
“Why would I look at some random bloke’s tights when you’re there as well and much more interesting?”
Well, almost. It seemed like he would be the one to nag around the flat, Sherlock seemed to make a lot of mess.
"Mmm, Sherl - what are you wearing?" John asked, rubbing his eyes and taking the envelope while frowning at Sherlock's getup.
I know, I know... I'm so late with these, the flow died and I'm having some trouble getting stuff done.
Trying to get back to normal, John focused on sorting out his cutlery and pouring himself a glass of water from the pitcher that hadn’t been there earlier. What was going on?
“Get what ready??” John tried to ask, but Sherlock was gone already and the water was so nice, so he left it and closed his eyes, letting the hot water warm him up. He had to rub his legs and feet a bit, but eventually he started to feel like blood was flowing everywhere like it should.
"Yes, that's it." Sherlock started to sound more urgent, so John brought a hand to rub at his lower back soothingly. "It's okay, I've got you. Just let go."
Mrs Hudson had signed the slip hastily, and John chuckled, finding her from the side of the stage and giving a quiet nod. She nodded back and even gave him a thumbs-up before disappearing somewhere again. John relaxed on his seat as everyone got their places and the ballet began.
“You know you can kiss me without the mistletoe too?” John giggled when they broke apart, their noses touching. “Mmm, but I like the idea,” Sherlock grinned back, kissing him again. John lifted his hands to Sherlock’s shoulders and then frowned.
“Umm, just sit over there, your back against the headboard,” Sherlock said breathily, getting off of John’s lap and fetching the lube. “Could you..?”
All the air left John's lungs as Sherlock practically jumped on him. "Mmwhat, Sh'lock," he groaned, opening his eyes. "Am I late for work?"
“Right now we have a killer to catch. Or not maybe, they did kill a serial killer after all, it was bound to be someone’s job.” Now he was rambling, how nice. What kind of trash did the cabbie use on him? He shook his head as they entered the living room. The rug was gone and someone had scrubbed the blood off the floor and the wall. There was a hole from the bullet and Sherlock bent to have a look.
“Of course you’ll be there to see it,” he mumbled distractedly as he tried to straighten a picture of holly leaves that John had glued awry.
“Hmh? You mean Jack?” John asked, looking at him. “The tall, blonde one?” he clarified after Sherlock scowled at him. “Yeah, him. Either give him a position where he doesn’t need to crouch and make tight turns, or teach him how to do it without damaging his legs. He’ll be an arse about getting advised, though. Used to getting what he wants, but also father troubles,” Sherlock said, sounding bored but clearly showing off.
a big thing. I’ll be there,” he promised, pressing the stop button. “It’s going to be your first official audition, after all.”
Jeez, it's been ten months... This is almost like The Incredibles comeback except that The Incredibles 2 was actually good.
“Yeah, I know. So, I did a few, uh, calls around, and well, there’s this… Mrs. Hudson if I remember correctly.”
“John, you do know why it’s there, right?” Sherlock mumbled, tugging on John’s t-shirt now. “A big bow, right on my bum…”
“I’d never change my mind,” Sherlock scoffed, but published the text with a big smile on his face. With John’s eager agreement, he also posted the text on John’s blog, just so that people could actually see it.
As he climbed the stairs with the grocery bags, John wondered what Sherlock had come up with today. Realising all this had only been going on for a week now, John chuckled and shook his head as he walked into the living room.
It said ‘candlelight dinner’, this time written in a beautiful handwriting and had a small drawing of a candle with a few holly leaves as decoration next to it. John stared at the card until something brushed against his back and he jumped in surprise.
Before Sherlock could answer though, John's phone started ringing. Sherlock shook his head, so John stopped his hand before he could answer the call. Soon enough, the caller gave up and silence fell again.
When he got back, Sherlock had gotten up too, and John found him in the kitchen, tapping away on his phone.
“It’s tomorrow, she’ll want to see you dance so she knows where to start,” John announced when he entered the living room after calling Mrs. Hudson. Sherlock nodded once, curtly, frowning a little.
John gazed at Sherlock lovingly, rewarding him with hundreds of kisses. "You're the best husband. You made a whole jumper for me, that's... How did you even manage this without me noticing?"
John didn’t really pay attention to the things their guide told them, partly because he knew it all and partly because he was too busy remembering the times he’d spent there.
As the show date crawled closer, Sherlock became nervous and snappish. But between practicing and studying, he seemed to need John’s presence no matter how crabby he tried to be. John smiled secretly to himself every time Sherlock cuddled close to him and still insisted he didn’t need it as he nuzzled his face against John’s shoulder.
John pursed his lips, trying to ignore the image of Sherlock strolling around the flat on a new pair of tights and that leotard, and sighed. “Mmm, if you have time. Chemistry had never been my strong point.”
John chuckled, finishing the last sandwich and turning to Sherlock. “Just thinking about you, but the real-life version is even better,” he grinned, pecking Sherlock’s lips before reaching for the plate. “Here, let’s eat up before you fall asleep on your feet.”
The next day, John found the envelope in his suitcase as he was fetching some papers from it. The card said ‘romantic outdoors ice-skating: vol.2’, and John chuckled to himself. Suddenly he couldn’t wait for his shift to end.
After a short paperwork circus at the Yard, Sherlock and John were free to go home. John was thrilled to get a proper meal and hopefully a longish nap on their own bed, but Sherlock clearly wasn't finished.
When John was seven, they had spent a week in Thailand. It had been perfect but returning home - all rain and clouds - quickly killed him again. His parents said it had been expensive and that he had no right to sulk but it had made no difference.
All too soon, Sherlock’s orgasm swept over him and he froze, crying out as he rode out the waves of pleasure. John felt him clench around him, and it brought him over the edge as well. He pulled Sherlock tightly against himself, kissing him heatedly and a little sloppily.
John leaned in to kiss Sherlock briefly and then watched the man's face for a moment. "Okay, love. But we'll take it very slowly, okay? And right now it's time for breakfast." Sherlock gave a big smile at that.
They stayed in bed until John’s bladder grumbled unhappily and he had to get up. “Sherlock, I need the loo,” he mumbled, disengaging himself from the detective’s cuddle and tiptoeing into the bathroom.
“I’m in the background, I can’t shine too much,” Sherlock mumbled back, zipping up his bag. “I’d distract the leads,” he added, sounding happier and lighter than before the practice. Then he twisted his head to look at John. “Now get off me so I can pull my sweats on, I want to get home sooner than later.”
well after Afghanistan. He couldn't stomach anything on mornings, but after an explicitly bad nightmare he would usually be too nauseous to eat for the whole day.
Before John knew, he was on his back with Sherlock on top of him, kissing him. He was about to push the other man farther, but then Sherlock pulled back.
Only when Sherlock pulled him by the sleeve, wordlessly asking him to stop, John focused fully on him.
I know that, you git. You know, Mrs. Hudson has made us something and I’m guessing my attempts will blanch in comparison.” He laid his head on the brunet’s shoulder.
John just kissed him again, pausing his hands for a while. "Of course, of course." Sherlock ran his fingers up and down John's back, gathering his thoughts.
“Of course you’re going to eat with us, Mrs. Hudson,” he said. “If Sherlock gets those books to the shelf, you can put the tray here.”
“I also got a pair of new tights to go with that as well, since my old tights aren’t very compatible with leotards,” he said casually, now picking up the book and smiling a bit as John just stared at the garment. “Do you need help with this? I could quiz you.”
John sighed, got up and headed upstairs. He sat on his bed again, considering what to do. He should visit his flat, get the rest of his things moved here. He’d need to clean his gun, and he had only brought so many clothes with him yesterday.
It was just a piece of clothing, he told himself. He knew everyone in the advanced class wore one, he’d stayed behind to sneak a look at the studio after his lesson had ended. Most of them also had soft flowing wrap skirts, and the few masculine figures he’d spotted had been wearing leg warmers and wrap tops for warm-up. The fact that everyone else his age seemed so professional, with their appropriate get-up and all, made him feel inferior somehow.
John slid his hand lower slowly, and then burst out laughing when he realised the panties had a huge bow just above Sherlock’s arse. “Oh my god, that’s so precious,” John giggled, taking a look at the bow and then kissing Sherlock again.
After he’d gotten out of the tub and dried himself, John pulled on a pair of boxers and his pyjamas. As he stepped to the hallway, he noticed that all the lights were off. Frowning, he made his way to the kitchen, stopping on his tracks under the doorway again as he saw the room. The lights were off, but the table was lit up by a gorgeous candle piece and the few extra candles that were scattered in between the dishes that were the source of the delicious smell John noticed only now.
Sherlock's voice got louder when John slowly unbuttoned his shirt. He planted a light kiss on Sherlock’s chest, and enjoyed the whimper the detective gave at that. He was getting more confident with what they were doing, and it seemed that Sherlock was too.
“You’ll get the lead next year, I’m certain of it. You’ll do your part so well this year, Mrs. Hudson won’t have a choice but to make you the lead next time.”
Sherlock let out a moan, and it was very arousing for John to notice that the detective was already rock hard from just kissing. He helped Sherlock to lay fully on his back, and then trailed down to kiss at the brunette's neck. He ran his hands over Sherlock’s chest, feeling his hard nipples under the thin shirt, and muffled his own moan on Sherlock’s shoulder.
John used to have much the same effect on him as Moriarty. There was no reason to indulge in artificial stimulants when they were running off together, solving cases and having adventures, just as John’s constant presence and steadfast companionship made Sherlock’s emotional painkillers seem rather superfluous. What boredom did inevitably and routinely arise could usually be dealt with through the use of cigarettes or, due to John’s vehement protests, nicotine patches. If anything, Sherlock had sometimes felt tempted to shoot up just to escape how comfortable he felt and go back, albeit temporarily, to his old self: indifferent to flattery and unheeding of his own need for positive social interactions with another human being.
Sherlock searches for his lips, his tongue, his throat, his larynx, his vocal cords. It takes approximately ten seconds from he’s asked to say something until he finally manages to procure a weak gasp as a response. Not exactly a Shakespearean soliloquy, but it’s the best he can manage at the moment. His thoughts are muddled and his body feels heavy and unnatural.
John has borrowed a book on Jack the Ripper with (rather grisly) details on the exact location and form of the various wounds inflicted on the victims. He’s reading it aloud to Sherlock to help him fall asleep whenever his energy fails him. John’s therapist would likely have a thing or two to say about this, as indeed would any other sane individual, but it’s just the two of them who are in on it and John honestly can’t find it in him to care about the opinions of therapists or sane individuals, not when Sherlock's eyes light up like a little child's on Christmas morning when John accompanies him into his bedroom with the book in hand.
“Let me stop you there,” he repeats. “Because you’re not making any sense. Your gratitude, I’ll take that if it makes you feel better. But everything else… You’re right. Having a child and being in a relationship have never been something I’ve aspired to. For the longest time, I’d sworn off relationships entirely. I was sure I’d never have a child until
“You follow him around everywhere. You’ve followed him around for years. You’ve just spent three days sleeping on a plastic chair in a hospital just to watch over him. You do all that, knowing he wouldn’t do the same in return?”
It was still a week before Sherlock managed to get a date with Mrs. Hudson that didn’t collide with an important lecture or an experiment.
Sherlock smiled and walked to the tv stand, turning on the dc player and putting one cd in. When he pressed play, the flat was filled with the first chords of “Jingle Bell Rock”. John laughed and shook his head, pulling Sherlock close and kissing him softly. “Alright, that’ll do it. Let’s just eat something first though, I’m starving.”
John had talked Sherlock into helping him make a gingerbread house, Sherlock had made the plan and now John was cutting the proper-sized pieces from the dough.
"So ballet is hard after all? Lucky you have a competent med student here and nowhere to go,” he said with a smirk. True enough, it was Saturday and they would have the whole day for themselves. With a gentle prompt from John, Sherlock lowered his arm and John started to massage his shoulders lightly.
John sighed contentedly, closing his eyes and resting his head on Sherlock’s shoulder. “I love you, you know.”
“I’m John Watson, and maybe I could buy you a coffee? You could tell me all about my brother, if you want to that is,” he added, probably a bit baffled by Sherlock’s still ongoing stupid staring.
Sherlock's eyes fell meaningfully to the floor in front of the fireplace as he climbed to crouch on the other armchair, placing his hands under his chin. John followed the gaze and noticed the pink suitcase. It must be the thing Mrs. Hudson complained about.
When Sherlock decorated the last cookies, both John and Mrs Hudson giggled when they saw that he was making them into tiny hedgehogs. They didn’t dare to eat any of those cookies until later, and Mrs. Hudson got quite a few of the other cookies to take back to her flat since John and Sherlock couldn’t possibly eat them all.
The first show was a success. At least that was John’s opinion. He had stayed on the backstage this time since he needed to move the props almost every time the scene changed, but the dancers looked generally happy, and Mrs Hudson didn’t snap or yell at anyone behind the curtain, so it must’ve gone smoothly.
From the corner of his eye, Sherlock could see John watching him intently and he couldn’t entirely suppress the smirk. He tried to focus on the moves, but he might’ve been a little sloppy towards the end. Mrs. Hudson seemed to notice the glances Sherlock and John exchanged since she only tutted and shook her head instead of giving Sherlock a talk like she usually would when he wasn’t one hundred percent concentrated on his routine.
To John’s surprise, Sherlock fell asleep after an hour or so, cuddled close to John. He must’ve been sleeping badly, since he slept for a few hours while John stroked his shoulders and arms softly, smiling down at him fondly.
"Let's try something more challenging," Sherlock mumbled, letting go of John and slowing down. The detective showed John a few backwards skating techniques (which he managed to do without falling over), and then how to do a crossover (which he didn't really manage).
They probably intended to make their way to the bedroom, but as it turned out, the sink edge was the perfect height for John to sit on without requiring Sherlock to bend his knees.
John was familiar with nightmares but he didn't know if Sherlock usually had them, so he had forced Sherlock to talk about it. They ended up talking until dawn, and that finally cleared the air at 221B.
And oh God, did he suddenly feel old. Sherlock looked like he was in his late twenties at the most and John himself was almost 40, how could they work this out? A ten-year-age-gap sounded bad really and John had seen relationships destroyed over much smaller things.
This chapter is so short it's just sad, so I might add something to it later. But I wanted to get something posted for a change, especially because Nutcracker is a Christmas thing and
A few times he had had to be at the café, since Molly was at the rehearsal too and all the other employees magically happened to have something super important to do. Those times John would come home to a cranky, sulky ballet dancer taking up the whole sofa and complaining about the other dancers and the stage and the weather.
The loose material allowed him to perform rather lewd acts even through the fabric though, so Crowley didn't comment on the choice of clothing, he never did in this situations.
Talking about Sherlock’s dancing was something that immediately put him on alert, John could feel his legs tense on his lap. When Sherlock didn’t comment, John continued: “I understand you, um, said you don’t have a teacher, right? I mean you haven’t, or...”
“Well, I moved into a student housing and I didn’t want to get bullied for it, so I thought it best to just stop,” Sherlock shrugged, trying to seem nonchalant, but John could see the hurt bubbling just beneath the surface. “And the last few years?” He prompted, stepping closer. Sherlock looked away, changing legs. “I wasn’t sure how you’d react, so I decided to not let you know,” he said quietly, looking at his knee as he stretched.
"What was that? You said something about pink, has it something to do with the woman we saw yesterday?"
Sherlock didn’t take it. Instead, he kept tugging on the edge of his cast, looking down at the floor.
Sherlock woke up feeling fuzzy and mildly disoriented. He was tucked in his own bed, practically rolled up in a sheet. He tried to get up but his head wasn’t exactly sure which way was up. What on earth had he done? Finally, his struggles paid off as he managed to sit up. Freeing his hands properly was something trickier, and he fell right off the bed with an undignified yelp.
John nodded, trying to stretch his legs too. “Why stop? You seem pretty good at it, and well, your personality clearly is made for a demanding sport like this…”
Sherlock wanted to touch himself, he'd been on the edge for a while now, but the way he was positioned meant he had to grab the edges of the desk or he'd fall.
"Look at you, all happy. It's not decent," the landlady chimed, but Sherlock could see the smile on her face.
They did kiss quite a lot, but this was different and brought a sort of a novel feeling to kissing. Sherlock would glance at the mistletoe sometimes, blatantly inviting John to press soft kisses to his lips which he rarely did now that he’d gotten more confident with intimacy. John found it adorable and sometimes he’d tell Sherlock just that, but more often than not the doctor would just kiss him back, making sure Sherlock knew how much John loved kissing him.
He also tried to come watch his lessons every week. It was lovely to see Sherlock get better every time, even though he had no idea how it happened since everything looked like the same sort of brilliant to him. John quickly learned that Mrs. Hudson wasn’t one to give compliments in class easily, but she did like to chat with John before and after Sherlock’s lessons, always praising Sherlock’s diligence. John smiled at Sherlock’s direction fondly, and always agreed with her.
suit for something more special. “Come here,” he sighed, pulling Sherlock into his arms and kissing him softly.
As promised, the next day was John’s day. He’d given Sherlock a list of things he wanted to show Sherlock, so it wouldn’t exactly be a surprise. But John liked the thought anyways, and he had nearly snickered at the look on Sherlock’s face when he’d first read through the list.
Sherlock emerged after a while, inviting John into the bathroom. The doctor went happily, smiling at Sherlock and kissing him softly.
“Well, this occasion needed it,” Sherlock shrugged, undressing too and then stepping into the tub, pulling John in there too. They found a comfortable position, cuddling in the warm water until it grew tepid, enjoying the romantic atmosphere and the lovely scents.
"Is this okay?" He was already looking throughoutly shagged with a full blush and his hair sticking up.
Sherlock moaned into the kiss, bending one knee so he could rub his thigh against John’s hardening length before breaking the kiss and pulling John towards the bedroom. John followed eagerly, shedding his coat and shoes on the hallway. Sherlock grinned at him and then pinned him against the doorway, kissing him again.
Next day John got a text from Sherlock just as he was about to leave the clinic after finishing his shift. It only contained an address and nothing more, but John realised it must’ve been another surprise, so he rushed out of the building and got a cab, giving the address to the cabbie with a big smile.
Sherlock let out a quiet sound in return, tightening his fingers around John and sliding his other hand lower, exploring John's testicles carefully. That did it for John, and he came after a few strokes, groaning Sherlock's name.
“Of course,” John smiled, taking the lube and slicking his fingers up while Sherlock slipped out of the panties and straddled the blond’s hips. “We’re so using those panties again, by the way,” John mumbled, kissing Sherlock and rubbing a fingertip at Sherlock’s entrance.
"Here's one of your blue ones," he said, tossing it to John, who brightened up a bit. "Oh, these are my favourites! I just saw this one's pair in my drawer," he said, leaving the sock aside so he wouldn't forget.
It was poor luck that Molly happened to be a dancer too, since they both needed almost every day during the show week off from their afternoon shifts, and the café had only a few employees.
“No shit, Watson,” Sherlock grinned, pecking his lips once again before pulling back and reaching for his coat and bag. “Let’s go home, then.”
to access some important evidence – which everyone else said didn’t matter but it did – and now he was trapped in a coffee shop, trying to pry his way out of the crowd that definitely hadn’t been there a minute ago. He already regretted ignoring Molly back at the morgue, he could’ve got his coffee there when he realised he wouldn’t be going home just yet.
"Oh, it's nothing, I'll bring it all to 221b tomorrow. Poor Sherlock, he should take care with a weather like that. Now where's that turkey?"
This time Sherlock didn't panic. He just closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths before answering.
When there were no gifts left, John licked his lips and got up. “I’ve got a gift for you too,” he started, looking at Sherlock.  “It’ll be here any second.”
Sherlock swiftly picked up the case and sat down on his leather armchair in front of John, planting the case wide open in his lap. "See, what is missing from this case?"
Swaying to the closest chair and sitting down, he sighed and reached for his slippers. He could feel the rather familiar rush of exasperation when he pulled the slippers to his feet rather clumsily, and the tiny voice in the back of his head woke up. He’d never get better, he’d be stuck here. Always be the fat blob of sugar swaying in the far corner of the stage, never on the limelight.
That was why, when Sherlock came back from Scotland Yard one especially freezing day, he found John decorating a real pine tree which he had somehow managed squeeze to the corner of the living room. He had actually asked Lestrade to give Sherlock something to do while he got all the supplies.
John was yet again mesmerised by the elegance of the dancers, so much that he almost lost track of the plot. But he’d seen enough in the practices that he had already figured out most of what was happening on the stage, even if his attention had been mostly focused on Sherlock. But now everything seemed nicer and more professional with the proper costumes and music and without Mrs Hudson jumping to the stage to correct whatever she thought was wrong at the time.
While he waited for the kettle, John tried to find something edible for them. Some shelves in the fridge looked like a biohazard, and the bread bin had more mold than bread in it. He found some eggs from a cupboard and carefully smelled each one after cracking it to make sure they weren’t off (a few were). How was Sherlock even alive now started to seem like a mystery to John.
John could see the eyeroll underneath the blindfold and chuckled. Then he took the final spoon. "Okay, this is the last one. Open up."
Friday's surprise became clear when Sherlock dumper a huge pile of different wrapping papers, pens and markers, ribbons and small Christmas-themed card decorations on the floor and then stuffed an envelope into John's hand before fetching the bag of presents they'd bought.
“John Watson, shut up,” Sherlock murmured with a grin, bending forward to kiss him briefly. “You’re way too talkative for someone who’s supposed to be drowning in ecstasy,” he purred quietly, tightening his hold.
John got a sudden urge to end the party and get Sherlock to their bedroom. But ignored it, keeping up the happy Christmas spirit. Sherlock kept glancing at him and grinning, and John knew the detective was enjoying himself despite all the protests and eye-rollings.
When the blonde started to look a bit concerned, Sherlock finally told himself to get it together and opened his mouth again.
When he stepped in, John realised they were in a locker room of sorts. But instead of the gym hall type of metal lockers, the walls were covered in very expensive-looking wooden cabinets. Sherlock opened up one cabinet to reveal a bunch of mostly white clothes.
She opened the door wide and stepped aside to let the men in. Sherlock couldn't help but comply. After all, he'd actually just been waiting for a case, not exactly working on it just yet. He quickly climbed the stairs and unlocked the door to 221B. Swishing in, he quickly shed his coat while John took in the flat. The doctor eyed the stacks of papers and files on the overflowing desk and Sherlock suddenly had the weirdest urge to tidy the place up.
“There’s a potential case,” he murmured into John’s ear, practically vibrating with energy. “Someone’s being blackmailed, and there are plans of a possible terrorist attack involved.”
With Sherlock’s impeccable accuracy they build a gingerbread castle decorating it with sugary icicles and suspiciously wonky gingerbread pine trees since John was a bit too tipsy from the eggnog to cut the trees up correctly, which amused Sherlock to no end.
They took a cab home, Sherlock bouncing his feet impatiently while John tried not to let his hand travel upwards from where it was resting on Sherlock’s thigh. Sherlock glanced at him and quickly looked away, swallowing visibly. John grinned to himself, squeezing Sherlock’s thigh.
“Sherlock, most of the recipients won’t really pay attention. And besides, we won’t be there to see if they do, anyways,” John sighed while Sherlock tried to fix a card after “John had done it improperly”.
“So, I thought you’d appreciate having a clean, fresh fridge this time, if you’re planning on cooking something this year. Or maybe cleaning it would’ve been wise earlier too, it’s not like I’m doing this only because it’s Christmas,” Sherlock mumbled, rambling a little.
John tried to mimic Sherlock’s position, still feeling quite silly. Sherlock turned around and fixed his hand and hips a bit, now wearing the lovely look of focused concentration. John found that he didn’t actually care about how stupid he looked, if it made Sherlock look at him like that.
Now that his mind was rapidly focusing on the case, he had little time to fret over his fears or the niceties.
To his surprise, there was a seat specifically reserved for him. “Must be Mrs Hudson’s doing,” John thought as he sat down, smiling to himself. Right before the show began, someone came to hand John another bouquet of red roses with a side-note.
"This is - it's..." A bright blush spread to his cheeks. The doctor removed the blindfold and smirked as Sherlock swallowed the mouthful of sperm.
‘Breakfast in bed’ it said. John listened, but no sounds came from the rest of the flat, and he’d noticed if Sherlock had snuck out recently. He was about to reach for his phone to check the time when Sherlock pushed the door open with his foot, carrying a large tray.
"Just me this time, you can’t touch me or thrust at me," he decided, watched as John nodded in agreement and then gripped the waistband with his teeth and pulled the pants down to midthigh. John put his hands behind his back and gripped them to keep himself from touching Sherlock.
Sherlock was sitting in his chair, sipping on the glass of mulled wine Mrs Hudson had stuck on his hand. John was in the kitchen, humming along to some annoyingly over-played Christmas song on the radio while he rolled out the gingerbread dough. The gifts they had gotten from Greg, Molly, Mrs Hudson and even Mycroft were placed under the tree, the guests had left an hour ago.
John moaned, rolling a condom on himself and lubing it up quickly. “Fuck, you’re the best, Sherlock, I swear to –
Sherlock wasn't sure he liked the big grin that spread to Mrs. Hudson's face. "Did he now? Well come in, both of you."
1) I know I'm late again, I'm having a crazy busy week but I swear I'll catch up when weekend comes!
“Having a date with your girlfriend?” the cabbie asked as the cab started moving and slid into the traffic smoothly.
"Mycroft?" John wasn't sure if he should just leave. Lestrade looked fairly anxious to get to work, but this might be John's only chance of learning things about Sherlock for a long while. The man himself might not want to tell him anything.
Sherlock’s face was starting to turn slightly red and his eyes wouldn’t stay open as the initial adrenaline wore off, so they took the painkillers the doctor prescribed and headed home. As soon as they arrived at 221b, Sherlock collapsed – very carefully – onto the sofa and curled on his side, still cradling the arm. John could see his breathing was still too heavy and took pity.
“Shhh, just sleep, you’ve got a few hours before your alarm,” Sherlock whispered, kissing John’s forehead before disappearing to the loo. John shrugged mentally, rolling over and falling asleep again.
“’Christmas cookies and other treats’?” John read aloud, grinning at Sherlock. “You’re baking for me?”
Right when Sherlock’s class ended, the showers were still empty for his use. But soon after they’d be full of other dancers getting ready for their class, a shared group class for advanced dancers. They were mostly the same age as John and Sherlock, John noticed as he was waiting for Sherlock on the corridor.
"That's all right." John took Sherlock's hand and turned to go. He felt Sherlock lace their fingers together and smiled.
“So how did you know about Afghanistan? Or Harry?” They had just got into the cab, but John really was dying to know. “And please don’t tell me you’ve been following me, I just complimented you.” The man chuckled, but John saw that he was slightly uneasy.
Sherlock had his on his inner wrist on his left hand. He knew what it meant, it was one of the most suggestive places one could have their Words.
So, he was really itching to see how the final production looked like. Sherlock had shown him enough different versions by the best ballet schools and companies that he knew this was a rather big production, and he considered just buying a ticket for Friday to support the whole hustle.
Sometimes people had words in different language that they didn’t understand. Sometimes, if you were really unfortunate, the font would be so messy you couldn't read it. Or you could be stuck in the endless “I’ve got your words but you haven’t got mine” loop. Some said was all meant to be like destiny, but most just chalked it up to pure chance.
John just stared at the man – Sherlock, what a name – and nodded. He was already sure he’d follow this man almost anywhere, there was so much he wanted to ask him. So they made their way out of the coffee shop and onto the street, where Sherlock hailed a cab.
Sherlock had been woken up by Mrs. Hudson's fussing and had stalked over to lean on the living room doorframe. John glanced at him, smiling, and continued arrange his ingredients. He was going to start with the dough, as it would need to sit in the fridge for a while before baking to enhance the fl-
“Mm, we’ve got to make these at home,” John mumbled as he bit into the cupcake. “This is delicious…”
Sherlock places his feet on the floor and sat up properly, and John had to raise his hands to rub at his neck, feeling very awkward. “And, uh, we talked and… Well, it’s only once a week, but it was something like 90 minutes, or... But it wasn’t a bad price and I figured I could -”
For the Christmas party, John wore the lovely-hideous jumper Sherlock had made while Sherlock produced a more restrained version with one detailed white snowflake on a beige jumper. They finished the appetizers and made some more gingerbreads before John started on the mulled wine and Sherlock tidied up in the living room. Mrs Hudson joined them at one point, fussing about everything and helping John in the kitchen despite his protests.
Next morning, John was woken up by Sherlock, who was already dressed in his normal suit and a pearl grey shirt. “John wake up, there’s breakfast waiting!” The detective announced before rushing off, leaving John groaning as he sat up.
Sherlock could feel his orgasm nearing and grabbed John's hand through the fabric, guiding it towards his nipples. As soon as John got the hint and pinched one of them, Sherlock let go and plunged his hand straight down the doctor's pants and boxers.
If John had felt like he had an idea of what was going on, he had just lost it. Oh God, how did he end up here? Why was that man talking about candles? Was this supposed to be a date?
John excepted the familiar touch of a fingertip probing his hole. He expected the slickness of lube and he was very much looking forward to it.
John was surprised when his neck wasn’t sore at all when they woke up. Sherlock on the other hand was complaining about both a sore neck and an aching wrist. John got up and produced a painkiller for Sherlock and a cup of tea for himself. “Did you want some breakfast or do you think you can hold on until the dinner?”
The second show on Wednesday went just as well as the first, everyone seemed to know what to do already. John even managed to sneak to the edge of the stage and catch a glimpse of the ballet when Sherlock was on the stage, and he couldn’t stop smiling for the rest of the evening.
They looked at each other for what felt like minutes but was more like a fraction of a second, but then Crowley shifted and moved his hands up towards Aziraphale's crotch. For a few seconds, the angel looked like wanted to make some sort of a ridiculous protest, possibly in the lines of 'But Crowley, we're not in the bedroom!' or some other chaste romance nonsense, but then he spread his legs just a fraction, blinked slowly and groaned out a small "please".
“You’re brilliant,” John grinned, kissing him softly. Sherlock kissed back for a few seconds and then broke away. “You haven’t seen the gift part,” he mumbled quietly, taking John’s wrist and guiding it to the small of his back.
When everyone left, Sherlock and John cuddled on the sofa and listened to some relaxing piano versions of the Christmas classics. Eventually they decided to call it a day, which meant Sherlock dragging John to the bedroom and finally unwrapping his first gift.
"Is that... The case? The pink lady's case you kept insisting was there?" John was suddenly having a moment of doubt. Hadn't Sherlock said that the murderer had the case? How did it end up here? Surely, Sherlock wasn't...
But the idea wasn't forgotten, especially after John considered all the different tastes he could try and got the most twisted thought.
“Uh, right, so I was thinking. Maybe if you would like to, or want to – to get one?” John silently cursed his inability to be his normal, confident self about this. Instead he felt unnaturally nervous which was, well, unnerving. He kept his gaze downwards, stroking his hand idly across Sherlock’s legs.
"Yes, we're still on the case, that's Northumberland Street behind you. No, I don't eat while I'm on a case. Digestion slows me down."
“Put that thing down, would you?” John commented playfully, kissing Sherlock’s nose over the screen before walking to the fridge. “What do you want for breakfast? I recon the eggs are still edible unless you’ve decided to stuff the kitchen with yet another experiment,” he huffed. “God know this place is always full of test tubes and human organs - “
By the time the service is finally, finally, over and done with, Sherlock’s head seems to be weighted down with lead. He rehearses his speech over and over to keep his thoughts from straying into forbidden territory as he leaves the church. Distracting himself to the point of, well, distraction. And inattention to the fact that
Sherlock struggles to formulate himself. It feels painfully unsafe to bare himself like this. He feels horribly exposed, as though he’s slowly peeling away at his own skin to let John peer underneath. He would never have said a word of this to anyone else. These are his most intimate thoughts and feelings, usually locked safely away inside himself, but now forced out into the open and laid bare beneath the microscope for John to examine. Sherlock would have rather died than let anyone else catch as much as a glimpse of it. But this is John.
“I’ve been in contact with our parents. They’re on their way.” That’s all Mycroft says before he unceremoniously deposits himself in a chair opposite John’s, settles down to wait and lapses into silence.
Mary has been typing away for the past couple of minutes, but she gets up now, announcing apropos of nothing and to no one in particular that there’s no more tea in the pot. She passes John en route for the kitchen. He can hear her moving about behind his back, putting the kettle on and saying, again apropos of nothing and to no one in particular, that Sherlock’s experiments pose a health hazard and that he needs to move them further away from the food. John doesn’t know why it annoys him. He does agree, after all, and has told Sherlock the exact same thing on multiple occasions. Sherlock seems to neither mind nor care. He simply makes a sound that could be interpreted as either an affirmation or an indifferent huff and continues scrolling through a wine list from what looks to be a place that John and Mary can’t afford to purchase wine from, the results of Sherlock's investigation be damned.
Sherlock opens his mouth. But it’s neither the biting retort Mycroft had expected nor the hesitant acceptance he had hoped for.
“Did I what? Kiss you? Tell you what I wanted? You didn’t exactly invite me in, Sherlock. You… that first night, when we were out at that restaurant and I was trying to test the waters, you told me you were married to your work.”
Suddenly he can’t wait anymore. Reaching up, he practically rips John’s shirt open, pushing at it petulantly as if to magically make it go away. John obliges, quickly pulling it off entirely and throwing it away. It lands somewhere around the coffee table and neither of them care to check where.
John opens the door and looks around the familiar living room, expecting to find Sherlock either comfortably reclined in his chair with his violin or his laptop, wrapped only in a blanket or a dressing gown, or pacing the flat from wall to wall in a terrible state of agitation due to withdrawal. John is prepared for either sight. But there’s no sign of him. He might be in the loo, but John can’t detect any sound of movement or running water and the door isn’t closed. So he’s probably not out of bed yet and likely to be asleep still.
That fragile illusion is shattered the first time Mary calls. She hasn't phoned since the infamous incident a couple of days ago when she’d hung up on him during a particularly vicious argument. An argument about John’s level of devotion to Sherlock contra his level of devotion to Mary and their marriage.
Instead, John finds himself somewhat annoyed by her behaviour this evening. Her initial shock and disbelief had only mirrored his own and been no more than anyone could expect given the circumstances. But then she’d bloody gone and sided with
“John…” he says, but then he too falls silent. Perhaps he can’t think of anything to say either. He looks uncharacteristically insecure and yet there’s a fire and a light in his eyes that hasn’t been there in a long time.
