‘I’m an idiot.’ he observed.
It is much stranger than that, and much more painful than that, but it is a living, carrying pain, and in the end we make it through. Neither of us cares for death as much as we could, we’ve seen too much of it to have faith that cutting one thread will make things any easier. It’s like you said one evening, in lieu of an apology, and in lieu of the gratitude we both feel but struggle to articulate.
When we sat in the cab on the ride home, she slumped against me as the vehicle hit a curve and didn’t move away. I tried to analyse the feeling. It was comforting, the warmth, but uncomfortable, in that I didn’t know what to do. I might feel more, if I could just touch her. If I knew I could. If I could pull her against me, if I could feel the skin of her hand against mine.
I sat back up. ‘Sorry. Was I bothering you?’
‘Anything. Just you. You is... are… good.’
‘Sherlock?! What did my favourite beret have to do with a case of fucking eels?!’
‘Hey, hey, Sherlock. You know, things have changed a lot. It’s not the same as it was, what, six years ago. I’m not really… well, back then I was really looking for someone.’
‘Joan, I’m surprised at you!’
Sherlock, too, froze, her eyes wide opened.
‘At least 11, but you wouldn’t have been safe. He would have killed you, he-‘
The next time, I make it to you.
There was something that flickered across Sherlock’s expression. Concern, affection, understanding… was it… sadness? Even? Maybe not. It was hard to tell in the light. Then he smiled. It was a kind smile again, not the manic one. He got up, walked over to John and put a hand on his shoulder. John looked up at him. ‘I suppose I should get going. Getting’ late.’
‘Yes. And based on your responses this evening, I would be particularly keen to explore your capabilities for multiple orgasm. Not only would this help demonstrate the point I was making earlier about same-sex relationships, but I’ve been reading up on it, and I believe, Joan, really, will you stop laughing?’
‘Sherlock?’ his alarm at the sound overcame any desultory respect for privacy, and John turned the door handle, only to find an empty bedroom and an open window. In the distance, a seagull cried.
have occurred keep us up at night from time to time, we’ve found ourselves in one of the luckier ones. It’s one that allows us to ride out the nightmares on the tide of each other’s heartbeats, and one that’ll let us keep colliding until you’re as wrinkled as the washing you never do, and I’m greyer than the washing I do, and Rosie’s coming back for visits to tease us both about how ancient and out-of-touch we’ve become in our world. We make it through in perhaps neither the most artful nor dramatic of conclusions, stumbling towards each other, stumbling through our own admissions, at last, but we do make it there in the end.
‘You’ve said. And. I said. Don’t be. Not your fault.’
‘When you’re alone, in your room, like this?’ She curled her hand over mine as I caressed her, following my motions.
‘Catching on finally?’
Or she had finally decided it was time to entirely monopolise every aspect of my life, and thought she had discovered a brilliant new way to permanently eliminate my dating life.
‘Maybe. I don’t know. But this is the second time you’ve been wrong for the same reason.’
John thought he ought to say something, finished the thought he’d had before, before it slipped away. What was it? Ah yes, there it was, ‘I guess I was just thinking, what would’ve it been like if I’d stayed here with you all along?’
‘Well, aside from the tea-making… inclusive, actually, I’m the only one who does anything practical, plus I pay the bills, albeit with your case earnings, and you’re the one with any fashion sensibility…’
I shake my head.
Instead, in an instant, I felt the first tentative heat of her tongue, as it slid out to trace the same path her fingers had taken. Two slips, and she gave a little strangled sigh of delight. I realised she was tasting me. In tiny tickling laps, and broad slippery decadent silken sweeps, she was tasting me, mapping every centimetre of me with her tongue, and beautiful, glowing, kneading lips. It was liquid pleasure, it was terrifying, enthralling, inescapable. I was done for.
It was the fourth time I reached for the popcorn when I confirmed that, indeed, it wasn’t my imagination - Sherlock’s eyes had been twitching back and forth nervously every time I did. Every time I moved, actually. As soon as I realised it, I froze, hand still poised to descend upon the popcorn. I turned to look at her. Yup, she was staring like a startled meercat.
‘Should I erm, should I take my clothes off?’ Sherlock asked in a near whisper.
The Sherlock-shaped furnishing twitched in a nearly imperceptible wince, ‘John, I don’t know what-’
‘Thank you, Joan. Unnecessary, but thank you.’
‘No reason, really, thought it’d make it more interesting. Dresses get tedious after a while.’
Well, if she were a normal person, I’d say, ‘or she meant it’, but god, it was Sherlock. She couldn’t mean it. She never meant it, did she. I mean, she didn’t feel that way about people, did she? And if she did, it seemed more or less a snowball’s chance in Hell she’d specifically feel that way about me. I was her best friend. I knew she loved me, after a sort, and that she’d probably done a whole lot of Not Good sorts of things to save my arse, but then so had I, for her. She’d planned my wedding, for godssake. God, I didn’t even know if she liked women or men. I’d just always assumed. Well, that she didn’t like anybody, actually.
‘Oh. Is it…’ I glance at the baby bit.
) 'recently shot you. So if you say no, I don’t blame you… I just thought…’ you gesture in a rather broad sweep of air that takes in both your abdomen and the bag, and possibly four years of history between us.
We fall silent again.
‘Does it hurt?’
She rolled her eyes, ‘Impossible. I have ample observations from your previous relationships to indicate that you have adequate interest and skill range, in addition to your fixation on keeping your partner content, which I’ll admit I found baffling in the past, but have no problem using to my advantage now. In addition, while I was aware that you hadn’t taken part in this before, and certainly lack the same level of detail orientation as I possess, I was able to chart a projection of your oral dexterity from inference based on your speech patterns and articulation, your nervous habit of lingual-labial lubrication, in addition to-’
She flattened a burning palm against my chest, over my heart, then scraped it slowly across my sternum and up my neck, until my head was tilted upwards. Her fingers crawled their way between my lips and teeth.
‘Git,’ you fail to laugh, but fail to put any vitriol behind it either, ‘You know what I mean. All those years, in everything I ever saw myself doing, I never thought it would end up here.’
Nonetheless, you may notice the presence of a few of your more familiar Johnlock tropes, I was curious to see what they would be like with my femlock characters.
‘What?’
To punctuate, she put her glistening lips on mine and in went her tongue. A whole lot of it. The small part of my brain that was still online was wondering whether or not she was aware that she was, at this point, basically having sex with my mouth. With her mouth. Enthusiastic, slippery, dirty sex. If that in anyway makes sense. And then I realised I still didn’t know what kind of experience she had other than… kissing Sean (kissing Sean unenthusiastically, apparently, but no doubt with the same skill that was now focused on me).
‘Oh, yes, how could I have mistaken that?’
the only person who’s been subject of my compositions.’
She shuffled down into the couch like she was nesting there, and now beamed up at me with what could only be described as…
‘Eh? Whatever you want. I mean. You usually just… do it as you go along, you know? God, Sean really was useless wasn’t he.’
‘Do you really mean it?’ Sherlock asked quietly.
‘Maybe-‘ I cut her off before I got to hear exactly how many minutes and seconds I spent on other embarrassing post-date activities, ‘because I actually enjoy it.’
She flapped a hand ‘Yes. All of that. I don’t like it. Mostly. I don’t like… people, mostly. You know. I do… I mean... I think I could.’ She made a frustrated noise, ‘I don’t understand what it is, and it’s driving me utterly mad! Do you always feel like this? Do normal people feel like this?’
Ok, I’m spelling this all out clearly now, but at the time, all of this was a sort of crazed simultaneous cacophony in my brain, which horribly wasn’t that unfamiliar, just a new variety of the ‘is Sherlock insane, or am I’ debate which had been my mental bread and butter for about as long as I’d known her.
‘John, I was a temporary diversion for her, an interesting game. And likewise. I admire her cleverness, but that’s all.’
Sherlock finds out about Joan's online dating profile.  References are made to eels, among other things. Nobody is pleased.  Sherlock makes a proposal.
‘Ridiculous,’ I kissed the top of her head, and thought I may have heard her mutter ‘idiot’ into my collarbone.
It was obvious, wasn’t it. But then John was a bit of an idiot.
I couldn’t help but smile too.
Oh yes, I know. Because one of the things I’ve become very aware of, moving back here, is that I like companionship an awful lot, and the prospect of having to live alone again (at whichever point in the future Sherlock tires of me and runs off on some adventure, or assignment from Mycroft or, you know, finally mentions His Nibs the Government’s gateauphilia one too many times and has to go into permanent hiding) has become thoroughly unthinkable.
To no one's surprise except perhaps Sherlock's, Joan closes her dating profile.  Sherlock is momentarily confounded.  Joan lets her work it out.
The east wind blows through the Sussex fields, but all is quiet in the cottage with the bees.
Brilliant. Now she was my wardrobe consultant. I mean, I was going to wear it anyway, probably. It was that or the purple, left over from my more gregarious days when… well frankly I’d never worn it, and god knows I wouldn’t risk that in this kind of place.
I think about marriage. It seems like the right thing, a show that I’m heading in the right direction, heading away from the detour that was eighteen months of you, and before that, years of military.   Heading back to whatever kinds of dreams I could still have in whatever remains of the world I used to know.
John leaned back against the bricks, regarding the multitone grey sky as he waited for Sherlock’s brain to reboot. He could feel the warmth radiating from Sherlock, and wondered what it meant that he had always been able to feel it.
It was a familiar and unfamiliar sensation at the same time, familiar anatomy but someone else’s body, shuddering against my fingertips.
market.'
‘Hmmm?’
‘I… er… hadn’t considered that.’
lick them, because they were my bloody biscuits after all. Licking her fingers and her palm and letting her see how disgusting it was, and it would be messy and revolting as I bloody well liked, and if she even moved her lips I’d bloody well swallow those up too, just so she’d stop licking her goddamn fingers and…
She told me, you know, she told me I kept her right. That nearly broke my heart. And made it, maybe. Because she helped put me right when I didn’t think I’d ever feel right again. She was everything to me. The whole bloody un-astronomical Sherlock-centric universe. Sure I tried to fight it, but realistically, she was all the bits that kept it good. Things have been different since she got back, of course they were, they had to be. So much has changed and changed again. But here we are, back in 221B, and it isn’t half bad.
‘Oh’. I as much formed the word as said it.
I was still humming merrily to myself when Sherlock came home. She stopped in the doorway, scarf in hand and eyed the flat.
‘This,’ Sherlock gestured at the screen, ‘Netflix. And this,’ she gestured more vaguely at us on the couch.
You return my smile, ‘well, I figured since you’re really not smoking again at this rate…’
) 'and even if it wasn’t…' (
‘You said anything. Anything… I … wanted.’
‘Why not?’
Right, obviously. Benefits of being bony, I guess (
‘Let go, Joan, it’s Armani.’
‘What’s that?’ I assumed she’d wandered in halfway through a conversation with mind-palace Joan, who (still) magnanimously took over for me when I selfishly abandoned Sherlock to frivolous pursuits like ‘job’, ‘sleep’, or god forbid 'the toilet'…
‘Jesus you’re… really wet.’ I swallowed, fingers insinuating themselves between the folds of her skin.
’ he cringed out the word, ‘whatever they may be, then that’s, erm, a good thing. And I support you. It’s fine. I just think we need to talk about this, and get it sorted. I need you to work with me here, because I can’t… I won’t lose you. Again. Ok? I mean, to be honest, you’re … dammit… will you let me in so I can say this to your face?’
‘Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.’
Sherlock closed his eyes for a moment. It was getting easier, but never easy. It would never be easy. He put his hand on his friend’s shoulder, looked down into the old man’s face that looked back at him so trustingly.

Fucking Sherlock. Ah, sorry, not actually the verb, obviously. Bloody late. Should’ve known, actually – I’d got her text when I was halfway there that’d said ‘the name’s Fielder, by the way SH’. Should’ve known it meant that whatever she was up to had held her up, and I ought to go in on my own. It’s been half an hour, so I give the name and am let in. And it’s like a horrible crush of tall people, exactly as suspected. Oh well. Hopefully I will be able to hear my phone, hopefully will be able to elbow my way through the people, in case Sherlock’s business actually held her up in something actually problematic. I make my way over to the bar, trying to note something about the people on the way, not sure of where will be the most Sherlock-convenient place to stand in, pretty much hoping I get a text that says something to the effect of ‘Joan help, am trapped somewhere far away from the crowded posho bar, give up that plan and come at once SH’, but obviously that doesn’t happen, and there I am nursing a drink and taking cover next to an ornamental palm (happily the name ‘Fielder’ has an open tab, leading me to assume that ‘Fielder’ is actually Mycroft’s account, which Mycroft probably doesn’t know about it. Cocktail it is then).
answer, it just seemed like the correct one, the one I was meant to give. Obviously if Sherlock was coming on to me, if she ever did it again, if she
‘No, I really don’t,’ I conceded, without looking up from the crossword, ‘A9, “Romantic activity in vessel – after love, in short”, nine letters.  I’m thinking something to do with rowing?’.
Across town, a dying cabbie comes across a very peculiar blog entry on the distinguishing traits of tobacco ash, and wonders if life might give him something a bit interesting, before he goes. Someone to entertain him for more than a few minutes. It will, but he’ll still be ultimately disappointed by the man’s choice.
‘Yeah. Yeah. I did. Didn’t realise you noticed. Don’t know what I was thinking.’ I had pressed my lips once against her shoulder, all the freckle constellations scratched out by bright pink scars.
‘Right. Hey. Alright there?’
I worked my hands underneath her, gripping her body, and lost myself in her until her fingers dug into my arms, and her legs locked around me in a convulsing embrace, and I thought perhaps I might drown in her, but I would have been perfectly happy.
‘Not taking into account…’ she continued, but the rest of the sentence was lost – I saw her lips move, but the rest didn’t come out. She closed her eyes, lips still moving.
‘Yeah, well he did a pretty shit job at that didn’t he? Because how on earth did he think that taking you from me was doing me a bloody favour?! I mean he saw me, Sherlock, he knew me when you didn’t. After you… when you were gone. We met when I was still a complete disaster. You can’t even pretend he didn’t know what that would do to me!’
I bit off a hysterical laugh, ‘Ha. Yes. Clocked that.’ I was pretty sure clocking that had largely been what put me over the edge, ‘Up here, love.’
‘But. But. You did it because…’
‘Right…’
‘Of course it is. Her and her boyfriend, or whatever, the one who’s been having an affair via Grindr,’
‘Not exactly your crowd?’ I say to him. Smart cut that, his jacket. I can hear Sherock in my head
Your continued hesitance, and the slightly discernible stationary shuffle of your steps tell me you’re rethinking whatever your reason was for coming. After a moment, I hear the soft impact of cloth on wood. Staying then. And… interesting. Not the slap of your leather handbag, but a heavier, softer impact. A rucksack of clothing? I hardly dare hope.
‘Right. Right. Can I uh, can I buy you a drink?’
Sherlock huffed, ‘when have I
It was a vision of myself shouting ‘stop eating my bloody biscuits, and stop licking them off your goddamn fingers’ and slapping her hands away from their methodical activity at her mouth, and grabbing them and sticking them in my mouth, because if you wanted to lick your stupid fingers,
She was saying something against the corner of my mouth.
‘Trust me, I
Like in the tube. But god knows what she wanted this time.
) 'And I don’t even know- God!’ you gulp and look to the ceiling, eyes wide against their own bid at moisture, ‘I don’t even know who I married. I don’t know who he was, or who he is. I don’t know how much of that’s him. I don’t even know if this baby was really an accident or if he… did… something,’ you choke on the words, ‘did something so this happened. So I’d feel obligated. So no matter what I found out about him, I’d be t-trapped. Here. Because I’ll tell you, we were… we were careful. I thought we were. Careful. And we’re goddamn doctors. And now I’m immobilised. I can’t even run, you know? If I had to run, all I can do is fucking
‘Oh, I just mean, you know, girl crushes. And things. Normal things. I mean, I thought they were normal. For, you know, straight women. They might be. Just… well. I might not be. So straight.’
‘I know.’
Easy. Peasy. Not even requiring thought. No reason to feel uncomfortable about it.
‘John, it has come to my attention that I was mistaken.’
Sentiment is a ghastly minefield. It has too many variables to learn by rote, or to describe with any comprehensive sort of equation. I have often wished to rid myself of it. When it strikes (
‘Yeah. It’s… good, you’re…oh god…’ she had made another desperate noise as my fingers slipped over her. I could feel a tremor move through her body.
She rolled her eyes, picked up my hands and replaced them, ‘Silly Joan, of all the times to start thinking…’ and squirmed up closer to me.
‘Awful, Joan.’
Sherlock snorted, ‘why on earth would I want to engage in such a blatantly contrived bi-product of the pornography market, and one which you clearly wouldn’t be comfortable with?’
‘This will be far more practical. While I excel at multi-tasking, I nonetheless had to devote an inconvenient amount of attention to self-restraint and I fear I could have missed out on essential data.’
With women, I took up the role of sister, friend, doctor, confidante. I was the one that came to people’s rescue, and the handy tomboy around the house, I had that sturdy reliable look about me that meant most of my friends didn’t see me as competition, and I was alright with that. I could do things myself, and wasn’t afraid to get my hands dirty because, more often than not, I didn't have another option, so I figured I'd might as well be good at it.
‘Er. Right.’
Considering the circumstance however, I went and fetched the chocolate biscuits.
‘Joan,’ she murmured against my skin.
‘Eight hours? How you get anything done is beyond me,’ she protested, while, for all intents and purposes, arranging herself around me as though she planned to partake in the very somnolent pursuit she was so horrified by, apparently using my chest as a pillow.
‘I said I wouldn’t be offended.’
to come here dressed like this.’
Sherlock exhaled, his expression still that bittersweet mix.
No… Doesn’t actually seem to be though. And I know Sherlock has poo-pooed the notion of gaydar, but mine is generally accurate (she does still try to catch me out on it though – hasn’t succeeded yet).
‘Hey. I can help you get back to your room whenever you need it. If you need it.’ You must have seen it too.
‘Right sure. See you there I guess.’ I pondered the stockings.
She didn’t say anything. Right. ‘D’you want some?’ I gestured at the popcorn. No reaction. Excellent. I turned my attention back to the telly, wondering idly if the microwave
Sherlock looked away.
‘Good thing you fancy a cuddle, then.’
Either she thought I was an idiot, and was trying to use me for some experiment. Again. Maybe trying to get me to have some sort of reaction.
‘Good, because we’re already behind schedule, and I’d rather not be further delayed by preventable set-backs.’
The future seems more terrifying than it has ever been, because now I know exactly what there is to lose, and all of it's unthinkable. The irrational portions of my brain tell me desperately that if I extend my arm around you, it would somehow heal this void of uncertainty. I have built my trade on knowing things, but I don’t know if that would be welcome. I can tell you the chemical differences between 243 types of tobacco ash. I can call each of your bones by name. I know which of their surfaces are forensically relevant, so I would recognise you until you were reduced to ash, though I hope never to face that.
There had been enough times in the past where she’d be so brilliant, or so mad, or so ridiculously precious that I just wanted to grab her and squeeze her, like you might a normal person. Maybe. If they were either your boyfriend, or your annoying sibling who you happened not to hate. But I got the feeling that was not on with Sherlock. It wasn’t that she shied away from contact, god knows her respect for personal boundaries was a bit dodgy at the best of times, she just seemed indifferent to it, and wasn’t exactly a cuddly sort of person. Although to be honest, I sometimes got the feeling she might be if she ever got round to admitting it. Quite a few of the strops ended up with her curled up around the union jack pillow in a way that suggested a severe lack of things to hug. I wish I could say I couldn’t imagine a world where Sherlock was starved of affection, but I really could. And that was grim. If anyone could benefit from a bit of a cuddle now and again. Well, I personally thought most people could benefit from that.
‘I love this,’ she said, teeth scraping against my stomach, ‘delightful.’ I laughed, and she sucked on the skin. When she ran her tongue along the waistband of my pants I whimpered.
‘Woah, easy there. First off, I’m not trying to domesticate you, or whatever, and you know it. I won’t lie, I definitely appreciate the fact that we’ve been banned from considerably fewer of London’s institutions in the past couple years than at the start, but I thought you were bloody brilliant from uncensored Day One. Second, you know what, next time we do this, presuming you want a next time (Sherlock’s eyes went heavenward, as though beseeching the gods, or more likely her periodic table, to spare her from my general obtuseness) you talk all you bloody well want, ok? Because, with all due respect, whoever gave you the impression that you aren’t perfectly irresistible as you are can respectfully go fuck themselves with the nearest rusty object.’
,’ she breathed, the heat pooling from her lips to caress my skin. She drew the knuckle of her index finger up the contours of my… parts, then again with the pad of her fingers, dragging symmetrical paths up left and right, and then back down. It was the point where I’d normally turn my attention to the ceiling –life’s no porno, and I’ve no particular fetish for watching someone delve into my sex parts – but I couldn’t look away. Sherlock’s eyes were lit with a ravenous fascination I’d only seen her direct at the most convoluted of puzzles, the most locked of locked-room mysteries, the most inexplicable of aberrations, in short, when it was criminal Christmas. And now here she was unravelling me like I was all those rolled in to one. It was disarming. In all my encounters with, what I would call, a respectable number of chaps, including the one I disastrously married, I’ve never had someone look at any part of me with such bare captivation or delight.
Tomorrow, it would be thirty five years since John moved in with him for the last time. He had never moved out.
I figured one of us had to take the plunge, so I pulled back the duvet (thank god, nothing there but the sheet) and climbed in.
‘What do I think? I don’t know! What’s it got to do with me? What did you expect me to say, “oh congratulations, Sherlock, you’ve finally joined the rest of us in the human cesspool, why don’t we go and have a celebratory wank together”?’
Even before that, it had scared me to think outside of what I’d always been, because outside of that was Harry (who I knew I wasn’t) and it was people deciding that they maybe didn’t want you as their sister, friend, doctor, or confidante anymore. I should have grown out of that fear, with time, but it was buried so deep in my thought process that I didn’t. I wasn’t even really aware of it until now. Besides, I was privileged. I liked men enough, so I never had to think about what else I might like.
‘Hey cmon now,’ I said softly. Nothing more awkward than if she was going to be all polite about it. Bit sad, thanking people for kissing you, grim really, ‘Pleasure’s mine. Also yours… ideally.’
And then all of a sudden I was kissing Sherlock, and it wasn’t ‘quite nice’, it was fucking amazing. When I put my hand on her neck she made a little noise in the back of her throat and curled into my palm like she was a cat, and I could feel her little gasp in my mouth, and I thought, well in for a penny, in for a pound, and I saw if I couldn’t taste her bottom lip, and I could, and then there was her tongue, and her mouth, and I was probably insane but it seemed like the warmest, slipperiest most sickly delightful place I’d ever been. She was drawing me into her, and devouring me, and gripping my face with her hands, and whispering my name into my own mouth. And I was… I had my hands tangled in her hair, and I was allowed to touch it, allowed to run my palms along the satiny warmth of her neck, I and I didn’t have to pretend it was admiration, I didn’t have to wonder what it felt like, and it was brilliant, it was…
‘No, you haven’t,’ responded Sherlock, still regarding me as if I might suddenly sprout spare body parts and go squawking around.
‘I adore you, you bloody maniac.’
‘But… well… you must’ve been attracted to someone before, this can’t be completely new. What about Irene?’
‘Afghanistan, or Iraq?’
I opened my mouth. I hadn’t offered biscuits. In fact, the chocolate biscuits were my own supply, the ones I’d hidden in my chest of drawers lest they fall victim to Sherlock’s 3am sugar raids.
Oh fucking dear. So that’s where that went.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘At least it wasn’t eels. Beret, Sherlock?’
A few weeks went on uneventfully, and I sort of forgot about the whole thing. There had been the odd ribbing from Sherlock, the evening deduction of a few people on the dating website. Sherlock was keen to jump on the (one woman) bandwagon of convincing me that every single one of the men in the greater London area were unsuitable or insane, which, as the weeks went on, definitely reached the point of statistical improbability. I wanted to be annoyed, particularly when she’d pop out the laptop at breakfast with an announcement of ‘Unicyclist. Two time divorcee, hiding the fact he wears those horrid shoes with individual toes. Probability that he's a serial killer, 62.4%, causes death by suffocating people with his feet, no other logical reason to wear prophylactics on your toes.’ That was a gentle one. Honestly she spent more time on the site than I did. I wanted to be annoyed, but it managed to be somehow endearing. I mean entertaining. Whatever.
‘Well, obviously that seems to be the issue.’
‘You’re… not wearing a bra.’
‘Yeah. Yes. Very. Alright. Please don’t stop.’
‘The teal beret? Was it just because of the accident with the Whitechapel Barber, or is it part of a new headwear code for people of your age to signal to prospective partners that you’ve been pressured into this by your co-workers?’
‘Good. Good. Lie back, will you? Lie back… there. God you’re… you’re gorgeous, you know? I’ve always thought you were. Unbelievably. Ludicrously. Gorgeous.’ I ran my fingers across her eyebrows and cheekbones and lips, and kissed them, and that gorgeous neck. I could smell the piney sweetness of her shampoo, and the summery heat of her damp skin. The skin of her neck was taut and soft like a fruit against my lips, it was warm and pulsing and slightly salty, and I wanted to devour her. I moulded my mouth against her skin, and licked the delicate hollow of her collarbones, and pulled her nipples into my mouth until their shift from soft and silky to slick and hard was permanently emblazoned on my tongue.
He is tired of the world, tired of being bored, tired of the expectation that he’ll fit himself into some role, any role, that is too dull, and that he doesn’t understand. He has memorised all the patterns of appropriate social reactions, but it’s such a tedious way to go about living when you can’t actually see the point in it all. It’s like endlessly attending a church service for a religion you don’t believe in. He tries to remember a time when his unaffected personality didn’t breed discomfort in all those who surrounded him, and he can’t, and he should know, he has an excellent memory. But there’s no point to it, is there? No use in it. The world’s all dreadfully boring, and it doesn’t matter what he tries to put his mind to, none if it counts for anything, there’s no point in any of it.
‘Joan, your… pupils… are… very dilated,’ she enunciated rather haphazardly in between kisses.
‘Can you? or d’you want a hand?’ You’re so afraid to offend me with your help. If I were feeling vindictive, I’d pick it apart. But I’m not. Too sodding tired, for starters, although I know that’s not reason I acquiesce to your presence, and the offered shoulder.
'Buru- oh no, I don't even want to know.' I hadn't known Sherlock could read Japanese until earlier in the week, when I'd discovered an extensive search in my browser history involving vending machines and used pants. It probably reflected poorly on the state of my life that I hadn't even bothered questioning why Sherlock looked these things up.  Or why the more cringeworthy the item was, the more likely I'd find her commandeering
‘Ah! Shit. Alright?’
so much of a sociopath after all.
‘As it turns out,’ Sherlock was saying, ‘I may not be entirely immune to relationships of a physical nature.’
The door remained shut.
I find no further counter-evidence, and gulp the air in a manner which the outside observer may have likened to a fish.
I froze.
Now with artwork! The Johnlock kiss our OTP deserves.
‘Oh ho. You. You.’ I sucked in my breath. Just then I noticed something shifty about Sherlock’s expression. That little edge of off-ness tempered by a hint of desperation, like she was hoping I’d take the bait. Vindication! My hat probably hadn’t been near a chippy, much less any festering eels. But she was pretty dead set on making me believe it had. Right. I could deal with this. ‘This’ undoubtedly being a variation of the ‘Sherlock destroys Joan’s personal life’ routine, which was… actually not as depressingly familiar as it once had been. It’d been years now since I’d encountered anything of the sort, but then, it’d been ages since I’d even thought about dating.
‘I’m here, John.’
Ahah. Ha. Deep breath, Watson. We’re getting off topic here.
‘How is everything? Your pain meds holding up?’ Ah, looking for an excuse to stay. Not excuse, reason.
And then I reached around to shuffle my arms around her waist and… stopped.
‘And this?’ her voice was hazy.
She turned her forehead into my skin again, and muttered something into it.
‘I said,’ she pushed through her teeth, ‘Statistically speaking, women in same sex relationships are 13.1 percent more likely to achieve orgasm than women in heterosexual ones. That would give you a 74.7 percent likelihood of enjoying yourself not taking into account,’ she took a breath, her eyes still fixated on the wall, and fingers clenched so tightly around her gathered up knees, where she sat perched on her chair, that they looked almost skeletal.

Three years later, a young forensic technician smiles to herself as she leaves work, having just been promoted to senior lab supervisor. It’s not a cheery business, working in a morgue, but not everyone can do what Molly Hooper does. It used to bother her that she didn’t have a boyfriend or anyone to come home to, but lately the last three years have felt like a blessing. It’s nice not to have that horrid anxiety of knowing the person you fancy doesn’t give a toss about you, which is what always seemed to happen to her back when she was in uni and bothered trying to date. None of that now though, now she’s the youngest lab supervisor they’ve ever had, and she feels like she could take on the world.
But I couldn’t… I couldn’t…. I couldn’t make myself feel repulsed by it. By the thought of it. Not really at all. It just seemed natural, somehow.
and friends) is exceedingly proficient at locating a dead body, being capable of laying its eggs upon a corpse within five minutes of death, and sometimes, when open wounds or tissues are accessible, even anticipating death. (By ‘emphatically’, I mean ‘appeared in horrible experiments on several occasions at the breakfast table’).
‘As you say, Joan,’ she bloody well purred, and then her mouth was on me again.
John smiled, hell why not? ‘Just thinking… don’t know why I didn’t just stay here. All those years. Pretty plain as day I should’ve. Guess I am a bit of an idiot after all.’
‘Yes, anything.’ I tried to convey as best possible I what I meant. Without saying it. God save me from having to say it.
‘At the moment.’
Jesus fucking Christ.
I smiled wetly at her, ‘Just glad you’re… here.’
It is normally my role to administer short-lived and ill-used smiles, but after every point of levity, your face snaps back to its furrows of concern, as though the muscles have forgotten how to do anything else.
(3) Again, Sean is Janine, I've switched the gender. Kind of prefer Janine as Janine, really, so may change it back, but, what can I say, this was an experiment.
been host to some noxious substance after all, and Sherlock was just waiting for its effects to take hold.
She was studying me. I knew she was. There may have been a few moments in the past when I may or may not have conjured her up as I was alone in bed taking care of things (it was boredom, I’d told myself, over 15 years of coming up with your own fantasies and you eventually exhaust most of the titillating topics, so your definitely off limits but deliciously mad and sometimes half naked flatmate with a slight oral fixation is bound to come up). In these, a vision of Sherlock in observation mode had occasionally intruded to kill the mood by making some horrific deduction based the state of my pubic hair upkeep and effectively ending said fantasy.
Sherlock, now glaring at the wall, was muttering something.
‘Right.’ I set about fixing two cups.
me shag you six ways to Sunday?’
‘Yes, if the writing on your blog is anything to go by, I can only imagine the carnage,’ she said contentedly, burying her face deeper into my skin.
straight. I was so traditional. She was the different one. I was boring, I was heterosexual, I was probably upholding patriarchy and oppression just by being unfortunate enough to like men. And I got it, sort of. Those things Harry said to me were her walls, her protection, and the things she’d needed to sort herself out, and feel confident enough to stand up in her identity, stand up to our parents, and everybody else. Even if I didn’t find what she was saying fair to me. As the non-oppressed one, as a member of the heteronormative majority, I was pretty sure didn’t have much grounds to complain. I’d seen the other sides of her too, seen her crying after some of her school friends had stopped hanging out with her, stopped inviting her to their sleepovers, because when she said she liked girls, they heard ‘pervert’ and ‘creep’. And that sure as hell wasn’t ok. But Harry did what she needed to, and I did my best not to blame her, even if it still hurt me.
most brilliant mind in London, as far as I’m concerned. And my (ex)husband shooting the possessor of said brilliant mind, otherwise known as my best friend, the recently resurrected Sherlock Holmes is one of those things. What kind of person does that?
Comforting was the word, homely.
‘I…’ I could see her actually thinking about it. Of course she was bloody thinking about it. ‘Ah. No, I won’t. I… you are essential to me,’ she paused. ‘I may… I may… do it wrong sometimes, Joan. I’m not… you know relationships aren’t my… my area.’ It seemed she had been working out her own likelihood of destroying us just because it was in her power. She, and everyone else who’d ever suspected they were their own worst enemy, although few people had quite the skillset of offense that Sherlock had. On the other hand, few people would ever to go the lengths she had to preserve a friend’s life and happiness – once tapped, her well of self-sacrifice on my behalf was more like a geyser.
I had small hands, square sort of practical hands, but the features of her face still nearly fit between them. How could I ever have been stupid enough to gamble this?
I open my mouth. I hadn’t, but only because I couldn’t be bothered.
Still, I keep at this ‘trying’ business. I get myself a girlfriend. She’s a nurse. She’s colourful. Not luminous like you, but she’s got something… something that reminds me of you. Just a little. An edge. But I can’t put my finger on it, which is the only reason I can attempt, a little, with her. Mary, that’s her name. Most of the time she’s nothing like you at all.
‘John, whatever you’re thinking tastes like overblown metaphors.’
‘Er. Yeah. Sure. If you want. Go for it.’ I was pretty sure she’d already seen it before anyway. I leant up for a second and pulled off my top. Sherlock’s lips formed a little ‘o’ and I realised she hadn’t meant that, exactly. Shit, I must be nervous. Get a grip, Watson. Well too late now. I was silently thankful that the laundry cycle had forced me to wear a nice bra, rather than the tatty one I normally bummed around the house in.
‘Yes, thank heavens for small blessings. “Sherlock Holmes encounters Love”,’ he scoffed, quoting John’s (in retrospect, cringeworthy) summation of the case. Which Sherlock wasn’t supposed to have read, anyway. Still, John was well aware of the significant element of deflection in Sherlock’s monologue.
‘See, this is the second time you’ve been wrong about me.’
Six years, five months, and twenty-six days later, a former army doctor goes back to his bedsit for the last time. Ever since running into an old colleague from his medical degree, he’s felt increasingly overwhelmed by a sense of futility. The man had suggested he get a flatmate – a flatmate! As if anyone would want to live with with a madman with an illegal firearm who wakes up screaming every night or so. Mike had laughed, and shook his head, ‘Always had a sense of humour, Watson,’ and the conversation had dwindled on. Regardless of what his therapist says, the bare fact of the matter is that there is no job he can imagine doing anymore that actually appeals to him, not now that the nerve damage has devastated his skills as a surgeon. It’s GP or teach, and he knows both would drive him out of his mind. There’s no urgency there, no variety, nothing unexpected. Hell, much as he’s trying to get over the war, sometimes he thinks that Ella has it all wrong, that he misses it, even if the thought of it starts a drip of panic down his spine. In some ways, isn’t fear of a real threat better than certainty that nothing interesting will ever happen to you again? Over there, he had a purpose, a vitality, an awareness of the life that was pounding through his veins at every moment, precisely because the next moment wasn’t ever a sure thing. Now he can’t even afford to live in London anymore, and the city’s the only vaguely living thing left in his world.
There you are. My mind short circuits for a moment when I see your changed form, jacket opened on either side of your protruding abdomen. Stupid of me, I’d forgotten you were pregnant. Not forgot. It’s just the Joan in my mind hasn’t quite caught up. I doubt she will. I would liken it to the shadows in Plato’s cave, but it’s clearly somewhat of the reverse – she’s the shadow, and you’re the true form, regardless of whether that form happens to be host to a… well, someone else.
‘Next? Well, whatever we feel like, I guess. Whatever you like.’
The third time, a young man doesn’t miscalculate.
‘What? Wasn’t thinking anything…’
‘Shut up,’ I hissed, and the smirk caught the other side of her lips as well.
‘No, you don’t. On average, you spend at least sixty seven percent more time worrying about it than you do enjoying anyone’s company.’
‘Sherlock?’ I croaked.
Sherlock gave a beleaguered sigh, ‘Well, of course! Her loss would have been a waste of a brilliant mind. I’m not saying I didn’t find her… of value.’
An army doctor bleeds out in the desert. Two weeks later, an alcoholic sister drowns herself in one last bottle. When they find her, the engraving of her phone is imprinted into her face, where she passed out on it, a morbid epitaph to her failed marriage.
‘You’re so much nicer than Sean.’
I hold very, very still. Holding still is nice. It’s difficult to offend people when you hold very, very still. It makes them feel like they’re talking to themselves, rather than their emotionally stunted ex-flatmate with an itinerant heart problem.
Shut up, brain), ‘You know, if you lived off of more than air and biscuits…’
insecure.’
‘Sorry. Fine. Yes. Amazing.’ John pressed his face against Sherlock’s neck, and fought a terrible and unexpected tightness in his throat.
Maybe she wasn’t going to kiss me after all. Maybe she’d just occasionally study my face. Maybe she meant she wanted to conduct experiments on me. Maybe she was going to have me taxidermied and kept, just like Billy the skull.
‘Schedule for what? Is there some case I’m not aware of?’
‘Oh for fuck’s sake. Sherlock!’ John stormed to the window, and was relieved to find no one below it, at least. A thin film of smoke from above indicated that the room’s erstwhile inhabitant was, in fact, on the roof of the neighbouring room-extension. Cursing, John scrambled to crouch on the windowsill, coming eye to eye with the detective’s toes on the adjacent overhang.
‘Sure. Me too,’ he keeps surveying the crowd, ‘that’s the trouble with friends, isn’t it, they always drag you out somewhere.’
‘Right, but that’s not-’
‘Sherlock. I wouldn’t want to destroy that lovely sociopath image you’ve constructed, but in case you didn’t notice, we’ve pretty much been in a relationship from the day we met. It might not have been the kind with sex, but there’s been a whole lot of near death and nearer misses, and things that most people would never make it through together. You’re doing fine. We’re doing fine. Bit of a hiccup with that whole “fake death” thing, which I’d rather wasn’t repeated, for both of our sanity, but I’ve seen all sorts with you, and I’m not running for the hills. I’m not worried about us. Alright?’
‘Sherlock, I’m sorry I-’
‘Sorry?’ I hazarded, my longterm project to curb her habit of dark muttering overcoming my inclination that I wouldn’t like whatever it was she was saying.
‘Because that has been the absolute highlight of my evening, I swear, bloody brilliant Joan, did you really not recognise me that whole time? I can’t believe it!’
‘Joan.’
‘What do you mean, “informed”?’
‘I mean, I know my “
‘Interesting company?’
‘Of course.’
I mean, I’m sure in retrospect this will make an entertaining blog entry (no, really, I know it sounds sarcastic, but I really am sure). I’d probably be enjoying it now if now had involved Sherlock actually bloody being there. But instead, it involves me in some gopping dress from the back of the closet and some god-awful heels. Fucking lady shoes, because I said ‘how ‘bout these trousers and a nice blouse,’ and all I got was the eyebrow. I said ‘what’s wrong with trousers, trousers are fine, Sherlock, this is what I’d wear for a drink after work,’ and all I got was the eyebrow. ‘Flats?’
sort of friend. Female friend, flatmate, I mean, you know.’ He’s got nice hands, sort of long and elegant, with nice angular bits. Reminds me a bit of… I don’t know, something you’d see on a musician or something.
But then the topic kind of died, or I thought it had until one otherwise nondescript evening.
So without further ado, I’ve er. Yeah, I started a dating profile. It’s been up for about half an hour, and I pretty much hate it already. But. Well. Can’t wallow can we? Because it isn’t that I’ve been wallowing. Not really. Not at all in fact. I wouldn’t even say I miss Martin, exactly. Of course, I’m still affected by what happened between us from time to time, if by ‘affected’ you mean really fucking furious. But it passes.
No, seeing Mike was the last straw. He’s helping no one in the world, and holding out for nothing.
the furniture. Well, he was the furniture with one uncomfortable addition, which, it seemed, John was doomed to address.
‘Uh, why’s that then?’
Yet as your contours grow vague in the twilight, none of these facts amount to anything against the future.
‘I assure you, I have no idea to what you are referring.’ The the smallest, coldest voice in the world emanated from the direction of Sherlock's chair. John fought the urge to scream.
‘Not exactly, no,’ bit posh, him, not so surprising, ‘I don’t mind though, what about yourself?’
‘No, really, I feel like I owe you one.’
(See the end of the chapter for
I rolled my eyes, ‘At ease, maniac,’ and climbed off her. I gathered up my shirt and held out a hand to help her up. Despite her… somewhat transparent attempt at imperious bravado, she looked a bit fuzzy. She took my hand and was up with the slightest wobble. I saw her glance at our joined hands, then at me. That was an affirmative on the whole ‘neither of us have a fucking clue what we’re doing’. I tentatively lead her to her room. Which was a bit weird, seemed it should be the other way around, but never mind.  I was gratified to find that there were no mummified remains on the bed, just the accoutrements of a normal bed, thank fuck for that.
‘Erm. I found it. Well, a bit uncomfortable getting up.’ A lie of sorts. It is uncomfortable, but that didn’t stop me from having lunch with Magnussen, oh, weeks ago.
Affection. A really glowing variety of it.
‘Right. I er wondered that. I’m not. Exactly. Well, it’s not that I’ve done this myself either.’
As such, things went all a bit mad for the remainder of the weekend and it seemed like I’d barely had the chance to fall into bed before I was dragging myself back into work.  I arrived home after nearly an hour in the Tube (that miraculous form of public transport which senses the desperation of those within it and slows down proportionately to prolong their agony) and managed to heat up something vaguely edible, after which point I nearly wept with joy to see that there was indeed a space on the sofa for me to collapse and succumb to the delights of thoroughly mindless telly. I’d even discovered one seemingly undisturbed package of popcorn and, by some miracle, a microwave devoid of anything offensive, or recently disemboweled, so I took advantage of this spectacular collusion of circumstances and settled in for a well-earned bond with the couch and the latest season of the Great British Bake Off (which, to be fair, had aired months ago, but such was my life).
This was met by more nodding.
‘No. Not really, no. Not at all, actually. No more men, that’s the whole point of closing the profile, isn’t it.’
‘Yes, you were thinking so loudly Mrs. Hudson could probably hear you, and she’s a bit deaf in the right ear. I’ll have you know I-’ she heaved out a breath. I felt it against my diaphragm, ‘This is not one of the areas where I have much… particular… expertise. At all.’
The last time it isn’t my story to tell.
‘Yes, I’ve wondered for ages.’
‘Dunno, didn’t feel ready for it.’
She sighed, ‘Oh I will Joan, you’ll tell me. You’ll tell me everything, you always do,’ she was really just breathing around the syllables now.
‘But I want to know. I want to know everything.’
‘and I think…’ I continued, ‘well, I think this is it for me. If that’s alright by you. There’s not going to be anyone else for me. Not sure why I ever thought there could be. Just you.’
‘With women. Jesus. Unless there’s something else you haven’t told me.’
Sherlock laughed outright, and licked a stripe all the way up the top of my (slightly fuzzy) thigh, before settling back into her previous position.
I tried to think of a thing to say. I waited for Sherlock to say something. I opened and closed my mouth a few times. I then came to the conclusion that the best thing to do is to pretend nobody had said anything at all. Yes, that was the ticket. A few seconds more, and it would go away. In a moment, I decided I was safe to go into the kitchen without the topic following me, so I walked over and calmly put the kettle on. Yes. Lovely, predictable, nonconfrontational tea. Everything is normal.
Across the city, NSY begins to breathe a collective sigh of relief as, in the weeks that follow, the suicides some nut jobs tried to brand as murders finally end.
More shuffling steps. A tap at the doorframe, as if I can’t hear you breathing there.
‘What? Why? I just… I mean. Oh bugger. Sherlock, you know I appreciate what you did. What er… effort you put into making sure Martin and I well… talked… and I saw… it’s just. Things are a bit complicated, at home-‘ (
laptop for the cause.
bloody biscuits!).
.....
done something I didn’t want to do?’ Which was true, although I was still a bit concerned about her whole ‘body is transport’ philosophy. Along with the fact that I was still in a bit of shock that she actually liked sex things. And that she’d specifically choose to direct them at me.
I manage to dip my chin, but your forehead is already gathering up in one of its myriad variations of concern. You haven’t taken off your coat, so whatever it is, it must be serious. You’re half expecting me to turn you away. Stupid. Or maybe you’re expecting yourself to back out.
She had a sort of insatiable restlessness to her, and kept moving from my lips to my neck to my jaw and eyes and ears, and it was making me a bit dizzy, but I found I really didn’t care.
Sherlock has suggested that Joan would be better off with her.  Joan finds the idea won't leave her alone.  This is all internal monologue, but don't worry, things will happen in the next chapter!
‘John. John? John. Stop saying “oh god”. Are you alright?’
Still no beta, so apologies for any hideous grammatical errors, which I shall try to remove in due course.  This is my first ever public erotica bit so comments welcome, as ever.  Happy festive-seasonmas.
I didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry, ‘er, thanks, I guess.’
Only, the girls at work didn’t know about that. Not one of them. I’d been off work then anyway, when Sherlock had been shot. And then I was off a bit more when she reopened half her stitches and needed to be dragged back to hospital. I’d imagined that’d been in the news, but I wasn’t looking at the news then. Too busy worrying about my best friend flat-lining in front of me. Again. And shortly thereafter, I was too busy worrying about escaping the nightmare that had become of my marriage and, a bit further down the line, escaping the semi-detached construct I’d shared with someone I thought had been Martin Morstan. I mean our flat, not the marriage. Although same concept, I suppose.
‘Well, I can’t drink Earl Grey all the time. I mean, I could. But I’ll live.’
‘Jesus, Sherlock. He fucking shot you. My husband fucking shot you. And now I’m fucking expecting, and it’s too late for me to…' (
had kept him coming here. There were stories they shared, he and Sherlock, and then others, ones from before he had been there, ones from when he hadn’t been around. Hours and hours of storytelling of laughter and honeyed tea (mainly Sherlock’s – John didn’t abide by sweet tea, but he’d have the honey on occasion to humour his friend). So many stories, so many words, so many times he’d watched the light of the day move round his friend’s face, afternoon softening into evening, the different hours of the day flickering across the smile lines, and surprise lines and ‘oh!’ deduction lines now etched on his companion’s face. Wherever they were, in the folding chairs out in the garden, or on the sofa when the weather wasn’t fair, you started to feel like the universe was moving around him, and that made John laugh – that’s how Sherlock had always thought it worked, wasn’t it, sun going round the earth. So maybe the universe had really fallen into place now.
‘Thank you.’ My, that’s cracked. I don’t know when it was that I last spoke properly. ‘I’m… yes, that’s…’
‘He wanted to protect you from being hurt.’
‘Hasn’t hurt me? Sherlock, he shot you! He bloody shot you!’
‘Hey, Sherlock?’ I tried, ‘Sherlock, you alright there?’
‘I’m not cuddling, I’m taking advantage of the benefits you offer to my limbic system,’ she would have sounded more scandalised if she hadn’t been contentedly worming her way even closer to me, so our legs were now knotted up as well.
) ‘and I know you said he wasn’t really trying to kill you, but after everything, I mean I saw your scans, you were dead on that table for two minutes, so I can’t say I entirely buy it, and I’m still just so angry!’ the teacup hit the side table, and we both jumped, ‘Sorry. So angry about it all. And I don’t know how you expect me to trust him- you- either of you- at the moment. But.’ You take a deep breath, ‘Well, seeing as how you’re the one who hasn’t shot anyone I care about recently, I thought I’d feel in less imminent threat of my life if I stayed with you. For a bit. Just til I… sorted through things.’
‘Well, she wouldn’t be the first person whose head you turned, what with the cheekbones and all that. She said it herself.’
Sherlock snorted, ‘I thought as much.’
‘Oh, I see. Just my nightmarish physicality as a whole. Brilliant, John. How very mature of you to argue semantics,’ Sherlock spat, savagely. What with all the smoke hissing through his teeth, John fancied he looked a bit like a petty, but rather vicious dragon.
‘Right. Yeah. Erm. About that. As it turns out. Not actually. Quite as straight as.’
‘It’s ok if you don’t want to. You don’t have to do anything, if you don’t want. Please don’t think… Listen, I’m gonna be here, even if everything just goes back to how it was yesterday, ok?’
a man. Sorry to disappoint.’
She may have heard me, because I suddenly became aware that she was squirming slightly, grinding against my thigh. I also realised that I was pretty much doing the same thing. And that… that was a thought.
Sherlock disappeared, clearly a bit miffed she hadn’t sorted it. I hadn’t realised she’d come back into the room until I heard her speak. As it turns out, I had dozed off. She was back in her chair, across from me.
‘Yes. That’s it! How brilliant! Of course, in all the spare time I have between solving cases, doing my research and looking after Rosie, I have, obviously, had ample time to peruse the cesspool of London’s population and find a prospective mate. How sparklingly observant, John. Why does the Yard even need me, when they have your towering intellect with which to consult!’
‘I guess. I don’t really mind. Keeps things interesting.’
Oh yes, I was definitely done for. When she delicately sucked my

Sherlock took in a breath. ‘So that’s it then? You’ve had your little say, and now what, we ride off into the proverbial smog-tainted sunset? Would you even
bedroom. Crawl onto his half of the bed, curl around John, watch his breathing, his silver hair in the moonlight, the creases and fissures in his expression that no amount of dreaming could erase now. John would turn towards him in his sleep, he always did. If Sherlock put his arm around him, John’s hand would find his, hold onto it until morning.
Consider starting a conversation with the palm tree, check the phone, survey the crowd again. No one seems particularly dodgy, or anything useful. There are a particularly high percentage of well dressed men here. Loads of them bridging on the ridiculously young, which is somewhat disheartening (I must be getting old. Am I getting old? I never used to notice people being too young, and now they’re everywhere). Actually, now that I’m looking around, I notice there’s a smartly dressed chappy with a trendy, stubbly sort of beard just down the bar from me who’s clearly doing the same thing I’m doing – staring off into the crowd and avoiding people. It makes me smile a bit – always a relief that you’re not the only crazy one in the house. I check my phone again. Still no word from bloody Sherlock. I send her another text. ‘Still inside, let me know when you get here. Alright?’
Another ten minutes of the program went along and then I felt something wet press gently against my neck, accompanied by a thrill of delight that made itself known all the way down my spine. I froze. It happened again. I attempted to restart my breathing. Sherlock’s mouth continued a delicate progression tracing the soft bits of my neck and collarbone. By the time she had made it to the bit under my ear, I was as goosefleshy as a Dickensian Christmas dinner. I had no doubt she noticed. She must have been well chuffed.
‘Is this… is this what you do Joan?’ Sherlock whispered raggedly.
It bothered me more than it should have done, that conversation with Sherlock. I found it following me around in the days after, asking me horrible questions like: ‘what if you were wrong’ and ‘what if she
She smiled and nipped my thumb, ‘Sentiment.’
I was just wondering why I still had my bra on, when Sherlock reached round and unhooked it. First go. Another thing about being with ladies, I guess.   I manoevered my arms out of it and she laid back looking at me. I had the slightly hysterical notion that I was probably witnessing the creation of a mind palace room for my tits.
'Yes of course it is, keep up. He thought he'd solve his financial problems by tapping into Europe's
I thought I’d got off fairly easy, from Sherlockian standards. I was almost disappointed. Not like I wanted her to convince me to close the profile. Or sabotage it, say, hack into my account and take it down, or anything like that. Ha. Why would I want that? Because that would be invasive, and then it would just be me and her in our tip of an apartment with a bunch of cases forever and no one to interrupt. Which would obviously be really bad… for definite reasons… which are… ok, not actually occurring to me at this moment.
‘I’m sorry to have caused your revulsion, believe me, if there was a way to terminate this reaction, I would have already employed it. Consider the conversation over.’ Sherlock rose and was out of the room before John finished processing the sentence. The bedroom door slammed.
‘Sherlock, please,’ he spoke to the door, ‘I didn’t mean- You’re not repulsive. I know you can’t actually control… that. I’m not blaming you. Actually I don’t… I don’t mind. If you’re feeling more erm comfortable with your, er,
. Whether it would seal the matter or condemn it, he was unsure, but he felt certain it had to happen, and now. Before he could coax his lips to do anything more than grope at the words, Sherlock had perhaps seen them, or read his intent, or, what the hell, his face was already between Sherlock’s sizeable hands, and they were breathing in each other’s air, so it didn’t take a genius to deduce where they were headed next - oh.
‘Hey? Sherlock?’ I petted her hair, willing her to look up.
‘Thank you, John, I’ll add them to the list,’ hissed Sherlock, puffing viciously on a cigarette.
‘But Joan, it’s been years. Normally your dating patterns are much more frequent, for example, you-’
‘Uh, thanks, already have one. Next round?’
Gun? Probably (another annoyance with dresses). Also flats in the handbag, just in case. I would risk Sherlock sneering at the handbag for that, and forever rue all those idiots who think anyone in their right mind would go for a sprint in heels. Forget it. I had the misfortune of attempting it once, early on in Sherlock and my acquaintance, and that was an entire film genre and a half ruined for me, not to mention the shoes, and nearly both ankles.
‘Fascinating,’ said Sherlock. I decided that, from her, it was a compliment. She rolled me over, started on my neck, and progressed her way down my body, in a process that was half mouth, half her rubbing her face against my skin. She’d also taken to licking bits of it, which was… incredibly arousing. And frustrating.
‘Because I can’t be arsed. Because I can’t imagine explaining what we do to anyone else. Because I don’t want to have to split myself in pieces again. Because I’m happy with this here. At the moment.’
‘Sherlock.’
But it’s been a while. Quite a while. I’ve been back at 221b for well over a year now, and it’s even longer since Sherlock managed to evade the old Eastern European death sentence (second eastern European death sentence, I should say, not that I knew about either until after the fact). While that had all been part of Sherlock’s well-meant but ill-thought-out determination to save my marriage, in reality, it had been even longer since I’d known, deep down, that things between me and my wonderful, down to earth, lying, ex-assassin husband were hopelessly irreparable. Because there are some things that no amount of rationalisation can fix, even from one of the most brilliant minds in London. Hell,
I figured I wouldn’t mention it to Sherlock, that I’d closed the profile. Thought she might be a bit smug. I felt only relief of having it done. A horrible pressure off. I’d decided. None of that for now, just concentrating on the things that genuinely made me happy. And if that happened to be tea, and a crossword, and Sherlock. Well, so be it.
It really warmed the cockles, to think that somewhere amidst the bunting and baking-tent of tv land, five amateur bakers tipped their mason jars, hoping to create a jam worthy of Mary Berry’s Victoria sponge, while here in the domestic haven of 221B, Sherlock perched at our worktop, scrutinising her own mason jars, which contained samples of hair that appeared to be melting, at different rates, into unappealing jelly-like tentacles. Who was that fool that said you couldn't have it all?
Then Sherlock was back to kneeling in front of me. I realised I was bracing myself against the chair. I thought maybe I should stop, but I couldn’t think of what else to do. I could see her eyes flicking back and forth, I could see the fleck of discolouration in her right iris, I could hear her sharp, shallow little breaths. I realised I might not be the only one who was terrified. I closed my eyes.
‘I’m… fine, Joan,’ she said, and smoothed her dressing gown with a prim little gesture ‘I… thank you.’
‘Thanks, I wasn’t feeling

You take a sharp breath, and purse your lips, ‘I don’t want to talk about this anymore.’
between her lips, I nearly wept with pleasure. When she unabashedly slid her tongue inside me, I felt more exposed than I ever had in my life, but could do nothing but quiver into the unthinkable, wet decadence of the intrusion. Her thumbs were pressing symmetrical spirals into the uppermost reaches of my thigh, and some idiot was gasping an overture of sounds vaguely resembling the names of deities, and ‘Sherlock’. Oh god, that idiot was definitely me, and definitely wasn’t stopping anytime soon.
Not that I'd been able to put ‘interests: chasing maniacs around crime scenes’. Thought that might attract the wrong crowd.
I coughed. ‘I don’t do that.’ I did.
‘Wha? I wasn’t-’
No…it’s… it’s me again. Well, it’s you, and then it’s me, and then it’s you.
The problem was, once I’d opened the Pandora’s box (‘It was a jar, Joan. In the original legend, it was a jar, that’s why the killer, whose first degree was in classics, left a
‘Ugh, you can come in Joan, you know. I already said that.’
‘Yeah, no worries. I could go for a lie down myself, actually. Don’t really fancy eating.’
I imagined her lips, her fingers. I could do that. They were pretty lips, I’d always thought they were pretty lips.   I imagined her wrists. I’d admired them, the way they shifted from smooth veins to sharp angles when she played violin, and typed like a maniac. The soft white skin that I’d gripped once, trying to find a pulse. I could kiss that.
‘But. He hasn’t hurt you. You’ve lived with him for ages, and he hasn’t hurt you.’
‘Yeah, just like this.’
‘No, I. Sherlock, I do not hate your legs.’ John backtracked, feeling unbelievably juvenile, and slightly choked by the cloud of smoke billowing from Sherlock’s cigarette, ‘or any other bits, for the record.’ He settled next to Sherlock, where he had perched with his back against the discoloured bricks.
‘Oh come on, it’s a disguise. I’m getting a bit recognisable thanks to your little blog, but I find the gender switch always really throws the unobservant. It worked on
. You’re good. You taste like… you. It’s delectable.’ Nice tasty, kissable word that.
The first time, I don’t even make it home.
‘Oh no. No, no. We are talking. And if I die in an attempt to climb up on this roof, that is all on you.'
mean it, I’d just explain, like I’d done years ago that she wasn’t my type. My type being men and all.
‘What about?’ John looked up from his laptop with mild alarm. Given that Sherlock was in his chair, Rosie was at nursery, and it was a caseless Tuesday morning upon which nothing was eminently on fire, haemorrhaging, or detonating, John could only hope that Sherlock's error was distant and, ideally, minor.
‘I’ve a thought. Can I… Can I put my mouth on you?’
‘Sorry, Joan,’ she turned to me, and I saw she was nearly weeping with laughter.
‘I’ll just drop this, then how ‘bout we get you into the sitting room. I picked up some tea from that place down the road.’ (True, though particularly unnecessary choice of supplies- it’s the only thing we always have in.) (Interesting.)
‘Ok, fine, I’ll say it to the door. You’re pretty much the fucking love of my life, as things go. So, er, yeah. I don’t know what you were hoping for here, but I’m, er, not leaving, if that’s what you were worried about. Though if this even turns out to be another one of your tricks to get me to say nice things to you, like you did in that fake tube car, I will absolutely kill you, Sherlock.’
‘Yeah, sure, you love it,’ I said, happily discovering a rogue pillow near at hand to whack her with.
You shuffle in and sit on the side of the bed.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Of course it’s not the water, it’s the cups – arsenic glaze, common with historical glaziers, but usually only released with acidic beverages!’ She’s grabbed me by the face as she’s exclaimed it, one hand on either side, her hands tangled a bit in my hair. This isn’t the first time she’s done it, and on occasion, I’ve had to go for a squashed ‘ok, well done, you’re squishing my face, let’s hear why’, but this time she bounds off without prompting. This time, though, I miss bits of how exactly the family came by arsenic glazed cups because I’d been caught off guard and can still feel the imprint of her hands tingling warmly on my face. It could have been a thrill, or the ghost of a thrill. It could have been nothing. My heart was beating from the whip of the chase, from the whirl of deductions, from the momentary surprise of having my face suddenly clasped in someone’s hands.
He spent a lot of time in Sussex now, in Sherlock’s cottage, with the bees. His old chair was there, still somehow kicking through the years (‘chair's almost as faded as I am’ he’d joked). He liked it still, it was short, like him, especially now that he was older, he’d started the inevitable shrinking process.
She put both hands on my shoulders and pushed me off.
When I came back she had rearranged the pillows into something vaguely orderly.
‘Horrible. Just horrible.’
‘You know those are fairly normal symptoms right?’ I said. I mean, she had to know. How could she not know?
‘Harry? Fuck! Sherlock! I don’t- I don’t bloody want to stay with Harry! I want to come home! I mean, I want to stay with you, If you’ll have me.’
‘What? No.’
) when I faked my own death, and now my recent miscalculations have put fissures in your marriage – the one thing you managed to salvage out of those years. It’s the least I could give, I guess, to leave you to that.
‘Because… because it’s what I like more than anything. As you may have noticed. And I think if I had a choice, I’d rather that than somebody messily getting me off with their stubby GP fingers.’
‘Are you even dressed?’ Of course I was.
Sherlock snorted, ‘I have a far wider conversational range than anyone you’ve selected to go out with. If you want to converse with someone over supper, I’ve made it clear that I am willing to accompany you, even if I don’t particularly feel like eating. I stop on cases for you, Joan, for your stomach.’
She had sat back a bit and was, again, looking at me with calculated fascination. She pushed my legs apart some and settled between them, tilting her head this way and that. She trailed her fingers up and down my calves and then up my thighs. I was holding my breath at this point and felt about as naked as I had ever felt in my life. Her fingers skated up my inner thighs and drifted over my pubic hair, just barely touching it. She smiled a little.
John coughed, ‘Yeah well. She clearly had a thing for you, no point in denying it. Has a thing, probably.’ He gestured vaguely in the direction of Sherlock’s phone.
‘So this doesn’t bother you then?’ she said, lips against my well-honed collection of upper leg cellulite.
‘But no fingers in the crisper.’
‘Right about that,’ I muttered and shimmied up her chest a bit, ‘alright, now I’m going to kiss you a bit.’
‘Good. God, no, I didn’t mean- I know you’re not. I just meant. If there’s another sensible explanation, then for god's sake please enlighten me now, so I can end this frankly nightmarish conversation.’
‘Sherlock!!’ I barked.
‘Do you want to… I believe it’s customary to ask if you… would like to talk about it?’ I try.
‘Fuck you, goddamn it Sherlock! You fucking bastard!’ I punched his shoulder. Her shoulder. Fucking ass!
‘What am I saying, of course you’ll make me bloody say it. Sherlock. Holmes. God help me, may I never have to say this again. It has come to my attention over the past few weeks that my proximity apparently makes you hard. Ok?’
‘Joan.’
‘That was a haircut. Not an accident, Sherlock,’ I reminded her. Again. As if she didn’t definitely already know, ‘A haircut that I happened to have done in Whitechapel. And that is my favourite beret. I look good in a beret,’ I added, injecting a bit of Captain Watson into my posture. She’d have to try harder than that to make me horribly regret ever putting the thing up. Not that I wanted her to try. Or …needed her to, for that matter. Plenty of self-generated regret.
None of it makes any sense, still. I don’t understand how you can love a person, and do the very thing which hurts them most, though I’ve managed that, and I don’t know how you can laugh in a way that is really weeping, and screaming, but we did that. In that tatty sitting room, we laugh something that is really anguish, is grief for the hopes that this year has dragged into the ground, and all the hopes of our past that went into the same fire grate as Magnussen’s piss. It is the sound of our footsteps on rooftops to which I can’t take you anymore, and nights we won’t run in together, and the electric thrill of ‘god, yes’, that might never pass your lips again. It is the sound of my fear that the glint your eye will never return, and that it will never again be the two of us, like it used to be, the two of us against the rest of the world. How could it? We’re not even two now in this room, we’re three, and anyway, you haven’t chosen me. You never will.
‘Oh god, you have. Right. That? That’s a bit not good.’
‘How about I let you deduce it, eh?’ Oh yes, I was more than content with this madness, screw dating.
So he doesn’t miscalculate.
(2) Joan may not always be the paragon of body positivity, but Sherlock is a fan, as are we.  Long live Joan's gloriously amorphous stomach-hip-thigh zone!
Then you’re next to me, curled up in parallel contours. Spinous process of the C5 vertebra 26 centimetres from my eyes, give or take the width of a breath. If we were closer, I believe the colloquial term would be spooning, but there are millions and millions of cells and atoms between us, and I am dreadfully aware of every one of them in this moment.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Oh, and Joan, you’ve still got chocolate on your chin.’
‘I er… I love you too, you know.’ I whispered, after a moment, my lips against her hair. The only response I got at first was the tightening of her hands, which were around my waist. Then I felt her lips press gently against my ribcage, hovering directly over my heart.
John took a breath, ‘It’s to do with me, isn't it. That’s why you told me.’
‘Tindr,’ I corrected, she never got them right.
He turned towards me, and I saw that he was smiling, no, laughing, almost collapsing on the bar really.
Sherlock’s lips joined his, and John was flooded with giddy relief, that it worked, that it wasn’t awkward, that his limbs felt on fire, though possibly that was due to the awkward angle, that his body had finally cottoned on to the fact that Sherlock was
I turned her on her side and rolled her against me and reached round her hip and slid my fingers through the auburn curls at the crux of her legs.
But it doesn’t go like this.
‘I’m finding your stubby GP fingers more than adequate. But yes. Anything.’ She squirmed around and captured my mouth in a kiss whose haphazardness suggested how far gone she was. I worked my way down her body, making sure to pay at least cursory homage to her ribcage (more biscuits advised), navel (shivery, delightful), outcrop of hipbone (more shivering), and the nearly invisible filaments of hair tracing down her stomach (nearly invisible, lucky sod).
Problem was, it did feel uncomfortable. Even the thought of saying it felt a bit wrong. It brought about a sort of horrible twisting in the pit of my stomach,
Sherlock said nothing.
John shrugged.
‘John. Please. Irene is gay. As in, a lesbian. As in, does not fancy men, regardless of her trade.’
Sherlock shimmied up my body, fingers ghosting over my clit as she slid them out of me.
mean it?’ and ‘what would you do if she did?’.
I don’t even make it out of my bedsit.
Once I’m settled on the couch, you bustle off to fetch the tea, and some slightly travel-battered biscuits.
‘Not your fault.’ You look at me, ‘No. Sherlock. Listen. It’s not your fault. It isn’t. This is on him.’
When morning came, I was surprised, but not really, to find the bed still populated by one mad consulting detective currently drooling enthusiastically onto my collarbone.  It was the first of many firsts, thought by no means the end of others. While I often, in future, woke entangled in Sherlock’s limpet-like embrace, our home was never a stranger to 4 am experiments, police summons, or insomnia-induced violin interludes. However, on this day, I woke for the first time, perhaps in my whole conscious life, with the contentment of knowing that all the things I loved best were in one place, and that place was with me, and that place was home. Anyone who reads up on our cases will know we haven’t lacked in excitement or incident, but through it all, I’ve never had to wake up as one divided again, and that is worth everything.
‘Yeah I do. I know. I do.’ I babbled, fumbling to weave my fingers through hers, hoping she’d know that I did know, hoping she’d know I
I may have whimpered a bit.
‘No. Joan. I’m definitely
‘So you’d take a drink from someone you hadn’t even looked in the eye.’
‘Hey, it’s ok. I kind of didn’t know either. I mean, maybe if I hadn’t been such an idiot. For… well… ever.’ My heart was doing a crazy thing, like it was dancing to a fiddler on speed. I was fucking terrified.
‘Sorry, sorry. Can’t well say no to that, can I? But if that’s what you had in mind, I’m going to need a full eight hours minimum,’ I shuffled down under the duvet, enjoying her look of horror.
I was reminded again of how very, very nice it was to feel her breasts against mine. And her skin, in general.
John blinked, veritably dizzy now. ‘I love you,’ he choked out.
‘No news.’ I hummed, pleased to have her stumped, if but for a moment.
(4) I owe this phrasing to several works in the fandom I've come across, mainly apliddell's 'The Only One in the World; I Invented the Job'. I have no idea if this phrase ever pops up in the actual canon, but it caught in my brain.
‘I may not stay here all night, I don’t always sleep.’
‘Oh and Joan?’
Drawing back for a second to look at her, I caught the febrile tremors fluttering through her eyelashes, the lucidity of her closed eyelids , and it the sight in it’s fragility of it made my throat catch. Why had I thought to leave this beautiful, breakable thing? Why had I assumed it would always be alright, that of all things, Sherlock would be permanent, and therefore, could be assumed, could be – nearly – wasted?
Not that any of it wasn’t interesting. It had been good, and he felt almost full to the brim with happiness, happiness being a sort of golden thing, like a jar of honey, actually. Yeah, he’d take that metaphor, and Sherlock could grumble about it as much as he’d like. Hell, they both knew the grumbling was just another part of it. Of fun, life, appreciation, friendship, love.
‘Have you been out of bed much?’
‘I can’t… I can’t stop thinking, I just never thought I’d be here,’ you say, after a time.
‘What, you’ve made a chart?’
‘Sherlock, you in?’ ah, that’s Captain Watson, then. Got your courage back up. For…whatever it is you think you need it for.
The topic had not come up again, and I could not imagine a scenario in which I would realistically bring it up to Sherlock.
‘Because you… you kinda don’t sound alright?’ I had a sudden flashback to the incident years ago in Irene Adler’s sitting room where Sherlock had just gone… a bit blank, ‘Hey, it’s ok if you want to… stop. We can, you know, take things slow.’
‘It’s Tarry Souchong.’
‘Yeah?’ I croaked.
It’s you on a roof, saying ‘
‘Oh, uh, just checking… for my friend.’
‘John I have saved you countless times. And vice versa. More than you know,’ he paused, glancing up before adding, with a pointed look, ‘and she is
Sherlock opened his mouth, then closed it. ‘You were the one who suggested we ought to attempt this whole transparency concept.’
‘Whatever you like.’
(1) Joan's reading out one of the cryptic crossword clues, in case that isn't obvious
Ahem. It’d been a good long while since it all went tits up with Martin. And the baby that…well. Wasn’t.
I wanted to laugh. I wanted to scream. I wanted to yell at her and ask what the fuck she was saying, what she bloody wanted me to do, what she was even suggesting. Because it sounded a hell of a lot like she was suggesting… like she was… like she was coming on to me. And show me a world where
You pop your feet up on the duvet. ‘D’you mind?’
But then I wasn’t exactly the sort to go flinging myself on everyone. Found that kind of behaviour sort of horrible actually – attack huggers.
'Wait, blackmarket
‘Sure. And… you know, for the foreseeable future…moments. If that’s ok.’
You reappear in the door after a moment with tell-tale splashes on your shirt.
‘Look, I’m sorry!’ John snapped, ‘I’m just trying to understand where this is coming from. You tell me you were wrong about something you said over a year ago, about your desire to - I don’t know - form romantic relationships, and I’m trying to understand who, and why, and how, and why do I even bother? Why did you tell me Sherlock, if you didn’t want to talk about it?’
‘Er… too much?’
‘Oh er. Yeah. Just realised I er forgot to shave my legs. Sorry about that.’
‘Yes, that’s what I said, keep up.’
‘Joan,’ she breathed. She had nearly reached my hip joint.
So. A dating profile. Seemed like the thing to do. I guess. Yes. The sensible thing. It’s what people do nowadays. I’ve been told. You get to select people who match your interests. Or things. Which is good. It’s good.
‘Yeah.’
‘Nighty night.’
‘Yes, I know in theory, but it always sounds so ridiculous. Like some stupid…radio... song that you’d listen to.’
Tonight seemed to be an ‘actually reading the article night’, or so it appeared, so I settled back in.
She knelt abruptly at the edge of my chair, staring at me, brow constricted. I laid down the paper and pencil. ‘And yet here you are,’ she said.
‘I know. Right, I’m off,’ there was a swoosh, and I looked up from where I was trying to coax on the stockings to see the trail of her coat zipping around the door. I was pretty sure that dramatic coat-donning was going to destroy half the kitchen at some point soon, it was a long coat and covered a metre or so when in full swing, but as usual, she somehow managed to miss all the essential dishware for now. (I’d tried putting on my coat in that same swooshing, single movement way once, just to see if I could, when Sherlock wasn’t around obviously, and ended up getting my arm stuck. Both. My arms. Actually).
Through all that though, I'd understood pretty plainly that I couldn’t be gay because I’d always liked boys well enough, and I’d had it pointed out plenty of times by my sister how ‘not gay’ I was. Nearly before I knew it was a thing you could be. It seemed fairly black and white to me at the time. I was comfortable as a sister/friend/doctor/soldier and I had never bothered thinking much outside of that.
Joan reflects on her past, and things that have lead her to repress her own feelings towards women, so there is some reference to homophobic ideas and behaviour here. Some insight into Harry and Joan's difficult relationship.
‘Ok, I’ll just go clean my teeth, I’m knackered.’
‘What, this?’ Suddenly there was no Sherlock and only that thing that was slightly too posh, but also sort of low and… could you call a voice smoky? It was sort of smoky, or something.
Sherlock hummed a little and pressed her teeth delicately into my neck, as though she was just…testing. I felt her tongue flick against my skin, and I knew she was tasting it. That thought escaped as a desperate sort of noise in the back of my throat. I could feel Sherlock’s pleased smile against me as she planted more kisses on the spot, following up til she was under my jaw. I turned my head then so I could catch her mouth with mine and it was sloppy, because I already felt like my skin had gone a bit electric, so our teeth clashed a bit when our mouths met. She made a whimpering noise but it must have been good, it was good, because she retaliated with more enthusiasm. Which I was surprised to find possible.
She sprang from the chair and was off, leaving me still gripping the, now-used, napkin. I wiped my chin, and tried not to think about it.
‘I just can’t accept… I know what you did. You and Martin, you had to face such similar choices. You. That day. At Barts. You destroyed your reputation, everything you’d been. You cut yourself off, gave it all up to protect m- to protect us. Me and Greg and Mrs. Hudson. And I know you wanted to stop Moriarty, but he was a very bad human, and there are lots of ways you could’ve gone about it that weren’t so self-effacing, maybe.’
‘No, but you were thinking it. I can hear it you know. Always could, still can.’
You continue to hover once I’m in bed.
‘Do you want to sleep?’
‘Ouch, tetanus,’ she considered, with apparent approbation.
‘Hey.’ I whispered, and wrapped my arm round her neck so I could kiss her. She sighed against my mouth, seemingly discovering the same thing I had about her skin against mine.
I half expect you to smell different, corrupted by the hormones and the joint DNA of the foreign thing swimming around in you. You don’t. Somehow, it’s almost worse. You mistake my choked noise (weak, stupid) for pain, and grip me more firmly, your navy eyes all concern, at 18 centimetres away.
I was both far too tingly and starting to develop a crick in my neck, so I decided I’d better take measures into my own hands a bit, at least before Sherlock started cataloguing my fillings or something. My hands were already somewhere around her upper arms, so I pushed forwards a bit, and leant in a bit and by some miracle she actually behaved and uncurled backwards onto the couch. Problem was, I was now on top of her and god, I had no idea what to do. I settled for kissing her neck, which she seemed to like, but an irrational wave of terror shot through me. I would mess up. Why did I think I could do this in the first place? I had no experience with women, and Sherlock knew bloody everything, so she would probably point out my fumbling around before I even got started, or even… god what if she didn’t know and then I was just subjecting her to some horrible clueless form of sex and it would probably be awful and she might not even like it and then that would definitely make everything horrendous, or worse if she didn’t say anything at all, but she deserved better than that, she should at least have someone who had some bleeding clue what they-
‘James Bond, you bloody well know it’s James Bond. Yes, that’s enough. Sherlock, that’s not the point. The point is. Well, you know. It’s not all company, is it, I’m not exactly going to. I mean there are limits, aren’t there. To you, and me. And you. I mean. You. You don’t. We don’t. Can’t. Ha.’ I coughed. Laughed. Cough-laughed. Utterly failed to insert any humour into whichever parts would have definitely benefitted from humour. Silently begged the topic to be revealed as a horrible joke or dropped. It was only merciful. That’s how things work. We don’t talk about these things, and someone drops the topic.
This is not to say that Sherlock isn’t timely, Sherlock’s plenty timely. Except when she isn’t, and then I find myself standing on some steps at some drinks event, and somewhere there are always some giant overbearing columns, and all I’m thinking is why, for once, can’t any of our clients, or prospective clients, or prospective clients’ prospective murderer’s second cousin ever drop round for drinks in a nice pub. Because that’s what I could go for. A nice pub, and a nice quiet pint, maybe a fireplace, and some chips, that’ll do me. We have those sometimes, after a case, and that’s perfect, honestly I have lost all ambition to see anything more of London’s finer drinking establishments.
‘No, I don’t want to stop
‘Just the chocolate biscuits, none of those horrible raspberry cakey things you bought just because they were on offer.’
The scoff was entirely Sherlock, ‘Oh come on, of the two of us, you’re the only one with actual feminine assets to speak of.’
‘I couldn’t help but notice…’
‘Ha, oh lord,’ I ran my (shaky) hand across my (sweaty) face, ‘Can you come up here?’
‘I’ll… find out. You can.’
There are so many ways we could die, with the life we lead. You’re so reckless with that magnificent machine of your body, and so am I with… the battered second-hand car that is mine, or at least, I used to be. Now someone has to be around to look after you, because you sure as hell aren’t about to look after yourself. Or at least I tell myself that, again, and again. Almost believe it too. The both of us do.
‘It’s just,’ you begin, ‘It’s just…’
Shame, I really shouldn’t have gone for more popcorn. I coughed and it all went flying out of my hand, ‘Sorry, come again?’
‘Oh.’ Sherlock whispered.
It’s a funny thing, human memory, he often thought. That old blog he’d kept through the years had led to publishing deals, and his last bit, the
Sherlock probably just didn’t know what she was saying.
The second time, I don’t make it to Barts.
‘So er…’ Sherlock sounded perhaps the most uncertain I’d ever heard her. Which, I suppose, made sense. Several weeks prior, she’d made a ridiculous request of me and now, without specifically saying so, I’d effectively told her I’d be keen to go along with it.
They were in the sitting room now. Sherlock on the couch, a partial lounge (his back not what it used to be) and John in his chair. He flexed and unflexed his hand on his cane. Perhaps he should get going but…
‘Not as such,’ I squeaked. Her lips eased higher.
So I've upped my chapters, as this smut bit got really long.  Should finish up in another chapter or, at most, two, anyway.
‘No! God no. Please. You’re not disappointing me. I don’t want you to be. A man. Ok? I’m just a bit nervous. I don’t know what I’m doing.’
It doesn’t help though, not really. I wake up with nightmares, constantly, worse than they ever were before. I don’t know if she doesn’t hear, or if she only pretends she doesn’t hear. I don’t know if I wake up screaming your name, or if it’s only in my head, as I watch you fall again, and again, and again.
‘What, already, will you wait for me?’
‘What do you… what do you think of?’
‘You were, I always know. And whatever it is, it’s tiresome. Stop!’ I could tell she was still pleased with herself about the case. She had a pleased-with-herself sort of smile on.
‘Yes! Ok, alright! Jesus.’ You glare at me, as though, at this moment, my head isn’t already filling with six other alternate explanations of the bag, which could lead me to be agonisingly wrong. Sentiment. Always with you.
‘Be my guest.’
‘I’m touched.’
‘I have it on good authority,’ Sherlock began, ‘That the combination of certain on-demand based streaming video content providers, and leisure activity in the company of another person is commonly used as a euphemism for sexual activity.’
It wasn’t a proper kiss, not really. It was her lips pressed against mine, and her breathing (Earl Grey) against my mouth. There was a split second where I felt her tongue dip out, just for the tiniest moment across my upper lip, and then she was gone. I opened my eyes. I didn’t actually remember having closed them. Sherlock was back in her chair, across from me, feet curled up on it. She looked at me warily. I attempted the encouraging smile again.
‘I’m not going to claim I’m suddenly gay, bu-’
‘Alright?’

She managed to break the nodding cycle to burrow in my neck. ‘You are everything, Joan,’ she whispered against my jugular, and I knew what she meant.
Sherlock’s gaze shifted away, ‘I’m well aware that my verbalisations are likely to be off-putting in these…’ she waved her hand, ‘situations. I have been informed. I therefore made an effort to desist.’
‘No you’re not, you berk.’
An army doctor shuffles defective feet on the sticky acrylic flooring. The blinds stay drawn, blocking out a grey view onto the musty corrugated roof and oxidised pipes of the ventilation shaft. The dawn of one more bad day in a series of bad days filters into endless taupe. It’s like that song, the one that was on repeat for three-quarters’ hour last Saturday, coming in from god knows where through the paper-thin walls:
And then nothing happened. Well, I say nothing. What happened was we had tea as intended, and then Lestrade called. Of course he called, because if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that London’s criminal minds have a predictive sense for things like ‘delicate situations’, ‘date nights’, and ‘that one morning per month you can finally have a lie in’, and can back-date their crimes effectively so that NSY discovers them and rings you at precisely the least opportune moment. If only they’d turn to psychic services rather than murder, we’d all be much happier. Except Sherlock, of course. And probably, by extension, me, now that I think of it.
As usual, I met this with the combined urges to strangle her with a serviette, and to grab her hands and bite her fingertips in order to stop her from performing this annoying ritual. As was not usual however, I was, for the first time, aware of this thought as I had it, and aware, no thanks to our previous conversation, that it was a bit of an odd one. Yes, it was the product of rage and disgust, but in the end, my reaction was wanting to put her fingers in my mouth.
‘Sorry, just… talking.’
The truth of the matter is that you love Martin, and I did not calculate for that, and I cannot let myself forget. Your love has changed everything.
I laughed outright, ‘of course you have.’

know is that no one asks Dr. Joan Watson what happened to that nice nurse Martin from the old office, and no one asks why all the oby-gyn appointments were magically shifted to other doctors for about a year’s time.
‘Joan? This may not be my main area, but I’m pretty sure this will go better if you shut up.’
‘I guess I was just thinking, what would’ve it been like if we’d lived together all along?’
‘It’s something… about… men.’
All is silent, except perhaps for the imaginary hiss of enthalpy leaving our teacups.
‘Ok. Ok.’
That got a twitch akin to a smile, and an eye roll, which was good, considering the circumstances.
‘No, really. Were you flirting? Was that what that was? Is that how you flirt?’
‘Oh. Ok. Good.’ He’d almost forgotten the Adler topic had come up amongst everything else, 'That’s good. Erm. What brings this on?’

'Human nature is a strange mixture, Watson... However, we have no choice as to our action...'
It’s a testament to my state of distraction that I don’t notice your presence in the flat until the upstairs door judders shut. It’s loud enough to break into my thoughts, loud enough to indicate your state of mind – you're also preoccupied, so much so that you misjudge the force of closing, and so the door slams. I don’t know how I know it’s you. I’m sure it’s more than instinct, if I revisited the moment, I could describe the specific cadence of your step perhaps, or surmise that the door and subsequent movements exactly align with a person of your height and weight, the door swung by an arm length exactly yours. Perhaps on a more subconscious level I was aware of your breath, disturbances in the air currents produce by lungs of precisely your capacity. I could substantiate these items, but to do so would be a waste of mental inertia which I would do better to expend on the deduction’s follow-up. You’re home, and you’re distracted.
