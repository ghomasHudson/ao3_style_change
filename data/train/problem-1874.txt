He is scarcely a mile past the wrecked bike when a scream pierces the air: a raw, animal sound of pure horror, so loud it slices through the engine’s growl.  Sherlock pulls off of the road, dismounts, and sprints toward the sound.  Each hammering
He turns and fairly bolts out of the bathroom, snapping the door shut behind him.  Sherlock stares at the space where John stood only seconds ago, his mind a muddle of exhaustion and confusion.  Behind him, water burbles merrily, filling the tub.
The few fairies living among humans caught hell for the missing children.  Verbal abuse, assault in the streets, cold iron and colder glares brandished.  The fairies who could not conceal their status were the easiest victims.  A brownie, scarce three feet tall, was mugged walking home from Sainsbury’s with his shopping.  In a seaside village, a merrow’s cap was stolen and ripped to shreds in front of her, preventing her from fleeing into the ocean.  The more likely suspects – goblins, redcaps, spriggans – had been chased out of the country centuries ago.
It was those last two words, sharp with something akin to fear, that startled Sherlock into obedience.
John turns with one arm in the sleeve of his coat.  Sherlock stands in the center of the sitting room, pale and weary-eyed and alone.
Sherlock looks up and down the street before going inside.  He glances up at the sign above the front window and feels a smile quirk his lips.  Bright and incarnadine, the script proclaims:
The shaking was the least of Sherlock’s recent onslaught of annoyances.  A headache pounded behind his temples like ice picks being driven through his ears.  A clammy sheen of sweat clung to his skin and chilled him to the bone.  Pain smoldered through his muscles and reduced every movement to shaky jerks.
John says nothing, but stares resolutely at the chipped black paint on the door.  The tarnished knocker stands at eye level with him.  When he speaks, his voice is thoughtful.  “About us.”
“You, now,” John says hoarsely.  Sherlock stumbles upright on shaking knees, folds himself lithe and pliant into John’s lap.  John kisses him as one hand finds the small of his back and another tugs loose the drawstring of his sweatpants.  Sherlock clings to John’s shoulders as John works his flagging erection to full hardness and the hand on his back wanders low, one finger dipping between his crack to circle the ring of muscle there.  Smiling against Sherlock’s mouth, John twists his wrist and presses the tip of his finger to Sherlock’s hole, not
John picked up the article on reward circuitry and slid it under the pile.  He picked the next one from atop the pile – genetic mutations in melanoma patients – and stared at it without absorbing the words.  “Right.”
She found him in an instant.  Sitting brazenly at a table outside the coffeehouse, James Winter saluted her with two fingers and grinned.  Mary smiled back, feeling naked under the glare of street cameras.  She fantasized about flaying him as she took his hand.
John lowered his head and pinched the bridge of his nose.  “Jesus Christ.  Ignore her. She’s talking nonsense.”
John’s focus dripped away and he rested back against the pillow, letting Mrs. Hudson chatter on.  Sherlock was okay—well.  He was alive, and evidently as much of a maniac as usual.
As they neared Peckham, John turned his glare again to the window, refusing to so much as acknowledge Sherlock’s outline.  Rather, his eyes tracked to the dim figure of Alexander – a quiet presence, but too formidable to ignore.  Why was he following Sherlock?  He was only a client – they came for help with their cases, but they never actively participated.  They waited on the sidelines, helpless and simpering, while Sherlock and John ran headlong into danger.  Why was Sherlock – by his own skewed standards – being so friendly with him?
The nightmare is a constant wave in the first year after Sherlock’s death – crushing, crashing, threatening to suck him under.  As endless as the sea.
The line clicked and a deafening wail filled Sherlock’s ears.  Alexander’s voice could barely be heard above it.  “Where are you two?”
Sherlock scowls, though the blush has yet to vanish.  “You’re sleep deprived.  Clearly it’s addled your mind.”  He spins around and stalks toward his –
Sherlock could not contain his grin as another piece of the puzzle snapped into place.  “You’re working for the people stealing Effie Grant’s money – and they’re funneling it through the Mazarin Chairs.”
He makes one edit, and one alone.  It’s a shot in the dark, a leap of faith.  The publishing house might throw a tantrum.  They might call John demanding he rein in his recalcitrant husband. They might reject it out of hand, delete it and publish the book without a word of its existence.
She gives his hand a firm shake.  “Violet Smith.”  Uncertainty flickers through her eyes; she masters it, casts it aside.  “I need your help.  I… I think I may be in danger.”
She rang off, leaving John with a hollow feeling in the pit of his stomach.  He was still staring blankly at his mobile when Sherlock’s voice drifted out of the kitchen.  John started and raised his gaze, plastering on a smile.
“Come on, love,” John tells Sophie.  “Let’s leave this cranky old man alone to stew while we get you a bite.”
“Yes.”  Mycroft nodded.  “Modified for your special use and a hundred times more valuable than the standard, but, ultimately, yes.”
“Wait,” said Sherlock.  He stood and went to John, pressing the magnifying glass into his inert fingers. “Don’t lose it.”
“Yes.”  Mr. Garrideb swayed to a shelf crammed with books, spines cracked and loose leaves tattered.  Spidery fingers brushed the worn covers, settled on one seemingly at random, and pried it loose.  He opened the book and flipped through pages.
“She works for the Met.  I hadn’t deduced that she’s in forensics, though in my defense, I was preoccupied with the vomiting.”
Later, they huddle beneath the duvet, clean and warm and still a little drunk on endorphins.  John lays his fingers across Sherlock’s collarbone and smiles.
“Yeah.”  Rosie crams the remaining first slice of toast into her mouth, fingers buttery and flaked with crumbs.  Sherlock checks an urge to reprimand her again.  He’s not her father.  Swallowing, Rosie continues, “Sammy told me.”
“Anyone could happen by,” Sherlock murmurs – close, so close.  “Anyone could hear… anyone could see…”
Putting Rosie to bed proved another battle entirely; she fussed and squirmed in the cot, heaving great, hiccupping breaths every time John turned toward the door.  High-strung from the eventful evening, she wailed to be held and wailed when John conceded.  Once or twice she looked ready to work into a proper tantrum, waving her arms feebly, tensing, and clasping them to her chest with red-faced anguish.
It began innocuously enough.  Sherlock is, for all his pretense at glacial indifference, a warm, surprisingly demonstrative person.  John saw nothing amiss in the casual touches – hands on his shoulders, on his face, the feverish nearness as he untangled a tricky mystery, heedless of the scant inches between them.  John had yielded up his personal space to Sherlock a long time ago.  He doesn’t miss it, not really.
Sherlock had literally come back from the dead and John pushed him away. John should have been reaching for him – holding him – gathering him close.
Sherlock shakes his head and clasps John’s wrist with both hands.  He looks at him, pleading.  Confusion lines the crease of John’s brow and the furrows around his mouth, but his eyes are understanding.  With his other hand, he threads his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, fingernails scoring his scalp with just enough pressure to register through the steel wool cloaking his senses.  Sherlock tilts his head.  Leans into the touch.
John bellowed, heedless of the threat.  He closed in on Moriarty, slashing at the fairy.  But Moriarty was prepared; with a snarled curse, he tossed John aside like a rag doll.  John landed on the tile several feet away with a grunt, the knife clattering to the floor at his side.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” Lestrade mutters.  Then, “Fine!  Fine.  Just sit tight and don’t do anything that’ll get you written up for public indecency.  Give me the address.”
This, of course, was precisely the moment what’s-her-face returned from the loo.  Sherlock turned and climbed up the stairs, feeling more than a little vindicated. Honestly, John’s priorities were all wrong.  He could be helping Sherlock catch a killer and all he wanted to do was shag some simpering ginger woman. Disgraceful.
Mrs. Hudson folds her hands neatly in her lap and studies me.  “You’re her,” she says at length.  “Rosamund.  Rosie.”
“Nah.”  Wiggins shook his head, wriggling feebly in John’s hold.  “Nah, they’re too clever for that.  They know everything, these people.  Got eyes everywhere.”
John stepped close and winced.  He lifted his hand to the juncture of his jaw and drew it away, palm tacky with drying blood.  Storm-blue eyes swept over Sherlock.  “Are you okay?”
“I’m fine.”  With a force of will, Sherlock uncoils his spine, sitting up straight and relaxing his shoulders.  “Lestrade has a case.  Apparently, someone’s been murdered with a candy cane.”
He was standing in the sitting room at Baker Street.  Sherlock lay pale and drawn in his armchair, the tiny seam along his vena cava fraying as he defended his would-be murderer.  Mary stood between them.  Eyes fixed on John, she cocked her head – the slow, swaying motion of a reptile.
Mary slid her arms around him and slowly pressed close, transporting John back to the days of their early dating.  Back at the beginning, John had scarcely been able to see through the fog of grief that engulfed him.  The raw wound of Sherlock’s death had closed, but John had felt as if something vital had been cut out in the process.  Healed but not whole, he had drifted through the motions, spinning into a listless, downward spiral.  He drank more and socialized less.  He fantasized about the kick of the Sig in his hand, the explosive snap of a bullet.
“Mmm.  Yes.”  Sherlock propped his crutches against the wall and pulled his coat off its hook.  “I’ll ask Molly to set up a chair beside the autopsy table.”
Alexander lapsed into a hush, eyes narrowed, as if he suspected the consulting detective was lying.  Sherlock watched as his stare slipped away and moved around the room, dropping onto blackened spoons and mugs of used syringes.
“Well,” says Sherlock, “I was using it because you are, despite being a perfectly adequate conductor of light, a
Alexander shook his head.  “He hasn’t called us back in yet.  Best wait a few minutes.”  He frowned.  “I wish he’d let me help.  Little old man could break a hip moving heavy furniture like that.”
drawing him up from the murk of sleep by degrees.  His veins fizzed pleasantly, as if the blood had been drained out and replaced with champagne.  With a sort of muted amusement, he realized he was drugged to the gills.
The following day and a half were an exercise in futility.  After arriving and leaving their belongings at the inn, Sherlock and John went to meet the police – headed by the venerable DI Ferguson – at the crime scene.  Ferguson, briefed on Sherlock’s methods by Lestrade, had been amicable, if a trifle put-upon.  In his mind, McFarlane was already behind bars.
Nestled in the back of a patrol car speeding southward, Sherlock and John lapse into exhausted silence.  There’s a weight in the air between them, as if something has been left unsaid – stifling and heady, like woodsmoke filling a flue.  As the world outside grows louder, the streets brighter and busier, the pavement bloated with people strolling beneath winking fairy lights, the atmosphere in the car grows… heavier.  Quieter.
It takes only a few minutes for Sherlock and John to find their destination:  Carbuncle Gardens, the thriving Christmas tree nursery of Edmund Brown.  The nursery is enclosed by fences, and a cheery sign painted around the edges with holly and wreathed in fairy lights presides over the coming and going of customers.
is a sense of wary relief.  Relief that Sherlock has returned to him yet again.  Wariness that he will evaporate the moment John tries to pin him down.
“I am rather taken with your sister,” he informed John.  He lounged on the sofa with his violin clasped to his chest, fingers strumming out an idle tune.
Mycroft, as it happens, has been working industriously to prove Mary’s guilt.  She is wanted around the globe, her every step leaving behind a trail of blood and broken lives.  She does not yet know it, but her steps are numbered.
They pass the cab ride back to Baker Street with fingers entwined.  Sherlock’s stomach begins to settle, but each lurch of the cab makes him grit his teeth and grip John’s hand more tightly.  John is quiet, running his thumb over Sherlock’s knuckles every few minutes.
The words died on his lips.  Agony stitched across Su Lin’s face as she lifted one arm, revealing a dark stain of blood blooming on her abdomen.  Setting aside his mobile so its light shone upward, blazing against the bottom of the tabletop, Sherlock shuffled closer.
“You’ve been busy,” he murmured, lifting one page to study more closely.  The grainy street camera shot was of a sallow man in an ill-fitting coat.  He stood in what appeared to be a market of a city square – Budapest, Sherlock mused.  His neck was craned over his shoulder, as if he sensed the camera’s eye.  “Kołek Niedziela.  Which sort of toady is he?”
like a mazikeen.  His eyes were an ordinary shade of blue, his face weathered.  Some accounts suggested that redcaps had long teeth, but John’s appeared normal.  Even his ears looked human: neat crescents without a hint of the characteristic point.  Unheard of in a mazikeen.
“Mr. Holmes?” he said.  His accent, though native to London, had been broadened by time in America.  West Coast, possibly.  “My name is Alexander Grant.  I’ve got a problem I think you could help me with.”
“Buh!” Rosie interrupted, shrilly enough to demand her audience’s silence.  She craned her neck and stared at Alexander.  With a toothless grin, she proclaimed, “Bah!”
Sherlock picks up his violin and bow, tucking them safely into their case while John situates himself beside Rosie on the bed.  Sherlock brings the chair to the bedside, not
Amidst the flurry of tittering laughter, one voice was sharp with reproach.  “The Queen prefers golden-haired children.”
Sherlock draws John down the corridor and halts before the door to the loo. If John notices the burble of running water or the herbal scent seeping out with the steam, he gives no sign of it.  His eyes are glassy with exhaustion, his expression wooden.  Sherlock nudges open the door and leads him inside.
“Hmm, nope,” says John.  He’s entirely too cheery for the situation at hand.  “Glass of water and pain meds, that’s what you need.  And rest.  Loads and loads of rest.”
.  “Who am I to offer one she won’t find satisfactory?  Better I keep it for myself and not trouble her.”
If John has to deal with Sherlock in this state, their new relationship – tender, fragile still – will be blasted in the bud.  Sherlock creaks into motion.  Drags himself upright.  Swings his legs over the side of the bed.  The floor is cold beneath his bare feet.
“I hate that you do this to yourself,” John murmured.  “I hate that you’re doing this to me – making me stand by.”
to the violin as much as he is able.  The song is long but as nimble and graceful as dancers’ feet.  As the final note strums through the air, Sherlock lowers his violin.  Rosie is fast asleep.
When Sophie is six months old, Molly and Lestrade go out on a date – their first since her birth.  And, because godparents are apparently built-in sitters, Sophie is trusted to Sherlock and John’s care.
Sherlock explained his deduction about the pink case.  That was the frailty of genius: it needed an audience.
– and scratches the side of his neck, just above his shirt collar.  A red mark peeks over the crisp, white edge, flowering into what Sherlock hopes will bloom a violent rose and wither damson.  Something flurries in his belly, as delicate and lovely as dragonfly wings.  He feels his glower fade into a small smile.
thinks Sherlock.  The tightness in his chest makes him think of an old woman’s voice over the line, withered and rasping.  A thunderous explosion as a building topples.  The reek of chlorine.  The look in John’s eyes as he peels back the coat, revealing Semtex and roving red lights.
They lie in the quiet morning for a few more minutes, their twinned breathing the only sound in the room.  Soon the city will wake and the teeming bustle of humanity will swell to a roar.  Sherlock wants to huddle under the blankets.  Make a den for himself to wait out the relentless parade of
“Oh, she won’t want any of them,” said Eirene, waving a hand.  “She thinks she wants a child, but she only wants her
Sherlock stills.  Then he props himself up on his elbows and squints at the form of John Watson in the doorway.  “John.”
Sherlock was dashing for the door before he remembered John.  “John!” he shouted toward the kitchen. “Su Lin’s tea!”
With little else to do, John goes to the kitchen to put a kettle on.  He roots through the cupboards while the water heats.  He can’t remember when he last saw Sherlock eat, so he scrounges up a tray and a couple of sleeves of biscuits.  He arranges the biscuits in an approximation of what Mrs. Hudson would do and prepares the tea.
Sherlock dithers on the curb for a moment before providence sweeps past in the form of a taxi.  He hails it, climbs inside, and whisks off down the street.
John fits the key into the lock with steady hands and the door opens into darkness; Mrs. Hudson was evacuated to a safe house before Mycroft initiated the final phase of their plan.  When the two set foot inside 221 Baker Street, they find it as still and lifeless as a tomb.
He’s gone before Sherlock can reply, the door snapping shut behind him.  Sherlock stares at the closed door, listening as silence drums in his ears.
Redbeard subsided with a cagey side-eye at the elder Holmes brother.  He huddled close against Sherlock’s side and huffed his relief.
Sherlock beams.  His doubts and fears have been scorched away, leaving him burnished bright and new, incandescent with a joy he never dreamed he might have.  He is under no illusions that everything will be perfect.  He and John will argue from time to time.  Rosie will occasionally balk at him as a father figure, will wonder what it is to have a mother.  Mrs. Hudson will stick her nose where it doesn’t belong.  Greg and Molly will be infuriating and annoying and then they will be
Sherlock climbed back up the stairs.  Stopping just beyond the threshold of the door, he schooled his features to nonchalance tugged on one glove.
The following evening finds Sherlock at his microscope once again, testing a second blood sample with the Coumadin.  If he’s right – as usual – the owner of this sample was quite cleverly murdered by her mother-in-law by what most would consider a papercut.
Because hours later, with the sun long-since sunk in the west and the darkness outside as black as ink, Sherlock is still daydreaming when he hears Mrs. Hudson’s light tread on the stairs.
“But then I met you, John, and I—I changed.  I saw an army doctor with too much spirit to squander among normal, boring people.  I dragged you under starlight and over rooftops and through the darkest shadows of London.  I thought it was all a lark.”  He smiled, crinkling his nose.  “I was so blind, John.”
John tried to speak; his throat swallowed around the tube and fire spread through his chest.  The hands released him and his entire body juddered, unmoored without the anchoring contact.
Elise stands in the doorway, smiling politely.  She cocks her head to the side.  “Have I come at a bad time?”
And then Sherlock is winding his fingers through John’s short, silk-fine hair and dragging him back in, slotting their mouths together with a hunger that startles them both.  John gives a little gasp and runs his hands up Sherlock’s chest, fisting in the lapels of his dressing gown.  His lips part and Sherlock follows suit, tilting his head and deepening the kiss, feeling his heart kick into a sprint.  He has a fever—he’s feverish—he
He comes to with a choking gasp, lungs raw as he drags in breath after breath of icy air.  He’s lying on a cold, hard surface, a glaze of frost clinging to his cheek.  The darkness surrounding him is as deep and impenetrable as an abyss.  Not even the merest sliver of light can be seen.
Minutes later, Rosie falls asleep slumped against Sherlock’s side.  The sleeve of digestives, half-empty, threatens to roll from her inert fingers.  Sherlock extricates it with great care and sets it on the table.  Sitting back, he finds the remote and lowers the volume to a muted hum.  Pictures flash across the screen, but they mean nothing to him – his focus is on the child at his side.
“No, you madman.”  The giggles fade and the quality of John’s smile changes – softens.  It almost seems shy.  “I do plan on sorting out the first thing, though.”
Sherlock relented, shot a death glare at the PA as they passed, and hustled after John.  Half-way down the corridor, John smothered a snicker – then burst into giggles.  Sherlock’s lungs strained as he tipped into great, snorting guffaws.
—someone.  It’s cruel and a little bit obscene, but inescapable.  With a parting smile, Elise is gone.
“Daddy, I’m ready,” Rosie announces, clomping down the stairs and looking terribly pleased with herself.  Another one of John’s larks Sherlock can’t condone with a clear conscience assails his eyes:  Rosie has been allowed to choose her own outfit for Honeycomb Primary School’s
register that, tensing momentarily before exhaling, banishing his reaction with the ease of long practice.  It’s John.  It’s only John.
No, no.  Morphine use could be controlled, but cocaine was another beast entirely.  A case was what he needed, a good, tricky case, something he could set his teeth into, something frenzied and fantastic.
Sherlock stared at her in shock. In all his life, Mycroft had never so much as shared a ginger nut from the tin he kept squirreled away beneath his bed.  Now he was preparing to share a former criminal agency.
“You—”  Seb utters a disbelieving laugh, but his eyes are bright with fury.  “You can’t talk to me like that.”
“I’m a man of many surprises,” Sherlock drawls.  He sets the crackers on the nightstand beside the bottle of ginger ale and sits on the edge of the bed.
John took in the site of Rosamund with newfound wonder.  A baby – someone who could grow, create, and experience an entire life of their own.  Someone whose mind and body and agency would, in the end, be theirs alone.
Outside, the sun vanishes beyond the horizon in a golden nimbus as the sky darkens from deep violet to black.  Exhaustion steals over Rosie slowly; she blinks more and more as her gaze slides in and out of focus.  Her head lists forward until she reaches an invisible precipice and draws back with a start.
“Oh, for pity’s sake,” said Eirene.  She snatched the backpack from Sherlock and plunged her slim, white hand inside.
“Nothing.”  Downing the dregs of his beer, Sherlock sets down the bottle.  “John, I believe I require your assistance handling something quite delicate.  If you’ll just—”
Instantly John’s hand finds his mouth, clamping his palm over it to stifle the cry.  John’s voice is low and ragged when he says, “Ssh.  Still early.  We don’t want to wake Rosie, do we?”
“Done,” said Mary.  “He’s alive, but if you want him to stay that way, you’ll listen to me.  I’m sure you can figure out where I am – be here by dusk, or I’m gone, and I’ll kill your precious big brother as incentive to leave me alone.  Same goes if you bring the police.  You and John will come alone.  Understand?”
John seems to suffer no such fears.  “If it was an office… I would spread you out on a desk, open you with my fingers, maybe my mouth.  Tease you until you’re sobbing for me to fuck you.  Then I’d have you right there, on that desk, ‘til you came
Sherlock wished he still had the bruise John had given him; its bloom had been lovely and violent.  He had tracked its progress for a week before the blues and violets had faded into the color of rot.  The skin now was unblemished – as dull as a blank sheet of paper.  Sherlock wanted to tear it into pieces.
And Sherlock understands, then, far too late: it’s been the pair of them all along, Catherine manipulating her schizophrenic brother, Peter, as deftly as a puppeteer guiding the strings.  Alone, Catherine is too small and weak to have killed Charles Porter and strung up Edmund Brown.
John’s nostril twitches with an angry sniff.  “If I’m so useless, stop asking me to join you on cases!”
“Really, dear.”  Mrs. Hudson’s voice drops into a stage whisper.  If it weren’t for the general merriment pervading the air, she would be perfectly audible clear across the room.  “John never does learn, does he?”
Sherlock swept past before John could argue, crossing to the officers standing around Lady Smallwood’s body.  Donovan peeled away from the crowd and stepped forward to meet him.  They exchanged words and Donovan frowned, shaking her head.  Sherlock strode toward the corridor leading out of the museum with his coat billowing behind him.  John hastened to follow and Alexander brought up the rear, keeping pace despite his limp.
As if sensing Sherlock’s scrutiny, John turned and met his gaze.  Sherlock saw the spark that had lit John’s eyes hours ago.
“Right,” John mutters.  He steers Sherlock to a bench and sits him down.  “Can you wait while I get a cab?  And if you need to, you know…” He glances meaningfully over Sherlock’s shoulder, and Sherlock turns, sees a bin standing stoutly beside a lamppost.  “Nothing to be ashamed of.  Better out that end than the other.”
For the next hour or so, Sherlock tramped around the flat, impotent rage fizzling in his veins.  Stupid,
“It’s just,” John found himself saying, mind sprinting to catch up with his mouth, “Christ, I’m sorry.  I’m exhausted.  Can barely keep myself upright.”
– John saw it.  One of the windows was a darker shade than the others because there was no glass, no reflective surface for the lamp’s cold light.  Pieces of cardboard were propped upright, giving the illusion of a window to brace them.  A triangular gap formed at the base of the cardboard, and through it, the muzzle of a rifle.
“McFarlane’s MePhone app had previously traced a trail to the stream.” Ferguson points down the slope, where an offshoot of the Kinlea Burn flows, placidly unaware of the havoc wreaked on its banks.  “Didn’t find anything the first time around, but upon closer inspection, we found this.” He fishes an evidence bag from his pocket and hands it to Sherlock.
They were small gestures:  a hand brushing over his shoulder in greeting or parting, bumping feet under the table – accidental or deliberate, Sherlock could never guess – and once, memorably, a ruffle of Sherlock’s curls to soothe a moment of pique.  Sherlock had sat at the kitchen table, microscope before him, stone-still as John collected his tea and toast and moved to the sitting room.
Chuckling, John nudges Sherlock and runs a thumb over his knuckles.  “You can’t fool me, Sherlock Holmes.  Deep down, you’re a hopeless romantic.”
John stared at him like he had grown a second head.  Chewing on his lip, Sherlock clarified, “Alcohol.”
Sliding the magnifier open, Sherlock turns his attention to the corpse, leaning as close as he can without losing his balance and mucking up the evidence.  Charles Porter has been dead for hours; the elements have sapped all the heat from his body, rendering him an icy slab.
Sherlock glanced at John, surprised by his input.  The mazikeen watched Su Lin with unwavering focus.
evaded her newfound speech.  She had toddled around the flat with her chubby, uncoordinated legs, calling,
Sherlock brushed his fingers against John’s.  John tensed and jerked his hand away as though burned.
The cleanliness stings, scouring and astringent, like bleach slopped over a floor ridden with dry-rot.  The planks may be clean, but they aren’t fit to stand on.
Sherlock gives a noncommittal grunt.  John crosses to the sofa and kneels in front of Sherlock, drifting his fingers over the knob of his knee.  Sherlock blinks out of his reverie.
A quavering wail answers their arrival, and Sherlock feels more than sees John tense beside him.  Seconds pass, and his eyes adjust to the gloom.  They are standing in an empty room, wide with a high ceiling.  Everything is the dark gray of granite, and a musty scent is thick in the air, clogging in Sherlock’s lungs like grit.  A pair of figures stand on the far end of the room, one grown and one a child.
“Oh,” said Sherlock.  He didn’t know what ‘capricious’ meant, but he wasn’t about to admit it.  Dropping his gaze to the backpack clutched in one white-knuckled fist, he stared vacantly – and then sharply, a frisson of fear spiking through him.  “My magnifying glass!”
"Mr. McFarlane," Ferguson begins, and McFarlane stiffens, knuckles white around the handle of his stein.  Ferguson's lips twist.  "Why don't you tell our friends what we learned about Jonas Oldacre."  It isn't a question, but a command.  "It's partially your story, after all."
Sherlock dithers in the sitting room, at once exhausted and possessed by nervous energy.  The image of Catherine pressing the knife to Rosie’s face haunts him, twisting his stomach into knots.  If John’s aim had been even a hair off—if Rosie hadn’t taken the risk and torn free of Catherine’s grip at just the right moment—
“That’s when I received the set.  It was only recently sold piecemeal.”  He shook his head with a sorrowful expression.  “Utter shame, splitting up that set.  Each one fetched a tidy sum, true, but together…”
Sherlock stood and went to the window, where he watched Mycroft slip into a black, unmarked car.  As the vehicle coasted down the street, he said, “Perhaps we could trade siblings.”
Half an hour later, with the scavenged remains of their meal splayed across the table, Sherlock was still curled against John's side, knees raised to his chin like a child.  John didn't mind his weight; Sherlock was warm and pliant, if angular.  On the telly, Daniel Craig waged a threatening tête-à-tête with Javier Bardem.
“Yeah,” says Rosie.  She looks down at her feet.  The socks she wears are plush and woolen, scalloped with a Fair Isle pattern.  Sherlock bought them for her months ago, when autumn first gave way to the bite of winter.  She looks back at Sherlock.  “You and Daddy saved me.”
Sherlock tunes him out, intent on the body of Theresa Goodwin.  She’s disfigured – difficult to see under all the dust, but her face is concave in places, tacky with dried blood.  All at once, the ragged fingernails make sense.
John reined in his defensive retort.  “2013, in… spring, sometime.  I think it was March.  She asked me out for drinks after a long day at the clinic and I thought,
John sets aside the spatula and turns off the hob.  “There can’t be many more places for him to hide.  Lestrade will find him soon.  And anyway, have there been any more deaths?”
Not to be deterred, Sherlock props his chin on the violin’s chinrest and curls his fingers around the neck.  He sets the bow to the strings and draws out a single, syrupy note, hoping for inspiration to guide him.  Nothing.
got a dog!  His name is Reginald.  He’s a mutt.”  She beams at Sherlock, knowing full-well his affection for dogs.  “He can do tricks, too.  He can sit and lie down and roll over and…”
Harry had shrugged, unrepentant.  “Better out the front than the back.  You wouldn’t’ve wanted to deal with that, would you?”
John pushes off the wall of the confessional, using his weight to barrel Sherlock against the grate on the other side.  He shoves in close, teeth bared, his cock a thickening line in his trousers.  All the experimental touches, all the years building to this: a handful of minutes’ fumbling in a godforsaken
John nipped into the kitchen to scrounge together what little food they had while Sherlock poured over his case notes.  Sarah hovered at his shoulder like an irksome moth with useless advice. When Sherlock’s fingers fumbled with the tab on an evidence bag, clumsy from the bandages, she pursed her lips.
Sherlock’s breath plumes in the icy air as he follows Lestrade down a cobbled lane with John in tow.  Fairy lights festoon the stalls around them, glowing like so many threads of starlight.  The ripe smell of the river is diluted by the scents of spices, ciders, and sugared pastries steaming from the fryers.  People – police officers, mostly – natter incessantly, creating a pleasant buzz of white noise.
“It’s fine,” said John.  If he was honest with himself, he didn’t mind having Rosie to himself.  “We were just getting cleaned up, weren’t we?”
Distantly, Sherlock is aware of a scream somewhere off in the enclosure.  He pays it no mind – the Father Christmas Killer is still within sight, he can still catch him, he can—
With his heart slamming and face stinging with the cold, Sherlock races toward the alleyway.  Blackness swallows him as he runs inside, smoking out all traces of starlight.  For a single moment, he is utterly blind.
Joe might have murdered Westie, but he was a coward at his core.  He raised his hands for mercy, allowed himself to be ushered into the sitting room, and told the entire story without a shred of belligerence.
The pencil falters in Sherlock’s hand.  Guilt, slick and oily, begins churning in the pit of his gut.  Flicking his eyes warily at Rosie, he sees that she hasn’t noticed his lapse; her hands are folded on the table, her expression distant.  She chews absentmindedly on her lower lip.
In the end, Sherlock determined from the scuff marks on the welcome mat in the company lounge that the socialite’s jealous twin sister had lifted the jewelry.  The antiques had been a family heirloom, bequeathed from mother to eldest daughter through the generations.  The socialite, being a few minutes older than her sister, was the chosen heiress.  Nobody had suspected the sister – she lived in New Zealand and she was family, after all.  On a family holiday to the home country, she bullied her pretty, teenaged daughter into batting her eyelashes at the socialite’s son.  The boy had given up the code in a heartbeat.
“Gorgeous,” John says, smearing a kiss against Sherlock’s neck.  “God, you’re so beautiful.  I could watch you like that and—and never get tired of it,
“Catherine killed those people because of me,” Sherlock interjects.  “She took Watson because of me.  Tell me, John, if I wasn’t a part of your life, would she have been in danger?”
Sherlock rifles through his mental catalogue of plants.  The flower is toxic to humans, so he has the information ready to hand.
Mrs. Hudson tottered to Sherlock’s side, still in her nightie and slippers, a steaming cuppa in one hand.  Her eyes widened at the spectacle lolling about on the stoop.  “Oh, hello.”  She glanced at Sherlock.  “Is she a friend of yours?  One of your… your homeless people?”
“If we get the last transmitter, Craig might be able to track its signal to the receiver, which should lead us to Mary.  I think we should wait before involving the Yard.  They could be useful allies in a fight, but if we tell them our plan now, there’s a greater risk that Winter—”
He shoots Sherlock a poisonous look as he and the redhead turn to leave. Half-way across the room, the redhead shrugs off Seb’s hand.  Her manicured fingers move to her clutch, fiddling with the clip.  She’s going to call a friend, a cab.  Seb will be going home alone tonight.
“Listen,” says Sherlock, striving for an even tone, “why don’t I play you some songs from those awful films you love so much?”
?” Sherlock says with the speed of a Gatling gun, suddenly desperate to get back to the flat, to get John into bed.  “Wanna shag John into next week.”
everything feels.  There is no monumental shift in his perspective, no sense of being out of place. It is simply him and John, walking to their bedroom as they have countless times before.  Even the weight of the ring on his finger seems to lessen.
He lifted his mobile phone, displaying a list of numbers.  Tapping the topmost number, he opened a page complete with the location coordinates, security clearance, and a little blurred square – the front view of the coffeehouse in miniature.
“Well,” says John, scuffing his boot against the packed snow, “I expect we’ve got to get back to the case.  Sherlock?”
Slipping his mobile into his pocket, John turned to Mary, who lay nested in the hospital bed with a bundle in her arms.  A tiny fist emerged from the swaddling, flailing in outrage.  Wordlessly, Mary turned the baby so she faced John, and his breath caught.  Red-faced and wrinkled, furious with the trial of birth, she looked no different than any other healthy newborn.
Anderson was at Sherlock’s side, speaking with deliberate care.  “…not a pretty sight, but we’re fairly certain...  think you can manage it?  Sherlock?”
Lestrade glowers but does as he’s told, departing with a sigh of resignation.  Sherlock resumes his study of the corpse, but even with John’s torchlight, he has trouble seeing all the details.  The cold doesn’t help.  Even in his gloves, his fingertips have gone numb around the magnifier.
Mrs. Hudson made no reply for several minutes; when she finally spoke, her voice was leaden with worry.  “I don’t think John was by, no.  He only phoned me a few minutes ago from hospital.”
Until, rooting through that very box one evening, Sherlock came across a sound: threadbare and low rumbling.  A harmony of laughter.
“I appreciate your caution, doctor,” said Mycroft, “but I’ve taken thorough steps to ensure Mr. Everill’s suitability as an ally.  He can be trusted.”
Later, ensconced in the solitude of their adjoining hotel rooms – John wasn’t keen on more knowing looks, more insinuating smirks, John was
:  a wild aspect, an ability to make any plant in their garden flourish, a skill for baking that warmed the heart of anyone who ate their food.  Quirks, tokens of a time spent in a strange land.
Sherlock slipped off to investigate while John and what’s-her-face were busy being stupefied by parlor tricks.  The circus’ supplies were beyond an unmarked door – locked, but Sherlock made quick work of that. He found the spray bottle of paint amidst the glitz and clutter of silk and brocades.  And was promptly attacked by Zhi Zhu.
Maître d' at an Italian restaurant, fully-fledged alcoholic, on-and-off relationship with girlfriend, an artist—no, a curator,
“Oh.”  John blinks once, twice.  He’s been caught off his guard, getting what he wants so easily.  “Um.  You’re sure?”
“There’s no need for that,” said Alexander.  “I’ve done my research.  It’s one of the reasons I came to you, rather than go to the police.”
A new light blooms in Sherlock’s field of vision, sudden and steady; he looks over his shoulder and sees John holding his mobile with the torchlight on.  “Better?”
within: packets of condoms, a half-empty bottle of lube, a roll of deodorant.  A bottle of melatonin tablets.  Glancing at the bottle and popping open the top, Sherlock estimated John had used roughly half the tablets.  Trying to coax himself to sleep, trying to stave off the nightmares with dietary supplements.
Sherlock rushed to fill the space.  “I know she already has one,” he said, “but I was doing some research and this model is top of the line, far superior to the old one.  Conforms to all the current safety standards and converts to a toddler bed.  It could even be converted to a teenager bed, if we get the frame and mattress.”
It had been awkward, at first.  Between Sherlock’s leg and John’s side, their options were limited.  But after some shuffling and shifting and
An hour and a half later, as the party is winding into a soothing spirit of lassitude, Elise bids them farewell.  “…got another party to get to,” Sherlock hears her say as she plucks her coat from its hook and tugs the sleeves over her arms.  “I had a great time, really.  Only I’ve promised to be at Catherine’s and she’s been planning this for ages…”
John leaned back and rested his head against the seat.  He glanced at Sherlock and froze; Sherlock was staring at him with unabashed intensity.  His open coat and the undone first button of his shirt offered a glimpse of his clavicles – tantalizing, but so, so sharp.  John licked his lips and looked out the window, keenly aware of Alexander’s presence.
“God,” John mutters.  “She can be so maddening.  I know being excited on Christmas is normal, but this…”
“Watson is less dim than most children her age,” Sherlock hedges.  “Frankly, she’s less dim than several
Humming vaguely, Sherlock turns back to his experiment.  The time points are critical – if he gets distracted, he’ll have to split the cells and set up the experiment all over again.  He unscrews the cap of a fifty-millimeter conical with one hand, dips the pipette in, and draws up the drug.
“We have to go,” said Sherlock, holding up his mobile and shoving it into his pocket before John had a chance to look at the text emblazoned across the screen.  He took a step, staggered, and paused.  Shivers skated down his spine.  “Craig texted me the address of the final transmitter.”
Sherlock took the proffered apple, but as they walked, he let it drop from his hand to lie, abandoned, on the ground.  Eirene was oblivious; her jet-black eyes were fixed on the path before them, shining with pride each time she stopped Sherlock to show him a new wonder.  Mushrooms as large as trees, parasols blotting out the sunlight; toads the size of oxen lumbering through the undergrowth; flowers whose petals formed delicate cups, capturing water from the rivulets of broken streams.  Eirene bent and picked one of the flowers, taking a delicate sip and sighing.
Sherlock could see that John was still annoyed, but he shook off his confusion and followed.  Whispers of the Met tailed them as they passed.
“Not all the tenants of these locations are available for immediate delivery,” said Mr. Garrideb with a shrug.  “Some are up-and-coming collectors, you see, trying to establish a new gallery.  I agree to hold the pieces until the locations are suitable for them.  These antiques need to be kept in controlled environments.”
John says nothing.  It seems wrong that Sherlock should come over shy after years of parading around the flat in bath towels and sheets.  But that logic does little to cool the flush he feels climbing to his face.
“No,” Sherlock said, petulantly.  “I’m making a point.  Bring those over here, will you, and put them all here.”  He lifted a delicate plate up for her to see and set it by the teacup opposite of his.
Sherlock flinched as the door shut with a snap.  The clatter of hurried, uneven footsteps descending the staircase dwindled and vanished in the clamor of London outside.  Sherlock stared at the closed door.  His fingers twitched at his side.
“I—I don’t,” Sherlock stammered.  Even as he searched for them, groping in the dark corners of his mind, he felt the memories crumble in his fingers.  They were like spun sugar: delicate, lovely.  Breakable.   “I don’t remember anything…”
And what a capricious sea it is: a tempest with towering waves, astounding joy at the foaming peaks and terror in the slumps of the valleys.  He is a pirate crew of one – captain, first mate, lookout.  He revels in the high points and weathers the low.
To her credit, Rosie looks a bit discomfited at the sudden outpouring of love.  Even five-year-old Britons know too much sentiment can never be a good thing.  She studies them in silence for a while, face screwed up like she’s trying to divine a reading from murky tea leaves.
“This is a fantastic first publisher, you know.  Brilliant that you had the blog ahead of time, that you and Sherlock,” a nod in Sherlock’s direction, “had already drummed up so much press.”
“Language, John,” says Sherlock, not taking his eyes from the microscope.  Cells drift apart and the field of vision fades from scarlet to pink.
As the show continued, Sherlock felt the gossamer threads of a glamor settling over the audience.  Slack and fine as silk, the magic tugged onlookers into a dreamy state of wonder, like a hand guiding a sleepwalker back to bed.  Lulled and amazed, the people were quicker to clap at the dancers and gasp at the feats of strength, the daring escapes.
John stares at him in wonderment.  Then, nodding frantically, he shifts and thrusts into the slick, tight space between Sherlock’s thighs with a groan.  Prying one hand away from the bedclothes, John digs his fingers into Sherlock’s hip and fucks him desperately,
“Mary was looking for something another person hid,” said Sherlock.  “Leverage against her.  Leverage
Sherlock had squatted beside the fallen display case to shine his mobile’s torch over the mess.  “John, look.”
Catherine’s smile wavers, but she rallies and brings it back with full force.  “Just a chat, I suppose.  I was walking with Elise earlier, but she said she had to meet with John, so…”  She shrugs, eloquently.  “Here we are.”
Sherlock barely has time to react before a massive shape disengages from the shadows and barrels toward them with the relentless, hulking destruction of a runaway train.  John pivots, eyes wide, and the huge figure raises a fist above its head, bringing it down in a hammer strike.  John trips aside, avoiding having his head caved in, but the blow meets his shoulder and knocks him down with a bitten-off cry of pain.  The massive figure looms over him.
“So callous!” exclaimed the puppet.  “Honestly, it’s no use to anybody. Defective, remember?”  It tapped the newsboy cap, indicating the aneurysm in its cradle of swollen blood vessels.  “Any second now could be
All of these details were lost on Sherlock in an instant.  He saw only three things.  The first was Mr. Garrideb, huddled on a stool behind a work bench with his head in his hands.  The second was Alexander Grant, who stood opposite of Sherlock.  His broad shoulders were bunched, his feet apart as if ready to dash, leg be damned.  He looked ready for a fight.
“Alexander!” Sherlock called, turning to stare into the shop.  Shadows peeled away from the dark figure as he emerged onto the threshold.  “Has Mr. Garrideb unloaded the shipment?”
“Oh, God,” he gasps, pulling away to stare down at Sherlock, eyes dark and lips reddened.  “Oh, my God.  Sherlock, do you—do you really want—”
Now, things are different.  Now that Sherlock has become the target of John’s sweet nothings, he can condone all the other nonsense.  That includes the baths.
“Fine,” Sherlock snapped.  “Since you’re too lazy to do it yourself, I’ll take your idiotic case.  Now get out before I start contemplating fratricide.”
“Oh!”  John’s voice was louder and harsher than he had intended.  He was too angry to care.  “Well, I’m glad you can chat with my
A shape hurtles toward Woodley, so swiftly Sherlock’s eyes can scarcely follow. The shape – the man –
He went out for a short walk, later.  With his walking stick tapping a steady rhythm against the pavement, he shuffled through the chaos of squealing wheels and bustling crowds to Regent’s Park.  Rainclouds gathered in the distance, feathering blue-grey over the sprawling immensity of London.  The surface of the boating lake was like a mirror, reflecting the roiling sky overhead.  The air was heavy and cloying with an imminent storm.
“You came here for the chair,” Sherlock surmised.  Wiggins’ instant of wide-eyed surprise confirmed it.  “Why now?  It’s been here for a month.  It could have been removed at any time.”
“We’ve got an ID,” Lestrade announces, coming to John’s side.  “Theresa Goodwin.  Assistant manager at a shopping center ‘Fins & Friends.’  We don’t know when she went missing, exactly, but she only missed one shift and that was this morning…”
“Mr. Holmes.”  Alexander Grant sounded more slightly more composed than he had been minutes ago.  “We need to talk.”
“Well, hand them over, whoever they are.”  Bradstreet and Donovan round the corner, handcuffs at the ready.  “Promise not to make a fuss, yeah?”
Carruthers’s eyes flick to Sherlock and widen.  “I know you from the papers.  You’re the detective.  Sherlock Holmes.”  He glowers at John.  “Who the hell are you?”
“So Sala was looking at Mr. Garrideb’s shop for the same thing Sylvius wanted,” Sherlock mused.  “What could they both want… ah, leverage.  But what kind?  And against whom?”
No matter.  Sherlock could solve two cases at once, providing the WiFi on Lestrade’s scene was decent.  The real inconvenience would be changing into proper clothes.
Lucy shook her head.  “It’s not just that he’s stalking me, Mr. Holmes.  It’s…”  She paused, blew out a sigh.  “This sounds… mad, I know.  But when I mentioned the stalker to my father, he… he told me about his life before.  Before he met my mum and had me, when he lived in America.  He was part of some kind of cult.”
I stare at her.  Dad didn’t mention anything about the landlady.  Then again, if Dad’s accounts – and the internet’s – have any merit, a woman who tolerated Sherlock Holmes and John Watson for upwards of three decades can’t be entirely right in her own mind.
John looks at him.  He seems suddenly haggard.  Then his gaze sweeps up, up toward the castle perched atop the hill.
“You recently ended a relationship due to incompatibility issues,” he continued.  “And you suffer from mild anxiety.  You…”  His eyes narrow and a crease forms on the bridge of his nose.  “You’re a swimmer – freestyle, if I had to guess.”  He looks at me expectantly.  I nod, feeling the tension loose from my chest like a thawing icicle dropping to the ground.
What does he have, if not the Work?  Expenses aside, John and Rosie have no reason to stay at Baker Street.  They could just as easily find another home – one without a mad flatmate, one where Rosie might have the mum she so desperately wants.  If (
“There’s nothing here, John!” Sherlock exclaimed.  “There was a compartment in the leg of Sylvius’—”
“He and that Holmes guy would’ve gotten along swimmingly, then,” Winter scoffed.  “All he does nowadays is shoot up.  It’s a wonder he hasn’t managed to kill himself.”
For all Sherlock’s whinging, Greg Lestrade is not, in fact, an idiot.  He’s actually quite sharp when he has to be.  The position of Detective Inspector didn’t just fall into his lap. It’s only when Greg is well and truly stumped that he’ll call in Sherlock, and even then, it’s a toss-up as to whether the little snot will deign to put on trousers and grace them with his presence.
John dips his head for another kiss, but as Sherlock tilts his head, his injuries make themselves known.  He winces, breaking the kiss, and John’s eyes fly open in alarm.
“Don’t move,” John says through chattering teeth.  Sherlock couldn’t be contrary if he wanted to – he’s too drained to do anything more than sag against John, head lolling as they near the bank.  Sherlock blinks, dazed, and registers figures milling along the pavement:  Lestrade emerging from a car, bellowing and gesturing at Sherlock and John in the river.
“Yes.”  Sherlock can’t believe John actually wants him – that he hasn’t come to his senses and run away screaming.  Sherlock will wait as long as John bids if it means John won’t leave.
He finds John in the kitchen, standing over the hob while Rosie tweaks the dials of Sherlock’s microscope at the kitchen table.  John holds a frying pan by the handle and wields a whisk as if to decimate a foe.  The air is thick with the scent of frying eggs and sausage and a medley of sizzling, popping grease.
Sherlock and John walk outside to the waiting car, hand-in-hand.  John holds open the door and helps Sherlock in with great care, as if handling something as frail as gossamer.  He follows Sherlock in and closes the door. Sherlock lists into him, eyelids drooping.
As Sherlock neared his destination, a fence loomed into view, almost concealed by the riot of common bent curling through its barbed wires.  Sherlock glanced at Redbeard, uncertain; but then he spotted a gap in the fence.  Probably it had been knocked down by a wayward cow, the edge of a tractor, and never repaired.  It was just large enough for boy and dog to squeeze through, though the sleeve of Sherlock’s jumper caught on one of the barbs as he wriggled free, ripping the fabric.  He studied the ragged hole, then dismissed it: unimportant.
Violet looks at him, jaw set.  “I looked you up, Mr. Holmes, and with all due respect, I doubt you’ve ever had to pinch pennies.  You’ve probably never lived in an awful flat, never skipped a meal you didn’t want to. So yes, I took the job.  I needed to eat.”
With his shoulder a throbbing point of agony, Sherlock clambers upright, certain that another blow will fall.  But he can see nothing; snow flies into his eyes, veils every twitch and shadow.  He can’t see Catherine, but he hears her screaming—hears her
John glances at Sherlock, the question plain on his face.  Sherlock flicks his gaze over Ms. Helens, collecting data, searching for evidence of a threat.  None is forthcoming, but Sherlock
“Well, considering how long you were in that freezer, it’s a wonder you’ve got all your fingers and toes.”  John’s eyes drop to Sherlock’s hands, resting limply at his sides.  The fingers were raw and red, but thankfully not frostbitten.  Now, dressed in bandages, they look like the hands of a mummy.  John exhales and says, softly, “I wish you would take better care of your hands.”
She colors.  “Oh, I. Well, it was the publisher’s idea that John… edit some pieces.  Shorten them up.”
that I was… I was helpless to it.  Once I had that magnifying glass, I couldn’t stop thinking about my escape.”
A scream followed John into consciousness, but after a moment of frozen terror, he realized it was not his own.  He bolted upright and ran down the stairs toward the sound.  Sherlock’s door was unlocked; John threw it open, and it struck the wall with a bang.
But Sherlock’s got a look on his face that says he has a good idea of what Greg omitted – namely, a cross between fury and nausea.  His eyes flash to the other officers, a spark of spite tipping Greg off the instant before he opens his mouth.
John unthreaded his fingers from Sherlock’s and jerked them away.  He had one knee braced on the bed, supporting most of his weight.  Leaning forward, he placed his hands on either side of Sherlock’s face and looked him squarely in the eye.
“John,” said Sherlock, “I’m altogether too thrilled to deal with your tantrums right now.  First good case in a while – well, not good, actually.  I’ll solve it by the end of the day.  But still, better than waiting around while Craig chases hackers.”
A pair of German tourists shoulder past him, tugging Sherlock into the current.  He spins and dives in; best to get this over with, and quickly.  Discomfort prickles at the back of his neck as he squeezes through the throng.  Bodies all around radiate the sweaty stink of close confinement.  Sherlock is no stranger to crowds – he lives in London, after all – but there is a reason he spends exorbitant fees on cabs.
Sherlock was just about to push the woman away or start shouting for John – or both – when a familiar voice floated through the doorway.  “Sherlock?  Who is that?”
He utters a rather undignified yelp as he goes down, banging his tailbone against the floorboards and sprawling on his back.  The room spins in a bilious carousel.
A signet ring rests in the bag, dull in the low light.  Sherlock squints to make out the crest – an ornate rendering of the letter
In hindsight, he may have been careless.  With his pirate hat perched atop his head at a jaunty angle, a pair of wellies with cracked soles on his feet, and the June sun warm on his shoulders, he had left the safety of home with a heart full of adventure and a mind devoid of caution.
“I…”  Sherlock can think of nothing to say.  He is reeling from the unexpected sting of Rosie’s words, carried like a slap.
Sherlock blinks as a piece of data shudders someplace deep in his Mind Palace: a book on a dust-covered shelf, untouched for years.  “What?”
Not so very long ago, John had devised distractions to keep Sherlock’s mind off the drugs.  They never worked, not completely – Sherlock’s wits were too quick, darting from Cluedo to
“S’fine,” Sherlock says, voice quavering.  Cold seeps into his skin, burrows into the marrow of his bones.  His clothes are plastered to his skin, offering little protection against the chill air. John is in much the same state as he is.  “We m-might need b-blankets.”
The bedroom door creaked open and Sherlock startled.  Craning his neck, he saw John’s small, compact silhouette drift toward the bed on silent feet.  The shape of Sherlock’s dressing gown fluttered around his ankles; the sight made Sherlock’s chest tighten.
Shouts fill the corridor.  Firefighters race up the stairs, masks obscuring their faces.  John points toward Oldacre’s prone form without a word and drags Sherlock down the stairs, his strength brooking no argument.  Each step groans and threatens to break beneath them.  The ceiling creaks, buckles.  Sherlock can see nothing for the smoke.  He lets himself be led, stumbling after John.
That’s wrong, that’s all wrong.  John is the brave one, the soldier.  John invaded Afghanistan.  He protects Sherlock from the foulest scum of London.  He watched Sherlock leap to his death and bore the sharp sting of Mary’s betrayal and he kept going.  Sherlock draws his strength from John.  Now, John’s fear creeps over him like oil on still water.
With a violent jab, Sherlock sent the text and stowed the mobile back in his pocket.  John gave him a questioning look and he sighed.  “Mycroft.”
“Sh-she’s…”  Joe trailed off, shaking.  Found a scrap of resentment to spit out the words, “She’s just like Mum!  She c-can’t function without that coat.  It’s
Sherlock rolled his eyes heavenward.  Eventually – through much shouting on Sherlock’s part and snickering on John’s – they arranged to rush out to Bray and see the chair for themselves.
John’s ears heated, but he took the proffered escape route and made for the door.  Mrs. Hudson stepped into his path.
“Do you…”  She pauses, chews on her lip.  “Do you love Sherlock like that?”  She looks at Sherlock.  “Do you love Daddy like that?”
Sherlock can feel the wave ebbing beneath him, readying itself to hurl him once more into the depths of the valley.  The pleasant haze of his dream has vanished, leaving a brine of tears in his mouth.  He shifts sluggishly out of the stupor of half-sleep.
And stares in utter disbelief as the drunk ducks out of the way.  His fist flies over the drunk’s head, an inescapable trajectory, and cracks into the only other person in his path.  Which happens to be Molly Hooper.
John suspected a part of this narrative was embellished.  Rosie could be cantankerous with strangers at the best of times.  In fact, aside from himself and Mary, the only person he could recall Rosie actually
She gave him a withering stare, fingers curled around the salad tongs.  “You’re terribly transparent, you know.”
They freeze as one, gazes catching, latching, and roving skyward in the space of a breath.  The sprig of mistletoe dangles from the bison’s horn directly above their heads.
