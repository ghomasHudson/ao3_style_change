Mycroft sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose trying to relieve his migraine.  “You left me no choice.  Perhaps if he’d been told?”
John smirked and then couldn't help but laugh. "Do you really think these little bits will keep me here five minutes past the time I want to be here?"John asked as he held up his restraints.
John recoiled. He stands up quickly. "Fine. That's fine. You go off and get yourself killed. I'll be on your welcoming committee. Because the only way you walk out of here without me, is over my dead body. Do that and I will believe you. Other than that, I was letting you know that we were going together, the asking bit was just to be polite." His head wobbled with a jaunty determination as if to dare Sherlock to try anything. He was angry, but John was never one to give up very easily.
Lestrade continued, "I bet that something attacked them and you just happened to get mistaken and stung too."
Sherlock sat up and examined John. "You are saying that you think you can get out of here? You don't know where you are. You have no clue what day it is, but you expect me to believe that you can walk out at your leisure? Please." His eyes rolled at the idea.
"I was under the impression that he was not much in the way of gift giving. He gave me the impression it was a family tradition of neglect."
John grins broadly as he looks around the room. "No. There is some mistake. I must have. I planned it. And here you are, just as I hoped. No body? It should be here.  Right by the window. That's odd, don't you think? I looked out the window."
“This is our flat. Its home. But the building belongs to Mrs. Hudson. She could have kicked me out and found better tenants. You are my home, my beloved Doctor Watson, but your happiness belongs to Mary and she also has allowed me to stay in spite of the fact that she could have taken a far easier path and not one person on earth would have blamed her in the least. There is certain nobility in her. I know because I rise to it when in her presence. We have misjudged her cruelly and I didn’t make a vow to you alone. No matter your decision, I will endeavor to keep mine to the best of my ability.”
"No, actually I'm here on official business. Could you have a seat? Please?" He motions for her to sit on her flower-jumble couch, intending to join her there.
" I loved her with all I could give, even if she won't look at it that way. I know that is true… and maybe one day the big picture will seep into her and she will know as well." Sherlock interrupts.
Sherlock wilts. His head slumps backward to rest on the back of the chair. "Oh. John. What have I done to you? Please, I can't…I have so much to say. I have changed too, but I don't think I can see you like this and maintain my…" Sherlock stops speaking and seems to have blanked out.
"Obviously. I wouldn't be here if it weren't. I have missed my assistant, my colleague, my best friend. I am so glad this brought us together. Like old times, eh John? The game is on and all is well." Sherlock sighed with contentment as John stared at the ceiling.
"No. It's true. You care. You always care. I'm not like you. I am broken and I use people. Using people isn't the same. All this time, I knew how you felt…and I used it." His voice is slow and peaceful, as if he's accepted that he is some sort of monster.
Lady Smallwood shifted on the table slightly to get a better angle for what she was about to convey. Her voice was a whisper, “He’s just playing the game. He needs him to cooperate at this time. Your brother’s arms have grown long and weary. Your rescue was much harder on him than you imagine. He is still paying the price for that decision. He let things slide because he trusted no one else to bring you home intact. He is only one man, Sherlock.”
Mary had seen a lot of men beg for everything from their mothers to strange god’s as their life faded. This man rode toward the veil with a bank of staircase humor packed in his pocket. His comments lagged behind their subjects just enough to make him seem a little barmy. She covered her mouth to giggle silently and felt her heart fall deeply and truly in love. She shot two of them and incapacitated another, but John had sprung without warning or question. When he looked at her once it was all sorted, she had expected to see many emotions dabble his face as he decided that she was no longer feminine and cute and ladylike. All she had found there was the door to his passion.
As the plane banked for final assent. John took a deep breath. Relaxed and glanced at her, slightly embarrassed.
He had not yet resolved that there was no going back. He is dead to that life now and he is just now hearing the first whispers of the grief for those insignificant everyday visions and modestly normal hopes. Truth is dawning on him that all those dreams were effectively dead with him.
Sherlock whispered loud enough for everyone to hear, “She’s working for Mycroft. Ever noticed she’s very skilled for a nurse.”
recently married a man of a seemingly kindly disposition, who has now abandoned you for an unsavoury companion of dubious morals”
"Yeah.  There is.  God.  There really is.  What you said before you got stung was true.  But there is something worse.  I have to tell you, before this goes any further."
She raised her chin and sighed. “Two choices John. You talk to me and convince me that life really is that bad and that you want this for a valid unchangeable reason and after you get it all off your chest, if that is what you want, I will help you. Or you can spend the rest of the week in the crayon and mash potato ward.”
He’d crossed paths with an Irishman.  Tiger had surfaced as his right hand man.  Tiger had spoken to Ford, out of loyalty. It was in Rome one night that his former sniper had appeared in his hotel. Tiger had warned him to get John and his lover out of his hair before it got ugly.
They read her flash drive as soon as Sherlock was lucid. Of course they read it, they were not idiots. The information was bad, but their imaginations had quickly gone toward far worse places then reality. They trickled information to Mycroft, and he trickled confirmation that the information she’d given was subjectively accurate.
“A little over five years ago, Mary had an operation go very wrong. She escaped, but her cover was blown for all time and there may have been a rather sizable bounty for anyone who would be so kind as to make her whereabouts known. Her friend went to some astonishingly risky, not to mention illegal lengths to protect her. Mary retired. Prior to you and she becoming intimate, her friend found herself in the middle of a deeply troubling personal matter that would have had far reaching repercussions and I am quite sure you can guess the identity of the culprit.”
"Sherlock would have wanted you to have this. It was our father's. Please accept it as a Christmas gift and know he would have been delighted to see you wear it." Mycroft said handing John an expensive looking box. The watch was beautiful with fine engraving.
Molly is unsure what to say and whispered,"I did it for me. I loved him. I loved him too much…to face that he was being so honest about it. He made jokes about it. Killing himself...I get what he meant now, but it wasn't real when he said those things. I was afraid at first, but I really, sort of, got used to it or something. He told me this would happen, that first time you asked me to go over there. I wanted to change that. I thought I could love him enough to keep him alive. "
"Yes. Tragic. I personally blubbered like a baby at his departure," John said, deadpanning his sarcasm.
Mycroft takes a deep breath and holds it before admitting, “I was not responsible, but I missed an obvious deduction. I was distracted by sentiment.  I broke both of them in different ways. He made himself like this.”
"About midnight we went for a walk. We talked. I caught a cab from the park home and he left. I thought he would be okay. He said he would see me soon. "
“Don’t be an idiot. I wouldn’t impose my worst nightmare, knowing the probable outcome. I simply would abide by your decision if that was what you felt was necessary. I imagine Mycroft could even assist you if you wanted a further barrier. New identities that even I, in my darkest moments, would be unable to track. Or I could go back to what I was doing, and this time stay away.”
She looked around and shook her head at how perfectly horrible this had become. "Oh, John. John, what happened? I don't even know what happened!" She shrieked to the empty garage.
Poor John, what could he be thinking? Perhaps there is more to this, he may be assisting the family to keep up with their little rebel freak. That made the most sense really. John was a good person. John is an adult and certainly smart enough to determine when he's fed up with the embarrassment of it all.
He played boring John and she played charming Mary, and they both knew that the other was a fibber. Sherlock called that one perfectly.
She dug through her bag and produced the ring case and opened it. “You have lovely taste. You are supposed to meet my Mum and Da in two weeks. Figured I’d better save you that indignation. I want to torture you for breaking my heart, not get you locked up in Bedlam.”
As soon as she has drained her cup she leans back again. Mrs. Hudson is thankfully quiet. The herbal soothers have about the same kick as ten shots of John's whiskey and she can feel the world growing distant and muddled. She smiled softly, remembering how she and John had used his little glasses to play Wit's End and she'd felt almost exactly like this by the time he'd kissed her. Molly shifts onto her side as Mrs. Hudson drapes a crocheted throw over her. Molly closes her eyes and holds the cufflink so tightly it hurts the palm of her hand.
He missed the shadow in Mary’s smile as she agreed and hugged John. “Right. He won’t let you down there. He came back, before. He’s Sherlock.”
They were not wrong. He had every intention of getting away. He knew what Mycroft wanted and he had repeatedly refused point blank. John was a product of his training, but he would never be willing to train more soldiers to be like him. In the first place, the things he imagined they expected him to teach were so evil that they didn't need to be passed on. If he were given one-hundred of Mycroft's finest agents, John could break half of them by the end of the first day. It might take more than one batch of hard-eyed hopefuls before John could actually replicate himself one time and the trail of psychological damage it would require to hand Mycroft another was not worth it.
Sherlock held him for a while before trying to make John laugh. "I think you are doing it wrong. I have extensively perused internet porn and this is not one of the integral steps toward orgasm."
“My father was a great man.  I would very much hate for him to accuse me of taking the path of anodyne progress.  I leave the choice to you.  You have far more experience than I.  Shall we continue our painless little prickles or have we ended our boy’s camp endeavors.   Can you handle more?”
"No. He had nothing to lose. He played because he wanted to die. He had the bad pill and intended to take it, as per Moriarty's instructions. His only other option was jail and his eventual brain bursting fate to look forward to." Sherlock stood and paced the room.
John grinned and shrugged. "I did. It was all I could think of and he was unaware that I could rattle off the symptoms because of my profession. He recommended a doctor in Berlin, gave me his card even. He patted my head and kissed me on the forehead, and told me I had hope. He was so understanding it made me feel terrible for lying to him, but it proved I wasn't just playing for the wrong team."
The work should have only taken a few moments, but the man had tinkered under the sink for two hours. He was no plumber. John searched her kitchen and it was a simple matter to discover that Mrs. Hudson had had something besides a plumber in her kitchen that day. There were blood stains under the sink. He had banged his knuckles attempting the simplest of routine chores. Only an amateur would have injured himself trying to remove the entire s-curve trap. He had left behind smudges of his telltale real profession. There had been gun oil on his fingers, causing him to slip repeatedly.
Mycroft sipped the tea and let the peaceful moment wash through his mind. Mycroft hated to expect the worst of Sherlock, but understanding had long ago whipped his hopeful and inexperienced prospects of his brother. He no longer held out hope that Sherlock would ever, ever develop a rational response to stress. His beliefs long ago morphed into a more realistic standard. Sherlock would be Sherlock, and Mycroft would have to mop his brother up from some disgusting situation.
"I'm listening? You brought me here. Say something you mean." New John won't look at him. He stares into the fire chewing his lip.
"Well I will leave the genius bit to you and him. I'm just old. I'm just a stupid old bobby who has been through it all ten times over. I've seen. Experience isn't genius. But if you find anything, anything real. Not doodles and not that chicken scratch of his, and you need me to help, or get you something you need, even quietly, if you follow. I'm in. I'm all in. I hope you can find a starting place, because I have been working on it this whole time and haven't got a trail of piss to follow. Here, brought you something, just in case."
She stood by the fireplace debating on if this was a waste of time. John was gone. For some reason the flat seemed to be filled with her perfume, as if this second home would never be big enough to hold her again. It was as if she were a noxious stench upon the lives that belonged here.
Joy.  God how long had it been since he felt that.   Rosie was almost three now and that had been the last time he could remember feeling any measure of joy.
John had turned red, then a little green and finally his face had gone white. Molly sipped the coffee John had bought her and suddenly she'd giggled. John tried really hard not to laugh too, but they both got the joke and the image of the multitude of awful ways that Sherlock might resupply if she were not there to help him in his times of boredom.
She is torn between feeling grief for Sherlock so raw she wanted to rush straight to his side and being so angry at him she never wanted to speak to him again. All of this effort, was doomed from the beginning. This is the worst moment of her life.
Rat nods and moves in slow motion to John's pain filled mind. He feels a stick and there are a few more seconds of agony before he feels the pain begin to ease enough that he can think straight.
"But, you don't understand. I could have stopped. Sherlock, don't you get the big picture? I could have just, moved on. I tried a few times, you know? " She punctuates her words with a kiss on his chest.
He heard the words, "little stick." The world swam and sounds became distant as he heard all the familiar calls of his condition. He wasn't sure what they gave him, but it was bloody glorious, whatever it was. He lay on the moving nothing and opened his eyes to the blurry meaningless shapes. Part of him knew he'd just done something important, but he just couldn't be arsed to think about it or care.
She nodded, “The last word he ever spoke was your name. Of all the words he must have known if he was a genius, the last one was a common four letter word, that gave him the strength to look into the abyss and not be afraid. Yes it’s horrible, but knowing that you were his comfort and strength. That is very powerful, Dr. Watson.”
Sherlock's head rested against the frosty glass and his eyes closed against the dawn. The cabbie, unfortunately not a serial killer bent on games of destruction, was thankfully willing to provide his service silently. Sherlock's thoughts imagined John alive and the two of them like they were before.
She pulled away and shuddered as if trying to get her attention back on business. She had lost her phone and had to squirm around searching for it. “You really shouldn’t waste that, you know. I bet you would be bloody brilliant.” Her voice was soft and fond and her eyes hungrily flicked to his lips.
Just about the time the ladies had gathered their coats, purses, gloves and scarves, Mycroft knocked. He greeted each by name and with a genteel bow that did not fool any of them, and those who acknowledged him at all, did so with a disapproving harrumph. He strolled into the kitchen with an indulgent smile fixed to his lips and reached in his pocket and withdrew an envelope. He placed it on the table, and tapped it with the tip of a finger.
Note - I had never seen the Sherlock series when I began this, so there is an added scene to the meet.
God, how Sherlock wished to see John shout at him. He bargained with the universe for one last time, as he slipped into a cab and began his penance. He was off to see Mummy and her friends. He would never again see John. He had promised his brother to become part of his stodgy old puffer world filled with the ancient steam engines of the boring and unable to change. They expect and restrict and force all the little engines to follow along on shiny tracks. It did not matter now, because he was already nothing and it would be so easy. "But here there is no light," Sherlock whispered.
Sherlock settled the fare, adding a generous tip because the man hadn't talked the whole time and he must have been flying to have arrived here so quickly.
His eyes again fall on the train overpass and from this direction, facing west, he found his 'MOOU FERODO'. He walks into the arched pedestrian pass through and uses it as shelter against the rain. He leans his back up against the dry brick and watches in both directions from the darkness. It doesn't take long. From the lights bleeding from Texaco he spots a tall man in a long dark coat with short clipped grey hair and two coffees balanced in one hand.
Eventually the rumors of his possible orientation of a private nature began to circle just out of John Watson's earshot. That had slowly bled away some of his friends from constant intervention. For others, it simply shifted focus from the family damsel in matrimonial pursuit, to the closet cases of the kin in question. It was speculated that perhaps they had missed the important signals of John's true nature. Perhaps he was less manipulated by that Holmes man and much more heartsick over him. This new frame of sympathy, closer to truth but still so far below the realm of reality, brought new waves of sympathetic sentiments that served only to feed John's need for aloof distance.
It took him several trips to St Bart's to get comfortable on the roof. He finally faced one demon. He stood in that spot and looked down. The wind filled him with fear and the sun blazed anger, but the place itself made his heart beat with a lust to invite his acquaintance into his own possibility. He didn't hesitate to step up. He had a tingly desire to imagine exactly that moment again, from Sherlock's perspective.
"I almost kissed you long ago. I know precisely how I feel about the rest. I want to see your face in joy, it has been sad for far too long."
“For this person, at her request, not even for Mary’s safety alone, your wife came out of retirement, for a singular assignment. The operation we interrupted had been planned long before she became involved with you. She was under strict orders to leave no witnesses. She went to great lengths to perform her task without resorting to any extra victims. But, it was unforeseeable that Plan A would be interrupted by plan B and neither knew of the others participation. Multiple simultaneous operations are a standard procedure and on occasion, there is crossfire.”
"No. It has to do with it being you I think. I sort of had an experiment, while married. I was in a pub and met a man. I was curious, because of the dreams I had been having about you. I had a mind that was both open and very drunk, but found him, I don't know. It was ugly and I apologized and couldn't escape his clutches fast enough."
Sherlock's voice is thunderous and his face twists into rage, " John loved us and we failed him. We failed him and I will see that his death serves a purpose. He died for nothing. Do you understand? Nothing. Nothing but our failure! We failed him. You failed him. I failed him. And I swear on my worthless soul that the world will burn for it. I will burn for it. Mycroft, you, everyone will burn, who failed John Watson. He was better than us all."
The feeling of calm acceptance does not extend the forgiveness for Tiger to make art of Sherlock. If Sherlock were to be found with Seb's signature, God or not, John would win. Nothing would ever protect him because John rarely felt the need for wrath, but Sherlock had already proven that he could draw that emotion from John. John was back on the job. John would find some way to protect his idiot-boffin.
His face had so many imperfections but the second it was animated by his spirit, John was warmer to Rat than the very sun.   Photos could never do him justice.  John could be a scary righteous little hound, a faithful dog and most of all, the wolf in wooly jumpers, but he would never be noticed when represented on high gloss paper.
“Of course he's dead, he blew his own brains out, no-one survives that. “ Sherlock holds up his hand as john started to speak.  “Oh Please no.  I told you it is never twins.  It is never Twins, John.”
John wanted sleep but it was playing tease as his mind did a lurching dance of regret and 'what if' in an endless loop.
Inside he hears laughter. "Been there for three years. Longer than I knew you!  Just get out so I can finish this job. It is too much, Just leave me to it and disappear. Again."
Oh he’d pulled it off, playing the part of Captian/Doctor Watson who stands in the face of death and flips the tosser off. He’d managed with a joke and a smile, but as John watched his best friend and someone he loved just as much as Mary and his kicking bump of a daughter fly away to be turned into meat for the political posing of the masters of the country, John had felt the fog just over the horizon.
John gestured with his hand that he knew this lecture, as he spoke, "I know. Please tell me we can at least try to talk to Tiger. You said he's not on our side. I would rather take a bullet myself then have to take him out, Rat. He's still our brother."
“Yes.  Instead, I waited to hear from you.  It dawned on me that perhaps that night was indeed…goodbye.  I left the country, because I couldn’t bear to watch.  Lots of work kept me from mourning something I had no way of stopping.  The next time I surfaced and made tentative inquiry of your welfare, you had met a young woman and appeared to have ceased this nonsense.  Very odd dresser, but she was still quite lovely.  Molly, you said her name was?”
“If I was really lucky, he would be here. Because I would have figured out what he needed to hear that day and he would have known that I would stand by him no matter what anyone said. If I were lucky, he would have known to believe in me as much as I believed in him and he would not have felt that he had nothing in this world that made existing not boring. He didn’t even hesitate, he said ‘Goodbye, John’ and nodded to me, tossed his phone and spread his arms wide and leaned forward. He didn’t even scream and he watched the end come a bit like swimming. He would have known it would break me and he would have known that I will always follow him. He would have known that that was my job. What good is a conductor of light if the luminous apparatus is just a shattered blob of oozing transport?”
"Oh, darling. I am so sorry about your poor little doctor." Mummy said, making Sherlock's exact fake frown face.
She knew where John kept his escape bag, and she had to see if it was there or not. She used her key and quietly stepped into the kitchen. The flat seemed eerie. This was not the first time she'd been here without John, but it was the first time she ever felt shivers. She worked among the dead, and had never believed in ghost stories, but for her, there were ghosts in these rooms.
This is strickly a writing prompt for fun and not profit. It is in no way meant to infringe on copywrite.
Oh, she had other lovers, he could expect no less, but she never had another love.  She looked beautiful that sunny spring day as her son was supposedly lowered deep into the earth. Their eyes had locked and her lips curled as she nodded to him.  She had slid up next to him at the small gathering and he allowed her to see him for a split second.
She didn’t drop his hand or speak, but in all the ways that mattered to John, she could see in his face that this was far bigger than a peck on the cheek or a sappy hug. John was handing Sherlock the honor he would only show someone he considered his commander.
"You're the one with the magic tricks, figure it out." John braces himself and lifts his tea to his throbbing eyes.
Sherrinford  can’t help the way his voice goes low and dangerous, but John can push his buttons like no other. “If?  Oh, yes because ‘no strings’ was my rule, was it?  I wasn’t even on your list of emergency contacts.  You had been on mine for years.  You still are, in fact.  You nearly died in that desert and again in hospital of infection and do you know how I found out?  I came back and you were not where you were supposed to be.  I had to hear it from Mathison. Our dearest Bat-shit-crazy member and he said you acted like a damned recruit with a death wish out there that day.  What possessed you to volunteer to be a medic for those Rangers…bloody American wankers…walk into an ambush like that and then play hero. I don’t know what the hell you were thinking to this day.”
He stood up and moved near his apparition, careful not to touch him, yet his eyes filled with tears and his fingertips buzzed with the desire to reach out and cup John’s face.  He’d learned not to follow these impulses.  John was not real, yet he could forget that fact so long as he kept his hands away.  Watching his fingers pass through John had shattered his ability to pretend that New-John was as real as his three elderly companions.  Oh the mirage was not perfect, he certainly noticed that nobody spoke to John or understood why Sherlock randomly chuckled at times, but seeing John let Sherlock’s heart rest from the ever present guilt, anger and sorrow long enough to function.
John looked down and sighed, wishing he could hide the silly purchase he’d made on the spur of the moment, though he’d specifically gone out of his way to do so. “Just felt like some sweets,” He mumbled face glowing with embarrassment.
His vision blurred and he closed his eyes, then very quietly, John began to speak, "Sherlock's never spoken of you casually, other than to say you died, but he keeps a picture of you. I caught him in an odd mood one day, his birthday, a month or so after we met. He said he was older than his father now. That was the only time he blurted anything about you. He didn't show me the picture in his hand, I found it later during one of his danger-night flat-searches. You couldn't have been more than twenty or so. I never made the connection to you. When I got back to London, the past was strangely distant and painful. I killed a man to protect him after knowing Sherlock for thirty-six hours. That's how quickly he had earned my trust, despite all the terrible things others tried to say about him. He's easy to misunderstand, and I'm no exception. " John's eyes slit open and he finds Rat leaning very close, attention riveted and a tear threatening to escape with the next blink from his left eye.
"Please. I need a light. I want to see you," she whispered and it sounded louder than she'd meant it to.
John was proving that he'd managed to research Sherlock far beyond what a common person could know. He spent the day visiting scenes of his Uni days as well as places he had resided secretly while in the throes of his drug dependency. With a smile of irony, he made several more adjustments as the day drug on and the game became increasingly hard to play. Sherlock was impressed at some of the facts John had evidently gleaned about him from Mycroft's most confidential files.
His mother looked impressed, "Getting on a bit better, I see. It is about time, you know. You will keep your promise to him?"
He smiled and said kindly, “Tragic about her husband. I get the impression that that can be attributed to this mess too. You wear the same perfume. I have learned a few tricks from his nibs.”
There were two more bees in their death throws twiddling in circles in the landing and several more dead or dieing ones up the stairs.
John was here for the pain.  He didn’t want this, but there was a resolute acceptance in his eyes that proved he didn’t ‘not’ want the outcome to be heinous and better yet deadly.
John glances at Sherlock, taking his measure before he speaks softly the bombs of doubt. “I think, Sherlock, that you have a line that is more fluid than I ever realized and that this may, still, do you more harm than you wish to admit.  Violence can be as addictive as any drug and it has the similar side-effect of always needing a little more to replicate the endorphin surge experienced previously.”
John forgot his worries about Sherlock. A friend was in trouble and has asked for his help. He smiled painfully and nodded. It was very good timing. Whatever the problem, he needed to feel useful and someone from his past still remembered that not so long ago, he'd been a very useful man. It was a sign that maybe he just made a fool of himself, but not everyone he ever knew considered him to be a fool.
John looked at him with a sideways disgust. Well, he thought, that explains what you see me as. You are the genius and I am your audience, you oblivious prick. Still, in for a penny, in for a pound.
He met Mary two days later. In truth it was her mind that attracted him. It is her inquisitive ability to ask odd questions that mattered, reminded him of one of the things he'd missed most about Sherlock. Her humor is off-beat and though offered freely, he is soon enamored with how often she made him forget to be sad.
Mycroft had always listened to these tales with a bored skeptic's ear. Of course, Sherlock believed them hook, line and sinker, but he did get stuck with the name, so Mycroft had indulged his brother's questions much of the time.
John’s face went white with surprise as he entered and found himself at the tip of a deadly antique that functioned with the same reliability as the C10. It worked perfectly most of the time until it suddenly jammed or cut loose for no apparent reason. “Sherlock, what the bloody…” John pushed it sideways with two fingers.
Sherlock reached under the sofa and retrieved his slipper full of cigarettes. He lit one and blew smoke into the still air of 221b. “You told me to fuck off. She could have had you all to herself and it would have probably served me right. I could never have survived it for long. She had no obligation and no reason to talk you around and share you with me. But she did. You wouldn’t have even been here for me to return to, if not for her.”
Sherlock didn’t want to insult these men. They had been very useful and unperturbed by unforeseen logistic problems.  He looked around the table and nodded. “Please be advised, I am not unhappy with our projects so far, however, you are all capable of far more than I expected.  I assumed that there would be fatigue issues as well as a bit of retraining necessary.  That has not been the case in my opinion.”
He had watched out for Sherlock.  Sherlock was resourceful and rarely needed assistance, but he did make mistakes and when he did they were spectacular.  God but Sherlock had gone off the deep end in South America.  Ford had even been appalled.  The balloon animals Sherlock had left, made from his marks intestines, were poignantly off the rail even in the mind of Sherrinford Holmes, consummate collector of human keepsakes.  Oh, yes, he needed to keep a close eye on his son.
"Then walk me through it, because I am at a loss. You have managed all this time. What occurred today that made this the moment you picked to stop existing?"
He was Sherlock Holmes.  He was still here, with the living and that meant this could be fixed.   At least in theory, it could be fixed.
John stood up, both rejection and admiration mixed his features as he spent several minutes gathering his things and packing them in silence. Sherlock smoked and ignored him.   John set his bag by the door and turned to speak, “Don’t you dare shut me out this time. Don’t you dare make some stupid half-arsed decision without me, because this time, swear to God, I will never forgive you. Together. You and me. Do you understand?”
Sherlock's eyebrows furrowed and he sat back, confusion and disbelief written on his face. "What are you saying?"
"I wish I had not either...all of the times I did. No matter what I do, or why, it always comes down to you and this need to be cross with me on every possible occasion. You have hated me every moment since...since I returned.  I did what you asked.  I have lived every second hoping and begging for you to forgive me.   I am nothing to you now but some habit you can't quite stomach and you can't quite break..."
He was torn between the fact that he could have done it and saved Sherlock and the fact that Sherlock had murdered an unarmed man in cold blood. John had done the same thing technically but he could at least use the excuse of the fake gun Jefferson Hope was holding.  They should have thanked him because Magnussen was a despicable bastard and it was in defense of Mary but none of that could ever be brought into the light of day, so John was stuck in this weird guilty angry fog with no direction other than his wife.
John didn't scream or shed tears. He just sat back down and grew very still. He eventually laid his head on the desk and closed his eyes. Whatever Mycroft had in mind was fine. It was all fine, in fact. All fine.
By the time they stopped, John was sucking wind, having lost some stamina in the last year. Finally, they are on the other side of Regent's Park and Sherlock turned down a short mews and stepped up to a blue door, unlatching it without a key and held it open for John to follow. They took a moment to catch their breath and leaned against the wall, laughing at the absurdity of having to take such precautions.
“Oh god. What the hell,” John replied with a knowing smirk. “You may as well give up this time. Not happening.”
Molly doesn't answer. Her head is throbbing. She reclines on the sofa and closes her eyes. The static in her mind grows louder and she hears distant bits of past conversation, sees flashes of John's face and can almost feel the wind on her face as John had gotten on his knees before her. She was trying to connect that moment to this one and understand the gauntlet of ill-fated choices that had allowed her to be in this place. She doesn't want to move until this makes sense to her.
John's mind could not be compared to Sherlock's intellect. That didn't mean he was stupid either. John was a doctor and he could only achieve that because he was brilliant when compared to the general population. Only near Sherlock did he lose the races, and certainly not all the races. Sherlock had spaces of vast material storage in his mind, yet in some ways he was nearly stunted by any average man standards. Sherlock had a mind for puzzles far above any conceivable intelligence range, yet he could not remember to eat or pay rent or contemplate the solar system. Simple things were beyond him. John functioned well in vastly more subjects then Sherlock. He had the ability to slowly plod along and do most anything well with practice.
John stirred at the touch on his shoulder.  He inhaled deeply and scrunched his face up before asking, “How long was I asleep?”
"No, love. Nothin' like that. Just come sit here." He smiles as if he's paying dearly for the gesture, and again motions her to have a seat. His familiarity jolts her and she finally registers his face isn't just full of hesitant regret, but pity.
When John had asked about the violin, the man's eyes dropped and he looked disgusted. When he asked him to play, standing there in the darkness cloaked room with his cane gripped tight, to keep from shivering in the cool light of this man, Sherlock had gestured for him to sit and then lifted the instrument and tucked it under his chin. John had taken his place, what would soon be his chair, and his eyes closed as the man began to tell him all John needed to know from the waves he brought forth.
He seemed to be discarding a lot of the tinsel and getting to the stickier bits of tree he'd avoided for so long. If he could have spoken this frankly to his therapist, the woman may have had a chance to help him. With Rat, there are no trust issues involved. He had trusted Rat with his life on countless occasions. John's heart may have been a little beaten up from time to time by the man, but in every other way, there was a bond between the two men that served to overthrow any fear John would have in opening up to Rat about things he could not manage to say to other people.
It crossed his mind that Sherlock had not killed on the spur of the moment, but had planned to complete Mary’s mission all along. He had been too eager and far too concerned with making certain John said exactly the right words with exactly the right inflection. Sherlock knew he had virtually no chance of coming back today and he’d made sure John could go with him with a clear heart if that was the way the cards fell.
Sherlock and John were not the most charming of people. The two of them were a lot like her and yet she was standing here to be judged and Mary – sweet, kind, soon to be a mother – would have to survive the consequences of the one she’d tried so hard to leave behind.
John looks at him in anger but it melts to resolved guilt. "I can't say you would be wrong. I have never. I deal with it all the time of course with patients, and there were jokes made of course, but we were never. Not even a kiss, Greg. Yet, to deny that something had affected me seems pointless now. I am not opposed to homosexuality, it just never crossed my mind. I always was certain I was a skirt chasing believer in true love. I am certain I found the true love part in a most unexpected place. "
Moriarty brought him his fifth pip as insurance. Things didn't go as smoothly as planned. John had done the unexpected. Moriarty had never intended to kill Sherlock. He'd wanted something else. If not, there was no purpose to the entire bomb game.
Had Sherlock considered overdosing John on heroin and when his heart stopped, following him?  He thought of it every day.  He had exquisitely pure supplies just in case any of the meddlers decided to take his John away.
Molly doesn't follow most of what he just said, but she tries to remember which Detective Inspector is named Lestrade. She narrows it down to two possible people, but doesn't remember any young officer in either's company last week. She wonders if this wife got the man before her fired.
"I can tell how worried about my face you were when you came up with the plan to slam me into a bridge…and a boat." John grumbles then winces. "Where the hell am I anyway? And why do I smell like garlic?"
“ Getting to that, it's next on the list. Just let me do this. “ Sherlock throws himself back in frustration.
It was a relief to see Sherlock in all honesty, though it did not escape John’s notice that Sherlock seemed to be dealing with John’s death far better than had been true in the reverse.  Sherlock was thinner than he’d been during their Baker Street days, but he had been thinner when they had had their little talk back in London.  He looked pretty healthy considering his best friend had jumped off a bridge after he left him to rot.
“Sorry I was such a rubbish boyfriend and an unfaithful fiancé. Why are you returning the ring? That at least was real, my love. Shouldn’t you sell it and spend the money on slutty holidays and tanning cream?”
Her speech about how she would do anything to keep him from finding out didn’t say much for her cause. She was using future tense. If it suited her purpose, she would kill his best friend without regret. She knew where John was when they met. As a matter of fact, she had gone to rather extraordinary lengths to stop him from following his dead friend. The second time she had saved him, he’d fallen in love with her that exact moment.
He sat in his flat that night, thinking of how strange life could be. There was something about the man that seemed dangerous and yet destined.
“You are a rubbish shot, Sherlock. I’m in more danger that you will miss them and kill me than I probably am from your mystery assassin!” John grumbled as Billy fidgeted with the lighting.
The first day the director ignored him. As he left the main gate, John asked for his autograph. The director narrowed his eyes but complied obviously a little flattered, but not fooled by the kid who had shown his arrogance thinking he could walk on and be of any use to important people. The next day John arrived with a notebook and spent the day watching and scribbling. Again he asks for the director's autograph. He'd scrawled his name in John's notebook but in a less friendly way.
"You are a bloody prat, and I'd have to be mad to miss you. So get on with it, you and your superior grin have more you want to say. Go on then, no need to relish it. Spit it out."
“You were a rubbish big brother.” John tosses out there. “Don’t worry, we all are. I was dreadful to Harry. Still am in some ways.  Though I didn’t tell her that she was going to be blown away by the terrible east wind if she didn’t do what I wanted.  That was bloody genius.  Cruel as all hell, but genius.“
Billy was beyond solicitous toward Mrs. Hudson and could usually be found puttering round, tinkering with fixtures, painting things and making general repairs without being asked. Sherlock more than tolerated Billy, he liked the fact that Billy, despite his hard Estuary grammar and ridiculously exaggerated glottal stops, was quite brilliant. It was uncanny how William Wiggins resembled Sherlock when dressed in Sherlock’s cast offs. Unlike Sherlock, he was rarely seen without a tie, though he somehow managed to make even Sherlock’s ultra-conservative hand-me-downs look a little twee.
John was helpless to do more than run. He can't speak. He follows a ghost made flesh and it called him so deeply he can do little else but match the long strides with his own shorter ones. He doesn't care where he's leading; only that Sherlock is real, and John is gloriously getting to run in the rain and the dark with the feeling of hope in tomorrow. Sherlock was racing ahead, not looking back and John ran one step behind, just where he belonged.
He ran into an old friend. He was teaching now. He'd gotten amazingly fat. They went to lunch and it was nice to reminisce.
“So it’s no walk in the park. I’m not stupid, here. The two of us had a few situations that could have ended a lot less favorably. It’s not the same, you know. Doing something you love, something that matters and fate coming to call. That is sad, sure, but not on the same level as thinking you are so unimportant that the end of your existence is all you have left that matters. You waded in to bring him back last time. That actually did mean something to him, in case you missed the important part with all the posing the two of you have to put on for show. If it had been me who pulled the trigger, my body would already be mulching some London formal garden, the bits chopped so tiny nobody would ever find a tooth. I get it, Mycroft. I do. I think I speak for my very talented wife as well, when I say that should you ever need to call upon us, once the baby has arrived, that there is no call the two of us would not answer on his behalf.”
“What it amounts to. Don’t worry, that’s basically the standard package in my business.  All you need to know is, Maestro lives, Sherlock lives and Tiger or his people better hope they get arrested.  As for the others, if they look like they are shooting at you, or considering it, call them fair game.” Ford explains simply.
Sherlock’s mouth was open and he was completely blank. John patiently waited. He got up and fixed himself a stiff whiskey and brought a second glass for Sherlock.
“But you didn’t trust me? I never had to choose between you and him did I, Mary? You and Sherlock both think I am too stupid and useless to say anything important to. I thought you were so amazing for accepting him so readily. But that wasn’t what it was about. Not just for me was it? You liked knowing you had fooled Sherlock Holmes? I thought you were day and night, but you’re twins. I am the only one stupid enough to put up with you both, because other people see. He used everyone for a case, proposed to Janine, just to get in the door. And you? You married me for the same kind of reason. A disguise.”
“What makes you think that it is your help I require? Perhaps I am here to simply inquire after your health.” Mycroft twisted his umbrella handle, finding the activity mesmerizing.
"Tanned it myself. Stinky business…tanning." The smile grows sinister, "That reminds me, where is Mr. Fellows? Always pay my respects." Ford gestured to the mantle.
"Why didn't you. Why did you care? I have nothing to give anyone and most people see that at once. You never stopped. From that first day, you never made fun of me. You slowly sunk to my moral cesspit and now you have lost. Everything you were is gone. " He rolls slightly; she can feel his breath on her face and him stirring again against her thigh.
The 'call ended' notification lit up John's phone.  He replied anyway, assuming the tosser could probably still hear him. "Yeah. Okay then. And do feel free to suck my cock any time you need a little of that ego of yours brought back to planetary levels."
She asked what he liked for breakfast. Who his favorite author was and how that related to his personality. She let him think of the tiny details of Sherlock Holmes that nobody but he knew.
"I don't care about that," Sherlock says smiling slightly and shrugging into his great chunky Belstaff and arranging his scarf on the way out the door.
John swallows and nods. "Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade told me once that Sherlock is a great man. He said he hoped one day that he'd be a good one as well. At that moment, I didn't know what to say, because he was the first one who had said something that didn't sound like a warning label for serial killers. The thing is, he doesn't have to be good, or well liked or a cheerful ball of levity. People don't hate him and fear him because he's damaged, and he is damaged, but that isn't why they are cruel to him."
Sherlock certainly didn't notice that the girl who brought him the coffee was insanely lovesick for him. He didn't notice that John was within hours of suicide, nor was he careful with his feelings while rattling off that his injury might be all in his head. John on the other hand, had formed some opinion of his aloof arrogance and the reasons behind his sleepless claim. The difference was John had a filter. He didn't state that Sherlock was possibly ADHD with autistic tendencies and that he was maladjusted to his environment because he presented some indicators of Asperger's syndrome as well as sociopathic detachment due to some probable childhood trauma.
That was what Sherlock's last phone call meant to John Watson. Is this big enough for you to see? Can your simple little mind conceive what I felt for you now? How carelessly you took my secretly offered heart and weighed it and bagged it. Now move on and figure out all the clues I left you.
John’s face grew red, “That’s none of your business.  In fact, what I do or don’t do is officially none of your concern…ever again.”  He stood up and headed for the door.
Mary challenged him and that was part of her appeal. Now his own battle monster peeked at this woman and he stood in that narrow room and dared her to show him what she really could do. He smiled his adrenaline fueled taunt and he saw her eyes blank and cool preparing to strike. Sherlock picked that moment to announce that they were going to Baker Street to sort this out. There wasn’t anything to sort. Two samurai stood on a bridge with the calm pleasure of battle in their blood and each knew striking first is a lost advantage.
“And you may have not liked who came home to London.  It changes you and not for the better.” John’s chin lifted and his lips jutted forward.  Sherlock knew he had more he wanted to say, but was attempting to control how much he shared.
[11:06 – He has been retrieved. Resuscitation measures had to be taken. They will do all they can. How did this occur? M]
He snorted and rubbed his nose and seemed a bit taller all of a sudden, amused at the pretty little nurse playing all tough. “Don’t play stupid. You know who I am. I have bad days. That’s pretty much all I have. Makes chasing skirts and finding out later that that great shag cost me something private and they twisted some minor comment to sell a paper? It makes the whole idea a bit not good. I hoped for a while, sure I did, but I learned the hard way, didn’t I? ”
"Fine. Will you get a move on? Your liver is probably not all that is at stake and I demand prior claim to some of your bits." Sherlock said with a poignant widening of his eyes.
The arrangement had not been without compromise. Physicians, caregivers and other meddlers had full access to John and could end Sherlock’s trials if any of them deemed John to be in physical danger.  There was little fruit for all Sherlock’s labors after two years.  But John could eat and walk again.  He responded to simple commands.  His eyes sometimes followed Sherlock around the room.
Ford snorted through his nose then lifted his chin and coldly asked, “You were with him weren’t you?  You and Tiger?  I never believed the story you told me about the roof.  All this time and you were with him too.”
Sherlock snickered into his sleeve but stayed put. The cab driver didn't take long to decide he was not interested in examining or solving ghost stories. He knew what he'd heard about this place and now he'd seen it with his own eyes.
He called her a client. Oh that was a deep cut, and so she sat, as she was told to do. She handed them the ammunition to justify anything they wanted to do to her. Big brother would probably be popping round any second to secure John’s interest in her abdomen and she would not be taken. This was her last hurrah. It was out of her hands and just for a second, she let John see her breaking and when his eyes met hers for that spit second, she saw that he wanted to actually believe Sherlock’s preposterous account of the office scene.
John seemed to have bloomed into the epitome of God's gift to the female population and there had been few references lately to any undercurrent of closets or rainbows associated with the crime solving team of renowned reputation. Watson was offered the sacred title of Consulting Detective which he flatly turned down stating there would only ever be one of those. Still he had been keeping himself in the loop and his constant study and expansion of Sherlock's fame had given him a deeper ability to put details into strings of flow that ended in solved.
Molly cast a sideways glance at the man she was sharing her lunch with. He'd finished his and was eyeing her half. "There's crisps if you want them. But you like dead bodies… in what way? Not making them, I hope."
“That is your job? Have you and Mycroft ever kissed and made up or are you still avoiding his umbrella?” Sherlock smirked and squeezed her hand.
Sherlock shook his head, face perfectly smooth of emotion and yet his eyes changed from cool slate to rain-slick sage as he rumbled in his deep purr, "How you must hate me, my dear John Watson."
Fifteen minutes later, John is quite occupied, when a shocking sound stops him and freezes him in place for ten heartbeats. His head slowly rotates and The Woman stands framed in the Maltese sunset. She smiles wickedly naked as the day they had met and strikes a pose, letting her body shimmer with power and playful challenges. "Maybe he was kidding, but you weren't. Doctor Watson, I would like to introduce you to my riding crop. It seems Sherlock and I have something else in common. Not to mention a special, shall we say adoration for wickedly brave soldiers who happen to need a good scolding?"
John sat for long minutes, staring horrified at Sherlock as he digested the detective’s words. A deep breath made him shudder and he swallowed several times. “Right then. I should probably…” John’s voice dropped and he blushed, he leaned closer and his pupils dilated as he hesitantly spoke, “You know, Sherlock…”
"Mr. Wheatley, it's me. Merletta's son? I threw up on you when I was four. You snuck me a glass of the wrong eggnog?"
He glanced around again, ears beginning to buzz with adrenaline fueled fear as his instincts told him of imminent danger a split second before the peaceful symphony darkened into pure smoking hell and chaos.
Every day he did this and finally after a week the man couldn't stand it any longer and had demanded to know what the heck the kid thought he was doing. John had smiled and said that he could learn a lot even if he didn't get to work on the set. "I'm studying you, sir."
John seemed to wilt in defeat. He poured more whiskey and the understanding that Sherlock was right slowly sunk in. At last he raised his eyes to his friend and made one last stand. “The one time I count on you to be a selfish child, you are the one with integrity. Tell me the real reason for that and I will do exactly as you ask.”
Molly's eyes are wide and fearful. She has never seen Sherlock act like this. Her own voice is soft and timidly gentle, "So burning the world is what you think he would want? You think it is some sort of justice, for John?"
Sherlock and John would be quickly brainstorming, joking like little boys and in general in their manic energy mode whilst ignoring the achingly adoring looks they passed each other every few seconds and Mary knew she would be stood to the side.  They always forgot about her but as she joined them at the foot of the stairs, she slowly and unobtrusively began taking it all in.
He found it amusing that John held the things between them as some lesser labeled encounter and told himself it was just casual.  It was true that in their past, they did not engage in penetrative relations, but if John were fellated by a woman, he would not clamor to his ridiculous definitions of what constitutes real sex.   John was a physician and certainly knew the professional description of sex.  Ford loved slightly pushing John into new territory so he could watch him struggle to rewrite his head-canon delineations of his masculinity.
John's breathing was barely controllable now and his eyes sparkled with hatred for the man before him.  "I wish you had never come back.  There."
The stars are brilliant. The earth rotates around the sun, John. I have no regrets, John. I did the right thing. I do wish…
“Maybe I should grow a full beard this time. That ought to hurry him along. Prefers his doctors clean shaven my back side,” John joked.
Sherlock wilts as if crestfallen. He looks down and picks at his trousers. His voice is deep but quiet, "No one has ever said that to me before. Never."
"If I have to lose them, I will find a good home for them. I love them even more now.  I told my sorrows to the bees...and they heard me."
“That doesn’t mean I don’t respect him. My first intention was to offer my apology. She had no idea you and John were on this case. I offered her sanctuary within hours of your injury. She declined then and has continued to do so. Secondly, I have come to ask for your continued assistance and plead that you will understand that only my sentiment for you would bring me to make such disclosure. Your brother needs you. If he loses this battle with that disgusting maggot, his career most certainly and quite probably his life will be over. I do know there is a certain history of conflict, but surely your past two years with me have proven his devotion to your wellbeing.” She tilted her head and brushed away a curl from his forehead.
"I would have kept it better, if I'd had some clue what to do. I just couldn't pack it away. I wanted to imagine it was waiting for you."
“You know I have never done that.  Not with anyone.  Why is this even an issue? If you want to discuss childish--”
She examined it, trying to understand what the universe was trying to say, by putting this in her grasp. Was it a token to remember or was it a sign that things happen for a reason. Maybe it was even a message for her to keep looking and its owner would turn up.
“No idea what you are talking about. No to the rest, but yes, I will help you.” Sherlock opened his eyes and turned his head to look at his brother.
Am I being cruel? Maybe, but I love you and I do hope you win. If you don't, I understand and I am sure you will see that I never meant to bore you.
He felt like at that moment if he showed her just a glimpse of who Captain Watson had been, there was every chance that she would put him out of his misery. Mary was very easy going on small things but he’d seen her put her foot down too and seen her wrestle unruly patients to the floor with such efficiency that it had stopped him in his tracks. They play fought, like siblings at times and on more than one occasion he’d wondered if she had let him win.
Queen Elizabeth the First had a tower full of brilliant ravens and look what she accomplished with their council. Queen Mary banished most of them, in her normal bloody fashion. Yes, there were truths behind the myths. Bloody Mary had faith in Rome, not ravens. Good Queen Bess had faith in her clever birds and they had served her with faith in England.
John probably would have known this and somehow weighted himself in such a way to guarantee he was not found. If the two of them had not been in the middle of such a row though and John had died, Mycroft wouldn't have put it past John to have approved of such a plan. John was an odd little man at times. He seemed to get Sherlock's sense of humor in ways that baffled Mycroft.
“Liked it.” John met his eyes for a moment then looked away, out the window again as if longing to be elsewhere.
Lestrade looks like his heart is about to break, his chin quivers and he looks ceiling-ward as he takes a deep breath, then shakes his head. "I regret to inform you, that John Watson has, by our best guess, perished," he says, reverting to his usual Yarder method of delivering news to loved ones. He'd wanted to say it kinder and not make it sound so much like a stranger, but he'd resorted to what he knew, to keep himself from making a cocked-up mess of it, trying to soften something that could not be polished.
He looked at Molly, wanting to express how much he was hurting right this minute too. John had been changed by Sherlock's death, hell they all were, but he'd been coming back from that broken place finally. " John was a fine man, by the way. Brave. So damned loyal," Greg sighed with frustration and sorrow. When he continued his voice broke, "So bloody wasteful. All those brains, both of 'em."
Moriarty, in this case was not a family name, but a title. James Moriarty was never a man any more than Richard Brook was an actor. Mori means to die. Moriarty means a great navigator of the seas. He has no known children, yet it is said that they are searching for his heir.
The director stopped. "Still not very impressed, but at least your truthful. What else do you have jotted down there?"
Moriarty was dead according to Sherlock, John and Mycroft. It was not a live picture, but a looped animation. Somebody was faking this.
"And before you wave it away...it gets worse.  I knew Culverton Smith was going to kill you.  I came to the hospital and said goodbye, knowing I would never see you alive again...and...I left you to it.  I left you to die...and I have to live with that."
Off they went into the unknown. John had no idea what to expect. He had no idea what was wanted of him. He tried to play along, but as he stepped out of the crime scene, realizing he'd again been left behind without so much as a word, he stomped away with no intention of ever speaking to Sherlock again.
Mycroft reclined in his chair and stretched languidly. He would see to it that Sherlock would be a Raven and not Moriarty's heir. He hoped Miss Hooper would have something of value to contribute to his effort.
John and he had been skittering around the change in how they viewed the other for some time. They had somehow become a couple, without becoming a couple. John and he had never discussed the way they interacted now. It was ignored and carefully avoided on all surface levels.
Mycroft's face didn't betray his anger but his words conveyed it spectacularly. "I am thrilled you find this situation so amusing. I am about to send Sherlock out on the most dangerous assignment I have ever allowed him to attempt, without you. I have the choice of either allowing him to do it with what small protections I can manage or watch him try to fool me, disappear and do it anyway. Can you deduce the probable results of such an action? I do hope I will be able to keep him intact when he understands my warning of your imminent demise was factual. He thinks I have omniscient powers and only deny his whims to annoy him. I have limits, you know. I am asking, one last time. I can't force you. For a man who repeatedly proposed to die for Sherlock Holmes, you now appear determined to see the opposite come to fruition."
John takes a deep breath and shakes his head. "Most things I didn't have to tell him. Jesus, he could tell if I'd had a wank in the shower, but some things, he just never quite put together. I didn't talk about it. It is fatally ingrained to not talk about it to civilians. I would never talk about it to anyone but a brother. You know me better, Rat. "
"So, you're with Scotland Yard then?" She asks, knowing he's probably telling her a lie if he claims he is. Sleeping on a bench in his condition was too much even for an undercover detective. She wants to like him and has the urge to help him, but there isn't much to be done for someone who doesn't want help and he seemed to have burned his bridge with someone who had been trying.
“That I what?” Sherlock slowed his pacing and focused his attention on John, trying to deduce an unchanging memory, yet forgetting for an instant that this John could only exude cues Sherlock’s mind created.
Molly retreats, aghast that Mycroft Holmes doesn't have an answer, she pleads, "I couldn't have guessed…not ever, that it might come to…this. I didn't have a choice. You weren't there."
"Oh really? So, what have you learned from way over there?" the director had asked making it plain that he thought John was a snot-nosed prat.
"He wouldn't do it like that. He's a doctor. Drowning hurts. It takes too long. Eighteen minutes to expire, Greg. It's horrible. He wouldn't do it like that," she is reasoning it through, using her training and experience to convince Greg of his error. She's determined to persuade him this cannot be.
“Shh. Please.  Never ever mention him to…”he nods toward the back of the plane.  “You must swear to me, John.  It will drive him to…worse than this.  Sherrinford was everything to Sherlock.  The action man I broke, if you will.”
John let anger melt to acceptance and dropped his eyes and nodded. "Okay.  Yeah.  When Mary...left.  I was...incredibly...angry.  I suspected Mary seduced you...I...cannot excuse myself for thinking that to justify what I was up to...but that happened.  Like you said.  Everything but.  I felt horrible about it. Tried to end it even...then..well.  I'm sorry I lied on top of it all."
John stared at the pavement. His head shook. Sherlock loved high places. The image of him standing on the stones his coat flapping in the wind and of the moon behind him as he leaped high on a roof as graceful as a manor cat. He must have been so afraid. Yet he lied to me. Why was that the most important part?
Sherlock joined him and added, "Bit ill-advised, but he'd already recognized me. This makes a much better story."
John stated events in the style of a debriefing and was careful to provide an honest analytical analysis of his experiences and state of mind, expecting no judgment or advice and receiving exactly what he anticipated. Rat never took his eyes off John, mumbling an encouraging something in his throat from time to time or nodding.
Mary chimed in, “Yes he does. You move people like chess pieces and he’s not a chess piece.  He’s your brother.  You can’t put us on the board and turn out the lights because John and I will not play by the rules. Neither does Sherlock.  You know that.  You’ve seen that.  If you want our help and I assume this concave of people are the closest thing you have to a circle of trust and I am on double secret probation …But if you want us,  you have to give us a map?  We can’t be left to guess then be blamed when all hell breaks loose?”
Sweat beaded on Mycroft's upper lip. Visions of Sherlock Moriarty clouded his eyes with tears. They are searching for his heir. What happens when the heir is found?
Her first flutter of honest love for John had made its home in her heart right here. They had noisily spent themselves and after she had returned to reality and her mind had come down from the chemical rush of this ridiculous moment of unguarded passion; her first reaction had been shame. Her head rested on this table, John's weight and breath heavy on her as she took stock of her skirt raked up and her knickers stretching painfully around her ankles and tangled in her stockings. She still had her shoes on and she could feel fluids leaching slowly down her leg. They had not even used a condom, which was mortifyingly against her rules and John had been so adamant on this point.
The Rat roared with laughter, earning a watchful glance from the driver who happened to pull into Baker Street and stop the cab just at this time. John bailed out and while the cab fare was settled, John made use of the rainy sidewalk, decorating it with the tarry contents of his stomach. His former commander and father of his former flat-mate was still laughing as he slapped John on the back and told him he must have developed a weak stomach for good coffee.
John waited outside at fifteen minutes before seven o'clock. Sherlock swept out of a cab with grace and a genuine smile as he extended his hand and formally introduced himself. He seemed in a more amiable state of mind in the rare London sun and John couldn't help but smile with pleasure at the unusual history and easy dynamics between Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson. Mrs. Hudson mothered Sherlock as he pretended not to notice in any way, yet his lack of frustration with her chatter said far more than the taciturn replies he'd demonstrated the day before.
The well-dressed man seemed very certain that John was physically involved with Sherlock. Twice in one evening, that was rather telling, yet he had seen no sign of that sort of interest. He sighed at the prospect of moving in with a person on the wrong side of the government, who the very people he'd agreed to assist mentioned as a future murderer, and who, on top of it all, seemed to make everyone he encountered at once assume he was Gay.
He had planned to go home one day.  He needed Mycroft to figure it out.  He needed his son’s resources to get out cleanly and quietly.  He had become something of an entity unto himself, so long as he was active, but he knew that it would take dynamite to pry him from the arms of his controllers.  A change of venue would be needed before he made any steps toward exit.  He needed Mycroft to recruit him and so far his son was obviously oblivious.  This however, changed the game, and his youngest son needed his help far more than his oldest son needed his curiosity mollified.
John relaxed and returned the smile. “I will go.to a hotel or maybe stay with Harry. I can't go to her. Not yet. I am going to try to sort things in my head but I will be here...text me? I will see you tomorrow.”
“No he’s not. Besides, what is a dragon slayer, without his Wizard?” Mary murmured and slipped her arm into his looking up at him with genuine affection.
Mycroft sighs and is resolved that he has never had any way to control Sherlock and his whims. "I will do what I can, but the rules have changed. I will not endanger good men to bring about the return of your pet soldier gone a bit rabid."
"Sherlock?" John said out loud. You were trying to impress me. This is not very impressive. You couldn't have researched me, because Mike didn't tell you I was coming. But a suicide, you would have researched. You would not do it this sloppily by your own will. Magic trick.
Sherlock finally gives in with a sigh and asks softly as if still far away, "May I take your silence as invitation to offer my rational process of thought, that you might understand the scope of the burdens I have carried and the sorrows I have endured at your absence? I take full responsibility, but it has not been your exclusive heart at risk of agony. "
John contemplated what he meant by that statement but gave up trying to guess. Ford would tell him when he wanted him to know. John settled down and quickly finished his task.
Rat took a very deep breath analyzing his friend’s seeming defeat and attempting to make some connection to his unfathomable actions. His voice was low and soft now, a whispered grumble acknowledging that he knew he was treading on very delicate ice, “What do you mean?”
John stood in the cemetery, not sure how to feel anymore. Maybe he was moving on."I have done the unthinkable, Sherlock. I have survived this horror by doing the one thing you would probably hate me for. You're a damned legend now. You are a dead hero, worshiped for his emotional sacrifice. Held up as the measure of a good soul. Yet, I am still without you. I ask myself, what now? I am supposed to be happy now, moving on. I have a bit, you know. But, you are not here. I'm alone and all I want is to follow you. Could you forgive me if I did?"
John shook his head, “Not yet, going into shock.  Needs a hospital.  He’s been shot at least twice and at his age…”
“Think. Look around. Is it silly enough for you? Gothic churches?  Costumes? Is it all mad enough yet?  Do you see?  It isn’t real. None of it is real.  This is all in your mind.”  John’s voice edges toward panic.  Sherlock’s eyes are wide open and he is not comprehending any of his surroundings.
"Did he love you? I don't just think it, look at the evidence. Do you know how many flat mates he'd been through? Do you have any idea how many of them lasted less than a week? I don't know if you realize this, But Mycroft came to me only two months after you moved in. He was livid. Sherlock had changed his will and Mycroft wanted that gold digger, meaning you, away from his little brother. He was pretty sure the two of you were a couple. He wouldn't have believed that if Sherlock had not indicated some affirmation of that?"
The breath had been knocked out of him and his lower legs were sending throbbing shrieks to his brain, while he tried to disentangle himself and draw a choking breath in the darkness.  He could hear metal chairs clanking and footsteps before the sounds began to crescendo into wails of pain and fear and confusion.
They were so busy with themselves that neither of them noticed Sherlock’s obviously deteriorating condition. He stood and even whilst his heart must have been giving its final rhythmic lurches, Sherlock had made John focus on Magnussen as the enemy. She swallowed, wondering if his dying words would be that John could trust her.
"Oh it's been a long time, since you ran off to Hollywood to be a star or some such, but of course I do." She winked at his mother and added, "You could probably turn this whole resurrection thing to an advantage. Start a religion or something? Good money there."
John felt his skin prickle. He searched the surroundings, while pretending to pray. He turned back to the stone, pushing off the sensation to his own foolish hope. "If only I could have told you this thing on my heart. Seen you laugh at me for it, maybe then. I will never know for certain now. I have to deduce what you meant and it just isn't good enough. Some nights, I think you must have known, but others I just know you didn't. What do they say about protesting too much? What if I hadn't? What if I hadn't lied to you? Or myself? If I say I am fine. Do you know the truth? Would you know? Did you?"
John took a deep calming breath before opening the door.  His first shock was a lone bee greeting him and flying awkwardly out the door as he entered.
John’s eyes close as his wife’s voice suddenly booms in his ear-bud demanding in a playfully friendly tone whether or not Sherlock owns this empty house. She enters, in her familiar coat with a stance and an attitude he’s only seen once before. John takes on the body language of a dying man in a wheel chair and he is really not even acting.
He nodded in agreement as he continued, " Sherlock was brilliant. So I have no idea what he did know or didn't. He trusted me more the night I met him than he did when he jumped off that bloody roof. His brother had my public records, but he never said a word to me if he knew more. I think he could have gotten the clearance, if he'd known to look. He seemed to know about everything else going on. But Sherlock's brother, well, he put a lot of trust in me…but I think it was because he didn't intimidate me…much. I thought a lot of him at one time. I can't say I trusted him, not after he sold Sherlock out. He didn't know at the time. But, it changed how I …I don't know, he's not particularly likable, but I had come to respect him. I doubt that can ever be fixed, and all this time, he watched me suffer. He could have kidnapped me and stopped all of this…it's a letdown when someone has your trust and…just blows you off. They both did that." John cleared his throat, careful to keep the sound of accusation toward Ford out of his tone, "Sherlock was the one person who I… of all the people. Even after he died, I trusted him." John shakes his head in confusion and looks into Rat's eyes. "I don't know when or why he stopped trusting me. But none of that matters anymore. Now, your turn. What has Tiger done this time?"
John’s eyes had met his former commanders for a split second and yet he had not shouted for help or made any gesture that said he acknowledged his presence.  His eyes had filled with tears and he’d closed them as he spoke,  “Your sister likes my cock better than any of yours and as soon as you little bastards get done, I’ll be giving her a knock up.”
“Don’t be like that, John. Jealousy is such an ugly way to show affection. Flowers and chocolate are a bit cliché but they do make your intentions much clearer.” Janine said with innocently wide eyes and a huge gleeful smirk.
"You don't like me, because even you missed it. I see. Does it really bother you that much?" John blinks and smiles, his charming disarming face.
One of them laughed and knelt beside John, a blade in his hand. “You won’t be having a chance, mate.  Shoulda’ just forked out a few quid.  We still nicked that, but now you die soon as we quit finding your ass worth the trouble of holding you down.  You just meat now, old man.  Another word and I start with your tongue.”
She wondered again what John had meant when he told her he had loved men in the past but had said he had 'not really' made love to them. She assumed it meant he had dallied with a man or two, but had some silly definition of his own about what sex was or wasn't. She would have had such fun dragging such an explanation out of him, bit by teasing bit, until he laughed and went on a rant about his bizarre self-analytical hedging. None of it mattered, at all.
John’s lost expression was broken and his forehead wrinkled in confusion. “I’m sorry. Frilly or Granny what?”
Provided all those things fail to kill him, he has hypothermia, and probable pathogen borne infection to contemplate, while praying it's a low chemical load day and that nobody dumped anything near the river that will cost him his eyes or all his skin for that matter. Swimming in the Thames was a bad idea, no matter how confidently a Holmes said it would work.
"I imagine it must rate right up there with giving Mycroft a foot massage, while smiling and asking his opinion on tobacco ash?"
Seeing Sherlock working so hard to find John's magic 'yes' button was both comical and so very sad. John had so rarely set his foot down and denied Sherlock anything, that the poor man truly hadn't realised that John had it in him to do so.
: John and Molly would never have noticed each other if he were not dead. The thing is, Molly knows he isn't and she never expected things to get this complicated. Welcome back to Part two, If you thought the first part was complicated, well you are in for a bit more. Please keep your hands inside the compartment at all times.
The meddlers came and went and he knew nothing of their comings and goings.  Exhaustion had finally claimed his mind and Sherlock estimated he’d been asleep for at least thirty-six hours when something gently touched his cheek.  He opened his eyes to find John standing over him.
"I love her very much. I just, loved a dead man more and she really caught on once we were married. I evidently dreamed in embarrassing detail. Out loud."
It was joked that the Holmes family had been behind the crown since England had been an outpost of Rome. There were four families who were called the magic behind the majesty. There is a legend that says when the ravens leave the tower of London, England would fall. There are actual captive birds who people think her majesty has discourse with for advice. It is a silly fairytale much beloved by the tourists and touted as fact.
John smiled his fuck-you smile and cleared his throat. “She hasn’t forgiven me for getting Sherlock shot. Probably disappointed it wasn’t me instead.”
"Not important right now. You planning to make friends with them? Hand me over to them? Or are you calculating my value, against how loose my canon may be?"
"He told me soon after the two of you met that there was far more to his John than I could imagine. I see now that he was understating that fact."
Sherlock didn't bother with saying goodbye. Mycroft's former boss just appeared far below, looking older, but still as grand as a peacock. His attention turned toward his purpose for coming to London.
John wouldn't have made it at all if he hadn't met Sherlock. He had never planned a future financially. Gambling during his recovery period had left him in a financial bind. Sherlock had made living possible. He'd also taken it away, when he had died. Now things were worse than ever but John knew some of the fault had been his own as well. He'd been angry and he'd played with Sherlock. Sherlock was just too fragile to play with John. There was nothing he could do for him now.
John didn't get a chance to say more than, "Sherlock," before he stormed out the door. It didn't slam, but the whisper-snick of the security engaging sounded similar to John.
John knows there is a lot of activity going on and someone is kissing him as he spews something burnt, oily and nasty like a frigid volcano. Everything hurts and something is determined to shove at least one of his broken ribs into his lungs. He shoves the kisser aside and vomits, nearly aspirates before hands guide him to lie on his side and still there is more erupting from him. His pain level is so great that he feels his bowels and bladder release and he doesn't care in the least.
They don't sleep afterward, but each dozes with their own thoughts for a time. It was warm against him though the chill of air swirls around them, trying to escort them into compliant wakefulness.
Sherlock smiled, set his bag and violin down and looked back. He turned back to the man and asked, "Surely you don't believe in those old tales of crossroads, do you? Modern man like you? Sun's up, you're perfectly safe," he said spreading his hands as if to ask what there could be to fear.
" He has a note in his left pocket. It is on yellow linen paper, folded precisely in the origami shape of the crane. The shape means loyalty and honor but the color means freedom. The ink is crimson, perhaps for his school teacher, or perhaps to represent love. And it says,…Oh God." Sherlock sits down and stops speaking.
John genuinely laughs for the first time in an eternity. Maybe it is the smooth liquor making him feel less despondent, or maybe it is the cold truth of the photo's again packed safely in the file and locked back in the inspector's briefcase. Maybe it is the finality of it all that has unburdened him slightly, but John laughs heartily at the image of himself sequestered in this empty apartment with three dozen cats and, and a box of new kittens scampering through the piles of Sherlock's life.
Sherlock speaks calmly, " I was not a selfish lover. I hope I wasn't. I was rather beyond desperate the first round, but it wasn't just sex, John. I have not cried in front of anyone but you since I was a child. I gave her the last tears I will ever shed. I gave her the very last of me."
“Good. Last leg here. I won’t torture you much longer. I hate Janine. I hate her mouth on you and I hate her on your lap and I hate her most of all because she made me feel like a tit and a coward today. I hate her for being right. I don’t hate Mary. I do love her very much and I know she will probably end up sharing more of her ammo with the two of us before this is over. I still think she is beautiful and amazing and she would find a way to be anything I ever demanded of her. She is about to give birth to my child and I want to be a part of that if she will let me. I will protect her and care for her so long as she will allow, but I am not throwing away this.
“Did he say it to you finally? He was really looking peculiar as he got on the plane,” She asked quietly.
"I propose that we see if we can get the two of you to screw your heads on straight and see if we could come to an understanding."
The clip begins with a girl's face smiling and saying 'Hi' to her mother. In the background a man can be seen walking. The camera goes from her face and suddenly focuses on the man lifting his foot up on the rails. The wind warbles the sound quality and the amateur camera man's breath is clearly heavy as he focuses bumpily from the girl to the man directly behind her climbing the rail. He zooms in at a dizzying speed and the lurching is exacerbated with each breath and twitch he makes. John's face, looks calm with grim determination. He pays no attention to his audience as he finds his center of balance and stands up on the handrails, arms wide for stability.
Molly had spent years dropping subtle hints that she would happily accept his advances if he would simply make one. But, having listened to him make fun of any girl who acted forward towards him, she didn't want to make the same error. Over time she'd let him get away with all sorts of atrocious behavior, and had developed a thick skin when he said things like her mouth was too small or her dandruff was caused by her cheap shampoo. He always told her the truth. In a way, that was a form of intimacy. He didn't mean to make her feel insulted. She'd seen him turn that sort of lethally vengeful scrutiny upon almost everyone who annoyed him.
He has certainly never been opposed to his last gasping breath not being achieved in comfort and luxury, but he honestly felt cheated that his end was not to be more magnificent and interesting. At the very least he had always hoped to go out in some unique fashion while in pursuit of some worthy opponent. This was intolerable, to expire covered in rammy gick felt like an insultingly average death. Mycroft would make such a face. That was at least a bit of a pisser. He smiled at the image while trying to curl onto his side and draw himself up into a more comfortable curl as the pain in his chest screamed
Sherlock grinned, "How is good old Gonzi. I haven't ever thanked him for that thing he did, when I was stuck in Italy."
“You’d be dead.  Right now.  You would actually be dead and have accomplished nothing!” John shouts in frustration.
you?" Molly asks with a shy smile, deciding she likes this man with the fiery eyes and need to stop evil men. He'd passed one test, he hadn't lied.
The phone call ended pleasantly. John sat in Sherlock's old chair and he closed his eyes, wanting to see his ghost clearly again.
Of course he’d hoped like a childish fool and the small progresses had seemed like mountains at first.  He did know the effects of oxygen deprivation on the brain.  He knew the prognosis.  His heart could not accept it.
"Demand 30.  Video is harder to fake so it is worth more.  Bidding war could get 10 more if you try," Sherlock said.
“We have oxygen here and I can get you anything you require. I don’t think he is in any actual danger provided we keep his airway clear and he remains semi-conscious.  I have actually seen him much worse.  I think we should just let him ride it out and …”Mycroft stated.
John had caught up to him, just as it began to rain in earnest and Sherlock had said all he needed to hear, "Follow me," before he turned and jogged off.
Sherlock opens his eyes quickly and speaks rapidly,"Notice the angle. I won't die for hours. Will you still save me, John? " Sherlock closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, as his finger tightens on the trigger.
He’d drunkenly taunted them and hurt them enough to enrage them.  They were in the process of dragging him to a more private location whilst John struggled with consciousness and the four young perverts had relieved their victim of his trousers when Rat had finally stepped in.
Sherlock awoke and stretched. His eyes popped open and he smiled at all his familiar things in their familiar places. He listened for the sound of John in the kitchen. The flat was silent. Sherlock frowned. He sat up and called to John. There was no answer. He must have gone to get pastries. Sherlock took a shower and dressed himself in some of his dusty cloths still hanging in his closet as if he were never away.
[9:51 – I don't regret our moment of bliss. It was worth all of hell to have that one perfect, undeletable memory.]
Did he have a second in command? Hadn’t Sherlock, spent two years tracking them down? Moriarty was a businessman not a terrorist. One didn’t declare that sort of business newly reopened and under new management. All that did was invite people to investigate and insist on taxing your ill-gotten gains.
“Then I would have to remind you, quite forcibly, which of us is a soldier and which of us is a drug addict?” John replied with a chuckle. Sherlock was lost in his palace and yet John could still reach him in some way.
The small talk and John's attempts at conversation at the restaurant, were insanely uncomfortable and never quite ended up in the realm of what John intended. Sherlock and his 'date' were eating on the house. Third time he'd been mistaken for a gay man in his lifetime, all in one night. He tried to broach the subject with Sherlock, hoping to sound casual and let the man know that even if he was gay, it would not affect his decision to be or not be his flat-mate.
John looks down at the syringe, still loaded and ready for his exit. He is trying to understand when he is knocked to the floor by a very heavy, solid ghost.
Sherlock looked mildly offended and replied softly, “Very well. Proceed.” He kept his eyes on John and randomly took one of the chocolates, and popped it in his mouth. “Happy?” he said with the gold dust covered sweet creating a large lump on his cheek.
"Maybe I was just bored. Sherlock? Maybe it was just a good day for it." John turned and tilted his head with a soft smile, the calm soldier.
Six weeks went by and John sat in his chair smiling at the guests.  His speech was still terribly garbled, but Sherlock interpreted.  It kept John from tantrums of frustration that he was still so hard to understand.  There was cake, so Mycroft had shown up.  For once Sherlock didn’t mind.
John stood and began emptying his pockets. He had of course been relieved of all weapons upon arrival. He lined the contents up largest item to smallest. He took off his Jumper and folded it neatly. The shirt was slowly unbuttoned and removed but he began twisting the material as if wringing it out. His eyes seemed to meet those in the monitoring booth, steady, fearless and empty.
He had worn these the night they went to the opera. They had belonged to his grandfather and he'd been upset to discover he'd lost one of them. She wondered if it could have been here all along waiting to be discovered and reunited with its mate. They had walked up and down these stairs countless times since then and she was sure Mrs. Hudson had probably Hoovered many times subsequently, yet this brilliantly polished thing could not be located. It has waited to be discovered. Now that it probably didn't matter, here it is. It was too sad for her to even think about.
The next time death had slinked into his heart, was when he discovered that knowing what to do wasn't always enough. He learned to deal with it, losing patients. But it made him wonder if it was all worth it.
“Oh... I should think like this.” Sherlock reaches up and pulls John down close to his face. “I am going to jump off the Reichenback Falls.”
Sherlock whispers, " I did trust you. I know what you think, but it was only to protect you at first and then I thought it would be kinder to just let you go on. I didn't want to mess up what I thought you had and God, I was half insane with grief that I had lost you."
Sherlock pulled out his spy glass. And went over John in silence. "He has worked out extensively, perhaps to excess considering the scent of menthol-based cream permeating his right leg in the knee area and bruising to his ankle of the same limb. He is vitamin deficient indicated by the dry skin and sallow complexion. He has recently had his hair colored and styled, possibly as a precursor to this event. His watch is expensive and not something he would have bought for himself. Sentiment. He died with his shoes on and neatly tied, meaning he was most perfunctory in wrapping up details. His will is on the mantle, labeled. His shirt was ironed by him, but his trousers were professionally cleaned. The smell of naphtha is strong, so he just picked them up. There are no doubt a second set of clothes laid out for his burial, ah yes hanging just over there. This wasn't done on the spur of the moment, but long planed."
Janine snickered, “Well, if you need any advice on fairy-tale relationships, you have two experts right here? “
He and John had to go through their squabbles and forge the path each time they again fell into the others arms.  But there would come a day that John would meet someone in a short skirt and things between them would begin to get taken for granted and Ford would leave and John would again swear his never-again tirade.  One day, Ford knew it would be true.  John would mean it someday.
Eventually he had not needed her to sneak him in the lab. His reputation with Scotland Yard had gained him access. He had permission to come any time. He spent hours there now and everyone knew who he was as he swept in wearing his greatcoat and tight expensive suits. Molly found this unspoken divide between her class upbringing and his intimidating, but not Sherlock. Her colleagues cringed and headed for high ground when he appeared near the morgue.
"Well, as far as I'm concerned, right this minute. He may as well be, to me. I would have done anything, and I do mean anything to…just love him. Any terms would have been fine. Whatever he wanted. I might have even worn one of those stupid labels people like to throw around…for him. They were already making assumptions. Even the newspaper called me a confirmed bachelor."
John shrugged and spoke before Sherlock finished sputtering. "I assumed that was your signal, right? Because you wouldn't be stupid enough to leave me behind again. You are a genius and all." John stated as he efficiently resumed his climb upwards.
He freezes in a half stance, eyes wide and confidence shattering at this vision before him. He's made an angel cry. John Watson is certain he must be growing fangs and horns, because to have forced tears of sorrow from Sherlock, would take the power of a monster.
Where had he spent last Christmas? When was the last time someone sung happy birthday to him? What will become of him in a few years, when he's aged beyond this life of battle and wits and stoic lonely searches for people who needed to stop existing? What happens to him when he can't run any longer?
"No time. Relax. You act like you're afraid of me. I'm not trying to seduce you for Christ's sake. If I were I certainly wouldn't have to use such a lame-brain excuse to trap you."
Greg stands, noticeably restless and exhausted. He paces about, still trying to come to terms with it himself. "Why'd he give you his gun?" he turned suddenly with the question, surprising her. "You can't shoot it and you can't load it. He must've known that."
"Well, we won't ever know that, because the pills got mixed up at the lab. I am eighty-percent certain that I was right. It wasn't that difficult to see that he—"
Molly complies slowly, not taking her eyes off him. He only slipped into pet names when he didn't want to tell her something. After Sherlock died, he'd spoken this way to her. Her knees bend and the left one pops, making her feel suddenly old. He sometimes shows up for a hot cuppa and a talk, but Greg looks brittle and not like he has any secret party plans for Mrs. Hudson or deliciously funny gossip on his mind.
"And the thus the contrary truth. He's capable. But, he's not willing. It seems thinking Moriarty would be the death of my brother caused me to overlook the actual force that would bring about his demise. All the bullies and bad-guys, drug dealers and psychotic stalkers outsourced by one small doctor." Mycroft's eyebrows rose and he twirled his umbrella dramatically as he turned and without another word, left John's room.
"I meant it then too, but I should have just gone. None of this would have happened if I had done what I intended. I was delayed," he muttered the last part seductively then his lips brush her temple and ear.
Sherlock thought some doctors were idiots.  He didn’t know medicine, but he knew puzzles and chemistry and he would figure out some way.
"It was. I was aware of him. He'd follow me around for days, then he would disappear. It had been going on since before you… left. He had several chances. I kept expecting him to make some move that would explain what he wanted. Even approached him once, spoke to him. Invitation if you will. I didn't actually associate him with Moriarty until after. Thought Mycroft had eliminated the three lone gunmen. They were strictly amateurs. Moran was not in their small-fish pond. His mistake was in following Mary. That was the point I decided. He could have me, at that time. Happy to play. But not my Mary."
He dashed a small fortune into treatment facilities. Sherlock preferred to sleep with fleas and commune with rats than admit he needed help. It was a terrible time for Sherlock and it was probably harder still on Mycroft, who genuinely wanted to see Sherlock take his place among the ravens. He'd wanted to be able to introduce Sherlock as his equal, not shamefully admit that he was here to collect him from another of his disastrous whims. Mycroft had tried so hard.
Looking at the mantle, she could see the ghost of a strange red box, so similar to the one she herself had given Sherlock that night, which he didn't even open after making fun of her. She could see her box tossed aside and an uncomfortable Sherlock Holmes excusing himself from the horrible Christmas Eve party, with a look of fear on his face almost masked by his aloof disdain. She had felt like such a fool that night. But she had not understood at the time that he was going through exactly the same thing she is now.
"You should be afraid, Sherlock, because if you keep me, you are mad as a box of frogs. Think it over; you can let me know…" John said and then he and the flat washed away and Sherlock is aware that he's being jostled.
For the first time in his life, he was filled with purpose. If Sherlock had been a baker of cakes or a jewel thief, John would have helped. It turned out he was an oddly unemployed detective of some sort who forgot to eat, who smoked like a chimney, who rarely slept at all, who had a drug addiction from time to time, who was the most annoying being to ever exist. John was insanely happy in his presence, when he wasn't grossed out, confused or offended. John learned quickly to prepare himself before opening the refrigerator. He may be a doctor, but he had never once taken any flesh trophies of his work home for display in the cooler. Eventually, by the time their time and adventures were near an end, John thought he was prepared.
Of course, every fairytale has some truth. The four families are secretly known as the Ravens. They have served for generations, yet the history books never speak of these advisors. Oh, on occasion they get mentioned in reference to some deed or document. Once in a while, there is a beheading. But there is always a raven watching over the crown. This service has never been limited to England, but nobody needs to know about that.
*I am sorry.  I did not mean it.  Please.  I have been clean for most of the last year.  It was one relapse.  There have been none since-SH*
"It wasn't trust, it was safety. I wanted to come back a year ago, but you were moving on. You were happy? I don't understand. Has something happened to your wife? You were happy. I saw you."
Mycroft had caught his eye, making his way toward him, a look of determined nosiness set on his otherwise bland features and his umbrella speaking volumes of irritation by the way it tapped precisely on the side of his highly polished shoe.  His mother speaking confidences to a stranger at her son’s internment did not pass Mycroft’s notice and only his need to make graceful inquiry kept him from at once confronting said stranger when the servants couldn’t identify him at a glance.   All he needed was for his wife’s story of with whom she spoke and his own, not to mesh precisely. Rat had quickly made his exit, only to then spend a half hour dodging his son’s amateurish junior minions.
"Sounds like a load of drip to me. You were never worried before, but it's none of my concern. I will need to run the taps from time to time. Pipes go bad just sitting. Would you like tea?" she says waving for him to take a seat.
A part of him wished she would ‘show him’ what a good shot she was. The threat was there and he was so broken in that moment he would have stayed silent and gone willingly, only regretting that he wouldn’t get to see the look on her face when she realized her error. He wondered if Sherlock would control his anger and wound her or murder her for taking his life. It was a mystery and he didn’t twitch at her firing at the coin. In his mind, she’d made two nearly fatal wounds with her first shot.
“I meant what I said in the hospital. You are not a joke. I would fall again, fight again, burn again and bleed again for only one person in this world. Unfortunately, I cannot make similar declarations due to a great deal of new information that I have just been made aware of. You will never know what you just said means to me, but it may have been better had I never heard it, so that I could have maintained my self-deception that there would forever be a distinctly unwavering barrier to such whims.” Sherlock sipped his drink.
Mary and John both speak to Sherlock in soothing calm voices as he continues to thrash. “Time?  He’s coming out of it.  That’s right, love.  You are fine. “  She studies him.  “Yep, here we are. Into the bucket, Sherlock. “
“Nor with me having the slightest contact. Your family will always be in danger so long as you are associated with me. I would give you up if that was what you required to maintain your indulgent fallacious fantasy that you alone can make the world safe?” Sherlock said staring pointedly out the window.
"But, if they haven't found him, it could be anybody. It could be anyone at all. Lots of people look like him. They made a mistake, that's all," Molly declares, a false boldness and ease in her voice, yet an imploring mien creeping into her eyes, begging him to stop telling her something so stupid.
"How dare I? That is quite the statement coming from you. How dare you. I have done nothing but watch over you both in every way. I have befriended him, guided him and yes, I have stepped in at this time and I thought it would be less traumatizing if I allowed you both to accept the others death at this time. There will be no contact until I assess that you are both in a more competent frame of mind. You have lost all perspective when it comes to this man. In his current situation, there is no option of the two of you simply returning to your little past lives of charming oblivion and the crime solving hobby team that resides in anonymous bliss in a flat at Baker Street. It cannot happen. You both blew it."
Sherrinford entered the stage without introduction, his violin screaming a high clear note before sweeping down into an Irish jig that made a few smile and giggle.  He burst onto stage as if he were born to be there and the announcer gave him a friendly familiar introduction as Bernard Morgenstern, composer of a piece called Fairytide, and somehow Rat looked as though he had no idea that anything other than his violin and his music existed. The melody was lively and had a folk dance feel, breaking the somber mood Sherlock’s piece had rendered.  The orchestra followed his playful complex feats and many were actually smiling with the pleasure of the bright yet challenging harmonies.  The audience adored him and he played with them as if he could flirt with each individual and coveted their attention.
John laughed and said it did cross his mind in a sick wish to be like him, connected to him, but until the name Sherlock Holmes was again spoken of with awe and respect, his flying days would be limited to helicopter.
Sherlock tucks away a New John in his mind palace but much like the real John, this one is unpredictable.  Mummy has minions too and Sherlock pretends to be a demon.
She rode his twists from anger and landed on shared amusement at his last point. “He is a sweet man of many hidden charms.”
"Some. Many were of you always dying, but even the good ones simply made the nightmare a daymare, when I woke and you were still dead."
"He's making me leave in three days. I should be gone now. Every moment I waste here, I am letting someone else down. I have to go. Without you. You will be killed. How is that not the end?"
“Your husband is contemplating suicide? Make him promise to hold out until Christmas. Trick him, watch him, hell, lock him down if you must, but swear to him that the New Year will be worth celebrating.” Sherlock opened his eyes and looked up at her.
John looks down at his clasp hands. He meets the other man's eyes for a second, then looked out the window as he continueed, "He proved what he thinks of me, twice now, so your problem, no matter what the hell it is, came at a very opportune moment. I don't have anything here. It was all in my mind. I made a wrong turn with Sherlock somewhere and even what I found with Molly…well, it wasn't real, not all the way. I could carry on and fix that if I wanted, but I have issues and she would really be better off…without me. It would take a miracle for me to really trust her again, enough to move forward. Probably a gift to her if I leave it behind. I'm fine with what you're asking of me. There isn't much here for me. I know now that there never was. I don't belong here." On that last point, John was not as truthful as he should have been, but he was already determined to follow through on his word to Rat.
John learned why Sherlock had to jump. Mycroft and he worked together and before the week was up, they had begun a friendly sort of alliance. They quietly rid the world of Sherlock's reasons. The Plumber was an exception, because he had proved himself both a small potato and the key to really solving the whole thing.
"Done.  Jesus...little buggers did a number on your face.  Heard about your accident.  You look pure shit."
Sherlock pushes himself into a sitting position, “No.  I can’t do this.  Not without you.  Please don’t leave me?”
John nodded, and shrugged. "Just like that. Yes. He wouldn't be putting this much into me if I couldn't. Mycroft isn't stupid. He has found something. Won't tell me what. But he wants something specific or he would not be pushing you to convince me."
Mary had found him and called the sun. She had not been completely successful, but she’d at least made the future visible and it was better than wandering blind.
Sherlock seemed to both want to catch the man who he sought and yet almost speak of him with awe. "Genius needs an audience," he said.
He tosses the keys at her. "I know about you and Jim. I've always known. I knew about John too. You lied to me. You knew it would hurt me and took him to your bed anyway. I tried not to hate you for it. I told myself fairytales. Caring about you blinded me. I will always care, but love and hate grow on the same stem, Molly. Love is a game for fools and I knew better, but it is the same as being a junky, isn't it? It stops feeling good and becomes a burden. It makes us crave and scurry around to keep it. When it stops there are no cures because your brain has rewired. It becomes everything. You gave me everything and then snatched it away. John and Molly loved Sherlock. You can love dangerous things. You always do. But, dangerous things are dangerous. You can love an Adder. Snakes are beautiful creatures, but they still are capable of biting the hand that snatches them to safety from a fall. Hard lesson, but a valuable one."
John didn’t understand all Sherlock said, but he felt himself drifting further from now and in some limited way, he followed Sherlock into a horse drawn carriage and tasted a bitter Cavendish pipe tobacco on the tip of his tongue.
John stopped and leaned over, his face a mask of disgust. He stepped off the ladder onto a ledge and waited for Sherlock to come up level with him. "Let me understand this correctly. Look me in the eye and tell me you are setting out to intentionally destroy your mind. Your next career goal is Consulting Zombie?"
He takes his seat next to her, not even removing his mackintosh. It radiates a chill as if the world has turned cold. It dawns on her, he's going to tell her something awful. "Oh, God. Who?"
John's voice deepened and grew deadly serious.  "So tell me, Mycroft, old pal.  Last year...why didn't you make me disappear?"
Ford continues and his voice is nearly a whisper, “I knew how very drunk you were that night and I had noble intentions.  I cannot justify my actions, but I know they were not as cruel as you imagine.  I couldn’t get the picture out of my head that it might have been weeks before I knew that you had been murdered…like that, if I had not happened to have followed a lark and intervened.  Told myself it was fate.  I got you home and cleaned up.  You were very forward, John.  You were so happy to see me.  You cried about Sherlock.  I said no.  You…begged.  I told you we would talk about it in the morning.  You told me.  You told me that after everything, if I said no, then there would never be another chance.  I told you again that we would talk in the morning.  I thought you had passed out and I did go tune Sherlock’s violin.  I meant to play it.  But I was curious and I looked through my son’s room.  I found your bag and your note.  I heard something and went up the stairs to check on you.”
“No.  It seems to have lost its magic.  The women?  Well, that I felt rather foolish about.  Tiger?  That I missed entirely.  Honestly John, I am so thankful I was unaware all these years.  Never fear my unwanted passion will again be aimed in you direction.  Problem solved.”
“Who would notice? Your flat always smells like that, though my honest opinion is that even your attempt at olfactory lavage has failed to compromise toward any improvement. The place is more offensive now, giving the impression of a morgue full of long expired French whores rather than the slightly less repugnant notes of a sodden crypt exhumation. You are quite adept at madly improvised escape when given the right circumstance. I imagine you would be most creative in evasive maneuvers well into middle-age,” Mycroft stated in his wandering phlegmatic style.
“I was eight. Mycroft threatened to tell Mummy about my six pet bats in the attic if I told her where they actually came from and I couldn’t take a chance. Three of them were pregnant. I couldn’t have them suddenly homeless with new-born kits.”
"That would be lovely, but I warn you, the teacher was probably right. I couldn't afford to pay you much," she says with hesitation.
I guess it's a hard pill to swallow, knowing my chances are not the best. For three years I have focused on one thing. I wanted you, but it doesn't cure me. I could pretend for a while and cling to you with greed, but I know that yesterday was the best day of my life and I won't ever see it spoiled by reality.
She gave him her best, really-John look of wife anger until she realized that he was not affected by it at all. She schooled her features into a placid calm and said with as much gentleness as she could,“I understand. But I won’t listen to this right now. For my past, I am sorry. And for Sherlock. I never dreamed the two of you would be there. Of all the places in this city for the two of you to show up.”
“Cocaine. A seven percent solution. Would you like to try it?” Sherlock said with a smirk. Even when off his head he loved to provoke John.
Molly sat in total shock. It all hit her and she flung herself backward on the mattress and wailed like a soul was ripping from her flesh.
There was a new rally in London. Word of mouth had people tentatively speaking well of his old flat-mate.
"No idiot. It was long gone. She tried to keep me satisfied with things to look forward to, but I kept getting lost in the past and I wouldn't have left her, but it was unfortunately a relief. It freed me up. For this, tonight."
“I will take care of your Boss. Keep your head down. Wounded and full of contrition will placate him to the best effect.” He said, raising his chin and reading her carefully. “Friends forever?”
“John. I don’t want to go.  I can’t.  I will put my feet up here and Mycroft will order us Chinese?”
Upstairs thumps and knocks can be heard. Mrs. Hudson glared upward and shook her head in disgust. "Still up there poking around. John was such a private boy. He would have hated this. That man has a screw loose somewhere, and I don't care who he thinks he is," Martha Hudson says in a loud whisper.
He rubs her back, maybe clinging to her a bit, too. Grief is far above all standards of proper behavior conditioning and without bashful barriers or the need for social graces, they comfort each other, stiff upper lip be cursed. "Molly. I was two blocks away. Just off an investigation. Call came across the in-board. I was there within ten minutes. If anybody wanted to find him, it was me. The sea took him. I sort of hope that, in a way. Just gone. You had to do for Sherlock, and I know how bad that was, but floaters…sorry, drowning victims, I don't want you to see that. Not for John. I think maybe he'd like it that way better, too." He sighs and she can feel his breath in her hair.
"Too bad your Three-Continents persona had yet to be … jumped on," Rat said with his traditional pause for the double-entendre punch word.
“And fucked me and left me to die again.  Just like you always do.  I always knew you couldn’t love me, but I did think you and your bloody regard would have at least stopped you from…that.” John blinked and coughed away tears.
Sherlock waited for the preening to subside before continuing. “I therefore feel that we are capable of moving on to the next phase.  You can all handle yourselves quite admirably and frankly your talents are wasted on these small potato criminals. I never meant to bore you all.  I didn’t realize all of you could be the fruitful equivalent to men twenty years
"Actually, I believe I do." Sherlock's head turned toward John and he's annoyed to have to keep going through this with him.
“Procedure? Horrifically beyond my own nightmares. Would have left a dazzling scene, for someone to find. For me to view the photos of. For God’s sake. I am going to be ill.” Sherlock set the box to the side and quickly made his way to the loo. He sat back down a few minutes later. “You may continue.”
He thanked the woman profusely and slowly stumped down the stairs. So what did John do with the clue? He looked around as he stepped down the stairs; it had to be here somewhere. He had to be missing something. What had happened that night?
Some of John’s anger and frustration fled with a deep sigh, and he spoke carefully, “Okay. It’s fine. You’re right, of course. But only about the bad timing. You and Sherlock are none of my business and I should have kept my mouth closed. You are both right about that and I am sorry. Wasn’t my place. The rest of that, I hope you do honestly know, is a load of rubbish. People are idiots. They do and say stupid things that get blown up and end up hurting people. I love him more than life. I bloody well do. Can’t deny it. But I am not, nor have I ever been, his boyfriend.” John shrugged and spread his arms for emphasis. Hand on the door, he added, “ Sherlock, I have my phone. Text me when…I mean if you need anything. I will be back later. Going to pop out for a bit.”
"The truth can be quite fluid, even if the facts are all in order," Sherlock replied quietly. "You really thought I had it on...with your wife?"
Sherlock was set off by her sounds. He holds still, quaking and twitching and his eyes are wide and unfocused as finally a single sigh escaped him and he collapsed on top of her. This has taken less than five minutes and she is exhausted from the power of it.
John grins but is still firm, “ Mary's taking me home. Because she needs to eat and her ankles are swelling. Bit not good.  We are too close to have you take chances at this stage. “
Sherlock and John were the most exasperatingly beautiful kind of love she'd ever seen. All she'd asked was to be near it. Being part of it would be a dream. She knew she was capable of loving each of them with all her heart, but even if they couldn't love her back in the glow of each other, this thought of it destroyed was far worse. John would not have jumped off a sodding bridge. To hell with the fact she'd seen the proof, she wasn't sure, because she knew first hand that proof didn't prove anything.
“Shut up. You can say anything you want when I am done. But you will hear me if I have to tie you down and tape your mouth closed. Just one time. Just this night. We are doing things my way. Because if you care about me at all, you will hear this. “ John chewed his lips as he glared at Sherlock, daring him to speak.
He had turned to look at something. No someone. There had been blood, but no actual body on the roof. If someone were making me do this in some way, what would I say to him. He didn't take his eyes off me. I couldn't look away or move because he asked me to Do this for him. He gave me no time to say anything or get my thoughts in order. Yet he knew each tiny gesture would be too bright to see for a while.
"Really? Care to test my word? Testing my word is why we're here, I believe. I do hope you remember that I don't just have access to this room, Sherlock. There is an entire Palace for me to play in now. Your palace. And you can only stop me by sending me away. This time, you have to try harder. I'm in your head. I will
“  So, there it is.  Fuck me. Don’t fuck me. I don’t care, but I will save him, no matter what and when I’m done with that and the great Consulting Detective blows me off again and Molly hates me and you take off and I have murdered a man who you think maybe couldn’t murder me out of loyalty.  Don’t bother with any souvenirs, though I guess my skull on Sherlock’s mantle might give you both a laugh.  Just let my sister think all of me remained in the coffin and don’t tell her about your ghoulish collection or Sherlock’s fridge etiquette.  Or hey, already dead, just let me rot where I fall and walk away.”
What if today had been his last chance.  What if he had simply smiled and let his face soften and let his eyes shine how he felt?
Why was Mary the best thing that could have happened to him.  This is my possible solution to that, because Mary has probably had to overcome a lot of stuff of her own and to do that she has to seek the good.
"Dinner. I know a place." That was all. No further prompting was needed for John to follow. He just did. Solar objects caught in a pull, that had no concept of orbit.
Molly winces at the image. She leans into him and he holds her, kissing the top of her head and soothing her and maybe himself a little as well. So far as a police officer remaining detached in this case, Greg has failed on every count. But, he is human and this is John he's having to discuss. John and Molly have been his to watch over since before Sherlock died. He had loved Sherlock and therefore those who Sherlock loved were his by osmosis. Sunday at Mrs. Hudson's had become about all he had now as far as family. This wasn't duty. John was his family.
"Mad bugger…"The cabbie slammed the boot and without another word, got in the car and locked the door, a look of fear on his face. He clumsily put the car in gear, not taking his eyes off Sherlock and the engine sputtered slightly in protest of the rough treatment.
John nodded. “Ahhh. So that’s why?  All of this?  Your worry about him…constantly?  The inappropriate cameras…the kidnapping his friends?  It’s not about him?  It is because you are afraid you will miss something … again?  Have you missed something?  Like Moriarty’s body?”
"I just took one an hour ago. After the …oh look, I appear to need another. Missed some spots," Sherlock declared on second thought.
There were other solos and quartets and finally, the hall filled with applause as the conductor finally made his appearance, explaining that he wanted people to truly appreciate the depth of talent on the stage behind him.  When he finally turned and lifted his arms, the hall filled with power and the graceful sounds were overwhelming.
'Play it now, or later." John says in his calm, softly commanding, dangerous way. "Out loud please."
Janine’s visit was unexpected, considering that she had told all manner of outrageous stories about her ‘engagement’ to Sherlock Holmes. Mycroft had not made her disappear, surprisingly, but it still stunned John when he answered the door and she beelined straight to the sofa and curled up on Sherlock’s lap without so much as a word of hello. Sherlock sighed heavily and murmured to her as she succumbed to a particularly dramatic bout of sobbing.
"My enemy was finally dead and I came home to find out you were getting married in two months. I debated, but the facts seemed so clear. You were finding a future. Mycroft told me I needed to decide who I thought was the most important. He pointed out that, you were perhaps a bit lost without me but I was a blip really. You were essentially heterosexual and what chance did I have to honorably provide you with anything other than pain. I justly believed Jim had won after all. He burned the heart right out of me. He took you away from me. I left the ceremony and I was childish as always. I made messes for Mycroft to clean up. I was the mess actually. There is some missing time. Then I threw myself into some of my brother's covert enterprises and I arrived in London about sixty two hours ago. Mycroft said things may be not in the best place with you, that maybe I should keep an eye on you for a bit. I am working here right now. I think you would find it a most stimulating case. Mycroft needs us. He admitted we were much better as a team. He is quite fond of you. Your blog concerned him and it was decided that I would wait and see what your travel plans were to be. If they were some sort of ruse, I would take appropriate action. I knew you were staying here, but he didn't tell me why."
Sherrinford stood and exited the room without so much as a backwards glance.  He paused in the doorway, “Should this endeavor prove fatal for either of us, I do mean for you to know that every moment with you was important to me.  My deepest apologies that I failed to understand the sentiment had no reciprocation.”
Ford was a man of many exceptional encounters with sentiment,  but John was his favorite.  No sexual partner had ever equaled this small, not quite beautiful, but unquestionably attractive, man of seemingly average assets.   Maybe it was simply that John denied him what he wanted most.
John blushed. "Well, yes honestly. I have always rather prided myself on my ability to control myself. I usually take a much longer time to build up into the required state of arousal to achieve release. It has never occurred with, so little direct firm stimulation."
John finally looked over at Sherrinford.  He swallowed, “I was thinking…I was thinking that no matter what I ever did…one day you would never come back you damned idiot.  You were two months overdue. I was sure you were never coming back…and I’d never know.  You’d done this to me for so long and I didn’t act one bit different out there.  I was happy and it was just … a stray lucky shot.  They were scared kids, old women and sick people … it all just went wrong.  We went to help and it just… we set up and within ten minutes we were under fire. I tried to get to cover, but she couldn’t run.  I got hit carrying her…she had lost most of her foot and I couldn’t just…when I fell, her grandmother screamed.  The girl …I saw her crawl away from me. I hoped it was my blood she was covered in but I won’t ever know  and the next thing I knew, I was on a respirator. ”
"I have heard that, sir. If you could just unlock the door, perhaps you could tell me more astounding observances without the hindrance of all this glass and wood?" Sherlock said politely, though his friendliness was now crashed and he was about to strangle an old prat if he didn't get out of his way.
The second year was nearing. That year and a half plus twelve days mark, the day of crossover had been much worse. He'd nearly shot himself in a single clear moment of despair. Six more months had dribbled by. He had tried to ignore that in the last six months, time had moved quickly. He'd written as obsessively as Sherlock ever worked a case and thanks to Mycroft's contacts, he'd zoomed past a normal persons publishing obstacles. The first book was a phenomenon in Europe. The other three were set to release and he was contracted for 12 more, one of which was waiting on his laptop for his final editing process. He would be on tour soon. He was off to conquer America by the end of next year if all went well.
" John. You have to find some way. You have to let it be. He gave you no option and made his choice. It could be that he was too afraid to tell you. Imagine what he must have believed. He was unable to process that he had changed what you believed about yourself. He believed you were never going to realize what he couldn't even tell you that he wanted most. He wanted you and yet, you were not a possibility. He was so without any bounds of reason in this area. You are probably the only thing he'd ever had this reaction to. Think about that. He'd never been in love. He was possibly still a virgin, I mean he never has been with anyone to my knowledge. Imagine being his age as the real thing crashes into you as your first experience. It must have been terrible for him. You were something he's losing control over. The accusations. His life falling apart. He didn't have the ability to deal with it all and realize it could blow over in time. He didn't have the patience. He probably reasoned that this was better than letting you be stained with his own disgrace. "
When Sherlock began to play, for John, time stopped.  He could see what Sherlock had said as clearly as if he had watched the scene.  When the piece was over he had to remind himself to breath.  Tears made his vision swim as Sherlock bowed to massive applause.
"No. Sherlock. He knew if he could get you to take that pill, that he walked away free and clear with all that money and he got to claim that he was the best. He even beat you. Jim probably had a bonus the size of a small country in the promised reward if he got you."
"He disdained the ritual. He was rarely capable of putting himself out there in that way. I still carry the umbrella he bought me, rain or shine. It means more when the gesture is so rare." Mycroft was soon called away, with business. John visited Sherlock's grave, the collar of his new coat turned up. He left a few tears from thinking about sweet memories instead of sorrow alone, his only gift for Sherlock.
Sherlock's heart flutters as he observes. The needle is in his arm. John lies on the bed with a small smile and calm face. Sherlock is losing control, his eyes are blurring, "No. No." he whispers hoarsely.
His eyes pop open and his head rolls toward her, his eyes change from grey to a sudden green and she is mesmerized by the way he sees her so intently, almost with a hint of insanity. Most eyes never lock to hers. Most eyes pass over her without noticing her. His eyes see her and she sucks in her breath as he begins to tell her things he had no way of knowing.
Mycroft entered his Spartan office, his steps heavy with exhaustion and care-worn dark bags prominently tucked below his eyes. He took exactly twelve seconds to realize his security had been breached at some point during his absence. The comprehension brought a sigh of relief rather than irritation. It meant his brother had thus far not succumbed to his long practiced method of dealing with unpleasant circumstance.
John cleared his throat, but his voice was steady. "I don't think asking him to understand the fact that he treated me like a bumbling useless tosser, to be left behind, lied to and not trusted even when you both knew the battle I fought each day, was so very evil. It really wasn't any form of humiliation, compared to the disgrace of mourning someone while they have a piss at my expense because they only died to get away from me. Must have been quite the lark to have me think you enjoyed my company because we had this common loss. That's my toast to your accusation, Mycroft. Humiliation? I'm sure you could give me several years lessons on that subject. Feels like I should have caught on earlier, but I never could quite master all those subtle Holmes mind games. Posh boys cut their teeth on them and you and Sherlock chew them up for fun. A mutt like me goes to the pound, not the hunt. No reason to bark or growl here, just tell me he's ok."
