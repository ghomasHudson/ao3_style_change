The third week, a bourbon and water. He downs it quicker than he intends and gets the same again. As he brings the fresh drink to his mouth, his eyes fix on the figure approaching him.
“Then one night some yarn and needles showed up in a donation box on base in Afghanistan, and I started at it again. The guys gave me shit at first, but eventually got used to seeing me knit, and I even taught a couple of them to make scarves. It is very relaxing. You did get that deduction right.”
At least, Sherlock is pretty sure he’s knitting. There seem to be more needles than necessary in John’s hands, and there are points at both ends of all the needles, and it all looks very askew, but trailing from it is a tube of dark blue knitted fabric with a clearly defined cable pattern travelling along its length.
“You’re eager for this? Really?” John leans over with a swift motion, his hand fisting in Sherlock’s hair as he shoves his mouth against his ear. His voice is low, just above a growl, and he thrusts his fingers into Sherlock with each word. “Don’t. You. Fucking. Come. Do you hear me?”
And at that, at that one short but powerfully meaningful word, something inside John that has been shifted out of place all this time rights itself, and settles.
The only thing that looks rather ridiculously out of place is the large open metal cage at the far right end. The cage has three walls, each about a foot in from the walls of the room itself, and a ceiling about a foot lower than the room’s ceiling. There is an assortment of carabiner clips, loops of leather and rope, and adjustable bars attached at seemingly random points around the cage, and there are various gears and a small wheel at the edge of the cage wall nearest the armoire.
“It’s nothing,” Sherlock shook his head, offering a clearly fake smile to John before glancing down suggestively. “Feel free to resume your previous activity…”
“Mum, it’s fine… did you remind Kev? He always forgets to bring the crackers. No, I told you, I’m coming up on the 6 o’clock train. I’ll pick up the pudding on my way home from the train station. Yes, they’ll still be open, I called. Dammit…” She nearly trips on something as she’s digging out her keys, and looks down to find a small box wrapped in Christmas paper on her welcome mat.
to see Sherlock bleed, just a little bit. He thinks about what that means, and also what it doesn’t have to mean.
There is honestly so much assaulting their vision that it takes both of them longer than it otherwise would have to notice that Mrs. Hudson is currently snoozing on their sofa.
“Well,” Sherlock says, pointing at nothing in particular, “I’ll have you know it is a very inaccurate ashess… ashmess…” His face screws up in concentration.
of us to death. Sherlock had no idea where you were. When he couldn’t reach you by midnight, he tried Stamford to see if you were out together, which you weren’t, given that Stamford is on holiday in Ibiza. At 3AM he actually called Mycroft. That’s how panicked he was. We’ve been looking for you ever since. For fuck’s sake, John, we thought you’d been taken again.”
“He does, but he’ll be gagged, eventually. Probably sooner rather than later, unless he's changed his ways. At that point I’ll put a small piece of silk in his hand, which he’ll be able to drop if he needs to.”
He was sprawled on his stomach in between Sherlock’s legs, completely absorbed in the blowjob he was currently performing. He wondered if Sherlock would be proud of the observational skills he was using just then, cataloging Sherlock’s reactions to the subtle variations in pace and pressure and suction and things he might be doing with his tongue.
John rests his head on Sherlock’s stomach while they recover. A few minutes pass in silence, and he wonders if Sherlock has fallen asleep, until he feels Sherlock’s hand thread gently, almost tentatively, through his hair. Fingertips rub slowly at the base of his neck, and something in his chest that had been out of place all night realigns itself, and he closes his eyes.
John gives a short, sharp, humorless laugh. “You realize it, do you? Well done. Very observant. You’re a goddamned genius, all right.”
At that, Sherlock moves up to cover John’s mouth with his own. The kiss is passionate and eager, not punishing in the manner that John’s was earlier, but hot and needy and arousing. John’s hands roam down Sherlock’s back, smoothing over its length, reaching down over his arse, pressing their hips together.
Sherlock exhales in something that sounds almost like relief. He pulls up onto his knees and leans forward, seeking a kiss, but for the second time tonight John puts a hand to his chest and stops him.
Sherlock’s grip is light as he shifts toward John. He breathes deeply, and lets his eyes fall closed, and, somewhat unexpectedly, settles his forehead against John’s mouth.
“My grandmother taught me when I was a kid,” John said. “I used to go to her house after school, and she was always knitting. I always liked doing things with my hands, building models, digging in the garden. A surgeon in waiting, I guess. So I asked her to teach me, and picked it up easily. I made a couple of scarves, some hats, a vest for my dad. But she died when I was in secondary school, and I got more into football, and I just fell out of the habit.”
Sherlock moves into him eagerly, backing him up, and John is fine with it all, right until his head bumps against something in the freezer that he fears may just be one of the legitimate body parts still in there, and finds this spoils the mood somewhat. He pushes back against his beloved detective.
“Good.” Sherlock pulls him into another kiss, this one tender, almost chaste, full of relief, and it lasts and lasts.
“By banging on the door of the clinic secretary at five o’clock in the morning, making her come down and open the clinic, rifling through personnel records and staffing schedules, and calling every person you worked with last night. Whoever didn’t answer, we banged on
, it terrifies him like nothing in the war ever did. And when each crisis is over and Sherlock is safe again, the terror dissolves into relief. For an instant. Then it swirls up, inexorably, into anger.
“Just to talk, Sherlock. And maybe drink. Because this,” John gestures broadly at the air between them, “it’s going to take some time. We are nothing if not completely fucked up right now. But I’d like to try to find our way back. If you want to.”
Instead, he decides to see just how badly Sherlock wants to deny himself, and starts pumping with his mouth eagerly, pulling Sherlock to the back of his throat before swiftly moving up his length, increasing the suction, then back down again. He doesn’t move his hand in tandem, but he loosens his grip, relinquishing the pressure and any help he may have been inadvertently providing in staving off Sherlock’s orgasm.
Because every time the blue light went on, John prepared just as seriously upstairs as Sherlock did downstairs. In addition to mapping out the progress of the entire scene in his head, he also knew exactly what he would do if Sherlock uttered his safeword or dropped the silk at any point along the way. He planned for it, every time. Because if it happened, he would not,
“I guess all I can do is promise that it will never happen again, and that I will do everything I can to make it up to you. I don’t know how, but I will.”
“Merry Christmas, Sherlock.” John leans in and Sherlock knows he isn’t capable of kissing a lie into John’s mouth, so he confesses his day’s activities without words, and looks uncomfortable when they separate.
Instead, as John trudges up the stairs, he finds both doors to the flat flung wide open, spilling all the light from every lamp they own into the hallway. He stops at the kitchen door and tries to make sense of what he sees.
“It’s all right, love,” John whispers. He can feel Sherlock’s eyes watering against his skin. “You're all right...”
When John is ready, he looks at Sherlock for a long moment, then walks over to stand directly in front of him.
. It isn’t something I need to do to survive the day, or be happy, or even to stay off drugs, really. And I won’t sacrifice… this. You. I will never ask you do to anything that makes you
He starts to work on the right arm. This time, as it lowers, he extracts the piece of red silk from between Sherlock's hand and the cuff, and slips it into his pocket.
At one point Irene pulls the wand away, adjusts a dial at the base, then quickly touches it to his stomach. Sherlock gasps sharply and jumps again, his shoulders caving over as he moans, long and low.
John shuts off the vibrator. “What was that? I couldn’t hear you over this,” and turns it back on again, letting almost five full seconds pass before he turns it off. Sherlock’s cock is now rock hard and straight up against his stomach, and his torso is bowed almost completely off the bed.
She waits for almost an entire minute, then connects the crop sharply with his left nipple. She pauses again, then hits the right. A pause, then the left one twice more.
Sometimes Sherlock will ask before John even leaves for work if they can have the lights off that night.
John sighs, and smiles. He often found a certain sexiness to science when he was in school, but Sherlock took it to a whole new level. “Fine, but you’re dealing with the sheets afterward.”
Moving to stand facing his side, she turns the dial up and presses it hard to the small of his back. He shouts behind the gag and arches forward, and she meets him with another jolt to his stomach, and he jerks back. Then his legs give out completely for a second as he shudders, and moans, and hangs, for a long moment, until he finds the floor again, rather unsteadily. Once again, he has started to leak.
And so Sherlock comes quietly but powerfully, his torso lifting off the carpet, his breath catching for a long moment, then exhaling with a shudder. His hands scrabble at his sides and John slides his arms forward to catch them in his own, grounding Sherlock through the aftermath, waiting until he feels every muscle beneath him relax before he lets go.
“Okay.” He hasn’t asked for that before, but John doesn’t mind the idea; in fact, something in it appeals to him, too. Lord knows there were enough times he had to resist a physical reaction to frustration with Sherlock’s behavior; he could get behind a bit of roughhousing.
If only Molly could have secured the heart by Thursday instead of Friday, this might have been avoided, but no. And it was John who had established this pattern, who had decided that he would offer daily gifts of penance in an attempt to demonstrate the depth of his guilt and remorse. He had no one but himself to blame for that, and for the reason it all had to happen in the first place.
He maps it out, considers each step, what he will ask for, what he will offer. He puts things in order, runs through it, rearranges. He thinks about the pace, about the limits and the rules and the consequences, about what will happen when, and what will happen if.
John sinks to the floor in front of Sherlock and kneels up, running his lips along Sherlock’s erection before sliding his mouth over the head and taking him as far back into his throat as he can. He holds him there, then pulls off entirely, spits into his own hand, and starts to work himself as he swallows Sherlock again, sucking at him in earnest and in a matching rhythm to his own.
About a half hour later John trots down the same stairs, straight into the kitchen, and opens the fridge, pulling out some salad makings. He piles them on the kitchen table, then turns back and fills a large pot with water, setting it on the stove and clicking the gas burner to life.
John looks up, genuinely startled. He didn’t think it would start this soon. He hardens his tone, watching Sherlock pace.
“I know you are. And you still need to go.” John releases his grip on Sherlock’s shoulders and drops his hands to his lap, folding them together, waiting.
He shifts up onto an elbow. “Will you come if I touch you right now? I’m going to clean you up a bit, but I can wait if you need to.”
While Sherlock is removing his shoes and jeans, Irene moves past the table to the metal wheel at the side of the cage. She moves a bar underneath it which appears to unlock it, then slowly rotates the wheel. The ceiling of the cage lowers. When it’s at the height she wants, she moves the bar back into the locked position.
He waits until his newly confirmed sixth sense kicks in and he knows Sherlock is standing behind him.
Sherlock lets him work at his neck and shoulders for a few more minutes, then turns around and presents his wrists. John unbuckles each cuff and pulls them off, tossing them to the bench. When his hands are finally free, Sherlock slides them alongside John’s head and pulls him into a proper kiss, his mouth working quite well again. There is heat there, and love, and gratitude.
Sherlock stays silent, and John feels like he doesn’t want to breathe, doesn’t want to move into the next moment and find everything changed. He genuinely doesn’t know if he has crossed a line he can’t uncross, breached a trust he couldn’t get back. They had worked so hard to get where they were, to the point where he enjoyed their time down here just as much as Sherlock did, and he wasn’t sure how he would deal with having fucked it all up.
When John steps through, he sees that Sherlock’s assessment was more or less accurate; the room looks like the waiting room of a doctor’s office. There are several chairs and sofas scattered around, end tables with magazines, and unobtrusive modern art decorating the walls.
Sherlock wonders if John can feel his heart which he is convinced in this moment is beating out of his chest and directly into John’s.
“Of course it’s not locked, you git. If you’re willing to accept the consequences, you can come in and see what I’m doing.”
“Of course.” John gets up and moves to the door. He slides a hand along Sherlock’s cheek, encouraging him to lower his head for a kiss, affectionate and comfortable. He allows himself one brush of his hand through the hair covering Sherlock’s forehead, pushing it back, a gesture he knows Sherlock doesn’t really like but John loves to do it and Sherlock indulges him. He pulls his hand away and the curls fall back in place.
Sherlock’s voice is low, almost breaking. John looks up from his computer and sees him standing in the doorway, his eyes drifting around the room, settling everywhere but on John.
Sherlock inhales quickly, his words coming out in a rush. He doesn’t look up. “John, I swear, I thought that’s what you wanted. I thought that’s what you were doing here.”
He lifts his head back up to watch John continue to move down and up at his new, horribly slow pace, once, twice, a third time.
John bounds up the stairs without looking behind him. He shoves open the door to the flat, tears off his coat, throws it at his chair, and immediately goes to the fridge. He pulls the door open so hard that everything
Before securing the second wrist, though, he grabs the mobile from the table and whips it over his shoulder. It smashes against the wall and clatters to the floor, in several pieces, judging by the sound.
him down, thrusting hard into the back of his throat, and holding him there, just for a split second.
“No, wait, this is your side,” Sherlock says as he falls sideways into the pillow. He makes a half-hearted attempt to pull his legs onto the mattress but it doesn’t quite work and he seems resigned to sleeping in this position.
John watches Irene start to work on Sherlock with a cat o’ nine tails and tries to ignore the fact that he is, actually, getting hard. He’s not made of stone, and looking at Sherlock naked and aroused is going to arouse him, no matter what the circumstance.
Sherlock’s hands fly suddenly to John’s head, pulling him in to a chaste, then affectionate, then passionate kiss. John leans into Sherlock’s embrace, lifting his hands, still holding the bow and violin, to press against Sherlock’s back. After a long moment, Sherlock ends the kiss and presses their foreheads together. They breathe in silence for a second.
Sherlock calmly closes the freezer door. “Would you be up for an experiment?” he asks, reaching for the bag in John’s hand and extracting the pint, and flipping it with a twist of his wrist so it lands in his hand a moment later, label side up. “Rum raisin, my favorite.” He looks up at John expectantly.
“Forward. I’d like that.” He holds Sherlock’s gaze as Sherlock pushes himself off the wall and moves to stand in front of him.
Sherlock sighed, then took a deep breath. “You once said you find it difficult, this sort of thing,” he said slowly.
,” Sherlock breathed as he popped up off the sofa and went to inspect it. He flipped the lid open and peered in. “Oh, it’s perfect.”
Sherlock’s breath hitches as John rubs gently at his wrist for a second, feeling the pulse pounding under his fingertips. He slides his hand slowly up to the back of Sherlock’s neck, slick with sweat, and presses his mouth to Sherlock’s equally damp forehead, tasting the salt he finds there.
What he couldn’t tell, not immediately, were a number of other things. Like where he was, or what time it actually was, or how, exactly, he had ended up on the floor of this unknown flat at this unknown hour.
Once, she asked him, a bit hesitantly, if Sherlock could come by, and he slowly diverted his gaze from the wall to look at her. She recoiled at his expression, and never asked again.
“Now that we’re warmed up,” Irene says, “let’s see if you can stick to the two rules you haven’t broken.”
“Do… not… come,” John whispers, mouthing at his ear once more. “Do you hear me? No matter what I do to you tonight, don’t you dare come.” He shifts back up to a sitting position and looks down at his prey. “Are you done fighting me?”
“Very,” Sherlock answers, his voice low and strong, hitting the note that always sparks something deep in John’s belly. He pulls back to look John in the eye. “Are you?” he asks, his tone serious.
Every moment of silence was a dagger in John’s chest, but he knew he deserved it. How could he be so stupid, so insensitive, given the lives they led? There were criminals, actual dangerous criminals, who not only knew who they were and knew where they lived, but now, because of the delightfully thorough tabloid press, also knew what they were to each other.
“I know, for ordinary people, one of them can accidentally stay out all night and no one panics. The other one’s… what, annoyed, or kind of worried, or even a bit angry, but not…” He drifted. Sherlock couldn’t find the words to describe how he felt when he couldn’t find John.
“I thought I would add a few decorations here and there,” she says, but her voice is uncertain as she looks around the room like she’s never seen it before.
Now they are both panting. John rolls off to one side and roughly yanks Sherlock’s body down the bed so his arms are as outstretched as they can be. He watches Sherlock struggle against the straps, but he doesn’t have enough slack to really get any momentum.
me.” Sherlock tries to jerk his arms free, but John’s lower center of gravity works in his favor, and he has plenty of strength to hold them down.
Then, intentionally but slowly, wary of offering any more sensation, John brushes his lips against Sherlock’s. A gentle, chaste apology.
Sherlock throws his head back, his grunts devolving into whines as his fist moves with urgent intensity around his cock. John tightens his grip around Sherlock’s middle and runs his tongue along the shell of his ear, sucking it into his mouth, biting at the flesh until at last he feels Sherlock go still for a brief second and then shudder underneath him. Sherlock comes with a breathless shout, spilling into his own hand, his muscles spasming around John, still buried deep inside.
Finally John peels himself from Sherlock’s back, withdraws as gently as he can, and collapses onto his side. Sherlock slowly lets his knees slide out from under him, but stays up on his elbows for a minute as he recovers, his head bowed, his breathing labored. He leans off the bed and cleans his hand on whatever piece of clothing he finds, then sinks down into the pillow, his eyes toward John, open but unfocused.
Sherlock seems to think better of his request and takes John’s advice. He settles his head back and closes his eyes.
“One minute,” he says, and in a swift movement, takes the head of Sherlock’s cock into his mouth, lifting it up, and sucks down its length.
He felt bile rise in the back of his throat, and it wasn’t just the hangover. Somehow the fact that Sherlock, in his completely justified anger, still came up and did something kind for him only made it all worse.
“No, we’re not going to a dungeon. We’re going to a very respectable-looking house in Maida Vale, owned by a company with several respectable-looking houses scattered around the city. There will be rooms in the basement level, and we will be making use of one of them, but the upstairs lobby looks more or less like any other boring office waiting room.”
When Sherlock’s erection has waned just a bit, John gets a warm damp flannel and carefully, clinically, removes the evidence of his earlier activity. He reaches down to drop the cloth on the floor, and his hand returns holding a bottle of lube.
John continues murmuring gentle reassurances and leaves his body pressed alongside, a steadying anchor as Sherlock comes down and settles into his head again. As always, he waits for Sherlock’s breathing to regulate, then counts at least a minute beyond that, before he brings them back to the present moment.
Sherlock rocks back on his heels and stands in one fluid motion, keeping his eyes down as Irene walks around him once more. She smacks his arse with the crop in a way that is surprisingly but irrefutably affectionate.
John almost called his office and told them he wouldn’t be in, but he couldn’t bring himself to admit to his generally younger colleagues that he didn’t recover just as quickly as they did. He managed to sleep through the rest of the night and get some toast and tea to stay down in the morning. Sherlock was either still in bed or gone, John didn’t know which and didn’t feel up to finding out. Instead he made his way to the clinic and laughed off the disaster of Saturday night, popping paracetamol whenever the urge struck him.
“Okay,” Irene says, returning a hand to his knee and rubbing it gently. John is surprised by how non-sexual a gesture it is, considering the context. “Now. How much did Sherlock tell you about what will happen here?”
Sherlock watches intently as John leans forward and slides a hand down Sherlock’s right arm, encircling his wrist almost delicately, then slowly pulls it forward. Sherlock follows him, straightening up on his knees. Bringing Sherlock’s palm to his mouth, John licks it, loose and messy, once, then twice, as Sherlock sucks in an audible breath through his teeth.
John roughly pushes Sherlock down to the mattress, out of his way, as he leans over him to reach the bedside table. He’s had a lot of practice slamming drawers open and shut tonight, and in no time he retrieves the bottle of lube and slicks up his hand. He pulls Sherlock back up to his knees and slides one finger inside without a lot of finesse, then slides in a second. He thrusts his fingers just a couple of times, quick and shallow, then adds more slick to his cock and buries himself, much too fast and all the way, in one powerful thrust.
“Oh, God, Sherlock, I’m going to come soon. I’m going to come all over you, but don’t you dare look down. Watch my face. Look only at my face. Oh, God... fuck....
He was over Sherlock, moving in him, pounding a rhythm tight and controlled to keep himself just this side of losing his mind. John’s eyes were fixed on Sherlock’s face, still trying to read the signs, to learn what he wanted, what he needed, how to move to make
John sucks in a breath as his luck holds, and the tip of Sherlock's tongue tastes the dead center of John's sternum.
Then, John takes one step forward, closing the distance and forcing Sherlock’s head back, limiting his range of motion. His cock was now half buried in Sherlock’s mouth, and at this angle, with John so close, Sherlock could not move his head back far enough to pull off of it, even if he wanted to.
“Are you sure?” John stands, glancing quickly from her to Sherlock and back again. “I don’t… is there anything in particular I need to know?”
At this, Sherlock raises his head to glance at her. Almost instantly, with a flick of her wrist, Irene connects the tongue of the riding crop with the middle of Sherlock’s back. He grunts and immediately lowers his head again. She begins to move in a close, slow circle around him.
There’s a haunting melody, a melancholic progression of notes, filling the space in his head, drawing him in. They’re coming from a violin. He’s moving through a house that’s his but isn’t his, searching out the source, certain he’s found it with every corner he turns, but it seems to drift out ahead of him, always the same distance away, always just in the next room.
John is not surprised by the woman’s beauty, but he is surprised by the warmth she is exuding. She is smiling at them, her glance bouncing from one to the other, one hand resting on the edge of the door, the other holding a riding crop loosely at her side.
Mrs. Hudson smiles as though chiding herself and reaches out to squeeze John’s arm. “I don’t mean dead, dear, nothing like that. But he left London, maybe two weeks ago.”
Irene lets it vibrate against the plug for another five or six seconds, then switches it off. When she stands in front of him again, Sherlock’s eyes are pleading, and they find hers in breathless, unthinking desperation.
As John pulled off and replaced his mouth with his fist, mostly so he could rest his jaw a moment, he stared up the length of Sherlock’s body, and even though he had done this more than a few times so far, he couldn’t imagine ever getting tired of the sight of Sherlock Holmes underneath him, blissed out and shameless.
“And I said get out. Actually, what I meant to say was fuck off.” Sherlock spits the words at him, but doesn’t stop moving.
John is still catching his breath, looking back at Sherlock with an unreadable expression. Sherlock blinks slowly a couple of times, then tentatively lifts a hand to the back of John’s neck. John doesn’t react.
“He did, and it made sense, in some ways, I guess, but I still… I don’t know. I thought if I could see… what happens, just as an observer, then maybe I’d be able to compartmentalize, and learn how to… help him… myself.” John sighs.
“Not really,” John says, rubbing his hair again. “The melody came into my dream. I knew it was you playing, and kept trying to find you, but every time I went into a new room, it seemed like you had just moved out of it.”
Sherlock stills his movement for a second, having sensed the tension suddenly appearing in John’s muscles, but then continues, up, then down, then back up again. On the next slide down, he curls his hand under the hem of John’s shirt, and draws his nails along the bare skin, up and down once more over his spine.
“Good,” Sherlock says, a grin ghosting over his mouth. He lowers his head back to John’s chest, laying kisses slowly down to his belly, and without looking up, reaches a hand to the table next to the bed, blindly finding the bottle of lube.
“I thought this shade of blue would do amazing things to your eyes.” John’s own eyes crinkle. “I was right.”
John laughs kindly, thinking of how rarely he’s ever able to render Sherlock speechless. “The extra shifts I’ve been taking at work? Some of them were lessons.” He suddenly feels almost shy with embarrassment. “I was going to surprise you on Christmas morning, wrap up my crap music store student violin and let you open it. I’ve even been learning ‘We Wish You A Merry Christmas,’ too.” He laughs again when he sees Sherlock’s expression hasn’t changed. “Honestly, I never know what to get you, so…”
After a few minutes, Sherlock has gone almost quiet, apparently lost to the sensations that must be coursing through his body. His balance is fairly steady, his breathing is deep, there's just a short, mindless moan on each exhale.
“John, think about your life right now. Think about what brings you comfort, pleasure, a sense of joy or safety or satisfaction. All the things you love and seek out. Your favorite pint, that ridiculous green squishy ravioli dish you always order at Angelo’s, the jumpers your grandmother knit for you, all the way up to the practice of medicine.” Sherlock pauses. “Think about everything like that. Is there anything on that list that you wouldn’t give up for me? Is there anything you do, anything you have, that you wouldn’t delete from your life if I told you, for whatever reason, that I needed you to?”
John drinks the entirety of his beer standing at the kitchen counter. He drops the bottle into the recycling from a higher than necessary height, just to hear the pleasingly loud clang as it lands among the other glass in the bin.
, and the sight of it makes him angry too, because fuck Sherlock and his fucking masochistic self-denial. He wants so badly to pull that cock back into his mouth, pump him hard and fast, rip the orgasm he knows he would cause right the fuck out of the man, watch him come apart and thrash against his restraints, hear him scream as John sucks him into the back of his mouth and swallows around him, swallows every last drop, and keeps working his throat around the head until the hypersensitivity becomes cruelly, unbearably painful, and let
At this, Sherlock lifts his head to press a quiet kiss to John’s chest and starts to untangle himself from John’s body while John moves to sit up against the headboard.
But it was a long day, and by the time he pushes through the front door at 221B, he’s looking forward to a quick shower and then crawling into bed and curling up behind Sherlock’s back and sleeping for as long as he’ll let him.
But sometimes, Sherlock goes downstairs before John gets home, flips the switch to turn the light on, and curls into the sofa, staring at the bulb. When he sees it turn off, he gets up and paces and starts making fists and shaking them out.
He’s still awake when Sherlock comes in, and he closes his eyes in shameless avoidance. He listens as Sherlock gets undressed, washes up, turns out the light, and climbs quietly into bed, also curling on his side, also facing away from John.
“I’m sorry. I know this… with me…” - Sherlock waved his hand to indicate the flat, and what their life was now - “I know it isn’t easy. I know I ask a lot of you.”
“They’re not all body parts,” Sherlock huffs under his breath, his eyes still on the bacteria moving in rather fascinating patterns on his slide.
Sherlock finally looked up and stared back at John’s expression of confusion. “You just said you wanted to make it up to me. Bring me a heart.”
Sherlock’s knees actually, literally buckle, just for a split second, but it’s long enough for John to see.
Poor Mrs. H. snore-snorts as she startles awake, sitting up and patting her hair and apron into place on what seems like automatic pilot while she gets her bearings. Finally she looks up at them and blinks as a look of relief washes over her face.
Sherlock sinks into his chair and stares at John’s motionless figure while he waits for the kettle to boil. The fact that he’s seen John several times in between these erratic visits, and John knows that Sherlock knows he’s been there, and John hasn’t tried to cover it up with a
“I understand.” John has to stop himself from imagining what kinds of scenarios would actually cause him to leave. He really, really doesn’t want it to come to that.
A few days later, Sherlock presented John with the option of leaving. A submissive is supposed to be given aftercare, and while John isn’t sure that they’re really at that level with all this, he does believe that forcing Sherlock to sleep alone after the lights are on is distressing to him.
For once, he runs out of words, and they stand there, in silence, for a solid minute. It’s freezing, but neither notices.
John holds the man’s gaze as he takes a pull of his drink. He sucks his teeth as he swallows, looks the man up and down, then locks his eyes and says, “Not dance, actually, no.” He sets his glass down without breaking eye contact.
John starts unfastening Sherlock’s cuffs from the socket. “Yeah, I stayed,” he replies, catching his eye and smiling a little.
John just grinned and picked up his book. “I’m coming to bed tonight in a Christmas tree jumper and nothing else.”
“It’s still playable,” Sherlock said under his breath, reaching for the last two games in the bag. “Dominoes. And Operation? We have that one too.”
What he could also tell was that it was daylight outside, which was very bad, and he was still a little bit drunk, which was very, very bad.
John looked up from where he was comfortably sprawled on the sofa, a book in his hand. “I’ve deduced,” he began, sitting up, “that the Holmes brothers’ activity today was not in the least bit serious, or nefarious, or in any way covered by Official Secrets. In fact, all evidence suggests that you were doing something I personally would find
Sherlock makes a noise in the back of his throat. He is not just looking at John’s eyes now, but staring, and John is pretty sure that it’s because Sherlock can see the barest glimpse of what’s going on in his peripheral vision, and that’s what he’s concentrating on, even though his eyes are directed at John’s. In John’s own periphery, he can see Sherlock’s fists, strapped at the corners of the bed, clenching and releasing, over and over again.
Christ, it had been a long day. As much as he hated to admit it, Lestrade was not a young man anymore, and he simply could not run after bad guys like he used to. He had made a good showing, he thought, before barking at a couple of constables to pick up the pace and get after the suspect. He had ducked into an alley, shouting “I’ll try to head him off,” but actually stood bent over, hands on his knees, for two entire minutes, trying to catch his breath.
“God, yes, Sherlock…” The words tumble out without conscious thought. He can feel Sherlock grin against his hip as a fist closes around the base of his cock and pumps once, twice. Then Sherlock’s mouth closes around the head and follows his hand down the shaft.
In the next three seconds, John does several rather unexpected things. First he lunges up, easily breaking free of Sherlock’s grip, which had relaxed during the detective’s moment of distraction. John rolls them over, reversing their positions, and quickly captures one of Sherlock’s wrists.
Sherlock is rolling his neck from side to side, wincing as he finds a tight spot. “I’m glad. Did you have a wank?”
me?” Sherlock grabbed the album from John’s hands and stomped over the table toward the bedroom. “I’m not speaking to you until New Year.”
“Well, your cock says differently. But I’m afraid your cock is going to have a very long night.” John shifts his knees out from under him and extends his body down the length of Sherlock’s, so he’s lying flat on top of him. He dips his tongue to Sherlock’s ear and sucks the lobe into his mouth, gnaws at it gently, then lets go. He grins as he feels Sherlock’s body shudder underneath him.
“Now. Get my cock out, using only your pretty little mouth. You can put your hands on my legs for balance, but otherwise, just your mouth.”
As he bounds up the stairs, John is fairly certain that none of that is actually what Sherlock said, but he has developed a defense mechanism that turns Sherlock’s voice into white noise as soon as he hears the words “I can’t
John falls forward, supporting his body on one arm, and spills himself all over Sherlock’s cock and stomach. With a half-grunt half-whine, Sherlock involuntarily thrusts his hips upward, meeting the warmth now spreading over his midsection. He is staring at John’s face so hard his eyes are practically bugging out of his head.
“It’s not what it looks like…” Sherlock slurs, blinking like he can’t remember where he is just at the moment.
“Right. Yes. So. I was in the army, and I guess to put it very simply, maybe because I’ve seen pain… a
John wants to do most of the shopping online, which is how he had acquired the few things they had already, but Sherlock rolls his eyes and hails a cab.
John gags, his eyes watering instantly. He pulls off and coughs a couple of times, then works to catch his breath. He glances up at Sherlock almost in disbelief as the back of his hand wipes at his eyes and mouth, and his eyes catch fire when he sees Sherlock’s remorseless, provocative gaze staring back.
“Nothing wrong with ice cream for dinner every once in a while, and I promise the presentation will be quite original. Also I’ve often wondered about the melting point of viscous liquids exposed to direct body heat…”
The feeling of being watched intensifies. He can feel it surrounding him, a pressure on his skin, a suffocation.
Sherlock is panting as if he had just come himself. His eyes are glued to John’s even as John collapses at his side, trying to catch his breath.
“This? This is yours now. It has been for a long time. Asking that you be allowed to keep track of it, to know where it is, is never asking too much. I know all the blood and concert tickets and childhood photos and board games will never make up for what I put you through. I swear, Sherlock, I swear on this heart, I will never do that to you again.”
John doesn’t want to admit how glad he is she said that, but uncertainty lingers. “How do you know?” he asks, his voice barely above a whisper.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock,” he whispered, his voice failing him, dropping the crop as though it burned. He loosened Sherlock’s cuffs, and sank onto the bed, his head bowed. “The rest of it is fine, the tying you up, but I just… I don’t think I can...
By forcing Sherlock to maintain eye contact with him, he has to maintain eye contact with Sherlock. This wasn’t terribly difficult, and John certainly knows he won’t have a problem reaching orgasm while focusing only on Sherlock’s eyes, but it means he can’t allow himself to even briefly close his own, or throw his head back, or any of the things that were more or less habit by now when it came to a wank.
“Oh, don’t worry about it, Mrs. Hudson,” John smiles up at her. Sherlock cuts his eyes at him. “You can leave it.”
“You’re welcome,” John said simply. He waited a beat, to see if Sherlock would break and offer him a smile or a kiss or a shag over the desk, but none of those things happened, so he went to fill the kettle.
“Good,” she says, as she continues drawing the crop over his chest and stomach. She lands another blow to the outside of his hip, and this time the grunt is accompanied by a twitch from his cock.
John blinked, distracted for a second by how dry his eyes were, while his brain, in the background, processed what Sherlock had said.
“Sherlock, are you ready?” called a voice from downstairs, followed by footsteps ascending those stairs with peculiar alacrity.
“Yeah, it’s... not ideal. I keep meaning to call Mrs. Hudson, see if the flat’s still available. I paid her for three months, but...”
He always knows when John is close. Sherlock brings his left hand up and grips the top of the headboard, providing better leverage against John’s thrusts. His spits into his right, graceless and desperate, and starts to work at his cock, trying to keep some kind of rhythm while John pounds into him.
John’s breath catches in his throat as the point Sherlock’s making comes into sharp relief. He wonders how he will ever get used to the idea that he is capable of loving someone this much, and that the very same someone loves him that much in return.
“None of your business,” the Holmeses replied in unison as they buttoned coats and pulled on gloves.
Sherlock turns his palms up and raises his hands in a gesture of mock surrender. “Just… try drawing the bow across some strings and we’ll see what happens.”
“That’s it, love, God, you beautiful thing,” John breathed hotly into his ear. He was vaguely aware of Sherlock’s face collapsing into a wince, and his head turning away, in what John assumed were still the throes of orgasm, and he was only vaguely aware because moments later he slammed his own release into Sherlock’s body, groaning and gasping against his neck.
“Not tonight though.” They’re halfway to the bedroom and Sherlock drifts into the wall and leans there, resting his head, and John stops with him for a second. “You were definitely not in my bed tonight. I looked everywhere.”
But he can’t. Sherlock asked him for this. And John will not do a single thing to jeopardize Sherlock’s trust. It took him so long to earn it, so long to even get Sherlock to acknowledge that something existed between them, starting with just
He was going to suggest going to the movies as a way of escaping the heat, but that requires putting on clothes and moving around outside. Sherlock’s idea seems like the only reasonable alternative, really. He walks back into the bedroom and around to his side of the bed, drops the towel to the floor, and lays down on his back, stretching out his arms and legs in a mirror of Sherlock’s position, and tries to sleep.
Sherlock, clearly taken by surprise, has to shuffle forward a bit to keep from falling over. He slowly returns to his default position, back on his heels, his demeanor betraying his confusion and some disappointment, which makes John feel a bit smug, if he’s being honest with himself. Denying Sherlock feels quite good at the moment.
“But you didn’t just pass out on what must have been a very uncomfortable hardwood floor,” Lestrade said quietly, turning a corner more slowly than he usually did, not so much caring about what the turn might do to John but what John might do to his upholstery.
John is so riveted by the image before him that he barely notices when Irene rejoins him on the couch. She sits back, crossing one long leg over the other, and regards Sherlock thoughtfully.
“John.” Sherlock’s reply is more or less automatic. He couldn’t be bothered to look up from the microscope, at this particular moment, unless one of four circumstances exists: he is asked a question, he is given new information, John is naked, or John is in imminent danger. The statement of his name doesn’t qualify under the former two, and his peripheral vision confirms that the latter two aren’t the case either.
He takes a deep breath and lowers the instrument, turning to smile at Sherlock, whose eyes have gone a bit wet.
All this goes as it has gone on hundreds of previous evenings, only this time, when he reaches the cart, there is an unfamiliar object gracing it.
He shrugs into his robe and shuffles out into the kitchen. Sherlock is facing the window, as usual, and John doesn’t want to startle him, so he leans in the doorway, watching him in the glow of the fairy lights Mrs. Hudson hangs on the mantel every December, which they both secretly enjoy. He listens to the sad, sweet melody, until it comes to an end, and Sherlock lets the instrument drop from his shoulder.
John smiles at this, a genuine smile, the first one in four months, and if he’s honest with himself, probably longer than that.
Sherlock swallows and looks down at the richly textured pattern, then back at John, still dumbfounded.
“I know. Like I said, counterintuitive. But it means I know how to give him what he’s looking for here, and I know how to approach the line without crossing it, which might reassure you a bit. If you find you need to leave, please do so quietly, and I’ll come and get you when we’re done. However, I think I should mention the other possibility.”
John drains his glass and leans behind him to set it down, but pulls an ice cube into his own mouth first. He trails the back of his hand along Sherlock’s thigh and presses his mouth to a knee, drawing the ice in a circle, as his hand finds Sherlock’s half-hard cock. As he drifts his fingers lightly along the shaft, he hears, “Wait… I think… just…” and feels Sherlock tugging him down the bed as he’s shifting back up.
As an afterthought, John also pulls the eye mask from the drawer. “Maybe we should keep your attention from wandering," he says. He slips the mask over Sherlock’s head, centering it over his eyes.
, Sherlock. You could have called me, or come by the flat, at which point you open your mouth and say ‘How are you.’ You don’t
John has tried to maintain a poker face, he really has, but at this he absolutely bursts out laughing. “Well done. Finish your water, and let’s go to bed.”
He steps out again twenty minutes later, savoring the fact that for what he knows will be a very brief amount of time, he is
, and so Sherlock, heeding Mycroft’s repeated lessons about boundaries (which consist of Mycroft saying “Boundaries, Sherlock,” in that sing-song tone of his), leaves it alone.
Sherlock wakes just after 7am to a text from Lestrade: a body with no head has been found in the back of an abandoned lorry in Islington. Brilliant. He has a quick wash, returns to his room to throw on the same shirt and trousers he wore yesterday because no one will notice, and he’s back down the hall and almost at the door when he is stopped in his tracks.
He blinks and scrubs a hand through his hair to dissipate the last fuzzy sensations of the dream. Sherlock is, in fact, playing the violin in the sitting room, but he’s using his practice mute, a metal device that fits over the bridge and dampens the volume. He always uses it when he plays in the middle of the night, like he is now.
And Sherlock complies. He strokes lube over his own erection and then quickly climbs back up, stopping to kiss John hungrily for a few long moments before positioning himself against John’s stretched entrance and slowly, steadily, pushing his entire length inside.
But then, quite suddenly, time seems to slow down, almost freeze to a stop, like an old film in a broken projector, when, out of the corner of his eye, he sees a piece of red silk fabric float gently toward the floor.
“I’m starting with your wrists, Sherlock, okay?” For now, John must ignore the lines of saliva falling from Sherlock’s gaping mouth, the cacophony of gasping, wracking coughs as Sherlock tries to catch his breath. He
“You went three for three, Sherlock Holmes,” Irene says as she walks back over to him, picking up her crop and sweeping two small items into her palm as she passes the bench. “Now, you are going to pay for it.”
The non-sequitur surprises Sherlock, who momentarily stops his efforts to escape. “What are you talking about?” he asks, trying to catch his breath.
Sherlock moves with the momentum, stumbling back a few steps but regaining his balance in a slow, even adjustment. He doesn’t try to move forward, or raise his hands in self-defense, not even when John steps toward him again, and shoves again, except this time Sherlock is stopped by the wall of the alley, and John advances one more time, and reaches for Sherlock’s jaw, and pulls down.
Sherlock’s breathing stutters and he sucks his lips into his teeth, but he doesn’t say anything, and his eyes do not waver.
He can’t take his eyes off of Sherlock, but turns his head in Irene’s direction. “Look, you should know… if he calls you again, you should see him. I told him he could come back, if he wants to.”
Sherlock breaks the kiss and holds himself up, looking down at John for a long moment as they pause to catch their breath.
“John.” He takes Daniel’s hand with his own and roughly pulls him forward. His left hand shoots to the back of Daniel’s neck, and there’s no hesitation as their mouths slot together. Daniel smells of sweat and tastes of rum and John closes his eyes, pouring all his frustration and fear into the hot mouth of this person he met thirty seconds ago. Daniel grunts and takes a small step to close the gap between their bodies, settling his hands at John’s waist.
First, there was one solid week of regular, ordinary, everyday, heartwrenching grief. He sat in his house, his proper house, where he lived with his now-dead wife, and stared at the wall, and wept. Mrs. Hudson appeared and disappeared like a miracle to set food and tea in front of him.
“Very funny,” Sherlock rolled his eyes as he held the envelope up to the light and peered at it intently, then ripped off one of the short edges and shook the contents into his palm. They were concert tickets. “Itzhak Perlman?”
John isn’t there when Sherlock gets back from Islington later that afternoon, and isn’t there the next morning, and hasn’t texted to say
Mrs. Hudson pulls the door open, smiles warmly and sympathetically. She quickly invites him inside and asks him if he needs anything.
“It’s possible,” Mrs. Hudson shrugs, though she does not sound convinced. “Who knows with those boys. But John…” She pauses, and it’s so very clear to him that she has something to say, but doesn’t know how.
She switches the vibrator on and rubs it lightly against his stomach, causing the muscles there to twitch, and again his hips thrust in reflex even as he tries to back away from the wand, at which point she directs a sharp snap of the crop over his nipple.
“Wait!” Sherlock jumps up from the table and first hastily, then delicately, removes the lump from John’s grip. “This one’s important. If it retains its shape after three defrostings and refreezings, I’ll finally have the proof I need to correct that frankly ridiculous article in the British Journal of Science about the cryogenic potential of…”
Sherlock retrieves John’s t-shirt from the floor, and tosses it at him. “If we fight, or if you overreact by getting irrationally and unjustifiably mad at me when I conduct a perfectly reasonable pursuit of a suspect, we don’t come down here for at least twenty-four hours. Starting
“Sherlock,” John sighed. “You can’t just… Look, this is new for us. We’ve only been at it, what, a week?”
“The nice things,” Sherlock said. “About me.” He rolled his eyes, and John saw his frustration. Sherlock so rarely struggled with words. “You know…” He sighed and waved a hand instead.
(Also, Sherlock is dressed in black jeans and a skin-tight black t-shirt, which doesn’t happen very often, or ever, really, and John is finding it extraordinarily distracting.)
And then, in a rush, the fire comes back, overwhelming. John’s hand grips the back of Sherlock’s neck and angles his head, working his jaw wide open. He leans them backwards, reaching for the floor to break their fall, and groans into Sherlock’s mouth as he presses him into the carpet, shifting up to straddle his hips.
When he finally reached the landing, he found the door already open. Sherlock was sitting on the couch, one long leg crossed over the other, still wrapped in his coat, his hands pushed into the pockets, staring straight across the room.
John sighed. “Sunday nights, for the next two months, is what this is.” He set the bag down at Sherlock’s feet and perched in his own chair.
“That’s right. We’ll be here about an hour. You should know that Sherlock has expressly agreed to anything that is about to happen. It might help to keep that in mind. He will be in pain, certainly…” - Irene’s voice reflects an unmistakable note of anticipation as she turns to look down at Sherlock’s kneeling form - “...but he won’t be injured, not in any way that couldn’t be resolved with paracetamol and some rest.”
“I really do like you like this,” John says, his tone casual. He’s standing at the foot of the bed, pulling his own shirt off over his head and undoing his jeans. “You’re so helpless. It’s cute.”
Sherlock’s eyes haven’t left John’s hands, but then a realization dawns, and he looks up. “The jumpers you wear? You made all those?”
Eventually they truly exhaust themselves, and then someone boils a kettle and then there’s tea and all three of them are settled into the sofa, and John asks Mrs. Hudson where the Elvis Santa actually came from, and Sherlock asks about the felted snowman, and she tells them about her trip to Amsterdam and her sister’s father-in-law’s craft experiments and her grandmother’s collection of ceramics, and her stories are so engaging (and the flat so well-lit) that none of them notice that it’s grown dark outside until John’s stomach growls noisily.
John tries to settle his jaw against the black chinrest. “I don’t think this is ever going to feel right.” He pulls the violin away for a second and looks down at it, then tucks it back against his neck. “They couldn’t have made the chinrest out of something soft? It’s not terribly comfortable.”
So when he arrives home that night, wired and frustrated, he takes a deep breath as he bounds up the stairs and hopes Sherlock is amenable.
Finally John relents, easing back the pressure and softening the kiss. Sherlock’s head lifts off the pillow when John pulls up, trying to maintain contact as long as he can. John lowers his mouth again, as if to offer another kiss, but pulls away just as Sherlock’s lips rise to meet his. He teases a second time, after which Sherlock lets his head fall to the pillow with a knot in his brow and a quietly voiced grunt.
John held his breath as he turned the album page. The next photo was the same Santa, his lap now holding a screaming bald 18-month-old also wearing a Santa outfit, and a slightly taller boy than the one in the previous photo, still shooting visual daggers at the lens from under a striped stocking cap and a Santa Claus sweatshirt.
John continues like he didn’t hear him. “...you should go back. Whenever you need to. I would understand.”
John shook his head for a moment, and decided to press his luck. “If I bring you a heart, can I come back to bed?”
John moves down, tasting the salted skin of Sherlock’s pale neck, mouthing over a collarbone, dipping his tongue into the depressions of his throat. He’s beginning to kiss a path down Sherlock’s sternum when he feels a hand under his arm. Sherlock is just resting it there, but the meaning is clear.
He leaves his hand on Sherlock’s chest as he reaches up to remove the earplugs, then the blindfold. Sherlock slowly squints and blinks open his eyes, adjusting them to even the low light, then bows his head. John unbuckles the gag, slips the straps forward, and pulls until the ball pops free of Sherlock’s mouth.
The frustration of the day pours out through the kinetic energy of his body, the snap of his hips chasing the warm wetness of Sherlock’s stretched mouth. He matches Sherlock’s stoccato groans with every thrust, feeling the vibrations of Sherlock’s voice box against his cock. At one point he slams forward and holds himself there, just for a second, just long enough to feel Sherlock gag, before pulling back and resuming his rhythm.
She returns to the bench and picks up another wand, this one with a cord attached to it. John watches her crouch down next to the armoire to plug it in, then shake the cord out as she stands, trailing it behind her. She moves a switch at the base of the wand, and John can now see a thin clear tube, about six inches long, bending at the tip, which is shaped in a small oval.
Sherlock smiles and cuts him off with a kiss, strong and hungry, and this one also lasts a very long time, although it’s never long enough. They separate, still breathing each other in.
She sighs and stands up straight, takes a deep breath of bone-chillingly cold air, then calmly picks up her phone and says “I’ll call you back” into it before hanging up and collecting everything off the ground. Once inside, she carefully opens the package.
Sherlock heaves an audible sigh and stomps down the stairs. He flounces into his chair, drawing his knees to his chest and wrapping his arms around them, sulking with every fiber of his being.
“No more than I’m willing to give...” John jumped in quickly. Sherlock winced, and John shook his head at his error, his eagerness to show contrition. He needed to be quiet, now, and allow Sherlock to make his way through this.
“Sure. Okay. Yeah.” John rubs his palms along the tops of his thighs, trying to figure out where to start. He can’t help but look up at Sherlock, who has stilled his hands. He looks quickly back at his lap, reminding himself that he asked for this, that this is happening because of him, he can do this, he can.
With that, John does grip the hair at the back of Sherlock’s head, and twists it around to kiss him, hard, messy, graceless, both of them working at it and groaning into it, neither of them caring about the awkward position.
“You usually don’t wake up when I use the mute.” Sherlock leans over and brushes John’s mouth with a soft kiss of apology. “I’m sorry,” he whispers, kissing him again before dropping back into his own chair, resting the violin and bow across his lap, and stretching his legs forward.
John exhales and dares a glance, the minimal light in the room showing him only a mop of curls moving slowly up and down. John’s head thrashes back as his hips thrust up before he realizes he's done it. He feels the head of his cock bump against the back of Sherlock’s throat, and Sherlock gags for a second, but quickly recovers.
When John regained some situational awareness, he raised his head to look down at Sherlock’s face, still a bit flushed, brows knotted together. John reached up and smoothed a hand over Sherlock’s forehead, through the curls, and pressed his mouth to the salty skin at his temple, whispering, “You’re amazing, Sherlock, you’re...” and Sherlock immediately turned to capture John’s mouth with his own, almost roughly at first, then slowing as they continued to come down, breathing each other in.
“Sherlock, I mean it,” John says as Sherlock starts toward the bedroom. “You can’t just hand them off to Mrs. Hudson. Not this time.”
except the second appeared before the first was polished off, and then the first startlingly blue drink appeared.
He takes a deep breath and lowers the instrument, turning to smile at Sherlock, whose eyes have gone a bit wet.
The stiffening of his upper body combined with the motion of his hips prevents him from maintaining any kind of steady contact with the floor, so he twists and spins from the socket holding his wrists, struggling desperately to prevent his weight from hanging only by his hands.
A few moments later, John starts by gently removing the blindfold, then the gag. While Sherlock blinks back into awareness and works his jaw, John unhooks the the ankle cuffs next, then the wrists. He stays in front of Sherlock, dropping a few gentle kisses along his collarbone as Sherlock gently lowers his arms, rotating them to move some blood back into his shoulders.
She drags the tails of the flogger up one leg and brushes them back and forth over his leaking erection. “What are we going to do about this, Sherlock? I confess I’m not all that inclined to help you abide by the rules. Where’s the fun in that for me?"
“Because I want to come back to bed.” John didn’t mean to just blurt this out, but there it was, and he let it hang there as he sat down at the desk.
John watches Sherlock, tense and wired, and waits for his breathing to even out. He is unsure how much longer he’s supposed to do this, how much farther he’s supposed to push him.
Sherlock smiles. “She loves an audience. I’d never agreed to that before. She’s looking forward to meeting you. But John…” The smile disappears, and Sherlock shifts in his seat to look at John directly. “You can’t interrupt her. You know that, right? If something… upsets you, you’ll just need to leave, and wait for me upstairs.”
“Everything on the table could play a part in your session if and when I decide to use it. I don’t think there’s anything here that’s new to you, but please take a look. You may speak if you have a question about how something might be used.”
John had no experience at this when they first started. Sherlock brought it up about a month ago, suggesting, in a roundabout way, that it was something he was interested in. John had no problem with exploring it, but didn’t like attempting anything new without being somewhat prepared.
He presses another kiss to the mop of curls under his chin. “And Sherlock, listen. I’m serious about this part. If it turns out I can’t handle it, and there are times when you feel like you need it…”
John watches him move for a second, and when Sherlock’s pacing turns again to approach the door, he hurls his body at him, slamming him uncomfortably against the bookshelf and catching his wrists behind his back. “You
“Here’s what’s going to happen,” John says, thrilling at the sight of Sherlock’s mouth, reddened from his assault. “You’re going to watch me.”
… hot,” Sherlock mumbles again, as though actually forming his mouth around the words required too much effort.
And even then, even in the context of this conversation, John could see how instantaneously uncomfortable Sherlock became, and now that he was looking for it, it was bloody obvious. Sherlock wanted to crawl out of his skin at the words, fidgeting his limbs, grimacing. “John…”
He trailed off, knowing how awful it sounded, and how little he was offering by way of an actual apology. Sherlock still hadn’t moved his eyes off the television.
Sherlock, who can’t actually stop breathing this time because he’s breathless already, steps back to look at him, and furrows his brow.
They’ve been at this particular activity almost twenty minutes. John works at Sherlock with his mouth, sometimes a hard, steady rhythm, sometimes just the tip of his tongue, for varying lengths of time, sometimes seconds, sometimes a full minute. Then he pulls back and watches as Sherlock, in a tormenting loop of denial and frustration, fights his way back down from the brink.
The woman at the door is dressed all in black, from the strapless leather bustier, to the relatively demure silk lace-trimmed boy shorts, to the garters holding up thigh-high silk stockings, to the over-the-knee leather stiletto boots. A black floor-length lingerie robe floats down from her shoulders, covering her arms to the wrists in sheer fabric. She has large dark blue eyes, accentuated by full lashes and a simple thin application of black eyeliner. Her lips and nails are a matching shade of blood red, and her dark hair is pulled back into a slick straight ponytail.
“Hey. Are you okay there for a minute, while I clean us up?” John asks quietly between kisses, reaching up to brush the curls from Sherlock’s damp forehead. Sherlock nods, making an exhausted but affirmative noise behind his gag.
are here to get your mouth on my cock as quickly as you can. Get on with it. And you can keep your hands behind your back from now on.” John releases his grip with a shove.
He moves around the room, sets a few things in place. Their day had been very long and very trying. He wasn’t exactly in the mood for this, but Sherlock had asked, and he acquiesced.
John can’t help but laugh. “Yes. That’s a good idea. Twenty-four hours, then.” He pulls the door open and waits at the threshold for Sherlock. “Not to sound like a really old man, but why don’t we go up and just get some sleep, then see what we can do to start that clock running in the morning?”
Five minutes later, the shot glass is empty again. He’s surrounded by pounding beats of the music, flashing lights and bodies all moving independently but together, like multiple arms of one organism, and without warning, he feels something, as real as a punch in the solar plexus.
“Me too, and me too, and me too,” John replies, lifting his head and pressing a kiss into Sherlock’s stomach. He shifts up to his elbows, and looks over at him. “Bed? Might be a bit more comfortable.”
Sherlock stopped mid-stride and glanced sideways at John, the corners of his mouth perking up despite his best efforts.
“Christ, that feels good,” John whispers, as the ice moves up and down his forearm, then presses into the crook of his elbow.
Sherlock levers up to push at John’s chest but John grabs his wrists once again. He comes up on his knees and pushes Sherlock back to the mattress with his own upper body, his hands on either side of Sherlock’s head. Sherlock stills for a moment.
“Because… you’re… I don’t know... gay?” John can’t tell if Sherlock is taking the piss, or if this is just one of the million things he doesn’t understand about what he now refers to in his head as All This.
“You, you absolute git.” Sherlock goes back to his magazine until John walks around the table and pulls it from his hands, staring down at him. “You went around and gave everyone presents. A nick-proof ID wallet for Lestrade, lipstick for Molly, an Action Man for Mycroft, and a son, apparently, for Mrs. Hudson. They were all you.”
“About three blocks from your clinic,” Lestrade answered. John felt something hitting his knee, and cracked one eye open as little as he could, until he could see that Lestrade was smacking him with a bottle of water, and reached for it.
John tucks his arms in again and settles his head into the pillow, squeezing his eyes shut. “It is when you act like a total fucking prat. Go away.”
“You will,” John whispered back. Another kiss, a longer one this time, until he felt something shift.
He stops as he enters the bedroom, and a slow grin spreads across his face. All the bedcovers and pillows have been pushed to the floor, leaving only the fitted sheet intact. Sherlock is lying on his stomach on his side of the bed, his arms outstretched at slight angles from his body, motionless and completely naked.
John worries for a minute about where to begin. Sherlock is clearly no longer in a heightened state, but he still hasn’t settled completely, and John doesn’t want to startle him if he can help it. He stands about three feet away, wondering if Sherlock is back from wherever he goes, if he can sense John’s presence somehow.
“Honestly, Sherlock,” John says as he pulls himself to his feet, “if you ever tell anyone that you can make me fall asleep by playing a lullaby, I will throw that violin out the window.” Sherlock smiles, a soft chuckle. “You know, maybe I should try playing you to sleep instead.”
“Christ, Sherlock…” John hitches up again and slides himself forward, pulling his legs out from under Sherlock until he has enough room to turn over. He sits down heavily with his back against the headboard and sighs. “We had a fight. We’re going to fight from time to time. It’s normal. And when we fight, we might need to spend some time in separate rooms.”
“Go faster, Sherlock. I want to see how soon you can come for me.” Sherlock huffs out a breath as he continues to jerk at his cock, increasing his pace, twisting his wrist in an effort to add stimulation. He groans intently as he works up to the fastest rhythm he can manage, his other hand reaching toward the arm of John’s chair for balance.
, John. You see,” he says, clearing his throat and getting down to business, “there are brown liquids in clear bottles and clear liquids in brown bottles, but there are
The third week, he started to reason. He tried to understand, and slowly, very very slowly, release his grip on the anger. There was a lot of deep breathing, a lot of shuddering inhales and controlled exhales, the occasional diverting breakdown as he let the truth seep in, bit by bit, careful that it was no more truth than he could absorb at any one time.
He collapses into his chair now without bothering to remove his coat. His lungs still hurt from gasping in the freezing air. He rubs at his eyes with the heels of his hands and tries not to think about the pair of bicycles he still has to put together tonight after the kids finally get to bed.
“Got it. Take these,” John says, dropping the pills into Sherlock’s hand, “and drink this,” setting the glass down in front of him. Sherlock throws the pills into his mouth, then picks up the glass with both hands and downs it in one go.
Sherlock looks up at him, his eyes still on fire, but still unreadable. He sighs deeply. “Yes,” he says, the word a bite.
There’s no build up, no teasing, no soft kisses over his belly or a light tongue across his hipbone. Not
He’s angry. He’s so angry, at Sherlock, yes, but more at himself, and he’s trying not to think about that and maybe all he wants to do in this moment is erase the last two weeks. Or the last four months. Or the last two years.
John stays behind a few minutes after he is technically off the clock, catching up on paperwork, not terribly eager to leave the blissfully air-conditioned office for the oven that 221B has proven to be. When he can find no real or even fabricated reason to stay any longer, he slings his bag over his shoulder and steps out to the sidewalk.
He doesn’t last another full minute before the words are tumbling out mindlessly. “Sherlock… yes… just like that… God, yes, I’m...” At the exact right moment, Sherlock slams him into the back of his throat and John explodes, feeling Sherlock swallow repeatedly through his orgasm, then sliding along the shaft with less and less pressure, mouthing at him until John swears once more and roughly shoves him back.
He shrugs into his robe and shuffles out into the kitchen. Sherlock is facing the window, as usual, and John doesn’t want to startle him, so he leans in the doorway, watching him in the glow of the fairy lights Mrs. Hudson hangs on the mantel every December, which they both secretly enjoy. He listens to the sad, sweet melody, until it comes to an end, and Sherlock lets the instrument drop from his shoulder.
know that, that he was doing it just to annoy John, and that he was satisfied that it had worked. Sherlock dropped smugly into his chair and looked at John expectantly.
John slams his mouth into Sherlock’s, determined to keep that attention undivided, as long as he possibly can.
“I know,” John replies with a quiet smile. This was not the easiest thing in the world for Sherlock to acknowledge, much less learn how to say, and John preens a little inside every time it happens out loud. “And I love you.”
Mycroft stops and stares at it, calculating various balances of probability that the box is there to do him harm. He scans around the flat. Nothing else has been disturbed, and no one without the alarm code would ever be able to get in. Which severely limits the number of people who could have put it there.
Their kiss is a mess for a second, neither one of them willing to yield. They finally slot their mouths together in a silent mutual concession, and Sherlock tries to take control, working his jaw as hard as he can, shoving his tongue in John’s mouth. John, however, has the advantage of position, and uses it to maneuver Sherlock’s head to whatever angle he wants. Sherlock’s hands come up to John’s arms and settle into the crooks of his elbows, trying to yank them free, but John only tightens his grip on Sherlock’s skull, and increases the pressure on his mouth.
“Ornery prick,” John mutters, forcefully pulling the ankle back into place, then securing and tightening the cuff.
When he finally, finally finds some balance, a tiny bit of precarious steadiness against lingering involuntary muscle twitches, he exhales in a long, shuddering sigh, and lets his head loll forward to his chest, surrendering to a complete, absolute exhaustion.
“Yeah, I doubt you’ll have that pleasure tonight, not with this attitude.” The next time Sherlock shoves back, John takes advantage of the momentum and practically flings him onto the bed, following closely behind. Sherlock lands awkwardly on his hip and tries to keep moving to the other side, but John comes down on top of him, straddling his upper thighs.
” John shudders as he hears the bottle snap open. A moment later he feels one lubed knuckle press against his opening. Sherlock rotates the knuckle around the muscle a few times, then slides one strong finger inside.
,” Sherlock grunts, startled from his brief respite. His eyes open wide but he manages to keep them trained on the ceiling as Irene slowly circles his nipple. He moans against the sensation, and his eyes fall closed again.
Sherlock looks at John for a long moment, opens his mouth and breathes in like he is going to say something. But he just burrows his head into John’s shoulder, and exhales.
They lean together for a deep, gentle, passionate kiss, reassurances passing between them in the most honest way they know. Eventually they separate and pull themselves up off the floor, each trying to hide a small groan at the effort, and go in search of their clothes.
John drops his head before opening his eyes, staring down. The feeling is gone, and he can’t look up. He wants to stay in the dark. His eyes well up and he squeezes them shut again.
Irene tuts, then turns to walk to the sink. “Honestly, Sherlock. What was that, five minutes?” He rolls his eyes behind her back before wincing again as he rotates his hips, adjusting to the pressure from the plug.
Irene seems satisfied. “All right then. Turn around, take off the rest of your clothes, right where you’re standing, and wait.”
John slams his mouth down into Sherlock’s, forcing Sherlock’s jaw open and shoving his tongue as far inside as he can. His hands reach up and grip Sherlock’s head, holding it in place as he uses his lips and teeth and tongue to all but devour Sherlock from the inside out.
He found Sherlock peering into the microscope at the kitchen table, the first he had seen him all day. He wordlessly held the vial out to him.
“Sherlock…” John reached for Sherlock’s hand and brought it up to place it flat against his chest. He ran his own hand over Sherlock’s arm, then settled it against his wrist, holding Sherlock’s hand in place.
But then, on John’s next downward motion, Sherlock suddenly moves a hand to the back of John’s head and
, Sherlock. I’ve had just about enough. Do you want the gag?” John asks. He steps free of his jeans and crawls up the bed, straddling Sherlock once again. He drifts the back of his hand over Sherlock’s chest, dragging his nails, circling a nipple. “I believe I asked you a question,” he says quietly, as he suddenly pinches the hardened bud, and twists. Forcefully.
Sherlock groans quietly as he stops to spit into his hand, then resumes at his previous speed. Even in the dim light, John can see that his cock has gone dark red, almost purple, and is swollen beyond its usual fullness. Sherlock’s breathing is loud and stuttered, and beads of sweat have started to pop on his forehead.
, has not abated one degree since the night after they met. It scared him badly enough then, back when John had known him for only 36 hours, back when John had
“All right,” John finally says. “The lights are off. Go to your room, get everything ready, and wait for me.”
“Why do you want it, anyway?” John called from the kitchen, pulling open the fridge and rummaging for a beer he knew had to be in there somewhere. God, it had been a long week.
Sherlock can barely get the words out in between gasps, but none of them are the one word that will actually stop John, so John ignores him, does not even slow down. He hears a long, low moan emanate from Sherlock’s throat, and every leg muscle under John’s hands feels like stone, tensed, tight, immobile.
“You’re okay like that?” Sherlock nods slightly. “Okay. Okay. Now the other one.” John releases the other wrist, again making sure nothing has been injured before bringing it to the floor as well. He runs his hands again along Sherlock’s arms, feeling for sufficient tension and strength, and is not quite satisfied that he finds it. “Go down on your elbows for me, love,” and Sherlock complies, stretching his hands out flat against the floor and dropping his head. The coughing has subsided, but he was still working on long, deliberate breaths.
“One more thing before we get started,” John says. He retrieves the small piece of red silk from the pocket of his discarded jeans and presses it into Sherlock’s cuffed right hand. He leans over to whisper in Sherlock’s ear. “I’m not going to gag you, but your mouth is about to be very well engaged.”
“Listen to me.” He pulls back and ducks his head to catch Sherlock’s line of vision, which is still looking past him, unfocused. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have done that. Just relax for a minute. You’re okay. It’s… it’s okay.” He soothes him until Sherlock’s eyes finally fall closed and his breathing is deep and even.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and looked back down at the photo, then stilled. He touched one face in particular with a fingertip and made a quick inhale. “John…”
about that, they’d be down there every other bloody day, and neither one of them could reasonably be considered young anymore.
(They’re both quite lucky all the needles are out of the way by the time Sherlock tackles him to the bed.)
Irene adjusts the dial down again, but also turns and picks up the vibrator from the bench. Holding it adjacent to the electric wand, she presses them both together to the center of his chest, drifting until the vibrator head touches one nipple clamp, leaving it there for a few seconds, then dragging them together across to the other one.
It is still mostly Sherlock who asks, or uses the light. John can, and has, but he doesn’t like to unless he’s relatively sure Sherlock would have asked for it anyway.
“Not funny, Doctor Watson,” Mycroft called over his shoulder as he rapped the bedroom door with the handle of his umbrella. “Let’s go, little brother, we’re going to be late.”
John continues the simple, familiar melody, albeit haltingly and a bit off pitch. He’s clearly a beginner, hitting an entirely wrong note now and then, playing eighth notes at the same speed as every other note, running out of bow during some stretches. But he corrects himself when he can and eventually makes it all the way through the song, finishing with a long, clear final D.
John stopped breathing as he tried to swallow around the lump in his throat. He was such an idiot. He had never realized the true depth of Sherlock’s love for him, but now, today, it had just become tangible, in the form of this cadaver heart on their kitchen table. His eyes pricked with tears as he realized how utterly ridiculous this would seem to anyone else, but how perfectly he understood what Sherlock was trying to tell him, how he was the only one who could, and what that meant.
He’s momentarily distracted by a piece of plastic mistletoe that has appeared out of nowhere in John’s hand. John holds it up over their heads.
“God, that felt good.” John throws an arm over his eyes, fully aware that Sherlock is still looking at him, because John hasn’t told him he can stop.
Irene looks at John, holding his gaze as she calmly says “On your knees.” For one brief ridiculous instant, John wonders if there’s been some confusion about who is here for what and if maybe he should just follow the command himself out of politeness until they get it all sorted.
“Really hard, actually. It’s one of the most difficult orchestral instruments to learn how to play properly.”
He smooths his hand down the front, his fingers drifting over the pleasantly scratchy honeycomb pattern as he walks back out to the living room. Sherlock is sitting properly on the sofa now, his face still bured in the journal. John drops beside him.
“God, none of this is okay.” John lowers his head, pressing the heels of his hands into his eye sockets. “Not what you did, not what I did.”
But there’s a bit of information overload happening, and he can’t quite contemplate relaxing into this enough to finish himself off.
John lifts the bow and pulls it to the right across each string in turn until he runs out of horsehair, then moves it back across, and does it again. “Hey!” he smiles dumbly, looking inordinately proud of himself. “I played something!” He runs the bow over the strings a few more times.
The idea that he would ever survive it a second time, whether it happened today or fifty years from now, is utterly incomprehensible.
John thinks about how to ask the question he needs to ask. “Can you tell me… what it does for you? I mean, obviously it’s not just… for fun.”
“Hilarious as ever, John,” Sherlock responded dryly. “I’ll be back in time for tea. Get something in, will you?”
When John is done, he lowers his hands to shove at Sherlock’s chest one more time, and steps back. He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. Sherlock is catching his breath with his head down, his eyes fixed on the ground.
He doesn’t acknowledge John as he sits in his own chair, or for the several silent minutes that follow.
“Really? What if I said that in five seconds, I’m going to walk over to you, put my hand behind your neck, and kiss you as hard as I can?”
“It could be incredibly valuable, we just have to wait another four months and eight days to open it and if the material inside hasn’t actually dissolved…”
But he doesn’t want to give Sherlock even one second’s temptation to cheat, so he holds his gaze, spits into his hand, and works his cock.
“Honestly, Sherlock,” John says as he pulls himself to his feet, “if you ever tell anyone that you can make me fall asleep by playing a lullaby, I will throw that violin out the window.” Sherlock smiles, a soft chuckle. “You know, maybe I should try playing you to sleep instead.”
