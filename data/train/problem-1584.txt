“You know? I think it’s sad that after all this time, you still believe that I risk my job and my life in general by being with you, only to gain some extra money and maybe a more luxurious life.” Joshua whispered while locking his sight at Sherlock and a dominant smile appeared on his face. “I don’t want money nor being called
"John? John Watson?" asked the boy, confusing John. "It can't be... It's me, Eliah! We used to play together when we were kids until mom decided to move into a workhouse."
"if I was on her ladyship place, I wouldn't have treated the boy with such tenderness and pampering; instead, spankings and appropriate punishments to correct that bad tempered and selfish boy." Interrupted the housekeeper, a woman on her forties. "Because he may be a gentleman thanks to his golden crib, otherwise, you could mistake him with anyone from Whitechapel* thanks to his temper."
"Said the man who shouldn't be a nosy lady in business where he's not required." John listened to Sherlock's words while taking out his clothes for the day; so... it seemed that after all, Sherlock wasn't that much asleep and did hear his words and, even worse, Sherlock did see him last night while he was in the stables with Joshua. "You're a dead man, Watson" thought as he got out of the closet with Sherlock's clothes while the latter was sitting on the edge of the bed, dressed only with a green housecoat beautifully embellished with delicate golden leaves embroidered on the edges of the garment with the finest silk one could find in Egypt.
Not too long after they entered the building, both gentlemen were taken one more time to the private area of the tea room; there, they took a seat at the table close to the chimney and Sherlock entertained himself with lighting a first cigarette, handed his silver cigarette case to his blond companion and decided to order for both of them after looking at John lost in his thoughts. “So, your father argued with you before or after?” Asked all of a sudden, snapping John out of his thoughts.
"All that... Sounds pretty good, but it doesn't answer why *his lordship* is looking for me." Said John sounding calm and confident in an attempt to hide his nervousness. "I haven't done anything wrong; I know he gave me the day off so I could rest and get used to this place but instead, I've been learning and working."
And there he was, sitting in a tube with warm water and soap covering his body (thank god) to his shoulders while Sherlock paced back and forth in the room, instructing him in the matters of proper manners at the table and on different social events.
"And I'm telling you I cannot tell you about it. Go to the Holmes manor for an interview and you'll be fine, honestly," the youngest Watson noticed the boredom on Sherlock's face and the way he kept looking the time on his pocket watch and sighed, "listen Eliah, my good friend, do as I say; go and you'll have a good job, you'll be treated kindly and the most important thing: There won't be another day where you have to look for food on the streets or steal coins from the naïve. Take good care and hope to see you at the manor." Smiled softly and resumed the walk, leaving his friend behind.
"Thank you, Adam. You may go." Answered Lord Holmes smiling softly. The boy obeyed and left John in company of said lord and his father, the latter sitting in front of the aristocrat. "Please, do not be afraid, Mr. Watson. I'm not going to reprimand you or fire you," smiled again, "actually, your father has a very interesting news to tell you."
“Ask him to wait in the drawing room. The blue one, also, ask him to have the payment order ready and ask one of the maids to take Mr. Watson’s things to his room.” Instructed Lady Holmes and smiled when the butler left the room, looked at the young men and almost laughed at their anticipation; “yes, you may leave. Just don’t tear the clothes apart in your excitement.” And laughed at the way the boys stood up so fast as if their seats had turned into hot lava.
John’s sleep was so deep that he didn’t notice when, two hours later, Joshua left Sherlock’s room and one of his shoes fell in the middle of the hallway on his way out.
Three days had passed without any other relevant misadventure (thank goodness!) and during said period, John kept trying to get used to his new life style; sometimes, it was weird for him not having to wake up before the sun came up to begin a new arduous day or that, after breakfast, his worst worry in the world was not knowing what he could do in company of Sherlock or what could go across his mind… Ah,
“As much as I’d love to fuck you several days, I would have to stop from time to time to give this beautiful arse some rest.” Joshua joked as he spanked the young Holmes and bit his neck, delighting himself with Sherlock's soft moan. “I love when you speak french.”
“Mister Watson? Mr. Watson, did you mentally leave us?” asked Wilde once more while Sherlock stared at John.
"I do apologize for his terrible behaviour," Mr. Holmes sighed, "I know his manners will make you think otherwise, but he did have an education. It's his annoying temper that ruins everything. Nevertheless, if at anytime in the future he does something like this again, please let me know."
*On the XIX century, Whitechapel was the poorest and most dangerous english neighborhood (nowadays, it's still rated as a risk zone.)
John laughed softly as a first answer, which confused the young aristocrat; and God, that laugh helped him in forgetting about the row with his father. “Yeah, he definitely should stop drinking gin;” sighed softly and even dared to smile, “Sherlock, that… that was
John's first reaction to this, despite his beliefs, was to admire every single inch of the young man's pale skin, his eyes darted every muscle, every freckle and, may God have mercy on his soul, he even dared to admire how the pair of bruises in the hips of the aristocrat made his skin look beautiful; the youngest Watson even had to clear his throat when he thought that probably those bruises were from the moment when Joshua held Sherlock hard while fucking him, oh, and the aristocrat's moans... What in God's name was he thinking? He should be utterly disgusted by the way he was looking at Sherlock!
"One could say that, Mr. Tisher," agreed the dark haired boy and sighed, talking like John wasn't there, "you'll see, my friend Mr. Watson, is visiting me for a while but unfortunately he didn't buy a proper amount of outfits according to the new trend, so I told him: "
P.S: I messed it up reaally bad with the servants wages during the victorian era (I mean, John shouldn't be earning 20-30 pounds, at least not per month lol) but I sort of fixed it with another character in this chapter. If you're interested, I'll leave you the link of the site that helped me to fix my mistake :D!
"Mr. Watson please don't hurry your son. After all, he's about to take a great decision regarding his future."
“Good God in heaven,” he whispered while stroking softly with his thumb the sleeve of one of the shirts, feeling drawn to the feeling of the silk and how elegant it looked, “Sherlock, this must be a huge mistake; this can’t be…”
"Then, I would be delighted if by the end of your shift, you came back to bid goodbye to your son; I give you my word that he'll be in good hands," Mr. Holmes spoke with such calm that it almost made John and his father forget all the screams minutes ago, "Don't you worry, John; I'll ask someone from the service to arrange the room next to Sherlock's and after you take breakfast, my son will take you to see Mr. Tisher, he's an excellent tailor and his brother is equally fantastic with the shoemaking business. Now Mr. Watson, if you please, go back to your duties."
When they arrived to the Brown hotel; where they previously had tea together for the first time; John could hardly wait to open the door by himself and jump down the coach, still, decided to wait for the chauffeur to do so and thanked him briefly.
“That! That’s what I find insulting: I’m not offended because I’m not the owner of the city, because that is true indeed; what bothers me is the _tone_ you use to explain certain things. What’s the need to be so acid and arrogant all the time? I’ve spent all my life in the slums of the city, Sherlock and still, I can swear in front of God and all the saints that no one is going to hurt you if you’re kind. Trust me.” Concluded the young blond man trying to be soft and patient as if he were explaining how the world works to a four year old.
With that explanation, John was lost in his thoughts once more while drinking tea without even noticing of doing so and barely sighed. He couldn’t judge Sir Wilde since all the playwright explained was full of reason: Sir Wilde was only known thanks to his splendid plays and tales; he wasn’t a criminal nor was intentionally rude… So? Was he going to judge the older man based on the way he was born?
"Not bad, Watson. You could look worse," murmured Sherlock while looking at him from head to toes, "however, I suggest you not to engage in a deep conversation with the tailor: He'll discover your background if you spend more than two minutes talking to him."
“I know that you had your doubts thanks to the Godless lifestyle that our friend here has chosen.” Continued Wilde once he noted John wasn’t going to reply. Nonetheless, you must understand that despite his occasional rants, Sherlock follows the path of a good man;” he drank a little from his glass of whiskey and sighed; “Do not consider speech as fervent intention to corrupt your current of thought and make you our ally, Mr. Watson. My only intention is for you to have the whole picture, not only the one offered by a fraction of our society; if, after this meeting you consider that the way we were born is anything but an honest kind of love and an abhorrent mistake, I won’t tell you otherwise and even defend your right to think differently.
), there, the look of surprise couldn’t abandon John’s face while he looked at all the clothes being stored in the room’s closet: That was impossible. Those nice clothes in fine materials couldn’t be
"Don't ask me, Watson. If I were his lordship, you'd be cleaning boots. No one in their right mind puts someone so short like you in the stables." Adam smiled and laughed at John's anger. "Cal down, mate. Remember: Threat him as his lordship, only do what he allows and talk only when he gives you permission to." whispered just outside the library. "My lord, here is John Watson."
Right now, John was seated at Sherlock’s personal library, listening to the latter talk about the latest methods in the chemistry field when Mr. Forner, the family’s butler, interrupted them with his arrival into the room.
"Is that so? Could you please, if you are so kind, to tell me every single part of a silverware set and the use of every part? Or please tell me how many servants do we have? Can't answer? Don't you worry, then please answer me: Who is your predilect composer?" Of course Sherlock didn't get a single answer and used the silence as a discreet victory. "That's what I thought. Don't talk more than two minutes with the tailor." Finished while walking to the entrance, taking every step with an elegance he seemed to have inherited from his father and before getting out, the butler offered him a top hat, which he rejected.
“Why? You barely understand english, let alone french.” Murmured the young aristocrat and turned around without breaking the embrace.
“It’s rather stupid to ask you to ignore a marquis when is one who could cause you trouble if you don’t start acting with the social modesty; which I find hypocritic and moronic, by the way; that is required from a man of your status.” Sherlock took a seat again, with John in a seat by his side and his guest sitting in front of them. “Nothing that you say will leave these walls, you can trust John, he would never, even by mistake, tell anyone about anything that you trust him with. Anything.”
Maybe Sherlock's physical appearance makes him look fragile and feeble, but soon John will learn the contrary.
All of this was meditated with his eyes still closed, lying on the bed while enjoying the heat emitted by the last of the wood in the fireplace, then he heard someone knocking on the door and stood up to open with a yawn.
“I hope so.” Whispered John and was about to say something else to the valet when someone knocked on the door and without waiting for an answer, Sherlock popped into the room; discreetly showing off his three piece suit decorated with the gold clock chain dangling from the pocket for his watch in his vest. “Well, I know we mortals can’t look as regal as you in such fancy clothes but don’t look at me like that.” John joked when noted the astonished look in Sherlock’s face, who also looked at him as if the young blond were a newly found marvelous creature.
The door of Sherlock's study was slammed open while the black haired boy was bending over a silver tray with a small snake pinned to be the victim of his curiosity (or for science sake, which was the same to the boy.) "We don't need to talk about the subject again and again, do we, father?" asked without even raising his eyes from the dead snake. Of course, that answer ignited Lord Holmes anger.
Guys, thank you so much for being patient and all your suggestions. Sorry for taking so damn long in updating but finally my laptop is working, so now I can update faster iui
Well, John just saw Sherlock's "adventures" the night before and now, he must face and endure the awkwardness of having to assist our  aristocratic gay pain in the ass :>
“No one lives without believing in something, it’s vital for your soul.” Was the first thing the youngest Watson dared to say.
"Oi, Watson!" Exclaimed a young boy outside the stables where John was working. John got down of a little bench as soon as he heard his name, going as quick as possible with the boy. "It took you ages to come, mate."
"By the way, Mr. Tisher, ignore the complaining my good friend could do regarding the materials you might use. He has the money but still loves to whine like if he didn't have a place to die." Sherlock added while the tailor showed John the perfect spot to stand by and the latter murdered the young aristocrat with his eyes.
"Of course not." Sherlock smiled sarcastic and with that little answer, he threw to the bin all his "guest" efforts to make the time a little more bearable.
"Hurry up, boy. Today you're going to work with me." Said Mr. Watson, the patriarch of the family; John nodded while trying to hurry up, minutes later he was at the poor kitchen table, helping his mother to serve breakfast despite the disapproving look his father shot at both of them. "This is a very important job, if you don't ruin it like everything else you do, we'll  make ends meet until  next month thanks to the fifteen pounds payment of today."
"Pacific as always, Joshua. Well, now that you mention it, on my way back with Graphein, two men looked at him like if they never saw an animal in their dull lives."
Because that’s what love was: A ruin, and now, it was a ruin that Sherlock would find out he didn’t want to escape.
“I know you won’t but please try to be in my shoes for a minute: two weeks ago I was in the streets looking for any chance to help my family to barely survive; obviously, no one has dressed me before, maybe only my mother during my early days as a child. Also, isn’t this boring to you? Dressing fully capable men?”
And that question landed him a look of confusion (and even a bit of disgust) from the servant. "What do you mean? You have to help his lordship with absolutely everything, just like I help you, and please, let me give you a piece of advice: don't bother in showing him all of his handcuffs, Lord Sherlock doesn't like to wear them, he only does so when Lady Holmes forces him to wear them." The servant smiled with that memory, and unintentionally, with that gesture he made it clear how much he missed being Sherlock's valet.
Sherlock sighed clearly annoyed, when he found the little rodent (who was trying to hide behind the grains containers), kicked it to scare it and send it away.
Thought John while walking along with his father and decided to agree with him even if he didn't like that philosophical current: John had never belonged to the high class (the most expensive thing he ever owned was a pair of black boots that his mother got him trough the woman she worked for, since said woman had a son of the same age as John and said son didn't want the boots... Well, at the moment John thought the boy's attitude was devious and arrogant but, who cared? That scored him completely new shoes.) but that didn't mean he wholeheartedly agreed with his father and neighbors opinion: All the high class was full with mean, selfish people and the poor class was full with kind-heart people.
Without further complaining or interruptions, both Watsons got out of the house, trying to cover themselves as much as their coats made it possible and started their journey to Harrow, a country town near London. The long journey consisted of fourteen miles (miles that could've been avoided with a cab if his father hadn't drink all the money during the last month) and during said miles, John distracted himself trying to memorize all the medical remedies he had once read months ago; he knew he would never have a chance of being a doctor (
With a grateful (fake) smile, Sherlock took the bill to keep it inside his jacket and got out of the shop while trying to keep the prices out of John's sight. With the same silence, and being a similar process with the tailor (but not as slow, to John's relief), they paid the promised visit to the shoemaker, who again gave another bill and let them go; despite of being done with the tasks for the day, the young aristocrat kept going through the streets of London with a peace unknown to John, ignoring every beggar that dare to ask for some mercy from him until one of the beggars, a young man close to John's age with the old clothes covered in dirt thanks to the temporal jobs he had and the street adventures, reached closer to them.
. Once they got in, a man showed them to a fancy tea room filled with only a few tables due to its privacy and both boys sat at a spot near the windows; Sherlock ordered for them and during their wait, put the books and paper sheets on the table.
"Do you want to tell me what happened out there, Sherlock?" Inquired Mr. Holmes totally serious, gazing at his son."And look at me when I am talking to you."
Sherlock reluctantly followed his father's orders (although his pouting gained him the sympathy from the butler because, just like the young maid said during breakfast, the young dark haired man was kind to all the house servants, being almost like a whole different person during his parents visits and balls.
The young aristocrat climbed the bed and slowly crawled towards his lover, being this his turn to smile proudly after kissing close to the groom’s groin; with a weak sigh, took the cock standing proudly in front of him and making a show of his abilities, swallowed entirely, tasting the curious mix of bitter and salty taste of pre-cum while Joshua’s soft moans filled his ears and provoking him to moan as well.
*Albany: Actually, it was called Albany street. During the the XVIII and XIX centuries, it was common to find female and male sex workers in there.
“I see my little lecture is already doing wonders on you, Watson; well done: you went from trying to drown me with holy water to give freedom to my ass.” Whispered the young aristocrat and laughed softly. “Anyway, I’m touched by your concern on my welfare but there’s nothing to worry about. I’m not planning on being in another relationship besides Joshua, unless a more
“And remember: if you need to pause in order to take a sip of your beverage or to speak with someone, you have to place your knife and fork on your plate, near the center and slightly angled in an inverted V with the tips of said knife and fork pointing toward each other,” said Sherlock on his third round pacing the room, “IF you are finished with the course, place the knife and fork, always parallel with the handles in the “
And his lordship, the marquis of Holmes wanted to change that "No-friends-for-me-thank-you" subject on his youngest son Sherlock, a boy who just became of age, dark twisted curls with a skin so soft and pale that reminded of the most expensive marble anyone could find; something that struggled everyday with his manners every time he took a not so optimistic walk at midday or during the dinners and balls his parents organized.
Once both boys were inside the carriage, John opted for spending the time in complete silence just to understand all the events that happened with great speed. If someone have told him five years ago that he would be gaining two hundred and forty pounds per year just by studying a career, spending time reading and being companion of a (bratty) young aristocrat, he would've laughed and even worried about the mental health of said messenger... But now, that was his reality: a reality where he would have to strive thanks to Sherlock's attitude and his questions about tableware and music: What is he going to do?
, just like that. That’s it.” John heard Joshua moan, something that made his stomach churn and feel something else, something unknown to John.
well, it’s simple, Watson: If you had the fit with your father before lunch, you’d still be at your mother’s, reluctant to leave her side in order to protect her from your father, who by the way, should stop drinking cheap gin if he wants to live another fifteen years.”
“Jealous? Me? Come on, John; we’re better than this. You know that this is anger and nothing more, not being contempt enough to go sinning around, they decided to bring their filthy despicable actions inside the house. Anger, that’s it and nothing more.” Whispered to himself while hating every moan, thump and pant he listened from the other room.
was his mother's suggestion once.) The only available option was to join the army but the idea of going from here to there, sleeping in dirty and uncomfortable places, protecting areas that didn't belong to him and killing young men that, just like him, were forced to fight one against the other just because an old woman and man couldn't resolve their problems face to face...well, it was nauseous.
"You're not living in any middle class home or in a banker's home, did you pay attention to this place? This manor is home to an aristocratic family, an important one and yes, it's true that Lord Sherlock's limbs are fully functional, one of our duties is to assist him and to the rest of the Holmes family. Now", the servant helped John and brushed his vest once again, just in case, "be a good man and go to his lordship's room, don't make him uncomfortable, don't speak if he doesn't asks you to and don't tie too tight his shoe laces or it'll be a bit tricky for you later if he decides to change into his riding clothes." And with that last piece of advice, that man sent John outside of the room.
"Move so we can get out of here. I have all the information for my father. Also, I presume you can't write and don't have any knowledge in Latin, greek, French or German." Interrupted Sherlock while opening the door and letting him get out first and John acknowledged his ignorance. The young Holmes sighed and after a short stop in a book shop (where he bought a couple of books, paper sheets, ink and pens) he directed John and himself trough Albemarle street until they stopped in front of a white large building, the facade getting along with the architectural fashion of the time and once again, a golden sign spelling the name of the place
"Well, ehr..." John hesitated and hated to acknowledge the truth: Earlier, Sherlock didn't lie about how John could ruin everything if he exceeded his words... The worst part was that he didn't even talk until that moment. Gold or nacre? He wasn't a girl to be wearing loads of jewelry and by what he saw about Sherlock and Lord Holmes, aristocratic men didn't wear it either. What then? "Nacre, I think."
Sherlock stayed completely silent while listening to his paid friend's words, feeling how every word was igniting his nerves with anger; as soon as John finished, he stood up, took him by the neck and slammed him back against the nearest wall. "
"Good choice, sir. Believe it or not you have a pretty similar taste to your friend. Every time Lord Holmes pays us a visit along his mother, Lady Holmes, he always chooses the same material for buttons like you did: elegant and discreet. Just like it has to be." The tailor smiled cordially and the rest of the work was done in the most efficient of ways, showing with every move and note the talent that ran trough Mr. Tisher's veins, proving why the Holmes clan didn't argue to pay such prices for clothes. "Your lordship, here's the bill and don't worry, it can be paid when you send someone to pick them up."
On the other hand, John couldn’t help to smile at knowing all the pride his mother felt, even if he felt a little guilty by leaving her alone. “Sherlock, do you think it can be arranged for me to not take breakfast on sunday so I can leave earlier to my mum’s house? I promise I’ll arrive shortly after dining time.”
Now, Joshua was sitting with his naked back against the headboard and he smiled delighted when Sherlock appear again in front of him, naked just as the day he was born.
At one in the morning, John gave up on trying to read an essay when he felt his eyes burning due to the tiredness and being up so late. With a yawn, he started to close books and put every paper and tools away to leave the room and go to sleep. Thank God he changed into his pajamas hours before; minutes later, John was tucked in bed with his head lying on the soft pillows.
Still, there’s an important lesson in the gospel of John men keep forgetting despite of being the most important teaching from God: ‘
"Come on, boy! Make your mind already, his lordship doesn't have all the day to put up with us." Interrupted Hamish Watson, gaining a chuckle from Lord Holmes.
If you're curious to listen to the song that Sherlock sings in this chapter, I'll leave you a link here (I own nothing) and the song is called "Star of love." :) https://youtu.be/nJBVawVue40
“Please, don’t hurry to declare “a shame” your ignorance regarding my person, sir. On the contrary, I’m not surprised at all that our good friend here hasn’t told you before a single thing about me since, sometimes, dames and marquises don’t find my presence very pleasant.” Oscar replied simply and sighed in a light dramatic way while Sherlock called his service to order tea for them.
"You're right, I guess." Said Sherlock, finding the servant's words a little strange when some women screaming caught his attention, he ran quickly to the back door for the servants and was welcomed by three housemaids screaming and avoiding the ground as if it had turned into a river of hot lava.
And that first thump was followed by more thumps on the wall; sometimes they were soft, others were rather fast and stronger although not that loud to wake everybody in that floor but loud enough to keep John awake. He sighed with anger and covered his head with one of the pillows to try to fall asleep again but failed since there were more and more thumps… but the worst was about to happen.
” Sherlock moaned again, wantonly this time; with that moan, John’s feelings took shape: Jealousy. He felt how jealousy buried itself in his chest and alarmed the blond man.
And silence followed after the quick and fast deduction; on one side, Sherlock was awaiting rejection, even mockery, he knew too well that happened every time he decided to share his deductions out loud; on the other side, John was simply trying to process such details as fast as his brain could. And the youngest Watson’s reaction was the one Sherlock less expected.
"I don't mean to be nosy but, what is this for? Are you planning to study something new?" Asked John while his friend took out a little silver cigarette case along with a matchbox, took a cigarette into his mouth to light it and breath the smoke.
"My lord, beware! There's a rat!" Warned the youngest housemaid, her eyes frantically scanning the floor.
Ok, so... I really don't have an excuse for updating after two long years (two more and I could've sent this fic to kindergarden lol) and I cannot promise to upload every single day (when I started this proyect, I was in my first semester of law school, now I'm in fifth) but I can promise to at least upload every other week. Translating takes a little bit of time and now, finally I'm acting like a grown up and I have a job at a legal firm (hopefully I'll get a new job in a court house where I live in ^-^), I'm trying to do my best to get the best grades possible (yeah, I dream that one day I can work with International Amnisty or an organization of that kind), taking care of my health (I'm chubby but trying to get in a better shape for myself c: ) and I'm even studying a third language (german. May God have mercy on my soul.) Anyway! As I said before, translating takes some time but I'll try to do it on the weekends :)
For John, the night passed between uneasy dreams, originated by the uncertainty of what to do about what he witnessed hours ago; maybe if he wrote to his mother about the matter, disguising it as a disturbing business that happened to a different family, maybe pretend it was a rumour he heard in the kitchens…
“How do I dare to speak so freely about our Lord and savior while, in Leviticus, I’m considered a damned man to the eternal fire and said text even encourages our authorities to eradicate my kind by the death penalty?”
“Astonishing? it really was?” Were the only questions the young man managed to ask. Good God, he sounded like a brute.
Not more, not less) and during those hours, even though Lady Holmes acted a bit sentimental towards him, those shows of affection could never match Mrs. Watson’s words and the letter written by her neighbour (he knew the woman didn’t write the letter, the tiny dots of mud betrayed her.)
The noise of the slammed door stayed behind his back as he walked quickly to go out into the garden and calm down for a moment. Why did he react like that? Why was he behaving like a foolish teenage girl? He was (sort of) dating Joshua and, besides, he hated John.
"Sherlock, go and look for Forner, ask him to order breakfast from Mrs. Casey, just for one person and offer her your deepest apologies for the inconvenience of such late breakfast." Ordered Mr. Holmes totally serious without even looking at his youngest son.
“I didn’t share my thoughts just to push you to break all the traditions you have with your mother. Keep going to church with her; sometimes, the only thing that keeps the poor alive is faith.” Then, Sherlock turned to raise his hand and order some champagne for them; surprising John with his words since it was the first time since they met, that the youngest Holmes didn’t use a disdainful tone to talk about the less fortunate.
"Mrs. Fisher!" whisper another housemaid, one of the youngest, after having another sip of tea. "Yes, it's true that lord Sherlock's temper isn't the best regarding to his guests but he's gentle and kind with us, therefore, I believe comparing him with Whitechapel, is far unfair."
“I may be hard as a rock, but my brain is still fully functional to let me commit such foolish act. If we were caught, my inheritance…” Sherlock began complaining until Joshua shut him with a kiss and, well, he was easily convinced in the end. Ten minutes later, both men dared to laugh softly when they passed John and he didn’t notice them; finally, they entered Sherlock’s opulent room.
"Oh for God's sake, Sherlock, cover yourself! We're men!" said and turned around to avoid looking any more at the youngest Holmes.
John's astonishment did not permeate during the rest of the tea or when they both consumed good tobacco during the rest of the talk that Sherlock was able to sustain him (something that also surprised him, but secretly thanked him greatly by causing him to forget of everything caused by his father hours before). In the end, noticing that people were beginning to arrive for a light pre-theater dinner, they returned to Harrow, immersed in a silence that had finally ceased to be uncomfortable. Finally.
"One question, mate: How did you do to go up? I mean, it doesn't matter how much we work, you can never mingle with the posh brats. How did you do it?"
"Lord, if you don't mind. I'm not interested in holding a crown." Interrupted Sherlock just for the pleasure of annoying the youngest Watson.
John nodded ashamed again. Jesus Christ, in that moment he would give anything just to be swallowed by earth! If his mother were listening to him right now, oh the nagging he’d be getting…
*Spitalfields was a poor neighborhood during the XIX century, habitated mainly by french silk weavers who broke when textile factories appeared in Manchester.
"Do not you worry, dear father. I am pretty sure that, when the times come where I have to marry, instead you'll find a fresh body with my clothes. Ready to bury." A sarcastic smile adorned his face while fixing his black silk vest and started to walk. "I am not even remotely interested in wasting my knowledge and time in something so absurd as that "love" nonsense nor having a fake person to call my friend. Therefore, you can hire the whole town to be my friends or my valentines since I will never, ever, have a real interest in any of the two." That being said, Sherlock finally got out of his study heading to the stables, ready for a horse ride to forget all his father's words.
"Of course I do." Agreed Mr. Watson, who barely woke up from his mental numbness (where he decided to hide in order to scape from the discomfort of the situation.) Just in time to answer.
John barely passed by a book shop when he bumped against the back of one unwary man who at the moment was staring at the store showcase, all while standing in the middle of the sidewalk.
His head kept spinning with the newfound information and even doubted if his shadow was homosexual (was that even possible?) until he heard his name far in the distance.
“Are you even listening to me? I NEVER said I didn’t believe in anything, John: I believe in knowledge, thus, in myself. You should do that sometime, would be great for you;” Sherlock exhaled again the smoke of his cigarette and shook his head; “I’d love for you to explain why is it so important to defend so much a religion that, after all, was imposed into you since your birth. And I want a logical explanation, not a “
"Mr. Watson, please do not worry about your clothes nor its quality. As Lord Holmes can tell you, his noble family has been doing business with mine for four generations and we never disappointed them." Said the tailor, beginning with his work. "Now please tell me: Would you like nacre or gold?"
"You didn't say it with your voice, no, but surely promised with your wandering eyes." Then, Sherlock left the room, leaving John in complete silence and a slight blush in the blond man's cheeks.
“My apologies, Watson, but you’d do well in listening to those words,” apologized Sherlock and began reading the actual words in the letter, “basically John, your mother expresses the pride you make her feel with your progress at writing and learning new languages, she thanks you for being such a
"No! It's French. And you'll learn it because not all the medical information is in English; also, German, Greek and Latin will be handy to you," promised the youngest Holmes, "I'll teach how to write at home."
After slamming the door, John walked down the alley of what had been, until no more than a week ago, his old neighborhood; he put on his jacket and coat again with disguised anger and sighed while looking around. Every small and overcrowded house still looked sad to him, just like the day when he first noticed his reality many years ago; then shook his head in a refusal to let sad thoughts conquer his mind and instead, kept walking until he reached the nearest avenue and arrived to what the upper class called “
"Your lordship, you and your compliments. If I was a lady, I would think you are trying to gain my affection." joked the tailor. Sherlock's family was a regular client since Mr. Thisher's great grandfather opened the shop, since then, every Tisher that owned the business knew that after a Holmes visited the shop, a good revenue stayed. "But let me tell you, without wanting to sound like an egoist, that the appearance of your friend lies in good hands. I guess it is going to be a couple of froc jackets*"
"Those posh bastards, they all are the same." Said Mr. Watson all of a sudden, distracting John from his train of thoughts, also helping him to realize that the sun finally araised and they were walking in open fields. "Always with those bloody balls and disgusting fancy clothes."
John's father looked at Lord Holmes and nodded. During John's absence, his father discovered that their employer had a young son who always caused him headaches and annoyance thanks to his lack of social skills and absence of interest in being involved in any social event, reaching the limit of being socially awkward; so, knowing that situation, Mr. Watson saw a great work opportunity for his own son. "You'll see, son;" Mr. Watson's voice was so soft and kind that John barely recognized him. "a couple of minutes ago, Lord Holmes gave me a chance to talk to him and it turns out that his younger son; a very fantastic boy in every aspect; wouldn't mind having a nice friendship like yours, since you are a young man easy to trust and your friendship is very valuable, therefore, his lordship and I think that...
John clenched his fists under the table. The little speech angered him; he had never met someone mean and cruel as Sherlock (and he even believed that kind of person couldn't exist until...well, the young aristocrat.) "Listen here, your
"You better be careful with your words, young man. You may be a friend  of the family in front of their friends and their relatives, but in the end you are just another servant. A very lucky servant." Suggested the servant after hearing him.
Even a feather falling could've been heard in the library due to the silence courtesy of Sherlock's words; both Watsons were discreetly trying to find a place to hide from the reigning discomfort; in the meanwhile, Lord Holmes tried his best to hide the anger behind his icy blue eyes: This was another humiliating situation committed by his son. And he would make sure it was the last one.
John shook his head. How was he going to fake an illness when the doctor came and checked on him? On the contrary, he simply allowed Charles to help him get dressed even if he still didn’t raise his arms on his own to get his shirt on. He wasn’t that useless yet.
Lord Holmes nodded. "Accompany him and be his valet plus assisting him when he bathes, for all these services you'll get a twenty pound payment and you'll have Sundays off. Obviously you'll get your meals in this house and for everybody else, you'll be presented as a friend visiting Sherlock for a while. All of this if you accept, of course."
Two months have passed since luck struck John with its irony in allowing him to fulfill his dream of becoming a doctor with the minimal cost of enduring the fickle character of the youngest in the Holmes family; but just as the days had passed, that haughty and prejudiced character of the black-haired man had disappeared (at least in John’s presence), resulting in calmer and even enjoyable days for both. Just as John had promised, he managed to learn in a short time everything that was required of a young man of his current position: he ate with elegance, he no longer doubted which cutlery to use at the table, he understood philosophy, Latin, some politics and history, gone were the days when he could barely write something half decent with a pencil, his manners with women had been polished... And although now it could be said that he was a "new" John, his humility didn’t wane nor his kindness toward everyone; his Sunday visits to his mother were carried out with an almost religious punctuality (although now he tried to meet her in a small restaurant, all because he now could afford such invitations and even managed to buy her a couple of nice dresses), and in those eight weeks he had never forgotten to send her his wages.
"Father!" Sherlock protested, unable to believe the news. "He's not my friend, the only thing I know is that this... man is son of a factory worker and an arthritic seamstress who just recently condemned her family to eat trash from the street thanks to her foolish decision of feeding eggs and milk to her youngest son, instead of the typical moldy bread he hates. Also, they live in the slums."
“Mummy, please don’t talk to us in such a childish way. None of us is six years old.” Protested Sherlock by the way his mother was treating them.
"You may be right about how wrong is to meddle in someone else's business, but trust me, it's even worse to be intimate with someone of the same sex as you are. God will forgive me for my sin if I beg him with a kind heart and good deeds, but your sin? I'm afraid you won't find silk shirts and golden buttons in hell." John rebuked him, which only got Sherlock to roll his eyes with boredom.
And that lesson is the one I intend to practice every single day until my last breath; loving another human being shouldn’t prevent you from loving God, Mr. Watson.”
"Watson, good morning", greeted one of the servants while entering the room to leave in bed John's outfit for the day, then stayed to dress him, "remember that you have to wake Lord Sherlock and dress him."
I will stop promising to get you guys a new chapter every week or day bc then it never happens (not me being lazy but oh boy, uni decided to be a nice pain in the ass during a pandemic. Even on winter break.) :( All I can say in my poor defense is that I'll try to not let you guys think I abandoned this forever, not gonna promise every week, but also not so long that you guys see me as a lost cause.
I will be forever grateful and sorry in not being an author who updates weekly (at least in this work, I should update every two days at least, since I only have to translate... but translating is difficult when you don't have a major on it) or at least twice per month. I'm not saying it's going to take me another 3 months to update again but certainly I'm not going to update this week (or maybe I will to spend nicely my last week of vacations from uni c: ) I also have to work in more chapters for the sequel of this story ("When you're smiling" probs will translate it too) but that will be for another time.
John stood up as fast as he could and hugged his friend just as happy. “Eliah, you listened to my words!” said after breaking the hug, “These are fantastic news! And for what I can see, you got a nice position at the house. What’s your job in there?”
While John was defining his future inside the library, the young rider from minutes earlier, arrived at the stables in the Holmes manor and, as soon as the rider step in ground, a young man with green eyes and short brown hair went to help him.
"Yeah, whatever. But what's your job about? Maybe I can ask for a similar position." He insisted, trying John's patience.
“The life of a man without a task, results in boredom, not the task itself,” smiled the servant while brushing his shoulders, “therefore, things like these will never bore me. But don’t worry, Mr. Watson, when you least expect it, you’ll raise your arms for me to help you with your shirt without being told to do so.”
" Thought while handling the blonde man, then, a servant came in time when the young aristocrat was about to deliver the first punch.
"I came in twenty minutes ago; it's been two hours since you had breakfast. I asked Forner to tell you the carriage was ready, you; obviously; didn't answer and went to tell me. That is why I am here." Sherlock answered nonchalant while looking himself in the mirror, fixing his coat just for the sake of vanity. "I asked Harker to drop one of my old clothes into your closet room, it's a bit old I'm afraid: from three years ago, but it will suit you well for the moment." Concluded without taking his eyes from the mirror, being the only time of the day (or even the month) when he loved to look at his own reflection.
A little bit of this and that, honestly, it's a chapter not exactly neccesary in order to understand the rest of the story. But fun nonetheless, our boys start to get along a tad better (still, they aren't the best pals or love doves...yet :p)
"Lord Holmes? I'm forever thankful of all the kindness and generosity you're showing towards me but sir, I'd rather wait a couple of months before I visit Mr. Tisher and his brother." Asked John kindly, ignoring when Sherlock blanked his eyes with annoyance.
Hamish Watson stared at his son for a couple of seconds and left without a word, not caring in going back later to say goodbye and leaving a confuse John behind: How on earth is he going to pay for the new clothes and shoes? John had his shoes thanks to his mother, who sold some marble from old bottle caps*, yes, his shoes were of a poor quality and were painful during his walks on winter... but it was far better than going barefoot trough the snow.
"Miss Cathrine Wyndham payed me a visit; which I observe as unnecesary; and during said visit, we played a really boring chess match, then we had tea and as her left hand can tell you, she's not even capable of having a decent conversation with another human being with an acceptable reasoning capacity." Sherlock answered without hiding his boredom, then, he turned back again to his little snake and the acids that lighted up his curiosity one more time. That, of course, did nothing but rise his father's annoyance.
"Not me, you." Sherlock got his chair closer to the table. "For now, you are only capable of speaking English, are ignorant of all the romance and poise French can give you, if you try to read one of Plato's papers, you'll understand nothing but the illustrations; for example, if I say "
Now, having to marry a woman just for the sake of having an heir? The idea of having a family with a gender he felt no attraction at all was just as lovely as joining the army. Therefore and thanks to the moral rules that prevailed at the time, every single week, there could be seen a young, naive lady (believing she could be the best match for Sherlock) abandoning the Holmes manor and cursing Sherlock in bitter silence while doing her best to decline the kind apologies offered by the young man's parents. So, if people could stop trying to force him into such topics and left him alone with his books, maps, experiments and music, he would be thankful and in exchange he would stop offending every single lady that'd visit him in the future.
On the other side there was Sherlock, a mix of boredom and annoyance thanks to John's reactions, he started to feel exasperated at his paid friend's face when the home made jam was served but, what could anyone expect from the youngest Holmes? The longest time he had to wait for dinner were fifteen minutes three years ago (thanks to a little delay from the cook.) Therefore, he truly never experienced hunger, his tailor-made clothes were always in perfect condition, his only worries in the world were: books, knowledge and his arrogance. Then, how would he understand everything that John was going trough if his own "tragedies" couldn't even be called that way?
“It took my John, unfortunately, twenty two years to learn to write but look at him,” replied Mrs. Watson showing the letter again to her neighbor, she’d never stop feeling proud of her son; “but now he even writes to me! All by himself and without help.”
“Letter and visits, Sherlock, can be sent and solicited in both ways; all since waiting for only one side of the friendship to do all the communication, can turn into a dull business.” Replied Oscar while holding his hand, showing a better smile than the one from his host. “I see that you keep that nasty hobby of yours where you ignore your other visitors when a new one arrives.” Said to point out John’s presence and how he was still not introduced by Sherlock.
"One's never too young to work and survive, on the other hand, he's a bloody lucky bastard: he didn't have to work since age five like I did..." He felt the serious gaze of his son and sighed. "Get rid of that idiotic look of your face and hurry up, John." Snapped John's father and the young man held any complain.
"My lord, maybe they weren't staring at your horse, maybe...they were blinded by something, or someone, more...beautiful." Joshua smiled softly.
; maybe if you stopped interrupting people so much and used those beautiful lips of yours in better duties, you’d be able to listen to other people’s ideas and wishes;” he then bit the aristocrat’s Adam’s apple and smile at the received moan; “I think we should finish this business in your bedroom, what do you say? Everybody’s gone to bed, your father is gone to a hunt in Devon, so he won’t come back until next week, your mother sleeps like a rock and your room isn’t next to hers. No one will know…”
Then, John again had to abandon his train of thoughts when his eyes finally caught sight of a three floor building in the middle of a rather vast green field; he's never been there before but was pretty sure his home fitted from ten to fifteen times inside of his future work place, all of this ignited his curiosity and attention: They wouldn't be working in a middle class house, an office or a banker's house; that house showed from the distance the aristocratic status of its inhabitants. Suddenly, a horse galloping could be heard getting closer and closer in the path; John stepped aside to let it pass trough when he got a glance of the young rider travelling in opposite direction to them, the young rider gave Mr. Watson and son a haughty look and turned his face as he got away on the horse.
When John sensed that Sherlock was at least a bit covered, turned around and dressed with a sigh: helped him to button his shirt, waited until Sherlock put on his pants to help him with his silk socks and the boots and once he finished with the rest of the clothes, sighed again but now with certain satisfaction for a task well done.
P.S: Sherlock made a reference that he may be an atheist and showed himself a bit disrespectful (wow, flash news, call the BBC!) to John's religion. I believe in God (although I'm not a fanatic) but still, I feel the need to state that Sherlock's comments weren't made to be rude towards anyone's belifs.
Both men went upstairs as fast as they could, ignoring all mannerisms and rules until they reached John’s room (or, as it was known between the bitter and envious members of the service:
John barely managed to nod... until another question popped into his head. “But… how is it possible that you talk about God and his rules if, well, you know…?” He tried to ask but didn’t manage to find a word that didn’t leave him as a mean man.
In that moment, Sherlock’s thoughts were completely fogged by his own arousal and was clearly annoyed when Joshua stopped paying attention to his body. “Wow, you had an idea. We must hurry and sell the story to the papers,” said annoyed and sighed, “you know very well that I cannot ask my father to give you a raise. What would be the excuse for that request?
The youngest Watson spent the next thirty minutes in looking at everything, wondering how could a shirt match with certain suit and so on while trying to ignore his father’s words inside his head that he gave John on their way to the manor many days ago about how he should never become a “filthy posh pig.” John shook his head and asked shyly if he could get a bath; again, he had to ignore a servant’s indignation in his eyes ( what did they want from him? He wasn’t used to get everything done for him; for God’s sake, four days ago he still was looking for ways to survive,) he wanted to look decent for the expected visit and, if he was honest, he didn’t want to embarrass Sherlock in front of the visitors.
His valet simply laughed softly while picking up his grooming tools. “Mr. Watson, sometimes, that’s what you have to pay for a friendship.”
Sherlock smiled haughty, triumph resting on his face: Just one word, one little lie and he could send John back to the slums of London... Still, he had a better idea. "I'm absolutely fine, Harker; Mr. Watson asked me about my passions and my leisure activities, talked to him about boxing and he asked me, charmingly as he comes, if I could show him some movements after breakfast. That's what you saw when you came in. Still, please do tell me what were you going to say."
"Oh, Lord Holmes!" Greeted the tailor; a man whose hair was beginning to become a mix between black and gray; with a smile and a great mood once he came back from the counter. "If you allow me a word, your lordship, I see you brought a shopping pal with you." The man smiled while looking at John from head to toe, the latter smiled awkwardly.
John was in complete silence. This was a huge opportunity: His work shift, instead of keeping him going from here to there since seven in the morning until six in the afternoon, would only have him reading by the side of a young man or riding with him, walking through the countryside or whatever the aristocrats did during their free time... And for that he would get 20 pounds per month (something that John could barely believe), he'd have Sundays off (he could visit his mother), new clothes and what's even more important: A chance to finally become a doctor was finally close.
Mr. Holmes took a deep breath at the insult. "John Watson nor Mr. Watson are a vazey, Sherlock. From now on, John will improve your life with his friendship, therefore, I expect you to treat him like the gentleman you are."
“John. He insisted on needing to understand one of Montesquieu theories; I finally managed to escape, I left him trying to understand
“It will take you some time to achieve it, Evelyn” said Mrs. Richter, standing up from the poor made table that also served as Mrs. Watson’s work station; “mostly because you barely have any free time to spare.”
Well, I have no more excuses to not update this work, hehe. I'm in quarantine, no home office (after all, I'm just an assistant in a local court house) and no school (yet), so, I have a lot of free time to translate and update.
"I wasn't asking you for that unnecessary information, Sherlock. John is going to live with us from this day on, he'll have a room next to yours and you will always be thankful for his kind company, otherwise, you can ask Forner to do your luggage and move into Spitalfields* with all those frenchs so you can behave like a barbaric young fool!" Exclaimed his father, finding himself on the limit of his patience with a deeper discomfort in the room as a result of the shouting. Minutes passed without an answer from Sherlock, then, Lord Holmes touched his well combed dark hair and sighed. "Mr. Hamish, you understand that your job at the stables is only for today, don't you?"
Told himself and kept walking. Thirty minutes later, the long walk ended and they finally reached the Holmes manor.
After all, the man behaved almost like God asked of all his children. Just like he tried to do as well.
There he saw the bed and, allowing himself a childish moment, jumped into the fluffy mattress and laughed when he landed. "Don't worry, dear mother, soon you'll be as comfortable as I am." Promised again to the empty room and closed his eyes, just for a while.
"His lordship needs you in the library." Answered Adam, one of the indoor servants, while looking John up and down and sighed trying to tide John's hair a little. "wish we could get rid of that awful smell from your hair."
"But you saw him! Did you hear him? He's an insufferable brat! How does he dare to say that we the poor only exist to serve and nothing else? Yes, I agree that we spend a lot of time working  but when we sit at night to take our dinner, we can do it proudly; not minding if it's the best or worst food ever; because we worked hard for it. What does he feel at dinner? Nothing, on the other hand, you and I can fill ourselves with pride and honour for the knowledge and ability of survival. And just for that, we are far more worthy than he think he is."
Seeing how a man is an imbecile and being marvelous at the same time, how a simple mathematic equation transforms into a train. When I do something right, its because I know what is right, when I don’t, is because I chose to misbehave; I don’t act right because “that’s what God wants” nor I’m afraid of making a mistake because “
Were John's father words after he told him a little bit about his dream,) but that fact didn't stop him from at least snoop between all the topics and remedies the medical community worked with everyday.
John didn't pay any attention to his comment and fixed his shirt sleeves when he started following Adam's path. "And why does Mr. Holmes wants to see me?"
The lustful bastard who didn’t let him sleep more than a few hours. The son of a bitch who was sitting so calm and happy by the right hand of his mother.
And John had to admit the slight fright Sherlock inflicted upon him with his serious gaze. No… it couldn’t be, right? Surely his mind was playing funny tricks on him: He had read on the papers about the Wilde family, how Oscar was married. Married with a lady. Married with a lady and two kids. Someone like Sherlock didn’t like women and obviously couldn’t form a family at all.
I don’t have much to say for this chapter, except that I’m thankful for the kudos and the comments you guys leave :)!
Thirty minutes later, John was in his room, (still) feeling awkward at being dressed while his valet tied his black tie.
“I don’t see you as much I would like to and that doesn’t stop me from adoring you; so, now I need to understand even the most sophisticated words in french just to adore your voice in that language?” The young man smiled and finally kissed him on the lips for the first time that night. Minutes passed and the young man kept devouring the aristocratic lips and every inch of ivory skin being revealed. “Sherlock? I have an idea.”
"My lord, the room is...ready." The servant interrupted himself by the scene and hurried to put them apart. "My lord! Are you alright, sir? What happened?" Asked while Sherlock fixed his cufflinks and John tried to do his best with his own tie.
Anyway! Hold on, I'm currently working on translating chapter three (for people who were following the previous translation of this work) so I can start working on chapter four.
“Don’t worry, sir. I’ll ask Mr. Enfield or one of his assistants to take care of that branch; if you want, I can report you ill to Lady Holmes so you can spend more time in bed.”
“It’s been barely fifteen seconds, Oscar. Impossible to greet a friend and introduce another in the same amount of time; or it’s impossible if we go by your standards.” Sherlock shook his head, buttoned his jacket and stood aside to introduce his now friend. “John, this man is a very good friend of mine since I was in college: Sir Oscar Wilde; Oscar, this is a fresh acquaintance turned into friendship: Mr. John Watson, he’s paying me a visit for a while.”
The young Holmes simply nodded with certain disinterest, being more involved with his monologue of table manners and how to behave with a female acquaintance, young and old; the latter subject seemed ironic to John, at least ironic in the way of Sherlock knowing all that information if he seemed to never use it (and being terrible awful at it.) At the end of John’s bath, he reluctantly left the room in order to give the young Watson some space.
You know I can’t do that.” Concluded and kissed his lover again, attempting to resume the affair but soon his hands had to stop his efforts in opening Joshua’s pants when the latter took a handful of his hair to stop him and tugged to get his attention.
The young aristocrat turned around once he heard the youngest Watson’s voice; and the latter, could swear to God himself, saw Sherlock smile for a second; and looked him up and down followed by a sigh. “Do I need your permission to come here? Or is it that now I need to give you one of my visit cards to announce my presence in the city? London belongs to everyone, Watson. You’re not her owner.” Then continued to look at the showcase a bit longer, then his blue-grey eyes looked down at the time in his pocket watch and even dared to call for a couch, all in complete silence to enjoy the simple but delicious art of annoying John Watson. “It’s almost tea time and the last train leaves in three hours; unless you’re planning to sleep one more time on the streets to revive the good old memories, come with me.” Simply instructed when the coach arrived and the coach man opened the door for him.
“To begin with this funny business, Mr. Watson, you must know that I’m a devoted catholic, even if I’m not an “official” one. The love I profess to another man can co-exist gracefully along the love our heavenly father has for each one of his children. Another point for you to keep in mind is that, even if Leviticus* condemns any kind of loving relationship that isn’t between a lady and a gentleman, you surely know that the biblical book in question also forbids eating pork and seafood… which is funny since I understand you’ll be served seafood for dinner tonight; also, the Bible states how much of a sin it’s to charge interests on a loan.
Again, thank you for reading, all the kudos and kind comments! You guys are the best <3 Stay safe and have a good 2021 :)!
The young aristocrat walked carefully into one of the empty stables (someday he’d ask his dad to get more horses, maybe one day) lighted feebly by a lonely candle left over a wooden crate; this time, he was fully dressed and when he was reaching for the candle, he felt a hand covering his mouth while being hugged by his waist from behind.
butter looked so different from the one his mother used to serve him when there was enough money for bread and butter... Good God, he was going to be full until the next month's breakfast.
was playing with his thin patience. “As much as theological topics are favorites nowadays for a chat between commoners, I’m afraid I’m not one of those;” this time, he lit a new cigarette and took his time to exhale the smoke; “nevertheless, I will dare this time with hope that in the future this topic shall never be brought up again: I don’t visualize “
“The boy possesses a unique talent, unfortunately, said talent is minimized by the brute he has as a father.” John heard the playwright conclude and the young blond took the chance to readjust in his seat, looked at Sherlock pour a cup of tea and frowned; how far did he travel in his thoughts that he didn’t even notice when Mr. Forner brought the tea?
*, he sounded like his normal annoyed self. “I just came to hurry you up, the stupid visits of my mother are about to arrive.” And with that, left the room slamming the door.
Allright, THAT was going to be an interesting challenge. Interesting and awkward: the youngest Watson would have to see every single disastrous effect on Sherlock's body result from last night's "adventure." But, now that he thought about it, "dressing" Sherlock didn't mean to exactly dress him, did it? The young lord wasn't a toddler and was old enough ("Come on, last night he had sex. Sex with a man." thought John and tried to forget about it as soon as possible) to be able to get dressed all by himself; then, surely he only had to go to Sherlock's room, leave him his fresh clean clothes and wait outside of the room.
young man; despite all of these good feelings, she also let you know about the melancholy that invades her everytime she remembers you aren’t home and ends the letter stating her impatience for sunday to arrive and see you once more.” He folded the paper and put it back into the envelope with a sense of disgust at all the sentiment he just read: Why Mrs. Watson couldn’t behave like a normal woman and be like his own mother? Sherlock could easily count all the hours he had spent with his mother in all his life (
"You are very lucky indeed, Watson." Scolded Sherlock as soon as Eliah couldn't hear them. "During all your disgraceful chat, none of my parents’ acquaintances or friends happened to be around; otherwise, their social life would have ended if someone had seen you being kind to a beggar."
And he had never come between the sins of Sherlock and the stable boy again. He still didn't quite understand Sherlock’s hobby for risking his life for a shag but maybe he would someday.
"Of course, Lord Holmes!" Said Mr. Tisher rather excited knowing his brother would be benefited from the boys shopping trip. As hurried as he could be, the tailor fetched one of his fastest employees and sent him with the notice to his brother. "Do not worry, your grace; Timothy has the fastest legs I have ever seen. Now, Mr. Watson if you please."
John sighed at the image but still offered his kindest smile to his employer and secretly gave her son a deadly look. It was needless to say that John's bad mood raised when he did not rest the hours that he was used to sleeping, whether being few or too many hours. “Good morning, Lady Holmes.
Meantime, John kept eating in relative silence to allow Sherlock reorganize his thoughts or whatever that could happen inside that bright, insane mind of his until he noted how the young dark haired man seemed to be barely breathing. “Sherlock? Are you all right?” Repeated a couple of times and sighed at the lack of answer. “I’ll go for help;” and stopped when Sherlock grabbed his hand; “So, you don’t get many compliments that often, do you? I mean, you sat dead like in your chair for minutes.”
Sherlock could only open his mouth to say something but he couldn’t do even the tiniest of sounds, he closed his mouth and opened again a couple of times until he started to get annoyed at himself and his behaviour. Come on! Why was he behaving like a young virgin looking at her valentine?
John cleared his throat embarrassed. It wasn’t enough that he lost himself thinking silly things while the playwright talked, now the latter surely thought John found him boring and not worthy of his attention. “Yes, no. I’m still here, well… I felt a little sleepy because, you know, the tea was rather hot; please forgive me.”
In the beginning, Sherlock believed that John, angry and annoyed as he was, would tell on him with his mother but as soon as he heard the lie, he smiled relieved. Nevertheless, that gesture didn’t last long once he saw his friend’s stern look.
“My darling boy,” said Lady Holmes during that fourth morning during breakfast with Sherlock sitting at her right side and John to her left, “you already know that we still owe a visit to the Carmichaels from last winter’s season but before that visit, Lady Nitt and her daughters will come for tea at midday; I hope you’ll get yourself into a better froc and behave like the gentleman you are.”
And now he found himself in the family dining room accompanied by a cup of tea while the butler served breakfast to John and the latter looked at his plate totally amazed, almost unable to contain his surprise: toasts, ham, eggs and beans were server to him in portions John would have normally shared with his whole family; when he reached the butter, he couldn't stop to think why did
"What your father is trying to say, Watson." Interrupted Lord Holmes. "is that in your new position you'd serve as a valet with the exception that you can borrow any book that you want from the library, you'll get decent clothes so you can accompany Lord Sherlock to different places; even, if you wish, we'll sponsor in any subject for you to study. You'll have the room next to my son's so if he ever needs your help during the night, you can reach him easily."
“I won’t.” Sherlock stepped back and watched as John relaxed his shoulders and adjusted the grip on his camera. He looked down the length of Sherlock’s body as he stepped backwards. He licked his lips in that maddening way of his. Sherlock wanted to chase after him but turned instead. In a moment, he looked back over his shoulder and John was nearly on shore. Sherlock lowered himself so his knees touched the sand and his chin touched the water’s surface. The tips of his curls dipped into the water. He leaned down to run his hands along the softest sand he’d ever felt. He ran his hands up his thighs, over his stomach, to circle his hard nipples. He circled them and leaned his head back to feel the sun on his neck. God, it felt good. He ran his hands down his body, touching, swirling his fingers over every inch of his skin, front and back. He rubbed, brushed, caressed, teased at his sensitive skin. He was hard as stone and panting, the sensation of bathing light and water on his body beyond pleasure. It was love. He was loved by John. He loved John.
“It’s not like it was. He was there one minute and gone forever the next. I felt like I needed to feel the end longer, does that make sense? But it’s been a while and it’s gotten better with time. My career is totally different now. My life is different.” He pulled Sherlock’s hand to his lips so he could kiss his fingers.
Once the cocaine high wore off he was left with a bit of body dysmorphia from the ketamine. He could handle that, it was the hallucinations that were most unnerving. They were getting more vivid and it was harder for him to be sure of what was real. Blurry vision. Were his eyelashes moving? They undulated like wheat fields in a strong breeze. His shoulder and neck hurt from lying on his side on the ground.
you. I want you so much. You’re my ideal man, you’re the best partner for me. I don’t want sashimi and classic guitar. I told you, I’m yours.”
He smirked, hoping he projected a calm he did not feel. Butterflies fluttered in his gut and his heartbeat pounded in his ears. “Am I? How so?”
As my mind wrapped itself around this new reality, I realized that I had not considered the possibility that John Watson would be eager to date, would be able to pull said date, and that I would be a witness. Inwardly, I cursed my stupidity.
John reached up and tentatively placed both hands on either side of Sherlock’s neck. “Are you all right?” He let his eyes wander over Sherlock’s features. The maniac was still smiling, grinning even.
“I want to make another toast,” he said. Sherlock looked up at him expectantly. “From the very first moment I met you, you filled in my blank spots. You lit up the dark. You healed me. And now that we’ve finally become...what we are now...I can honestly say I have never been happier. I love you.” He raised his cup.
Maybe he just needed some air, or a few days to remember that there was something that had kept him with Sherlock for all of these years.
John watched until Sherlock was done. The counter was clear. Sherlock grabbed a dish towel and was drying his hands as he turned. He looked a bit surprised to see that John was staring at him, but recovered nonetheless and smiled. He leaned back against the counter and stared back at John.
“Lovely. That suit reminds me of one you wore in Milan,” John said, before he could stop himself. He cringed internally. He hadn't really wanted to reveal that he'd watched that show. He really had no reason to watch that show.
He had a voice. A particular way of speaking, like the Majors with whom he’d spent so much time. “Take off your coat. Stand here,” he pointed at a spot near the windows.
“By what?” John bit his bottom lip as he tried to suppress a grin. His chin was dipped slightly down, so he was looking up at Sherlock through his lashes, eyes so blue in the morning sunlight. His stomach flipped.
John kept his hand warmly on the side of his neck, maybe feeling the pulse in his carotid. He would be able to tell that it sped up.
He heard a high-pitched scream and a door slamming. Officers shouted, “In there! Go around!” Vague orders that could not be understood unless inside the apartment. He was incredibly frustrated to not be in there, but John stayed still.
Sherlock’s eyes were nearly colorless in the afternoon light. The photos played with light and dark. The light of his eyes against the dark streaks of lashes, brows, and fringe. The pale pink of his lips, parted, so the inside of his mouth was darker but for a small flash of white teeth. His tongue peeked out to wet his bottom lip. John captured every millisecond of the movement. As he moved around the chair shooting him from different angles, Sherlock reached out to brush his hand over John’s bum or calf or thigh. When John was really engrossed in his subject, he murmured little phrases out loud. He said, “God, but you’re a pretty thing,” and “Yes, lips, just like that,” and “Makes me want to do things.”
Miles McMillan is *one* of the inspirations for model!Sherlock. Look up his photoshoot for Purple Magazine. You're welcome.
He woke up alone in a Kabul hospital. He spent several days asking after James and his men, but frustratingly little information was forthcoming. John was not supposed to be present at the operation. His suspicion was that James had somehow gotten him out, quietly and unofficially. John Watson was a ghost, omitted from the record.
He heaved a huge pathetic sigh, hunched his shoulders even more so his tall frame was as ball-like as he could make it. He cradled his casted arm to his waist.
Rage clouded his thoughts, but he needed to think. Needed to think for Sherlock. Needed to think like Sherlock. He concentrated on the blue plates hanging on the walls of the stairwell. He counted every one, blinking and concentrating on long exhaled breathes through his mouth.
John cleared his throat, which prompted Greg and Mycroft to break their gaze. He said, “Did you find people being held here? We believe that at least two young men were being held here. Mary made a deal with some men - Seb, Orkun, and Duncan. There was money exchanged. We need to find them.” By the end of this, John was almost frantic with worry at the non-reaction he was getting from Mycroft, whose face remained frustratingly blank. John clenched his jaw and both fists.
Sherlock nodded as he fluffed his hair and patted his pockets making sure everything was as it should be. He grabbed his book and turned to walk down the stairs.
I asked myself why I needed to do this. A romantic entanglement would slow me down. I had little experience with carnal passion and a man like John needed an experienced and passionate lover. I would not lower myself and succumb to base desire. It was beneath me. I could feel my chest and face flame with shame at the thought of such an embarrassing release of control. No, I would not give in to whatever foolish sentiment had taken hold of my brain.
They had plans to meet at the Pret on the corner. John had paced on the sidewalk the whole time Sherlock was out of his sight. When he saw him - walking up the sidewalk, tall and lithe, head tilted down but looking at him from under his too-long fringe, lips parted, just a tip of his pink tongue touching his perfect white teeth - he froze stock still right there on the street. He’d never seen anyone more beautiful. He knew then, he had no choice, and there was no other way. The pull was impossible to resist any longer. They’d solve this case and he promised himself that afterward he would initiate the conversation they needed to have. Resolve the tension finally and see where it might lead. The prospect of a chance with Sherlock made him inappropriately giddy. He hadn’t felt this way in a very, very long time.
Probably should post this on Chapter 1, but this fic is not brit-picked or beta'd. All errors are my own and I fucking like it that way ;)
Sherlock licked up the shaft of John’s broad cock and John held his breath in anticipation. Just as Sherlock’s lips reached John’s frenulum, John felt long fingers sliding along his right ankle into his sock, moving it down and off his foot.
Greg took gloves and a plastic bag out of his coat pocket and carefully collected the belt. “We know she’s on this.”
Unfortunately, their targets knew of the plan beforehand. The General and Operative were not even in the village when the local Taliban engaged James' unit in a quick-paced and deadly gun battle.
Sherlock cut him off with a kiss, swallowing John’s moan as his body stilled and his cock jumped against Sherlock’s. He licked into John’s open mouth as he panted and sighed through his orgasm. He bit and licked at John’s lips as he shuddered.
John’s stomach fluttered again. He didn’t speak for a long moment. Sherlock didn’t speak either. “It’s good to hear your voice too,” he finally said.
“All right,” Sherlock answered seriously. John smiled and it was a huge, honest thing that crinkled his eyes and revealed two almost-dimples in his stubble-covered cheeks.
After several moments of wet and delicious kissing, the corners of John’s mouth quirked up, exposing his teeth in a huge smile. Sherlock pulled away to smile back. The giggling started and since they couldn’t really kiss through the excited laughing, they simply went back to the tight hug they’d started with. They rocked back and forth until the laughter turned into something softer and they could look at one another again.
He opened his legs as wide as he could. John pushed up to sink both hands into Sherlock’s hair and pull. He gasped. “F-fuck,” he stuttered out. John went for his throat once more. Sherlock felt the soft tickle of John’s chest hair, his soft cock on his belly, his strong thigh nudged up just under his balls, pressing hard. Held down, pinned by pulled hair, rough bites at his neck, and hard thighs. His mind buzzed with arousal, the taste of John in his throat, the salt-sea air filling his gulping lungs. Surrender. He raised his arms above his head, giving in, knowing John would take care of him.
Sherlock said he wanted to touch every centimeter of John’s skin. Turned out, he wanted to do this with his tongue. His very clever, oh-so-long and dextrous tongue.
He was dimly aware that he was probably choking John and threw his hands out to his sides. “Oh my god,” he whispered.
Sherlock tipped his head to one side, widened his eyes, and looked down sideways towards John’s lower half. The indication was clear and John blushed adorably.
The man opened a door that looked slightly more reinforced than a typical office door and shoved Sherlock into the dark room. He heard a soft snick behind him as it closed. He turned and awkwardly tried the handle with his bound hands. Of course, it was locked. His blurry vision had improved slightly, but the room was so dark he couldn’t see anything anyway. Starting at the doorway, he felt the walls until he found a switch. Sickly fluorescent light flooded the room, followed by a quiet moan. He whipped his head around and took in the room. It was large, with several doors, no windows, a desk and chair, and a small filing cabinet.
They met at a flat in Brooklyn. It was small but with gorgeous light and an exposed brick wall. When Billy showed up John’s brain supplied,
Sherlock held him tight and awkwardly walked him backwards to the nearest flat, comfortable space - his bed.
Shoreditch House was a warm, well-appointed private club that reminded him of a comfortable beach house but was huge and rambling. Every room was full of intimate spaces with comfortable looking lounge areas. There were several bars and a few rooms had intimate round tables where people were dining. The woman took him to a very small room with only a few couches and soft music playing. Two of the walls were floor to ceiling windows, making the room perfect for a photo shoot. He wondered if he would actually be modeling.
Sherlock held John tightly around the shoulders with his good arm, the other flung up above his head. His mouth was open, panting, and John’s face was at his neck licking from one freckle to the next.
“Mmmm,” John hummed. Sherlock didn’t know whether he believed him or not but if he tried to say anything more, he knew it would sound like he was lying. So he kept his mouth shut.
Sherlock is going to actually consume food at this dinner. Maybe not a whole portion, but he will eat. He orders the wine, but only after asking John what he thinks he will have. He says he wants to make sure it would pair well with his dish too.
He raised his hands up to John’s face, one thumb pressing into the dimple in his chin. He bent down to place a kiss there. “And this is devastating.”
He knew it was petty, but he couldn’t help feeling elated after they dispatched John’s wife to a dank cell in the highest security prison in America.
He looked at me, the edges of his eyes crinkling and something like a small smile cracked across his lips. I raised one eyebrow and stared back at him.
He walked John back and pushed him into sprawling on the large bed. John reached for him, but he evaded his love. He needed to get those swim pants off, and now. He roughly worked his fingers under the strained fabric of John’s pants and tugged hard. John’s abdomen buckled under the force and shock of it. His cock bounced up and slapped back onto his belly. Sherlock ripped the pants down John’s legs and off his feet, tossing them all the way to the other side of the small cottage.
It didn’t work. John wanted another kiss. He wanted more time. He was caught in a loop of desire, regret, anger, resignation, desire, regret, anger...he stared at the chalkboard for long moments, thoughts lost to time. After nine days of this foolish, adolescent, unbelievably infuriating behavior, John erased Sherlock’s message and made a conscious choice to move the fuck on.
Why would he be sad? I wondered if he was an emotional drinker. Family history said ‘maybe’. I did not like the direction this conversation was heading. I needed to make John happy and interested. I needed to make John stay.
It took six minutes of driving through London traffic to gain my breath and slow my heart beat. Damned my new friend, he was like no other.
John slipped from Sherlock’s bed, reluctantly moving Sherlock’s right hand from his hip. He had slept soundly for a few hours. When he woke, he listened to Sherlock’s soft, snoring breaths. A vigil for any signs of stress, or drug sickness, or general discomfort. The paramedics had told John that Sherlock denied any physical assault had occurred. John hoped it was true.
John pulled back, looked up at his face, and quietly said, “It’s very simple. I love you and I’m never going to leave you. Not even when you act like a jealous, viciously rude, ungrateful twat. Because most of the time, the way you love me takes my breath away, and I have to fucking pinch myself to make sure I’m not dreaming this life. With you.”
A cab pulled up but Sherlock didn’t move. His eyebrows drew together and he stared at John, looking confused and hurt.
Sherlock closed his eyes and hummed low in his throat, which John felt deliciously. He was not going to last. Sherlock pressed his cock firmly against John’s fuzzy shin. He could feel wetness helping his shaft rub along the soft skin over hard bone.
Sherlock did not disappoint and moved his body down to burrow his face in his pubic hair. As he nuzzled and groaned he rubbed his nose against John’s shaft. John’s focus was on Sherlock’s lips, willing him to take his cock into that perfect mouth, suckling the head between those perfect lips.
I stripped off my soiled garment and walked into the loo. I pulled on the shower handles and let the water run.
Sherlock shook his head, Victor just stared at them. Sherlock said, “They’ve been drugging us. I think he’s been here a week, maybe two. I just got here today...or yesterday.”
Somehow John made him want to be better. But he couldn’t do it. Because he was a sodding miserable arsehole who acted perpetually like a teenaged drama queen. He couldn’t help but shit all over everyone. Including his beloved John.
“I have no idea. I needed to think,” I hesitated, wondering if I should go on. I did, “So I went to one of my bolt holes. Time got away from me and I didn’t come home until this morning.” I could feel the heat rising from my neck to my cheeks. There was nothing for it so I looked down at my bare feet.
Slowly he made his way around the ambulance towards the back, open rear doors. Sherlock was mostly facing away from him, looking into the interior of the ambulance. His shoulders slightly hunched, his hair was frizzy and more voluminous that it usually was. He could only see the side of his face, one perfect cheekbone. He breathed, “Sherlock,” quietly. Sherlock did not hear him.
As he dragged John’s limp body across the room, he realized that his transport was lighting up at every point of contact between them. John’s chin and cheek resting against his chest. His nose and lips brushing grey-blonde hair as he looked down to make sure John was all right. John’s chest bumping along his stomach. Their knees thumping together as John tried to get his feet to work. He didn’t even want to think about the drag of John’s abdomen across his groin. He hoped with every molecule that John would not remember that particular humiliation.
Mission accomplished. After Sherlock’s orgasms, he was speechless and incoherent for several long moments. He laid there shivering although the room was warm. John doubted he remembered his name, or their address, or anything other than the sublime sensation of multiple orgasms via prostate stimulation resulting in a final, spectacular ejaculation, that had rocketed up to his neck. John was quite impressed by their performance, if he did say so himself.
He scowled and tugged at his curls. Mycroft was supposed to be stronger and smarter. Irritating and immortal.
“You’re in no position to do anything now, you stupid…” Victor trailed off and his lip quivered as he looked at his friend.
There’d been no edging. They were both so eager after so many days apart, that in the end, Sherlock stayed true to his word and provided so thorough a rimming that John almost came untouched. It only took a few strokes for him to moan loudly and come all over Sherlock’s hand. While John came down from his truly intense climax, Sherlock took himself in hand and bit down on John’s arse cheek, shuddering through his own orgasm.
That was the trouble with this position. Everyone’s mouth was busy so verbal communication stopped the action. “Good. I’ve got you. Keep going, and I’ll keep going.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows as John turned and said lowly, “Nice shirt.” He watched John’s arse as he walked away. Definitely intrigued.
After a long moment, he let go of John and covered him with the other side of his quilt. John snuggled into Sherlock's pillow with a satisfied moan. At the sound, Sherlock could feel his face flush. God, but he wanted John.
Sherlock desperately hoped it was true. From what he could deduce, John was cautiously accepting his apology with the grace that partners in long-term love affairs knew well.
John groaned, “Forget it, I’m sorry.” He reached for Sherlock’s hand, which lay limply on the bed next to him.
Sherlock continues to stare at John with a small, pleased, and entirely relaxed smile on those perfect lips.
As much as watching this exchange amused John, he desperately wanted to know where he could find Sherlock.
John listened while Jack told him all about growing up in Glasgow, riding motorbikes, following his older brother around learning how to be butch. He told him about learning how to draw and eventually paint. It hadn’t come easy but he had colors and pictures inside of him that he could only express on a canvas. He told him about living on his own when he had no family left. He taught drawing to willing young students at primary schools, and willing older patrons at a pub in the heart of the city. He was funny and brilliant and John was charmed. He wanted to kiss him again.
That was the moment that Sherlock gave up. He knew he wouldn’t be able to get his skates off without help. He had heard bone crack. Next stop would be A&E.
John rolled his eyes and muttered, “Just great.” How in Sherlock’s great big brain did it makes sense that John would want to help him with boyfriend problems? It made no sense.
“Ha! Oh my god, Sherlock,” he said as he watched him kick the tiny black pants over to where his shirt was wrinkled on the sand. Instinctively, John looked around but they were alone. “You a bit tipsy, sweetheart?” John himself still felt the buzz.
Sherlock stopped laughing and flipped them over so John was on his back and him hovering on all four limbs with his face over John’s groin. Sherlock cocked his head and stared at John’s soft penis. “It’s really a tiny little thing now, isn’t it?”
Sherlock marveled at this man who loved him. This man who considered his feelings. Who wanted to make him happy and feel good. John didn’t try to change him, even though they were now...this. He actually wanted Sherlock to be...more Sherlock.
John lifted his head, shifted his bite to Sherlock’s lower lip. Looking into Sherlock’s eyes, he pulled it into his mouth and sucked. Sherlock moaned lavishly.
John said, “I’m so glad.” He wanted to stare into those aquamarine eyes to see the light behind them, the clear reflection of his affection glowing from behind dark lashes. Sherlock seemed just as content to stare into John’s eyes.
He wondered if she’d looked at his photos. He must have hesitated because she said, “I saw your book, very nice.”
That night, as they laid in twin beds, side by side in the cramped room, neither said a word. All that could be heard in the room was the soft sounds of breathing. Each man tried to calm himself, navigating through the unfamiliar feeling of sharing a bedroom. Each man viscerally hated the one-meter space between them. It felt like a vast gulf, wider than the English Channel. Neither knew it was really a small brook, easily jumped, if either of them would simply try.
Lost in thought for the moment, I didn’t notice until it was too late that Hudders sipped her tea with a small smirk on her lips and a spark in her eyes.
John laid there with his eyes closed, humming on every exhale, rubbing his hand softly over Sherlock’s thigh. Sherlock had his head resting on John’s hip, smiling at his blissed out boyfriend.
I sighed. “As you heard this evening, I had somewhat of a...problem. For a while. With cocaine and heroin. Mostly.”
He asked her to marry him at a posh restaurant that he couldn’t afford. It was awkward, like they were playing at being adults. Mary, ever the atypical personality, stared at him for a long time with an inscrutable look on her face. She looked down at the petite gold band with the tiny diamond perched above it and smiled. When she looked back at John, grinning, she said, “Fucking hell, I can’t believe this but let’s get married.”
John pulled his head back a bit more forcefully, and moved his arms up to bracket Sherlock’s head. He wound his fingers into Sherlock’s soft curls and said, “I want to feel all of you.”
But Sherlock had seen it. Maybe others had seen it too, if they were paying attention. Sherlock had seen that these two men were very close, like brothers, with a deep love. But not like brothers because there was something like heat and fondness in their too-long gaze. They looked like two people very deeply in love. Romantic love. Sherlock hadn’t paid too much attention people in love. He thought it was mostly faked or just for the young and hormonal. And that young lust surely wasn’t real or deep love.
“Oi! You cock!” Victor grabbed at his wrists but he was too slow. Sherlock jumped up and away and ran to the loo, laughing maniacally like he only did with Victor.
Sherlock slumped over and buried his face into John’s neck, inhaling the scent of him. He floated blissfully in a gorgeous cocktail of hormones and John.
But when the handsome young bartender with dark skin and beautiful smile asked Sherlock if he wanted to try their special, he said yes. When their drinks arrived, Sherlock was delighted to find a fresh pink orchid adorning the rim.
Slowly, he made his way to the side of the bed, aware of his heart beating loudly in his ears. He reached for John’s bare foot. Gently he wrapped his both hands around his ankle. Warm. Under thin skin, he felt hard smooth bone with his long sensitive fingers. With light pressure he ran his hands upwards to John’s calf, feeling the soft hair fluff in the wrong direction as he made his way up to his knee. He lifted John’s leg up onto the bed and hesitated. He needed to let go of John’s knee.
Within two weeks, they had moved John’s things into 221B Baker Street. He’d sublet his apartment in New York, which was technically illegal, but the young photographer he let it to would never tell. Sherlock had made sure of that with a vaguely threatening, yet probably unnecessary, menacingly toothy smile.
John had two emotions almost simultaneously, incredulity and worry. He was dismayed to realize that worry was winning out. “Fuck,” he said aloud.
Hours later, Lestrade texted that they had found the friend and he was indeed a herpetologist. A few exasperated sighs and quick fingers over the screen and Sherlock had solved it.
John stood there, staring into Sherlock’s eyes sternly. He ran his hand over Sherlock’s forehead, pushing his fringe back, then trailed fingertips over the side of his face.
The first time they were each on their sides of the bed. John reached over to touch Sherlock’s torso. He had a habit of checking to see if he was breathing.
John looked down and didn’t know what to say. He didn’t know if he’d loved James. It felt like he had. He mourned the loss of him like he did. Sadness welled in his heart and he looked down. He had no desire to talk or think about James. He took a big gulp of wine and said, “Leave it to you to ask me about the one photo I don’t want to talk about.”
Their plan included John, James, and James’ unit traveling to the village where the General and the Operative grew up. The unit would administer medical care to the locals, while an elite group of men and women would surprise the General and Operative where they were hidden in a room above the grocer.
He exited a side door into a secluded alley, surrounded on three sides by windowless walls. He walked down the curved narrow road using his instincts and knowledge of central London to make his way towards the main roadway. He breathing came easier the closer he came to the busy street. And John.
John stood in the afternoon light, in front of the windows that looked down on Baker Street. He had his hands in his pockets, casually looking around, waiting for Sherlock’s attention probably. Attention, yes, that’s what he was going to get. His full, hard, complete attention.
Sherlock began to lay out the details, designing the actions to the best of his ability. His hands waved wildly in front of his face. He touched his lips and brow. He ran fingers rapidly through his curls, occasionally pulling when his words wouldn’t come. He took the salt, pepper, a napkin, and a spoon and moved them around the table, orchestrating the moves he thought they should make and the outcomes they would produce.
Later when they were back in the lounge and John was reading in his chair, Sherlock watched him from the couch. He marveled, again, at his husband. His body was compact - what a lovely word to describe a short man. He was still muscular. His handsome face maintained its boyishness despite him being in his late-forties. John was wearing those infuriatingly sexy glasses, and to top it off, his tongue was going rogue, making brief appearances outside of its appropriate place inside of his mouth. He licked his lips. He poked its tip out and wrinkled his brow, reacting to something surprising in the text.
John loved feeling the warm splash of Sherlock’s come on his skin, marking him. Evidence of pleasure. Of maleness. His knees were starting to hurt and he thought that even though it was morning, maybe he’d like to go back to bed and sleep for a while. No one had ever done what Sherlock had done for him and he just wanted to bask in the memory of it a little while longer.
John placed his phone, the food and drink on the bedside table, let the dressing gown drop to the carpet, and slipped back into bed. Sherlock stirred at John’s jostling. His eyelids fluttered open and stared blankly at the ceiling. John regulated his breath, slow and calm, allowing Sherlock to take the lead on how the morning would go. Sherlock turned to his side and looked at John. He looked exhausted, pale, and his eyes turned sad as his eyelids sank slowly. Still, in the mid-morning light, he was the most beautiful thing John had ever seen.
Then one evening, he was in Egypt following one of Moriarty’s clients who was the head of a kidnapping and sex slave operation. Another spider, not at the center of the web like Moriarty, but at the end of one thread. He was going to bring that fucker down if it was the last thing he did. His life was always in danger when he was away, but this particular spider was sneaky and smart. Sherlock lived in the shadows watching, trying to figure out the spider’s next move. He was not famous there. He could blend in and just watch. He sipped hot tea and watched a woman whom he thought was the spider’s next contact. She was physically beautiful, he supposed, but what she was doing – Selling people. Women.
Sherlock answered by lifting his head up to bring their lips together. They slid their tongues together with quick, repeated licks. John slowed the kiss, nipped on his upper lip, sucked his lower lip into his mouth and slowly licked it back and forth.
Sherlock held John’s face in his hands and placed a very soft kiss on his upper lip, then pulled back to catalog every beautiful feature in John’s expression. His half-lidded eyes, his relaxed forehead, his slackened jaw, and his barely parted lips curling up just slightly at each corner.
Sherlock rested his chin on his left shoulder, watching the slow motion of John’s hand and the spoon. They stayed that way for several minutes until John put down the spoon and turned off the burner. Neither of them moved.
Sherlock pulled out a cold bottle of champagne, two small meat pies, and a box of chocolate truffles. Sherlock opened the bottle and pulled out two tiny paper cups from the bag. He’d thought of everything and John’s heart burst with adoration for him. Sherlock poured the champagne and handed a cup to John, “Cheers.” He bumped John’s cup with his. They sipped.
John smiled a huge radiant grin, “No, we didn’t.” Sherlock frowned a bit, so John added, “But someday…” Sherlock’s face transformed immediately, his beautiful lips tugging up at the corners as his face burst into a blinding smile.
Of course. My ‘light doze’ ended up lengthier than I intended. By the smell of it, John was cooking the eggs already. Breakfast was imminent.
John was shaken that he seemed to still have so much faith in him. John knew they had failed him. They let him be taken. John held back a sob of relief. “I was so worried, Sherlock. I’m so sorry, love.”
“Sherlock, what? The fuck? Are you doing?” He sounded annoyed and slightly sleepy. Sherlock knew he wasn’t really angry.
He said, “I don’t see anything here that the doctor didn’t already tell us. He’s had a minor heart attack and is expected to make a full recovery. A beta-blocker, rest, stress reduction, a healthier diet, exercise, and he should be fine for years to come.”
John and Lestrade stopped short of the building entrance. It was the last known location of two officers, whose earpieces were clearly turned off. They hid behind some vegetation and a low retaining wall. The helicopter got closer, but started to land on a adjacent building. It was unclear if it was related to the operation they were currently trying to salvage.
John bent down to sit in the sand. Normally, he’d be taking lots more photos, but this afternoon wasn’t really like work. He just wanted to look at his love, feel the breeze in his hair, and the sand between his toes. He’d take a photo when the mood struck.
He remembered the moment perfectly. Looking down at John in that moment, he had felt dope sick, sweaty, and confused, but he’d also felt affection and curiosity and longing. Such longing for a man he’d only met an hour previous. He remembered thinking
He pulled back and moved both of his large hands to John’s shoulders. To John’s surprise, he was smiling. “Don’t be an idiot.”
Sherlock knew what she was doing. As she tried to find out if he had anyone close to him, anyone who would miss him, he tried to project an image of a detached, beautiful loner. It wasn’t difficult.
John said, “Sorry, nevermind. I’m sure you’re more than capable…” he trailed off. “Okay, let’s go, I’m sure I’ll get the best shot in the next thirty seconds.”
“I have my best people searching every corner, in and out, of that building. Let’s go get something to eat while we wait.”
John crawled over him, between Sherlock’s spread legs. He fluffed up the pillow underneath his head, “Comfortable?”
John shifted his weight and pulled out of Sherlock’s body. Sherlock adjusted to the emptiness quickly as John moved off of the bed to get them a flannel. Sherlock grabbed his arm and pulled him back down.
It was time. He wanted it. He hunched down just a bit more, effectively opening his throat. He took Sherlock slightly deeper, creating more suction each time Sherlock’s coronal ridge passed between his lips.
John reached down and grabbed the base of his cock and squeezed, dislodging Sherlock’s hand from its position. He closed his eyes and blew out a long breath. When he looked back down at Sherlock, he said, “You can’t say things like that. Jesus.” He smiled weakly.
John lifted his hands and ran them along Sherlock’s forearms to interlace their fingers together. He pulled Sherlock’s hands away so that he could twist and face him. Sherlock stayed close and they joined hands again. John looked up into the most exotically beautiful face he’d ever laid eyes on and said, “Sherlock…”
John pulled back but was still lightly holding his arm around Sherlock’s back, “You’re going to have to start believing in here,” John touched the end of his index finger to his chest, “that I love you and I’m not going anywhere until you say you don’t want me anymore.”
He composed himself after a few moments of silent staring and blinking. Blinking always helped to process impossible information. “Ha ha.”
When people first looked at John, no one, not a person, including himself, suspected that this studious-looking, patient, brave man was an absolute killer. He was devastating, he was surprising, he was hilarious. He was kind, he could be a sarcastic dick, he was passionate. He was incredibly gentle with Sherlock most of the time, except for those times when Sherlock needed to be commanded. He fucked Sherlock with authority one minute, then calmly read books in his chair. He was complex, nuanced, principled, and intelligent.
John bobbed up once, twisting his mouth and tongue to provide maximum suction. Then he slammed his face down, choking on Sherlock’s cock and held him there. His fingers pressed hard against his prostate and that was it.
“John, it would appear that you have discovered something about me that I did not know,” referring to whatever that was, it was a least a spectacular orgasm that rocked him somewhere deep.
John gave up trying to read the newspaper and leaned back to watch. Sherlock nodded his head to the silent beat. Every once in awhile, he'd turn to grab a cup or dish from the counter. John could see his profile then. His hair disarrayed, cheekbones high, lips together and slightly smiling.
She giggled and he was charmed. One thing about Mary, from that first moment, she’d always been able to read him.
he asked, as Sherlock drifted towards the bedroom. It was any normal person’s bedtime, but John knew something was wrong. He found Sherlock sitting on the bed shaking. John pulled and prodded him so that he could be undressed, then laid him down, slotting himself forward, chest to chest. He hugged him and ran his hand up and down his flanks, avoiding his scars.
The edges of Sherlock’s lips quirked slowly. John released their hands and put one behind Sherlock’s neck and reached up to softly lay his other along his jaw. He rubbed his thumb slowly along his bottom lip while Sherlock looked at him, hungry and half-lidded.
John’s hand moved up his body and out from the top of the duvet, probably to touch his face, or rub his eyes, or smooth his hair. Of course, Sherlock couldn’t see. He watched as John’s hips moved in minute thrusts as his back arched in a stretch. Sherlock heard him exhale and watched his body still.
She pulled her eyebrows down to scowl at him, disgusted. Good, John didn’t give a shit what she thought.
“Yes, fuck me. Just like that. Ah...you look so...you feel so…” mumbled John, apparently unable to finish at thought.
Sherlock almost forgot what he was supposed to be doing. He was going to happily come all over the rug with the taste of John on his tongue.
“I mean, you’re basically proportional for your height, lengthwise. So that’s not surprising, but your girth. It’s large, Sherlock.”
I cleared my throat. “That being said, you like crispy duck although you don’t order it often because of the cost. I recommend the singapore noodles...and we’re also in the mood for a bit of late night dim sum.”
John walked out of the room and was talking quietly with Billy when he heard heavy footsteps echoing off the cement walls. He looked up and saw Sherlock walking slowly towards them, cigarette dangling from his lips, eyes glued to his mobile screen, and fingers flying over the screen. He was wearing the long coat and boots he wore last time. His hair had grown out a bit framing his sharp cheekbones and dark eyelashes perfectly. John thought he was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen.
Sherlock blinked and stared at John’s face, but he could tell he wasn’t really seeing. It was getting a bit scary.
When the inspection was over, Sherlock lunged for John, grabbing at the back of his head and his arse again to pull him close into a searing kiss. He was hot, so hot. His chest heaved with loud breaths as his hands roamed all over John’s body. Their cocks rubbed along hip bones and lower abdomens, but when they came into contact, both of them gasped throwing their heads back in sync.
“I do.” John stepped closer and pulled him into a tight hug. After a very short (too short, Sherlock’s body asserted) moment, John pulled away and placed a kiss on his cheek. He stepped further away and cleared his throat. He looked unsure, maybe a bit sad. “I’m knackered. Where am I sleeping?” He tipped his head towards the sofa, questioning.
His breathing was rapidly becoming out of control. He realized he was panting and that not only was his head moving in small back and forth motions, but he had begun to undulate his whole body against John’s smaller frame. His hips moved in tiny uncontrollable thrusts and he hoped that John would understand.
They hadn’t discussed this. Dates. Why had he brought her home? Was that rude of him? I suspected not, as it was his home too now. Would she leave after their short tryst in the hallway? Or...I realized with growing dread that John’s intent may be to bring her upstairs. Bring her into his bedroom. Into his bed. My eyes went wide and my lips formed an “oh” that I could not repress even though no one was around to see it. I heard quick footsteps on the stairs, he hadn’t yet learned to avoid the tell-tale tenth one and it squeaked their arrival to the second flight. Damn. I whipped my head around to see John enter the living room, his date dragged behind him hastily by their entwined hands. He looked around until his eyes landed on me, looking flushed and distracted.
Sherlock whooshes out a loud breath that sounds like “Hah.” He leans forward and twists his hand so his fingertips can graze John’s wrist in return. “Girlfriend? No, not really my area.”
John’s hand moved down to grasp his own shaft. His small hand closed loosely around it, making it look even larger. He sighed with contentment, as if the confirmation of his intact physical form was deeply satisfying. Sherlock smiled at the humanness - the maleness - of the action.
“I do love you. I couldn’t really say clearly it before,” Sherlock chuckled. John laughed and kissed his temple. “I didn’t think I’d ever have a real friend, much less...what we have.” He looked up at John’s face and placed his hand along his jaw. “You are more important to me than anything, even the work.”
“Usually people are eager enough to meet with me that they stay awake. I can see that you are unique, Sherlock Holmes.”
“I know, but get down anyway while we find out what’s going on.” McGregor was clearly losing patience with this civilian. John had been there before, many times. He rolled his eyes and stayed down. Inaction was going to kill him before McGregor ever could.
John looked a bit embarrassed. “It’s like, now that we’re together, the creeps are coming out of the woodwork,” he said.
Sherlock’s whole head jerked up, lips parted. John recognized his blinking as part of his ‘you’ve surprised me’ look.
He picked up his violin and started playing. John looked up and smiled briefly, clearly recognizing the song. He went back to his soup. Sherlock sang, “I’m singin’ in the rain, just singin’ in the rain, what a glorious feeling, John’s happy again.”
