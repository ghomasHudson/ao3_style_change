In November when the episode airs, Tony and Nat are doing their weekly watch party, just the two of them, popcorn, and copious amounts of alcohol as they lounge on Tony’s luxurious couch in malibu. Tony hadn’t said it outright, but Nat knew he was more excited for this episode than most.
he is.
Steve presses another kiss to Tony’s temple. He never wants him to leave.
“That mouth of yours, tsk, tsk,” Tony snickers, and the sound of it makes everything okay again. Steve lets the taxi drive away when Tony pulls away and grabs confidently at Steve’s hand, “I love you too, Steve.”
“Not unless you’re offering.”
Every ounce of light heartedness that the comfort and warmth of the routine had pulled out of Steve is immediately snatched away like a goblin’s grubby gold. Steve immediately locks up.
It’s not until they’ve been standing there for several minutes that Tony realizes Steve’s hands are vaguely sticky.
It’s not the headache that’s getting to him, but he doesn’t know how to explain that without sounding like an immature teenager with an out-of-control crush. Presidential candidates do not sound like they have out-of-control crushes, let alone actually have them, so he fidgets with his tie even though it’s already perfect.
Thor (no last name, just thor- like zendaya or adele or bono but four times the size of the average celebrity and with the personality of an overgrown puppy) is known for being from old, old money. So old, that even his frivolous spending problems (emphasis on problem) hasn’t so much as made a dent into his cash. He’s known for investing in companies just as frivolously as he buys his yachts and purses and cars, but somehow he’s so inherently lucky that even though he invests in the companies the other sharks all but laugh off the air, he just about never loses money on an investment. Oh, and he’s also the notorious and very outspoken owner of an adult ‘play’ company that creates facilities with foam pits, trampolines, dodgeball, and rock walls for adults, a resounding success that Thor talks of excessively.
She effortlessly guides Steve out of her hotel room and into the empty hall. She shuts the door behind him, and he’s left standing in front of her room, an insomniac in the night. He works for a couple more hours until he crashes, still dressed on top of his fully made bed and surrounded by a flat, brisé fan of paperwork unfurled over his beige comforter.
“Oh yeah? I didn’t get the sense that this guy was one of us. Got the whole innocent, patriotic thing going on. He better at hiding it than me?”
“Huh? Sorry, distracted.”
She sneaks a peak at Tony out of the corner of her eye.
Steve can’t help but grin. He hopes desperately nobody comes out to follow him and demand a better speech.
There’s a special kind of heat that is felt when there’s that many cameras flashing at you, big, bright bulbs blinking your likeness into an immortal evidence. It feels kinda like the combined force of being struck by a warm lightning as well as the tepid, itchy feeling of somebody watching you from behind. Tony’s always hated the feeling of cameras flashing at him, but like a lot of other uncomfortable things, he’s become used to the feeling.
Sam sticks up his pinky, “Not a clue.”
Tony is uncharacteristically quiet. Steve imagines him sitting down somewhere, lets out a long breath, and eventually speaks. There’s a switch flicked on his end too, big and heavy and political like a tired, old wolf, a very convincing, charming facade. It feels a hell of a lot like the fourth brick wall that boxes Steve in.
Later, he’ll get a call. He’ll recognize the number and pick up despite the hour, conspicuously breathless.
“I mean, if you had your choice, you’d be getting lunch from that $2 hot dog stand over there and mingle among the natives and the tourists alike while you all got food poisoning together.”
Then Steve gets a call, and for a moment his heart lights up like Vegas on New Year’s.
“I don’t-“
Nat’s answering silence makes Steve feels like he itches all over. He tosses the button from one hand to the other and ignores her pointed glare.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says quickly, “It sounds like it’s a bad time. So sorry for bothering you, Mr Stark. I-“
Steve feels the unclampable urge to lean forward and kiss Tony Stark on the lips surge through him.
“Yes, that’s what I said. Is our connection bad?”
After entering the tri-state area airspace, he lands on top of his personal Stark Tower landing pad. There’s a news chopper hovering above the K in his name and a posse of angry protestors waiting for him outside of the lobby 100 floors below. Home sweet home, or something like that. He doesn’t intend to stay long anyway- Cali’s calling or whatever other hippie bullshit he wants to use to rationalize his return.
“Steve Rogers?” Tony gapes aloud, “Like the designer?”
When Steve looks up at him, he smiles.
Nat finds Steve in his hotel room, impeccably dressed and looking only the tiniest worse for the wear. She knocks at the open door and enters his room just as he’s fixing his tie. Her ever-present tablet is perched tauntingly in the crook of her elbow.
When she finishes reading off the detailed schedule, Nat pointedly clears her throat, “And that’s all for today. We’ll end the night at a hotel in Jersey. Got all that?”
Nat explains the itinerary. Strict, fast, precise. Steve nods along, taking a big bite of fruit as she hits noon in his upcoming day. The pear’s nearly gone by the time she tells him what time he’ll be going to bed tonight. Surprise, surprise: another long day.
“Hello, Mr Stark?” A voice says as the gentle polka of the hold music is abruptly cut off mid-phrase, “You there?”
“Oh. Yeah.”
The sharks are completely silent. Tony taps his pen against his notebook, and for a second there Steve thinks to himself
Tony’s sunbathing on the landing pad of his Malibu mansion, stretched out over a striped towel laid across a white lounge chair, sunglasses perforating a tan line around his temples as his phone blasts AC/DC from beneath his chair, when his phone rings.
She pulls out the chair across from him, folds one long leg over the other, and she looks at him meaningfully. Steve purposefully stares at the phone. That’s a lot of zeroes.
“See now, isn’t that better?”
“Of course, Senator Rogers,” Tony eventually says. He’s never used Steve’s title before. Steve’s called that all the time, but it suddenly sounds wrong, like bald tires on a gravel road, rolling hopelessly in the wrong direction, “Anytime. Good luck.”
Steve immediately starts in on his pre-programmed rant about how his presidency would allow the economy to thrive, but the man in the suit obviously isn’t listening. With his mouth full, he carelessly cuts Steve off, grabbing a glass from a passing tray and waving it in Steve’s direction, “I think it’s all bullshit. She totally just likes you because you look hot in a suit.”
He can still hear Sam and Bucky whispering behind them.
As often happens when half your campaign staff has the intelligence of world-changers and the drunken maturity of frat boys, a chant starts, faces turned expectantly in Steve’s direction. Sam and Bucky lead the charge, overly friendly arms wrapped around one another’s shoulders, champagne glasses emptied within a moment’s notice.
“Oh. Thanks.”
Steve has one hand curled around the cab door handle as he waits patiently. There’s a small part of him that will wait patiently for Tony Stark for the rest of his life, “I said I was sorry, you-“
A week later, the two are caught in public.
Beside Clint, billionaire Maria Hill has her hands in almost every money-making industry that exists in the modern world. From food, to real estate, to service, to tchotchke infomercial products, Maria does it all. She and her husband Nicky are best known for building their security company from the ground up, then selling it for billions of dollars. She would almost be as hardcore, furtive, and sharklike as Natasha with her steady, measuring stare if she didn’t have the propensity to laugh uproariously at frivolous products and snicker openly at the other sharks’ bad jokes. Usually when Maria laughs at your product, it means that Thor and Clint will begin a bidding war over your business soon after. A rumor floats through the halls that they do that because she neuro linguistically programmed them to do so- nobody’s quite sure whether or not that’s true.
Sam and Bucky turn to stare at Nat, incredulous.
“Why me?”
No armored, flying suits, no tuxes. Just the two of them at a restaurant that at least tries to be discreet. Less cameras, less paparazzi, less on-lookers. Well, no, that last one isn’t quite true. There’s probably even more nosy on-lookers than a pre-planned, well publicized event considering they’re on a date. But the point still stands.
“Oh, well in that case, he should be exonerated of all offenses, your honor. We have an innocent man here.”
“Oh, shush,” Tony smiles, “I know you like it, baby.”
“Thanks again.”
“Hey, Rogers. I was wondering- sorry it’s so late. I was wondering if you’d want to meet up again sometime?”
Steve’s needless silence is answer enough, smiling like an idiot up at the outdated lighting fixtures of the hotel bathroom.
The negative? Steve monumentally fucked absolutely everything up.
Steve waves earnestly behind himself as he exits from the shark tanks, large wooden doors snapping shut as he reenters the all-wood hallways covered in green screens and the backstage crew descends on him once again.
. These young volunteers really need to learn not to bother her after she’s gone to bed. She doesn’t need a whole lot of personal space, she’s adaptable, but fuck if some boundaries would be nice every once in awhile with these kids. Begrudgingly, she leaves her quote-unquote dinner on the bedside table and stalks across the room barefoot to answer the door, totally prepared to rip a new one into an overly-enthusiastic twenty-something.
As one, Nat, Sam, and Bucky relax into their regular selves.
“Did you? Hope you don’t mind.”
“You two,” She wheezes, “are going to be so disgusting- oh my god.”
“Tony.” Steve repeats, because it’s all he can get out really. It’s the only word on his mind. Tony seems to know that, gets that dastardly little grin of his.
“Should I- I don’t even know. Should I thank him? Call him?”
Steve seems surprised that Tony questions his presence at all, his mouth morphing into this tiny little ‘o’ shape, but then he’d been so quiet standing there that Tony had assumed he’d left.
- fine. Just one sec. Can I put you on hold? It’ll be quick. Promise. JARVIS cue boogie playlist for our guest, Kay?”
Tony must’ve had to travel all the way to Shitsville, Jersey to find him. Steve can’t imagine the trouble that would’ve been.
He’s Steve Rogers. A mere step away from the highest public office in the free world.
Nat shakes her head, wrinkles her nose playfully, “
Despite embracing said feelings, Steve doesn’t get in contact with Tony about them.
He forces himself to flip the switch and with every ounce of strength in his body trades out the easy ‘baseball-playing, friendly, beer-drinking neighbor’ grin for his bespoke political smile, even just smiling at a wall into a phone. He hates it, but Nat’s voice in his head reminds Steve how important Tony’s support is.
As Tony releases his grip on Steve’s collar, he sits himself neatly back into his seat, grinning. Steve’s brain appears to have stopped working, an amusing sight that Tony wants to make happen over and over and over again.
“You know we usually pay people to do that, right?”
It’s not until Tony walks onto the back deck and finds Steve fiddling with a powerwasher (commercial brand too, Tony notes to himself, not-at-all-bitter) that they truly reach a certain milestone of domesticity. It’s also notable to mention that Tony notices he does not mind one bit. Surprising, but… completely fine. Domestic Stark, huh. Who would’ve ever thought?
“You want to hear if the other sharks have offers,” Tony finishes for him, eyes burning into steve’s skin, “Don’t worry. I’ll wait.”
He reminds himself about the election. He hears Nat’s voice in his head telling him a million things about professionalism and saving face. Imaginary Nat scrolls through her tablet and reads off polling data to him. As enamored as he may be with Tony Stark, this guy’s still a donor, a supporter, a political entity. He can’t lose sight of that.
Steve backtracks instantly.
She sweeps away before either of them can respond.
“Yeah?” Tony sounds impatient.
Tony sits down opposite Steve without acknowledging either Dylan’s idolatry or Steve’s manners. Steve hurries to sit down too, and the tight, tufted leather makes an awkward creaking sound as he shuffles against it. Tony effortlessly sucks at the ice water on his side of the table.
Steve has a firm grip on a long shovel, which he shoves hard under the mound of mulch, pulls out a large pile, and dumps smoothly around the nearest flower bed.
With the pen victoriously in hand, Steve eventually clears his throat. He tries so hard to sound as offhand and casual as possible, Nat almost feels bad for him.
“I think we should meet up. Talk about some things.”
“You’re an idiot, Steve Rogers,” Tony says, and he kisses him again.
“Yeah, I just gotta grab something from my room,” Steve nods, and Nat takes long strides down the hallway, turns to leave, “Wait, hey, Nat?”
Nat shakes her head, “Go without me,” She insists, and Steve feels like he’s being backed into a corner with sticky mortar and porcelain bricks, “It’ll be fine.”
Tony rolls his eyes, as he always does, but pushes off the frame and closes the door behind him. He leans down next to Steve and watches him screw the hose into the back of the machine.
“He is mingling,” Tony insists, “With me.”
“Hey,” Tony says, voice soft, leaning against the frame of the open sliding glass door, “What’re you doing?”
Steve straightens his suit, smiles winningly. He’s starting to feel like a broken record.
“Alright. Whatever you say,” Tony half-jokes, backing himself into the tiny changing room built into the corner of the large fitting chambers. He throws the shower-curtain-like barrier closed with a flourish and slips back into his typical suit.
“Let me guess, you’re the type who wakes up at the asscrack of dawn and gets all energized and productive without even drinking coffee. I bet you go on a run every morning before the sun’s up and everything.”
Tony feels something warm bubble up into his stomach. Something like fondness (or maybe just hunger. He hasn’t eaten since dinner with Pepper last night before he buried himself in his workshop. He should probably get on that). He clears his throat.
“Tony.” Steve says so immediately it’s almost like the word was just waiting in his throat, ready to pounce. He almost instantly doesn’t feel nauseous anymore, “I mean, Mr stark, I would love to take your deal.”
He’s got one arm shoved into the wrong coat sleeve and his sunglasses pushed up into his hair, on the verge of falling right off his face. He left his coffee back at the table, forgotten in the moment and letting steam out into the bustling coffee shop.
.” She murmurs, “This is gonna suck.”
Steve immediately regrets it when Tony smiles again and Steve effectively melts, his brain useless. He misses being able to kiss that smile right off Tony’s face, misses feeling that smile against his bare stomach in the morning, misses looking out over the breakfast table to see that smile following him. Steve misses Tony.
“Oh, yeah? ‘Bout what?”
“I want to talk about the breakup. There’s some things we never really talked about. Publicity stuff, things like that. We need to tie a couple things up.”
“My team, uh, works hard to make sure I look the best at these things. It’s really not-“
“I met him in the lobby last night as he was leaving. I figured he came to talk to you.”
After that day, Nat watches Steve. Carefully. She reminds herself that it’s her job. She’s worried about him.
Almost completely formed around anonymous sources’ sourceless conjecture, Tony finds just about no truth in the article, but he spends an inordinate amount of time staring at the juxtaposition of pictures laid out for him before he pulls out his phone.
“Was there something on your hands?”
Natasha takes one look at him and
“But you do Steve. Pretending you don’t is making it a bigger problem than it has to be. And you know what? I’ve worked with you longer than almost anybody else, and you know what I want? I want you to be happy! Because that’s when you work best. When you’re happy, Steve, you kick ass. You get shit done. And that’s not even mentioning that I want you to be happy because I’m your actual friend. C’mon, Steve. What me, Sam, and Bucky really want is whatever’s best for you. I don’t want to hear any of this bullshit about using what you think I’d tell you to be some coward about telling Tony how you feel. Be honest with yourself, for Christ’s sake. Be happy.”
“Tony?” Steve demands as he picks up on the first ring. The way he snaps so immediately and aggressively is unintentional. His heart couldn’t stop beating the moment he read the caller ID. Tony misinterprets it as harsh, instantaneous disdain, “What do you want?”
Tony continues with that grin, “You deserve something a little fancier every once in awhile, Senator.”
“Sounds great, Steve,” Nat says, clamping down on an irritated yawn, “I’ll make sure everybody’s informed of the changes in the morning. Is there anything else?”
“You’re blushing, aren’t you?” He says, just to goad on his designer boyfriend (
Tony’s the only person in the world who can make Steve feel like he’s more normal than the leader of the free world. It’s a wonderful feeling.
“Call for Tony Stark.”
He holds his hands out like wilting leaves offered to the sun for one of the makeup artists to carefully paint his nails.
“Like… the designer?”
Steve barely even notices at first. Tony’s hand falls away, goes weak against the door and finds its way to Steve’s waist. There’s a bare slit of skin between the elastic of Steve’s ratty sweats and the tee shirt he sleeps in at night, and Tony’s thumb rubs slow circles against the sparse expanse of skin.
Steve slowly backs out of the bathroom.
“Steve?” Tony echoes. He sounds just as breathless as Steve feels. Tony looks around the room and cracks a smile, “I think they did it again.”
“Welp, thanks,” Tony says quickly as the large, glass doors of the building’s lobby come into view, “I’m looking forward to the big day.”
“Ooh, does Natty have a crush?” Tony butts his way back in. He bumps his shoulder amiably with Nat’s, “Want me to send a dozen roses to their hotel room?”
Steve shakes his head, “I’m afraid I’m not that great with names. Sorry,” He’s feeling bold, “But I’m sure I won’t forget you after this.”
“Can I help you with something, Nat?”
Tony’s eyes are closed blissfully, and he takes his time opening them. Steve’s a perfect picture of anxiety and fear. The soft edges that Tony had coaxed out roughen themselves back into the rigid outline of concentric rectangles that have been squared off as of late by the rigors of the campaign trail.
“Morning,” Tony says right back, tipping his mug amiably in his husbands direction, “What’re you up to?”
“You still there, Tony? Tony? Hey, Tony?”
“I’m cleaning the house, Tony. Now watch out. The directions said the water pressure on this thing is seriously dangerous.”
Tony laughs so hard he has to unravel his cloth napkin to cough into it. Steve watches Tony wipe his eyes with the corner of the black cloth, and finds himself unable to stop smiling. He missed this.
“Alright,” Tony says eventually, neatly folding up the relevant documents and clapping them gently against the tabletop. Tony smiles again and a million happy memories flood Steve’s mind. He wonders, briefly and self-deprecatingly, what it’s like in Tony’s mind at that moment too, probably bereft of longing, romantic, Steve-related daydreams that’s for sure, “I think that’s about everything.”
“What does this theme mean to you?”
“Oh be quiet, Barton. The adults are talking,” Tony chides, looking up from his legal pad to watch the way Steve bounces on the balls of his feet, “Steve, i wanna make you a deal.”
In one terrifying moment, Steve remembers tugging his suit jacket over his shoulders and being rushed out the back door of his hotel only a few hours before. Nat, with a clip board in her hand, briefs him on the most important people to schmooze that night.
“Mr Stark. Am I interrupting something?”
“Yikes, have fun with
He’s half distracted straightening his jacket sleeve when he swings open the door, and suddenly Bucky and Sam are practically falling into the tiny bathroom.
“I don’t think you get how much she hates paperwork.”
“Pep, I told you I’ve got this under control. You gotta stop-“
It’s 2am after another long day, and Nat has conceded that her empty stomach is going to have to be okay with an overpriced water bottle from the hotel mini fridge and a bag of nuts she had stashed in her purse after the last commercial flight she had taken. Nothing in this butthole-of-nowhere town is open at this hour, so it’ll just have to do. She collapses onto her bed, peanuts in one hand and the tv remote in the other, and she turns on the news before feeling herself drift toward sleep.
Steve hauls Tony up in his arms and carries his cursing husband into the house bridal style. It’s ridiculous.
Eventually Tony does find Steve. He follows the loud beeping to the front driveway and finds Steve directing a dumpster backing it’s way up the driveway. Steve guides the truck closer and closer to the house, waving his arms like an airway controller. Tony can hear the tinge of his Brooklyn accent emphasized when he calls out over the noise of the huffing truck to the driver, “
“Ohh,” The guy says, finally shoving the canapé into his mouth and swallowing the whole thing with one bite, “You’re that guy. Cool.”
Pepper drops the magazine on Tony’s desk with a smug expression, and he knows what’s coming before she even says a word. He kicks his feet up onto his desk and feigns innocence, “Hey, Pep,” He says slowly, “What’s that?”
Steve’s intake of breath is completely involuntary, an inhuman sort of surprise as he holds on tighter to Tony’s sleeves, refuses to let go.
“I’d say you should probably have a clue as to who I am,” Steve says, and yep, there’s the tinge of Brooklyn in his voice. Nat’s gonna kill him, “Considering this is my campaign event. In honor of me. To raise money for my campaign.”
Steve is left standing there alone, after midnight, the street quiet, and he stares up at the silhouette of Iron Man in the night sky and smiles to himself.
“I’m gonna let this go,” Steve says slowly, eyes narrowed and darting from one suspicious expression to another, “Because I have no idea what you guys are up to, and I don’t think I want to. We have a presidential campaign to win, and some Oregonians to visit. So I’m just gonna leave and pretend we never had this conversation, ‘kay?”
“Natasha!” Stark beams, opening his arms up like Daddy Warbucks on a sugar high, “Long time no see, baby!”
“Morning, sleepyhead.”
“Hi,” Steve says, channeling his carefully perfected presidentially apt character. He leans an elbow against the host’s cramped podium, “I have a reservation at 1 under the name Steve Rogers.”
“I don’t understand,” He moans, leaning as hard as he can against the spout of the darkest roast coffee, “How aren’t you hungover? You know, there’s a rumor in my family that my great-great-great grandma was a witch. You could be like her. Nat, are you my grandma? Are you a witch?”
“Thank you.”
“Yeah, this is Tony Stark. Who am I speaking to exactly?”
He’s not supposed to curse in front of donors.
At 12:58 p.m, Steve knocks anxiously at her hotel room door.
He finds himself thinking
Poor Bucky. He doesn’t even have the energy to flip her off.
It’s Steve’s first official day in the office: round, white, terrifying, overlooking this beastly enormous, green grass lawn. It’s hard to believe he’ll be coming here every day, talking to world leaders, American heroes, and trusted friends in the very room where great feats of history have transpired time and time again. He made it.
There’s that tell-tale flash of recognition in the young waiter’s expression, but he looks just as bored as before as he clicks at the touch screen behind the host stand. He grasps a pile of open faced leather bound menus and steps away from the podium.
They’re shielded against the crowd by a 2 foot recess between the busy sidewalk and the cool, silver plated side of the building.
In the long timeline that the two of them have worked together, Nat has said an entire encyclopedia of words and speeches to him backwards and forwards. She’s cursed at him like a trucker on steroids and carefully nursed his ego as if it was her very own newborn baby. She’s never said that.
Tony grins again, “You’ve never heard of Stark Industries?”
“Oh so now you care about people making gut decisions, Barton?”
His hands fidget with the heavy menu. He tells himself that the soupy feeling filling his stomach is just hunger. He hadn’t been allowed to eat any of the food at the pancake breakfast after all, and it had smelled so incredible. It’s just hunger. Seriously. His knee bounces up and down too.
It’s truly a miracle that he manages to get himself alone for five minutes to call Tony. Nowadays, it feels like there are campaign assistants (both male and female alike) following him into his bathroom and closet and bedroom, demanding him to sign on dotted lines or re-reminding him of important things that Steve usually remembers anyway. He’s pretty sure Nat had something to do with this unprecedented stroke of privacy. Even in the bathroom of his personal hotel room, he’s not used to absolute privacy in the middle of the morning. He counts himself lucky nonetheless and dials the number.
Steve’s vision blurred as Tony touched him
“He’ll like what he’ll like, Tony,” Steve muttered, lifting his arms I avoid the wires.
“But this is boring music,” Tony snarked. “This is the type of stuff you-“ he cut himself off.
Tony.
Tony groaned, his eyes fluttering.
kind of plan or logical thought process.
Tony closed his eyes and focused on the heavy splattering of the water on his body.  It was hot, a little too hot. It hurt, just a little bit. It was wonderful.
His mind still flashed Tony often, his eyes peering at Steve slightly and his mouth separated just enough for the tip of his tongue to swipe his bottom lip, but he could think of other things now, kind of.
“Sleep with me?” He asked softly.
If he was honest, Steve felt like an idiot. It seemed ever since he had woken up, alone, in his bed this morning with the sun shining through the window, casting a shadow on the empty side of the bed, that he’d been a different person. It had taken him longer than usual to make it to the kitchen, so much so Tony had beaten him, almost as if the thought of embracing that last night was over wasn’t something he wanted to do.
“You really think I could forget last night? Even drunk?” Tony whispered, laughing. “Not even an ungodly amount of alcohol could make me forget how good those fingers felt.”
Steve laughed loud. “Seems your efforts were wasted, he likes real music.”
Tony breathed, letting his own arm overlap with Steve’s. His body relaxed, and in minutes he was asleep, the booze officially taking over.
He could still see Steve, though. He could see his twisted face as he stared down at him, his eyes roaming the empty bottles around them. His lips strewn into a frown. Tony’s own lips quivered, and he had to close his eyes to prevent them from spilling.
“What?” Tony asked, obviously amused.
Peter seemed to love his classical, just like his father. Steve smiled wide at how furious Tony would be. Quickly, he stood and searched the crowd for his beloved husband.
It didn’t come.
quickly, just learned to appreciate.
Tony couldn’t remember a day in the last two weeks he hadn’t woken up feeling like utter shit, surrounded by empty bottles and vomit. He was still on the floor, being shone on by the heavy sun beating through the windows. He laid there until he found the strength to stand, wobbling and dizzy, before managing to find his way to the shower. He distracted himself with his projects until night fell and he was once again in silence, and he found the bottle again.
“Harder, that feels good,” Tony muttered, his shoulders relaxing against the edge of the tub. His head was practically out of the tub at this point, inches away from Steve’s chest.
His taunt stomach, just as Steve vividly remembered it from underneath his fingers that held the thin washcloth, was staring back at him. The muscles rippled as Tony laughed, causing Steve’s own stomach to settle uncomfortably.
Steve shifted, suddenly aware how close Tony really was. His body was just slightly pressed against his, the heat radiating off him.
Steve carried Tony toward the bathroom, careful to avoid hitting his head on doorframes. He readily ignored the bubbly gurgles and hums Tony occasionally made, directed at him or not.
Tony’s lips met Steve’s nape, and Steve just about melted to the floor. They were smooth, but harsh, trailing up to Steve’s jaw slowly. Steve tipped his head, leaning back slightly. As his lips met his earlobe, nibbling softly, Tony whispered.
Gently rubbing Tony’s neck, Steve lowered to Tony’s taunt stomach, pressing harder to remove the dried sweat lining from his shirts. Tony breathed softly, licking his lips.
He didn’t expect a gurgle from Peter. Tony stilled, eyes widening in shock. Steve’s stomach dropped at Tony’s slow grin.
“Yes, but you’re drunk now,” Steve argued, “and if we were to ever do something like that- not that I’m saying we would- it wouldn’t be when you’re drunk.”
“You tryna get me into bed, Rogers?” Tony joked, his voice thick. It was light, but Steve knew Tony was anything but happy tonight.
It was him last night, sitting calmly in the bath, eyes closed, lips slightly ajar as Steve lathered his fingers through Tony’s thick hair, massaging his soft skin. A groan escaped Tony’s lips, and his glistening chest heaved from sweat and water, the slight glow of his arc reactor casting a light upon Steve’s face, that was inches away from Tony’s hair, smelling strongly of wonderful Irish springs and ash and metal from his shop.  His skin was hot in the cool bath water, heated against Steve’s arms and hands that rested on his body.
Steve scrunched his nose.
Steve grabbed a towel and wrapped the thick cloth against his arms, working his way across and down until he was rubbing Tony’s stomach.
Steve leaned over and pulled the plug, the drain gurgling up the now chilling water. Steve stood and helped Tony stagger out of the tub, his body still heavy against his.
It became routine. Whenever he was able to - rather whenever Steve permitted it - Tony hooked up the headphones and played rock music for the baby. Steve thought it was faintly ridiculous.
Tony couldn’t tell if the hot trail running down his cheek was sweat or tears, and he didn’t care. His hand managed to find another bottle, narrowly avoiding the broke glass littered around him, and he groped it tightly. With a sigh, he scrunched his eyes and took a long swig, choking on it. His head burnt in pain, his stomach threatening to explode violently. Tony barely registered leaning over and emptying his stomach all over the floor and himself, before taking another drink.
“Your accent,” Tony joked, taking a long sip from his, presumably very hot, coffee. “You know, the whole Brooklyn thing.”
Now, though, all Steve could see as he passed another building was Tony’s face etched into his memory.
Slowly though, he focused on the vibrations, and realized what it was. Steve couldn’t stop his short laugh from bubbling out, making Tony jump.
He was laughing, lying on the floor. He was wearing the same outfit as before he had left, but his hair was kept, slightly, now and his shirt had rode up during his fall.
Tony hummed as Steve lost himself, closing his eyes and throwing his head as he let out a groan as pleasure tingled up his legs and hit his stomach with a blast. His mouth was escaping small sounds as Tony’s mouth finished him and left him, Tony giving a gentle kiss to the tip.
It was honey to his ears. For only a moment, Tony’s chest felt light at the sound of Steve. But it vanished so quickly, and replaced itself with a crushing heaviness. Blackness threatened his consciousness, and Tony allowed himself to slip, if only to escape Steve’s stare.
“Could you ever love me?”
“You know I can’t be held accountable for my actions, Cap,” Tony threw over a shoulder. The same shoulder Steve had so delicately washed and dried, strong and muscled and perfect-
Weeks later, Tony threw an extravagant Christmas party, as per usual. Guests littered the tower, drinks were served, and foods Steve had never even heard of - could much less pronounce - were being served.
“Like what you see?” Tony lightly swayed his butt, laughing softly. Steve stayed silent, rolling his eyes, and lifted Tony to his shoulder.
Steve moved Tony’s hands away from his chest, that were tucked under his armpits to hug himself. Tony protested, but was ignored. Steve carefully unbuttoned Tony’s shirt, revealing his bare chest. Steve had seen it plenty of times, yet his cheeks flushed none the less. His eyes rested briefly on the slightly glowing arc reactor, then he removed them.
Steve made it quick, and burst through his door, tightening his muscles for the sudden hit or blast, or a loud sound.
He was gurgling and smiling, his tongue poking out, wiggling to the sound.
It was no use. As the song played, his son, whom the pair had decided would be named Peter, kicked and stretched throughout the song. It wasn’t painful, rather like Peter was tapping his own way through the melody.
As he stood, his body yearned to feel Tony’s roughly calloused hands against his again, and the heat of his skin against his own. But he continued walking toward the door, giving a quiet ask for Jarvis to inform him when Tony woke.
After a brief period of consideration, Steve decided to strip Tony to his underwear, and the time it’d take to make Tony stay in his bed after would dry them, anyway.
“Yes.”
Steve’s neck got heated again as he gently, quickly, brushed the towel over his underwear, drying it enough to keep it from dripping. Steve’s chest leaped at Tony’s quick breath, but no appearance was made, thankfully.
“I love you.”
Tony paused for a while, and Steve waited.
Tony let out a breath as Steve’s hand embraced him, moving slowly and steadily to form a rhythm. Tony arched his back, begging Steve to use his mouth. Steve licked his lips, swollen from Tony’s lips against his, and bent his head to meet the tip.
Obviously, it was. The pair watched as every news station either congratulated them or spun a story of them quitting their jobs as heros, or the dangerous fate of their baby. Steve grew tired of it, and switched the channel to a random movie playing.
Also here’s the part two I (sort of?) promised. Again, I’m not sure if it’s on par compared to the first one but it’ll haVE TO DO BECAUSE IT’S MIDNIGHT AND IM TIRED.
“Not, like, fucking,” Tony mumbled, “just sleep here, with me. Because I’m lonely.”
A minute passed and Steve couldn’t form an answer, not from lack of having one, but he wasn’t sure how to say it.
As if to prove his point, the song ended and the music paused. Tony frowned as Peter stilled, and then his eyes widened at his dance as the next song played.
He must have stayed for at least an hour, listening to Tony sleep, before he carefully removed himself from the tangle of Tony. He watched him, seeing if he’d stir as Steve moved out of bed, but he didn’t.
“What’s this about, Tony?” Steve asked tentively. Tony wasn’t one to get like this every night, but it happened often enough that Steve knew something was plaguing his mind if he got himself here.
The bathroom was unreasonably huge, per Tony’s unusual sense of style, so Steve had no trouble fitting themselves in. He set Tony down on the toilet, lid closed, so he could check the water.
“You really don’t have enough faith in me, Rogers,” Tony drawled behind him.
Steve couldn’t believe it. The man was lying in a heap on the floor of his work room, mewling to himself softly. Dirty glasses with mouth stains scattered the area, empty bottles of liquor surrounding the table above his body. The floor was grimed and sticky from spilled alcohol, inches away from Tony’s half-lidded eyes.
“Next time?”
Steve’s throat tightened, unable to speak words.
He was glad no one was around to see how tight his pants were.
Pouring the strong-smelling blue liquid into his palm, Steve rubbed them together, creating a bubbly mix. Carefully, he ran his hands through Tony’s surprisingly thick hair, his fingers gripping softly.
“What are you doing on my floor?” Steve asked, suddenly concerned what hijinks Tony was playing with. He’d been the subject of a few, admittingly good, but annoying, pranks through the years.
Tony felt incredibly dizzy. His head was pounding, but he couldn’t tell if it was from the alcohol or every thought running rapid in his mind. He’d drank until his face was fuzzy and he couldn’t stand, yet his brain buzzed with activity, yelling everything at him at once.
Tony’s mouth was hot and sweet shading Steve, trailing quick kisses as he pulled the elastic of his waistband down and gave him what he needed. Steve pulled tufts of Tony’s hair, the familiar feeling sending waves through him as Tony’s lips stretched around Steve and his head ducked to envelop him further.
Reluctantly, Tony gave up. It seemed alter had no interest in rock, or anything other than classical really. So instead, he hooked up the headphones and played classicals greatest hits.
Steve was amused, and also completely sweet, as he felt his little baby dancing to the song. As it finished, Peter grew still. Steve grinned and laughed softly to himself, still stroking his belly. As the next song began, Peter resumed his dance.
He wondered if Tony was still wearing the black underwear from last night.
“Mhm.”
“I’m trying to get you in the bath, so move your arm so I can get your shirt off.”
“Going for a run,” Steve muttered, thankful his exercise clothes had been closest to the bed when he woke up.  More confident, he added, “don’t destroy this place, please.”
Steve shook his head and watched, both amused and annoyed, at his husband. That was nothing new.
Steve opened his eyes again, breathing heavily. His chest was pounding, his ears thumping. He was leaning against a tree, on the edge of a street somewhere slightly outside of New York. He had ran so fast without realizing he had reached the edge of the city.
Steve knew Tony was still drunk if he was admitting this. Steve swallowed, considering the implications if he entered this bed and basically cuddled with Tony Stark, and decided he didn’t care right now.
Steve’s body was always on high alert, thanks to the serum, and his fatherly instincts already at full force. So when it detected the nice warmth of his blanket leaving, Steve gently arose from his sleep. He peeked his eyes, still groggy. There was Tony, admiring him sweetfully.
casually. “Might wanna check your room, though.”
A soft hum seemed to come from the general direction of Tony in response. Steve breathed slowly, his chest starting to burn in frustration, and calmed himself. He couldn’t stand Tony on a bad day, and couldn’t bare being around him when he was drunk and half-conscious. But, as always, no one was around to make sure Tony was well and accounted for in his bed, so Steve took it upon himself to keep Tony’s wearabouts known, including when it was here.
Steve flushed, his neck burning. Tony laughed loudly. He quite enjoyed making Steve blush in public.
Carefully, he inserted Tony into the warm water, earning a loud, relieved sigh from him. Tony relaxed into the feeling, submerging himself until only his head was above water.
Steve’s face was hot. He knew Tony had always favoured him a little more than normal, but he wasn’t anticipating him to ever admit it. But maybe it was the booze talking.
Steve eruptly stood, knocking his spoon slightly, making Tony jump. He had been silent as Steve thought, which was unusual.
Tony felt his chest tighten, and his eyes prickle. He felt stupid for expecting anything other than that, but it still stung his heart. Steve bit his lip, and reached out slowly.
Tony hummed, closing his eyes and relaxing his body.
“Why? What did I say?” Tony paused, his coffee mug,
“Hello, pumpkin,” Tony said cheerily.
Tony’s eyes didn’t leave Steve’s. A small smile curved on Tony’s lips. “I knew you were a softy for me all along, Cap.”
Something about how red they were, how empty and tired they seemed compared to a few minutes ago, made Steve’s blood cold.
Which was good, because he needed to forget about Tony, and last night. For the team, for their friendship.
“No, Tony,” Steve sighed, scrunching his nose. The smell of alcohol was strong in the room, it reeked off Tony. “You aren’t sleeping on the floor.”
Tony made a distant noise of protest as Steve rolled him slightly toward his chest, wrapping his arms around Tony’s chest and legs until Tony was safely entangled in his embrace.
Steve settled Tony in the bed with little resistance, splaying his body in the warm comfort of the bed away from the bathroom Steve could never forget now. Tony grumbled something into the pillow, seemingly positive. Steve gripped the blanket and reached to pull it up, but was met with Tony’s hand grabbing for his wrist.
Tomy was silent for a few seconds. He turned and leaned against the smooth wooden counter, crossing his foot slightly over the other. Steve looked up briefly at the noise, and landed upon the tight space in Tony’s crotch the crossing had created in his jeans. Steve’s neck flared.
Steve grinned.
”Help me up, yeah?” Tony asked, huffing.
“Jesus, Steve, you scared me,” Tony remarked, seemingly casually. Steve could see the bits of red shading the man’s cheeks at being caught, though.
Usually when he ran, his mind reeled with plans: team plans, meal plans, day plans,
“You’re forcing our baby to listen to AC/DC?” Steve joked, grinning.
Steve reached over the pull the drain, brushing his arm against Tony’s, and paused. It was trembling slightly. Steve leaned back and frowned, looking at Tony.
Tony’s breath hitched as Steve gently stroked Tony’s greasy hair out of his forehead.
Tony seemed to find his voice as the last button was removed form it’s tie and Steve pulled away the top.
“You’re drunk,” he muttered, folding the cloth and setting it on the edge of the tub.
Tony’s bedroom looked relatively unused, probably because it was. The bed was large, with soft, red satin sheets and a ridiculously fluffy mattress. The room was carpeted, warming both of their feet.
Steve patted his stomach as he song switched to a Christmas rock-cover, and Peter stilled. Tony pouted for the rest of the night.
“Steve?”
“Such as?” Steve asked. He didn’t know Pepper well, but from what he knew she was a nice lady.
Tony breathed in sharply.
Tony stayed silent, closing his eyes and breathing out. Steve could tell he still wasn’t sober, albeit less drunk than before, but still wasn’t thinking like they normally would.
The weeks passed, and soon Steve’s belly grew huge. He wobbled whenever he walked, and was on a strict no-jeans wardrobe. It was only a matter of time before Steve held Peter in his arms, exhausted but blissfully happy. Tony was by his side, joyful tears in his eyes as he stared at his husband and newborn child.
Steve’s breath quickened. His heart was pounding in his chest, aching for Tony to touch him anywhere.
The pair laid for a while, silently, just breathing and feeling each other’s heat.
Steve quickly realized it was Tony’s bedroom design, minus the lights.
Steve carefully crawled into the large bed, sinking into the soft comfort. He sighed, and gently wrapped an arm around Tony’s waist, pulling his back toward his own stomach.
Tony looked up at Steve, horrified. “What the hell?” He whined.
Steve melted to his knees, knocking Tony to his back. He wasted no time, feeling Tony hard and aching against his palm.
Steve was practically jogging to his room before Tony could finish his sentence, bracing himself for some kind of explosion.
Steve looked up at Tony, confused. “What?”
“I guess as a dad I have to make him happy,” Tony mumbled. Steve could only be amused.
“Pete’s so cute,” Tony murmured. “You are too, in that shirt,” Tony winked.
Tony hated himself right now. Maybe for a long time. Tony didn’t want to feel the feeling, the one he’d kept hidden for years. The yearning. The ache. The want. The absolute need to feel Steve Rogers touch.
Tucking it to his chin, oddly cold for a body that never did get cool inside, Steve closed his eyes, and wondered if Tony would remember any of this tomorrow.
“Thanks, I guess,” Steve rolled his eyes. His legs were aching to escape the situation, and to head towards the door so he could go for a long, hard run to sweat this off. He was a modest man, and this was a small bump in the road, nothing he couldn’t get over.
Steve rolled his eyes. Tony had taken to pet names recently, if only to annoy Steve. Honestly, he found it rather sweet.
“Tony-“
Tony huffed and inched his arm away, freeing the shirt of his body. Steve moved on to his pants, quickly unbuttoning the two buttons and unzipping. Tony seemed to understand, and thankfully stayed silent as he wiggled his legs to slide off the jeans.
Steve made his way to the elevator, excited to take a shower and wash off the thick layer of sweat accumulated on his body, and maybe do some work to forget about Tony.
Steve’s mouth went numb. He blinked, surprised at the question. It wasn’t what he was expecting at all. Tony still wasn’t looking at him.
It wasn’t that Steve hadn’t
“I missed your accent.”
Steve didn’t have to guess hard to figure out why he didn’t want to go lower. He swallowed, and removed his hand, ignoring the small whine from Tony.
The night was young still, but Steve already grew tired. He was 25 weeks now, and his baby was growing. When he had first kicked, only 3 weeks ago, him and Tony had celebrated the achievement. Ever since, Tony had been amping the rock, with the confirmation his son was in fact aware. Nothing had come from it, which Steve expected. This was another thing Tony would grow out of, he was sure.
Tony cried.
Steve was sitting there. Staring at him. His face was blank, his eyes searching Tony’s. The silence was deafening. Tony opened his mouth and talked for the first time in a  while.
His stomach dropped to his feet, and his mouth, embarrassingly, let out a small squeak.
Steve carefully stepped around the strewn glass cups littering Tony’s area, particularly the shot glasses carefully settled on their side, ready to roll away at the slightest touch.
“Nothin’,” Tony said casually, much
“Definitely.”
“Alright, I’ll get you to bed,” Steve said, more to himself than anything. “Can you walk?”
Steve reached down quickly, grabbing Tony’s, warm, hand and pulling him up to his feet. Tony adjusted his shirt, hiding his stomach, and flipped his hair away from his eyes. It was getting longer again.
If Steve had said he wasn’t disappointed, well, he would be lying.
Tony was left in his plain black underwear, tightly fitted to his body. Steve couldn’t stop his neck from going red: it certainly left nothing to the imagination.
Steve wasn’t sure what he wanted. It seemed a blessing Tony didn’t remember what the pair had done last night, between the oddly sensual cuddling and Tony getting hard from his touch. But Steve’s chest hadn’t untightened since he’d laid his eyes on Tony, making the first cup of his routine morning coffee.
No sooner had Steve began tapping his foot to the rhythm did he feel a hard kick to his stomach. He jumped, smiling embarrassingly to the patrons who stared, and steadied himself. He rubbed his stomach gently, attempting to sooth his son.
/////
Maybe getting over last night would be easier than he had thought.
Steve did get cold often recently. Be it pregnancy symptoms or that winter was hitting New York full force, he always felt a prickle of chill following him lately. Donned in his favourite sweats (a size bigger already, to his dismay), and a nice warm sweater, he was napping peacefully. Tony always was careful to keep the noise down as he did, never too far from Steve since Steve broke the news he was carrying his baby. Most days, Tony fiddled in his lap, keeping the camera screen of Steve’s room on nearby (“for safety purposes, Steve,”) and waited for him to wake up.
, yes,” Steve gasped, quickly turning around and slamming Tony to the wall behind them. Their lips found each other, kissing with an intense need that had suddenly risen between them.
“Mm?” Tony hummed, seemingly focused on Peter.
“Do you think you could fall in love with me?” Tony finished. Steve’s mouth opened, but no sound came out. He was confused, very. He didn’t know if this was the booze talking, or if the booze was giving him the true confidence he apparently lacked without it.
Steve almost jumped when he felt the vibrations against his skin. Quickly, he regained his composure. A rhythm was playing against his stomach, through the headphones. It was - music?
After drying his body, kneading the water droplets off carefully, he gently took Tony’s head into the towel and shook it slightly. Tony grunted in protest, already dizzy enough, earning a quiet laugh from Steve.
Steve wakes up the next morning, and finds that Tony seems to have no memory of the previous night. Obviously, he wallows in what could have been, and just as he’s deciding this was for the best, Tony surprises him.
The streets were a blur around him, the people were faceless, his feet were pounding on the pavement, and all Steve could think about was Tony.
The alcohol burned his throat on its way down, foaming in the glass cup that was glued to Tony’s right hand. It was empty again. Tony fumbled around, too tired to open his sore, red eyes, for the bottle. He winced as his arm sent the bottle flying onto the sticky floor around him, shattering loudly. He groaned and leaned his head against the front of his desk. It was cold against his feverish skin, sweating with the effort of staying awake and perspiration from the drinks takings it’s toll.
A hard body collided with his, sending the other sprawling to the floor.
Tony couldn’t stop the thoughts. He was in the shower, laying down. The water was spraying his face harshly, his back hurting from the hard bottom of the tub. He could hear his heavy breathing, his chesty coughing. He felt absolutely sick. He knew he had overdone it this time, and he needed help. He wouldn’t die - he didn’t think so, anyway. Did he want to die? He wasn’t sure. All he knew was the thoughts weren’t stopping.
A pity. Steve wanted to smash him through a wall.
"Hey babe," Tony smiled, rubbing his eyes open. The first thing he noticed was the well-tailored fit of Steve's slacks. "You guys get back already?" The team, minus Tony, had all gone together to one of those Christmas markets to buy a tree and some new decorations for the tower. Steve had insisted, not impressed by Tony's previous plan to hire an interior decorator. It was a family tradition, Steve explained, and who was Tony to stop him? Tony had simply asked to be left out of it.
"You left,"came Ironman's unrestrained anger, unlike Tony. "You care about me, but how much?" He left all his other questions on the tip of their tongue (Doom was going to savor this, surely). He was aware Tony had been angry, except he also kissed Steve? He kissed Steve tenderly, and Ironman had been ashamed of himself. He never meant to kiss Steve like that. He never meant to keep going, to, to--he had no words. No explanation for his actions.
The drink was harder to put back down having started right back up again. Except, instead of singing horribly in the street, he hummed tunes in the lap of his armor, hiding safely away inside the workshop.
“You must be sick if you think I can’t handle the word sex,” Steve said bluntly.
Steve's arms then ensnared him, both their cheeks pressed together, Ironman refusing to lift the faceplate back on over his head. He blasted down through the cobblestone using a repulsor because, hey, that was half the damn fun, wasn't it? It wasn't like they were flying far, only to the spot where Ironman had placed the others. He was pleased to see several of them had already started waking up. He'd call for proper transport and medical, just in case. These people would need assistance.
Maybe Steve was right. Maybe this would hurt more. Ironman hoped it was worth it.
He sighed. "It's true, Tony. You're mine. You must realize that by now. No matter what you may think, or believe. No matter what ends up happening, you're mine. You've always been mine."
“Tony,” He mouthed, his voice drowned out by the crowd.
"Yes," Ironman said skeptically. "I'm aware."
“Always a pleasure, Ms. Potts.” He was able to smirk, waving her off.
Except he definitely didn’t smell any rosemary, and that was one herb hard to miss.
That was a lie. Ironman felt pity for him and plenty more. The great tangled web that was Ironman and Tony's connection didn't end at Tony's continual suffering. They shared it all together. They shared their hopes and dreams, and they shared their love. Love that was often never cherished or freely and openly given. Loving Steve Rogers was ... bittersweet. "I don't want you to do anything besides give me your hands." He sighed.
"Doom," Tony finally acknowledged, "Interesting setup you've got here. I'm assuming here is, of course, your personal headquarters? It must be, what with the Frankenstein contraptions, and--oh. That beautiful piece of mastery you've transformed into the robotic equivalent of a cheap CGI'd special effect from the early nineties."
"I got you the last batch of Sam's cookies before anyone had realized looking."
"Funny," Ironman bit out, beginning to pace across the surprisingly large space and pinching the bridge of his nose. "You don't have that right, Rogers. And if I get my way you'll never get that right," he let slip aloud. Argh, damnit! Luckily Steve hardly seemed to notice his little slip of tongue, choosing to keep pouting.
Of course, once Tony had his hands on both of his said new toys, he opted to tear off a few of the evergreen's branches just to set them on fire with his torch, only to regret it after the whole lab was starting to smell. Yet it was still cathartic, releasing all that anger. All of his anguish and sorrow. By the second branch, however, he felt bad, remembering his mother and Ana--Ana's candles lit aflame each day of December till the New Year. Thus, he changed his mind and had Steve help make a couple of candle holders out of his scrapped armor parts and thought it was better to let the rest of the team have this tree to decorate too. (It could be the scapegoat tree that Hulk and Thor got to destroy later, because God, that was only a matter of time.)
"Indeed," Doom agreed. "Doom often enjoys mixing the formidable knowledge of science and sorcery together." Uh-huh. "This is how Doom has made time-travel achievable." Okay. Sure.
"I'm sorry, Tony--"
“Come on, Stevee~. You practically owe me at this point, and if you think you’re dat--Omph!”
“That makes me feel so much better,” Then Steve was sitting down next to him, removing the bottle from Tony’s grasp. “I spent months on the brink of death with an infected wound and a punctured lung hoping you all were alright. Turns out it was going to be okay. Fisk and Roxxon got what they deserved, and you.” Steve breathed deeply, “Well, and you came out of it unharmed, toting a giant medieval battle machine over there.”
Doom was curt, "Yes. It's exactly as I say, Iron Man." He put particular emphasis on Iron Man. "We were burdened with brilliance create the impossible. Doom strives to achieve what is beyond humanity’s simple-minded concept of the future. Are we not alike in this way?" he challenged.
vested in me, you will pretend to be my dumb, serum-enhanced boyfriend. Oh, I mean that by the way. Power invested, okay. Get it?" Then he lowered his voice barely enough for Steve to hear, "Power invested because it's in me--"
"Steve, I'm gonna stand on it." He tapped the back of his hand against Steve's chest. No muscle definition under all that armor here, boys. It made Tony kinda sad.
"Right," Steve said very slowly, already expecting the nitty-gritty details of Ironman's plan. Faintly, Ironman could hear his stomach gurgle, leaving him  suddenly feeling guilty that he didn't snag an appetizer tray or wait for any dinner Doom might have been interested in offering. Ironman tried not to shiver, and suddenly Steve was latching onto him like an octopus. "Come on, let's get under the blankets," Steve suggested.
It made Tony feel so warm inside.
“If I thought you liked me back I would’ve cornered you months ago!” Tony blurted, the adrenaline making his fingers tingle. “By what I mean, is, uh. I have a massively huge crush on you, but you’re you. So, I just accepted being your friend-slash-rival was all there was. Which-- which, you know,” he was stammering now, “is fine. I love being your friend-slash-rival! Nothing wrong with it, honestly! I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.”
Scars marred Steve’s face, and his hair seemed a few inches shorter than Tony had remembered.
“Come on.” Steve helped him up, “I’ve dreamt about holding you in my arms long enough. I’ll get us some water and we can figure it out in the morning.”
He trailed his hand down to Tony's neck, past his chest till he was at Tony's waist, fingers ghosting over the hem of Tony's shirt. Tony was so firm, lithe but muscular. He'd fantasied about scratching his nails down Tony's chest far too many times, even before the climax of the war ever went down. He dreamed of leaving red marks as Tony squirmed and panted, tied down and contorted in a position to Steve's exact liking.
"Like lab rats." Tony's distaste could be heard in his own voice. "Might've been dark but he's already gotten what he wanted. I think he allowed you to stay was because he hoped I'd show how the armor worked." Then he wrinkled his nose in disgust, "He's got footage of us kissing."
Pepper merely sighed. “We’re all very proud of you Tony. This life isn’t a cheerful, you can't argue I don’t I know it. Timely likes keeping it's misery in reserve, but it’s too been striving to do better and so have you.”
"Did you now? For little old me?" He tried looking around, but Steve took hold of his chin, holding him still.
"No," Steve set his jaw, looking determined as ever. "I know I fucked up, Tony. I know I did. This isn't about the Accords or Ross, or whoever the fuck else! You were doing the right thing, and I was doing the right thing. I--I never told you about the bunker because I didn't want you risking Ross' wrath. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I was an ass about it. But you came. Because that's what you do. Because that's who you are, Tony. And I--I never told you about Howard and your mother because I," his gaze swept back to the floor, "because I was a coward. It hurt. It hurt so much knowing. Howard was my friend, and I-- everyone I've ever cared for, Hydra destroys; murders, tortures."
“I politely asked her to step out on this one,” Steve answered, draping himself on the door frame. His voice was deep and soft, gentle, like all the times he’d helped Tony find his bed in the middle of the morning.
It was probably sometime past midnight and Tony desperately needed to tinker on something.
"That's even better."
“Cocky. Alright, darling. I’ll be choking on your name you’ll be fucking me so hard, hnn.” Tony grimaced, digging his fingers into the sheets. “Don’t arouse me like that, it’s painful enough as it is.” He panted, in pain again.
“I’m glad.” Steve said, “ It was hard to find anyone willing to bother. Edible flowers are hard enough to come by as it is, so I decided it’d be easier just growing a selection of fresh herbs in my dorm. The cheese was easier, um. I’d love to have made that on my own too, but. It sounded fun, honestly. Except, the lack of resources, that being cows. Or, or goats.”
The moaning drew to a halt, Tony panting out of breath, replying, “Come in, then.”
“Red Wolf’s back.” Natasha, he mentally correct himself, said. Her face was pensive as she straightened herself out. “Peter came running back in shock, saying Rogers was with him.”
Ironman cocked his head, "You mean--you'd have to ride me over to safety." He failed to realize what he said until Steve's face flushed a bright, highly attractive pink. He decided not to correct himself. "Bit of a tight fit."
"There's more of Sam's Mom's, cookies?" Tony said with a smile, making grabby-hands towards the box Steve magically had behind his back, placing them on the work table next to Tony's schematics. They smelled divine--and, oh! They just so happened to be gingerbread, one of Tony's favorites!
That’d been over an hour ago.
“I can’t do this,” He said. Steve was going to take one look at his face and see everything Tony ever hid from.
And, strangest of all, the rest of the town took him as kindly as they took the rest of each other. He avoided the bar and no one such as murmured the need for a drink when he was present.
Tony really wanted to ask about the whole talking in third person thing, but then he'd have to admit publicly he basically did it too. Who in the seven hells even knew what Doom would do with that kind of information? Yet it sat on the tip of his tongue, waiting to burst out from his mouth. He’d been good at this once--focus. Focus. Most of Doom's rambling sounded like absolute bull ripped straight of an old seventies comic book or something and Tony had half a mind to just smack the back of Doom's fancy wrench against the panel.
"No," Ironman agreed. "Here, look," he flicked up a hologram from their gauntlet projecting news articles Friday translated into English covering Doom's biography. The people they rescued might have spoken English, but if they did they weren't interested in revealing such information. Friday could filter their hushed conversations across the field where they sat in several small piles should Ironman command it. Ironman preferred to value their privacy.
They guy was
For him, Tony was mostly memories glimpsed through the eyes of Steve's previous self. They were painful, in a sort of detached way. His previous self certainly felt scarred and bitter over every argument, longed between the distance that developed between them. And his anger--well. It drowned him. Yet some of his greatest battles involved smoldering it, despite the notion that they were instead the rush of victory saving the world once again.
The medical aid only pursed her lips in response to Tony’s shameless teasing. “Sure looks like it, Mr. Stark. Only this isn’t as easy as dealing with Viagra like you first theorized. I’m ordering a full set of labs and I’m going to insist you remain hospitalized until we can figure out what we’re actually dealing with here.”
Steve failed to hear anyone else inside there with him, and he hated that it made him feel so relieved. Then he felt the worry start to course through him.
And Tony just laughed, a natural tendency regarding the circumstances. "Oh, I'm sure you've done plenty of homework, I sure as hell have. You don't expect me not to invent my way out of hotel Transylvania here and find all the answers my pitiful little heart desires?"
He let Tony direct him towards a large chest brimming with sex toys, including several anthropomorphic styled dildos and an array of strap-ons. There were cuffs and whips, and two differently colored collars, soft as velvet. “I want you to feel better,” He said, picking one of the smaller anthropomorphic dildos that was, in fact, a long tentacle. It was firmer than any of the others, and a deep purple.
"Rogers," Tony managed, summoning every inch of anger he could muster. "Seriously?" Fortunately, he sounded absolutely pathetic.
“Yeah?” Steve was beaming.
It made no sense.
Tony bolted behind the counter, using the stairs to reach the storage room. He blew off the lock to the safe with a set of faulty repulsors he deemed beyond upgrading and smashed open the first bottle he saw. It was his petty sense of self-satisfaction that convinced him storing all his most favorite, and most expensive brand of whiskey here was proper proof he’d beaten the unending need to drink.
"Stark," Someone whispered, and then there was a heavy weight pressing against his shoulders. Not the cave. This isn't Afghanistan. This isn't ...
Tony blinked in confusion, dazed. “I’m, I’m sorry?” He latched his hands onto Steve’s shirt, clinging so tightly as if he might die should he let go. His skin tingled where Steve started caressed a thumb along his jaw.
"Tony," Steve's voice cracked, taking it with both hands. "Tony you didn't have to. You didn't; you really, really didn't."
"Yes."
"Shut up, for the love of Christ! Tony wanted to. We missed you too, I guess." Ironman scratched the back of his head, almost feeling shy. "So you're going to thank him."
Tony never openly admitted how much he hated himself. How much everything ached, in his bones and when he breathed or bent his fingers. His existence hurt, but it wasn't without its good parts; like Peter and seeing Pepper and Happy grow closer because they deserved each other. He wasn't directly involved in those good parts. Except, he was. Ironman was his friend. And for some fucked up reason Ironman liked him, and he liked Ironman. But, he
“Okay,” Tony said, resigning, all the anxiety washing out of him. He was gonna be cranky for days, and would probably succeed in driving Steve mad like he so often did Pepper on the harder days. “As long as you love me.”
"Watch it, Prince-Charming," Tony snatched his hand back. "You're embarrassing me in front of our captors," he said, desperately hoping he wasn't blushing. Ironman never once seemed like he flushed while kissing Steve. Obviously it was hard to tell, and obviously, this was really, really stupid. He needed Steve to log into the mainframe while he was busy distracting Doom. They'd have actually discussed this if Ironman hadn't--ugh! He was the one that stormed off because he was so--so jealous. Of himself!
Tony nodded, puffing his chest in pride, “I am intimidating, I know.”
“Steve, really now.” And then Tony was laying back on the bed, scowling. Or, well Steve thought it looked more like pouting.
“The flowers are mostly just for show, but technically they’re just as edible as all the rest,” Steve said, explaining.
“Ah,” Tony purred, craning his head in a desperate pursuit for more. “Doing this sober was probably my first mistake.”
Steve was not far behind him, probably on purpose. Doom wasn't interested in him, that much was certain. Meaning that Doom was more than likely planning to dump Steve somewhere down in the dungeons (or jail, or whatever the hell it was Doom had installed down in the depths below) while Tony would be stuck facing Doom alone. And, yes, Tony originally attempted to do just that, but Steve's crystal clear photographic memory sounded magnificent now after taking in how massive this place was. Deeper, down at Tony's core, he'd rather die by Steve's hand than by Doom's--and wasn't that the most fucked thing imaginable?
"It's already half-past four in the afternoon," Steve chuckled and ran a hand lovingly through Tony's grease-matted hair. "I brought you a few gifts."
durable. I'm still fucking pissed at you, just in case you think this means I've forgotten."
Steve, the champ that he is, simply snorted. "I'm taking that as the compliment that it is."
"Yes," Steve agreed, "I did, Tony." He met their eyes, "What can I ...what can I do?" he asked so softly, Ironman almost felt pity for him.
“I’m nothing but a patriot,” Tony mock saluted. Steve shut him up by slowly dragging out the dildo buried in his ass, twisting occasionally. Tony’s eyes fluttered and his jaw went slack. “Steve,” He moaned softly, his breathing heavy. “Steve, darling. I’m simply—uhn,” And then Steve pressed the tip of the tentacle inside him, so utterly captivated by the raw, unadulterated lust in Tony’s expression.
Ironman squinted for dramatic effect, responding, "You--you asshole! Flirting with u--yes. Yes, this would work. The armor is more than durable enough. You're like what, the equivalent of fifteen people, twenty.
Tony paced down the steps of Doom's ridiculously placed stairwell, his lips, and cheeks tender from Steve's stupid beard. He slipped back into control long after Steve was content having ravished his mouth, and Ironman had been idly running a hand through Steve's hair.
"It'd mean a lot to me because I'd get to share the occasion with my best fella," Steve flushed. Tony liked it when Steve flushed. The pink glowed down from his ears to his toes, and it was all Tony's to admire. Rarely, Steve would also fidget with his fingers, but he would still stare Tony down with a defiant glare at the very same time like he was now.
Steve was actually really cute when he was flustered. He flushed straight down from his forehead to his neck, the grimace falling away as he bit his lip while he was thinking about how he wanted to answer.
He should probably fix the electric clock he originally been promising.
“More like dumb luck and Fisk’s ability to miss the careful details because he was too high on the moment.”
“Imagining you asking Fury to herd cows might be an even better gift than this,” Tony laughed. “But only if you named one Betsy just for me. And you let me cuddle her from time to time.”
Steve would want to say he didn't miss Tony,  but some cruel, strange part of him reminded him he was lying.
Tony's skin was always so smooth for a man who worked so hard with his hands. But, ah--his lips were starting to get chapped. "Don't worry, we'll have someone adjust the settings for you. Someone I approve of, at any rate. I'd hate for you to get dehydrated, especially like this". He dragged his thumb along Tony's lips, pulling Tony's bottom lip back, savoring the small puff of breath Tony was still managing to breathe. Steve found himself constantly fighting the urge to kiss him, delighted in knowing everything his previous self yearned for was his to conquer. That Tony was already his, to do with as he pleased.
"Tony!" Steve finally answered, lunging behind Doom as Doom was rising off the floor and taking him back down by landing on his shoulders. Tony fired a few more shots, but Steve elbowing Doom's head apparently knocked the guy right out.
Natasha continued past, turning the corner.
"This must really mean a lot to you to go through all the trouble."
Whatever Parker thought he saw or didn’t would need to be dealt with regardless. It’s just the same shit, he repeated to himself. Same as it’s been since the beginning of forever.
He missed Steve, desperately so sometimes it weighed him down. It’d been several months since it all changed. The town, the people. All of it. He’d been doing good when it came to craving a sip of whiskey or a taste of wine. But sometimes he got so lost remembering Steve, and how the blood trailed in the dirt he had to hammer pieces of metal till they were junk just so the urge to give in would stop.
Ironman scoffed. Steve was such an ass. "Please, just sit back down. We'll worry about your supersoldier metabolism in just a minute. First, I need to know what the fuck you think you're doing here. I mean, what is this with the beard and the horrible paint job?" He gestured at Steve's uniform with a finger. "Jesus, you even ripped the star out."
Tony chuckled, deeply amused. “How chivalrous of you.” He joked, but then he refused to meet Steve’s eyes. “Steve you needn’t be worrying about me right now. You should be home or, I don’t know, at least with your friends.”
In the time before, his previous self liked to daydream about Tony shouting in pleasure, begging for more while tightly latched underneath him. Now he envisioned Tony's sobs while he took Tony for everything he was worth. He wanted to pin Tony down by the throat--he wanted to use Tony like a toy, whether Tony liked it or not. Perhaps, even sometimes, he delighted at the thought of Tony whimpering, coated in his own blood and laying boneless as Steve thrust deep inside of him.
“Then I’m not going anywhere,” Steve assured him.
“I need you to come Tony. It’s going to be okay. I’m right here, I’m right here okay? Come, and then it’s okay to be over.” He reassured, beginning to caress the soft skin of Tony’s cock, the whole of it burning hot and twitching in his hand. It was leaking down along his fingers, helping keep his hand slick. Finally, Tony jolted forward, grasping for Steve’s arms—Steve’s anything—as he screamed through his release, strings of white coating Steve’s hand and abdomen.
"I have a headache," he managed to say once Steve caught up with him. "I reckon catching a glimpse at that machine Doom's got might do the trick. Doom's probably around tinkering himself if he's as great as he says he is. You're officially on Dum-E duty." He patted Steve's shoulder without making eye contact, leading the way.
“That’s quite unfortunate. I think they were going to start the bid at 5 million dollars”, came Thor’s voice.
Oh my
Vrooom, a vehicle went passed him in a flash. Thinking it was the pizza guy Tony glanced at the road only to find that it was a red Porsche car.
He went to take his seat with the rest of the crowd who had stayed back to support their team. The players came out and greeted their opponents. The whistle blew and the game was on.
“Shut up. Aren’t you the one selfishly wearing my shirt? Take responsibility”, Steve growled at him as he grabbed the front of his shirt Tony was wearing while the smaller male glared at him with an annoyed pout.
“Okay, thank for the help”
“It isn’t like that but I like your face. I guess that’s what you mean by ‘type’ ”, Steve replied with a sweet smile.
“Right….If that’s all I’m going”
“I don’t think that what happened there, Tony. He likes you. Did you not notice how he didn’t even notice my presence the first few minutes and kept talking to you?”
“You seem like someone who’s easy to talk to. I have lots of questions to ask you later”, he said giving him a friendly smile.
“Rude. And what’s up with yours? Yours look like something people would eat during their diet”
He remembered Stark telling him last night, “I knew it was impossible to train a wild animal”, as he glanced up from the pillow he was clutching, Steve’s dick buried deep inside him as sweat adorned his body. But he felt like that Stark himself was also a stray animal himself. Always skipping around from place to place.
No, this can’t be. Tony forgot about him? It’s not true. Someone please tell him this isn’t true. That this is just a sick joke Tony is playing on him and that he’ll say ‘Ha! I got you good, Cap’. But it never came. Tony continued staring at him not knowing what to do. Steve felt tears flowing out his blue eyes and falling on top of his hands. He couldn’t stop it even if he wants to. It kept pouring out, he can’t help it.
Rhodey let out a nervous smile. “Ah, that reminds me….Pepper you…”, he started but she cut him off, “That’s right. I went out with him for exactly one week in July”, she said showing a peace sign.
“….Was that your girlfriend for the week?”, Tony asked cause he was curious. And adding that she looks older than 20. Steve, not getting at it the first time stared at his senior looking lost, not getting it.
“What are you talking about, mortal? I cast no such spell on your Ironman”, was Loki’s off handed reply. Steve felt like ripping his head off.
“Oh, I..um, I like biochemistry and nuclear physics. I’m currently fascinated with nuclear physics at the moment. What about you?”
“I can’t really compare you two to each other”

Phil Coulson”
“No, not there… Don’t push in…!”, Tony gasped out as Steve suddenly thrust three of his fingers into his hole. He finally came when one of Steve’s fingers brushed at his prostrate. Wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck, his whole body trembling in pleasure.
“Nope. Not at all. We’re just acquaintances. You know he doesn’t really come to practice”
“It went well…I guess..”
“I’ll come with you till the Colney Street”, Steve replied looking ahead.
Mom, what have I gotten myself into.
“Yeah, are there any other Rogers? That guy even though he’s a first year he’s a great player”, Rhodey told them.
“Alright, good to hear. I’m running a bit late for a meeting so I’ll better be going now”
The game got more serious as it went but Rhodey also managed to score one. Tying up the scores. Their opponents were now trying really hard to not make them level up their points. There was barely 5 minutes left in the match.
“You’ve been really quite today, Steve”, he told him, “I really hate that, okay? That you are actually unhappy about something but you just keep quite and go along with it”. Tony put down his half eaten Shawarma to stare at the guy, putting a palm on his chin.
It was luck that Tony’s friend, Dr. Stephen Strange also known as the Sorcerer Supreme, a fellow hero had dropped by the tower for a visit. Steve had asked the magician if he could help Tony, telling him about Tony’s strange condition, after which Dr. Strange used his magic on Ironman, agreeing to help. The result shook them to the core.
“Thanks, Barton”
“Eh?...To attend class. What do you think I’m doing here?”
Tony’s face went red at the comment. “He…! He does not like me. Besides I don’t swing that way!”, he sluttered out, embarrassed.
Taking a deep breath Steve mustered up his courage and swung his feet into the air sending the ball flying with it, STRAIGHT TO THE GOAL!
It wasn’t getting better. Tony seems to keep forgetting stuffs. From small things like forgetting what he was doing at the moment it became worse with him forgetting even people’s name and faces. Even of Steve and the rest of the avenger. It happened during a fight as well. Ironman had abruptly stood still among the chaos of the battle with their enemies, like he forgot what he was doing there. Steve had to tackle him down in an attempt to save him from the on coming danger.
“Fooling around”, he bluntly replied making the blonde a bit dejected,” Besides aren’t you my senior?”
Steve felt as if his heart was being ripped apart. It’s too cruel. He doesn’t want to do this either. He’d prefer it if he could spend whatever remaining time he had left with Tony in his arms, who, even a little bit knew him, loved him. But this was for the best. For Tony.
PS - I added Tony's uniform i drew on a whim, its sucks cause i haven't drawn in months but hope you like it
“St-stop!...STOP..!I SAID TO STOP SO HURRY UP AND TAKE IT OUT!”, Tony shouted at him making him froze his action. The hell. Is he seriously backing away after they’ve gotten this far?
“Tony, don’t worry. I’ll fix this, okay? We’ll find Loki and break the spell. So, just hang in there”, he whispered in a calming tone.
Hearing that I was hit by a sudden impulse.
“Great, I have a letter for a Mr. Tony Stark. Here you go”, he said handing him a well-sealed letter with a fancy looking stamp seal, giving another small smile he went back to the delivery truck. Tony opened the letter and let out a small gasp as he read it. It says,
“Why not? I don’t get it”, she whined.
“I’m totally craving for some Shawarma”, Tony added as he continues walking ahead.
“So what should I do? I’m taking my fingers out. Hey, what now? Should I stop?”. He makes a scissor like movement inside him, earning a rough throaty moan. Tony whimpered as he brought his arms to cover his tear stained eyes. Mumbling something.
“How did you managed to get Steve to come for the match?”, Rhodey asked in wonder when he saw Steve changing into his jersey. Tony just gave a proud smile, “I have my ways, Honey bear. Now go win that game”, he told him patting on his shoulder. He then slid out the changing room to give their football team some space but not before looking back to Steve and mouthing ‘You better win’ to him to which the other smiled nervously.
Tony woke up with a slight headache. Last night’s events had him feeling dead. He rubbed his eyes trying to clear the haze. He then saw the familiar grey blazer of the academy which didn’t belong to him. Tony blushed hard. He couldn’t believe he was cuddling onto Steve’s all night. God, this was embarrassing.
After a good hour of fending off and attacking it the beast started to weaken from the combined attack of the team, then Hulk smashed it into the ground. The team had just put down the monster Loki had summoned and were now fully concentrated on the magician when …….
“I knew you didn’t mean it from the start”, Pepper said with a slight pout.
They didn’t finish until sunset, then they went to a nearby theater together.
“It doesn’t matter. Just break the spell before I break you”, he said, hands clenching tightly on both sides.
“I’m not and I’m not leaving you, ever, okay?”, he assured him wiping away the tears. “Now come over here and give me a kiss, ya big crybaby”, Tony teased making grabby hands at Steve who happily obliged.
“Well, we’ll have to see about that”
“Tony?....Tony, what’s wrong? Talk to me please”, Steve pleaded, putting his hands on Tony’s shoulder to comfort him. What’s happening to Tony now? He was at a lost on what to do.
“Um, will it be alright if we ask for you again next time?”, the girls asked in unison sighing happily.
While he pondered over where he should stay an idea hit him. Rogers lived in Brooklyn. That delinquent classmate of his during high school had stayed here and was currently working as a bodyguard for one of the top mafia boss.
“Shut the fuck up, you fools. If you want to be just as good work harder. Complaining ain’t gonna make you get better, you jealous pricks!”
“See you around?”, he added with shy smile.
“Good to hear. Who’s your friend?”, Steve gestured.
Club practice match huh…So he’ll be there? Well it’s fine. It’s been a while anyway.
Things went back to like they were. With Tony busying himself in work and Avengers’ business. They went on dates and had a lot of heated sex. Life was good. Everything was going well. Until it wasn’t.
“I’m Tony and this is Bruce. We joined recently”, he said introducing them both.
Steve was snoring lightly. His body moving slightly with every breath he took. Tony stood in his place near the bedroom door and stares at the sleeping figure in front of him like he was deep in thought. Finally he excused himself and went under the covers with Steve.
“My god, you haven’t heard of us? We’re the most popular club in the academy. It’s practically a sin to not know us”, he declared.
“That is all.…SU president?”
“I’m sorry about that, I kind of joined recently like just yesterday. I don’t know what to say”, Bruce replied with a sympathetic smile. “What?! Then you got a scholarship too? What is your field of interest?”, he asked getting excited to find a fellow new comer.
“What did you expect to happen anyway Mr. Tony?”
“Tony….Even if you forget me, I won’t. Even if you don’t love me anymore, I won’t. I’ll just have to make you fall in love with me all over again. It doesn’t matter how long it’ll take. You’ll find yourself telling me you love me again”
“Yes, I’m an idiot. Sorry”, he replied, trying hard to muffle his laugh.
“I am not certain, my friend but I will go back to Asgard and get help from Heimdall. He would know”, was the god’s reply.
Tony laid naked on the bed as Steve started to work him open with his lubed up fingers. Stretching his hole in a quick rhythm.
“Loki, remove the spell you cast on Tony”, Steve demanded, glaring at him.
-flashback ends-
Tony let out a quite chuckle. “What? You’re asleep already? How boring ”.
When Tony went to his seat he found a note under his desk. It had asked him to meet during lunch at the back of the gym building. This seems fishy. He should probably ignore it but he was curious. So when lunch time came around he waved off at the others saying he needed to be somewhere and would meet up later.
He took his position in front of the goal, letting out a breath of air to calm himself. It had been a while doing this so he was kind of nervous.
“Yeah, if you don’t mind”
“Patience? Service? Cut the bullshit. Don’t come close to me with your ideas, Stark”
“Yes?!”
~~~~~~
Rhodey with a calm smile replied, “Yeah, the day he’ll definitely say ‘YES’. And at the end of the week he’ll tell his partner exactly this..”
Letting out a small sigh he got up from his seat. He did promised Tony he’d make him fall for him again. Better start now. He went over to his former lover’s table and sat down at one of the empty seat.
