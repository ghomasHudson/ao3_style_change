Steve sent him a look, sighing as he briefly glanced away. His shoulders remained tensed, his jaw clenching. “What do you expect me to think when you ambush me trying to sell your narrative?”
__________
Steve staggered suddenly, his entire body beginning to feel as if it were locking up. His knees threatened to wobble, even as they were already planted on the ground. The concrete of the ruined compound. He fell forwards, his bare hand pressing into the ground as he began to heave.
And it wouldn’t.
Tony had began to shut his eyes just as something knocked against his shin. He winced, abruptly pulling back from Steve to glance down at Dum-E. The robot chirped happily, almost as if it were checking in on the situation.
Rhodey.
Tony couldn’t help it. He wanted to laugh at the implication. Did Steve really think he had never cut Tony down? He was so fed up with all of this. This, being Steve having the audacity to imply he had no reason to think such toxic thoughts. The brunet heard it on a daily basis. He was practically immune to degrading remarks. He reflected them too well by now.
“You’re right,” Tony relented, turning and forcing himself to meet Steve’s unwavering gaze, “But he deserves this. He deserves to be known as a hero. Because that’s what he will always be known as. To me. As he should be.”
The brunet felt quite foolish for it, too. After all, he was in his house. He was home. There wasn’t any reason for him to not be comfortable in his own space. Except... except it was easier said than done, wasn’t it? He could try to ignore the metaphorical elephant in the room.
“How can you say you love me, if you left?” Tony’s voice sounded small, “You walked away. And that’s on you, not me. Don’t bullshit me, Rogers.”
“Not that new.” Tony motioned towards his overall being.
(See the end of the chapter for
Bucky was lazy grins and warm hands. Bucky took care of him as he was sick. He held the puke bucket and brushed his hair back. But no, Steve was never actually in love with his best friend. He could only see how they might’ve been able to make it work.
“For Bucky,” Steve’s voice broke him from his thoughts.
Tony laughed lightly, reaching out to cut off the stove and place the sauce pan away from the hot surface. “Eh, I’ve been asked worse.” The genius squeaked at the sensation of being pinched, huffing as Steve kissed his bare skin in apology. “Go on, if you must.”
“How are you here? What’s happening?” Tony’s going through a million different thoughts in his head, while Steve just sits there concerned and confused. Last night, everything was fine. Not fine, but fine. His Steve was gone. He knew his Steve loved him before he died, but he also knew that he would never see him again. He fell asleep with his head clear and his heart heavy. So, why was Steve here?
The blond exhaled before steam rolling on. Tony couldn’t help but note the way Steve’s shoulders were squared, almost as if he were going into battle. The genius huffed silently to himself, his lips threateningly twitching. Steve was
He let out a sigh of relief.
, whatever this was, a shot. Especially if Steve’s reaction were anything to go by. The blond shot forward, so fast that Tony might have suspected him of flying. It was kind of impressive, actually. Not as impressive as the sensation of Steve’s arms crushing him against his broad chest.
He was old and soft, but the stories from the scars and blemishes were no longer bitter. Tony stared into the mirror, and took in the sight of the wrinkles around his eyes. The wrinkles hinted at light and sunny memories. Days when Tony had felt the sun on his skin and Steve’s hand in his own.
Steve swallowed.
“And uh. What news is that, exactly?” Tony swallowed, his brow  furrowing in confusion. He was strangely beginning to feel intimidated. And slightly turned on due to being in such close proximity, but that was neither here or there.
“I love you.” Tony spoke out loud, his voice ringing in the clearing they found themselves in.
Tony’s demeanor softened, his eyes dropping to the bed spread. Steve wanted to take it back, instantly. He wasn’t- he didn’t want to
“I think you need to tell daddy to eat.” Steve whispered conspiringly to Peter, sending Tony a knowing look. The brunet smiled guiltily at being caught up in his thoughts.
“Big breakfast.” Tony spoke innocently, climbing onto a bar stool as Steve set up the plates.
“Sounds like blood loss,” Rhodey supplied, sounding put out, “But from what–“
His eyes traced over the kitchen, taking note of the countless ingredients pulled out along with pans and trays. The billionaire’s eyes fell onto the figure of his husband, greedily taking in the outline of his broad shoulders. Steve was busy at work, his left arm idly stirring a pan of what appeared to be scrambled eggs while his right began turning pancakes onto their opposing side.
“I love you.” Steve spoke, his voice sounding like a vow. Emphasis was stressed as his lips pressed against Tony’s skin for each word. “And admire you.”
He was thankful Steve didn’t instantly scoff.
Rhodey snorted, his retort faltering at the sound of a deep yawn from the doorway. He glanced back, smirking at the sight of a disheveled Bucky Barnes stumbling into the room.
The pair reached the entrance, Tony ducking under Steve’s arm as the super soldier held the door open for him. It seemed almost like an unspoken agreement as they ventured towards the first exhibit, their eyes roaming over the creation and taking in the detail, or lack thereof. Sometimes, simplicity was art within itself.
They never would be.
It didn’t help that Tony struggled with making it known. It took Steve sitting them both down and giving them his best stern look before they talked it out. And then the rest was history. So, no, it wasn’t an issue. After all, they had a live in babysitter at all times.
“Now what?” Tony allowed himself to roll off Steve and onto the bed. His feet dangled over the bottom edge of the mattress.
He knew he was a good person. But he also knew good people made mistakes. Tony had no trouble calling him out on those. He just lost sight of that. He didn’t know when he stopped looking at them as a team, but it would have to change. Steve would make sure of it. It would be them vs. the world.
Steve realized his mistake with a jolt. His tone had heavily hinted at knowledge not known by these Avengers. He had succeeded; he saved Tony. So that meant... no one would be aware of the sacrifice he paid. They were none the wiser of the fate Tony
Tony forced a smile and hoped like hell it came off as genuine. The genius climbed to his feet, keeping his pace measured as he crossed the room to meet Steve halfway. He did so in an attempt to prevent the blond from getting a glimpse of the computer monitors and projections.
Steve.
“His heart rate is soaring..”
“It’s hard.” Tony cleared his throat, his voice sounding thicker than usual. “It was hard enough growing up knowing... But then to meet the real thing and be told you’re selfish? It was a slap in the face.”
No, Tony thought, closing his eyes.
“I did not agree with the Accords because... because I’ve always struggled with allowing my actions to be controlled. It scared me,” he exhaled, laughing bitterly, “And Bucky? He was just the icing on the cake. It felt like everything was trying to push us apart.”
The Avengers were already there, although Steve felt saddened by calling them that. Only himself, Natasha, Bruce, and Rhodey remained. The four of them abandoned the crowd, daring to edge even closer to the medium-sized ship that was now landing amongst the wreckage left from the battle.
Not for him.
Tony may not have saved his Steve, but he saved that one.
Mentoring Peter; a father.
“Of course.” Tony replied, albeit a bit hysterically. “But sometimes, Steve, sometimes it feels... too good to be true.” The brunet didn’t want to go into detail on how he struggled to explain this to even his trained therapist. The feeling of constantly being incomplete. Like he would never be whole again. But he had to try, for Steve. He had to try to make sense of it. “Sometimes I still feel like I’m back in space stranded on a foreign planet with the ashes of my friends.” His voice was a whisper now. “But then I wake up and– and you’re right there. You’re
The sound of ceramic being placed onto the counter top jarred Tony from his thoughts. He glanced up just as Steve tugged Peter by the hips and over the counter, the child being sent into fits of laughter at being grabbed from behind.
It meant he was
“And about Bucky... I had worked myself up. Realistically, maybe I knew you’d struggle with accepting him. But I wasn’t using logic,” Steve swallowed, “I thought that if I had managed to get him back to before his soldier’s programming somehow... then I would tell you. And it would be easier if he were more him and less Hydra.”
Something had happened. That much was obvious. Nothing else would explain Steve’s behavior and how out of routine everything had been; from the bedroom routine to breakfast. It was.... interesting. Tony eyed the blond over the rim of his mug, pursing his lips.
“Uncle Bucky...” Peter frowned, abruptly leaning forward as the super soldier trailed towards the barstools. Tony shot his arm out to hold Peter back from toppling off the counter, huffing in amusement as the child didn’t even appear phased. “Are you... sick?”
“No,” Steve crossed his arms, a tell-tale sign that he was growing anxious. “But.. I see how that looks now. And I’m sorry I made you feel... abandoned.”
Tony wanted to ask.
And they all had almost lost.
“It helps?” Tony replied weakly, tensing up once he felt the heat of Steve’s body closing in.
“Things,” Rhodey scoffed at the word, “I’m serious. I’m not afraid to go Dr. Phil on both of your asses. Especially his. He doesn’t get to break you and leave me to pick up the pieces. Not again, no. We’re not playing this game anymore.”
“Why not both?”
“My name is Steve.” The Captain corrected, internally wincing. He had meant for that to come across much.. softer. He feared he had failed.
“Thor has decided to fly into space,” she said in a matter of fact tone. Steve knew that despite her nonchalant attitude, she was carefully gauging his reaction.
Tony had done everything in order to make sure he would never be the cause for that emotion.
“You’re going to give him a chance, Steve.” Her voice was quiet as her face softened. She leaned back in her chair, neatly crossing her legs before fixing him with a stern look. “It’s 5 o’clock. You know what you have to do.”
But tears meant Tony could cry.
“I do.” The words fell from Steve’s mouth, rolling off his tongue in what sounded like practiced ease. Tony’s heart clenched at the sound of the blond’s stern voice.
It was time for him to live.
He pulled himself from his thoughts, tiredly glancing towards the blond Asgardian. Thor, Rocket, Rhodey, and Carol had been the ones to find Tony and Nebula’s ship. They had been lucky. Space was huge and well, their ship would hardly register as being important on anyone’s radar. The two could’ve very well been left for dead. Tony’s lip curled at the thought.
“I take it your meeting with Princess Shuri went well?” Rhodey chuckled, motioning towards a nearby barstool and island, seeming at ease as he took a seat. Tony opted out of the seat.
The Captain knew he was going for a teasing tone. A way to lighten the atmosphere. Maybe he was reading too far into it, but...
It was too much, almost.
Steve turned out to face the doorway. He had been lying in bed despite it being two in the afternoon. He’d grown tired of being watched by his remaining teammates as if expecting him to crack. So he’d begged off, saying he needed a nap, something he was sure they were all quietly relieved by.
“Almost there.” The Captain continued, his hand falling from the brunet’s face in a show of trust. Both of Steve’s hands now settled on Tony’s hips, guiding him into position just so. Until, finally, he was pulled to a stop. “Okay...” Steve tried to keep his breathing measured, but didn’t seem to take their close proximity into account. Tony could feel his shaky exhale as it fanned against his neck. “You can open your eyes now.”
Steve looked like he could plow into a dozen punching bags with minimal effort. Which, was actually kinda hot. Tony found his eyes trailing across the blond’s bulging biceps before forcefully blinking. He had to stay on track.
Steve’s brow furrowed, a question on the tip of his tongue.
The brunet quickly dressed, patting the back of his empty pockets in confusion before remembering his keys being in the kitchen. He toed on a pair of Gucci slides before making his way downstairs.
Tony squeezed his hand.
“This is where I sleep,” Steve broke him from his thoughts.
No. Not possible. Not with the serum. But. Then what? He gasped for air, his breathing coming out wheezy. A panic attack. He was having a panic attack.
The sound of scraping chairs rang out as the surrounding people began to stand. Their expressions were tired and defeated, but strong. A sense of understanding had dawned on them. They had to see the people as who they were. Heroes. Tony held his breath as his eyes grew damp.
But that’s not how any of it worked, and Tony knew that. He knew the hypothetical ball was in Steve’s court at this point. He couldn’t be held responsible for how either of them reacted from this point forth. Tony was tired.
“I didn’t think I had another option.”
“Checked in every hour, yes,” Rhodey crossed the room slowly, as if he were approaching a grenade. He nodded understandingly, stopping just close enough to clasp his hand against Steve’s shoulder, “Let’s give him some time. I’ll send after you in a few, sound good?” There wasn’t any room left to argue; that much was clear. Tony almost would’ve laughed if it had been anyone else Rhodey was giving the third degree to.
“Tony.” Steve’s voice came out hoarse, rusty from lack of use. He shuffled closer and cautiously lifted his arm. He didn’t want to frighten Tony with sudden movements. He needed to approach this situation carefully. Tony’s well-being was his main priority and nothing would–
His eyes slowly trailed across the screen, his eyes softening as he took in the live feed of the kitchen. Peter was crawling around the bar, blocks sprawled around him as Steve stirred something on the stove top.
“Yes, very riveting.” Tony agreed, hesitating briefly before pressing his lips to the crown of Peter’s head. The genius blamed his hesitation on the basis that getting closer to Peter in proximity meant stepping nearer Steve; and not knowing if that was okay.
Steve glanced away, blinking rapidly. Tony froze, his breath hitching. There’s no way he was... he couldn’t be crying. Was he?
The blond continued to stare, his gaze almost contemplative. It was unnerving. Tony couldn’t help but fidget under such a look, his eyes nervously flickering to and fro. It felt as if Steve were sizing him up. Which. Which didn’t make sense, unless–
“Before you go...” Steve slowly untangled himself, reaching back before revealing a book of some sort. He opened the pages and began flipping through, highlighting the countless pictures being shown. “The team, we uh, they made this for you. Mainly Peter, he had the camera.”
After all, Bucky seemed to have no issue taking space in their guest room.
“You should’ve told me,” Tony crossed his legs, drumming his fingers against his knee.
“Thank you, Banner.” Steve nodded, looking down at the familiar white, red, and black suit.
“You think- you really think,” Steve cut himself off, reaching out to grasp Tony’s wrist, “Natasha was right. I really am a fool.”
Had Tony cared?
The trip had been worth it.
“Peter piper.” Tony teasingly scolded, leaning over the counter to retrieve a napkin in order wipe the food off the child’s face. “Do you enjoy wearing your food?” The child broke into fits of giggles as the billionaire began tickling around his sides and arm pits. “Yes, I think you do.”
Tony took one glance at Steve’s drawn expression and deeply exhaled. He had always struggled with turning down those baby blues. He allowed himself a second of doubt. Was this a good idea? Most certainly not one of his best.
“C’mon, Rogers,” Tony sighed, “Use your words. Hell, can’t believe I have to be the one to say that.”
“Suppose that’s fair,” Steve nodded, “I still stand behind my initial beliefs. But now I see that maybe I went about them the wrong way.”
He could feel it happening. The air was growing tenser, almost still. An eery calm was beginning to settle over the field. Steve’s pace quickened, his legs taking him over the rubble of the ruined building and closer to the pit where Tony would soon pass.
“And why should I believe you?”
“I thought– I had thought we were getting somewhere.” Tony continued, fiddling with his keyboard. “But then the Accords– they set us further back than before you had even come out of the ice. And, hell.” Tony cut himself off, forcibly squeezing his eyes shit as tears threatened to spill. “You made your priorities very clear with Barnes. It wasn’t just one isolated incident... it was everything stacked together.”
“Don’t tell me you love me unless you mean it,” Tony retorted just as quickly as the last word left Steve’s mouth.
“What – Tony,” Steve lunged to his feet as Tony made his way towards the door.
He stuffed his hands in his pockets before shooting the screen one last look and gradually making his exit. His thoughts raced as he walked through the corridor. How long had it been since Peter– since Titan? Were any plans in place for this sort of scenario? Had Maria or, hell, even Fury been in contact? Tony figured Rhodey would have contacted Pepper by now and informed her of his condition. Unless.. unless she had also been– No. He refused to even entertain the thought. She’s safe. In New York. With Happy. Happy.
“That’s great. Probably our best bet in finding Tony.” Steve nodded, pushing off the desk. He felt composed. He need to remain as clear headed as possible. He crossed the room in four strides. “When do we leave?”
“But I thought... maybe this time.” Steve continued, shrugging before shooting Tony a sheepish smile over his shoulder. “It’s not your typical art gallery, after all.”
But Tony liked to consider his own self far more realistic. The brunet knew numbers, percentages, and how to slither his way through a deal. Tony could argue and if that weren’t enough, he could present an opposing force with a team of lawyers that would send anyone scrambling.
“Nothing, just listen,” Rhodey inhaled, “I always thought Steve to be a bit arrogant. Still do, actually.” Tony cracked a smile at that. “But I see now... he’s still the same guy who would drop everything to help you. And that meant a lot to me when I felt... When I felt like I lost you. For good.”
“What’s happening?” That was Rhodey’s voice.
“Hey, that squirrel is talking,” Tony pointed towards Rocket, his voice taking on a joking manner, “And what’s code 49? Didn’t we agree on these? Anyone?”
“Kid?” Thor spoke up, his voice laced in confusion, “Another worthy hero has joined the Avengers?”
doing.” Tony stressed. “That’s what this is about... trying to stay ahead. We can do this. But only if we’re in it–“
occurred.
This was happening.
They didn’t know Tony was meant to die.
“Fine.” Tony relented, pursing his lips. “Keep your secrets. But don’t expect me to be pleased if it includes physical activity.”
Tony was relieved to hear Pepper and Happy had made it, but tight lipped at the knowledge of King T’Challa, Vision, and so many others having been casualties.
Tony couldn’t ignore the swelling in his chest and how incredibly full he felt. It was a product of Steve’s obvious attempt at trying to keep their relationship steady; as opposed to a disastrous outcome of a possible proposal rejection. Steve didn’t care how he kept Tony at his side or on his team, just as long as he did.
So he would take this chance. The chance at finding more information out on this stranger wearing Steve’s face. Tony couldn’t explain the drive within him. The feeling in the pit of his stomach... it was almost like he was being tugged forth.
“...noticed what?” Steve croaked.
“And yes,” Tony nodded, “He’s an Avenger.”
So imagine his surprise when he woke up from the ice to the strong, bitter taste of hot coffee sliding down his throat and sending his taste buds haywire. Perhaps the field agents and scientists thought him weird, but he had immediately shoved a handful of ice in his mouth.
“Why do I feel like you’re guarding my chastity?” Tony began to pout before his lips curled suggestively. “Or lack thereof?”
been destined for. The fate Steve worked so needlessly to fix.
__________
He would be okay.
“Yeah.” Steve’s voice sounded rusty. “It’s a private organization. Very professional, a lot of NDA’s involved.”
They pulled apart.
Not that it was visible, of course. Tony was rather good at managing his poker face. It didn’t mean his insides weren’t currently at war, though. He was anxious, exhausted, ravenous, relieved, terrified, and slightly nauseous. It didn’t help that he also had a raging headache. After all, dehydration would do that to you.
“Oh?” Tony glanced back, allowing himself to relax as Steve stepped up behind him. He leaned back into the blond’s chest, his own lips curling up playfully as he shot him a look. “You have something else to ask of me? After all you’ve asked today?”
The sound of Peter’s vibrant shrieking could be heard as he spotted his parents in the doorway of the kitchen.
“I’m saying, Tony, that I love you.” The blond pushed the dark haired man back, gripping him by the shoulders even as he held him at arms length. The position had forced Tony to maintain eye contact with him. “Loved you. Love you. Past, present, future. Hell, Stark, I don’t know what it was like for you to have lost me. But this version of me, is the same as yours. And I... I know you want me to be your Steve.”
“I took the easy way out. I think about that moment everyday. When I– when I was fighting Thanos’s children, I thought about how the last time I had fought someone.. it was you. And that hurt me more than you could ever know.”
“I rented it out.” Steve admitted, turning on his heel. He stepped forward, his hands reaching out to grasp Tony’s. “It’ll just be... the two of us. If that’s okay.”
Tony frowned.
Pepper’s voice.
Steve shrugged, almost as if to say, what can you do?
The blond was accustomed to Tony’s antics. He was well aware of the multiple ways the billionaire enjoyed deflecting a serious topic. And in this case... Tony was trying to act as if everything was fine. And maybe it was, to everyone else.
“Well. I’m awake.” The brunet fell back dramatically, his arms crossing behind his head. “Go on, what are we doing today? Volunteering at a pet shelter? Walking old ladies across the street? Teaching Bucky how to cook pasta?
“I’m going to marry you.” Steve exhaled, his forehead knocking into Tony’s own. Maybe if they had been much younger, they may have erupted into mindless kisses.
The brunet half heartedly rubbed at his eyes, desperate to clear his vision. It was Saturday morning, and Tony knew this because Friday was movie night, which the team had easily partook in yesterday. Which, wait.
“Shit.” He cursed, rubbing a hand over his mouth.
They broke through the crowd that had gathered along the edges of the palace. Shuri stood in the center, surrounded by the remaining Dora Milaje and her mother. She spared their arrival a small nod and a polite smile. Steve saluted back.
“Symbolism?” Tony swallowed, his eyes flickering from the drawing to Steve’s reddening face.
“I– sure thing, Cap.” Tony rubbed the back of his neck as his cheeks began to flush. “But, are you gonna tell me– Steve. Why are you undressing?”
Tony was dying.
“Each portrait is... it’s you.” Steve explained, his eyes briefly meeting Tony’s own before glancing away, an obvious sign of his own nervousness. “But you seen in the different roles you play.” The blond took a measured step back, sucking in a deep breath before dropping to one knee. His eyes were cast downward, but it didn’t prevent his voice from holding steady. It was quite the contrast to the previous hint of anxiety. “You’re all of those. A father figure. A hero. A teammate. A genius. A leader. My.. my partner. And I want all of you.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve began.
“Do you remember what I said before we tried to defeat Ultron?”
“Let’s get you inside,” Steve spoke firmly, detangling his limbs from Tony’s before he leaned down. Tony opened his mouth in protest, or perhaps to question Steve’s intent or maybe just to complain about the loss of body heat he was now experiencing. The words soon died on the tip of his tongue as Steve cradled him to his chest, feet swung up and dangling over the broad arm as he held Tony bridal style. The blonde man’s mouth was set in a determined line as he began walking with conviction. Tony rolled his eyes before allowing himself to melt in the embrace, his strength finally dissipating once he no longer had to hold himself up.
Was he having a heart attack?
The retired hero knew he wore age well. But he stopped caring about his looks years ago. It had felt like he were lost in an endless cycle of just existing.
“Oh.”
Tony let out a weak chuckle, his head lolling backwards as laughter threatened to pour from his lips. “Something funny?” Natasha glanced at him from the corner of her eye, seeming alarmed. Tony laughed somewhat hysterically, the idea of being swept up in Steve’s arms in Wakanda of all places, all thanks to being stabbed by Thanos seemed almost too ironic. It would take the end of the world to bring them all back together, he dully noted.
Steve parted his lips.
“Tony,” Rhodey glanced away, avoiding his gaze, “It’s not– Listen man, you just had surgery. It’s probably not the best idea to talk about stressful situations so soon.”
“Okay, okay,” Tony kicked at him, “There are things to work through. I get that.”
And with that vow, Tony Stark glanced back at his abandoned lab before peering up at his husband; an easy smile spreading across his usually tired face. “Yeah, let’s call it a night.”
“Man,” Tony couldn’t help but correct, his tone halting Thor’s almost reply, “He prefers” -- preferred -- “being called Spider-Man.”
“Tony.” Steve sighed, the blond’s mouth pressing against the crown of the billionaire’s head. “Thank you.”
This was just for the two of them. For Tony
“Together?” Steve scoffed. “You’ve already made up your mind without even considering everyone else’s. This.. this isn’t you, Tony. You’re not selfish.”
Tony didn’t want to go back, not really.
“Oh yeah?” Tony scoffed, giving Rhodey’s backside a hard jab, “What’s stressful is you labeling a situation you won’t tell me as being such! C’mon. Don’t make me pull out IOU’s.”
Steve’s obvious contempt didn’t prevent Rhodey and Bucky from erupting into fits of laughter, however. The Stark-Rogers family were often the focal point of entertainment, and this time most certainly was no different.
Steve nodded, sending the older man a warm expression. Proud, even. He stepped alongside Tony, walking him up to the wormhole.
“Tony.” Steve sounded confused, his mouth twisting as he took in the scene before him. He stepped off the elevator, his bag falling to the ground as his blue eyes swept over the room. His face took on one of concern as he closed the distance between himself and the brunet. “What happened? Is Peter–“
He was hesitant to venture down to the kitchen because of the blond. Tony didn’t know what to expect if he came face to face with his husband, and he felt ashamedly childish over it. Internally, he knew he should be more mature regarding the situation. Which is exactly why he gave himself no time to second guess his decision as he padded downstairs.
Peter pulled away and nodded slowly, concern briefly flashing across his face. He shot Tony an approving smile before disappearing down the stairs. The older man allowed his eyes to trail after the man, a whimsical sigh falling past his lips.
Even if he were suspicious, it was easy for Tony to enjoy Steve’s breakfast. The blond knew his way around a kitchen quite well, with and
“You thought I chose Bucky over you.”
“I am quite aware,” she softened her tone, “My brother spoke very highly of you. I would be quite interested in having you join me in my lab, perhaps... Another time. Given the circumstances, of course.”
Steve nodded jerkily, taking a deep breath before stepping back. He motioned towards the bed, a frown marring his face as he took a seat. Tony cautiously sat beside him, desperately avoiding the memory of the last time they shared a bed. Instead, he attempted to discreetly wipe his face.
“Peter.” Steve pressed his lips together, his blue eyes softening as he nodded towards their son. “His endless need to talk. Make noise. Share his opinion. He gets it from you.”
And despite all of that, he didn’t like what he saw.
“Trust you.”
The brunet tugged the sheet up to his chest, a faux gasp falling past his lips as he clutched at the material. “Stop threatening my chastity.”
Blood.
It felt like Tony had just agreed to something far more intense than giving
Which, wouldn’t happen.
They had succeeded, this time.
Tony had aided his new friends, sorry,
“Of course.” Steve apologized, a flush spreading across his cheeks. He even had the audacity to appear
Except Tony
“Someone just landed.”
Which is what Tony was telling himself.
“I know!” Steve snapped, crossing his arms. Tony tried not to stare as his biceps bulged. This was not the time, Tony. It might never be the time, he added wryly.
Tony paused.
Along with one of him in a S.H.I.E.L.D suit.
over doing something so selfless. However, I’m not shocked. It wouldn’t be very Steve of you, otherwise.”
Steve gripped the hand GPS in his palm, his body almost relaxing at the weight from the outline. It held promise and spoke of the future.
“Tony, I’m sorry–“
Nothing everything needed flashing red bulbs and glitter to be considered art. That was something Tony had learned along the years; from personal experience and observing Steve’s own style of artistry.
“Landing shortly, Stark.” Thor assured him. The blond’s appearance had been such a shock to Tony.
Tony nodded shakily as his other hand fumbled to grip Steve’s hand.
“I’m not worthy of you!” Tony trembled under Steve’s touch. His voice had risen in volume, his tone cracking.
Tony held the photo album firmly to his chest, his fingers gripping the corners as he left the warmth of Steve’s side. He could now begin to feel the energy of the portal washing over him. The way it almost felt like static electricity. The smell of ozone.
“Missed you.” Steve yawned, nosing his way into the crook of Tony’s neck. He pressed a chaste kiss there, once, and then twice before pausing to rest. The blond’s arm snaked around Tony’s waist, interlocking with one another to encircle him. “Hate waking up without you.”
The silence was almost as deafening as their previous argument. For once, Tony was glad to have a reason to escape from the room and get away from Steve. It was sad, but it was true. The brunet just felt too defeated to sit in silence any longer.
He didn’t know if his voice cracked from the obvious heated stare that had just been directed at him, or from the prospect of returning to a world sans Steve. Perhaps it’s a mixture of the two, he conceded, almost hysterically. Only Tony would find himself in a situation like so.
A seizure.
His lungs feeling tight.
Nebula sent Rocket a pointed look.
His nose wrinkled as fresh air began wafting in. Tony instinctively tensed up as raised voices emerged, sounding concerned and questioning all at once. His ears pricked, lips pursed as he mentally prepared himself just before he reached the bottom platform. Solid ground, thankful.
“Very sound reasoning.” Tony agreed, taking a measured sip from his mug. Which Steve had prepared and waiting in the microwave before sliding into the brunet’s hands.
“Be quiet,” Tony spoke hoarsely, his fingers raising to course through Steve’s fine hair. Steve relaxed, seemingly taking the touch as a sign of forgiveness. Tony didn’t have it in him to argue or speak out. Instead, he basked in the warmth pressed against him. He recalled the last time he was given the chance to lay his head against this chest. Except, it had been bare that time. The sound of life had been trumming through Steve’s veins. His heart beating. Blood pumping as his gentle lips pressed scorching kisses into his sun tanned skin. They mapped against him, idly trailing up and down.
He had family, friends, and plans to attend to. The genius knew he should start strategizing now. The team needed Tony to be quick on his feet and even quicker with his thoughts. The fate of the world relied on everyone working together to find a solution for this outcome. He needed to get his thoughts in order.
Steve let out a humorless laugh.
“To each other.” Steve finished, his mouth already becoming occupied with nipping at the skin of Tony’s neck. “I’m gonna marry you.”
“There’s a time and place–“
But to each their own.
He guessed Nebula hadn’t wasted a second, then.
But where was the other Steve?
Tony nodded jerkily.
narrative?” Tony slapped his palms against the counter top. “Have you even stopped to consider our limited options? What this means, not only for us, but our family, Steve? I wouldn’t be doing this if I didn’t feel powerless. I’m trying to keep this family together. Trying to keep a semblance of control. For Peter.” The brunet stressed the ending, his eyes growing damp as his voice cracked. “We promised to make responsible decisions once we considered adoption. We– we made a vow, Steve. And now we’re being forced to make a decision that will not only impact him, but the world.”
“Honey bear,” Tony tossed out a leer, pinching Rhodey’s side. “Keep greeting me like that and a fella will get ideas.”
Steve. But then. The peppermint.”
What the brunet didn’t know...
wanted to hug him.
The first detail Tony made out would be image of his own eyes gazing back at him. It was almost shocking, even. His first instinct had been to make a witty crack at a replica of himself being framed in a prestigious gallery for all to see.
The stones, in which, were missing from Thanos’ own gauntlet.
Tony could pinpoint the exact moment Steve faltered; and then seemed to deflate all at once. Unsurprisingly, it didn’t leave the brunet feeling victorious. Quite the opposite, actually. He never wanted to shout glory over Steve’s obvious loss. Could this even be something one could win?
The brunet couldn’t even be bothered to react to the sound of the bowl of blueberries falling to the floor. He was stunned, to say the least. Tony knew he had great technology; after all, he was the designer. But he couldn’t actually believe he had managed to secure a location on one James Barnes.
He smothered the grin threatening to break out, pressing his lips into a thin line as he did so. Tony couldn’t help but spare a second glance at his ring, dropping the spoon in order to stretch his hand outward, his fingers spreading.
“I–“ Steve faltered, a deep silence passing by before he sighed in defeat. “You’re right. But I didn’t–“ The blond had to pause in order to compose himself. “I didn’t
Tony’s eyes traced the youth of Steve’s face, shuttering briefly before forcing himself to focus. They had a battle to win.
“Hey. Tony, I know.” Steve stepped forward, his hands cupping the older Tony’s cheeks, his thumb wiping the stray tears. “I know that you wouldn’t ask. I’m saying... I know I’m not him. That’s proven. You’re preparing to leave to return to a world without him. But I have his memories and the experiences, Tony. And you have to know, he loved you. No matter what may have happened, or may not have been cleared up. Don’t carry this grief around with you, he’d want you to be happy. To not- to not blame yourself.”
It didn’t make it less daunting.
Tony laughed softly, his lips pressing into a thin line to hide his smile as his hands trailed over Steve’s shoulder in order to intertwine behind his head. His eyes briefly met Steve’s own, breaking into a smile at the look of awe plastered across the Captain’s face.
. But how long did it take for them to get that news? Had Tony been left alone while he waited for the verdict regarding Steve’s health? Steve loathed to think that the billionaire had been worried over him. On if he’d survive the energy from the gauntlet. If he’d ever wake up.
Tony braced himself against the wall.
Steve had let himself down, too.
“Just my luck,” Tony groaned once again, wincing as the bright lights blurred his vision. Had it all been a dream? Was there a fight in... Was it New York? Was he back at the tower or was it the compound? Where was–
He sniffed.
“I am home.” Steve reached down to grasp his wrist, his thumb idly tracing over the skin where Tony’s soul wrist lay.
with his circumstances being dire and such.
Which is the exact reason Tony found himself sitting alone in the kitchen with a cup of coffee at eleven at night. It wasn’t necessarily a good idea to leave the genius to his thoughts, especially when it concerned such a pressing matter. But he had been left with little options. He had one shot at this, and he sure as hell hoped his aim would be on spot.
He could breathe.
would be aboard. Because... if he wasn’t? Steve didn’t know what he would do.
The sensation felt like nothing Tony had ever experienced, and he had been on the receiving end of a few pretty great hugs. Take Thor and Rhodey for example. But their embraces didn’t cause any reaction like.... this.
had flashed across the TV screen in his room. Steve grinned into his pillow before falling back to sleep.
He was still upset.
“Oh, is he, Captain?” Tony crossed his arms. “Do you not feel well?”
He knew Steve like the back of his hand. So, Tony knew the blond would 100% agree with the brunet’s way of thinking if he knew his own idea would fail and put everything at risk. It was just... the small chance it wouldn’t. The off chance that maybe they could fight this was what kept Steve going.
Tony’s eyes traced the outline of the blond’s pectorals, his eyes rising as Steve lifted his arm. His mouth shut with an abrupt click as his heart dropped. He finally began to understand Steve’s dramatic entrance.
” He breathed, his mouth curling up into a smile as the blond surged up. Tony spared a second to send a prayer for Steve’s lack of regard towards his joints and knees.
“Minor!” Tony cackled, throwing his head back, “You hid all my underwear before my first date with him! Which, by the way, was convenient since it made it easier afterwards–“
Steve. How is this possible?
“I–“ Tony could hear the way Peter faltered. It was an unspoken rule to not discuss anything that had happened fifteen years ago, and then some. All of it was off topic, at least around Tony. The billionaire was known to even leave the room.
“My eyes are up here.” Tony snapped his fingers, rolling his eyes at Steve’s ‘aw, shucks, me?’ look.
But Peter wasn’t here. And neither were his pop culture references. Instead, Tony was standing in a room surrounded by people he had once trusted. And he couldn’t wrap his head around it.
“Not because we argued.” Tony continued. “But... we always made a great team. And you’ve always believed so strongly. I did admire that about you. Even when we opposed each other.”
“For my sister,” Nebula spoke up, coming to a stop besides Rocket. Her typical neutral facade broke, her expression resembling one of loss and grief. Tony looked away.
“I don’t think I remember your eyes being this blue,” Tony slurred, his gaze wondering across Steve’s face. A red flush soon spread across the Captain’s cheeks. He just noticed that Steve was actually closer than he seemed. Steve’s brow furrowed as he opened his mouth, no sound coming out due to Tony abruptly going lax in his hold, succumbing to his injuries. Maybe when he woke up Steve would still be there.
Tony sprawled across the wall, allowing his weight to rest on it as opposed to Steve. The blond was very attentive, in a way that often left the brunet breathless and pliant. Steve enjoyed taking his time and unraveling the smaller man. When his mouth wasn’t plastered to Tony’s neck in an attempt to leave dark bruises splotched across his skin, his hands were roaming his sides as his dark ears bore into Tony’s own.
of his friends, in defeating Thanos.
“Bweakfast!” Peter cheered, clambering into Tony’s arms as the billionaire began to stand. “What we have for bweakfast? Pizza?”
The sight of Steve’s upper torso being exposed would’ve caused anyone to become speechless. Combine that with, well, a massive lifelong crush on the guy, and. Maybe you could see why Tony found himself struggling. He couldn’t help but gape at the way Steve flexed his arms before turning to the side.
He took a few measured steps closer, his arms cautiously held out in front of him. The armor was practically itching to come out.
The genius allowed himself to be soothed by the ministrations involved in setting up the machine. It was familiar; something needed for a distraction. Tony felt scrambled, his thoughts and feelings jumbling together due to being so far out of his comfort zone. It was hard to pretend everything was fine when it obviously wasn’t.
“Our surgeons have guaranteed that the process was minimally invasive,” Shuri nodded politely, “A simple in and out procedure. With a few pints of blood infusions.”
if that’s what it could be called. It was just... it was important to Tony, okay? He needed Peter to be aware that he would always have his dad’s attention. That Tony would always listen, no matter how young. He couldn’t let his disagreement with Steve come between that.
Steve’s hand reached up, his fingers skimming across Tony’s bruised lip. He exhaled before dropping his arms by his side, offering Tony a hesitant smile.
“Two Steve’s on the battlefield.”
“Hey,” he muttered, “How’s a guy supposed to know...”
Tony nodded slowly, smiling wryly, “So just like that? I forgive him?”
dramatic.
“Steve,” Tony whispered forlornly, his eyes filling up with tears. He moved out of Thor’s grasp, tripping as he lost his balance.
“I don’t– Steve.” Tony sighed, half wanting to pull away and hide while the other part wanted to get one last hug. The first in fifteen years. “What are you saying?”
“Eat.”
The billionaire must have sensed his crumbling control; he deepened the kiss even as his own hands clutched at Steve’s. He  very purposely placed one on his lower backside and the other on the side of his neck.
Steve stared back, unimpressed. But then again, that almost seemed to be his default expression around the genius. Tony was  used to it, especially after so long.
Please make sure to leave me kudos and comments! :)
He hadn’t even noticed everyone leaving.
“By who,” Nebula finished, nodding curtly, “It’s not my story to tell. I’d get your friend patched up. And fast. It could be blood poisoning of some type. I’m no doctor.”
Tony’s breathing stopped.
Steve lightly nudged Tony forward, his hand spreading out along the small of the brunet’s back. The billionaire spared half a second wishing for the red on his cheeks to go away. But it was useless. It was just how things.... were. Steve would always cause such a reaction from Tony.
The metallic flavor slowly flooded his taste buds. Dread filled him as he quickly made the connection that he wasn’t bleeding. Steve hadn’t suffered any internal injuries, nor any external ones that would call for blood filling his mouth. And even so, Steve knew. There wasn’t any blood actually in
Tony Stark felt like
It hadn’t been like this for quite some time. They had made up, somewhat, of course. The trust had been reinstalled. The dependency. The unity. But their personal relationship was... lacking. Their friendship, not so much. But they hadn’t been this. Not since.. not since Steve let Tony down.
Tony paused, his breath hitching.
“What you could lose.” Tony finished for his younger self. His tone was quiet, but understanding.
Tony felt overwhelmed.
Because they had taken on Thanos together, and got the job done. It went without saying; anything Steve and Tony stood behind, united, would come to pass. They were a force to be reckoned with.
But if Steve had taught Tony one thing, it had been a simple lesson. It was never too late to change, to make things right.
“I’m greying, Rogers, not dying.”
A week after he’d come out of the ice, Steve had found himself awakened by the taste of coffee flooding his mouth. At three in the morning. A few minutes later, he’d find a sheepish Tony working in the laboratory. Steve had laughed before heading back up to bed. But not before brushing his teeth. With
“Then we’ll do this. Together.” Tony nodded jerkily, the last bit sounding offhanded. Almost like an afterthought. But the two of them working together had never been a second option, no.
And there.
Tony couldn’t stop the tears from pooling in his eyes or the way he began to rapidly blink in an attempt to shoo them away. He hadn’t even noticed when he began to cry. He just knew Steve was becoming blurry and his throat felt tight.
It was in this moment as Tony reached down grab a fallen toy that he met Steve’s eye. The blue eyes conveyed peace and love. Tony, for the first time since being told of the Accords, felt peace. He knew his husband would be on his side. All they had left to do was tell the team.
Oh, how wrong he had been.
“Enjoying the view.” Steve supplied, a hint of a smug smile tugging at the corner of his lips. He stood in the doorway of the kitchen before stepping further into the room, leaning over the counter top. His eyes shamelessly traced over the brunet’s figure as he rested his arms across the granite. “It is a nice view.”
“How thoughtful, boss.” Friday replied, her tone sounding suspiciously dry.
________
He wanted to pull Steve into his arms and hug him so tightly until it felt like everything would be okay. The brunet had to maintain some sense of control, though. He was afraid to give in so easily or perhaps, even to find himself giving Steve too hard of a time. Was there a proper procedure for this? Tony needed a How-To-Accept-Your-Soulmate’s-Apology-After-He-Broke-Your-Heart-And-Ran-Away-With-Half-Of-Your-Friends for Dummies book.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony glanced towards the coffee machine anxiously. He really needed a distraction. This topic was beginning to turn in a direction he wasn’t quite yet comfortable discussing.
“That’s good, I’m glad to hear it,” Steve nodded quickly, seeming distracted as he glanced around nervously, “I– Could we talk?”
“Tony,” Steve spoke up, the sound of his voice causing Tony to hold his breath. “You don’t have to do this.”
“‘Ada!” The sound jarred the pair from their thoughts. Tony’s eyes flickered to the baby’s face, his lips threatening to twitch at the sight of a disgruntled Peter. The child’s lip curled up, pursing in frustration. He has obviously grown far too tired of not receiving their attention when they had both been so close.
The brunet froze in his seat, mouth falling open as his eyes flickered up to the right to an exasperated Steve. A Steve who was currently still none the wiser, as his position in the room prevented him from seeing the screens.
Steve bent down, lifting his hand to cup Tony’s cheek as he connected their mouths for the first time in years. Tony deflated, his body melting in Steve’s grasp. His arms locked behind Steve’s head, his mouth devouring Steve’s own. Taking what was offered.
He swallowed and turned the corner.
Steve stared down at him, his mop of hair disheveled. Tony lifted a shaky hand, his fingers pushing back the few strands of hair blocking those blue eyes. Steve leaned into his touch, the ghost of a smile haunting those oh-so-familiar lips.
“Yes, that would be the one,” Steve silently urged him on.
It had been irritating Tony for the last few days. He had initially thought it was from his imminent death. It wasn’t unusual for a mark to have such a reaction when one half of a soul pair were close to reaching an untimely death. It was a harsh way of the opposing soulmate to understand their other half was dying. It was supposed to offer relief, according to researchers.
He swallowed.
“We?” Tony managed to ask.
“Yes, Daddy is so silly isn’t he?” Steve’s voice rang out, the soft lilt causing Peter to flash the blond a toothy smile.
It was exactly what the brunet had feared. Steve was already beginning to think in he vs. them. He wasn’t looking at the picture as the Avengers vs. the United Nations. He saw it as Tony being on the side of the enemy. He didn’t understand that they all needed to be on par with each other if they wanted this to work. They needed to have each other’s backs.
Steve pressed into the kiss, his hand clutching at Tony’s ass. He jerked the brunet forward, his left hand gripping the billionaire’s neck in order to maintain his hold on the smaller being. Tony’s mouth was wet and hot. Steve couldn’t help but quirk a small smirk at the sound’s of pleasure falling from the brunet’s mouth.
“Of course, Cap.” Tony nodded, sending him an appreciative smile. “Take care.”
“He’s downstairs, waiting in my lab. Bruce and Scott are stabilizing the portal in order to prepare it for your journey back.”
But Tony could hardly stand without someone’s assistance. He had been extremely grateful when Rhodey had aided him in sitting and buckling up. They explained Carol’s appearance, her back story with Fury, and how she had been summoned by the man before the Snap. The atmosphere had taken a much more somber tone as Rocket introduced himself and talked about being part of the Guardians; who were no more.
“I’ve never been good at it.” Steve admitted, stepping back after gripping either of Tony’s hands in his own. He began leading the smaller man into the living room, careful as he was guiding him with his own back turned. “But... dancing has just felt significant to me. Romance wise, I mean.”
Meeting the recipients of charities he invests in; a philanthropist.
“I can see it, you know.” Steve glanced up with a start, his eyes darting to the doorway, taking note of the occupancy of this room being lowered to two.
Steve just hoped that Tony was alright.
are the same. The only difference would be, well. My death. As far as Bruce knows, of course.”
“Friday, I think I’m in love.” Tony announced.
So maybe not a skrull, then.
“We did.” Tony confirmed. “I was only making an observation. You are from a different time. A time where I meet my untimely demise. As if there is a timely one.” The brunet scoffed at the end, pausing to mutter something under his breath.
favor.” Steve laughed humorlessly. The blond crossed his arms across his chest and for once, Tony didn’t find himself at all attracted to the display of strength.
His wide eyes stayed glued to the computer screen; tracing the distinguishable details that set Barnes apart from oblivious civilians. The shaggy haired man was innocently caught frequenting produce markets; his dark and worn clothing helping him blend in with the crowd.
The blond stared down at him, his bottom lip trembling as Tony’s thumb traced under his eye, swiping away a stray tear. “I don’t- I don’t-“
“You don’t mean that!” Peter called up to him, delight curling around his words.
“Mr. Stark.”
Tony swallowed, anxiously biting his chapped lips as his trembling limbs began to rise, hesitantly wrapping his arms around that all too familiar narrow waist. Steve tensed at first, which unfair. Because he had pulled Tony in first. He soon relaxed and buried his head in the crook of Tony’s neck, inhaling deeply. How long had it been since Tony showered? Two, three days? He showered the morning he found himself leaving earth.
Tony remembered. Oh, how he remembered walking into their room from a two day lab binge to realize Steve hadn’t made it to bed yet, either. His first instinct was to panic until he reassured himself that if something were to have happened, he would’ve been notified. But then he grew anxious. He worried if he had somehow did something to upset Steve. He threw caution to the wind and abandoned the doorway to make his way towards Steve’s floor.
“Hey, that’s okay, Cap.” Tony spoke with false bravado, his shoulders shrugging before he lifted his hand to wave it off. But Steve knew Tony, far too well.
The Captain clenched his eyes shut and the next time he opened them, he had shrunk down and disappeared through space with a zap. He hoped he wouldn’t have to come back... because that would mean one thing. It would mean failure.
“Wakandan technology is quite advanced, Doctor Stark,” Shuri smirked, raising her brow, “I’m told you go by Mr. Stark in terms of formalities. Quite peculiar for a man who has the right to use Doctor... It adds an air of superiority, wouldn’t you say?”
Steve wouldn’t allow it.
Rhodey stared after him with his hands on his hips, shaking his head. He idly wondered if having a flair for the dramatic came with the superhero package. Or maybe the complex just developed over time. He scowled as Tony began clapping, the sound breaking the silence in the now quiet room.
Happy.
The only sound audible in the lab would be the hesitant whirling coming from Dum-E. Tony didn’t know if he were thankful for the slight distraction or not. He didn’t know if it helped.
“Not sure,” Steve swallowed, adjusting the grip on his charge as he began hiking up a steep mound, “Felt some bandages alongside his upper abdomen.”
“You’re not dressed.” The taller man raised an expectant brow, crossing his arms.
Along either side were pictures framing countless different portrayals of Tony. The distinctions were quite clear, and clever, too. There was Tony donning the cherry red Iron Man armor, along with one of him dressed to the nines. The latter was obviously meant to show him rubbing elbows with fellow billionaire’s.
“Knock, knock.” Steve turned around to see Natasha leaning back against the open door. The agent stared at him, her face otherwise neutral.
“Oh, c’mon, guys,” Rhodey huffed, “We talked about this.”
Tony couldn’t save his Steve, but he had saved this one.
The blond pressed a chaste kiss to Tony’s hands, his eyes brimming with unshed tears as he did so. His lips continued to stay pressed there before he gradually shifted until the side of his face nuzzled against the brunet’s hands. He pulled back, his fingers peeling Tony’s calloused hands open before pressing his lips against the open palm.
Tony almost laughed. He had been carted off to space, trying to rescue a sorcerer. Yes, they exist. A sorcerer he just met, at that. Who was protecting an infinity stone that a genocide-craving alien was seeking to power a golden gauntlet. Or well, Thanos may be worse than anyone they’ve ever faced. All while that happened, the burner phone he carried around had been lost and found. And used, apparently.
nervous. He was acting the way he once did at the beginning of their relationship. Trying to keep up a conversation. Fidgeting in his seat. Desperately trying to find ways to relate to Tony. But Tony didn’t need them then. And he didn’t need them now, either.
Everything went dark.
Tony stepped off the platform, tears trailing down his face as he allowed himself to be embraced by his own Steve.
When had they matured?
“I suppose this is it.” Tony glanced around, his eyes burning the room into his memory. The room full of friends who could barely stand up, but they were together and whole. Happy. Tired and exhausted, but accomplished.
Tony didn’t know if he could have ever prepared himself for this. There was no warning. No indication. Nothing but radio silence on Steve’s end for two years and what... he still loves him? It didn’t sound realistic to Tony. And yet, he heard it with his own ears.
Steve’s lips quirked up into a smile at that, his focus turning back to the stove. All seemed well, at least, it would to most.
Steve had never lied directly to Tony, especially with spoken words. Tony didn’t think any version of Steve could lie to someone’s face. Maybe by omission, but.... never to his face. His delicate sensibilities couldn’t handle it. Tony wanted to laugh at the thought.
“I did a lot of thinking last night. This morning.” Steve shrugged jerkily, his eyes staying cast downward. “I–I see where you’re coming from now. I do. I can’t lose this either.” The blond glanced up then, Tony’s breath getting stuck in his throat as he was met with Steve’s tear brimmed eyes. “Tony, I
Every warm feeling in Tony’s body seemed to turn to ice. Dread began to quickly replace the sensation of calm that started to fill him. Just as soon as he thought everything would be okay, he was doused with the cold smack of reality.
Because Steve put his foot in his mouth, again.
Tony climbed the steps after the blond, faltering briefly as his mind processed the words. “Wait. What do you mean it’s not–“ The brunet cut himself off, brow furrowing in confusion as Steve pushes the studio door open to reveal an empty room.
The blond let out a shuddering sigh, his left hand trailing down his face as he did so. It was disconcerting to see such emotion portrayed on the usual composed face of Steve Rogers.
“This, uh, next exhibit.” Steve nervously cleared his throat as he jerked his head to the left. “It’s new.” The blond didn’t need a sixth sense to be aware of the onslaught of confusion beginning to radiate off Tony. Which is exactly why he forced himself to steamroll ahead. “I was kinda hoping you would close your eyes before it’s revealed?”
Maybe it was the way his eyes watched a version of his friends embrace one another. The way they shared a drink and fell into one another after it was obvious Thanos would be no more. The hidden, secret glances that Steve and Tony seemed to share periodically.
“You’re... you keep me on my toes, Tony. You’re everything I’ve ever needed or wanted, even before I knew that. You’ve always just– stirred such passion in me.” The blond let out a wet laugh, his eyes brimmed red. “I don’t see a day without you by my side or at my back. You keep me in line and you don’t– you don’t take my shit.”
Rhodey slid a plate towards him.
Tony broke from his thoughts, a chuckle passing his lips as the alternate version of himself passed him a water. The younger Tony seemed tired, too. But it was the kind of tired that had come with the end of a long battle. The tired from losing sleep. Worrying. Stress. Exhaustion. Tony knew that tired too well.
“Together,” Tony recited, squeezing his eyes shut as the bed dipped. Steve rolled over, leaning over Tony’s chest to prop himself up with one arm. Tony dropped his own arms and let them rest by his sides, his brown eyes searching Steve’s own gaze.
“Maybe?” Tony scoffed. Now they were getting somewhere. Calling Steve out? This is something he could handle. “You- you tore the team apart! And for what? To feed into the mighty ‘Captain America, freedom and justice for all’ agenda?”
He stepped back, his palm sliding along the shoulder blades of his younger self before squeezing his right shoulder. He offered him a few pats before slipping away, his legs taking him down the stairs and towards the lab.
“Stop frowning.” Tony tugged his arm free in order to flick the blond’s upper lip. He chuckled as Steve’s forced an obvious fake smile. “We have all the time in the world to teach you how to dance.”
“See what?”
Steve stumbled forward, hesitating as Tony’s bloodshot eyes snapped to him, the billionaire flinching back and hunching into himself. He only slightly relaxed as he seemed to realize it was Steve standing before him. Steve’s heart hurt at the reaction; Tony was still on high alert. Steve’s mind raced, wondering exactly what had happened to him.
How could he?
With loss, Tony summed up. Losing Steve... it seemed to age everyone twice as fast as usual. The mirth was gone. They had lost people before, sure. But it felt surreal. It was like being a kid and believing your parents knew how to fix everything. You never thought you’d see the day in which they
“Fuck that.” Rhodey scowled, flicking the smaller man’s forehead. “You’re giving me grey hair, Tones. Grey.”
The child preened under Tony’s praise, his face lighting up with pure unadulterated joy. It was hard to not miss. The billionaire’s heart ached at the sight, for once feeling like he was making the right decision. Peter would grow up knowing he was loved and cherished.
So the blond told him. He opened his mouth and words began to spew out. He shared the secret he had been carrying with him since he and Tony stole the tesseract and Pym particles in 1970. The only difference this time was... Steve shared of the extra particles he had stored away. How they came in handy later after the battle.. after Tony had died.
“I apologize, sir.” Friday broke through. “It appears as if the top alert regarding my search perimeters has been triggered. Systems are downloading and coming to view now.”
Steve pinched the skin around Tony’s hip, huffing as the brunet let out a squawk of disapproval. “We’re on
It didn’t matter how long it’s been since the renewal of their relationship. Tony would never protest the idea of being
The brunet swallowed, internally laughing at the thought.
“...can’t just barge in, Stark..”
Thank you for reading.
The symbol lay on the inside of Steve’s bicep. It was neat, the dark color contrasting strongly against the pale skin. It made for a breath taking sight, actually. It looked like art. The mark seemed too neat, too photogenic, too
“I love you.” Tony spoke softly, his eyelids fluttering as he began nipping Steve’s bottom, pressing wet kisses to the corner of the blond’s mouth. The gesture was so soft, so delicate that it caused tears to well up in Steve’s eyes.
“What can I help you with, Capsicle?” Tony forced a smile, spreading his arms as he hesitantly opened his eyes.
No danger.
The brunet snapped his eyes upward, repulsers whirling in a frenzy. His wide eyes met Steve’s own, his mouth parting just as Steve ripped the Stark made gauntlet from his suit.
Tony began to pull away, hesitating briefly as his palm cupped the side of Steve’s face. His expression appeared torn before he shrugged. “Ah, to hell with it. Maybe this one won’t give me too much of a hard time. I mean, it’s not technically cheating..” he trailed off.
Tony broke into laughter, his fingers trailing up to grip at the collar of Steve’s shirt. “That was awful.”
The alarm was never set for Saturday. Tony didn’t understand why Steve would do such a thing, especially without even informing Tony of their apparent plans for the day. He began to briefly ponder, wracking his mind for anything to justify such a thing. His thoughts were disrupted at the sound of the bedroom door slowly creeping open.
“Uh, no, listen, son–“
After all, they were used to always being in each other’s corners. It’s who they were. It’s what made them Steve and Tony.
? Should I be apologizing?” He laughed weakly at the end.
Steve found himself at loss for words.
The brunet in question kept on walking, even as his Steve stopped alongside Sam and Bucky. Tony jogged up the incline, not even slowing down once he was within arm’s length.
But then... he faltered just as the pitter patter sound of feet reached the front porch. His torso twisted in the direction of the noise just as Steve pulled back, both of them expectantly waiting for the door to open. It came slowly, the sound of a body colliding into it causing the brunet to wince. But then the screen door shoved open, but only briefly. The springs and gravity caused the door to be tugged backwards, as the weight against it wasn’t strong enough to force it open.
“Thank you, Tony.” Steve nodded jerkily. “It means a lot. Honest.”
The silence that surrounded them felt as if it were filled with static electricity. Tony felt childish for even thinking it, but he couldn’t help but imagine the smallest spark causing them both to erupt into flames. Everything just felt so... intense. Exciting. Promising.
At first, once the taste of blood had faded, Steve couldn’t taste anything except cotton. His mouth felt claustrophobic. It tasted like a barren wasteland. And then he made out the flavor of salt. Not table salt, Steve
“I love you.” Steve spoke, his forehead pressing against Tony’s own as he lowered himself to the brunet’s height. The genius couldn’t ignore the stray tears beginning to fall from the blond’s eyes.

“Maybe he’s not really up...” The sound of Bucky’s hesitant voice interrupted the Captain’s thoughts. The Sergeant cut off abruptly, Steve’s eyes flickering up to witness Tony send Bucky a withering look.
“For what I believed in! I’ve always struggled with trusting the Government, and you knew that. You knew I had valid reasons. At the moment it seemed like it was either with them or against them. But now I see that you were one step ahead. You were playing your cards close. I’m not afraid to admit I was wrong, not anymore,” Steve rose to his feet, scowling, “You think I wanted to go against you? That I wanted to be at odds with you of all people?”
“C’mon, Punk. Don’t do this.”
Steve clenched his hand into a fist. It took everything in his power to keep from striking the wall. He could read between the lines. They didn’t think he was emotionally stable enough. He wondered if this was how Bruce felt when trying to control his rage. He let out a ragged breath, turning away in order to hide his reaction.
Tony nodded amicably, a ghost of a smile on his face as she gave him one last searching look before exiting the room. He exhaled, peering at his abdomen as it was projected onto the opposite wall. The stab wound was quite peculiar, the surgeons had informed him. They’ve never seen anything quite like it. He laughed darkly. Yeah, because he had built it himself. And proceeded to get stabbed with his own technology. Although... it certainly wouldn’t be the first time something he made was used against him. Or the last, probably.
Steve laughed, his blond hair swooping into his face as his chest shook. He stepped closer, tilting his head down. “I think you still have it in you. You did well out in the field, especially for your age.” The last part was added with a smirk.
“Till the end.” Tony confirmed, running a hand through his greying hair.
“Well, yeah,” Tony furrowed his brow in confusion, “Alien invasion 2.0 in New York? Wizards, Bruce, galore? Ring a bell?”
Steve huffed, his actions contradicting themselves as he shot both of them a fond look. “We’re allowed to... indulge.”
He considered getting it trademarked, but figured it was something Steve might not be too keen on.
He did whatever it took to make things right.
country out of 117 who demand our compliance.” Tony clenched his hands into fists. “It’s not unwarranted. The international community is concern over our previous actions. Unapproved missions. The way we’re able to face no the repercussions regarding the Avengers' actions. We face no consequence.”
“Peter.” Tony’s brows shot up, worry gnawing at his conscience. He hadn’t even thought that his friends and family would assume the worst at his disappearance. They must be sick with worry, especially if Peter were to drop everything to be in Tony’s house.
The brunet didn’t feel right labeling it as such. This wasn’t something that could be settled in a contest or even a cheap debate. It required maturity and understanding. It called for individuals to sacrifice their control for the greater good.
did."
Tony slumped back, crossing his arm over his eyes as he exhaled. He couldn’t believe Steve was making him do this..,
Steve turned, his narrowed eyes meeting the shocked ones of Thanos from across the field.
He shoved the metal door aside, inwardly cringing at the loud groan of protest it gave out as he began to slide into view. Or, hobble. Because let’s be honest, he wasn’t smoothly walking anywhere anytime soon. His once tense shoulders seemed to slump in relief as his feet began to make contact with the grass. Green. The ground was green. Because that’s what it should look like. Not barren, like whatever Titan– No. Too soon.
Not on his watch.
Tony tilted his head to the side, trying to subtly peer up at the blond in question. As if he could just sense the billionaire’s stare, Steve turned and offered him a soft smile. Tony couldn’t help but send one back. It was out of his hands, and he couldn’t be held guilty even if this was Skrull Steve. He most certainly would do all of his bidding and rob SHIELD blind, as long as Steve’s face kept looking at him like that.
“Well, yeah,” Tony shrugged, seeming suddenly uncomfortable, “I’ve just never really been one for.. that.” He shuffled his feet and glanced around the sterile room for a distraction.
“I know, I know.” Steve huffed. “It’s not exactly your usual hangout.”
Tony glanced back at the kitchen, pursing his lips as heads quickly swiveled away. So maybe the living room was not the best spot to talk. But, could Tony handle being alone with Steve? Would he be able to stand his ground? He feared he would crumble as soon as he found himself cornered with only Steve there as a witness. Did he even have another option? He eventually made his decision and stood.
“That’s what I’m–
“Eggs.” Steve motioned towards the pan. “Scrambled? Over easy?”
“Oh?” Tony tried to keep his breathing at an even pace. He could handle this. He could keep his emotions in check.
suspicious.
Everything was silent except for the sound of wind being produced by the ship as it came to a rest on the ground. It felt like time was being slowed down as they waited. Waited to see who was on the ship. If they were friend or foe. The anticipation was eating Steve alive.
He couldn’t breathe.
He told of the hair brained idea of using the extra particles when he returned the stones to their rightful time. The way he went back to 1970 and met Peggy and told her of his happiness. And how he lost it. The way she had moved on. And then he how zapped back to 2023, only minutes before what would have been Tony’s death. And stopped it.
His head rose, eyes meeting Steve’s own. The blond offered him a soft smile, his gaze tearing away from Tony’s to politely decline Peter’s insistence at him taking a bite of the toddler’s gummy mushed up... food. If that’s what you could call it.
Tony could allow himself to give his heart away. He could let himself have this. Because... because Steve
His mouth faltered before shutting with a snap. He- he couldn’t even humor the idea. It wouldn’t be fair. Two Steve’s coexisting? There had to be a law against that. Somewhere, maybe, he thought almost hysterically.
“Flattery will get you nowhere.” Tony deadpanned, his faux annoyance breaking as a yawn fell past his lips. He half heartedly motioned toward the bedside table, at the alarm. “What’s the meaning of this, Rogers?”
“What about...” Steve lowered his voice, “Us?”
Tony loved him.
“Yeah.” He spoke slowly, his eyes beginning to harden. “Why do you sound so... shocked?”
left!” Tony shoved his finger in Steve’s chest, his face crumpling. He couldn’t take it. Steve was so close and the room felt like it was shrinking. Tony half associated that with Steve’s hulking form towering over him. Either way, it was impossible for him to maintain his cool façade.
, Tony cursed.
“Tony.” Steve stressed his name. Tony inwardly winced at the emotion pouring through that one word. He could make out the exhaustion in the blond’s tone.
“Oooh, Rogers.” Steve hummed, his eyes glinting mischievously as he carefully crossed the room to lower himself to the bed. “Only good things come from the use of my last name.”
Tony may have been old, but he wasn’t fearless. Especially when it concerned baring his emotions to a certain blond. Steve would always have that sense of control over Tony; no matter the version.
Golden hair blocked his sight.
The blond stared up at Tony, unblinking. His blue eyes traced the outline of the older man’s face, a small smile beginning to tug at the corner of his lips. Tony looked... alive. He was obviously going through exhaustion, but he was okay. He was in one piece. And by the looks of it... he had all his limbs.
More than.
Steve blinked and tore his sight from this version of himself, shaking his head before focusing his gaze back to Tony.
His fingers began to trail across the platform he laid on, a frown tugging at his lips at the touch of cotton. Bed sheets. His hand clutched at the material, eyes beginning to blink rapidly as he realized he was on a bed.
The annoyingly loud sound of the bedside alarm was not how Tony wished to wake up. He preferred much more convincing demonstrations... say, Steve between his legs. He could feel himself beginning to smile at the thought. But alas, that was not the case for this morning.
He had died.
flavored toothpaste.
“Do you trust me?”
Steve weakly swatted hands away. He shook his head, trying to indicate that he would be okay. They didn’t need to focus on him. Not now. Not as they fought for the good of humanity. Steve was just one person.They couldn’t afford to lose focus on the main task: protecting Vision and the Mind Stone.
Tony pursed his lips, settling back against the pillows. The situation didn’t seem as amusing anymore. “Something happened. Tell me.”
according to scientist. A way for someone to be able to know their search for their soulmate would be useless, as they were dead.
The silence was resounding; the sight of the spoken words beginning to settle in. Steve knew what he was signing up the moment he decided to go back into the past. He knew. And he would be able to live with this.
Peter’s laughter soon filled the kitchen. It was soft and created a peaceful aura that the two adults desperately needed. The trio had migrated to the couch in the living room, Peter child plopped between the two. He gurgled as he lay in a reclining position, his hands gripping the toys Tony had given him.
“Isn’t that.. what we’re doing?” Tony chose his words carefully.
The infinity gauntlet felt impossibly scorching from where his right hand lay encased in it.
Tony’s heart broke at Steve’s evident caution. Tony understood consent, he did. But they never had to ask before. A tear rolled down his cheek at their current predicament.
“We’re getting married.” Tony broke away, whimpering at the sight of Steve’s flushes face and glistening lips.
The grey in his hair seemed more pronounced than ever. It contrasted quite nicely with the patches of dark that appeared to be clinging to his roots. It was amusing to think that a part of him was still holding onto his youth, even if barely.
“Steve.. Steve? Are you with me?”
It was quiet, aside from the small hitch in Steve’s breathing. Tony continued his small actions of comfort, beginning to trace patterns into the smooth skin of Steve’s arm.
“Dark chocolate?” He called out, securing his grip on his mug before pulling the screen door open. “Papa. What did we say on vacation?”
His arm gave out and then there was the sensation of his torso flattening against the ground. Steve could barely make sense of the yells and desperate tones hovering above him. But this feeling? This... he knew far too well.
The time with Bruce and the Hulk, or even when he had managed to convince Thor to test out– okay so maybe Tony could see where Steve was coming from. But it didn’t make him feel any better.
“Hey, not so quick.” Tony’s voice piped up, his small frame pushing through the crowd despite his size. Steve figured it may have helped in regards to the hulking blond mass leading the way for him.
“What does this have to do with anything?” Tony’s breath caught at the way Steve said relationship. He was trying to move past it, but the word kept echoing in his head.
“So no bully?” Peter’s eyes peered up at him hopefully. Tony’s heart clenched. He would move planets for this kid.
The primary concern Steve had was if Tony was okay. The genius had obviously been bleeding due to internal damages. And if everyone’s assumptions right, Tony had flown into space. Steve wondered if Tony had anyone left with him.
Steve fell to the ground, his limbs weakening as Thanos’ army began to overtake him. The monstrous creatures were piling on top of him; the only protection his face had were the shields on both of his arms. He could feel the sense of hopelessness creeping up on him. It was a gradual process. The sound of growls filled the air, echoed along with grunts and muffled cries.
“Uncle Rhodey is no bully!” Peter finished, gasping in realization. The billionaire nodded in turn, leaning down to press a kiss to the child’s cheek.
Tony had been missed, that much was evident.
Tony landed in his desolate laboratory with a thump. He winced as the pain of the fall shot through him. That would surely leave a bruise, he thought to himself. He slowly rose to his feet, glancing at his desk before placing the photo album atop of it.
Tony. For good. So he reached out, plastering either of his hands on each side of the blond’s hair. He stifled a small laugh as Steve curled an arm around his waist, pulling him against the Captain’s broad chest.
It felt like a loaded question, and Steve was none the wiser to the internal warfare going on in his husband’s mind. The answer should have been simple. Tony should’ve declined and immediately began breaking the news to the super soldier. After all, it’s what he would’ve wanted and expected from Steve if he were in his shoes.
It had always been what Tony strived for. Presenting a united front. Showcasing a sense of teamwork.
The Avengers were on break, so things were slow. Clint was spending time with his family, Bruce was working on his next PhD, Thor was off world, and Natasha was prioritizing several nonprofit organizations for women and children.
Oh, how Steve didn’t know of the heroes to come. Tony pauses briefly, his mind whirling. Perhaps he should inform him of– no, he waved the thought off. It might not be wise to tell this Steve of future events. Who knows how that could alter the dimension?
All he felt was Steve’s steady hand trailing down to grip his waist, his left palm wrapping around his hip as his opposing hand stayed covering the brunet’s eyes.
But still.
you. You know that, right?
“Tony!” Bruce rose, his cry halting the surrounding conversations, “It’s good to see you walking.”
“That?” Tony pointed towards the spot Steve previously occupied before motioning towards Rhodey, “Now that was a show. I’ll give it to you. Don’t even think I’ve ever had him that flustered.”
________
The final blow.
standing alongside a version of himself from a different universe.
“Take care of yourself.” Tony whispered, as if he were afraid to break the cocoon of peace around them.
Steve nodded and crossed his arms.
Facts didn’t matter. Tony couldn’t even think of how it had been fifteen years. The passing of time was evident. It was a trademark on the world. Everyone and everything was moving forward and changing. The only change Tony saw would be when he looked in the mirror to see the rapid production of silver hair.
The blond was right. They had prioritized down time once Peter’s adoption had been finalized. Heroing slowed down for the both of them, especially Tony. They both worked as consultants for SHIELD and would always be on call if the time came where the world needed them again. But they were no longer the first ones sent out to deal with the weekly villain.
He surged forward, his fingers gripping the material at Steve’s shoulders. It was like something gave. Steve’s tense form relaxed, his body curling down into the position he had grown the utmost familiar with. Tony leaned up on the tip of his toes, pausing just before connected their lips. He could feel Steve’s breath fan across his face as his arms reached down and encased Tony’s smaller form. Tony shivered as Steve’s hands clutched at his waist. Steve squeezed his hip.
Steve jumped to his feet, jerking his head in the universal acknowledgment of ‘follow me.’ Hell, Tony would still follow him anywhere, wouldn’t he? Tony made a point of not allowing himself to look back towards the kitchen. He knew everyone was attempting to subtly watch, and he really didn’t want to see what they were thinking.
The moment the Accords had been introduced to Tony, he knew trouble would be on the horizon. He wasn’t sure exactly how things would play out, but he expected the absolute worst. After all, how could he not? Combined with Steve’s unyielding backbone and a no nonsense attitude towards the U.S Government, and well, it was a
The genius wasn’t exactly expecting company, obviously. Not to mention, Thor had been one of the last few people Tony had hoped to find him. It wasn’t that he didn’t have faith or trust in the God of Thunder, but Thor hadn’t been on Earth in quite some time. Tony didn’t think Thor had even known he was
Tony squeezed his eyes shut, his hands clenching into fists at his aides. He refused to give in. He was not– not going to rush to Steve’s side. No. He, Tony, was the one who deserved comfort. That’s what Rhodey would say. Tony could hear him now.. But Rhodey wasn’t in the room. And Steve was an inch from crying.
“Come on, old man!”
it. I know that’s a cowardly way out, but, Tony. I’m sorry, I– how can I convince you otherwise?”
the genius into stopping the conversation. He just... Steve was tired.
“It’s about him!” Tony snapped, his tone hardening. “Newsflash, it’s always been about him, Steve. What do you think it means if we fight this? I don’t see us coming out on top. We’re six people. Six people, Rogers. And you want to, what? Take on 117 countries? One of which, may I remind you, we live in?”
Oh, so that was the turbulence. No wonder he was having trouble hearing. Gravity.
“Mr. Stark.”
Horror filled Steve as it hit him. He’d been so focused on not eating that he hadn’t realized Tony wouldn’t sense anything from Steve’s end. Steve just wanted to know the second Tony ate, because it would’ve told him Tony was still alive and healthy. He hadn’t meant to convince Tony that he was dead.
Tony faltered at the sound of Peter’s voice. Peter who, for that matter, was more often busy or in a meeting than not. Peter, who never popped in for a visit without planning it in advance.
“Listen,” Tony lowered his gaze, “I don’t have time for games. Let’s not go in circles.”
He caught Sam and Bucky’s eye, sending them both a nod of their own. Bucky let out a huff of laughter, spreading his arms briefly as if it say
“Did you think about the alternatives?” Tony turned away, “I did. I knew the plans. The Secretary of Defense – have you heard of Project Wide Awake?”
Tony’s thoughts were racing. None of this was making sense. If Steve and Barnes were never more, then what did this mean? And how could Steve even say that, unless he still... still–
But he couldn’t go a day without it; without that extra sense of security. It had become his safety net, of a sort. It meant protection. It gave him the upper hand.
“I don’t know what you want me to say.” At least Tony was being honest. This was a good start. “You made a decision and... And it had consequences. I guess we’re both paying the price for those now.”
“Steve wants to talk to you.”
Tony huffed.
They would be okay.
Steve lolled his head to the side, meeting Rhodey’s eyes. The Colonel was hovering about four feet from the ground, palms held outward as he looked from the chaos of the battleground back to Steve.
“He was stabbed,” Nebula’s voice rang out from where she was conversing quietly with Rocket, “We patched him up as best as we could, but we had little to work with. It wasn’t an artificial wound, either.”
The sight within itself wasn’t unusual, no. Tony had grown rather accustomed to Barnes stumbling into the kitchen later than everyone else over time. It just
Tony had found himself with his back plastered to the wall of Stark’s communal room. He had managed to escape the endless conversations and avoid finding himself in conversation with individuals who wore the same faces as his friends.
Tony smirked.
Yeah, he had definitely lost control of keeping his emotions in check. There was no going back now. That much Tony could see. The dams had been broke and there was no way he could try to act like he was okay. At least, not to Steve. Steve, who knew him like the back of his own hand. Steve could read him like a book.
“We are.. the Avengers.”
Tony stood straighter, his eyes flickering towards the fridge just as a hand shoved a sippie cup towards him. The brunet shot Steve a thankful smile before offering it towards a pleased Peter. He made sure the toddler had a firm grasp on it before he glanced away, his arm still braced outward incase the child took a swan dive off the edge.
“Hate to ask but...”
The brunet pressed one last lingering kiss to Steve’s mouth, pulling back. He pressed his forehead into the blond’s, small pants falling from his mouth. They were both breathless.
Maybe things wouldn’t be like before. But this situation had given him hope. The prospect of having adult conversations wasn’t something Tony looked forward to. He inwardly cringed at that. But... it would be worth it. To keep something familiar. Even if this turned into something different. Change is good, Tony assured himself.
“Did you ever stop to think that maybe I should be the one to decide that?” Steve asked, wearily. “Tony, you’re– you’re everything anyone could want in a soulmate. When have I ever gave you the impression you weren’t?”
“I will miss you, Tony.”
with Steve. The mechanic didn’t claim to be a saint, not one bit. So it should come to no shock to know Tony would most certainly bask in the blond’s attention.
“Tony!” Steve squawked in disapproval, his apron fluttering as he whirled around. His cheeks had flushed a vibrant red, something Tony notes as he watched the blond cross his arms.
Oh, no. No, no, no..
It wasn’t too long before Tony realized Steve had people flanking either side of him. Tony humored the thought it being Sergeant Barnes before he caught the flash of striking blonde hair and the clunk of Rhodey’s familiar armor. He weakly attempted a smile at his best friends concerned gaze before dropping his head from exhaustion. Rhodey seemed to come to the same conclusion as him, this was not a time for talking. Even more alarming, Tony was beginning to think that maybe he really did need to get to medical.
“Lighten up, old man.”
“I see.” Steve closed the distance between them, his own hands reaching out to take the mug from Tony’s hands. They grappled briefly before gripping the brunet’s palms in his own, squeezing them in what seemed to be a reassuring manner. “You don’t need to worry, I’m here. Tony, I’m
like home. And to Tony, that meant a lot. Actually, it meant everything.
He’s asleep. Do you–“ He paused briefly before putting some space between himself and the taller man. “Do you have a moment?”
. You’re not allowed to do this to me anymore.”
Deep breathes.
“First time we met.” Tony shrugged, casting his eyes downward. “Multiple times after that. Siberia, primarily.”
Peppermint was the typical go-to food.
As soon as his soul wrist stopped burning, of course.
“Pizza?” Tony inquired, sending his charge into fits of giggles as he juggled him. The brunet paused and maneuvered Peter to his hip. He leaned in to his ear to whisper the next part teasingly. “Something tells me Papa wouldn’t be too pleased with me if I gave you pizza.”
But that was before Tony Stark. Tony had stormed into S.H.I.E.L.D just hours after Steve had finished getting situated into the medic wing. The billionaire barged in with a snake-like tongue. He was quick, trampling over any arguments and ready to bite anyone who tried to keep him from Steve.
Tony swung his feet over the edge of the bed, wincing from the cold flooring. It was easy for him to find suitable clothing, pausing on his way to lay his clothes out to stare in the mirror at the sight of his exposed body.
Again.
Tony blinked.
“I won’t.” Tony sent him a watery smile. “Thank you, for trusting an old man like me.”
Definitely not Rhodey, then.
Maybe.
This clearly wasn’t a.... typical earth problem.
“General Ross presented me with an official proposal approved by 117 countries.” Tony held a hand up to silence Steve’s confusion. “Otherwise titled The Framework For The Registration and Deployment of Enhanced Individuals. It’s a mouthful, I know. But it covers most bases.” The brunet inhaled, his eyes cutting towards Steve’s own. The blond was beginning to deeply frown. “Basically they’re... legal documents designed to regulate the activities of enhanced individuals, specifically those who work for government agencies. S.H.I.E.L.D, for one. Not to mention, private organizations such as us. The Avengers.” He exhaled, and silenced himself.
They could have stayed like that for hours. The embrace was comforting and
Rhodey covered his smile with his hand and sent the hungover soldier a smug smirk.
And maybe running out, too.
Someone neared, a friend. Or an ally. Steve couldn’t make out the figure through his blurred vision. He just knew the creatures were no longer surrounding him; the other person began fighting them off. Steve figured maybe Bucky. Or Sam. He thought they had been closest to him before he’d lost sight of everyone; before he’d been swarmed.
Tony couldn’t help but feel guilty at the relief that flooded through him at realizing Cap’s name hadn’t been mentioned. This meant Steve was fine, he had made it. He tried to justify it as being a normal reaction under such circumstance. After all, Steve was an Avenger. They would need every hero they could get, of course.
Tony opened his mouth to reply, faltering as a voice cried out, “As opposed to being carried by Captain America like a simpering maiden!”
“What? Of course they’ll have you back,” Steve spluttered, pulling his hand back before regaining his train of thought. “And you know that’s not what I meant.”
He was getting too old for this.
“I’m not as young as I used to be.” Tony spoke, motioning towards where Bruce and Scott were hovering around the worm hole, speaking quickly to one another. “I hope this journey is smoother than the first.”
“So... what I’m asking is. Will you marry me?” The blond presented a ring from his blazer pocket. He held it up as an offering, appearing as if it were a grenade. His face even had the look of Tony being the pin, preventing the explosion. “Will you let me take care of you for the rest of our lives?”
“Water.” He croaked, his arms raising in an attempt to heave himself in a sitting position.
Tony ran a hand down his face, brow furrowing as he neared the sound of voices. It took him a second to realize he had found his way back up to communion guest floor. His steps faltered. The team. He inhaled, rolled his shoulders, and forced a calm expression onto his face. He told himself he could do this. He could play pretend and make a quick escape. It’s only been two years since he had faced all of them. Hopefully–
The blond’s breathing caught. For some reason, the idea of being caught sent him into a panic; even though he knew he wasn’t in dire danger. Everything was fine, that what he had to keep telling himself. He was okay. And he would be okay.
“Your mind.” Tony pulled the chair at the head of Steve’s bed closer, opting to sit in it. He promptly crossed his legs and set his gaze on the blond. “It’s running so fast I think I might be exhausted. So that’s great, Rogers. Now both of us need a nap. Or two.” The brunet paused to let out an over exaggerated yawn.
The pair probably made for an amusing sight. They had gradually went from standing upright, tightly pressed to one another, to slowly swaying back and forth. Steve was
The brunet circled his own arms around Steve’s waist, pressing himself further into the blond’s chest. If that were possible, of course. Tony could feel the tension as it seeped from the blond’s broad form, his shoulders relaxing.
Just like Tony never thought he’d see the day that Steve didn’t exist.
In short, Tony was on
“Steve,” Rhodey sighed, sounding far more disappointed than the situation called for. “Man, what’d I say? I’d come get you. He just woke up.”
He turned the corner, his hand stretching out to trail along the wall as he neared his destination. It felt like he was saying more than goodbye. Tony didn’t understand, not really. But the emotion lay heavy in the pit of his stomach.
“Didn’t you?” Tony couldn’t help but sound bitter.
“Steve.” Tony spoke softly, quietly. The word came out in a murmur. It almost felt as if he were trying it on, and maybe he was.
Please let me know what you think! How you felt, what it made you feel, etc. I love and appreciate all feedback and kudos.
The two of them were seated in a small office connected to the medical wing. Tony’s X-Rays and MRI scans were currently highlighted and projected onto the wall before them.
Anyways.
Please make sure to leave me all the kudos and comments! I appreciate all feedback.
What were they doing? Was this... actually happening? If felt surreal. Tony didn’t actually believe he’d ever find himself back in Steve’s presence, alone. Actually, he couldn’t believe he allowed himself to be alone with Steve. Worse things have happened, though.
“Wong and I saw you take off with Strange and the kid,” Bruce continued, “And you only came back with Nebula.”
It was slow work.
“Were you- were you ashamed?” Steve’s voice fell to a quiet whisper, sounding desperate. His tone sounded broken, almost. It didn’t fit
“Oh, Tony,” Steve turned towards him, smiling sadly, “I never stopped.”
Steve had come to his defense, and Tony wasn’t quite sure of his intentions. Did he have an ulterior motive? Was he trying to get his way back into Tony’s good graces? His heart panged, guilt coursing through him. He shouldn’t think that lowly of Steve, should he?
Tony almost felt guilty at the implication of Steve needing a reason to be sweet. The brunet carefully placed the mug down, beginning to twiddle his thumbs as the blond began dishing out the rest of the breakfast items. He wasn’t sure if the Captain was aware of the inner turmoil going through Tony’s head.
“Oh?” Steve’s humorless laugh was mocking. It sent a pang through Tony’s chest. He swallowed. “Is that all you have to say? Did I actually manage to render you speechless, Stark?”
“Get him off the field!”
The brunet began to pull away, placing a few measured bites on the skin of Steve’s lips. He immediately soothed them, pressing a few chaste kisses against the blond’s mouth. Tony leaned back, cupping Steve’s face once more. His thumb idly traced the damp skin of the Captain’s cheekbone.
It had felt like everyone was afraid to be the one to break the silence. Almost as if it would jinx them. But Tony understood. He had stood back, too, exhausted eyes surveying the area. Nebula was still crouched, a gleam in her eye as she stood over her kill.
Tony wasn’t sure what he had initially expected. Being stranded in space with lacking resources wasn’t exactly promising. He hadn’t even humored the idea of being
Not together, at least.
“Then we’ll do that together, too,” he whispered, reaching out to curl his arm around Steve’s neck, burying his face into the crook of Steve’s neck as a single tear rolled down his cheek.
Rhodey and Bucky had been the only ones available to accompany them on this trip, but that would change later in the summer. The entire gang would get together for the Fourth of July in order to celebrate Steve’s birthday.
“Daddy!” Peter shrieked, his voice cracking as giggles threatened to pour through. “Papa– papa is using the
Tony scowled in response, unperturbed even as the blond’s eyes suggestively traced down his torso. The brunet glanced down, his cheeks briefly heating as he realized he was completely bare, sans the thin sheet pooling around his hips.
“The surgery went well?” Steve spoke quietly, his palms turned downwards against his knee caps.
“Steve... Steve.” The frantic tone in Tony’s voice caused Steve to jolt, his eyes wide awake.
“You’re up, good.” Steve stepped into the room, his eyes lighting up at the sight of Tony sitting up in bed.
“He gets it from you.”
A gentle silence settled over them much like a warm blanket. Tony almost considered calling it awkward, but he knew better. He struggled to make sense of it, but silences shared with Steve often felt intimate. Tony often referred to it as the-beefy-blond-effect.
Tony stepped further into the kitchen, placing his mug into the sink before propping his hip against the counter top. Peter scooted towards him, oblivious to the watchful eyes tracking his movement near the edge of the granite.
Tony would be a fool to not act.
“Are you only eloquent giving battle speeches?” Tony wondered aloud. “Is that the only time you have a way with words?”
Steve was giddily optimistic when concerning practically anything. It was his one character flaw, if it could be considered such. He was used to beating the odds and coming out on top.
Steve shot him a salacious grin.
Pym particles.
He was going to have a hard time explaining this to Rhodey and Pepper. Not to mention the struggle it would be to even convince them of this authenticity. He knew how it would go. They’d share pitying glances without saying what they truly thought...
“You can sit wherever you like.” Steve motioned around, taking a seat at the foot of his bed. He crossed his legs, then anxiously uncrossed them.
It had been so long since the two of them had been like
He glanced up, his features instantly smoothing as he met Rhodey’s concerned gaze. Tony removed his hand from his wrist and sent the man a reassuring smile.
“Then what?” Tony eyed him suspiciously, propping himself up on his elbows as Steve twisted onto his front, wiggling closer. They were inches apart now.
The food was prepared with Wakanda’s resources. So, yeah, of course it looked great. Except. Except Steve couldn’t even stomach the idea of eating. He had to know the moment Tony ate anything. He had to know because it would finally be a sign that Tony was okay.
The blood in Tony’s face quickly rushed to his cheeks, his resolve weakening ever so slightly. The room seemed to freeze, almost as if everyone was holding their breath. Awaiting his reaction. Tony refused to give them one.
“Compliance?” Steve sounded as if the air had been knocked out of him. Tony dared to glance up, biting into his jaw as he took in the swift expression of stubbornness clashing with the blond’s look of confusion. “You can’t honestly think we should agree, Tony.” The last part sounded almost like a plea, a word that tugged at the brunet’s heartstrings.
But they had lost Natasha.
Steve frowned before letting go, rolling his eyes as Tony made a point to soothe the skin.
Bruce chose that moment to sidle up next to him. Perhaps Tony had spoke to soon. He flicked the machine on, checking that the proper controls were on before pressing start. The smell of fresh coffee being grinded began to quickly fill the room.
“Aye,” Tony glanced towards Thor as he began to somberly recite the following, “Actions taken on a unconscious teammate are to remain anonymous. It is a grave crime to subject a member to humiliation, rabbit.”
With a sound falling from his lips that could only meant want, Tony melted against Steve’s chest. The blond didn’t even falter in his pursuit of exploding Tony’s back, his thigh driving a wedge between the brunet’s legs as he guided him back and against a flat surface.
“Hey, hey Tony,” Steve’s raspy voice broke him from his thoughts, “Are you with me? Tony?” Tony nodded weakly, suddenly feeling as if his weight were only being held up by Steve and Steve alone. It wouldn’t be the first time.
“Together.” Steve finished. He starred up at the brunet, their proximity causing them to be merely a few inches apart. Tony could see the emotion swimming in the blues of Steve’s eyes. They were so deep, seemingly endless. It was mesmerizing. Tony could drown himself in the pools.
They would be okay.
“Of course not.” Steve reached for Peter, a light hum falling past his lips as leaning down toward’s his husband. Tony inwardly preened as the blond pressed a kiss to his cheek before settling Peter on his hip. “How about pancakes or waffles?”
“Cakes!” Peter cheered, his left hand clutching at the material of Steve’s shirt as he popped his right thumb in his mouth.
They quietly made their way through the corridor, veering right instead of left, the previous direction Tony had come from when leaving the medical wing. He made a mental note of that. In case of emergencies, of course. Like breaking out from speaking of emotional trauma. He wasn’t sure if that was a real thing, but...
“A lot of it went over my head, of course.” Steve shrugged, gradually wrapping his arm around Tony’s shoulder. The latter had to stop himself from sinking into the embrace. “But... the main parts stuck. He said from the data he had collected, our universes seemed to follow the same projectile path.”
“The heaviest.” Steve spoke seriously, nodding in agreement. His hand settled on the toddler’s head, brushing through the soft curls. “But you asked for help. Just like we told you.”
Tony’s face went blank.
It had taken intense planning. Multiple different strategies and so many backup plans that they had almost ran out of letters to use. And Tony still couldn’t believe it. The atmosphere as Thanos’ lifeless body laid on the ground was quiet... so quiet. It was almost eery.
“An art.... gallery?” Tony spoke in confusion, instantly feeling shamed at the way Steve let out a laugh.
“Can’t go wrong with those.” Tony quipped, carefully side stepping around the blond as he padded towards the coffee pot.
“He came,” Rhodey spoke with conviction, his voice suddenly sounding stronger, “We called him and they all came running.”
None the less, Tony stayed close as Peter flailed his arms around amidst his
Just one.
side.”
“Hey, no.” Steve abruptly turned in Tony’s grasp, wincing as he forced himself onto his back while pulling the brunet on top. “No, Tony. I’m not– I’ll be okay. I’m not alone.” The blond paused, wiping his eyes. “Yes, I’ll need time to.. to move on from us. But I have our friends. The future is endless.”
It didn’t matter that Tony knew Steve was dead. And that there was no way this could actually be him.
needed to know what was at stake. What I...”
“I love you.” Tony spoke quietly, his voice lowering to a soft murmur. “You and your giddy optimism. Your stubborn backbone. Don’t forget that.”
It wasn’t for
Tony inhaled shakily even as the tears began to freely flow down his cheeks. He could taste the salt on his lips, the bottom one trembling as Steve’s words began to settle over him. The blond gently reached out, his arms tugging the older man into his chest. Tony had forgone all sense of keeping up pretenses and finally allowed himself to crumble against that firm chest.
“I- sorry,” Steve nodded jerkily, his expression faltering, “I was just checking in. Like I’ve–“
Tony smiled at the thought.
Steve ran a hand down his face before laying both palms flat on the desk. Queen Shuri was just as hospitable as King T’Challa had been. She’d offered them refuge in Wakanda until they felt fit to leave. They each had a room of their own, equipped with a bed, bathroom, and shower.
The brunet spared a glance upward, his nerves beginning to melt as he took in the sight of a messy Peter Stark-Rogers. The child in question must have reached his limit on eating, as he was beginning to smush eggs between his fingers instead of digesting them.
Steve settled him into his high chair and worked on clipping a bib around his neck; it would prove futile. Brown eyes flickered to the right, watching Bucky swat at Rhodey’s hand as the Colonel attempted to steal a few sausage links. The sound of their bickering felt
The room was silent.
(See the end of the chapter for
Thanos. After they fixed the world. But that time had never come.
It was the kind of symbol you’d find in the back of a textbook used to describe a soulmark.
They had each other.
Steve shook his head minutely, biting his lip briefly before pointedly focusing on Peter and the way the baby was mouthing on a rattler. The blond gently tugged it from the child’s hands, replacing it with a pacifier before speaking. “No. No, absolutely not.”
Peter frowned, the skin between his eyebrows furrowing as he scrunched his nose. His wide brown eyes darted to Steve’s unimpressed stance before leaning back to peer into Tony’s face.
Longing?
Natasha turned on her heel, jerking her head to indicate that he should follow her. Steve swung his legs over the side of the bed and allowed himself to eye his form critically. He was still wearing his battle gear, although it had been cleaned since the fight. He was just trying to stay prepared for anything that could occur.
Steve’s mouth was currently void of any actual flavor. But he knew Tony was at least alive. It was hard to explain, but Steve knew the difference between a soulmate who was currently in existence, and one who hadn’t been born yet. During those early years, Steve lived his life believing he didn’t have a soulmate. So he lived a content life. He had Bucky and his ma. He was fine with that; it meant no one had to taste the countless medicines and home remedies he’d been forced to ingest. They wouldn’t have to live knowing their soulmate was sickly. Because you could taste sick, and it was haunting.
The brunet swallowed.
Steve could
He still hadn’t slept longer than six hours in those two days.
Images and flashes blurred past Tony’s eyes at a rapid pace. It almost felt like wind was rushing past Tony’s ears as he tumbled through the time and space continuum.
Steve. That thought alone was enough to make the brunet intensely aware of the severity of his situation. He began to feel the awe... the realization that Steve had went through so much trouble to pull strings in order for this to come to be.
The blond glanced down, his blue eyes flickering to Tony’s hand in a silent question. Tony shrugged, unsure of his intentions. And then Steve grasped the brunet’s calloused hand in his much larger one, raising it to press a chaste kiss to Tony’s knuckles.
, might I add. Which is supposed to mean
A shadow flashed across her face.
“Hey.” Tony’s head lazily rolled to the side at the question, his eyes trailing up to meet the face of the concerned voice. He had been on the receiving end of Rhodey’s concerned face far too often. “How are you holding up?”
It felt almost unsettling for Tony to find himself falling back into his typical routine. He took a shower, his towel snugly wrapped around his hips as he slid into a pair of house shoes. He idly starred into the mirror, turning his head as he eyed the reflection before him.
Tony came to a halt, barely avoiding colliding into Steve’s back. Steve ignored that, instead choosing to slide the door open to give them both entrance. He strolled in, a hesitant and cautious Tony behind him. His thoughts raced. Steve said... where he slept. Hope bloomed in his chest at the prospect of Steve refusing to call this his room. He swallowed it down. That would be a topic for another day, perhaps.
“You have a full life to live with him.” Steve whispered, sending Tony a watery smile of his own. “It’s your turn to be happy.”
The silence in the room was deafening. Tony shifted his weight before making his way towards a modernly designed desk with a wheeled chair beside it. The desk was located a few feet from the bed, directly in Steve’s line of vision. He took a seat, crossing his ankles before sighing.
Tony offered him a watery smile.
“I’d love to,” he nodded in agreement, pausing as he outstretched his hand. Did he reach out to shake her hand or was that breaching some sort of royal protocol?
“Tony.” Steve spoke, the sound of his voice sending goosebumps up the brunet’s spine. He lowered himself to his knee, the shade of his blue eyes appearing darker than usual from his position below Tony. Dark with desire and want. The brunet shivered. “Will you do me the honor of being my husband?”
“For everyone,” they chorused.
I know I struggle with expressing myself.” Steve spoke quietly, his voice surprisingly sturdy. “But I can’t change the past. I’m trying to atone for that... I-Tony, I don’t expect you to forgive and forget. That’s not... it’s not fair. But I don’t want you to think I did any of that to intentionally hurt you.”
There should be two Steve’s existing in this time, then. Because this Steve.. was from a future in which Tony died. He went back to his own past and created a new timeline in which Tony hadn’t died.
Tony Stark was proud of himself.
Steve came to as gradual as he went out. His heightened senses were slow, struggling to make sense of the noises and smells assaulting him. A muffled groan fell past his lips, his fingers beginning to twitch at his side.
Bucky.
“Well,” Tony stood, making a show of arching his back, “Nice talk, Cap. Emotions were shown. Let’s do it again... never. I think I’m starting to break out in hives.”
“Tony? What’s wrong?” The blond sat up and began to assess Tony; his blue eyes trailing up and down the billionaire’s form.
Tony’s mouth fell dry as his eyes wildly flickered around the new images and videos being shown before him. They flashed rapidly, Friday using technology in order to enhance the images and zoom in on noticeable features.
“I’m sure Captain Rogers would be pleased to hear so.” Friday spoke. “After all, you have been married for years and share custody of a child. One would think–“
________
The blond rubbed soothing circles into the material of Tony’s shirt. It was calming, the sensation lulling the dark haired man into a sense of peace.
“We risk our livelihood every time we go out into the field.” Steve defended, shaking his head. “No. I do not agree with this, Tony. We take risks trying to fight the bad guy and we’re being held at what, gun point?”
“It was nice to have you drop by.” Peggy quirked a smile, gracefully rising to her feet to meet him halfway. Her perfectly coiffed hair bounced with every step, her brows pulling together as she stopped a foot away from him.
Tony couldn’t help but feel as if the weight of those words were far heavier than meets the eye. He wanted to turn around and meet the blond’s gaze, maybe do something absolutely wild. After all, climbing Steve like a tree was always one of Tony’s first choice of things to do to the blond.
He didn’t think they’d come out on top.
Even in his current condition, he knew something was wrong. He hadn’t exactly planned to
A friend.
This was... theirs. And no one would take that away. Peter was their son and would grow up in a household with two present parents; no fear of losing either of them in a mission. They were a family, and they weren’t alone.
Steve stepped up, a gentle look in his eyes as he leaned forward. Tony braced himself, a soft sigh escaping his mouth as Steve’s lips pressed against the skin of his forehead.
“Don’t bring him into this.” Steve warned, his eyes flashing.
“I didn’t actually lie.” Tony bit his lip, wincing even as the words left his mouth. It was true. He hadn’t told anyone, sans Rhodey and Pepper. The information was classified. All soul marks were documented at birth, it was legally required. But the genius had made sure his soulmark couldn’t be accessed by anyone. He had obliterated the file and made absolutely sure all traces of it were gone.
Tony let out a wet laugh. “You know them so well.”
“Tones!”
And he knew Steve felt the same, too.
“I’m sorry–“ The blond began, pausing with a frown as Tony stood to shove his chair back. Steve hadn’t realized the brunet had been that turned off by his question that he would
Steve let out a snort, sending Tony a look that read
“Unless.” Tony began, sitting up with a new sense of giddy excitement. “You stayed here.”
He snapped his fingers.
“That’s what you’re going with, Cap? Really?” Tony asked, his lips quirking up to fight back a smile. He was failing, rather poorly, Steve noted miserably.
“You want to get ahead of it.” Steve spoke quietly, nodding swiftly. “I see where you’re coming from. I appreciate you telling me so soon. But... how do we fight this?”
Steve flushed.
It didn’t matter that Tony had been at his funeral. That he could still hear the sound of the casket being lowered into the ground. Or how the thought of that day still caused Tony to tremble; in sorrow and in anger. Anger at not being
Consider Tony
They shared another weighted glance, and Tony had questions. Countless questions. He knew the path he had been on with his Steve, the
Steve stepped onto the battle field, the atmosphere being one of which he had grown far too accustomed to. The fighting around him was intense, everyone appearing as if they were moving in slow motion. The grunts and cries were endless, but he paid them little mind.
Steve ground to a halt, his hand stretching out to clutch Tony by the collar of his nanotech suit just as he lifted his arm to reveal the newly fashioned infinity gauntlet; the current home for all of the stones.
Tony slid to his feet, side-stepping Steve as he made his way towards the door. Blood pounded in his ears as his feet slapped against the ground. Oh, how foolish he had been to have even hoped that–
Tony may have given Steve a home, but this hug
Nevertheless, the blond took Tony’s confused reaction in stride, stepping up and behind the brunet in order to place either of his hands in front of Tony’s eyes. The brunet forcefully swallowed, the skin of his neck prickling at the hot air blowing across his nape.
Tony’s eyes widened as an invisible light bulb flashed over his head. Time evidently appeared to work quite differently when visiting different realities. That would explain why his house wasn’t crawling with SHIELD agents, sorcerers, Asgardians, and heroes alike. No one was worried about his disappearance because, well... it hadn’t been an unusually long time.
He wouldn’t risk it.
“Surprise me.”
Oh. Tony hadn’t made the connection.
Tony grinned as he pushed his arms through a button up shirt. “Don’t make me regret installing a parachute in your suit years ago!”
We– we get ahead by compliance.”
“Fuck off.” Bucky grumbled, wincing as Steve shot him a dark look. “I mean– stop bullying me.” He added lamely.
The billionaire followed, his shorter legs struggling to keep up with the blond’s long stride. The obvious difference in their height
“I don’t need to hear that from you.” Tony covered his mouth with his hand, shaking his own head. He jerked a thumb back, signaling out his own Steve who looked on fondly. “I have my own thick headed blond who may or may not have some groveling to do.” He paused at the jeering from his friends, briefly cracking a smile at the taunting Bucky was giving his own Steve. “You, on the other hand, you need to hear this.”
“Hey, man, no,” Rhodey made a face of disgust. “I’m just starting to like him again. Don’t remind me.”
His tears were staining the front of Steve’s shirt, he knew this. But he couldn’t find it within him to even care. He didn’t care the impression he may be leaving, he needed this. And if Steve was willing to give...
Seeing Peter grow up was a reminder that everyone else had managed to find a home for themselves, without Steve. Don’t get Tony wrong, he knew they missed the blond. But they were able to follow and go through healthy stages of grief at a relatively normal rate.
Their soulmark.
Rhodey raised his hands in surrender, shrugging, “Listen, I know in the past I had my minor reservations–“
No one would make him feel like this.
Her lips pursed before offering him a nonsensical smile. “Honestly, Rogers.” She paused, forcing herself to inhale in what appeared to be an attempt to calm herself. “You’re the only person who could feel
“No, no,” Steve began mumbling, his punches growing fiercer. He began pushing the creatures back just as soon as they showed up. Tears filled his eyes as the taste of blood grew thicker.
“Uhuh.” The child nodded eagerly, swinging his legs back and forth. “Can I have some juice, pwease?”
As if this would be easy together.
“We knew.” Tony began, quietly, much to the alarm of Steve. The blond startled at the comment, only calming from the gentle hushing come from the brunet. “Not everyone. They didn’t notice. But.. myself. Rhodey, Bruce, Scott, Thor, Clint, Bucky, and Sam. Hell, even the build a bear noticed.”
“You silly, Daddy.” Peter flashed a toothy smile, his hands reaching out to pat Tony’s face. His facial expression faltered briefly, his lips twisting together. “And you scratchy.”
“Let’s go home.” Tony whispered, his voice hushed as he untangled himself from the blond. He stepped back in order to straighten his clothes.
“Ashamed?” Tony laughed, almost hysterically. “Ashamed of being your soulmate?”
He couldn’t help the hitch in his breath and he tried to maintain the shaking of his chest. He tried to ignore the way tears began to fall from his eyes. But he couldn’t ignore the way Tony’s arms snaked around his waist from behind, or the way the brunet propped his hand on top of the blond’s shoulder.
” Tony spoke in wonder, his voice coming out choppy. “Surrounded by.... me.”
“More than.” Rhodey scoffed, shaking his head. “Try:
Tony squeezed back.
“There’s a party down there.” Earth-616 Tony motioned towards the floor, sending his younger self an inquisitive look.
Till death do they part.
He only hoped that Tony would understand.
Tony faltered, his eyes furrowing confusion as he met his husband’s gaze. He faltered briefly, not realizing how close the two had become. “Sorry?”
It was true, there’s no denying it.
“Of course.” Tony breathed.
Tony nodded quickly in agreement.
think of another option. Perhaps, say, the rest of the team. He didn’t want them splitting up. They needed to be in one mind and one accord, no pun intended. “They’re just... training wheels, Steve.” He rolled on, ignoring the blond’s huff of disgust. “An official way to secure world peace.”
Tony tensed up, every single cell in his body screaming at him to abort. Abort mission. He wasn’t ready, not yet. Not now. He let out a shaky breath, his eyes prickling with tears as memories flashed through his thoughts.
“No, no biting Papa’s watch.” Tony tugged Peter back from gnawing on Steve’s wrist.
“What’s this about Stark being sent to the couch?” Bucky croaked, his attempt at poking fun of Tony failing due to his less than kept appearance.
He began shoving back, sending the animals soaring. Soon, he was able to get back to his feet, but it still seemed useless. It was almost as if they were multiplying. No matter how many he hit, it barely seemed to make a difference.
But it was real to Tony. That would have to be enough for him.
The silver haired man peered into the opening, his brow furrowing at the hazy light being emitted from within. It began to gradually clear up, the space within the portal becoming visible. Tony was beginning to make out the details of a lab that looked painstakingly similar to his. If it had been fifteen years ago, that is.
Steve ignored Tony’s grumbling complaints, his footsteps echoing as he disappeared down the hall. The brunet stared after him, forlornly, and sighed. He stretched, relief flooding him at the sensation of his joints cracking.
“For... the only family I’ve ever known,” Rocket hopped up onto the countertop, lifting his paw. He spun around and met everyone’s gaze with a look of defiance, nodding in acceptance before dropping his head, shoulders slumping.
And, the billionaire can’t leave out the time Steve used bacon to bribe Tony into attending a baseball game.
The man that stood in the light of the mirror was obviously older. He had wrinkles, and his eyes appeared tired. His face was smooth, and torso still appeared to be the same as it had been years ago. Just... a bit softer. Not as lean.
“That’s right.” Tony joined in, squatting down and opening his arms. “How about some breakfast?”
“Thank you.” She glanced down briefly, a smile curling around the edge of her mouth as she peered at the ring.
He stole a fleeting glance at Steve, his skin prickling under that intense blue gaze. They were inches apart and Tony had never felt farther from Steve. They spent two years without one another and even then, Tony hadn’t felt like this. He didn’t quite understand it. It sounded ridiculous; he knew it did. But maybe it was because it hadn’t quite hit him. The realization that... they weren’t quite them anymore. Before, after Siberia.. Tony could pretend they just had a disagreement. That maybe one day they’d have something resembling what they once were.
Designing new equipment and technology; a genius.
“I– what reservations? Peter–“
And they did.
“Maybe.” Tony shrugged, wincing as exhaustion began to settle in his bones. He wasn’t as young as he used to be. Tomorrow morning was going to feel
Steve angrily found himself feeling
“You on the couch if we eat pizza for bweakfast.” Peter nodded in understanding, sending Steve a small frown as he tapped his wrist. “No put Daddy on couch, Papa. Puh-lease.”
He spared a glance for Natasha and then Rhodey before striding towards the spaceship. They protested, Natasha’s hand falling short of being able to stop him. He was midway to the ship before he could see any sign of movement. The backside began to open, a ramp gradually lowering.
It all felt so warm.
Tony cried out in alarm, his brows shooting up in confusion as Steve shoved his own hand into the glove. The blond faltered briefly, a rushing sound whooshing through his ears as he fell to his knees. The power coursing through him felt... almost like electricity.
“Of course,” Steve glanced briefly at Tony, a wary look crossing his face before looking away just as quickly, jerking his thumb back into what Tony assumed to be the hall, “I’ll just be.” Steve trailed off before turning on his heel, briskly walking away with his shoulders tensed.
“I– yes. For you, always.” Steve blinked rapidly, his eyes flickering back and forth incredulously. The genius wasn’t surprised. He wasn’t exactly acting the same way he had been before Steve set off on his latest mission. “What’s uh... what’s going on?”
“Uncle Whodey!” He cheered, pulling the cap of his drink away to speak. “Daddy doesn’t have to sleep on the couch!”
Something to consider.
It was the one word Steve could choke out before the syringe sunk into his arm. Logically, he knew the effects wouldn’t last more than half an hour. The serum burned through modern day medicine like a house on fire. Despite this, Steve could make out Rhodey’s stricken expression just before everything went blank.
Peter scrunched up his nose and glanced up, his face smeared with bits of egg and syrup. His eyes glanced at Tony’s full plate before he shook his spoon in the billionaire’s direction. “Eat eat!”
“Yeah, there will be plenty of those.” Earth-199999 Tony shrugged, dismissing the idea. “But you. You’re different, new, like a shiny toy.”
“Yeah.” Steve’s response was quick, stepping alongside the brunet to jerkily motion toward the portrait. “I, uh–“ He faltered, his hand coming up to cup the back of his own head. “I tried to carry over a sense of symbolism. With the portraits lining the hall, I mean.”
The room slowly began to settle. The once tense atmosphere began to give; light conversation started to pick back up. Tony was half surprised he hadn’t been barraged with questions as he walked in. Although... perhaps Rhodey had warned everyone off him. He glanced up, cautiously peeking towards Steve. The captain was making a point of facing the opposite direction, his broad shoulders ever so clearly tensed in restraint. Natasha sat next to him, her shoulder pressing against Steve’s. Yeah, Rhodey definitely warned them, then.
The writing from across the room stopped; pausing from what had seemed like endless scribbling. The blond dared to glance up, Steve’s eyes boring into Peggy’s steely ones.
“Peggy..” Steve mumbled, his eyes squinting in confusion as a plastic straw was fed through his mouth. “...stone. Gotta. Fix the timeline.”
Tony had
No threat.
Steve to his name; much like he were doing to the rest of these different heroes. Because they
“I thought I’d never have this again,” Steve whispered against the shell of his ear, his breath fanning across his neck and sending shivers down Tony’s spine, “I thought I’d never be able to tell you how I never meant to hurt you. When I didn’t see you get off the ship right away... I thought–“
“Probably shouldn’t aggravate the wound,” she spoke quietly, her dark eyes searching his own as the ship jerked roughly to the side, “Landing in one.”
“Thank you for having me.” Steve nodded, sending her a genuine smile. He reached down and grasped her hand in his own, offering it a small squeeze as his fingers traced the cool metal. “I am happy for you, Peggy.”
“That better be real chocolate.” Rhodey’s voice broke their silence, his threat falling on deaf ears as Peter’s eyes snapped towards him.
He inhaled, and forced his shoulders back–
Tony couldn’t believe it. Steve is in bed. Beside him. Steve is alive. This isn’t younger Steve from the other universe. This is
“Why?” Steve asked incredulously before spluttering. “What– how could you even ask that?” The blond’s voice dropped down to a whisper as he stressed the next part. “Tony, I
He hadn’t realized it at the time, but oh, he did now.
But he had also grown more firm.
“Because I didn’t.. I thought. I thought I was doing something right. And I realize I only managed to pull everything apart. And then– you’re right about Siberia. I shouldn’t have lied, even if I thought it was protecting you. I should’ve thought of how you felt instead of reacting blindly.” He swallowed, light footsteps echoing as they grew closer. “I’m seeing a therapist, to– to deal with my emotions. PTSD. It’s uh–“ the blond cut himself off in order to let out a hysterical laugh. “It’s different. But. I’m trying to be better.”
And what if Tony had knew his and Steve’s were an identical match? It wasn’t a lie to not tell him. He hadn’t denied anything, actually. However... it still felt like a cheap way out. But it was better than the alternative.
“What are–” Steve cut himself off as the brunet pushed into his space. The blond stumbled back, caught off guard at the amount of weight he was now responsible for holding.
Tony was content.
It felt like something more was being said. This moment was intense; the atmosphere felt almost electrifying. It held many promises even though few words were being spoken. And Tony knew exactly what he was supposed to say next.
He would have went unseen too, if not for Tony’s technology. The genius felt almost gleeful for a split second. He had defeated the odds. This device would be able to secure and locate missing children... he would have to install safety procedures in case it fell into the wrong hands of terrorists, of course. But it
“I’ve got you.” Steve spoke reverently, his tone one of reassurance. “I won’t let you fall.”
Except... except.
“My first thought was, ‘we’d fight it. We’d stop it,’” Steve laughed bitterly, “But then I realized too late that that’s what you were trying to do.”
Steve’s hurt expression shouldn’t have caused Tony to feel guilty. He had no right to demand trust from Tony. Not now.
“Tony?”
“....must be taking his time,” is what he struggled to pick up from Nebula’s monotone.
“I see that you’re giving in.” The blond turned, resting his weight against the counter top. He pinched the bridge of his nose as he regarded Tony with a look of disappointment. “You’re throwing the towel in before giving us a fighting stance. The team needs you to be on
Until now.
You can find me on twitter at @winterstarks.
“Steve.” Tony cut him off, clambering to his feet. His height hardly seemed intimidating, but this felt like a conversation that needed to be said standing up. He inhaled and let out a shaky breath. “Peter is– he’s
But now? It was never more evident than in this moment that they would have to actually work back towards something even close to being just... just friends. Was that enough for Tony? Did he even want more? Every potential answer he thought of scared him.
“Idiot.” Tony spoke out loud, his emotions bleeding through so strongly that Steve knew it wasn’t spoke with spite. It was with... passion.
“I feel like I’ve betrayed them.” Steve’s voice was quiet, haunting, even. The sound of it broke the silence in the stillness of the room.
“Amnesia? Maybe..”
Kissing Tony felt like... the only explanation Steve could think of would be the sensation that came with wielding Mjolnir. It took everything within the Captain’s power to keep his hands from tearing open the front of the brunet’s shirt.
Tony turned off the bathroom light.
He wasn’t even mad, honest.
this taste. Guilt gnawed at Steve’s conscience; he felt ashamed for being happy.
Tony scoffed at that.
This may have been a step closer to Tony returning home, but it was also a step in the right direction. It was Tony also taking steps towards building a better future for himself.
Tony quirked a brow, tilting his head up to flash the blond a kind smile. He took a measured sip of his coffee, hiding his smile into the mug as Steve stepped closer; pressing the length of his body into the brunet’s own.
“In what universe?” Tony crossed his arms, trying to make himself seem larger. After all, he’d always been told he takes up the attention of the whole room when he walks in. “That’s not... That’s not right. I refuse to believe it.”
“I feel like I should mention how twisted our routines have become.” Tony noted, setting his mug onto the banister before leaning back into the Captain’s embrace. “Remind me again.” He continued, a faux innocent tone wrapping around his words. “Who was it that used to wake up at five A.M. for their morning run?”
Tony couldn’t help but bask in this atmosphere. It felt surreal, even. The image made for the picture perfect image of domesticity. Steve Rogers, Tony’s
“Dance with me.”
“We can’t roll over!” Steve argued. “We can find middle ground. A truce or– or something. We can’t, what, let them dictate our every move?”
“He’s gone.” She spoke quietly, avoiding his gaze. “We took a vote. Decided you weren’t in a place to make the journey. That and, well, we didn’t think you’d stick to the plan.”
Or maybe Steve had seen sense. And maybe it would be Ross and the U.N that would shred Tony’s family apart. The billionaire wouldn’t put it past them to be controlled by Hydra– or some semblance of a villainous group.
He couldn’t blame Tony. He fought as hard as he could, and he lost Steve. If he had known that Steve would be a causality of war.. Tony would’ve found a way to fight even harder. Somehow. He would’ve found the energy to try harder, even when he wanted to lay down. Even when he knew he had given it all he had.
“I will.” Steve nodded, beginning to untangle himself from the billionaire. Tony allowed him to pull back, even as a distraught expression took over the brunet’s face.
Two days.
Interesting.
He was fine.
He needed to bask and cling in this normalcy for one more night. One more night and then he’d tell Steve. He promised.
Steve’s fingers trembled as they shoved the plastic wrapping aside. He paused for a moment with the mint gripped in his hand and took a deep breath before popping it into his mouth. His taste buds immediately filled with the sweet flavor. It coated his tongue and wrapped around the sides of his mouth.
“World peace?” Steve spat the word. “You’re telling me the United States’ wrote up a document to secure world peace? Ironic, isn’t it?”
Steve smiled sadly. “It’s not about what’s fair. It’s about what’s right.”
“No, I’m telling you the U.S is
Steve’s eye caught the glint of her wedding band. His heart briefly ached for what could have been, but he smiled.
Because that was allowed now.
“For...” Thor hesitated, his lips turning down. It was evident he was struggling internally, the thoughts and memories of his recent losses weighing hard, “Asgard.” Something had went unsaid there. Tony spent a split second hoping Thor had come at peace with himself.
Tony blinked.
Steve hadn’t.
“It suits you.”
there. And I struggle with that. With accepting it, I mean.”
“Do you trust me?” Tony asked the question firmly, his voice unwavering as he met Steve’s gaze. The question held depth, meaning, importance... Everything was on the line here. The fate of humanity and their
It was strange.
“Third time’s the charm?” Tony spoke sheepishly.
Tony glanced up with a watery smile, his bottom lip trembling as he offered a shaky nod. His chest had began to loosen at Steve’s proclamation. “Ask me again.”
expression taking home on his face. Steve had been on the receiving end of that look far too many times.
“Where is he?”
This Steve?
“Thanks, Fri.” Tony laughed lightly, his voice dropping into a mocking tone. “
“As opposed to?” Tony quirked a brow, offering his hand as Bruce neared, faltering as he pulled him in. “Ooph. Yeah, that’s a hug. Totally a hug and not a handshake. Did you miss the hand?”
His mind raced, beginning to oddly recall of a time before he had visited an alternate universe in which he had agreed to such plans. But that... that was impossible. He had been in the different reality for
He cautiously hobbled down the steps, fingers clutching the railing as he took the creaking steps one by one. If it was his bet, he’d say they were lucky this piece of junk had even made it through the atmosphere. He humorlessly laughed at the idea of going out due to the conditions of a space craft lacking proper safety measures in comparison to the recent threat they had just faced. It’d be ironic. Almost. The faint sound of voices began to prick his ears, breaking him from his thoughts.
And then Tony wakes up and his Steve is there. It took him a moment to make sense of what he was seeing. He had to force himself to blink rapidly, expecting the sight before him to disappear. Even though that’s not how waking up worked.
“Hey, hey, Tones,” Rhodey rushed in the room, not even hesitating before coming to his side. He gently began pressing him to lay back down, “Try to take it easy. I know how you are about listening to doctors orders.”
It was at that moment that a whoop sounded from the far right corner of the room. The two glanced away, a flush spreading across the apple’s of Tony’s cheeks.
Besides, this Steve and Tony?
His hands reached down and gripped onto the sides of Tony’s hips. Steve could feel a smile beginning to press into his mouth before the brunet’s tongue bravely traced his bottom lip. The blond parted his mouth with a sigh, settling into the familiar embrace.
It was time for Steve to go home.
“I’m glad you’re on your feet, now,” Steve added as an afterthought. Tony almost laughed. Steve
“Then, alrighty. We’re on the same page.” Tony’s voice began to lose its bravado, his eyes sweeping across Steve’s form briefly before hesitantly parting. “But.. you do understand that– that you’re returning to a time..” The brunet faltered as if pained at having to speak the next few words. “A time in which I’m still dead. You do get that, right?”
Tony sat astride Steve, his chest heaving. The blonde haired man reached outwards, his fingers sliding under the hem of the mechanic’s shirt. Tony inhaled as Steve dug his fingers into the skin of his hips. He leaned forwards, pressing a gentle kiss to Steve’s own lips. Steve pressed closer, tilting his head as he yearned to steal the very breath from Tony.
his brain struggled to make the connection as he began to return the gesture.
The brunet surged forward, pressing his mouth against Steve’s own. It almost felt like the air was being sucked from the blond’s lungs as Tony devoured him. To feel the weight pressed against him, the mouth..
The blonde figure took a measured step back, alerting Tony of his movement before tugging him to the edge of the bed. Steve pulled away with a gasp, lowering himself to the bed and leaning back with his arms propping himself up. Tony stood between his parted legs before lifting one knee to the bed, the other one following.
It opened up the floor for discussion on who hadn’t been...
Tony idly hummed to himself as he tasted the sauce he had been preparing on the stove. He paused briefly at the taste before adding more seasoning. It was as he stirred the ingredients together that his eye caught the reflection off the glint of his engagement ring.
“And I want you to be my husband, but only if that’s something you want.”
“Take care, Cap.” Tony found himself able to offer the Captain a genuine smile, one that had even managed to reach his eyes.
Steve didn’t know what he was expected to say. He knew Tony wanted the truth... but would that be the best course of action? Lying to Tony had never went well before. But... was this something Tony needed to truly know?
Rhodey raised his hands in surrender, scowling, “Fine, fine....” he trailed off with a sigh, staring at his hands, “When you went missing–“
“Oh, Tony.” Steve breathed, pressing a kiss to his forehead. “Sweetheart, you don’t have to... you don’t have to say yes. That’s not your only option. We can just–“ The blond briefly faltered in the next bit. “We can pretend this didn’t happen.”
Tony laughed, albeit weakly.
The dawning of morning came with the uneasy realization that Steve had never come to bed. His side remained tucked in; unchanging. No indent on the pillow from being slept on. Not a trace of Steve. Nothing.
“Upgrades look good.” Tony hummed to himself, crossing his hands behind his head as he leaned back in his chair with his feet on his desk. “Give yourself a raise, Friday.”
But the air remained still, the battlefield a host of tense bodies. Everyone was froze in anticipation.
Tony paused briefly, a chuckle escaping his mouth as he fiddled with his cufflinks. He stepped into the view of the mirror, his eyes trailing across his visible body.
“But. You already know that.” Steve began to pull away in an attempt to sit up.
“You’re telling me,” Tony muttered, eyes roaming over his already faded scar. “This baby looks months old.”
“Oh, no, sweetheart.” Tony spoke up, stepping into Peter’s line of sight. “Uncle Bucky–“ The brunet cut himself off to shoot the man in question a glare before pulling back to send his child a reassuring smile. “He was only joking. He meant Uncle Rhodey was teasing him over... a game. Because Bucky lost.”
Rhodey squeezed his hand.
Tony thought himself selfish while Steve thought of him as a coward. The brunet could’ve laughed if not for the growing tension in the room.
“Bruce and I, hell, Pepper too,” Rhodey added, reaching out to grasp Tony’s hand, “We found your phone.”
Now that he thought about it, Steve
“Thank you!” Peter bounced on his feet, throwing his arms around Steve’s legs. “It was a heavy door.”
“Is, is this a rash?” Tony motioned to his neck, pressing the tips of his fingers to his skin, “Yeah. I think I’m breaking out.”
Tony almost pinched himself. Steve wasn’t bullshitting the situation. He was... owning up to his mistakes. Tony didn’t know how to feel. He struggled with acknowledging the regret swimming in Steve’s eyes. Somehow, Steve knowing he fucked up made this situation more difficult. Tony had expected for the entire disagreement over the Accords to erupt. He was prepared to point out Steve’s flaws, not for Steve to truly apologize. Tony was at a loss.
He tasted blood.
, but it didn’t mean he wasn’t above such immaturity. He was professional when the time called for it; and quite frankly, now was not that time. Especially if Steve’s tone had any say in it.
This felt like a promise.
The billionaire knew that. He had been forced to witness Steve’s death at the hands of the alien fiend, Thanos. He hadn’t felt that useless since he was in the cave, held captive by the Ten Rings.
“Oh.” Tony’s mouth parted, feel confused and shocked at once. His mind began to frantically whirl, trying to make sense of what he was hearing. The genius wasn’t oblivious to Steve’s attempt at offering an olive branch. The brunet swallowed before speaking hesitantly. “Is that– is that
“I know you don’t want it to. But what if it’s out of your control?” Steve spoke, his voice cracking.
“Tony!”
“Steve...” Tony spoke in complete fondness. He couldn’t even hide the look of awe on his face. The blond just had a way of making every request, no matter how small, sound so significant. As if it all mattered so much. And the truth was? It did. “Of course.” He broke into light laughter, reaching up to cup the blond’s cheek. “Of course I’ll dance with you.”
Steve knows countless people made the mistake of assuming that Bucky was his soulmate. The way he reacted when Bucky had been a wanted fugitive didn’t help matters. He knew this. There had even once been a time when he had wished Bucky was his soulmate. It would’ve been easier, safer.
“I.. I know I hurt you,” Steve whispered, sounding defeated, “I know how it looks. I didn’t.. I didn’t realize that until it was too late. Natasha.. she explained.”
Tony shushed him, his eyes burning at the sound of Steve’s choked words. Anger coursed through his veins, igniting him once more. You don’t have the right to be upset, you left, is what he wanted to snap at him. But not now. They’ve lost too much already, Tony could sense that. This wasn’t a time for sharp words. This was bigger than their disagreement. He exhaled again.
“Sorry my trauma was such an inconvenience,” Tony yawned, running a hand through his disheveled hair, “I’ll make sure to redirect it in a different fashion next time.”
“He came because of you,” Rhodey spoke slowly, his eyes glazing over briefly, “I thought, ‘Man, Tones and I had a long run. This feels like... this is it.’ I felt hopeless. We didn’t know where you were or how to even start to try and find you. And they knew even less than us. But we called them anyways. And Steve came.”
Feared because he knew he couldn’t live without this, now. Not after having it. He would crave this for as long as he lived.
“Us, Tony, what about our relationship?” Steve stressed the last part, his expression seeming hopeful.
“Tony,” Steve sighed, shoulders slumping, “I mean.. Alone. Without everyone in the kitchen pretending they’re not eavesdropping. Please?”
“I supposed they fixed it.” Steve cleared his throat, a smug tone laced in his voice.
have a chance or if I should go. Because I will, I’ll leave you alone. I won’t ever force your hand.”
“Our feelings, friendships, mindset, personalities, you name it.” Steve spoke, his voice breaking into a murmur at the next bit. “
“What?” Tony squawked, attempting to twist around to peer up at the blond.
The pair, Rhodey and Thor, had been quick to set up oxygen tanks and masks before transporting Tony and Nebula to their larger, more equipped aircraft. It was then that Tony realized his friends hadn’t come alone. If he had more strength he might’ve been able to make a playful quip about Rocket’s animal nature, or even been the one to question Carol’s presence.
All logical thinking went flying out the window as soon as Tony could make out a familiar silhouette. The light energy from the outline of the worm hole cast a blue filter over the blond hair of one, Steve Rogers. It was instinct, almost; the way Tony didn’t waste a second in order to dive right through. He could almost hear Pepper and Rhodey reprimanding him.
“Always.” Steve offered him a faux salute, stepping back before a pensive look took over his features. “If there’s ever any trouble on your end that your guys can’t handle... well. You know where to find us.”
. As if they were in some new modern game or horror movie. No, this was reality. Or, well, what was left of it. The blond got to his feet, the chair letting out a sharp cry as it scraped against the marble floor.
Steve let a small smile curl around his mouth.
So, no. Steve wouldn’t change his soulmate or have it any other way. He wanted Tony’s sharp tongue and witty remarks. He longed for the billionaire’s embrace and smell of whatever foreign cologne he had decided to wear for the day. He missed sleeping with Tony at his side. The warmth Tony produced. The way he smiled softly when Steve told him he loved him. Steve felt like a better man with Tony by his side.
” Steve squeezed his eyes shut, sucking in a shaky breath. “Because a world- Tony, a world without you isn't one I want to live in.”
Tony shrugged.
“I know what you’re gonna say, Steve.” The last word was emphasized bitterly before Tony schooled his features back into one of sorrow. “You’re all, noble. You’ll go back to a timeline where this... won’t exist. It just. It doesn’t seem fair. Not to you.”
They would be okay.
“Overwhelm him... detrimental to his health.”
This was the familiar sensation of an asthma attack.
“I loved you then,” Steve’s voice broke, “And I still love you now.”
“Ugh,” Tony croaked, a strangled chuckle slipping past his dry lips, “Don’t think you should smack talk the patient.”
“You don’t get to tell me how I feel,” Steve turned to look at him, clearing the distance between them with his eyes narrowed in defiance, “You can tell me I’m wrong and that I’m arrogant. But what gives you the right to tell me how I feel–“
Tony inhaled, his breath hitching as pain sharply radiated down his side and through his chest. The misshapen bandage threatened to cut his oxygen supply off as it dug into his ribcage. He instinctively went to clutch it, tensing up briefly as Nebula snatched his arm back, shaking her head slightly as their gazes crossed.
He knew it was time to stop living in the past.
“What’s wrong with him?” Natasha asked, not unkindly.
The brunet threw his head back with a snort, a grin tugging at his lips at the sound of Steve’s own light chuckle. Tony began tugging the blond towards the stairs, their fingers lacing together as they climbed them.
“I fell asleep on my bed after drawing the skyline because my room had the best view of the sunset,” Steve ignored him, which, wouldn’t be a first, “And you stumbled in around five in the morning and crawled in beside me.”
“I am trying to keep the team together.” Tony ground out.
Not this time.
________
“I’m good,” Tony conceded, keeping his gaze on his lap, “Doc said I should be good as new. Minimal scarring.”
“It was never a no.” Tony’s voice croaked, thick with emotion. “It was a
But... Steve was trying. He was getting help, maybe not for Tony specifically, but for himself. That was improvement, wasn’t it? Tony certainly believed so. The blond had realized he wasn’t coping well and was trying to change that into something much healthier.
Steve broke out into a sprint as soon as he caught sight of Thor’s head. His heart violently thudded against his chest as he grew closer to the ship. He came to a halt at the edge of the lowered platform. For a brief second, it occurred to him to consider maintaining his composure.
Tony watched after the two until their figures disappeared into the house. The sound of Peter’s tinkling laughter and Steve’s muffled voice could be heard from the brunet’s position on the deck. He smiled softly, his stance gentling as he turned back towards the front yard. His eyes scanned the yard line as he absentmindedly reached for his abandoned mug of coffee.
“Sorry, Petey.” Tony apologized, a smirk curling around his lips as he bopped the toddler’s nose. “Pops likes the scratchy. ‘Says I look quite
They had Peter, too.
“Of course.” Tony nodded, plastering what he hoped to be a reassuring smile across his face. “I just need a few, I’ll meet you at the car?”
favor.”
“I– What does that have to do with anything?” Tony faltered.
“Why, Platypus, I’d say you were concerned about me.” Tony rasped, wincing from the sensation of his cracked, dry lips stretching from his attempt of a smile.
When Earth-199999 Tony had found him, and thanked him in his own way. He had reminded Tony of his value. Tony had listened to his younger self talk about how he may have made the difference in Steve’s life.
“Hell, Tony.” Steve barked. “Why not the truth?”
“I thought I was hallucinating. Thor told me you were alive but I didn’t entirely believe him. He might have been trying to spare me.” Tony gasped, clutching at the fabric of Steve’s shirt. “I thought I had an infection. But I could taste it. It was so sweet. The mint.”
What was Steve up to?
“Tony,” yeah, that most certainly was Steve’s voice.
“We make that choice.” Tony countered, his voice staying level as a hint of warning colored his tone. “That’s on us. The civilians who are forced to relocate after our destruction don’t. The innocent individuals caught up in our battles... Steve. You see where I’m coming from.”
“No bully.” Tony agreed, reaching out to tickle Peter’s stomach. “Papa doesn’t like bullies, remember? And he’s friends with Uncle Rhodey. So that must mean...”
“..critical condition.”
went unspoken.
“I don’t understand,” Tony was at loss.
There was his confirmation. Gotta love Rhodey.
