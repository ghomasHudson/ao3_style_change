“I’d prefer to keep Mycroft out of our bedroom, John,” he muttered low.  John froze and let go of Sherlock, shifting his head around to stare at him.  He broke out into a fit of giggles and prodded Sherlock in the side, causing him to yelp.
Sherlock stared at John’s worried face and considered his options.  He could easily lie and hope John dropped the subject, but given how obviously transparent he was being tonight, it seemed unlikely that he would let Sherlock rest without finding out the truth.  He clenched his eyes shut and sighed, resigning himself.  He wouldn’t reveal everything that happened in the hopes of keeping John from worrying, but he was tired of keeping his issues fully to himself.
At a quarter to six, John led Sherlock and Cecelia to the Great Hall, Cecelia skipping down the stones and Sherlock with his hands dug deep down into his pockets.  Cecelia was ecstatic to have a meal in ‘her bedroom hall,’ as she insisted on referring to it, but John could tell Sherlock was nervous.  Before they reached the hall, he felt around in Sherlock’s pocket to pull out his hand and clutch it in a tight grip.
“I…don’t know what to say.”  Sherlock cleared his throat and refused to meet John’s eyes. “Thank you, John.  It would have ruined everything, but thank you for the thought.”
“No, which is why it’s weird. It feels like I’m on patrol and someone’s following us.” Sherlock glanced up into one of the corners of the room as they headed towards the stairs, where John thought one of the security cameras sat. He didn’t say anything as they entered the staged area, however, and John attempted to shake off his uncomfortable feeling and focus on the performance.
Sherlock hummed and his face softened almost unnoticeably.  “Yes, a pleasure,” he said, surprising John by offering his hand to shake.  “You and Albus ought to stop by and have tea with us properly at some point.  And if anyone – “  His glance shot up to narrow around the room, landing specifically on those he noticed talking amongst themselves when Sherlock was announced as John’s partner earlier.  “Should bother either of you, do not hesitate to inform one of us.  We will see to the matter personally.”
“Wow.” Niall let out a breath and shook his head. “You really are in love with him.”
“I’ll get her settled into bed,” Sherlock said.  “Thank you for your help this evening, Molly.  It was much appreciated.”  Without waiting for a reply, he trotted up the stairs to Cecelia’s room.  Lestrade chuckled and led Molly towards the stairs leading to the front door.
"You wouldn’t kiss me this week,” he finally muttered, his voice rumbling where their chests touched. “I could tell you wanted to but you didn’t. Why?”
John rolled his neck, scratching at the back of it. “Well, that’s…yeah, that both a bit flattering and a lot creepy. How’d they manage to write it and be at the show at the same time?”
“Here’s your sock, John,” he said as he handed the item over.  “Honestly, why do you even bother wearing them to bed if you always kick them off and lose them…good morning, Cecelia.”
“Nobody…nobody wants to be my friend.  They all say I’m weird and that nobody would want to be friends with me.”
“Well, whatever it is, he was made to be with kids.”  The two continued to watch as Sherlock spoke quietly to Cecelia, lifting papers to gesture at something on them and add commentary.  Although there was no way for her to understand the scientific gibberish he spoke, she watched intently as though completely riveted, occasionally murmuring back and attempting to grab at the sheets.  Sherlock always managed to keep them just out of reach, shooting her a warm smile at every attempt.  John felt himself echoing the smile without intending to, enjoying the sight as though she actually were Sherlock’s own.  Though unrelated biologically, John had considered Sherlock as a secondary parent to her since they discovered she existed, holding just as important a role in Cecelia’s life as Mary or him.  He wasn’t entirely sure how healthy such an idea was, but it was true all the same.
“Never doubt a woman whose students and home have been threatened,” the woman replied seriously, causing Sherlock’s rapid dissection to screech to a halt.  “I’m certain if anyone could understand something of that sort, it would be you.”
John would be
“Let me?” John asked quietly. Blinking once, Sherlock nodded his head, the movement almost small enough that John didn’t catch it. Keeping his face open and reassuring, John pulled Sherlock along and helped him up onto the dais, guiding him to his knees with his arse resting on his heels. As Sherlock’s gaze slowly rose up to John’s, his eyelashes fluttering nervously, John swallowed down his moan of affectionate need. He lowered himself to his own knees, cupping Sherlock’s jaw in both hands as he ran his thumbs along his cheekbones.
“They were both well enough when we checked on them last hour,” Havens explained as Sherlock pushed past the few Aurors outside to inspect the body.  John instantly recognized Yaxley even from his position at the doorway.  “The only ways in or out are from the opposite staircases, and Faulkner and I were stationed one at each this whole time.  It wouldn’t be the first time a prisoner killed himself, but this looks too much like the Killing Curse for it not to be that.  The only ones who have access to wands are the Aurors, so they had to have been attacked.”
“I figured as much. Poor kid got a shit job for the evening.”
He was interrupted by the room suddenly going quiet as McGonagall entered the hall, a group of wide eyed first years reluctantly following behind her.  They watched in silence as the sorting hat was placed before them and began its song as usual.  John shot glances at Sherlock and Cecelia throughout, enjoying their expressions of amazement as they watched the proceedings.  When the first student tentatively approached the hat, John reached behind Cecelia’s chair for Sherlock’s hand.  Once Sherlock offered his palm, John began tapping his index finger against it lightly.  Sherlock caught the first word of Morse code and smiled to himself as he began translating automatically.
Uncurling himself enough to take the laptop, he stared down at the OnlyFans creator page, identical to his own except with John’s name and face instead. He scrolled down just enough to glimpse a picture of a naked John grinning playfully at the camera before hurriedly pushing the laptop back. “I don’t understand…why do you have an OnlyFans?”
John frowned and eventually made his way over to his chair, contorting himself around the pillows so he could sit in it.  Cecelia glanced up and babbled nonsense words at him, seemingly questioning him.  He shrugged at her and she continued to mutter down at her train, occasionally pushing it against his foot.
“Do you trust him, John?” Sherlock muttered low so Neville couldn’t hear him.  “Can we?”
John elbowed Harry’s side as he went past, making him chuckle.  “I’ve been waiting on this long enough, Harry James Potter, so let me have my intimate moment.  You’ve enough experience with kids to know we don’t get to have these opportunities very often.”
John practically slid down the hill from his dorm to the main campus, his pounding footsteps echoing in the tunnel between the music buildings before he burst out into the snowy grounds.  A few people were making their way between their dorms and the campus centre or library, but the quad itself remained untouched, a blank slate of perfect whiteness.  When he didn’t immediately see Greg or Molly, he shot inside the centre and up the stairs to the dining hall, grabbing a bagel and a banana before rushing back outside.  He was in the process of shoving the entire banana into his mouth when Greg waved at him, pointing at the middle of the quad and running towards it.  Molly followed at a slower pace behind him.
“No,” John snapped, raising his wand at him automatically as he grew more furious.  “No, she is better than Mary ever was.  She’s brilliant and skilled, but she is good and kind most of all.  She will never be her mother because she is being raised better, because she has someone like Sherlock to make sure she stays right.”
“Already ordered us a cab?  I’m honoured, John.”  They settled in close, John placing a hand comfortably on Sherlock’s thigh as he nodded for the cabbie to go.
“Hey, you alright?” he asked, holding out his free hand to Sherlock.  Instantly Sherlock crossed the distance between them, curling himself up in John’s lap.  Growing more concerned, John set his wine on the floor and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s back and shoulders.  Running his fingers up and down his spine, John slowly massaged the tenseness out of his back until he lay pliant and comfortable in his arms.
They were gone before the others had even gotten through the front gate.
Sherlock’s bed sat directly under their window against the wall, John’s along the wall to the right. At the moment, Sherlock knelt on his bed, the soft afternoon light of early winter peering in through their semi-transparent curtains. Rather than slouching over his desk studying or sprawled out on his bed with his laptop as John expected, however, Sherlock was completely nude, the sunlight making his pale skin glow. His knees were spread wide and John spotted a thick black dildo between them that disappeared in time with Sherlock’s thrusts down onto it. His head was thrown back as one of his hands ran down his neck, his long fingers dancing along his own skin. Most surprising was the tripod set up on the floor with an expensive looking camera pointed directly at him, recording everything Sherlock did.
“If she’s hungry – “
“Her…” Sherlock muttered, his forehead knitted in confusion.  Suddenly his mouth formed a small O as his face smoothed out in understanding.  “Mary.”
“No shit you found magic.  I meant something a little more specific, maybe along the lines of Mary and her past?”
Niall pointed out the various cameras hidden in the second room as well, explaining that they also had infrared capabilities to make it easier to see what happened in the recordings even in the low light. Rising up the lights fully to help them see, Niall left them to explore the two rooms while he prepared for the evening’s show. With a promise to send up employees to interview as they arrived, he disappeared up the almost hidden staircase that led to the performance area.
John nodded, hands shoved comfortably in his jeans pockets.  “It was right after we moved back in, long before Cecelia even paid it any attention.  Painted it by hand as a surprise for both of us.  Apparently he designed it specifically after the night sky above the Hufflepuff table.”
The head table had been returned to its usual seating arrangement, turned to face the four House tables.  A scattering of professors had already arrived and stood chatting amongst themselves in their assigned seats.  When Neville spotted them, he waved them over.
A tiny smile appeared on Sherlock’s lip and he nodded tentatively.  “That…would be nice.  I’m not finished for another hour, however.”
Their landing was more confident than when they travelled to Godric’s Hollow, John’s leg quivering only slightly as they touched down but standing firm.  He gave it an instant reflex shake to loosen the muscles and checked on Cecelia, who slept through the entire ordeal.  She snuggled in closer to John’s chest when he tucked the wrap around her once more.  Sherlock, meanwhile, glanced around them at their surroundings with an intense interest, attempting to take everything in by the subtle glow of the flickering lights inside nearby buildings.  Behind their backs, the muffled noises of people talking, glasses shifting about, and dull music emanated from the Three Broomsticks.  From the sounds of it, the pub was preparing to close down soon, its remaining patrons gradually making their way home or back to their rooms above.
“Their biggest connection is me,” John replied in an equally low voice.  “But that doesn’t explain – “
“Normal is boring,” Sherlock murmured into John’s hair.  “You’d never be able to settle for normal.”
“Wednesday?”  John chuckled and wrapped one of Sherlock’s enormous hands in his.
A figure paused at the top of the street, shoulders hunched into its jacket.  Its head slowly shifted from one side to the other, considering options, before setting off straight ahead.  As it passed a single narrow alleyway, its shadow darted high and threatening over it, leading it toward a destination before shifting to follow behind.  Before long, the figure paused, hooded face lifting toward the building opposite.
Sherlock tapped back after John squeezed his hand to indicate he was finished.
They rejoined her just as she reached the front doors, a small smile curling her lips.  Cecelia had nearly been bouncing in her excitement, and when they actually entered, her tiny mouth fell open in shock.  Sherlock nearly dragged her to get her to follow them inside, her eyes enormous as she tried to take everything in at once.  When they passed the opened doors to the Great Hall, she let out a great gasp and pulled her hand out of Sherlock’s.  Running into the room, her footsteps echoing in the silent hall, she instantly looked up at the ceiling.
“Sorry, I should probably leave you alone.  I’m sure you have something better to do with your Christmas Eve than chat with some bloke at a Chinese restaurant.”
John’s face turned stern and his shoulders set themselves in a sturdy pose, his head bobbing in a nod to himself as he met Sherlock’s eyes.  “No, not now.  We’ve a case on now.  Focus, Sherlock – dead bodies, remember?”
!” John shouted, dashing forward and letting the shield fall to examine him.  “Jesus, Sherlock, when I tell you to stay down, you fucking need to
“Just a friend,” John replied, but his eyes mirrored Dumbledore’s in his peripherals.  “At least for the moment.  I’m, ah, actually married.”
“Shit, I’m sorry, I didn’t…I wasn’t…”  John lost his voice when the man tucked his book into his bag and pulled off his hat, revealing a head of dark curls.  He used the hat to rub at the moisture on his face, looking down at it in astonished silence when he finished.  Without thinking, John stuffed his gloves into his pocket and cradled the man’s cheeks in his hands, tilting his face from side to side to look for any damage.  His thumbs automatically stroked his cheekbones to soothe him, grinning up at him in a mixture of apology and amusement at the man’s dazed expression.  “Alright?”
On a broken down street
Wincing, John sipped at his drink. “That transparent, am I? And he really doesn’t. I didn’t exaggerate on the blog when I said that he doesn’t let many people in.”
Before he left the flat that night, John found where Sherlock stored the military pin after they found it and pocketed it. Whether he did choose to wear it or not, he suspected Sherlock had plans for it and wanted it that night. He still had no idea who their culprit was, or if Sherlock had any clear idea, but as usual he decided to lay his trust in Sherlock. He would reveal their suspect when he felt ready, and certainly wouldn’t give up on the case until it was solved.
“Okay, Miss Sass, thanks for that insightful input,” John muttered, rolling his eyes.  “Remind me to make sure Uncle James is around the next time Uncle Mycroft agrees to look after you.  I think you’ve been listening to Mycroft’s tirades about our lives a little too much.”  Before Cecelia could reply, a pair of students burst into the wing, one guiding the other along.  The student being led was almost completely covered in long, thick hair, concealing their face and nearly tripping them up as they walked.  John sighed while Cecelia giggled and approached them, running her fingers through the hair that trailed across the floor.
It came in
Save Mycroft Holmes From Himself 2kforever (also here's hoping I didn't completely fuck up my son's voice)
John grabbed at his waist, his thumbs tracing across the edge of his pants.  Sherlock jumped slightly, blinking down at John with large eyes as he held his mug and mobile aloft and out of John’s way.  With a half grin and lowered lashes, John shifted his grip along Sherlock’s stomach, the calloused tips of his fingers barely brushing against the now shivering skin.  He danced them down to feel along the expensive material that was nearly as delicate as the body beneath it.  Pressing down just enough to feel the muscles tensing underneath his touch, John followed their shape as they guided him towards the cock that was quickly seeking his attention.
“Not that we know of, but we’re still clearing things up,” Niall replied. Before he could continue, a young woman wearing a robe marched towards them, dragging another pale faced woman behind her.
“I think half of it is simply realizing that this is what’s stopping me.”  He pulled out his wand from his trouser pocket and stared at it.  “I’ve never been able to accomplish anything truly solid in regard to magic, which has caused me to lose any belief in myself I might have had when it comes to being a wizard.  But if I look at it from this standpoint, I can see it as a sort of…”  He paused and cleared his throat before continuing.  “A virus, I suppose, and now that I know it exists, I can make the appropriate moves to rid myself of it.”  He swallowed thickly and seemed to lose himself in staring at his wand.  John, concerned at the sudden vacant expression in his eyes, approached him and set a light hand on his wrist.  The movement jolted him and he shook his head, turning to stare at John instead.
John’s face softened and he leaned over to squeeze Sherlock’s hand.  “You romantic sod.  Alright, we’ll give it a shot.  Should be an adventure, if nothing else.”
“We’ll take it out of Niall’s bill,” he eventually breathed out, stroking the silk of Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock smiled as he glanced up at John and moved up to wrap his lips around one of John’s nipples. John’s grip tightened and he glanced away, hoping to calm himself from the sensations by looking away from him. The mirror worked against his plan, however, but John wasn’t entirely sure he minded. Sherlock’s striped and ruffled arse bobbed in the air as he moved, the split sides of his shirt parting just right to reveal his socks. As he moved from one nipple to the other, his calves shifted under them and John saw the muscles strain. Half of him wished he could reach more than Sherlock’s head, but the other knew having more access would distract him from what Sherlock was doing with his tongue.
Sherlock’s hand came down to settle on John’s waist.  He let his head fall back and John’s lips settled on his jaw.  “There may be a few…suggestions in our bedroom.”
John’s eyes remained fixed on Sherlock as he moved down the row, his eyes darting back to John every few seconds.  “You know what, kid, I think I actually might.”
"Ah, you went right to the scene. I should have expected it." She was nodding as though they were carrying on a conversation about the weather, her voice calm and casual. Sherlock could see John's fingers around his wand turning white from how hard he held it, and the arm in front of his chest shook faintly in what he expected was barely contained anger. "Tell me what you think you know."
“Of course,” John chuckled.  He gestured Teddy to his armchair and pulled one of the kitchen chairs over to sit beside him.  “Anyway, this isn’t just a social call.  We really do need your help on this, Ted.”
Sherlock’s voice was almost too low to be heard.  “I cannot imagine Harry’s thrilled about that.”
“What did you do, Mycroft?” Sherlock muttered, twirling his wand thoughtfully.  He squinted and blinked, bringing himself out of his own thoughts.  “How did he get his job with the Ministry of Magic?” he asked his mother.
“Should I…”  John gestured at his groin, eyebrows knitted in concern.  “I don’t know if you want me to use a condom or anything.”
They sat side by side and Sherlock instantly wrapped his hands around his mug.  He stared down into the tea with an out of focus expression, causing his parents to glance worriedly at one another.  Under the table, John placed his free hand on Sherlock’s knee to encourage him.  He shot John a look and nodded, moving one of his hands to rest on John’s.
“Yeah, I don’t understand it any more than you do, honestly.  It’s just sort of always how it’s been.  I’ve never heard of magic working with technology or anything like that, but I’ve also never heard of anyone trying to make them work together.  Can you imagine if it did, though?  Wi-Fi at Hogwarts, using a mobile for spells, connecting your potion to your laptop to track its progress…if someone could get it to work, it could revitalize the wizarding world and how things are done.”
“Sherlock.  My name is Sherlock.”  John breathed out a deep sigh and rubbed a thumb slowly against the shell’s edge, the thumb touching Sherlock’s hand absentmindedly copying the motion against his skin.  In reply, Sherlock shifted so that his fingers were in the spaces between John’s and locked them into a proper hold.  As though he hadn’t done anything out of the ordinary, Sherlock continued, “I’m searching for a certain shell in particular.  Have you happened to spot any ostrea edulis?”
“Right. If you’re uncomfortable at all with anything I do, you have to tell me, yeah? Don’t suffer through it if you don’t have to. And don’t be afraid to use the safe word at any moment and I’ll stop.”
“Would…you like the first shower?” Sherlock asked, his eyes on the floor as he fiddled with one of his coat pockets. When John didn’t immediately respond, Sherlock rushed to continue. “I assumed you might, since you’re…” He gestured vaguely at John’s midsection before letting his arm fall limp at his side.
Sherlock hummed his agreement and turned the page.  John wondered if he should let the matter drop, but his mouth made the decision for him.  “I noticed you’ve been skipping more meals recently.  You know how I feel about that, Sherlock.  You might not be burning calories running all about London at the moment, but that doesn’t mean you can just stop eating.  You can’t expect to live off tea and biscuits; you’re not a teenager anymore.”
This time is ours,
“We’d be staying right at Hogwarts, then?” Sherlock asked excitedly, lifting his head just enough to meet John’s eyes.
“Somehow I knew you would want to go down there eventually,” Sherlock said with a smile, summoning their jackets.  Each day seemed to bring cooler weather, emphasised by how much more north they were than in London.  Cecelia scrambled into her jacket and rushed to the main doors, waiting anxiously for Sherlock to follow.  He pushed the doors open and she dashed off, following the path that led down to the greenhouses.
“Mm, you too.”
“Nope, not yet, not unless they forwent the rings,” James commented.  “If he’s anything like his brother, Sherlock would only take it off on pain of death.”
Sherlock continued to practice and improve his magic throughout the weekend.  Finally he had managed to find the right combination to allow the magic to work, successfully casting basic spells and brewing potions.  By Monday, he hardly went anywhere in the flat without his wand in hand, finding new spells to test out and studying their results.  John found himself grateful he’d placed a Homenum Revelio on both the flat doors in case Mrs. Hudson or another Muggle decided to drop by unexpectedly.
“Mycroft
“Sounds like he would be better off as a politician then,” Sherlock whispered back, making John huff a breath of laughter against his neck.  He was about to respond when a new voice interrupted.
Just because he refused to talk to John about how he felt about him, though, didn’t mean he wouldn’t take advantage of his newfound emotions. He started his OnlyFans page while at Cambridge, as a way of making his own money that Mycroft didn’t have any control over. Even though he was twenty years old, Mycroft still held sway over his trust fund until his next birthday, and therefore regulated his money with an iron fist. With a lot of care and a bit of using the good looks everyone claimed he had, he managed to create a successful system of creating content and saving the money away where Mycroft couldn’t touch it. At Cambridge he used it for cigarettes and drugs for his supposed friends, but at UCL with John, he found he didn’t need to use his money to impress anyone. He kept the page regardless, partially for the freedom he felt in doing something that would horrify Mycroft and partially because he simply enjoyed it. With John around providing plenty of inspiration, he had a good reason to make use of his newly found libido.
John waved him away as he stood.  “No, you stay.  If I’m lucky, it won’t be anything too bad and I’ll be back in ten minutes.  Just keep playing with your food trying to make it look like you’ve eaten more than you have.”  He grinned when Sherlock frowned up at him.  “If I’m not back in twenty minutes, assume it’s something bigger than a kid scraping themselves up on the moving stairs and come back to the castle.  The bill’s already taken care of, so all you’ve got to do is try to enjoy the rest of your meal.”  John kissed his forehead as he pulled on his jacket.  “Do try to actually eat some of that, love.  You’ve only eaten one real meal today, and I’m not sure I’d call tea and toast even that.  I’ll see you soon.”
“It was so much stronger than mine, we thought for sure you would get a letter inviting you to Hogwarts.”  Violet shook her head, her face etched with sadness.  “The things you did, Sherlock…levitating books off the top shelves, turning faucets on just by looking at them, setting fires in the fireplace and elsewhere.  It was exceptional.  And then, on your eleventh birthday…nothing came.  We didn’t even get a letter saying you didn’t have enough power, like I did years ago.  Thank God we never told you anything about potentially being a wizard because your disappointment would have been crushing.”
Sherlock’s gaze darted in uncertainty from the wand to John’s face, eventually reaching out a hesitant hand to take it.  John’s eyes locked on the wand as he came to stand close beside Sherlock.  “Hold it steady, no need for a motion on this one, and say Lumos.”
“Come to bed with me? Let me show you what I really wanted our first time to be like, just you and me.” At Sherlock’s nod, John shifted his feet down to the floor and led them both into Sherlock’s room.
John kissed the top of his head before heading for the kitchen.  “Of course, love.”
Sherlock’s expression remained neutral while he gazed down at John.  “Be magic.  Seriously, John?”
Sherlock stood at the same moment John did, passing Cecelia over to a baffled Ginny without sparing her a glance.  “Excellent idea, we ought to help Harry and his Aurors.  If they’re anything like Lestrade’s bunch of idiots, they’ll need it.”
. Normally I’d untie you now and make sure you don’t have any serious damage to your skin, but that’ll have to wait until later unless you feel some serious discomfort.”
Niall’s rented studio sat between a cosy tea shop and an art gallery, unassuming fronts for the curiosities in between. The bottom floor held a small reception area and a few offices with a short staircase that led to the performance areas. They met Ian at the front desk going through the forms for that night’s guests. His face lit up at the sight of Sherlock, practically ignoring Niall’s introduction of him and John to gush to the detective and guide him through a brief survey of the office areas. He looked to be close to Niall and John’s ages, with short cropped mousey brown hair and the slightly stocky build of someone who worked out just enough to boast about it. While Sherlock explored the desks and drawers, John caught up properly with Niall, the two of them sharing stories of their lives after graduation. Apparently Niall had been delighted to find John’s blog, both he and Ian becoming huge fans of their escapades. While having problems at the exhibit wasn’t ideal, Niall admitted that it gave him the perfect opportunity to finally reach out to John.
“This would be so much easier if we had access to direct Ministry files,” Sherlock muttered as he flipped through pages.  “I could ask Mycroft, obviously, but what a preposterous idea.”
Sherlock remained in the bedroom for the rest of the day and into the evening.  John tried to lure him out of his own head and comfort him, going in to join him after Cecelia had been put to bed.  He found him lying on his side facing away from the door, dressed in his full suit and on top of the covers.  His knees were bent up in a loose fetal position, so John moved to sit in the open space just below his bum.  John placed a hand on the lower half of his leg, rubbing and squeezing it through his trousers in what he hoped was a reassuring movement.  He waited to see if Sherlock was awake before he spoke.
Mycroft placed his hand on James’ knee, a genuinely regretful expression on his face.  “I am sorry, James.  I should have, I know, but it simply never came up after I revealed I work for the Ministry.”
“Nonsense, Mycroft, the place positively reeks of your presence.”  Sherlock glanced around him in veiled interest before taking off, John close behind.  “That new scent of yours if awful, by the way, I’m surprised Anthea hasn’t mentioned it.  She seems to be the only one of your various minions able to both tolerate your company as well as speak with you relatively honestly.  She’s one of them, isn’t she?  I never had the chance to bring it up before now.”
"You don't fully stand behind what he did, then," Sherlock prodded when he sense John was too incensed to reply. "You knew he was evil, yet followed his orders regardless."
“Sorry. Ian’s just been out of sorts the last few days and it’s starting to get to me. I think he’s worried about the messages and thefts like the rest of us, but he seemed to take the mess yesterday particularly hard.” He finally focused on their clothes and his eyes grew enormous. For a long moment, he simply gaped at them, before swallowing and shaking his head. “I’ll never be able to find a pair as good as you two again, you realise that? Not even my regular performers put this much effort into their performances.”
Sherlock smiled wickedly and took the bag, pulling out two smaller ones and tossing the first carelessly on the floor.  “I know how much you enjoy your baths, John, and I thought it would be nice for us to share one.  Why shouldn’t I go out of my way to make it even better by adding something extra to it?  It would be a shame to put such a pleasant tub to waste, after all.”
“Never would have expected it out of him, but I’m forever grateful for it.”  He raised his voice to call out to the other two.  “Oi, this is only the first spot!  There are still plenty of other places for us to check out – don’t you want to see our rooms?”
“Additional security should be placed around the two in Azkaban as quickly and silently as possible.  If we can, I’d like the opportunity to speak with them myself.”
“Look, Sherlock, I don’t know what to tell you,” Lestrade attempted to placate without an ounce of success.  “They’ve taken us all off it, moved up to someone in a higher position.  Don’t think I’m not just as upset at the lost opportunity.”  Indeed, Lestrade looked more strained than usual, the dark circles below his eyes hollow grooves that sucked the color from his cheeks.  From the tight set of his jaw, John could tell he was fuming at losing the case, though conveying his anger in less immature ways than Sherlock.
“John, I – “ Sherlock started to say, but John interrupted him.
John came and sat at his hip, resting his hand next to Sherlock’s.  “Should have known this is where you’d be.  And there’s no need to sound so ominous – it’s not as bad as it all sounds.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You have to admit, she’s brilliant,” Sherlock replied, looking back down at his gift.  “Tricky, but brilliant.”
She nodded and moved towards the front door.  “Of course.  It is the least we can do for what you’re doing for us.  Your office is right next door; simply turn the key I already gave you upside down and the door will admit you.  Would Sherlock like a normal key or one for the office as well?”
Cecelia lay rolling onto her stomach in her crib just as John walked in.  Sherlock, meanwhile, sat in the rocking chair beside her, his head tilted almost completely onto his shoulder and his mouth hanging slightly open.  A yellow blanket sat draped over one of his legs, almost falling to the floor, and an empty baby bottle slipped nearly out of his right hand.  As Cecelia gurgled at John, the noise startled a soft snore from Sherlock that jostled the bottle to the floor.  The plush rug silenced its fall and he slept on.
“And you love my cock,” he replied with a mischievous grin.  John pulled him into a quick kiss and started to walk them backwards to their room.
, my love,” John muttered, a crease of thought crossing his forehead.  His thumb settled between the baby’s brows, causing her forehead to furrow slightly.  “I wonder…” John’s voice trailed off, a huff of irritation coming out as he suddenly straightened.  “No.  It doesn’t matter.  The chance is small.”  He stiffened his spine and gave a sharp nod, closing the door with the smallest of clicks as he pulled it shut behind him.
“Six – I’ve left the list of names on the table in your dressing room downstairs.” Niall pointed behind them while digging around in his trouser pocket, pulling out a key on a rainbow keychain. “This is one of three keys to the room; Ian and I have the only other ones. The door automatically locks behind you to ensure privacy, so make sure one of you has it on you before you leave. Anything in here you’d like to use, just put it on the bed before you leave. I’ll keep the box of supplies in the dressing room as well, so you’re free to take anything from it prior to the performances as needed. I’ll send one of the security guards in to grab you when the customers start to arrive, but if you need anything, don’t be afraid to let someone know.” He traded John the lube for the key before glancing down at his watch and heading toward the stairs. “Ian and I will be down in the reception area, but I’ve got my mobile, so you can text me for anything. Just make sure you don’t use yours during the performances – the security will be in every room at all times, so they’ll be there if there are any issues. I’ll leave you two to get ready.” With a wave, he disappeared down the stairs.
“No, this isn’t your fault,” John interrupted firmly.  “If he’s the one saying it unprovoked, then he’s to blame, not you.  You are never at fault for how cruelty done to you makes you feel.”  He calmed when Sherlock nodded his agreement and pulled him back into a hug.  “Do you want to talk to Minerva about this?  If he says these things to you in private, it’s possible he’s doing the same with others, including students, and that’s definitely not on.”
“Coincidences don’t exist,” Sherlock growled when Doyle brought his wand to the back of Sherlock’s neck.  He felt him twirl the end around a curl at his nape and step in close enough that his front was flush with Sherlock’s back.  “Do you make it a point to lurk in dark corridors waiting to attack disinterested prey?”
“Heaven forbid we allow that to happen.  I’ve spent enough time locked away in one of those with your people to last me multiple lifetimes.”  Sherlock shivered visibly, causing Mycroft to roll his eyes.  He snatched up one of the bags John had brought and darted his gaze between John and Harry.  “Well, should we be off?  No time like the present.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You gotta check, Daddy!  You can see it too!”
Without answering, Sherlock’s eyes lit up and he jumped up from his comfortable position to launch himself toward the door.
“Mum, can I go over to Rose and Hugo’s today?  Hugo says they’ve got some bowtruckles living in the trees in their backyard and Aunt Hermione is going to teach us about them!  I won’t be out late, I swear!”
So for a long time, things went well. Sherlock filmed his content while John wasn’t home and their friendship remained intact. While secretly Sherlock would love for them to be something more, he was simply happy to have a friend at all. As long as John was too busy to think about dating, everything would turn out fine.
John shrugged.  “Not much different than how it went for me, honestly.  I told you, Ollivander knows what he’s doing.  He’s made each of these wands himself, used to even go out and fetch the woods and cores before he started getting on in age, and he’s got the feel of what will work for everyone.  Sometimes it take a few fuck ups to find the right combination, sure, but he inevitably gets the one eventually.”
When he emerged, John nearly choked on his own voice.  Although the outfit wasn’t particularly outlandish, it was different enough from Sherlock’s normal attire to be a shock.  Sherlock had managed to shimmy himself into a pair of dark wash jeans that were tight enough to practically be called leggings.  A simple emerald green t-shirt, its colour almost black and equally tight, lay under a jacket John had never seen him in before.
Written in all caps on the mirror in a dark red shade were the words WEAR IT OR ELSE. John leaned in next to Sherlock to study the words as Sherlock ran his finger along one of the letters, sniffing his fingertip when he pulled it away.
A muttering, followed by the distinct sounds of shuffling blankets and a babbling baby on the verge of tears, brought both of their attentions to the baby monitor on the mantle.  John sighed, rubbing a hand awkwardly over his face.
John leaned forward, naturally gravitating further into Sherlock’s space.  “You mean you’ve been doing that before you even knew we’d be coming back?  Just, I dunno, for when we came over to visit?  Before…everything?”
On the table sat another osiria rose, angled so that the petals were open and faced towards Sherlock’s head.  John had stopped leaving him roses after Christmas and Sherlock assumed the gifts were part of the holiday.  Perhaps he thought Sherlock could use a reminder of his love and decided to surprise him.  Sherlock was forced to admit to himself that he appreciated the sentiment of it as he lifted the rose onto his pillow and allowed himself to fall back to sleep.
“Yeah, let’s not give Greg a bloody heart attack while he’s on the job.”  Spotting a small, unoccupied churchyard, John led Sherlock along to sit side by side on one of the benches.  “I suppose we could ask them over for dinner sometime, maybe even make a going away party out of it.  We could have Mycroft and James over as well, have Mycroft as a sort of additional support…”
…I thought I could handle it, handle
As Harry tucked the camera away in his robes, one of his Aurors raced into the hospital wing, flustered and panicked.  Sherlock narrowed his eyes as the man approached before letting out an annoyed huff.  “Seriously, even Aurors?” he snapped before the man had a chance to say anything.  “I expected wizards to be more competent than Muggles purely from their added advantage of magical ability, but clearly it is the entire police force as a whole that is useless.”
“Is it that man Da’s told me stories about and tried to say they were just pretend?”
“None of my folk have said anything about it, no.  Corner’s a bit daft, but he’s not entirely stupid.  He’d know better than to let something happen without telling me or contacting Hannah about it.  But you know how it is now, John – we’re hardly as careful as we were before, and most of his folk are locked up or long dead.  Mudblood on their heads, you said?  Are you certain?”
Nearly a month spent packing and getting everything organized didn’t feel like nearly enough, but soon September approached and the last of what would be coming with them from Baker Street had been sent on to Hogwarts.  All that remained was to grab their bag of essentials and give a final tearful goodbye to Mrs. Hudson.  Once she had finally bid them farewell, squeezing Cecelia in a nearly bone cracking hug, and returned to her flat, all they needed to do was a last check of the flat before taking a Floo to Hogwarts.
“Having difficulties?” he asked, leaning a shoulder into the doorframe and crossing his legs at the ankles.  Laughter lines crinkled the corners of his eyes as he stared across at them.  Sherlock spotted one of Cecelia’s arms waving in irritation, a small fist attempting to pound into the edge of her wrap, and his eyes lit up.  The smirk at the side of his mouth turned into a full smile as he rushed forward and snatched her up.  Her gloom instantly vanished as soon as she was in Sherlock’s arms and she latched onto his silk shirt.  The two watched each other with glee and John felt warmth settle in his belly, the sensation like a bright fire burning warm after walking through a storm.

Sherlock sat in his usual chair at the kitchen table when John made his way down, the knife they’d found on the table before him. Without realising it, the tension John had felt since they found the note seemed to flow out of him in a sigh. Apparently the visual reassurance that Sherlock was fine, as well as his physical presence, was enough for the dom in John to calm for now. He went to the fridge and pulled out leftovers from the night before, setting it to heat up before starting on tea. He automatically made two cups and slid one across to Sherlock, sitting down across from him to watch him as he ate.
Violet grabbed his arm before he could pull too far away.  “I’m so proud of you, Sherlock,” she said quietly, forcing Sherlock to meet her eyes.  “So proud.  Next time you’ll have to show us some of that magic, hmm?”
“We’ve never met,” he said slowly, hand resting on the arm of her chair to balance himself.
“Sherlock,
“You couldn’t,” Sherlock insisted, resting his hands on John’s waist.  He squeezed briefly and tightened his hold.  “You’d never be able to fuck it up.”
John remained silent through the entire exchange, lacking the heart to apologize despite the fact that they couldn’t know he was at least partially at fault for what was happening.  After talking to McGonagall, John rang up the last phone number he had for the Potters, thankfully still the same.  After catching up with him a bit, he told Harry everything that happened at the crime scene, including Sherlock being able to enter the Leaky Cauldron.  Though Harry had no idea of how such a thing could have happened and encouraged John to ask Sherlock himself, he thanked him for the information and told him that his Aurors would pick up the case from the Muggle police.  When John tried to ask if they’d learned anything more on the deaths McGonagall spoke of, Harry could only lament the lack of additional knowledge.
“I’m sorry I didn’t realise that I wasn’t giving you the attention you deserve,” John countered.  “Or how bored you’ve been.”
John paused before the popping pan, grinning as he watched Sherlock move over to the fridge to pull out a container of juice and a package of bacon.  He passed the latter absentmindedly to John while pouring himself a glass of the juice, turning to consider Cecelia.  “Have you begun introducing her to traditional food yet, John?  Should I cut up an apple to see if she might enjoy it?  I know her teeth have only just started to come in, but if I soften it enough beforehand, I think she’s more than capable of giving it a try, and incorporating non-baby food early is said to be better for their overall development, at least from what I’ve read.”
John grinned to himself and pulled away, taking a brief moment to slick his cock.  He situated Sherlock’s legs to his liking, placing his heels against the back of his thighs.  He was about to slide forward when his head shot up in realization.  Releasing Sherlock’s ankle to cup his face, he waiting until his eyes fluttered open and focused on him.
“All right?” John asked once the final audience member headed upstairs. Sherlock frowned down at him.
“Good. That was…thank you.”
“Santa Claus and his various reiterations are simply ways in which parents create reasons for their misbehaving children to be forced into acting with better manners.  If you’d like to get specific, he originated from the Greek bishop Saint Nicholas of Myra, who is best known for the fact that he gave three young women dowries so that they would not be forced into prostitution.  Although it acts as a good overall message to illustrate to young people, I’m not entirely sure whether forced marriage and sexual favours in order to survive is really the sort of thing people would enjoy bringing up around the holidays, particularly to children.”
James attempted to stifle his laugh in a cough, but John could see his smile behind his hand.  Mycroft, meanwhile, frowned across at Sherlock, his cheeks flushing a very slight red.  “You don’t have the monopoly on relationships, brother dear,” he said stiffly after striding fully into the room.  “Besides, I seem to recall you mentioning once that I ought to find myself a goldfish.”
FUCK Doyle, am I right?  Anyway, the link in the text is to an image of the ring John has chosen.  There is specific meaning behind it, which John will tell you and Sherlock at a later time.  ;)
“Answer mine and I’ll answer yours,” John replied, keeping his eyes fixed on the book he wasn’t actually reading.  Sherlock sighed again and moved to stand before John and his chair.  Though he kept his head lowered, John glanced up at Sherlock through his lashes.
“You don’t have to explain yourself to me, love,” John interrupted. “It’s amazing, and so are you. And we are definitely exploring all of that at some point.” While Sherlock shyly smiled, John tried to ignore the various toys inside and picked out a lube. He shut the drawer with a snap and repositioned himself straddling Sherlock’s thighs.
“No,” John whispered shakily. “But I meant it anyway. Mean it. I. Yeah, I really do love you. I am completely in love with you.”
Sherlock instantly uncurled and crawled back up the bed, tucking himself into John’s side.  John wrapped an arm around his shoulders and kissed Sherlock’s temple.  He could tell Sherlock’s erection had abated and petted his hair.
!” John seethed, hands coiled into fits at his sides.  “And I ought to know absolutely bloody everything about her since I read every fucking document on that damn bastard of a flash drive!”  John made to turn and storm into the kitchen, but Teddy jerked him back around to focus on him.  John’s breaths came in deep and jagged as he silently fumed.
Mycroft rushed to catch up, a sour expression on his face as he took over leading them.  “Of course she is, Sherlock, how well off would I be in any sort of situation without at least one witch or wizard close at hand?  Now, if you would kindly let me – “
John snatched Jane up under her arms, hoisting her into her chair and pushing it close to the table.  She bounced in her seat, instantly snatching up one of the crayons John had brought along with them, and waited for John to sit next to her.  He chuckled at her enthusiasm and pulled open his bag, digging around until he found his notebook and placed it in front of her.  With her free hand, she immediately flipped it open to a blank page, staring expectantly up at John for instructions.
“I don’t fucking know, all right?”  Lestrade’s voice rose to a shout just as he clambered to his feet, hands grasping heavily at his hips.  He brushed a hand through his silver hair with a sigh.  “Look, maybe someone wasn’t too keen on having you on the case.  I know you’ve done your time and all that, but the fact is that you
He tossed the mobile onto Sherlock’s chair and leaned forward to look down at Cecelia.  “Well then, since our magic lesson’s been cut unexpectedly short, how about you and I take a trip over to Regents, hmm?  Stop and say hello to the ducks and geese, pop to a shop and get this place some real food?”
“Well, her husband
“Are you two finally getting married, then?” he asked with an enormous grin.  James leaned forward in his chair to study Sherlock’s hands.
.  Even if I hadn’t been desperate for a case to begin with, I would have jumped at the chance to investigate this one.”
A few chuckles scattered across the table as John lifted her up and rolled his eyes.  “Yeah, thanks for that, bee.  Only your papa is allowed to make jabs at my height, though.”
“That’s the only other place you mentioned, right?” John asked.  “We’ve just got Ollivanders left now?”
“So any theories as to why someone would be leaving the notes?” he asked. Sherlock chewed his bite, his forehead crinkling in thought.
Nuzzling into Sherlock’s neck, John pulled him back down to fully lie on the sofa.  “Thanks, baby.  We’ll see.”  For several minutes they simply remained entwined together, the dishes in the kitchen forgotten in favour of warm bodies and softly stroking hands.  As John toyed with the end of one of Sherlock’s curls, his eyes settled on various spots in their home, a fond smile ticking up one side of his mouth.  He tightened his grip to scratch at Sherlock’s scalp.  “Will you take your skull?”
“That’s closer!  It’s certainly something.  You’ve got the magic, Mrs. Holmes, that’s obvious, it’s simply finding a combination that has the right temperament for your
“You really just can’t turn that off, can you?”  Sherlock remained silent, waiting with surprising patience for John to continue.  John rested his forehead in his palm, staring intently down at the simple rug at their feet.  “Will it make you feel any better if I tell you that I was going to do some research in the library before I left?”
John huffed out a breathless laugh and shifted his hands, which had been absentmindedly toying with Sherlock’s nipples, down to his waist again.  He danced his fingers along the top of his trousers, dipping a couple of them down to rub the skin directly underneath.  Sherlock shuddered and he took mercy on him, efficiently undoing his belt and pulling it through the loops.  His button and zip soon followed suit and John shoved the edges aside to palm at his pants-clad cock.
John chuckled and went through a series of basic spells, shooting water across the sitting room in an arch, causing Sherlock’s laptop to disappear and reappear, and forcing the tea kettle to scrub itself clean.  Each new spell caused a new wave of curiosity and delight in Sherlock, increasing John’s enjoyment as well.  John was surprised with the ease he felt in going through the once frequent motions, his wand familiar and comfortable in his grasp.  On a whim, he said, “Orchideous Osiria!” and his grin broke out in a full smile as a bouquet of the duo-coloured roses grew from his wand’s tip.  He set aside his wand briefly to search out a vase, returning to the sitting room to arrange the roses on the mantle.
Sherlock scowled and drummed his hands on the wheel.  “It just doesn’t make sense.  I’m certain it has something to do with all of this, but I can’t imagine what without more information.”
“I…thank you,” he muttered, refusing to meet John’s eyes.  John was just about to introduce himself when a hand suddenly darted between them, grabbing the deserted fairy light boxes.  Both men snapped around and were greeted by the same irritable woman John encountered at the entrance.  She squinted at them briefly before stuffing the boxes into her basket and ambling off.  John let out a laugh and turned back to the man, who was frowning at the woman’s back.
Sherlock was already at the studio when John arrived. Wordlessly they went to their dressing room, managing to bypass Niall and any members of his team. As soon as the door closed, John pulled out the pin and held it out for Sherlock, who grinned broadly.
“Is he okay?” the man asked, doing his best not to stare at Sherlock. John felt a spike of protective irritation at the interruption and held Sherlock closer to his chest.
With an awkward shift in his seat, John grimaced.  “Well, er, no, actually, he doesn’t.  I was in a bit of a bad spot when I met Sherlock, and had basically decided I was done with magic.  The topic hasn’t had a reason to come up until recently.”
.”  John’s voice was deadly quiet and stern, having instantly reverted into the memory of being a captain at the threat.  Sherlock flinched slightly at the sharpness but didn’t move.  The tall man slowly inched forward, wand pointed directly at Sherlock, and squinted into the darkness.
“A pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Weasley,” Sherlock said as he shook her hand.  She placed her free hand on the other side of his, sandwiching it in her grip.
Mary nodded, her forehead rubbing against his bad shoulder with the movement.  John tried not to flinch, but given where his mind had been, it wasn’t a surprise that the motion caused a sensitive flashback jolting through him that he fought to subdue.  Luckily he was saved from a most likely uncomfortable discussion of how this trip wouldn’t do his still occasionally troubled mind much good by the sounds of a newly waking infant.
“Mine.” Sherlock looked down at himself, a frown worrying his mouth. “Is it alright? I can change – “
“What are these two called, then?” John asked as he dug his fingers into the muscles of Sherlock’s foot.  “They’re a nice mix.”
“Check.”
“Yes,” Sherlock gasped.  “Just.  Sensitive.”
Mycroft tilted his head, contemplating Sherlock while griping tightly at his umbrella.  “Yes, you would have.”
, language,” Sherlock agreed with narrowed eyes.  “Obviously we should have expected that if Mrs. Hudson was aware of our magic, others close to us might be as well.”
Sherlock turned back around and settled himself deeper against John’s chest.  “I suppose we should simply tell them the truth.  The three of them are really the only ones who ought to know – surely after years of what we’ve all gone through, they would be accepting of this.”
Teddy nodded.  “I’m still rubbish at haunted houses – Uncle John learned back when I was a kid that it was a bad idea to bring me to the Muggle ones.  Most of the time my reflexes can catch the changes, but every so often something slips through.”
Doyle’s smile continued to grow as Sherlock spoke, but he finally stepped away to give him some space.  “I’m aware of the situation.  Still, you can’t blame a bloke for trying when you’ve got a body like that.”
“We aren’t, as far as I know.  We’ve barely spoken since everything happened with Mary.  Frankly I’ve found the silence rather refreshing.”
Narrowing his eyes down at him seriously, John nodded once.  “You just need a cape and some teeth.  Then you can be Dracula for real!  Plee
Keeping a hand on Sherlock’s waist to reassure him that he wasn’t going far, John clamoured around to Sherlock’s back, intent on repeating the movements there. He suspected they were giving tonight’s audience quite the show, and surprisingly John felt a shot of pride at how well Sherlock was responding. In a moment of inspiration, John snatched up the tube of lube and squirted some between Sherlock’s clasped hands. He unbuttoned his trousers with shaking hands and pulled out his own cock, guiding it into the small space between Sherlock’s hands. Sherlock caught on quickly and adjusted his grip until John’s cock could comfortably thrust in his still closed grip.
Sherlock briefly released Cecelia’s hand as John took Sherlock’s face in a careful hold.  Sherlock’s eyebrows rose in question, but before he could voice anything John brought him closer to place a soft kiss on his lips.  When he pulled back, Sherlock blinked down at him, his expression so similar to what he wore after that first kiss that John felt his heart jump in his chest.
“Of course, it’s just we hadn’t actually discussed – “  He was cut off by John leaning forward to kiss him.  Sherlock’s straight posture instantly slumped down and toward John.
Sherlock’s face had turned slightly red, causing the green paint still on his cheek to stand out even more.  “Um, there are arts and crafts tubs on the shelves under the window.  Distribute them evenly between all of the tables?  I’ll take care of giving each of the students their workbooks.”
“I know you’re awake, Sherlock,” John said, his voice calm. Sherlock’s spine stiffened and he huffed out a sigh before reluctantly turning around. He sat with his back against the wall and his knees bent into his chest, his dressing gown wrapped around them. Staring down at his bare feet, he looked entirely different from the sensual Sherlock of earlier. John debated whether to stay on his side of the room or join Sherlock, but the sad expression on Sherlock’s face made the choice for him. When he climbed onto Sherlock’s bed and sat cross legged at his side, Sherlock turned wide eyes on John in silent question. John grinned back at him reassuringly and Sherlock lowered his eyes again, his cheeks turning faintly pink.
Sherlock threw his head back against the tank with a sigh, one of his hands absentmindedly running up and down John’s chest and stomach.  During one of his lower passes, he rediscovered John’s own bulge and his drowsy eyes lit up in interest.  He shot up in his seat to properly straddle the bike backwards, one of his hands tangling into John’s hair to pull him forward for a kiss while the other forced its way into John’s trousers.  Opening them just enough to wrap his fingers fully around John’s cock, he gave it a single long pull and grinned against John’s mouth as he groaned at the movement.
“Sherlock.”  John sighed and rubbed his face before following Sherlock to his feet.  He wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist and rested his cheek against his back.  “Of course it’s not bothering me; I’m just worried about you, that’s all.  I’ve never seen you so…I dunno, worked up, I guess?  You’ve never hidden away from a problem like this before and it’s freaking me out a bit.  If all of this is because of Doyle, something needs to be done about it.”
“I’ve already eliminated him as a suspect anyway,” Sherlock declared. “What sorts of things is Michael Clark interested in? I need to get his focus away from John tonight.”
From Sherlock’s frown, John knew he hadn’t succeeded.  As Cecelia skipped over to the coffee table to continue her colouring from earlier, twirling her dark violet dress as she went, Sherlock walked over to stand behind John’s chair.  He leaned down to wrap his arms around John’s chest, stroking along the smooth cashmere of his jumper.
“You didn’t hear about them in any of those tomes you read?” John asked.  At Sherlock’s shake of his head, he went on to explain.  “They draw the carriages the students ride in to get to and from Hogwarts and Hogsmeade.  Most people are pretty afraid of them – they can only be seen by those who have witnessed death firsthand.”
“May we join your class, Mr. Flitwick?” Cecelia asked sweetly.  Flitwick’s face softened at her question and he waved them inside.
John shuffled through the three types, pointed them out as he mentioned them.  “Your Galleons are the most, at seventeen Sickles or something like five hundred Knuts to one and around five pounds give or take exchange rates.  Sickles are the silver ones and have twenty-nine Knuts to it, and a bit more than twenty p in Muggle money.  Then you’ve got your Knut and that’s basically a penny.  This is it for us, yeah, and you’re out of luck if you want to use a card.”
“So we have two men, both the only ones with wands and the ability to perform magic in the vicinity, but neither of the wands did the spells that killed them,” John said slowly, raising his head from where he knelt staring at Yaxley’s body to look up at Sherlock.  As he did so, he held out an osiria rose in his open palm, offering it up as a bleak offering to him.  Sherlock was staring directly at him when their eyes met, a flash of encouragement in their now dark blue.  Though John didn’t continue his thought, Sherlock nodded in enthusiasm when he saw the austere understanding in John’s gaze.
“You’re both Muggleborns, then?”  Sherlock lifted his head to stare across at Doyle, who watched him over the rim of his glass.  His voice was light and airy, a soft Irish accent instantly reminding Sherlock of a dead man’s gleeful giggle and making him shiver.  John obviously noticed it as well, his grip on Sherlock’s thigh tightening in response.
They grabbed their jackets and waved their goodbyes before descending the stairs.  Once out on the street, Sherlock made to hail a cab but John stopped him by looping his arm through Sherlock’s elbow.  Sherlock raised an eyebrow in question but followed as John led him down the road, pulling him down a lesser used side street across and down from the flat.  John tucked them away from the gradually brightening street lamps and into an out of the way nook that wasn’t visible from the pavement.
John waved his free hand back at her in reply and brought Sherlock back into the sitting room.  The four others stood in a loose circle before the fireplace talking together, but they turned as soon as John and Sherlock entered.  Immediately Hermione approached and held out her hand for Sherlock to shake.
“She appears to be well,” Sherlock replied, running an enormous hand over her head in a manner meant more to comfort himself than anything.  He followed her eyes up to where they focused and studied the statue, squinting up at it with a few sharp blinks.  “Rather unusual place for a statue, since there are only a few random dottings of houses along this lane.  Where are we anyway?”
“Beauxbatons – my mother is French and insisted.”  Doyle shrugged as though the conclusion was obvious.  “My father was a Muggle and only minded because of how far away I would be, but he inevitably bowed to her demands.  I’ve always wanted to visit Hogwarts, however, so when I saw that there was an opening, I couldn’t help but try.  I was delighted to have succeeded.”
“John, isn’t it?” he asked, leaning his side against the wall beside him and crossing his arms. Pulling up his most charming smile, John nodded and watched him through his lashes as he took another sip. He watched Michael swallow as he glanced from his lips back up to his eyes. “I’ll be honest, I didn’t expect to find a former doctor working at one of these establishments.”
“They’re bastards, they are,” John agreed.  “I’ve only seen them once and that was enough.  Apparently they got rid of them from Azkaban after Voldemort was gone.”  John’s phone vibrated next to his leg, causing him to snatch it up and read the incoming text.  “Ah, perfect.  Teddy hasn’t left for the continent yet.  I wasn’t sure when he and Vicki were planning on heading out, since she’s got to be back by September for Hogwarts.”  At Sherlock’s questioning expression, John smirked.  “Well, I did say I knew two.”
!”  Cecelia interrupted his perusal of the room, jumping up from the round black rug at the foot of her bed to show him what she was creating.
As ever, thanks for the beta to
“You’d be willing to do that?” he asked Mycroft, barely containing his incredulity.  “Despite knowing what we could find out?”
Chuckling, John replied, “Yes, well.  Can’t help but blame myself for it, even if it’s not my fault.  I just wish Cecelia didn’t have to pay for my ridiculous mistakes, however indirectly.”
“Sherlock,” John choked out, his mouth gaping in surprise. “You can’t just…you do remember what they do at this exhibit, yeah?”
John had to hold in his gasp as his head darted around to Sherlock, who was nearly leaning forward into the bush in his intensity to hear more.  The deep furrow between his eyebrows told John that the news was just as baffling to Sherlock as it was to John, but even so, he didn’t feel particularly reassured.
Sherlock glanced down into the bag once more, leaning forward to reach a hand inside.  Soon his entire arm sat engulfed inside it as he attempted to reach the bottom, an expression of extreme concentration etched onto his face.  He strained forward on his toes to reach in further, letting out a muffled cry of success once he finally found it.  His head popped up around the bag’s rim, his hair tangled in various directions as he whipped around in search of John.
“Take us up to them,” Sherlock demanded, and they soon were racing up several flights of stairs to level five.  The area was swarmed with Aurors who all gave a start at the entrance of Harry.
Sherlock sighed, his usual air of being highly put upon by the stupidity of humanity radiating from the sound.  “You heard me, John, and you know how tedious I find repetition.  Now kindly elaborate on just how a dilapidated, abandoned building somehow transformed into a slightly less dilapidated pub.”
“Alright, just stop.”  John moved so that he sat behind Sherlock and wrapped his arms around his middle, resting his chin on Sherlock’s shoulder.  “First of all, I would never be disappointed in you.  Of course you won’t get it right on the first try, and there’s nothing wrong with that.  That’s why we’re going to work on it together.  But part of the reason why you’re having that trouble is because the wand isn’t yours – if we go get you one of your own, that actually chooses you and is the right fit for your magic, the spells will come to you more like they should.”
yet, if you’re interested.”
“Your papa’s already a keeper, but I’ll give it a shot.”  John winked as Sherlock groaned and rolled his eyes.  Albus and Scorpius snickered into their hands while Cecelia remained blissfully oblivious.
“Fuck it,” he muttered with a firm nod and surged forward, clashing their lips together in a motion that shuddered with satisfaction.  He carefully watched for Sherlock’s reaction, but after his initial jolt of surprise he melted into the sensation, his hands fluttering between grasping at John’s shoulders and entangling his fingers with his hair.  John thought for a moment he would have to catch him as his knees wobbled and he pushed closer, attempting to get further into Sherlock’s space while lifting his hands to cradle his skull in sure fingers.  One of the thestrals gave an abrupt snort that shocked them apart, although their faces remained close enough for their noses to brush.  John couldn’t help but grin up at Sherlock’s blank face, adjusting himself enough in Sherlock’s fierce grip to maneuver about and push a curl from his forehead.  Eventually Sherlock blinked back into awareness, the tiniest of smiles coming to his lips at the sight of John’s own.  “Okay?”
in front of them, Jesus.”
He decided to make a list of all possible acts he’d be willing to perform with Sherlock, going through it a second time to scratch out any that he wasn’t comfortable sharing in front of a group. Even he felt a shock of surprise at how long the list was, but he shrugged and passed it over for Sherlock to eliminate whatever he disagreed with as well. Sherlock’s face remained blank as he browsed through it and quickly passed it back, agreeing with each and letting John complete the final selections to give to Niall. Reluctantly John kept it fairly straightforward, although he couldn’t help but selfishly add a few particular kinks of his own to fulfill a few of his fantasies. He doubted he’d ever have any other chance to try them with Sherlock, so he couldn’t fault himself for taking the fullest advantage of the situation, as long as Sherlock was ready and willing.
“Investigating the mess our culprit left in the dressing room,” John explained. “You’d best get in there and see if anything’s missing.”
Sherlock barely stopped himself from punching him by reminding himself that doing so would do John more harm than anything else.  Instead, he used the now open space between them to step fully out of the aisle and into the library proper.  “I’d say that if you had any decency, you would refrain from forcing yourself on obviously disinterested parties, but clearly you would respect my words no more than you do faithful relationships.  This is your first and final warning: I am not nor will I ever be interested in pursuing
“Minerva McGonagall, allow me to introduce Cecelia Gabrielle Watson.  Cecy, say hello to your da’s old professor.”
“Oi, nobody wants to see that.  The snow isn’t going anywhere.”
“No, John.”  Sherlock lifted his head from John’s chest but kept his fingers knotted in his shirt to make sure he stayed close.  “I didn’t want you to know the whole of it, I didn’t want you to worry.  I didn’t expect…it just kept getting
The opportunity will arise
Slughorn’s expression turned troubled as he pulled out his wand, stirring the potion that Cecelia had been preparing nearly single-handedly from the instructions given to her.  “Not at that time, no.  My time at Hogwarts has been fraught with regret and bad choices.  I worked here once long ago, before either of you were born, and made the unfortunate choice to discuss very dangerous dark magic with a student named Tom Riddle.”
They spent the afternoon in their pajamas in the sitting room, working on Sherlock’s casting and spellwork.  Despite the fact that he had his own wand now, the magic still fought to work properly and Sherlock found himself growing frustrated quickly.
Alright, so fair warning, angst and plot development ahoy.  My beta
Niall perked up at that. “Thank God. Great job tonight, by the way – you two really are spectacular.” Behind him, Ian grumbled something and slouched further down toward the computer screen. Niall shot him a frown but neither of them said anything further.
“Figured that out on your own, did you?” Greg said as way of reply.  Sherlock rolled his eyes and wrapped his arm around John’s waist.
John offered to watch over Cecelia while Mary got ready, a suggestion she readily accepted.  Tossing his phone on the pillow as though he could toss away the memories that came with it, he returned to the crib’s side and scooped her into his arms, automatically smiling when she gurgled at the movement.  Her eyes shone brightly as she smiled up at him, the noises acting as her good morning greeting.  Though his daughter had been able to easily alter his mood regardless of the circumstances in the five months she had been theirs, John couldn’t keep fight down the dancing touches of reflection that Sherlock’s message had given him at bay.  The fact that it was July didn’t help the matter – not even fully reimmursing himself in the Muggle world could cause John to forget the celebrated birth of the Boy Who Lived.  He mentally counted back the years; Harry Potter would be thirty-five in a few brief weeks.
As soon as they were out in the hall between their rooms, John snagged Sherlock’s hand and pulled them both towards their own bedroom.  A few candles hung along the walls, unnoticed when they were unlit earlier in the day, and lit their way enough that John could easily guide them.  He briefly considered stopping to properly get them ready for bed, but when he noticed the unguardedly tired expression on Sherlock’s face, John decided that it could wait.  He settled Sherlock on the pillows on his usual side of the bed before climbing in and snuggling up to his side.
“Professor,” John nodded back, smile still plastered to his face.  “You are as well.  I admit I’m a bit surprised to see you still at Hogwarts.”
“Now you, baby,” John breathed against Sherlock’s lips, focusing his touch on the crown of Sherlock’s cock. “You’ve done so well; come for me.”
The first thing John required the moment he stepped off the tube was the biggest cup of coffee he could find.  Normally he was more of a tea drinker, but after a nearly nine hour plane ride directly after dealing with an attack on a nearby base, he needed more caffeine than tea could provide.  Luckily for him, coffee shops were nearly as common in London as pigeons, so finding one definitely wouldn’t be a problem.
“It’s Valentine’s Day, kiddo, that means I get to kiss your papa all I want,” John told her when they pulled apart.
When he didn’t continue, John leaned toward him out of his chair.  “But…?”
Sherlock yelped when John dug in hard against his prostate.  Instead of answering, John felt his cock grow larger in his hand before letting out a string of cum without any other warning.  His arse clutched at John’s cock automatically in a crushing hold and John shivered before following suit.  They gasped against each other, words lost and Sherlock’s release between them, and shook in the other’s arms.
“Oh Jesus.” He dropped the shirt he held and rushed for the door, pausing at the entrance. “Are you coming?”
“The language barrier certainly is a pain in the arse.”  John chewed a corner of his bacon and considered them.  “Could we try teaching her sign language?  Would that help?  Maybe get her development up a bit sooner, even.  Besides, can’t hurt to give her as many skills as possible, yeah?  Certainly would be a challenge for all of us.”
“John,” Sherlock murmured, running John’s palms over the silk of his button-down.  John let him do what he wanted with his hands, focusing on trailing his mouth back down Sherlock’s neck once more.  This time, he peppered each new spot with wet kisses, hinting at tiny bites at random moments to make Sherlock’s hips hitch up into open air.
John came away from the conversation relieved that the Aurors were taking care of the matter but tense knowing that Sherlock would not take kindly to having such a fascinating case snatched right out of his grasp.  He was proving John’s worries sound from the agitated way he paced about Lestrade’s office.
When Sherlock blinked his eyes blearily open, it was to a wispy sounding flash of something darting over his head.  He shot upward only to have the object collide with his cheek and fall with a clatter into his lap.  It gave a feeble jerk before unfolding from its shape, which with some consideration appeared to be a child’s paper aeroplane.  Written on the slightly crinkled sheet was a message from John.
“Da!” Cecelia said, her voice scandalized.  “Language!”
Sherlock watched as John headed to the bar, fighting to contain his smile and failing miserably.  He danced his fingers against his half full glass as he gazed absentmindedly across the nearly empty pub.  His thoughts returned, as they often did recently, to his suspicion that John would propose soon, wondering if this evening was meant to be more than just an anniversary meal.  Before he could grow too engrossed in his thoughts, a shadow at his side caused him to freeze and turn.
With a nod, Sherlock pushed himself to his feet and headed for the bedroom, John following close behind.
“I sent it out by our post with nothing more than Dumbledore’s name and hoped that would be enough to get it to him.  I still haven’t any idea if it reached him since I never received a reply, but when you never got a letter, I expected I had been successful.  Perhaps Dumbledore took it as a sign that the amount of magic you had would not make it worthwhile for you to attend, or perhaps it had no influence whatsoever.  Regardless, as soon as I realized what I had done, I regretted it immediately.  I had let my emotions win out over reason and vowed that would be the first and only time they would do so.
“Sure.  I’ll let the two of you know as soon as we get anything more.  Say hello to Mary and Cecy for me, will you?  I keep meaning to stop by and haven’t been able to find the bloody time.”
John was coming down to the flat proper from putting Cecelia down for her afternoon nap when he felt the spell activate.  He rushed down the rest of his steps and breathed a sigh of relief when it was Mycroft standing at the bottom of them.
“Heaven forbid I attempt to keep you from the great Sherlock Holmes,” Mary replied with a chuckle as she rinsed her hands.  She purposefully kept her head down, but even John could notice the twinge of sadness etched on the part her face he could see that accompanied her words.  “Go on, off with you, then, and be careful.  Give me a ring if you don’t think you’ll be back tonight.”
John nodded and shrugged out of his jacket. He considered the waistcoat and came to a quick decision, stripping off his shirt and buttoning it on across his bare chest. He dug around in the trousers until he found a shiny pair of black leather ones that vaguely reminded him of pirate breeches. As he turned to search for shoes, he spotted Sherlock and froze, his mouth falling open.
“There you are, Sherlock,” he said, approaching Sherlock and leaning up to kiss his cheek.  “I wondered where you got off to.  I turned to introduce you to Hermione and George and you were gone.”
Niall fidgeted, his eyes darting down to stare at the floor. “It started small – we’d be cleaning up at the end of the night, collecting clothes to wash before the next show, organizing the accessories, that sort of thing, when we’d notice a handful of items missing. It didn’t matter how careful we were to watch when customers were in the room, we inevitably lost at least three or four small items each night. We might have been fine if that was all, but then there were notes. Started with fairly innocuous comments, remarks about the actors that could be construed as a bit forward in the right light, but then they got…uncomfortable. Threatening. We’ve reached the point where some of our hired couples are too scared to finish out the week and quit partway through. The performance art scene is small enough that word travels fast, and add in the nature of what we’re doing and we’re having problems even getting people to apply to perform. The weird thing is, we’ve got people and cameras constantly going in every area where the problems are taking place but haven’t seen any sign of who’s doing it. I’m afraid that it’s an employee, but I’ve interviewed them all personally and can’t imagine any of them jeopardising it all like this. At this rate, we’ll be done within the next two weeks if it doesn’t stop.”
“Look, it’s getting late, but they’re not too far out of London.”  John glanced at Cecelia, who sat in her chair watching them with curiosity.  “Find your mobile and give them a call.  See if they’re home and maybe we can head out there tonight.  It’ll take a bit to get a car rented and figure out something with
“I beg your pardon, John Watson,” Niall sputtered, his cheeks turning a dull pink. “I’d hardly call it fancying. Besides, after seeing those thighs in rugby shorts, nearly all of the campus wanted a piece of that.” John’s burst of embarrassed giggles covered up Sherlock’s splutter of indignation.
“Oye, Sherlock!” Lestrade called out from the sundrenched opening to the alley.  “You get anything out of that barkeep?  And finish up in there, my people need to do their jobs!”
A light tapping briefly distracted John, forcing him to crack a single eye open in search of the noise.  Unable to find a source, his attention returned to the ministrations below.  His next moan came alongside a trio of sharper taps, this time louder than before.  Both of his eyes shot open and his brows furrowed in confusion.  Before he could return his focus to the situation below, the tapping began again, now a continuous stream of noise.  John huffed out a sigh of frustration as he patted at the hidden head halfway down the bed.
Sherlock looked up from his work, his face scrunching up in thought. “I…a bit different. From usual. That’s why I came out here. Usually I want to be alone, but I felt…itchy. I still do, if I’m being perfectly honest.”
The moment John Watson met Sherlock Holmes, he knew he was royally fucked.
“Okay.”  Sherlock leaned forward, careful not to dislodge John’s hands from his face, and kissed him slowly and softly.  John deepened the kiss, nipping at Sherlock’s lips until they opened for him.  With reluctance, John pulled away before he could get too overwhelmed and they both gulped down breaths.  “I’m sorry I’ve been worrying you so much as of late.”
“It is,” John replied, his hand tightening its grip on Sherlock’s.  “Everyone, this is my partner, Sherlock Holmes.  Sherlock, this is…well, a good portion of the immediate Weasley clan.”
for the beta!
“We’ve got something,” the first woman declared, thrusting a folded piece of paper at Sherlock. “I’m really sorry, Niall, I know we said we’d do a second week if you needed us, but this is unacceptable.”
“Where’s Minerva?” Sherlock asked, noticing that her chair at the centre of the table was still empty.  Neville peered around John to reply.
Not unlike Hogwarts, one couldn’t simply Apparate into the Ministry of Magic.  Various safe locations had been set up nearby, however, enabling John and Sherlock to get fairly close.  They both gave cautious glances around their surroundings before emerging from the camouflaged alleyway, John leading the way to the plain telephone booth he remembered as an entrance.   Neither spoke as it carried them into the heart of the Ministry, but Sherlock let out a long suffering groan when the door opened to reveal an all too familiar besuited man with an umbrella.
“Fucking tease,” he growled as he launched himself onto the bed.  He briefly grew distracted as the duvet brushed against his palms, sliding in his grip almost like water.  “Jesus, what is this made of, baby unicorn fur?”
John laughed outright and knelt at his side.  “It’s an Undetectable Extension Charm.  Makes everything on the inside larger so you can fit more in there, but you’d never be able to tell from the outside.  It’s a pretty nifty little piece of magic Harry reminded me of when I started packing everything up, otherwise it would have taken loads more trips.”
“I received another owl from Harry today with information on the wand – aspen wood, eight and a half inches long, with a unicorn tail hair core.  An unusual combination, given the aspen’s nature, but the addition of the unicorn hair has left the Aurors almost unable to use it due to its loyalty to its owner.”
“You’ll take it on? I was afraid it wouldn’t be exciting enough for you. From John’s blog, I thought you’d only take on something if it was like off the police shows on the telly.”
“Why not?” the librarian shot back.  His glasses fell down to the end of his nose, allowing him to watch John over the top of them.  “She’s going to find out eventually, you might as well tell her early.  It’s pointless to create such elaborate lies to trick your daughter only to have her realize it years in the future and become even further disillusioned.”
“PAPA!”
Sherlock shifted as though he was about to pull away, but John linked his fingers into his belt loops to keep him close.  He turned his head to glimpse at Violet, a bright grin on his face.  “We’re a couple of idiots, aren’t we?”
From somewhere near the lake, close enough to be heard but far enough to be unclear, a familiar voice was calling out desperately.  It approached quickly until Scorpius, his face etched in terror, appeared at the opening of the clearing.  He let out a relieved cry when he spotted John and Sherlock, bolting up to them at lightning speed.  He panted to catch his breath, his hands resting on his knees, before his head shot back up to stare at them.  His complexion, already as light as Sherlock’s most of the time, had paled further despite his run down from the castle and he could barely focus his eyes out of fear.
“Er.  Okay.  So like you said, the motion’s a swish and flick.  It needs to be pretty fluid, should move straight from the one into the other, and be done at the same time as you say the spell, just like what we did yesterday.  Just watch what I do with my wrist and copy it.”  John smiled and flicked his wand, waving with his other hand for Sherlock to mimic him.
Sherlock’s entire face turned bright red and he buried it in his knees. “I…yes?” his muffled voice squeaked out. “I…may have an account on a certain website…”
As Sherlock untangled himself from the bed, John turned his full attention to the letter.  His eyebrows rose the further along he read, his focus enough that he didn’t notice Sherlock letting the owl back out the window and guiding Cecelia into the kitchen.  Once he’d reached the letter’s end, he glanced up to say something to Sherlock and found himself alone.  Letting out a disappointed sigh at the blowjob that wasn’t meant to be, he pulled his sleep trousers back up around his waist and got out of bed to follow the noises in the kitchen.
“The petals have stopped.”  John glanced at the ground as well, finding nothing but rocks without a shot of burgundy or pearl standing out among them.  Sherlock held out the last petal he found and John took it, rubbing a thumb over the silky middle.  “Maybe they Apparated away.”
“We’ve never met.  I knew who you were instantly; it’s impossible to read a book on wizardkind without running across Albus Dumbledore at least half a dozen times.  You may recognize me for my brother, Mycroft Holmes.  I haven’t an exact time for when he began working for the Ministry, but Mycroft’s always been an infuriating goody-goody, so it wouldn’t surprise me to hear he was somehow involved even almost twenty years ago.”
John offered his hand and Sherlock took it, letting John guide him back to his feet.  He kept his grip as they walked to the coffee shop, the touch warming both of them more than the coffee ever could.
He ignored her for the moment and dug around in his pajama bottoms for his own mobile, soon finding it in one of the pockets.  He thumbed through his texts until he reached Lestrade’s name, hovering over the conversation with momentary uncertainty.  Huffing out a determined breath, he brought up the messages and started a new one.
“Lipstick?” John asked as he watched Sherlock clean it. He nodded before folding up the wipe and placing both it and the wrapped knife in his coat pocket.
Letting out a deep breath, Sherlock nodded and made to step around John.  Before he could go far, John slung an arm around his neck and pulled his face down close, Sherlock’s eyes fluttering shut at the movement.  He followed the edge of one cheekbone with his lips, laying light kisses and the occasional lick to the skin.  John trailed his thumb along Sherlock’s hairline, twirling it around the curl at the base of his neck.  His other thumb came up to Sherlock’s lips, tugging the bottom one down teasingly to separate them and tease out his tongue.  Sherlock followed the movement and flicked it out to taste John, but John pulled away before he could reach.  Chasing after the retreating thumb, Sherlock leaned down towards John’s face and attempted to duck in for a kiss.  John stopped him with a hand to his chest and Sherlock’s eyes opened to blink down at him.
John savoured the few minutes of privacy he had before they’d be forced to go join the audience. He supposed he should have expected Sherlock to wear revealing and arousing clothes due to the context of the case, but nothing could have prepared him for actually seeing it. He hoped Sherlock hadn’t noticed his half hard cock when he first spotted Sherlock’s outfit, but with how form fitting his trousers were, he doubted it. At least he wouldn’t have any problems during their performance later.
“It’s okay, baby, it’s fine.”  John scratched the back of his neck where his hair met his nape reassuringly and Sherlock forced himself not to wince.  “We’ll go to Minerva and let her sort it out, okay?  He’s not going to do anything to you ever again, I promise.”
Sherlock was just finishing changing a wiggling Cecelia and whipped around at John’s entrance.  When he realized who it was, his shoulders relaxed and he returned to his task.  “Good morning, John.  Give me a moment and we’ll be done here.”
“I know!” Cecelia yelled back, her voice muffled through her shut bedroom door.  She yanked it open and bounded down to him, her Peppa Pig backpack bouncing along behind her.  Once she reached the bottom step, she launched herself forward to be caught in Sherlock’s arms with a huff.
“This is great, Niall, thanks. Although I’ve got to wonder what the hell you’re charging for all of this to be able to afford everything.”
John took the box as Sherlock pulled out the wand, this time moving more carefully as he waved it.  The wand seemed to consider cooperating for a moment, the tip lightening for a brief moment in a hint of a Lumos, but seconds later one of the lamps exploded instead.  The three of them ducked out of the way of flying glass and candle wax, Sherlock dropping the wand as though it was a living creature, and Ollivander patted at his sleeve where a bit of flame had caught at it.  John quickly moved to put the wand where it belonged, sliding the box across the countertop with a cautious hand.
Mary had sat in the empty seat next to Sherlock while John and Teddy spoke.  She glanced up from talking with Sherlock when she heard John enter, a giant grin on her face.  It took quite a significant amount of John’s military training to keep his smile from wavering at her response.  “There you are, John.  Who’s this friend of yours, then?  Anyone I know?”
“Not at all.  I found him a rather interesting young man, I admit.  Does he happen to know what you are, if you don’t mind my asking?”
“Oh, of course not,” she said, turning back to face the graves.  Her voice rang thick with painful sarcasm.  “Heaven forbid you take all of the blame.”
In the darkened hallway, Greg hesitated before the closed bedroom door.  Straightening his back, he gave it a single sharp rap with his knuckle and waited for a response.  He could hear John pacing on the other side, but as soon as he knocked John’s footsteps came to a halt.  When he heard no other response, Greg knocked again.  “John, please, give me a chance to explain.  You deserve to know the truth, even if you hate me for it.”
Mrs. Hudson paused before the fireplace in contemplation, teacup balanced in her fingers.  She let out a sound of understanding before bringing the cup to the table.  “Of course, this is the weekend he and Mary were planning a trip down towards Bristol.  He mentioned something about visiting his parents’ graves while they were out there.”
John’s lips twisted in a grin and he pulled Sherlock forward to kiss him forcefully, all finesse given up in favour of shoving his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth as soon as possible.  Sherlock let out a yelp of surprise before melting against John, wrapping his arms around his waist.  John pulled away and ran his fingers across Sherlock’s face, tracing the lines and contours with the soft fabric of his gloves.  “29 January.  I thought you didn’t realise.”
John wondered how the rest of the evening would progress as they pulled up to 221b. Part of him expected Sherlock to disappear immediately into his room and refuse to come back out until they needed to leave tomorrow. Thinking he would be gone by the time he followed him up into the flat, John couldn’t hide his open mouthed surprise when he found Sherlock standing awkwardly in the middle of the living room once he’d finished paying the cabbie.
John sighed and picked up his mug, cradling it without taking a drink.  “She’s the nurse at Hogwarts, has been for years.  I’m surprised she hasn’t retired yet, honestly, although usually anyone working at Hogwarts either does it for life or only stops when they physically can’t keep up with it.  She’s amazingly good, definitely could have become a proper Healer if she’d wanted.  Looks like she might be getting ready to possibly rest for once.  Maybe she wants to give it a try to see if she enjoys it?”
The street was less occupied than the central thoroughfares, so Sherlock steered the bike straight down the centre lane and increased their speed marginally.  Seemingly automatically, Sherlock hunched forward toward the handlebars, lifting his arse to display it conveniently for John.  The erection that had half-heartedly been growing since he first saw Sherlock in his riding gear furthered its interest at the promising sight.  Before John actively made the decision to do so, he raised himself enough so that his erection slotted into the curve of Sherlock’s bum.  The bike shot forward as Sherlock jolted at the movement, nearly knocking John off.  John dug his grip harder into Sherlock’s hips to keep them close and pulled Sherlock back into his seat and nearly into John’s lap in retaliation.
Charming and caring to a fault, with a smile that made Sherlock’s stomach flip in a way that both alarmed and fascinated him, John instantly welcomed him in. No matter how much he reprimanded himself for caving so easily, Sherlock couldn’t find it in him to purposefully push him away. Even letting John babble into the silence without ever responding did nothing; if anything, it encouraged John to try harder to get him to open up. Finally Sherlock couldn’t help himself, and easier than he ever would have expected, he felt himself falling fast and hard for John. It was the first time someone seemed to genuinely enjoy spending time with him, laughing at his comments and encouraging him out of his mind when he grew too focused on his thoughts. John was his first real friend, however, and he hated the idea of screwing it up with feelings, of all things.
“Alright, kid, what are you thinking?  A bike?  Dolls?  Puzzles?”  He rested his arm across the back of her chair, leaning in close.  Jane frowned and stared down at the page with furrowed brows and a look of fierce concentration.
Sherlock turned his head so he could gaze thoughtfully off into the distance.  His eyes automatically fell on Cecelia, laying on her stomach across the small rug they placed in her play area, making her way steadily through a workbook.  “Perhaps.  I somehow suspect otherwise, however.  Doyle doesn’t strike me as someone to leave a matter unfinished.  I don’t believe his plan here is done.”
Sherlock stiffened in John’s grasp.  “Ah.  Good night, John.”
“So what are we doing tonight? With the suspects, I mean,” he rushed to reassure when Sherlock turned to him with a scowl. His face smoothed out as he considered.
“Which is why this needs to be a choice we make together.”  John studied him for a moment before standing, pulling Sherlock along with him.  “Come on, let’s move to the sofa.  I want to hold you.”
“Yeah, thanks.  We’ll let you know about the party, okay?”
“I didn’t want to be a bother.”  He buried his face back in John’s shoulder and shook his head in frustration.  “It’s stupid, it’s not as though I’m some child who demands constant attention, I can look after myself perfectly fine for God’s sake, but it just…I couldn’t help but think the only reason why you’ve stayed so long is because I’ve forced everything to be centred around me and now that that’s no longer a factor, the truth had come out.”
Greg shot a cocky grin over his shoulder as he started yanking on his warmest clothes.  “You’re just upset I don’t let you get any of this.”  He made it a point to waggle his bum in John’s direction when he bent to tie up his boots.  John rolled his eyes and finally pushed himself out of bed.
Climbing over Sherlock so that they were sitting side by side, their thighs brushing together, John took up Sherlock’s hand and rubbed his palm.  “The entire purpose of talking is to make sure it doesn’t go wrong, you know.  I didn’t mean for it to sound like a bad thing, just that I was worried and I wanted us to…I dunno, talk about what’s going on for once?  We’ve never been known for having very good luck with communication, but if we don’t try to fix it now, it’ll only get worse the longer we wait.”  He glanced off into the distance and gave Sherlock’s hand a squeeze.  “Believe me, I’ve got experience enough to know that.”
Sherlock shot him a tiny smile as their attention was brought abruptly back to their audience by an employee directing everyone back downstairs. Wiping his hands on his already ruined trousers, John wobbled to his feet and reached out to help Sherlock to his. As much of a state John was in, with his messy bottom half and shirt gaping open, Sherlock looked like a disheveled disaster. His limp cock still hung from his opened trousers, the band most likely uncomfortable and chaffing at the delicate skin of his still hidden balls. He at least still had his shirt on, albeit untucked and with his waistcoat nearly ripped in half with a least one button gone. His cravat dangled open around his neck, nearly falling off one shoulder, and his hair stood up in nearly every direction. John spared a brief moment wondering how they’d manage to get a cab to take them home later if they were in this state before pulling Sherlock, his expression caught in dazed confusion, back to the meeting room.
, my Cecelia.”
“George has a twin?”
Dumbledore chuckled and shook his head.  “Yes, that would explain it.  Winston’s career as a delivery owl was cut short by a head injury during his travels.  We thought he would be able to continue once he was healed, but his behavior became erratic and unreliable.  I was under the impression no student letters were delivered by him?”
ase, Sherlock, say you’ll come with me for Halloween!  It’ll be fun!”
“Mycroft?” James asked with a frown.  “Do you mean Sherlock’s brother?”
“Okay, that’s enough,” John cut in, glaring at Sherlock before turning a smile on Scorpius.  “It’s a pleasure to finally meet you, Scorpius.”
“Ready?” John asked, rubbing his thumbs lightly over the backs of Sherlock’s hands. Sherlock squeezed his fingers in reply.
“Bisexual, yes.  Doesn’t tend to come up very often because it’s always felt like a bit of a taboo word when I was a kid, particularly when I was in the Muggle world.  It was like you weren’t gay enough for one community but not straight enough for the other, you know?  It got better once I got to Hogwarts, but there were still mutterings the first time Matthias and I walked into the Great Hall hand in hand.  He was a Ravenclaw and a bit of a dick now that I think about it – kind of reminds me of you without the charm and caring about others, and not nearly as smart.”
“Anything mechanical is acceptable,” Sherlock said as he fiddled with his trousers, shifting them down just enough to show a hint of his hipbones and the hair leading to his groin. Both John and Niall forced their eyes off of him, Niall shooting John an apologetic smile. With a bit more haste than usual, he headed off for the public dressing room and left them alone. John fastened the dildo back in place and managed to shove his hands into his back pockets to keep them from fidgeting.
Sherlock nodded, wondering how much he could ask Molly to reveal rather than waiting for John to be ready to share it himself.  His curiosity soon got the better of him and he leaned his hands back against the table.  “What was he like back then?  What made him decide to leave?”
Lifting his head from Cecelia’s, John turned back to face McGonagall fully.  “I’ll take care of it.  He should know about our case anyway, particularly if only our authorities are involved.”  He shifted Cecelia to one arm in order to extend his hand to McGonagall.  “It’s been a pleasure to see you again, Professor, even with the topics we had to discuss.”
"I suppose you could say that.  Most of the time I can ignore it, but when it seems to be right – “
, now!”
(See the end of the chapter for
He made to stand to go get the pain potion, but Sherlock latched onto his sleeve before he could get very far.  When John glanced down at him, his eyes were wide and silently begged for him to stay.  Unable to say no to Sherlock at his best, John tossed his wand onto the coffee table and settled into Sherlock’s waiting arms.  They sat entwined together for a long time, Sherlock still shirtless and cuddled in close to John’s chest.
“Now’s not the time,” Mycroft said with the wave of his hand.  “Since the incident occurring at Baker Street this afternoon related to both a wizard and Muggle, it is my responsibility to see to it that the Muggle in particular is protected until the suspect is apprehended.  I assume, John, you can be counted on to act as Sherlock’s protection, as always.”
Half curious as to what it might be for and half uncertain of what he might find, he pulled out his laptop and searched through a few phrases.  When he couldn’t find the right combination of words to get what he wanted, he tossed the key ring into his side table to be forgotten.
To ensure that this,
“Sherlock?  What the fuck…”  Sherlock could have laughed in relief when he heard John’s voice.  Within seconds, the presence at his back vanished and Sherlock stumbled a bit to catch his balance at the sudden change.  He spun to lean back against the stone and spotted Doyle sitting on the floor, his wand in John’s hand and both it and John’s pointed at his face.  He glared up at John and shoved one of the wands out of his face.  In response, John growled, “Stupefy!” and he crumbled fully to the ground.
To John’s surprise, it took Sherlock nearly a week to realise the helmet was missing.  John sat in his chair, back to the hallway, when he heard Sherlock shuffling around.  The noises gradually grew louder and more discordant as he dug deeper into the cupboard.  When they abruptly stopped, John could feel Sherlock staring across the kitchen at him.
Sherlock followed him into the sitting room and stopped suddenly at the figure standing there.  Hands in his pockets, one trailing a lead to Thor at his feet, and eyes scanning the room, James Sholto waited for them while rocking back and forth on his toes.  He nodded at Sherlock when he spotted him, the barest hint of a smile on his face.
Finally the exhibit came to an end for the evening, and John led the two of them back to their dressing room. The key was still in his pocket as it had been all night, digging harshly into his hip in the too small pocket of his trousers. He eventually jiggled them out and let the both of them in. As soon as they entered, they both saw the folded paper on the table. After a brief glance at each other, Sherlock strolled forward to pick it up while John shimmied out of his outfit and into his proper clothes.
“So not a virgin, then?” John interrupted and Sherlock shot him a withering look.
Sherlock’s eyes darted back up to John’s and he broke out in a grin to match John’s. “I suppose I’m amendable.”
“Right.  Unfortunately, leaving Mrs. H and Baker Street would be a guarantee, at least for me.  Some of the professors Apparate home once classes finish each day, but as the Healer for the school, I would be required to remain on hand almost constantly in case of an emergency.  We certainly could visit, and obviously once the year is up we would come back, but for the actual school year, we’d be living at Hogwarts.  That bit we wouldn’t be able to compromise.  But the work…at least for you, I think we could figure it out.”
"What if I did?" Sherlock asked, a slight smirk on his face. When all John did was blink up at him in reply, Sherlock reached into the breast pocket of his coat and pulled out a long, sleek wand.
The cab ride home was filled with awkward silence. Sitting only pulled the fabric around John’s groin tighter, combining discomfort with the constant reminder of what they did earlier. He wished he’d thought to watch Sherlock’s face when he came, but he suspected it would have shot him off even faster. Besides, John thought giddily, he would have other opportunities. If nothing else, he knew from his responses that Sherlock enjoyed himself during it, although he wished he could have wiped the expression of vulnerability he had afterwards off his face.
“Oh baby, no.”  John stroked his cheeks, convincing Sherlock to open his eyes.  “You’re feeling badly about being human and you shouldn’t.  Words are the worst sort of weapon, and you’re allowed to be bothered by them just as much as the rest of us.”  His expression darkened.  “But whatever he says to you, he shouldn’t be allowed to make you hurt like this.  I’ll pound his smug little face in if he tries it again, just tell me the next time and it’s done.”
“Shit, sorry, I forgot!”  John grabbed Sherlock just before he headed for the floor, rubbing comforting circles into the side of his neck.  “It’s just a minor healing charm, Sherlock, relax.  It’s supposed to feel like that; it means the magic’s working.”
“Are you laughing at my glittery cock?” he demanded, causing Sherlock’s laughter to double.  John rolled over to climb on top of him, peppering kisses along his shoulders.  “You’re lucky I love you, you arse.”
She shrugged a slim shoulder and turned to properly watch Sherlock and his crowd of onlookers. “He is very responsive, I must admit, and a joy to look at. But it’s very clear that he is accounted for, and I suspect that you aren’t much for sharing.”
“No problem.”  John’s eyes narrowed as he looked Sherlock up and down and he spoke before he thought better of it.  “I don’t know how much longer you’re stuck here, but Jane and I were planning on going out for hot chocolate once her letter’s finished.  Maybe you’d be interested?”
“So we’ve got at least one Death Eater loose again in London taking down Muggles like they did almost twenty years before.”  John sighed, rubbing roughly at his face.  “Bloody brilliant.”
Sherlock abruptly jumped to his feet, offering John a hand.  “Come.  Let’s go collect your daughter.”
“I’d clean all that up pretty soon,” John said as he sat at the other chair.  “Molly’s most likely on her way over now and we really can’t afford to have a Muggle seeing all of this.”
“That’s…Jesus, Sherlock.”
“It was written before the show,” Sherlock said, reading through it a second time. “I suspected as much from what happened at previous shows, but this proves it. Ian told me that our names and a single photograph each are shown to the customers prior to their ticket confirmation to help them decide whether they’d like to participate that week or not. It seems our culprit found the both of us acceptable and decided to wax poetic about their own assumptions of us as a special welcome.”
