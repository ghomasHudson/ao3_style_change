“John just showed me. Please remind the press that any harassment or publication of Willa is expressly forbidden.” Sherlock instructed him.
“You wanted to fuck me then.” Sherlock whispered, a touch of disbelief in his voice. He dipped his head back into John’s neck.
John nodded.
Sherlock was awkwardly trying to avoid shaking the man’s hand (at least he’d noticed) when John’s phone began ringing. His heart did a funny thing where it simultaneously rose in his throat, fluttering like a panicked bird, and sank into his stomach like a stone. He tried to ignore the feeling as he switched the carrier in his hands and went fumbling into his pocket to get it.
John didn’t bother to ask why, they both knew.
After Sherlock had learned how to braid her hair they’d discussed different types she thought he should learn. Her favorite was a braided crown. He hadn’t attempted it yet but knew roughly how it worked.
This is quiet literally the third version of this chapter. I don't know WHY it was so hard. This one managed to flow nicely once I got it started.
“Sir,” the voice bravely interrupted him, “it’s a little girl.”
“Go hang it up then.” John urged as he was trying to untangle the beaded garland.
Willa did, sinking further back into Sherlock’s chair. Once John was certain her eyes were properly shut he came into the room.
“I expected as much.” Sherlock agreed.
John was confused but said nothing.
She crossed her arms over her chest and shook her head. “No, daddy tells the best stories.”
He sent to John as she came back out. He settled her into John’s side of the bed and became concerned enough to get the children’s pain reliever when she turned down watching movies on the laptop.
When Sherlock threw open the door with excessive flair John understood.
“Willa.” He said trying not to sound impatient. “Why did you decide on the tea cup in the first place?”
He made it until 9:30 before standing again. John watched on, amused.
She was dead immediately. He was a terrible person, evil probably, but he’d been efficient and precise. She hadn’t felt a thing besides fear. As he lowered her onto the ground he’d felt compelled to correct the awkward angle of her head, not that anyone would know once he’d finished with the rest of his task.
“Take off your dress.” Janine told her.
“I assume you know what’s going on.” Sherlock said as he glared at the cabbie in the rearview mirror, silently urging him to go faster.
The shops were packed as expected and Sherlock immediately regretted the hasty promise he’d made to calm her down. Judging by the way she crowded against him and grabbed for his hand Willa was a little overwhelmed as well. Within two minutes four people had bumped into Willa while pressing past them. Sherlock growled at each one until realizing no one could see her despite the outrageous color of her coat. Leaning down and scooping her up he carried her between the shops.
“How’s your head?” He asked her as they went into the kitchen.
Sherlock went to Willa and knelt in front of her. Gently he placed the kitten into her lap. “Alright open your eyes.”
Sherlock stood abruptly. “I think that’ll be all Mr. Wolfe.”
She couldn’t call out for Daddy or Papa but she could still wiggle her toes. She managed to open her eyes just enough to see her right sandal land quietly on the rug behind them.
“You asked me to help,” she reminded.
John glanced at the other man in surprise.
“Out!” Sherlock yelled back, even though they were already near the door.
Sunday morning Sherlock decided to take Willa out for a walk while John settled. He’d taken the news of Wolanski’s death well enough at first but he’d been short with everyone on Saturday.
Willa was watching them with wide eyes and Sherlock pet her hair trying to reassure her.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Why not?”
“You didn’t check into the hotel.”
“No. I was reminding you of the option other than letting me go out on a simple meeting without you.” Sherlock said.
Willa was looking up at him anxiously.
Sherlock nodded and then tossed the menu at him. “Hungry?”
“Pull her phone records, see if this number has ever been in contact with her before,” Mycroft ordered as he shoved the paper back towards her.
Neither man said anything further for nearly an hour.
As the time drew near to get Willa from school John went back into the bedroom. Sherlock had moved onto another book.
Mycroft stepped out onto the side walk and John was about to great him but the look on the older man’s face gave him pause.
From the sofa Mycroft made a sound, both John and Sherlock turned their heads to look at him. “I agree,” he conceded, “we’ve been running him through facial recognition software, starting with the American’s database given what Harriet had said.”
John groaned. “Alright, another shot quick before we leave? For warmth.”
“Yes?” Mycroft asked, very very patiently.
Mycroft did sigh this time. “I was only made aware of Miss Adler’s miraculous survive about three years ago,” he informed the other man.
John nodded. “Yeah, but death is kind of… I don’t know, abstract. To exist one moment and then not, that’s difficult to grasp.”
Instead Sherlock did a very un-him thing and clung to the hope, however small, that the body lying in the morgue wasn’t Willa Louise Watson. That it wasn’t a little girl who had, less than twenty-four hours ago, happily told anyone who would listen that he was going to be her Papa. He allowed himself this irrational hope because without it he knew he’d be no better off than John was.
She shook her head.
“Maybe.” Was all he said before leaving, not caring if John was following this time or not.
“How was she?” John asked from the doorway.
“Can you keep a secret until Saturday?” John asked Willa without waiting for confirmation from Mycroft. He carefully deleted the messages just in case Sherlock decided to steal his phone.
Greg took that opportunity to appear next to them. “Yeah, about this. It was his idea.”
Mycroft suggested a private tutor once John had refused to pull Willa from her current class. When John had protested about funds Mycroft reminded him of the magically appearing money.
“Will it work?” Cole had asked as he watched from the other room, Janine was still working the dye through the ruins of Willa’s hair.
“We’re putting the tree up this evening if you want to avoid the whole mess.” John offered as he shut his computer.
Also I was setting it up to be a bike accident but I just could NOT do that to Sherlock since it would have happened at home. So she did exactly what one of my children did and knocked herself silly on the playground. So this is medically accurate in terms of what happened with that which might not apply elsewhere in the world. *shrug*
Only once Sherlock’s brain had begun to function again did he recognize the significance of the date. He waited until they move upstairs to let John know he knew.
~~~~~~
John heard Sherlock leave the bedroom after him and the door of the bathroom opened. Upon reaching Willa he discovered the source of her frustration. It was a worksheet full of clocks.
Harry frowned at the message.
Willa began eating her breakfast then.
Molly coughed, her eyes flickering up to Sherlock before glancing away. “That’s something to ask your daddy.”
Sherlock snorted.
Sherlock had been expecting John to lead him to the sofa or their chairs, to sit him down and lay out whatever this secret was. He didn’t. Instead John smiled softly and turned away, leaving Sherlock standing dazed in the kitchen.
They were only going out to celebrate Harry’s birthday, a gun seemed excessive unless John was keeping something from him. It wasn’t the first time that thought had crossed his mind.
John let out a shaky breath before dropping his head forward. They were standing close enough that it came to rest on Sherlock’s chest.
“Maybe later but not now.” He compromised and he felt Sherlock nod against him.
Erik sighed and looked up at the florescent light fixed to the ceiling above him, all of the fight drained from his body. “What’s the point? I didn’t kill him but everyone swears I did. What’s the point?”
That wasn’t what John was getting at, though he supposed it was a valid concern. The idea of Mary coming back into their lives was possibly one of John’s greatest nightmares.
Sherlock looked offended at her tone.
“I want to take police cases again too.” Sherlock continued.
“Have the police been in?” John asked and he came over and began inspecting the wound on her head.
John whirled around his face written over with rage. “She was
“Yeah, because our bodies make us sick before we can smoke more but with that e-cigarette sshit it’s like pure nicotine.” John concluded.
“So you saved me that night and about a thousand times since.” John whispered softly before pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s hair.
“I’m just going to…” Sherlock trailed off as he started climbing the stairs.
“I-I don’t understand.” Sherlock finally admitted wincing minutely at the raw emotion in his voice. He tried to step away again but John’s fingers tightened around his arms.
“Kidnapped? Shot?” John asked and he stood, clearly agitated.
“Neurology will do an exam but you know it’s the only option in terms of pain management.” Doctor Treyford said and then he looked over at Sherlock and quickly added. “Of course you and your partner can be with her the entire time.”
“Ten years ago if someone had said Sherlock Holmes would one day willingly braid my daughters hair I would have asked them what drugs they’d taken.” John announced as he peered into the bathroom after her.
John went and sat in his chair to watch. Sherlock hesitated by in doorway before sitting on the arm of John’s chair, his own chair was too close to the action and facing entirely the wrong way. John seemed surprised for a moment but then relaxed back again.
He was approached upon returning to Afghanistan by men who wore very expensive suits and looked like they’d never even touched a gun, let alone fired one. They were pulling together a team, they told him. A small handpicked group of men from the various armies to be commanded by Colonel Sebastian Moran. They didn’t have to say anything more to convince Cole, as soon as he’d heard about Colonel Moran he was in all the way. Moran was a legendary sniper who was rumored to have never missed a single shot, even while in training.
John grinned at the text and Sherlock’s teasing, at least he was working under the assumption it was a tease.
John leaned back on the door, takin in the room with interest, and realized the door was unusually heavy. A fire door. Upon further inspection there was a sprinkler system embedded in the ceiling.
Hahaha in my outline I had originally planned on putting the Christmas dinner in this chapter. I'm an absolute failure at conciseness.
Sherlock was watching them with an unreadable face.
Willa didn’t want to drink, she didn’t know who this woman was, but her mouth was so dry and her head hurt. The woman didn’t seem bad, she was talking soft and was trying to make Willa feel better. Her hands were even gentle as she helped Willa sit up so she could drink properly.
It was several minutes before John spoke again. “Do you have a place to stay? I mean I’ve taken your old room but-”
Both Sherlock and Willa looked at John.
He felt more relaxed for the rest of the evening. John kept grinning and reaching over to squeeze his hand every few minutes.
Sherlock smiled into his neck.
It was nearly three in the morning and Harry couldn't sleep. Hadn't been able to get even some much as twenty minutes with her eyes shut.
“I’m Sherlock.” He said and shook her small hand briefly.
“Alright you, go change. You’re having something healthy for snack.” John warned Willa as he walked into the living room waving his hands at her.
John froze. “That’s terrible.”
Willa looked over it with wide eyes before she looked up at Sherlock. “Can you play for us? Daddy says you used to play all the time.”
After everyone greeted each other, Harry and Sherlock remaining cordial but icy as ever, they went inside.
John laughed to himself when he reached downstairs and found the door to the hall door to the living room had been shut and the sliding doors from the kitchen had been pulled. Willa was already down the short hall to the bedroom. John was about to call out for her to knock but she’d already pushed open the door.
“No.” John held out his hand to stop him from coming any closer.
“You’ve asked us to alert you to anything suspicious, sir,” Meyer told him sounding nearly as annoyed. “We’ve gotten a call from the fire brigade about a suspicious fire they put out in Peckham this morning.”
It was only eleven when John stood in the doorway to the kitchen, shifting his weight between feet. “I have work in the morning.” He explained. “I’m not kicking you out Sherlock but I need to get to bed.”
Mrs. Hudson reached forward and yanked John to her, she was surprisingly strong given her age, folding him into a hug. “Oh John, it’ll be alright. She’s a bright girl and I’m sure half the country is already looking for her.” She reassured him and rubbed a circle into his back.
Sherlock heard the crying several feet from the door and he immediately passed the nurse now knowing where he was going.
John struggled to stand until Sherlock, whose body finally caught up to where his brain was, reached down and pulled him up by his other elbow.
John was secretly pleased. He didn’t mind Sherlock and Willa having little secrets like this, it only proved how well they were getting on.
Sherlock’s arms wrapped around his back pinning him into the kiss. “Make up for it then.” He said when he finally loosened his grip a little. John noticed his right hand had begun tracing the ancient scar on his shoulder.
Inside the box was a brass cylinder about 15 centimeters long. It took him a moment to realize what he was looking at. Once he did Sherlock grinned and pulled it out. It was a spyglass telescope that when extended went to about 35 centimeters. Looking through the lens Sherlock could tell it was fully functional. There was an inscription on the outer tube.
“I will have agents through the door in under a minute. I assure you John, I will keep you safe. My brother would never forgive me if he went into exile for you just to have you die under my watch.” Mycroft told him.
She wasn’t discouraged. “Aunt Molly is coming over tomorrow!” Willa told him happily.
Greg raised an eyebrow at that, though he couldn't help but smile a little at Mycroft's perhaps excessive use of the title husband.
“We’ll have to tell Molly,” John told someone, he was tired.
Lestrade nodded and scribbled a note on a piece of paper before handing it to Sherlock. “DI Thomas, she’s young but good. I’ll call ahead and warn her you’re coming.”
“No I think this is exactly where I’m supposed to be.” A man’s voice answered. Willa frowned because this was a woman’s restroom.
Willa looked thoughtful. “Evaporating water.”
If I don't update tomorrow before 8:30 EST I doubt I will be updating before Tuesday. I will no doubt need time to process.
Sherlock sighed, loudly, but Rosie chose that moment to begin wiggling in her father’s arms. John let her down and they wandered lazily after her as she explored the park. She was still unsteady on her feet and every little slope or change in terrain led to her falling onto her bottom.
“Greg,” the nasty things she wanted to say to him died in her throat.
“So that being said,” Mycroft now directed his speech to the three children who could pay attention. “We hope you enjoy.”
John’s grin broke into a full smile. “I’d like that.”
He carried her up the stairs and she didn’t protest, instead just leaned into Sherlock.
“Come have a seat, I’ll make you tea while we wait.” Mrs. Hudson ordered from the kitchen and John obeyed.
John was about to ask what he was apologizing for when Addison and Willa walked into the room, heads bent together. Addison was holding a mobile phone which seemed to be the point of focus. He immediately understood what the apology had been about.
Sherlock winced at how fast John straightened to look at the doctor standing in the doorway behind them. Provoking John like that while he wasn’t in a good mood was not a great idea, of course the doctor honestly didn’t know that.
“At the time, he was my friend.” Sherlock agreed drawing John back to now. “You were right when you said you were filling in for it but I think you should know that you do a much better job at being my friend.”
a good idea.” She announced walking into the room.
John felt just a bit guilty beneath all the layers of rage and despair so he drew away from the others. “Fine,” was all me managed before stalking down the hall towards Harry’s room.
Lestrade got the hint first and started moving, he sat up and patted Mycroft’s knee. “Let’s go find some coffee,” he said before standing. Then, in a move that was either exceptionally brave or foolish, he walked around and stood in front of John. “I’m going to call my people and see if there’s anything new. I’ll let you know either way.”
“I’ll call, John,” She continued sounding more sure of herself, “that way they won’t realize you’ve known for a couple hours already.”
Sherlock shook his head, his eyes not meeting John’s.
Sherlock didn’t feel that way but he also didn’t want to argue over whether it was anyone’s fault. “We’ll find another lead.” He promised instead.
“I can keep secrets too, Sherlock.” John said softly, his hands stilling.
“It looks like it.” John agreed softly. “How is she?”
“She’s named all of her dolls.” Sherlock answered.
John slumped into his chair. “God damnit. There’s our only lead gone.” He dropped his head into his free hand.
Sherlock cast one last glare at John, who wasn’t facing him to notice, before looking at Willa and nodding. “Of course.” It was entirely possible that as long as she prefaced a question with ‘papa’ he would have great difficulty telling her no. He was worried she would catch on to that.
In the morning Willa played on the floor with her Legos until Sherlock could no longer stand the site of the nest that had become her hair. She then sat on the floor between his feet watching cartoons while he went at it with a brush. For lunch they went down to Speedy’s and let her have anything she wanted. In the afternoon he taught her how to start a fire with a battery and a gum wrapper, then proceeded to make her swear not to tell John. Willa was the one to suggest making dinner which was why John walked in the door to the two of them making pizza dough with half the kitchen covered in flour.
Greg got to the gift first and carefully carried it back down the stairs while Mycroft followed with his phone, which had appeared for the first time since he’d gotten to Baker Street, to his ear nearly shouting at whoever was on the other end.
Instead he swept low into a bow and everyone applauded lively. When he straightened, Willa lunged off the couch at his legs.
Harry shook her head. “Seriously? And you’re with him?” She jabbed her finger at Sherlock.
Sherlock was overwhelmed being back inside their flat and his mind was racing trying to take in everything at once. So when John urged his daughter to introduce herself Sherlock was thankful for the distraction. She gave him one point to focus on and that focus calmed his racing mind.
Sherlock realized, as he was both holding John up and waiting for Molly to return, that Mycroft had been unusually silent. In fact he had even seen the infamous mobile make an appearance. He just stood, seemingly rooted to the wall, and stared at his shoes.
John shook his head. “No, no you’re fine.” He insisted and finally dropped his hand.
The flat was quiet when he got home. John found them in the bedroom, both of them asleep.
John managed to wrestle the fabric off himself, less than gracefully. “What? Why?
“Well yeah.” John said wondering if Sherlock had been wrong, if Harry had been drinking earlier. “He’s fantastic with her and it’s actually really nice to have a second parent. I get why it’s usually done in pairs now.”
It was successful because as Sherlock was suffering John’s terrible humor he pressed a single finger inside. Sherlock gasped softly. “That was terrible.”
“Do not scorn her, Sherlock, that would be the quickest way to lose any relationship you have or hope to have with John.” Mycroft continued.
John spent the next two hours alternating between reading and watching them sleep.
Sherlock watched the buildings silently for a few more minutes before it struck him they weren’t going the right way. “Where are we going?”
“It’s mine.” John said after a few more moments, his face still effectively buried in Sherlock’s shirt.
Once the tree was more or less upright Willa dove for the large box they kept their special ornaments in. Each year they went to the store, picked out new special ones and then every year since she was in nursery John would save one or two of the handmade ornaments. Every year less and less generic ornaments made it on to the tree and every year it made John happy to see that.
Sherlock coming back had made Harry sick with worry but she’d stamped it down after seeing how happy it made John. Six years was a long time, surely Sherlock would have changed. Except he hadn’t, he was still a psychopath except now he’d been dragging her niece around in it as well as her brother. She’d hoped John would have more sense than to allow Sherlock this close to Willa but as always John was blinded where Sherlock was concerned.
Aaaand we're back.
Adoption would truly simplify this process.
Sherlock nodded, pleased that John was catching up, “exactly and when we find out who it was we’ll be able to determine if it’s connected.”
If it wasn’t for the fact that Mycroft knew every facet of his brother’s voice he would have hung up the phone instantly declaring it an imposter. Sherlock sounded lost and young again, and those two words were enough to convince Mycroft that something very very wrong had happened.
. Is there anything special you want?”
Willa had to bit down on the desire to protest that there’d been nothing wrong with the hair her hair had been before. She’d like her hair like that, everyone always talked about how pretty it was, but more importantly, that was how Daddy and Papa knew she looked.
“No, she’s a grievance councillor, runs meeting here. Quite useful actually, I needed to visit the science department here about some hands.” She then got out of the car and walked into the main building. Lestrade, Donavon and Anderson just sat in the car. Donovan was the first one to speak.
“How? Well by looking at your skin tone, facial features, hair, clothing, the way you hold yourself and the few items you have unpacked, I was able to deduce that you are from Europe, southern Europe to be precise, in particular Italy or Malta, hence me asking you which country.” Keira just stared at the women, mouth open wide for a few moments before snapping it shut.
“I’m sorry what?” Keira asked, still confused over the fact she now had a flat mate. The woman rolled her eyes.
“Lestrade- Oh are you off somewhere?” He asked. Before Lestrade could reply, Elizabeth spoke up.
The three of them sat there for a good hour chatting about things until there was a knock at the door and in walked Donovan and Anderson.
“Charles Magnussen is dead, I killed him.” Said the man sitting down. He looked slightly ill. Elizabeth grinned widely and went to sit down next to him.
“Yes, I’ll give it to John to bring down.” She then went into her flat to get some milk.
“Oh please can you at least come up with some better names? If I had a pound for every time I was called a ‘freak’ I would be able to afford my own island.” Elizabeth then gave the gun to one of the Forensic officers before turning to Lestrade. “Well, that was easier than I thought.” She said clapping her hands together. Lestrade along with the other people in the room just stared at her. “What? I’ve lived in America for over two decades, I deal with guns on regular basis, hell I’ve been shot 6-no 7 times…” She narrowed her eyes and put her hands together under her chin in thought. “It’s either 6 or 7 I can’t remember precisely, I may have not been in my right mind when I got shot one time.” Elizabeth shook her head. “But that doesn’t matter.” She smiled.
“I do apologise for the intrusion, it seems your parents neglected to tell you it was a flat share. Although I suppose you jumped at the chance to move out. Having parents who are the head of the Italian Mafia can’t be as thrilling as it sounds I suppose.” She said casually. Keira spun round so fast she almost fell.
“I should mention that the Irish mafia owe me from stopping the head going to jail for something they never did, so I believe that’s why they saved me. Paying back the favour.” Elizabeth sighed again. Then John spoke up.
“Who the hell is this?” Elizabeth rolled her eyes.
“Yeah, we were buddies.” He said turning back to the table and taking a sip of his tea. Lestrade then spoke again.
Elizabeth thought.
“Wha- Hey Liz! What are you doing?!” Keira chased up after her and found herself standing next to Elizabeth in the doorway of the plane. Inside the main part of the plane were 4 other people, 3 men and a woman that Keira vaguely recognised. She looked at the shortest of the 3 men.
She thought before Elizabeth poked her head around the door. “Well?” She rose an eyebrow. Keira stood there and looked at the mad woman. After a couple of moments she grabbed her gun from her back, made sure it was loaded before putting it back in it’s place and grabbing her coat and keys.
“Italy or Malta?” She repeated, frowning. Keira opened her mouth to answer, but no words came out. The woman raised an eyebrow. “Well?” Keira shook her head and answered.
“White, 2 sugars.” Elizabeth said absent-mindedly. After a moment she poke again. “Please.” John gave her a small half smile and went into the kitchen to make the tea. While he was doing this, Elizabeth continued to talk at him.
“16, don’t see why that matters though. I’ve looked at my syllabus for the year and all I can hope is that the professors actually know what they are talking about otherwise I will be as bored as hell seeing as I know everything already.” Keira just stood there, mouth open, Elizabeth continued. “However, back to the matter in hand, I have currently been texting Lieutenant Jackson of NYPD and he has finally agreed that my assistance is greatly needed on the case they are currently working on.” Elizabeth grinned. “Serial killer, always fun those, has been killing people and butchering their bodies. This one is the 5
“Okay, why are we at a University? Is she a Uni student?” Elizabeth shook her head and replied while typing on her phone.
“Well, first off, just call me Keira. Neither of us are in the army anymore so let’s use first names like normal friends do. Second, I’ve known Liz for near enough 20 years; you pick up on how to ‘deduce’ things.” Keira made quotation marks when she said ‘deduce’. “I know that umbrella guy is Liz’s older brother, she’s complained enough about him and how ‘his diets never work, I have no idea why he keeps going on them’ so that’s kind of obvious. The one sitting down looking like he needs some sleep is her twin William or Sherlock as he is normally known as, again she talks about him a lot plus I met the guy about 3 years ago, long story. You I know personally and from the wedding invitation I got earlier this year, which I apologise for not being able to attend but I had to go back to Afghanistan for a while, another long story, the female sitting next to you is your wife Mary.” Keira sat back in her chair, smiling smugly while the others in the cabin, bar Elizabeth and Sherlock, stared at her wide eyed.
“Wha…” He starts but Elizabeth chuckles.
“Liz I really think-” John started to talk when Liz put her hand up.
Elizabeth ran through the airport, narrowly dodging the people around her as she played about on her phone. Keira muttered apologies to people as she followed Elizabeth through the crowds.
“Hold on one moment. Who the hell are you and what gives you the right to waltz into my office and tell me how to do my job?!” He shouted. Elizabeth sighed and put her finger and thumb up to the bridge of her nose before replying.
“No, that won’t be necessary.” He said. He looked at his assistant who had finally looked up from her phone and at him with a questioning look on her face. Mycroft gave her a small smile. “It was difficult to put surveillance on Sherlock, Elizabeth is 100 times worst.” He then turned and walked back to the car and his assistant followed.
“He’s worried that it would look like he was using Mycroft to go up the ranks.” Elizabeth put her hands on top of the table and put her head on them. “You realise no one would think that right? If they did, you let me know and I’ll kick their ass.” She said smiling gently. Lestrade looked over at her with a confused look. Elizabeth sighed. “I would do that for you because if it wasn’t for you, I don’t think Will would have gotten off the drugs and would probably have died in some dingy coke house.” Liz gave him a half smile and looked over at John. “And you’re Will’s best friend.” She shrugged lightly. The room was silent until there was some noise coming from Elizabeth’s computer. Elizabeth looks over but stays seated. “Email.” She said.
Elizabeth stood outside Scotland Yard and looked around, carefully avoiding any CCTV cameras she made her way into the building and walked up to the front desk.
“What happened after?” He asked. Elizabeth smiled at him but had a dead look in her eye.
“It’s just Keira mate.” She said smiling slightly. “That being said, if you’re not being flown off to god knows where, it seems as though we need to have a talk.” Keira frowned slightly at the thought of the subject that needed to be discussed. Just then someone’s phone went off. Everyone looked at their phones but it was Elizabeth’s phone that had gone off. She read over the message and grinned before looking up at her brother.
Erm, so it's been a while and I've planned and written a lot for this story. Now I just need to remember to update it :)
“That’s okay Mrs Hudson, see you later.” Mrs Hudson smiled and nodded at the men and went back into her apartment. John and Lestrade headed down to Elizabeth’s apartment through the back door and down some outdoor stairs to the front door of apartment 221C. When they went through the front door the first thing they saw was a huge computer set up. There were 6 different monitors on the wall, all connected up together along with 3 monitors on the desk below them. There were several papers scattered around the room and many filing cabinets. The men heard Elizabeth moving things around further in the apartment and walked through the archway into the rest of the apartment and they were surprised by the size of the room.
“What the fuck?!” She said, not too loudly as to draw attention from the neighbours. She made her way over to the second arm chair and sat down glaring at Elizabeth. “Look, I feel as though I should care about how you knew that but in all honesty I don’t give a damn. All you need to know is that you have to swear on your life never to tell anyone and that subject does not leave this flat. Understood?” Keira narrowed her eyes. Elizabeth glanced up and chuckled before her attention was back on her phone.
“Female? Surely the killer is a male.” Elizabeth sighed and turned to face him.
“What?” She asked. Elizabeth grinned.
“John!” She shouted and clapped her hands together before prancing over to him. “John Watson! I have been wanting to meet you for months.” She grinned and shook John’s hand eagerly. Then she spun round in excitement, allowing her coat to fly out slightly, before peaking again. “Whenever I spoke to Will on the phone, about 85% of the conversation from his side was about you so I have been eager to meet you.” John looked at her and blinked. Elizabeth sighed. “I call Sherlock Will, seeing as legally his first name is William but only I call him that when I’m pissed off with him, otherwise I call him Will.” She smiled. John slowly nodded his head.
“Ah, now Miss Cordell.” Elizabeth said to the woman. “I believe you have a slight obsession with Jack the Ripper, correct?” She cocked her head to the side and the woman nodded slightly, crossing her arms.
“Shall we put surveillance on Dr Holmes?” She asked as Mycroft continued to follow the car with his eyes, until it turned out of sight.
Elizabeth sighed and sat down in the chair across from Lestrade.
“Don’t worry, we can get to know each other later. You still live in 221B don’t you?” Elizabeth glanced over John and before he could reply Elizabeth was speaking again. “Of course you do, Mrs Hudson keeps saying I should go up to say hello and have tea but I’m quite busy you see, I’m not in the UK for no reason, I’m working on a case about illegal organ harvesting, very interesting actually, it’s working on an international scale and I’ve spent the last couple of months working on it and I’m about 10% away from solving it. I mean Interpol have had this case for years and have gotten know where so that’s why I stepped in. Good thing too actually, they were a little bit concerned when I offered because of what went down over here but once I showed them that it was a bunch of bullshit they were more than happy to hand the case over. The problem is Keira is back in Afghanistan at the moment which is obviously concerning but I need to work and keep my mind occupied so if that means I have to take a case in which I have to travel overseas, so be it. Honestly I would have rather taken a cruise ship over here but they were insistent that I fly even though I am not a big fan of very long flights, 2-5 hours I can handle but any more than that, I get a bit restless but what are you going to do?” Elizabeth went on and on and by the time she had finished her small rant, everyone apart from Lestrade, John, and herself had left the room. Elizabeth looked around. “Also I do tend to go on a bit.” She smiled innocently. There was a long silence then John started chuckling.
“I take it we are landing in the UK now then?” She asked, ignoring Keira’s question. Keira chuckled.
“I see you are as good as my sister says then Major Scordato.” Sherlock spoke up, with a slightly rasping voice. Keira rolled her eyes.
“I was down here a few minutes ago and you didn’t object, so I don’t see the problem.” Elizabeth shouted back at her and popped her head round the door of Lestrade’s office. “Are you coming or do I have to find my own way there?” She asked. Anderson’s mouth drops open.
“She’s my wife.” Elizabeth then frowned and looked across the room. John turned to see what she was looking at and saw a photo of Elizabeth, Sherlock and a red haired woman smiling in front of the statue of liberty. “She was sent back to Afghanistan about 3 months ago, CIA business and seeing as she is the director of the CIA, it made sense for her to go.” Elizabeth had a blank look on her face for a moment before she sighed and looked down at her cup. “Don’t know when she’s coming back though…” There was a long silence before John spoke.
“Did she just say something about hands…?” She asked. The men nodded their head. “Right, definitely related to Sherlock.” She muttered as she got out the car. The other 2 followed and walked into the building. They saw Elizabeth animatedly talking to a young man.
When I was writing this, I couldn't think of how to go about the case so it's really basic and not the best, sorry bout that >.
“No, NO! Get the hell off me! I did nothing! You freak! Who the hell do you think you are?!” She is dragged out the room by Donavon and Anderson, who meet the rest of the team outside. Elizabeth sighs and tosses the gun from hand to hand slowly.
“Oh, hello there, welcome to Scotland Yard, is there any way I can assist you?” The woman at the reception desk asked. Elizabeth smiled at the woman.
“Alright then, Lestrade, make sure your team is ready and take Dr Holmes with you. I trust her judgement and I hope you do as well. We can discuss what I wished to talk about when you get back.” He smiled and nodded to Lestrade and then to Elizabeth before departing. Elizabeth just smirks and looks over at Lestrade with a raised eyebrow and a knowing look.
It felt like hours, rather than the couple of minutes it actually was, until there was a knock at his door. Before he could tell the person to come in, the opened the door and strode in like they owned the room. Lestrade opened his mouth to yell at them for entering the room without permission but forgot what he was going to say when he saw who had just come in.
“OF course, I have no desire to speak about family issues, mine or yours.” Elizabeth then froze once more before looking up at Keira once again. Keira rose an eyebrow.
“Have fun in your mind place?” She asked with a glimmer of amusement in her eyes. Elizabeth just scoffed and rolled her eyes.
“Damn it!” Elizabeth muttered to herself and continued to type even quicker. Eventually the sounds and flashes stopped and Elizabeth was reading screens of code. A smile began to grow on her face as she read through it all. “Oh… oh yes… Thank you Sebastian… You just screwed up big time didn’t you…” She continued to mutter and type on her keyboard.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa!” John exclaimed. “What the hell are you talking about?!” He asked Elizabeth wide eyes. She tipped her head back to look at the two men behind her.
“I’m sorry but who did you say you were?” John finally spoke up. Elizabeth sighed and closed her eyes, turning to face John. When she opened her eyes to see who spoke, her eyes widened.
Elizabeth was in a relatively good mood as she strode out of the University building, cooler boxes in hand. Lestrade and John trailed after her slowly. They made it to Lestrade’s police car when they saw a black car parked behind it. Elizabeth frowned.
“Well then, before I go can I ask about the ring on your finger?” Elizabeth sighed and looked over at Mycroft with a bored expression on her face.
“Well that just makes our job much easier Will. So thanks for that.” She looked up at the man holding an umbrella and gave him a fake smile. “And fancy seeing you here Richard, I take it the diet isn’t working?” The man Elizabeth referred to as “Will” snorted and started chuckling. Elizabeth just sat there grinning widely while “Richard” glared at her.
“Interesting…” Elizabeth muttered to herself as the plane finally landed and parked up on the runway. As soon as it stopped, Elizabeth jumped up and grabbed her Belstaff before heading towards the door. Keira sighed and slowly followed her partner.
“Yes, I believe you met during your time out there?” She raised an eyebrow at John and he nodded.
“DI Lestrade? There is someone here to see you… Name? One second.” The woman looked back up at Elizabeth. “What was your name?” She asked politely. Elizabeth pulled out her FBI ID and showed it to the woman.
“Scotland Yard please.” She said smiling at the driver, before looking down at her phone.
“I’ll just come down to your office, see you in a bit.” Elizabeth put the phone down and nodded at the woman who was still sitting in shock. She then quickly turned and walked down the corridor to Lestrade’s office.
“Sir? I have- Sir? Are you alright?” He asked. Anderson walked into the office as there was yelling in the corridor.
“You are the daughter of 2 of the most wanted criminals in Italy, you took your mother’s maiden name as to not be connected with them. They offered you an out and payed towards you getting a degree, scholarships pay for your tuition, they pay your share of the rent. However they had one condition and that was that you must take a weapon with you, a 32 caliber hand gun, passed down through your father’s side of the family. They decided to give it to you not your brother, thought you would need it more than he would. So, an 18-year-old student who owns an illegal fire arm and is studying criminology and law at university.” Elizabeth’s eyes seemed to light up but before Keira could say something, she continued. “Also has a slight temper but excellent judgement and enjoys a good adrenaline rush, this is marvolous!” Elizabeth suddenly got out of her chair and twirled around the living area. “Absolutely fantastic in fact, it would be a great help in my line of work.” She suddenly stopped prancing around and looked straight ahead, hands, palms together, under her chin.
“Okay, as lovely as this conversation is, Liz could you possibly give me some kind of explanation?” Elizabeth looked up at Keira and raised an eyebrow.
“Well I’m glad you both seem to be getting on well. If you need me, I’ll be in my flat on the ground floor.” And with that he left. Keira turned from looking towards the door to one of the arm chairs, which Elizabeth seemed to have claimed as her own. She was messaging someone on her phone so Keira just sighed and went over to close the door. As soon as it was closed, Elizabeth spoke up again.
“Finally, decided to trust me then?” She asked. Lestrade sighed but nodded his head. “Good now I’ll give you the directions in the car.” She got out her phone again and got into the front seat of the car. Lestrade got into the driver’s seat with his two subordinates in the back. “The person you are looking for is a female, late 30’s, obsession with Jack the Ripper-” She is cut off by Anderson.
“Are these police officers seriously that idiotic they cannot see what is right in front of them?” She murmured and she looked for a name. She then came across a statement from a Detective Inspector and grinned. “Perfect.” Elizabeth got up from her computer and went into her room to get changed.  She threw on a white shirt with black trousers and matching suit jacket. As she jogged up the stairs from her room she heard her landlady knocking on the door.
“Shall I put the kettle on?” She asked smiling at the gawping men.

“Around the last year of my Uni course, I met a young man by the name of James ‘Jim’ Moriarty. He seemed nice enough, we went out with each other as friends a few times but Jim wanted to go a little further. I said let’s give it a go but in the end, I just wasn’t attracted to him like that and he said the same so we just remained friends.” Elizabeth chuckled. “Keira was seething with jealousy whenever we went out together but kept quiet, I believe she was quite relieved when I told her we weren’t together like that.” Elizabeth smiled. John walked over with the tea and gave Elizabeth her cup. She nodded her thanks and took a sip before putting the cup down and continued typing.
She thought, showing her own ID and going over to where Elizabeth and a few other officers were standing.
“Dr Elizabeth Holmes, Director of the FBI and an assistant director of Interpol.” The woman froze and Elizabeth could here the DI over the phone.
“Why the hell did we come all this way if Magnussen is already dead?” Keira raised her eyebrow. Elizabeth smirked as she saw their audience look at them strangely. John then spoke up.
“I knew he was lying. I had hacked into his growing network long before then and I knew he didn’t hire any snipers, couldn’t afford to, so I told him he was lying and I wasn’t going anywhere.” She moved her and smiled sadly at the ceiling. “So he shot me off the building.” There was an awkward silence for a few moments before Elizabeth chuckled. “I fell through the roof of an old warehouse which probably saved me from dying but I was bleeding out in the middle of an abandoned warehouse, thinking no one was around, I thought I was dead.” She glanced over at John. “But luck, in a way, was with me. A couple of Irish mobsters came into the building, carrying a body. They saw me and walked over. They recognised me, by this point I believe the whole of New York knew who I was, and decided to take me back to their base, to the doctor who happened to be a disgraced surgeon. They carried me to their truck and then left the body they carried there but before we left they burnt the building.” Elizabeth frowned. “That’s all I can remember from there, next thing I know I’m in one of the guest rooms at the Irish mafia’s home base.” Elizabeth looked at John and chuckled lightly at his expression.
“Right…” He said slowly. Elizabeth smiled.
“Hi, I was wondering if I could speak to a Detective Inspector Lestrade if possible.” The woman blinked in surprise.
“Would you stop gaping like a fish for one moment Graham? I have worked out who your killer is for these serial killings by only looking through some news articles. Honestly did it not occur to you that…” Elizabeth began to pace up and down Lestrade’s office dictating about the recent killings. Lestrade just sat there in shock and after a few minutes snapped out of it and stood up.
“Bloody hell…” Lestrade said looking around. In the far right corner was a kitchen with a black and white colour scheme. It was huge and much more modern than would be expected. In the living area there was a large TV on the wall beside a fake fireplace with a couple of arm chairs in front of it. There is a well-used sofa and several surfaces covered in papers and on the adjacent wall there are papers and bulletins pinned to the walls and pin boards on the walls. There was also a large stereo and bookcase along the same wall. Elizabeth emerges from a small stair case, going further down into the apartment and smiles at the men.
“Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, my name is Dr Elizabeth Holmes, I’m the director of the FBI and an assistant director at Interpol.” She twirled round slowly, showing her ID. “Before you ask, yes I am related to Will- I mean Sherlock, and if anyone says anything about me being a fraud…” Elizabeth gave them a semi-dark look. “I can tell you now that neither my brother nor I are frauds and that is fact. Without, I believe that crime rates in both America and here in London would be extraordinarily high so all I can say is do your research before you start spouting out ignorant comments.” She then turned to the woman in the centre of the room.
“Yes, Will’s my brother, but what he does and what I do are completely separate.” She smiled a small smile. “I’m not in the position I am in for no reason.” Lestrade nodded slowly. Suddenly Elizabeth jumped up from her chair and put her hands together. “Right, now that’s out the way with, let’s go find your killer.” She strode out of Lestrade’s office while he sat back down in his chair. Anderson then knocks on his door.
“Yes thank you Mr Wilson, was there something you needed?” Mr Wilson cleared his throat.
x-x-x-x-x
“Wait, since you were 13?! How old are you now?” She asked.
“Ah, I see well I appreciate your assistance. How far are you in the case?” Elizabeth glanced over at Lestrade before looking back at Pankhurst to reply.
“Everything went to shit.” She closed her eyes and frowned.
“Seriously, are we going now, in 2 days, a week? I’m being nice here.” She said. Lestrade cleared his throat and nodded. Just as he was getting up to follow Elizabeth, the commissioner of Scotland Yard stood in the doorway.
“Right? Shall we head back? I need to get these in the fridge.” And with that she walked out the room. Lestrade and John just looked at each other.
“Liz, slow down for a second will you?!” Keira shouted at her partner, who did not stop running until she got outside. Elizabeth put and arm out. Not seconds later a taxi drove straight up and she got in, leaving the door open for Keira. “Bloody cab magic works here as well I see.” Keira muttered as she got in the cab and closed the door.
“I’m going to make some more tea.” He said getting up. Elizabeth nodded in agreement.
Keira shook herself out of her reverie as she felt the cab stop and Elizabeth bound out of the cab, leaving her to pay the fare. Keira rolled her eyes before paying and ran after Elizabeth who ducked under the tape showing the officer her ID and down to the dead body that was lying on the stage.
“Lestrade, I will tell you this only once,” She looked directly into his eyes. “I hate to repeat myself.” She then smirked. “But fortunately I am in a good mood, so…” She showed him her ID. “My name is Dr Elizabeth Holmes, I’m the director of the FBI and an assistant director of Interpol. I happen to also enjoy helping police officers that are at their wit’s end to solve murder cases such as the one on your desk. As such I am offering my services voluntarily as a…” Elizabeth pursed her lips and smirked. “Consulting detective to give it a name, not only to get this case solved and avoid any other murders but to keep me from being bored out of my god damn mind while I wait for information for the case I am actually here for.” Elizabeth stood in front of Lestrade’s desk, head cocked to the side, smiling sweetly. Lestrade just blinked at her.
“DI Lestrade? I believe he may be free, can I ask what this in reference to?”
“Yes, well-” Suddenly Elizabeth’s computer started blaring noises and flashing. She ran over to her computer and slid into her chair, finger running over her keyboard at a superfast speed. Lestrade and John looked at each other and went over to her computer.
promised me this, now behave.”
“I feel like I’m walking a thin line between asking you to do too much and insulting you by not asking for help. I’m always worried about overstepping my bounds in this with everyone and it’s no different with you.” John explained taking a sip of his drink.
“Hello, Mr. West.” Willa greeted as they reached the door.
Both John and Sherlock looked at him but Greg didn’t explain, instead he brushed by them to catch up with Mycroft.
John gave in of course, there were bigger battles to fight than whether or not it was appropriate to wear sandals every day from June to September.
“No what?” John asked after spitting out the fabric.
John rolled his eyes and wandered into the kitchen. The room is basically the same. A half refrigerator, a small table for eating with two chairs, a sink, a range and a handful of cupboards. John suspected the only reason the range had stayed was due to the kettle sitting atop it.
Sherlock watched him for a moment. “John.”
John stopped on the landing next to Sherlock. “Please don’t antagonize her all night.” He begged.
“It’s lovely.”
Sherlock’s eyes slid closed when he heard the lube bottle click open and he let himself fall back. When John’s slick finger pressed against his holes Sherlock tensed despite his best efforts not to. It had been a long time since Sherlock had allowed anyone to top even though he preferred it. There was a level trust he needed to have in the other person to submit to them like this and he was rarely anywhere long enough to build it.
Sherlock wasn’t ready to dismiss the fire as unrelated though. The extent of the damage was so severe whoever had set it was definitely trying to cover up something. And since there was little actually in the room whatever they’d been trying to hide was something more than a drugs lab. It was still possible that Mary’s cronies had set the fire to cover up physical evidence of Willa having been there, but it was just as likely that someone else was trying to cover up something unrelated.
John smiled and threw away the paper towel. “Because you love her.”
It was odd knowing Sherlock was asleep in the next room just like old times, except it wasn’t old times. Then John would have stayed in the flat, watched a bit of the bad telly Sherlock mocked him about and maybe cleaned up some of the things Sherlock wouldn’t let him throw out when he was awake. He wouldn’t have truly cared if he made noise, Sherlocks lack of sleep was his own choosing then. Now he was contemplating how to keep his active child quiet for a few more hours to give Sherlock the rest he so desperately needed.
~~~~~~
Sherlock tried to do as John instructed but the other man had pulled down Sherlock’s zip and untucked him from his pants.
Her eyelashes were light in color, matching her hair, but they were long and thick fluttering against her cheek. He’d noticed the light freckles on her cheek before but took stock of them again, they’d faded just a bit more since he’d come back to London with the effects of British winters. He wondered if she’d gotten the freckles on holiday, a day out in the sun where they were having so much fun John forgot to be compulsive about the sunscreen. She had mentioned once that John took her to the beach one year.
“What?” John asked momentarily confused.
“Exactly.” He agreed.
to be about John’s secret.
John sighed and opened his hands in capitulation.
“Oh god yes.” John breathed.
Just over 24 hours until S4 for me!
When Sherlock finally moved on John keened at the loss.
They sat quietly for some time, the silence only broken by the sound of John slowly draining his mug. Once he’d finished, John was the one to break the silence. “Mary didn’t know.”
There was no point in him being in there anymore.
“You’re upset they interrupted your time with the mistress.” Sherlock said dryly.
“Sir, this is DS Meyer.”
“Besides, this actually went pretty well, at least until she chucked herself off a jungle gym.” John said. “Which she would have done even if I were home.”
“Alright then.” John agreed and pulled out his phone to text Molly.
Greg turned to go find John and Sherlock in an effort to make sure they were okay and hadn’t somehow managed to raze half of London in the five minutes since they’d disappeared.
“Give me the clip.” John whispered not even turning his head.
Sherlock nodded and held out a hand. John was slowly pulling himself together, Lestrade’s voice having drawn him back from the pit of despair he had been crawling into.
Dinner had been pleasant. It was interesting to watch Willa interact with another child. Addison might have been older but the girls were intellectually on the same page. Willa acted more childish around her, perhaps not feeling the pressure to keep up with adults. They made rude noises, dissolved into giggles and Willa had even pouted over the idea of never getting a mobile.
Sherlock smiled and began.
“Yes,” John bit out before stabbing at the little red button on his screen. Sherlock was looking at him with concern, hand still on John’s arm.
her.” He shouted.
John came home the evening after Sherlock had solved that small mystery with a stack of papers in his hand.
Even though John reached the top floor first, Sherlock was the first to orient himself and went flying into the remains of the bathroom. John followed.
On Friday night, as John grabbed his coat right after dinner, Sherlock looked up at him. “Is everything alright?”
“Alright Willa, where am I going?” John asked his daughter.
Hmm. I'm just gunna say adopt don't shop. All of my animals are rescues but do I honestly think Sherlock would do that? Probably not especially since he was obsessed with the idea of knowing the family health history of Baron.
"Gregory, this is not helpful," Mycroft said even as he leaned back into his touch.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Only hurts a little.” She answered and climbed up onto the table anticipating what John was going to do.
“Hello, lovely, are you alright?” The woman asked and she leaned over so Willa could see her without moving her head.
As they drove John opened his phone and went into his conversations. There were three messages he’d ignored when he turned on his phone, Willa and Harry had only just gone to the bathroom and the messages hadn’t seemed urgent at the time.
Of course, given who her family was Willa was born into a state of danger, but this was different. This was an actual physical danger she was in, not something theoretical or abstract. This was the very first time she stood below the sword and one of the few times in his life that Mycroft truly felt powerless.
“Willa Louise Watson you will be getting no farm animals for your birthday.” John snapped finally harsher than he usually would have, no doubt the headache was fraying on his nerves.
But what had she done to make her feel that way? She hadn’t been faking that she didn’t recognize Janine, she honestly had not known the woman until they’d mentioned her name. Though, she had been extremely quick and relieved to point the finger at Sherlock and try to assign the blame to him.
“It doesn’t mean we won’t be doing Easter lunch with your brother.” He reminded him after a few minutes of comfortable silence.
“She does have a pesky habit of needing fed.” John agreed in a mock solemn voice.
Sherlock hummed against his throat. “I don’t know, you say all kinds of things in bed.” His voice was muffled by John’s skin but it sent vibrations down his spine.
~~~~~~
John looked up. “What?”
“Hmm.” John agreed but turned his head away, eyes still shut.
Sherlock gripped his shoulder and pulled him closer. “Normal people are so dull.”
“Fuck.” John cursed gripping Sherlock’s hips hard enough they’d bruise.
Outside of Hadeon he’d never been able to find a solid lead towards finding Mary and because of that their daughter was missing. All he had now was a demolished room and some melted petrol jugs, even he had to admit that there were limits to his own brilliance. So once again, he wasn’t able to find a single clue, nothing, that would even tell them they were on the right path.
“Irish?” Sherlock asked, his head lifting up like he had an idea. Harry nodded and watched as Sherlock tore his phone from his pocket. Both John and she waited as he did whatever it was he was doing.
John shrugged as best he could burrowed under the bedding. “We can’t coddle her, she doesn’t even know anything’s wrong.”
Sherlock waited for as long as he could stand and then slowly he squeezed himself around John.
“Why didn’t you want me to watch her?” Sherlock asked finally.
John couldn’t see Willa’s face but he would bet a tenner that she rolled her eyes. “I’m well. Have you brought me a present?”
John laughed. Willa bounced between typically childish books and things even John as an adult had very little interest in.
“Indeed.” Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I will make sure I’m available so you can go spend your days in Cardiff.”
Mycroft shook his head. “No, Reinette, I said I would hire someone to teach you French. You should have learned a second language years ago.”
Willa eventually broke the stillness of the moment by turning her head to John with a question in her eyes.
John felt he did well on Monday, he only texted Sherlock during the break for lunch. Of course he hadn’t actually had reception in the conference room they were all stuffed into, which he’d learned when he tried to text ten minutes after it started. He only spoke to Willa after she left school and before bed. John read to her that night after he found the play transcript online. Sherlock nearly fell asleep in bed with her.
Sherlock stirred only slightly. “I’m awake.” He mumbled.
John shook his head and Sherlock and resumed his holding up the wall, watching as Sherlock explained the various parts of the microscope to Willa.
Once she was done Janine refilled the cup with more water, this time there was nothing crushed into it so Willa drank it more willingly.
Then John noticed it in Sherlock’s arms.
Willa tried to bite her and she kicked out as the man came closer, he pushed her legs aside easily.
It was nearly one but John wasn’t able to sleep. He rolled onto his side, propping himself up on his elbow, he shook his head.
John held up a hand. “Sherlock I’ve been feeding her almost successfully for six years now. I
Willa was smitten, there was no other word for it. Even after the photos had been taken and they all settled back into their conversations she sat in the chair stroking him.
He left, stomping out of the room angrily, Willa could hear his footsteps down many of the stairs. Janine was quiet after he left and this time Willa really did fall asleep again.
“Just past one.” Sherlock explained.
Almost as soon as the car stopped Willa went racing out, Mrs. Hudson followed with surprising agility for a woman who’d had her hip replaced over the summer. John had gotten all the way outside of the car when he realized Sherlock was still sitting stone still in his seat.
He’d been surprised when Mycroft had looked older. The feeling didn’t make sense since fundamentally Sherlock understood that was how life worked. There were new lines around his eyes, laugh lines like somehow he’d been smiling more in the last five years. The indent on his left ring finger spoke volumes as to why.
The food kept sticking in her throat and she wanted to gag. She'd always hated the taste of artificial cherry, so much so she'd thought she hated cherries. She thought that up until last summer when Daddy had taken her to the beach. They'd stayed in a little cottage right by the shore, and one dad Daddy had bought a small basket of cherries. He'd chased her around playfully until she agreed to try one.
“Oh Willa.” Sherlock said as he looked at her. She was crying, a pile of tissues was building up near her leg. There were scrapes on the right side of her head and her right arm was in a splint hidden beneath a sling.
.” He admitted. “But once I knew what I was looking at it was rather easy to tell.”
He’d had Harry looked into shortly after John had moved in with Sherlock and he’d had her looked into more closely just before John returned to London with Willa. She was mostly unremarkable as far as people went. Three years older than John with a petty criminal record stretching back into her early teens, no doubt her form of rebellion against their father.
but you can.
There was a little intake of breath when Sherlock saw the contents that told John he’d picked up on the meanings. After a minute of silence John finally got the nerve to look up. He found Sherlock holding the little violin gingerly between his fingers, just staring at it.
~~~~~~
John smiled brightly and then kissed him softly.
“It raises it.” John answered without thinking.
“Six years,” Mycroft said more sharply than he’d meant to but he held any apologies and watched her until she began to turn. “And please make sure someone is trying to track this number,” he called out as she reached for the door.
John was on full alert the entire walk back to the flat and Sherlock refused to let Willa down even when she asked. They both breathed a sigh of relief when they reached the inside of the building and Sherlock finally put Willa down.
Sherlock had to reign in his smirk when this got the little girl to move. John had been worried about bringing Willa with them now saw the use of having a child with. John and Lisa Long watched as Marie approached Willa. When Willa looked to John he nodded.
“Sherlock,” John said softly as he stood, he carefully took the other man’s hand.
“Are we ready?” He asked as Sherlock took a step back from the chair.
John laughed. “It’s only 9:30.”
Willa’s face fell and John immediately cursed himself. “So you and Sherlock would have to get married before he could be my stepdad?”
“It’s stupid but I
John had broken into a fit of hysterical giggles because, really, a list? A list would even begin to cover it. A file perhaps, or maybe a whole god damn filing cabinet.
“And he was near my home?” John asked surprised.
It didn’t escape Sherlock’s notice that John was limping again, his right knee buckling ever so often when he tried to walk normally. He’d seen it give out several times in the past day but this was the first time John had actually begun limping again. Sherlock didn’t know how to stop it this time.
At one point Sherlock made a strangled noise in his throat, that was when John realized he’d seen the gesture too and was no doubt desperately trying to delete it.
“We’ll make our statements, Greg.” John told him, there was an undercurrent of steel in his tone, replacing the horrible flat affect from earlier. “And we’ll clear this scene but we won’t just wait at home.”
Erik finally looked up and made eye contact. “What?”
Sherlock followed her into the hall and John strained to hear her feet on the stairs, a knock and then the door open.
They got through pleasantries easily enough. Sherlock was unusually reserved and Mycroft had thankfully sensed the reservation in his brother and restrained his usual nitpicking. David ignored everyone from beneath expensive headphones, immersed in his mobile. Willa had raced off with Addison the second they’d seen each other, echoes of giggles and squeals alerted the adults to where they were.
Willa’s room was more of a task than he had anticipated. It was easy to overlook the mess as a typical child’s room but when he really looked at it, it was daunting. Willa had the equivalent of a toy store and a half crammed into her room. Sherlock realized there was no way to properly clean the room without binning at least some of it.
Lestrade pressed his lips together and seemed to think about it before shaking his head. “Not that I can think of, we’ve just been letting these places slide lately. We sweep out the squatters and they just set up somewhere else.”
It wasn’t that he’d never spent the day alone, he was always on his own when John worked. On those days though he would go down to the office and look for a new case or work on an old one. He wasn’t allowing himself that luxury right now. He was worried he’d become too involved in a case and forget to leave when it was time to get Willa. While he’d never forgotten her before John was always around to get her if he had ever truly needed or forgotten.
Sherlock looked away again. “I’m not jealous I’m just…” he wasn’t sure where he was going with that statement. He took a breath and began again. “I return after six years and John’s life revolves around her, as it rightfully should, but yours does as well and I would bet money Mrs. Hudson is positively obsessed with the girl. By all rights she appears to be the most interesting person in London.”
“My brother wouldn’t kill his son. He was the kind of dad who dropped everything for his kids. He was trying to win full custody of Noah and Lydia. Why would he kill Noah?” Lukas pleaded.
She looked up at Sherlock with wide eyes, her hands were behind her back.
John laughed sharply. “Maybe some other time.” He promised.
“She fell on the playground, we’ve had to send her to A and E in an ambulance.” Drescher admitted after only a second of hesitation.
Willa was curled up on one of the chairs in the office when he got there, she looked absolutely miserable. She wasn’t warm to the touch but flinched when he spoke. He lowered his voice to carry out his conversation with the secretary.
Greg grinned at him, Anthea didn’t bother looking up from her mobile, and Mycroft rolled his eyes. “Just for today, it would have been… uncomfortable in a normal car.”
John had been in bed for over an hour but the constant shifting told Sherlock he wasn’t asleep. John hadn’t slept the night prior either and the night before that had been when Sherlock had spotted Wolanski lingering around Baker street.
“After Willa’s birthday?” Sherlock asked sounding anxious.
Sherlock put her to bed that night and when he came down he had the strangest smile on his face.
Wrong.
John laughed. “He’s nervous which is perfectly normal for a dad-to-be, I was terrified. Once the baby is here he’ll have someone to direct all that energy towards.”
Sherlock was sure he was about to bring up the previous night when a noise that sounded suspiciously like a crash came from the kitchen. “Do you think that wise?” He asked.
“We’re going to the hospital,” John told him as he pulled away, heading for the nearest road.
This chapter was horrifically Frankensteined to life. I edited it and it seems smooth to me but if it has weird transitions I apologize.
Sherlock smiled to himself, knowing John couldn’t see. “Is this what you’re like after sex?”
At the beginning of his familiarity with the flat Mycroft was confident that it would never know such a thing as silence. Sherlock was always winging about something (usually Mycroft) and John, so eager to please in those days, would be following him about trying to find the neutral ground between Mycroft and his younger brother. As time marched on John worried less about pleasing Mycroft and the noise became jokes cracked at his expense.
“Fuck,” he hissed and yanked his hands away again.
Sherlock tore his eyes from memorizing all the books on the shelf. He nodded.
“Damn.” Sherlock cursed.
Sherlock shook his head. “Busy. Go away now.”
“Your trip down memory lane.” Mycroft said simply.
The child. He hadn’t forgotten about the baby but he’d left those thoughts behind the locked door of John’s wing. “So you
John joined them after a moment and between the three of them the tree was decorated in short order.
John did and enjoyed the burn of the bourbon sliding down his throat. After he finished, and Willa hadn’t returned downstairs, John went into the bedroom to change. Sherlock followed him.
John went to pick up Willa that day and by the time they returned home Sherlock had been through the case file twice. He’d managed come up with two solid hypotheses as to what happened but he
John, apparently oblivious to Sherlock’s inner struggle, continued. “Sherlock, this is Luke and Hayley Cooper.”
Greg nodded. “Alright so one person held her and the other one knocked out Harry.” He repeated trying to get a picture of what had happened. “So how’d they get her out without an entire restaurant noticing?”
“Oh god, someone call 999.”
“Mycroft, help.”
“So can I,” Lestrade said stiffly, “just trust me on this, Sherlock, stay out here.”
Sherlock blinked.
Nothing special, just a plain pink t-shirt a few sizes too big, a black pair of leggings, some knickers and a thin pair of socks. Willa was surprised when she realized that everything, other than the shirt, was in her size. They seemed to know a lot about her.
Sherlock nodded knowingly, because
As it turned out she was none too pleased to discover that Sherlock had resumed his life at 221B and he and John were very obviously carrying on with one another. She’d moved Cole Gilbert into London in February after their getaway and then in March came Janine Hawkins. That was when Irene felt stepping in was necessary, Mary only used Janine when things became personal.
John didn’t jump but his head whipped around quickly, Greg could tell he was wound tighter than piano wire. “Greg, Sherlock thought you would come.” If words could have marched in an orderly fashion from one’s vocal cords the ones coming from John’s lips would have.
“Sherlock?” John asked from his spot in the doorway of the burnt out room.
Willa was unreasonably chipper.
When John disappeared with her up the stairs at nine Sherlock took the opportunity to examine the flat.
Just as he was considering how to speed up the process his private mobile began ringing on the table behind him. Mycroft reached for it because, as much as he didn’t want to spoil their lovely night in, there were only a few people who had the privilege of knowing his private number and with one of them sitting across from him the number dropped drastically. He sighed when he saw Sherlock’s number blinking on the screen.
Even if it went horribly between him and Sherlock he wouldn’t be able to keep Willa away from him permanently. Not after everything the man had done to keep her safe.
Sherlock stood when he realized he recognized Lukas from the funeral that day, he’d been one of the ostracized members of Erik’s family.
John cursed at him.
“Gregory,” Mycroft ventured after a beat, “is it her?”
Lestrade just sighed and walked towards the rail and looked up questioningly.
“Yes.” Sherlock agreed.
“I… don’t know.” Sherlock admitted to his knees. Teddy had been…not unpleasant but when John had mentioned Willa had been smaller he found himself imagining how it would be with a child of his own.
Willa jumped up and ran into the bathroom to check her hair in the mirror. John winced as the sound of her sandals echoed off the tile. It was only mid-June but he’d finally given into her pleas to wear the horrible things. She hated the routine of shoes and socks, taking them off as soon as she could which made winters difficult, so when the weather began to creep just the slightest bit towards warm she would beg John for her sandals.
John had to remind himself to breathe. “Willa’s missing.” It fell out of his mouth in a rush, blunter than he’d planned on telling her, but then how do you tell someone that your child has been kidnapped?
Willa cleared her throat and Sherlock schooled his startled reaction. She was standing in front of him holding out two toys.
~~~~~
Louise was Mary’s contribution and John didn’t bother to ask where it came from, he found he didn’t care.
Willa allowed him to pull her hand away from her. She only hissed slightly when he ran it under the water.
Mycroft stood in front of what John assumed was a one way mirror. There was a man on the other side handcuffed to a chair, his nose was broken and his left eye swollen shut. Sherlock stood in a corner his back to the mirror.
Sherlock was the one to hail the cab and direct them where to go. John had all but disappeared when Molly had called them. The only thing left was the shell of his partner, worn and definitely battered, seemingly wholly unoccupied.
John flushed pleasantly and licked his lips, a success for Sherlock. “Alright I’ll go get them.”
John nodded. “Yeah, of course. I signed where I had to last night. It’s just up to you now.”
Molly’s face fell. “Oh John, I would have but-“
John made a pleased noise and chuckled. “Smug bastard.”
“Melting ice cubes.”
Despite being irritated at Sherlock for blowing something simple out of proportion John had to smile at that declaration. He’d always hoped Sherlock would like Willa or at least be able to stand her so they could continue their friendship. To hear Sherlock admit that he loved her, quite possibly the first time John had heard Sherlock admit to loving anyone in such explicit terms, was very close to a dream come true.
Harry noticed this too. “Sherlock, I thought you were off dying somewhere.” She spat back.
“My homeless network needs rebuilding. I thought it was a perfectly appropriate allocation of my time.” Defended Sherlock as he resolutely refused to sit across the desk from his brother.
Stalk me:
Sherlock got to the stairs first, his long legs giving him an advantage, but John was close behind.
John.
John had shaken his head before realizing that Mycroft couldn’t see him, well probably couldn’t. “No. I didn’t want to put Willa in care after Mary so I just figured it would be best if I didn’t look a gift horse in the mouth. Jesus Mycroft that’s more than I’d make full time at the surgery. Why the hell did he need a flat mate?”
“You’re not giving him enough credit John.” Mrs. Hudson tutted at him.
“That night, after Bart’s, I was too busy trying to figure out who the fuck Sherlock Holmes was to even have time to consider it again.”
It was a silly thing getting so upset over cut hair, especially given the rest of the circumstances, but that was their thing. Every morning now they could be found at the table where Sherlock brushed and did Willa’s hair while they talked about what they were going to do that day. At night Sherlock would pull it out of whatever style she’d worn that day and brush it, often for much longer than was necessary. Willa never once complained though, she was always too busy describing her day or reading out loud from a new book that had magically appeared on her desk overnight.
Sherlock gladly removed his hand and crawled up John’s body. John wrapped a hand around his cock to steady it, the other one coming to rest on Sherlock’s hips.
Willa didn’t understand why they only saw Harry a few times a year instead of the frequency in which she saw Mycroft or even Molly. John knew one day he would have to sit down and explain the addiction to her but for now, at six, Willa didn’t need to know those details. John would tell her about it when she got old enough that her own predisposition towards addiction became something she needed to be aware of.
“Alright.” Sherlock agreed.
When Sherlock pulled out a small separate box John sucked in a breath and began fighting in earnest with the garland.
“I know”
She was entirely too calm sounding for someone who had just kidnapped a child.
Sherlock shrugged. “And yet it’ll be a miracle if your sister gets there before we do.”
“Alright who is it?” He asked not turning his head from the window.
Sherlock sighed and closed the folder. “John stand up.”
he knew John had trouble with the death of a child. “Was he ill?” Sherlock asked as he began eating part of the sandwich he’d ordered.
, 2017.”
“Yeah… sort of, but I don’t think Sherlock likes you saying it like that.” John agreed.
“I know.”
Sherlock walked back over to the bed and took a deep breath. He put one knee up onto the side of the bed, the other leg still planted on the floor and then opened the bottle. After pouring some onto his fingers he tossed it up onto the bed near John’s hip.
John smiled wryly. “Or maybe I’m giving Willa too much.”
One look across the room at Gregory and Mycroft knew he’d received the same phone call. He looked as though he’d aged several years in less than a minute, suddenly pale.
“Not now, John,” Sherlock said absently as he looked up and down the alley deciding which direction to go.
Greg had been called to the scene but it was clear there’d been no foul play. Only a tragic accidental hanging. Greer Fisher had to be taken away and treated for shock.
Sherlock sighed and threw his hands up. “I had told you it would be.” He disappeared into the kitchen in a huff.
Willa convinced her eyes to blink open and looked around.
“No, he brought it to my attention. The Yard is on it anyway, a missing heiress is big news, I’ve just used my seniority to insert myself into the case.” Lestrade said and refused to take it back.
“Five of them?”
“I just need to pop upstairs for a moment.” Sherlock said with a smile.
“I knew he was married, the imbecile only took off the ring right before we met, but I was not aware of this.” Sherlock gestured to the photo.
Once John regained composure he favored Sherlock with a smile. “God I’ve missed you saying things like that.”
Sherlock turned at her tone. “Dying snow colors is hardly an experiment.” John was growing concerned he was about to have to intervene in this very bizarre spat.
Jessica pulled her bottom lip in between her teeth and Mycroft sighed, that would be a no then. “Why?”
“Enough!” John bellowed and shoved Sherlock’s phone back in his hands.
“It’s allergies.” John pronounced after he’d done his check of Willa. “She’s headed towards a sinus infection, hence the headache, but until it gets there I won’t treat for it.”
She jumped up suddenly, her own gift forgotten, and threw herself at him. She wrapped her arms around his waist in a hug and buried her face in his chest. “Do you really like it?” She asked muffled by his clothes.
“Gregory has decided to apply for majority custody. She’s digging in her heals, of course, so there must be a hearing.” Mycroft explained.
“Oh thank god.” Lukas sighed in relief and came to shake Sherlock’s hand once more.
Sherlock didn’t want to leave the bedroom so he set himself up with the laptop in the space next to her. He checked his email and found a few more boring cases, one of which he solved as soon as he read it.
The nurse chuckled. “She’ll be fine.”
Neither of them spoke during the entire cab ride to the hospital. John didn’t dare open his mouth right now, certainly not in the back of a cab. He wasn’t sure what the cause of Sherlock’s silence was especially since he hadn’t explained what was going, but he was grateful for it on some level. Sherlock being quiet meant he didn’t have to answer and that was going to keep him from appearing insane, even it was for just a few more minutes.
Sherlock made a noise in his throat that matched how John felt.
Sherlock could only nod and pull the grapes out from the sink. As he turned he pulled one off and held it out to John. “Eat or you’ll moan later.”
“Suicide in his cell overnight.” Sherlock said.
Sherlock flopped onto his back and glared over at John. “Your daughter is an appalling alarm.”
During one such arrest, his life took another bizarre turn. Colonel Moran showed up, in person, and bailed him out even though Cole didn’t even know how even begin to try and contact the man.
There was movement on the end of the line. “Yes, sir.”
“Sherlock,” He said, surprised at how rough his own voice came out.
“None.” Sherlock spat in disgust. “She left her flat of her own free will, though of course it was hard to tell because the morons at the yard had dug around it.”
Downstairs Sherlock found his violin sitting in his chair. He desperately wanted to play it but he was loath to wake Willa. It was an odd feeling since he’d never cared before.
John barely glanced into the room before shoving Sherlock aside and darting in. Harry was lying, crumpled on the floor, a small stream of blood running down the side of her face. She was unconscious.
There was a gaping black pit in his gut as he drove. The extent of the fire would have made sense if they’d murdered someone (her) in the room and were trying to hide evidence. It was the dumping of the body in such a place that made him wonder what the hell they were up to.
“No, I think the problem is she’s rather good at it.” John disagreed.
Willa didn’t want to nod but her mouth felt dry and sticky so she did anyway.
Sherlock stood and stepped in front of him, pushing between his knees. He cupped John’s face and tilted it up to look at him. “I am aware. In fact I even thought of it but there was a problem.”
“Thank you for that. It’s the only home she knows. But I’m serious we’ll find a way to make it work if it’s what you want. But obviously this doesn’t need to be decided tonight so uh, goodnight again.” This time he actually turned and went into the bedroom.
“The school called. Willa’s complaining of a headache and asking to come home.” John explained in a rushed way. “I told them one of us would come and it’s sort of crazy here.”
"And you need distracting?"
Sherlock tried not to smile because he was right, John would take it the wrong way.
Willa nodded and went, realizing they weren't going to tell her anything else. Once she was done Janine took her hand and pulled her out into the hallway near the stairs. They stood watching as Cole finally moved and grabbed one of the big orange jugs. He too went into the bathroom but Willa quickly realized he wasn't dumping the jugs down the drain, a brownish puddle began trickling out under the door. He came back into the room and grabbed the next canister, dumping it all on the mattress where she'd slept. By now the smell had reached Willa's nose and she gasped.
“Was the phone line tapped?” Mycroft asked after he had finished reading.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at the other man.
“But…” John said slowly and he paused to think about how he wanted to say this. “Sherlock and I don’t actually have to get married first for him to adopt you.” He finished.
“Fuck.” John cursed again but he got the hint and began moving, gently.
“John, I believe my brother would have known even if I hadn’t told him.” Sherlock said and then grabbed his arm. “We’ll be going now. Try not to need us before Sunday night.” He said this both to Mycroft and Greg.
when I left on Saturday. I swear.”
John nodded.
John only noticed his right knee giving out when Sherlock, who’d been inching closer every second, was forced to catch his arm to steady him. “What?” John hissed after a moment.
That, Sherlock could agree to.
John leaned over and whispered. “Should we call Mycroft?”
She groaned and tried to roll away from John.
Remember how I said in the last chapter that John wasn't morally innocent?
“Why would I take fashion advice from a five-year-old who insists stripes and polka dots are perfectly acceptable together?”
John stood, jacket still bundled in his hand, and seemed to consider for a moment. “Fine,” he said, still clearly annoyed.
Lestrade crossed to the desk and shook his head. “Not my case.”
John’s eyes opened and blinked at him, then he huffed out a breath.
The vehicle was idling just down the block when he finally got out the door and not surprisingly Mycroft was seated in the back.
Sherlock sighed heavily. “Really, John? We’re not even religious, what’s the point?”
didn’t sleep through the night. She was capable of it of course, but she saw no need because as soon as she cried her
Sherlock looked up at John. He wanted to say something to calm him down, to reassure him. To remind him that sometimes the littlest details were the ones that solved the case. But he was worried it might set John off even more.
Sherlock nodded and came back into the living room.
“Make sure they do a thorough job.” Sherlock said before standing and walking towards the door. Once he realized John was not following he looked over his shoulder. “Let’s go, John.”
He’d only gotten his shirt unbuttoned when there was a thumping sound above their heads. He paused and looked up, confused as it continued. He glanced over at Sherlock about to ask him what the hell that was when Willa let out an almighty shriek.
whoooopsies
“Willa come here.” He said quickly.
John laughed. It wasn’t a small chuckle but a deep laugh from his stomach and he didn’t stop. As he dropped Sherlock’s wrist to wrap an arm around his middle, he found he missed it. Sherlock was beginning to get concerned after a moment since he didn’t think anything he had said was actually that funny.
John showered as quickly as he could manage. When he came out, towel wrapped around his hips, he found Sherlock lounging on the bed stripped down to black silk pants. They weren’t new and John had seen them dozens of times but the sight still made his mouth water.
“What time is it?” Sherlock asked after a moment.
“What?” John asked before Greg even had a chance.
“Let’s leave this to someone else.” John said trying to catch Sherlock’s eye.
“What are you two so happy about?” Sherlock asked, his eyes narrowed.
John flipped a few pages on the wall calendar. “Yeah, your birthday’s during the week so I’ll talk to your teacher and we’ll make cupcakes.”
There were signs of the girl everywhere in the flat.
Aaron and Molly locked eyes. John could see that they both wanted to take him up on his offer but were worried about leaving their son.
“John’s still at work.” Sherlock informed her as he searched the medicine cabinet for the thermometer.
They crossed the bridge and the jogger had turned left, this would be a true test to see if he was correct. Willa turned left as well but Sherlock grabbed John’s arm and steered them towards the right and back towards Baker Street.
Teddy was about as heavy as Willa had been at a month old but he was still so light. John carefully cradled the still sleeping boy into his elbow and wiggled the blanket down to get a good look at him. He had full cheeks and bright pink lips that were pursed and moving slightly as he sucked at an imaginary bottle in his sleep.
Sherlock groaned. “That’s not actually what you’ve decided to call that is it?”
Mycroft got him several high-end jumpers and Greg got him two tickets to a rugby match, whereas John got Mycroft a tie that he hated to admit cost the price of one of his coats and a good bottle of whiskey for Greg. Mrs. Hudson received a new scarf and box of a variety of teas and she had made them baked goods that Greg immediately dove into and at one point unceremoniously shoved a cookie into Mycroft’s mouth while he protested.
Sherlock recoiled. John sighed again, softer and he reached out a hand and began rubbing small circles into Sherlock’s back.
Sherlock already had the whiskey out when John made it back downstairs.
John was lucky, she left him over half of her chips and several bites of burger. He ordered her an ice cream while he finished.
“What about Willa?” Harry asked. Willa, who had been watching the whole exchange like a tennis match, suddenly shrank into John’s side.
“Stop asking John. I won’t tell you.” Sherlock told him.
was spinning.
“Here’s her things… probably enough for a week.” John said as he put the bags on the table. “I haven’t checked her bag but please check and see if she has homework.”
This seemed to satisfy Willa. “Good, everyone should have treats on their birthday.”
Sherlock didn’t say anything to that, just turned and looked into the fire.
John shook his head. “You’re right. Later?”
Greer nodded. “Yes. I got in last night the police insisted I return to the country because of this whole mess. Knowing Belle they’ll find her in Monaco with alcohol poisoning in a few days.”
Sherlock found John leaning against the wall of the alley, emptying the contents of his dinner onto the dirty street below him.
John turned towards the stove and messed with the kettle so Sherlock couldn’t see his smile. “Why would I be lying? We are very happy she’s got the cast off. Aren’t you?”
Of course, there had been the thank you donations into her account every time she sent off a text, and yes, maybe that should have tipped off that things weren't exactly on but how was she to know it was going to become this?
“My head hurts.” Willa whined and buried her face into his shirt. She was also obviously congested.
“I guess if we feel the need to label it.” John agreed.
“I scolded her Mycroft, I didn’t hit her.” John said wearily as he dropped into his seat. He wasn’t entirely sure that he wouldn’t disappear if he did ever strike her.
“We’ll have to get rid of some of it.” He had told her.
Mycroft looked completely surprised at the question but comprehension drew across his face. “Yes, Sherlock is alive at this moment and currently defying all expectations of him.”
Sherlock carefully shrugged. “I might have scared a nurse when she planned to argue against me going up to radiology with Willa.”
John returned the sigh but stood anyway. “What?”
Not long after there was a commotion in the hall and then John appeared in the doorway.
Greg closed the bag and handed it behind him. Evidently, he’d been elected the one to deal with them exclusively. A new bag appeared in his hand and he took a step towards Sherlock, “Sherlock.”
“Look Sherlock, like I said I’m really very tired. I just want a shower and bed. Do you mind if I do that? I’ll be home tomorrow afternoon.” John interrupted him before he could say anything else.
anything else.
“Harry.” John hissed. “Willa is right up the stairs.”
“Sherlock Holmes?” He answered.
Lestrade scrubbed a hand over his face. “This isn’t a case, Sherlock.”
“Excuse me?” Greer raged
John looked up at him in surprise. “Sherlock they’ve been circling like vultures since you got back to London. Did you not know that?”
John had anticipated it. She’d had a long day and even after falling asleep in the cab she would be exhausted. If she got up at her normal time she’d just end up being a bear all day. He noticed though that at quarter past Sherlock began shooting concerned glances up the stairs. Then at 8:45 he went and stood at the bottom of them. Sherlock had never been around for one of Willa’s catch up days and was no doubt fretting about why the girl who was up at 6:30 nearly every morning was still in bed two hours later.
“Why are we here?” John asked after reading over Hadeon’s sheet of priors.
Just as he was about to respond to John’s text his phone went off again.
He looked around to see what had done it, he hadn’t noticed. There, at his feet, was a teacup lying in pieces with the saucer shattered in a halo around it. A noise involuntarily tore itself from his throat as he pulled his hands away, fully intending to reach down to see which cup it’d been.
If Willa hadn’t been laying quietly in his arms John would have punched something. Instead he reigned in his fury and simply crumpled the photo violently. “When did she start?”
(See the end of the chapter for
She raised her hand to her head expecting to feel a bump. She didn’t know why her head hurt, or why everything was moving so much. It felt like the room was spinning or she was spinning,
It sat untouched on the desk in the living room. Sherlock worried then too.
That did the trick.
“We’ll mail them in the morning.” Sherlock promised him against his lips.
“Deborah is in Cyprus with her new boyfriend and asked if we would take the children for the entire break.” Mycroft informed him.
Sherlock nodded.
“You’re angry, Barnes, we all are,” Moran had reassured him while shoving several cups of coffee at him. “But you’re a soldier and we carry on, but now I’ve got a mission for you.”
“Oh.” John was surprised to see that he was correct. The blood coming from several cuts on his own hands.
At 1:25 while John was between patients his phone vibrated with a text from Sherlock’s.
John deflated. “If I want to keep my job I have to.”
“It’s hers then,” Greg asked again because John’s voice was failing him. The detective was most likely unaware of the significance Willa’s slightly unruly main had for her and Sherlock.
John was doing his best not to smile at Sherlock’s antics. “You can intimidate her other teachers later, today we’ve got to meet with the head teacher.”
“Oh what the hell!” John cried from the living room on Thursday.
“Your custody agreement with the mother. How often do you have the children?” Sherlock repeated.
“Yes, but that’s too easy to guess at. What’s another?” Sherlock asked as he filled the last liner in this batch.
Willa didn’t, she liked her hair the way it was but she was too afraid to tell her no.
John’s lips pursed into a tight line. “I don’t know…”
Willa’s entire body felt like she was under water. She wanted to scream but her body wasn’t listening again. The whole world spun when the man took her from the woman. He carried her the way Papa did sometimes when she was tired, with her legs around his waist and her head on his shoulder.
John nodded. “I know and I know you’re more than capable of watching her. Just know I worry, I’ve always worried.”
“How are John and Sherlock,” Mycroft asked once they were done.
“Mycroft.” Sherlock answered.
“Where’d those come from?” John asked as he took the second cookie.
“It’s not worth it,” Greg snapped clearly not wanting to hear her rationale.
Sherlock couldn’t find fault in that logic.
Greg sighed. “I don’t want to hear it, Sherlock. If he’s doing something illegal just leave me out of it.”
John cursed himself for not thinking ahead and warning Harry about the adoption. He hadn’t really planned on telling her until they had a date for when it would become official. He hadn’t thought about the fact that Willa had completely stopped calling Sherlock by name.
“I don’t know!” He shouted, “I don’t, bloody, know.” There was another hit to the roof of the car and Mycroft jumped.
“Why are you in bed?” John asked looking at the clock next to the bed, making sure he was correct as to the time.
Sherlock followed him, still rubbing circles into his back.
Sherlock didn’t answer and turned to look at Willa.
Sherlock snapped the magnifier shut. “There are light scuffs on the stalls, not from regular soles but from the foam sandals she was wearing.” He explained and pointed to what appeared to be a random spot on the cubical door. “Smeared hand print here.” He pointed to the divider. “She reached out at one point to try and pull herself away.”
John couldn’t imagine anything more beautiful.
Sherlock wanted to argue but he found no fault in Mycroft’s logic. He did trust his brother but it would never be as simple and pure as John’s trust, that stage of their relationship had died when they were children. Sherlock fought Mycroft over every ounce of help he tried to give, tried to ignore every bit of advice he gave. It was the nature of their relationship now.
Gregory sat up at this news and began scrubbing at his face. “Shit.”
So, uhm remember when I said this was gunna be a lot darker? Yeah, well boy do I have a treat for ya'll. Seriously, there's some graphic description of some very very very bad stuff in this chapter. I make up for mildly horrific content with WORDS, SO MANY WORDS.
“Are you alright?” John asked carefully.
Harry shrugged and played with the hem of her shirt. “Two stitches, not much damage. Head wounds bleed a lot.” She told them and idly rubbed at a dried spot of blood on her blouse. She hoped it was her blood, she hadn’t seen what they’d done to Willa.
~~~~~~
Yet here was John, standing in their kitchen, refusing to kiss him. Sherlock would have fled the second his advances had been rejected except John was holding him in place, refusing to let him back away.
Papa’s voice echoed around in her head. He’d once said that about the toilets at a shop when the didn’t have an automatic flush.
Sherlock went into the bedroom and Willa was still asleep. He read through the file once again and nothing of interest jumped out at him so he resorted to the internet.
The next morning John only felt mild embarrassment about his small breakdown over Willa’s birthday. He wasn’t sure if the stress and lack of sleep were entirely to blame or if he’d been this dramatic in previous years, except of course without and audience.
“You don’t know how important meeting you that day was.” John said quietly just as Sherlock was about to fall asleep.
“What?” John asked, still trying to read his book.
Wednesday morning came much the way Monday did but after breakfast Willa disappeared upstairs.
“Who do you work for?” Sherlock asked stepping forward, he was holding something in his hands in front of him.
“Oh wow, I guess the rumors were true.” Mr. West said as he watched the exchange.
“You said ‘putting the tree up’ not ‘getting a tree’ so the tree is most likely artificial.” Sherlock explained and sounded irritated having to do so. John was secretly pleased because Sherlock had been unusually patient and apathetic towards things that had once driven him mad.
“I…” He’d not thought about it. He’d been avoiding thinking of their maybe date for the past two days altogether. “I don’t know.”
“And where do you intend to meet clients? Or put up crime scene photos? Over the mantel where you used to? In full view of a six-year-old?”
and they stuck a needle into her and
John stopped short outside the hospital and pulled his phone out to call Lestrade.
“Luke.” John greeted once the man was within speaking distance, he extended a hand.
“Why not?” John challenged.
Though he didn’t know precisely where they were heading, Sherlock did know that there were only a handful of neighborhoods to choose from. The kinds of areas where no one asked questions or spoke to the police about strange happenings. It was still much too extensive a list to give to John.
“You wake it you take it.” John called after him. His only response was a huff of derision.
“For a physician, you don’t go nearly as often as you should.”
“I will teach Willa and supervise, as with the feeding and the grooming.” Sherlock promised earnestly.
I know I said this was the last chapter but I couldn't do all I wanted in one go so this is the SECOND to last chapter. I'm posting the final chapter as well, since I've already written it out.
John pulled his fingers away finally and waited until he caught Sherlock’s eye.
John sighed and pulled back clearly exasperated. “Sherlock.” His tone was warning.
John grabbed Sherlock’s hand and led him to them.
“They’re still in London, John,” Mycroft told him sounding bored, “we have faces and a car to look for. That is more than we might have hoped for.”
John snorted inelegantly but wasn’t surprised. Sherlock never learned to hide his reaction to Captain Watson. “You liked that, did you?”
Sherlock wasn’t that surprised, he knew Mycroft had been sitting on the news of his and John’s relationship probably since the day it started. He would have had no problem waiting even longer before rubbing it in Sherlock’s face that he knew.
In case you didn't get the joke because I've been informed my humor is not always obvious the 'unspoken inferences' about Lestrade and dolphins is that dolphins are notoriously horny animals, draw from that what you will.
“John.”
Mycroft reached out for Gregory before he got to him. Gregory pulled him into a fierce kiss before moving away just as abruptly and then jogging back out of the library.
“What the hell?” It was Greg finally having caught up with them just in time to see John punching out a window.
John shifted back in between his legs and pressed soft kisses to Sherlock’s stomach.
“John, we’re going to a hospital to speak to a family about their ill son. She is no way in any danger.” Sherlock sighed.
“Doctor? What’s his doctorate in?” Sherlock asked suddenly derailed.
A particularly young DS had asked them to write up a list of any people who might wish to harm them. This had gotten Sherlock’s attention from whatever argument he’d been having with Irene. He’d just stared at the boy like he’d lost his mind, speechless by his stupidity.
That normally would not have raised any concern for Sherlock, after all he was dressed in runners’ leggings. It was the fact that he had a backpack on that raised suspicion. Not something one normally wore for a run.
John grinned broadly and reached forward grabbing Sherlock’s hands and yanking him forward off his chair. Sherlock barely had time to settle his knees beneath him before John was tilting the detectives chin up towards him and pressing their lips together. They kissed until Sherlock was dizzy and panting from both the fact they were kissing, finally
“My little girl’s out in the waiting room.” John said and pulled a couple notes from his pocket. “Why don’t you two go get a snack?”
Sherlock opened the box while John determinedly did not look at him. Willa was oblivious to the whole thing and was currently finding the best spot for her next ornament.
“Yes?” He asked.
“Are you coming with us?” John asked as he finished the dishes.
Mycroft patted Willa’s head. “I’m good, my dear. How are you?”
“Greg,” John said into the phone. “Do you remember Janine Hawkins from my wedding?”
He had been wearing his ring for most of the trip which ruled out removing the ring to be unfaithful. So he had removed it either to spare himself the questions about it or because he was worried about Sherlock’s reactions. No doubt it was being kept on person so he could slip it back on the second he was out of Sherlocks sight.
Mrs. Hudson gave them a small funny little smile before disappearing into her flat.
John cursed Willa in his head, he had thought he’d done a better job at hiding them from her. John knew exactly what was inside of the box: a small petri dish with a fake virus culture, a violin, a tiny glass Florence flask, a golden sun, and a fuzzy white rabbit. He’d seen the sun while buying Willa’s first ornament and had grabbed it on impulse. Every year after he found another that reminded him of Sherlock. Typically they were hung near the back of the tree simply because seeing them every day during the holiday made him sad thinking about Sherlock who wasn’t home.
“What on earth are you doing?” He asked as she wrestled her prizes between them and out the door.
“And you’ve been exhausted all day.”
Sherlock nodded and turned his head so he could press a kiss to John’s palm. “I’ll find her.” He promised because that was one thing he was sure of, he would find Willa.
“Sherlock. I wanted to ask you…” She trailed off until John squeezed her hand and gave her an encouraging smile.
“Well if Sherlock adopted you, which would be a bit different than what Molly did, he would be just… your other father I guess.” John explained. It was a difficult process to describe to anyone, much less a child.
Barely twenty-five minutes had passed when the sound of something shattering upstairs drew Sherlock’s attention from the newspaper archives. He flew up the stairs not even seconds later. Willa was sitting in the hall with something shattered at her feet.
John dropped the smile. “Willa that’s-”
Sherlock left after that, not liking how accurate his brother had been in his assessment.
The gifts for the adults were predictable at this point.
.” Willa said as if that explained everything.
He didn’t want to go in. He knew what waited when he did: all of Willa’s things and an empty flat to remind him she wasn’t there. He took a deep breath and willed himself to take a step forward. He didn’t have to go upstairs, someone really did need to warn Mrs. Hudson what had happened. She was family and deserved to learn it from them and not when the police eventually came around.
“But you said it
Greg shrugged. “Could be,” he offered, “an intentional fire set to an empty room in an abandoned building.”
John went out of his way to offer his condolences to the older woman he assumed to be Noah’s paternal grandmother. He felt Emma’s glares as he walked away.
~~~~~~
“Hair,” Sherlock said softly before turning back into the room.
Sherlock swallowed down the immediate reaction to tell her what he’d told Lestrade. He especially did not want to mention the brother to her, though. “Because of the boy’s connection to my partner’s daughter.” He said slowly. This didn’t make him feel as uncomfortable.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No secrets.” John told him, licking his lips, and he then looked down to contemplate the inside of his empty mug. “Also I feel you should be completely aware that I have a history of making terrible decisions when I’m upset that extends past us knowing each other.”
“Listen, I know but I need you to come right to me as soon as you figure out who this is,” She explained gesturing towards the bag.
“Because, Sherlock, women of power are
"Yes," Janine answered shortly, "if I was told to. It's not like you won't be paid for it."
Mycroft’s mouth snapped shut audibly as the news registered. “Keep me updated,” was all he managed to say before hanging up.
Sherlock looked down at her with a raised eyebrow. “Yes.” He said slowly.
John glanced over at Sherlock and properly looked at him for the first time since entering the room. He realized he honestly couldn’t read him right now. It was disconcerting.
Lestrade was right behind her.
“Never thought I’d see the day when Captain Watson settled down with a little one.” Luke said teasingly.
John sighed loudly. “Yes, fine.”
“Poor John.” Sherlock tutted.
Sherlock’s arm snapped out and he pointed to something under the sink, both John and Greg crouched to get a look at it. It was the plastic cap from over the top of a hypodermic needle. “No one notices people carrying out a sleeping child.”
“I don’t know,” Greg ground out, barely able to get his jaw working to form the words.
“Sherlock, stop.” John said and placed a single hand on his chest. It was enough to keep Sherlock from moving forward.
Mycroft's lips turned down into a small scowl. "No," he said simply, "you're more useful here."
Sherlock shrugged. “Not really, no.”
Sherlock lifted his head. “Why did you say that?”
Sherlock watched her and found he didn’t mind Christmas so much this year. He doubted he would ever love the holiday the way some people did but this year, with Willa and John safe and happy, it wasn’t so bad. The thought of his brother’s dinner loomed over his head threatening to break their tiny bubble of happiness.
John sighed and leaned against the wardrobe. “This is hardly dressing nice for you Sherlock and because it’s respectful.”
“I got mugged when I was seventeen, fought the wanker off and got a penknife to the gut for my troubles.” John told him.
“Someone was watching the flat.”
“Alright come here.” Sherlock said and put the thermometer down for later. He carried her into his bedroom, he dug through John’s drawers until he found a plain t-shirt. He handed it over to Willa.
John cleared his throat. “Mr. Wolfe are you aware Sherlock has proved people innocent before? If you’re innocent how can it hurt to share your story with the world’s most brilliant detective?”
Sherlock sighed at his brother’s oversight, he tugged John’s arm to move him so he could hug him. “I’m sorry. No wonder you were so worried.”
John had protested loudly when he opened his present from Sherlock, a new laptop, until both Sherlock and Willa chose to ignore him for several minutes. He hugged Willa until she complained when he opened the tea cups they had painted. She proudly told him Sherlock had helped her make them. John had leaned his head against his side and whispered a thanks, as Willa continued to open her gifts he didn’t move away.
“Willa why don’t you help Addison hand out the presents?” Mycroft called over, saving them from what might have been an epic sulk.
She nodded. “Daddy wants you there too.”
John turned his head into the pillow to suppress a chuckle, failing miserably.
Greg swallowed and allowed a gap to form between he and John before he asked. “And Willa?”
“I want to taste all of you.” Sherlock whispered against his pulse point, tongue darting out to press against it.
It was John’s turn to look at the other man inquiringly.
“His name is Hadeon Wolanski. Known ties to the Ukrainian Mafia. Previous charges for extortion, money laundering, and theft to name a few.” Mycroft recited handing over a paper to John.
They hadn’t told her about them.
Sherlock nodded. “Yes and Disodium Diphosphate,
Jessica closed the file and handed it to him, “three times a year at least.”
John wasn’t sure how Willa was going to take the news. She knew Noah, hell they played together enough that John had met the boy a few times in the school yard when picking her up. The only death Willa had experienced in her life was the death of the goldfish she’d won at a festival when she was three. That was in no way comparable to how she’d feel over the death of a friend.
“The college, the museum, the planetarium and then we get to eat dinner at Angelo’s.” Willa rattled of sounding especially excited about dinner.
“What are you doing on there tonight?” John asked because Sherlock hadn’t just been scrolling through the pages as he normally did. Tonight he’d been typing away frantically.
Mr. West’s attention had been drawn over John’s shoulder.
John smirked. “Afraid you’ll be distracted?” He asked and reach out again.
"Yeah, I was told I'd have to do a lot of things, but not this!"
“The fireworks?” He asked turning to look at Sherlock with awe.
He rolled his eyes. “John.” Sherlock grabbed his ankle and shook him.
Mycroft shot him a look Sherlock remembered all too well from their childhood, the ‘don’t be an idiot, Sherlock’ one. “Of course I am.”
laptop) and John was trying to read.
Another rule Sherlock had expected. John had been understanding about Sherlock’s drug habits the first time around, hadn’t run from the flat when he found out he was moving in with a former addict. He sat with Sherlock all night when he needed.
She’d used his phone that night to look up what determined a person’s height. Not that she didn’t believe Daddy but he always said that sometimes even he got the answers wrong and it was good to double check. He hadn’t been wrong that time though.
Sherlock bounced her. “No.” He said as he carried her into the bathroom.
