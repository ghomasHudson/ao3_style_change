Tony must have had the identical expression of shock on his face that Bruce had. “Oh my god, you made an actual joke!”
“That would require us to go into space,” Clint pointed out. “I’m not sure I’m comfortable with that idea.”
“I know you are, Point Break, but the rest of the planet isn’t.” Tony paused, clearly waiting for the rest of them to catch up.
“This is where the inmates get to choose their future,” Crowley said. “Each route leads to a different level of Hell.” He pointed at the middle one, directly opposite from where they were standing. “That’s the direct route to the Cage, but we’re not going to take that one.”
This time her smile was genuine. “You’re a smart man, Mr. Stark,” she acknowledged. “Now, tell us why we should support your amendments to the Sokovia Accords and make a submission to the United Nations in our own capacity?”
Bucky stared at Loki. “What happened to you, that sucks. Believe me, I know how it feels to be used. But your kid…” His throat worked. “Whatever they did to your kid, it was worse because he doesn’t know better.”
“That is still the strangest thing I’ve seen happening in a very long time.” Tony raised his eyebrows.
Tony wanted to scream. “It was all on the tablet,” he protested. “How am I supposed to remember something that complicated?”
Clint got up and went to Bruce, clapping a hand on his shoulder. “I’m pretty useless except in combat, so I’ll help keep an eye on the loser,” he said, but his eyes were somber. “Can’t have him wake up without me there to call him Sleeping Beauty or telling him that it was my kiss that woke him up.”
Loki's mouth twisted in vague disagreement, but he remained silent as they all watched Wanda regain control of herself. Steve kept an ear open for Bucky and Tony, hoping they hadn't heard the commotion.
“You were my friend.” Steve met Tony’s gaze, not flinching from the surprise that disappeared quickly behind that hatefully practiced blank stare. “I failed you. I failed us.”
“Such an asshole,” Tony sighed, dropping his head back down to the pillow. “Have you just been lying here staring at me, you giant creep?” he asked.
And Steve wanted to say no. He wanted to protest and demand that his team love his friend as much as he did. His heart felt so full he worried about it bursting.
Tony squared his shoulders and headed downstairs to open the door. Vision and Rhodey were in the living room, not even trying to hide their curiosity. Peter came out of the kitchen with Bruce at his heels. He waggled his eyebrows salaciously at Tony. “Humanah, humanah, humanah,” he intoned.
“All that we’ve talked about is that goddamn formula,” Bucky said. “How does it work? What do we do while it’s being done…worked…calculated…what the fuck ever” He looked more than a little frustrated.
“Still such a punk.” Bucky shook his head, mouth curving in a fond smile. “I’m giving you permission, Stevie.” His eyes darkened. “I really want you to kiss me like you mean it.”
Steve’s stupid mouth turned down. “Pity,” he said. Barnes started closing the door. “I would have said yes.”
“You’d be surprised,” Coulson said. “Many of the superhumans that I’ve been dealing with over the past few years have astonishing powers. That one of them could travel through time wouldn’t shock me at all.”
Tony loved that his newly acquired boo was being all grr-argh, but this really wasn’t the best way to get on Pepper’s good side.
She paused. “You can believe that he is afraid of what is coming, yes. So when he says he comes to seek our help, then he speaks the truth.” Her eyes went to Loki. “But trusting him isn’t something I would recommend. He lies as he breathes.”
Tony felt a little warm. “Yeah,” he nodded. “That’s a good thing.” He hoped that he could help Bruce. That the world would be kinder to him this time around.
“Huh?” If Tony had been straight then Natasha would have been at the top of his fuck me list. He liked a little, okay a
And as he walked into the room, seeing his friends, his family, turn to look at him, he thought that maybe, just maybe, he actually was.
Steve looked up at Tony. He was watching them, a look of such pure love on his face that it made Steve want to kiss him until he passed out.
Steve gave a helpless shiver.  Apart from Thor and Tony, in the suit, Bucky was the only person who could physically dominate him. He wondered what it said about him that the thought made his dick harder than steel.
Bucky laughed again and Steve felt such joy that it almost overwhelmed him. It seemed impossible that he was here like this with the two people who meant everything to him. But here they were, despite the impending end of the world.
Crowley gave a little smile, a proud father to Tony’s perfect pupil. “Indeed.” He waved a hand at the door behind him. “This is the last circle. The one before the entrance to the heart of my humble kingdom. It is the worst. I want you to be prepared because you already seem so uncomfortable with my methods of dealing with the souls of the damned.”
“She left as well,” Steve offered. “The movers came later that day and took all of her things.” He cocked his head observing Tony intently. “Bucky’s right. You’re not telling us the truth.” Steve folded his arms.
Steve’s eyes narrowed. “Why are you supporting him in this?” he asked Coulson. Tony held his breath. Coulson and Bruce were the only ones who knew why he was here, that he was here at all.
Steve reached up with his other hand and booped Tony on the nose. “Sorry, I forgot you were a manly man who mans in a manly way.”
Rhodey’s eyebrows climbed up over his fivehead. “Wounds?” He sounded disbelieving. “Steve told me that
For some reason, despite his deeply unusual presence, Tony got the gut feel that he was okay to trust. He held out his tablet. “It needs the Infinity Stone,” he said.
“Shut the fuck up, Banner.” Tony grabbed his arm. “It's like a Bandaid. Rip it off quickly and it hurts less.”
“We need someone to guide us there.” Sam didn’t look at Dean, and hoo-boy, Tony thought, there was a story in the tightening of Dean’s jaw.
“Tony?” Rhodey was sitting up too, Sam not far behind him. There was a brief, mad, juvenile scramble as they all tried to exit the Quinjet at the same time.
“Only ever as a pretence,” Tony assured her, hopping off the workbench and going over to her. “Will you stab me in the gut if I give you a hug?” he asked.
A bazillion apologies for the lateness of this update. I've had a nightmare of a January with big brothers and assorted relatives telling me how to live my life. For a while I wanted it to end.
“Would you have believed him?” The question had no true inflection, just remote curiosity. “Your default response to Mr. Stark has always had an element of antipathy. You disagreed with him about many things. You accepted that he didn’t want to return as Iron Man without much question.”
Tony frowned at him. “You can’t keep avoiding the subject,” he warned. “Sticking your fingers in your ears and singing doesn’t actually make the bad thing go away.”
“Just ‘cause I wear the stars and stripes doesn’t make me perfect,” Steve grinned as he swept his leg, dropping Clint to the mat like a stone. “You done?”
“We all put our pants on one leg at a time,” Tony said. He turned his head to see Bucky walking towards him. “Hey.”
“You are.” Steve was suddenly serious again. “You’ve given us more than you know.” He looked over to Bruce and Natasha. “Look at them.”
Bucky pressed a finger to his hole, pushing the slicked-up digit and curling it inside him so that it brushed a bundle of nerves that Steve hadn’t known existed. He would deny the noise he made until his dying day. He came hard, arching up into Bucky’s mouth and gasping into the warm cavern of Tony’s.
Bruce deals with the pesky brain bugs. Steve worries. Bucky is learning to trust. Tony meets Jörmungandr & he's not that scary. Really. I'm  not kidding.
“Holy fucking fuck!” Tony howled as the cool metal breeched him. It felt alien, smooth and with zero give. “Buck.” He wasn’t sure if he was telling him to stop or begging him to continue.
Tony flapped a hand around. “I’m not seeing a terminal here, am I?” He refused to think about that small slice in the fabric of the tree root that had appeared…
Bucky sighed. “I’m guessing it will eventually fade, but I’m conditioned to take orders. And when I don’t have them, I’m lost.”
Bucky frowned. “Seriously? You’re not fucking around with me?” he asked. The entire group shook their heads.
Steve flopped onto his back with a groan. Tony took a moment to admire all of that gorgeous pale flesh. He wanted to mark him in the worst way.
“It’s yours, you should open it,” Steve told him, pushing his hand gently back. “Odin doesn’t do anything without a purpose.”
google Avengers fan fiction, buddy. I don’t think you could handle the trauma.” Tony stopped abruptly. “Um.”
“If that happened, I’d murder someone just so that I could be with you.” Steve’s fierce tone took Tony by surprise. And to think he’d almost missed out on this.
Tony let Bucky go then, let him fall forward into Steve. Tony watched as Steve grabbed onto him, pulled him close and held him tight. “Jerk,” Steve breathed into Bucky's neck.
Steve choked out a laugh. “You’re so messed up, Buck. How do I know I can trust you not to hurt him?”
Tony stared into the mirror. He looked awful. Stress had clearly not been beneficial to his rakish good looks. “Where is everyone?” he asked.
It made something clench in Steve’s chest to know that Tony had made the kitchen such an important part of this home. It had been the informal gathering place for all of them back in the tower. The new base had never quite felt like a home, the way this place, after less than a day, did.
Tony groaned and Steve breathed a sigh of relief. “It sounds like he’s coming to.” He had a feeling he looked as frightened as Bucky did, white-faced and trembling.
“Hmm, so Thanos must have been pretty pissed off to have come so close to getting his hands on it.” Tony tapped a finger against his lips, thinking furiously.
When he’d first moved into the tower, he’d tried to read up on some of the things that Tony and Bruce did, tried to find a common ground. He’d figured out the basics, but with two resident geniuses trying to constantly one-up each other, the information was ancient by the time he tried to talk to them about what he’d read.
“You can give up the idea of the SRA right now, forget it ever existed and tell all of your friends that it’s dead in the water.” Tony paused.
“Huh.” Tony considered it, not looking down at his feet. “That’s something that could be pretty useful.”
“No.” Natasha shook her head. “Tony asked him not to reveal his current location.” Her lip curled. It was a little scary.
Pepper started laughing. She laughed so hard that she had to sit down. And carried on laughing. Tony was vaguely aggrieved. This wasn't a laughing matter. His life was officially out of control.
Tony closed his eyes, put a hand on Vision’s chest. “Yeah.” He felt the tears that had been building finally come. “It’s him. Welcome home, J.”
Thor beamed. “I am most delighted to hear this. But you must remain vigilant. The power of the Infinity Gauntlet will continue to pull at the Mind Stone.”
“Really?” Tony asked. “If I’d lost one of the most powerful objects in the universe, I wouldn’t be telling anyone about it.”
“Why” Steve didn’t understand politics. He certainly didn’t try to understand this century’s convoluted, incestuous mess of politics. Besides, that had always been someone else’s department. He was more mission-oriented. This, come to think of it, was probably why they were in the situation they were currently in.
“You know, for a smart guy, you don't speak so great.” Bucky's smile turned predatory. “It's kinda cute that I make you lose your words.”
“I’m more worried about what’s going to be waiting for us on the other side,” Sam admitted. “I can’t believe that Crowley or Lucifer haven’t clued in yet with all the commotion out here.”
Sam moved into Rhodey’s quarters, preferring to share the Spartan décor there. The training that Natasha and Steve had been giving them had paid off. They were already a team, close as brothers.
Fury raised his eyebrow. “Well, looks like your puppies are a little more obedient than when Stark was around.”
“Okay then, we’ll play it your way for now,” Bucky said. “Nothing happens until we talk to Steve and figure out what he wants?”
“That would not have worked.” Strange put a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Metal and magic do not generally function well together.”
He sighed. “So even Bruce is getting action now.” He plopped down onto the nearest stool. “I’m doomed to die alone.” He spun in a sad, pathetic circle.
“I’m sorry, but I’m not your boyfriend’s guard.” Natasha looked very unfriendly. “He’s your responsibility.”
Tony, Steve and Bucky hung out in the living room with Clint, waiting for the Winchesters while the others headed to the gym. Working out a little boredom by beating each other up wasn’t the worst way to pass the time.
Tony grinned down at him, willing his eyes to open. “Just so you know, you fainted like a girl in front of Captain America.” He was only vaguely aware of Natasha, Clint and Sam rushing in after Steve.
Tony swallowed hard, keeping his arms around him. “I’m sorry,” he said again. It was completely inadequate.
Tony beamed. “Oh, you are evil,” he chuckled. “I like you the best. This should be fun.” Clint grinned back at him. Totally his favorite.
“Part of the upload was a video file, also with Agent Romanoff’s signature,” JARVIS said. “I’ve sent it to monitor three.”
Steve & Bucky miss Tony. Tony makes a grand entrance. There is talking & then the soldiers take charge of their boyfriend.
Loki watched Bucky silently. Tony could feel Bucky’s hand growing sweaty against his. This felt like something important, Tony thought. A break-through of some sort.
Pepper sighed. “That boy is going to be the death of us all.” She crooked a finger at Tony. “We have something to show you.”
“Aw,” Pepper cooed, taking the paperwork from Tony. “That’s the sweetest thing you’ve ever said to me.”
“It means they’re discussing it with Tony,” Natasha explained. “It means that there’s a chance the ratified Accords may make it through.”
“Fury said that we could be something more together.” Steve kept his hand on Tony. “He was only talking to the two of us then.”
“And that’s it?” Clint glared at him. “All of it. Everything we’d been through together, and you just give the fuck up at the first hurdle?” He pointed at the screen. “Don’t think that any of what he’s doing right there is about anyone other than you,
“Tough?” Steve asked, hurrying to catch up to him, keeping one wary eye out for the invisible monster dog at Crowley’s side.
Well that sounded foreboding, Tony thought. It might mean that Jörmungandr wasn’t going to get away scot-free.
Tony elbowed him. “My brain is the most beautiful thing about me,” he snipped. Then paused, thinking. “Although my dick is a pretty close second.”
The kiss was gentle, at odds with the heated gaze and fever-damp skin. Steve was taken aback, but let Bucky take the lead.
Bucky handed the knife to Natasha. “You dropped it.” His smile was a little mean and Steve wanted to kick his ass.
“It’s because you’ve spent half your life lying to everyone you meet,” Steve told him. He let Tony go and the loss felt was immediate.
She looked up, more color in her face now and a tiny smirk on her lips. “It’s your charming personality, Mr. Stark. It inspires people.”
Tony’s shoulders slumped. That wasn’t supposed to have slipped out. “That was supposed to have been silent,” he muttered.
“Really?” Bruce asked with a desperate pitch in his voice. “You’re in a romantic three-way relationship with two old-age pensioners who could bench-press a plane; and Wanda and Vision being a couple is the weirdest thing?”
The bitch of it was that he was being completely sincere. Steve had seen humanity as a whole and wanted to fix it. Instead, thanks to Tony, they’d almost broken it beyond compare.
“Peter Quill and the Guardians were not able to control the Power Stone for long though,” Loki pointed out.
Steve still didn’t understand. “Why Tony?” It was the question he’d wanted answered since he’d heard Bucky’s voice.
“Let’s just say, I got a feeling,” Steve said. He met Pietro’s gaze. “I know you’ve both had a rough start in life, but I won’t let you hurt the people I love. Got it?”
He stared blearily into the mirror. He looked a lot less haggard than he’d been expecting. Clearly that old adage about sleep being good for the complexion was true.
Tony gulped. “Or you could ride with me and Vision can carry Bruce,” he offered. “Once you ride me, you’ll never….” He trailed off. “Yeah, that didn’t go in the direction I was hoping,” he admitted.
Tony frowned. “That’s not okay,” he said, glaring at Crowley. “We cleaned up your mess and that’s how you repay us? By betraying us?”
It made Steve think of Tony leaning over to him during one of the many endless post assignment debriefings and whispering, “Which eyebrow do you think is the most dangerous? The left or the right?” Steve had spluttered out a laugh that he’d tried to disguise as a cough, but Natasha’s cool gaze pinned him. She knew. “The left,” Tony had decided. “Definitely the left.”
The crack of thunder had everyone jumping. Thor, Wanda and Vision appeared in the golden stream of the Bifröst. “Friends!” Thor boomed. “We are all together once more! We have vanquished our foes! It is time for revelry!”
“If you have to choose, not between your brother and your child, but between your ambition and the world, promise me that you’ll choose the world that Thor loves beyond his own.” Tony watched Loki’s gaze flick towards Thor.
Tony backed up into Vision’s chest. “No. If you had trusted me. Told me what you’d found out, what Hydra had done to him, do you think there would have been
Thor finally got the joke. “Ah, you’re amused because you think I’m referring to my manhood as my hammer.” He beamed at them all. “I’m sure Jane would be the better person to ask.”
Fury shrugged, hands deep in the pockets of his stupid long black leather jacket. “You’ll never know.”
“And then he isn’t,” Pepper said with a smile as she led the way to her office. “Shall we debrief now so that you can go and hover over him?”
“They want to register us?” Bruce whispered. Tony forgot how smart Bruce was sometimes. That mild-mannered exterior hid a mind like a blade.
“Bruce, Vision and I are your best bet to save your world and ours,” Tony said. “But we can’t go any faster or we’ll burn out.”
“Who’s coming?” Tony asked, side-stepping Steve’s observation. He did that a lot. Steve wasn’t going to let it slide for too much longer. Tony needed to talk. Even if it was just to him.
Pepper stood in the middle of the expansive living area, tapping her extremely expensive pointy-toed shoe. “Really, Tony? Really?”
Clint made no effort to hide his laughter. “Outed by your girlfriend, Cap?” he snorted. He fell off the edge of the desk he was perched on with a yelp. Steve didn’t know who had pushed him but from the innocent expression on her face, he assumed it was Pepper.
Bucky cocked a hip against Tony’s workbench, a subtle alliance with him. “Let’s not forget the assassinations, mass murder and general destruction.”
“And I could not tell you in words how grateful I am.” He tried to smile at Tony but it felt wrong on his face. “I lost my mind when I thought that last link would be taken away from me.” He laughed then, the bitterness in his voice a palpable thing. “Captain America isn’t supposed to lose control. Captain America is supposed to make the right choices. Captain America isn’t allowed to make mistakes.” He spat the words out like nails.
But Steve didn’t care. He walked towards Tony, fists clenched. “Is it you?” he asked, voice scratched and throat raw.
“Captain America is the defacto leader of the Avengers. Him being associated in any way with you, apart from as a team-mate, is likely to tarnish his image in the eyes of the American people…” Fury was working up a head of steam.
“Too bad,” Steve croaked. “You’re not always the best person to decide what’s good for you.” He wanted to put his hands on Tony. He dug his fingers into the muscles in his own arms instead.
“Fight with the Hulk?” Tony wondered if he was actually in an alternate universe. “Steve, I fucking watched you die over a month ago.”
“Let’s go then. I’d like to get back to my friend as quickly as possible.” Rhodes stepped out of the elevator onto the roof, keeping a brisk pace.
Bucky rolled his eyes and wiped his stomach with the edge of the sheet nearest him. “Your head gets any bigger, we’ll have to build it a room,” he said. He lay down on Tony’s other side, draping his arm across Tony’s chest.
Steve instructed Clint to land the Quinjet on the White House lawn. It wasn’t as though Loki didn’t know they were coming.
“The ritual is pretty similar to summoning a demon,” Sam said, going back to crushing herbs with the pestle and mortar. “I assume that this is the route we’re going to go?”  He looked around the room at them and at Steve’s nod, got busy.
“I knew about Barnes,” Tony said. “I told you, I knew that you and Wilson and Natasha were hiding something. I’m the world’s most nosy human being, so of course I went trawling through the mountains of intel that Widow posted on the internet. Thank god I got to most of it before our enemies did.”
“You’re going to love this,” Tony said, forgetting for a moment that he hated Steve. “It’s in a necklace protected by a bunch of wizards.”
Tony glanced down and saw the mess of come striping Bucky’s belly and chest. He beamed. “Damn, I’m good. I didn’t even have to touch you.”
Natasha put a hand on Thor’s arm. “Dear friend, we have experienced many things in this universe that are both improbable and impossible. Why would this not be such a thing?”
“I’m not going to force you to come back,” Tony assured Bruce. “But I’ll be really happy if you do.”
Steve’s eyes flew open, only to see Bucky looking up at the camera in the road before riding away. “Yeah,” he grated, “That’s Buck.”
“So, what you’re telling us is that this snake, Jörmungandr, has escaped and wants to kill the gods of Asgard?” Steve could sum up things in such a way that it made Tony feel stupid. It’s why Steve was in charge. He saw the whole picture, not just the part that was in front of him.
Steve was at his side in a flash, coffee forgotten. “Buck!” He ran a hand over Bucky’s forehead, pushing the hair back. “How are you feeling?”
He walked over to touch Tony’s cheek. His skin was cool and a slightly alarming tinge of blue. “I’ll do anything to save him, Pepper. I don’t care what it is. Anything.”
Tony had to satisfy himself with a hard glare at Loki. “So, going over what we know, we can’t use the Space Stone or the Mind Stone.”
Tony could see his life flashing past him behind his eyelids. Groveling was expected apparently. “Pepper and I broke up,” he blurted. He would try distractions and bids for sympathy first.
he understood, the simple exchange on a battlefield between warriors. Feelings had always been way harder for him.
The epic eyeroll he got in return made him grin. “Your modesty is your most enduring quality,” Bruce said.
Tony slumped back against the sofa. “I’m messing everything up,” he whined, scrubbing at his face. “He didn’t give me any guidelines.”
“I’m flying blind here,” he said as he made his way to the chair. “I have no idea what I’m supposed to do.”
Natasha and Clint walked up to them. “We’re ready.” Sam, Scott and Wanda had already boarded the jet.
Thor swallowed hard. “According to Heimdall, Asgard will be swallowed up within a few days.” Loki looked like he wanted to vomit.
“We have a talking hawk,” Bruce affirmed from his side of the lab. “Not the craziest thing we’ve encountered.”
looked at him. He appeared smaller, damaged somehow. Steve had done that. Not all of it, but he was definitely responsible for some of the blame. “I’m sorry, Tony.”
““Only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile.”” Bruce watched Vision with a devastation in his face that hurt Tony to look at. “Albert Einstein knew what he was talking about.”
Tony wasn’t even aware of him anymore. He was brain-deep in the most beautiful equation he’d ever seen in his life.
Steve nodded. “The past couple of days have clearly been an education in not jumping to conclusions for me.”
Steve toweled himself dry, mind racing. “I was always taught that revenge is a dish best served cold,” he mused, shivering a little. “I think I’ll let Tony stew for a while. Let him worry.”
Steve carried on pulling his clothes off, as casually as you please. “I’ve been training with the team. Think I could do with a shower,” he said, stepping into the shower with Tony.
Steve nodded, slightly startled at the change of subject. “Yeah, sorry about that, by the way. Totally out of line.” He’d just been another in a long line of assholes, who’d done things to Bucky, taken things without his consent.
The elevator pinged open and Rhodey rushed out followed by Clint, Bruce and Natasha. “Tony!” Rhodey skidded to a halt when he saw that Tony was awake. “F.R.I.D.A.Y. said…”
“This isn’t anything we signed up for,” Tony agreed. “But neither were the Chithauri or Loki or Ultron.” He swallowed hard. “Although, actually, Ultron was one hundred percent my fuck-up.”
Tony looked across the dance floor to where Bucky had cut in on Steve and Wanda. Steve was grinning at Bucky as he was twirled across the floor. “I’m the product of my upbringing,” he said over a lump in his throat. “Everyone thinks I should be happy because I’m so rich or smart or handsome.” Rhodey snorted.
“Tony.” Pepper’s voice was arctic. “If you don’t come out of there I will tell everybody about Budapest.”
“He likes to pretend he knows everything,” Tony told them in a stage whisper. “Most likely he just got a run-down when you arrived here. He hates surprises.” He grinned when Fury glowered at him. It was the little things really that made life worth living.
to talk to us.” Steve wanted Tony to stop and think, just for one moment, that the blame for the mess they were in didn’t rest entirely on Steve’s shoulders. “I’m not saying I want a get out of jail free card. I
Bruce gestured towards the kitchen. “Knock yourself out,” he said. She headed to the kitchen without another word. Vision hovered a little uncertainly, before he settled against the bar.
Tony grinned. “I’ll never tell.” He shook Sam’s hand. “Good luck with keeping this one out of trouble,” he said, tilting his head towards Dean.
Steve spoke up, “It’s why I never said anything. You seemed happy together.” He sighed. “I thought you’d realize you made a mistake and ask her to take you back. Buck told me to take my chance.”
“Hello boys.” The mellifluous voice had them all spinning back towards the gateway to Hell. The guy in the expensive suit and Burberry coat looked nothing like Tony’s expectation of a demon from Hell.
“I know.”  Her eyes softened to only mildly homicidal. “I’m sorry, but if we’re brutally honest, nobody was expecting it to last.”
Tony scowled at her. “I’m cancelling your access to Steve.” He pointed an accusing finger at her. “Far too sassy.”
Bucky suddenly shoved Steve away, rolling back and up to his feet. “You keep your fucking mouth shut, Rogers.” His voice shook.
Bucky bit his lip as punishment. It made Steve shudder. “That’s not nice, Stevie,” Bucky remonstrated, sliding his hand around Steve’s waist and under his jeans. Steve widened his stance, enjoying the hitch in Tony’s breath as his cock pressed against Tony’s ass.
Tony rubbed his eyes and looked around the house. He’d told Steve that it was time to hang up the suit, to pass the baton, to stop trying to save the world.
Bucky hauled Tony to his feet and Steve did the same with Clint. “You are a trial, Stark,” Bucky said with a smile.
Steve’s smile was something to see, soft, tender and literal hearts in his eyes. “You don’t get enough sleep,” he said. “No way I was waking you up.”
“Meh,” Tony tried to shrug, but Bucky’s bulk held him down. “I’m a selfish, petty man. There are many things I will tolerate in the quest for great sex.”
and the hair on my arms stood up and I knew that it must be something happening here and….” Peter took a breath. “Viz?” The kid stared at Vision’s body, eyes wide with shock. “What’s going on?”
Tony’s brain clicked back on and ran over the past couple of seconds. “Oops,” he said, sending an apologetic look towards Pepper who was red, either with embarrassment or rage. Neither option boded well for him.
Tony held up his hands. “Fine. I swear, I’m pure as the driven, innocent as the proverbial.” He scooted around the other side of the workbench just in case though.
Steve sighed. “I don’t know why I bother talking to you,” he mumbled. “You already know all the answers.”
He jumped out of the ring, ignoring Clint’s mutter of, “show-off,” as he headed towards her. “Tasha, what’s up?”
“He’s a comic book character back on Earth,” Steve explained. Natasha’s normally blank face went ever blanker. “Oh, I’m sorry, Natasha. A comic book is a small illustrated book that tells stories.” He clamped his lips together. “In the comic books, Iron Man is a man who invents a special metal suit of armor that he uses to help people and destroy Earth’s enemies.”
Tony watched in wonder. Bruce was always so careful, so in control. It was a special privilege to see him just relax and laugh his ass off.
say anything?” The sheer rage that emanated from Pepper was extraordinary. Steve was more than a little afraid.
“Well that’s good news, right?” Tony looked around the room. He hated being the only one who didn’t know what was going on. Well, Bruce was also clueless, but then that tended to be Bruce’s default.
“So, I’ve read the revised Accords and I’ll sign them,” Bucky said. “I agree to the terms of my rehabilitation. Tony Stark will have complete access to my memories using the B.A.R.F. technology and if necessary I will go back under cryogenic suspension again.” He looked at Steve. “That covers my shit. Now, no more excuses, Stevie, Stark. I’m not going to be the reason any of you lose your family.”
“Why?” Tony whined. “He’s just going to say no to me. It should be one of you manly men types. He respects the power of testosterone.”
Steve had thought he was used to Tony’s lack of brain-to-mouth filter. A white haze filled his mind as Tony’s clever, clever fingers made short work of his belt and zipper.
Barnes just stared at him until Tony surged forward, grabbing onto him, afraid he’d disappear again. “Please. Come in.” Tony waited, holding his breath until Barnes took that one step towards him.
Steve shrugged, his body loose and languid. “It’s been fucking forever, you asshole. It’s a miracle I lasted for more than a second.”
know. He knew what it felt like to be afraid of what you could do to other people. He just happened to use his words to hurt. Bruce had a whole other person to take care of things. “But I miss you. Your friends miss you. All you're doing here is hiding.”
Tony watched Steve’s jaw set. He groaned. Steve was in his ‘I’m not backing down’ mode. It never ended well. “We’re here to stop Set from escaping the Cage. That’s all.” He sent a warning glance to Steve.
“What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool. It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.” He could hear the defensiveness and fucking hell, he wasn’t the one in the wrong here. He
It never failed to amaze Tony that all it took to immobilize someone was the power of Xavier’s mind. Richards moved away, still keeping within grabbing distance of Ross. Tony approved. He’d always been a slippery sonofabitch.
Dean moved so that Sam’s head fell on his shoulder. “He’s not coming anywhere near you, Sammy. No fucking way.” Tony wondered if they were even aware they weren’t alone.
He started shaking. How the hell had he forgotten that? He realized quickly that this was what Uatu had meant. He needed to start keeping a record of his memories. Not only so that he didn’t fuck up again.
Steve and Tony sat at the conference table back at the compound. It was twenty-three days later, and there was a hush over the world as everyone struggled to take in what had happened.
“Yes, he used an experimental miniature gamma radiation emitter.” F.R.I.D.A.Y. clearly didn’t approve.
“Thanks.” Tony was clearly going to have to do some major damage control. “I’m going to just…” He waved vaguely back at the house.
“One day you’re going to get us all kicked out of here,” Bruce said as he stepped onto Tony’s creation with a wet squelch.
She looked around the jet. “Forgive me if I don’t say welcome home, but it’s against my better judgment that Tony brought you all here and it looks like I was right.”
“Steve.” He rolled to his back, stared up at the aluminium and chrome roof trusses that Clint loved to perch in. Fuck. This hurt like a motherfucker, he thought.
Thor shook his head. “The Collector can move between universes,” he said with an apologetic look. “He has no concern for this one.”
Clint stuck his head out of the kitchen. “Most women, and probably half of the men on the planet, would be all too happy with that sort of abuse.” He flinched. “God, you’ve broken my brain. I hate you all.” He vanished again as Tony cackled.
Strange unbuttoned his cloak, allowing it to wander off to poke around the room. Tony could see the expressions on the faces of everyone who had not yet experienced the special wonder that was Stephen Strange. “I still have the Eye of Agamotto.” He made a flourishing gesture at the pendant on his chest, ensuring that everyone was staring at him.
“Then why is it acceptable for weapons in human form to be used without regulation?” T’Challa asked.
Rhodes snorted a laugh. “Yeah, good proviso to keep in there.” He sobered, moving away from the cabinet. He stepped towards Steve, the swish-shush of the exo-skeleton a constant reminder of the battle that had been forced on them all. “Give him time.”
“A responsibility to the world.” Strange’s cloak slipped off his shoulders and slithered over to Tony. It stroked his arm, almost in apology. “I’m truly sorry for your loss, Tony.”
The single road was dusty, skinny children and skinnier dogs raced around, laughing and barking. It was a picture of happy poverty. It looked like the perfect place for a self-loathing, gamma-radiated, nuclear physicist with anger issues.
Thor took Loki and the Tesseract back to Asgard, along with Steve’s warnings about Thanos. The god had promised to speak to his father, Odin, to ask if he could see a future where Thanos still won. Steve prayed that he’d done enough to stop the mad Titan.
The projection snapped off, Vision stepped back to his position at Tony’s shoulder and not a sound was heard in the room.
Tony stumbled as he ran, doubled over, wheezing with laughter. “Not exactly, LeeLoo,” he said as he held Vision in front of him like a shield.
But Tony’s quip had done its job and people were chuckling, murmuring to one another after what they had seen.
Thor strode in. “I must return to my brothers in New Asgard,” he declared. “As their king I must help them grow more comfortable with mortal things.”
Tony started Googling ‘serpent crown’ while Bruce and Wanda had their stand-off. Sometimes he thought that Bruce just liked being contrary.
“Again,” Tony sighed. “It’s getting tiresome. We should just let them have it.” He slumped back into his seat.
“Oh, that was just the Bifröst,” Tony said with an airy wave. “Thor had Heimdall on standby for us.”
“It’s good to be seen,” Coulson replied, and then went red when his companions stared at him. “I mean….” He trailed off helplessly.
Tony nodded, his mind racing. “It actually makes more sense with an actual being in the equation. The wall isn’t a thing, but it can be broken. I assume that Loki’s kid has powers that we don’t understand?” He cocked an eyebrow at Loki.
He turned on his heel, leaving Steve to his thoughts. Everything was so messed up. Steve hadn’t realized just how much of the burden of leadership Tony had shared. Those broad shoulders had helped Steve to bear a load that felt overwhelming to him right now.
Bucky put a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “I’d prefer it be the both of you, but if I had to choose, right now, Tony would be the one I’d turn to.”
Maybe he was a little tired. Still wasn't going to admit it to the one-armed asshole who was grinning at him.
He tried not to jump when Natasha appeared beside him. He’d learned that she was a shadow when she wanted to be. “Who is this Iron Man that Tony speaks of?” she asked.
“I don't deserve another chance.” Bruce sounded miserable. Tony wanted to wrap him in clouds and protect him forever. God, where had this sentimental streak come from? He was blaming it all on Bucky.
“Instructions from Director Fury were need-to-know only.” Coulson was Tony’s unexpected savior. “Tony wasn’t allowed to talk about it.”
“I’m not hungry,” Tony insisted, bottom lip jutting out in a pout that shouldn’t be adorable on a man of his age, even as he took a huge bite out of one half.
“Okay boys, you can open your eyes,” he told Steve and Bucky, keeping his voice low for some as yet unnamed reason. It seemed like the thing to do in a place like this.
Tony watched the smile soften and those blue eyes fill with an emotion that never ceased to amaze him. Somehow, Tony had done something that made Steve love him. He wished he knew what it was so that he could always keep doing it.
“It wasn't...the naked...I mean...” Bruce's fumbling attempts to explain Tony's outburst were adorably hilarious.
They battled their way to where they’d emerged. Steve headed in first, with Bucky at his heels. Tony took the rear, walking backwards as he shot at whatever tried to follow them. “By the way, apparently Crowley is going to double-cross us,” he yelled as he stumbled against Bucky under the weight of a rock monster.
“It's not safe for me to be out there.” Bruce held up a hand. “I'm not coming back. Nothing you can say will change my mind.”
“He’s built like a god,” Tony pointed out. “He could actually date three people at the same time and all three would be grateful for his attention.”
Tony burped. “Bloody Mary without the booze,” he said, tipping his glass towards Bruce. “I’ve not had anything to drink since I got here.”
Sam took a hooked talon in his shoulder, grunting in pain when Dean lopped off the claw and blew the bird-thing’s head off. “Don’t. Touch. Sammy.” He gritted the words like a warning. It seemed to be heard as the hoard backed off Sam a little, focusing on the rest of them.
Tony felt the bile in his throat and forced it down. “That is remarkably awful.” The words weren’t anywhere near sufficient. No-one, even someone he had as little respect for as Loki, deserved to have his choices taken away from him like that.
“I think perhaps peace is a better option than something big enough for the Avengers to attend to, don’t you?” T’Challa’s tone was quietly remonstrating.
“Because I remember being helpless, at the mercy of assholes who hold your life in your hand,” Tony said, slotting the AI microchip into the wrist. He looked up into Jim’s eyes. “I know your nightmares.”
my suit on?” Tony asked. At Strange’s nod, Tony shrugged. “Okay, I’m not going to ask anymore, but it’s going to look stupid.”
Steve was silent for so long that Tony had given up hope. “Fine,” he said eventually. “Tony, you go in first, Thor, Vision, you’re backup in case Loki plans on doing more damage.” Tony literally felt his jaw drop. Steve was actually giving him a chance to prove himself?
Steve forgot about how he was feeling as he hauled Bucky into his arms. They sat there on the cold floor of Tony Stark’s bathroom as Bucky wept into Steve’s neck.
Tony wasn’t sure, right until that moment, what the sound was that a heart made as it broke. “So was I.”
Steve turned onto his side and curled into Tony, dropping his arm on top of Bucky’s. Tony made a point of making a noise. Because they were heavy fucking arms, okay?
Steve knew suddenly. He closed his eyes. “Howard and Maria were assassinated by the Winter Soldier.” It wasn’t a question.
Steve started looking interested. Tony couldn’t have this. “I didn’t run away,” he insisted. “Pepper asked me to leave so I did.”
“Yeah, LeeLoo, I get them when I’m too emotional.” Tony never talked down to them. He treated them with the respect their sharp young minds deserved.
“He’s home.” It was a simple enough statement, but Steve could relate. He could see Tony’s pleased smile, even as he ducked his head to Bucky’s arm again.
“You’d have pushed.” It didn’t sound like an accusation from Tony, but Steve took it that way anyway.
He opened his mouth to beg Bucky to stop but Tony’s clever tongue was inside before he could get a sound out.
Steve didn’t blame Clint or Natasha for pulling a gun on him. Their experience with the Replicators had made them suspicious of any sort of miraculous healing.
“Bruce.” Tony grinned, a proper smile this time. “Actually it was the Hulk. He caught me. Shouted me back into consciousness. Then we ate shawarma.”
“We’ll have to get this show on the road quickly.” Tony stared down at his tablet. “The longer it takes, the harder it’s going to be to reverse the effects of Jörmungandr’s magic.”
“I am merely the secretary,” she said, the steel in her eyes telling Tony everything he needed to know.
Bucky’s eyes were finally clear of that sorrow. “You’re a special snowflake, Stark.” His mouth quirked a little.
“Bucky likes you. He needs someone like you in his life.” Well, that wasn’t what Tony had been expecting. He could feel the confusion sliding across his face at Steve’s words.
“While you were downstairs trying to find your big girl panties, the Winchesters were filling us in on demonology.” Clint’s smile was sharp. “Shit is going down.”
He stepped off the elevator and headed into the lab. “No admittance, F.R.I.D.A.Y.” He paused as the bulletproof glass doors eased closed. “And that includes Ms. Potts and Captain Rogers. Is that understood?”
Tony shook his head. “I forgot what an utter troll you are, Steven. It makes me tear up a little.” He hauled Steve towards his quarters, slightly terrified that Steve would change his mind and everything would go pear-shaped yet again.
This last chapter was tough to write. I have many unresolved issues. Thank you for staying with me to the end.
Tony looked up at him. “Get help. Right. The fuck. Now.” His hands were wet. He didn’t want to look at them, refused to acknowledge that this was Steve’s blood running over his hands.
Clint looked between them. “I’ll stay with Tony,” he said. “What?” His shoulders hunched up defensively when they all looked at him. “I actually
And started laughing when Coulson went white with shock, and then pink with delighted recognition. “Captain America?”
“Nope.” Tony headed into his workshop, relieved to see the suit ready. “I’ll talk to you later.” He pointed between them. “And whatever that shit was about, sort it out.” He saw the bruises around Steve’s neck fading already.
“They used to drink it to heal them, to give them longevity,” Bruce mused, eyes narrowed as he stared at Tony. “Are you trying to say…?”
Bruce stared down at him. “You met Natasha, right?” At Tony’s nod he continued, “She has qualifications in most martial arts and several fighting styles that I’ve never heard of. Plus she’s exceptionally good with weapons.”
“I’ve heard that Reed Richards is looking for a few more to add to his crew,” Rhodey said, ignoring Tony’s angry sputter. “I bet he won’t get pissy when I need armor upgrades.”
Jarvis sniffed. “I don’t intend on being a bottom-feeder forever, Tony.” He looked at Pepper. “Don’t you think ‘The Vision’ carries a certain gravitas?”
Tony nodded. “Okay then, so long, Doc. You know where to find me whenever you’re ready.” He let the faceplate slide over his face. “Actually, I’m not in New York anymore. You’re welcome at my place in Malibu, though.” He took a step back.
Steve rubbed his eyes. “Tony, that’s alone. And you know it.” He waved at Natasha, indicating that he was going to take this outside. She gave him a small smile and a thumbs up.
I appreciate the discussion in the comments section - it shows that y'all are thinking about what I write which is truly appreciated. Note I have not added tags for specific reasons. Yes, trigger issues like PTSD & anxiety attacks for sure, but I think I've been pretty clear from chapter 1 that I am on Team Iron Man. Don't like? Don't read.
He felt he owed Tony at least this much. Looking at Bucky, he probably owed Tony one hell of a lot more.
“Oh, there they are.” Bucky waved an arm and Tony turned to see Natasha, Clint and the Winchesters hurrying towards them.
Tony stepped back, overwhelmed with the affection that was rolling though him. “Got tired of seeing your ugly mug,” he quipped. “Besides, weren’t you playing at being Old MacDonald on his farm?”
Tony moved back to his spot on the other side of Bucky with a groan. “God, my knees are killing me.”
Steve cupped Bucky’s face. “You were and always have been, my best friend. Nothing will ever change that.”
“Okay, that sounds plausible.” Steve acknowledged. He tapped his chin. “What would we do with it though?”
And Bruce’s face reminded Tony just how much he’d fucked up. “I need you to do something for me, okay?” He grabbed Bruce’s face between his palms. “Promise?”
crowded for Tony’s comfort and he needed to get out of here before the inevitable panic attack set in.
“My brother’s freedom is at stake as is the salvation of my realm,” Thor said. “I will return as soon as the Infinity gem is within my grasp.”
He fell into his chair. “So Bucky Barnes is alive,” he mused. “No wonder Cap went off the reservation.”
Tony frowned. “Why?” he asked. “There’s not much out there.” He glared at Steve. “In fact, I think it may make you feel even worse about what happened.”
“I’ll fucking kill him!” The scream that cut through his mental fog had Tony spinning around in time to have Bucky smash his fist into his face. “What did you do with him?” Tony could recognize the fear in Bucky’s face. He relished the pain from the punch.
the wire then. It needs to be cut. And as soon as possible.” Vision looked at Thor. “Will you be able to destroy the Mind Stone, Thor Odinson?”
“I don’t think that word means what you think it means,” Clint said. Steve didn’t think that quoting the Princess Bride was entirely appropriate right now.
ready for this date. So Pepper and Natasha take him in hand. No, not that way! Ugh, you guys are filthy.
“The stones,” Tony said. “It’s all about the stones.” He paced the laboratory like a caged animal, muttering under his breath.
“Goddamit,” Tony snarled. “I swear I’m going to reprogram that AI so that all she can do is toast bread and brew coffee.”
“I’ll tell you everything when I get back to the tower,” Tony assured him. “I’ve just got one more stop to make before I come home.”
“Bucky. Buck. Bucky.” Steve repeated Bucky’s name in a desperate refrain as he kissed him, poured every bit of love and loss and adoration into the kiss that he could.
Steve knew from experience that he would get nothing more from him. “How are your doctors doing with Bucky?” he asked instead, changing the subject. Saving Bucky had been the only good thing about this entire god-awful situation. And even then, he was locked away in ice now, a prisoner of his own mind.
Tony flapped a hand at Steve. “Shoo,” he muttered, dropping his head against Bucky’s shoulder. “Wake me up when the three lost lambs get back.”
Tony sighed and plopped down into the waiting wheelchair, trying to hide the momentary grimace of pain. “Fine.” He gave a jaunty salute to NurseZilla and pointed at the door. “Right, Potts. Mush!”
“I’m not saying I know what the heck you’re talking about,” Steve said, keeping his voice even. “But whatever you did before, this time you’ve got back-up.” His mouth was firm.
Steve leaned forward until all Tony could see were those cobalt eyes. “Don’t die yet,” he murmured. “I have plans for you.”
The other four came through the bay doors about half a minute later. “What’s up?” Clint asked, looking between them.
“I love you.” Steve stopped moving. So did Tony. “I’ve loved you for years. Since the moment I saw you falling out of that huge hole in the sky just prove that you weren’t a little man in a metal suit.”
Thor nodded his agreement. “He is in a space-faring vessel that orbits your planet. It will be difficult to approach with stealth.”
Sam's quicksilver smile was his reward as he hurled himself out of the Quinjet. Apparently whatever new tech Tony had kitted Falcon out with was more than a match to keep up with War Machine.
That considering gaze made Steve feel a little worried. It usually meant something ill-considered and or crazy. “What kind of experiments?” he asked.
Tony didn’t flinch. “I can separate the man from the Asset, Rogers. It took me some time, but I got what you were trying to tell me about him. As the Winter Soldier, he had no choices. He obeyed no matter what. He’s not someone I want in my life.”
Only as he walked back to the stove did Tony realize that Steve was wearing an exceptionally frilly apron. “Oh my god,” he crowed. “You
Pepper married Happy. Steve had a moment of regret, for taking Tony from her. But then he thought of what she, a human, had been through, and rationalized that he’d made the right choices. Happy was safe. And he wasn’t Tony.
Rhodey grimaced. “While I’m pretty happy about not having to fight an immortal space guy for the stone, how do you know this Collector is just going to hand it over without any conditions?”
Tony pushed the door open and looked down the very narrow corridor. “Does this look like the set of a horror movie, or is that just me?”
Tony rounded a corner, and threw a door open. It was a laboratory. Bruce and Vision looked up at him. “I know what we have to do!” Tony declared, sweeping his arms open wide.
“Gotcha!” he crowed, the watery grave of the Quinjet coming into view. “Now to work out where the Other Guy went.”
Tony expected to feel uncomfortable. But with Bruce warming one side and Bucky warming the other, he felt pretty comfortable. He'd even put the suit away, agreeing to fly in the jet with the team. Bonding exercise.
“Steve.” Bucky's whisper had Steve tense up. Bucky was lying in front of him, not yet sure enough of Sam and Rhodey to let them lie at his back. Steve had been pathetically grateful for Bucky’s show of trust.
Tony didn’t really want to talk to anyone. He wanted to run up the stairs and present Barnes with his new arm. But he’d promised Pepper that he would stop avoiding the world. “Sure,” he replied.
Bucky stood too. “I could do with a little down-time,” he admitted. “Places to go, people to do.” He grinned at Steve’s quelling glare.
“What plan?” Bruce and Rhodey wandered in, Natasha at their heels. She looked exhausted. They all were.
“You’re my friend and I didn’t think about you and I’m a fuckup.” Tony thought that about covered it. Her smothered laugh told him he’d got it right.
“Playroom?” Sam’s ears pricked up because he was an asshole. “You got something to share with us, Stark?” Hi waggled his eyebrows. “I bet you read “Fifty Shades” and decided you needed your own Red Room.”
Tony sat down carefully, hoping that the chair didn’t collapse beneath the weight of the suit, because landing on his ass in front of Loki would be
Tony stepped in front of his wildly waving arms. “It’s okay to be pissed,” he said, keeping his voice level. “But sometimes we have to make the hard choices.”
He felt the panic attack take over, bright lights flashing behind his eyelids as his breathing grew short. “F.R.I.D.A.Y. call Bruce,” he croaked as he fought the darkness.
Bruce rubbed his eyes. “I’m getting there,” he said. “Vision has been an invaluable source. I just need to get an hour of sleep or something.”
“Can you escort my team and I to the Situation Room please, Colonel?” Steve requested, deciding to be the bigger person and not glare at Natasha.
Steve felt a little sick. “Okay.” So. Bucky and Tony. Steve would deal with this new development later. When he could close his door and scream into his pillow. Or maybe destroy a couple of punching bags.
Steve felt like he was about five years old again and being told off by his ma. “I’m sorry,” he said. “That was very rude.”
“You’re calling me nuts? I’m rebooting you tomorrow,” Tony threatened, throwing the screwdriver down with a growl. “What is on my schedule tonight?”
Bruce held up his hands. “I’m sorry; I didn’t mean to startle you. I need to remember that you’re probably suffering from more than one type of PTSD.” He spoke so matter-of-factly, letting Bucky know that he understood and didn’t find anything wrong with him.
“We’re still facing charges,” Natasha said, obviously choosing her words carefully. “Tony may have amended the Accords and the UN may agree to them, but there is no way we walk back home without facing
“Bruce has an unfortunate green problem, and Vision is carrying the Mind Stone. Who knows what could happen,” Tony explained. “There’s no-one else.”
Steve, while amused at his team’s antics, was still wondering what had woken him. Bucky leaned into him. “What was it?” he murmured, obviously thinking about it as well.
“I’m sure we can manage to help you with that,” Steve said, a small smile on his face once more. He loved Tony’s face, smirking and wicked and so very beloved.
Atlantis was getting impatient, the flashes pulsing faster and faster. Clint glared. “Slow down, lady. Puny human here.”
“Come to Papa, Sugarlump.” Tony crooked his finger at him. “If you can make it here then I will offer said ass for you to kick.”
“Why did you ask about your S.H.I.E.L.D. file?” Tony stroked his hand over Bucky’s hair, wondering how their conversation had taken this turn.
“If we get out of here, it’s on,” Tony agreed. He kept his eyes peeled, but there was no movement in the trees, not a leaf or branch shifted. Not even the ground beneath them crackled under their feet. “I seriously don’t like this place,” he told Dean.
Tony was feeling giddy with relief. He’d done it. Made it home in mostly one piece and saved the universe at the same time.
“Thor Odinson will be there?” he asked, slightly breathless as Atlantis once again eased Steve’s way.
Steve dropped an arm over Tony’s shoulder, still cautious but clearly more comfortable. Tony snugged in. “Please ignore the drama queen,” Steve told Bucky. “He gets like this when he’s been too long without food or sleep.”
“Are you malfunctioning?” Tony demanded. “I think you need to reboot your servers.” His hands were shaking.
Natasha looked over at Tony. “Well, he's a stubborn son of a bitch, I'll give him that.” Her eyes were fonder, thank god. “If anyone can help you, then he can.”
“Brothers!” Thor boomed as he strode in, cloak billowing behind him and Mjolnir hanging from his wrist. “I bid you welcome.”
“That is not your decision to make, Tony.” Vision’s calm eyes met Tony’s as he dropped his arm. “I am not human, my absence will not be felt.”
Tony’s eyes went wide at the thought of insulting his friend. “Jim. No. I …” He glared when he saw Rhodey’s shoulders shaking. “You are an asshole.” But his chest didn’t hurt anymore. “I hate you.”
“Is there any reason your brother would have taken refuge in the form of a female feline animal?” Natasha asked Thor.
Tony met his gaze. “Correct.” He braced himself. “What isn’t known is that she was acting on Intel that I’d amassed about the high-security prison known as the RAFT.”
He was just breathing really fast because he’d run down the stairs (and locked himself into his workshop).
“I don’t believe in Heaven,” Tony whispered to Steve. “But if you’re out there somewhere across the great divide, I’d really appreciate a sign.”
“She’s still talking to you?” Steve asked and suddenly everyone was interested again. Tony missed the disruption of the Tony/Steve bubble.
Thor got to his feet, Loki at his side. “We will beg Heimdall to find the Collector as soon as possible,” Thor said.
“I’m not blaming you,” Steve assured Tony. “At least not anymore.” He indicated Bucky. “I know just how stubborn this guy can be.”
Tony walked into the living room, jacket off, tie loose and hands in his pockets. “Whatcha watching, Mon Capitan?” he asked, that sly grin telling Steve that he already knew.
Coulson merely smiled a shark-like smile that gave away nothing. “And you weren’t itching to get your hands on that engine?”
“I am going to kill that mother-fucking, wanna-be god, dickbag!” Rhodes came into the kitchen a moment later, eyes wild. “What the fuck is wrong with you?” His total focus was Loki.
Bruce rubbed at the bridge of his nose. “I’m not going to kill Matilda, Tasha.” He pointed at Tony. “You. Lie down and shut up. You moving around is only helping the venom move faster through your blood-stream.”
“Indeed.” Strange lifted a hand to touch the amulet against his chest. Tony couldn’t believe he hadn’t noticed it before.
Natasha sat down on the sofa, her knee at Steve’s shoulder. “I was perhaps a little harsh before,” she admitted.
Tony watched Steve take a cautious sip and grimace. “I was never really much of a drinker,” he admitted.
“Wanda.” Steve called her over. Tony hadn’t realized she was even there. Vision was close on her heels.
Tony shook his head. “I dumped the information into J.A.R.V.I.S. servers but didn't really spend too much time looking at it. Why?”
“Like me,” Tony said, not looking at either of them. “The arc reactor technology has been on every terrorist’s bucket list since I invented it.” He grimaced. “You’d think the world would want my cold fusion tech so that we don’t have to use electricity ever again, but no, they want the shit that can be weaponized.”
“I’m not doing this for you,” Billie said, eyes flashing. “Lucifer can’t be allowed to get out again.”
He scratched his belly as he trundled into the bathroom. It was going to be a big day. He had to convince the Senate to drop the Superhuman Registration Act before the rest of the situation went to shit.
Tony watched Bucky flinch and then his jaw tightened. “Nobody is ever going to get the chance again,” he warned. “I’ll kill everything and everyone before that happens.”
I'm wrecked. This chapter was an utter bitch to write & I'm still not sure about it but eh.... I know there are multiple issues with Civil War but I want to believe that somehow our heroes will put on their big girl capes and get on with the job.
Steve shook his head, looking at Natasha and Bruce sitting together on the sofa. “You’re all drunk,” he said.
“And Rhodey,” Tony said, feeling the sudden urge to vomit. “Extremis is man-made,” he said to Thor, not looking at Loki. “How is that possible?”
” Natasha looked up.  “I see why you thought that it made no sense, Clint, but actually, in the myth and legend of my people passed down through generations, the people of Asgard were more than merely human.”
“I swear to god, you are actually a five year old in an adult body.” Rhodey’s winded complaint came as War Machine sat on the top of the Quinjet.
Tony gazed around him. It felt as though he was sitting in the middle of a galaxy. “The Big Bang theory was right then?” he mused out loud.
“All good,” Dean added, stepping forward and shaking Steve’s hand. He sounded like he’d gone several rounds with a throat grinder and lost. “Big fan.”
“I’ve apparently set up a meeting with someone who I really don’t like.” Tony grimaced at the mirror.
Steve dropped his head against the back of the sofa. “I’ve been thinking about that myself,” he admitted. He still needed to figure out what had woken him.
He wasn't going to touch the king comment. Bucky stood at his side, ready to protect his wing just as he'd always been.
Tony gave him a jaunty wave as he crossed back towards Steve. “Always keep them on their toes, I say,” he quipped, grabbing Steve’s outstretched hand.
“You’re fucking beautiful.” The words slipped out before he could stop them. Goddam slippery motherfuckers those word things, he thought.
In the middle of the celestial show were six stones in various colors. Strange named them, “Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind.” They lit up as he called their names, slipping through stars. “And Time.” He looked down, wiggled his fingers in what Tony thought was a little bit extra for drama, and the big-ass chunk of metal hanging on his chest opened to reveal a gleaming emerald light.
Tony’s gaze darted back to T’Challa. The tiny shake that proved the king had not agreed with this had him standing taller. “No.” It was only one word but it had everyone staring at him.
“In my vision I saw Asgard destroyed,” Thor said. “I can only assume it was for the Space Stone’s location.”
“It is the key to saving the Winter Soldier, Agent Barton.” Steve had taken note of the way that Vision was addressing them. He was keeping his distance with all of them. Apart from Wanda.
“There wasn’t any time,” Tony said. “Ross was going after the Avengers no matter what we tried to do. I
“You’d better believe it, Stark. You’re a loose cannon. I don’t like cannons.” Fury stood up, his annoyance a palpable cloak around him.
phone started ringing, and Tony couldn’t ignore this one. It was the best-bro version of the Oval Office Red Phone.
Tony watched Wilson struggle with the idea that he might have to kill the most powerful man on the planet. “Fuck.”
Rhodey hastily hid a chuckle in his fist behind him as the General Assembly stared at him in confusion.
Sam and Clint started a drinking game based on “Never Have I Ever” and it was quickly established that Tony was surrounded by degenerates.
He lifted his legs carefully and scanned the area. He was taking Bruce home. The sense of accomplishment was huge.
Again, using much of the script I'm trying to add my Steve/Tony thoughts and motivations for much of what they do. There's a whole lot of baggage with this one
“I get the guy!” Tony crowed. “He wants to bang me like a drum!” He delighted in saying things like this to Rhodey. His reactions were always so satisfying.
“Tony’s had a heart attack.” Pepper didn’t bother with mincing words. “F.RI.D.A.Y. grabbed him, bundled him into an Iron Man suit and took him to the nearest hospital. Vision took Bruce with him, following the suit, but we need something a little faster than Tony’s Bugatti.”
Crowley held up his hands as he skirted a particularly vicious gang rape. “I’m not the one who decides.”
Bucky rolled off Tony, onto his back, and held out a hand to Steve. “That impressive hard-on needs to be taken care of, Stevie. Need a little help with that?”
“Also, ew,” Clint said, wrinkling his nose. “That’s like thinking about your parents doing the nasty."
Tony swung his head to stare at Steve. “Really?” He felt his heart give an excited little leap. Only a few days and already things were looking way better in this timeline.
Laura shrugged. “I first have to decide if you’re worth taking back.” She walked out of the kitchen, stopping at the door. “Follow me.”
Thor rumbled a laugh. “I need to keep you more satisfied, brother, if you feel the need to flirt with others.”
Bucky shook his head. “Couldn’t hear over the snoring. But you’re not the sort to imagine things, so until someone proves otherwise, I’m going to believe you.”
They walked towards the science department. Tony was in his final year of his third doctorate. He’d arrived at Harvard at fourteen and decided to never leave. Of course this year was the year that Pepper, Rhodey and Jarvis graduated. Tony didn’t know if he was going to stay when they were gone.
And Steve knew that no matter who they called the leader of the Avengers, the glue, the heart of them, was Tony.
“A lovely little country in Eastern Europe called Sokovia,” Tony told him. “I’m told tourism there is booming.”
“He wanted to call you right away,” Bucky confessed. “But I wasn’t ready to see you. Wasn’t ready for you to be disappointed in me.”
“You must understand that he believed that he was only there on sufferance,” Thor said, reaching out to run a hand over Matilda’s thick fur. “He was the son of a conquered world that my father adopted. We were raised as brothers in every way, but Loki always felt less than I.”
“Including interest and death benefits, approximately three million dollars.” The answer was prompt. She’d definitely been digging in her own time.
“And why didn’t we know about that?” Clint was caressing his bow in an uncomfortably phallic manner.
“You need to sleep.” Steve dropped a hand onto his arm. “I’m sure you’ll feel better afterwards and then you can catch us up on the finer details of the mission.”
Thor’s inelegant snort spoke volumes. “I cannot trust you, brother, not when you took on our father’s form and managed to trick me.” He shook his head. “I am afraid that I must add my insistence to this.”
Bucky jostled Natasha to move. “Eh, we only have problems on days ending in –y,” he said. Clint yanked a couple of arrows out of a few of the bodies lying around and hurried to catch them.
“I like being called “sweetheart”,” Bucky admitted as they walked to the bed. “It’s an old-fashioned sort of thing.” His hand was loosely clasped in Tony’s.
Sam looked torn. Steve hid his smile behind his hand. Tony sniggered, having no sense of self-preservation. Natasha turned her gaze to him. “Is something funny, Stark?” Again with the deceptive mildness of her voice.
They stayed there for a while, clutching at each other. Steve started to feel like maybe he could breathe again. Bucky’s body slowly relaxed against his until he was almost slumped against him. Steve just relished the fact that he could do this, was allowed to do this.
Pepper’s gaze narrowed. “Don’t you even go there, Steven Rogers. Right now, Tony is lost and you need to find him.” Her hand clenched on his arm. “He’s falling apart and you have to catch him.” She waved her other hand at the new team. “He said you didn’t even ask him to stay.”
“Nothing about this is going to be easy,” Steve agreed. “You don’t trust us and quite frankly, since Leipzig, we don’t really trust you.” He ignored Rhodes’ protests. “You all fought us. Yes, maybe we didn’t think everything through, but still, the people we trusted most tried to take us out. And then the RAFT just made it all worse.”
There was something in his voice that made Tony look closer. Those beautiful blue eyes were clouded with something he couldn’t put a finger on. “You alright?” he asked.
“Indeed there was, boss.” Perky needed reprogramming Tony thought viciously. “Or he’d tell Mrs. B about that time with the eggs and the fireworks and you know that would get back to Mr. B.”
The flight home seemed to go really quickly, Tony thought as he groggily lifted his head from his very comfortable pillow. He blinked. His very comfortable, Bucky-shaped pillow.
“I know.” Steve rubbed his eyes. “And somehow I’m going to make him sit down and talk to me about it. I’m tired of being sad all the time. I miss my friend.”
“Did he manage to evacuate any of your people?” Steve asked, sitting down next to Bucky. The thunk of Bucky’s head against his shoulder a moment later made his mouth curl in a small smile.
Steve raced to Tony’s bed, shoving Natasha and Clint out of the way. He was only vaguely aware of Thor grabbing his brother in the periphery of his vision. Tony lay there, unmoving, blue-tinged lips closed and skin colder than ice.
Steve sucked in a breath, his startled gaze shooting to meet Tony’s. “You weren’t actually kidding about that, were you?”
They left without any fanfare, Bruce’s wave a jaunty flick as he joined two other guys at the door. “Don’t wait up,” he called.
Scott stared at him. “You sound entirely too excited about this,” he said. “You planning on screwing me over?”
When Steve stepped into the lab, he was mesmerized by the swirling computer-generated image in the center of the room. Vision was standing in the middle of the image, eyes closed and hands spread out.
“Oh and in case we didn’t say it, we’re going to have to kill him to gain access to Purgatory.” Dean’s announcement dropped like a stone into the sudden silence.
It was grey. Tony turned in a circle, watched as the hole leading back home slid closed, Coulson and Bruce’s worried faces the last thing he saw.
“She must be so pissed off at me.” Clint stared at the phone as though it might bite him. His eyes were a little shiny.
“I’ve returned the man’s vehicle to him.” Coulson’s voice was still smooth and calm. “I think he’d prefer to leave as soon as possible.”
“And yet…” Tony stepped back as something walked out of the tunnel. Whatever or whoever it was, the air practically sang with power.
“We’ve identified at least one hundred individuals around the globe who bear the mark of Set,” Bruce said. “Are you expecting us to exorcise them all?”
Sam shook his head. “I hope she’s a lot less mad at you.” He started saying words that Tony didn’t recognize, although he figured the language was probably Latin. Dean held his arm over the bowl of herbs, cutting a deep slice across his forearm. The blood dripped steadily, hitting the herbs with a small hiss.
They reached Natasha and Bruce who were doing a vague facsimile of a shuffle. Natasha was leading. “So, Rhodey the real boy, is wanting to know what was so secret when I broke it off with Pep and took up with my boys that I only spoke to Bruce here.”
coming here.” Rhodey gritted the words out again. The hydraulic braces made a hiss as he stepped into Tony’s space. “They can find somewhere else to fucking get their shit together.”
He nodded his thanks and headed for the bathroom. He stood under the shower, looking through the glass wall to the Malibu coastline below. He wondered exactly how he’d managed to get here. His memory was a blank space. He’d clearly done a good job of getting his drunk on.
Steve held Tony in his arms, relishing the chance to be close to him. Tony had never been the most affectionate of the team, but Steve had missed those odd little aborted pats and touches that Tony handed out absently. He hadn’t realized how precious they were until he didn’t have them anymore.
Vision stopped in front of a set of large doors. “This is the East Wing. There are several suites available to you all. There is a fully stocked kitchen as well as a gymnasium and an entertainment area. Your needs should be fully met.”
“There’s no need to be rude!” Tony got in before Steve could say a word. “A simple ‘please’ would have been sufficient.”
“Sorry, Peach-blossom, that’s Pepper’s job now,” Tony said without thinking, his brain suddenly offline and his brain to mouth filter inactive.
might be amenable to the task,” the South African said. “In all of this you have conducted yourself with the needs of the many ahead of the needs of the few.”
Tony winced. “I look forward to it, big guy.” He rubbed at his aching hand. “I hope it isn’t too long.”
Tony held up a hand. “If you say that you didn’t mean to do that, I will not be held responsible for my actions.” He watched Steve’s face.
“I guessed that,” Bucky said as he sat down. “I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable with me.” He looked nervous.
He started moving away and Tony grabbed for his head. “Don’t you dare, you bastard,” Tony growled. “You’d better finish what you started.”
He followed Bruce’s instructions to lay Bucky down on the long sofa in the corner of the lab. “Everything about this is so experimental.” Bruce seemed to almost be speaking to himself. “I just hope that the calculations were correct.”
“I’m going to fix you,” he promised. And he meant it. The voice in his head had become familiar in a way he couldn’t explain.
Tony sniffed. “Good thing I’m not planning on becoming a dad then, isn’t it?” he asked. “Buh-bye.” He headed back towards Steve and Bucky with a jaunty wave.
“The scepter?” Natasha asked. Clint went a little pale. Steve made another mental note to check in with him soon.
His smile dropped the moment he was alone. Nothing any one of them did would be enough for him to forgive them. He had a feeling that of them all, only Natasha knew just how betrayed he felt. He’d be a fool to let them back into his life.
“Your dad isn’t allowed to leave, Coop,” he said. “Because he did some stupid shi..stuff, the government says he has to stay here with me until he’s made up for being a dumbass.”
“Thor, you may not be human, but I’ve seen you come down with a cold. Many of the same things that make humans ill affect you too.” Steve reached out to clasp his shoulder. “I’m going to leave the science to Bruce and I’ll go and do some research on the Ancient database to see if I can find any sort of reference to our new sort of feline friend.”
“But he calls you Captain America,” Tony pointed out, because he was a petty bitch, and Coulson’s Bambi eyes at Steve were starting to annoy him.
Vision escorted Wanda into the second lift, offering her his arm. “I believe I know just where Tony would like you to stay,” he told her as the doors closed on them. “I'll be close by.” Huh, Tony hadn't seen that one coming.
She smiled. It was goddam terrifying. Tony was going have nightmares for weeks. “No light. Nighttime. Check this morning. Okay dollar. Still check. Maybe fake.”
“Depends on Tony,” Rhodes said with a shrug. “But don’t push. He’ll react by shoving you so far away from him that you’ll never be allowed back.”
Tony exchanged a look with Bruce. They’d definitely corner their favorite Norse god later and pry the truth out of him.
Tony swallowed hard. His last memory of Bucky Barnes had been of him hobbling away with Steve’s arm wrapped around him while Tony lay struggling to breathe as the icy cold of winter folded over him. “I don’t need your help,” he rasped.
Jim spun to look at him. “This is Steve fucking Rogers we’re talking about, Tony. He’s not just going to go away when he can’t find me.”
They struggled to stop the laughter, eventually managing to appear at least a little sober. Bruce had started taking questions.
“Mr. Stark?” The trembling voice of a terrified boy had Steve helping Tony over to where Peter stood. “I don’t feel so good.” Steve wanted to scream as he watched tiny particles of ash begin to slide off the kid’s body.
“Are you saying that the US Secretary of State is trying to pass a law that forces the superheroes to register and he’s a disciple of a demon from another dimension?”
Sam shrugged. “I’m tall for a human.” He looked at Mjolnir, hanging off Thor’s belt. “I meant to ask you earlier, did you perhaps misplace that a few years ago?”
Tony dropped his head on Steve’s shoulder. “I love you, Steve Rogers. I’m going to do my very best to find a way to live, if not forever, then at least as long as you.”
Crowley isn't going to be a push-over. RockPaperScissors decides the crew. Hell is surprisingly....not hellish?
When Tony stepped out of the elevator, Natasha punched him in the stomach. He doubled over, wheezing and clutching his belly.
So, just an FYI - this story ended up taking an unexpected turn. Apologies for the lack of sexy times. I promise they're coming. We just need to deal with a demon god-king-thing.
“This is your lady?” Bucky asked, making Tony squeak a little. Bucky was a fucking menace, he thought.
Tony still couldn’t bring himself to think about his friends having sex. In his mind, they were all virgins.
dearly beloved, is why I can’t handle this guy.” Tony came into the room with Rhodes at his side. The apparently sentient cloak slinked its way over to Tony, reaching out to touch. He smacked it away.
Bruce patted his head like he was a well-behaved dog. “Get some sleep.” His smile was nasty. “I’m sure you’re going to wish you were dead when you remember tonight.”
“I believe you.” Bucky sounded amazed. “I hardly know you, but I believe you.” He laced his fingers through Tony's. “Now maybe you and Steve can sort your shit out so that I can get on with learning how to be a person again?”
Tony patted his arm. “You’re my number one boo. Brucie-bear is my number one bro. You need to learn to love each other.” Steve gave a strangled chuckle.
Steve put his hands on Tony’s shoulders, desperate to stop the frantic staccato speech. “Tony, I need you to breathe.”
. “Hey,” he said when he answered it. “You miss me?” He was too tired to even try to sound flirtatious.
Steve flushed. This body he’d been given wasn’t the one he’d been born with, but it certainly made people pay attention to him. “Bet you say that to all the dames,” he said with a quick glance at Bucky beneath his eyelashes.
Steve lay there as Bucky pushed Tony to the bed, fingering him open until he was writhing on the sheets like a wanton thing.
Bruce waved the apology off. “We’re all a little punch-drunk now,” he said. “I’m sure we could use some rest while Tony does his thing.”
It worked this time too as Thor beamed at him. “Mjolnir is a fine instrument,” he agreed. “And you are perhaps correct. It would be better to take my leave outside.”
Tony put up a hand. “How about you leave your brother here, take someone less … Asgardian… with you?” He watched Steve begin to protest. “I’m just saying, keeping Loki here is sort of collateral. Assurance that the Collector will hand over the stone.” Steve snapped his mouth shut.
Tony’s eyes closed, a combination of bone-deep weariness and excessive alcohol making his body feel like liquid.
“While I’d be pretty happy to watch this for the next hundred years or so, your robot lady butler told me to remind you about your appointment.” Steve was trying to annoy Tony it seemed.
Tony felt his heart stop. “Viz.” Vision was the last vestige of his child, his J.A.R.V.I.S. The thought of him being so willing to sacrifice himself made Tony sick. “No.” He lurched back to his feet, dizzy with panic.
“No-one saw it, Tony.” Bruce looked up at him. “If Jane hadn’t found the crown and Thor hadn’t brought it here, then Set would have taken over the world with barely a whimper.”
Sam slid to the floor next to him, anger forgotten. “Steve! Take a breath, man. Deep breaths.” He put his hand between Steve’s shoulder blades, a grounding touch that had its desired effect on Steve almost immediately.
When he’d made a comment about it, Bucky had laughed. “Don’t tell Tony. His head is already way too big.”
Bruce rolled his eyes. “You’re both hilarious,” he drawled. “Should be in stand-up comedy.” He went to one of the computers and keyed something in. “I’ve programmed the gamma rays to concentrate on the areas of your brain where the nanites are nesting.”
“You said tight,” Rhodey sniggered and then yelped when Pepper reached out at twisted his ear. Hard.
“What the fuck are you doing to him?” Tony heard Bucky’s growl from a distance. It sounded like he was speaking to him through layers of jello.
“Shut up.” Clint stepped into the fray. “You don’t get to be a martyr about this.” He poked Tony’s chest. “We all chose sides. Someone was going to get hurt.”
“I’ve been doing some catching up with my new friend here,” Tony drawled, his voice cool and measured. It hadn’t been that way a day or two ago. Once Steve had started talking about what Stane had been doing, Tony hadn’t believed him at first. It had taken Pepper and a flash drive to convince him.
Tony let his mouth curve a little. “Until you rate me as a friend, I’ll carry on calling you Jim, okay?” They’d agreed on that the first day. Tony wasn’t altogether sure an adult male should
Bucky bit into Tony’s ass cheek with a nip that made Tony groan. He was discovering kinks he had not known he had. The other cheek was given the same treatment, along with a swipe of Bucky’s tongue.
“No you don’t,” Pepper said. “I asked F.R.I.D.A.Y. to send it back to the mansion.” One high-heeled stiletto tapped on the tiles. “Will I hear any more arguments from you?”
Tony stopped thinking and moved around to crouch in front of Bucky. He reached up to put a hand on the back of Bucky’s neck, position eerily similar to a few days ago.
When they headed to the communal living room, Tony saw Natasha and Bruce leaning against each other as they looked at something on the tablet in Bruce’s hand. They were laughing at whatever it was.
didn’t want to be talking about this. “Vision says I’m worthy of great love.” His eyes slid to the left, to where Bucky was sitting.
“What about the mark?” Tony suggested, holding his hand up and spreading his fingers like the mark they’d seen.
“So half of the Gems.” Tony grinned. “F.R.I.D.A.Y. please can you get Rhodey and Barnes here as soon as you can? And if Legolas and the godlets are around, tell them to pop over.”
Steve sighed and rolled off the hammock, planting himself in front of Tony. He saluted sharply. “Steve Rogers reporting for duty, Sir.”
“Shut up, Banner!” Rhodey panted, running after Tony who kept running away from him, cackling like a crazy person.
Rhodes followed Natasha, carefully closing the door behind him. “Tony asked me to take you all back to the mansion.” He didn’t appear too happy about it. “I wanted Vision to do it but he has to bring Bruce back and well…” He turned, heading for the roof where they’d left the jet. Steve winced every time he heard the soft swish-snick of the hydraulic braces.
Tony swallowed hard. Every type of sexual sadism was on display, from whips and chains, to ropes and hooks. And not one single soul cried out in anything but agony.
Steve nodded, not trusting himself to speak and headed for Tony’s rooms. They’d be waiting for him when he got back.
He closed his eyes, trying to remember when last he’d had so little control. Yeah, no. Not going there, he thought.
Tony lay back on the floor, sticking his tongue out at her. “I’m totally your favorite,” he told her.
“It’s one I’ve called you in my head since I’ve known you,” Steve told him, grinning at Barnes as they went past. “Hey, Buck, I reckon I don’t need to worry about dames liking me. I think I may be getting lucky.”
“Seriously, just tell me what the fuck I have to do to get this done and stop being a cryptic asshole.” Tony scowled at him.
other than him. “I didn’t think they’d put them in his brain,” he told Bruce. “Those fuckers at Hydra really played dirty.”
Steve is starting to realize how much damage he's done. Tony has a little bit of an episode thinking about seeing his former teammates. Oh....And Pepper and Rhodey are the awesomest.
Scott sighed. “Guys, I’m really grateful and all, but I really don’t want to hang out at some moldy old mansion when I could get home to my kid. I just hope Cassie remembers who I am and that Hope doesn’t entirely kick my ass to the curb.” He tapped Rhodes on the shoulder. “Do you think maybe you could give me a ride to San Francisco?”
Bucky leaned back against Tony, head resting on his shoulder. “You both cared for me enough to let me work this out on my own,” he said. “It’s why I’m kinda crazy about the two of you.”
“Do you know how creepy that is, Viz?” Tony demanded. “You need to not do the stealth walk around friends.”
“Why?” Scott asked. “I mean, when Tony talked to Sam back on the RAFT he sounded like he knew that your buddy had been brain-washed.”
Tony tried to pout. He knew it looked ridiculous on his forty...thirty something year old face, but it was worth a try nevertheless. “Don' wanna,” he whined.
“I’m drinking my beer-flavored water!” Tony took a sip to prove his point. “I need to take you to South Africa or Australia where they make
Natasha pursed her lips. “My Norse mythology is sketchy, admittedly, but there is something in legend about a world tree.”
“But Pep, I make you fucking miserable.” Tony met her gaze. Her eyes were already glassy with tears.
Natasha stood in front of him. “You let us believe this for six years?” Her face was a mask. “You lied to us.”
Tony’s snort was inelegant. “He holds a grudge like a baby,” he said. “As if he hasn’t kept a secret before.” He waved an angry hand at Bucky. “Case in point.”
The Quinjet wasn't built for seven adults stretched out. Sam, Rhodey, Bucky and Steve just turned on their sides and made one row. Sleeping in uncomfortable places was the norm for them.
“I…Buck…” Steve’s fingers clenched on Bucky’s shoulders. “Are you sure?” Please god, let him be sure, Steve prayed.
“Call up the terrain map of the islands off the coast of Australia,” Tony ordered. He scanned the area that lit up. “StarkTech made you just a little too well,” he murmured. “But as I
Bruce sighed. “The Other Guy is a menace and a danger to society.” He shook his head. “It's better this way.”
Clint, Natasha and Steve looked at each other. “I guess we’re going to find ourselves a Hulk,” Clint said.
“Yeah,” Steve said. “And then I met Tony Stark. The guy who, in so many ways, reminded me of Howard and yet was so very different.”
“We know what you are trying to do, son of Loki.” Strange spoke but there was something off in his voice, a layer of sound that Tony couldn’t quite identify.
Dean grinned. “I’m the type who collects on my debts,” he warned. “It was good meeting you, Captain. I’m glad some things in life aren’t an over-exaggeration.”
Steve grabbed Tony’s hand. “That means a lot, Tony. Thank you.” Something heavy lifted off his chest, a weight he hadn’t known he’d been carrying.
Tony thought about that for a moment. “Huh.” It sounded logical. Vision wasn’t human, but he wasn’t alien either. “I think you’d be right.”
Natasha looked angrier than he'd ever seen her. “Just because he gave up on us, doesn't mean we should have given up on him.”
Bucky knelt on the bed, hand still in Tony’s. His gaze slid from Steve to Tony. “I’m thinking we’re a package deal.”
The medical team scuttled closer and took hold of his arms. He let one of them start to take his pulse.
Tony snorted. “If a deadly praying mantis who can fuck you and then murder you afterwards is your idea of perfect, then totally.”
Matilda suddenly moved forward, slinking on her stomach towards Thor, mewling in the back of her throat. To Steve, it sounded like a child's cry for help. It made every hair on his body stand on end.
He shrugged. “You don’t really know me,” he replied. “I’m not sure why you said those things, but thank you.”
“Falcon says that at least one of the Secret Service agents assigned to the President has the mark,” Steve said, trying to steer the conversation to safer topics.
Rhodey hopped off the bar counter. “I’m banning you all from drinking games,” he told Natasha. She smirked. Rhodey pointed a finger at her. “You’re the devil.”
Tony glared at him. “You want me to talk to a tree?” And yes, the Avengers had seen a fair few crazy things but so far the other side had been capable of speech.
“I need to get your arm again,” he told Barnes. “I want your measurements so that I can fit you with the new one.” The distraction of building Barnes a new arm had kept him from thinking too much about what (and who) was missing in his life.
Bruce shrugged. “It’s close enough.” He looked over at Steve. “You should probably wear some form of protective gear,” he noted. “This is dangerous stuff.”
Tony’s eyes went wide as his brain went into over-drive. “That’s it!” He slithered out from beneath Steve, thoughts of romantic declarations vanished from his mind.
Eyes were glazing over. “Anyway, long story short, I used the Reality Stone and the formula and ta-da!” He made jazz hands. Nobody appeared impressed. “Trust me, it was awesome.”
Okay so back to the plotty things. Again, I am sciencing for shit. Hey, maybe by accident I'll discover how to go through a black hole safely.
Laura’s smile was small, but at least it was genuine. “Seriously, you saved our lives, Tony. Literally and figuratively.” She patted Rhodey’s cheek. “And Coop and Lila adore your robots.”
“You know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away.” He wondered how many times he was going to be able to stand up. To walk away. To win.
“Of course, but your dick gets really sore if you’re jacking off with your hand every night,” Bucky said, leaning back casually. “Sometimes the itch needs a harder scratch.”
Steve sucked in a breath when he felt a hand in his hair. Bucky stood behind him, eyes glittering. “Having some fun without me, boys?” he asked with an arched brow. “That’s kinda rude, dontcha think?”
“It’s happening again,” Wanda said and they all turned to look at the screen, gaping as the Hulk shifted back to Bruce, naked but for a pair of what looked like lycra shorts.
“Tony.” Steve clamped a hand on Tony’s knee. “You’re not helping me here. I’d be quite happy to head out there without aerial support if you’re not going to take this seriously.”
Tony was properly terrified of Natasha so he hurried after Thor to do just that. “Thor! Buddy! Point Break!”
Bucky stretched a bit, joints popping from sitting still for so long. “Don’t actually need much sleep,” he told Tony.
Steve kissed like a dream, Tony thought. He opened his eyes and looked into Steve’s. “What was that for?” he croaked.
“I’m going back home,” he told Steve. “Ross is about to be arrested for crimes against humanity for his role in what happened to Banner and others. King T’Challa has agreed to help re-write the Accords to make it more reasonable for all parties. Signing them bought us the time to change them. But if you’d asked me back at the compound, then I could have told you what the plan was.”
A throat clearing had them turning to the door. Steve hovered there, seemingly uncomfortable. “I can come back?”
“Yeah, see, this isn’t quite what I was expecting,” Clint said, his back to Natasha’s. “It’s way creepier.”
Steve stared at him. “Are you being serious?” He didn’t think Tony had liked him that way. Not until Bucky.
The words were simple enough, but they hit all of them like bullets. Steve could see his friends flinch.
He gave up pretty quickly after that. It wasn’t that he was stupid, the serum hadn’t just transformed his body after all, but Tony and Bruce thought at a speed that was constantly astonishing.
“Oooh.” Bucky gave a mock shiver that Steve couldn’t see, but Tony still appreciated. “I’m so scared.”
“You’re in stellar company,” Bruce said. Loki gave him a little wave and a wink. Steve couldn’t understand why Thor continued to protect him.
“You indicated that you weren’t interested in working with SHIELD, Mr. Stark.” Coulson had regained his composure. “Steve, however, was keen to sign up with us.”
“Yes, sir,” she repeated. “May I suggest that you take something to slow your heart-rate?” She paused. “And I should warn you that the elevator is on the way down.”
“You just never know when to shut up, do you Tony?” Steve’s question was almost fond. He watched Tony from the sofa.
Clint stared at her. Then looked at Steve. Steve shrugged. “Oka-aa-ay then.” Clint turned back to the controls. “I guess we're heading
“The place where we found Matilda is no longer there,” Natasha said, eyes moving between Steve and Clint. “It is as though it was a figment of our imagination.”
He pulled up in the parking lot of the ATO house, taking a deep breath before heading for the front door. It swung open before he could lift a hand to knock.
Steve stepped in front of Tony when Stane walked up to him with his arms outstretched. “Stay back,” he ordered, holding a hand up in warning.
“Thrown every SHIELD agent to the wolves,” Tony scowled. “Blown all their covers, left them to fend for themselves in a world that wants to kill them.”
“I didn’t mean to make you feel guilty, Tony,” Natasha said. “We had already done so much damage, despite the good. Ultron was the reason that I agreed to sign. Accountability. I left Russia to become better, to be someone that those who created me would despise. That was what the Avengers gave me. Until we fell apart.” Her eyes dropped to her hands. “I signed because it was the right thing to do. I left because of the same reason.” She looked at Steve. “If I had known what you had done to Tony, however…” The low warning was enough to make anyone twitch. Steve wasn’t immune.
