John stares from the box to Sherlock and back again. “W-wait,” he finally stammers. “You- you were going to…
When I enter my flat, the first thing I do is close all the blinds. I have an unsettling feeling that he is watching me from somewhere out there, and knowing him, he probably is. I won’t give him the pleasure of seeing me have a complete breakdown - because that is what’s about to happen.
“You left him somewhere again, didn’t you?” Lestrade hides his face in his hand, his tone exasperated and accusatory.
John moves another step closer and takes Sherlock’s hand. “Don’t be stupid. I know I would be upset if you made a list like that about me.”
Sherlock is relieved to discover that Lestrade has indeed returned when he arrives at Scotland Yard. Just as Sherlock had hoped, he didn’t feel the need to oversee the remainder of the collection of mummified body parts in the burning June sun, and so, has left it to someone else. And he does indeed agree to let Sherlock poke through the databases - quite possibly jumping at the opportunity of not having to do it himself, allowing him to spend his energy on something a bit more urgent.
“Shit,” John doesn’t quite know how to respond. “Sherlock… that is both the nicest and the most terrifying thing anyone has ever said to me.”
A flutter of relief and excitement rushes through John as he hurries to Rosie’s room to pick her up and get her ready to leave.
brilliant. But more importantly, I cannot believe it because that would ruin me completely. Because what I do know for absolute certain, is that during the time I spent with him, I was the happiest I have ever been. Which is probably a bit weird, considering the amount of near-death, kidnapping, violence, and general danger involved in knowing him.
“Hardly my fault he isn’t able to keep up,” Sherlock says defiantly and starts walking again. He is feeling annoyed; at Lestrade for wasting his time with trivialities like tact and good manners, but also - deep down - at himself. John would never leave Sherlock behind, and Sherlock knows how it bothers John when he does that. He cannot help but feel a bit guilty about it. There it is again: The caring lark; sentiment; consideration. His past self would have found it aggravating. His current self - post-John Sherlock - just finds it a little confusing. It scares him, the way John seems to be able to toy with his emotions, even when he isn’t there. He feels like it leaves him vulnerable and exposed.
He groans and rests his forehead on Greg’s desk – he seems to find himself in this particular position a lot lately.
Mission: Johnlock is not going as well as planned. Molly and Harry try to stop Greg from giving relationship advice.
After washing my hands, I turn around and almost bump into him. We stand there for a moment, suddenly uncomfortably close, and he’s giving me
Rosie is throwing a hissy fit. Crying, screaming, squirming; throwing her entire upper body over the side of the pushchair, almost knocking it out of the hands of her exasperated father, who, for his life, could not tell you the reason for her tantrum. He is acutely aware that people - especially composed-looking mothers with well-behaved children in pushchairs and prams of their own - are sending him disapproving looks, but there isn’t much he can do except hurrying to get home.
There is an immediate change to Jeanette’s general demeanour; her shocked expression is replaced by a compassionate smile; her eyes soften; she subtly flips her ponytail. John has seen this happen with a few women in the past, when they believe that he’s a single father.
successful - in the sense that not only has he managed to apparently confirm John’s affection for him; he has himself become completely consumed by the whole thing in only a matter of days. In fact, the texting has become Sherlock’s new favourite pastime, and truthfully, it has gone far beyond just being an experiment (or maybe it never really was one?). Sherlock didn’t realise how much he had missed being able to talk to John whenever he wants (Billy the skull really isn’t as good a replacement as Sherlock has been stubbornly claiming).
“I’ll go get her,” John says. When he returns downstairs with a pyjama-clad toddler in his arms, Sherlock has successfully unlocked the phone and is gleefully scrolling though a string of texts in the messenger app.
And then, one day, I finally get it. Like the last piece in a puzzle, finally falling into place. I don’t just love him, I
He goes upstairs, gets dressed in fresh clothes, and starts picking up the ones from yesterday that are scattered all over the bedroom floor along with John’s. When he pulls out his shirt from underneath John’s jeans, a folded piece of paper falls out of one of the back pockets. He knows he shouldn’t, but Sherlock is nothing if not extremely inquisitive (some might say nosy), so he picks up the paper; unfolds it; sees his own name, and now he obviously
It’s not that I’ve completely checked out. I go through the motions, not because I really want to or care much, but because I know that I should, and I’m disciplined enough to force myself to do it. I go to work; I buy groceries; I eat; I even exercise a bit. Sometimes I’ll have a pint with Greg or Bill or some of my old rugby mates. I’ve tried dating a bit, even had a girlfriend for a little while. Mary. She was lovely, actually, and very understanding. Under different circumstances, I think she could have been someone I’d like to spend the rest of my life with. But even she had to give up in the end. She told me she wouldn’t mind giving me time and comforting me if she believed that was going to make me better, but she had come to realise that it wouldn’t. She said she couldn’t be with me as long as I still loved someone else. I guess she was the only person who got even close to understanding.
“Good morning to you too,” John smiles. He has been listening carefully, looking equal parts fascinated and amused. “So, whoever did it was scared by something - or some
They don’t talk - in real life - in the same way they text. But there is a bit of a change, nonetheless. There are more lingering eye contacts, more subtle blushing and biting of lips. And they start, occasionally, to broaden the variety of subjects they talk about in real life; conversations become a bit more personal. Sherlock has never felt inclined to share mundane or potentially embarrassing details of his past with anyone, and he never had any interest in hearing others talk about them. But this is another rule in Sherlock’s universe that John has just effortlessly strolled in and changed. John has become a mystery that Sherlock longs to solve, and to his delight, he begins to learn the most interesting details about John that he never thought he could or wanted to get out of him.
I come by and visit him more and more frequently. More often than not, that leads to me getting wrapped up in some case he is working on. I start writing on my blog again.
“Really,” I say, and then, struck by a sudden thought, I add: “And if this is some sort of stupid joke, Sherlock, I swear I’m going to murder you.”
“Thank you,” I finally manage. He looks up, a puzzled expression on his face. “I wish… I wish you would have told me sooner.”
“Wonderful news, isn’t it?” a voice says behind me. I swivel. And I see a ghost. Except he isn’t a ghost.
John frowns. “It just seems… I don’t know. A bit mean? And feelings aren’t really quantifiable like that, are they? I mean a list like that about Sherlock is sure to have way more cons than pros - he’s completely insufferable and impossible to live with… Christ, there must be something wrong with me!”
The following day, the front pages of all the country’s tabloids feature a large photograph of us, mid-kiss, coffee in hand, snow cascading down around us like a translucent curtain. I thought something like that would bother me, but weirdly - while I’m a little annoyed and embarrassed by the attention - it doesn’t seem like that big of a deal. It’s actually a nice picture, and it was a nice kiss, so I can’t bring myself to regret it. Sherlock even seems to be rather pleased with the whole situation. We end up cutting out the front page of
“Okay, okay.” He takes a deep breath, bracing himself for what he’s about to say. “I… love you, John. I always have, I think.”
And so, Sherlock decides it’s time to adjust the parameters of the experiment: He needs to be more aggressive. Sherlock winces.
He somehow never imagined it would happen here. In his and Mary's house, in the bed they used to share. Sherlock doesn’t really fit in here. It’s all way too normal, way too mundane to match Sherlock’s chaotic otherworldliness. John simply hadn’t been able to imagine him here like this. And yet, here he is, splayed out on the bed beneath him; naked and pale and unfathomably beautiful. Eyes burning and dark hair spread around his face like a halo.
John frowns. “Wait…” A terrifying thought hits him. “If it’s that obvious that I like him, do you think… God, you don’t think Sherlock
“It wasn’t supposed to take that long. And John, I really didn’t think you would… I… If I had known, I wouldn’t have…”
he likes John back. He has been aware of these feelings for a very long time and has long ago decided not to do anything about it. He has always been absolutely sure John didn’t - couldn’t - reciprocate his feelings. It seems impossible. But what if Lestrade is telling the truth? Sherlock is aware of the delicacy of situations like this; there are a lot of things to consider. He doesn’t want to jeopardise his friendship with John. But he also wants to find out more.
“Well, you are… to me. Don’t you understand? There is hardly a single thing I could reasonably put on that list, because none of your flaws bother me all that much. Everything about you is perfect to me, even your flaws. Maybe that
To make matters worse, his relationship with this particular ex didn’t end on the best of terms, although it’s been a few years, and so, hopefully, there are no hard feelings. John hasn’t forgotten, however, that Jeanette was the one who broke up with him partly because she claimed he was a better boyfriend to Sherlock Holmes than he was to her. Which, in hindsight, was probably true. The fact that Sherlock really
When I get back downstairs, he’s not back yet. I’m still shivering a bit from the cold rain, so I stoke the dying fire and sit down in my armchair. A moment later, Sherlock emerges too, hair still dripping on his fresh shirt, and quietly sits down opposite me.
“Where’s John?” Lestrade asks Sherlock for the second time that day, as he leads Sherlock down a hallway.
, she said recently. It’s been too long to just be situational. I usually just nod and shrug and take the pills she prescribes.
A shower is probably in order. He slowly gets out of bed and walks down the hall to the bathroom, feeling a bit like an intruder, although this too is irrational. This is John’s house. Of course, he is welcome here.
First of all, because he’s gone. He’s dead, and I still miss him terribly, even though it’s been almost two years since his suicide. I can’t seem to get over it, he just keeps on rummaging in the back of my head, like an insect stuck in a jar. I thought I would have stopped grieving by now, but truth be told, I haven’t. I can’t. Maybe I never will. So, it’s hard for me to talk about him, even now. But I do try. I owe him that.
Five more minutes pass without a reply. A tingle of panic and uneasiness has settled itself in the pit of his stomach.
). After his shower, he heads downstairs with a towel around his waist and locates his overnight bag, still next to the front door where he dropped it last night.
“Uh, yes, I… Something came up…” Sherlock turns his eyes down and clearly tries to make his face look neutral and relaxed. He doesn’t quite succeed.
you know my name, huh?” Lestrade - unfortunately - doesn’t seem intimidated in the slightest. Time to change tactics. Sherlock takes a step back towards the door.
people flirt. Both with him (i.e., The aforementioned Woman for example), and with others (mostly John, whose attempts he has always found to be a bit awkward, but surprisingly often seem to be successful). He feels confident that he needs to find some sort of compromise between doing it in a way that “normal” people (i.e., John) will find attractive, while not straying too far from his own personality. Anything else would probably make John uncomfortable and/or suspicious.
I feel something sink inside me. What had it even meant? The kiss? Somehow, I have a hard time imagining Sherlock being in love. Not that I don’t think he’s capable of feeling things - I know he is. But love? I don’t know. That’s one of the sides of my best friend that I’ve never really been able to figure out. He’s referred to the concept as “human error” in the past; insisted that “romantic entanglement” wasn’t for him. So what did the kiss mean? Was it just Sherlock being Sherlock; just trying something out, simply to see how I’d react? No, it can’t be that. He isn’t
One afternoon, while John has been helping him look through an insane number of notebooks and diaries for one specific phone number that the victim may or may not have scribbled in one of them, their conversation has fallen on the hobbies they had when they were at school. This conversation, as has become their habit, continues almost immediately after John has closed the door behind him (taxi again, then):
Doesn’t send it. Obviously. He has typed out those three words countless times, but he never presses ‘send'.
He feels a quick rush of excitement somewhere in the lower part of his stomach, as he always does these days when Sherlock texts him. Or talks to him. Or does pretty much anything, really, as of late.
“You should have told me,” I say. “You could have. Why didn’t you trust me? Did you really think I couldn’t keep it a secret?”
“Just as I thought,” he says smugly. “Look at this.” He sits up and makes room so that John can sit down beside him and receive the phone in exchange for Rosie, who babbles happily as John hands her over to Sherlock.
She frowns for just a second before her eyes widen in realisation. “John? Oh, hi! My goodness, I didn’t recognise you!” She smiles a wide smile, which actually looks genuine enough. So, no hard feelings. At least, that’s something. “You look great!” she adds. This statement might be less genuine than the smile, but he’ll take it.
“I’m almost finished,” he says, returning his attention to the microscope, his voice still completely calm. John turns to walk towards the door again but is stopped in his tracks when Sherlock adds. “And also, the answer is yes.”
Sherlock has that air of nonchalant superiority about him that I know from experience can be absolutely infuriating when it’s directed at you. “I didn’t do anything,
?” He carefully opens the box, and yes, it is a ring. A really nice one, too; oxidised silver with a band of shiny, dark wood in the middle.
He seems a bit taken aback by the bluntness of the question. It takes him a while to form an answer. “I- it was… a mistake. I’m sorry.”
I retrieve my hand - letting it slide down Sherlock’s chest, not entirely willing to give up the physical contact yet. His hand stays on the small of my back, though, and I realise I don’t mind.
Once there, Sherlock throws his blazer theatrically over a chair - it’s one of the very few days a year where even he has to admit it’s too hot out to wear his coat - and settles himself in front of the microscope with the mummy samples.
“I couldn’t risk it,” he says. “And, well…” Now his expression is definitely pained. I suddenly get it, and a burst of anger runs through me.
Oh, and Harry is called Harriet here, because I just assumed she would have her given name on her facebook. Hope that makes sense!
“Greg! I swear, you’re just doing that on purpose now. But whatever, Spock, I’ll leave you to it, then. You have an hour.”
I turn to look down to the street again and wait. It only takes a few minutes before I hear his voice.
I don’t know how long we stand like that. When Sherlock finally speaks again, his voice is a little hoarse: “No one ever called me their best friend before.”
“Good for you,” she says. “It’s definitely a step up from ‘the boring teacher’. That’s what you called me last time.”
“’Morning, Sherlock. Where's John?” Lestrade looks a little more tired than usual this morning as Sherlock joins him. Sherlock allows himself a moment to enjoy the view from Parliament Hill of the city rising out of the early morning fog, before engaging in conversation.
He calls out a few times, his voice hazy and raspy, but the house is quiet. He throws his upper body over the edge of the bed to retrieve his phone from the pocket of his trousers, which are still in a pile on the floor where one of them (who exactly it was that did what is somewhat fuzzy) tossed them last night. There are two texts, the first sent about 15 minutes ago, the other one, a few minutes later:
“I shouldn’t have said anything,” John says after a long pause. “Forget I said anything about it. It’s completely ridiculous. It’s probably just a stupid crush. Either way, it’s pointless. I’m a single father in my 40s - I should be looking for a sensible woman who would make a good stepmother. And I have been seeing a few of those, but I just felt… nothing. They were all perfectly nice. But of course, instead I end up falling for my best friend, who may or may not be completely insane and probably isn’t the least bit interested.”
She clearly doesn’t know what to say to that. John - who had just for the briefest moment been so proud of Sherlock for almost acting like an actual human being from planet Earth - rolls his eyes and sends her a look that he hopes comes across as apologetic. “Yes, thank you for that assessment, Sherlock. Would you mind taking Rosie inside and maybe get started on that snack? I’ll be there in a sec.”
“Really?” Jeanette can’t quite hide her amusement. If John is being honest, he too has a hard time believing that Sherlock remembers her. Sherlock, however, surprises - as he tends to do:
“What? No. No, no, no.” John has waited too long for this to just let Sherlock freak out and bolt with no explanation. He places both his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders and firmly but lovingly pushes him back inside. He closes the door behind him. “Talk,” he demands.
Sherlock shakes his head and tries to focus. Another text from John weakens his resolve considerably.
I’m pulled out of the moment by the sound of someone clearing their throat behind Sherlock. I move my head slightly to the side to look past him, and I’m met with the sight of Greg Lestrade and Sergeant Donovan walking up to us - that must have been who Sherlock had been texting before. Greg looks slightly amused, Donovan - to my delight - like she’s about to throw up.
“Okay? When can I see you again?” John frowns. There’s a pained expression on Sherlock’s face. He doesn’t answer, and he still won’t meet his eyes. “Sherlock? What’s going on?”
“Yeah, ta,” he says and awkwardly runs his hand through his hair, trying to straighten it a bit. “You too. It’s eh- nice to see you.”
After a few hours, when Sherlock has seen everything he needs to, the two of them head to Bart's to “borrow" some equipment to look at some samples Sherlock has gathered (“It's Molly's day off, so she won’t mind,” Sherlock claims).
This honestly terrifies Sherlock, and it’s not just because talking about his feelings makes him uncomfortable. His feelings for John scare him, and after he started the experiment it has become increasingly difficult for him to keep them under control. If he were to reveal those feelings to John, and if indeed that resulted in the two of them initiating a romantic relationship, what would that look like? Sherlock isn’t entirely convinced that he is suitable for that sort of thing, and John… Well, John is good, and kind, and generous, and caring - doesn’t he deserve to be with someone who are all those things too? Can Sherlock be those things? He isn’t entirely convinced himself. As a matter of fact, he suspects that he would fall short. That he would mess everything up and hurt John, make him miserable.
John helps look for more remains and listens patiently to his theories for another couple of hours, until Sherlock decides he has seen enough. He wants to head to the lab and look at the samples he has collected from the mummies. Strictly speaking, he
“I assume ‘snores sometimes’ is in that same category, and then there’s really nothing left. One of the remaining three isn’t even about me, and the last two aren’t really disadvantages at all, are they?”
When he enters the sitting room, there’s Sherlock standing just inside the front door, looking at a now visibly baffled Greg Lestrade, who clearly needs a moment to compose himself.
Within minutes he has hailed a cab and is being carried through the relatively smooth evening traffic. He settles with his phone on the backseat to resume the conversation, and finds another text from John:
John bites his lip and hesitates for another moment. “You know, if you want to... you could come by later? I put Rosie down at 7.”
. I am simply not a suitable choice for a romantic partner. And I’m not… chances are, I’m not going to change, John.”
Yeah, so it's summer and sunny here, but for some reason I've been thinking about snow today, so I wrote this. Very fluffy, very pointless.
Sherlock turns his head. John can feel him frown in surprise against his temple. “I’ll certainly endeavour to be.”
boring, or at least, to a much lesser degree than anyone else Sherlock has ever met. He doesn’t like to admit that he
If only John still lived with him; and if only he didn’t have that pesky job of his, then Sherlock would have many more opportunities to study his responses. John has been working a lot as of late (something about Rosie’s day nursery being rather expensive – Sherlock would obviously offer to pay for it, if he thought John would accept it), so their time together has been painfully sparse.
“No. I’m done here. Obviously, this was done by someone who knew them intimately, and not a random intruder. I would look into any adult children, if I were you. One of them is sure to have some traumatic experience involving a family dinner. My guess would be the son,” Sherlock gestures towards a table that holds a number of family photos. “There are several photos of the two daughters, but the son only appears in a few group photos, indicating that their relationship is estranged, maybe even hostile. Thank you, Gareth!” And with that, Sherlock stands up and strides out of there.
“Oh,” Greg considers this revelation for a while before finally asking: “And how’s that a problem? She married? Or does she have a tall, burly and very jealous boyfriend?”
“Alright there, John?” There’s a soft thud as Greg sets something down in front of him. John looks up. Coffee. Thank God.
When, after a few more moments, I feel like I’ve regained control of my limbs, I stand and take a step towards him. I hold out my hand. He looks from my outstretched hand to my face, his expression changing from puzzled to curious. Then he hesitantly takes my hand and I pull him to his feet. We are standing so close I can feel his rapid breaths against my face.
He'd never dream of admitting that really, every second that John isn’t there, he misses him terribly, and the only reason he didn’t text him immediately was concern about waking him up, because he knows Rosie doesn’t always sleep well, and therefore John desperately needs the extra hours of uninterrupted sleep he is able to get when Rosie is away. Lestrade thinks it is simply a question of practicality – why would he text someone whom he knows to be sleeping? It probably wouldn't wake him anyway. But it might. He couldn’t risk it. He would also never admit that his heart skips a beat (
And once again, he doesn’t need John’s help. Of course. Still, John decides to sit around in Greg's office and wait for Sherlock to finish, as he has done so often before, because that’s what he does, isn’t it? Because he is either stupid or insane or quite possibly both.
Oh, and I tried to do a thing with the format of the text messages. If it looks horrible on your particular device, feel free to let me know as well!
I think of some of the countless times someone has mistaken us for a couple. I always get annoyed and protest. Sherlock, I suddenly realise, never says anything. Sherlock, the obnoxious arsehole, who usually loves correcting people when they’re wrong, and who doesn’t care if he hurts anyone’s feelings in the process. Never a word.
Sherlock doesn’t answer, simply frowns and turns his attention to one of the computers that are humming quietly from a line of small cubicles along the back wall. After a minute or two, he realises that Lestrade is still there.
“Chemistry?” John scratches the back of his neck and feels a flush of pink rising to his face. “If by chemistry you mean regularly wanting to strangle him, I guess you’re right.”
He looks at the list for a moment, pensively chewing on the end of the pen. Then he changes his mind and strikes out
When the coffee is ready, I go back outside and look both ways. And there he is, standing a little way down the sidewalk, typing something on his phone with knitted brows.
“You haven’t. I should be thanking you for reminding me that this was an ill-conceived idea from the start.”
He feels a pleasantly surprised smile spread across his face. This is progressing much more successfully than expected. John is surprisingly chatty over text - Sherlock hardly has to put in an effort. Should he push further or wait? He decides to try:
I blink frantically to readjust my vision. Sherlock is looking down at his own hands, which are folded in his lap.
John still feels like he needs to make completely sure, which compels him to send off another string of panic texts:
Sherlock bites his lip. Then he looks down again and says: “You, on the other hand, seem to have had no trouble coming up with an abundance of disadvantages of being with me. And therein lies the problem. I am not a good choice. I will hurt you, and I will let you down.”
John thinks. He had reached a point where he was almost prepared to promise her anything if she’d just stop crying, so a glass of juice and some biscuits seems like a small price to pay. With a sigh of relief, he gets back up, and turns around to push her the last few metres to their front door, but in the process almost bumps into someone.
Sherlock frowns. John knows he rarely thinks about such things. So he reminds him. John is considerate; Sherlock (mostly) isn’t. But John doesn’t mind. He just reminds him. Sherlock is learning, though, as evidenced by his concern for John’s sleeping pattern. John makes him want to be more considerate.
. I simply added John and myself to a certain group chat that quite frankly concerned us, so I think we have every right to be involved in it.”
Sherlock shrugs and runs a gloved finger along the edge of the table, watching carefully to see if anything sticks to it. “It probably isn’t. We were just having a casual conversation.”
Sherlock smiles too. “Several. But I need more data. First, we need to find out exactly how many mummies we are talking about.” The case isn’t even all that exciting, but the look on John’s face and the opportunity to impress him is, as usual, rather motivating.
Sherlock, wherever you are: Do you know that you’ve completely ruined me for everyone else? Do you know you’ve broken me - maybe beyond repair? I had hoped it would get better in time - that doesn’t seem to happen. I have a therapist who tries to get me to talk, but I refuse. I only tell her about the things that don’t really matter.
“You didn’t think I would what? Take it so bad? God, for a genius you really are thick. I was forced to watch my best friend commit suicide! You were dead, Sherlock; I saw you die! How would you have felt if
John hears Greg say goodbye to Sherlock and leave. Then, a few minutes later, a single message ticks into the group chat with a low
“DAD!” Rosie is raising her little arms, and Sherlock scoops her up from the pushchair and perches her on his hip.
John considers this. “Well, I’ll try not to… But Sherlock… This is insane. No one can be that perfect.”
“Of course, I do, you berk. I’m upset. And I’m angry with you. I probably will be for a while, but not forever. I mean… I’m also glad that you’re not dead, you know…” I swallow. Then I sigh. “The truth is that the world just seemed so frightfully bleak without you. There were days when it was hard to see the point in going on.” Now none of us are looking at each other.
“Sherlock,” Lestrade lowers his voice as a pair of constables walk by, and he sounds quite serious. “Mate, you need to be a bit nicer to John, alright? He’s… well, you’re lucky to have him, you know.”
We do. Sherlock is drenched. Even after the few seconds I was outside in the rain, my jacket and jeans are dripping, and my shirt underneath is damp.
So of course, he texts Sherlock an affirmation, hurries to finish his coffee and goes straight to Hampstead Heath to most likely spend the entire Saturday combing through the grass and ponds for disembodied fingers, ears and God knows what else.
Greg just shrugs. “Whatever you say. You definitely know him better than I do. But have you considered that
John continues to reply to his texts in a way Sherlock can only interpret as approving, and both the frequency of texts and the level of flirtation contained within them have been quickly and steadily increasing over the past few days.
The day progresses more or less exactly the way John would have predicted: They scour an area roughly the size of ten football fields for body parts and clues. Sherlock is ecstatic, alternating between whooshing, dancing and marching around the crime scene, showing off and being – in John's eyes – absolutely magnificent (and in the eyes of the majority of the assembled representatives of the Met, a right pain in the arse).
I wait for another few minutes, and then I can’t take it anymore. I get up and grab my jacket, then quickly go to knock on Mrs Hudson’s door to ask her to keep an ear on Rosie, who is asleep in my bedroom upstairs. She doesn’t mind, of course.
John Watson is frustrated. It’s Friday night, he’s at the pub with Greg, and they’re supposed to be having a few pints and a good time. But John is frustrated. He sighs into his pint for at least the twenty-seventh time that evening.
“Oh, please,” Sherlock says in his most annoyingly Sherlockian voice, finally leaving the microscope and walking towards him. “You’ve been on edge all afternoon, you are unusually concerned about losing our reservations, and you have been toying nervously with that ring box in your pocket for over an hour. Doesn’t take a genius.”
I frown. I search his face, which he is clearly trying his best to keep calm and expressionless. But I do see a glimmer of pain behind his eyes. I take his still-outstretched hand and let him pull me up and off the ledge. We stand for a moment, uncomfortably close, before I let go of his hand and take a step back.
. Too polite? Too out of character? He hopes John won’t get too suspicious. Or think that he’s been kidnapped and is trying to send some sort of hidden message through coded compliments. He thinks for a moment then decides to just go with it, and types out a response:
Sherlock redirects his attention to the mummified, fingerless palm in front of him, carefully trying to remove a small sample of tissue, and about ten minutes later looks up to see John and Lestrade walk swiftly towards him.
He puts a pin in that and stores it for further investigation in the ever-expanding John-area of his mind palace, because right now, he has the Met’s entire database at his disposal for a whole hour, and there are several things he wants to look up, missing mummies being just one of them.
John goes back to work and spends the next couple of hours more than a little distracted, as his brain keeps offering up ways in which Sherlock might want him to reciprocate, and frankly, it’s positively dizzying.
“Clearly not.” Greg smiles and so do John and Sherlock. “I'm glad to see it all worked out in the end.”
Sherlock makes his face go completely blank and unreadable and presses his fingertips together. “I have just come to realise that you and I are… incompatible.”
“Oh, no. I’m just highly irrational and make decisions motivated solely by emotions.” He smiles, and Sherlock’s smile widens too.
want to hear. They want me to tell them how he tricked me and took advantage of me. But I won’t give them that. No matter what anyone says, I refuse to believe that he lied to me. I refuse to believe that the time we spent together could have been one big lie. I cannot believe that, because I’ve seen too much evidence that he really
him, which is of course equal parts insane and embarrassing. Nothing noteworthy happens all morning, and around lunchtime I conclude that Sherlock actually for once must have decided to respect my boundaries and left me alone as I told him to. Then I’m immediately proven wrong, as I get a text:
Sherlock still isn’t moving, doesn’t even reach out to receive the jacket from John’s outstretched hand.
Inspired, he opens the Notes-app on his phone, and starts making a list. He quickly runs into an issue, however: He has a very hard time coming up with a lot of disadvantages of being with John. Which should have been obvious from the start. However, Sherlock feels that on a pros and cons list there should at least be a semblance of balance between the two. He’ll have to think of something.
A very short message, that shouldn’t have taken that long to type, but the delay also wasn’t long enough for him to have dealt with a patient. Had John been debating with himself whether or not to send it? The thought is strangely exhilarating. This experiment has potential, or, at the very least, is unexpectedly exciting.
. Just being around him, putting up with his annoying habits, listening as he played the violin, having tea and just talking. I don’t tell them how close we were. That I’m probably the only person he’s ever allowed to get that close. I don’t tell them that despite his flaws he was genuinely the best man I have ever known. I don’t tell them that in all probability, he saved my life; that I was pretty much at the end of my rope when I met him - a PTSD diagnosis, a psychosomatic limp, occasional suicidal thoughts - and
Just to be absolutely sure, he scrolls through her old text messages. Just as he remembered: Too much. He needs to start subtly, and then slowly apply more force if necessary. Scrolling through her texts does give him an idea, however. He and John have already been texting a bit back and forth lately, and the texts have already taken on a rather playful tone on occasion. There must be a way in which he can weaponize that.
the texts. John doesn’t bring it up, so neither does Sherlock. He needs to make absolutely sure he’s not misinterpreting anything - he senses that there’s a lot on the line. Additionally, Sherlock really hadn’t expected his experiment to take off the way it has. He really just wanted to figure out if John really had feelings for him, but now it’s slowly but steadily heading towards a point where actually addressing those feelings might be inevitable.
He moves closer again, holds up his own list for Sherlock to see, crumples it up in his hand and throws it away without looking at it again. Then he grabs hold of Sherlock’s face and kisses him very softly.
“You should care.” Sherlock is back to looking stubbornly defiant, his eyes flashing forebodingly, and his mouth pressed together into a thin line.
John runs into his ex girlfriend, Jeanette. Sherlock comes to his rescure (in a sort of unexpected way).
Sherlock sighs. Why do people always ask him to explain the most trivial and obvious things? “I have carefully observed and mapped his sleeping pattern for years. He was at the pub last night – with you, I believe – and Rosie is at Molly's. Assuming he is following his regular sleeping pattern, and hasn't set an alarm clock, he won’t be waking up for at least another hour. So as I said: No point.”
In reality, Sherlock doesn’t mind this particular disturbance. Strange that. But he can’t help it. Because it’s true - he does love John. And he loves John’s texts. He loves texting him back. He loves their bickering and their in-jokes and the anticipation of waiting for a reply. It’s pointless and it slows him down, and normally he would detest that. Sherlock prefers texting because it’s fast and efficient, and you don’t have to waste time listening to pointless chitter-chatter. But when it comes to John, the rules of the universe often seem to somehow change completely.
“Yeah, I guess it does.” John shrugs. They look at each other for a moment, and then Jeanette does something unexpected: She smiles - a real, genuinely happy smile - and puts a hand on his arm.
Sherlock, of course, doesn’t apologise when he finally catches up with him. He is completely absorbed in looking through the police databases based on something or other he apparently found when looking at the samples from the crime scene and muttering about mummies and Egypt.
Jeanette admits defeat and turns back to John. “She really is adorable. You’re doing well, I take it? Married?”
In a few quick, long strides I cover the distance between us. I hand him his coffee, and with my now free hand, I reach up, curling my gloved fingers around the nape of his neck, and kiss him. We don’t usually kiss in public - not because we’re embarrassed, we’re just both rather private people, and we’re acutely aware that despite the interest that certain tabloids have taken in everything we do, we have managed to keep our relationship out of the public eye so far - but I just can’t help it. It’s not a particularly long or passionate kiss, just the light pressure of my lips against his, his mouth feeling warm and soft and comfortable. As I draw back a bit, he lets out a small sigh, visible in the frozen January air.
happened, and everything changed. And I don’t tell them that since he died, nothing seems to happen to me anymore.
“No! John, stop.” Now it’s Sherlock who grabs John’s shoulders and finally looks him in the eyes. “Don’t you see, you have it the wrong way around? I could never be good enough for
John rushes up the front steps and opens the door, only to immediately come to a halt as he almost bumps into Sherlock, fully dressed and with his bag in one hand, the other hand outstretched, just missing the doorknob it had been reaching for.
He hesitates. I think I see sadness flash through his eyes, but only for a second. “I- uhm… No. It didn’t mean anything.”
John doesn’t answer right away. It’s one of those breaks that Sherlock has come to know means that either John has had to put his phone away, or he is carefully considering what to write. Then:
John feels Sherlock shift restlessly next to him. He knows that this kind of polite social conduct isn’t his cup of tea, and that he probably just wants Greg out of their hair as quickly as possible. But John feels like they owe it to Greg to at least be a little nice to him. Luckily, though, Greg says:
John snaps his head around and stares incredulously at Greg. “Oh, fuck off! How? How could you possibly know?”
I used to hate him for being dead. Now I hate him for being alive. I hate him for everything he has put me through, for leaving me, for coming back, for thinking he can just reinsert himself into my life after he has completely and utterly broken me. And I hate myself for letting him do that to me, and even more for wanting - deep down - to forgive him.
“I believe I just told you not to be ridiculous, Gerald. Caring is not an advantage, and I do not waste my valuable time with trifles like that.”
“Shit.” John collapses, forehead first, onto the bar in front of him and stays there. “Why do I like him so much, Greg?” he groans.
“Is that strictly necessary?” Sherlock drawls. John punches him lightly on the arm and bends down to take Rosie from him. To his surprise, Sherlock grabs hold of the front of his t-shirt and kisses him briefly on the mouth before handing over the toddler.
They text each other regularly throughout each day. There might be long pauses because one or both of them are busy, but it’s never awkward or uncomfortable. The conversation just seems to pick up exactly where they left it.
They look at each other for a long moment, John bewildered, Sherlock beaming. “So, uhm,” says Sherlock after a while, his smile wavering slightly. “You do still want to marry me, don’t you?”
Just then, there’s a knock on the door downstairs, followed by the sound of Mrs Hudson letting in a grumbling Greg.
He flops onto the sofa, folds his hands under his chin and enters his mind palace, just to have something to do, but it, too, seems to be malfunctioning. Behind every door he opens, there is John. John, John, John. Somehow, the sight of him is both blinding and deafening. Sherlock is consumed; devoured by emotions. And he simultaneously despises it and cannot get enough.
I tell people that he is my best friend. That I work on cases with him. That he is absolutely brilliant. That he is a genius. I tell them that he is infuriating, and arrogant, and charming, and hilarious. That he is truly fascinating to be around, and that I am honoured to be his friend and to be involved in his work. I tell them about our adventures.
Then they both burst out laughing, and Sherlock pulls him in once again, bending down and giving him a long, soft kiss. It is one of those perfect Hollywood kisses, where you can almost imagine fireworks shooting out of your head and a saccharine love song playing loudly in the background.
We look at each other. I rub my temples. “You know that I’m not very good at this kind of thing,” I say.
Disclaimer: I don't really know anything about mummies. Or police databases. Feel free to correct me, if I've gotten it egregiously wrong.
“Really? That was nice of him.” He turns to look at John. “Hi,” he says with the kind of fond smile that he reserves for John alone, softly brushing his fingers against the inside of John’s wrist and tugging gently at the edge of his sleeve. John smiles back and has to forcibly pull himself out of the spell that Sherlock, as so often before, threatens to put him under.
John spends about five minutes trying NOT to stare at Sherlock, who is bent in deep concentration over a very fancy-looking microscope, before deciding that this won’t do.
I smile a little sheepishly, but Sherlock doesn’t even miss a beat. He immediately removes his hand from my back and lets his face transition effortlessly into his “game face”, as he tells us all to come along, and walks across the street with long, determined strides.
John sighs and leaves the men’s room, feeling no better than he did before. He takes the longest possible way to the vending machine – Sherlock usually takes forever when he’s at the lab, so he isn’t in a hurry. Today, however, turns out to be an exception. When John returns to the lab, there is no sign of Sherlock. John rolls his eyes and sighs, then calls out a few times and has a look around to make sure. He soon discovers that Sherlock’s blazer, which had been thrown over the back of a chair, isn’t there anymore. So that’s it, then. He’s definitely gone. John checks his phone, just to be sure, but as expected, there are no messages.
“Oh, uuh,” Lestrade suddenly looks a bit embarrassed, scratching the back of his neck. “Well, me, Molly and Harry, if you must know.”
He’s not making a list. He won’t do it. It’s silly and childish and mean-spirited, and he won’t do it.
It's the morning after. It all seems perfect, until Sherlock discovers something that makes him doubt everything.
I tell people that he was my best friend. That I worked on cases with him. That he was absolutely brilliant. That he
John smiles apologetically. “Ah, Greg, come on. You know I have no control over him whatsoever, right? Anyway, I need to make Rosie some breakfast. And put on trousers.”
Then one morning, something does happen. I’m on my way to work when I pass a newsagent and catch a glimpse of a familiar face. I stop abruptly in the middle of Green Park tube station, causing a bit of a ruckus as grouchy morning commuters almost bump into me and are momentarily pulled out of their well-rehearsed routine as they are forced to move around me. I don’t really notice, though, because it really is Sherlock staring at me from the front pages of a number of different newspapers. “Sherlock Holmes Cleared!” one headline claims. Another reads “Deceased Detective Proven Innocent in Moriarty Case”. I am stunned. It appears that everybody else’s truth has finally caught up with mine, and I don’t quite know how to feel. I am happy, of course, that Sherlock may now finally be remembered the way he deserves to be. But it is also a sudden and stark reminder of what I’ve lost.
He has been meaning to ask Sherlock about the texts, he really has, but he’s afraid to, in case it makes him self-conscious, and he stops doing it. Sherlock certainly doesn’t bring it up. So, John doesn’t question it; doesn’t bring it up either - keeps putting it off. There is also the possibility that Sherlock is doing some sort of experiment or trying to throw him off. If that is the case, he won’t give him the pleasure of having succeeded. So, he allows the texting to exist in its own little bubble, which doesn’t cross over into their real lives. At least for now. After a little while, that just becomes normal, and he stops even thinking about it.
“'Oh'? What, you didn’t know you were my best friend?” It’s meant to be sarcastic, but he doesn’t answer. And he doesn’t meet my eyes. The realisation hits me like a freight train, and I immediately soften a little. “Oh my god, you didn’t, did you? God, Sherlock… Of course, you… you were. And you still are.”
I turn to look at my friend, who is bent over some chemicals at the kitchen table and completely engrossed in whatever he’s doing with them. I walk over there and gently place a hand on his arm, which causes his entire body to give a surprised jerk, accidentally knocking over a couple of test tubes of… something.
The second time is better. There is a certain rhythm that they seem to pick up on. It’s less urgent. They take the time to map out each other's bodies and get to know their responses, their wants and needs. It’s all so new, and yet makes so much sense. Like this was what they were always meant to be doing, they were just too stupid to realize it.
He sighs and tears the list from the notepad, folding it up and sticking it in the back pocket of his jeans, before going to check on Sherlock.
“Incompatible?” Realisation hits John like a punch in the face. “Oh, okay. So, what, it’s because I’m not… I’m not good enough for you, is that it? I mean, I guess I can’t argue with that. Who could possibly live up to
in fact telling the truth; John likes him. Sherlock is excited about this, but also very uncertain as to how to proceed. So, he doesn’t bring it up, and every day he is simultaneously relieved and disappointed that John doesn’t either.
Almost done with the next "real" chapter, so I'll have it up here soon-ish, I hope! Maybe later today...
I don’t say anything. I just stare. And if I’d been a bit more myself at that moment, I would probably have noticed that quite a few other people are staring too.
John has often tried to imagine what his first time with Sherlock would look like. He always imagined it would be in their flat (even though it’s been years since he lived there, that’s how he still refers to it in his mind); in Sherlock’s oddly cluttered bedroom, or maybe even on the rug on the sitting room floor or on the kitchen counter, if he was feeling especially adventurous.
). The truth is that if John could just be there all the time, Sherlock would feel much better. But Sherlock isn't thinking about any of that. Obviously not. Not at all.
They fall asleep naked, every part of their bodies tangled up in each other, John’s face buried in Sherlock’s hair; Sherlock’s fingers lazily drumming some unknown melody against John’s shoulder. The last thing John is aware of before falling asleep, is thinking:
Sherlock. What did he do at school, in uni, in Afghanistan without a gangly, curly-haired genius by his side, to fill his life with excitement, weirdness and mortal danger? Somehow, now, his entire life before Sherlock seems to just have had the purpose of leading up to the moment he stepped into the lab at Bart’s and met him for the first time.
That last one throws me off. He’s never said or written anything like that before. I’ve honestly reached a point myself where I miss him so desperately that I’m almost ready to throw my own pride and sense of self-preservation overboard and just give in.
John also couldn’t have imagined that their first time would be clumsy or awkward. He never considered the fact that neither of them really knows what they’re doing. That for every “oh God, yes" there's an “ow! My arm!", or a “could you just move your knee?”. At one point they only just manage to keep themselves from rolling off the bed. It’s not that it’s bad – it’s actually just as fabulous as it’s hilarious. Afterwards, they fall back on the bed in fits of giggles because the whole thing is just so ridiculous and ungainly and amazing and improbable, all at the same time.
After a few days, Sherlock is forced to acknowledge that his examination of John’s emotional state has been inconclusive at best. He doesn’t understand. He’s never had any trouble reading the kind of physical responses which indicate infatuation or physical attraction. But with John, it seems like he can never be sure. Of course, he can’t just go ahead and feel his pulse at random - John knows his methods and is not a complete idiot, so he would notice. When, in the past he has had a chance to take John’s pulse, there have usually been at least one or two other reasons for it to be elevated - usually having just survived some life-threatening ordeal - making it impossible to come to any valid conclusions.
John looks up at Sherlock just in time to see him roll his eyes impatiently. “Yes, Lestrade. I suppose you’re a slightly better detective than I gave you credit for. You’ve found us out. Nice of you to stop by. Was there anything else?”
He will need to investigate further; he must pay very close attention to John’s physical responses from now on. Of course, he could just ask John about it. But then it wouldn’t be a puzzle; that would be cheating.
“Come on!” Greg grins. “You two have always had this thing going on between you, right? Long stares, little in-jokes, lots of chemistry…?”
About five months after his return, I move back in with him. We try to rationalise it, arguing that it’s easier to work on cases that way; it’s cheaper; I’m always over there anyway; it’s closer to the surgery where I work. We both know that really, it’s because we miss living together and we don’t want to be apart more than necessary, but we don’t say it out loud. We don’t have to. We both understand what lies beneath those rationalisations.
To John’s great pleasure, Sherlock utters a mixture between a gasp and a moan and immediately pulls him even closer to kiss him again. “I like that second option. Let’s do that first!” Sherlock breathes against his lips. John is not about to protest.
have become a pretty integral part of that work at this point? Besides, he might have changed his mind - I mean, before he brought you along, if someone had told me Sherlock was going to get a best mate that would follow him around everywhere, I would have laughed in their face.”
Greg is waiting for him when he gets off the Overground. He gives John a look but is smart enough not to mention last night. Instead, he just fills John in on the case, which is definitely an odd one.
“Yes. Yes, it absolutely is. If you’ve got cold feet - if you don’t want… this, or if maybe I’ve completely misinterpreted everything. That’s alright. I’ll respect that. But I think I deserve to know why you suddenly can’t get away fast enough the morning after sleeping with me.”
Sherlock’s face changes rapidly from defiance to utter confusion. The conversation is obviously not going the way he was expecting. “You’re not angry with me for reading it?”
As I’m leaving work one day, Sherlock texts me to meet him at a coffee shop near Hyde Park. We were at Kensington Gardens a few days ago to look at a crime scene, and apparently there’s something that he wants to check out - and get a coffee on the way. I’m not one to protest - it’s unusually cold, even for January, so if I’m going to trot around in the snow, I’m going to need something to warm me up.
I pour the dirty water into the sink and carefully throw out the broken glass, while he makes the tea.
With what seems like an extreme degree of self-control, John then pulls himself out of the haze and checks his watch. “Shit. I wish I had done this before. Now I really have to go. I'm so sorry.” He touches Sherlock’s hand.
Sherlock is both excited and a little worried about the success of his texting experiment. He doesn't really know where to go from here. Greg tries to help (despite the girls telling him not to).
John turns his head in the direction Rosie is looking and indeed there is Sherlock, just turning a corner and walking swiftly down Baker Street, his steps long and his coat billowing dramatically behind him. John can’t exactly decide if he is relieved or horrified to see his boyfriend at this particular moment. But it doesn’t really matter, does it? This is happening whether he likes it or not.
“John! Turns out it isn’t murder at all. The body parts don’t belong to murder victims, at least not ones recent enough for it to matter. They’re mummies, John! Egyptian, I believe, but I’ll have to stop by the lab to be sure. How the entirety of Scotland Yard was unable to spot the difference between recently mummified remains and those of a 3000-year-old mummy is beyond me - apparently their idiocy has reached a new low. No museums in the area have reported any missing mummies - I have obviously checked already - so they must have been imported, I assume illegally, and somehow ended up here. Something went wrong and whoever the culprits are desperately needed to get rid of them, so broke them into pieces and scattered them.”
“Oh, come off it. You just sort of… go together, don’t you? I mean, I get it, he’s a good-looking bloke, and all… A bit mad, though…”
This makes John jerk his head up again. “No, he doesn’t! He absolutely doesn’t. Come one, Greg, it’s Sherlock we’re talking about!”
was the single most important entry on that list, and you’ve conveniently chosen to ignore it. Yes, there are plenty of reasons why we shouldn’t be together. But it must count for something that I don’t really care about any of them, right?”
Sherlock smiles at the entire concept that is John; a concept which has been vastly expanded in his mind over the past twelve hours. The memory of John sleeping with him (both in the literal and the - eh - biblical sense); the thought of John waking up next to him, John kissing him (he suddenly seems to remember a soft kiss behind his ear at some point, which didn’t quite wake him up); John sneaking out, careful not to stir him; John apparently missing him only moments after leaving. John continues to be perfect in every sense of the word. And Sherlock misses him too, already, even though he knows it is utterly irrational.
He scrutinises Sherlock for another moment before he leaves. Despite his categorical dismissal of Lestrade, Sherlock is feeling utterly puzzled. It can’t be true, can it? Is Lestrade just messing with him? Is it some kind of joke? Maybe retaliation for…
and heads out, still debating with himself if he really wants to chase Sherlock around London when he’s probably not even noticed he's not there, or if he should just stick to his original plan and go home. Sherlock wins in the end, of course. He always does. So about five minutes later John finds himself in a taxi on his way to Victoria Embankment.
Sherlock turns his head to look, just as John emerges from the kitchen, as if he had somehow heard his name being mentioned (but he couldn’t have – they hadn’t been speaking very loudly) – or as if, somewhere, some force of comedic timing had stirred him to turn up just at the right moment.
There he is. Looking completely like himself; curly hair, dramatic coat, and all. And very much alive.
, Greg!” Sherlock repeats, as they enter a room to the left. Once inside, Sherlock corners Lestrade and tries to loom over him in a manner, that he hopes is intimidating.
Sherlock has moved back into our old flat - luckily, Mrs Hudson hadn’t been able to bring herself to let it to anyone else, so everything still is as we left it.
Anyway, as if that wasn’t enough, Sherlock has been texting him. A lot. Up until a few days ago, they’d occasionally have a short back-and-forth, that wasn’t necessarily strictly confined to the exchange of vital information, but this is something else. Dare he say that Sherlock seems to be… flirting with him? Some of their exchanges seem to be downright suggestive. Not that he minds. As a matter of fact, he’s pretty excited about it.
It takes us a while to get back to normal - or as normal as things can get when you’re living with a mad genius, who is also the world’s only consulting detective. But we do get there eventually.
He continues to lie awake for maybe 20 minutes longer. Still no incoming texts, and John finally manages to doze off. Meaning that he doesn’t see Sherlock's reply until he wakes up a few hours later:
As I leave work that afternoon, I don’t go home. Instead, I suddenly find myself once again on that rooftop. I can’t really remember how I got here, but I’m sitting on the ledge, not quite close enough to the edge to be in any real danger of tumbling off, but still close enough that I can peek over it and see the tiny people on the street below.
.” He emphasises the last word as if describing an entirely foreign concept. Then he smiles a small, triumphant smile as Jeanette raises her eyebrows in surprise.
“Oh, to hell with it,” John says quietly but determinedly. He takes two steps towards Sherlock, and without allowing himself any time to have second thoughts, puts a hand on Sherlock’s neck and kisses him.
Do I have feelings for him? Romantic feelings? I feel a flutter of butterflies in my stomach that seems to confirm as much. And the kiss? I look up from my hands and absentmindedly let my fingers brush over my lips. Yes, that had been surprisingly - confusingly - nice? No, really bloody great, actually. Shit.
Sherlock is no closer to figuring out if John really “likes” him, as Lestrade claimed (he may or may not have been enjoying himself so much that he forgot to pay attention - not good!), but he has once again managed to confirm that
I swear under my breath. This is all too much. All these confliction emotions are making my head spin. Either way, I cannot lose him again. I need to try to salvage our friendship, at least.
Knowing him, that does seem somewhat likely, especially if he’s upset. And then there’s the state of our relationship to consider. Can our friendship recover from this? I’d argue that we have certainly been through worse. But I have no idea how upset he is. No idea how much the kiss meant. Do I want it to have meant something? I sigh again - this is really not how I was planning to spend my evening.
Before Sherlock has a chance to answer, however, he hears the bedroom door open and close, and John’s voice sort of hazily call out: “Sherlock?”
Alright. He feels like he can do those things. He gathers from his research that it’s all about subtext and leaving subtle clues and then observe whether or not the other person picks them up. That really doesn’t seem that different from questioning a witness or interrogating a suspect.
Greg raises an eyebrow. Then he grabs a pen and places it on top of a pad of lined paper, which he then pushes across the table to John.
When people learn who my former flatmate was, they usually get curious. They ask questions, want me to describe him. Often, they have read my blog, but they want more. They want to know what he was like. I find that very difficult to answer for several reasons.
that he might have done that pissed Lestrade off? He can’t entirely rule it out - he can think of at least a dozen recent occurrences that might qualify - all completely unreasonable, of course; people are so sensitive.
As Lestrade takes him through the crime scene (the victims are an elderly couple killed by an apparent intruder in their small flat, but the strange part is that they have been propped up on chairs at the dining table and posed as if they were having dinner, food laid out on the table and everything), Sherlock’s phone gives off a series of familiar
Sherlock grabs his blazer and is off, already so wrapped up in deductions and possible outcomes that he doesn’t notice John isn’t there at all.
When John gets inside, Rosie and Sherlock are giggling at the kitchen table, which is covered in way too many sugary snacks. John would protest, but he supposes they deserve it after that performance. So instead of scolding them, he just smiles and bends down to hug Sherlock from behind, nuzzling his head against his shoulder.
Sherlock’s expression softens at the sight of John’s distress. “Sorry,” he mutters, wrapping his arms around John and pulling him close. “I was not going to say anything, but you seemed so nervous. I thought that maybe the evening would be more enjoyable with that out of the way.”
John has been woken up by the sound of muffled voices somewhere in the flat and decides to go investigate.
I realise that might not be the healthiest way to deal with your feelings, but that is what I’ve always done. I can’t just talk about my feelings; it doesn’t come naturally to me. Easier to just… not think about it. But now, for the first time, I really
John knows him too well. He probably should eat. Sherlock can normally sustain himself on coffee and nicotine patches for days on end, but he supposes something a bit more substantial might not be a bad idea, considering where this evening seems to be headed. Anyway, it’s something to do.
When John comes over, they will usually work on something for a few hours, and then say goodbye in the late afternoon, and continue the conversation they had been having over text, either immediately (if John is taking a taxi), or when John gets home (if he is taking the tube or biking; he has begun taking taxis more frequently, Sherlock notes).
I order two coffees to go – black for me, two sugars for Sherlock – and look out the window while I wait, in case Sherlock turns up. The snow is still falling thickly , and the sky is quickly darkening, even though it’s only late afternoon.
“I mean,” John looks at the list again. “How is it bad that I would die for you? Which yes, I absolutely would by the way.”
John makes a sound somewhere between a groan and an incredulous laugh. “For heaven’s sake,” he sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose, and closing his eyes to compose himself. “You’re not supposed to- to call someone out like that! You know that, right? Even if you figure it out, you’re not supposed to- oh, you’re such a fucking show-off, aren’t you? You just can’t help yourself!”
Sherlock stops short and frowns in confusion. “Eh, he’s right…” He stops talking as he turns to discover that there is indeed no short and easily-impressed sidekick in sight. Just then, he realises that John wasn’t in the taxi with him either. “Oh.”
Greg pats him on the back and tries but fails to suppress a burst of laughter. “The heart wants what it wants, I suppose.”
The next few days go by in much the same way: I force myself to go to work and endure the tedious stream of haemorrhoids, high blood pressure, allergies, backpain and so on. I go back home. I hardly eat. I sleep a lot. All the time, I have a feeling that I’m being followed, which I probably am. Sherlock keeps texting me; I keep ignoring him.
truth; what I know to be the truth. This truth does not correlate with the “official” story - what they’ve read in the papers or online. “Suicide of Fake Genius”, the headlines said when he died. That’s what people
I definitely don’t tell them that I think I might have loved him. That I think I still do and probably always will. Not in the way you’re thinking of - at least I don’t think so. We did seem to fit together in a way that I’ve never experienced before or after. The word soulmates comes to mind, although I’m not sure that’s what we were either. But he did feel like a part of myself that I had been missing all my life, and now that he’s gone, it feels like I’ve been torn in half. Whatever that means, I choose to call it love.
He looks at me with an odd expression, then nods and shuffles off towards his room. I run upstairs and throw on some dry clothes too, careful not to wake up Rosie.
I pretty much have the rest of this story written out by now, so the last few chapters will be coming over the next couple of days. :)
“Sorry,” John laughs, scratching the back of his head. “She just threw a bit of a tantrum. She’s not usually this quiet.”
Several things happen: Something akin to an electrical current runs through Sherlock, making him momentarily tremble. After a second, Sherlock comes to and starts kissing him back, placing a hand on each side of John’s face and softly pushing him backwards, pinning him against the door. There are lips and tongues and teeth and gasps, and it’s a bit clumsy but also pretty damn amazing. It is everything that John has ever wanted, and yet not at all enough. He knows that this kiss will be etched into his memory for the rest of his life. He also knows that if he doesn’t break it off now, he isn’t going to be able to leave.
Thank you to everyone who read along, and especially to those who left comments. It really means the world to read them. <3
It was just supposed to be a tiny, little thing, but it sort of spiralled out of control and became more akin to a fully-fledged chapter. Enjoy!
When Sherlock kisses John, John pushes him away, but quickly realises that he needs to examine both his own and Sherlock's feelings.
And that’s another thing. When people ask me about Sherlock, I never tell them what they want to hear - what they expect. I tell them the truth. Or at least, I tell them
When I have cried so much that there are no tears left, I force myself to stand and stagger to the bathroom. I avoid looking at myself in the mirror as I splash cold water on my face. I stand still for a while, holding on to the edge of the sink for dear life. The room seems to spin and blur around me, and I feel sick. I just have time to throw myself across the tiny bathroom and vomit violently and repeatedly into the toilet.
Sherlock looks around him for something to pass the time, but suddenly nothing seems interesting or important. He goes to the bathroom and takes a very long shower, which mostly consists of standing with his eyes closed, his forehead leaned against the cool bathroom tiles and letting the slightly too hot water drum against his back.
a relief to have the proposal out of the way). He puts down Sherlock’s ring box, and then kisses him again, pulling him even closer than the first time and sliding his tongue deeper into Sherlock’s mouth. Mid-kiss, he grabs Sherlock by the waistband and pulls him towards the sofa. Once there, he lets himself tumble down and drags Sherlock on top of him.
He then says something that takes me by surprise: “John, no one has ever cared about me like that. I didn’t understand that. I suppose I thought, in time, you would just forget about me and move on.”
I place a hand on his chest and gently, but determinedly, push him away. “Please,” I hear myself whisper from somewhere far away. “Don’t…”
“Sherlock? We’ll miss our reservations.” John pulls on his jacket and shoots a look over his shoulder. Sherlock is still staring into his microscope, not moving a muscle.
look means, but it involves an almost indistinguishable crease forming between blue eyes - or are they green? - that seem to almost pulsate with intensity, and it always makes me feel like I’m being nailed to the spot and X-rayed. “Woops, sorry,” he mutters, and takes a step back, still not taking those impossibly luminescent eyes off me. “Yeah, no, it’s- uh… fine,” I stutter. I feel uneasy, unsure what is going on; I feel a spark of something undefinable light within me. Once again, the moment seems like it won’t end, and this time there is no potential chemical hazard to distract us. None of us seem to be able to turn our eyes away.
Much against my will, a snippet of a conversation with Irene Adler from years ago suddenly rings in my head:
tried observing him without much luck. Flirting over text message will provide him with written replies that he can analyse at his leisure, without contamination from any other outputs. Clean, analysable data. Presumably. It’s worth a try.
So, he opens his laptop to do some research (he solved the mummy case already, and left the infiltration and apprehension of the smuggling gang that was behind it to the police, and the new case that Lestrade has asked him to look into seems rather tedious and requires him to look through an odious number of old cold cases, but he felt like he owed Lestrade a favour for telling him about John - there it is again, the caring lark, ruining his life. In short: He welcomes the distraction).
And yet, once again, there’s Sherlock, just casually slinking into his mind, completely uninvited, as if he owns the damn place. Come to think of it, maybe he does. John can’t help it. Just like he can’t help all the butterflies in his stomach, or the way his heart beats faster, or the high-pitched ringing in his ears.
The unbelievable magnetism that Sherlock has always held over him has reached hitherto unknown heights in the past few days. As if it wasn’t enough that he is already spending every unoccupied hour of almost every day with Sherlock - most days it’s the couple of hours between getting off work and having to pick up Rosie; the nursery teachers all hate him, as he is, of course, perpetually late, because you can’t just spend a couple of hours with Sherlock, now can you? To regain some goodwill, when a case seems fairly harmless - or when there isn’t one - he’ll pick up Rosie early instead and bring her along.
Greg grins and remarks how it should be illegal to be as sickeningly adorable as the two of us - Donovan mutters something about “sickening” being accurate. We all collectively ignore her.
“Mmh,” John sighs, as they both pull back a bit. He feels arousal bubble through his now much more relaxed body (he hates to admit it, but Sherlock is right - it
I feel like it could be a part of something bigger, but it doesn't really fit into anything that I'm currently working on. But I kinda like it, so I decided to post it here - maybe it will evolve into something bigger some day.
Then, after scrolling through the whole list, John frowns. “Yours isn’t finished,” he says, a little accusingly. “There are hardly any cons on it.”
They order way too much dim sum - especially considering the fact that Sherlock doesn’t really eat anything (he is working on a case, after all). He makes a bit of an effort, though, because he knows John doesn’t like eating alone, and so, he concedes to nibble on some shrimp dumplings. They eat sitting on the floor surrounded by files and takeout containers, drinking a bit too much red wine, making them prone to bickering and laughing, and making the otherwise tedious work seem at least a little enjoyable (but also a lot slower - Sherlock doesn’t really mind). It does feel just like old times, when they were still living together, and there is a sense of relief between them that they can still be together like this. It’s fun and effortless. Sherlock didn’t realise how much he missed this. And he had almost forgotten how John is seemingly the only person in the world that he can have this with.
I’m completely transfixed by the sight of him. Come to think of it, maybe he does. He usually knows almost everything, after all.
He rubs his hands over his face and shoots a quick glance to his side, smiling as he sees John, curled up on his side and sleeping soundly. Sherlock feels - for about the thousandth time in the span of just a few days - his chest burst with joy. He’s not sure he'll ever get used to this; he isn’t sure he wants to get used to it. The last few days have been absolutely marvellous. John and Rosie have basically moved into 221B. He never thought this level of domesticity and normalcy would attract him, but... it just feels so
“No. I’m angry with myself for writing that stupid list in the first place. And for not throwing it away immediately afterwards. I had actually completely forgotten about it.”
What will I even say to him? If he does pick up - or when he comes home? That it doesn’t matter, that we can just forget about it and move on? But can I do that? Is that even what I want? I take a deep breath and close my eyes, carefully letting those feelings bubble up to the surface again. Remembering all the little moments when I’ve stared at him for a little too long, because I just couldn’t take my eyes off him. The times our hands have accidentally brushed against each other, and it felt like a jolt of electricity shot through me. All those moments - when they happened - didn’t seem like such a big deal. They were so brief that I could always move on quickly and not think about them. But when they are all put together, they suddenly seem so overwhelming that they squeeze all the air out of my chest.
I haven’t forgotten how that embrace on the rooftop felt. And I haven’t forgotten the kiss in my hair. I also haven’t stopped loving him, although for a while I still don’t quite understand what that means.
The sight distracts me; I am distracted. And I ponder - not for the first time - how strange it is that I have become so attracted to him; I’m still not completely used to the notion of having a boyfriend. It really is strange, but - when he looks like he does in this moment - also oddly self-explanatory. He looks other-worldly; aethereal. Even if I wanted to look away, that would be impossible.
“Well, I’ll endeavour to do that more often, then.” We both laugh. We’re still standing wonderfully close, my hand resting loosely on the back of his neck, his hand - I suddenly realise - planted firmly on the small of my back. Our eyes are locked together, not noticing the snow which continues to fall all around us.
On his way to the vending machine, he stops by the men's room where he locks himself in a cubicle and immediately lets himself fall back against the door with an exasperated sigh. He is entirely too old to be this in love – it’s exhausting having to keep all those emotions in check all the time. He feels like a bloody teenager, and he doesn’t like it one bit. And to top it all off, he also feels like a complete idiot about the whole thing.
John comes to a halt right next to Sherlock. He places an arm around Sherlock’s waist, his hand coming to rest on his hip, and he senses more than sees a triumphant grin spread across Sherlock’s face. Actually, the two of them are both grinning from ear to ear.
He grabs his violin and plays Chopin’s Nocturne in C Minor five times in a row to calm himself down. It doesn’t work. He wonders, not for the first time that evening, how ordinary people do this. How do they bear this onslaught of emotion and anticipation that threatens to tear him apart from the inside? And why do they all want this so badly? It’s agony.
“Well,” John mutters between kisses. “I believe you have delayed my morning plans for far too long with your nonsense.”
I feel him press a soft kiss against the top of my head. I don’t protest - it doesn’t feel wrong or weird.
Sherlock is in the middle of composing a mock-outraged answer about the notion of being “posh”, when there’s another incoming text, which makes him abandon the one he was writing:
“Fuck you, Sherlock, you complete arsehole,” I finally say, willing my voice to be calm and steady despite the fact that I’m trembling. My hands are balled up tightly - I can feel my fingernails cut into my palms.
just a trick. That he’d looked me up and discovered everything about me beforehand. But I don’t believe that’s true.
The thing with Sherlock is, he has always somehow been able to convince John to do pretty much anything he asks. John doesn’t know exactly how that’s possible, but it’s like Sherlock possesses some sort of gravitational pull, which has dragged John completely into orbit, and even if he wanted to, he wouldn’t be able to escape. It was even like this long before… whatever this is. Although… John is honestly starting to doubt that there even ever was a before. Maybe he’s always been in love with him, he just didn’t notice until recently? Maybe that’s what the gravitational pull is? What he knows for sure is that over the last few years, Sherlock has managed to eclipse him so completely that he even has a hard time remembering a time
? As much as I hate to admit it - and I really, really do hate it - it took me much longer to start getting over his “death” than Mary’s. So what does that tell me? Am I even allowed to be thinking that?
My job has never seemed as boring or as utterly unnecessary as it does that day. I do my best not to think about him, but I just can’t help it. I keep expecting the patients to be him in one of his disguises, I even yell a bit at an elderly gentleman because I think it
They find Sherlock crouching at the edge of a car park, looking intensely at the remains of what may or may not have been a human hand. As they approach him, he springs to his feet and gleefully starts spewing out deductions and insults alike.
When I’m certain there can be nothing else in my stomach to throw up, I get off the floor once more. I brush my teeth, tentatively drink a bit of water, and drag myself to bed, suddenly incredibly tired.
. He considers for a moment if he should try to get in touch with The Woman to ask her for advice, but quickly decides against it. One, because she would probably find it all too amusing, and two, because what constitutes flirting to her is - in Sherlock’s opinion - incontrovertibly
Sherlock doesn’t have time to reply, because just then he gets another text, this time from Lestrade:
“You needed me to grieve. Didn’t you? You needed it to be real. For it to be convincing to everyone else? I can’t believe you! Two years, Sherlock! It was hell!” My voice has turned gradually louder and louder.
“Screw you, get it yourself,” John says, failing to sound truly upset. Sherlock, however, crosses his arms and doesn’t move. John sighs and grabs the blazer from the chair. “Here you go, then! Now can we go?”
I stare at him, trying to remain calm, but it’s difficult with everything that’s happening inside my body. It’s like the door that has been holding in all those feelings for so long has suddenly been flung wide open, and now everything is hitting me all at once like a tidal wave. Time stops. The world becomes blurry.
He takes a careful sip of the coffee, which is scorching and pitch-black, and sends Greg a cautionary look. “Don’t ask.”
“Yes. He does. And whether or not you like him back, I’d probably try to be a bit nicer to him, if I were you.”
I suddenly realise that I’ve stopped in my tracks; just standing there, cardboard cups clutched in my hands, staring at the tall, slender figure a few feet away. Snowflakes are landing gracefully in his hair and on his shoulders, the white of them standing out in sharp contrast against his ebony-dark curls and the black wool of his coat.
“Mrs Hudson let me in,” Lestrade explains. “She seemed to be in an unusually good mood, but wouldn’t tell me anything. I’ve been trying to get in touch with you and John for days – you had us all worried for a moment there.”
“No. No, nothing like that. It’s just that… Oh God, it’s so stupid! Why am I even considering telling you this?” John buries his face in his hands. He feels vulnerable. And put on the spot. And like a complete idiot.
I look up at him and realise that he’s panicking too. His eyes are now darting across my face, his expression confused and horrified. “Oh no,” he murmurs and swallows hard. We look at each other for another second, and then, before I can even begin to figure out what to say or do next, he turns on his heel and bolts out of the kitchen.
“Idiot,” I mutter. My cheeks are a bit wet. I think his are too. So much for being the good Englishman.
. They’ll have that concerned look in their eyes, they’ll pat me gently on the arm. They’ll pity me. I don’t want their pity, or their concern. I refuse to be “that poor John Watson”. The people who did know Sherlock pity me most of all, I think. They’re probably all thinking that there is no way Sherlock felt this strongly about me. That he didn’t feel this strongly about anybody. I hope that isn’t true, but I can’t really bring myself to care. I just don’t want them to look at me like I’m a wounded animal. So, I’ll straighten myself up and put on a brave face and keep my feelings on the inside like a good Englishman. That really isn’t that hard to do - I’ve had plenty of practise.
The handwriting is unmistakably John’s - neat and orderly in dark blue ballpoint pen on lined 70 gsm paper. It’s a list. Similar to the one currently stored in the Notes-app on his own phone:
“Yes, you are! You've seen mine, so I want to see yours. And yes, I realised how that came out the moment I said it, but I stand by it.” John gives Sherlock his most stubborn expression – knitted brow, set jaw – to tell him he isn’t going to let it go.
Lestrade sighs. “Look, John’s my friend too, and he… Well, I can’t exactly tell you. Just… keep in mind that it’s not always the easiest thing in the world, being your friend.”
Sherlock lets him go and takes a step back, crossing his arms and frowning stubbornly. “Well, you shouldn’t. And you know that.”
“But he can usually tell. Shitshitshit…” John is panicking. It’s all he can do to keep himself from hyperventilating.
“Ouch, oh, sorry, I didn’t- Jeanette?” John always seems to run into his exes at the worst possible moments. It’s almost like a superpower. In all fairness, though, he has dated quite a few women, so there are a substantial number of exes running around London, sharply increasing the risk of running into them at inopportune moments. There are times when you’d imagine it would be perfect to bump into your ex. When you’re walking confidently down the street in your best outfit, having a good hair day. Or when you’ve successfully rescued someone from a burning building. Having just made a tentative armistice with a short-tempered three-year-old, who has wiped her nose on the sleeve of your jacket, leaving a long and very visible trace of snot down your lower arm, your hair slightly dishevelled and your face flushed from panic, is not one of those times.
“Look, John, I wouldn’t worry about that. I think that Sherlock might have a bit of a… I don’t know - a blind spot, I guess? When it comes to you.”
John sighs again and rolls his eyes, really not in the mood for Sherlock’s weird little schemes, but then freezes when he sticks his hand into the pocket of the blazer and pulls out a small, square box, almost identical to the one still in his own pocket.
John shakes his head and takes a step towards him. “But I don’t. What I care about is that I’ve obviously hurt your feelings, and I hate that.”
John turns his head slightly, still without lifting it, looking at Greg out of the corner of his eye. “What kind of list?”
I’ve just finished rolling down the last of the blinds in the sitting room when my knees lose their bearing and I collapse on the floor. I allow myself to cry. I allow myself to pound my fists into the carpet in anger and to swear loudly and to curse Sherlock Holmes and the day I met him.
“Well, gotta dash.” John puts on his jacket. Sherlock has followed him to the door and is standing close by - not close enough for it to be uncomfortable, but close enough that John feels his heart flutter a bit. And then John, without really thinking about it, says: “I’ll text you when I get home.”
