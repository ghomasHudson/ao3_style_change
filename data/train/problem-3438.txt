Dean left the attic and got his girlfriend to leave before coming back up to the attic. When he returned Castiel was sitting on the fainting couch, his knees tucked up against his chest. “Hello Dean,” the ghost greeted, watching Dean as he sat on the other end of the fainting couch and stared at Castiel.
“I think you might not be the same Dean I know,” Benny mused, “did you hit your head? Are you feeling okay?”
“When do we meet this ‘Benny’ guy to get into the city tomorrow?” Castiel asked, brushing a hair out of Dean’s face.
“Yeah her name is Gabriel,” Dean muttered, smirking hotly. Standing up on his stomach, I stretched before walking over to his face and licking his nose, trying to tell him I’m hungry.
“Shh you’ll wake Cas,” Dean slurred, however to make it easier on you, the reader, I have translated Dean’s words to the best of my abilities. As it dawned on Castiel that his friend drunk, Dean kept riffling through Castiel’s underwear drawer, looking for the perfect pair of underwear to take with him. He pulled out a pair of rather ratty boxers, the kind that you walk around holding up but never seem to throw away before throwing it behind him like a petulant child.
“Castiel,” He grinned, my name on his tongue beautiful but bizarre, like something that was much more personal. And honestly it shot sparks to… you know
“You know I would.” Castiel promised, laughing when Dean sat up in a rush only to wince, “bend over and let me kiss it better.” Castiel sighed, smirking when Dean did as he was told. Smacking Dean’s delicious arse he went to work.
“I-I’ll go help him… meet you at lunch!” Gabriel said, saluting the blonde and brunet. He pranced out of the room to follow the fourteen year old, leaving Dean to suffer at the hands of Castiel.
“Y-you knew about that?” He asked, looking at Castiel, wishing he knew why he kept staring at his assailant’s face. His beautiful face, his mind unhelpfully added, causing him to blush.
Castiel was creepily watching the now eighteen year old Dean study; the human was doing his finals now and was applying for the nearby collage so he could stay close to home. He says it’s really just so he can definitely get one proper meal a week when he has dinner with his family. Castiel didn’t know the real reason behind Dean’s choice to stay close to home. All he knew is he didn’t want him to leave.
“No!” Dean cried, running into the kitchen, quickly followed by Mary who swooped down and picked up Sammy, bouncing him on her hip as she walked into the kitchen.
“What?” Castiel felt himself ask, not entirely sure what the question was as he stared into Deans eyes.
“Dean?” I asked, walking over to him and putting my hand on his shoulder, making him jump and with all the grace of a dead monkey, fall onto his butt. “Shit are you okay?” I asked, kneeling in front of him.
Three years passed so quickly, every day Castiel spent protecting the little boy, watching him take his first steps and listening to his first words. So when Dean turned to him and asked who he was, well he didn’t know how to reply. Firstly because he didn’t expect the child to be able to see him, secondly because how do you tell a three year old child you’re the ghost that has haunted his home since before he was born? So Castiel just smiled and sat in front of the little boy, “my name is Castiel,” he told the boy simply, “and I live here…” Castiel held back his cringe at the wording, technically he hadn’t lived in quite some time, but you don’t tell a small child that.
“Yes Cassy, you missed dinner,” Gabriel teased, ushering him towards the room of people. Dean watched him smile and hug everyone, licking his lips in the cutest way to try and return moisture to them.
“Fuck off Gabriel, I’m really not in the mood for you,” Dean muttered, brushing past the shorter man, and going through the door. But rather than going into his room he found himself on the street, the sun having risen enough to light up the city.
“Do I need to force you?” Castiel growled, rocking his hips and making Dean choke on the words he was about to say.
“You’re going to need a few days between fucks,” Castiel growled, repeatedly hitting Dean’s prostate then suddenly stopping and going at a slower pace.
“Get fucked,” I tried to curse, only to drop my head onto his shoulder and squeak in a very… manly… way, when he brushed against my prostate. Making more yelping noises each time he brushed against it, until it was a full-fledged scream when he smacked it with his head.
The next morning, Dean would wake up in Castiel’s bed, the other man would not be there when he woke up. Dean, who had shimmied out of his clothes in a drunken state somewhere between him passing out and him waking up, immediately thought the worst. He had not had a one-night stand with the love of his life whilst completely hammered, although his very painful brain did not remember the goings on of the previous night and had jumped to this conclusion because naturally waking up naked is going to set off some alarm bells.
“Please don’t hate me, if you want you can reject me and I will pay for you and Sam to go stay at a motel for the night,” Cas nervously spoke, his words speeding up with every other word but before he could continue Dean – the younger – kissed him.
And yet Dean doubted his eyes, mainly because he could see through the pair, and that was more than enough to tell any sane person that they were not really there, thank you very much. “I really need to check that bread’s use by date tomorrow,” Dean told himself before rolling his eyes and burrowing back into his bed, humming grumpily.
“Didn’t he say he only had one room?” Dean asked, raising his eyebrow. I blushed slightly, having had hoped he had forgotten that fact.
“Who says I’ll ever bore of you?” Castiel asked the teenager. Lifting his hand to brush the stray hairs out of the shorter man’s face.
“Why not?” Castiel asked, leaning against the wall, a smirk on his face. “I’m quite attached to Dean, hell, I volunteer to be the one to take him over the border to meet our ally Robert and have him take him back safely.”
“Give him a break guys,” Gabriel echoed, looking serious momentarily before a wicked grin spread across his face, “if it isn’t for Dean he won’t mind if we… I don’t know, look at it?”
“Sam,” Dean sighed, looking around to see his employees had quietly gone back to work making him exhale a aggravated breath, “come into my office.” Sam readily agreed to the offer, shrugging off his coat and flopping onto the couch by the fire whilst Dean returned to tidying up his things.
“You should stop and talk to Dean…” he told me. I looked at the younger boy. He was fourteen and nearly as tall as me. I could tell he was going to be taller than me by the time he was in a few years.
“Lil Cas, where do you think you’re going?” Dean laughed, holding me up to look in my eyes, laughing when I stuck my tongue out trying to lick his face. I mean he doesn’t know I'm me… perfect opportunity!
“And after losing your mother, after high school and then losing your father,” Crowley continued for him, looking saddened.
“Fuck Cas!” Dean cried, wrapping his legs and arms around Castiel, so that Castiel was closer, and harder. Bursting his load first with the next thrust, his orgasm causing his arse to spasm which made Castiel come in his lover. Riding out their orgasms together, Castiel pulled out and flopped  down next to Dean.
“I made a friend!” Dean cried happily, turning around and pointing to where Castiel sat. Mary looked concerned for a moment, but she clearly didn’t see Castiel who was watching the pair interact.
“To be fair yesterday all I did was give you a blowjob…” Dean teased, rotating his hips making Castiel hiss.
“I realised I have been a Jackarse,” Dean admitted, blushing a bit, “and I owe everyone an apology, most of all Cas.”
Castiel Novak was in the shopping district on December twelfth, looking for a gift for his adopted sister Anna; she was twelve years old and had asked for a doll. Not any doll however, a Winchester original, no two dolls were the same! Entering the doll maker’s shop he inhaled the smell of gingerbread that wafted around the room, grinning when he saw all the mothers in the shop, looking for the perfect doll for their daughters. Slowly, one by one, all the women filtered out with their purchase. Until Castiel was alone in the shop with a gorgeous blonde male and fifteen unpurchased dolls. “Hey, how can I help you blue eyes?” he asked, watching as Castiel looked at each of the dolls, getting disappointed that none of the beautiful dolls were red heads. He wanted a red head to cheer Anna up as she had been teased for her hair recently and was begging their mother to let her dye it.
“Guys! They’re saying Queen Mary is coming to get her sons back and join our side!” Charlie said, bouncing happily.
“You’re my guardian angel… minus the feathers,” Dean grinned. Castiel ‘slept’ in Dean’s bed that night. It was the first night in over a hundred years he actually slept.
“Yeah his name is Cas… Cast…” Dean told the woman, scrunching up his face when he couldn’t pronounce Castiel’s name, he turned to the ghost who smiled invitingly, “how do you say your name?”
“You have ears,” he pointed out, making me raise an eyebrow, only to moan lewdly when he rubbed one between his fingers.
“Yeah you couldn’t have had waited ten or so minutes to come down here could you?” Dean murmured, making Cas blush as he realised what Dean was insinuating.
“If I were bored of you, you would be going to a brothel not home,” Castiel told him, turning around to face Dean, “you’d probably love all the dicks you’d get up your arse.” Castiel smirked, stepping closer to the blushing kid.
“You came!” Dean beamed as soon as his mother had left, rushing over to Castiel and hugging him. Castiel inhaled the smell of the man in front of him, wanting to remember it whilst he was in Topeka.
“Say it again,” Castiel growled into Dean’s ear making the smaller male rock his hips and pull out a gasp from Castiel.
“Damnit Cas,” Dean breathed, staring into the oblivion that was Cas’ eyes until he felt a hand on his crotch again.
With his cock slathered in more oil than Castiel thought necessary, but he was scared of hurting the beautiful younger boy more then he realized at the time. Castiel pulled his pet onto his lap, high enough for his cock to be at the entrance of Dean’s arse. “Do you want my dick?” Castiel rasped, rubbing his cock through the smaller boy’s arse crack.
“Dean!” Castiel’s voice called out once more, Dean screaming in response as he was thrown across the floor, cutting his leg on a discarded hunting knife in the process and hitting his head against a wall.
“Get dressed, I will return in an hour for you,” he said curtly before walking out and locking the door behind him. Dean stared at the door, his mouth hanging open.
“I'm going to go get the doll I ordered for Anna’s Christmas present,” Castiel blushed, being more in a rush to see the man.
“Just tell him you want to go see what another auto shop is like, or that you want to do a business course in the community college in New York, he won’t object! And if he does Mary will probably hit him over the head!”
“Dean, he was probably be raped more than anyone else should be when people in jail found out what he was in for,” Cas told the bitter young man.
He awoke with a headache that could probably kill a grown man, let alone someone and thin and gangly as he was. He woke up dressed in only a pair of black, silk underwear with a see through material spanning down from it and up around his waist almost like a belt. It was not what he was used to. But they said this world was different from his. In the kingdom he lived every man had to wear trousers and cravats and all sorts of posh stuff. And the women wore full length gowns. Here however it was common to dress this way as they built their kingdom in the centre of a desert, so they cared not for the modesty his people had, and wore revealing outfits. However, those who did not wear these revealing outfits tended to work during the night, when the air is cold.
“Shit, I forgot gay didn’t always mean what I know it as… you’re a homosexual… am I right?” Dean asked his face slightly red. Castiel couldn’t speak, so he only nodded, looking down at the bedsheets. He was suddenly thankful that he couldn’t cry, because he would probably have tears streaming down his face. “You’re not an abomination Cas.”
“Shut up Sammy, my imaginary best friend is alive again, we’re allowed to be confused,” Dean said getting a mega bitch face from Sam.
“No promises,” Mary teased, kissing her son on the cheek and following the other parents. Dean wandered up to his room and placed me on his bed with a soft pat.
“Well this started at a depressing note,” Gabriel mused, watching Dean as he placed the large box back where it had come from, his hand resting on it a moment before he drew it back to his body.
“I’m not real Dean, but I think you know that already,” Castiel spoke slowly, opening his eyes and watching the horror dawn on Dean’s face. Even though Castiel was positive he was real, he had to let Dean go one day, and it looked like that day had come.
“My apologies Dean, I’ll be out of your hair in a moment,” Cas said, voices sounding outside the bunker, making Cas’ face to go white.
“Can’t you tell Mick?” Gabe laughed, walking over to me and pretending to swoon over me, “they’re in love.”
“Is this Lil’ Cas?” Mary awed, plucking me out of Dean’s arms to look at me. I just meowed at her and tried to squirm back to my hurt Dean. My Dean. Mine. I shook my head, realizing that I was getting possessive over him. Becoming more cat like.
“I could be your friend!” Dean cried happily, bouncing up and down, his toys that he had been playing with long since forgotten. Castiel smiled at the little boy and nodded.
“I get why Sam is miserable… but why are you?” I blurted out, earning a slap on the butt from Dean making me yelp.
“Yeah Cas?” the younger Dean asked, he was absentmindedly staring at Cas’ lips, his pupils delighted.
“Cas!” dean called out. I ignored it and headed towards the front door, saying goodbye to Sam who was sitting on the couch doing his homework. Sam looked up at me before getting up to speak to me.
“Yes, I actually have to close up now, but if you give me your number I can call you when the doll is done,” Dean smirked, pulling out a note book and pen from under the counter. After jotting his number in his overly beautiful writing, Castiel bid his farewell to the green eyed man, heading home.
“It’s not,” Gabriel’s voice called from the doorway, causing Dean to jolt up and look over. His face bright red. “I just wanted you both to know that when you’re ready to go save the kid… and hopefully get some new allies.” He threw some cotton clothes Dean when he heard this jumped off my lap and raced for the door.
“Sorry, I should get going, Sam will want dinner soon,” Mary sighed, kissing Dean on the cheek, “it was lovely meeting you Castiel.” And with that she left.
“He’s still a dick, I was ten,” Dean growled. Growling back, Cas sat up and pinned Dean to the table.
Castiel woke up the next morning to shouting. He wasn’t entirely sure what he was hearing because, honestly he felt groggy. Pushing himself off of Dean’s bed he walked towards the door, rubbing his eyes and yawning as he went to phase through the door.
“Do you have a name?” Dean tried, receiving no answer in return, “okay what should I call you if you don’t have a name?”
“It’s true! I am friends with him too Cas, I wouldn’t be forcing him to kiss someone he physically couldn’t!” she pouted as we neared the front ten people. I could see Dean kissing girls now, feeling my stomach knot in jealousy I knitted my eyebrows together in annoyance before seeing him look up and spot me, his face lighting up like the fairy lights that were wrapped around the archway above him.
“Cas?” a voice suddenly appeared outside before the door was forcefully opened and my eyes were greeted with Dean. I felt myself perk up, literally sitting up straighter as I watched him walk over to me on unsteady feet. Just managing to catch him when he tripped landing on top of me.
“Because he was lonely and I’m the only one who can see him!” Dean told them man in a matter-of-fact voice. Their conversation had gotten the attention of Mary, her parents and Ellen by this point.
“Gabriel!” I complained, first when he put me in the box. Again when he locked the front door, where I could see Cookie watching us from the window. Again when he rang the doorbell of the Winchesters. And a final time when he handed me to Dean.
“Dean-o! You’re awake! How was the ride here?” Gabriel asked the groggy boy, causing him to jump, and accidentally kick Castiel. But the man seemingly remained asleep.
“My fiancé and son.” Dean whispered, looking in the eyes of the man that he knew he had fallen in love with, whether he was honest with himself or not.
“With me and Gabe!” I suggested, thinking of my older brother who was currently in Law School over in New York. He had a spare room in his apartment that he had offered to me when I got into Cornell University. I was a third generation Alumni. Along with my three brothers who went there, making my chances high of getting in. Which I did, much to my father’s glee.
“No, how about you text me your address and I pick you up?” Dean smiled. Agreeing Castiel hopped into his car and headed for work. Excited for the night to come.
Castiel was there when John told Mary that Dean had been in a car accident. The two parents and their youngest left the house in a hurry, but they would not make it to the hospital before Dean passed. Castiel however, was waiting in the sitting room for them to return when Dean appeared. “Dean!” Castiel cried, jumping off the couch at the sight. Dean had literally appeared before his eyes.
“Because you pushed everyone away! You can’t deal with your own issues alone,” Death sighed, looking bored, “now I am going to send you to bed and when you awaken you will be fully rested and ready to go help Benny. Adopt that little girl. Fix things with the people in your life. I don’t actually care, but if I have to come back I will be the death of you,” as he finished his final words he began to fade away, along with everything else until the world went black around Dean.
“It was Benny’s idea,” he tried, scratching his neck. The next thing I know Michael is taking me out of Jo’s hands and looking at me, eyebrows furrowed in thought.
“Trust me he’s done a lot more than that, besides who said I enjoy this? You literally raped me!” Dean cried, squirming underneath the larger man.
“I am Cas!” I cried, jumping out of his hands and squirming under the couch, pulling out the diary I kept there.
“I didn’t think so.” Castiel smirked. In a flurry of movements the boys shed what was left of their combined clothing, panting as Dean gleefully coated Castiel’s prick with oil in slow, torturous movements before the older man pulled him up onto his lap, so that his cock was lined up with Dean’s hole. Pushing it in slowly at first, Castiel gave his lover the time to adjust before slamming the rest into him, making the green eyed man throw his head back in a gasp, allowing Castiel to attack his neck some more.
“Yes well because you’re a special case, the three spirits that will be visiting you tonight are people you actually know,” Crowley snickered, “but come along Dean darling, we have places to be!” Crowley disappeared from where he was standing in a blink of an eye, and just as quickly appeared next to Dean, guiding him into the closet. And yet as they stepped in through the doorway of Dean’s closet, Dean found himself in the middle of a snowy street.
“Well if the last gift wasn’t for Dean why did you hold it so long?” Lucifer asked, joining in on the teasing of his younger brother.
“I-I,” Castiel stuttered, blushing as Dean stepped back into his personal space, tilting his head up so green and blue eyes had no distractions.
“No I believe you were fucking my brother,” Gabriel’s voice chimed, making Dean’s face pale as Sam stared at him, “shall we have this conversation somewhere where the maids won’t go tell homophobes like your father?”
“Yes Dean, your saliva has made my dick grow,” Castiel growled, thrusting into the blonde on his lap who dropped his head into Castiel’s shoulder.
of December, he was about to make the dumbest decision he would ever make. Not only did it breech his friend’s privacy, but it was just an overall terrible, stupid and childish idea. On the 19
“Are you okay? You missed dinner.” Dean asked, sitting on the bed next to his equally beautiful husband.
“Even the cat thinks you should feed me,” Gabe pouted, raising an eyebrow I prepared myself to try and pounce onto my twit of a brother.
“Dean,” I said, stopping him before I lost myself, “W-we can’t, not here, there’s nothing to prepare ourselves with.” I told him, making him laugh, and kiss me.
“Who are you in love with Dean?” Castiel asked, looking down at a shaking Dean. Dean refused to look him in the eye, wiping away stray tears.
By the time Claire was safe, and Dean had spoken with her social worker, arranging a meeting to talk about adoption. He still had plenty of time to get to Sam’s and still be early. So he did, showing up on Sam’s doorstep with his hands in his coat pockets, a blush already tinting his face. The door opened a mere minute after he knocked, revealing the face of his younger brother, who blinked in surprise. “Dean?”
“Hey Cas, hey Dean… hey other people I’ve never met before… including a beautiful young woman…” Charlie began to blabber, stopping when she realized she had accidently called Lisa beautiful…
The girl was cowering behind Dean looking like she belonged in a fairy tale she was that pretty. But Dean, well Dean somehow managed to be prettier. He had shot up and was now taller than Castiel was, and his features had started to firm up… he was a very pretty boy and Castiel was disgusted at himself for thinking that way about another male.
“It’s not hallucination baby,” Mary’s voice soothed, a pressure appearing next to Dean on the bed and making him sit up for a third time, his eyes bright with fear. He slowly began backing away from her, falling off his bed onto the cold, hard ground in the process.
“Yeah, my mum used to own the place and taught me how, I guess it just became something I loved,” the man grinned, “I suppose you came for the doll…”
“So Cas is still missing… I guess I’ll have to go check our old hang out spots,” Dean sighed standing up.
“I’ve offered,” Gabe winked. Ewe! Gabriel! Wriggling my but I jumped onto his stomach making him exhale at the sudden weight of me on his stomach.
“I'm surprised that he hasn’t questioned Dean’s current predicament,” Gabriel smirked, winking at his brother who pulled Dean closer to himself.
“Lil Cas was the real Cas…” I yawned. Bored of trying to explain the situation I crawled over to Dean and grabbed him by the waist band of his pants. Already seeing the large bulge inside his jeans. “My point is, I feel the same way about you!” I purred, not entirely sure where this confidence came from. I began to unbutton the blonde’s jeans before unzipping the fly and removing them from him completely. Kneading his prick through the material of his underpants, I licked his inner thighs earning a gasp out of the blonde. Pulling the underwear down I licked from the balls to the head, savouring the salty musk that was Dean. Pulling away I sat back on the matrass and looked up at Dean, begging him to make the next move.
“Would you like me to kiss it better?” Castiel whispered in Dean’s ear, smirking as he noticed the boy’s face flare up. Taking that for a yes, Castiel kissed Dean once more before sliding his tongue down Dean’s neck making the blonde gasp. Thanking himself for not dressing the boy when he found him, instead just draping his own cloak around  him which was discarded when Dean was put in his bed. Leaving bite marks down from Dean’s jawline, Castiel sucked and nipped down Dean’s body, drawing delectable sounds from the shorter man. Playing with Dean’s nipples, Castiel sucked and pulled at them until they were perk before continuing to suck each and every available inch of skin on Dean’s stomach. Licking circles around Dean’s  belly button.
“After the show perhaps,” Castiel grinned, stepping away from Dean with a grin. Chuckling when Dean’s face shifted into a pout before he stepped closer and gave Dean a fleeting peck on the lips before running off to the hidden rooms built behind the stage.
“Will you be my boyfriend?” Dean practically begged, his spare hand cupping Castiel’s cheek with such softness that Castiel was sure he was dreaming.
“Why is such a young girl here?” Dean asked, looking at Gabriel who was now in the kitchen trying to eat the soup out of the pot and failing.
“Not at first, at first I didn’t want it, but I had no choice. Now… I don’t know.” Benny grabbed the boy’s wrist and dragged him to his bedroom, slamming the door behind them. Throwing Dean onto his bed, benny began to unbutton his pants making Dean’s eyes widen and scramble backwards, falling off the bed.
Mary stood there in all her beauty, her long blonde hair hanging messily, framing her face nicely. She was dressed in the same clothes she wore the night she died, a leather jacket and a white dress – blood stains still on the bodice of her dress. John also wore the same clothes he wore the night of his death despite it years after his wife’s, he was in the same clothes he had worn when he drunk himself to death three days before Dean finished high school. And by clothes Dean meant a singlet top and a pair of boxers.
“Where are we?” he asked quietly, shivering slightly at the brisk air as he looked at Crowley who was leaning on a black umbrella with a curved handle.
“Dean Winchester,” Charlie grinned from her place in the line for the girl. They looked out of place; as though they should have been in each other’s lines, but they were both of the few out gays in the school… actually they were the only ones.
“Have you met me?” Dean asked as Sam helped him remove his coat, “I bottle up all my feelings and insecurities until I take them out on random things.”
“That’s none of your business Sammy,” Dean’s voice resonated in my ears; I whipped around to see Dean leaning against the wall. In all his beauty. I felt my breath hitch as he stood up properly and walked over to me. I braced myself for a punch in the face. But instead I felt his hand on my face. I opened my eyes to find him staring at me. My breath hitched as I looked down to his lips and licked my own, before looking back at his eyes. Those beautiful eyes. I was so lost in them I didn’t even notice Sam coming over and smacking our faces together. We both pulled away and rubbed our faces before looking at the little shit. Who was backing away. “Run,” Dean told him, pulling me closer, his voice reverberating in his chest and making me shiver. He looked at me as soon as Sam had scampered off and smiled.
“Yup!” Gabriel confirmed, just as Sam came in chasing a secondary Gabriel who had a devious grin on his face.
“Well done Cassy,” Crowley’s voice purred as he pocketed his phone, “now you have two more shoots for today and then we’re done till tomorrow.”
“What the fuck Meg, you threw a virgin into my room and practically watched as I raped the poor child!”
“You didn’t understand me! I was a cat!” I pouted, looking up at him with the biggest eyes I could possibly force.
“Doesn’t he have agoraphobia?” Sam asked, raising an eyebrow, “why would he willingly leave the house?”
“Not bite, well I mean sometimes you can bite but sucking hurts a lot less…” Dean breathed, watching through his lashes as Cas blushed.
“I didn’t know he was a virgin, or at least not his arse, he’s too pretty to be anything else then a good fuck,” the woman said, looking at Dean who was curled up in a ball, sobbing his eyes out.
After the funeral Castiel was checking up on each of the Winchesters, finding both John and Mary passed out in exhaustion, and Sam was forcing himself to study though the pain. But after some quiet persuasion he was tricked into going to bed. Dean however was curled up on his bed, looking empty. “I’m dead.” He continuously muttered to himself.
“I want to make sure Sam is happy before I move on,” Dean muttered, his voice was quiet but Castiel understood. He could wait for Dean, as long as Dean needed him to.
This story starts on the twenty fourth of December, Christmas Eve and Dean’s restaurant was full of people with a lot of money to spend, he sat in his office doing his usual work as the smells from the various platters, the only sound being the clunks of dishes and cutlery as people enjoyed their meals.
“Both of you get in the car, this conversation is over. Castiel you belong to me, for another five years.”
“Crowley?” Dean asked, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, suddenly very conscious of his shirtless body. The man had often made passes at him when Dean had worked for him, but Dean just assumed it was Crowley trying to make him uncomfortable.
“Dean you’re ten years old, I think we need to talk about Castiel,” John told his son. Dean looked over at the ghost who just nodded and walked out of the room. However he didn’t go far, as to hear what John was telling his son.
“No you’re not, homosexuality has been proven to be natural, not a sin or a mental illness,” Dean pressed, “and even if it hadn’t, I’m no better! Because I’m in love with you Cas.” Castiel looked up at Dean with wide eyes to find Dean a blushing mess.
“My mum died when I was seven,” Dean told her, “and then my dad died when I started University – so I’m an orphan too.”
“I-I don’t know, I just thought it might feel nice inside your mouth,” Cas murmured, making Dean choke and blush again.
“I want to show you the doll I made,” Dean spoke calmly, pulling away from a slightly disappointed Castiel.  He dragged him over to the counter and let the darker haired male see the miniaturised version of himself.
“Good boy,” Castiel told the boy on his lap, moving his hands away from the younger’s arse to hold his waist. Dean, whose hands were holding him up a little bit more then he would be otherwise let his hands move to wrap around Castiel’s neck.
“Hey Mary, how’s Sam and Dean?” he asked, having a polite conversation with Mary before getting to the point, “Look I’m calling to tell you about the cat that Castiel brought home, you know as well as I that Michael told him no more cats… you want him? Okay I can bring him over as soon as you’re ready… you’re not home… oh I’ll just give him to Dean!… Okay just make sure he’s dressed this time. Bye”  Gabriel tossed aside his phone and grabbed his school bag, his detour meant he’d probably be late, but it was far from the first thing on my mind.
If you’re wondering how this story ends, well it ends with two people who truly love each other growing old together. having a family together. And when their time comes moving on to their next adventure together, hand in hand.
The now extended group snuck into the sewers, making their way along through the disgusting human waste to the only safe exit of the city.
I came out of my bedroom to see Claire opening the door. I hid slightly listening to the conversation. “Damn, Cas said you were hot, but I didn’t believe him!” the sixteen year old said, making me blush.
“I’ve learnt not to question Dean’s sex life… though it’s new to see him with a male who obviously tops him…” Sam said watching as Dean’s face reddened.
“Why weren’t you at school yesterday?” Dean asked, probably trying to calm me down as Charlie nudged me back under the arch, and as he stepped into my personal space.
It had been many years since John and Mary Winchester had passed away. And yet their greatest legacies remained, their two sons. Dean, the older of the two owned a five star restaurant; he was handsome and charming, twenty nine years young and fit despite his profession. Sam, the younger, was a junior associate at a large law firm with a bright future ahead; he was just as attractive as his brother despite the extra height he carried.
By the time they reached the border, Dean had cum about fifteen times, Castiel was surprised it wasn’t more, considering they were riding for four hours, and several times they were racing Gabriel. By the time they were at the border Dean had fallen asleep in Castiel’s arms, a blush still present on his face and his little friend still incredibly hard, the twins set up camp as the teenager slept off his many orgasms. “So what did you do to Dean to make him orgasm that many times?” Gabriel asked as he returned from getting wood for their fire, only to find Castiel with Dean in his lap, taking the butt plug out of the boy’s arse with a pop. “D-did you put a butt plug in his arse and make him ride a horse with it in?”
“Right, because that wouldn’t get you thrown into the nut house,” Sam teased, making both Dean and Castiel wince.
“No thank you, it was pleasant seeing you but you can leave now,” Dean told them, sitting back on his bed and staring at them with distaste.
“Benny I have never felt better,” Dean laughed, running a hand through his hair, “I’ve fucked up so much, and I need to repair anything I’ve ruined, or at least try.”
Mere seconds passed before Dean ran in after Gabriel who was waving his hand in front of the faces of various people, pointing when they couldn’t see him. “You’re the second ghost!” Dean cried, pointing his finger accusingly at Gabriel who looked at him and grinned cheekily.
“Like the owner of the shop… the Winchester bit I mean, I don’t know who owns the shop…” Castiel began to blabber.
“Cas kept a diary here… maybe it says what happened to him here!” he laughed, dropping to his knees and leafing through it. And he would have continued. If he didn’t get a phone call. “Sammy?… what happened?… shit wait there… Jess will be fine, the ambulance got her right? … I’ll be there in a moment.” Dean threw his phone onto the couch and ran out of the shack. Completely forgetting me.
“Cassy, I will be back momentarily, go get dressed,” Crowley tells me before they walk off, I walk with the makeup and wardrobe girls, and they help me into a regular appearance once more.
By the time I had rode out my orgasm Dean had already cum inside me, by the time he had pulled out he was too lazy to move me off his lap. So I kinda just clung to him, shaking with both pain and fear. Fear that I’d wake up. Fear that he would be back with Benny. Fear that this could never happen. Dean seemed to notice me shaking however. “Cas, what’s wrong?”
He drove around for four hours, looking for me. He mostly drove around the town, only leaving to look in the place we built for ourselves when we were sixteen. It was in the clearing of the forest next to our high school. In the clearing was an abandoned water tower that we used as a frame to build a fort, it took us an entire year, but by the time we were done I was sure of my feelings for him, then… well I didn’t have the balls to tell him until it was too late. When we got to that spot Dean got out of the car, picking me up as he did it, and walking towards the structure. When he got inside it still looked the same, a ragged old couch that we dragged here on a hot summer afternoon, old blankets on the wooden flooring that we built when we realized we still had enough wood left. The mattress that we took from my room when I got a new bed and a book shelf full of porn magazines. Both male and female. Dean let me down as he closed the door we stole and opened one of the windows that Dean’s Uncle Bobby gave us when he found out we were building this. It was surprisingly structurally sound; the only problem is that there were no lights. I went and sat in my spot, not even caring that Dean appeared to be getting upset. His breathing had gotten ragged, as he choked out a laugh. “Fuck, where are you Cas, I don’t get to see you for years because you avoid me then you disappear completely! Are you punishing me? It’s because I was a wimp isn’t it. Because I couldn’t admit that when we were building this, I couldn’t stop staring at you when you took your shirt off. Because I couldn’t admit you’re the only guy I’ve ever really loved. Hell probably the only person I have ever loved.” Dean cried, flopping onto the couch next to me when he was done having a fit. I watched him as he brushed away tears that were leaking out of his eyes.
“I guess I have to feed the little thing…” Dean told Benny, pushing him away and walking over to pick me up. Purring and nuzzled into his chest once more.
“That’s not for me to say, I'm going to go get some more firewood, don’t run off!” Gabriel winked before standing up and walking off into the surrounding forests. Dean watched the fire as it flicked up and down as it danced its usual dance, lost into thoughts. Wondering what Gabriel was talking about mostly. He was startled out of that by a grumbling sound from where Castiel was lying.
“You’re my favourite treat,” Castiel told the boy who squirmed in his arms happily. Tuning Dean around, the green eyed boy raising his eyebrow as Castiel began to lick down as his spine, his hands still fiddling with
“I trust you,” Dean promised, gasping as Castiel’s tongue darted out and licked over the top of  Dean’s hole. Licking again Castiel took it slower, pressing his tongue down a bit to massage it a little bit. Lick. Kiss. Kiss. Lick. Lick. Probe. Lick. Kiss. Probe. Probe. Kiss. Lick. Castiel grinned into Dean’s arse every time the blonde dropped his head onto the bed as he tried to keep his body from letting Castiel have the satisfaction of making him cum just by fiddling with his anus. Pushing his tongue in as deep as it would go, Castiel felt his lover shaking, “C-Cas.” He stuttered out, making the darker haired man pull his tongue out and flip the red boy onto his back and take his cock into his mouth and suck as hard as he possibly could, causing Dean to break and cum in his mouth. After swallowing the entire load and pulling away, wiping the saliva away from his lower lip.
“Y-you’re awake!” Cas hissed, “Balthazar wanted to come in to finish our homework after we got kicked out of the library for the night! You could have spoken up!”
I smile at Dean and slip the number into my pocket. Farewells are made and soon I’m heading back to the car.
“Maybe not an army, just a few!” Mary said solemnly as she walked towards the kitchen. Castiel followed her in, scaring away a rat before she could see it. “The kitchen is massive!” she cried, clapping her hands together excitedly. Castiel remembered his mother loved to cook – despite the fact that they had a cook employed – so she had made sure the kitchen was unnecessarily large and had large windows despite none of the other houses having anything like it.
“I’ll work something out with my manager, I don’t really get free time,” I admit, watching a disappointed expression dawn upon his face. I don’t like it, it hurts.
“O-oh right… it’s not mosquito season right?” Cas asked, cocking his head cutely. Dean raised an eyebrow. Was this seriously all Cas wanted to ask? Why couldn’t Balthazar tell him?
“Who were you going to propose to Deano?” Gabriel asked before stopping in his tracks, “you were going to propose to Cas weren’t you?”
“After you fired Benny you weren’t able to hire a new head chef – nobody wanted to work with you,” the ghost continued, “and you had to sell your failing business, but because you still needed a job the new owner kept you as staff.”
I bites his lip for a moment in thought. I stare at the flesh between his teeth. I want to kiss him.
“I definitely did not want to be here!” Dean hissed, looking towards the door as it slowly creaked open revealing a roughly sixteen year old Dean.
“Why not?” Cas quietly demanded, sitting back, “also don’t say it like that! It makes it sound dirty!”
“Does it matter why? The point is that you did and lost one of your best friends in the process – all because you were pushing everyone away.”
“Yes,” Death confirmed, “he never fell out of love with you, and it ruined his life. Unrequited love is painful, so painful that it can literally destroy a person.”
“Can you tell me why you did it?” Dean asked quietly. Castiel’s eyes went wide and he looked away from Dean, disgusted with himself.
“Fuck you, and your obvious love for him,” Gabriel smirked when Castiel’s head snapped up, his mouth opened just a little bit, and his eyes, those blue balls that practically reflected the sky, opened just a little bit too wide.
“Ben is only two, and I didn’t want to marry her! I’m in love with-“ Dean tried, grabbing the brunet’s wrist, his heart thumping. Why was he about to admit his feelings. He wasn’t even sure of them. It was Stockholm syndrome. Castiel turned to Dean, backing him into a wall and trapping him there.
“It’s okay, most mothers are,” Castiel grinned, looking at the watch and frowning, “I have to go over to the stage thing to get ready for the carols.”
“He lives on the streets now,” the ghost told Dean, making Dean feel sick to his stomach, and to make matters worse he remembered the poor little orphan girl.
“Why do you need one?” Castiel moved towards Dean, holding the towel around his hips, ready to take the underwear off his friend and put the drunk man to bed.
“Mum, dad, this is Castiel,” Dean said slowly, watching as the confusion, and then realization, horror and then confusion spread across their faces.
“Who?” Castiel asked, standing up and lifting Dean’s head up to look in his eyes. Saddened green met intrigued blue.
“You should name him after that twit who used to follow you around like a lost kitten in high school,” Benny smirked, making me look up and cock my head.
The woman lead him down the hall to a room which she knocked on the door of before opening it and shoving Dean in before closing it and locking the door from without. The room was pitch black at first, having very little sunlight, but after a moment Dean was able to make out a room with a larger then necessary bed, a table, a dresser and a bath, as Dean looked around the room he noticed a shuffling sound on the bed and snapped his head to look at it. “Meg is that you?” A raspy male voice asked from near the bed, or rather from the moving sheets on the bed.
“None of that matters baby boy,” Mary told him, holding out her arms to offer a hug. But Dean shook his head.
I’m driven home. I sleep for four hours before Crowley enters my room and forces me out of bed. He complains. He’s rougher than usual. And above all else it seems like his mission to keep me from eating.
“Yes sweetie?” Mary asked, appearing in the doorway and smiling down at her little boy who ran over to her and hugged her legs.
“Like-like?” Dean’s youthful self-finished, his lips quirked up in an easy smile, licking his lips teasingly.
“Aren’t you getting a bit old to have imaginary friends?” John asked the boy who Castiel assumed had a confused expression.
“Sure, come on Lil Cas, let’s give these losers some space,” Dean shrugged; grabbing his car keys, “wear a condom!” he called out as he walked out the door to his car.
When they stumbled into Dean’s apartment it was nearing two AM and they had been kicked out of the bar they went to after dinner. Castiel sent a text to Claire saying that he wouldn’t be coming home that night before passing out on the sofa. Dean, who wasn’t nearly as drunk as he pretended, carried the other man to his room and stripped him to his boxers before climbing into bed next to him, but not before putting on sweats and a tee-shirt. They woke up the next morning in each other’s arms.
“No Gabe, Dean has a horse fetish,” Castiel laughed, massaging Dean’s butt with his hand before pulling the poor boy’s pants back up and tying the rope back up. And laying Dean down letting the calming boy use his lap as a pillow, and playing with the blonde hairs that had grown a little since he had been living with them…
Dean breathes heavily as I am told to spread my legs and continue my seductive look. What is this even for? A porn magazine?
“Now where shall we go?” Gabriel asked, flicking his lollipop stick at Dean who flinched in disgust, “let’s go see Benny, he should be doing something interesting this fine day.” Gabriel began to skip towards a large building with large windows. Inside was a group of homeless people, eating and socialising. Gabriel suddenly stepped through the glass, phasing through like a ghost, leaving a gobsmacked Dean in his wake.
I love my friend. But god he’s dense. You see for the past three years I have been madly in love with said best friend. And when my other best friend Meg found out, she had a really bad tendency to send me flirtatious looks and wink at me before swaggering off to go steal lunch money from her cousin Crowley. So now, Dean thinks she and I have a thing, when in reality I would love nothing more than to have him fuck me up the arse. Not that it mattered. Dean was as straight as they come. And at the end of the year we would be separated anyway. I’ll be heading to the UK to study dead languages and mythology, and he will stay here and take over is dad’s auto-shop whilst providing for his baby brother to finish school so he can become a lawyer. “Dean I told you, I have no interest in dating Meg.”
Dean watched as he brought over his own bag full of gifts, unpacking them carefully before standing up and blushing darkly when he realised how many people were staring at him. “What?” he croaked, fiddling with the hem of his sweater. Oh god his sweater, dark blue in colour making his eyes pop perfectly, and was also clearly a little snug. He looked like a stereotypical college professor which made Dean unconsciously lick his lips.
Dean was taken back to say the least when he realised he was standing in a cemetery. Who wouldn’t? Dean felt his breath disappear when he realised someone had to be dead. A list spiralled through his head in a millisecond before he turned to the spirit who was standing nearby. Dean needed not say a word for the skeletal man to understand his question, but without saying a word himself, the spirit turned on his heel and walked through the grave yard. Dean understood now why the man offered to let Dean call him Death, why the eerie presence felt so off putting. The man felt as though he belonged among the dead.
“Orphan, keeps running away from foster homes – says they were neglectful,” Benny explained, although Dean already knew.
“Dean, he wouldn’t have jumped of suicide bridge,” Sam said, appearing out of nowhere with Gabe in tow.
“No!” Dean cried, attempting to stand up only to fall back into the other man’s arms, his cries of pain from his violated entrance causing the other man to wince.
“Dean.” I said my voice firm as I could possibly get it. I looked into his beautiful green eyes. I felt myself leaning in, and kissing him. It only lasted a second. But by the time I pulled away the damage was done. I pushed myself off the ground and walked over to the dining room table where my bag was slung over one of the chairs.
“Benny!” he laughed, running over to the much older man and hugging him. Castiel watched with interest, and perhaps a little bit of jealousy, as the man laughed and looked Dean up and down, his hands not leaving the boy’s shoulders.
I hissed slightly as he pushed in, stretching me more than his fingers could have prepared me for. “God Cas, please don’t tell me you were a virgin,” Dean laughed, grabbing my hand with his now free hand.
“Well however you learnt it, I think it’s beautiful,” Cassie told Dean. They began kissing and he moved them over to the couch.
“You’re still in love with him aren’t you?” one of the Gabriel’s asked quietly, making both Dean and Cas look up.
“Legally yes, but that’s only by adoption, he’s techniqually my uncle, I mean nobody has a kid at nine!” Claire pointed out.
“Well aren’t you a sight for sore eyes Dean,” a southern drawl interrupted the two males from their ‘staring competition’, Dean jumped away from Castiel and looked to where the voice came from to see an old friend.
“I knew it! From the second I checked him out, who would leave that many hickies on someone they didn’t love, they’re not called love bites for nothing!” Gabriel continued to tease the bright red man for a few moments longer before yawning, “I'm not surprised, you have had him for… what eleven months now? Let’s see you got him in early December… so yeah about eleven months, and since then you haven’t touched any of your usuals, Hannah is more than upset, she thinks she’s done something wrong, and poor Meg is as green as a frog with jealousy.” Gabe began blabbering, but Castiel wasn’t really listening, much too interested in trying to count freckles on Dean’s face.
“Cas!” Gabriel shouted, causing the kiss to break sooner then he would have liked. Shooting daggers at his brother, Castiel turned to look at Dean who smiled shyly.
“Michael we can’t just raid the South! We need to get into the crown, you know their stupid king is already dying, and if we return his heir, we can use that to advantage! We all know how much he enjoys Cas’ cock!” Gabriel told the eldest brother, Gabe was Castiel’s twin brother, and probably the only reason anyone in their kingdom had any sanity. He hated fighting, more of a lover.
“Dean where’s your halfwit boss?” someone else yells, making the gorgeous boy look up, his glasses sliding down his face.
“N-No!” Sam said, suddenly opening the door wider to let Dean in, “I didn’t actually expect you to come though! I thought you hated Christmas!”
I climb quietly into the car. If I were a woman my father would never have let me do anything with my life.
“Your father is dying,” Castiel informed him, his face dropping faster than the energy levels of a teenager in a maths class.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about Dean,” he lied, making it obvious he was lying, “I was here all night, making sweet love to your brother.”
“Thanks baby brother,” I hissed, jumping out of his arms and back onto Dean’s stomach, curling up just above his navel.
“Fuck you,” I sneered, she knew my crush was towards the ridiculous end of the scale, and that I would sell my soul to be with him.
“The only one who gets to call me daddy is Cas,” Dean said before slapping his hand over his mouth, “I shouldn’t say that, I don’t know if he would ever be stupid enough to take me back.”
“Good little slut,” Benny told Dean, pulling him up by his hair and bending him over the bed, taking off the struggling boy’s pants.
“As much as I’d love too,” Dean said, making my head snap up hopefully. “I promised dad id take over the company as soon as I was out of school.”
I ignore the grumble in my stomach. Watching Dean with ‘bedroom eyes’, noticing the slight erection in his pants, it makes me smirk.
“Dean we didn’t have sex if that’s what you’re worried about,” Castiel stated simply, hiding a gummy smile by ducking his head, “you broke in whilst drunk, I slept on the couch after you passed out in here.”
I was woken up by the door slamming shut, lifting my head I saw Sam and Gabe come in, so I assumed that school must be over. “Hey Sammy, Gabe,” Dean greeted them from his spot beneath me, “Can you get me some lunch… Cas fell asleep on my stomach and I didn’t have the heart to move him.”
“Gabriel, I don’t know if you’ve noticed but I don’t know any of these people,” Dean sighed, rolling his eyes as the other man crossed his arms.
“I'm not punishing you Dean,” I told him, crawling onto his lap and nuzzling him, rolling onto my back to look up at him. He rubbed my stomach, scratching it slightly making me purr. My beautiful Dean, don’t be sad. We sat like that until the sun began to set and Dean’s phone buzzed, signalling that he had a text. He stood up and stretched, I managed to get off his lap just in time, “careful stupid.” I hissed… quite literally.
Taking a shallow breath, Castiel shovelled his phone out of his pocket, quickly sending a text to his best friend begging her to come find him and help him calm down like she did so often at school.
“I clearly am with my family Sam, mum and dad died years ago,” Dean pointed out, “and you know I don’t celebrate this obnoxious holiday.”
“Well would Cas mind if I stole my little man to feed him some lunch?” Mary asked Dean who looked back at Cas who shook his head.
“What if I want there to be strings attached?” Cas asked meekly, slipping the ring onto his ring finger – where it was intended to be.
“Oh god there’s two of you,” Dean groaned as the second Gabriel slowed to a stop, letting Sam all but tackle him to the ground. The pair shared a chase kiss before Sam tugged something out of Gabriel’s hands and popping it into his mouth, making that version of Gabriel pout childishly.
“Who you running from Cas?” Dean asked, shifting in a manner he would come to regret because it showed the wet from his pre-cum on his pants.
“Fergus! Don’t lie about what you are!” a beautiful red headed woman scolded him, appearing out of nowhere.
“Calm down…” my third cat, Bee, attempted to calm me, coming up and nuzzling me to calm me down. It worked. Bee was named after my second favourite creature, the bumblebee. And yes that was his full name. He was stripy, almost a tabby or a ginger but with thicker stripes, so the name fit!
“No, I would like to go,” Dean growled making Crowley pout, but rather than put up a useless fight, Crowley snapped his fingers and the scene dissolved, he was soon in a new room, just as familiar as the last, “what the fuck Crowley? I thought you were taking me home?”
“Oh, thank god.” Dean flinched slightly as Castiel sighed and sat down beside Dean on the bed, the bed dipping towards the other man.
“You have at least kissed somebody before!” I hissed, blushing as a girl in front of me gave me an amused and pitying look in one long look.
After a few minutes of waiting Castiel pulled himself out of Dean and standing them both up, and watching as his semen dribbled down Dean’s thigh. “Can you walk?” he asked the heavily breathing teen who attempted to step away but almost fell. And would have if Castiel hadn’t wrapped his arms around his waist and pulled him closer to him. “I’ll take that as a no.” he laughed as the blonde blushed.
“I'm scared that I’m going to wake up now… scared that this never happened. I don’t want to lose you to Benny again. I don’t think my heart could take that,” I admitted, losing control of a few tears that dribbled down my face.
“We’re your parents sweetie,” Mary promised, gliding over to stand next to her husband. Only then did Dean realise that they were both wearing the clothes they had been buried in.
“O-oh sure, I-I’ll go talk to Gabe and have him go find her,” Cas smiled, his eyes showing how he was really feeling. Dean had someone. Dean had a son. Pulling away from Dean he began for the door.
“No! I don’t want to-!” Dean attempted to protest, but his protest was cut short by Benny shoving his cock into his mouth. Seeing white Dean could have sworn he heard Castiel’s voice.
“Well that was a beautiful reunion!” Gabriel said, seemingly appearing out of nowhere. “Shall we get into the city now and…” he stopped mid-sentence and smiled at Benny who did not know their plans. Castiel barely knew what his brother was planning. All he knew is they were going to kill John Winchester.
“Silly kitty how did you get out here? I don’t think Dean could handle losing two Cas’!” she said sadly, picking me off the kennel and bringing me back into the house before going back out to feed Riot. I wandered back into the front room to sleep on the windowsill until Dean returned.
“And I am paying the price for ruining my son’s lives!” John bellowed, “and so I would like to save you from the same punishment!” Dean looked up to see his father, now draped and bound in chains, his mother hovering nearby a pained expression on her face.
His scream of pure pain seemed to be the thing to bring the man to his senses as he suddenly pulled out and released Dean, backing away from him in what Dean would later realize was shame and terror. “MEG!” the man boomed, and Dean shrunk away from him in terror, the door opened and the woman from before came in laughing her arse off.
Dean watched as Benny took his master towards a secret entrance in the city walls, he considered running and heading towards Lucifer’s kingdom in the West and informing them of the brothers and their plot against his father. But if Dean was honest with himself. He wanted his father to be killed. Dean walked to the place gates, clutching his body and shaking. “Help me?” he asked the guard who recognised him immediately. The guards called for Benny who showed up in a matter of seconds, and sent away the guards whose staring was beginning to make him uneasy. Rather than going to Dean’s home in the castle, Benny took the young prince to his home.
“I-I belong to you,” Dean whispered, his heart clenching as Castiel smirked and began to fill the boy’s butt. Dropping his head onto Castiel’s shoulder, Dean tried to clear his head of the lust that was filling him up along with Castiel’s cock.
“My pet, you should not be so angry, if he hadn’t sold you to me we would never have met,” Castiel grinned, licking up the side of Dean’s neck causing the smaller boy to mewl.
“When did you move? I was comfortable.” Cas teased, moving his hands to unbutton his own shirt. Dean watched with keen interest as the nicely built man shrugged off his shirt, contorting his body in almost impossible ways to remove it.
