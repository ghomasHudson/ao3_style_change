"Are we moving?"
"I agree."
"Excuse me, sir ...".
John was about to roll his eyes, but he suddenly saw a strange commotion in front of the Danieli Hotel. Sherlock followed his gaze and also started to look at people outside the hotel, analyzing them and linking the facts immediately. Before he could show off his deductions, John broke free from his tight embrace and walked to the hotel. He walked confidently, watching some men standing in gondolas at the marina and trying to make room for other boats. At least John thought they were doing this because he had never seen such stressed hotel staff before. He wanted to know what might have caused such a commotion. He didn't stop - to not give Sherlock the opportunity to catch him - and quickly entered the hotel. He was not interested in the next chaos inside the hotel, so he ran to the first floor, jumping every two steps on the stairs. He finally stood in front of the apartment door and went in, trying not to make too much noise. He had enough of Sherlock's strange behavior and did not have the slightest intention of discussing with Mycroft too. It was early in the morning and he thought Mycroft would be asleep, so he almost jumped in surprise when he saw him tying his tie and getting ready to leave.
"Not yet. Maybe we'll go somewhere with Molly and Sherlock." The drop he was watching was soaked in a white towel around Mycroft's neck. John was only now focusing on other parts of his face. "Unless he starts behaving strangely again."
"Jack the Ripper".
John raised an eyebrow and looked at Aaron, crossing his arms. The other man's smile widened even more.
Focus, Watson!
"Hello?"
Sherlock got up from the chair. He went to the door and, although it was warm outside, he grabbed the coat hanging on the door. "Boring," he said, passing the surprised inspector. "An ordinary murder, without imagination or robbery. Ideal for a warm summer's day." He hung the coat over his hand and put the other one on the doorknob.
What did it mean? He felt his eyebrows merging on his forehead in confusion. He had known Lestrade for many, many years. They were friends who cared but could live without each other, but apparently, his new friend had read too much into their relationship. He felt relieved. He was glad that Holmes was not infallible after all, and that he too was making mistakes in his observation. It was comforting to know that he was dealing with an above-average intelligent man - but still only a human being.
They were walking along towards the gate, where a rented cab was still waiting for them. The wind was stronger, but the air was warm. This combination did not match the atmosphere in the city.
"What do you mean?" asked Mycroft. He held his hand holding a cup of coffee and looked at John.
They started to go back to the hotel. More and more people began to gather near the canal and on the promenade. They were most interested in the beautiful sunrise, which could be observed at this early hour on the banks of the canal. The light was so intense that it hurt the eyes. However, this did not bother admiring the nature and architecture of the old town. When Mycroft, John, Sherlock, and Molly approached the 'Danieli' hotel they saw a small crowd. The hotel staff was carrying suitcases to the motorboat. As it turned out, it wasn't just John and Mycroft's suitcases. The older genius explained to them that before they set off on their last walk, he gave the order to pack things from the next room too. He instructed John to wait with the Molly in a motorboat and went with his brother to the hotel, where he had to sign some documents. A few minutes later, the four of them were sailing towards the airport in the land part of the city. The white boat bounced on the waves, and the rising sun gave an unforgettable view. John looked at the city to the end of the journey, where he had one of the most unforgettable experiences in his life. He looked with sentiment at the shapes of towers and buildings. All this time he played with the ring on his finger, although he had no idea that he was being closely watched by the Holmes brothers. He wondered if anything would change when he returned to London. Will he look at recent events from a different perspective and find that he made a mistake when he agreed to Mycroft's offer? He hoped, however, that his decisions would not harm his relationship with Sherlock nor Mycroft.
"Evening, Mycroft. I thought they locked you up at this meeting and they are keeping you there by force," John said as if nothing had happened between them and returned to fastening his cuffs. He took Mycroft off guard because the genius looked as if he did not know what happened and whether their night act was just a dream.
John couldn't answer because Mycroft left the room. He was alone in a large apartment with a view of glorious Venice. He still didn't understand what irritated Mycroft so much but decided not to think about it any longer.
"These conferences bore me. They are always the same ... But what about you? Are you going somewhere?" he asked, pointing to the documents in John's hand.
"I don't have a key," he said suddenly as they stood at the doorstep. He remembered giving it to Mycroft when they went to the party. He sighed and put his hand on the door handle.
"Maybe Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute? I've heard so much about this place ..."
"Mycroft?".
He was tired so his moves were quite slow. He felt his eyelids started to get heavier as if his eyes were begging him to take some rest. His eyes fell on the small table in front of the couch he was sitting on. He noticed his phone and reached out for it.
He was deep in his thoughts, staring at the sparkling water outside the window and the small yachts, gondolas, and motorboats flowing on it. The door to the apartment opened slowly, and this caught his attention. He looked at John, who was holding a bouquet in his hand. It was probably a bouquet of daisies, but Mycroft didn't know much about it, because he never needed that knowledge. John was smiling, tanned, and his hair brighter than ever before. The sun made his hair almost silver. Mycroft wondered if the doctor looked like this whenever he returned from Afghanistan. He made a mental note to request his photos from that time when they returned to London.
He didn't have to turn to know that Francesca was nodding her head in agreement. Molly was even more confused and he looked down.
Sherlock was patient. It was one of those traits that he had developed since he was a child and which proved to be useful on a daily basis and in most of the matters he dealt with. He was patient when the situation demanded. He was patient when he was sure it would benefit him. Now, however, he was afraid that this trait would damage his plan rather than help him achieve his goal. It's been four days since they returned home. He knew John better than anyone else, so he avoided topics that could in any way lead them to talk about love, relationships, and the last two weeks. Although it was very difficult for him, he did not press John, he did not try to approach him or give a signal that would confuse him. He wanted to allow him to think and make the right decision. It was true that he continued to watch him. He still desired his touch. However, he restrained himself and remained moderate and patient, although it was getting harder day by day. He wanted John to consciously and courageously open his heart to him, and choose to live by his side as a partner and beloved one, and that this decision would not be taken in a fit of moment or impulse that could change his way of thinking in the future.
He glanced at her stomach. If he could, he would rather not look at it, but he wanted to finish the task. "It's hard to say, but the angle at which the cut was made and the fact that it was taken from vagina to sternum indicate that this time the killer used his left hand."
"If I was not around, you would have wrapped him around your finger long ago ..."
He nodded as he remembered that this was how the police marked their horses when a crowd of onlookers blocked their way and would not let them go any further.
"Give me ten minutes." He could feel their eyes on him as he headed for the kitchen. He put the empty cup on the table. In his mind, he was glad for his laziness, because his suitcase full of clean clothes, was still lying near the fridge so grabbed it as he walked through the corridor. Before he closed the bathroom door, he heard as Sherlock sat down in his armchair and the soft footsteps in the living room that must have been Mycroft's. Alright. They decided to wait for him. He sincerely hoped they didn't have time to argue before he got out of the shower.
"Who was that man?" He asked, trying to control his breathing. His curiosity was too great, and from the detective's expressions, he concluded that he could finally satisfy it.
"Hmm ...", the detective gave a smug grunt in response. He turned his head to the street with a barely visible smile on his face.
John shook his head, shielding his eyes from the water that cooled his body. He knew he should no longer think about love and its consequences in the future because it was confusing his mind. He had already made up his mind, and he knew he was doing the right thing. He stood in the shower, thinking about nothing. He allowed his body to rest and prepared himself for the upcoming confrontation. They really wanted to hear his decision? Okay then. He will grant their wish. He didn't know how long he stood under the water. He guessed it was a long time because the skin on his fingers was wrinkled. He cooled down. He felt better and was ready to talk. He gratefully looked at the clothes Mycroft had decided to give him as a gift. The same clothes he was wearing in Venice suddenly became a symbol of the love and strange devotion that appeared so unexpectedly between them.
"Do you think I would have come here with this kind of offer if I hadn't thought it through?"
He did the same. The spicy brandy filled his mouth. He barely suppressed an approving sigh. "Even so, these are very rare cases."
The man looked at Mycroft knowingly. "I will not disturb you," he said in a pleasant voice. "I'll see you at the agreed place." He smiled and turned to John. "Doctor Watson" he bowed slightly and left, closing the door silently.
Before Mycroft could answer John leaned over him and frowned.
"I'm sorry, Holmes. I have no idea who the Ripper might be or how to prove his guilt... Unless we find someone who can't move his left hand," he added half-jokingly and looked at the detective.
"Take your hand off my back or I'll break your fingers," John growled softly. He did not doubt that Sherlock had heard his words. However, he only made sure Stoner understood that these words were addressed to him. His words worked because Aaron blinked slowly and straightened up, taking his hand from John's back. He ran his fingers over Joh's side, making him shiver.
The blood boiled in John to this level that he almost turned on his heel. Almost. He fought the temptation to continue discussions with Sebastian. He passed the next trees confidently and quickly. "Don't interfere in this, James. Don't interfere in my life, for there has long been no place for you in it!"
Hanbury Street. It's in Whitechapel, he thought. A district of poverty and moral decline. Yes. Where else in London a murderer could find a more appropriate circumstance for his crime? Someone had been terrorizing prostitutes in that area for several weeks now. There were also several unsolved murders. The Whitechapel killer grew more and more famous. Famous enough that this time he decided to see what life was like in that district himself. Despite how horrible it sounded, maybe it would have dispelled the boredom and monotony that had been tormenting him since his return. He looked around, but all the carriages and hansom cabs were occupied. He crossed the street, making sure not to accidentally step into the horse droppings, lying on the ground. He realized it would take him a long time to look for an empty carriage, and he preferred not to waste any second more. He walked slowly down the main street, hoping to find an empty carriage. He limped, leaning his body on the cane. He bowed to the ladies who were passing him by, and from time to time, he would stop, looking for a free carriage. His patience finally paid off. Two horses, pulling a hansom cab for two, stopped nearby. He wasted no time. He walked over, gave a hand to the woman in a long dress, who was just getting out of the cab, and he raised his bowler hat with his other hand still holding a walking stick. The lady gave him a small smile.
"What memories will you take with you?" he asked quietly.
They stared at each other in silence. John didn't even try to convince the other man to take some rest. He knew he shouldn't interfere. It took him a moment but he looked away with a soft sigh and closed the bedroom door.
The buzz of conversations outside the hotel woke him up completely. He had to admit he was getting used to it. He didn't want to think about his dark room on Baker Street for now. He had never complained about the places he lived in before. After all, as a former soldier, he often slept in hollows in the dusty deserts of Afghanistan, or between sharp rocks nearby patrolled villages. But now he realized the great divide between his ordinary life and life with Mycroft and people like him. Although perhaps the ordinary word was not adequate, because life with Sherlock could never be classified as such. He got up from the bed. He stood still for a moment, stretching and staring at the shining water outside the window. He was hungry, so he went towards the living room.
Mycroft did not look like he understood John's sarcasm, although he was the one to break all records in this discipline. John was sure, his malicious comment would not go unnoticed, so he was surprised when he did not receive a similar response.
"Squisito, squisito!" He repeated. He held a bottle of wine in one hand and put the fingers of the other to his lips in a typical Italian gesture, imitating the sounds of smacking. "Questo e il miglior vino della zona."
Too much information at once. John needed time. "I still have a hard time believing you came up with such an idea," he said, putting the phones in his pockets and brushing his hair back. For the first time since he entered the room, he looked away, unable to bear the pressure exerted by Mycroft and Sherlock's keen eyes.
"Forgive me".
"Oh really?" John asked in mock surprise, leaned back and crossed his arms. "So why did you lie about it? Why did you persuade everyone, you managed to get married and you are not alone? Are you so afraid people will feel sorry for you? You are so lonely you don't want to look like a lame duck who doesn't can make someone fall in love with him? "
"Please, John. Think about it... I really wish you could give me a quick response" said Mycroft with an unchanged tone. Sherlock had to admit that he was a good actor because neither his behavior nor his voice changed even after that compromising scene.
The look of the older man was intense. "Sherlock, brother mine, could you leave us alone for a moment?" He asked without looking at the younger genius.
He closed his heavy eyelids. "Uh-huh...".
"Thanks to you, I don't have as much time as Miss Adler ..." the younger genius murmured in an almost dark tone. He didn't look at his brother. He blew smoke through his nose. "... Anyway, John is naive and easier to manipulate than me."
He raised an eyebrow curiously, crossing his arms over his chest.
A second later they were left alone. Two men, in a small cafe, at a modest table, and with a strange proposal. John still couldn't completely believe in this absurd situation, but he decided to listen to his friend's brother out of curiosity.
Holmes saw the change in his attitude, which made him smile even wider. "Our murderer is well educated and wealthy. People respect him. He is of average height, with a friendly face. Murdering is his passion, but playing games with the police is his greatest reward, so he leaves clues and false traces. The proof of this is the various ways he makes the cuts. The conclusion is we're looking for only one person, Lestrade, "he added, looking with sympathy at the inspector who continued to ignore him.
"Signore Lucatelli asks if you could spare him a moment, Mr. Holmes".
John remembered the moment when Stoner gently released his hand and almost silently pushed the chair away, then walked around the table and leaned over him. John's body froze at that time, he couldn't move, and the only thing he remembered was Aaron's smile and his lips. He kissed him on the cheek. It was a kiss of triumph. A kiss proving total control of the situation. It was at that moment that John's aversion to Stoner evolved into pure hatred and disgust. It was the second person in John's life, he hated this much.
The fragility with which Sherlock's voice sounded in the room drew all of John's attention. He felt a sudden unpleasant dimple in his stomach, realizing that he had never heard or seen his friend as vulnerable and fragile as he was right now. As if he was preparing for the coming blow. Disgusted? A similar feeling never entered his mind when he thought of Sherlock or Mycroft.
He had a restful sleep. He didn't dream of anything special and he was too tired to notice how quickly the night passed. When he woke up after a few hours, he realized he had been in one position all night, because the angel who was staring at him from the ceiling at night was still in the same place. Only the room lighting changed. From the side of his head, he could hear the calm breathing of the sleeping Mycroft and the quiet noise of the moving curtains. His eyelids were slightly ajar, which is why he saw the outline of someone's figure standing next to the bed and then he heard a familiar voice.
"Of course, Lestrade! Just think what that tells us about the murderer's character. It was daylight, a bright morning. The killer entered the yard surrounded by a high fence. He had one escape route," he said, pointing to the door behind him. "He had windows above him, he could potentially be watched by dozens of people. It is a very risky place to commit a crime."
"What do you think, doctor? Do you agree with Phillips' arguments?"
John stood still and turned to him. "What is this good one?"
"... of course I refused and wanted to leave, but Mycroft started to read me like an open book..." his tone became subtler and warmer.
"It's twelve past two. Three hours of sleep are not enough for you, John. You are no longer a teenager, your body will demand more attention and care," Sherlock said, focusing on other websites.
At first glance, the old woman seemed to be a dove-hearted person, but her face exposed a pugnacious woman who was afraid to express her opinion honestly.
"John is responsible enough that he can make decisions alone, without your participation ..."
The room was quiet. None of the men looked down. The tension was interrupted by Mycroft, who had been sitting for a long time with his typical face, i.e. narrowed eyes and something that was supposed to resemble an ironic smile.
"So where the fuck I should put it?" Arian shouted, losing the last of his patience. "Where? I can't go there, because it will break down, neither will this shit fall off. Decide for fuck's sake! Because of your fucking advice, I am standing here like a dickhead! I piss on them! I would have been down the rock with my leg in your ass a long time ago if you hadn't talked so much, you bloody cocksucker! Get the fuck out of here before I push that stone down your throat so deep that even a slut would be impressed! "
It was the truth. He was halfway to the campsite and nothing happened. It calmed him down a bit. He breathed a sigh of relief because he suddenly understood his behavior and the strange panic that overwhelmed him. He shook his head and moved forward with relief. He heard the birds sing again. The sound of trees and the quiet cracks of broken branches. He entered a more overgrown part of the forest, where the trees grew so close that their roots tangled together and protruded from the ground, creating a considerable obstacle.
He took the item from Holmes's hand and leaned over the body. He understood his mistake immediately because it was Holmes who was kneeling closer to the victim's head, which made the distance between their faces uncomfortably small at the moment. Nevertheless, he chose to keep a straight face. "I can see her swollen tongue, bruises on her cheeks, and two cuts made with a long, sharp knife. A cut from left to right," he announced, slowly returning to his position. He couldn't help but glance at the detective whose face was inches from him.
"Please, don't get lost, I don't want to walk around the city looking for you...".
"The main cause of death is a neck wound," she continued. "Cut left to right. Poor Catherine has been gutted," she tossed the bloody cloth away, revealing the victim's mutilated torso. "The murderer threw the intestines over her shoulder and cut out the left kidney. He cut off the tip of her nose, he did almost the same to the ears. He cut her face and eyelids. And in this case, he had time to leave his signature." She tossed the cut skirt aside in one move. On the groin next to the pubic mound was a long mark carved with a sharp knife. It was deceptively similar to the letter 'J'. "And he did it all in complete darkness."
"Forget it. I didn't say anything." John waved his hand as a sign, the conversation was over, although it didn't actually start at all. He paid the seller, took the mask and gave Sherlock a painful smile. He turned to the square and saw Molly and Francesca. He had no intention of staying alone with Sherlock any longer because he regretted he mentioned the incident, he also felt a stinging in his heart at the mere mention of Sherlock's words. He went towards both women and he didn't have to look back, because he knew his friend was right behind him.
"Don't bother with it, John. Aaron has been planning it for a long time. Unfortunately, you caught his eye and he wanted to kill two birds with one stone." He fell silent, but John knew he didn't take his eyes off him. "Greed is not worth the effort. Mostly."
No, but it didn't matter now. He did what he thought was best for them. "Yes," he hesitated for a moment.
John knew someone had approached the bench where he was sitting before he heard the man's voice. The smell that trailed behind the stranger was too heavy with alcohol to make him have any doubts as to who he was going to talk to in a moment. He looked up, and despite the very early hour, he saw a short man with a leaky flat cap in his rough hands.
John frowned.
Francesca's voice had always put John in a good mood. He couldn't control his grin. He bowed slightly and let the tiny woman into the room.
"Oh, John. I'll tell you now how it really is. People think of Venice as a romantic place. They think this city will make  all the problems magically disappeared. They think their love will be sealed, will be strong and lasting. They tell themselves that they will solve their problems if they look at each other with the romanticism of Venice. They let themselves be misled by beautiful advertisements and their exaggerated expectations. They want to believe in the extraordinary properties of romantic places, although they only postpone their problems. Don't believe everything you hear, John. Persuasion has great power but it is not adequate for what is really happening. Most people will leave Venice in the belief that they are in love, but the reality will make them look critically at their chosen ones and they will feel disgusted at the things they said and did. "
Unknown number.
He left the teacher sitting in the classroom. The rest of the day was even more boring than expected. When it was finally over, Sherlock got up quickly and rushed to his locker. Of course, someone pushed him roughly to the side so that he dropped his stuff and panted quietly. Jim Moriarty smiled at him coldly. "Any plans for tonight?" he muttered softly and the hairs on Sherlock's neck stood up. "Indeed, yes," Sherlock said, smiling back. He picked up his books and his bag and closed the locker. Moriarty clawed painfully into his upper arm. "I don't think so, I'm still not finished with you." "Look Jim, this is all very nice and I'm really flattered but I'm not interested in another brutal date with you. Now if you'll excuse me. Oh, and you're wearing your shirt on backwards." Sherlock walked away.
"Come on, breathe."
"Your little guardian angels?" he asked amused. Then he grabbed John by the wrist and dragged him behind him as the four little angels boarded towards him. They ran out of the school and turned into an alley. Left, left again, then right, across the street. Their arms rubbed against each other and a loose thread from Sherlock's coat got caught in John's watchband. "Shit." Sherlock snorted and tried to slip the thread off John's wrist as they ran. It didn't work. "Take my hand." he called out against the city's car noise. And John took his hand. Sherlock, involuntarily, had to smile. It felt right, like John's fingers should have been around his all along. It seemed as if they had already lost their pursuers. Still, Sherlock dragged his gasping friend further through the dark alleys. When a tall green fence appeared in front of them, John felt the faint hope of a short break, but Sherlock skilfully jumped onto a few trash cans and swung himself over the fence. John was thrown against the iron bars. "Sherlock!" he hissed. Sherlock turned around. Their hands were clasped together over the fence. They stared at each other panting . Their faces were only inches apart. And again Sherlock was lost in the depths of John's eyes.
--Most people don't save my number. Not even my brother does--
Laughter.
Wordlessly, Sherlock walked into his room, unpacked his violin and started playing random notes. It didn't sound good, a bit distorted, you could say, but it helped him think.
--Hm--
He wondered why John was so keen to be near him. But it didn't bother him anymore since John had started to bring him a self-righteous coffee to the table every day. Every now and then Sherlock mumbled an incomprehensible 'thank you', mostly he looked at the boy coolly.
"What do you mean?" asked Sherlock. The smile hurt, the designated muscles in his face weren't used much. John giggled. "You're dripping," he remarked, pointing to the small puddle under Sherlock's chair. "Oh, really?" he asked sarcastically.
(See the end of the chapter for
--Thanks SH--
He heard John rise up again. And he could hear the footsteps slowly receding.
Sherlock giggled. It was quiet, hardly audible. "Sherlock, I'm honest, I don't know well how to comfort people...but...maybe you want..."
He heard John coming towards him. "I'm sorry about the door, I can... pay for it."
Doors slammed open. It rattled. Every sound was incredibly loud. Sherlock was dizzy. He coughed continuously, had difficulty breathing, and an ongoing urge to vomit. A bunch of people he didn't know palpated his body, touched his face and talked to him. Sherlock wanted to complain, but he couldn't speak.
--I know SH--
"You look kind of pale... Is everything all right?"
To his surprise John nodded and smiled. He followed Sherlock as he made his way home. They walked silently side by side. Finally, John seemed unable to stand it any longer. "There's a rugby match tomorrow at school.I thought maybe you could come and watch. Well, Jim's got one ticket left, he said I could give it to someone." it blurted out of him. Sherlock stopped abruptly and bowed his head. "What?" he asked quietly. "The...match...tomorrow?" John seemed hopeful. "Who gave you the ticket?" he snorted. "Um, Jim...Jim Moriarty...you know. Small, black hair, pale. A bit like you, but...different."
--What? How do you know about- --
When he reached the next page, he paused. Instead of formulas and calculations, he found a complete page with multiple variations on a single word: Sherlock.
After the third time, Sherlock went into the hall, annoyed. He pulled the door open.
What? Sherlock frowned and looked at Molly, who was sitting next to Jim and Irene Adler in the front row.
When Sherlock woke up the next morning, his head was pounding. Yawning, he shuffled into the living room, where he let himself fall onto the couch, which his cracked ribs certainly didn't appreciate. Undecidedly he sat there for a while. Then Mycroft appeared in the doorway. "You and Hangover? I'm impressed." He smirked. Sherlock moaned. "I'm not hungover. Fuck off, Mycie." "Whatever you say, Miss Sherly." Mycroft disappeared.
"No, you can't."
When Sherlock woke up the next morning, he was alone. The events of the previous evening had almost been forgotten. Until he discovered Mycroft's note on the fridge.
-Why would you think that?-
For a terrible moment Sherlock was terrified that Jim would unexpectedly plunge a knife into his brother's neck, but nothing happened. Mycroft turned around unharmed, a plastic mask from the dollar store in his hand.
"But Sherlock rolled his eyes and pulled him towards him. "I love you too, silly." And he gently put her lips together. John melted as he deepened the kiss and knotted his fingers in Sherlock's neck. He tasted a tiny bit of smoke, coffee, mint and salt water. Such a strange mixture, a perfect match for Sherlock Holmes. He moaned softly as his tongue explored Sherlock's mouth. Time stood still until they slowly separated and put their foreheads together. "Thank you..." whispered Sherlock. "What for?" asked John. "For making me a better person." John giggled. "You're welcome." "Do you remember your first words to me?" John pondered for a moment. "Hi, I'm John?"
Sherlock shook his head. "What?" "You...didn't know?" The dark-haired boy winced again.  "Um, no." John nodded. "Hmm. Now this is embarrassing." Sherlock giggled. "And Victor...is he nice?" Sherlock smiled gently. "I think he's dead, in the first place."
--For what?--
For a long time they just stood there. The hug was strange, Sherlock was much too big and had to bend down far to cling to John.
He smiled gently. Sherlock walked towards John, unsteady, like a timid animal. Then he was close enough for John to take him in his arms.
--Can't you read it? SH--
"Are you scared, sweetie? But you want me... dilated pupils, high pulse, you get excited when you're near me. Even down there."
"I'm sorry," he said finally, trembling. Then he took a step towards John. He didn't like it. Sherlock could literally feel it. The rain drummed on the earth, rumbling like a light earthquake. Thunder, followed by lightning, quickly appeared in the sky before disappearing forever.
--Sherlock Holmes doesn't know? I am amazed--
He heard footsteps. A small but relatively muscular person who came closer in a hurry.
John's smile widened. A warm feeling filled his chest.
"Oh, shit, do you want me to talk to him? This has gone way too far."
--Done--
--Okay, not Alex--
When John was outside, Sherlock ran back and forth excitedly, across the sofa, the armchair, the coffee table, the dining table. Mycroft looked at him in wonder.
He hesitated.
Of course he knew that the creepy "prank" calls would increase significantly now, but he answered it anyway.
Sherlock entered the city park. He shivered a little, regretting not putting on a jacket before he left the house.
That's when he saw him.
Instead of answering, Sherlock tightened the handle around his phone. "It's okay now, okay?"
-you of all people should know that she's into you-
And then he saw it.
Sherlock let go in a hurry and took a step back. "What is it?" John asked, looking at him worried. "Nothing... it's just, er, the average hug lasts about nine seconds. And this one was...longer." John raised one eyebrow. "Okay?" Sherlock scratched his head, looked down, at the floor, the window, then the door. "Ah, Mycroft, good to see you, John was just leaving!" He pushed the smaller one down the hallway to the front door. "Sherlock...?" he protested.
Yup. Sherlock Holmes really liked Jim Moriarty. Of all people. The guy who insulted him day in, day out, beat him, laughed at him. In a frightening way, Sherlock actually found that quite attractive. Him on the floor. Jim's face so close to his, the soft voice at his ear. Sherlock was strangely not uncomfortable when that happened. He kinda liked it.
-- 15 minutes, sorry, that's the fastest we can--
He heard John getting up.
Then he texted John's number.
Sherlock shuddered slightly when he heard the name of the lousy little asshole. And John had just compared it to him. He grunted. "No, I'm definitely NOT coming to Jimmy's rugby match!" He stared at John angrily. And the latter backed off. "I didn't want you to watch Jim. I wanted you to watch me. Calm down." Sherlock hesitated. "Just an idea. Of course you can sit at home the rest of the day and do nothing. Like you always do."
Jon rolled his eyes but continued to smile.
--Tell your mother to open a window, otherwise you two will suffocate--
"You can't fucking change it, okay? I know you're the cold sociopath!"
Could be fun.
But Sherlock was trapped in his mind palace.
-And at Molly Hooper-
It was a hug that gave him love. Happiness. And life.
"Good for you."
Mid-fifties, married, at least two children, smokes secretly
John was closer to him than ever before and he kissed back. His lips pressed lightly against Sherlock's, guided by the moisture of the rain.
Sherlock didn't reply. Instead, he leaned against the bathroom door, closed his eyes and allowed his tears to flow. And he couldn't care less whether John could hear him or not. "Sherlock, what happened? Can you hear me?" John sounded agitated and a bit panicky. Sherlock nodded, forgetting that the other one couldn't see him at all.
A minute later, he snuggled up against his brother, a bit scared, and fell asleep.
It was Sherlock who pulled back. Breathless, he looked at John. For an awful while he feared John would turn and leave. But he tentatively fell around his neck.
"Hi, sweetheart."
Sherlock was lying in the overflowing bath fully clothed. His eyes were closed, but he breathed deeply, in and out. "Hey, what are you doing?" John asked carefully and walked towards his friend. "Thinking." Sherlock muttered. John turned off the water and knelt in the puddle that had formed in front of the bathtub. "What are you thinking about?" Sherlock shrugged. John noticed a tear on his face. "You're crying," he said. "Perfect sounding deduction, you learn so quickly," Sherlock said. His hands were joined under his chin. His chest rose and fell slowly. He had a small, slightly older laceration on his forehead.
-Stop laughing.-
He looked around again.
Wait, what?
--That's right, but that's okay, aren't we all?--
He locked the door, jumped to the toilet and vomited. He hung over the bowl, panting.
he wrote hastily on the paper.
Suddenly there was a crash, he felt a huge jolt and fell backwards, splinters of wood all over his body. "What..." he struggled to get out. He looked up. John was standing over him. "I should have known." Sherlock muttered and sighed. "Of course you're going to beat me up before you go." John pulled a face. "Sorry, what? Sherlock pulled himself up by the door frame. "Why are you doing this?" John asked. Sherlock looked at him in surprise. "Why am I doing what?" "Self-pity. I knew you were being dramatic, but this...is a bit over the top, don't you think?" He looked at him funny. "Well, you've just learnt a disgusting secret from me, everyone will hate your friend, the freak, even more than they already do. A logical consequence for you would be to, you know... leave."
He knelt down before him. "Hey, Sherlock, for fuck's sake, what have they done to you?" Sherlock tried to open his eyes, but when everything he saw became blurred, he closed them again. Normally he wouldn't have lain around for so long, but today he just felt small and worthless. Besides, it hurt more than usual. At least one rib had to be broken. He was having a hard time breathing. "That's enough, I'm calling an ambulance. And the police. Jim has to face the consequences for something like this!" said John all of a sudden. Sherlock opened his eyes. "No!" he gasped. "I'm all right!"
--I met him at the hospital, master detective--
Shit, thought Sherlock. What if John had already seen it? What if JIM had seen it? He whimpered at the idea.
Laughter.
And the lesson started. It was boring, Sherlock wasn't even trying to contribute any more. Then John slipped him a note. Confused, he looked up from his fingertips.
Sherlock shook his head. "A wisdom that I can't get out of my head, even if I can erase all the things that I want..." "I'm listening, you little philosopher." John teased and Sherlock punched him in the stomach. John gasped. And Sherlock smiled encouragingly.
That pale face outside his window, grinning at him.
"Because I fucking love him."
"But- " "Who is Victor?" "We, uh..." Sherlock sighed. "He... I mean...well, he was, we were a couple. Are...together, I think." John's heart skipped a beat. With a wave of panic, he looked at Sherlock. "A ... couple," he repeated monotonously. "He's a few years older than me and he's joined the army." Sherlock sighed. "He promised me he'd come back...alive, but..." He looked down. "You said you had no boyfriend..." John clenched his fists. "You lied to me from the beginning!" he snorted. Sherlock was about to say something. "And you certainly can't say you didn't know!" John stuck a finger in Sherlock's chest and he pulled back. "John..." "No, NOT JOHN! VIctor! You knew everything, but you never said anything, not one word! Why?" "What did I know?" Sherlock was shaking. "YOU fucking knew all along I was into you and your stupid cheekbones and your stupid coat and your stupid mystery and god, your eyes!" Sherlock frowned. John silenced and let him go.
"No, I can't."
John watched the ambulance go. Mike patted his shoulder. "Sounds like promotion," he grinned. But John wasn't listening to him at all. He was too distracted by the boy's eyes, which were still stuck in his head
"No, Eurus, I do not want to play with you." "Do I really look that young... And female?" Mycroft asked bitchy. John raised his head. Mycroft bent down. "If you hurt him, I'll hurt you," he hissed in his ear. John turned away. The door was ripped open and he fell backwards. Sherlock didn't even look at him, he just sparkled at Mycroft. "Don't be so protective, leave me alone...And don't ever speak to John again, you'll lower his IQ." Mycroft raised one eyebrow. "Oh, Will who's being protective?" "SHERLOCK. THE NAME IS SHERLOCK HOLMES!" he shouted. "Whatever." Mycroft muttered and grinned viciously. Then he disappeared into his room. Sherlock pulled John up by his upper arm. "I can't do this. I can't do this. I don't know how, Victor's promised to come back and..." "Victor?" Sherlock took a step back.
No sooner were they gone than Molly bent over him whimpering. "Sherlock? Oh, my God, Sherlock! Say something!" He kept his eyes closed, didn't say anything. An order from the drama queen inside him.
Sherlock tore the note angrily and threw it in the trash. His mobile phone rang. He froze and didn't dare move a muscle until it was quiet again in the kitchen.
Sherlock opened the door and John entered without another word. As his coffee delivery man went into the kitchen he looked worriedly to the left and right before closing the front door.
--Why not? SH--
--Mycroft--
John didn't know that Sherlock was referring to some other statement from his dead mother. Because once, she'd told him, "Sherlock, you love him."
John laughed, even though he wasn't quite sure if Sherlock was joking.
Sherlock was sitting on his bed. He was wearing nothing more than pajama bottoms and a hospital shirt that was more or less thrown over. John stared at him. "How the hell did you get in here?" he finally gasped. "Front door," Sherlock said shortly. John nodded. "Let me ask that question differently ... why?" The boy shrugged. "I was bored" "How-" "My brother already knew your address when you were still on your way to the hospital." "Oh, protective then?" John looked around the room awkwardly. Sherlock remained silent "So?" "So what?" Sherlock looked at him intently and John melted under the gaze. “How did it happen? In the water, you know ... ”John scratched his head. "It was an experiment." He laughed. "Who can hold his breath the longest?" Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Let's say I had a little accident during the experiment," John nodded. "And um .." A little nervous, he ran his hand through his hair. "Do you have a girlfriend?" Sherlock coughed. "Uh John, you should know, that resuscitation meant nothing to me. As you said, I was half dead and- "" Oh god no! That wasn't supposed to-no! ” John's eyes widened. "Good." Sherlock nodded. "Still, do you have a girlfriend?" Sherlock shook his head. "No, I'm gay." That came surprisingly fast. "Oh ... okay uh boyfriend?" "Nope" John didn't learn a thing from the face, that continued to look at him intently.
--I don't know--
"Oh, thank you," John said. Then his eyes widened. Suddenly he stared at Sherlock.
"But just let me go now!"
--Yes?--
The job was boring. There were no tiles, so there was no racing ban. So far, nobody had ever almost drowned. He took a deep breath, then a sip from his water bottle. The sun burned on his skin. Not much happened during the day. No opportunity to take out his frustration with loud children. It was already after noon when the shift change finally took place. John slipped off the looker and handed the equipment to Jim, whose turn it was.
Then Moriarty came round the corner again. "Sorry, boys, I'm so changeable." He laughed a mute laugh. There were four huge guys standing behind him. Sherlock identified them as Carl Powers, Jeff Hope, Charles Magnussen and of course Sebastian Moran, Moriarty's eternal companion.
"Well... tough luck... Because I do."
John was sitting on a green-strewn park bench, staring into space. Sherlock swallowed, not knowing what to say. Finally, he carefully settled down beside him.
Hey fellow readers. First of all I'd like to say thanks for reading this crap, second of all I want to mention that I know that John lost his watch, I'll clear that in the next chapter.
He wished he was somewhere else. Somewhere where not everyone hated him. Alone in his room with his dog and his laptop. That was the ideal evening, not to stand shivering in the cold and watch a sport he wasn't interested in. Jim spotted him at the edge of the stands and threw a spiteful grin at him. Sherlock frowned. He felt he had to leave while he was still physically able to do so. John came towards him. "Hey, you came! What's wrong with you?" He squint his eyes together. "What about me?" Sherlock asked, trying to sound bored. "You've been so...nice lately." He shrugged his shoulders. John, too. "Wait for me after the match, I'll buy you a coffee." That sounded tempting, although Sherlock wasn't really planning on staying. But he nodded.
Black, two sugars.
It was a while before an answer came in.
These were the present thoughts buzzing through his head. Around his shoulder hung a bag in which he carried the block that made him question his entire life.
--John...--
John, John, I have to find John.
"Jim?"
There were many people on the school grounds. Proud parents, bored siblings, excited cheerleaders in short costumes and in the middle of it all was Sherlock.
Idiots.
He shuffled into the locker room, weary. He took a quick shower and decided to stay a little longer. With an ice cream in his hand, he dropped into the sand next to Molly, his best friend. She smiled. "You're offended again." she noticed. John shrugged. "You shouldn't listen to Jim!" Molly warned. John rolled his eyes. "Let me be offended." he said offended. Molly giggled. For a while they just sat next to each other. The beach became increasingly empty. At some point there were only a few people left.
Mycroft smiled.
Sherlock stared back.
-No, I don't do that at all! -
"Why do you always have to hurt me with words, Mummy wouldn't be pleased to hear that..." Mycroft quipped. "Do you want me to use knives?" Sherlock asked unambitiously. He yawned. It was early in the morning, but still he was already late. "Can't I stay home?" Sherlock's father shook his head. "Don't be ridiculous. Of course you'll go to school." Sherlock moaned. "Only if Mycroft stops being such a dick." Eurus giggled."You said dick!" Sherlock rolled his eyes and left the house.
It was clear that his little friend was here somewhere. Only where?
--I need you--
He straightened himself up with a groan. "I'll just..." He stood up shakily. "...go home" John shook his head in disbelief. "Sherlock, you..." He broke off. "At least take the coffee offer." Sherlock shrugged, which he immediately regretted.
"Um, I don't know what's going on with you right now..." He scratched the back of his neck nervously. "Is everything okay?"
"I should ... go ... now," Sherlock finally said, getting up. He was trembling a little. "Are you okay?" John asked worried. "Yes, yes I just need a little ..." He coughed again. "Morphine, then everything will be fine." He smiled. John looked at these lips a little too long before tearing himself free. "Okay, um here." He pointed to the door. "Bye?" "Yes bye"
He heard Jim smiling.
--John?--
That's how Sherlock Holmes drank his coffee. He absolutely could not stand the brew if it wasn't perfect.
"No, you... you saw it, don't pretend. You looked through that fucking pad!"
Sherlock jerked back, startled. The provocation had made it easier than he'd thought. And a little more aggressive, too.
The doorbell rang. Sherlock flinched again, but he heard the familiar voice calling out to him.
"Hey, stop it, what are you doing?" a familiar voice suddenly cried out. Moriarty turned quickly and looked confused from Sherlock to John. "Your little guardian angel?" Sherlock hesitated. "Yep, my little guardian angel. Hi, John, you know Jimmy? "Oh, yes." And John knocked Moriarty down. "What the fuck John, calm down, Sherlock just asked for getting punched again." He paused for an artificially dramatic pause. "Jealous? Would you like to slap those cheekbones?" He literally puked out that last word, stood up and  stroked out his school uniform. Sherlock looked up at John in surprise and lost himself in his face for a moment. John did look a little confused. "Well, I'd say...all sorted?" "Of course." Moriarty, amazingly, nodded, then turned the corner. "Sherlock glanced after him. "Is everything all right?" John asked, and took a step towards him. His fingers ran gently over the injured skin and Sherlock melted away at the touch. "This looks bad." "A-a-all is well, I'm fine", he stuttered.
Sherlock hated him. He was an annoying blabbermouth, never knew when to shut up and completely obsessed with rugby. And all day long, he followed Sherlock around like a baby chick his mother. Unfortunately, John was connected to the first point in a very necessary way.
John frowned. "Hey, wait." He picked himself up and followed him. He stopped just outside Sherlock's door. Violin music filled the house. Slowly John sat down in the hall, leaned against the cool wood and closed his eyes. He loved it when Sherlock spoke through the beautiful melodies. John knew he would never admit it, but he had written them all himself. A sigh escaped him. Eventually, the notes faded. A shadow appeared in front of him.
John got up and ran into the kitchen. The smoke alarm made uncontrolled noises and the neighbor kept knocking on the wall. "Mum, open the fucking window!" he yelled. She nodded coughing. John pressed his arm to his face as he went back to his room. "How do you feel about cooking classes?" asked a deep voice. John jumped half a meter in terror. "Shit what?"
--Oh yes I am, I haven't even tried to get my watch back...just as an example--
For a moment, there was silence. Then a key turned in the lock and Mycroft rumbled into the hall. Sherlock stared at John, who looked down at the floor.
He hated to admit that, but she was right. He lay down in bed and took a deep breath. Then he reached for his cell phone.
--I feel a little exposed ...--
-At my fingers... -
--I'm bored. Do you happen to know a few good ways to break out of a hospital? SH--
Sherlock giggled.
And Sherlock remembered that the average hug lasted nine seconds.
His heart skipped about ten beats. He threw a frightened look at John, who focused on his vocabulary again. Then he shut the computer, slammed it on the table and ran into the bathroom.
Sherlock breathed shallowly and swallowed. "Yes," he said softly. In fact, it was so soft, John probably didn't hear it, so Sherlock repeated himself. "Yes, that's...right. You can go now."
Jim was a small but very handsome boy with dark hair and eyes. No sooner had he sat down than he raised the megaphone to his mouth. “Hey folks, now that Mr. Watson's boring shift is over, feel free to go into the water as a non-swimmer. I'll save you spectacularly, believe me. ” He winked at John. A few girls laughed. Jim grinned. John sighed.
He didn't dare to stir. "Where are you? Go away!" His voice was hardly a whisper anymore.
"Who..."
Gently, he placed his lips on John's.
That was the nicest thing anyone had ever said to him.
"I don't want them to."
"I can see you."
--Go, or they'll beat you up too--
Sherlock sighed.
Why did so many people tell him that today?
Molly lightly patted his cheeks. She seemed to be checking to see if he was still breathing, at least he felt her face close to his. Then he heard her murmur "shit" and was shaken roughly. Still he didn't feel any intention to stop the game. Somehow she pulled him into a halfway stable lateral position. The floor was cold, hard, uncomfortable. Sherlock felt very welcome there.
Young, just started as a medic, arguing with his girlfriend, has a cat
It was Saturday, windy and cold outside.Sherlock stared at the ceiling, nothing but a sheet on. He was shaking, but he was too comfortable to get up and turn the heating up. The doorbell rang.
Sherlock grabbed the block that John had left on the kitchen counter and went into his room. He glanced at the therapist's telephone number for a long time. Then he started leafing through the pad because he couldn't think of anything better.
--What?--
--Breaking News: School freak's so gay and so in love with the rugby captain!--
The trees rustled in the wind. The grey clouds were piling up in the sky. A thunderstorm was coming. Soon Sherlock felt the first drops on his face. Hastily, he ran a hand through his hair.
The bag slid off Sherlock's shoulder and landed in the dirt beside the completely sodden block. Wind turned the pages until Sherlock's name was soaked in multiples.
Sherlock swallowed a morphine tablet and grinned.
"Go away. Leave me alone."
He started to worry. What if something had happened to him again. What if some experiment had gone wrong and he'd burst into flames. "Have you broken up with your boyfriend?" Harry asked him teasingly "He's not my boyfriend, we're just friends!" He didn't feel like having this conversation and went to his room, which was also, stupidly, Harry's room. "Come on, you can talk to me." John shook his head. and his sister held him close for a moment. "All right, then don't."
"John!" Sherlock looked at the scrawny little boy with a warning. "Come on,' John moaned. He knew perfectly well that Sherlock wasn't fine and it scared him a bit.
The coffee was not good. Sherlock left it there. The waitress of the small empty bar had taken it away with an offended look. John sat next to him, tense and drumming his fingers around on the table. "And now?" he finally asked. Sherlock shrugged again. He rarely learned from his mistakes. "Can I go home now?"
--I am not texting with anyone SH--
--Okay--
Sherlock felt like the biggest baby in the world when he nodded slightly.
John swallowed. Sherlock could probably tell that John was more than embarrassed just because of that single message.
"No, what?"
"Okay, stop this now. It's not funny."
Sherlock wondered whether he should tell John about his nocturnal experience, but decided against it. John would think he was a hysterical coward.
And then John grabbed him by the collar and pulled him down. Their lips collided and Sherlock made a surprised sound. The kiss was sweet, tender. John carefully slipped his tongue between Sherlock's lips, causing the latter to sigh softly. He pushed his free hand against John's neck and pulled him even closer. After too short a time they separated. Sherlock looked at John in slight surprise. Then they heard the footsteps of Moriarty's mates coming towards them and he tore his gaze away. "Get up there!" he said calmly, pointing to the bin. John was shaking. "Now swing one leg over the fence, it's not as sharp as you think." John fell more badly than right to the other side. "All good?" asked Sherlock and knelt down. John nodded and smiled. Then they ran on.
"Moriarty," Sherlock murmured softly and looked down. "Oh, yeah, your crush, has he come forward?" John smiled. "Stop it, it's not funny, you evolutionary drag. He called me in the middle of the night and...suddenly something was at my window. I was home alone and..." He decided to drop the Mycroft thing.
Then John cleared his throat. "Is it true?" he asked.
Deductions.
John pressed a wrinkled paper card into his hand and walked away in another direction. "Did I do something wrong?" asked Sherlock, but John didn't hear him.
He counted off the time and then hugged John tighter.
"Looks like you don't like the dear rugby captain that much after all."
The boy stared at him. "Um, yeah that's a little strange, but- wait I forgot my watch?" John Watson looked at his empty wrist. "Shit, it was expensive!" He was startled. "Wait a minute, you were half dead, how could you-" Sherlock smiled. "I'm fine." He looked at John. "Was there anything else?" The boy hesitated. "No, but ... that was ... that was ... so cool." Sherlock blushed. "I beg your pardon?" "No, really, really great and ... how do you do that?" "Um ... I'm just paying attention. Your whole attitude tells me that you grew up under military supervision. How you approached me with an outstretched hand. And before you got in, you disinfected your hands. But this is not the intensive care unit, you shouldn't have done that. Only the doctors do it. But you did it too, you know how it works in a hospital, so you got into that. Most likely career aspiration: doctor. And your brother, you got his bag. But it has not been in your possession for a long time, the straps are not yet properly adjusted to your size, something that you actually do immediately after purchase. A small rainbow flag hangs on the zipper of the bag. Could be a coincidence, but which young man walks through the area with a bag like this and isn't gay, or just got it from someone because he doesn't want to spend money on a new one? The little name tag told me that. Sure, Harry could also be your cousin or father, but your family doesn't just accept gifts like that, brother. Since you obviously have little contact with your father. ”
--Why do you always sign your texts?--
He knew he wouldn't find anything interesting, so he started correcting John's maths notes.
"How are you doing?" The voice was bright and cold. Scary. Sherlock was shaking.
Then Sherlock stopped. Not because of Molly, but because of what was behind her. Moriarty and his gang were coming up on them. "Oh, dear." he muttered and sighed again. "What?" Molly turned. "God, Jim, give it a rest, what's he ever done to you?" Sherlock rolled his eyes and gave her an annoyed look. Jim ignored her in so much as he just pushed her aside in one fluid motion.
"Sherlock?" he heard John in the corridor.
One night, John couldn't take it any more. He needed to see Sherlock. He couldn't bear the silence in his life.
--So what do you need me for?--
John Watson made good coffee. So Sherlock tolerated him.
Sherlock reached into his pocket. He hesitated for a moment, then pulled out the pad. "You forgot your pad"
"That's not true! You are just looking for something about yourself that is normal. And a crush is normal. But you need a caregiver who doesn't crush you. The only person who seriously finds you ridiculous is Jim!"
John grabbed his bag and ran out of the house. Mycroft entered the kitchen. "Whoa, have you upset your little friend?"
Sherlock backed off. "And you want some strange guy to be the caregiver?"
--I assume you found out that I saved your number? -
"And you call yourself the genius of the family?" he laughed and waved it in front of him, but stopped as soon as he saw the expression on his little brother's face.
Sherlock went to the rugby match. He felt uncomfortable, but at least he had a good view of Jim's ass in tight shorts.
It was not an average hug.
It was a photo of him next to Jim, smiling warmly and obviously attracted by what he saw. Jim, on the other hand, looked as if he was about to say something very naughty and then hit him.
"Well?" he finally asked. "We're not gonna talk about it?" Sherlock hardly noticeable flinched. "No," he said softly. "No?" John was confused. "Why not?" There was no reply. Instead, Sherlock got up and went up the stairs. "Good night, John," he said, before disappearing into the darkness of the upstairs corridor.
"Are you OK?"
A boy with blonde hair and dark blue eyes entered the room. "Hi?" he said with a questioning expression on his face. "How are you? I am- ”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes as John jerked back. "Yeah, well maybe I scribbled in your maths notes, but it's not my fault you obviously don't know anything about integral calculus..."
John was still there.
he wrote and regretted it at the same moment. It sounded like he was flirting with John, which he definitely wasn't going to do.
Sherlock swallowed. He'd seen this coming. He had seen this coming.
John didn't hesitate for a second. He jumped into the cool lake and dived in. He couldn't really see what he was doing, but he felt an arm. Finally, he encircled the body's chest and dragged it to the surface. "Mike!" he screamed. "Mike!" The remaining bathers stared at him in amazement. The body was limp in his arms. In fact, Mike came running. John waded on the beach and released it.
Sherlock opened his eyes and got down from the table. He blinked. The whole house was ransacked. Broken glass and water in the living room, splinters of wood in the hall and bathroom, vomit in the toilet bowl.
"It's okay," John murmured. "I'll take your word for that..."
Sherlock kicked John under the table. Of course he knew that. He couldn't have cared less, though. He'd never really been interested in girls. Not really interested in boys either, for a long time at least.
Sherlock carefully lifted his chin and looked him straight in the teary eyes. "I will never let you go"
The fight itself was going on like any other. Sebastian Moran, the giant knocked him down. Then Tom Wessley and Daniel Gollor joined in and started kicking him. Sherlock just tried to protect his face halfway and sighed unnervedly every now and then. He really had better things to do. For the grand finale Jim came down to him and spat in his face before he stood up again, smiling heartlessly, looking damn good.
Sherlock's eyes widened. And he did the things that came to him off the top of his head.
Sherlock gasped.
John giggled expressively. Or rather, meaninglessly.
"I...I can hear you, maybe...can you knock once for yes and twice for no?"
“ John Watson, lifeguard. You find your job extremely boring, but you still go there again and again.  I assume, you need the money. So, poor conditions. Besides, you want- ”Sherlock frowned. "To become something? Doctor? This is where lifeguard training can be useful. Your father is in the Army. You don't seem to miss him very much, otherwise you wouldn't have just left the watch you got from him on the beach. Your mother wants a divorce, but she can't afford it, and, oh, your brother outet himself recently, right? ”
John Watson was hopelessly in love.
Sherlock shook his head again. "No. I fucked up."
Over the next few weeks, they became very good friends.
"Your fantasies might come true...tonight."
“Besides, he's already here. He wants to know how you are. He's worried. Be nice!" Sherlock's eyes widened. He was only wearing pajama bottoms. "No, I can't now ... I .. I still have to .." He scratched his head. His mother smiled. ”Yes, yes it's fine Sherly, I'm going to let him in now. Try to act like a human being once in your life. ” He groaned. "Sherly? What-"
Pretty hot.
Jim, it shot through his head. He peered at the display. The call had not come from Jim. It was John who spammed him with messages after Sherlock didn't take his call.
Scared to death. Pale. Sweaty.
"...a coffee?"
"When was Owen Farrell born?" asked Sherlock, sipping his coffee. "I don't know," said John, looking up from a vocabulary book. "What kind of fan are you?" Sherlock shook his head dramatically. "What's that supposed to mean?" John rolled his eyes. "I'm sure your teammates would know the date." "Don't give me that crap. I thought you knew everything." "Everything that is sort of important." "He is important to me!" "Looks like he's not important enough." John pouted. "Well then, don't help me with my super-important essay on Owen Farrell, cos I've got a better idea than you." "Oh, let me guess, you can find out where he lives from a little stain on his shirt in a photograph, ring the bell and ask him?" Sherlock stared at him. "Are you really that stupid? I'll just Google him." John got quiet. "Another option," he muttered.
--I can--
"Oh shit, sorry, I mean... Hi?" Molly looked at him with bright eyes. "Is everything okay?" She reached out to him, but he slapped her away. "It's fine, get out of my way," he muttered. She looked disappointed. Sherlock just gave it a push. "Sorry," he said, trying to look sincere. Molly had a big smile. "Why are you leaving so soon?" she asked. Sherlock sighed. "I'm cold, I don't feel like standing around and I hate rugby." She nodded. "Same." He forced himself to smile. She chuckled.
In one fell swoop, Sherlock forgot about all the hormone-controlled happiness he'd ever felt in front of that monster. He was terrified. Sweat ran down his temples.
--What for?--
Moriarty mumbled. "All right, as you like." Then he knocked Sherlock down with a hard kick. "I don't really care what your plans are Sherly and uh well you on the floor, you have to admit, it's a little sexier than you standing." Sherlock frowned and got up. "Then I'm sorry to thwart your erotic sensibilities, maybe you can beat me up again tomorrow." "I don't think so, I've got plans tomorrow." Moriarty swung and punched him twice in the face. Sherlock tasted blood. "Bloody hell, Jimmy, I haven't got time for this. The game is off." Moriarty smiled blissfully. "But I love to play so much." he said with a feigned pout. And he struck out again.
John jumped up and Sherlock hastily clawed at his sleeve to hold him back. By now it had started pouring down and they were both soaked from top to bottom. Rain dripped from the tip of John's nose, mixed with single tears.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "Are you serious? I've got to change schools, I can't stay here. I have to move because the whole town thinks I'm ridiculous!"
"Sherlock! You know what I mean!"
John.
"MYCROFT!" he screamed.
After a few minutes it got boring. John stood up when he noticed some air bubbles on the surface of the water. He frowned and looked at Mike, who hadn't moved a bit. He walked slowly toward the bank. On closer inspection, he recognized a body that was rocked back and forth under the gentle waves.
The next morning he was greeted warmly by Jim Moriarty, who dumped a load of water on his face. "Morning, freak!" he chirped cheerfully. Sherlock wiped the liquid off his face and twisted his eyes. Without another word, he squeezed past his giggling classmates.
"So... you like Jim?" began John. Sherlock twitched. "Please, stop." His face was all wet and shiny, his eyes were red and he was shaking all over. "It's...fine, it's all fine." John nodded. Sherlock looked at him through a kind of tunnel vision. "Nothing's fine, John, nothing." He made his way through the wood on the floor, pushed the completely destroyed door aside and went into the living room, where he was now standing indecisively.
"What happened, are you all right?"
"Sherlock? Please come out, I'm not leaving." He hesitated. "Are you in pain? Are you ill or something?"
John was a year older than him. Sherlock had skipped a grade, so they were in the same classes.
Sherlock smiled. It was an honest, open smile. He just wanted it to be over quickly. "Look how cute he can look." teased Jim, reached out a hand and gently drew a line across Sherlocks cheek. The smile faded, yet Sherlock melted away at his touch. "For you, always." he whispered and slapped the hand away. Whistling, Jim breathed the cold evening air. "And now he fights back!" He smiled meanly. "Bad boy."
It was a boy his age with dark curls hanging from his head in wet strands. He was tall and slim. The pale skin rose from the damp sand. His eyes were closed. And he wasn't breathing. Mike called 911. John started a cardiac massage. The body under him was so thin that he expected a few broken ribs afterwards. Then he leaned down, covered his nose, and pressed his lips to the boy's blue discolored ones. He glanced at the upper body. There was no reaction. He continued with another pressure massage. A small group of people had gathered around him. In the distance he could hear the ambulance. "Come on," John murmured. "Breathe" Again he leaned down to the resuscitation. And the eyes opened. An indefinable mixture of gray, green, and blue stared at him. A rattling sound came from the boy's lungs. John paused, caught in the intense look. Then a medic pushed him aside.
John looked at Sherlock's lips, which he would have loved to kiss. Then he pulled himself together and nodded. "See you!" he said and went home.
--clever--
“Oh my lord, wicked. I mean… no, really awesome. ” "You are still here." Sherlock noted. "This is pretty obvious isn't it?" John hesitated. "But you should know one thing." Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "Harry is short for Harriet." He grunted. "Sister! Harry is your sister! ” John nodded. "Sherlock," said Sherlock. "What's a Sherlock?" asked John. Sherlock snorted. “My name, Dr. Watson. ” "Oh...I have to go ... um ... here." He held out a small piece of paper to Sherlock. "If you feel like chatting or something .." He grinned crookedly. Then John Watson left the infirmary.
Mycroft's hair was mussed and he had deep shadows under his eyes.
He sighed in relief.
What the hell just happened?
The next morning housekeeper Mrs. Hudson came to his room. She wasn't really the housekeeper, which she always emphasized, but somehow she was always there. “Good morning sweetheart oh you look awful! I have tea, darling. ” "Thank you ..." "But only the one cup, I'm not-" "- my housekeeper." Sherlock finished the sentence. She smiled. "Do you need anything else?" He shook his head. When she was gone, he sent John his address and asked him to come. “He would find a friend the way his mom wanted. In fact, the doorbell rang a few minutes later. Eurus hopped into the hallway and pulled it open. "Oh, hi, who are you?" John asked and leaned down. She grinned and held out her hands for him. "Are you playing escape room with me?" He frowned. Then a hand pressed itself into Eurus' face and pushed her to the side. "Sorry." Sherlock muttered. "Come in." "Damn, the house is huge." said John and Sherlock smiled. "Uh, do you want to eat, drink or-" John shook his head. "Thanks, no, uh, why am I here?" Sherlock paused. "I thought that's how you do it with friends ..." John grinned. "Have you never invited anyone?" he asked incredulously. Sherlock shook his head. "Ok, then let's go to your room and tell me a little bit about yourself. In return, I'll explain how to deal with friends, yeah? ”
He eyed the message. He didn't know anyone with those initials. Or did he?
That day, Sherlock stood in front of the school bulletin board and inspected the attachments. Some people tried to sell their bikes and old computers, others were looking for tutors. Someone needed a dog walker. Sherlock shook his head and sighed. Not just because of the stupid notes, but because John was coming at him from the side.
Sherlock opened the door to his room and started hurrying to stuff some things into drawers and boxes. "Is that a Bunsen burner?" asked John. "Uh yes, well, that ... belongs to Mycroft, I have to give it back." Sherlock took the device and threw it into a closet. "You play the violin?" Sherlock hesitated. "Sometimes when I think." "Cool, I wish I could play some instrument." said John. "I could show it to you if you want." Sherlock said absently and kicked a box with different kinds of ashes under the bed. "Really? Thanks." John smiled and sat on Sherlock's desk chair. "So you have a sister." John finally said. "Yes, if she asks you to play escape room with her and you agree, she'll lock you up in the basement and starve you there until Mum finds out." John looked a little scared. “But she is only... how old? Ten?" Sherlock shrugged. "I guess it's in the family." John nodded. "That strikes me as possible." They looked at each other and laughed. The day went well. They sat on the bed together and talked. Sherlock told of everyone at his school who wanted to kill him almost every day. There were a surprising number. John told about Molly and that he played rugby. When it was getting dark outside, John made his way home. "That was nice." Sherlock said and grinned. John nodded. "Yes, we... should repeat that." He blushed.
"Certainly for a completely different reason why you took John with you," he murmured proudly.
"And I shouldn't involve you in all of this...", he rubbed his face with a heavy sigh. "And on top of that, these bodies."
"You want me to examine the body?" he was surprised but excited at the thought.
The red carpet decorated the stairs continued until the very entrance to the hotel, but John and his companion headed toward the great hall with marble floor, columns, elegant armchairs, and a decorated fireplace. John doubted that the fireplace had ever been used. However, it was not the beauty of the room that caught his attention, but a woman. She sat at one of the tables. He blinked several times to make sure his eyes were not playing tricks on him.
Mycroft finally focused his eyes on him. "There's no need, John. You have reserved this evening for my brother after all." He stared at the doctor, walking slowly toward the bedroom.
John noticed this not for the first time and once again realized how much he had learned about him in just two weeks. "Earlier you pointed out to me that I leave the apartment when I avoid confrontation but now you do exactly the same thing," he continued, squinting at the increasingly distinct change in the genius's face. "Don't think I don't know what's on your mind and what you're going to...".
Sherlock snorted and shook his head. "Please, Mycroft. Your envelope bait has served its purpose. John and I are here, so you can let go of all these secrets".
He put the newspaper down, looking at his watch, pulled from a small vest pocket. "Almost eight"
"What are you doing, Sherlock? What do you mean with this... touching?"
"Is he angry with you? I haven't seen you get a message from him in a long time ..."
It was his first time when he saw Mycroft was doing something other than admonishing his brother, clicking on a laptop or driving around the city and pulling people into the car. Mycroft Holmes was working. And that meant, of course, that he completely forgot about other important things. For example, he forgot to eat. The talks continued for several hours, but Mycroft's dish lay untouched on the table. This would be a completely understandable behavior in Sherlock's case, but John realized that Mycroft was more mysterious and inaccessible.
"... I will do everything to make you happy."
"Don't you have enough of this already?" John sounded more surprised than he intended. Of course, he was used to walking with Sherlock at different hours, but that day they had walked a few miles around the city and his legs slowly started to refuse to obey him.
"Mr. Stoner. I would advise you to take your sick dreams and return to your apartment if you still have the opportunity to do so," Sherlock muttered ominously over his friend's shoulder.
"John is the best, and actually the only true friend of Sherlock. They support each other, help each other. They live under one roof despite adversity. He was the obvious choice for me in this situation. I had to choose a person whom I trusted completely" he muttered with his mouth stuck to the glass. He tried not to look at the piercing eyes of the woman, which was quite a difficult task even for him.
John smiled wryly, lowered his eyes, and shook his head. He has changed nothing. He felt that he was able to stand up and stay on his feet. The tree was rough and hard, but his perseverance and determination to move away as soon as possible were stronger than the scratches that had formed on his palm as he leaned against it. "I don't owe you any explanation."
It was a hot morning, but the lobby - a place of meetings and casual conversations - was pleasant. The cold floor was comforting to John's tired and slightly injured feet. He hid in a corner, merged into a soft chair and discreetly took off his shoes, hiding his legs under a heavy table. Francesca was sitting right next to him. She saw his condition, so she did not force him to talk, only kept him company. He was extremely grateful for that, he wasn't strong enough to talk, although her presence usually made him feel better. He avoided talking with other people and forced himself to smile only when he had no other choice or did not want to disappoint someone. He was glad Francesca took over his role, although he didn't feel well about it too.
John nodded. Indeed, in his equipment, he could not complain about the lack of guns, knives, and other weapons. He knew he had enough of it. Besides, Sebastian probably packed as many pistols and rifles with him as a small police station has. "Any gun can be useful. I'd rather have something behind my belt instead of fighting with my bare fists if our backpacks and other equipment were lost. Besides ..." John gently took the weapon from her hand. "Look only at this beauty".
"How much can the temperature in Glasgow differ from temperature in London?" he muttered to himself and turned his head away. He didn't see a little smile appearing on Mycroft's lips.
He stopped and turned to Mycroft. The older man walked proudly and set his foot on the first step of stairs. John was too shocked. He didn't even notice when his pretended husband very gently grabbed his chin and joined their lips without warning.
He nodded. After a moment he realized that Holmes was standing right above him as if waiting for him to join him. He stood up, grimacing in pain and rubbing his sore leg. "They say you're a famous detective. So maybe you'll make us realize what Mrs Chapman's body says about her murderer," he suggested, feeling more and more confident. Holmes's penetrating gaze gave him determination and courage now and did not intimidate him as it did a few minutes earlier.
He wasn't sure what crunched under his boots with every step. Small stones or shards of glass. It could be both considering where he was at the moment. The heavy police lantern was slipping from his sweaty palm. His hand hurt, but he was glad he had the lantern with him. Thanks to this, he was able to see more things on this gloomy night. Fortunately, the sky was cloudless. The bright moonlight tried to break through the torn sheets hanging on the ropes between the windows. He walked slowly forward and in complete silence, counting down the minutes to the end of his patrol.
"What are we actually doing here?" Molly asked.
Hopton Street was almost impassable because of road works. The possibility of getting somewhere across this street was minimal, so drivers avoided this place. Impatient drivers chose different roads. Others stubbornly drove on or turned back when they lost their patience. The situation was exacerbated by the fact that police cars drove around the area and yellow tapes hung stretched near the bridge at the banks of the Thames. The crime scene was surrounded by onlookers and Scotland Yard officers. Mycroft's car somehow pushed through the crowd and parked around the corner near a large residential complex. Holmes could see the commotion in the area. He also saw the efforts of the police and the crime scene fenced off with yellow tape. He only got out of the car when he saw John walking toward him. John was smiling and relaxed. He seemed pleased with the current situation and the presence of the corpse. Mycroft's assistant did not react, nor did the driver. They were both staring at the phones and discreetly ignoring the two men.
"Whatever you wish. And by the way ..." Without waiting for permission, he gently pushed John on the mattress and hung over him with a wide smile. "I also forgot something." He bent and kissed him tenderly. "I forgot to say I love you."
"My passion for drama?" he asked with slight disbelief. "Sherlock ..." he said, but gave up the discussion. He knew the conversation made no sense. An attempt to prove which of them liked the dramatic scenes and behavior more was not the goal at the moment. "It's getting late". He looked meaningful at his elegant pocket watch. Sherlock didn't seem to get the suggestion, or more likely pretended he didn't. He looked at his brother intensely.
He heard his friend's gasps allowing him to do anything at the moment. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Sherlock lay with his eyes closed and tilted his head back, taking advantage of every moment to feel his lips against his body. This encouraged John. The sight excited him to the breaking point. Every time he put his tongue to Sherlock's nipples and heard him moaning, he could feel his own penis twitch between his legs. He did his best not to rub against him because he felt that if he touched himself he could cum in no time.
"If you would be so kind, I prefer my body contact with you to be as little as possible." Sherlock continued to stare at him belligerently.
Fourteen hours earlier.
He wondered where he was. Was he shopping? Did he go to the bar with Lestrade? Or maybe he needed a moment alone? Each option seemed possible, and Sherlock couldn't stop thinking about it. He always had to know where John was, with whom and what he was doing. He knew he was possessive, but so far he had managed to hide it from a friend who had no idea that he was under constant observation. They lived every day as friends, and yet Sherlock somehow lied to him. He felt that way. He couldn't be honest with him. It killed him and hurt him every time he couldn't tell him about his feelings. Sometimes he wanted to embrace him instead of smiling and comforting him. Every morning he had to restrain himself so as not to touch his silver hair with his fingers when John was eating breakfast. It was also difficult for him to control his raging breath when they stood close and he could not touch him without giving a specific excuse. He wanted to show him without using words that he was always there for him. Always close. Always ready and carrying.
John smiled. "In that case, I don't see why you should sit here alone," he said, looking at his feet that began to guide him towards the genius. He stopped next to one of the armchairs standing in the middle of the living room. "Join us" he suggested with a warm voice.
"Mycroft is sitting in his bedroom thinking about how to make another bite of the cake not so painful for his stomach. Your fist seems more effective than all the diets he has been struggling with over the past decade, John." Sherlock's smile was so contagious and his biting remarks too funny for a doctor to be able to remain serious. He smiled under his breath and put his hand on his stomach. The mention of the cake reminded him that he ate practically nothing but breakfast, although the sun was starting to hide behind the horizon already.
The touch was soft but firm. The cool gloves kept him from looking away. Holmes's eyes reached out to the innermost recesses as if trying to read even the smallest thought.
After a long walk through the narrow streets, they finally reached Saint Mark's Square. They were surrounded by people speaking in different languages. The restaurants were full of people, and all the tables and chairs were occupied. John remembered when he spoke to Aaron for the first time. It was at one of the tables he had passed a moment earlier.
"I don't mind, John. The hotel manager made a small mistake, but in a few days, an apartment with two beds should be free for us. I was assured that when this happens, we will be informed immediately. Until then, I have nothing against sleeping on the sofa" he muttered, without taking his eyes off the screen.
"Thanks for the warning ..." he muttered, trying to free himself from Mycroft. However, the genius didn't let him do it. What's more, he put his finger on John's nipple and started brushing his neck with his lips again. He heard a soft grunt and felt John's body tremble.
"Too short".
Mycroft shifted in his chair. "People tend to worry if their property is not properly marked. They are afraid of losing it, so they try to prevent it."
"Good night, John." This time Mycroft's answer rang in the room so quickly that John thought he heard the echo of his own words. He blinked uncertainly several times, looking at the older man and crossed his arms over his chest.
"I guess that's good since you don't like him anyway."
"Do you know that John is suffering because of your behavior?" he asked, wanting to make his brother feel guilty. And it worked. Sherlock twitched and froze. "You understood only some emotions and feelings, you think you know them better than I do... You can play with them, but you completely do not know the subtleties of this world, Sherlock. You don't know the feelings of sadness and rejection. And John is at the stage of dealing with them ... The effect may surprise you. "
"I have a surprise for you. I just moved my things to this hotel. We'll be able to see each other more often now," he said in a cheerful tone. John turned to Mycroft. Genius looked at Aaron who was also looked at him with a noticeable message in his eyes. 'I will watch you.'
Sebastian delayed the answer. "Two more miles," he said over his shoulder, breaking branches in his path.
"Over there, sir ..." a boy with red cheeks streaked with dirt pointed his finger "... in the eastern part of town. Jack the Ripper got another woman. He split her open like a pig".
John frowned, and Sherlock was able to read all the questions from his face. "What does it mean 'for the future'? What is this all about, Mycroft? Will you finally tell us why we're here?" John focused his attention on the older brother.
"John, thank you for earlier. This discussion would probably continue if you didn't get rid of him from the bedroom."
Lestrade snorted. "Oh, Watson, Watson. You don't even know how lucky you are, not knowing him, and at the same time how much you lose without knowing who he is. Holmes is... quite a strange man. He helps us in our investigations. He's completely focused on them. He's incredibly perceptive and quick-witted, but he doesn't have a very good opinion among other officers. No wonder. His judgments, ignorance, and unpleasant comments can effectively alienate even the most conciliatory people "he fell silent, seeing the confused expression on the face of his companion. "But don't worry. You'll stand aside. If you don't draw his attention, he won't even know you exist. I'll make sure he doesn't notice you."
"Can we do that?" John asked. His friend was already browsing the menu as if it was obvious to him that they would use Mycroft's assistant's suggestion.
"The one where you make out with your husband's brother in an unambiguous way." His soft voice made John more nervous than the way he pretended to be concerned. "I gained it not without someone's help," he added and gave Molly a meaningful look. The girl looked away.
"Relax, Myc. We won't be sitting here for hours." Aaron teased him. He knew Holmes hated it when someone called him that.
"Cracked and dirty walls, creaking floors, fungus behind the kitchen cabinet ..." he said, not even looking at the landlady's surprised face for a moment. "I would advise you to buy a new oven. Maybe your cakes will stop smelling of Victorian dust."
"You wanted to say that I made them realize how much they could mean to each other," Francesca corrected her.
Sherlock didn't look like someone who wanted to prove his point at all costs, which meant that Mycroft could relax. They started to look at John again. He was smiling, lost in what he was doing. It was also partly due to the wine they drank over two bottles. It was dark - except for the lights above the terrace and the lamps that lit the buildings - and yet John's pink cheeks and his smile stood out from the amused crowd.
John felt sorry for Mycroft. He didn't know why Sherlock emphasized his brother's flaws with such determination. Of course, John agreed Mycroft was unique. He found it difficult to understand his way of thinking and acting. But he felt the same sympathy for him as for Sherlock at the beginning of their friendship.
"You have no idea what you look like now" Mycroft muttered, teasing the delicate skin behind his ear.
John looked at the bottle with slight skepticism.
"Almost". The doctor leaned over the table, pulled a flower from a small glass vase and broke it in half. Later, he wiped the stalk of the rest of the water and put a flower behind Mycroft's ear. His gesture made Sherlock laugh softly. "You are one of us now." He was happy when Mycroft smiled back. Maybe it was a bit of a forced smile, but what mattered was that he wasn't angry or grumpy. They were all in a good mood. The brothers did not argue or annoy each other with unpleasant comments. They teased each other, yes, but their little rivalry made them feel better. The wine was buzzing in their heads, which gave them the impression that they could afford more. The passing motorboats drowned out the playing orchestra and conversations from the neighboring tables, but that did not stop them from enjoying their last night in Venice.
"How about dinner, John? I wanted to take you to a place where we could talk and eat quietly, but I see we can't do it without Mycroft's people. It seems he's really worried about you. I didn't think he would decide to hire so many people to follow us ... " Aaron nodded at the crowd with a smile. John frowned because he didn't see anything suspicious, but he took a sigh of relief knowing he wasn't with Stoner alone. He thanked his husband silently.
"Forgive me, John, that I'm destroying your opinion of me. But I don't feel like playing this game at all. You will have to realize we are all humans, not idealized characters from your stories," the genius snarled and surprised John completely. He had not seen him like this yet. It was as if he were on the verge of aggression.
"What do you want to eat for dinner?"
Over the past two weeks, Mycroft has mastered the technique of loosening John to perfection. He found his prostate right away and teased it with every thrust of his finger. After a moment he added a second and a third one, teasing John's back with his free hand.
Walking down the street without shoes, he felt every little fold, every crack between stone walkways. They were warm and smooth but irregular. John had to look under his feet because every rub against the pointed surface wounded his already sensitive feet. He missed the times when, as a small child, he did not care about the condition of his legs and did not feel pain when he walked on rough or even sharp stones.
Mycroft looked at him. "You act quickly."
"Then we're both depraved because I like the idea, too," he said quietly, running the tip of his tongue over John's ear.
"Murder!" he shouted, straightening up on the sofa. The blanket slipped to the floor. The room suddenly felt familiar to him, and he realized that the events of the night before had really happened. Looking around, he saw Holmes staring at him from behind an unfolded newspaper. He was sitting at the table next to the slightly ajar window.
"Stay close, John. The whole hotel is secure and nobody can leave it until the meeting is over. Francesca will keep you company. Go upstairs and wait" Mycroft pointed to the stairs hidden behind the decorated column. John turned his head in this direction when he suddenly felt a soft kiss on his hand.
John's face became serious. He turned in his chair, put his hand on the backrest, and fixed eyes on the older man.
Holmes nodded.
"I think you don't know many things about him," Aaron said mysteriously.
The moment lasted longer and longer to the greater amusement of John and Lucy. The doctor did not hide a smile and a quiet giggle, and the archer stood with arms folded and shook her head. Even Sherlock was smiling half-heartedly at the scene. Only Sebastian was looking at the only person worth his attention. At John. He took a puff on his cigarette, blew smoke through his pursed lips, and looked at him.
John smiled and buried his face in the pillow even harder. "I got a reprimand from Mycroft. He was mad at me. I can't get along with him lately ..."
"Stop this show and enlighten us why you honored us with your visit," Mycroft disrupted his thoughts.
"Friends are a great thing, right? You know something about it because you and Sherlock seem very attached to each other. His possessiveness and protection towards you ... I had several friends too. Male and female. We were close, so we were interested in our work. One of my friends was a dermatologist. She liked to talk and teach others. I had to listen to these boring lessons, but now I see it was worth it. I think I should thank her ... "Stoner fell silent, watching John's reaction. After a moment he leaned toward him even more and lowered his voice.
"I think I will go to my room now." Molly's shy and soft voice spread across the living room. She stood near the door and watched the awkward exchange of glances.
"Yes".
When smiling John turned his head, he saw the silhouette of Mycroft, who was standing in the passage of the other room. He stood calm, which must mean something was wrong. John walked away from the window and approached Mycroft slowly. His husband's face was thoughtful and his eyes narrowed. John tried to figure out what was wrong, but he didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Sherlock would surely point out at that moment that he could see but not observe.
"Sorry, Arian! Wait ... I'll help you right away!" Josh ran toward the rock, quickly searching for a safe path for him. He was worried that it was because of him that another member of the group had problems now. He walked around the rock, leaned, and pulled his neck, trying to instruct Arian how to overcome the obstacle.
The silence in the room was broken by the soft tap of rain against the living room windows. If they focused, they would hear the radio in Mrs. Hudson's kitchen who was bustling one floor below. John's ears, however, were dominated by the thudding heart and the rushing blood. He looked into his friend's eyes, feeling all determination to reassure him about his love, turned into flushes on his face. Suddenly his throat felt dry and he almost looked away, but one glance at Mycroft stopped him. John couldn't take his eyes off the older brother because the sight of his face almost broke his heart.
"So, how was it, John?" she asked. Her eyes were shining and her lips were stretched with a smile. Unfortunately, John was too absorbed in his own thoughts and he didn't hear her question. He looked at Mycroft with a soundless question in his eyes.
"What you want me to put in?" Mycroft continued to tease him with apparent pleasure in his voice and on his face. "My finger?"
Mycroft listened with a raised eyebrow. "You exaggerate, as usual. Nobody behaves like this among us."
"It is nothing important, John. Go back to bed. I promise I will finish this document and go to sleep too..."
"Whitechapel. Hanbury Street," he said, sitting down behind the man. He sighed in relief as the hansom cab started to move. He pressed his back against the soft seat. For a moment, he looked at the passing people, the horses, and the running messengers. The traffic was growing despite the early hour. He wasn't surprised. Every mention of the murder has recently become as important as the coronation of a member of the royal family. Interest grew with every rumour that the next victims had been more cruelly mutilated than the previous ones. London was full of fear and a strange fascinator with an unknown murderer. It was difficult for him to judge such behaviour. In the end, he ordered to be taken to the scene of the crime, hoping it would stop the monotony that had been tormenting him for weeks and almost drove him crazy.
In a fit of determination, he started to push Mycroft toward the bed, without breaking the kisses. He threw off his vest and the moment he wanted to push him onto the bed, the older man dodged. John lost his balance and landed face down on the bed. He didn't manage to react or even raise his head when Mycroft crushed him with his body. He put his hand under John and started to rub his chest, chuckling in a low tone.
The man returned the gesture without saying a word, but with the same respect.
After a few moments, he discovered with horror that the street he had entered was as dark and deserted as the one he had just left behind, and there was no living soul nearby. A cold chill shook his body again. The neighbourhood was dark. All he could see was the shape of the road and the narrow path of stars cut off above him by the walls of the buildings. The cold air carried a strange metallic smell that settled on his tongue. He was walking down the street, close to panic when he realized something. He slowed down, furious with himself. He was a bloody soldier! Who had greater responsibility to face danger if not him? He stopped in the middle of the street and waited. He stood sideways and strained his eyes, trying to see any shape in the depths of the dark alley. He could feel someone's eyes on him. He knew that every gesture, every move he made would be noticed. He prepared his fingers so, if necessary, he would pull out and unlock his hidden revolver with a quick movement. He stopped breathing, listened to his surroundings. The silence, uninterrupted by the crunch of stones, was proof of the impasse, it was terrifying and disturbing. He waited for the stranger to move.
Sherlock looked around and walked to the large window between the walls of the two apartments. He opened the old 10-foot high window without any problems. The hotel staff probably never thought that anyone would try to go outside in this way because Sherlock just had to slightly lift the frame, and the window silently opened. Sherlock leaned outside. A metal balcony separated him from falling from a height. He also noticed bits of ragged cloth left by the cleaner. There were less than two feet to the small terrace belonging to the adjoining apartment. Sherlock put his foot over the railing without hesitation and jumped gracefully onto the neighboring balcony. He turned to John and helped him land safely next to him. He almost froze when he saw Molly following their actions.
But he did not see only cons in this situation. What's more, he liked this kind of wandering because it reminded him of the stress he was experiencing while patrolling Afghan villages. The biggest advantage of this was that he had his friend next to him.
"And bring one more," Sherlock said.
John was perfectly aware of the reason why she was sad. She wanted to spend the day with Sherlock and she probably hoped that he would not accept their offer. However, he did not intend to give his friend the satisfaction of insulting him. He also didn't want to talk about things he thought they had already explained. Besides, he wanted to know the reason for his strange behavior. He knew Sherlock would want to avoid being exposed at all costs, but that only encouraged John even more. He left Molly and Sherlock. They chatted at the table like old friends. John passed the elegant tables in the restaurant, climbed the stairs to the first floor, and went straight to his apartment. He was glad he didn't meet any friends along the way, although he knew Francesca and her husband and Stoner also had their rooms nearby. He prepared the key to the door, but when he put it on the lock and put his hand on the door handle, he realized the apartment was open.
"Not much. We learned that her name was Annie Chapman. She had to come here with a client to ...".
"Then you know what starts at the beginning of next week. The congress of influential politicians from around the world. Several heads of state and important delegates will be also there. Unfortunately, I was also given the honor and obligation to appear at this meeting... And I can't show up there alone. I need company, in other words, my spouse ..."
Mycroft bit his tongue at the last moment. He sighed, glancing quickly at his nails. "Sherlock and I ..." he hesitated. He remembered what he had promised his brother, so he had to refrain from revealing the details of their conversation. "We had a little discussion."
"It's your doing, right?" John asked, nodding in an unspecified direction. He already managed to steal a kiss from a genius who didn't mind.
"...under ordinary circumstances, I would not dare to take your time." The man cleared his throat and once again straightened his gray hair. "But it was not difficult, even from a distance, to notice your good and logamus... lomis..." he fell silent and thought deeply, making his wrinkled face look like a prune now.
Sherlock snorted.
Holmes raised the corner of his mouth. He kept him in doubt for a long time but finally answered. His voice was very quiet, almost a whisper. "Yes... and I wonder why."
"Don't put your feet there ..." Josh changed his mind again.
"John... gentlemen are not trying to take the things they are fighting for by using force. Such behavior is not fitting for people in our positions," Mycroft enjoyed the taste of the cigarette but listened carefully to the discussion. "Not to mention that arm wrestling looks and is childish. Can you imagine any of us in such a situation?" he asked ironically.
He turned his head to make sure his friend was there. Sherlock stood a few feet away behind the soundproof window. He watched the training and talked to Mycroft. Actually he listened to his brother's monologue with a serious expression. When his eyes met John's, he straightened up, raised his head, and gave him a barely visible smile. John didn't know what made his friend take this attitude every time he felt his eyes on him. He did not know many other things and was irritated by it. Sherlock hasn't spoken much since they came to this secret place. He was silent and he watched closely all members of the group. But for some reason, John felt that he was under his closest observation. He saw a strange determination in his behavior and a desire to be in his company, yet he spoke rarely. Also, these stares ... For some time he realized that it was not ordinary, friendly looks. There was something strange in Sherlock's eyes. He looked at him differently. The stares were sometimes furtive, which made him even more curious because from the beginning of their acquaintance Sherlock did not feel embarrassed to look at something that interested him. This time, however, it was different. Genius looked down every time John wanted to force him to a confrontation. He looked ashamed of something. John blamed it on stress and preparation for the mission. He couldn't find another more sensible justification of why his friend was looking at him with the expression of a depressed man.
"Sorry John, I just want to take some blood from you if that's alright."
John looked up at that, his own eyes narrowed at that comment.
"221b Baker Street, I have a man in respiratory arrest that requires immediate intubation." John realised now just how fast his own breathing was, and took half a second to steady himself. "I'm a doctor, I'm going to start rescue breaths, just hurry up."
“Sherlock, you need to stay alert, okay? D’ya think you can stand up?” John held tightly to Sherlock’s frame as the taller man struggled to push himself off the floor. It took a while, but eventually John managed to get Sherlock standing.
Greg was right there, a hand on his chest pushing him back.
"Not bad. A bit sore, but that's to be expected."
"My brother is just the same, no changes to report." He took a step forward then, taking Greg's place before John.
John nodded quietly, feeling rather out of his depth and small in the moment. Doctor Reynolds smiled slightly at him and placed a hand on his shoulder.
John almost scoffed at the question, but his brain slowly reminded him that it was not unusual for sepsis to make you confused. Maybe there had been a time where he wasn't so coherent.
"I'm a doctor." John said quietly, amazed by how weak his voice sounded. He pushed himself up straight and cleared his throat. "He's got bacterial pneumonia, says it began 2 days ago but I can't be certain about that. He's been on 15 litres of oxygen since yesterday and his sats were maintaining in the low 90's, woke up about 10 minutes ago and he wasn't breathing."
Sherlock Holmes had become so ill that his body had just
Frankie appeared from nowhere, a hand on the small of John's back helping to keep him standing.
"All of this really isn't necessary. Where's Sherlock?"
Mycroft took a few strides to the other side of the bed, looking down at his younger brother. He placed a hand gently on the top of Sherlock's arm, his touch obscured by crossing IV lines.
A few long seconds passed, before John was rewarded with the piercing blue of Sherlock's eyes, gazing into his own.
"'My brother is doing well, the nurses report he has been attempting breaths against the ventilator, which is good news."
John didn't say anything to that, mouth pressed closed in a hard line. He felt empty, like he'd let everyone down. His chest lurched at the realisation, and David glanced up at the monitor as the beeping intensified only a fraction.
Sats/sats probe - short for oxygen saturations, refers to the amount of oxygen present in the bloodstream. Optimal saturations on room air 94 - 99%, any lower will require supplemental oxygen. Measures using a sats probe/pulse oximeter, a small clip placed on the finger.
He cracked his eyes open to a young woman stood in front of him. She smiled, hands reaching down to grab the oxygen tubing, which had apparently fallen off during the night.
The pounding in his chest slowed slightly, and he felt like his lungs finally had the room to expand. He took a few deeper breaths, testing the waters.
The young woman shook her head silently, taking a step towards the bed.
"Right," she breathed. "Dr Reynolds will be here in a moment, we have a plan."
Thank you for reading, comments are always welcome! X
The ride in the ambulance didn't last much longer, but John felt more like himself by the time they arrived. He spent the last minutes in the ambulance listening to Sherlock's chest, swearing under his breath at the noisy crackles on his lungs, much worse than yesterday.
He grumbled a bit about the need for a chair, insisting that he was a grown man who was very capable of walking.
He placed a hand on Sherlock’s chest and breathed with him for a minute, satisfied when the thrumming beneath his hand reduced to something that almost resembled a normal rhythm.
There was no response from Sherlock, and on looking up John realised he was asleep. He taped the cannula in place with as much tape as he possibly could and then bandaged on top just to make sure.
David reached over and placed a hand over his.
David was talking to someone, was it him?
He coughed slightly, his throat sore and his jaw aching from clenching so tight. "Yeah."
"Do you remember what happened?"
He sighed as he looked down at himself in the bed. His limbs were obviously oedematous, slightly swollen and puffy. He could raise his hands, but they were heavy and not very cooperative. His left hand played host to his new friend; the arterial line, and he wondered silently when it could be removed, the splint around his wrist rubbing painfully.
John nodded.
The two nurses finished straightening the bedding, organising wires and taping down rogue connections. Johns eyes caught on the large-bore arterial line in his left wrist. His hand was splinted to prevent it coming loose. Christ, things must have got bad.
"You can go up and be with Sherlock." David started. "But a nurse goes with you, and she will repeat your obs just like they've been doing here."
Lots of medical stuff in this one, there’s a glossary at the end.
"Is there any reason you are not in a bed?"
He was almost pushed over when a nurse led him back behind some double doors.
David smiled, taking the glass from John and settling the mask back on his face.
"Good, I think you're back with us."
"Can we take this off?" He continued.
"Well," David continued, frowning at Sherlock for the interruption. "from looking at his x ray, there's a pretty obvious chest infection. My guess is that it's developed since he collapsed on Tuesday."
John nodded, of course she wouldn't be able to go into the detail that he wanted. She was scribbling down on her chart now, transferring the information from the monitor.
Shit.
John fiddled with the monitor for a moment, setting it to automatically check Sherlock's blood pressure every 15 minutes. As the cuff inflated, John grabbed the thermometer from the side and stuck it in Sherlock's ear.
"Sherlock, if you don't calm down we will be forced to separate you and John. It's not good for you to be so stressed."
He almost asked about him, before a tuft of unruly black curls sprouted from the opening of the doorframe. Stood, looking possibly healthier than he had his entire life, staring at John with a slight smirk, was the man himself.
“I know, but it’s not actually cold in here. You just feel cold because of your body trying to fight off whatever illness you’ve managed to contract.” He told him.
John would have argued, had he not felt like he was about to fall over. His knees wobbled as he sat, landing gently thanks to some help from Frankie.
John clipped the pulse oximeter onto the end of Sherlock's left index finger, waiting impatiently and then swearing under his breath when the monitor read a grim 69%. An alarm chimed loudly, and John promptly silenced it.
The detective was staring at him intently, eyes wide and childlike. John hummed.
Hyperkalemia - a high level of potassium in the blood. Usually indicative of kidney problems, but common also in acute dehydration or following hypovolemic shock.
"I'd like to speak to someone about his condition." He said, an edge of frustration in his voice. Aimee nodded politely.
John's eyes widened, and he forced himself to sit back in the bed. Why did he keep stiffening up?
He dug around in the bag once again, pulling 5 electrodes out. After removing the backing, he stuck them carefully to areas of Sherlock's chest, and once the wires were connected, a fast and not quite regular rhythm displayed on the screen.
"Dn't you go anyw're." John said quietly. Sherlock could tell his voice was fading, eyelids drooping.
"Are you ringing to update me? I trust my baby brother is not giving you any bother?"
"That's it." Aimee said quietly. Her eyes were soft and a sympathetic smile played on her lips. "How are you feeling?"
John's hand outstretched to brush through Sherlock's hair without him even thinking about it, having forgotten that he wasn't alone with the other man. His hand rest in Sherlock's, and he gave it a gentle squeeze.
David interrupted timidly, as though he didn't want to break up the touching moment between the two friends.
By the time the bed was ready, John really was faltering. His blood pressure was dropping further, and his head felt heavy and useless on his shoulders.
John looked awful, and Sherlock, although he never cared to admit it, was scared.
His face was stern now, like he was telling off a child.
"Like you can talk about putting yourself at risk. I'm not the one that gave himself pneumonia from not looking after himself!"
John smiled pitifully at him, "It'll help, trust me."
"John?" She questioned, leaning slightly over the bed. Her voice was quiet. "Are you awake?"
John allowed himself to bathe in that for a moment; that he was alive, and Sherlock Holmes, of all people, was glad of it.
"I need an oxygen cylinder and a mask right now or I'm going to have to ring an ambulance" he spoke quickly, only now realising his breath coming fast. "Monitoring equipment; pulse, resps, blood pressure, sats. Chest X-ray. I need an IV line, analgesia, anti-emetics and antibiotics. How long?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I know you're worried about your friend, but you're no good to him in this state. You could have killed yourself, John."
John couldn't help but grin, his worries settled now that his best friend was properly conscious.
John leaned back slightly. "I'm listening."
The tubes and wires were still in place, just as before, but he definitely looked brighter. The colour had returned to his face, and he was laid peacefully.
(See the end of the chapter for
"How are you feeling, John?"
As for going to the toilet, yesterday morning perhaps?
These poor guys, I really am putting them through hell aren't I?
Ideally, an IV would get his dehydration under control, as well as administering antibiotics to fight the infection, and in a hospital environment John would have direct access to monitoring for his vitals at all times. He know that would be best for Sherlock, and would mean a quicker recovery time, but he also knew the fuss Sherlock could kick up when he didn’t want to do something.
John threw his phone across the bed and turned his attention back to Sherlock, who was panting heavily and  sweating profusely.
He'd slept so much already, it must have been at least 13 hours since they'd settled Sherlock in ICU. Why was he still so tired?
Hope you're enjoying it, despite the lack of any good storyline haha!
"John, you're clearly not well. You're putting yourself at risk."
"I'm not surprised." David replied, perching on the edge of the bed. "It took us ten minutes to get into the room, and you were completely out when we did. You need to look after yourself, John."
Control is one thing that John Watson always strived to have. Sadly, it doesn't always work that way.
"Of course, somebody will be round this afternoon."
John felt numb, everything was wrong and alien and
"They've intubated him but they won't let me back there." John sighed. ''I'm sorry, Mycroft."
Catheter - a tube inserted into the bladder through the urethra. Drains urine out of the body and into a bag, enabling for accurate measurement of lost fluid.
"It's no bother," she replied, balancing the heavy machine in her arms. "Mr Holmes will have the results and the films sent to your email within the hour."
John knelt down before Sherlock, whose face twisted in a sort of lopsided smile, and it was almost as though a switch flicked in his head as the doctor in him sprang to life.
"I'm sorry." He croaked.
As he got up to leave, he took a look over the monitors. John's eyes followed him to find Aimee writing her notes at the foot of his bed.
"Do you know who I am now?"
John shook his head.
David nodded. "ECG from this morning looks good, heart rate's coming down over time." He began.
John made his way over to the drawers in the bedroom, and for a second marvelled at how well he'd placed all of his equipment, if he did say so himself. He picked up a bottle of the antibiotics and a giving set, quickly priming the line before walking over to Sherlock.
On the day that John returned to 221b Baker Street, he could tell something was wrong. He’d had no correspondence from Sherlock in the last 3 days of his holiday, and although he hadn't expected much from him, he’d received semi-frequent text messages throughout the rest of his trip.
Occasionally, a hand would fit into his and he would allow himself a moment to relax; to endure the torture and just enjoy the warm human touch.
"You should know by now, John, that where my brother is concerned I'm never far behind you." The older man replied. "What's the damage?"
Sherlock seemed to ponder this question for a while. "Lousy." He finally replied. "But better than earlier, the extra oxygen is a great help."
John wiped a stray tear from his eye, ignoring the burning in his lungs as he forced himself to sit upright.
There was no noise coming from upstairs, and the hairs on the back of John’s neck stood on end as his mind wandered to worst case scenarios. Burglaries, shootings, hostage situations? Anything could happen with a home-alone Sherlock Holmes.
"Wha-" he started, his mouth dry and uncooperative.
"John?" Female voice. He did recognise it; one of the nurses, perhaps.
Don't worry, the drama will return in the next! :)
"If you think so."
David nodded, rambling on about how John could go to him if he needed anything at all and to let the nurses know to call him if there were any problems. John wasn’t really listening; he was far too focused on the sweat beading on the back of his neck and the unbearable heat of this room.
The thing on his face was an oxygen mask, and David stopped him as he reached up to remove it.
"He's definitely got a nasty bacteria in his lungs, he must have been run down for it to get this bad. He's right through here-"
John's eyes found Sherlock's face, sunken slightly and deathly pale beneath the oxygen mask.
Then the hand would pull back, and it would return; the pain and the fear and the
"Sherlock, wake up. Sherlock?" The detective jolted awake, eyes darting around the room and his breath coming faster. The monitor alarmed loudly as his heart rate picked up in the panic. John took his shoulders in his hands and spoke softly.
"Are you alright, John?" Sherlock's voice cut through the air like a knife, and it made John jump slightly.
"We had some issues with confusion. It was all sepsis related, but when you were awake, you were non-compliant and quite agitated. We managed quite well with some very light sedation."
"I'm alright." He replied. "Have you been with Sherlock?"
He tried to disguise a cough, which didn't work. Before he really knew what was happening, John was in the middle of a coughing fit and fighting to catch his breath. Frankie was kneeling beside him, a hand moving over his back in circles. He hunched over, relieved when the hacking subsided and he could get a proper breath in.
John took another moment to open his eyes, and for a second nothing but white overcame him. He almost panicked, until slowly the world around him came into focus.
He must have drifted off again, because the next time he opened his eyes, the room was bright and Greg was at his bedside.
David came back to do an ABG, and John was amazed by how much that needle hurt, plunged into his wrist in attempt to find an artery.
David left the room shortly after, telling John that a new plan would be made in the morning on ward round. John was informed that it was half past six in the evening.
John thought about following her, thought about demanding his right to stay. He changed his mind when he looked down at his hands and noticed them shaking.
A thermometer was in his ear, and then out. He heard Aimee sigh.
As he reached the top, he noticed the door was ajar, and nudged it carefully with the toe of his heavy duty walking boot. They were his retired army boots, but served him well in the cold winter months in London.
"It's okay, Sherlock. I'm here."
John couldn't help the smile that spread across his face, and he sat forward, his enthusiasm pushing him past his tiredness.
John's brow creased. "You don't need to apologise, I've been an idiot."
"We should intubate him before we move him, leaving it any longer is risky." She said quickly. The other paramedic, a man who John would guess to be in his late 30's, nodded in agreement and continued controlling Sherlock's breathing. John thought he'd never felt more useless in his whole life.
Frankie let out a breath, leaning over and helping to pull it from around John's head. It was only quiet for a moment, until her hands reappeared, looping the familiar tubing of an oxygen cannula round his ears and into his nose.
His voice was booming in his own ears, and he regretted the surge of anger immediately.
John presumed Sherlock was already aware of the exact type of bacteria attacking his lungs, but he would tell him later just in case. John’s first priority was getting him hydrated and comfortable, and for a second he wondered how he could do that without taking him to hospital.
John took a moment to check inside Sherlock's mouth; no blockage, and as he pressed his lips to his to give his first breath, facts and figures plagued his mind. He'd seen this kind of thing claim the lives of men much healthier than Sherlock, and the thought brought a tear to his eye. He swiped it away quickly as he breathed the first breath into his friend's too-still body. Sherlock's chest rose in response as his lungs filled with John's air, and then collapsed back again, empty and still.
Sherlock looked nowhere else, gaze piercing into John, eyes scanning his face. His fingers squeezed back, his brow furrowed. He whined slightly in the back of his throat.
The detective was coughing hard; a younger doctor that John didn't recognise was helping him sit forward. As he settled back, David looped an oxygen cannula into Sherlock's nose and round his ears.
He was thankful when it was over and he was covered up, feeling vulnerable and exposed laying there like that. He sat silently and without complaint while the young doctor took a blood sample from the crook of his right arm, and then left him in peace.
“Get some sleep; I’m going to call Mycroft.” He said softly, his fingers moving down and just resting at Sherlock’s carotid pulse before he got up, adjusting the blankets, and walked towards the bedroom door.
The door swung further than John had anticipated, and he almost fell back down the stairs in an attempt to conceal himself from the men that he so honestly believed would be inside.
(See the end of the chapter for
So this kinda ended up as a bit of a filler, I apologise for the lack of drama in this one.
The nurse kept reminding him that he needed rest. It took over four hours for him to give in to sleep.
"She told me to keep an eye on you."
Sherlock had gone quiet, the only noise in the room the whooshing from the stream of oxygen, the steady beep from the monitors and his wheezing chest. John was glad he'd fallen asleep, maybe he'd finally get some rest.
"Of course." She replied. "I'll get Doctor Reynolds to speak to you."
John laughed, "You're an idiot.", winding his hands into Sherlock's hair once again. The detective hummed at the touch. "You've got pneumonia, it could have killed you."
Voices by the second time.
"You, on the other hand, may have had a panic attack, yes, but you collapsed behind the door to Sherlock's room. By the time they got in you were out cold, they had to pump you full of fluids just to get your blood pressure back up, and your oxygen saturations were low."
John hummed slightly under his breath, shuffling in the bed.
"We've started IV antibiotics, so he should improve as they start to work. His kidney function is dire, so we'll sort a referral to renal, and the respiratory team will see him as well."
"You've just dropped your sats a bit. Doctor Reynolds thinks maybe you've picked up an infection." Aimee said. She didn't look at John, hands busy at the fluid pump by his head. John recognised a bottle of IV paracetamol.
"Nobody told me about that." He said sharply. David sniggered.
Sherlock has feelings, honestly.
Eventually, a knock at the door roused John from his dazed state, and Dr Reynolds stood in the doorway.
John took a second to breathe, his head swimming with information. Sherlock's vitals had appeared on the new monitors, just as grim as before.
"Mr Holmes requests that you keep him informed on his brothers condition, please call if you have any concerns."
John nodded meekly, his head heavy on his shoulders.
Greg's face loomed over him, soft eyes and a slight wrinkle on his brow. He was horizontal, then.
(See the end of the chapter for
John looked up at Greg, who was raising his eyebrows at him.
He returned a few minutes later with an array of bits and bobs. In his hand, he carried a small bowl of water; Sherlock noted it was chilled by the slight condensation on the side. In the water was a clean flannel, and in John’s other hand was two bottles of pills and a separate glass of water. He placed all of the items down on the small table by Sherlock’s head, shook two tablets out of one bottle and two from the other, and handed them to him with the glass of water.
He hung up and shoved his phone in his pocket, he didn't have time to answer questions about the blue tinge to Sherlock's lips or how fast his heart was weakening.
The guilt was back, and John rested his head in his spare hand as he contemplated the situation. He didn't even want to think about the worst case scenario.
Sorry it's been such a long time, work is busy and I don't get much time anymore.
And John was alone.
His phone pulled him from his thoughts. Unknown number. John answered quickly, giving the other caller no chance to speak.
When the doorbell rang, it jolted John slightly. Who would bother calling at 9pm on a Sunday? He walked briskly to the door, and was met by a young-ish blonde girl. In her arms she carried a large contraption, and John recognised it from his limited work at the hospital.
He sat back and sighed, eyes dropping again. The sound of the whirring fluid pump pulled him back to sleep.
"What's happening?" He asked quietly, surprised by how groggy he was. It was so odd, being confused in a setting he was usually so natural in.
Picking the blood bottles up, he took them into the kitchen and placed them down on the side, turning them over in his hands slightly to prevent them clotting.
“started y-yesterday, head, chest, stomach, e’rything.” Sherlock mumbled, his body shaking.
He made some snappy comment about her husband having an affair and she scurried off.
"Did you discuss with your registrar?" He asked, mouth twisting up into a smirk.
It made him slightly nauseous that he'd had to be sedated over a stupid panic attack.
"Just let our doctors get him sorted. We will come and get you when they're ready." She turned around and walked away.
"Just a bit dizzy."
"Blood pressure's coming up a bit." He heard David say, his voice barking orders at the more junior staff. "Let's put that oxygen up to four litres. Get those IV fluids back up. I'm going to go and speak to my reg."
"Sherlock?!" He shouted, shaking his friend's shoulders. "Can you hear me?"
Mycroft sat down silently in the chair by John's bed, leaning forward slightly.
He vaguely remembered coming round after his panic attack, confused by his surroundings and disorientated. It wasn't a feeling he wished to replicate.
The rest of the morning went without incident, he even had a few slices of toast for his lunch. The IV fluids were slowed slightly and he was encouraged to drink as much as possible to make up for it.
Sooooo I guess I took a different turn with this!
TPN - Total Parenteral Nutrition. Intravenous feed, a nutritional formula that is made up based on levels picked up in a patient’s blood tests.
"Hiya mate, how you doing?" He asked, the beam on his face making John feel slightly happier, if nothing else.
It took him a few tries to open his eyes again, and he quickly realised it was a bad idea. A wave of nausea hit him like a brick wall, and John felt his heart kick-start in his chest like a drum. The room tilted on its axis, his vision dimming in and out. Everything was too fast and too bright and he couldn’t breathe and then his face met the floor.
John had just made himself a cup of coffee when his phone began to ring. He dug the chirping device out of his pocket and almost scoffed at the name on the screen as he answered the call.
"You're most welcome, John. Is there anything else you require from me?"
The next hour flew by. David talked to Sherlock about next steps in his recovery, and Sherlock agreed to cooperate with the physiotherapists and play an active roll in his treatment plan.
John could have cried, relief filling his lungs with every breath. The alarms slowly faded, one by one, the telltale beeping reminding him that he was still alive.
“I’m not going to a b-b-loody hospital. Call Mycroft, he’ll help.” He rasped. John returned his hand to his chest, reminding him to breathe. He was right; Mycroft could do anything.
John smiled at him. Mycroft seemed to gain more of a personality every time he saw him.
As she positioned it back on his face, prongs pointing awkwardly into his nose, she spoke.
A radiologist came and did a chest x ray, and by the time the chest physiotherapists came around, John was exhausted.
"John?" He said quietly. John would have called it soft or gentle, had he not known Mycroft Holmes well.
Sherlock got to his feet, holding the mask aside and helping John guide the glass of water to his lips. John thought water had never tasted so good in his life.
"I know, love" John replied, sighing. He was surprised how difficult he found it to see his friend like this. "I just need you to hang on for just a bit longer and then you can sleep, okay?"
He had seen men in the field gasp like this after gunshot wounds or bombings, but it was somehow worse to see the almighty Sherlock Holmes brought to his knees by rattling coughs and not enough air.
"Do you know where you are?" David continued.
"I guess it's a good job you came back when you did."
He pulled up another chair beside the bed, sat himself down at John's eye level. Sherlock had moped off while John was napping, mused something about needing a proper cup of tea.
John's brain wasn't working.
Aimee stopped what she was doing, leaning into John's view. She smiled again.
"It's alright John, I'm fine." He replied. John blinked slowly, his eyes wandering around the room. He fixed his gaze on Aimee, who was stood up now, leaning on the end of his bed.
ABG - Stands for Arterial Blood Gas. A small blood sample is taken from an artery, usually from the wrist, and can accurately measure oxygen saturations in the blood as well as levels of other gases such as carbon dioxide.
She reached up then, fiddling with the monitor, and the noise stopped.
The doctor had remained unconscious throughout all the prodding and poking, his rising temperature forcing him into a fitful sleep. He would mumble incoherently every so often, and Sherlock would tense up, craning his neck to check on his best friend.
The detective was shaking harder now, his breathing coming harsh and fast as he clung to the material of John’s coat.
John stiffened, and he noticed Frankie shoot Greg a concerned look out the corner of his eye.
A small pair of hands appeared around John's right bicep, leaving behind a blood pressure cuff.
"John knows his own mind, he is a doctor himself."
"I trust you more than any of these doctors, John. I will always trust you to do what is best for my brother. Please."
Release.
There were alarms blaring now, his chest heaving as he fought to keep his breathing steady.
John didn't move, anger bubbling at the surface that he was so helpless against all of this. A switch was flicked, and he felt himself starting to lose it.
He overheard snippets of conversation between the medical staff; caught words like 'hypotension' and 'sepsis'.
John wanted the ground to swallow him up. How embarrassing it was, being a patient.
He led the girl through into the bedroom and stood aside while she got herself ready.
Nasal oxygen cannula - a device used to deliver small amounts of oxygen to patients (between 0.5 and 4 litres). Clear tubing that feeds into the nose via 2 nasal prongs. The other end connects to an oxygen supply.
David pursed his lips and sighed.
John didn't even have the energy to argue, nodding slightly as his mind pulled him back into sleep. Aimee lowered his bed from the control panel, and that was that
(See the end of the chapter for
The coughs subsided slowly, and as Sherlock sat back John noted the blueish tinge on his lips. Keeping a hand on Sherlock's chest, John spoke with more urgency now.
"Deal." John barely gave him chance to take a breath. "Let's go."
Another young nurse came into the room, helped Aimee to roll him and rearrange his pillows. John added a left ICD to his ever growing inventory, the thick tubing pulling at the stitches that held it in place. He succumbed to a wash at the same time, giving in to aid from the two women due to the weakness of his own limbs.
It had taken him this long to recognise that the room he was in was not as he remembered. Mainly due to the lack of another bed, and the distinct absence of Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock's eyes were closed, and it took John roughly 3 seconds to realise he couldn't see the sharp rise and fall of his chest as before; 3 seconds to realise he couldn't hear the wheeze; 3 seconds to realise his best friend wasn't breathing.
There was a beeping coming from somewhere, slightly quick but steady none the less. Whirring of machinery perhaps?
Hypovolemic shock - a condition that presents once 20% or more of the body's fluid or blood volume is lost. Will cause death if left untreated. Most commonly seen after traumatic blood loss, but can also be caused by severe dehydration.
When they turned the corner into the unit, Sherlock's door was open. John felt an odd sense of deja vu, having not been there for three days.
"Doctor Watson, Mr Holmes. If you'd like to follow me."
"What day is it?" He murmured, voice unbearably quiet.
John almost cried as Greg pushed him alongside Sherlock's bed, and he reached his arm between the bars to clasp the other man's hand in his. It took him a moment to recognise his fingers twitching slightly.
"If I take some blood from him do you think you could send somebody to collect it? I don't have the equipment to analyse it"
"I should have kept a better eye on him." He croaked, more to himself than to anyone else. "What sort of Doctor-"
Passers-by gawped as they loaded him into the ambulance and John hopped in behind. He didn't even have the energy to worry about the press getting ahold of this.
"He's more stable now he's intubated. Sats aren't bad but we've got him on high flow oxygen, and blood pressure isn't much better. I think they've got a bed for him on ICU when we get there."
“I know, but I can’t treat you here. Sherlock, you have pneumonia. I need monitoring, an IV, oxygen, not to mention the medication you need.” He said; an edge to his voice. He was almost angry at himself that he wasn’t enough to help. Sherlock took a shallow breath in.
The doctor's eyes opened just a fraction, and Sherlock gave a small smile back to him.
He stood with Sherlock for close to an hour, just watching the rhythmic rise and fall of his chest and letting it be a small comfort to him. He tried not to think about the fact that his steady breathing was not his own.
"Great, thanks."
The feeling up his arm washed over him like a wave, a warm blanket that wrapped around his insides and pulled him back together again.
He was Sherlock's consultant, seemingly. He'd introduced himself to John as "Doctor Reynolds, but you can call me David."
He cracked half an eye open, staring at the other man.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Deep breaths, Sherlock.” He said softly, pressing the diaphragm to the middle of his chest. Sherlock’s heart was racing, and the unmistakeable rattles that John heard with his rapid breathing confirmed his diagnosis.
"John, we need to get you back to bed."
"He doesn't look good, does he?" She said quietly, pulling an apron over her head. John sighed, looking over at the mess of wires and hard breathing that lay in a heap on his bed.
David spoke to the ICU registrar, who agreed that under 'the circumstances', perhaps John could benefit from some closer monitoring.
David asked him quietly if he had anymore questions, then congratulated him on his own recovery, scurrying from the room upon the realisation that he would get no more from Sherlock Holmes.
John's eyes dropped, staring at his hands as the other man lectured him. It made him feel young and vulnerable.
John laid quiet, sleeping fairly soundly baring in mind the circumstances. Sherlock thought that the sound of the oxygen must be very irritating for him; he remembered it from his short stint at home, before he'd ended up in this dreadful place.
Sherlock's heart sank.
He didn't know if that was an appropriate medical diagnosis, but it was the only way he could think to describe how he felt in the moment.
"I'm fine." Sherlock said, voice slightly wavering from misuse over the past 3 days.
"Shit." He said quietly.
David took his time briefing John on Sherlock’s condition. He spoke with confidence and conviction, neither of which John felt he possessed at this moment in time.
When he opened his eyes, it was to David at his bedside. He was seated, had taken John's right arm in his hand and was looking closely in the crook of his arm.

"Don't you think he should be in a hospital, Mycroft?"
"Now, I don't think you're fit enough for this." He said, voice deep and steady.
"John, you and I both know that isn't going to happen. I will get you anything you could possibly need, I trust you have all the skills necessary to care for my brother."
Sherlock nodded slightly, his chest heaving unnaturally. John dug around in the duffel bag, noticing an array of items, bags of fluid, IV packs and the such. He pulled out a non-rebreathe mask and attached the tubing to the oxygen tank. Cranking it up to the full 15 litres, he held it over Sherlock's mouth and nose, securing the ties around the back of his head. "Deep breaths, Sherlock. This should help."
By the time Frankie managed to get hold of a wheelchair for John, he was nearly asleep again.
The older Holmes brother said nothing after that, taking one last look over at the man in the bed before turning and leaving the room.
"We'll sort you out John, don't worry." She said softly. Her hand moved, attaching the fluids back to the IV port in his left hand.
"Mycroft, I don't think I-"
Aimee busied herself around John's bed, and Greg and Mycroft stepped back to let her in. She pressed some buttons on John's monitor, and he felt the familiar sensation of the cuff on his right arm tightening.
David had stepped out too, muttering something about reviewing blood results and coming back later. John wasn't really listening.
John's mind was plagued with images of the younger man, in pain or alone. It felt physically painful to not be next to him now; to not be the help that he needed.
"Not good?" Sherlock asked between breaths, his voice muffled from the mask.
"We think the adrenaline was keeping you going, but the panic attack and the hyperventilating just took your body over the edge."
John laughed, "Only the usual amount, Mycroft. He's doing better, thank you for sending all those supplies."
John was slightly taken aback. He had never expected an apology for anything, never mind one coming from Mycroft Holmes himself.
John had to admit, the time between bringing Sherlock in and now was slightly fuzzy. He remembered the ambulance, and the scene in a&e. The memory made him shudder.
John closed his eyes and sighed, his heart lurching. "Guess that means I won't be out of here today, then?"
"The dehydration will have left him susceptible to illness, it's not surprising that he's picked something up."
"If there is any concern over those observations, you're coming straight back up, okay?"
"He's got pneumonia, and a pretty bad case. I've managed to get him relatively comfortable but he needs treatment"
Glossary-
His eyes snapped open, darting to the offending monitor. Shit.
I hope it's alright! I'm very aware of possible mistakes in this one, I've spent too much time staring at the same words haha!
The paramedic looked at John with wide eyes, nodding and turning to her partner.
"Doctor Reynolds will come back with your results, Mr Watson."
John laughed, "I'm never finished."
"Just two seconds Sherlock, don't be a baby." John laughed, moving to stand outside the room.
John thanked him quickly, and Aimee turned the lamp off before leaving behind him. John took a moment to crane his neck and get a look at the monitor.
that alarm was coming from him.
"There will be a consultant at your disposal as well as a full team of nurses. They have been told to run everything past you." John shook his head.
A light was flicked on, and he followed it to see Aimee, the nurse, turning on a small bedside lamp.
"It's Thursday. You've been in and out of consciousness for nearly six days." She said softly. John frowned at her. Six days? "I've already bleeped your consultant, so he knows you're awake. He'll be by to see you soon. Shall we get you a little more comfortable?"
Voices shouted at him, but he couldn't make out the words. He was too hot and too cold but his limbs were too heavy to do anything about it. He couldn't even push himself up, couldn't lift his hand to wave for somebody to help him, to get him out of this misery.
The one fluid pump at his bedside six days ago had turned into three, each running something different through the line in his neck. He recognised a bag of TPN hanging from one, hadn't even thought of nutrition as being a factor in his recovery. He didn't care enough to look at the other two.
"Don't be sorry, I'm just glad you're alright." He smiled, standing and taking the chart from Aimee, who held it out for him. He flipped through the pages quickly.
The next few hours were a flurry of people.
"Thursday."
At least he thought it was just a moment.
He found himself drifting off without warning, Greg's steady hand on the top of his arm waking him only slightly.
Poor John, I can't help but torture him a little bit while I've got the chance. Maybe I'll give him a break in the next chapter ;)
Amidst the chaos, Greg had apparently made himself scarce. Left with John and Sherlock was Aimee, who'd perched herself on a small table next to John's bed. She was alternating between writing in her notes and looking up at the monitors.
"I'm Frankie, I'm your nurse for today."
"You've got a temperature." She said quietly. John could have screamed.
Greg nodded, still smiling.
Frankie saw right through him, her brow creasing slightly. "You don't want any pain meds? Are you sure?"
ECG - short for electrocardiogram, uses leads attached to the chest to produce a paper reading of the heart's electrical activity. Used to check for abnormal electrical impulses.
Sherlock nodded, and John ran a hand once more through his dark curls before a brisk knock at the door sounded.
I'm struggling slightly with my motivation at the moment, hopefully it'll be back soon!
"Do you buy your doctorate on the internet?"
Sherlock sat quietly for the remainder of the afternoon, and John slept fitfully beside him. Aimee stepped in and out often, fiddling with John's IV lines and repeating his observations. Sherlock tried to pay no mind to the numbers flashing on the monitor, stared into space while another nurse took his own blood pressure.
“I’m alright,” He was unsure who he was trying to convince. His eyes were growing ever-so-slightly foggy around the edges and he noticed his breaths coming slightly quicker. “I’m going to go and sit with him.”
Breathe.
John busied himself stirring his coffee, one ear always open for his flatmate in the other room.
"You'll be alright John." She replied, her voice calm and soft. "You need to rest, now."
It continued like that for several hours, and when John finally woke, it was to the shrill noise that he dreaded hearing most.
He could smell the disinfectant on the linoleum; see the vague outline of the furniture. His ears barely registered someone saying his name and something hard pushing at his back before everything was black.
Mycroft chuckled slightly. "It is not your fault, John. My brother always has known how to test us." There was a pause before Mycroft spoke again.
There was a pinch in the back of his left hand, and a tickle under his nose. His eyes were the last to respond, and the muffled voices came to a halt as his eyelids twitched in their attempt to open.
"What's his treatment plan?" Sherlock interrupted the consultant's silence. He had no time for waiting around for the mumbling idiot to make an excuse for his actions. The damage had already been done.
John was nodding along to his words, taking it all in.
"Don't worry, we're keeping an eye on you. Rest, John."
Sherlock’s eyes widened. “N-no. You’re a doctor.” He muttered; his voice stronger now his breathing was under control. John shook his head, running a hand through his hair.
"I'm coming down." Mycroft's voice was calm and strong. "I'll be ten minutes."
"And you let him leave his bed for what reason?" Sherlock probed. He could feel himself getting angrier at the consultant. His best friend was apparently severely unwell, and yet his doctor had allowed him to sit in a wheelchair, unmonitored, for over an hour.
John just glared at him, and Chrissy nodded to say she was happy.
Frankie had just finished repeating his observations (again) when David stepped into the room.
"What's wrong with John?"
A large man in blue scrubs entered the room, holding the door behind him. He nodded to each of the men in turn.
Release.
John nodded once more. "Thank you." And shut the door, turning quickly to get back to Sherlock. John wheeled the oxygen tank through to the bedroom, the large duffel bag tucked under his arm, and perched himself next to Sherlock on the bed.
His hands rubbed circles on Sherlock’s back until the coughs subsided and he slumped back into John’s arms. John noted the shivers.
Sherlock shrugged, annoyed that so much of his energy had been wasted on boring things like breathing. "You're the doctor" he replied groggily, clearly exhausted.
Midazolam is a sedation drug. We use it at work to calm distressed patients as well as for aggression and alcohol withdrawal.
"Ambulance" John barked, his hand moving from Sherlock's neck to tilt his chin as he hovered over him. He pulled the oxygen mask off, untangling it from his hair and discarding it on the floor.
When Sherlock had managed to control his breathing again, John got up and went to the kitchen, his mind telling him that Sherlock must be feeling pretty miserable to be okay with help from his brother.
"It's really knocked him on his arse." John sighed. "He just needs some time."
"How did he collapse? Why?"
Things just don't seem to be getting any better for John.
Sherlock was looking at him, eyes narrowed and brow furrowed.
"999, which service do you re-"
John cringed at how close he'd been to needing intubation, recoiled slightly when David told him that BiPap had been a last-ditch attempt at maintaining his airway without intervention.
By the third breath, 2 paramedics were in the room, and John allowed himself to finally sit back, tears stinging his eyes as one placed a bag-valve mask over Sherlock's face and took over his breathing. John would kick Mycroft later for not providing him with one.
"I've come to do a chest x-ray" the girl chirped happily. "I'm Chrissy"
Blood Cultures - A test that checks for disease agents or bacterias present in the blood. A blood sample is grown in a laboratory to check for signs of infection.
He winced slightly as he eyed a clear tube leading off the side of the bed. Catheter, yuk.
"I did." David laughed. "Bet it's weird for you to be on this side of things."
John didn't do much; just sat there, uncomfortable, and watched the goings on in the room. His eyes were burning, and he longed so badly to just close them and sleep.
“39 degrees, you need to cool down” John said sternly. Sherlock sensed an edge of panic in his words.
“Sherlock? What the hell are yo-“
Small talk followed, and John forced himself to engage in conversation as they walked out to the nurses’ station together. They sat side by side behind the desk, John's knees knocking on the edge of the table in front of him.
Seems I've caught a writing bug, 2 chapters in 3 days?? That's unlike me!
He'd come to a slow realisation that he really had fucked up this time.
He hung the antibiotics next to the fluids on the curtain pole, retrieving the paracetamol bottle and throwing it in the bedroom bin."Can I take some blood from you, Sherlock?"
Coming round was a slow process.
And the phone rang dead, just in time for Sherlock to set off coughing again. John set his untouched coffee down on the kitchen side and made his way swiftly to his flatmate's side. His hands found their way into Sherlock's dark curls, brushing them away from his face as his body shook from exertion.
"I don't remember." He said quietly.
He smiled slightly to her, the whites of his knuckles gripping to the bed rails in front of him for support. He couldn't worry about it; Sherlock needed him to be strong.
John smiled back at her, and she picked up his chart. "How are you feeling?"
He had never been amazing at handling John's PTSD, but at least he could have been there to remind him to breathe; to make him a cup of tea once it was all over.
"My back is aching, would you help me lie down John?" Sherlock asked. John shook his head slightly.
"Now then." He said loudly. "Shall we get you up to sit with Sherlock?"
"Thank you, Mycroft. How's Sherlock?" John changed the subject quickly.
John helped Sherlock lie down, fluffing his pillows and moving the blanket up until it covered him fully. He pulled the flannel from the bowl of water on the table, ringing it out and placing it carefully on his forehead. Sherlock sighed at the cooling sensation it brought, and John stroked a hand through his hair as his eyes started to close.
Clearly, three days in bed could do that to you.
Mycroft nodded a hello to David as he stepped out of the room, and John wondered how the man had got hold of his phone in the first place.
John rubbed a hand idly over the back of his neck.
"Well done mate, you've done a good job." One of the paramedics said to John. She was young, ginger hair cut to a bob at her chin. She was disconnecting monitors and attaching Sherlock to new ones. "What happened?"
"I can't. I'm not enough for him, Mycroft." He sighed. "He nearly died today, and it's my fault."
As if on que, a knock on the door sounded, closely followed by David sticking his head through the door. He smiled to the two men, and Mycroft swiftly got to his feet. John noticed the black umbrella in his hand.
She leaned over to Greg quickly, and John strained in an attempt to hear her. Greg nodded in response to whatever was said, and she flashed a grin in John's direction before nipping out of the room.
Breathe.
"I'm alright." The detective replied. The words were clipped, and John knew how angry he must be at himself.
Aimee was stood in the doorway, smiling sadly in his direction.
"Thank god for that, I was about to die of boredom." The detective exclaimed loudly, throwing himself unceremoniously into a blue plastic chair by John's bed. John couldn't help a small smile.
John didn't know what to do with himself. The paramedics moved Sherlock swiftly onto a waiting gurney and he found himself following idly behind as they carried him down the stairs.
"I wouldn't dream of it." He replied.
"The doctors will talk to you for a minute and then we'll take it out, okay? I'm not going anywhere."
"Get better, brother." He patted his hand gently against Sherlock's shoulder and straightened himself, looking over at John.
Stat rate - the fastest speed at which you can give fluids through an IV cannula. In this case, through the use of a pump. Stat fluid is given in patients with low blood pressure, and to replace existing fluid loss in the body.
Sherlock was slumped on the floor, barely propped up by the wall behind his head. His skin was pale and sweat beaded across his forehead, dampening his dark curls, sticking some to his head while others stuck out unceremoniously. His clothes had obviously not changed for days, and his shirt remained on him only by the fastening of one button in the middle.
Sherlock nodded meekly, coughing slightly under his oxygen mask. John glanced over at the monitor; sats still 92%. John hooked his arms under Sherlock's and pulled, helping the other man to sit up straight. Chrissy placed a board behind his back and Sherlock sat against it.
Sherlock ignored that comment.
The needle was in, blood taken and back out again in less than a minute, and Sherlock found himself genuinely impressed. John pressed a piece of gauze to the site, securing it with tape.
"Nice to see you back with us, Doctor Watson." She beamed. "I'm Aimee, I'm the nurse that's been looking after you. Is there anything I can do for you?"
"What happened?"
"I hear you have some questions for me, Sherlock?" He said, pulling a blue plastic chair into the room with him and perching beside Sherlock's bed.
"Levofloxacin." John replied, attaching it to the open port of Sherlock's IV line. "Antibiotics."
John looked up at the monitors for himself. Sats were good; everything seemed stable. He let himself have a small moment of relief.
He rose from his chair, exchanged the usual pleasantries with the doctor and walked briskly to Sherlock’s room, closing the door hard against the frame and cringing at the loud bang it created. He was dizzy, wobbling on the spot. He stood with his back against the door for a few minutes, eyes closed and trying to slow his too-fast breathing.
He moved the stethoscope around, checking both lungs thoroughly before removing it and putting it back in his bag. John moved his hand back down to Sherlock’s wrist, taking it in his hand and pressing three fingers to feel his pulse thrumming there.
The world was still foggy, but significantly better than he remembered. He couldn't describe it as pain, but there was definitely an uncomfortable pressure in his chest that he couldn't quite shift. Breathing wasn't difficult, but he had to focus to pull enough air into his lungs.
"I know what sepsis is." Sherlock interrupted. "How has he contracted it?"
The ceiling was bright white painted tiles, and as John looked down at himself, he noticed the familiar pattern of a hospital gown.
As if on que, a short woman walked in, obviously a nurse. She smiled sweetly at John, her short blonde hair reminding him of the young Marilyn Monroe.
There was rustling downstairs when John bowed his head again.
Then he did something he had never done before. Something he had dreamed about for a long time, only the person in front of him was not the one from his dreams. Or was it?
"Well, you seem so rushed. Has something happened? Tell me."
--How?--
Mike Stamford was now on the lookout. He seemed to have fallen asleep. Molly let sand trickle through her fingers. "I think I have to go, my father will kill me." John frowned. Molly's father was never at home, but he understood the clue and nodded. "Okay see you tomorrow?" "Sure," grinned Molly and punched him in the shoulder in a friendly manner.
"You can sleep in my room if you want."
Sherlock opened his laptop. Instead of Googling Owen Farrell, he opened the online school paper.
--Holmes SH--
John shook his head. Sherlock's phone vibrated.
"Oh, you know exactly who."
The front door slammed shut and John stood in his room undecided. Then he let himself fall onto his bed, moaning.
Sherlock couldn't, because his body obeyed him only after a great delay. Instead, he took out his mobile phone from his pocket (he had changed by now) and wrote a message to Mycroft saying something like this: Delete the fucking online newspaper or I'll kill myself.
"What are you going to do now, huh? I'm not Jim? I'm not worth as much as him? I don't beat you up for fun? All I can do is make coffee like a 17th century housewife?" he burst out.
John Watson was late. Again. He ran through the streets panting, laboriously dragging his bag behind him. It was summer. One of the hottest days in July. Sweat ran down his face. Finally he reached the changing rooms. He threw the bag into his locker, changed and went outside.
--Just stay where you are--
--But honestly, do you do this to every person you text with?--
--Sorry, who's this? I stupidly didn't save your number:)--
John nodded and thought about it for a moment.
--make me a better person--
Mycroft answered.
That was it. In about ten seconds, their entire friendship would be over.
Sherlock wanted to hear those words come out of that mouth again in that tone of voice.
"Sorry," he mumbled. "I didn't mean to hurt you...I just didn't think you...and I...were really friends."
"Clever boy."
Mycroft turned up his nose at the sour smell. "Couldn't you at least have flushed?"
John gulped. "Oh" and Sherlock broke. He clung to John's hand and sobbed. The latter hesitated briefly. Then he pulled his friend into a very wet hug. Water sloshed over the edge of the bathtub. Sherlock buried his face in the crook of John's neck and he felt every single tear. "She told you so," he muttered into Sherlock's hair. "You're not a sociopath. Here's the proof." He smiled.Something like a tortured laugh echoed through the bathroom. "Of course she was right."
Sherlock shook his head violently and pointed to the window. The face was still there. Mycroft flinched for a moment then he went and opened the window.
John, too, had had to experience this kind of revenge himself. But unlike any other person on the planet, he had looked at Sherlock excitedly and said: Fantastic!
"I care what Jim thinks of me." "Even after what he did yesterday? This guy hates you. He's cruel, he's creepy, he's an asshole. Why don't you fight back?"
--Obviously--
The headline said:
As soon as John left the hospital, he took a deep breath. "What was that?" he asked a little confused. These eyes didn't let go of him all the way home. He opened the door of the small flat and went into the kitchen. It smelled of smoke. His mother sighed in front of the oven. John giggled before going into the room he shared with Harry. She wasn't there. He sat on his bed and stared at the wall for a while. And he felt like Sherlock's eyes were staring back. Then his cell phone vibrated. John winced.
His parents weren't home. His brother gave him the last shred of security. Less than three seconds later the door slammed open. "Sherlock?
he wrote and sat down on the armchair in the living room.
The school corridors were like cleaned out. Hurriedly he slipped into the right classroom and faded out the annoying comments of the teacher. Sherlock had always wondered how his general knowledge of English literature would help him in life and he always came to the conclusion that it wouldn't help him at all. The schoolbell rang. Hastily, all the students rushed out of the room. The teacher called him. "William, you know- " "Sherlock. " Sherlock interrupted him. "I'm sorry?" The man seemed confused. "My name's Sherlock, not William." "Oh, yes, well, um, as you know, it's perfectly all right if you need some time off after your mother's death and don't go to school for a while. Well, because ever since then..." He pointed at Sherlock's forehead. "...the...fights have become more frequent. Maybe it'd be better if I took you off classes for a while." "Oh, have you finally realised people can actually live without English literature?" Sherlock asked mockingly, grinning. "Besides, I would call it a fight if both parties would take an active part in it. In fact, I never punched any of them."
-Calm down -
--And I'm drugged--
--I am a terrible person--
The steps came closer again. Sherlock breathed a sigh of relief.
John put the coffee in front of him and sat down next to him in silence. "Thank you," Sherlock said, smiling at him. John raised his eyebrows. "What have I done to deserve this, you're talking to me. And I don't think I've ever seen you smile."
--Alex?--
"No, God damn it, Sherlock!" John swallowed and clenched his fists.
He took a deep breath. Maybe he could change schools on short notice.
Maybe, just maybe John wasn't so bad after all.
Sherlock slowly reached for John's hand, clasping it, finger by finger.
So he found himself laboriously climbing up the gutter of the house. The window was a little bit open. That was good, because he would not have known what to do if that had not been the case. Carefully he glided into the familiar room. "Sherlock?" he whispered. There was no reply. John looked around. Everything looked the same. The bathroom door was open. There was a hissing sound. He slowly walked towards the door and pushed it all the way open.
He let them do their work. He gasped through his hair. Mike tried to get rid of the people. One of the paramedics came up to John. “Hey, you did well. He'll get back on his feet. ” He looked around at the stretcher on which the boy was now lying. "Without you he would probably have died." John smiled. "Thats my job." "Mine too." laughed the sani.
Sherlock's eyelids grew heavy. His head pounded. Someone patted his cheek. He groaned. Then everything around him went black.
Sherlock walked hurriedly through the streets of the neighbourhood. It was a time when there were no buses. He knew this because he had to walk every time he overslept.
"So what?" John looked at him with a penetrating look. "Since when do you care what anybody thinks of you?"
Lanky, tall, bony. Very unathletic. Very unhumorous. Very unpopular.
"What no! What, are you crazy?!" Sherlock shook his head in a hurry. "I'm never going to sleep again!"
-You look so dreamy-
--Oh, it's you--
"Coffee?" asked John and lifted a thermos. Sherlock stepped aside without a word and let him enter. John smiled. Back in the living room he sat down slowly on an armchair and looked around. "Is that a real skull?" he asked, sounding a little worried. "Friend of the family... Well, Mum says friend." John nodded and raised an eyebrow. Redbeard ran excitedly into the room and immediately fixed on John. He let the friendly face shower go over him as he gently pushed the setter away. "You have a dog?" Sherlock nodded. " Apparently. " John scratched Redbeard behind the ears. "Can I stay here all day? My... " "Dad drank after the match yesterday, and he's hung over and aggressive. " Sherlock nodded. "Yes, you can." John rolled his eyes. "Thanks."
Outside was John. Astonished, he looked at Sherlock, who looked down at himself and blushed a little.
--Not you--
Let's get to the second part of his screwed-up life.
"I think it's funny."
Sherlock frowned.
Jim was different. Just like him. Except Jim was popular. Very handsome. Very charismatic. Very funny and athletic. He was captain of the rugby team. And so far away from everything that Sherlock was.
Breathing heavily, Sherlock slammed the door shut and leaned against the wall. John laughed. He was free, felt alive. "This..." he gasped. "This was something, wasn't it?" Sherlock slumped to the floor. "Definitely." He smiled. "What exactly do you mean?" he added. John sat down too and ran his fingers through his hair. "Everything. "Sherlock fell silent. He looked at his fingers. "You got your watch back, then? "Yeah, Stamford brought it over." Silence. For a long time, they just sat next to each other. It wasn't uncomfortable, John could have been like that for hours, as long as Sherlock was close by.
