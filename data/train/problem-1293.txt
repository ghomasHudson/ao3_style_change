"Oh, is that who that was? My apologies! Really I mean it!" Lied the Detective through his teeth as the handcuffs were clasped around his wrists. Donovan stepped out from the alleyway behind her boss and then rounding around to the front of Sherlock who laid on the cold ground.
Sherlock went to the canvas bag that sat next to the flat's front door, unzipping it as Gladstone waddled over and tried to climb in. "No, no. You aren't going anywhere." He mumbled to the puppy, lightly patting him on the head as he pulled out John's flak jacket and military trousers along with socks and such. But something caught his eye, dog tags at the bottom on the bag. They weren't John's, these belonged to someone else. A Sam Fraiser, blood type A positive and religion Pegan. Sherlock held them up, observing them closely. There were scratches in the metal, small dents and dried flecks of blood. This had to belong to someone who passed away, someone John had cared deeply for. But these were not British Military issued tags, these were American. "John?" Sherlock called as he placed the tags back into the bag, carrying the clothes to the washer with the rest in the kitchen. "Who is Sam Fraiser?" He asked, but got no response for what felt like an eternity.
“Oh, what would that be?” He asked, shifting the weight from one foot to the other. His demeanor becoming more relaxed.
"What the fu-" Lestrade collapsed onto the floor, followed by Mycroft who had quickly pulled a handkerchief from his suit pocket. The Government official was coughing madly as he slid down the wall next to the door as he breathed in the smoke.
John blinked in surprise, tilting his head. "Sherlock, you don't have to do that, honestly, I'm okay."
“How did he lose his right leg?” Sherlocked asked, hoping his curiosity did not come off as rude.
"Oh please, it is nothing really." Sherlock said, rubbing the back of his neck. John stopped suddenly, his brow furrowing. He slowly looked up at Sherlock, realization coming over him.
John grinned. "I have a habit of flirting with cute guys, also guys who save my ass in a tight situation."
“No theatre around here Captain, could be a late class.” He said, mentioning the campus on the same block. “But I don’t know a lot of students who have their own vehicles.”
John stood at the end of Regent's Park on the Outer circle left of Macclesfield Bridge, he was observing, watching for cops. He looked dead ahead to The Hub across the grass where this person told him to meet them, he could see a figure sitting at one of the tables outside at a picnic bench. He weighed his options, wondering if this was a trap, or indeed a friend. He sighed, adjusting the duffel bag hanging off his left shoulder, his hand resting on the thick canvas material. He started to walk out of the park, shaking his head until he heard his phone beep with a text tone.
Sherlock nodded slowly as he deduced John quietly, his eyes slowly sliding in their sockets to his left shoulder. "I hate to ask, but how close was your injury to your heart? It must have been close, possibly shattered the scapula?" He asked quietly as John brought his hand up to his shoulder. Fingers pressing over, what he considered, an ugly mark.
Sherlock smiled at the pup resting in John’s lap and then at the Medic himself. “You, Captain Watson, have yourself a deal.”
"If any of you are watching this, I would like to thank you for the supplies..." The Captain's eyes were smiling, but they had the 'Thousand-yard' stare, the look of any man or woman who had seen enough to traumatize the average human.
John just smiled, shrugging his shoulders. “At least I didn’t get overpowered by a kid.”
“Yes, it was unexpected.” John said with a smile, petting the pup in his lap absentmindedly. “I hadn’t heard from Sam in almost ten years, the last I saw of them they were headed to South Korea with his family to be stationed there. Then…” John trailed off to take a deep breath, anxiously rubbing Gladstone’s soft little ears. “One day I was in the canteen, in Afghanistan, when someone hugged me from behind. You could imagine my surprise seeing a face that looked all so familiar yet so grown up and beaming with joy.” John smiled now; eyes distant as he relived that moment. “It was like we never separated for all of those years; it was like we were kids again on an adventure to make the world a safer place. Helping people, playing with the kids in the streets, and secretly sharing rations with them. ‘Real-life superheroes’, Sam called us.” John said with a toothy smile now.
Sherlock smiled, the corner of his lips turning up as he too took in the sight of the Captain. He was even more stunning in the daytime, his greying blonde hair looked like glowing gold in the afternoon sun. Those smiling eyes made his heart beat faster, his hands tingled with unknown energy. "Hello, Captain." He said fondly, extending his hand to the empty space between them. "Have a seat, will you?" He asked, his movements slow as if he was dealing with a wild animal.
John couldn’t help but tear up, sighing as he ran a hand through his hair. “Sherlock, I want to thank you for everything. I want to thank you for trying to help me, it means a lot. But I can’t have you locked up either, guilty by association as they say. Anything I do here? You will catch the heat too; you will go to jail with me.”
John chuckled, smiling wide. "I am the Doctor here, shouldn't I be the one giving you this speech?" He asked teasingly, lightly smacking Sherlock's hand that rested just centimeters from his.
"You have connections to the homeless?" John asked, eyes wide as Sherlock nodded.
“We’ll have you play the hostage too!” Sherlock said, smiling. “Nothing is more convincing of a Captain gone mad than holding one of his own platoon members hostage!”
Sherlock nodded, making a mental note of the preferred pronouns this Sam used, not wanting to misgender anyone out of respect of their memory. “What happened to them?” He asked as John fished the phone from his pocket, studying the Veteran closely. “I take something tragic happened. Fatally shot?” He asked gently as John turned his flip phone to the detective, setting it in his palm.
"Well you did save my ass the day before yesterday and you had a phone specially encrypted to just talk to me. I say that is pretty impressive." John murmured as he worked, flipping over the map now as he wrote names and medical advice.
The little girl scoffed. “I’m six and a half, what are they going to do? Ground me? Besides, I have a mask on like you! He didn’t see who I was!”
John shrugged. "Sure, I just have to tell Kaitlyn about my plans. Hopefully, she doesn't chew me out for staying with you. She doesn't trust anyone that isn't in a military uniform, she has had some bad run-ins with civilians. Oh, that's my technology specialist, Kaitlyn Briars. I wonder how London will react to me taking three days off... Hopefully, no one goes lighting cars on fire or picking on the homeless."
The mic came on with a flood of noise, the other SWAT member having to shout into his radio. “We have a situation out here! We have at least fifty civilians carrying weapons looking for a fight!”
"Oh, just out for a stroll!" Sherlock practically wheezed out from under the weight of the Inspector, a shit-eating grin on his face. Lestrade wasn't having it tonight, their suspect just got away.
“Then hold it to my back! Do something! Don’t you understand!? My brother ‘is’ the British Government! If you take ‘me’ hostage then they’ll have to make a deal with you!”
“I’m not going to hold a gun to your head!” John whispered harshly.
"The sorrow we feel when we lose a loved one is the price we pay to have had them in our lives."  - Rob Liano.
Lestrade looked to Sherlock who had been uncharacteristically quiet through this whole ordeal, the Detective was merely watching and analyzing like his brother, his head cocked to the side. "Sherlock!" Lestrade yelled, snapping Sherlock out of his trance. "Is this really the type of friends you want to be making!?" Asked the Inspector who put away his gun and fumbled with his keys for the handcuffs. Sherlock smiled.
I want to thank you all for reading, this chapter took eight hours to write. I hope you enjoy!
John gulped, nearly dropping his phone. This was getting very dangerous. Whoever he was texting was smart, dangerously smart. They pegged Staff Sargent Katilyn Briars, his technology specialist from a kilometer away. He looked back down at his phone, unsure what he could even reply with, but thankfully the unknown number texted him again.
And still, when someone automatically assumes they’re a couple, they refuse to talk about it.
“John, you… you tricked me!” Sherlock gasped. He didn’t seem upset, if anything he sounded more surprised that John was able to mislead him, than anything else.
“Alright. Yes, I’d like that.” Sherlock said, suppressing a smile. “And I think I know just were we should go.”
– have anything left –
It was the active crimes that helped the most. There was far less time to dwell on unwanted feelings when there were bodies to examine, evidence to collect and test, suspects to chase, and Anderson to snipe at. However, active investigations did not stop the pang Sherlock felt when he realized just how much he wanted a medical consultant on hand.

“Harr, I don’t know what to say. That was beautiful.”
John inched ever closer to Sherlock, his focus jumping between Sherlock’s eyes and his mouth. “Because you what?” he breathed.
“Wait! He can go? Why can’t I see him now?” Sherlock cried, trying to wheel himself after the surgeon and Mr. Watson.
want you to get your scarf back,” Sherlock said weakly, not looking John in the face as he spoke, “but that was more of an excuse.”
“Yes, really. And like you said, it’s been very inconvenient and utterly distracting. I’m not sure how I’ve even managed most days.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but swallowed the pills with a swig of water all the same. John really could be ridiculously stubborn at times. But it wouldn’t hurt to humor him, and Sherlock found the pain far more uncomfortable than what he was used to.
“Nerve endings – in different parts of the body – register sensation –
Deducing the wait staff (and guests once John was suitably convinced), for John was like Christmas. John not only listened to Sherlock’s deductions, but he actively encouraged them, even trying his hand at it a few more times. Grinning up at Sherlock, his deep blue eyes shining with admiration, John expressed every possible variant of remarkable or amazing, in the English language. Sherlock couldn’t stop himself from beaming back down at John. Just looking at John, with his neat blond hair, defined jaw, and nose that crinkled just so as he laughed, made the now familiar nervous, excited, and intoxicating flutter in Sherlock’s chest, fill his entire being.
“For as long as he wants me around.” John snaps his mouth shut. He wasn't ready to admit that to even himself, let alone to Mycroft Holmes.
Well, so much for being the one to start a conversation. “Absolutely.” Sherlock said, turning to face John. “Putting the emphasis on the second syllable makes it sound like it adds a phosphate group instead of removes it. Completely different function.”
“Oh, feel free to feel like an arse, just not about this.” Sherlock grinned, ducking to avoid the pen John threw at him.
Because of the way the bullet entered his shoulder, in conjunction with the infection, John’s dominant hand is rendered completely useless for trauma and battlefield surgery. So, just over nine and half years after hugging his mother and sister goodbye, John returns to England with a shaking left hand, a limp, and a complete lack of direction.
John smiled up at Sherlock, and gave his waist what he hoped was a reassuring squeeze. “As you were saying?”
John didn’t hurt him.
Sherlock raised his voice. “Mrs. Hudson, please!” The conversation needed to come to an end, immediately.
“Yes, yes. Well, we had planned on coming to you in the morning, but since we’re here,” Mr. Holmes shot Sherlock another reassuring look, “would you be so kind as to let us have a look at it ourselves?”
John just laughed, and let Sherlock’s beautiful song wash over them as their movements slowed down to a sway.
“So you think we should combat his connections with ours?” Sherlock sounded skeptical.
“Exactly,” he breathed against John’s lips, “and I’m always right.”
“I’m not doing anything.” Lestrade frowned, looking up at Sherlock.
Well, the boys seem to have come to an agreement. Let's see how that goes!
“Oh… Oh no, no it’s fine.” John said, sounding a bit…disappointed. “Something important come up?”
“Sherlock! Sherlock wait!” Sherlock forced himself to stop at the end of the hall to allow a panting Molly to catch up to him. Normally he’d have just kept going, but these weren’t normal circumstances, and though he loathed to admit it, he might just need the support.
didn't
“It’s not –”
“Lucky bastard.”
Once they both come down, and clean up, Sherlock kisses John deeply. Just like with Sherlock’s, neither says a word about John’s declaration. This isn’t the last time either of them says ‘I love you’, but each time it is said in the heat of the moment, and each time they choose to ignore it.
“Oi! I find your lack of faith disturbing. We’ll get to the finals!” John said, giving Sherlock another shove. “But seriously, we ought to do something, even if it’s as simple as you blowing out the candle on a cupcake after takeaway and case files.”
As it turned out, morning sex was even better then it was cracked up to be. And after tea, some hastily thrown together sandwiches, and a very long and very indulgent shared shower, they discovered that early afternoon, mid-afternoon, late-afternoon, and evening sex were all pretty fantastic too. Then again, having sex with the man you’re in love with – doing anything with the man you’re in love with – was always bound to be pretty fantastic, no matter the time of day.
You know the drill, I love comments and corrections!!
“Of course.” John nodded. “It just feels great to know that I’m not actually stuck anymore, that I actually can get over things.”
*******
"Forget it happened?”
There was a brief moment of silence as John seemed to consider… something, and then suddenly Sherlock felt John start shaking, devolving into a fit of giggles. It was contagious and Sherlock soon found himself joining John, laughing harder than he had in a long time.
“You know what I mean. He’s not getting what he wants. I’m not joining him, you’re not leaving me. We’re not giving him what he wants.” Sherlock huffed, batting away John’s hand, and tried to inspect the developing bruises around John’s neck.
“Oh, good. Good.”
“Aren’t you coming?”
Thursday…”
confused frown, back on his face. “Told me, I mean. You said you’ve wanted to kiss me every time you’ve seen me. Why
“Did you… do you want it to mean something else?” John sounded nervous.
“Ah ok. Then Tuesday it is.”
Well, there was only one way to figure that out.
“Seriously, John, I can’t tell you how happy I am that you’re moving in. Sherlock really needs this.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Says the man who invaded Afghanistan.”
, Sherlock thought ruefully. But he felt he owed it to John, he felt John deserved to know. Why he felt that, Sherlock wasn’t sure, he just did.
John frowned and turned back to face Sherlock. “Try anything?”
aren't
“Do you mind if just… closed my eyes… just for a second?” John murmured drowsily when the hands and kisses had stopped, and they were just breathing together.
“Just humor me, Sherlock. A few more days aren’t going to kill you.” John could feel a headache coming on. Forget grey by twenty-five, he’d be grey by twenty-one in a half. He might actually be dead by twenty-five. And Mike’s amused snickering from the living room wasn’t helping matters.
Think. He needed to think. He had an extraordinary mind; if he used it, he could find a way to fix everything. He just needed to think. He’d have asked Mrs. Hudson, but she left for her sisters that morning – really inconvenient that. What would she suggest? Apologize, obviously, but he couldn’t just say “Sorry, John. I was rude” and leave it at that.
“Best?!” Sherlock snapped, finally turning around. He never was good at ignoring Mummy. “How is this best?”
“I really don’t. And don’t think I don’t know you have a camera installed in the dashboard.”
“Team bonding time?” God, what if John really was just humoring him? He couldn’t have John resenting him for taking him away from his team. They had just won the championship the day before, surely they’d still want to be all together to enjoy the victory. He shouldn’t have asked, he really shouldn’t have asked.
“Ugghh, fine.” Sherlock groaned. “But I’m only cooperating because you called my arse gorgeous.” And with a preening smirk, he strutted into the bathroom.
“I don’t know, John,” Sarah said, leaning in conspiratorially, “they guy you described sounded like he might be the type who might just enjoy that kind of thing.”
“Maybe it is, but I wanted make sure you know just how awful lying to me about food is,” John said, one side of his mouth quirking up in a teasing grin, as he tried to hail a cab. “Any idea where you want to go?”
“John –”
“Well this time it’s just text.” John laughed. “You’re going to try to punch me in the face, and I’m going to stop you… from punching me in the face.”
Sherlock was totally blushing.
“Actually, I do. I’m – I’m meeting someone soon. I’m meeting my partner. He should be – he should be here momentarily.” Sherlock managed to say, his voice nowhere near as steady, nor as aloof or confidant, as he had wanted. He was better than this; he was not going to let Theo get to him like this. Theo was the very last person he wanted to see him shaken, it would only have vindicated everything Theo had said about him all those years ago.
Let me know what you think, good or bad, I'm always looking for ways to improve!
“But this is what I wear every day. If I have to use what I learn here I’ll be wearing something similar to this.” Sherlock frowned. “Shouldn’t I learn how to move in what I’ll be wearing when I need it?”
With a night like they had, one can only imagine what the morning after will be like.
Sherlock shook his head. “No. No, also for how I acted since returning to the flat this afternoon. I took out the issues that I have with… with medical centers, I took them out on you, and that was not fair of me. You did not deserve to be the target when they are my own problems,” he said in nearly one breath, before stopping. The next part proved far harder than he had anticipated.
Dropping a limp arm over the side of the bed, Sherlock grabbed his discarded pants to wipe up the mess that painted his chest and stomach, before offering it to John. Whoever said he wasn’t a thoughtful host? Once both were sufficiently clean, Sherlock pulled John against him, reclaiming his lips with slow, sloppy kisses, and ran his hands in lazy circles against John’s back; John’s hands having found their way back into Sherlock’s sex mussed curls.
Perhaps it was an unconscious fear of repeating the misunderstanding that almost derailed their relationship before it began – Sherlock was not going to let that ever happen again. Or maybe it was simply because that was who John was, an unapologetic romantic. Whatever the reason, Sherlock just counted himself lucky to be the one John Watson kissed, not that he started believing in something as puerile as luck. For one year, four months, seven days, nineteen hours, and twenty-six minutes, Sherlock had been the one John Watson kissed, the one John Watson came home too, the one John Watson held and told about his day, the one to make John Watson smile and laugh. Sherlock could not think of anyone he’d rather be, and could not think of a better way to spend that one year, four months, seven days, nineteen hours, and twenty-six minutes.
Eddie’s face paled as his eyes grew wide. “Shit!” he exclaimed, backing up. “Seb, he’s Holmes’s boyfriend! My friend Xander is on the football team with him, he says the two of them are always together.”
“It’s a bit late for me to change my mind now.” John chuckled. “And yeah, I am more than happy to be riding with you.”
Sherlock would have cut out his own tongue before ever admitting it, but John’s help, his insistence he keep up with the stretches and exercises Heather assigned, and his constant – and annoying – reminders that Sherlock take his pain meds, may have contributed to the speed at which he recovered. Out loud, Sherlock insisted it was just because his body healed far faster than those of normal people. The look John gave him every time he said it told him John was not buying it, but that hardly mattered. Sherlock would withstand all the disbelieving looks John could throw at him, just as long as John kept up whatever he was doing, because whatever it was, Sherlock was sure it was helping. Again, his tongue would be cut off before John ever knew that.
John meets someone else from the Holmes siblings' past, and he and Whitney go on their date.
Deep breathe in, he could do this.
Compromised brain function, John didn’t want to even entertain the possibility. Sherlock’s mind was a thing of wonder, there was nothing Sherlock valued above his intellect. If he lost any of the speed, lost even one of those brilliant connections, if he was even the slightest bit more like ‘the ordinary people’, Sherlock would be devastated. John would always love him not matter what – nothing was ever going to change that – but John didn’t know how he would handle seeing Sherlock suffer like that.
“I believe that was you.” Sherlock retorts and both burst out laughing, the laughter eventually turning into lazy kisses. After several minutes of roaming hands and exploring mouths, Sherlock starts to pull away.
“I’m not exactly sure I understand why they’d think that,” John said eventually, “but I guess you know him better than I do.”
left. John free, John alive, that has ‘hope’ written all over it.”
,” John laughed. “That’s literally just the last half of your first name.”
Sherlock vision began to blur as he felt his eyes prickle, this was definitely a dream. “I love… I love everything about you too, even the annoying, ‘we should be careful’ and ‘cadavers need to stay in the anatomy lab’ parts of you.”
Next chapter is the last chapter before the epilogue. The boys learn what went on when they were captured, and the start the recovery process.
Sherlock just lifted an eyebrow, clueless as he was to many things, he wasn’t completely oblivious to how that sounded.
“You’re never an imposition, Sherlock, never.” John sighed. “Remember, I’ve been trying to get you to come out and watch.”
Finally, after several moments of silence, Sherlock managed to find his voice – and some semblance of poise – again. “It seems pointless to pay for more than one room. A single double room is reasonable.”
Christ, John didn’t think his own name had ever sounded so attractive in his life. He actually felt his heart jump. He had to actively remind himself to breath for a second. It had been so long since he’d actually felt that pull towards another human being, he’d almost forgotten what it felt like.
They have some pretty smart women in their lives, don't they? One more chapter to go, and all will be put right.
– I can take more.”
“Sherlock,” John said slowly, more confused than ever, “I don’t have a girlfriend.”
“You shouldn't, but you need me, so you do. Come on John.” And with that, Sherlock is through the door, and starting up the steps. John, just shrugging at the inspector, follows Sherlock into the building.
What the hell just happened? Seriously, what the hell?
,” John growled, wrenching one of Sebastian’s arms up even higher. “I’ve been known to have a bit of a temper, and your little friends just ran away. Do you feel that?” he asked, wrenching Sebastian’s arm again. “That’s your axillary nerve, and that’s it being pinched, being damaged. You’re really not in any position to piss me off.”
“Yes, apologies, Lestrade.” Sherlock said with a quick nod, then not bothering to enjoy the twin looks of surprise on both Lestrade and Sally’s faces for too long, started making his way into Julia Stoner’s flat. “Come along, John.”
It didn’t take long before the kisses turned urgent, their lips parting only briefly to breathe before crashing back together. John’s hands moved of their own accord, shoving the silk dressing gown off Sherlock’s shoulders – the man never did bother getting dressed – and snaked their way under his t-shirt. John could feel as every muscle of Sherlock’s warm, smooth back moved.  If so inclined, he could count everyone one of Sherlock’s ribs and vertebra. John wanted to – needed to – learn every part of the man on top of him. He had to touch, to feel, every inch he could get his hands on.
Nothing will fix my phone, but maybe some of your lovely comments could put a bit of a smile on my face. Plus they can calm me for my flight
It was ridiculous and he knew it. The needed to talk, and he knew they needed to slow things down before they let it go too far. Given everything he was feeling, it could get out of hand very fast. It was pretty monumental what they were doing, moving from friends and flatmates to something decidedly more, their friendship was possibly on the line should things go belly up. They needed to talk, but John couldn’t find it in himself to stop. John was too focused on the feel of the kiss deepening, Sherlock’s tongue sliding against his bottom lip and dipping into his mouth. John was too focused on the softness of Sherlock’s curls, the roughness of the slight stubble on Sherlock’s cheek. John was too focused on the feel of Sherlock’s fingertips tightening their grip in his waist, as if giving John a most welcomed brand. They had to talk, and they would talk, but at that moment, John had to kiss Sherlock to make up for every moment he’d wanted to and denied himself in the past three months. Now that he was kissing Sherlock Holmes, he didn’t know how to stop, and he never wanted to stop.
“Temporarily, Sherlock, temporarily.” John sighed, rolling his eyes. “You broke your leg, you’re not in an iron lung.”
Since the end of the formal physical therapy sessions with Heather, John had seemed to take it upon himself to ensure Sherlock did not back slide in his recovery. First thing each morning he had Sherlock do his stretches, then two repeats of the exercises, then depending what they did that day, he did another round of exercises around lunch time – John insisted he actually eat lunch as well – finally he had to do two more rounds and cool down stretches in the evening. Normally Sherlock would have taken issue with anyone telling him what to do and when like that, but it was John, and he looked genuinely happy when Sherlock complied, so comply Sherlock did. Within the first week the cane was no longer needed, and as time wore on, Sherlock’s limp became less and less noticeable. Sherlock started accompanying John to Regent’s Park, first on walks, then jogs, and then eventually actual runs. It was because of these runs – which he only did as part of his recovery, and absolutely not because of the way John looked in his running shorts and t-shirt, or because of what the wind did to John’s hair, absolutely not – that Sherlock came to the realization that John was an utter, hateful bastard.
“Oh come on! You gotta relax. You look like you’re facing a firing squad.” Laughed Bill, clasping John on his shoulder. At least it was his good shoulder, thank God for small mercies.
“Now that I can believe.” John laughed. “And if you’re serious about that invite…”
“Cold cases, John,” Sherlock huffed. “Measly scraps, that’s all they are. No active investigations, no suspects to chase down, not fresh samples to test.”
“Better ways of going about it though.” Lestrade sighed. “Alright Mrs. Rachlin, I’m going to need Emily’s contact information so we can ask her some questions.” Mrs. Rachlin nodded. “Good. I also think you should probably get some rest, you’ve had a very difficult evening.”
“Oh come on,” John rolled his eyes, “elves are all tall, and fair, and beautiful, and powerful; far more than regular men. Plus they have that whole ‘we know more than everyone else here’ thing going on. That describes you to a tee, love.”
“Admit it, my being pushy helped you.”
“Simple. Your haircut, and the way you hold yourself says military. I know you were abroad because your face is tanned, but there does not appear to be any tan lines above your wrists. No one wears long sleeves whilst holidaying in the sun. Not to mention you’re acclimatized to danger and have a therapist who correctly thinks your limp is psychosomatic. Not really a giant leap, wouldn’t you say?”
~***~
John let out a sigh, he couldn’t believe he was going to do this.
“Carl never had a history of seizures,” Sherlock said, clearing his throat and tamping down the growing pressure, “or epilepsy, or any other type of neurological disorder. That, and the police recovered all of his belongings save for his shoes. It never sat well with me.”
“Lestrade.” Oh.
“God help me, I do.” Sherlock sighed, and took a few deep breaths and readjusted himself, making sure there was nothing spoiling the line of his trousers. “I have no idea why, but I do.”
“Well yes, it’s eight-thirty,” Sherlock said, glancing down at his watch, “and you said to meet you here at eight-thirty.”
“Not at present, no.” Sherlock’s eyes never left John’s has he spoke, his voice calm and smooth, if a bit sharp. “I find I’m more committed to my work these days. Romantic entanglements just distract me.”
“What, and risk pissing off both my landlady
Pierce.
“What? And risk over stepping? Not on your life, I’m too much of a coward.” John chuckled, unable to resist tangling his fingers in Sherlock’s curls any longer.
“You’ve proven yourself to be a man of great conviction, I wouldn’t dream of it. I should offer a word of warning though. You’ll want to watch out for his black moods, they can be quite trying when they hit. But no, I really just wanted to offer you my congratulations.” Mycroft’s grin simultaneously smug, off-putting, maniacal, and all-knowing all at the same time.
“And that, John, is where you differ from the average Londoner,” Sherlock smirked again, the light of the candle now reflected in his eyes, and in that instant John thought of all the wonderful, exhausting ways he would have liked to wipe that smirk off his face, many of which were probably illegal or at least severely frowned upon in more puritanical societies.
“You did well also… after I got you thinking. You saw that the intruder showed care for Mrs. Rachlin, and you figured out Emily’s motive.”
“Come on,” Sherlock whined, sliding his hands under John’s suit jacket, “There’s a perfectly good bed upstairs going to waste, and I haven’t really been able to get my hands on you, properly
“Nonsense, I’m the lucky one.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hold on,” he said, stepping forward. “You said your name is John? You’re John Watson, aren’t you?”
still here because I have twenty minutes left of office hours. You can head over to the Yard and I can meet you there when I’m done if you want.”
“Yes I – do –
“Alright, I’ve probably just made the biggest mistake of my life getting into a strange car on the orders of a strange man.” John said, keeping his back straight, staring straight at his possible kidnapper. “What is this all about?” If he was about to be murdered, he might as well face it head on. Maybe Sherlock could be the one to solve it; that’d be a nice little ‘going away, sorry I’m dead’ present.
“A suit? Really?” John said, dropping his own overnight bag in the corner.
“Until the end of time.” Bill grinned. “At least get out of this corner, and go to the bar. Mix, meet people!”
“Your shoulder moved first!” Sherlock huffed. “It was your shoulder moving that triggered your elbow to, as you said, ‘pop out’! If you had told me that in the first place, I would have gotten it!”
He thought
“After I finished university, I decided to stay in Germany to continue my research at Universität Leipzig. Up until I moved back, I had a duel appointment in the linguistics and English departments.”
Five minutes later John was helping Sherlock into the back of a cab – Sherlock’s book bag over one shoulder, his travel bag over the other – and gave the driver the address of the nearest A&E. Sherlock had never felt more pathetic in his life, now there was no way John would ever look at him as anything other than a weakling who needed his protection, and after everything he’d just said… he hated himself. And Sherlock hated himself even more as he leaned against John’s side, as he accepted John’s protection. Pathetic.
Standing in the Holmes’ guest room. John let out a deep breath. This was it, he thought as he slipped the silver band off his finger and settled it back in the velvet box alongside a second, matching band. He had only been wearing it for a minute – just to try it on again – but his hand already felt strange without it. Well, in just under a half hour’s time it would be back on his left hand ring finger, where it belonged, and where it would stay forever.
Poorly stifling a laugh, John grins. “Alright, Marple, I’m going to temp my family’s fate with another drink. Then you are going to tell me about everyone else here.” Perhaps his drinks were already getting to him, while never shy, John had never been this bold with a new acquaintance before.
“I nearly forgot, I have an anniversary gift for you.” Sherlock said, handing John a package and joining him under the fresh linens, “Though I guess it’s technically an engagement gift now.”
“Yeah we do. Don’t tell anyone I told you, but his name’s Jacob Wilson, living in Brixton. His prints were in the system, apparently has a record. B&E, and armed robbery, and some charges for dealing and possession. There wasn’t much evidence on him, but by the looks of it, he most likely overdosed. Horrible waste, only twenty – two. There was time, he could have turned his life around.” Dr. Sanderson mused. Compassion and optimism were clearly Sanderson/Hooper family traits.
“Alright, you’re being ridiculous,” he finally said. “First of all, you’re not really crippled –”
“W – what?” John stumbled, blinking rapidly.
*******
John must have been waiting around for Heather to leave, because not ten minutes after she left, the front door opened, and John came back with a duffle bag, two cardboard boxes, and what looked like a metal under-bed locker. He didn’t ask how therapy went, and for that Sherlock was eternally grateful, he just when straight up to his room, dropped off his stuff, and came back down to the kitchen to put the kettle on.
activities with him, are no secret to me. So I’ll ask again, what is your connection with Sherlock Holmes?” The man’s voice getting hard.
“Since what?”
“And you can –
“Anytime, anyplace, anywhere.” Sherlock whispered, leaning in as close to John as possible. Dr. Flat-Face didn’t need to know, it was for him and John only. “If you want, I’ll let you be my doctor.”
– you feel –
“That’s all I ask. So I guess I’ll see you Sunday, if I don’t see you sooner!”
“John Watson…” Sally grew quiet for a moment, before it dawned on her. “Oh right, you’re the bloke who got him out of that building.”
“You really mean that.”
Well, whoever the faceless future Mrs. Watson was, she didn’t have John yet, John’s time was still his. The expiration date on their closeness was fast approaching, but Sherlock planned on running out the clock.
It started almost immediately. Only a few days after the arrival of the invitation, Sherlock returned to the flat after meeting with Wiggins and some members of his homeless network, to find John on his laptop, flipping through pictures of a small, but elegantly decorated ballroom. It was the venue, it was Hillview House.
“Well, I was going to tell Sherlock and my Mum first. Oh shut up.” John says, shoving Greg as he raises his eyebrows. “I just got back from speaking to a recruiter, and I’m going to join the army. I can help save lives on the battlefield; really put my ability to good use!” John finishes, positively beaming.
Sherlock didn’t normally like having people – partners – on top of him, but it was different with John. He couldn’t get enough of John’s weight on top of him, the pressure of John’s body pinning, pressing him down. Coupled with John taking charge, evidently still very much a military man, it was intoxicating, a better high than Sherlock had felt in quite some time. Thrusting, rocking, gripping, panting, against John wasn’t enough, he wanted, he need –
“Good, because she’s not worth it. But it is time for you to get out there again. I saved your life once, and it’s time for me to save it again!”
“Well of course I knew. I’m not completely out of touch you know. It was written all over your faces that first morning. That, and poor John went about as red as a tomato every time I talked about the two of you.” Mrs. Hudson hummed.
The chicken fettuccini in a white vodka cream sauce turned out to be an excellent choice, as they ended up eating more of it off of each other, than off of the plates. Though they may or may not have intentionally dripped the sauce down their chins, and dropped the noodles on to their chests. Well, at least Sherlock did it on purpose, and something told him John did too. Then there was the chocolate lava cake. The mix of warm chocolate and the taste of John’s skin, was an intoxicating combination that was sure to leave Sherlock reeling for days. The shower they shared to clean off all the residue, was even better. They did have to call down to get a change of sheets – which they replaced themselves, it would have been unfair to make the inn staff deal with that mess – but it was absolutely worth it.
“Teaching assistant.” John corrected.
“I can put Milner on it, and we might be able to compile a list. I can’t make any promises that it will pan out, though.” Lestrade said striding up to Sherlock and his mother, having apparently caught the gist of what they were talking about..
The rest of coffee passes comfortably enough. John spends the time telling Whitney some of the more interesting ways his patients have tried to lie to him. Did that kid honestly think he’d believe they got an STD from a toilet seat? He tells her he’s taken up running, all thanks to her getting rid of his limp. Whitney tells John all about the texts she’s going to be examining, written accounts from a long destroyed abbey.
~***~
“Now that you mention it, I am rather bruised…” Sherlock smirked, lifting an eyebrow.
And so that was how Sherlock found himself sat on the floor of Mrs. Hudson’s kitchen, reading out instructions to John who lay flat on his back, his head under the sink.
They were in the midst of a heated debate over when stalking someone’s social media accounts crosses the line over to just plain stalking, when Sherlock’s doctor showed up with one of the hospital’s physical therapist in tow. It was time to discuss his physical therapy plans. John once again offered to leave to give him some privacy, but Sherlock insisted he stay, he found John to be a calming presence. So John just sat quietly out of the way, reading one of the newspapers Molly brought by, while the therapist outlined her plan.
“Have for you? What makes you think I have something for you?”
“Wouldn’t dream of it.” Sherlock smirked.
“Excellent.”
“It should be a small square nub on the bottom of the unit; you have to turn it clockwise until you feel the flywheel turn freely.”
Grade two was going to be brilliant.
John spends the rest of the day thinking about his conversation with Greg. But there’s really nothing to think about, he knows what he wants. John knows he loves Sherlock, probably has since that first crime scene. And he’s fairly sure Sherlock loves him too. John wants to carry a photo of them together, and tell anyone and everyone that it’s him and his boyfriend, the man he loves. He wants to have someone to write too, knowing he’s missed and loved. He wants to come home on leave, and be greeted by Sherlock’s arms and kisses. John wants to be with Sherlock, totally, completely, and unquestionably. So John sends Sherlock a text, asking if he’s planning on coming over, and sets about making a plan. John is going to tell him about finally deciding on a career path, and then ask Sherlock if he wants to make things real between them. John has never been more nervous in his life, and he’s never been more excited.
“Well, I’d like to think we’re something close to friends. You can talk to me.”
“There are plenty of people who start who never make it professionally. No, you’ve been to a game, haven’t you?” John grinned. God it was a nice grin.
“Well damn, and here I was, thinking I was so subtle.” John grinned. “Can’t get anything by you.”
The morning rush had died down somewhat, but they were still heading into the center of London, and traffic was heavy. Even with the sirens, the 1.2 mile journey took an agonizing eleven minutes. Lestrade had only just parked, and hadn’t even had a chance to shut off the engine, when Sherlock jumped from the car, and sprinted into the square. Quickly joined by Lestrade, and Hopkins and Evans who arrived just behind them, Sherlock whipped his had around, searching for any sign of John. There were a fair few people in the square. People sitting around the fountain, people sprawled on the grass, and people just passing through. There were people taking coffee breaks, people eating an early lunch, people talking on the phone, and people enjoying a moment to shut their eyes. Sherlock rushed from one end of the square to the other, looking at all the people, and none of them where John.
It was ridiculous; Sherlock never had problems getting people to speak to him before. Suspects, witnesses, victim’s families, Sherlock could walk up, spin a story, and be invited in for tea within minutes. And that was the problem, he spun stories, he lied to get his way, and it worked, but Sherlock couldn’t lie to John. He wanted something real, and he couldn’t get that by deceiving him. Sherlock had to do it honestly, and honestly, he had nothing.
“But we seem to have made an utter mess of both ourselves and the mats.”
“Obviously.”
"Alright, alright, I’m sorry.” Sebastian cried, his whimpers muffled by the wall.
“Yes. After that I wanted to prove I knew what I was talking about. I began following crime reports, my parents even got me a police scanner.”
“I was attempting to, yes. It was an ill-conceived plan, there’s no need to laugh.”
“Well if you’re going to the football game, then maybe I’ll see you there. It’s at home this week.” Though Sherlock didn’t really seem the school spirit type, John thought, it might do him some good to get out and socialize a bit. Maybe he could even convince Sherlock to do something afterwards. John wasn’t sure why he wanted to spend more time with Sherlock, all he knew was he just… did.
Even though it never happened, even though he had been in John’s class, and they had become friends, just the thought of not having John in his life, the thought of never getting the chance to fall in love with him, made Sherlock feel cold. John’s friendship and love shaped so much of the man Sherlock had become, Sherlock didn’t even know who he’d be without John. He didn’t want to know.
They talked, they sat in silence, they argued when John insisted they stop for lunch and to ‘stretch their legs’. John even pestered Sherlock to tell him all the deductions he’d held back when meeting the rest of the team. Sherlock was pretty sure he’d never heard anything as wonderful as John dissolving into a fit of giggles when Sherlock told him that Vikram Hangal was also a member of a barbershop quartet named ‘The Chord of the Rings.' If he thought watching John play the day before was worth all the effort of getting there, it was nothing compared to the drive back. Sherlock would gladly endure thirty conversations with Mycroft, or be surrounded by his peers everyday for a year, to experience even ten minutes of the drive with John.
“It’s fine, John.” Sherlock shrugged. “And statistically speaking, it was a fairly safe assumption to make.”
“You’ll be the first to know.”
Right… Right there, John… yeah… oh… yeah… there… oh –
“Yeah,” John nodded. “Yeah, I think I do.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m just glad it’s over.”  John didn’t dare risk looking at Sherlock for fear of seeing his kiss swollen lips, his clothes in a state of disarray, and his hair a total disaster. What made it all worse was he knew he looked very much the same.
“Liam,” Sherlock said, taking the proffered drink.
“I did, and I’m proud of it!” John grinned, nuzzling Sherlock’s neck. “Now correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe I remember you saying something earlier about us having sex. Is that offer still on the table?”
“Mmmm?” His eyelids were heavy. He didn’t need his eyes open to hear, he could just close his eyes.
John couldn’t help but laugh. For the first time in nearly a week, John was genuinely enjoying himself. It felt good.
“It’s this damn weekend, this stupid party!” he snapped. “I don’t need to hear all the details over and over again! Once was enough, I get it!”
John couldn’t say for certain how he did it, perhaps he had maintained some of his strength from the army, but he managed to shift the beam off of Sherlock’s leg, freeing him from the rubble. Taking as much care with his clearly broken left leg as possible, John lifted Sherlock into a fireman’s carry, and made his way out of the house.
.” Mycroft smirked, making sure to add extra emphasis to the last work, the prick.
If that weekend taught John and Sherlock anything, it was that when you’re in love, just about everything is perfect.
“Are you aware you say that out loud?” Sherlock frowned, as if confused by John’s praise.
Two years down the road
“Sherlock,” Sherlock replied, once again looking at John’s chin instead of his eyes. “Only my Nanna calls me William anymore, everyone else calls me Sherlock.”
“Tomorrow morning? I see no problem with tomorrow morning.” So he was only looking for a distraction for the night, excellent. “The name’s Jack, by the way.”
John frowned, stopping his fingers and propping himself up on one arm to look down at Sherlock. Quite a flattering angle in Sherlock’s opinion. “What, Jack? What’s wrong with Jack? It’s a nickname for John.”
“Of course you always wear a suit.” John muttered to himself. Sherlock really was almost too posh for words.
“I haven’t even been awake for five minutes. I would have thought of something, you just beat me to it.”
“I thought I was Groom One.” Sherlock whispered to John.
“And what do people usually say?”
“Yes this is John.”
Not understanding why she was so happy about getting him tea, John just shook his head, resettled his grip on Sherlock’s hand, and went back to trying to read his book. He had managed to make it through another two pages when Leah returned a half hour later.
“I see.” Sherlock nodded.
John let his head drop, stopping mere millimeters from Sherlock’s lips. “You don’t say? Well, I’m more than happy to put in the time, no matter how long it takes,” he murmured, “if you want me to, that is.”
I may or may not have let my love of 'Endeavour' 'Lewis' and 'Foyle's War' slip in this chapter, along with a couple of canon ACD characters (at least canon names). And yes, John set Sherlock's custom ring tone to the Magnum P.I. theme song. Also, I'd be remissed if I didn't work in John being left handed, and the plight we face everyday when writing something down (it's a struggle, but we carry on).
No. No, he needed to be with Sherlock, and before he had time to think, John blurted the first thing to come to him. “I’m his domestic partner. We’re getting married. I’m… I’m his fiancé.” He didn’t look at Lestrade, who thankfully didn’t say anything.
“Your Thursday night girl.”
Sherlock held the bracelet in his hand for a moment, his fingers brushing over each of the charms, remembering the day after Mrs. Watson’s funeral when he sat beside John listening as John told him the story behind each and every one. It wasn’t until he was putting the bracelet away, that Sherlock spotted a piece of paper at the bottom of the box. It was a two year old news clipping from the first time he and John made it into the paper.  He stared down at the picture of himself at fifteen, a sixteen year old John, split lip and beaming at the camera, with an arm around Sherlock’s neck. Barely managing to swallow the sudden lump in his throat, Sherlock let his fingers pause over John’s smiling face, before he returned the clipping to its hiding place, and left the room. He had work to do.
Again, apologies for the delay. Here's that dash of smut I've been promising since the beginning as we look a bit ahead into the lives of John and Sherlock. Enjoy!
“Good.” Sherlock sighed against John’s lips. “Now be quiet. The song’s almost done, and I want to enjoy this moment.”
Well duh, they're falling in love. But now it appears they've come to terms with what they're feeling, don't you think it's about time they open their eyes and figure out how the other feels? I know I do. I guess you better stay tuned for what comes next!! :D
to stay, I need you to see
I'm not happy about what I just did, but it had to be done. But don't worry, I live for HEAs.
“And now that I know what it’s really like, and not just what I’ve imagined,” Sherlock continued, and shifted to sit up. “I know I’ll never be able to sleep knowing that you are just one floor above me.”
Super short, slightly smutty epilogue follows. If that's not your bag, you can just end it here, no harm done.
John wasn’t sure how long they stood there staring at each other; the only sound was that of their breathing. “John,” Sherlock said quietly, as if afraid to break the spell that had fallen over them, “is there any chance we can start over, delete this whole fiasco, because I…”
John soon found himself giving up the fight to maintain some semblance of composure, and was laughing along with Sherlock, the deep, rich rumble of his friend’s chuckles impossible to resist. Almost everything about his friend was impossible to resist.
One way or another, John was going to make this right.
“Hmmm, maybe.” Sherlock hummed. “You know, I’ve been meaning to ask, I understand your interest in medicine, but it’s so time consuming. Why didn’t you pick an easier fall back field like most of the other members of your team?”
“And your crutches, you’re not leaving this flat without your crutches.” John called after him, fighting to keep the amusement out of his voice. Honestly, Sherlock was like a giant toddler excited for playtime, never mind the fact that this playtime most likely involved a dead body.
And so, for a little over an hour, John talked Sherlock through some of the more basic blocking techniques as Sherlock tried to throw punch after punch. As with apparently everything Sherlock did, he picked it all up quickly, and by the end of their session when it was his turn, Sherlock was successfully blocking one after another of John’s ‘attacks.’ Sure John was holding back a bit, but Sherlock had made some serious progress.
Apparently he was that transparent. “And if there were?” Sherlock asked, not looking at Lestrade.
“Fantastic! Did you just solve a murder by looking at the victim for 2 minutes?”
“I’ve been meaning to ask you something.”
Sherlock Holmes
I know it's childish, but I giggled when I wrote the "what crawled up your butt" part. I still giggle when I read over it.
“I’m pretty sure he feels he doesn’t deserve you.”
“Yeah, that’s never going to happen.” Sherlock snorted. “You’re rather stuck with me now, and I have the ring to prove it.”
On his life, John could not say how exactly they made it to bedroom in one piece, but before he knew it, John found himself stripped naked completely entangled with an equally naked Sherlock, rutting, and panting into his hot, perfect mouth.
“I know, I know, you don’t need a minder. People crash on their friend’s couches all the time when they need a place to stay. It’s either my place or your parents’, and your parents place is one hell of a commute. Don’t think you’re anything special.” John muttered. “Now, just wait by the door. If you can’t get your coat on, at least drape it over your shoulders.”
, and whatever the something was, it felt significant. He had opened up about the war, about feeling damaged, and Sherlock told him about his struggle with addiction; that had to mean something. He needed more time, he had to know if Sherlock felt it too. He just had to figure out a way to see Sherlock again after tonight. He may have been ‘Three Continents Watson’, but John was absolute shit at transitioning into something real. It’s amazing what being cheated on and getting shot, will do to a man’s confidence.
“Well who am I to argue with that?” John grinned. “Home it is!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“So what do you think?” Sherlock asks when John finally joins him.
Oh, John was looking at him, he had asked him something. Sherlock hadn’t even noticed John was still talking, too lost in his own pathetic hurt and self-pitying. “I’m sorry, what?”
“Not needed, but… thank you. I appreciate it.” Sherlock did appreciate her. Sure they were friends – after everything, Sherlock had grudgingly accepted he did have friends – but she didn’t need to stick her neck out for him like she was.
both he and John were getting by the kisses. And feeling giddy, high on his want, need, and love for John, high on John’s want, need and love for him, Sherlock pushed himself harder into John’s embrace. “Now for the love of god, please take me to bed, Dr. Watson.”
“Alright smarty-pants, I get it, not everyone is a genius like you.”
“You really think so?” A small crease formed between Sherlock’s brows. So the man wasn’t made of porcelain after all! “You’re easily impressed.”
“Her husband’s sister clearly resented the fact that the victim was making her move out of what used to be her and her brother’s flat. She put the cyanide in the victim’s coffee, and tried to mask the taste with almond milk. I suspect it’s been going on for a while, based off the banding on the victims nails. Probably the sister-in-law got tired of waiting, and gave her a larger dose today. Test the coffee to confirm, and question the sister-in-law.” Sherlock says in a flourish
The room soon filled with the sounds of their love making. Sweat-slicked skin met sweat-slicked skin as their bodies moved and rocked as one. John’s hand wrapped around Sherlock, pumping him as he thrust harder and harder into his body. Their breaths grew short, and their moans grew deeper, until finally, with John buried deep inside him, Sherlock’s climax took him. John’s own cries and the sudden feel of John’s release flooding him moments later, barely registered as Sherlock rode John through the aftershocks coursing through his quaking body until eventually collapsing in a state of utter undone bliss.
“John was the TA for one of my classes last term, and this term. We got to know each other over the course of… um… lessons.” Sherlock said, his cheeks flaring pink. Adorable.
What was more difficult to ignore was the conversation Molly decided to strike up, now that the silence had been broken.
“I still don’t understand what we’re still doing here.” Sherlock whined, throwing back his head. While being with John was better than being alone by a mile, better than anything, that didn’t mean he didn’t still get bored. “Lestrade has some cold cases for us, but he’s refusing to deliver them. Let’s go pick them up.”
“John…” Sherlock's breath hitched, he had meant to tell him that he was the one for him too, but what came out instead was “I'm in love with you.”
John didn’t fare much better.
Finally, John was going to get some answers. “What happened, Greg? All they told me on the phone was there was a suspected stabbing. I need to see him, Greg. I need to be with him. Where is he?”
“An enemy. In his mind, certainly. If you were to ask him, he’d probably say I’m is arch-enemy. He does so love to be dramatic.”
“You’re the one how gave me your measurements, it’s not my fault if they were wrong and the trunks don’t fit.”
, as I know how much you detest it. No matter how dull or pointless, I’ll do it. Just… please.”
"Hmmm… head.” Sherlock giggled.
“I didn’t know, I noticed. You can figure out almost everything you need to know about a person just by looking at them, sadly so few people bother to actually look.” Sherlock mused.
“Not for everything I have in mind. Come on, up you get.” John said, practically hoisting Sherlock off of him and onto his feet. “There’s a restaurant attached to the inn. I had a look at the menu, and the food looks good.”
John leaned forward to brush his lips against Sherlock’s, feeling them both shiver at the touch. “Yeah.” He smiled.
“One time only, remember.”
“God yes. Mine.”
Sherlock was just getting ready to get into the shower when his phone pinged with a text alert.
Both miserable, John and Sherlock fail at trying to forget what happened, and fail even worse at hiding their misery.
“Well it sounds to me like we need to get more people looking.” Molly offered once Sherlock had finished.
“No, not just anyone.” Sherlock smiled.
*******
“Seriously?” Becca laughed. “Why did you stop to talk to them? We should have grabbed your computer and gotten out of there!”
“Well he’s not
“I do, don’t I?” John laughed, shrugging his shoulders in that unconscious, almost self-deprecating way of his. “But hey, I’m just telling you what they told me when I had to go through all of this.”
“Assault and battery.” Sherlock scoffed. “It’s not a big deal. You had me checked out, I’m going to be fine. Besides, it’s not like I’m some innocent. You know I’m not one to mince words, you know I’m an arse.”
John didn’t wait for the end of the sentence to wrap his arms around Sherlock’s waist and back, and kissed him with such enthusiasm that he lifted Sherlock off his feet. Their chests held flush against each other’s, John could feel Sherlock’s heart beating in perfect sync with his. Even the sound of friends and family clapping around them, couldn’t distract John from the feeling of Sherlock’s lips parting and moving against and with his. Yep, he could definitely get used to kissing a married man.
“I’m fine.”
Sherlock gave up the fight after that, proof of just how much he needed sleep, and John was able to somewhat easily guide him through the kitchen and back towards his bedroom. They had just about reached his bedroom door when Sherlock stopped abruptly and turned in John’s arm, his back to the door.
Jacket and gloves on, John made his way down stairs, catching sight of two other doors on the first floor he had failed to notice the night before, and opened the door… to a snowdrift that came up passed his knees. And to make matters worse, the snow was still coming down.
Scanning the room again, Sherlock formulated a plan, he just needed one more element for it to work. There, nervously standing by the display boards, empty tray under his arm, looking a bit lost in his ill fitted suit, was a blond man, roughly two or three years older than Sherlock. He would do perfectly.
“I am. It’s not every day you turn nineteen, your birthday is an event worth celebrating!”
John was just getting up to leave, trying to salvage what little dignity he had left, when a young man approached him.
“I can’t get anything by you. Let’s go, I’m starving!”
“Text from Lestrade. He’s got a burglary that he’s willing to let me in on.”
“And John, the man I’m meeting, he’s my partner full stop. Personally, professionally, all of it.” Sherlock knew he sounded ridiculous, bragging about having a boyfriend like he was a teenager, but Christ did it feel good. It felt good to finally show Theo that he wasn’t a freak, that he may be slightly different than most, but it didn’t matter, he wasn’t broken, he could still find someone who –
“Han and Leia, huh? I don’t know if I’d go that far… though he did sometimes put on airs that could rival those of royalty.”
It was the early morning hours of Sunday – several hours earlier, John had sent Harry a text letting her know he’d be staying at the hospital indefinitely – when Dr. Cook stopped in again to inform John that a more private room had been arranged for Sherlock
“Then let’s go get married.”
“Mmm, it’s like listening to one of Shakespeare’s sonnets.” Mike joked from over by the fireplace. “Nothing like sound, logical arguments to get the heart beating faster.”
John’s hand on Sherlock’s shoulder tensed, and his smile fell as he turned to face Theo once again. “I’m sorry,” he scowled, his voice dangerously low, “but did you actually just go from insulting my boyfriend, quite viciously I might add, to implying that I am some sort of prostitute?” John was absolutely seething at this point, Sherlock had never seen him this angry. He really should step in, stop John and get them both out of there, but a small part of him – maybe a not so small part – wanted to see what would happen, to see what John would do to Theo.
“No worries.” John’s smile was a little too tight.
an intelligent idiot,” Sherlock said, and this time there was no teasing smirk, but a soft and genuine smile.
“Ok fine,” John huffed, “do you want to know the truth, the real reason I offered to help you?”
“Easy? Easy’s good.”
"Second,” John said, ignoring Sherlock’s interruption, “there are people who live with more severe disabilities, permanent disabilities, and they live perfectly normal, perfectly functional lives. Just relax.”
Figuring John would just come meet him after the appointment, Sherlock was justifiably surprised when he not only went along when Sherlock left for his appointment, but that he actually sat out in the lobby of the clinic and waited the whole hour and a half for the session to be done. He claimed he was just doing his duty by preventing any Mycroft prompted detours, and that the wait gave him a chance to start reading his new book. Ridiculous excuses, both of them. First, despite what he said the night before, Sherlock knew that nothing could prevent Mycroft from doing what he wanted to do, and he knew John knew that as well. And second, John had ample opportunity to read his book; it was the second in a series, the first of which he had read over the past two weeks, as they sat around the flat. He didn’t need to sit in a tacky old chair in the lobby of a rehab center, in order to read. No, John was there simply because Sherlock had asked him, and he wanted to be there. Nobody, besides maybe his parents, had ever been willing to do that for him, to be there for him, and Sherlock would have been lying if he said it didn’t make his chest feel just a bit warmer, and his stomach just a bit lighter.
After two – disappointingly – quick demonstrations, John and Sherlock swapped places, and that proved even worse. Short as he was, John still managed to get an arm around Sherlock’s neck, but because of their height different, Sherlock was pressed back against John in a way that he could feel every single contour of John’s chest and abdomen. Distracting, so distracting. And he couldn’t seem to master the quick drop, instead Sherlock ended up sliding – far too slowly – down John’s front. Counterproductive. Not good. Very, very, not good.
“Thursday, yeah.” Sherlock hummed to himself, taking a sip of his now cold cup of tea.
“… and you’ll only ever find that kind of wear pattern on the door of a good restaurant.” Sherlock finished saying just as their waitress set down their drinks, conveniently allowing her hand to brush along Sherlock’s. She had been flirting with him since the moment they walked in the door, and being very obvious about it.
*******
“I’ll take you back to see him now, he’s been asking for you,” Dr. Drier continued, unaware of the self-berating going on in John’s head. “But just so you know, we’ve already given him something for the pain, so he may be a little bit loopy.”
, and I was simply eliminated the possibility that he ran away by clearing anywhere he’d hide out.”
“I suppose.” Sherlock sighed. “Though I am quite uncomfortable at the moment.”
“Ass.”John says, nudging Sherlock’s shoulder. “Did you say you solve crime in your spare time?”
“So what do you want to do? We can be cops and robbers, or army men, or maybe treasure hunters!” John said, already running towards the playground.
“Yeah, yeah you’re right. Let’s hope he’s not that type.” Sarah chuckled. “But come on John, you have to do something. I really don’t to have inadvertently ended what could be the greatest love story since Han and Leia, before it even had a chance to start!” She was pouting; John hated it when she pouted, he hated that she almost always got her way when she pouted.
“Oh, we’re going to talk, Sherlock, trust me.”
“But it wouldn't affect everyone that way, although I assume that they’d all try to comp--”
“I think I’ve already done that. What I said there at the morgue, it was cruel. We were both… equally bad, but for different reasons. And I get mad, furious, even, but I don’t hold a grudge, Sherlock. Just… let’s not do it again.”
“As you are aware.”
“What on Earth makes you think that I-- God, Sherlock, I--”
He does, however, undeniably possess one of the protective factors the textbook mentioned: problem-solving ability. Sherlock is nothing if not both capable and determined to solve each and every problem he finds interesting enough.
John’s voice is neutral, not giving anything away -
Hypothetically.
Sherlock’s hands are still trapped as John manages to turn him around and back him onto the bed, before finally allowing him to untangle from the shirt.
And now John wants to lick into Sherlock's mouth after having instructed his lover each step of the way, directing him through his very first time performing cunilingus. He imagines her; sated, slumped back in the chair, idly watching John taste her on Sherlock's lips, giving him something - rewarding him - for being such a quick study, for being willing to work so hard simply to--
“John said that the nurse who’d called him on his adrenaline addiction looked like she was fourteen, which is clearly inaccurate. I’d say your appearance indicates that you’re at least 18 years old, even if your social interactions would indicate a younger age. However, none of those estimations are of any importance, since it’s easy to settle your real age to twenty-five.”
He can't see Sherlock's face and Sherlock can't see his, but he can feel Sherlock's pulse through the fingers that are woven together behind Sherlock's neck and in them he can also feel every swallow, every breath held.
Self-medication in this chapter:
“I doubt that the DSM would acknowledge “sentiment” as the root of our pathologies,” Sherlock retorts, because Mycroft should never be allowed to forget his own part in this.
(John is a distraction, but his absence is an even greater distraction, and Sherlock might loathe it, but it doesn’t change the fact that--)
“Hey,” John says again. “Let’s get out of here.”
When John does none of those things, fingers start to work on John's belt, then his button and zip.
He could use the puzzle.
John is dreaming about the war -
As he attempts to mimic John’s movements from just a minute ago, their tongues collide and heads are bent the wrong way, but then they manage it, and it’s Sherlock’s turn to taste and probe, and it’s curious, the sensation of entering someone else. It’s less overwhelming than the other way around, but not by much.
Ruling out the most unlikely disorders turns out to be the easiest part. Delirium, dementia, substance-related disorders, psychotic disorders, somatoform disorders and sexual and gender identity disorders are immediately discarded, as well as some other broader categories that hardly seems to apply to him.
Taking one last look at the way her breasts are vaguely outlined under her oversized blouse, John tries to save away that mental image. It'll help when he imagines how the small breasts will fall slightly to the sides as she arches her back in the chair as full lips move over her labia and a sharp tongue licks explorative into her cunt, eager to learn the anatomy of her body. Yes. He'd be eager to learn, because John would be there, would guide him through it, sitting in the chair opposite, watching, instructing--
, he had already lost it.
“Sit closer to the fire,” Sherlock says over his shoulder, leaving the room to change into his pyjamas - the cold seems to have settled into the fabric of his suit, and he needs to feel warm again.
“Since you have such vast personal experience in the matter, I will certainly take your advice under consideration, brother.”
From the corner of his eye, John glances at Sherlock, who is radiating frustration in a low-key way that means that he's trying not to sulk. He will do that occasionally these days; attempts to regulate at least some parts of his mood.
, but either way he agrees that they should, but he won’t, he just won’t let that be John’s decision to make.
“I figured I’d let you set the pace for this,” he finally says.
And the lovely beta was done - per usual - by the amazing iriswallpaper.
Sherlock knows that it can’t be -
* * * * *
There’s a pattern to follow, and he can finally be sure that the pattern in question doesn’t just exist inside his own head. And so that night, Sherlock sleeps, because it gets worse if he doesn't, and that’s yet another thing he can’t afford that now.
Sherlock's hand is still on the empty seat between them.
He swivels around to start pacing in the opposite direction, watching John from the corner of his eye.
The cab ride back to Baker Street is turbulent.
John can do this. He can have sex with a man without feeling like he’s just barely managing to keep his doubts and discomforts at bay. He can do this with Sherlock without having to fake confidence or swallow his discomfort about the fact that there’s one cock too much in the bed. Because if it feels like this then it’s not a compromise or a task; it’s a very unexpected upside to having fallen in love with a man who’s more than willing to let him do this.
, pathological responses. But then the ground hadn't begun to shake and there had been no signs of bombs detonating. Instead - only this thought;
“Because you believe in things the way Sophia did. Like I did.”
. John
Still, as he’s slowly regaining his breath and his thoughts starts to aline a bit more coherently, John finds that he somehow hadn’t expected this particular paradoxical reaction of Sherlock’s to continue.
50 seconds later, Sherlock is on his hands and knees in the wet grass outside the window and John is assessing the best way to escape unnoticed, deciding on the same way they came here; through the bushes and trees by the fence a bit further away from the main building. Sherlock gets to his feet and they hurry to the shield offered by the greenery, hunched over and out of breath.
Perhaps it’s really self-destructiveness, Sherlock gathers. He’s no stranger to the concept and he’s no stranger to the behavior. He isn’t even sentimental enough to deny it. And if cocaine isn’t an option, and he has to live in this limbo some more, perhaps even finding himself wanting it to last, then maybe (a few pills and) a clean conscious (over how he treats John) would go a long way. The only problem would be if he fails in not harming John. This seems likely but other than hurting him in an attempt to avoid to get the chance to hurt him more, Sherlock finds that he hasn’t had any impulses to be Not Good (other than the imposing on John’s sexuality, but John denies that one, so that’s debatable).
- Sherlock’s mind slowly recognised what had been in the back of his -
Sherlock can see John doesn’t believe that. John knows Sherlock's moods -
And perhaps it won’t even be boring.
Sherlock doesn’t answer, which in this case is an answer.
. The difference is that John’s terrors were once real, while Sherlock’s only ever existed inside of his own mind.
“He tried to leave you some stuff, though,” John continues, voice still light and sweat still drying in his short hair. If Sherlock were closer, he could probably smell it; likely the same odour as John gave off when they were pressed close together in a small space after having outrun whoever was after them that particular week. Sweat, adrenaline, cortisol, pheromones, disinfectant, fabric softener and London streets.
“Your concern over side-effects on cognitive function is understandable, brother. I do hope you’ve taken the possible damage from previous cocaine use into account regarding how your brain will function without the clomipramine. It is possible that your serotonin levels are even lower after your little youthful experiments. Be careful, Sherlock. You might be risking more than you can gain here.”
Clearly, having something left that was just his would be something of an advantage.
Brilliantlyburning wondered about John's motivations, and this happened.
He has to keep himself from twirling around on the spot - a compulsion that's best kept inside the walls of his own flat.
John only raises his eyebrows, seemingly deciding that he'll leave that line of questioning for another time, and not allow himself to get side-tracked.
Sherlock can feel the tension decrease as John’s body gradually relaxes before his muscles finally reach the full paralysis that occurs during REM sleep. Sherlock knows there’s no chance he himself is going to be able to drift off - his mind granted him a total of three minutes of relative lethargy but now the near-constant restless worry is back His forearms are tingling, and the counteracting sensation of his fingernails against the pad of his thumb is not enough to override that particular neuronal noise. His attention flickers between sensations - folds in the sheets, the pull on his skin where it’s pressed against  John’s and the impossible task of finding a comfortable position for his left arm - and the images in his mind’s eye.
Only breaths that are close enough to mingle and the not-quite silence of the kitchen. It’s possible to tell the truth, but it seems impossible to estimate the consequences of doing so.
(Unexpected.)
“What does that have to do with anything?”
Against Sherlock's scalp, blunt fingertips creates  patterns of waves, fingers sliding through the curls, occasionally getting stuck where product has made the hair strands stick together.
“Didn't think so,” John mutters to himself, pocketing his phone and looking at Sherlock for a few seconds before he gets up from the table.
“And if I wanted to go further than you imagined?”
It hadn't been one of those cases that ended with a narrow escape from death. No, it had ended with a few insults from the arrested accountant followed by an hour of paperwork, so John finds that he can't blame any residual adrenaline for the action he’s currently considering.
“Most people are,” Sherlock retorts, aiming for fond but missing the note slightly due to the hesitation in his voice.
About consent in this chapter; as mentioned in the chapter notes, I've been pointed to the fact that some readers found this scene disturbing. Not only due to the lack of explicit consent - a reoccurring issue in my stories, I realised once I was made aware of it - but mainly because of Sherlock's reactions to it.
Because ‘urges’ in “just right” OCD and tics feel similar, it can also be difficult to tell them apart. While “just right” obsessions are less evident than in other OCD subtypes, the urges tend to be more thought-based than tics. In other words, an individual with “just right” symptoms may say that something does not ‘feel right’ – and that he/she performs certain rituals to try and get rid of that feeling, whereas a person with tics would tend to show less voluntary control over his/her actions.”
He isn’t the only one in doubt.
“So. Should I head out of the flat before you tear it to pieces because you can't stand the waiting?”
“Your doctor is not objective when it comes to you.”
Gradually, Sherlock’s body relaxes into the sensation. It’s no longer light enough to put him on edge the way light touches have an tendency to do, but firmer and more palpable. The more he thinks about it, the more intrigued he is by the fact that this is what John chose.
(It's hardly going to make anything Right anyway.)
His last experiment was inconclusive in determining whether physical or emotional proximity were more effective in terms of pair bonding. Now, at almost five in the morning, once more in their hallway, Sherlock thinks that he might be closer to a reliable hypothesis.
“Yeah, my cousin was involved in a lot of stuff like that. Evangelical churches,” John comments.
A hand is reached out, finding its way into the hair on the right side of Sherlock's head, fingers nestling into curls as Sherlock allows his head to be angled by the not-quite tug on his hair. John's other hand touches Sherlock's neck, stroking up until it rests on Sherlock's cheek. The vibrations and the pressure are dissolving into a tingling sensation on Sherlock's palms, and he's not sure what to do with his hands, so he finds himself slowly rubbing them against the sides of his legs, the friction almost enough to distract him from the tingles.
“Um, yeah, I did,” John says, a sliver of uncertainty lurking under his careless, absent-minded tone.
As Sherlock leaves the bathroom, heading back to his room after having spent an unacceptable amount of time giving in to various compulsions without any achieving any palpable release, he knows that this is just further proof of what he now knows.
When John doesn't interject, Sherlock continues, now simply wanting this to be over with so he can retreat, lock himself in somewhere and just--
"Yeah?" John asks.
striking blindly, falling short
Sherlock himself never returns the attention. It's no use grasping for what you most likely don't want and which you will never have anyway, after all.
In the space and silence between the two of them, John's hand slowly starts shift, settling on the cheap, fake leather of the seat.
Sherlock suddenly wishes that they had stayed on the topic of his not-quite-delusions.
“Oh, right,” John says, but doesn't move, just clears his throat, his hand falling from Sherlock's nape to rest on his shoulder for a few seconds.
It's just that ever since he last got sober, the only thing potent enough to even be considered a feasible substitute has any kind of risk taking behaviour.
“I’m not happy that you’ve been going through…
“Didn’t
“To you, yeah.”
John thinks that Sherlock is often to wrapped up in his own thoughts to take any notice of his surroundings, but there's a difference between not noticing and simply ignoring.
It's shocking, John thinks, but not as shocking as it ought to be.
- and John is picking up his phone from the counter, leaving the kitchen without even putting his mug away.
Mycroft might be smarter, but he's also more predictable than Sherlock’s ever been. Sherlock can predict his movements as Mycroft slowly walks over to the old chair by the wall and nudges it until it faces the bed. Mycroft stands by the chair for a few seconds before seating himself, adjusting his waistcoat -
John takes a steadying breath, holds onto the wall by the stairs for a moment before he takes the last few steps.
“Sorry, I--” John starts, but Sherlock’s nerves are already too reactive, already in overdrive, and it’s all he can do not to kick John off of him, because this is too much is--
“Come here.”
It’s a struggle, right there and then, not to curl in on himself, but Sherlock manages, because that’s what this is about.
(Four pills would be enough to potentially cause a certain ‘ga-ga effect’, as John so eloquently put it. Sherlock downed five tablets before even getting out of the taxi at Heathrow. Given his current levels of anxiety and sensory issues, even John had preferred to see him medicated for managing an airport and sitting on a plane with 400 people.)
is what John homes in on.
For a moment, the thought of what he might have completely fucked up by initiating what he’s now about to end hits Sherlock with full force, making him feel like he’s choking.
Silence. Thin ice. Not looking at John’s face, but at his now loosening fist on the counter, Sherlock still sees the return of a very faint orange in the midst of the sand-colored confrontation -
The problem is that with John it might actually be worth it. Sherlock has no scale to measure the worth of what John is against what it costs, because he’s only ever measured the cost of such things, never the possible gain. This, in turn, creates yet another unanswered question, making the whole thing even more agonising.
- and only hesitates for half a second before he swallows them down.
And now, he’s thirty-two years old, the world hasn’t ended yet and there is no logical reason to assume that the airliner in front of him is a sign of anything other than the development of modern engineering. He’s more grounded - both in reality and in himself - than he’s ever been, despite just being about to take off for a nine-hour journey over the Atlantic with his …

“Yes.”
“I did no such thing. I didn't ‘run’--”
. Sherlock tries to mentally distance himself from the thoughts of John’s coloration; they are distracting and Sherlock doesn’t need more impairments in his executive functions than those he just has discovered.
That deduction makes the next step easier.
“I didn’t mean to… That’s none of my business,” John says slowly, pointedly not looking away, but looking increasingly uncomfortable.
In this author's note, I'd like to address some more specific aspects:
Even with his eyes shut Sherlock can feel John’s gaze, radiating lime green and khaki with only the slightest touch of aubergine.
Different parameters, but the experiment might be worth conducting anyway.
The light touch tickles his skin and it feels like mockery and it registers as a jolt, travelling through Sherlock’s entire body, the light touch making his entire nervous system flare up and so Sherlock flinches, tossing his head away from the offensive touch.
Anger blocks out everything else in Sherlock’s head for a moment, and he opens his mouth to retort, but Mycroft isn’t finished just yet. His voice shifts -
This isn't like kissing, because when John lets his own hands drift down from Sherlock's neck, down his shoulder blades, Sherlock pauses his slow exploring, letting out his breath, and John stills, understanding.
Whatever Sherlock has - whatever Sherlock is - it is
It's late, and going home -
What she tells him is mostly confirmation of what he’s already pieced together, and there’s a sudden thrill because he was right - he saw it - he connected the pieces and observed the pattern and drew the right conclusions and--
Item on the checklist illustrated;
Not listening to any of the protests, Sherlock nods to John, who is actually trying to hide a smile, and they leave Scotland Yard together; John with an apologetic smile to Lestrade and Sherlock with a dizziness that resembles the symptoms of a fever. In the cab, John turns to look at him.
. Case.
... but it doesn't. It doesn't quite follow pattern. Because the panic declines all by itself, without him leaving the flat, turning to chemical aids or having a panic attack. It doesn't turn destructive, and it's something he finds himself surprised by, in light of previous similar situations.
As John returns into the sitting room, frowning as he glances at the stack of journals he'd planned to start working his way through but now feel too disgruntled about his medical career to even consider, Sherlock decides that it's time to tip that scale.
“So how does this work, are you his boss or are you partners?” Matthew asks, and John feels how all the blood vessels in his face dilates, probably leaving him with a very prominent blush at the word ‘partners’. Is Matthew implying…
The plan in itself is simple enough; create another situation with physical proximity to ensure that the observations of last time remain valid.

John’s right thumb is stroking Sherlock’s bottom lip, his left hand still fisted in dark curls.
“Sherlock, would you mind contacting Lestrade? I have somebody here I would like him to meet."
? Are they the ones you bought on the street? Or is it ‘physical therapy’ with Dr Watson?”
“Amazing.”
It's Sherlock who lets his hand stroke down John's back before breaking the contact - releasing,
In the haze and the dark, Sherlock tries to get his arms to cooperate, to get to his throat, to free his airways of whatever it is that is stopping him from inhaling, that obstructs the passage and--
Queer.
Sherlock’s eyes are focused on the kettle - John's presence is palpable enough even without the direct visual confrontation as his colors constantly leak into Sherlock's field of vision.
The question is not worth a reply, so none is given. There had been no fingerprints other than those of the owners of the books in the first two break ins, so the chance is beyond slim that there will be any now.
This time John doesn’t say anything, just stands back as Sherlock’s knuckles turn white from his desperate hold on the toilet seat and his neck gradually gets damper and damper underneath his scarf and curls. The feeling of moisture spreading all over his back, diffusing into the wool of his coat, is so unsavory that Sherlock considers letting go of the toilet between the retches, to free himself of the suffocating fabric that’s weighing him down. He doesn’t, however, manage to do so. As he finally feels the nausea calm down, he slumps against the bathroom wall, lacking both the coordination and the energy needed to unbutton and shed his coat. John is still standing in the doorway -
It took a few seconds to digest. Around him, the empty lab at Bart’s was suddenly too intrusive with all the fluorescent lights competing with the words on his retinas.
Right then and there, with his eyes on John’s hand as it slides the key into the lock, Sherlock wants nothing more than to close a door behind him, to shut himself in, shut himself off, because what’s the use of this anyway? He can’t win this, none of it. It was reaching too far to aspire to solve this case at his current state, and to even consider that he could ever make… a relationship work, even when he’s at his best… well; that’s just presumptuous.
and at the same time broken.)
Putting his phone aside, Sherlock decided that it must be the alcohol. John is probably drinking; he always turns off the autocorrect when he drinks, thinking that it’s the autocorrect's fault when his messages don’t turn out the way he intended. No capital letters; John's drunk. He'll be less sentimental when the alcohol leaves his blood.
Sherlock sends another text, leaning against the door and allowing the warmth on his cheeks to be cooled down by the brisk wind outside.
It had been about not losing control. It had been about finding a way to shut everything off and to shut himself off from things. At least for a minute or two. It had been about self-regulation, even if that’s something Sherlock loathes to admit.
A pressure that can be shared.
Two cars passes them. Two set of headlights. Two moments spotlighting the two of them there on the pavement, almost side by side.
Leaning against the counter, John waits. On his chair by the table, Sherlock seems to also be waiting, watching John as if expecting some kind of clue.
A finger coated in viscous liquid probes his anus, the muscle fluttering at the touch, and the thought of the words muttered-whispered-gasped into his ear, into his skin, makes the reaction even stronger.
It would be so easy to just accept this, take Sherlock's words at face value and never return to this topic again.
“And what if the kid doesn’t want to see him?”
John had allowed been allowed to see that, but what had come from it had been the very definition of anticlimax. They haven’t spoken about it, there haven’t been any tells in the way they move when in close proximity of each other, and there hasn’t been a single hint about John wanting to do it again, despite clearly having enjoyed it far more than anything they’ve done previously. Instead of another rough shagging (with John calling him increasingly depraved things while letting his hand find Sherlock’s thro--
John gives his hair an extra tug and then the hand on his chest  to rest on the fabric just below the open vee of his shirt.
“Another time, perhaps” John says after a few seconds. “We should sleep.”
Well, he will have to act on his impulses on a day when his colleague hasn’t been outed as a bulimic with a superiority complex and his very own self-proclaimed sociopath of a lover hasn’t been called on being insecure and in love with him. And, most of all, he can not leave this as he’s just been confronted, more or less, with the devastating realisation that this is the first time someone has seen that there's something - anything - between him and Sherlock, disregarding all the previous times where people had pointed it out. It hadn’t bothered him at that point, because it hadn’t been true then. Now it is, and the prospect of people even suspecting as much is enough to make John feel his stomach clench.
Using those words himself made them no less hateful. It did, however, spare him from the pity of someone else thinking them but stopping themselves from saying them out loud.
Sherlock eyes the toy, considering having John try to solve the cube, just for the hell of it.
It’s far too much, and maybe it’s even enough.
“Still. She left everything she knew behind.”
[   ]  F = Fantasy
John's voice is matter-of-fact and he's putting the dishes away, but Sherlock knows John. Knows that John dislikes conversations about things that may or may not be personal or sensitive, knows that John dislikes the fact that he likes to think about hurting Sherlock.
“No.”
Of course. She might not be as bright as he is, but Helena never did fail to take his intellect and memory into account when dealing with him. She knows that he will have remember everything she’d taught him, and what had he really wanted to--
When John returns to the living room an hour later, Sherlock’s managed to get himself under a modicum of control, and John seems to be just as set on avoiding further confrontation as he is, so Sherlock gets up from his chair to collect his coat.
The boy answers the questions the way that someone who has had to repeat the same story over and over again often finds themselves doing. Still, Sherlock finds that there’s something about the answers that is too well thought through. It’s too neutral and objective to come from a 14-year old boy with ill-fitting street clothes and badly spiked hair, and pushing his questions even further, Sherlock manages to get the answer - or lack of answer - that proves that he’s on the right track.
“How do you know that I consented?”
Sherlock is aware that this probably came out sounding more testy than intended, but the state of the flat is still somewhat of a sore subject for him. It’s only been a week since John came to look at the flat and declared that the place would be very nice once all the rubbish had been cleaned up, and Sherlock is yet to make an effort to actually do something about it. There is, after all, nothing wrong with 221B. In fact, it’s the only place that Sherlock’s ever lived that has even the potential to be anything more than ‘tolerable’.
In this chapter, however, her behaviour is tuned up a bit due to not having taken her medication.
John has been gone for sixteen minutes, and Sherlock has not given him more than a sliver of thought. The distortion inside of him efficiently blocks out such trivial topics as what happened in the kitchen and how to interpret it.
and for once, the light isn’t overshadowed by loss
The physiological reaction that had not been especially prominent in John's body before is now growing between them. The first hint of it against Sherlock's thigh causes sparks of something like… confirmation. The arousal of a decision having been made.
“So… what’s with the clothes, then? A case?”
. Demolish.
John’s jacket wasn't on it's usual hook and his shoes weren't placed as neatly on the low shelf as they usually were. His earlier deduction on John’s blood-alcohol level was proven correct, Sherlock noted. The hallway was dim; the 3 am light from the city outside was not quite reaching the stairs to the flat. It’s too quiet and Sherlock could feel the noise of his own thoughts as the stairs cracked and creaked beneath him. He should have stayed longer at Bart’s, doing some additional tests or just poking about some tissue or organ that no one would miss. He isn’t tired enough to sleep at this point and being awake and inside the flat, surrounded by all traces of John, isn’t ideal. Even if he would be able to disregard the disturbingly ambiguous text he still wouldn’t be at ease. It does feels better this way; having finally broken the tension of waiting for the inevitable, but it doesn’t feel restful. Inside him, something’s hollow, and it's not the clear, freeing kind of hollow where the noise of his thoughts is silenced and he can focus. It’s the unusual kind of hollow that feels more like being empty and in need of being filled once again. Filled and sated with something that will make it possible to focus, to go on and not just being… empty. It’s like a surge, and the feeling of it brings up sense memories that should be kept at distance during his down times.

. Going through his thought patterns to neutralize every single horse and its rider Sherlock finds that it gets worse before it gets better.
More muffled sounds from John, and judging by the slight tapping of what must be the tip of an umbrella against the floor, Mycroft is getting restless.
With Sherlock, the afterglow isn’t what John is used to. No, with Sherlock, John’s slow, foggy brain is left trying to figure out if especially morbid crime scenes and the rare home cooked meals John is sometimes presented with are Sherlock’s version of courting, or if this is all there is; a frenetic and paradoxical release of physical needs followed by a rapid return to status quo. After one and a half month of sporadic but spectacular shags, in between which they don’t mention this, John is beginning to realise that this is the most likely conclusion.
The mere idea that some moderately intelligent professional could find an answer to a question that Sherlock Holmes himself has failed to answer is absurd.
Life's enough of a minefield as is.
(Lack of food? Withdrawal symptoms, still? The Oxazepam? Anxiety? Either way, it’s irrelevant in this now. Case.
Take two steps forward with eyes closed.
. Natural, unhurried, casual.
When he does it to himself, the intent is unambiguous. With John, nothing ever is.
Sherlock is an addict. One that is painfully aware of just what he's barely managing to escape through his addictions. He doesn't lack awareness, he just lacks any motivation to actually change his behaviour. There's nothing irrational about wanting to avoid what he's been skilfully keeping at bay for more than a decade now. In the end, one might even consider it an act of survival instinct or self-preservation - qualities others seem to think he lacks.
Mycroft looks at him for just a few seconds longer before beginning to turn towards the door, stopping half way through the motion.
Sherlock only offers a noncommittal grunt, and John's fingers don't withdraw.
(It does feel different, when it isn't his own hand doing that. Unpredictable.
“I do not…” John begins protesting, but is interrupted.
Leon Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance focuses on how humans strive for internal consistency. When inconsistency (dissonance) is experienced, individuals tend to become psychologically uncomfortable and they are motivated to attempt to reduce this dissonance, as well as actively avoiding situations and information which are likely to increase it.
"Case."
“It was Mycroft, wasn’t it? Who planted those… ‘doubts’.”
Sherlock manages to get his arms out to support him, balancing his weight on his elbows as John’s other hand finds his throat, fingers exploring the straining muscles as John leans in closer and Sherlock can feel the warmth of John’s breath against the skin just below his ear as John speaks, slowly and deliberately.
- and John’s studying Sherlock closely from where he stands against the wall in Lestrade’s office.
After one more minute Sherlock’s shivering slightly and John keeps stroking while he withdraws his cock just a bit and then pushes slowly back in. Sherlock tenses up again, but soon relaxes into John’s hand. He begins to move his hips in an attempt to thrust harder into John’s fist, resulting in friction against John’s own cock.

All around him, his fellow med students are dancing, talking and consuming far more ethanol than anyone who has studied a liver with cirrhosis should be able to stomach. Everyone, it seems, except John’s own date for the evening, who has just thrown a tantrum worthy of a four year old on a particularly bad sugar high in front of a dozen of John’s friends only to suddenly disappear towards to the main club downstairs, where John is now trying to locate the complete arse.
“You know why I went off Clomipramine: the long-term effects of antidepressants on cognitive functioning are appallingly poorly researched. And that is why I am not resuming it now.”
It is a pattern strong enough that Sherlock would normally have proceeded with the investigation right away, but due to the current risk of adhering to patterns that never existed outside of his head, it's a safer course of action to look for confirmation by finding further data supporting his theory.

A command that Sherlock’s more than willing to obey.
After a few seconds Sherlock turns back to look at the table and his microscope.
“So,” John says again, slowly, deliberately, his spine straight and his eyes measuring Sherlock without any trace of the underlying uncertainty that had been present as he’d brought up the subject of… restraint.

Cocaine, as it turns out, renders ‘understanding’ irrelevant.
A few minutes ago, there came the muted sound of a text alert from the pile of clothes on the floor next to the bed. It registered in Sherlock's mind, but at that moment he'd been otherwise occupied and chose to leave things be for the time being. Now, as the chemical rush after orgasm is slowly dissolving - the reuptake of the neurotransmitters that were released into his bloodstream efficiently clearing away any residue haze - Sherlock recalls the sound once more.

“I do not like being startled. Tickling is appallingly juvenile. This arrangement is not to be discussed with anyone else. I don't like dirt, waiting prolonged periods of time or doing any kind of tasks. I don't enjoy pain for pain’s sake; make it interesting or challenging, or else just leave it. Any kind of humiliation associated with animal-like behaviour or infantilization is clearly off the table. I want to be able to speak, but temporary manual silencing is acceptable.”
Answer to current item - John
Sherlock refuses to acknowledge that he's caught Mycroft’s double -
Only it does, if only theoretically - if only ever for Sherlock, right at this very moment - it does, when what he desires is something that he will never have, and when the person who he desires is willing to agree that it doesn’t, in fact, matter.
It might even be something that will banish some of John's ghosts too, thinks Sherlock, before striding back into the thick of it.
On the train to Edinburgh, a toddler has a tantrum, each scream provoking a flood of tics and compulsions as well as physical pain and a pressure that never recedes. With shame burning in his face, Sherlock locks himself in the foul-smelling train lavatory, giving in to each and every impulse that can be done silently enough not to evoke suspicion.
His scalp stings as his head is slowly pulled back by the hand that’s suddenly not carding - but pulling - his hair. The hand is not loosening its grip even as Sherlock’s head follows it, and the movement makes the back of the wooden desk chair press against his spine in a way that is almost painful.
Sherlock's nape.
. There will always be patterns.
Sherlock has been aware of his own attraction for several months, but it’s been manageable, only making itself known occasionally and until the issue of his sexuality was addressed, it wasn’t something Sherlock had deemed especially noteworthy. He's been superficially attracted to other men before, and while it's occasionally been a cause of mild frustration, most of the time it's just been something he’s taken as a learning opportunity. It's an advantage, being able to observe the physical manifestations of sexual attraction first hand. Knowing your own tells and being able to observe them in others.
Sherlock's expression, carefully blank, is perhaps still giving him away, seeing how his eyes are still unfocused. John's expression is at first unreadable, but then there's a hint of a smile that might be considered slightly smug playing at the corner of his mouth.
Unscientific
The light's shifting, then, replacing acid yellow and pale green with warmer orange, a tint of Tyrian purple.
Immortality
“Alright,” John says, voice odd. “Message received.”
He needs not to think like that. Needs to know what will stop it. Needs to think about anything but--
“Yeah, but you'll have more to catch up on if you are gone longer,” Victor reasons, and right then, Sherlock realises that Victor understands nothing.
He’s halfway to the place one of his contacts recommended when he gets Helena’s answer.
I tried to sneak the word 'disreputable' into this chapter.
. The thought of going to the Yard himself in order to access the files had almost been enough to make Sherlock drop the whole case. It just didn’t seem worth it. He already knows, and further research -
“Delusions which I believe you yourself labelled ‘mental’ not long ago.”
“I think we’ve already established that, so there’s no reason for you to state it several times. It’s getting a bit repetitive.”
Sherlock realises that he's tapping his fingers against his thigh in a rapid rhythm; tap-tap-

Sherlock had inserted himself at the chair by his microscope half an hour ago, attempting to look at some old slides, but his real purpose had been to wait for John to slowly gravitate towards him the way they seem to always gravitate towards each other in time. Now John is standing a few feet away, leaning against the kitchen counter. Seconds ago, he’d been scrolling through the news on his phone. It’s an ideal situation; allowing John a sense of physical advantage due to their relative positions.
-a serotonin supplement
"No. I didn’t do this for any reason whatsoever. This is who I am.”

To keep his expression blank, Sherlock concentrates on tapping his hand against his leg instead; a far from satisfactory substitute.
He can already sense the process starting in his head - calculating 27,
The fan is whisking around air, and the minibar is humming where it stands on the corner of the tiny desk. Sherlock can hear his own breathing, but he can’t make out the sound of John’s.
- Sherlock knows that he has no idea how to actually initiate a situation where he can retest and confirm the observations made during the last physical encounter. He will have to trust himself to read John’s actions in this, and to use his own signals to affect John in a way that wordlessly leads to…
The initial question was this; is it possible to measure the outcome of a partial experiment by the colors you see due to faulty wiring?
Sherlock picks up his phone from his pocket and starts typing. He's typing random Google searches, mostly aiming for effect. In the chair opposite of his, John stares and slowly rubs at the bridge of his nose.
(‘Never one to hide your…
Pointless in this context, but still a solid explanation for his reaction afterwards.
As he's supporting himself on the kitchen table beneath him, Sherlock therefore wills his body to relax a fraction despite the effort it takes to hold this position, willing himself to focus on the dual sensation of the the burning pain on his scalp and the almost sensuous touch of John's fingers.
Right now his cognitive performance is too inconsistent for anything that requires more than a few hours’ work, and while Sherlock’s mind might be superior to almost every other mind even when afflicted by the cacophony of mental clutter that is his particular brand of obsessive-compulsive disorder, being ‘superior’ is not always enough. Not when getting things right as quickly as possible might be a matter of life or death.
Selma, on the other hand, didn’t look miserable. She looked quite intrigued, to be honest. And John couldn’t understand how things had gotten to this point; a point where he was more frustrated over his unhealthy and unadvisable relationship with someone of a gender he wasn’t even attracted to than he was frustrated over the fact that he wasn’t at the after work closing the deal with Eva, who had certainly made it at least moderately clear that advances would be welcome. Shit, he was pissed at the git, and still…
John's voice is slightly mocking, and it's frustrating. And interesting.
No, not resignation. More like he feels that he should attempt to find out, even though he knows he probably wouldn’t like the answer anyway. Good deduction.
It hadn’t even been an interesting case.
Resting his hands on his stomach, Sherlock waits for his breathing to calm down.
“I need you. Naked. Right now.”
He hesitates, his brain overwhelmed by all the different possibilities and lacking the data to distinguish which way is the most efficient.
Without thinking about it, Sherlock lets his own tongue find John’s, wanting to experience and explore it in as many ways as possible, and what is initially tentative soon evolves to something else, something more determined on John's part.
It’s only been two years since he decided that exposure to danger was likely the best way to counteract suicidality in the worn, tired man now on the other end of the phone. As it turns out, the arrangement has proved to be both far more problematic and far more rewarding than Sherlock anticipated.
Making his way to the shower, Sherlock only feels vertigo and the importance of taking an uneven number of steps to reach the bathroom.
Ignoring John’s text, Sherlock finds the number he’s looking for and fires off a text, requesting an appointment for later in the afternoon, before John’s shift ends.
[ ] F = Fantasy
The unscientific use of numbers in pseudoscientific methods of relieving the pressure.
It’s simple, really; while Sherlock might be getting better at living, the man whose phone Sherlock’s currently tapping away at isn’t, and Sherlock does so love to provide the answers to problems that others can’t solve. He decides that he will provide John Watson with what he’s currently missing; the will to live.
Sherlock flinches, not prepared for the sudden sound. His heart races even more, his eyes set on John’s fist rather than on his face.
It seems ironic that one of those problems is the potential irrationality of his own pending decision to die by his own volition.
A cab finally stops at the side of the street, and Sherlock slumps down onto the seat, hating the feeling of the fabric sticking to his skin and the smell of wet wool with every cell in his body.
• a sense that the mind does not rest (i.e. a mental ‘broken record’)
It's simple but potentially destructive chemistry, and Sherlock is quite intrigued by both chemistry and destruction, after all.
“After you,” John offers casually, holding the door open for him, and Sherlock allows himself to remain where he is, allows one more moment of staring John down whilst John refuses to be the least bit fazed by the defiance of it.
His own muscles, his own perception, eluding him like this.
The sounds emerging from the club about thirty feet away from where they're sitting are strangely muted by the cold, crisp air, but still there's dozens of people hanging out around the entrance, standing in small groups and talking.
John’s voice is obscured by Sherlock’s skin as John’s lips are just an inch away from the tendons of his neck. John's breath is hot against his skin, but the skin is damp with saliva and the warmth is soon replaced by the slight chill of evaporation.
John is frustrated, and he knows it doesn't help, knows Sherlock well enough to understand that this is a sore subject for some reason, possibly related to Sherlock's fears of ‘imposing himself’ on John sexually.
“Yeah, feel free to remind me; what is it that you imagine that I’ve done now?” John asks, beginning to taking his jacket off, seemingly undisturbed by Sherlock’s proximity. “You’re aware that I’ve been asleep for the last six hours, right?”
touch-- and he swallows, thoughts rushing through his head.
He offers the DI a polite smile, handing him the pipe before wiping his hands against his coat to rid them of any dirt.
“Sherlock, you think planes are silver birds. I still find your mind amazing.”
(Would it still be worth it then?)
“You didn’t object at the time.”
John's answer is firm, muffled only slightly by the proximity of their mouths.
“Eh, he was right about most things. About me, I mean. What he said about you, well; that’s between the two of you. If you don’t want to talk about it, let’s talk about something else.”
Obsessions are thoughts that recur and persist despite efforts to ignore or confront them. People with OCD frequently perform tasks, or compulsions, to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. Within and among individuals, the initial obsessions, or intrusive thoughts, vary in their clarity and vividness. A relatively vague obsession could involve a general sense of disarray or tension accompanied by a belief that life cannot proceed as normal while the imbalance remains. A more intense obsession could be a preoccupation with the thought or image of someone close to them dying or intrusions related to "relationship rightness." Other obsessions concern the possibility that someone or something other than oneself—such as God, the Devil, or disease—will harm either the person with OCD or the people or things that the person cares about. Other individuals with OCD may experience the sensation of invisible protrusions emanating from their bodies, or have the feeling that inanimate objects are ensouled.
“I’d rather not know what you’re planning to do,” Lestrade cuts him off.
“Apophany,” Sherlock fills in, already regretting using the word.
Sherlock lowers his newspaper, eyeing John whilst trying to figure out what John’s getting at.
. I know you don’t mean anything by it, and I shouldn’t let it get to me.”
Feverishly fumbling for the bottle of lube in the creases and folds of the sheets, John lets himself get high on that very thought. Stroking his own cock with lube makes him realise that Sherlock’s cock might be in a similar state of ache. John leans over to get his hand underneath Sherlock, grabbing his cock and stroking it three times before letting it jut back against the tense stomach that his own knuckles had just grazed.
Right now, he’s not even sure if he wants to get used to it. At all. Ever.
- from him before he was even twenty.
It does, however, seem to serve a purpose, because John’s movements grow bolder, and that’s something that Sherlock will always want. The feeling of John taking what he wants, directing this to his own liking, using Sherlock to meet his needs. It’s intoxicating, and it’s abandon. It does make sense, in that context, because giving John something that he wants is logical if Sherlock wants to do this again. And he does. But if Sherlock is honest with himself he'll also acknowledge that such ulterior motives rarely surfaces when he’s under the influence of the dopamine, ephidephrine and endorphins that's currently flooding his blood. No, the gain of giving John something that he’ll want  again is secondary to his own need to feel John take it from him. He’s not quite sure what ‘it’ is, but it might be control, responsibility for John’s pleasure and the logistics of these things.
At times, he can physically walk or shake it off. Not now, though, because John’s crowding his space, holding him there, and John’s hand on his chest is…
"Richard Solomon developed a motivational theory based on opponent processes. Basically he states that every process that has an affective balance, (i.e. is pleasant or unpleasant), is followed by a secondary, "opponent process". This opponent process sets in after the primary process is quieted. With repeated exposure, the primary process becomes weaker while the opponent process is strengthened."
Another car passes them by, momentarily making everything far too bright.
John’s mind is a bit affected by the alcohol, but he has lived with Sherlock long enough to be able to follow most patterns laid out in front of him no matter what state his brain is in.
- given the right incitement, John would be willing to try, but he’s tired from the two bus rides to Ella’s office and there’s a burning sensation in his leg. Still, he could recite the paragraphs about hypervigilance and dissociation from his old medical textbooks, but most likely his therapist would find the descriptions a bit outdated. After all, it was over thirteen years ago that he memorised them, and while John was busy extracting shrapnel from infected wounds and being woken up by the sound of gunfire, perhaps some ivory-tower academic had the opportunity to scrutinise and update the possible outcomes for the poor sods for those who put themselves out there, trying to make a difference.
Helena would have said, and Sherlock wants to get his phone out and tell her how off-target that is, how much it is about him actually not being human enough to handle such inane things as sentiment and expectations of his behavior.
His body is still flooded with stress hormones after the… unsettling experience minutes earlier, not to mention the even more unsettling discussion that followed, and there’s a restless feeling in his bones that makes him want to pace and move his body, disallowing the unease to settle to deep.
Seeing a red car park on the driveway, silence settles between them as the wait for the moment the driver gets out.

John meets his eyes as Sherlock’s head is forced back so that he’s looking at John, and it shouldn’t be possible to look more naked than Sherlock had done mere minutes ago, but apparently it is.
“You'll have to learn to observe, then,” John simply states, putting an end to that discussion. “Tell me, is this something you want most of the time, or just at certain times?”
It’s freezing, but that’s not even a distraction.
“If you spent more time working with me and less time at the clinic you wouldn't be so clearly out of the habit of climbing. It's hardly my fault you flailed and almost kicked me.”
What it is; an unspoken request for John's permission.
“It seems cheaper than just paying everyone else off and still pretending to be a winner when the last opponent folds.”
“It is,” John says, but he doesn’t move away.
the connection between his central and his peripheral nervous system. Between his nerves signalling sensory input and his brain registering and interpreting the sensations.
What or whom you desire shouldn’t define you. Unfortunately, Sherlock knows that in the eyes of most people, it does.
Being gay, it seems to Sherlock, is less about who you are attracted to than it is about how you look and act.
It's all he's left with.
Sherlock’s not exactly looking forward to what he knows will come next; increased severity of the original symptoms. He’s not looking forward to it, but he regards himself as well prepared for it. He hadn’t expected the anxiety - still an appalling word - to be this intense and for some reason this miscalculation makes him feel even more appalled. Apparently, he couldn’t even make a correct estimation of the degree of withdrawal symptoms that would likely affect him. After spending another hour re-reading the electronic versions of the leaflets for the medication and a few research articles, he regards himself as more prepared for the strong possibility that the sudden loss of serotonin re-uptake could induce a depressive state. It’s nothing he hasn’t experienced before, at least, and that means that he’s prepared for what to come.
Taking the stairs two at a time, the boundaries of Sherlock’s sphere and John’s are markedly blurred. John’s colours bleed onto Sherlock from where he walks one step ahead, and Sherlock wonders if it’s possible to see it - see the reflection of John’s colors on Sherlock’s own skin.
“You see,” Sherlock interrupts, now looking sharply at Selma. “John suffers from a highly codependent personality and a lack of self confidence resulting from his inability to be useful as an army doctor ever since a bullet destroyed his scapula. He leans on me to give his life enough excitment so that he won't think about dying anymore, and what that says about his choices in life I will leave unsaid. Additionally, he's unable to maintain any romantic relationship for more than a few weeks. He is, however, blessedly free from homosexuality. Given all his other issues, he should count himself lucky not to be gay as well, don't you think?”
When they get into a taxi two hours later, Sherlock’s pulse is hammering away, nausea washing over him in wave after wave.
John’s voice goes from the khaki of deeply uncomfortable to a deep green as he starts talking about the psychotropic drugs. Sherlock sees how John’s internal focus shifts as he speaks. Where before John was self-conscious and not letting too much show, not taking any risks, he is now fixed on Sherlock, automatically entering doctor mode -
Selma shrugs, finally putting her phone down in her lap before she speaks again.
(If it was, it would be a civil war, because John isn’t the enemy, whatever Sherlock’s mind might indicate from time to time.)
It doesn’t matter, but it's somehow crucial. The thought of John attempting to talk to him, attempting to meet his eyes, asking him if he’s alright--
Heading back towards Montague Street, he pops one of the antacids out in his palm. If he’s walking just a bit faster than he did before, well; it has nothing to do with what just happened.
(Is that what Sherlock wants?)
Simply asking would of course be the simplest way to find out whether John would be amenable, but putting John in a situation where he's expected to make use of objects he probably lacks experience with has a potential risk of making John feel out of his depth. An additional problem might arise if John finds that Sherlock is in any way directing…
(They must have been rutting against each other as Sherlock’s thoughts had raced through his head, because he’s slightly out of breath and John is flustered, but Sherlock’s not more than half hard and it feels embarrassing, somehow. His body refusing to engage without his brain being in on it.)
There's a case to solve, and fuck any and all thoughts on what objections his flatmate might have.
When she finishes, Sherlock nods.
(He could use the danger and the distraction and the chase and--)
John had insisted at buying Selma something to drink, which she’d only accepted after he’d mentioned the appalling payroll situation for nurses in London. She’d settled for a White Russian - as low in alcohol as possible - while he’d gone straight for a strong lager.
some things remains inevitable, just like the light of day.
Their positions are far from ideal for the coming proceedings, but it can’t be helped. As soon as Sherlock’s mind takes in the whole situation there’ll be too many patterns, too many options, risks and possibilities. It’s a paralytic, and he can’t afford that at this point.
“I… assist. With the medical issues. And with some practical issues.” John is so used to only introducing his role in their work when they are on a crime scene or meeting a suspect, and doing it in this setting, with colleagues that he has yet to inform about his other occupation, is proving to be more difficult than he’d imagined it to be.
As he grew up, it soon became clear that he needn't go to so much trouble most of the time; his vile temper and sharp tongue was more than enough to keep most people at a distance that would prevent them from even trying.
But to John, that’s apparently not acceptable, simply because Sherlock had used pain for other purposes over a decade ago.
Beside him, Sherlock almost feels as if John’s colors have shifted to a more vibrant set of purple and pulsing red, but it isn’t really John’s colors, so it might be his own. Except he never could see his own colors.
“And that is actually the problem,” Mycroft continues, and Sherlock feels a pang of something like trepidation.
It’s the morning after their mutual attempts of verbally disarming the other, and at least they are talking.
John nods in a way that means he not only does not understand, but has now also given up on trying, and is getting increasingly frustrated.
