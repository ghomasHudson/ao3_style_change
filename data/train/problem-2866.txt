“Wow, so, this is your surprise trip?”
Dean rolls his eyes, annoyed.
“—It’s Cas, Jimmy.”

Castiel decides to clean his kitchen because now, fluor is everywhere. Thanks to Claire.

Magnus let them get into his loft; It’s cozy, but not really his style, too many antique things, but they didn’t come here to commentated this warlock’s loft, so, whatever. Magnus shows them to his living room, and of course, it’s never as smooth as we expected; there are other Nephilims already sits on the couch.
“Our new coach is a bit –a dick. But we are awesome, so he is quiet,” Dean says. He washes his hand and then dries them, “we won four times this morning.”

Oh, wait. they said that they have books about them? And Simon knew about the book.
“Yes! I take it you all already read the book?”
Dean and Castiel's relationship still a secret from the public.
Benji smiles and hugs Castiel, “Thank you for being there for him and for being here with him. He is means so much to me.”
All of the man appearances, screaming,
Gabriel nods at him, “Yep, Michael in the cage, in hell, with Lucifer.”
Izzy sighs and answers, “Said the Clave. They were more like the government for the shadowhunters, Nephilims like us.”
“It’s Lake Lyn, and it’s in Alicante,” Alec looks at Cas and Gabriel back and forth, “Alicante is the home city of the Nephilim. And it’s warded to another being other than us, Nephilim. And in this case, if I put one and one together, the ward is against the other angels as well. Maybe that’s why you never found Raziel.”
On that island —Gabriel showed Castiel animals, plants, insects, and many others that lived on earth. Castiel liked honey bees. He thinks they were unique, plus they have four wings, just like him and his brothers. And they were black and yellow, just like a combination of his wings color and Gabriel's.
“Can you help me to wash the blueberries, princess?” Castiel takes the blueberries from the plastic box to a fruit washer container, then gave them to Claire.

From there, Dean learns so much about the twins, especially Castiel, of course. There’s a video about Castiel –or as he prefers, Cas– and Jimmy's past, about their parents, and all. The twins only have each other this whole time; their parents died when they were 16. Since then, their godparents took care of them. But they are on their own again at 18, and it is clear, Jimmy cares about Castiel and vice versa.
"But, if Raziel managed to hide these entire times, how could you find us now?" asks Izzy, who looks more confused now.
When things got worst on Earth, Jonathan prays to Raziel to make
When Castiel lay his eyes for the first time on the Winchesters, Castiel knew this family would be so powerful.
Morning comes by fast enough for him.

When Castiel on his own, he tries to make new friends.
The lunch goes really well, they all eat happily, and of course, they all are love his cook. Mia, she definitely a fan of him because she like cooking and tries things in the kitchen. And there are some things about these teenagers that draws his and Dean’s attention.

, It’s on Gabriel’s face too, “Your warlock friend right there was Asmodeus’s son himself, the one princes of hell, and you all are quite close, I see. What the difference?” Gabriel postures his body, ready to fight, ready to smite everyone.
“I am an Angel of the Lord,” answers one of them who wears the trenchcoat.
Castiel turns his head back to Benji, who sits beside Dean. Benji looks at him with his teary eyes, “come here,” he mouth the words silently to Benji.
Charlie helps Castiel to enter their room code. They also invited Dorothy, Garth, and Lee —they are Dean’s teammates at The Hunter— to play with them.
“1 to 3? Relax, you’ll be the crew, Cas.” Dean wiggles his brows teases Cas.
Castiel chuckles, “I am, but—please don’t look at me like that,” he says shyly.
urge to run away when he noticed all eyes on him.
Sam had given an order to all hunters and men of letter to move to the lower ground level of the bunker ever since they brought Michael back from the cage. It was Gabriel’s order actually because Michael is not used to be around humans.
Alec sees his sister frowning, looks confused, “Wait. Lucifer is a devil—
“Missed you too, baby brother,” Dean kiss his temple. He pushes him out from the hug and waves his hand, “and congratulation! All of you!” and he grins.
Dean reaches Cas’ hand on the table and intertwines their fingers, “Babe, our high school love stories were better than all of them,” he half-whispers.
, “You said you got a lead to—what’s his name again? Haziel?
“I could back to heaven and bring you your grace from your cabinet. What do you think?” Castiel offers. He can’t help Gabriel and Jack to heal Michael. Angels could heal their fellow angels with the same range—except healers angel—and he was a Seraph; that’s why he can’t heal an Archangel. At least he offers some help, right?
Jack smile excitedly, “I’d like that!”

“I think, I will think about that,” Lucy girns.
Victor’s eyes go wide again, surprised, “How did you know?”
Dean Joins him in their bed, laying on his stomach, places his arm on Cas’ shoulders, “What are you looking at?”
After he looks around, he turns back to Dean, “Oh, so, you bring me here just to cooks whatever it is for your cousin’s party?” he asks with smirks on his lips.
“Ssst!” the new guy raises his hand, stops Alec, “before you ask anything, I am Gabriel, the archangel. And he is my brother, Castiel, and his friends. We are here to find our brother Raziel who was hiding from heaven for thousands of years.”
About Castiel and how he found the missing Raziel's Nephilim.
When Dean meets Jimmy for the first time, it was at the twins' 25 birthday, Dean can immediately tell the difference between the twins.
Castiel grins, “I love you, Charlie, you are so patient with me,” he holds his hands on his chest, “Okay, Dean, explain, now.”
“Okay,” with his fluttering sound, Gabriel disappears.
“Okay, alright,
“maybe, I am Castiel—
you loved after this.”
"So, we all fight side by side to lock Lucifer back into hell. When the apocalypse was over, Raziel disappeared, as did the Nephilims he created, in this case, your ancestors. We thought he was dead. That's why now we are looking for Raziel, because yesterday, we felt his presence, somewhere on earth, we believe he is out there, and he is still alive," Gabriel looks at the Nephilims in front of him, who exchange their glances with the other.
, their new year kiss. Since that, Castiel and Dean are dating; secretly.
So, because there are not many Supernatural-Shadowhunters crossover fics out there, I made one on my own.
Castiel asked again, "What makes humans perfect, brother?"
? "Try again; that's impossible! Who are you? What do you want?” asks Alec.
Benji shakes his head, cuts Cas’ words, “No, I mean, Dean, a bottom, a sub?”
All of them snickering at Cas’s innocent question. Except for Dean, of course. Dorothy patiently explains to Castiel, “that’s because you and Dean are the imposters, Cas.”
Magnus frowns; what was

Sam sighs and rolls his eyes, “Yeah, that’s right. Turn out, the writer is a prophet, and he writes them.”
“Who else in the cabin?” asks Victor beside him.
“Oh, Castiel, You are always the smartest one! It would be great, please,” ever since the first apocalypse, Michael gives Angels an order to saved some of their grace in a vial every year for this very reason, to help their self-healing. It was like… human’s blood donor.

or whatever, who broke the first seal.
Dean locks the Impala before he reaches his hand to hold Cas’ and intertwines their fingers, “My cousin’s graduated from high school, and his parents couldn’t make it. Poor him, I know. So, my uncle asked me a favor; this. To make a graduation party for him, plus we got permission to use the master bedroom, and this cabin is awesome. Figures it would be a surprise for you and him as well, he doesn’t know I’m here, but he and his friends will be here tomorrow at lunch.”
“Once? What do you mean could only be done once?” asks Sam. Hell, even Dean, maybe Jack, too —because right now the kid frowning and tilting his head, looks confused— have the same question.
Castiel let Michael borrowed some of his suits; because, really, Michael was wearing a tunic—a
He loves Michael. He loves Raphael. Hell, he even loved Lucifer! But he could not see them fight anymore. So when God left heaven, he decided to left heaven as well.

Clarie jump from the kitchen stall who gets scolds from her father. Jimmy picks her up and carries her to the bathroom to clean her mess.
Cas can’t help his laughter, and Dean pinches Cas’ backhand, “Yes, I am. What’s the point of being bisexual if I’m the one who always fuck my partner,” Dean shrugs his shoulder like it was nothing.
Dean laughs, he can’t hold it anymore, Clarie is too adorable. She covers Dean’s mouth with her hands to stop him from his laughs, “Shh… silent Dee, or I won't share my pie with you.”
Castiel looks so pleased when he hears that, “So, would you agree to come with me to the bunker?” he raises his brow, and it does look intimidating even with a smile on his face.
The shadowhunters’ reactions are priceless, except Simon. He looks like he is deep in his thought, “You go first, Gabe, I need to say something to them. Cas and Jack will fly us there.”
. He and Amelia figured that Claire has a quite
Magnus sharps his ears and listens intently to their whispers. He can't stop thinking about how strange this situation is? An Angel? And he's looking for Raziel? Which apparently is an angel as well? The last time he checks, it’s rare for an angel to flies down to earth.
Benji turns around to his friends; they still stand in their place at the front door. He smiles again, “Guys, this is my cousin from LA, Dean, and his boyfriend, Castiel.”
One day, Raziel came to God and explained his plan to created an army of half-human half-angel on earth to fight Lucifer's army. This plan got many pro

“Alright, come here, you all, let’s do a group hug,” says Dean. He moves Benji to his side. So he could hug his boyfriend and his cousin in his arms, and the others join them after that.
Clary looks at his friends, eyes pleading for her friends’ help, “We need the mortal instruments to summon him. And we don’t have them anymore,” Izzy helps answer the questions.
This is the beginning of time. Before something important's gone missing.
Dean has subscribed to Castiel's channel right away since they first meet and watch all Castiel's videos from the very first video. When Dean finds out Castiel had a twin for the first time— to be honest, he feels a bit—

And of course, they win,
“I’m confused,” Cas types on their room chat.
Cas can see that this boy’s eyes go wide and his face goes red, and it makes him chuckles because it makes him remembers Dean’s reaction when they first met, “easy there, I don’t bite,” he jokes, “what’s your name?”
Jack giggles to himself. Of course, he is the only one who understands! “Dad said,

Her eldest son—Dean, almost died from a car accident caused by Azazel.
If he thinks about it again with his rational mind—
Dean and Castiel’s relationship is still a secret from the public. But they did tell their subscribers that they have a boyfriend.
Dean walks towards Castiel and starts the dishes, “you make a pie with a chocolate crust?”
Dean nods, softened when he sees Jack, “I’m sorry, but this is a mean situation.”
“Turn out, it was Azazel doing, one of the Princes of Hell,” Alec sees Simon rest his gaze on Magnus for a moment and smile at him like he tries to assure Magnus, “Anyway, Azazel had a mission from Lucifer, to open the Gate of Hell. And he needed special people to did that. I forgot the pattern. Azazel nearly killed them, Dean was in a coma, but his father traded his soul to Azazel; to save Dean’s life. After John’s death, Sam and Dean were keep hunting, later they found out that Azazel did something to Sam when he was a baby because Sam had this psychic ability, so were the others.”
Jack’s smile grows wide after that, “Okay,” he says excitedly.
Jack places his hand on Gabriel’s knee, “Uncle Gabe, that’s rude,” he warns his uncle.
“I believe them,” says Magnus, and all eyes turn to him, “I could feel their power—or grace? It felt similar with the Angel core in the institute, but theirs—felt more intense.”

He smiles again, “Thank you, Magnus. And about that... Actually, we are quite busy at the moment, we just bring Michael back from hell, and I'm afraid we couldn’t leave him alone in our place. Would you mind if I bring you to our place?” Castiel tilts his head and gives them questioning frowns on his face.

The room fall silent for a few minutes, all of them are busy with their thoughts.
“What about you, Bens?” asks Dean.
Cas chuckles, “doesn’t matter. You are with me now.”
They start their Channel since they were 18, right after their high-school graduation. At that time, the twins take a rest, almost a year, before they got into college. They plan to travel all around the world. They go to 15 countries; they are Netherland, England, Japan, South Korea, Australia, France, Switzerland, Egypt, Greece, Norway, Ireland, Spain, Russia, Germany, and Jamaica.

Benji shakes his head, no, “No, my dad said, we only need to show up there; maybe he already set up something in there? I don’t know!” he rolls his eyes, still upset at his parents.
They reach the highest point of their fame when Castiel comes out as a Gay to James on their 20 birthday. Castiel gets all support from his twin brother and all their subscribers. They are already in college at that time. Castiel takes a Culinary Art School meanwhile James takes a Business School. They have this dream; to makes a famous Restaurant or Bakery or Coffee Shop,

Dean takes a spoon full of pie filling from Castiel, for an instant, his eyes are light up, “wow, babe,” Dean peck Castiel’s lips, “this is so fucking delicious!”

“Because there were too many racist people in there, in my town where I lived. I mean, they were okay with LGBTQ+ things, but when it comes to races, it’s a different story.

“I don’t think that wise, Sam. I prefer to talk about this with my brothers and Michael first,” says Castiel, “Because it could change these shadowhunters’ glory over their enemy, too.”
Okay, not really.
In the last three months, Castiel decided to stay with his brother, Gabriel, on Earth. After the first apocalypse, Gabriel decided to came down to Earth. He didn't like to see his brothers fought all the time.

“So, how was Alicante?” asks Magnus to Alec while he made his favorite cocktail. He mixes some liquors into his glass and
“Actually, I have Hungarian-Russian Jewish, German, Scottish, and Irish blood in me. Plus, My family is very religious. See, I was named after the archangel Cassiel, my twin brother was named after Saint James who was also The Lord’s brother. My Father and his brothers were named after the archangels. So, there were my reasons why I couldn’t come out sooner.”

Cas’ eyes go wide at that, and he nearly screams when he speaks next, “if you ask me, I would scream to you ‘
“Maybe, I could bring you there,” Magnus offers, “The ward is familiar with my power. If I can go there, I’m sure you can.”
Dean keeps his hand busy while tells Castiel; he installs their own WiFi because there’s no signal at all here. He pulls out their toiletries and places them in the bathroom and others. And Castiel just sits on the edge of their bed and listening to his boyfriend. It’s not like Cas didn’t do or help anything; It’s just their thing. For now, Dean is way better in this, so he did it. But if something they think Cas’ way better than Dean, that’s it, Cas will do whatever that is.

They, too, ally with witches, weres, vamps, really, just like us. So, Sam and Dean learn about—everything, plus they have had a literal Angel by their side since then.
Gabriel and Castiel share a look like they have a little discussion in their heads, “May I see them?” Castiel reaches out his hand, “I would like to see them from your memory.”
Hearing that name, Castiel returned to heaven immediately, which he predicted was in pure chaos. All angels in heaven knew this was the beginning of
At 26, Castiel finds out that he can do this on his own. Dean and Charlie teach him how to play some games and do the live stream every Tuesday and Thursday. And Castiel will do his cooking segment every Saturday. Sometimes Dean, Charlie, and Dorothy accompany him to taste his meals. They always go to the Pride Festival together every year, without Benny, because he is now engaged to a beautiful woman named Andrea and too busy with the restaurant.
"Not yet, but—"
Castiel stands side by side with Jimmy. They smile at Dean and Clarie, “great guy you have there, Cassie,” Jimmy whispers, and he smiles.
And that’s it, and then he talks about it in Enochian with Gabriel.
“How about you, Lucy?” asks Castiel.
Dean winces, glances at Castiel when he hears his name. He scoffs before says, “Okay, buddy, first, we don’t talk about

He looks at Cas, the seraph gives the shadowhuntes his gentle smiles, "There is no crime in that, don't worry, I can assure you about that. I practically raised Dean from hell, rebuild his soul and body, and he remains whole and perfect."
They nod, yes, “About the smoke that turns—”
Alec looked at his friends. He knew that if he says that he believes it then, they will believe it too. He is the head of the institute and he needs to make a decision, “I believe it, Castiel said it was written by a Prophet; so, I’m going to give them a chance. Maybe we should bring them to the institute in the morning,” there, he said it, “Can we sent them a fire message or—or maybe,

“Why mine and Dean’s name are red?” Castiel innocently asks.
"Okay, first of all, how could you all still be alive?" asks Gabriel too to the point.
“Alec, who are they?” asks the guy with blond hair.
It's when he knows the Angel will bring them to
Alec tells him about his day in Alicante.

strange because of their contrasting appearance. Two of them wore flannel shirts, one with a denim jacket and one with a leather jacket on. one person was wearing a suit like an accountant with a trench, another person looked like a teenager with casual clothes like a tee and denim outer.
“Really, Cas?” Benji asks.
This time Clary reaches her hand out and lets Cas hold it. Clary closes her eyes, and Cas’ eyes begin to glow with his grace. It’s only a few seconds before Cas let out Clary’s hand and mutters something under his breath.
Dean looks very exhausted; his eyes a bit red, dry, maybe because he stares at the computer too long. Castiel cups Dean's face with his hands, “you are doing a great job,” he says. Castiel turns to the stove, there was still some pie filling left in the pan, and takes a spoon for Dean, “try this.”
Michael raises his brow, turns his head to glare at Gabriel behind him, “doing okay?

In the same year, Castiel and James manage to open their first restaurant, but they entrust their business to Benny. And they were pleased with Benny’s work at their restaurant. Castiel back on his own.
But, everything that Castiel predicted was right. The Winchester is now
To Castiel, the Campbell’s cabin is too big to be called a cabin. There are six bedrooms with an ensuite in each of them, a bar with cabinets full of wines and liquors, a very minimalist-yet-very modern kitchen (which is instantly got a heart's eye from him), and a big backyard and living room.

Dean nods, “Maybe? Maybe yes, maybe not? Look, we— we have done this before, many times. Our family taught us about this from generation to generation. We were not only could travel in time, but we also could open a rift to other alternate universes ourselves.”
Minutes later, after Sam talks to Maggie to take control for a while and passes some tasks to her, they are all ready to go. And just like that, Cas and Jack
It’s not that easy tho; He and Charlie have to pass some tests in their quarantine for months with other hundred peoples. And, thank God, to keep miss fortune on his side, He and Charlie get into the same game team (Dean was on the male team, and Charlie was on the female team).

He got new friends from Pride Festival in California. They are; Charlie Bradbury, she is a Gamers YouTubers, she had won some international games tournament. She has a girlfriend named Dorothy Baum, and she is a writer. And then there is Benny Lafitte, who is a chef. Castiel offers Benny to accompanies him for his YouTube cooking segment since Amelia gets Pregnant. And the last, there is Dean Winchester, to Castiel, he is the most gorgeous human alive in the world! He is best friend with Charlie and Gamers YouTubers and in the same gamer's team with Charlie.
And Dean smiles, “That’s a story for another time, right now, I want to talk to all of you,” his smile fall, his face now full of seriousness, “I know this is all sounds crazy for all of you, from your faces, I know you didn’t trust us, and It’s okay. You only have to trust your gut. I believe you all are aware of the massive death all over the states?”
Haha I know this is absurd, I just trying to pleased my self lmao.
And Castiel, too. He tilts his head, trying to understand the situation, “Who said that was a crime?”
They were the first God's creatures, celestial beings. They were God's firstborn. The archangels were one of God’s primordial beings, heaven's most fearsome wrath, the first and the most powerful celestial being ever created by God.

At 24, Dean realizes that he is bisexual, he tells Benny, Charlie, and her girlfriend Dorothy, and they are thrilled at that, but he stays in the closet.
Lucy looks at him for a moment and says, “I kind of work part-time at catering, and it makes me want to go to a culinary school, but I didn’t know where to go.”
“I want choco pie with ice cream,” she answers with her big innocent eyes.
“Hello, Alexander,” greets Castiel. He smiles and gives a little head bow to his friends. Alec wants to respond, Of course. He just didn’t know what to say to the Angel, “My apologies, I was a bit late.”
Everyone looks surprised to hear Gabriel's words, “You don’t know?” he asks, “Good, it’s proof for you that you can’t judge people just because their parents are from hell. You might be surprised that Jack here way better than all of you here.”
“It’s all right, Castiel. We need them to bring our brother back to heaven. Now, go.”

“Morning, babe,” Benji smiles a little when Victor leans in to kiss him on the lips. His mood scale is raised a bit.
Dean brings down the plates and sets up the table, but Dean frowns at the sight, “isn’t this looks too formal for you, babe?”

It’s not because he is Russian, so he made Russian meals, but because, in the original Russian recipe of Befstroganov, they did not use alcohol in it.

“Right, So, Sam found out about Dean’s deal with the demon. They were looking out for ways to break the deal, but--nothing. They searched the demon who held Dean's contract; they assumed it had to be Lilith, the Queen of Hell. They tracked her down and tried to kill her, but no, in the end, Dean’s time was out. Dean was killed--by the hellhounds; they dragged his soul straight to hell.
When Dean sees Castiel’s laughing face from their stream video, he can’t help but joins the others, laughs. If being a fool in this game makes Castiel laughs like that, Dean, without hesitation, will pretend to be a fool all the time.

“Azazel came to houses where had six months old babies; to fed his blood to the babies to make them ‘special’—In this case, it was Sam,” Simon frowns a little like he tries to remember the whole story, “So, they were focused, on these ‘special kids’ cases for a moment, they tracked down Azazel with that leads.

“So, from the start,” Simon shifts in his seat, position himself so that he faces all of them, “Their mother died when Sam was a baby, and Dean was 4, it was pretty awful actually, knowing that all of that was real. She was killed—by a supernatural being with yellow eyes in a fire. Since then, their father, John, was obsessed—to find the thing that killed his wife. Until one day, he disappeared on his sons. Oh, Sam once left Dean and his father- for college, but then his girlfriend was killed- by the same thing, who killed his mother. They are the same as us, but they are—wider; they hunt demons, rough vampires, werewolves, djinn, ghosts, wendigo, witches, ghouls, etc.
They run to the rooftop as fast as possible. Alec is ready with his bow and Magnus with his magic. But their steps stop when they see a bunch of strange people on their rooftop.
“How can we believe you?” asks him. Because for him, it is possible—that these persons in front of him might be Angel of the lord. Because the power he felt earlier is so strong, and definitely not a warlock because he can recognize them if they are.

Until one day, Castiel heard the angels talking about a hunter named Mary Campbell who made a deal with one of the princes of hell, Azazel, to save John Winchester's life—The last main lineage Winchester alive. Castiel came to Mary; he warned her that her deal with Azazel could curse her descendants. But Mary didn't care, she loved John, and she was willing to pay the price.
