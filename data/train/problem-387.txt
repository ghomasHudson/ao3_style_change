he found in the kitchen. When Sherlock was set up at the kitchen table, John would find himself reading in his arm chair, listen to the clinking of glassware and Sherlock’s humming as he took notes. John would watch telly in the evenings, while Sherlock retreated to his ‘Mind Palace’. Or at least he claimed to go to his ‘Mind Palace’, but more than once, John had caught him reacting to what was just on the screen. And then there were times when they’d both be quietly on their computers, Sherlock spread out on the couch, and John at the desk, one of them would make a random passing comment, and thus spark an entire equally random conversation. John didn’t quite understand it, he had never really hung around the house with any of his friends with whom he’d previously flat-shared, but with Sherlock, they seemed to gravitate towards the same place, gravitate towards each other. Maybe it was just a symptom of age. Whatever it was, it was new, it was definitely different, and John found it oddly comforting.
“Well, as fulfilling as that was, I have to go. I want to start analyzing those samples.” He says, sitting up.
“An illegal copy.” Sherlock said, raising an eyebrow. “And we’re still not supposed to be here after hours, so it’s still trespassing at the very least. My initial surprise stands, I never took you for a criminal.”
“No, you probably shouldn’t have.” John mumbled, unable to suppress the small smile working its way on to his face.
– just touch me. Let me – let me touch you. Please,” Sherlock whimpered, digging his fingers into the back of John’s neck as he reclaimed his mouth over and over again. “John, please – I want to feel you.”
The rifle butt to his head didn’t come as a surprise, neither did the headache when he awoke an hour later in his cell. It was worth it.
Trying and failing to hold back a snort, John earned himself a frown from Sherlock. But in the few months he had known him, appropriate behavior and Sherlock Holmes did not seem to go hand in hand.
“I’m glad, I’m glad.” John laughed. “I also want to especially thank my new in-laws for allowing us to be here, and opening up their beautiful home, making this all possible.” Both Holmes’ nodded their appreciation at the round of applause, Mrs. Holmes becoming so overcome with emotion that she had to bury her face in her husband’s shoulder.
“Yep, I really, really love kissing you, and so I really like my lips being able to actually feel when they’re kissing yours.”
After the photos, they spoke with Lestrade, in a strictly ‘off the record’ capacity of course. He was reluctant at first, advising them to just go through the police, but agreed to help nonetheless. He drew up an official report, filled in all the relevant details, and then held off on filing until necessary.
February meant head colds, the seasonal flu, and sore throats, along with the year-round earaches, rashes, and asthma flare-ups. And while John was kept busy tending to London’s sick and aching, the work was not as mentally taxing as he wished, and his thoughts inevitably floated back to dark curls, pale skin, and a razor sharp mind that couldn’t leave well enough alone.
John insisted Sherlock eat something for breakfast, and Sherlock grudgingly forced down two slices of toast, and a soft boiled egg. Because of the hearing, they had both decided to skip their Friday classes, and instead spent the morning trying – and failing – to relax. In his head, Sherlock went over all the evidence and what he was going to say, and if the low murmuring was any indication, John was doing the same. Mike wished them both luck, and informed them he’d probably be gone when they got back – spending the weekend at his parent’s – and to be sure to text him how it went. A couple of the guys from the teams sent them texts of encouragement throughout the day, and at about two o’clock they started getting ready, each taking turns in the bathroom.
“I said I’d dance with you if you told me five correct things about me, and you told me five correct things about me.” John said, moving towards the dance floor.
“I’d really rather not discuss this with you, Mrs. Hudson. And John is not my ‘young man’, as you say.” His sex life, and all around interpersonal failures, was the very last topic Sherlock wanted to get into with the woman he had come to view as a second mother.
The further away Sherlock got, the more it hurt. The more it hurt, the more John missed him. John missed Sherlock so badly he found himself staring at his phone as he lay in bed at night, going through the random photos he had taken of his friend over the course of their friendship. Candid pictures at crime scenes when Sherlock wasn’t looking and the light hit him just right – the light seemed to always hit him just right – or over dinner when he had food stuck to his face. There was the picture Mike had forwarded of the two of them from his birthday party. A few times, John had to stop himself from making the antler photo his phone background. It was ridiculous, to miss someone you saw every day, but he still missed him. It was bad, and it wasn’t getting any better. The more he missed Sherlock, the more John wanted him, and the more John wanted him, the more it hurt. It was a vicious cycle – the hurting, and the missing, and the wanting – and it seemed John’s only reprieve was their Friday nights at the gym. John treasured those nights; those nights became the only time he could enjoy even a hint of the – physical – closeness they had once shared.
“Sound reasoning.” Sherlock laughed, he loved it that John tried to make one of his decisions sound like it was based on any sort of logical thought process, when really it just ‘felt’ right, sounded right. It did sound right though, their names joined together, it sounded perfect. “So we’re to be Sherlock and John Watson-Holmes?”
“Oh I know what a chokehold is,” Sherlock let a small smile creep across his face, “I was just wondering if you’re actually tall enough to reach my neck.”
“I guess I have a blind spot when it comes to you.” Sherlock mumbled. “I didn’t want to get my hopes up.”
that is was; so for the first time since the call, John began to feel hopeful. Sherlock was going to wake up, at any moment his eyes were going to open, he was going to see John, he was going to speak, and John was going to get him back. It was only a matter of time, and all John had to do was wait.
“Alright Sherlock, assuming you’re correct about this,” Lestrade piped up, “how do you know Emily is involved?”
“Why are you doing this?” John asks, feeling tears form in his eyes. “I know you love me, you know I love you, that I’m in love with you. I know we’ve never talked about it, but we’ve both said it, we’ve both heard it.” John finally looking at Sherlock again. “Stop pushing me away, it’s not going to change that I’m joining the Army. But it’s not forever, I’ll have leave, and eventually I won’t re-enlist, and we can be together for good.” His arms moving to hold Sherlock.
“My long con,” Sherlock explained, moving so he was once again on his side facing John. “I paid Sebastian to rough me up a little so I could play the victim, thereby getting your attention, and eventually win your favor.”
“I don’t know what to tell you, Sherlock, I don’t have anything for you.” Lestrade sighed, massaging his temples.
“God, I love you,” he breathed, and lifted himself up on to his knees before carefully lowering himself back down onto John, slowly taking his husband into his body inch by glorious inch. “
“I would have thought it was obvious you need your biceps and triceps for that kind of motion.” Maybe the second lesson wasn’t going so well after all, John could feel the first pinpricks of a headache coming on.
Sherlock looked up from the round table where he was currently sat, to find John looking stunning in his new suit, standing before him.
John seemed to pick up on Sherlock distracted state, shifting slightly to put a bit of space between them.
“Fate? Really John, you can’t be serious.” Sherlock said, sitting up and fighting back a blush. “No, I mean we still would have run into each other at the library that day. You still would have been nosy and pushy, and insisted on ‘helping’ me. It’s in your nature. Being a TA just made it easier.”
“Really, because I’m pretty sure telling someone you only used them for a physically release puts a damper on any plans for a future relationship.”
“Hey, hey! Are you alright?” John asked turning back to follow the kid into the library. He never could ignore someone in need. The kid didn’t seem to hear him – or chose to ignore him – and John watched as a head of messy dark curls hurry to duck into an empty study carrel. He had about six inches on John, but thanks to a lifetime of football training, it didn’t take John long to catch up to him.
“You don’t have to get me anything. Like I said, it’s nothing much. It just reminded me of you. It’s not even really a Christmas present, if I had found it in April, I’d have given it to you then. The timing was just convenient for the holiday.”
“With the key.” John laughed at the look of surprise on Sherlock’s face. Trust him to be expecting some complex scheme. “My flatmate is the student manager for the football team. He has keys to the gym. Sometimes I like to come and train by myself, so I made myself a set.”
“Oh yeah. Yeah, of course. It’s up the stairs and on the right. I haven’t been in there since yesterday.” Finally, the first decent, right thing he’s done, Sherlock thought, and made to follow Lestrade and Evans up the stairs.
On his life, John could not say how exactly they made it to bedroom in one piece, but before he knew it, John found himself stripped naked completely entangled with an equally naked Sherlock, rutting, and panting into his hot, perfect mouth.
“I know she’s a good friend, and I treat her fine. What did she want?” Sherlock asked, as if he didn’t already know.
“That was…” John swallowed once he’d regained his breath, and his senses had finally returned. His body felt loose, relaxed… he felt amazing.
Sherlock was just finishing off an email to a Miss Melody Kingston, informing her that the young woman seemingly following her, was actually her biological half-sister hoping to connect, when he heard it, a voice he hadn’t heard in years. It was a voice he had hoped he would never hear again.
It may not have been a date, but that didn’t mean Sherlock couldn’t still put his best foot forward.
“The lone non-idiot, that’d be me. But you can call me Greg.” Lestrade – Greg – said, offering John his hand. “This one here is always mumbling under his breath about how ‘John might like this’ or ‘maybe John will think this is interesting.’ If I’m being honest, I was starting to think he’d made up PA to keep track of all this thoughts.”
“Well you told me to rotate my palm towards your hand! How else am I supposed to rotate my palm if not with my wrist!?”
So distracted was John by keeping his thoughts and body under control, that he let his hold loosen and Sherlock was able to turn out of his grasp. The next thing John knew, his legs were out from under him, and he was flat on his back, pinned to the ground by his wrists with Sherlock straddling his waist and looming over him.
“Right, of course.” Sherlock cleared his throat, trying to regain a bit of his composure. “You clearly played an important role in this couple’s relationship. You should be there.”
Sherlock tuned out after that, thinking instead about what he was going to say to John, how he was going to apologize, and the sound of the women’s conversation soon faded away.
The food arrived – from the Indian place with the garlic and onion naan Sherlock liked – and by the time they had eaten, it looked like the tablets had started to take effect. Sherlock was more relaxed, his jaw had come unclenched at least, however, John didn’t fail to notice him wincing and clutching his thigh every time he moved his leg.
Sherlock grinned. “It’s what I do,” he hummed, and as John pressed their lips together, Sherlock could feel a few drops of moisture hit his cheek. Whether they were from John or him, he didn’t know. Probably both. It didn’t matter.
“He’s still alive, Sherlock. John’s alive, but he needs medical attention immediately. You have to let go.”
They make it back to John’s flat in record time. Slumped against the wall, attempting to catch their breath, the two begin to giggle
To say that Sherlock found it difficult to concentrate on anything other than fresh from a run John – collapsed in his chair, or standing before the open refrigerator drinking a bottle of water, or doing anything really – would have been a gross understatement. In those moments, Sherlock wanted to abandon whatever experiment or case he had before him, and simply pull John on top of him, or press John up against the nearest wall, bury his face just under John’s jaw, and just… Honestly, sometimes he hated John for reawakening his long dormant libido.
“Well, he…” John paused, “he didn’t know me before, he only knows who I am now. Not that there’s anything in my past that needs to be kept secret or anything,” he added quickly.
And then he was staring into those beautiful, unfathomable, indescribable eyes he loved so much; eyes so bright, eyes that John feared he’d never see again. Sherlock was staring back at him with a look so similar to that night almost two years ago – with trepidation and hope – that John could feel a lump forming in his throat. Sherlock had come back to him, and this time around John was going to make sure that, no matter what, he would stay by his side… forever.
“Well, I wouldn’t say no to millions of pounds. But yeah, I’ve always wanted to be a doctor. I want to do more with my life, you know.”
“I appreciate that very much. And did Sherlock explain to you what he was doing at the school?” Mr. Holmes asked, looking down to give Sherlock a small reassuring smile.
“Good. Go change your clothes and I’ll call Angelo to tell him we’re coming.” Sherlock said with an almost dismissive wave.
“Shhhh, Shhh. You’re going to be alright. Everything’s going to be alright.” Hummed Sherlock. Tears ran down his face as he began to rock slowly, planting kisses on John’s damp crown.
Apologies for the slight delay posting this chapter, I have company staying with me for the next few days, so getting the time to edit and post was difficult. But I've made you wait long enough, here's all the sappy fluff I promised!
“Well yes,” Sherlock smirked, lifting his wine glass up to his lips once more, “but that is only because I helped him put up shelves.”
The very first thing Heather did upon entering the flat, was give Sherlock a quick hello and immediately take his crutches away. She meant business, that was one check in the pro column. Working for Mycroft, however, was still a missive check in the con.
God, what the hell had he been thinking? He didn’t do this kind of stuff anymore. Then again, for the last three years he hadn’t really had the need to, not since… but that all changed. Christ, he felt pathetic, he hadn’t come out to mope and be maudlin about what was lost. It was the start of a new year – for both the calendar and for himself – and he was going to forget the past. And while he knew he couldn’t delete it, he would certainly try to put it behind him. That was what tonight was about, finding a distraction so that he could finally start putting the past behind him, where it belonged.
“Then would you care to dance?” Sherlock asked, his deep voice triggering something deep in John. “And I should point out; it’s very rare that I am the one asking for a dance.”
“I do know that, John. I work with the police, remember.” Shaky start, but his confidence was returning. Sherlock had this, John Watson was not going to trip him up again.
“Good, that’s good.” Mrs. Holmes nodded, already heading towards their car. Sherlock suspected she was pleased he wanted to go to a secure government building where there were more eyes to watch him, and she’s have his father for back up. “Do you want to let the team know?”
Sherlock imagined John standing before him at the foot of the bed. Imaginary John’s eyes blazed with the same want that consumed Sherlock, and slowly Sherlock undressed him, one article of clothing at a time. The jacket was the first to go, falling in a heap as Sherlock slowly ran his hands up John’s arms, feeling the firm muscles through his shirt sleeves. Then came the waistcoat, unbuttoned and still hanging off of John’s broad shoulders when Sherlock started working at shirt. The shirt and waistcoat soon joined the jacket on the floor, and Sherlock dropped his head, kissing, licking, nipping, at John’s exposed chest. John tangled his hands in Sherlock’s hair, letting out a deep moan when Sherlock mapped out the topography of his scar with his fingers and then tongue. Finally, Sherlock undid John’s flies, before pushing down his trousers – there were no pants in this fantasy – allowing the now naked John to pin him to the bed and take anything and everything he wanted. The imaginary John was just the right balance of gentle and forceful; he took, claimed, owned every inch of Sherlock’s body. John, a living dichotomy of soft and hard, sliding against and into Sherlock, kissing away Sherlock’s cries and moans. It wasn’t long before Sherlock came with a choked sob as he was suddenly left alone in an empty bed with only the cold realization that he would never have anything more than the fantasy of a John who wanted him, a John who could love him the way he loved John.
Sherlock is spot on with his predictions, and is progressing beautifully through his recovery, but could something else be progressing as well?
“Oi!” John laughed, flicking a piece of beef at him. “We don’t all need to come in first all the time to prove that we’re clever.”
They grind against each other for what feels like hours, but is most likely only minutes, before Sherlock hands slip into John’s pants, starting to pull them down.
John snorted. “There’s gullible and then there’s believing that a secret society of red-heads exists, and by helping them archive ‘ginger history’, he could get a date with that actress from those galaxy superhero movies.”
“John.” It was more of a breath than anything else, but John thought his name never sounded more beautiful.
“John, shut up for a second.” If John was saying what Sherlock thought he was saying – hoped he was saying – it would change everything. He had to know. “You planned on… I’m going to Sherborne?”
Carrows wasn’t the biggest gym on campus, but it was the one John and the rest of the football team favored. And with a small room off the main workout area with wall-to-wall mats, Carrows was perfect for what he and Sherlock needed.
“You ask me a question, then get lost in your head.” John sighed, chuckling to himself. “I said it would be fantastic. I’d love to come along.” He grinned.
Normally Sherlock enjoyed the silence of others, far less risk of his brain cells committing suicide, but the silence that followed John taking a seat was unbearable. Sherlock could feel John looking at him, could hear him thinking. He wasn’t used to this. On the few occasions he brought someone home – or rarer still, when he went home with someone – they never did the ‘morning after’ thing. Usually the person left once the deed was done, or slipped out with a few parting words the next morning. Now nature had decided to turn on him, and he was trapped in his flat for an unknown period of time with an unknown variable. This was why he so rarely indulged his transport.
“I know, but then months later that same someone kissed me, only to then tell me the next morning that he wasn’t thinking clearly and we should just forget every that happened.”
“Yeah, the surgery when well, and he’s in the recovery room now. Sherlock wanted to be there with him, but the staff said no. Richard went over there a bit ago to eavesdrop; he’s still out of it, but stable. So they should be bringing him here any minute now.”
No, football players, rugby player, the well liked ‘popular’ crowd, they were all the same. Whatever John was playing at – and he had to have some ulterior motive, lulling him into a false sense of security maybe – Sherlock wasn’t going to go along with it. No matter how much he might have wished John’s attentions were genuine, Sherlock wasn’t an idiot, and he wasn’t going to be made a fool of.
“Comfy?” he asked, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s waist, and one of Sherlock’s around his shoulders to keep the lanky lug from falling off.
The truth was Sherlock was completely lost the second John kissed him back that night in the park. John was in complete control of the relationship, Sherlock knew it, Moriarty certainly knew it; there was no point in hiding it, no point in not acknowledging it.
“Of course I do, that’s why I want to go. I can do a lot of good over there.” John says, trying to calm Sherlock down.
‘Just the place’ turned out to be a little Italian restaurant about midway between campus and John’s flat, and the owner, Angelo, absolutely adored Sherlock. Angelo practically made camp at their table for a full five minutes, recounting how Sherlock had caught the vandals who had been defacing the restaurant and driving away customers. After he finished singing every one of Sherlock’s praises, he then moved on to gushing over John, so pleased to be meeting ‘
The second week of in-home daily physical therapy went even better than the first. Not only could he feel himself getting stronger and more coordinated – still couldn’t walk unaided though – but Sherlock also had fresh tissue samples and case files to occupy him during the daily downtime between sessions. Most importantly though, he found he had John on hand to help out, and off whom to bounce thoughts, ideas, and theories. Unlike the skull, John took an active interest in the cases – not so much the organ charring experiment – which was possibly the greatest help of all. So with the case files, John, and experiments, that second week flew by, and just as he predicted, Sherlock completed ‘Stage Two’ of his recovery by his second Saturday home. At the rate he was going, he was sure to be back to near normal condition within another two weeks. He’d probably have a bit of a limp for a while, but that was hardly anything to get too concerned over.
“You’re not,” Sherlock shrugged, “but you are the only one who works at Gallen Family Medical, and has a sister named Harriet.”
“Yes. If you’re not interested, it’s fine. I… I understand.” Sherlock’s words were rushed. Of course John wouldn’t want to come along. He had a real life putting his medical knowledge to practical use. John may have liked hearing about Sherlock’s cases, but seeing them first hand was an entirely different story. Not everyone found a fresh crime scene as thrilling as he did. John wasn’t like him, John was normal.
“You know what we should do now?” John said once the laughter eventually died down, turning on his side to face Sherlock.
“Just humor me, Sherlock. A few more days aren’t going to kill you.” John could feel a headache coming on. Forget grey by twenty-five, he’d be grey by twenty-one in a half. He might actually be dead by twenty-five. And Mike’s amused snickering from the living room wasn’t helping matters.
with you now or in the future. Even if I felt even a sliver of any sort of attraction, and trust me, I don’t, I just told you that I have a partner – a boyfriend – with whom I am more than happy.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, John couldn’t actually be pretending that he didn’t know men could find him attractive. It wasn’t like John was asymmetrical or something; his features were kind of… nice. It could be said that John was… appealing, to a certain extent.
John felt about fifty pounds lighter. “Of course. You’re way, always your way.” It was a struggle to keep his voice level, he wanted to cheer.
“Occasionally, rarely, but it’s been known to happen. Especially where you’re concerned,” Sherlock mumbled, feeling his cheeks flush. “So when you showed me the pictures of the hall and the dance floor, it’s because you want to…”
“Oh yes, simple as that.” John chuckled, it looked as though he needed to get specific. “But fine, let me re-phrase. Is there a restaurant owner in central London, whose establishment you frequent, who hasn’t been involved in some capacity in one of your cases, or a case with which you’ve tangentially been involved?”
If just being in the club made John feel out of place, it was nothing compared to being on the dance floor. It was crowded, enough so that there was only about a foot between John and Sherlock, and the number of people made everything that much warmer, that much more… humid. John hadn’t been lying when he said he wasn’t a dancer, even before the army he never felt at home on the dance floor, but now he felt stiff and awkward. Sherlock however, all confusion gone, looked completely in his element.
“Yeah, but this one has a hood. It’s pretty chilly out there and your hair is still damp. You’ll catch a cold.”
Because navigating the stairs was too much of a hassle for Sherlock, and because he just didn’t want to get up from his seat, John had to go and show Heather upstairs. Unfortunately, that’s where his assistance ended. Yes, Sherlock had told him over and over that he didn’t need any help, but it would have been nice if John had stuck around. Instead John left them be – more of that privacy nonsense – and went to his old bedsit to pack the rest of his belongings, and settle everything with his old landlord. It had to be done of course, and the sooner John rid himself of the old flat the better, but it still meant Sherlock was left alone with this new physical therapist, when he’d really rather not have been.
The past three months had been the best of Sherlock’s life, and to cap it all off, John had finally agreed to give up his crappy little bedsit – he hardly used it anymore – and move into Baker Street, move in with Sherlock. That’s what the gathering was about, a ‘house warming’ of sorts. It didn’t matter that Sherlock was staying put and John was the only one moving, or that they’d all but lived together for a while already, it was official now, they were official. What they had was real – not some fling, anomaly, or flash in the pan – and Sherlock felt such an occasion deserved to be marked in some way. He fought the good fight, but sentiment won out in the end. He was blissfully happy, and that was all down to John. And if that wasn’t something their closest acquaintances – friends – should know, Sherlock didn’t know what was.
“Oh of course, we did them a favor. You didn’t have anything else on your mind, other than helping out Scotland Yard.”
“You don’t look half bad yourself.” Sherlock said, turning around and taking in John’s pressed trousers, blue button up, and blazer. “Though I think I still prefer the jeans and jumper look on you.”
“You might want to call your girlfriend, she seems to need to get in touch with you. Does that clear it up?”
The hours ticked by, and the conversation continued to flow. The crushing boredom from that morning became a distant memory. Not even the occasional poking and prodding by his doctor and nurses could dampen Sherlock’s mood. When it was time for a check, John would simply get up and give them some space, only to return and pick up the conversation where it left off.
“Hmm? Oh, yes, I’m DI Lestrade.” Ah, a detective inspector, probably the man in charge of the investigation. “How can I help?”
Sometime later, Sherlock came too in the cell, again with John looking down at him. Truth be told, it wasn’t a horrible way to wake up, throbbing headache aside.
“Your entire forearm has to rotate.” John sighed. “You want your elbow to pop outwards. That should give you enough force that when you snap your arm down, it’ll break your attacker’s grip.”
“Because nobody deserves to be treated this way. And I don’t know,” John said with a shrug, “I like you.”
Sherlock had barely managed to get to his feet, pulling John up next to him, when Seb burst through the door, gun poised, his entire body tense.
It took him an embarrassingly long time – or an embarrassingly long time by his standards, in reality it was twenty seconds at the most – to realize they stood there, arms wrapped around each other, for far longer than a normal thank you or congratulatory hug should last between friends. Reluctantly he let his arms fall and Sherlock took a hesitant step back from John.
“Alright lovebirds, enough with the muttering and flirting, there will be plenty of time for that later.” Came Lestrade’s voice, breaking John out of his little Sherlock Holmes bubble. “Aren’t we here to be celebrating John’s move?!”
“Yes we do, but you were caught breaking and entering. I think it’s necessary.” The tired officer sighed.
“It is! I can’t wait until the first birthdays!” John really liked to talk, Sherlock thought. Well, that wouldn’t last long, it was only a matter of time before he’d realize what kind of person Sherlock was, and would want nothing more to do with the freaky little kid who knew too much for his own good. Still, it was kind of nice having someone be nice to him for the time being.
Not thirteen minutes after setting off, the cab pulled up to the curb outside of 221 Baker Street. Not bothering to wait for the cab to stop completely, Sherlock tossed the driver double the fare as he promised, and hurried through the front door. Standing in the foyer, Sherlock could hear the sound of muffled conversation coming from upstairs in the flat. Well, at least they hadn’t left already, he hadn’t missed them entirely, Sherlock thought as he made his way up to the flat.
Sighing heavily, Sherlock slipped out of bed and padded into the sitting room to retrieve his dressing gown from the floor  where it had fallen the night before – he never did know when Mrs. Hudson would decided to pay another visit, and it wouldn’t do for him to be lounging about in the nude. He was just sliding his arm through the last sleeve, when heard a muffled ringing coming from the red chair, John’s chair. Reaching down between the arm and the cushion, his fingers closed around John’s phone, it must have slipped down there sometime last night. Before he could decide whether to take John his phone or not, the ringing stopped, and the phone pinged signaling a missed call. Well, he would just tell John when he got out of the bathroom.
“It’s always nice to be noticed,” John grinned. “But he is a bit too young, and not exactly my type. I’ve tended to go for the taller ones in the past. Ironic, I know”
“Fine,” Sherlock huffed, and struggled to get to his feet, “but know that I’m doing this under protest.”
“Quite good? I’m honored.”John yawned, settling back into the bed, feeling the all too familiar siren call of sleep. At thirty-five, multiple orgasms took a lot out of a man.
Climbing the ladder up to the loft, Sherlock found it just as they last left it, about two weeks worth of dust accumulated; no one had been there recently. Standing in the dusty loft, reality finally caught up, and crashed over Sherlock. He knew it was foolish to believe he’d find John sitting there, safe and sound, just needed a bit of a breather, but he had hoped, oh how he’d hoped. Sherlock didn’t know how long he stood, staring at the empty space, letting his memories, his fears, and his worries wash over him. It was only the sound of footsteps below and a demand to come down, which roused him from his thoughts.
“Can’t today,” John shook his head, “I planned something for us today, and it requires both of us to be fully clothed, and out of this room.”
“Shit.” John grumbled, shifting the box in his arms as he struggled to unlock the door to his building. Honestly, what did they have to pick the building with the most annoying locking system – in order for the door to unlock you had to simultaneously turn both the key and a small lever to the left or else it wouldn’t budge. Did the designer not realize that perhaps people may not have both hands free when unlocking their door? Obviously not.
Sherlock watched as John perused the menu, his brow slightly furrowed in concentration, one side of his lower lip caught between his teeth. Why a list of broth, meat, and vegetable options required so much deliberation, Sherlock wasn’t sure, but he never really did care much about what he ate, so what did he know? The restaurant was family-style anyway, whatever John chose, he would be eating too. Sherlock was more than content just watching and waiting on John to make his final selections.
John raised his eyebrows. “Again? Aren’t you going to be sore?” He asked. Not that he was adverse to the idea; he just didn’t think Sherlock would be up for it so soon.
“Yes. It’s directly over my own room in the flat downstairs. I can hear everything.” Mrs. Hudson hummed. “If I didn’t have ear plugs, I’d be awake half the night due to his pacing and thumping about. That boy just doesn’t know how to settle.”
Had he been alone, Sherlock would surely have declined – as he was sorely tempted to – but John seemed to actually like the idea of eating, so Sherlock found himself sat at his partially cleared off kitchen table while his landlady attempted to get to know his one night stand.
Fun fact, there are a few of my family Christmas traditions thrown into this chapter. We don't decorate the tree until the 24th, and every Christmas morning my mom decorates the yard (the pipe cleaner village, trolls vs aliens battle, and orange pyramids were all real)
Don't you just love how stupid and oblivious they are? Each pining without the realizing the other is in exactly that same boat. I know I do!
It had been an hour since Sherlock had been taken back to see a doctor – the A&E was blessedly uncrowded so he was taken almost immediately after John helped him through the door – and John was left sat in the waiting room with nothing to do but dwell on Sherlock’s condition. It took his breath away, it physically pained him, when he opened Sherlock’s door to see him like that. It took everything within him not to cry. Sherlock was lying on his bed; he still wore the track bottoms and John’s borrowed sweatshirt from the night before, which were now covered in dirt and something that looked very much like dried blood. His face was a mass of bruises, his left eye almost swollen shut, and those lips that only twelve hours before John had been worshiping, were split and bloodied. Sherlock’s hands showed signs of defensive injuries, and the way he struggled to move and winced while breathing, John could only imagine what other damage was being hidden underneath clothing. John felt absolutely sick. He had to do something, he had to make everything right. Whether Sherlock wanted him to or not, John was going to make those three bastards pay for what they’d done, but that could wait. For now, John had to be there for Sherlock, he had to make sure he was going to be alright. Sherlock had to be alright. If anything happened to Sherlock, if he…
“I mean, it’s not as exciting as going off to be an army doctor, but the idea of my last year of University is pretty exciting. For me at least,” Molly says
Before John can respond, Molly arrives, and Greg quickly drops the subject, ending the conversation. When John gets back from the bathroom, he sees the couple sitting with their heads together, thankfully neither brings up the topic, but from Molly’s tight smile, he can guess she knows. Later, John can’t really say he remembers what they all talked about at lunch, his head a bit preoccupied.
“Alright, alright, I get it. You’re not interested, no need to make me feel like an idiot.” John said, moving to stand up from their table. “Just do me a favor, and just be careful, alright?”
“I heard you last night.” John continued, his hold loosening. “If you said it in the heat of the moment, I – I understand, you can just –”
“No, Sherlock, listen; I know you wouldn’t tell me before, but they’ve escalated. You got lucky, but the damage could have so been much worse. I want to know who did this, I want their names.”
“It’s not that, you know how much I love having sex with you. Being with you, well it’s one of my favorite pastimes.”
“It’s not too bad outside now; we could brave the cold and go get something.” John said, slouching to stay at Sherlock’s eye level. “It’ll be my treat. Think of it as a thank you for being such a charming host.”
“Whoa! Easy there, Tiger.” John laughed. “I really enjoy kissing you, so I’d like to maintain feeling in my lips!”
“I was asking if we have all the stuff we need for tomorrow, but never mind that now. You’re acting off, is something wrong?” John asked, his brow furrowing.
“Oh you’re a bad man, Sherlock Holmes. Where did that shy guy I met a year ago, go? The one who couldn’t believe someone could like him.”
Sherlock, it was wrong, it was inappropriate. For one thing, he was Sherlock’s TA, and for another he was Sherlock’s friend and Sherlock wasn’t interested in that kind of stuff. He was meant to be helping him, teaching him how to protect himself. Sherlock was trusting him – and Sherlock’s trust was hard won – John couldn’t be objectifying him, lusting after him, John couldn’t allow himself to take advantage of that trust. But still John desperately wanted him. Whether he was with him or not, there was hardly an hour in the day that went by that John didn’t think about Sherlock. And it only got worse at night, at night there were no distractions. John would lay in bed replaying conversations, reliving even the most minuscule things they’d done together, imagining what they could do – what he wanted to do. Countless nights John spent thinking about how Sherlock’s body felt pressed up against him during their training, or those times in his office when Sherlock would lean over his shoulder or sat on his desk. Countless nights he had to keep his fist in his mouth to keep himself from screaming Sherlock’s name as he imagined backing Sherlock up against the wall, Sherlock’s long legs wrapped around his waist. He imagined pulling Sherlock off the desk and into his lap, or pushing him back flat onto the desk. Night after night he imagined himself ravishing Sherlock as Sherlock moaned for more and called out John’s name. It was wrong, it was inappropriate, and he vowed to never act on his growing feelings, but dear god did John want Sherlock Holmes.
Well, I'm sure you know the drill by now, I love comments and/or corrections like a mother loves her children.
Sherlock shook his head, his eyes still closed, his breathing still labored. “Nothing… nothing’s wrong,” he replied, moving forward to try to kiss John again.
“Probably not, but you might. Going through it start to finish might spark something. The brain’s funny like that.”
Next up, The search is finally over and they're FINALLY reunited, though maybe not in the best of circumstances. But where's the fun in making things easy.
“Finally, a sensible birthday activity!” John grinned and pulled Sherlock to his feet and towards a row of cabs.
“Oh I think tea is going to have to wait.” Sherlock smirked, rolling his hips and grinding himself against John through the cotton and silk of their pants. When the hell had the even put their pants back on? Why the hell had they even bothered? “I love you, John, and right now you and I need to see if morning sex is all it’s cracked up to be.”
John didn’t wait for the end of the sentence to wrap his arms around Sherlock’s waist and back, and kissed him with such enthusiasm that he lifted Sherlock off his feet. Their chests held flush against each other’s, John could feel Sherlock’s heart beating in perfect sync with his. Even the sound of friends and family clapping around them, couldn’t distract John from the feeling of Sherlock’s lips parting and moving against and with his. Yep, he could definitely get used to kissing a married man.
“But what?” Sherlock frowned, silently praying John hadn’t come to his senses and realized what a bad idea this all had been, what a bad idea Sherlock was.
John huffed out a laugh and gave Sherlock a half-hearted shove. “Oh very funny. I know I’m short, but I’m not that short. And my feet are definitely not hairy!”
John blushed even harder, he had to get his juvenile mind out of the gutter. Sherlock didn’t mean it like that, he told to himself, Sherlock didn’t mean it like that.
“No, no waiting,” moaned Sherlock, breaking the weak hold on his wrist to fumble at John’s belt and zip. “You stopped us before, for dinner. You can’t – you can’t stop us again. You can’t make me wait a second longer.”
Still barely able to wrap his head around what he’d just witnessed – Theo, the man who almost broke him, getting his arse summarily handed to him by John, the man who proved he never needed to be fixed – Sherlock could only nod when John told him he was going to go apologize to the staff for the little scene, but he’d be right back, and dropped a quick kiss to Sherlock’s lips. How? How on earth had Sherlock earned the care and loyalty of a man as amazing as John Watson? What cosmic mix up occurred that lead to John Watson choosing him? Because it had to be a mistake, Sherlock definitely didn’t deserve John. Saint didn’t deserve John, let alone him.
Sherlock just hummed, burrowing a bit deeper into his mother’s embrace. He’d sooner cut out his own tongue than admit it, but having his mother with him, holding him, willing to drop everything to support him, did more for him than he could put into words. Then again, expressing gratitude and emotions were never his strong suit.
“Alright, well as I was saying, William thought grade two looked way more fun, so he decided to skip right on up to join us!” the cheery teacher continued, turning back to the class. She seemed nice enough, she kind of reminded him of his mummy the way she smiled at him. “Is there anything you want to tell us about yourself, William?”
Sherlock paused for a moment to take a deep breath; it was now or never. “I’ve been thinking about my work.” He said, putting his computer on the floor to face John again. “More specifically, in the course of my work, I have found that a working knowledge of modern medicine and medical practices would invaluable.”
John honestly didn’t know what made him do it, possibly fear of losing Sherlock, mixed with the overwhelming relief of knowing he was safe. Seeing just how invigorated and alive he looked; the pink hue from the chase still coloring his cheeks, the small hint of a confused and concerned smile on his face, definitely played a part. It was all too much, Sherlock, the proximity, everything was too much, and before he knew it, John had the lapel of Sherlock’s coat clutched in his fist, and his lips were pressed firmly against Sherlock’s, cutting off the rest of the detective’s questions with a bruising kiss.
“It seems like an awfully huge risk selling the necklace so quickly,” John said from where he was slumped down in his seat, his body angled so his head rested between the window and the headrest. As a result, his knees brushed Sherlock’s, and their feet overlapped. Fortunately, he didn’t seem to notice, nor did he notice the small contented smile on Sherlock’s face from the contact.
“Fine fine. Nothing gets by you.” The man chuckled. “Like I said in my text, everything of actual value was…” he paused when he finally looked up and, looking past Sherlock, spotted John. “Uh I’m sorry, but… who are you?”
“I know I don’t say it enough,” Sherlock said quietly, “And I should say it every second of every day, but I hope you know… surely you know… you must know,” he was rambling, he had to focus. “When I’m with you, and even when I’m not, even when I just think of you, I am overwhelmed by my exceedingly fond feelings for you, John Watson.”
,” John growled, wrenching one of Sebastian’s arms up even higher. “I’ve been known to have a bit of a temper, and your little friends just ran away. Do you feel that?” he asked, wrenching Sebastian’s arm again. “That’s your axillary nerve, and that’s it being pinched, being damaged. You’re really not in any position to piss me off.”
After an incredibly close call, Sherlock commits to his therapy and to never running the risk of driving John away. Funnily enough, good behavior reaps rewards.

“Hmm…” Sherlock nodded, furrowing his brow as if in deep contemplation; number fourteen on John’s list of favorite Sherlock looks. “I think I’m going to have to disagree with you there”
Sherlock had just started to settle into this new dynamic, the companionable silence of another body in the flat, getting used to John’s presence, almost enjoying it, when Mrs. Hudson decided to poke her head in. She correctly guessed that he had nothing edible in, and took it up herself to
“Oi!” Lestrade said loudly, defusing the building stand-off, “When I said I didn’t want any arguments, that goes for you too, Sherlock.”
Sherlock was positively aglow, proving he was smart, and John couldn’t help but feel it too. “Extraordinary.” He beamed.
Sherlock frowned. Swan’s neck? Did he have a swan’s neck? Isn’t that meant to be a compliment, comparing someone to a swan?
“Don’t flatter yourself. I just mean that when you open your mouth, I don’t immediately want to kill myself.”
By half past nine John was taking a seat at the small table in the front window of Speedy’s café. There was still a half hour before Sherlock was due to arrive – and if he knew Sherlock, he would be walking through the doors at ten o’clock on the dot – but John had awakened early and was too eager for the day to begin. Plus it gave him some extra time to plan for the day, plan for the date. He hadn’t thought about what they could do too much – his brain had been a bit preoccupied with other thoughts the night before – but so much of his and Sherlock’s friendship had been unplanned, their entire relationship was defined by spontaneity, so it would be fitting if their first date was a bit spontaneous. Their first date, his first date with Sherlock, he had a date with Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes and he were going on a date. John had to bite his lip to keep from grinning like the madman he felt like.
Oh God, no. No, no, this couldn’t be happening. “I’m on my way.” John didn’t bother to let the woman finish, and hung up. He didn’t have time for manners, he needed to get to Sherlock.
After a year of bullies, broken ribs, self-defense lesson, getting to know each other and falling in love, Sherlock and John finally found happiness together. The real question is, with such a stressful courtship, can it last?
John noticed the fundamental shift in his relationship – his friendship – with Sherlock after what he privately dubbed ‘The Night’. The night he got to go to a crime scene and Sherlock invited him into his world. The night he finally understood that he would never fully understand how remarkable Sherlock was. The night he finally started to admit – if only to himself – that what he was feeling for Sherlock wasn’t strictly friendly. After ‘The Night’ he and Sherlock seemed to get into sync, their lives just clicked into place.
“Yes. After that I wanted to prove I knew what I was talking about. I began following crime reports, my parents even got me a police scanner.”
“Oh, am I your friend?” Did John want them to be friends? Sherlock couldn’t say he was particularly averse to the idea, it was just… well, he didn’t really expect it.
“That’s the problem. Almost everyone sees but fails to observe.” Sherlock said, allowing himself to preen just a bit. John thought he was amazing, or rather his deductions were amazing. “So I got it right? I don’t usually get everything right.”
John stayed at the clinic for another half hour before finally giving up, and headed home to his perpetually empty, depressing little flat
“You should take that ice off your leg.” He said, coming out of the kitchen with two cups of tea in hand, and two pain pills.
I'm currently at the airport, sitting at my gate with an hour and a half to spare. Might as well give you guys Chapter 4 on schedule! I'm not sure, but I think this is the longest chapter of the fic, and it's the one everyone knew was coming. Hopefully it's got enough of a slight twist on canon, that it's not too much of a snoozefest.
“Why should that matter?” Sherlock asked. Why should it matter if his genius made some people uncomfortable? He
“Uuughh, you’re right.” Mike groaned, “Mum’s probably getting ready to send out a search helicopter as we speak.”
into it.” The Jailers fist connected with his mouth, and John could feel his lip split as it hit against his teeth.
“Ok,” John hummed, his face scrunched up in concentration. It was all an act of course, Sherlock knew John’s actual thinking face. “well ‘Holmes-Watson’ has the alphabetical thing going for it, but…”
The thrusts became faster, harder; Sherlock lifting himself almost completely off John before sinking back down, forcing John in deeper than he thought possible, dragging himself, hard and leaking, against John’s stomach. Their incoherent babble filled the bedroom as they clawed at each other’s bodies, and moaned desperately against each other’s skin. John could feel Sherlock’s muscles start contract around him – they were both barreling towards the edge – when Sherlock repositioned himself, instinctively tightened his thighs around John’s waist, allowing for John to flip them over.
“Oh no, no, no.” Sherlock scoffed, working his way along John’s jaw. “Research of this magnitude requires years’ worth of data collection, decades even.”
“Maybe I’m kind of strange too.” John grinned and shook his head, before sobering a little. “Seriously though, Sherlock, who did I meet?”
“How am I being ridiculous? You’re the crime expert, I shouldn’t have to tell you assault and battery is a crime.”
“How sweet. I can only assume you are referring to the detective inspector and pathologist.” Christ, this man really was watching Sherlock. “I hate to burst the beautiful illusion you’re building of Sherlock, but he only tolerates them so long as they can provide him with the things he wants, cases and corpses. I am the closest thing to a friend Sherlock Holmes is capable of having.”
“Glad I could help. So, um, who is this guy, what did he do? Other than blow up that house, that is?” John asked, his curiosity getting the better of him.
“If I were to hazard a guess,” and Sherlock never guessed, “I’d say our driver has orders to take me home. I can have him drop you off at your place, if you like.” He offered, and oh how he hoped she’d take him up on it.
Fun fact, John's train is supposed to be leaving on June 20th at 2:54 pm, which happens to be my birthday and birth minute (though this is in London, and I was born in PDT). And that's about the most self insert as we'll get.
John couldn’t remember the last time he had enjoyed an afternoon or evening more. Sherlock recounted case after case, everything from a man pretending to be his step-daughter’s online boyfriend, to a nanny hired to unknowing impersonate the family’s willful daughter, to a son framed for his father’s murder. All of it sounded unreal and unbelievable, but the way Sherlock’s eyes shown with excitement, his arms flying about as he spoke, John knew every bit of it was true. The cases were fantastic because Sherlock was fantastic.
From above, the sound of a great commotion; a door crashing open, multiple footsteps hurrying through, people talking, yelling something Sherlock couldn’t make out. Someone –or someones – new, had arrived.
After two – disappointingly – quick demonstrations, John and Sherlock swapped places, and that proved even worse. Short as he was, John still managed to get an arm around Sherlock’s neck, but because of their height different, Sherlock was pressed back against John in a way that he could feel every single contour of John’s chest and abdomen. Distracting, so distracting. And he couldn’t seem to master the quick drop, instead Sherlock ended up sliding – far too slowly – down John’s front. Counterproductive. Not good. Very, very, not good.
I know Sherlock seems a bit OOC in this fic, but I figure he's only 17, and he's had John's humanizing presence for his formative years. Plus even in canon his emotions go haywire when John's involved.
So yeah, drop me some of those precious comments, I'm rather poor, so they're the only think of value I have!
Jacket and gloves on, John made his way down stairs, catching sight of two other doors on the first floor he had failed to notice the night before, and opened the door… to a snowdrift that came up passed his knees. And to make matters worse, the snow was still coming down.
With his late night meal of fish and chips in hand, John settled on the ground, back against the trunk of a tree, and looked out over a quiet pond. After he and Sherlock got their food, Sherlock had all but dragged him to a nearby park. According to Sherlock, while the food was excellent, the ‘dining area’ left much to be desired. John had to agree, and sitting alone in the park with Sherlock, the moonlight illuminating the water (and his dining companion), the light breeze rustling through the trees, sounded much more appealing than sitting on cracked plastic chairs in the fluorescently lit eatery.
, he joked. Molly checked in often; and though she did bring a couple of her friends with her a few times, Sherlock couldn’t really complain too much, she kept them apprised of all the rumors flying, after all.
“Fine.” Sherlock said, taking a deep breath. He really didn’t want to do this. “It started a little after term began. A person down the hall from me in my residence had taken to returning late at night intoxicated, and as a result of his inebriated state, made a lot of noise in doing so. As I do most of my work late at night, it was extremely distracting, and I told him so.”
“Here, drink this.” Dr. Sanderson said, handing cups of tea to both Sherlock and Molly. “Now I’m not even going to bother asking how you knew about the body, I’m just so sorry you had to worry like that. If reception wasn’t such crap down here, I’d have been able to tell you he wasn’t John. You must have been so frightened.”
“But with a sample of John’s writing, it’s very possible that a kidnapper could forge the note. It’s kept short to minimize the chance of error.” Mr. Holmes suggested. “They may not have been aware of John’s injury, which explains why it doesn’t look affected.”
"Yup.” And with that, Harry hung up. Sherlock sighed, he knew she wasn’t going to be of any help, Harry wasn’t going to remember the conversation, let alone to call Sherlock if John showed up, but he had to try.
Life doesn't seem to change for John. He goes to his classes and studies, he does shifts at the hospital, and he goes to football practice. John feels like he has ‘I've shagged a bloke’ tattooed across his forehead, he feels like his body language is positively screaming that he’s now, without a doubt, officially bisexual. Yet no one seems to notice this monumental shift in John’s world, no one except for Greg. When John shows up for football the following Monday afternoon, Greg has only what can be described as a ‘shit eating grin’ spread across his face. If were to see her, John can only assume that Molly would be sporting a similar excited expression. But, all things considered, life goes on as usual for John.
He had fallen asleep; he hadn’t meant to fall asleep. It had been years since he had ‘hooked up’ with a stranger, and now he remembered why he wasn’t a fan. Sure the sex was great, better than great if he were being totally honest, but this right now, the awkwardness of the morning after, the not knowing what to do, that’s what he hated.  Should he leave a note and just sneak out? Should he wait for Sherlock to wake up? Should he wake Sherlock up?
“Oh don’t worry about that. I know a place, the owner keeps a table open for me. Do you like Italian?”
“And that’s lessened the severity, someone being present and being aware of them?” Ella asked, again writing down notes.
John gasped as Sherlock sank down completely. It was better than he imagined; Sherlock was tight, oh so tight, it was bliss. It took every ounce of will power for John to not start thrusting into him immediately, to take him hard, take him fast, and find his release. No, no he couldn’t and wouldn’t do that, as much as he wanted to use Sherlock to get his release, he wanted them to find their release together. He wanted it to last, he wanted it to never end. So John waited, one arm wrapped around Sherlock’s back, the other buried in his curls; he waited for Sherlock to be ready.
“I hate you, do you know that?” Sherlock panted, collapsing onto the bench next to John, “I absolutely hate you.”
“Please, you’ll never take a cab on your own and it will take forever you to get there on the tube or a bus at this hour. I’ll just be stuck waiting around for you there.” Sherlock huffed.  “No, it’s better if we just go together.”
“I… I wanted to apologize for the way I acted.” Sherlock sniffed, lifting his head and looking just over John’s shoulder. “I said things I shouldn’t have, that I didn’t mean, and I never should have touched your phone.”
Fortunately, Jeremy provided surprisingly detailed descriptions of the men who’d approached him, and it took Sherlock one day to identify the intruders, brothers Simon and Jason McCall, both with rather impressive criminal histories. It was another two days before he’d managed to track them down to a small flat in Croydon. From there it was a simple matter of determining their next move, and waiting for them to make it. Eventually that move came, which brought him to be sitting next to John in the back of an unmarked police car at near eight in the evening. They had followed Simon, clearly the brains out of the two, to a warehouse along the banks of the Thames where, if Sherlock was correct – and he was – the sale of the necklace was set to take place.
“Hmmm, yes. I guess some similarities are unavoidable,” the man hummed. “Do you plan to continue your association with Sherlock Holmes?”
Ten points to whoever can tell me from where I stole some of the wording for John and Sherlock’s wedding kiss!!
“Ah. Well in that case, hurry up and heal; I want to get out there and see this battlefield of London of yours.”
No… no, stop. No deductions. He promised himself no more deductions. This was one night, a purely physical distraction for the night, nothing else. He didn’t need to know why, he just needed to enjoy it, to empty his mind, and just
“Wh…wh…what happened to you and I just being a onetime thing?” John gasps as he comes to his senses, and pulls his mouth from Sherlock’s.
“Yes really.” Sherlock sighed, struggling to keep his exasperation under control. “I assure you I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself when I get home, you will need to do nothing more than any other flatmate. But having a medical professional in the house has the added benefit of assuaging any of my brother’s ridiculous concerns.”
“I… ah… I might have gone to the last home game.” Sherlock blushed. Truthfully, he hadn’t missed a single home game all season since that first one John invited him too. In all honesty, it was curiosity that made him stop by in the first place. He wanted to know what was so great about kicking a ball up and down a grassy field that made John devote so much time to it. He still didn’t know what was so great about the game itself, but after seeing John play it, Sherlock couldn’t stay away. John was so coordinated, so powerful, so determined as he ran back and forth across the pitch, it was mesmerizing. Not to mention the uniform and the way John looked in it, especially when he was sweaty and breathing hard from the game.
“Oh God, Sarah, I’m sorry. I’m fine, really.” Well if he didn’t feel like a real jackass. “I’ve just been kind of dwelling on something. I didn’t mean to worry you.”
“Please,” John huffed, “it’s not every day you suggest getting food. I am not going to the one to discourage that kind of behavior. Plus I can make sure you don’t try to sneak off and find some criminal enterprise to dismantle.”
“Oh.” Sherlock turned back to face John, his sulk melted away, “I thought that was fairly obvious. I read the inscription on your phone while it was charging.”
After barely managing to force down bowl of chicken soup and a couple slices of thick bread, Sherlock lay in his bed, wide awake, staring at the ceiling, itching to be out searching the streets. Refusing to let himself think about where John might be, what he might be going through at the moment, Sherlock found his mind wondering back to the previous evening, when he last saw John.
“There’s a pretty decent sized dance floor,” John said, bringing the computer over to where Sherlock was sat on the sofa. “Might even be able to put those dance lessons you gave me, to good use.”
