The ride was silent. Tony was pensive, leaning on the other side of the huge car, looking out the window. His smile gone. Steve was leaning against the opposite door, glancing at him surreptitiously. He was nervous, the atmosphere somehow tense between them. He pinched his lips and licked them while rubbing his clammy hands on his thighs. He swallowed. "Why did you follow me?"
with Loki?" He asked angrily, tone overly protective. What was his deal, anyway? He and Clint had been doing drugs for
Steve whined again. No-one commented.
Tony started with his balls first, licking them and rolling his tongue around them, catching them into his mouth. His hands were clutching his hips as if his life depended on it. The moist warmth of his mouth gave Steve's shivers down his spine. He gasped and started panting hard, his lungs were almost hurting him. Then Tony grabbed the bottom of his shaft with his jaw, teeth grazing and scratching the skin. He pressed them harder into the skin, purposely hurting him, and Steve let out a plaintive cry. Pain rushing to his brain and mingling with pleasure and desire. He wanted, so fucking much, and started giving thrusts with his hips, seeking more of Tony's mouth.
"That's exactly what I meant them to say."
"And we met for coffee, you came at the shop. When was that? Seven? Eight months ago?"
He brought shaky hands to the man's pants and unbuckled his belt with unsure fingers. He looked up and the satisfied smug on Obie's face told Tony he was doing the right thing so he kept on and tugged on his underwear. The briefs slid down the man's thighs, giving off a nauseating smell. Tony was a little repelled at first but opened his mouth anyway. It was far from the worst thing that had ever been into his mouth. Besides, his tongue knew the shape perfectly well, every vein, every nerve. His mouth had grown up around that cock, giving it tentative lapping at the beginning until he was able to swallow it down his throat without gagging.
"No, I—I didn't..." Tony stutters, hand shaking against the burning, wanting skin of the omega who is kneeling at his feet still. "I never said that."
"To the realtor." Steve answered casually as he shrugged, focused on what he was typing.
Tony laughed when he realized Steve hadn't even taken anything from his bathroom when he moved out and there were still all of his cleaning products there, probably expired by now. He didn't have much though, emptying the bathroom didn't take long. The next step was his art studio in which Tony had spent a few weeks in when he stayed over at Steve's. That was the biggest task at hand so far. Steve had too much stuff lying around that he had never taken the time to sort out during all those years. He probably even had unopened boxes from when he first moved in seven years ago. The prospect already gave him a headache.
"Sure." Steve said and smiled back while he took a sip of his latte. Somehow it felt good being there with Tony. It felt
Stark's smile faded but left a burning trail on Steve's lips. He brought the tip of his fingers to his mouth and brushed them softly, imagining. Steve had a wild imagination for someone who knew so little and Stark's eyes were too intense, warm and dangerous. Almost ten yards separated them now and Steve still felt the warmth of his body and the burn of his stare, lulled by his lingering scent.
Steve grinned, eyes mischievous and full of intent. He grabbed Tony's thighs right above the insides of his knees and stared intently into his eyes. "Can I take it into my mouth?" He asked, boring his eyes into Tony's, determined to get his explicit consent.
"Well, I guess, love always strikes us unexpectedly." Bucky said while glancing at his husband.
"No, of course not." Steve was sarcastic again and it sounded awful in his voice. "Why would I be? It's not like I had better things to do than roaming around the city at night to come and rescue your shitty self. This is what I do, right? I save the day!"
Okay, that was unexpected. But nice.
Tony moaned softly this time and the sound sent Steve to heaven, resonating in his entire body like an orchestra was playing in there. How could it be so good? Tony's scent spiked, the smell of him mingling with Steve's own, it was overwhelming. Steve let escape a moan and collapsed onto the seat, heart beating so fast it hurt. He spread his legs instinctively. He could feel himself starting to get wet and felt the urge to cry at the beauty of it. So hard in his dress pants he could have torn them. He started humping Tony who stared at him from above, hands on each side of him and eyes intent on him.
the knot inside him as well as his own dick inside the alpha. He doesn't even need to come.
"I guess."
Steve was livid. He huddled behind his boyfriend, grabbing his arm for support. Tony kept flashing his best smile as a protective shield.
Stark Ind. launched the FRIDAY App.
Something like melancholic fondness flashed in Howard's eyes and unsettled Tony for a moment. He had rarely seen that kind of expression on his father's face before. For a moment, Howard's smile was almost gentle. Howard tilted his head on the side and gestured to Tony to come. "Come here, son." He said softly. Tony complied, for lack of a better option. He felt wary though, Howard wasn't inclined to showing affection freely.
"You enjoyed it!" Steve slurred, holding his best friend's mocking stare. "Jerk!"
Steve felt a pang in his chest but ignored it. This was not the time to feel sorry for Stark's sob story. Tony Stark didn't need anyone to feel sorry for him and Steve had already too much on his plate.
"Sure. We agreed on that already. Anything else?"
Obie's face was very close, only inches away, and Tony could smell his foul alcoholic breath when he spoke. "Please what, boy?" He whispered through his teeth, inching closer. He tightened his grip around Tony's neck, strangling him, pressing him against the wall with his strong bulk. Tony wriggled in his hand, trying to find balance, trying to breathe. "You think you can do what you want?"
Steve ran a clammy hand nervously on the nape of his neck, his hair was itching. His heart was racing and accelerating. Why did he have to feel like this? Tony's words inopportunely came back to him
Perhaps that was because they hadn't let the routine of a domestic life suffocate them.
Except he swiveled, turning his back to him, and glided down the stool. He left and came back with two wine glasses and a bottle of red that Steve watched him open bemusedly, eyes lingering on the muscles of his naked arms, speechless. Steve was still bewildered when Tony handed him a glass with a mischievous smile. "To us." He whispered softly while holding his own glass to Steve and sipped a first swig, eyes never letting go of him. Then he took his fork and uttered a sexy "bon appetite" just before shoving a first mouthful in his mouth.
That's the thing with Stark. He may be a freaking genius capable of creating new elements and crazy apocalyptic AI but he's completely oblivious to whatever is in front of him. He has always been, sadly. He's probably never realized just how strong he is. He's never realized that a whole pack has formed under his protective aura, despite himself. He's never realized he met his soul mate. He's completely oblivious and hasn't got a clue. It's infuriating.
"I didn't mean it as a bad thing though."
Fuck, why did Steve have to come and rescue him again? Tony wasn't worth it. He should let him snuff it in a ditch. Now he had made everything worse. He was forcing Tony to make decisions and Tony wasn't in the right state to make decisions.
"Who's Peggy?" Sam asked, just as interested.
Tony laughed and rolled his eyes. His grin was nauseatingly victorious.
Tony dropped his head in his hand and brought the cigarette to his lips, it wasn't lit though. He didn't inhale, he put it away and sighed and then he drank from his glass. He put the glass down next to him and swallowed painfully. Steve walked closer to him and pushed his boyfriend's nervous right hand away from his mouth. Tony yanked it away. "Don't fucking touch me!"
Steve watched him wriggle on the bed, body glistening with sweat and spasmodic. Then he returned to his cardboard boxes.
"Your friend reported bleeding. Can you tell us how that happened?"
"Why aren't you going?" Tony asked innocently.
Steve isn't going to pretend he hasn't been depressed about it. When Tony unsurprisingly got accepted at MIT, they celebrated happily, a huge step for him and for all omegas, but parts of Steve had cringed and took the blow with a strained smile. It's not like it wasn't expected. Steve knew, when they started going out, that their relationship was just borrowed time. Tony has always been destined for grander things. Steve will attend English and art courses at Brooklyn college. He will stay home with his Ma and if he's lucky enough, he'll get a job he actually likes doing in the future.
"It's kind of weird how things happened." Natasha explained. "We never planned this. I never thought..."
Life sucked.
"You need to stop coming late, man." Sam said after a blissful silence. "Buck and I are gonna have to escort you to class from now on if we want to keep you alive until the end of the term."
"Don't be so hard on us." Steve said. "You moved everyone to tears with your story." Steve certainly was anyway. He was still shaken about the whole revelation thing.
"You don't
Tony's eyes opened and glimmered. He smiled, like someone up to no good. "I'm so happy to be here," he muttered softly, voice sounding a little too husky for Steve's own good, "finally..."
Steve was the only one Tony could count on. And Steve made him happy. And he wanted to make Steve happy too. He really did.
Tony wakes up from the sound of FRIDAY continuously telling him to do so. Sadly, the battle is still going strong. What he doesn’t expect to see at all is Steve, being a complete badass while using the combined powers of his shield
“We don’t know,” says Steve as he sits down a bit further away from Tony. With his arms crossed, he takes a deep breath. “He just opened a portal and walked through.”
Hilde thinks about the mission she's given herself after the discovery of the unborn Asgardian heir.
“You alright?” he asks the man, though still out of breath. “That was close. I owe you one.” He pats Strange’s arm twice before looking around to search for Peter, who is nowhere on the ground. When suddenly the kid appears from up the ceiling, hanging upside down, Tony realizes he must have jumped up into the air to stop his fall.
Is there more for her to lose? Will she even still be able to live if she does this?
He’s interrupted again as Tony pulls him into another hug. Ignoring all the action around him, he kisses his son on the top of his head and wishes to never let go again. But they’re quickly interrupted by another flying figure passing them by.
us!” Tony doesn’t mean to shout, but he’s feeling a bit nervous all of the sudden.
Steve holds out the shield to Sam.
Tony has been wheeled in by Bruce a little earlier. The others started a few minutes ago, though since no useful information has been shared yet, it seems like they’ve been waiting for the last few members to arrive.
“Only if we don’t do our jobs,” Strange snaps back.
Thanos laughs and lowers his gaze. “I’m thankful. Because now, I know what I must do.”
“Yeah, no. Dr. Zol- No, I haven’t seen a soul.” He also hasn’t seen the chair he accidentally walks up against. “Pardon me.”
“You heard me.” Steve finally looks back at him, trying to gauge his reaction. But Sam looks shocked, surprised, and somehow… emotional. “You don’t like it?”
“Maybe in another life,” he returns. When he pulls away he looks back at Sam one last time. Then he clears his throat and nods. “Right, let’s get going.”
And yeah, not wanting Fury to know about it is just 100% his Dad. Peter’s entire body loosens up and he finally makes the final steps towards him. Without a warning he wraps his arms around Tony, holding him in a strong hug he never thought he’d ever have again. Immediately, Tony leans his head against Peter’s, putting his hand onto Peter’s back as he tries to hold him tighter.
“A certain matter has come to my attention, and I need you to come with me,” the doctor says, low and heavy voice almost resonating through the whole park. What is it with these people with their heavy voices all the time?
Tony doesn’t know what to say. It’s like his mind short-circuited and he needs a reboot or something. He can only just shake his head before kissing his son once again on the top of his head.
He hears T’Challa tell Okoye to stand up. When he tries to pin them down, what he sees is more dust. He quickly looks at Wanda, who is hovering over Vision’s grey, lifeless body. When she starts scattering as well, her eyes meet Steve’s for a moment. Rather than scared, she looks peaceful. Relieved. Steve reaches out for her, but it’s too late.
“That was while we were looking for the staff, wasn’t it?” the super soldier asks. Tony pats him on the top of his head.
“I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of a lake… go to bed.”
“Please, don’t do this.”
She still doesn’t want to stay here for too long, so once Dr. Cho is settled, Hilde returns to the controls while Yaël helps out with Loki’s unconscious form. With no clear destination in mind, Hilde simply starts moving forward. First away from the wreckage. Then further from Earth.
There’s the sound of a finger snapping, simultaneously with Thor’s cry of ‘no’. Wanda closes her eyes, waiting for an imminent explosion or something like that.
But it’s not only the food; it’s the wounds he sustained. While Nebula helped patch him up the moment they got on the ship, he feels himself getting weaker. The only thing that’s keeping him alive must be the last bits of serum he gained through Steve’s liver.
“I don’t-“ he starts. Tony knows how he’s put the shield aside after the whole Thanos-business. He’s feeling like he doesn’t deserve it, as he couldn’t use it to keep the world safe.
“Thanos, he-“ Loki starts. But then his eyes widen even more and he steps forward. “Somebody take Raido from me.”
Despite that they work good together. It’s proven when the two of them manage to throw a car on Big while keeping a well enough distance between them.
“Congratulations,” he says. Then he looks up at Tony. “I’m happy for you.”
Oh, shit, is she alright?! Please, say that Happy picked her up after Tony left!
It had worked, as well. Peter had loosened up, completely. It must have been one of the best days in their lives.
“Yeah, right where I didn’t want you to be,” Tony urges on. “This isn’t Coney Island, this isn’t some field trip. This is a one-way ticket, do you hear me?”
Okay, Tony has had enough of that.
Tony rolls his eyes. He’s dealt with Peter enough to know when to just stop. He puts a hand on Bruce’s shoulder and gently pushes him back.
! Steve’s and mine,” Tony continues. Pepper stares for a second, but then she shakes her head.
“He probably followed his old man and snuck up that spaceship,” Sam admits before gesturing that they’re supposed to keep moving.
And Peter observes the situation for a bit. Tony can see on Peter’s face that his mind is thinking about everything around him, and even quicker than he would have imagined Peter starts nodding.
“Mr. Lord... Star-Lord is fine.” Quill gestures for the others to join, which they eventually do. Tony continues with making up a plan, trying to get that whole thing from just now out of his head.
Today is one of those days that they’re inside, though Vision seems to have chosen to keep up the disguise, mostly due to the fact that he’s walking up to the window and is pulling the curtains open. It’s raining, nearly midnight. And despite the lovely day they’ve been having together, she’s aware of how tense Vision has been the entire time.
Thor grins. “Notice you’ve copied my beard.” Thor gestures to his chin and Steve shrugs when he touches his own facial hair.
That’s what Thor had said about a month before the ship came in.
Natasha can very well remember the first time she did this. The entire battle with the Chitauri had been one thing, but the super-powered being constantly throwing fire and large chunks of rocks her had constantly been putting a damper on her work, and both her and Clint had been getting annoyed at the time.
Oh, right, he’s running. He’s not alone. Tony quickly taps on Pepper’s shoulder, indicating the need for a break. The woman turns towards him, her face looking as red as Tony’s feels, her strawberry blonde hair in a pony tail. Her blue eyes meet with his, and Tony’s a hundred percent sure that she could run five more rounds.
“Not me, not here,” he admits. “If Tony were here, perhaps we would have made it work eventually but… there’s no time for me to start learning this.”
Street. Notify first responders,” Tony says, holding on to the door of a car to make sure that he doesn’t fly away from the wind.
“Huh, MIT. Got a name?”
Trying to get up feels impossible, but Tony still manages to take a couple of steps away as he sees Thanos’ army, and in turn Thanos himself, turn to dust and disappear with the wind. At least, he’s pretty sure that’s what he’s seeing, but his right eye doesn’t seem to give him many signals, anymore. With only his left side remaining, he catches Rhodey on his way up. That’s when Tony drops down and leans back against a piece of what must be a space ship.
“Have we ever known him differently?” he asks. Steve knows they’re only here to make sure that he comes back, but there’s no place Steve would rather be. But there are some things that he needs to do; things that he couldn’t, but can now.
And that’s when Mantis points out that Strange is acting… strange. What are the odds?
“FRI, I know you’re probably busy, but… can you tell me if Peter’s suit is still on Earth?” He can hear Sam take a sharp breath back at the controls of the ship. Natasha just takes Steve’s hand into her own and she gently squeezes his fingers.
Right when she’s preparing herself for another round is when the Avengers decide to show up. And she feels like crying on the spot. Not only out of relief that there’s reinforcement, but also because it means Wanda can catch her breath for a short moment.
Thor’s hair has grown again. Tony sees immediately that he’s gained a bit of a father-figure. He’s more… rounded than he used to be. According to Steve, it’s been like this for a while and Thor’s working on it. Despite being a god, he looks tired. His hair is a mess, and his beard probably a bit too long.
Thanos’ gauntlet looks scorched, the power of it having created large burn marks onto the Titan’s arm.
Tony can’t help but feel a little bit betrayed here. He would have expected Pepper to back him up on this, maybe even chose different kinds of names for the kid. He was already planning on making her godmother, and he was sure Steve was going to make Bucky godfather.
“GO!” he then shouts.
“Congratulations,” Tony says bitterly. “You’re an Avenger now.” Then he walks off, needing a little bit of time to cool off. This sucks big time; if the ship has any form of communication, it doesn’t seem able to make contact to Earth. He can’t reach Steve, he doesn’t know if Pepper’s alright, or Happy, or Rhodey. He doesn’t know if Steve and the others managed to get Wanda and Vision before it was too late.
“Then I would have joined the fight on Earth,” he counters.
Steve looks up, pulled out of his train of thought by his best friend. Bucky gives him a sad smile, but ever since finding him again, all expressions on Bucky’s face seem to have a hint of sadness in them. They’re alone for a moment while the others suit up. Steve should do the same.
“If you consider failure experience,” Thanos calls out, unimpressed by Loki’s words. The God of mischief lets out a small, breathy laugh.
plan.
He finds Steve unconscious a bit away from him. He’s holding the shield in his hand, picked it up a little bit back.
“He is not with us,” she answers.
They all get suited up. It’s an agreement they made, just in case the stones would do something that might bring back the Hulk. They can’t afford any other mistakes. Tony instructs FRIDAY to bring the facility in lockdown. Bruce gently presses his hand against the gauntlet that adapts itself to his size.
So she nods at Yaël, salutes at Dr. Cho who blinks in agreement. Then the first door of the lock is closed, and the other one is opened. Hilde gets sucked out of the ship almost immediately, but the tether holds tightly. Once she’s stabilized a bit, she tests out the thrusters and starts maneuvering through the debris.
Vision lets his hand crawl up until it’s covering Wanda’s on his cheek. Then he takes it between his fingers, kissing the palm of her hand in a gentle manner before lifting it up onto his forehead, covering the glowing yellow stone.
Tony tries to get Strange and the Stone to leave the battle. Sadly, Strange is a crazy son of a bitch who doesn’t listen to people. He does his best to get the two of them away from the wizard. It only gets him thrown around the place, making him end up in the park he had only just left.
Dr. Cho instructs Yaël to lie down onto the cot. Loki stands up but immediately kneels down next to her face. Hilde can’t see what’s happening because she must remain focused on getting out of there.
Thor, in turn, scoffs bitterly. “You know it’s a trap, right?”
“What are you doing up, little mess?” Tony asks.
Tony shakes his head. “I’m fine. Just, long hour.”
There’s some talking, but mostly everybody’s quiet. Probably waiting for it to start. And from the looks of it, Pepper and Peter had been the last ones they were waiting for.
“Something wrong?” Sam asks. Of course he’s worried about why Steve would invite him here without any explanation. Steve didn’t really bother not trying to sound like everything was just fine.
Rocket is the next one, revealing all he knows about the Power Stone they got from Morag, which is a planet. It has some additional typically Rocket-teasing along with it, especially directed towards Scott who seems to be the most oblivious about this all.
They don’t even make it to the first stop. Hilde is only walking through the hallway, passing Thor’s chambers, when suddenly Loki comes scrambling out of the room, face pale and eyes open wide.
It’s not a question. It’s not an order, either, but he also knows that Wanda will listen. She nods, finally looking over at him with a pale face.
Steve is aware of the things she’s been through; of the role Bucky played in her life. His best friend told him during one of his visits, and Steve had been shocked to hear about it. Especially when it came to the matter of Bucky’s daughter.
Big smashes his axe against a car, sending it flying to the side.
It offers him little comfort.
Sure, you get to fly to space, and it’s probably better when you actually get to steer the thing and go where-ever you want, but being a stowaway trying to save an annoying wizard that used to be a neurosurgeon (man, those are just the worst) is
I'm probably a bit too familiar with these sudden thoughts, so I felt like it was better to warn others about it. It's only present in this chapter and the next one.
“Let’s do this.”
“Oh, he’s pissed,” the Raccoon says. “He thinks he failed. Which, of course, he did but you know, there’s a lot of that going around, ain’t there?”
“Then we must get you out. Go with Hilde and Thor. I’ll hold him off with the Hulk for as long as we can.”
She would never tell him, of course. It’s a bit weird to tell a kid like him that she starts to see him as a little brother, or maybe at least a younger cousin. She lets out a small laugh before averting her eyes only slightly. Automatically, they go onto the TV playing behind them. The restaurant they stopped in front of looks empty, the man on the counter leaning back to look at the news reel as well.
Wanda, well, there’s no way to describe her. With given even more control of her powers, Peter’s sure she might have been able to handle the army all on her own. But as she has nobody to teach her, and only herself to figure it all out, she’s not yet come to the powerful stage Peter knows she might one day end up as.
“We… have blood to spare.” The woman holds up her sword, and the enemy’s army starts filling up while Steve, Nat and T’Challa return to the rest of their soldier. The first one to speak up is Bucky, who frowns at the growing army in front of him.
“I thought I told you to go,” Steve points out, though he’s feeling very relieved that Vision was still there.
Tony sighs. “They are SHIELD… well, actually HYDRA, but we didn’t know that yet.” Rumlow and Sitwell take control of the situation, as they put the staff in a large case.
“Dad,” Peter gets out. The sound makes Tony turn to him for a moment, looking at him apologetically. Peter shakes his head, trying his best to stay calm. They’re going to be fine. They’re going to make it out of here.
“Yeah, it’s a great view,” Sam agrees. “But I don’t think the lake is the reason you called me here?”
Thanos notices them approaching him. He’s not even flinching. No, instead he starts monologuing. Again. Why do villains always do that?
“Like it’s someone else’s,” he admits. Steve chuckles.
“Is he under? Don’t let up,” instructs Tony while he pulls onto the hand.
Tony grits his teeth together. He had actually forgotten that it’s probably only the Avengers who would put Peter on the first place. The team would die for him, even though Peter would hate for that to happen. That’s how much they care about him.
“Tony,” Steve says behind Peter to get him back on track.
Good, nobody’s missing. Everybody made it through.
“I meant it, Steve. After we get Peter back, let’s just get married. Let’s retire, and just… be old guys, together.”
Steve
Thanos moves quickly. He exits the ship, leaving Gamora to her own devices in here. Out from the windowshield, she can see him get to the ship, force open the door and enter. Gamora hurries after him. She grabs her knife – the only weapon she holds on her – and grabs a helmet to make the same jump.
He doesn’t know how long he’s busy with it. He tells FRIDAY what to work on, and she does it without question. With the notes Scott left behind on the porch, he tries to dig through anything that might be useful. But, eventually, the night falls and it’s about time to hit the hay for one little girl.
Once it’s time, Natasha smiles with excitement. “See you in a minute,” she jokes towards the four who aren’t coming along with them. Nobody can respond, as they’re all shrunk until they reach the Quantum Realm.
“We can’t,” Steve clarifies, meaning Tony with that. They love Morgan, with all their heart. They would do anything to her, and surely if anything were to happen to the kid they would probably both lose their crap even more than they already have.
She can’t do this. She can’t risk the universe, but she also can’t let her sister suffer even more than she’s already done in her life.
Yaël lets out a strange sound once she notices who it is. Dr. Cho doesn’t let her approach. She instructs Hilde to tear open his upper clothes, which she does without effort. She then listens to his heart, checks his standard parameters. Meanwhile, Hilde looks around for something that will warm him up a bit.
Right when Tony’s about to warn him one last time, Strange speaks up.
“For him? As long as he needs. For us? Five seconds…” He starts pressing some buttons on his device. The technology being too advanced for Steve to even want to know about it, he just looks ahead, casting another glance at his two best friends standing there, almost expecting him to never return.
It’s a tough battle inside himself to keep him from running in his direction. The child inside of him wants to hug the man, and tell him all about his life. But Tony can’t do that, because Mr. Jarvis doesn’t know Tony yet.
“Hey guys, welcome back,” Bruce greets them. Clint simply waves.
“In case you hadn’t read it, I’m in a committed relationship,” Tony starts, holding up his hands in a ‘what will you do about it’-gesture. “I mean, not that I would even take you up on your offer because I just don’t
“No, no, it’s
, Tony remembers. He tries to get back on his feet as fast as he can, but the suit isn’t working with him. Noticing multiple system failures, Tony grunts and tries to work through them. In the background, he can hear Thanos continue the monologue.
“So it’s all hands on deck,” Bruce figures out. “Any more guys we can call? Fantastic Four? X-Men?”
Hilde and Jane get along swimmingly. She’s probably the most normal person around here, and Hilde likes normal. After arriving back to Earth with the intention to find Sif again, she only found out that the woman had disappeared along with many others. New Asgard barely seems like a Kingdom at this point. It’s more of a city. A city with a King that is slowly losing his marbles from being too overprotective a Dad.
That is, until it comes to her attention two months later that Yaël is with child.
“Listen, I need you to make a detour to Scotland, pick up Viz and Wanda,” he starts.
“No. I found it, though.”
“I don’t think this rig has a self-park function,” Tony then states. He looks at the steering-device, seeing two different handles that are too far apart for him to reach by himself. But there’s three of them, so it should be possible. “Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it, you understand?”
“No. I don’t have the equipment for it. She has to wake up on her own,” says the woman that took care of Gamora. On another bed sits someone else, who rubs her head with a scowl on her face.
And that’s that, it’s finally over. Steve looks down at his supply; he still has enough for four trips or so. He can work with that. He quickly sets the date. Not too soon after, but also not too late. Just right.
They need to get back to New York, immediately.
“Wanda, I-“ he starts, only to let out a agonizing shout as he’s lifted off the ground, his human disguise disappearing. That’s when Wanda notices a dark figure standing behind him, some sort of knife sticking out of his abdomen. After a few short seconds, whatever is standing behind Vision is throwing him to the side. The creature that did this turns to face Wanda, and she only takes the one second to be appalled by its appearance before she summons up the energy in her body and tries to direct it into a blow meant for
Is he really doing that?
“And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here, to talk.” Gamora can see him curling his hand into a fist. The purple and blue stone start shining brightly, followed by Nebula’s agonizing cries to fill the room as her disassembled pieces are being pulled apart even more than they already have been.
“I thought you’d be harder to catch,” he says, suddenly taunting the giant. This is not the time! “For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where is Gamora?”
As it turns out, the hit Yaël sustained on her head when they moved from one ship to the other jarred her head once again. Apparently this isn’t the first time she’s lost some memories, but clearly it’s not something she’s growing used to.
“They went back up in space,” Pepper tells him. “Nebula gave them a possible position of where Thanos could be. Thor was feeling very vengeful.”
Hearing the Hulk roaring in the hangar, it’s obvious that Yaël managed to bring him along. She only hopes they haven’t found
“Piece of cake, Quill,” he hears Tony say.
Going through the ‘gardening’ session of his backyard – or is it his front yard? – Tony approaches the little playground Morgan made for herself. There’s this little tent where she’s usually hiding. Seeing the blue drapes getting closer, Tony caps his hands to warn her of his approach.
Inside, he pulls back the suit. He doesn’t feel comfortable inside of it right now.
“Please, don’t do this,” he pleads.
But it seems like she’s not on board. And Tony should have known asking Pepper wasn’t the best idea; she has never been interested in having kids before, after all. She doesn’t understand this need Tony has, this
Nobody’s talking, everybody silent to hear every part Tony has to say. Every bit of the message he felt the need to record with his helmet. The part that FRIDAY warned them was waiting for them to listen to. And all Peter can do is look at his father there; the man who, turns out, has had to live five years without him, five years thinking that he’s dead and won’t ever see him again. And Peter aches all over again, to think of the pain Tony must have felt. It must have been a massive hit on Tony’s already weak mental mind.
“I’m afraid I’m barely presentable. I didn’t sleep with the twins causing chaos wherever they go,” Thor excuses himself as he enters. Tony snorts and shakes his head. Yeah, he’s definitely a parent, now. His clothes are full of stains – probably from the food the kids refuse to eat. He’s wearing sweat pants and sandals, for crying out loud!
“Earth is big, he won’t just find me like that?” Yaël counters, but Hilde feels a burst of anger inside of her and she slams her wrench against the dashboard of the ship, causing for it to power on for some reason. The ship starts whirring, coming to life despite being stuck on the ground.
Thor doesn’t bother to wait. He hurries towards the screen, taps away on it before sighing.
“Glad to see you, too, pa,” Peter breathes out. He realizes it’s the first time he’s ever using that word towards him, but he doesn’t care. It doesn’t matter. It’s true, anyway. Steve’s as much his dad as Tony is at this point.
“Your brother he… he’s not with us. He’s somewhere we can’t reach,” Tony admits. “But Aunt Nat, and your Daddy Steve, they’re trying to bring him back to us.”
“Thanks, but this one’s on me,” Steve assures him. He puts a hand on his shoulder and squeezes it. “Got some loose ends to tie up.”
He takes out the phone, eyes widening when he sees the familiar name on the screen.
“I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.”
“He went offline. They wanted just a week to themselves without any worries. I promised we wouldn’t, you know, call them or anything, so we can’t really reach them.”
Hilde shrugs, pointing upwards. “Probably still up there, if he’s still alive.” She sighs once more, dropping her hand. “Asgard has lost the entire royal family in such a short time span next to their home. I need to make sure that they’re alright.”
“You could never…” she tells him.
Of course she lives. Canon is not going to keep on taking Winterwidow away from me! They didn't even have the balls to give Sebastian Stan what he wanted, the cowards!
That’s just about the closest he can get to it.
“It’s as if it’s speaking to me,” Vision returns, and though it’s not
“Hi, Hilde. I didn’t expect to see you, today?”
“Norway’s got some nice views.” There’s nothing more from her, so Rhodey chuckles and walks back into the room, followed by the others. As they approach the computers Bruce and Clint finally come out of hiding, taking careful steps towards them.
Steve had been surprised after learning that Natasha and Bucky got married in Wakanda in secret. She admitted that she hadn’t wanted to make too big a deal about it. It was just because they needed a little win after sacrificing so much.
Reed Richards and Susan Storm have secluded themselves for a bit. As far as Steve heard, they've had a son a few years back and are now pregnant again with a daughter. Steve hasn't really spoken to any of them since they've returned to Earth, so he has no idea, really.
Tony lets out a loud breath, disbelieving of what he’s hearing. Is his old man
“Unlike everyone else in your life, I don’t work for you,” Strange says lowly. Peter’s about to open his mouth there, but Strange silences him. “You used to work for him, too, your argument is invalid.”
And now, she’s donned one of her own. The woman keeps on bringing more surprises in his life.
Thor laughs. “That sounds perfect.”
“Hey, Peter Parker,” she returns. Her voice sounds pleasant. She must be one of the good guys. That’s great. “You got something for me?”
Well, if you like that baroque-kind of thing. Not really Tony’s style, after all.
Howard guides him in the direction of the elevator. Tony nearly forgets his suitcase in the process.
Thinking back of Howard’s own words, Tony quotes him without hesitation. “No amount of money ever bought a second of time.”
“There’s something happening with the stone. Its radiations are getting off the charts. I don’t know what’s happening.”
too fast.”
“Well, maybe we should be. How about it, huh? After this is over, shall we get hitched?”
By the time he got to Peggy’s funeral, it’s safe to say that he’s grown tired of funerals. He would rather go to a wedding or something, or a baby shower, even. Can’t somebody just get married, for crying out loud? Can’t somebody simply just have a baby?
It stays quiet for a little bit, but eventually Pepper gets up, holding on to Morgan’s hand as she takes the helmet, gently kisses the top of it and then hands it to Steve. The super soldier looks like he’s on the verge of breaking apart when he takes it from her.
powerful, that much is clear. Peter would hate to ever stand opposite of him.
“He’s from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.”
“I don’t wanna hear it!” Tony hisses. Peter ignores him.
Thanos gets the stone. Quill, who must have regained consciousness, tries another attack, but by the time he reaches him, Thanos is already gone.
Steve can’t help but glance at Wanda, whose hand is close to her mouth, her whole body signaling some kind of uncertainty and fear. When she looks back at Vision, there’s something in her eyes, something… conflicted.
Drax adds: “That’s right.” He settles into a stance, facing the other three.
What the Hell?
Finally, his suit allows him to. Tony gets back on his feet, hurrying to the rest. Despite his ache to run straight to Peter, he sticks close to Steve. Thor lands right behind him, and as they face Thanos they can see the hesitation in his eyes. That, right there, is a good feeling.
“There shouldn’t be monsters in the closet,” Pepper mutters back. “Listen, Tony, I love you very much, but trust me when I say that bringing this up to Steve is moving
“Dad, dad,” he calls out, running up to him and immediately dropping on the ground as he grabs on to his shoulder. “Can you hear me, Dad? It’s Peter”
Tony faces the rest of his team
“Hey, Peg,” Steve greets her anyway with a smile.
Steve chuckles at the memory. He hadn’t minded that much; the thing is indestructible so it’s not like she could do anything to it. Listening to Tony, he finally takes over the shield, though that contemplating look on his face clearly shows that he’s still conflicted about the whole thing.
“They didn’t have a ride,” he admits. Tony rolls his eyes, but serves out another plate for Steve.
Uncle Ben’s had been rough. It had mostly been his fault, too. Had he just stopped that robber, then things would have been fine. But he didn’t, and because of that his Uncle died. He barely made it through the funeral without wanting to march out of it, the guilt eating up at him.
“Stark Raving Hazelnuts,” Strange points out.
“You’re right, it looks selfish, indeed,” Hilde mutters out, crossing her arms. She looks back at the bleached-haired girl who looks like she hates the idea of running just as much as Hilde. “What’s the deal here?”
Thanos moves his hand around, and things seem to move around Wanda. She glances at many pieces flying past her. As if they’re being pulled back to somewhere they came from. Following their path, she finds a familiar yellow light, exactly where she last left it.
particle left.
“P-Peter,” he stammers out with all he has. Pepper turns to look at his son, still crying in Rhodey’s arms.
“Mr. Secretary,” Steve greets the man curtly. He doesn’t want to waste much time on him.
“Thor?” Steve asks, though the God of Thunder doesn’t look up. “Where’d he go?”
Now, one would think that going on a holiday with Vision, the only person in their group that stands out the most, would practically make it impossible to have a normal holiday without having thousands of people following them around, but Wanda’s not stupid, and neither is Vision.
“Of course,” she returns. She grabbed enough rations for three. In case they’re running out, Hilde will just have to run an errand on a nearby planet until they can return.
He sighs one more time. He brings up the Quantum suit, holding on to the hammer, the suitcase with all the stones and Loki’s Scepter – they almost forgot about that last one, but luckily Natasha pointed it out quite quickly.
“What I would do to have you back on Earth,” Tony mutters against his hairline. Peter just leans into the touch with his eyes closed.
Steve sighs. He barely reacts when Rhodey puts his hand upon Steve’s shoulder and gives it a gentle squeeze.
But never does he see him. It’s impossible, too, as there are just too many of them here. It’s a literal battlefield; space ships have joined their army – friends from Quill, he suspects – and even more freaking wizards!
“Where’s-?” Steve starts, but clearly he can’t finish his sentence as the words get stuck.
“This is a serious matter, Stark,” Strange urges on. It’s Pepper who pokes Tony in the side.
“You’re here to do your laundry?” she asks in a jokingly manner. It falls flat, but Steve isn’t going to point it out.
Tony listens to Scott’s plan. He knew Hank Pym had been experimenting with Quantum Technology. At one point in his life, Tony would have offered to help him with it. Except now, he just doesn’t care anymore.
Some of the mutant students are trying to keep Xavier’s academy going. Steve has been over to check on them a couple of times, but it’s clear that, even all this time, the students are tired. Everybody’s tired. Everybody’s sad.
She shouldn’t have been surprised to see the familiar faces eventually, but she’s glad they did. New Asgard, while thriving, is probably asking just a little bit too much of Thor’s time in combination of being a parent of three. It’s clear that Jane has it pretty much under control for some reason, but Thor is just too much of a concerned Dad for it to stay healthy.
“Tony, I-“
“Where’d you come from?!” Tony asks a bit more loudly than he wanted.
“Keep your eyes open,” he tells him before boosting up the thrusters and lowering himself down to where Skinny is currently giving a speech. The moment he touches the ground, Skinny turns around, continuing his sentence as if Tony heard any of it.
Scott lang is waving at the camera; He’s standing in front of a brown van, looking like he hasn’t aged a day.
“I think you should better sit down,” he says, pointing towards the seat behind him. Tony obeys, feeling dread all over his body without even having heard anything about it.
“Can you get us home?”
,” says FRIDAY before he can even think of it. Tony’s eyes widen, and his mouth falls open, which makes him drop the candy he’d been chewing on. He can see it right in front of him; 99,987% successful. That’s never happened before, has it?
He knew about his habits, about his tastes. He knew a lot of things: they had spent weeks living together. But it had always been at Steve's place. Or in his parents' house which had never been a home to Tony.
Steve looked down and pinched his lips. "That you won't be able to say no." Tony's eyes flickered and fixated on him. He looked a little pained. Steve felt a pang in his chest. "Tony, I... I'm sorry."
It made him angry too. No-one should be treated like second-class citizens and despite much improvement for the last decade or so, omegas still were. They shared a conniving silence and the moment lingered, both of them watching without really looking at the dance floor.
two omegas. He bonded Steve. And he bonded James. He bonded them both. He thought he couldn't, that he would never be strong enough. He had never thought it would be possible. How can anyone bond two people? Bonding someone is so powerful and so overwhelming already.
Sam and Bucky shrugged. Clint pouted. "Still don't see anything wrong with that." Sam explained, the other two nodding approvingly.
Steve startled. "What?"
"Having heats is a hindrance, you know it as well as I do. We've always hated them..."
Steve was mad though. Real mad.
"I would have helped you."
True.
manufacturing Steve Rogers-shaped smart dildos. The prototypes have been tested and approved by the CEO himself. We have created this new skin-feeling material and they will warm up after you switch them on. The touch is so soft, you're gonna go crazy over them. Take my word for it, this is gonna wreck homes... Oh, sorry, I forgot to mention. They're for my private use only. Sorry ladies. You don't know what you're missing, though." He keeps on while waggling his eyebrows suggestively. "He's
"You're sure it's wise to have another drink now?" He remarked with concern.
Steve was pretty sure that ten years ago it wasn't though but he guessed scent-confusers certainly
It's not enough.
And Steve is sucking the alpha off and Bucky wants... he wants... And the alpha wants it too. He won't just let Bucky do it, he

big."
"Perhaps, but you have the kind of physique that ages well. You're only getting more charms and sex-appeal as years go by, while the only thing I've got is my cute face and that stopped being attractive past 25."
Steve rushed to him and grabbed him into a needy embrace. He held him tight until Tony finally relaxed into his arms, let his head drop on his shoulder and grabbed his hips, curling his fingers in his shirt. Steve's hand was stroking his back comfortingly. He buried his face in the crook of his neck and inhaled his smell with delectation. He hadn't realized how much he had missed his boyfriend. How he had missed him! The embrace was a sweet relief and neither of them wanted to let go.
"Yeah well, that doesn't tell us how you guys started being a thing." Betty remarked clumsily, probably because she didn't know the whole story. Like the others did.
die? Yes, that's it, find a way not to die, or at least, live a little longer? Fix the weaknesses in his body, the failure of his heart. Yes, all that, but first pups. Make pups. No, water. Rehydrate his omegas first
Steve's heart leapt at the words. It did something to him when his boyfriend spoke in a foreign language but he ignored it and rolled his eyes. Determined to keep to his planned schedule, he started evaluating everything they had done in the morning and everything they had left to do, making plans for the afternoon tasks. Tony half-listened to him as he ate, smiling amusedly from time to time. When his plate was finished he wiped his mouth with a napkin and finished his glass of wine.
Tony grinned. "So... Is that a
it through them.
"I'm good," Clint answers with a shrug, "but you can open that bottle if you want." Tony complies and when he's done he pours himself another drink and gulps it down. Then he stares at his empty glass and looks at the bottom of it with a sense of desperation. He unintentionally sighs, which catches Clint's attention. "Want another beer?" He asks while glancing surreptitiously at him. "Or something stronger?"
"So, that's new..." He just said, smile goofy on his face. Steve felt his cheek heat up a little more. "I can't believe you made me kiss a male alpha." He suddenly exclaimed and then added "Gross!" while averting his eyes. He pretended to make a disgusted pout but his grin quickly spread on his face again.
on his bullshit and I was... I was just
Maybe it was time he trusted his boyfriend a little.
Steve stared at him confusedly, clueless. His voice was slightly shivering. "Are you out of your mind? Why would I want to press charges against you? For what?"
They stared at each other for a short moment. Tony was frowning at him, pouting angrily. Steve stared back at him with a growing puzzlement settling in his chest. He watched his boyfriend gulp down his second drink with a certain detachment. Tony grabbed his face with his two hands with an unusual violence and kissed him. "I'm sorry." He whispered on his lips. "I shouldn't have yelled at you." And he kissed him again. It was urgent and brutal and fierce.
“What just happened?” Susan asks in confusion. She then turns towards Reed in panic. “What’s the news on Earth? Did anything happen?”
Tony is faced with someone he didn't expect at all.
“You were probably not paying attention,” Bruce mumbles out. “But, uh, we started doing that after the Asgardian survivors said some giant purple man killed Thor and Loki for a piece of stone.”
Rhodey’s already in another suit – Tony has no idea where he got it from. Bruce, while still with one arm hurt, jumps off of Scott’s hand and is quickly followed by Rocket.
a good idea. And he hates it, because Pepper’s almost always right.
“I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something very similar to its own signature perhaps… it’s molecular integrity could fail.” He comes to stand in front of Wanda, clearly addressing her. In the back, Sam takes a seat, letting out a loud breath. Clint shakes his head as he joins him.
“At this point, it’s all we can do.”
, it says, the images showing destruction all over the city. Some sort of round circle-space ship in the sky. Wounded people running away, crying. A long figure, not looking human at all. Her hand goes up to her mouth, a gasp leaving her lips.
“Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change,” Strange says stubbornly. “This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.”
Tony walks by Morgan’s cart. She always pulls it whenever her dads are harvesting the goods and helps them carry it back to the house. Whatever they don’t use, they sell. Under an anonymous name, that is.
“I just wish he was here with us, to see what he’d saved.”
“What happened?” asks Steve in confusion. The debris around them really seems to have come out of nowhere. One moment, it had been light outside. Now, clouds have all gathered together and the entire place looks dark despite it still being the middle of the day.
“Ne- Nebula,” he whispers out. His dry lips crack painfully, and he can taste the blood on his tongue because of it.
Tony turns, looking around once more. “Yeah, we got one advantage; he’s coming to us.” Then he thinks it over for a moment. “We’ll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one.”
“You read my mind, son.” Peter pulls his mask back up and Steve takes Mjölnir off the ground. There’s this tiny urge to ask if he can hold it, but now is probably not the time for it. Besides, does he really want to know if he can even hold it?
But Tony knows what she lost; her husband. The one she’s lost before, but found back. Tony feels for her, he really does. But that doesn’t mean that he can magically figure things out with the snap of his finger.
"I've really spent," Tony went on with a tired voice, "six years of my life chasing after you, Steve." He looked at Steve again, eyes playful and expression amused. "I can't believe that you still don't see it after all this time. You're so blind." There wasn't any animosity in the tone of his voice however, despite what his words suggested. In fact, Tony looked at him with a fond and loving expression. Maybe that was one of those faults of his that Tony found cute. Or maybe he was just fucking with him, and with everyone else.
"Actually no. I'm not my own boss. I have a deadline and I'm already behind schedule."
"There's hardly anything I haven't done before." He chokes out and his voice comes out hoarse and broken.
Steve groaned. "You guys, piss me off. You think this is funny but this really isn't. I need to re-think my entire life now, all my life prospects... This is
Tony nodded softly against him, Steve could feel him smile silently. "A couple of times, yeah..."
Steve was mad though,
They have been dating for months now but strangely, they haven't had much opportunity for sex. It took them almost three months to finally do it. It was hard to find a moment and Tony kept insisting that they waited for Steve to be ready. Steve
Tony laughed again, throwing his head back sexily. "Laugh lines..." He corrected, looking back up at him. "And I love them, by the way."
"You're not fucking fine, Tony. You were
to live with you, Tony. I do."
He doesn't deserve any of this. It makes him sick in the stomach, thinking about it.
"And you're not interested in having someone... Why not?"

Tony stared at him silently, with an unconvinced pout on his lips. "Are we fine?" He asked after a long lingering silence.
Tony chuckled, feeling no shame at all. "That's slightly exaggerated, isn't it?" He snorted, proudly dishonest.

Steve is busying himself with his own phone and speaks again, after a short moment. "Clint's inviting us on Friday night."
just stood up to Howard Stark..." His voice faltered. "certainly not me anyway." Tony's eyes shone in an unusual glow, they were wet. He licked his lips and inhaled a deep breath. His eyes were unfocused, lost into space. "I don't know what happened at that moment," he continued, voice raspy, almost shivering, "but I felt something warm growing inside of me, I felt unsettled suddenly, dizzy." There was a slight tremor in his hands, as if he was reliving what he was saying. "I don't know how to explain this... I mean, I'd had crushes, I'd felt...
"Stop trying to find excuses!" The omega says in a laugh. "Tony can handle us fine. He wouldn't have bonded both of us if he couldn't. If you don't trust me, then trust mother nature, she doesn't make mistakes... I know you
He glanced at Tony time and again, checking on him, and if he wiggled a little too much while rutting against the mattress, he slapped his butt.
"How many times?"
willing. As a principle. He was built that way. He thought he chuckled, at the incongruity of the situation. He couldn't help himself.
"What then?" Tony asked and this time it was genuine.
He doesn't dare turn back. "What?" He replies curtly.
Only to be trampled down by the cynical and biting tone of his boyfriend a few moments later. "What's so funny?"
"Then get fucking hard and fuck me, moron!" Tony groaned.
he exclaimed, "have a crush!" His heart was racing however, unconsciously aware of some dishonesty on his part, perhaps. He shrugged the feeling off. "I haven't even presented yet."
Steve was supposed to help him feel better, not worse. If he didn't want him then he should have left him to die or whatever. Tony felt like scratching his skin off again, he wanted to hurt the outside as much as the inside hurt. He wanted to feel as ugly outside as he felt inside. He wanted scream out but he couldn't. Each sound got stuck in his throat. "Why?" He managed to ask in a painful, shuddering breath.
"Where is Felicia?" He says hesitantly.
When he finally woke up in the morning, he had his hand on himself and his bed was damp with sweat. He felt empty and tired, body stiff and feverish. He rubbed himself one last time, emptying himself once more, enraged and out of breath. He arched his back on his bed with the pain and the need to cry out and finally, finally he felt a surge of relief. Tears were running down his red cheeks. His throat hurt from all the panting, he was dizzy. Millions of thoughts swirling around in his head and Tony, everywhere, highjacking his brain. The smell of him, the taste of him, the touch of his rough fingers... His hand still on himself, he felt it grow slowly and expand and grow more.
Steve felt his heart leap and returned his smile. "I do." He said softly and looked down embarrassedly, feeling a blush creeping on his face. "Perhaps I've stopped waiting." He said with a conniving smile. Tony beamed and turned his face back to the window pane while drinking his water.
A shiver ran down his spine when he realized Steve had coincidentally called when Howard, and then Obie, were in his office. As if he had been here as well, a witness of it all. Was fate playing a nasty trick on him? To get back at Tony for not believing in it? Another surge of despair crushed him down. The humiliation still scorched him, the rage still boiled and pooled inside. His helplessness and cowardice made him nauseous but every time he tried to break free he could feel the shackles hold him down.
Tony paused and added,"no excrement," just in case.
in your life... I wish you'd treat me like your equal."
that. He probably thought Steve had already left, in hindsight, and the anger turned into anguish, a deep and poisonous anxiety, roiling inside of him. He was realizing this wasn't a small and insignificant squabble. Tony had just—unsubtly—tried to let him know he wanted to live together and Steve had just rejected his offer in the worst possible way, as usual, and trampled on his feelings and, incidentally, rejected
He feels the heat creeping on his face again and chuckles embarrassedly. "Yeah but... I'm not sure I'll be able to give up on the name, you know... It's like a curse."
The doctor raised another unconcerned eyebrow. "Sure, do you have a name I should address you with?" She asked, almost amusedly.
They started with the entrance and the kitchen, putting away the small stuff into boxes. Steve was going to donate most of it to diverse charity associations. They mostly worked in comfortable silence, except for when Tony wasn't sure of where to put what or what stickers he should use. Well, Steve worked mostly, because Tony spent most of his time staring dubiously at Steve's kitchen utensils as if he was discovering a new world. Not without making the stupidest comments from time to time, to annoy Steve. Or he would roam around aimlessly like a lost soul, wiping his hands on his jeans helplessly.
Steve flicked his eyes to him and frowned. "In bed maybe..." He blurted resignedly, barely able to hide his exasperation. Tony's eyes flared with mischievous lust and he smirked as a response but didn't say a word.
Sam and Clint joined them a few minutes later and there was an awkward moment between them, when they both realized what Steve smelt like this morning. Clint's eyes opened wide but his surprise turned rapidly into amusement and he was grinning just as stupidly as Bucky the next minute. Sam looked away for a split second, expression unreadable, and then he gave Steve a shy, slightly mirthless, smile.
"Then we can stay like this, can't we? This is working, right? This.
"Yes," Tony confirms and then his hand is back on the blond omega's hip. He resumes thrusting into him, rocking steadily, and Steve groans deep in his throat, his mouth lazily shut, his eyes still wide-open, lost in a daze.
Steve rolled his eyes.
"I kind of felt like the sky was falling onto my head when she told me. She wanted to keep it, obviously. And I couldn't
Just enjoying yourself with a consenting partner. It's still hard for Tony not to put more into it. Except with Steve. Steve helps him do that. With Steve sex in an act of love. Nothing else. Most of the time, at least.
being sandwiched by Clint and Bucky." He added with a huge smile on his face that Steve could even hear in his voice.
A flash of something indescribable ran across Tony's eyes before he grinned amusedly and sort of pouted pensively. "That makes sense." He said and then he stared right into his eyes, unsettling. "Is that why you kissed him?"
Steve was back on his paper, gnawing at his pen and avoiding Tony's interested gaze. "What about me?" He asked nonchalantly.
Steve shrugged. "Maybe later?"
"Steve's vernissage is tomorrow. Tonight's just a party. I'll come and see it later."
Tony was back to the other side of the counter before Steve could regain composure however, laid back on the stool and ready to start lunch as if nothing had happened. Steve let out a long relieved sigh and climbed on the stool, glaring at his boyfriend. The latter was finishing his apple with a smirk.
Steve startled. "You're never hungry in the morning." He whispered with a croaky, slightly concerned voice, "but you still eat the food..."
Tony threw his head back, his chest shaking with a full-body laugh, and spasmed on the bed, shaking Steve with him. When he finally quieted he tightened his hold on Steve and looked into his eyes with a lewd gaze. "You do know that it wasn't you, right?" He said softly, meaning it with all his intent, and planted a soft kiss on Steve's cheek. "I just wasn't... I wasn't in the right mood, for that. I mean, I just... I was trying—" He struggled, trying to find the right words to express himself but failed. "You were perfect then, babe, I swear. The way you paid attention, all the way, and kept reassuring me. How soft you were. The way you spoke to me and kept speaking the whole time... It was exactly what I needed then. There was nothing I wished you'd done differently." Tony turned on the side and wrapped his other arm around him, planting another thankful kiss on his cheek in a loving sigh. "I mean," he added nonchalantly, "except for the way you dumped my ass on the phone afterwards, because
Repeat.
The questions and congratulations flew thick and fast. The women asked enthusiastically about the baby, the men pretended they didn't care but still listened eagerly at the answers. Steve felt numb, still stunned by the news. He was only half-listening, millions of questions rushing to his brain.
Tony drank his glass in one go and poured himself another one before turning around and facing Steve. He leant against the bar. His right hand was shaking, just like it did when he was nervous or stressed out and needed a smoke. He stared into Steve's eyes with a piercing gaze, meant to unsettle Steve. Steve shivered and looked down, unmoving.
"Which turned into a drinking party at mine."
No, he hadn't noticed the watch. To be fair, he couldn't really see it from his angle, he did stare a lot at his right hand however and remembering the rough, calloused fingers so dexterously playing with that pen did something in his stomach he'd rather ignore for the moment. He had been feeling very weird since this morning anyway, must be the shock on his head.
—and forces Steve and Loki to move apart to slouch between the two of them. He turns to Steve first and catches his mouth in a hot, filthy kiss.
Sam patted his shoulder gently. "Why don't you tell us where this epiphany came from, huh?"
As if...
Bucky's hand was warm and comforting on his shoulder. "You'll get used to it." He said with a soft voice. "At the end of the day, it doesn't change much." Steve glanced at the three of them sidelong. They were all silent for a moment but the awkwardness was gone.
Steve's heart skipped as he recognized the heat of that husky voice and felt a sweet warmth spreading in his chest and up his neck to his cheekbones. His heart started racing. He opened his eyes and saw the tall silhouette walking away, carrying a pile of books in his hands and looking totally unfazed.
The decor is eccentric. Just like Clint is, he supposes. There's absolutely no logic behind it. No style, no coherence. It's just heaps stuff that have no connection whatsoever. Knickknacks of all sorts, beautifully arranged however. At least Tony thinks so. He loves the atmosphere, it is so Clint. Pepper would completely freak out though. He internally laughs while imagining the face she would make if she were to see this, trying to remain polite by repressing a disgusted grimace.
Steve felt a lump growing in his throat that he tried to swallow with difficulty and breathed out a shuddering sigh. He was standing still, unable to move, and stared at his boyfriend helplessly. Tony poured himself another drink, despite Steve's concerned remark.
Steve didn't stop.
Probably not, in hindsight. Tony was definitely the rock in their relationship, Steve was ashamed to admit. He was way too insecure about them to invest himself but it was time he brought his first stone to the foundations, or else what about them?
"I'm glad that you did, baby." Steve blurted, although he probably
Bucky grimaced. "Don't know. I think she's beta. A strong woman though."
Tony stared up at him while he opened and closed his mouth like a fish, speechless.
She smiled and went back to examining him. "Have you been experiencing headaches since you regained consciousness? Pain? Tingling in your limbs? Dizziness? Nausea? Sight problems? Memory loss? Temporary paralysis...? The list was never-ending.
People's stares were bemused and curious.
Tony let out an exhausted laugh and leant his forehead against Steve, catching his breath. "I can't." He croaked out with a self-deprecating smile. "I can't hold it for that long—I can't carry you that long... You're too fucking heavy, Rogers."
Jane and Thor had a daughter named Torunn about four years ago. She’s a sweet girl with golden curls, and she turns out to be just as strong as her Father. Then, two years ago, the twins were born; two boys named Modi and Magni.
After that, it’s silent in his ears. No more FRIDAY, no more Steve. He’s too far away.
“I seriously don’t know how you fit your head into that helmet,” Strange counters.
“Peter! Come inside for a moment, will you?”
And eventually he gets to stand in front of the house he knows Peggy lives. It looks like an apartment building; she probably didn’t have much to go on after the war. That’s not right…
When suddenly Yaël jumps up on her feet, holding her arms out with a loud gasp of surprise exiting her mouth, Hilde gets on her feet as well, taking a battle stance instantly to protect the pregnant woman next to her.
“That Time Stone guy,” Natasha starts, pointing at the green-lit amulet in front of them. “What kind of doctor was he?”
Needing to look at his son, Tony puts Peter down and leans close to him. Peter takes a few shaky breaths while looking upwards. Then, he turns towards his father with an apologetic expression.
Wanda has to admit that she enjoys the anonymity.
Annoying guy hands Thanos the cube. The purple giant looks at it with some sort of wonder in his eyes before he crushes it with one bare hand. There’s a short blue blast, followed by Thanos blowing the dust away.
He’s in the room. They’re at a lakehouse – the tower isn’t exactly inhabitable, according to Steve, since nobody’s lived there for the past five years. As it turns out, despite Peter being gone Tony still designed a room for him when he drew out the building he was making with Steve. Perhaps some part of him had still hoped that Peter would return.
powers unless you fill in tons of paperwork.” She actually lets out a small, bitter laugh at that, surprising Hilde a bit. Then she shakes her head, pulling up the remote control and starting up the television.
That’s a weird question to ask, isn’t it? When Peter’s back, Tony has to tell him about this. He would find it hilarious!
And then in the evening, Peter would call up Johnny, and they would have gone over to the statue of liberty and hang out there for a bit until it’s too late and they have to go back. Except, Johnny had been on a space mission for the past week with his team. And Peter wonders if the Four would find them in the case that they would survive this face-off.
“No telling. He has the Power and Space Stone, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe.”
“Carol Danvers,” Steve clarifies. “AKA Captain Marvel, according to Fury’s old files on her. Got her powers from the Tesseract, to put it shortly.”
The past version of Steve does exactly what he did all those years ago and mentions that he’s heading downstairs to help out some more rather than sitting back for a moment like Natasha and Clint seem to be doing.
Dr. Cho falls quiet, and Yaël smirks.
It’s good to finally have a name.
“He knows I’m here?” Yaël asks.
“It’s not a- it’s not- It’s nothing,” Quill quickly interjects, trying to shake it off. Of course, that’s when Peter decides to make this whole thing worse.
“So, then are you… attracted to women?”
Passing on the details of the Scepter to Steve, he leaves the man to his own mission. Tony has to focus on the Tesseract, after all. He trusts that Steve can manage this just fine.
He makes a pass around the corner, frowning into the living room but freezing immediately after. From the footsteps behind him he understands that the others have it just the same way.
To that, Steve shrugs. “I don’t know. I didn’t get to meet him,” he admits.
shouldn’t use your stone. If he can’t find you we should take that to our advantage.” Vision seems to get a bit tired and annoyed at the same time. He stumbles back to a seat, sighing loudly once he’s in it.
“We made it,” she says with a hoarse voice.
“Listen, Odal. I’m sorry they took your friend-“
“Fine,” she eventually says. She knows there’s no way she’ll convince the woman otherwise. She heard from rumors that Hellvegeners are extremely stubborn, but since Yaël is half-Asgardian as well, it’s even worse. “We head to the wreckage, but we only stay for a couple of minutes. We can’t risk being found.”
Yaël nods as she sits down next to her. “That’s good,” she returns. “They might be able to bring him back, as well.”
“He can’t be as bad as Hela,” Hilde intercepts. Yaël shakes her head, then.
Clint returned back home. Or whatever’s left of home. The moment after he disappeared, nobody’s been able to reach him.
“I know this is a lot, but I promise you, Pete, it’s really me.” Tony takes another step towards him. “No-one knows you’re my kid, right? So how could anybody trick you with that?”
Tony talks a bit about MIT. Not too much, just enough to make him at least believe he ever went there – which he did, obviously. It’s not too hard to convince his old man of his innocence. For some reasons, now that he’s older, he knows exactly which buttons to push with this man. That’s a trick he had never really mastered before, while the man was still alive.
“Is that even possible?” she asks, taking in the wound and holding her hand over it as she tries to close it with the energy she’s sending its way.
“It was good to meet you, Rogers.” Howard returns to take back the stuff he handed over to Tony. Behind him stands a black car, with in front of it another familiar man. Tony loses his words again after seeing him, recognizing Mr. Jarvis in an instant.
“So, still think this is like Budapest all over again?” asks Clint as he runs through the streets with bursts of wind thrown their direction. They avoid it, easily. At this point, the attacks are very predictable. Later on, they’ve trained that predictability out of her, but right now she doesn’t yet have that kind of training.
Nebula is suspended in the air in the middle of the room. She’s shivering, letting out painful breaths. Calling out her name didn’t make her react. She’s probably in too much pain.
“Show me.” Patience tested enough, Thanos smiles at last.
“The infection’s run its course, thanks to the blue meanie back there. You’d love her; very practical, only a tiny bit sadistic. Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge to buy ourselves about forty-eight hours of time.”
“Will you be alright?” asks Yaël carefully.
Tony repairs his shield thanks to T’Challa bringing out some vibranium. Steve watches him work and it seems like extremely infuriating work to get it all mended back together, but eventually he succeeds. Tony hands him back the shield, almost expecting him to jump back into action now that he has it.
She starts running, plunging the Dragonfang inside a couple of the guards’ throats before storming inside the hangar. That’s where she finds nothing but destruction in front of her.
Dr. Cho opens her mouth, but then quickly closes it. Hilde gives her a teasing look, but then nods to her as an indication that she can continue.
The others give him a pitiful look, all tiptoeing around the fact that two of the most important people are missing. This, right here, would be a good moment to have Bucky around, but they had to leave him in Wakanda due to this sudden crisis. A fact that Natasha doesn’t really seem to like, either.
This particular picture is of many years ago; back when Tony only barely knew he had been Peter’s Dad. They had gone to Disneyland together, and took a picture with the Mouse after May’s insistence. Peter’s wearing the typical ear-hat and he has a massive grin on his face – despite his obvious exhaustion. He had a few difficult days back then, and Tony thought the trip would distract him.
Strange sounds just as hurt as him. “We’re in the Endgame, now.”
to bring him back, but I can’t go back to hoping again. I can’t do it. I literally
“I love you so, so much, Pete.”
“It will take time, brother.”
“By the way, this is a friend of mine. Tree.” He gestures towards them with his new, larger weapon. The creature snarls at him, not looking pleased at all.
doesn’t want to approach the old man.
“You can’t stop me from coming with you!”
“Are you about to say: ‘the Hulk’?” Loki asks. Hilde has noticed the uneasiness Loki has been carrying around the green giant. According to Thor, there’s some sort of past between them that did not end very good, and he felt the need to assure that the past had nothing to do with anything romantic, which Hilde hadn’t even thought of from the start. Sometimes she wonders if it was such a good idea after all to make Thor the King of a homeless group of people.
Wait. She reaches for her wrapped-up belly, finding the wound dressed and bandaged. She actually survived? How is this possible? She glances over at the white-dressed woman, who is now hovering over the familiar dark-haired woman.
“No, we have to destroy it,” Vision interjects without much hesitation. Somewhere during the conversation he stood up, getting to stand against the window as he looks outside. “I’ve been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head; about its nature but also its composition.”
“It isn’t supposed to be,” he returns shakily. There’s another painful, breathy grunt before he lets out a small chuckle. “I’m beginning to think we should have stayed in bed.”
It’s unclear what Yaël tells him; it’s spoken so softly that even Hilde can’t understand it.
“Dad, you need to calm down, you’re trying to check your pulse with your gauntlet still on,” Peter says, holding up his hands with his innocent brown eyes looking into Tony’s. The engineer shakes his head, trying to concentrate on his breathing but feeling like it isn’t working at all. He can’t- he has to- normally jumping into the suit helps but this time he was already in it and-
Earth. Brunhilde has never been there before. She wouldn’t mind, seeing what the fuss is about. She would even like to meet that ‘human’ Thor seems to adore so much. Loki mentioned her a bit earlier, and Hilde found herself intrigued immediately, because she must be a great warrior to catch the eye of Thor, right?
“Dude, don’t call us plucky!” Quill interjects. “We don’t know what it means.”
“Right when we left. I’m sorry, I kind of took the lead there. You were a bit distracted.”
Wanda immediately stands in front of Vision, who is unable to move away from where he’s seated. She feels her eyes sting, but this is not the time for tears. With the wind getting even stronger, she’s feeling extremely glad about putting her hair together. To have that messing up her sight would have been a nightmare.
When he looks at his hands, he barely recognizes them. They’re dirty, no matter how much he washes them. They used to have water to shower at first, but they’ve only used it once after realizing that they were running out.
“She’s great, by the way. We need you. You’re new blood.” Finally fighting out of Rhodey’s hold, Tony marches up to Steve. “Bunch of old tired mules. I got nothing for you, Steve. I got no coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. No will to live.”
Steve smiles, jumping up to get the chance to dance. Peggy puts on the music. And finally,
“Uh, he said something about a week or so,” Tony starts. He blinks a couple of times. “But I-“
“I think we’re here,” Strange answers before Tony can.
“Say, Doc, you wouldn’t happen to be moving your hair, would you?” Tony suddenly asks. With the phone removed from his ear, he comes to realize that that heavy noise did not come from the phone.
“It’s not that- Stop it! Just let me!” Thor’s voice cracks for a moment, and his eyes redden from upcoming tears. “Just let me do it. Just let me do something good. Something right.”
Gamora then frowns. “How am I alive? Thanos gave me a fatal wound, there was no way for me to survive this?”
Steve takes her place right after that. He looks like he’s trying all he can to hold back the tears, but Tony isn’t fooled. He can see it in those tiny little expressions. Steve is giving him a sad smile as he takes over Tony’s hand. Tony pulls away the armor there – at least still managing that. With a grunt, he moves to his pocket and takes something out, which he hands over to Steve.
“So, are we getting the whole team back together?” asks Tony curiously. As far as he remembers, everybody went their own way. He can’t blame them; Thor has his own family now. Clint is MIA, Rhodey’s doing more military work to distract himself from reality.
“And you with it. We’re not having this conversation,” Wanda returns stubbornly.
Hilde finds something in space
“How vague?” Steve still doesn’t seem too convinced.
“That’s the EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might’ve wound up pushing time through Lang. It’s tricky, dangerous. Somebody should’ve cautioned you against it.”
“No can do,” Strange returns.
“I got it!” Peter shouts at him. Hearing his voice, T’Challa looks over and throws the gauntlet into the air. With his spider webs, Peter grabs it away. He lands on an unknowing Chitauri – those bad guys from the first attack on New York, he remembers – only to be surrounded by even more of them.
“And what exactly is your job, huh? Besides making balloon animals?”
(See the end of the chapter for
It would be great to see Lady Sif again. It’s been a long time, though, and while it might just have been a couple of seconds for Sif, were she to come back, it’s still been five years for Hilde. Hilde, who’s been moving on from that failed relationship.
“He’s here.” Vision isn’t looking at her. He’s glancing around, trying to find what’s going on around them. She can feel a change in the wind. It feels… quiet, all of a sudden. Even Wanda sits up a bit to check her surroundings, but so far there’s nothing alarming around here.
It goes on and on. Whatever they throw Thanos’ way, it doesn’t seem to affect him even in the least. Even through teamwork, while it holds the Titan back, it never really does anything lasting. Before he even knows it, Thanos is using him as a shield for Thor’s upcoming attack.
The image of Tony in front of them rubs his forehead, biting his lips as he thinks of what to say next.
“I should probably lie down,” he continues. Why is he even doing this? Nobody is going to hear the recording. “Please know that… when I drift off, I will think about you. Because it’s always you.”
“Idiot.” Natasha rolls her eyes and holds out her hand towards Yaël’s belly. Pressing her fingers onto it, she wonders if any of them have any idea how to do this. But with the stone being the one for Souls, it must have sensed hers trying to reach it. Slowly, an orange glow emanates from her stomach, until the Stone flies out and comes to rest onto her hand. She feels the sheer power of it, and lets out a shaky breath from it.
“And to see a friend,” he admits. He’s worried about her, but she’s never going to accept it. She’s already freaked out once when learning about Morgan, who is technically her granddaughter. That whole situation is weird and Steve doesn’t want to think too much about it.
“What are you saying?” Wanda asks with a shaky voice. Though Peter understands it.
“It’s not bad,” Tony returns with a shrug.
“And I needed you.”
Not far from the house, they have this little spot in the sun where they put some chairs to sit in on a beautiful day like this one. There’s a table where they’re supposed to eat, but so far it’s filled with gardening equipment, since Steve has started on that particular hobby. To his left, there are the crops that the Super Soldier are taking care of.
Steve feels a shiver going through him. “How long?” he asks when the King stays silent, deep in thought.
“Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what checks out.” He walks around the table as FRIDAY does her work again. “So, recommend one last sim before we pack in for the night. This time, in the shape of a mobius strip, inverted please.”
Now Mantis actually sobs. “He… he mourns.”
“Dude, you’re embarrassing me in front of the wizard,” Tony says quietly in Bruce’s direction.
Figuring that she’s not going to see anything from outside, Hilde steps up and approaches the unconscious girl still resting on the ground. Looking over at Loki for a short moment, he nods at her. That’s when she moves her hands underneath Yaël’s body and picks her up from the floor. Gamora, too, stands up with a grunt.
“Steve, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but I think there’s a very strong chance Peter followed Tony on the ship.”
But she also knows that Thanos taught her hand-to-hand combat. Forced her to learn it, more. So once she realizes that using her powers isn’t all that great of an idea, she gets back on the street with eyes glowing orange rather than the familiar yellow.
Another tear rolls over his cheek when his eyes catch Tony’s happy smile on the picture. He looks so much younger, more carefree than the last time Peter saw him. Now he’d been grey, tired… Gone…
“Thanks, guys,” he whispers. Then he turns to Wanda. “I’m also sorry for your loss. I know it’s been five years apparently but to you it must have been like a couple of days…”
“You okay?” she asks as she enters the living room of the house they’re staying in. It’s one of the larger houses; it has four bedrooms, one of them having been turned into a nursery with the help of a couple of Asgardians and some of her friends that came over last month.
“No, not really,” Bruce mutters out nervously. “But when do I ever get what I want?”
Hilde has no idea where the Hulk is hiding. The big guy is probably still in his chambers, sleeping through the entire invasion. It’s Thor, instead, who comes marching in.
Thor’s battle cry is their indication to start. As soon as the God runs towards him, Tony thrusts himself up in the air and Steve throws his shield in the Titan’s direction. It seems to do little to the Titan, but they’re not about to give up so easily.
“The stones?” Steve sounds as worried as Tony feels.
He hasn’t been in the lakehouse for long, but so fars he can say that this building is stunning. It’s surprisingly high-tech for its location; so clearly Tony in his attempt to escape his reality. As always, FRIDAY is with them, though she hasn’t said much since…
On the other hand, once powerful, Yaël is now lacking any bit of control to the elements. Her eyes, that had once had a golden glow, have now returned to their normal, brown state. Her hair has been cut short after realizing that Raido likes to grab on to it. She’s lost a lot of weight; Yaël always had quite some meat on her bones, but now there’s barely any of it left.
Now, what are the odds of a giant flying donut-looking spaceship hovering right next to the street that they were in? That, along with the odds of it appearing right after Bruce finally seems to remember something?
A dark blue rift in space appears a bit further away from them. Wanda hadn’t even noticed Bruce to be nearby, but as soon as a large, purple-skinned figure appears through the rift, wearing a golden gauntlet, she can hear Bruce through her communicator.
“Hey,” she greets him. Tony blinks at her, once, to tell her he heard her. Pepper smiles sadly. “FRIDAY?”
He’s very grateful that his tech still works in this time. Even sans FRIDAY, the glasses help him find whatever he’s looking for, making it seem like he knows where he’s going.
Oh, so typically her. Tony cringes upon hearing what he might have been called. “Huh, might wanna let that stew a while. You got time.”
Scott grumbles out a soft “No,” before he lowers his head again. Tony chuckles, pretending to be relieved.
There’s a loud crash. The lights flicker for a bit, the entire ship shaking. Everybody’s heads turn towards the window, though nothing is to be seen. Immediately, they hurry towards another room. Without telling anything to the person residing there, they storm inside. The man, who had been looking at some video of some sort of space opera looks startled.
Tony counts to ten inside his mind. If he doesn’t, he might actually bring out his inner asshole-behavior. Even more than he already has.
“Alright, you’re up, little buddy. There’s our stone.” He points towards the briefcase holding the Tesseract.
“No wait, Bruce! Are you okay?” Steve stops him, trying to get any information. None comes out of Bruce, who is still struggling with the strong power on his arm.
They’re all put in some sort of hovercraft vehicle. It’s mostly Wakandan soldiers, but Steve’s ship also holds Bucky and Nat. Sam and Rhodey are flying above, while Bruce is making use of Tony’s Hulkbuster armor they thought to bring along.
