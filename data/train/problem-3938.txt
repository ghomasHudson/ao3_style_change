“Castiel!” He greeted jovially and gave his son a hug, which Castiel returned. “It’s good to see you!”
The kettle whistled, and Dean grabbed it to pour it over the grounds. He stirred it well with a wooden spoon and pressed the lid on to let it sit for four minutes. Dean looked back through the doorway into the living room, where Cas had settled onto his somewhat lumpy but oh so comfortable couch, surveying his array of coffee table books, flipping through the one of that weird international scavenger hunt thing Sam did a few summers back.
It was as if Jimmy were speaking to him, calling to him from behind the silvered glass, asking him what the fuck he was doing feeling sorry for himself, when he could be fighting for the man he loved.
“Awesome.” Dean reaches out and grabs Cas’s bicep. “Well, if you're good out here, I'm just gonna borrow Cas to help me make dinner. Kay?”
“I saw Sam in the gardens. He escaped over the palace wall.” He told him. “I told him what happened in the ballroom. He asked me to tell you he will be...he’ll be there tomorrow. So you don’t go alone.”
Dean laughed and swept his sister into a huge hug, nearly crushing the air out of her. Jo was next, followed closely by Ellen, who grabbed her adopted son and immediately peppered his face with kisses.
He reached out and slipped the blindfold from Dean’s eyes and gently tugged the gag from his mouth. Dean coughed, turning his head and spitting stale saliva onto the floor before turning his green eyes to Castiel.
“So you said that the lady that had the iris before you bought it today died, right?” Both Dean and Cas nod, and Sam continues. “Well, I did a search for local obituaries up in Hastings, and I found one I think might fit the bill.” He turns the laptop towards them, and Dean feels Cas’s breath on his neck as the former angel leans over his shoulder to peer at the screen; his spine tingles and he forces himself not to grin like an idiot.
Once they're outside, Castiel allows Dean to lead him through the walkways between the tents and booths of the farmers market towards the organic food store Sam prefers. They set the iris down on the sidewalk, and Dean smirks when he holds out his hand.
, over on Main Street. Perhaps we could stop in there? I’m in need of a half decent cappuccino and I’m guessing you don’t have a Starbucks anywhere around here, so it will have to do. Perhaps closing my eyes will allow for me to imagine it’s halfway decent.”
“He lied.” Castiel said. “He lied to protect me. I knew who he was when I danced with him at the masque. I’ve known him for almost a year.”
Castiel tries to hide his smile at the brothers’ bickering as he and Dean take their respective sides of the iris’s pot and begin their trek back to the Impala. He helps Sam unload the cart of its canvas bags, adding his own to the pile in the trunk before unloading some of their more perishable items - including the three pies Dean had bought from the vendor - into the cooler in the other footwell. He then very carefully maneuvers the iris into the driver’s side footwell of the backseat. The iris fits nicely, just as he'd hoped, and Castiel very carefully slides in behind it, settling the pot between his knees.
“Naomi,” Chuck took his wife by the shoulders. “Calm down. Let Castiel settle in first. He will be no good to anybody if he’s burnt out after only twenty four hours. Let him breathe a little, honey.”
His train of thought is derailed by the warmth of Cas’s mouth sinking back down on his cock, and he's lost to the sensations once more. He knows he's close, already hard to the point of pain even with the pleasure that sparks through his entire body every time Cas bobs his head, and he bites his lip when Cas swallows around him, blunt fingernails digging into Cas’s scalp subconsciously.
“Here,” Dean takes the handle of the shopping cart and carefully wheels the iris against the wall next to the sinks. He grabs the chair the three of them use when they need their hair cut and drags it over, setting it against one of the sinks. He grabs two towels from the shelf, and rolls one up to put on the edge of the sink. He runs warm water into the bowl, testing it with his fingers before he turns back to Cas.
Castiel and Sam had been making trips to the farmers market somewhat of a regular thing the last few months. Since Castiel had officially given up his Grace and Fallen, the Winchesters had set it upon themselves to make sure that Castiel got the most out of his human experience this time around. While Dean educated him on how to live fast and die young, namely through talks of sex, booze, rock and roll, and greasy foods, Sam had taken it upon himself to teach Castiel the more mundane, quieter side. He'd been the one to teach Castiel how to use the washer and dryer, how to get grass stains out of the knees of his jeans, how to tell an unripe avocado from a ripe one, and when he'd asked him if Castiel wanted to join him on a trip to Hastings to go to the farmers market for a few herbs for some of their hex bags, Castiel had agreed.
“Exactly. So if anyone at that contest was going to want to exact revenge on a little old lady, my money’s on it being Natalia Jennings.”
kept a low profile. I didn’t use my magic for anything other than giving my roses the little nudge they needed to grow bright and beautiful.
Cas shrugs, still wearing his smitey face despite the way the corner of his mouth twitches upward. “Do with the money what you want.” He says. “I don’t care.”
Less than five minutes after he’d sent the text, just as Castiel was shifting through his luggage to find the most nondescript clothes he could, there was a swift series of knocks at the door, and Gabriel let himself in.
A young boy no older than nineteen with long blue hair and the start of a patchy beard walks over. He smiles at them.
Dean isn't blind; he'd seen the way a few of the burly trucker types had looked their way when Dean had called Cas
“Listen, Sam,” he finally managed. “It’s not safe here. You need to leave, before they catch you, too.”
“For the record,” Cas said. “I thought your salad was spectacular in its presentation, and I’m sure it tasted delicious.”
“It should fit in the footwell of the backseat.” Castiel muses. “Or I could tilt the pot a bit to accommodate for its height should it still be too tall.”
Dean knew himself well enough to know that he fell in love easily, and quickly, and he knew that if he wasn’t careful, he could easily fall into a hole he couldn’t dig himself out with this one. Cas was a goddamn
“Yeah, well, I guess now we know why Sam spends so much time in the shower.” Dean quips. “Gotta keep that hair lucious, after all.”
Dean turns the corner onto the road with the greenhouse. A large moving van sits out front, the engine idling. No one else is in the parking lot, the greenhouse seemingly devoid of any other customers. This time of day on a Monday, that’s not all that surprising.
It took indecipherably long for Cas’ airway to clear and his heart to calm to a discernible rhythm against the hand bunched around his shirt.
It's been months of searching, of fighting with Cas to find him and suddenly for the first time he doesn't care. He doesn't care who Jack is, or why he's trailing after his brother, alive, not even whether he was going to kill him. He wasn't sure if he cared about anything.
"Oh real mature Cas. Do you know what else is mature?" Lifting his hand up into the air, he raised his middle finger, before letting it drop, slamming down next to Sam’s elbows.
"You know what. Have you told him?"Sam was scared as to how his brother would react. There were certain things they didn't talk about, relationships, especially his relationship with Cas.
"Well not personally no," Cas' voice was calm and steady, casual even, "but he was talked about at the time. And one of my brothers knew him."
“In a way. As an angel I was capable of sensing, feeling, seeing every particle, but that could be overwhelming at times. Up close it's hard to see the beauty in things and they all begin to blur together, but I understand now why there are so many poems about the stars.”
"Yeah, I've known him god, it would be almost nine years. I can't believe it's been that long." Although Dean also couldn't believe he lived so many years before knowing him.
"Aren't you supposed to be looking at the road?" Turning he noticed he was drifting onto the other side of the lane. It was a good thing that it was pretty late.
Pressing himself against Cas’ back, Dean wrapped his hands around him so that he could place his hands over Cas’. He lifted Cas’ hand, placing it where it belonged. “Okay. That's good," Dean whispered, retracting his arms from Cas, "stay exactly like that." Dean walked back apprehensively.
Cas groans pushing him away, Dean laughs, head falling back against the pillow, "oh come on, Cas," Dean leans up onto his elbows, eyebrows raised, "you
Wiggling his toes through the dark Graham cracker sand, he watched as the particles parted, spread around him only to fall back to the earth clinging to one another. There was a time he would have been able to see every individual grain, to pinpoint its age, its origin, to know how long it had sat at the bottom of the ocean, how many times the bitter waves had crashed along its surface, but he had never know what they felt like as they cascaded somehow both soft and rough along his palms and through his fingers. He had believed then that he knew everything there was to know about the world, about life, but he knew now that there was a difference between knowing and understanding. He may have known all there was to know about sand, but that didn't mean he had experienced it. He hadn't taken the time to think about how he related to it. He hadn't felt its grainy texture between wet wiggling toes, or rough palms.
Sighing, Dean ran his hands through the short hairs that had started to fall across his forehead. "Yeah and I'm thinking of taking Cas somewhere. Something to show him that even though lives a shit show of never ending pain, doesn't mean we have to acknowledge it all the time. "
This wasn't like ever before. When he had been too weak to heal himself he'd always been able to feel the grace flow through his vessel, but even that was gone.
Sam pats Dean's knee before standing up and stretching, earning him a yawn, and leaves. Dean stares at the bottle still in his hands and chugs another swallow before going back to staring into the darkness.
Cas' lips tilted upwards in a way no one else would have noticed, but Dean could tell meant he was happy.
Dean turned to Cas' smile wide with the innocent joy of child fondness and nostalgia. "If we're given you the proper human experience, we've gotta start with the beginning and a childhood is no real childhood without cotton candy."
Dean knows that Sam is there and that he brought that damn nephilim with him, but he also doesn't seem able to respond to move his mouth and push out words, not sure if he remembers how.
Dean sniffled nose twitching, turning to the side he rubbed his hand across his face hoping to hide the wetness curling around the edge of his lash line. Pulling his hand back to his side, Dean squeezes Cas’ shoulder as one last goodbye. “For what? Finally stopped being a dick.”
Sam snorted. "Yeah you're gonna have to save all the Dean emotional allowance to talk to Cas. Right?"
The ride jerked forward and Dean leaned forward to grab the handle, suddenly reminded that they were going upward. Dean tightened his grip, squeezed his eyes shut and breathed deeply in and out. This wasn't the same as a plane, it was not going to go very high. He was going to be fine. But with that thought, Dean slowly opened his eyes to see Cas facing him, concern evident in the furrow of his brows and the downturn of his lips.
"It's just, I can't okay. I can't mess this up, like I seem to mess up everything that matters. What if I tell him and he —" Dean's hands shook as he struggled to take the next breath trying as hard as he desperately could to do what he always does and push down his feelings, preventing anyone from seeing his vulnerabilities. "He doesn't want to be my friend any more and I lose him."
is better with music.” He picked up his phone, scrolling until he came across one of his playlist. Clicking shuffle, a heavy beat drifts through the shitty phone speakers crackling into the open air.
Now, he realized that there was a limit to how high one could climb, he had sought too much power and height desperate to get to look at things from afar, where he couldn't see or feel individual suffering and now he was falling and there was nothing there to catch him.
Dean pulled his hand back slowly ringing it over the other in his lap, he spoke in a lower tone, sad enough even Cas could feel the pain of it in his own chest. "I was told by my dad when I was younger that having nightmares was weak and ridiculous, that were not some tangiable item and therefore not to fear, but now that I’m older and everything's changed, I’ve learned that that was stupid. I’m scared all the time."
"No buts. You are going to apologise to Cas. And you are going to fix this." Sam's voice softened, as he swirled the remaining liquid in his cup where it hit the side in small pitter patters. "Cas needs support not whatever this pretty nonsense is.
Cas sighs, god he can’t stay mad at Dean with that smile and now he's not sure if it's good that Dean knows how to say I love you, because if he starts abusing that power Cas is certain that he won't be able to say no to him ever again.
Cas smiled small and delicate and Dean thought about how maybe he should tell Cas if this is what being honest got him.
"Why Dean? Why does the thought that Cas cares about you scare you so much? Isn't that what you want?"
After a petty stare off that Sam lost, he sighed. "Dean, I want to make sure that you're okay. You know I don't want to pressure you into something you're not ready for. I.. Well I know that, well suspected that you've felt this way for years and I think that it would really help if you talked to him."
Dean lifted his cup in acknowledgement, watching the murky brown liquid slosh along its sides. "No he won't speak to me."
"But now," lifting his other hand, Cas rests it on Dean's left cheek, smearing tears into his skin and framing his face, "because of what you taught me, I know that was wrong, selfish, manipulative. People don’t owe you anything, they have nothing to prove, no greater reason, no one they need to earn the favour of to live for they are already living. And you don’t owe anyone anything either. You deserve love even if you don’t think you do. Especially as you struggle, as you lash out, as you feel broken and destructive, because how else would you learn how to improve without love and support?”
Cas was here with him and despite what Dean thought, even if he wasn’t sure he could believe it yet, Cas loved him.
"CaAAaasssssssss!" Though as fast as Dean could begin to process the light it began to dim until there was nothing left and his body, Cas's body slid to the floor. The thunk echoed in is head drowning out the sound of his thoughts, of his brothers rapid breaths beside him of the terrifying creature still holding the tainted angel blade before him.
strong Cas. Even now without your powers, and I shouldn’t discredit you. You’ve worked hard and it wasn't just your powers that made you a skilled fighter, a good hunter. You’re smart and quick. You have a lot of fighting experience and you’ve had issues and temperaments with your grace before and I get that this is different, but you still being here right now should have been a sign that you are strong, that you can survive. I - I"
When Dean turns back twisting away from him, Cas slipped a small earthy brown coil shell into his pocket. Another trinket to add to his rapidly growing collection of little things to remember the little moments. A token of seemingly insignificant fundamental memories.
"Dude, let me reiterate we're talking about Cas. He may have spent the last ten years on earth but he's still an angel. He's not really good at the subtlety or the hinting or any of the complications of human expression. Besides, it's not like you could go your whole relationship without telling him you like him."
He reached out wrapping his arms around Cas, crushing him against his chest. It took a couple seconds too long for Cas to respond wrapping his arms around Dean hard enough that he was struggling to breath. But Dean didn't care the strength was comforting, grounding and most importantly real.
"Cas." He slurred borderline delirious, beer splashing unnaturally loud in the heavy unrelenting silence.
But Dean freezes hand in mid air, eyes widening “I,” he says slow and disbelieving. Cas takes a deep breath holding his chest in tight apprehension. Dean's never said that before he's said other things, things that Cas knows are Dean's way of trying as close as he can get, but those words came out clear, simple and true.
Sighing long and slow, Dean shifted towards Cas, softening." Come on Cas', are there any specifics you can think of?"
Cas peeled the edges of the label on his beer bottle. “Thank you for showing me. For taking me here. For helping me. This can’t be easy for you either and I’m sorry if I’m taking up too much of your time.”
Dean slammed his forehead against the wall, numb to the reverberations "Huh? What then, Sam? I already lost him once," His voice shook and he struggled to regain his breath, he was not going to cry, he was not going to break. All that matters is that Cas is back, that he's alive. Feelings. Their stupid, unimportant. Yeah it felt like he was dying with the weight of this decade long secret not even a week ago, but that didn’t matter. If needed he could push that down too, a technique perfected by the prior years of practice.
“I love you too.” Cas whispers, scared that one wrong move will make Dean take back his words, fear of abandonment and rejection weaseling its way back into his brain. Instead if it’s even possible Dean smiles even wider.
Dean was beginning to panic. The rational part of his brain knew that it had only been a couple of seconds, however he was heaving, air was struggling to come out even with the adrenaline pumping through him. Cas was just going to have to get through this, they'd gotten through worse before. He was going to find a way out of there alive and without injuries, otherwise Dean swore he would be the reason he died.
He was going to teach Cas how to defend himself the human way. He hadn't thought about it before Sam had pointed it out, but Cas only fought with his powers or with his angel blades. Now that he was human that wasn't gonna cut it. Knives are only good as a short range tool. No, Cas was going to learn to fire a gun.
Bracing one hand on the wheel Dean dragged the other across his face. "God it's been a long time since we've gotten any moments like those."
Warmth was the first thing Dean felt, his mind slowly surfacing from sleep. Heaviness was the next. His chest felt weighted as if he was being crushed, his breaths sounding long and shallow in the early morning silence. Despite his body protests, He wrenched his eyes open.
Staring at his hands, Cas struggled to explain, to find words to verbalise the pictures that flooded through his head; Dean covered in blood blade gripped tightly in his hand, harsh breaths as he swung at the never ending stream of monsters, the face of betrayal and surprise as Dean stared at him when he pushed him through the portal and the images that never were, merely created by his past experiences and his brains imaginitiviy.
Dean used the but of his elbow to nudge Cas' side. "You could chop off my arm, so we could go through this journey of self discovery together."
Cas turned, cheek squished into the mattress highlighting the red sheet lines imprinted on his face down and around the forearm that flopped like a fish caught on a line down against the bed’s dark wood frame. His blankets knotted around the tangle of his legs, hairs defying gravity as the strands flopped over one another pointing in every direction, like pieces of grass recovering from being squashed under a careless man's foot. There was a small pout on his lips, a furrow to his brow, eyes half open blue iris clouding over as his eyes slid in and out of focus.
Dean stared at the door for several seconds before breathing deeply and moving to sit beside Castiel on the edge of his bed.
Beginning to feel stir crazy Dean slowly began to venture from the room he still thought of as cas's. It started simple with walks that quickly turned into sprints accompanied by blaring metallic and AC/DC, to driving baby for hours aimlessly till he found somewhere that sold beer and pie. Slowly growing braver Dean began not only leaving the bunker but what he found far scarier exploring within the bunker. Instead of running out of the kitchen as fast as possible once he'd raided whatever he could from the fridge that didn't need to be cooked, he instead cooked himself bacon and if all he cooked himself was a breakfast of bacon who could blame him, progress was still progress.
A part of him was certain that this couldn't be real, Cas couldn't possibly be back because Dean Winchester doesn't get second chances, Dean Winchester doesn't get a happy ending. No his life is one fucked up ball of never ending ever growing pain and suffering.
“So what you’re gonna want to do is raise these hands,” Dean shook their joints hands in the air, before lifting them to where they belong hovering out to the side, “to here and then,” he reached forward grasping Cas other hand and dragging him closer, “you’re going to want to put your other hand here,” he placed it on his waist where it rest right above his hip bone. “And then,” Dean grabbed Cas taking a gigantic step to the side swaying Cas’ step side to side so quickly he almost fell over, kitchen blurring to a mess of creams and tans behind him.
"I thought I understood.” Cas’ voice carried wispy as the wind that bounced off the planes of his cheeks and flew feather soft through his hair. “And I did to an extent, but I never truly understood how little agency humans have over their own body."
Today was different though, he was so many things that it was hard for him to choose if he was somehow all of them at once or somehow none of them.
Dean could see Sam's lips moving but he didn't seem to be processing any of the words. He was staring, it took him several seconds to realise it, but even then he didn't stop. Cas was alive. He never thought he would get to see him again. To see the stupid dirty trench coat, the messy black hair and his blue eyes and most importantly his smile. Cas didn't smile often, Dean was never sure if he was actually unhappy or if he simply didn't know that when he was he was supposed to smile. It had been many years since Dean gave himself the mission to make Cas smile more and even though it had only happened a couple of times laugh. Every time he did smile Dean couldn't help but stare at him at how beautifully adorable he was. Those thoughts used to scare him, but they’re all he thinks about anymore.
As sad as it was, shooting practice was the closest to father son bonding he'd ever gotten with his dad. Besides it gave him a good excuse to get out of the bunker, spend some time out in the open air with actual sunlight not Sam’s stupid fake daylight lamps that are supposed to be good for mental health or some shit.
Cas could see the frantic concern in the way the light bounced around his eyes as they bore into his skull and realised that not telling him would probably only make him worry more. "I don't know. There are just so many things and I often don't remember the dreams much anyway."
"Hey, no need to thank me," Dean waved his hand nonchalantly through the air, stupid smirk pulling at his lips, "I take cash and for therapy I charge twenty dollars an hour"
"But you and Sam drive for hours and don't get car sickness." Cas said confused, but he turned to look out the front window anyway.
Resting a hand lightly between Cas’ shoulder blades, Dean leaned down trying to keep the stupid smile from crawling its way across his face. “Come on.”
Dean leaned forward, laughing. "Well normally I'd just tell them to calm down and stop thinking about their responsibilities, but for someone like you with a stick that far up their ass it might take some more work."
Reaching the door Dean can see Cas' back turned to him one hand dragging across a picture of Dean's smiling face. Lifting is hand, Dean knocks gently against the wood twice, Cas jumps pulling his hand back to rest immovably by his side.
Tilting his head to the side, Cas asked. "How am I supposed to dance while encapsulated in a moving vehicle?"
Burning with the heat of the sun he felt like he was melting, skin falling from his limbs in a gush of distorted scarred flesh. The heat radiated off him exploding from the inside out as if he had magma flowing through his heart and back out through his mouth. Fire licked up the spine of his frostbitten back blooming into his wings, scorching his feathers till they burnt to a crisp and fell into ash that floated alongside his falling shell.
Dean smiled gently at Cas and whispered, voice soft and breathy. "Yeah, okay. You've been having a tough time."
Normally, Dean was all about hot and heavy. But in this moment, he realized he had all the time in the world. He brushed his lips tentatively against Cas. Slowly easing his way into it. Cas lifted his hand resting it gingerly against Dean's side, unsure what to do.
“I… um,” he rubbed the back of his neck hoping that Cas couldn’t see his blush in the dark. “wanted to talk to you.”
When Dean got old enough that his father would leave Baby under his company, he would drive with Sam out to places like this; where they could watch the stars and Sam would point out constellations and sprout facts Dean couldn’t understand when he’d had the time to learn. They’d lay on the hood of the car and stare at the sky talking in whispering voices scared to awaken the world around them. Dean missed the moments like that, when Sam was his little brother that still needed protecting. They’d both grown since then. Although Dean couldn’t really complain they’d gotten to grow together.
Dean turned to face Cas lying beside him. “What does that mean? Did your fancy angel vision block you from seeing somehow?”
"Well if that's it I'm going - ", stepping backwards Dean's foot caught causing him to stumble arms swinging barely keeping himself from falling, "to leave and try to get some sleep."
He wanted to tell him everything about how much he meant to him, about how hard it was to live without him, how sorry he was for fighting with him about Jack about pushing him away when he needed him. But Dean didn't know what to do and what to say and overall his need to hold onto Cas held him back. He couldn't lose Cas, not when had just got him back.
I tried writing this chapter in a slightly different style and I really like how it turned out. This chapters my favourite thing I’ve written so far. Please tell me what you think, I love receiving comments.
He walked as fast as he could down the familiar path to Cas’ room, hoping to arrive before his doubts could rush up and catch him. Lifting his hand to the door he hesitated pulling his arm back. No, he thought. You’re doing this. You can’t back out, not again.
Chuckling a light puff of air, Dean rolled his eyes. “And you give me so much about it.” He leaned down pulling out a pan. Cas stood awkwardly in the doorway unsure what to do as Dean continued moving, pulling bacon out of the freezer and running the package under cold water.
He's shaking using his free hand to balance himself on the counter. He's losing his mind or perhaps he already lost it with everything else that mattered.
"Line the end of the gun with the target and pull the trigger. There's gonna be a kick back, but don't worry you're going to be fine."
Dean leaned over the table knocking several books to the side. "I'm doing a beer run, I could use some company. Do you want to come?"
"And that's supposed to make me feel better?" Dean slammed the dresser drawer, cringing when he remembered that Cas was on the side of the wall.
"Yeah well just because you and Cas were friends or whatever doesn't mean you know a damn thing about what I'm feeling or what's best for me. Okay? So quit asking."
Dean couldn’t help his smile. He had always assumed that if Cas’ ever did sleep he would be an early riser, the kind of person who rose with the sun, and sat newspaper in hand, coffee in the other watching the glowing golden, rose petal pink and carrot-top orange streaks fill in the sky the way paint filled a canvas. In Dean’s opinion utter lunatics that scared him more than the monsters that seemed to roam freely through his calendar. Cas was however not an early bird gets the worm, but why on earth would you wake me up and proceed to tell me about worms, kind of person. That is to say Cas’ was a grumpy sleeper, practically a rumpled kitten, claws sharp and ready for whoever dared disturb his slumber. Dean knew it should be annoying, but he couldn’t help but find Cas’ grumpiness grounding and endearing. A reminder that he was real, living and breathing, not some perfect unattainable creature, simply a sufferer to clocks and responsibilities like everyone else.
Groaning, Dean pushed himself off the counter. "I'm worried about him. He's not acting like himself."
It hurt and Cas knew that was stupid. The images were not real and he was fine, but his body still shook tremors carrying in cold waves down his spine and out into his fingers that wobbled restlessly through the air.
It's only when he gives up and opens one of the doors in the dresser to put away a couple days of clothes that he notices a box in the corner of the dresser with Cas's only possessions. He smiles for the first time in days, and he said he didn't have any possessions.
Desperate, he opened his mouth to scream but no sound came out, only overwhelming emptiness and a rush of cold air.
Dean closed his eyes not wanting to look at Cas' face as he pulled the sheet over his head. Throwing the torch, Sam set the pier ablaze and Dean watched as it slowly grew, climbing upwards. When the sheet caught fire an odd almost calming cold settled over him like the first dunk into a swimming pool in the heat of summer, but Dean knew it wouldn't be long till he was stuck there drowning in the emptiness.
my role model. When I was in heaven, I was taught that feelings were bad, that they were the gateway to doubt. I didn’t question it. Looking back, because of you I realised I should have. You taught me that in order to do the right thing you have to be able to feel, to empathise, and understand in order to ensure that you’re making the right choice. You’ve taught me how to
Pushing himself up with his palms, Dean pulled out a couple of rest stop sandwiches and kettle cooked salt and vinegar chips.
When he awoke, if he could remember his dreams, he was able to tell that they were simply scenarios created by memories and a half focused brain. But for some reason that didn’t stop his body from reacting as if they were real. His breathing raised, short and fast, his heart pounded as if he was running.
And yet, Dean had somehow found himself here, standing with the second Prince of Caelum about to get into his car to go get coffee together in what Cas himself had said he wouldn’t mind calling a date, if that was Dean’s preference.
“No, Mother.” Castiel swallowed around the annoyed knot in his throat. He knew that challenging his mother would get him nowhere but in her bad graces, and despite their somewhat strained relationship - Naomi had never been exactly what you’d call the mothering type - he still did not want his first night home to be tense and filled with hostile silence.
Once he's satisfied he's clean, Dean tosses the wadded up wipe into the trash can and kicks off his jeans and underwear from where Cas abandoned them pooling at his ankles. He pulls back the quilt and shimmies underneath.
“Yes, that.” Naomi smiled. “Honestly, I must say, Castiel, that your open preferences make this work so much easier.”
They very quietly slip into the house, with Castiel taking extra care to raise and lower the cart of the iris over the threshold to avoid making any noise. Dean takes the lead, with Castiel at his back, and leads the way through a modern kitchen, its cabinets open and in disarray. They slowly make their way forward, emerging in a dining room attached to a large living room.
“So get this,” Sam says as soon as they reenter the library. “I think I may have figured out a lead.”
Castiel unbuckled his seatbelt and reached into his trench pocket for his wallet. “What do I owe you?”
The thought is like a life giving fire in his soul - the very soul this man claimed and pulled out of hell - and the wave of love that washes over him makes his skin erupt in goosebumps.
“This is real,” Dean assures him, reaching out to take Cas’s face in his hands. Cas is looking right through him. “Cas, look at me.”
“I’m not saying he shouldn’t be.” Dean defends. “Hell, I’m pissed too that we came all this way for a whole lotta nothin’. But we can’t just give up. Me an’ him are gonna stop by the greenhouse where we bought the iris yesterday, see if the girl there knows anything. Natalia took all of her roses with her; she may have dropped some off there.”
“Dean, you are the most wanted bandit in the kingdom with a sizable bounty on your head. Most of the people out on that floor are people you’ve stolen from, Dean. Any one of them would love to see you hanged.”
“You really do think I’m stupid, don’t you?” Natalia says. She laughs. “Say goodbye to Dean Winchester, Castiel. You’ll see him again soon.”
“I–” Castiel struggled to understand what was going on. His mind was whirling in a thousand directions. “He–”
Jimmy had found masquerades to be the prime opportunity for mischief when they’d been boys. The two of them would dress alike, with matching masks, and cause all manner of mayhem. They’d steal buttons from waistcoats, tie the exposed laces of corsets in impossible and complicated knots, flick peas and kernels of corn into the pompadour wigs worn by some of the nobility from the southern regions of Novak, where such wigs were the height of fashion. As difficult as it was to tell them apart on a normal day, during a masque, it was absolutely impossible. So impossible was it, that after years of complaints from attendees at not being able to tell, exactly, which of the young twin princes it had been that had caused the calamity, their father had finally decided that they would wear different masks, setting them apart.
millennia old, and I've been human for nearly six months, with the internet at my disposal. I have...sought out certain entertainment for the purpose of sexual education multiple times.”
Dean is just putting the broom back in the utility closet down the hall from the kitchen, having finally cleaned up the last of the broken glass and pie from the floor, when he hears someone clear their throat behind him. He closes the door and turns to find Cas, the iris still in its cart at his side. Cas looks embarrassed, still caked in mud. He won’t meet Dean’s eyes.
In that second, it's as if the final piece clicks into place, and Dean’s entire world feels whole for the first time in his entire damn life. He feels tears pricking at the corners of his eyes as Cas continues to kiss him, and he brings a hand to the back of Cas’s head to keep him there as Cas snakes his hand between their bodies and takes hold of his cock. He jacks Dean off slowly, with each movement like a sacrament, meant only for the two of them.
Castiel, heart set steady with purpose, turned on his heel and marched out of the garden, setting his sights on the palace prisons.
“Hush.” Castiel said softly. “This isn’t your fault. It’s mine. I should have made you leave the moment I saw you in that ballroom. I never should have indulged you in a dance, no matter how badly I wanted it.”
“Exactly!” Sam says. “It's all a little too much of a coincidence. So what I'm guessing is, Marjorie may have royally pissed off somebody at that contest, and if I had to guess, that someone had ties to some powerful witchcraft.”
Natalia chuckles. “Right, like I’m supposed to believe that, coming from a cohort of the Winchesters?” She smirks. “Poor little optimistic Castiel. Your fall from Grace must have hit you hard on that little noggin of yours, because I’m not going to let you or Dean live.” She steps forward. “Here’s what’s going to happen: I’m going to kill Dean and the little bitch in the cornerㅡ” She nods to Brandie, who’s still unconscious. “ㅡand then I’m going to take what’s left of my iris and let you wallow in their blood before whatever happens to you happens. Don’t worry; you won’t suffer long. Word on the street is, old Marjorie died instantly when that bookend fell on her sweet little head. With any luck,  you’ll just fall and break your neck and it will all be over.”
“Let’s go check out the house, then the garage, see if we can find anything.” Dean suggests. He reaches out and takes Castiel’s hand, squeezing it gently, but firmly, and Castiel feels the heady rush of warmth and affection in his chest again.
“Well, either way, looks like we’re headed back into Hastings tomorrow.” Dean wipes his mouth on a napkin and takes a long drink of beer.
“Anytime, Dean. See you around.” Kevin said. He looked past Dean at Cas, and his eyes got comically wide. “Holy shit, uh…”
Dean puts a finger to his lips to indicate quiet as he slowly turns the doorknob of the backdoor. As soon as the latch bolt and strike plate are clear, he lets go and reaches for the pistol in his pants. Castiel places a hand on the gun at his hip, ready to pull it at a moment’s notice, deciding to keep his angel blade in the holster, should he be unable to reach his gun in an emergency.
Dean chuckled and bowed, offering Castiel his arm. “Well, then,” he said. “Let’s go make them jealous.”
Cas pays particular attention to his nipples, which he had always loved having played with but had never been able to readily admit to. He moans in encouragement.
She rolled up the parchment and slipped it back into her sleeve. She stepped back and nodded to the two guards holding onto Dean’s arms. One guard, who Castiel recognized as Gadreel, cut the rope binding Dean’s wrists together and the two of them led him forward. Gadreel delivered a swift kick to the back of Dean’s legs, and he fell, hard, onto his knees. The other guard grasped Dean by the hair and pushed his head down against the block and held him there while Gadreel strapped Dean’s wrists into the leather cuffs on either side of the block, tightening them with quick, hard jerks, and Castiel saw Dean wince as the cuffs rubbed against the raw and bruised skin.
, in this moment with Cas coaxing him through the aftershocks of his orgasm, come painting both of their chests and Dean panting like he's just run for his life.
“Coupla years ago, me an’ Sam found out a cursed object had been stolen from one of our dad’s lockups, a rabbit’s foot. It granted the person in possession of it unlimited good luck, but as soon as they got rid of it or lost it, the luck ran out, and they died, usually pretty bloody.” Dean says. He shudders slightly. “Anyway, it hexed Sam, and when he lost it, bad luck followed him everywhere. A damn AC unit caught on fire from him just
“Meh,” Gabriels shrugged. “You know I have my critics out there. It doesn’t matter how hard I try, how many big words I use in my speeches and whatnot, there are always gonna be those that think I’m nothing but a big doofus.”
Castiel sighed as he used the small remote control to turn off the sound on the small television screen in the corner, slumping down into his seat a little further. He massaged the bridge of his nose with one hand, trying to drown out the noise of his mother’s incessant chatter in the background.
Castiel sighed and opened his eyes, fishing through his pocket. His phone was lit up with over a dozen text messages, all from his friends in New York wishing him well, and a safe flight home. These were several hours old however; the cause of the offending chime was a text from his friend Balthazar.
He watched their pilgrimage into town until they all came to stand closely together at the edge of the crowd. Bobby had his arm around Ellen’s shoulder, Ellen looking completely stone faced and like she was barely keeping it together  as she gazed upon the platform where her adopted son would lose his life. Jody and Donna each held the small hands of their girls, Claire and Alex, and Castiel could see that Donna was wiping away tears. Kevin and Jo leaned silently against one another, taking comfort in the other’s presence, while Charlie, Eileen, and Sam came up the rear, making it easy for Sam to make a clear getaway, should he be spotted and recognized. Castiel felt a pang of guilt, of something akin to shame as he watched them; he should be with them, offering them comfort, explaining what it was he was about to attempt. But he didn’t; moving would compromise the position he’d carefully mapped out and claimed in the crowd, and Castiel could not afford to take the chance of being unable to reach the dais in time should he move. Instead, he watched the friends he had come to consider family as they huddled together in the cold rain as they waited for their friend, comrade, leader, son, and brother to be brought forth to meet his death.
look pale, Castiel; perhaps you should retire for the evening. This all must have come as quite a shock to you. I could see that you were enjoying yourself; I saw the two of you kissing.” She set a hand on Castiel’s arm. “What transpired tonight was not your fault. He lied to you. He was going to take
“This works better.” He says, pulling out a wipe and using it to clean himself off. He tosses the pack to the other man, who catches it with ease.
“Whoa, whoa, who said anything about disgracing anybody?” Gabe held up his hands. “Calm your tits, baby bro. It’ll be fine. If anybody’s gonna disgrace this family, it’s gonna be me.”
“You see, Dean,” Natalia says as she stalks towards him like a lion hunting prey in tall grasses. “I’m not like all those other little penny witches you’ve killed in the past.” She grins. “I’m smart. I play my cards right. I live under the radar. I’ve been here in Hastings for the last ten years, and I never tipped any hunters off, did I? No, because
He got to the corner of 18th and September St. just in time to see a grey Prius pull up to the curb. Castiel jogged towards it, and a young woman with purple hair leaned out of the window.
The percolator stops, and Dean pours coffee into the three mugs. He puts a napkin over Sam’s, and scoops up his and Cas’s mugs, heading back towards his room.
Dean mumbled under his breath as he passed through the doors into the kitchen, a few choice words slipping out of his mouth. Kevin, one of the kitchen staff, looked up in alarm.
Just before the door closed, Tessa could be heard screeching from inside, “WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT WAS THE PRINCE?!”
“Fuck yes,” he breathes, and Cas kisses him as he fumbles at Dean’s belt. He eventually manages to free it and drags the zipper down; even though it all only takes a few seconds, each one is agonizing to Dean. Cas moves to copy Dean’s earlier conquests on his throat, and he moans when he feels teeth sink into the fleshy part of his neck where it connects to his shoulder.
to tell a single soul of my being here, and if you do, I will personally see to it that you never see the light of day again. Is that clear?”
He has no doubt in his mind that this yard had once been a teeming, verdant garden, groomed to perfection. Now it is like a desecrated graveyard.
“Don’t hesitate to call Jody if you need to.” Dean said, untying the back of his apron and slipping it over his head, using it to towel off his still coffee-damp hair.
Dean led the way across the large parking lot behind the strip where Andrea’s was nestled, towards his Baby, parked at the far back of the lot.
The crowd cheered, but Castiel could not find a single ounce of even fraudulent joy within him to join in.
“That's not the point, Dean.” Sam says, his voice laced with annoyance at his older brother's jabs. “It's about variety.”
“Well, see,” Dean starts without missing a beat. He gestures to Cas. “This guy here is a botany professor for the University of Michigan, and he's doin’ a research study on the attachment styles of plants.”
“ーused in hex bags, I know.” Dean finishes for him. “Did you ever check the iris’ pot for a hex bag?”
“I’m suggesting more than that.” Gabriel said. “I’m suggesting that you don’t have any other choice, unless you plan to execute every single person on this platform today, including our own brother.”
In the kitchen, Dean grabs three mugs from the shelf while he waits for the coffee to percolate. He spoons two heaps of sugar in his, and fills the bottom of Cas’s mug with honey and a splash of milk, just the way Cas likes it. Sam prefers his straight black, so he leaves the mug for Sam alone. He glances at the little clock on the wall by the door, which reads 10:26; he and Cas had slept almost ten hours.
“I most certainly do, darling.” She said sweetly. “You have no idea what I’m capable of, but I assure you it’s nothing less than make your life a living hell.”
The next tickets win them $6,000 and $8,000 respectively. Dean whistles as he looks at the tickets; Cas clicks the pocketknife closed and tosses it back into the glovebox.
Dean has never worshipped anything in his life, never given over his mind, body, and soul to something much bigger than him, until this moment. But right now, he whispers praise into Cas’s skin like it's a prayer, a benediction. He touches the former angel like he's something precious, something that could crumble to dust with a single breath, something holy and beautiful.
“None of this is your fault, Dean.” Castiel assured him. “I shouldn’t have lost track of time. I’ll calm Bela down, explain everything to my parents. All will be taken care of.”
“Cas, I’m dying tomorrow. And shit, I don’t know what’s waiting for me on the other side, but whatever it is, wherever I’m going, heaven or hell, I’m going to miss you.” Dean spoke frankly, eyes boring into Castiel’s. “Fuck, I’m so glad I met you. I’m so glad I bought you that drink at the pub. I’m so glad I got to love you.”
Castiel’s mask was of a much less frivolous nature than Dean’s. Simple and clean cut, it was made of black satin and raven’s feathers, flared as though in flight, which would occasionally flash blue and purple in the right lighting.
Kissing whilst wearing masks was a bit of a challenge, but Castiel soon found the correct angle, their respective feathers commingling. This was far from the first time he’d kissed Dean, and Dean had kissed him, but somehow this seemed different, and a thrill of excitement went through him as his bandit kissed back with fervor. It almost felt taboo, kissing in front of all these people, where no one knew who Dean was but him. It was invigorating.
Once Gadreel was satisfied that Dean could not escape from the cuffs, and had no means of jerking up and away from the block itself, he and the other guard stepped back and nodded to Hannah, who had turned to face her commander, Gabriel.
“I don’t wanna know.” He says quickly. “But, uh, it’s good you’re here, because I found Natalia Jennings’ address.”
, with him. He was here, in a sea of people who wanted nothing more than to see Dean dead, and they had no idea who he was. And he’d come here to make sure Castiel was alright, that he was not alone. The thought made Castiel’s heart soar, despite the trepidation that still tapped at his conscience.
The majority of this group were innocent, and Castiel knew that Naomi knew it, knew that she could see that what they had done, what Castiel had done, had not been an act of defiance. That they were not treasonous traitors intent on creating a coup, but were instead a family, desperate to save one of their own.
“Okay then,” Dean says softly as he digs into the pocket of his jacket. “We’ll do this the hard way.” He pulls out his lock picks, and carefully selects one from the kit. “Watch my back for me, Cas.” He says, and carefully sets to work.
Natalia growls and releases Dean’s jaw, holding out her other hand. With the flick of her wrist, she flings Brandie across the room like a rag doll. The girl hits the side of the brick wall and crumples to the ground; as she does, she yanks the cart containing the iris after her, and it falls from the cart to the ground, where the pot shatters against the poured concrete pathway.
“And you know what? I’m taking that iris with me. And I’m willing to bet your little angel friend over there’s been cursed by it, hasn’t he? So what’s going to happen when I take it away, hm? What...unfortunate accident will befall him? A car hitting him as he crosses the street? He trips over a crack in the sidewalk and brains himself on the curb?” Her hazel eyes glint with malicious mirth. “Or maybe I’ll just take him with me? He may not be an angel anymore, but I’m sure he still has...uses.” She laughs lowly, and Dean feels dread permeate through the haze her grip on his neck has left him wading through at the thought of this bitch hurting Cas. Rage builds with it, swelling into the corners of his instincts, and he snarls at her.
Dean drags his eyes away from Cas, damn it he was staring again. Way to be subtle Dean. Although Dean supposed that getting caught staring wasn't the worst thing. He was always finding his eyes drawn to the other, but Cas never said anything and if he did maybe it would be the breakthrough he wanted, a way to get Cas to confront him so that he didn't have to find a way to start the horrifying torturous conversation with emotions and feelings and all the things Dean has spent his entire life avoiding.
Sam had to resist the urge to roll his eyes. Dean could be as delusional as he wanted Sam wasn't letting him out of this one. "About what you told me that night, about how you feel."
Shoulders dropping, Dean raised his hands, fingers grasping through the air as if looking for something he could grasp onto to keep himself from falling into the abyss of self-hatred and pain. He had
Upon seeing Dean's pouting face, Sam exhaled loudly. "And what about Cas? We can't just leave him here alone, he has no idea how to function as a human. Let alone how to defend himself without his powers. What if something goes wrong?"
"I missed you." Dean's not sure why he repeated it, but it's all he can think about. Cas is back and suddenly everything is easier again. Tears began to rise in his eyes and for once Dean doesn't try to stop them instead he turns burying his face into Cas' neck. "I missed you." He mumbled against Cas' skin.
Checking both directions of the hallway Dean sighed and headed towards the bunker's kitchen. Sam's been trying to talk to Dean. However, he hasn't been successful. Dean always sees him and flees back to his or rather Cas's room before he can stop him. He's tried talking to Dean through the lock door on multiple occasions and all it ever earns him is blared rock music. Realistically Dean knows that he can't hide from Sam forever, or from his feelings or the reality of cas' ... of what happened to Cas, that Cas is gone, really gone this time.
"So what happened?" Cas tilted his head again and no matter how much Dean didn't want to, he couldn't help but think it was adorable.
Cas smiled at the ground, a sad sort of smile, the smile one has when looking through memories of long lost friendships. “I know you care and that’s why you do the things you do.” A harsh shaky inhale, and a stuttering of words. “But sometimes it's hard for me to
He wasn't giving up, he was going to tell him eventually. Maybe. God, the thought was horrifying but if there was a chance that he could get even closer to Cas. A chance that Cas might feel the same way, well then maybe it’s worth the risk. All he needs is a little more time.
"Are you sure?" Bracing his arm on the back of his chair, Dean turned to face Sam. "If Jody's called for help it's gotta be something bad."
Retracting his hand Sam accidentally brushes his fingers along the length of cas' forearm, Dean growls from the back of his throat low and gravely and though Sam knows he's in no real danger he can't help but jump back startled by the images of hellhounds the sound brought forth.
Pointing in front of him to where a man was twirling a stick along the edges of the machine where sugar was twirling, weaving around the stick in tight threads, Dean asked. "Okay pick a colour. Blue or pink?"
"Okay that's good." Dean whispered breath ghosting across Cas' ear. "But you're gonna want to take your left hand and move it a little lower."
Despite the previous warning, Cas turned to look at the trees blurring passed the side of the car. "I don't think I want to."
"Oh uh," Cas cleared his throat as he pushed himself upwards flipping over so he was now lying on his back beside Dean "Hello, I am sorry I just woke up like that."
Dean tilted his head to the side in thoughtful ponder. "I’ve never heard many stories from before we met."
"Dean." Blinking, Dean's vision began to refocus. "Are you okay? Your breathing has raised exponentially in the last few seconds."
Stepping forward, Dean smiled bigger than he had in days, big enough that in only a few seconds his cheeks were already beginning to ache. "Welcome home, pal."
"Nothing I just ugh…. you've been having a tough go", Sam squeezed Dean's shoulder, "so it's good to see you smile."
Cas' shoulders tensed and he spoke through clenched teeth. "I'm fine." Dean looked between Cas and his brother, who simply shrugged.
Forcing himself to face what he’s been hiding for years, he lifted his gaze back up to Cas’. “I have been for years.”
He wasn't sure where he was, the ground was hard and solid underneath his hands and he was surrounded by trees that seemed to tower over him and mock his weakness.
Dean laughed, throwing one arm around Cas' shoulder and drawing him into his side. “Ah see you have nothing to worry about, still the same old Cas. Besides, we're safe right now so at least for the moment you can at least try and relax a little.”
"I think I've found something." Sam announced, turning his laptop around to face Dean. Looking up from the book he was totally paying attention to, Dean scanned the article. In one corner there was a picture of a young woman, early twenties, dark straight brown hair and a flowy floral top. The other held a long column of text. 'Young girl claims that an angel of the lord spoke to her about her role in God's will'.
He turned away from the sky, noticing something black and shiny across the field. Curious, he stepped slowly towards the object. There was something familiar about its silhouette.
Dean thought Cas was beautiful, it wasn’t usually a word he thought of in regards to men, but it suited Cas. He was heart achingly beautiful, in a way that made Dean's chest constrict and his breath to feel like fire. Sometimes Cas’ gaze felt sharp and powerful and Dean felt like if he moved in the wrong way he could get cut in its edges, but sometimes Cas’ gaze was soft and comforting in a way that reminded Dean of lazy morning ocean waves and the summer skies of his long past and rare happy childhood days.
Cas tries to pull his arm back, but Dean is determined, tightening his grip around Cas' forearm, trench coat wrinkling around his fingers. “Why would?” Cas’ eyebrows furrow, as he struggles to make words form around his downturned lips. “What?”
A scream came echoing through the heavy silence startling Sam who still wasn't able to close his gapping mouth glanced over at his brother; Dean's eyes were unblinking staring ahead his mouth seemed to be moving though no words were leaving it. He hated to leave Dean here, not now, not when Dean was so unfocused that anything could catch him off guard. He couldn't lose him too.
Dean knew that he wouldn't be able to sleep, terrified of the nightmares that would accompany him. Instead he sat down in one of the smaller rooms in the bunker.
"Hey," Dean struggled not to turn and look at Cas, he knew if he started looking at him it would be hard to stop and then he wouldn't be watching the road and Cas would yell at him. And well he wanted today to go well and preferably that included as little grumpy Cas as possible, even if he was kinda cute with his little grumpy pout. "Have you picked a tape yet?"
Dean waited in the heavy silence of the night only interrupted by his harsh breaths. He layed back down staring at his ceiling, thinking. When his breaths evened out and he could no longer hear the blood rushing to his ears and he was left abandoned in the empty dark silence of the night, he pushed himself off his bed. He didn’t want to be alone. He was sick of being alone of pulling himself back. God he’d almost told Cas how he felt so many times and yet he always backed away at the last possible second. He was sick of hiding, of running.
Cas snorted and Dean glared in return and suddenly Dean realised that maybe they can get through this, because he no longer feels crushed by the weight of expectations.
A small groan interrupted him, followed by the sensation of something dragging along his shoulder and onto his neck.
Breathing was odd, he thought. He was always told that humans did it subconsciously and well he supposed that was true, when something went wrong he could feel each desperate needy inhale as if it was grating his throat with sandpaper.
"Dean", Sam's shoulders shrug and he takes several small steps closer to where Dean's sitting elbows resting on the table. "Do you want to talk about it?"
"Because Cas, it's the experience. Besides, look at them," Dean gestured to the stuffed animals in Cas' arms, "they're adorable." He picked one up a purple stuffed teddy, swaying it side to side in the air just below Cas' face. "Come on Cas', are you going to tell me that you don't find them adorable? Do you not have a soul?"
Dean laughed, banging his hand on the table. "Okay so we know not to give you bananas  in the future. See we're learning, making progress, all that fun jazz."
A small smile spread on Dean's lips as he made an extravagant gesture down at himself, leaning his weight back onto one palm. "What do you think, this skill just happened overnight?"
Cas lips lifted a little, not noticeable to anyone else but immeasurably valuable to Dean. "I missed you too. Though where I was I had no real measure of time."
Dean lowered both his hands to the wheel, making sure to place them at ten and two. "Fine, I’ll be more careful."
"Oh come on," Dean used his elbow to poke Cas in the side. "You enjoy spending time with me, everyone does."
“What, not exciting enough for you?” Dragging Cas closer, Dean lifted his arm up, pushing Cas in a circle, spinning him in and out. Cas laughed, filling the empty air of the bunker with a lightness. Dean smiled wide and bright. “Come on” His lips softened as undeniable fondness slipped into his voice. Tightening his hold on Cas, he spun them in circles across the kitchen, a crazy whirlwind of haphazard steps.
Reaching into his pocket, Cas pulled out two tickets stubs, the ones Dean and him had run out of time to use at the carnival. He started at their crinkled edges and where the lettering hadn't stamped correctly cutting off the ends of the words. Delicately he placed them in the corner of the box.
Cas turned and began filling his cup. "Cas, I know you just got back, but Sam found a case nearby. It seems to be a small vamp nest, shouldn't take more than a couple days. Do you want to come?"
Dean froze bile rising in his throat. "Of course I missed you Cas, you're my best friend." Dean rubbed the back of his neck forcing his eyes away from the picture on the bed, Dean's arm around Cas and one of his far to rare laughs. "Besides, it's boring when you're not around and I'm stuck with nothing but my brother and unreasonable piles of research."
Cas looked at him eyes wide and startled like he's never bothered to consider how Dean might interpret his reactions about the inferior nature of mankind. "No. Of course not Dean, you and Sam, you're the strongest people I know."
“Hey” Dean leaned to the side, torso tilting as he tried to force his face into Cas’ line of sight. “I understand. Take as long as you need.”
Silence weighs heavy, pushing on Dean's chest knocking the already wheezy breath from his lungs. His heart is pounding, deafening in his head, but it still isn’t as loud as
"No. You're... you're dead." Dean flinched at the words of his brother already forgetting he was even there.
"No," Dean waved his hand dismissively through the air, "not just... we should hang out more, just us."
"I’ll come." Dean smiled. It wasn't really the romantic setting he was hoping for, but he was glad that he would get to spend a few days alone with Cas and several vampires, but they didn't really matter anyway.
Switching on the lightbulb, Dean had to cover his eyes with his forearm and blink several times before his vision cleared well enough for him to make out more than vague shapes. Despite how long Dean tried to convince Cas that decorating the room and trying to make it distinctly his was important. Which only ever got him a confused head tilt and "But why would possessions and pictures make the room mine? I already know that it's mine, because you said that I could stay here and angels don't have possessions." The room still only had the same white walls and mattress as the others. Dean didn't care because he knew this was Cas's room, knew that he should be in it right now doing whatever he did when he wasn't sleeping instead of floating somewhere in broken pieces of ash.
Cas groaned, grabbing his head. He gasped, throat rough. It was hard to think with the pounding in his head and the burning pain in his back.
Dean's voice is rough as it grates along his throat, regoregitated words on sandpaper. He reaches his hand out clamping around Cas' shoulder, pulling him close.
“So,” Dean started, clearing his throat, “is there something you know that’s stopping you from sleeping?”
Dean froze, waiting several seconds for Cas’ face to relax and his breathing to fall back into a steady rhythm. He pushed Cas’ hair out of his eyes, fingers running across his forehead as delicately as butterflies legs ran along grass. Maybe things would turn out okay. Maybe they could make it through this. They’d managed to make it through everything else. They just had to keep moving forward together and things might work out this time.
Cas glared up at him from where he was struggling not to retch, heavy breathing, as he clutched the sighed of the railing.
Cas breathed deeply a concept still foreign to him and pulled his finger back releasing the power of the gun.
Dean chuckled but the sound was hollow, evaporating to nothing in the windy air. "I'm fine, just this thing goes higher than I thought."
Dean had seen Lucifer kill or at least graciously maim enough people near him to know that there was no way this was going to end well. He couldn't lose Cas not now. Not with everything else changing in his life, not that was new everything always seemed to be changing around him. But even though Cas had betrayed them, even though he'd abandoned him and Sam more times then Dean thought he could forgive, he had always been there for Dean when he needed him, one way or another.
Cas lowered his arms stepping away from Dean. Dean shivered already missing the warmth. Unsure what he should do with his arms, Dean lifted them, wrapping them around himself before giving up and dropping them altogether. coughing, he takes a couple steps back. “Yeah,” he rubbed the back of his neck, “we should head back to the motel and we can start driving back to the bunker first thing in the morning.”
A cymbole rung echoing through the air, before the music cut out, drifting to static. They’ve stopped moving, but neither stepped away. Grip tight as they looked at one another struggling to catch the oxygen drifting through the air.
Dean laughed. "Man you gotta learn to capitalise on your revival. Try and get as much out of it as you can. I'm not likely to offer again." Although Dean wasn't sure that was true, all his previous rules and thoughts had changed so much because of Cas. He didn't think he'd ever truly be able to say no to anything he asked for, even if was as dumb choosing what music played.
"Well," Cas ran his hands along the railing, fingers grating along the bumps and cracks of orange sunset rust and chipped blue paint. "there is always a lot we are dealing with."
"What?" Dean placed one hand over his ear and used the other to point his middle finger at his brother. "Can't hear you".
"Well, I'm unsure how he is doing grace wise as there is very little written about nephilim siphoned from archangel parents. Emotionally he seems the same as before."
Dean laughed pounding at his own chest to stop from spluttering his mouth full of beer. “It’s not. I told you Cas, I’m no role model.”
Dean shrugged. “What choice do you have? You could sit there wallowing in the possibilities or you can try and realise how stupid they are and live by distracting yourself from them.”
Careful not to hurt any of the tapes, Cas placed the box back into the glove compartment. "It was one of the only ones I recognised."
Groaning, Cas stretched his back muscles aching from a long night of sleep. His face dragged along something warm and squishy. It took a while for his brain to adjust to his environment. Waking up was disorienting and therefore frightening to Castiel, who had rarely had moments like that. Last night he had gone to Dean and Dean had offered that he could-
"Hey," Dean knocked on Cas' door dragging his boots heavily along the carpet. "Me and Sam found something. Might be a lead, might not. We figure it's worth checking out in case we can get any more info on the whole angle sitch."
"First things first." Dean announced wrapping his hand around the back of Cas' headrest to look around his chair and carefully pull Baby out of his oh so perfect parking job if he does stay so himself. Pulling his arm back, correcting the wheel and driving out of the bunker Dean turned towards Cas. "Music. Every good road trip needs music. So come on, pull out the box from the glove compartment and hand it here."
He sighed, opening his mouth before closing it and shaking his head, unsure of what to say. There were so many thoughts rushing through his head, images of the past, the good and the bad between him and Cas. Sam’s words before he left. He wasn’t sure what to say.
Cas stared down at the array of food on the table, there were hashbrowns, and several different types of eggs and waffles, and French toast, pancakes and an unreasonably high pile of bacon. His eyes widened and his fingers ran repetitively over his hands clearly overwhelmed.
Pausing the movement of his mug to his lips, Cas looked up at Dean, eyebrows furrowed. "But you are already a role model."
Dean laughs and Cas can't decide if he wants to stay here forever or if he wants to smoother Dean for being so obnoxiously beautiful. He forces himself to turn onto his side, determined to miss the way Dean throws his head back and the stupid snort falls from his lips.
