“Sher-” John cried out again, and something in Sherlock's gut twisted. He'd put John in danger twice in a matter of minutes. He had worked his mind palace overtime to make sure that the combination was right, and God his stomach clenched, trusting John to duck in time as the safe door swung open. Sherlock grabbed the railing harder, using that to propel him up four stairs at a time and still not sound like an elephant or, more importantly, give his position away.
“Very well. Would you prefer me to move?”
“Unimportant,” Sherlock answered.
“Well, let me tell you that this Captain would love to see you at dinner with me tonight. Maybe we can head to your place afterwards, hear some of that violin?”
“Go ahead and hand me the phone,” Sherlock told John as he started to pull the phone from his loosening grasp. But as Sherlock gripped his wrist, John jerked awake, making several distressed noises before he pushed roughly against Sherlock, falling backwards and giving a pained groan.
“I think I could get used to this very quickly. What do you think?”
Sherlock heard a noise as he turned around, followed by a thud. The voice was too low to be Irene's, and the lack of any noise after that confirmed his earlier hesitation: Irene had managed to surprise John. Without any delay, he dashed for the stairs.
Dinner turned out magnificently, or so John would always recall. Sherlock would always say that the meal could have been better, had John allowed him to take them to a nicer restaurant, but John had insisted on Angelo’s. This time, they appreciated the candle, and had repeated their initial conversation, albeit with a different ending. After dinner, they returned to 221b, where Sherlock delivered on his promise of a concerto. And for quite some time, the flat was filled with the beautiful sounds of Sherlock’s violin. It wasn’t until after he finished that John confessed that he had no idea what Sherlock had been playing, but that he thoroughly enjoyed it. Sherlock beamed at his boyfriend, informing him that it was something he’d written long ago for John. After that, the night was a blur of kisses and touches. But both men clearly remembered waking up in the same bed the next morning, wrapped in each others embrace.
And then John flushed a deep red.
“Dammit,” he swore before his eyes caught on his coat, laying over John's chair. He grabbed at the coat, finding his phone in the wrong pocket. He'd received a text from a new number, obviously Ms. Adler's.
Sherlock’s pulse jumped as he slowly moved forward, closing the distance between them. And when their lips touched, it was better than Sherlock had dreamed. Before too long, Sherlock had to break the kiss, and both men breathed a little harder.
“So, what had you bounding out of my arms?”
“Good, they sent someone competent. I know this isn't your typical precinct, so you can tell Mycroft I have the phone.” Greg turned to issue an order, so Sherlock paused. When he was sure he had Greg's attention again, he continued. “I can tell you my part of the story on the car ride home and at 221b, depending on how long it takes, but I need to head back there. Two of the four witnesses are up there. There are three Americans, one of whom is dead in the sitting room there. The third witness is on the run, but you wouldn't be able to get any additional information out of her,” Sherlock rattled off. Greg quickly sent more men to the sitting room while he and Sherlock went upstairs. When they reached their destination, Sherlock crossed back over to where John was. Fortunately, he hadn't moved, but Lestrade seemed more interested in making sure that Kate was unharmed.
“Why'm I like this?”
“I wasn’t going to have our first kiss interrupted by doctors worrying over your heart’s condition.” With that reminder, John blushed before moving his hand from Sherlock’s grasp to his cheek.
“If you weren’t heterosexual, why did you never date any men? London is a large city, I’m sure there are many men would have been flattered by your attention.”
“True. Buh we always make it out.” John's eyes were drooping, and he was starting to show several signs of fatigue.
“I’d be more than flattered for dinner, Dr. Watson.” Sherlock couldn’t help but tell the truth. “But for now, you need to rest. They won’t let you out of the hospital for a few more hours.”
“Either way, we can discuss this more tomorrow. Rest for now.” Seemingly satisfied, John settled back down to sleep.
“Smart move, putting the phone on your loyal guard dog.”
“That will be all Lestrade,” Sherlock said, hoping his tone was dismissive enough to keep the Detective Inspector from arguing with him.
“Would that rope hold both of us?” Irene questioned. “I would assume those heavy, well-built men came in one after another, which may have weakened the anchoring point. I have no desire to use it and fall halfway through our descent.” Softly sighing, John went over to inspect the rope, checking that no one was watching first. Giving a few sturdy tugs, he felt confident that it would hold both of their weight.
“No,” he managed. She stepped towards him, giving him three lashes to the other arm. His military training took over, and he braced himself for more pain, still gripping the phone.
“You said that you were married to your work all that time ago. Why should I ever believe that I had a chance?”
John stretched lightly in bed, forehead creasing as he realized he wasn’t in his bed in 221b. John opened his eyes, and for a few moments, Sherlock could believe that he was right, that John hadn’t remembered anything. That maybe this secret would stay secret. That this weakness, this inability to say 'no’ to Captain John Watson, his flatmate and best friend, would stay hidden, so that no one could ever wield John against Sherlock.
----------
“You have a crime scene to piece together for your men and I am more than capable of taking care of John. The most concerning part is the psychoactive drugs, and those should wear off by morning.” Sherlock bent down, making a more thorough examination of John in front of Lestrade. “Pupils are reacting well, seems like he's starting to come out of his stupor.
One week….
He locked the bedroom door as he slipped back in and dropped his robe in the chair, the night chill prickling his bare frame.
“No! You have no idea what I feel! You despised your brother,” he chuckled darkly. “Probably because you know he was smarter than you,” he pointed an accusatory finger at the arrogant man. “He was better than you in every way that matted, and I let him di….” John’s eyes were wide and wet when he realized what he was saying.
Hurrying to the fire escape John quickly descended the ladder and crossed the street.
Sherlock was the first to speak as their giddy mood receded. ‘You know I thought you’d be more curious about all this.’ His eyes wandered around the room.
The doctor shook his head and walked over to the cat, patting it’s feather soft head.
‘Honestly, I’m just so glad to see you alive.’
Molly kissed her quickly and stood to grab their coats, helping Irene in to hers, before slipping on her own and offering The Woman her arm.
‘Acha,’ (2) he breathed.
‘You need to wake up John, now.’
John began sliding his hands around the forcefield. ‘There has to be a way to break through this...wall.’
‘Jesus,’ John shouted as he cradled his hand from the floor.
Sherlock’s frivolous mood died quickly, his smile falling into a frown. ‘John, you can’t be here. I don’t know why she brought you here but…,’ his keen blue eyes darted around the room with an edge of fear that John didn't see very often.
His lips were soft and warm when he touched them to his own.
John’s hand pressed at his heart, “and I need you.” It was a fierce whisper.
Mary was pretty, kind, smart, and not Sherlock.
The blogger suddenly felt very old. He couldn’t even speak the man’s name. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath before quickly dressing grabbing his keys and following the little black cat out into the night.
Suddenly Chubby burst in to a sprint and the soldier had no time to think as he took off after her.
A deep, not wholly human sounding, growl was his reply and John wanted to panic.
He sat there for a while, letting his tears dampen his jumper, but the familiar ache in his knee let him know it was time to move on, at least for today.
‘Um, I don’t think I’m going to fit through there kitty,’ John chuckled.
‘Forget that you saw me, forget that you came here, forget the damned cat and go.’
‘Oh John…,’ he whispered, his voice deeper than the doctor knew was possible. ‘You shouldn’t have done that…..’
‘John’
‘What...no….’
‘No, no no no you don’t get to just dismiss me. Not after…,’ his voice began to rise with his anger. ‘Not after….’
The reaction was instant.
John on the other hand ignored every single warning bell going off in his head. But he knew in his gut that, even if he were burnt to a cinder by the blazing light that surrounded the posh man standing in front of him, he was going to cross that line.
‘You don’t need to understand, just leave!’
He approached Sherlock’s room silently and eased the door open.
Trust.
They’d had more than love once.
John turned on his heel, reaching for the gun he kept tucked in the back of his trousers.
His second was, ‘Sweet Jesus I’m kissing Sherlock bloody Holmes!’
Just then a muted crash came from down the hall.
“Piss off Mycroft,” John shouted, startling the older man.
With the next slam the sparks didn’t stop and Sherlock put his hands back on the wall.
“No,” he spoke quietly.
‘Sherlock how...wha….’
“I get you all to myself for forty eight whole hours,” Greg whispered stroking Mycroft’s chin.
‘Sher...Sherlock....,’ he whispered already creeping down the hall.
‘Sh...Sherlock,’ the doctor panted when his monster’s lips nipped along his jaw.
There was a strange blue light coming from under the door at the end of the hall he found at the top of the stairs and John looked down at his furry companion for guidance, but the cat was gone. He turned around in a half circle; he’d definitely chased it up here.
“Thank you for joining us Mr. Holmes,” a sharp green eyed blond woman spoke first and Mycroft nodded.
“Still resort to sweets I see,” a playful voice quipped from the doorway.
The British government was silent for another half block before he disturbed the doctor’s wandering thoughts.
Sherlock’s eyes were on his bare feet. ‘Moriarty,’ he began and John’s eyes widened. ‘He had assassins waiting for Lestraud and Mrs. Hudson...and you.’ The detective met his soldier’s eyes, ‘he was going to kill everyone I care about in this world.’ Sherlock took a step forward. ‘I wasn't going to let that happen.’
‘Now look here you arrogant sod, I’m not leaving...not without you.’
He rapped lightly but received no answer save for a meow from the other side.
He chuckled as he followed the tinkling bell just as the closet door slowly swung open.
‘I'm sorry John,’ the taller man looked down at his hands. ‘I know you have a lot of questions, but I can't answer most of them. I just...needed to see you,’ he met his friends eyes. ‘I was told you weren't fairing very well and I hold myself responsible.’
“Out for a stroll Dr. Watson?”
Mycroft took a deep breath through his nose and kept his features calm, his eyes flitting to the earthy brown skinned, shamrock green eyed woman to his right.
John stepped farther into the living room until his loafer clad toes just breached the circle of light on the floor.
He looked around then, suddenly realizing he had no idea when or how he’d gotten back to baker street.
‘It’s been months Bunny, where the hell have you been,’ John complained as he toweled her off. ‘You’ve come to take me to see him yea,’ he asked as he dried her fuzzy black head.
John thought he would vomit.
(See the end of the chapter for
John stared, mouth slack in shock as he stepped farther into the room. The raven curls shimmered as they were jostled by an unknown breeze.
John’s first thought as he surged forward past the blazing ring of light was, ‘I was right! It burns!’
The detective swallowed his partners moan as John slowly bucked in to his grasp.
‘Sherlock,’ John chuckled. ‘Look, I know that I’m dreaming, but I also know that you are,  in some way, alive. If you’re being held against your will somehow just give the word.’
“Bloody hell,” he panted from the floor.
‘John...John stop!’
“Dr. Watson,” Mycroft began calmly.
Author’s note: In this version of what happens after The Reichenbach Fall, none of the characters aside from Mycroft, Lestrade, and a speckle of non cannon characters know how Sherlock survived the fall.
John sighed again and stood. ‘Why do cats do that, just knock things over.’ He placed the folded clothing back in it’s pile and turned. ‘No reason, just making a mess because you’re boar….’
‘John stop! We can speak but you must stay there. Stay out of the light. Stay back or I'll have to leave, do you understand?’
Sherlock kissed him, slowly, before quickly latching on to the doctor’s neck, coiling around him like a snake. John’s thighs spread wide to accommodate the larger man, and he arched into the sensation as heat spread from Sherlock’s many sharp teeth through his veins.
Irene stepped back, “where else on earth could I possibly be.”
The doctor frowned but nodded.
“True!” Irene smiled, plucking a tissue from a nearby box to better clean Molly’s face. “But there’s nowhere else i’d rather be.” She fully handed the tissue to Molly, “go on and blow”.
John covered his ears.
Her fur moved like black fire around her, and it took him a minute to realize her little mouth was open in a loud meow. A moment later the sound reached him and he squinted his eyes shut tight as the meow slowly shifted in to a deafening roar.
‘Sherlock,’ John whispered. His breathing was labored, but he rubbed at his monster’s back as his mind slowly came back online.
The once would be pirate balled his fists and squeezed his eyes shut tighter.
‘Sherlock, talk to me, what happened to you?’
He stood clenching his fist until he heard the window roll up and the car drive away.
John nodded, ‘you're selfish you know that,’ he sniffed. ‘And stupid to boot.’
John stared at the metal and leather chair. He could stand there forever and count each fleck of dust that wafted by the thick beam of sunlight.
“No”, john quietly admitted to the room.
“I lov...ed you so much. More than you, or I, or anyone knew”.
‘Sher...where the hell have you been!’
He chuckled briefly at the irony of his lecturing Sherlock on the benefits of proper sleeping habits.
Molly flipped two metal trays in her scramble to catch the slipping brain saw.
“Would it have mattered?” He turned to better yell at the walls. “Would you have come to me, been honest with me...for once. Let me in for once you bast…..”
‘I’m not…. John...I'm not alive,’ Sherlock whispered, thick tears betraying his small steady voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
One week.
‘What?’
The doctor turned and stood, coming back to stand before the barrier, careful not to touch it.
Molly’s eyes were wide with fear.
‘That’s it, that’s her name.’
The voice was back.
‘Hum…,’ John reached out for the handle and it turned easily so he stepped inside.
The doctor squinted over at his clock mumbling, ‘11:45, ballocks.’ He ran a hand through his hair as he pulled back his blankets and swung his legs over the side of his lumpy bed. ‘I just layed down an hour ago cat,’ he complained, clicking on his bedside lamp.
Standing in the much to large darkened foyer he immediately felt strange, light headed, and he covered his eyes for a moment, blinking until they were able to adjust to the darkness.
‘Sherlock...Sherlock look at me,’ John said softly.
On the windowsill sat a small black cat, it’s fur long and shiny, and from the black studded collar around it’s neck hung a little gold bell.
“Oh it was. That hundred thousand euros didn’t hurt.”
Sherlock scoffed and chuckled, causing John to shake his head, smiling despite his anger. ‘You fool. If you'd just come to me we might have been able to come up with a plan that didn't involve,’ he gestured between them. ‘This, whatever this is.’
The third floated by in a  jumble of numbers letters and symbols as his senses were suddenly dialed up to ten.
(1) Chantilli cats are a long haired breed with low dander. My little girl is a chantilli thank goodness because I'm allergic to cats. lol
“I love you,” John whispered.
With a nod he sat the cat down on his bed to finish grooming herself and dressed quickly.
John’s shoulders shook with sobs. ‘God damn it Sherlock...I love you…,’ he whispered.
They were so close Molly could smell the cherry of her lipstain. She’d remembered. Nearly twenty years and she could still remember the echo of their first kiss.
John giggled in his drunkenness as she looked up at him and meowed.
‘I thought,’ the creature met his partner’s eyes, licking the small smear of blood from his lips, as the right began to turn black again. ‘I thought I was strong enough to do this….’
‘You're damn well bloody right you're responsible,’ John shouted. ‘How bloody stupid are you! How could you do that...just give up...just leave!’
The Woman stifled her laughter with a gloved hand, almost demure, as she stepped further into the lab.
“Whatever happened today was noticed,” Mycroft complained in a whisper.
But he was calm, stroking the ever growing curls.
“John! My God John,” Mary cried as the paramedics shone a light in his eyes.
‘Mmm, what, are you hungry?’
The curse died in his throat as his knees finally gave way, and he sank to the floor. A gloved hand covered his mouth to quiet his pain.
She rubbed her thumb across Irene’s wrist, remembering the perfume she’d smelled there. “I was a different person when I worked for...them.” Molly’s eyes darted around the rooms, quietly showing Irene where the bugs were hidden. “...and I couldn’t...wasn’t supposed to...feel. If my superiors had even suspected….” She faltered. “I couldn’t think of any other way….”
This time, instead of the door, the chantilly (1) walked over to the window, standing up on her hind legs and pawing at the latch.
(2) Acha is stop in Swahili according to Google Translate.
“I’m sorry Myc, I know you two really need this time. I’ll bind him a bit tighter.”
Skidding to a stop at the ledge he looked down and immediately recognized the bright red door of 221B.
“I love you Sherlock,” John whispered.
The boffin nipped at his soldier’s shoulder, grinding them together. John’s mouth fell open as his breathing sped up, and Sherlock’s now dilated but blue eyes met his with a lust neither had been prepared for.
He closed his eyes and hung his head.
“We’ve received word that there was another anomaly recorded today. Has anyone confirmed that it was the same energy signature as the one last week?” The woman looked around at her constituents.
On a pedantic note, I know that a lot of the events I describe in this fic (e.g., the pink lady case) technically occur on January 30th. Just...shhhhhhh...
Sherlock grinned—the fake one—but John saw something flash in Sherlock’s eyes, something genuine. His fake smile twitched into something real at the corners and Sherlock’s eyebrows raised.
“No new cases, then?”
“It was terrifying,” Sherlock said. His voice was quiet. He glanced up at Birdy, carefully avoiding John’s gaze. “I’d been in relationships before. Not many. I never did well in them. They always ended poorly. I thought I understood. About relationships, that is. I thought I’d felt what I was meant to feel.” His gaze dropped back to the table. “I was wrong. I met John and I knew I’d been wrong. I knew what I was meant to feel, what I’d never felt before.” Sherlock’s brow furrowed. “I don’t like being wrong.”
“Closer,” Sherlock said. “I need you closer. I need to feel you here.”
“It can be both,” Sherlock said.
“Was it because we made him come to Rosie’s birthday party?” John wondered aloud to the pot of curry. “That Liam boy nicked his umbrella for no more than five minutes. We got it right back to him, no harm done. He couldn’t have been
First and foremost, 7 million thank-yous to my beta (
and I’m afraid you’re just a fool,
John hoped that his ears had gone fuzzy when he heard Claire say
John thought. The words were nearly out of his mouth before he stopped himself. He went to take a sip of his wine, but wondered if he’d had enough wine for the night. “Well,” he said. “It was considerate of you, anyway.”
“You’d look at them, of course,” Sherlock said. It was a rather obvious thing to say. The wheels in his head skidded over a puddle.
Sherlock nodded. “Some of them.”
” John shouted at the figure. “
“Read me another one,” Sherlock said, his face still pressed to the mattress. He didn’t need to see John’s expression of confusion as he lifted his head from his screen.
“It’s odd,” he said. “She hasn’t withdrawn any money from our accounts.”
John studied Sherlock. The way Sherlock touched him now was sweet, doting. His face was open, his eyes gleaming with something that almost looked like remorse. An act, John knew. “Are you meant to look like you’re sorry right now?” John asked. “Like you’re apologizing to me?”
“Yeah,” he said, praying that his mask hadn’t faded too obviously as he looked up into Sherlock’s eyes. “Yeah. I will.”
“Changed your mind about another round?” the bartender asks, gesturing to your appallingly pint-less hands.
“I will.”
Sherlock nodded. “My sources think they know where she’s hiding out,” he said. “Stand by for more information.”
I love you all.
What lay above, as it turned out, was magnificent.
“Well,” John said, “I’m going to break it off with her.”
“You maybe could have done with some stitches,” he said. “But it’s starting to clot up so I’ll go ahead and bandage it.”
John was certainly aware of the accuracy of Sherlock’s list. He was warm and sweaty. His heart was pounding. Breathing was a bit tricky at the moment. Still… “None of that means—” he started.
at my wayfaring ways,
John asked him one afternoon, sitting across from him while Sherlock curled himself into a ball in his chair and willed unconsciousness to descend upon him.
” Mary muttered.
Everyone’s red-faced and charging like knights—
remember and John was in front of him, smiling at him with eyes hung heavy with alcohol and then their mouths were on each other’s and their bodies were pressed together and Sherlock could feel John’s erection against his own and he was lifting John up and tugging down his trousers and—
John wanted to say.
The message ended. Lestrade pocketed his mobile.
John waited. He was trying not to push Sherlock too hard at the moment, given...well, everything.
“You’d better,” John said, licking the blood off his thumb. “I need you in one piece. All your bits intact. Understood?”
*           *           *
“At the moment,
Something covered his mouth. Thick. Pulling at the edges of his skin, a pinching pain. Some sort of tape, then. John exhaled with force and he felt the air rattle against the edges of the tape. He cursed again. The sound was muffled. His heart gave a little stutter.
“That night we were texting,” John said. A part of him couldn’t believe he was about to speak these words out loud, but Sherlock needed to know that it wasn’t a momentary impulse for him. At least in the darkness, he figured that Sherlock couldn’t watch his face flush. “That night I was up with Rosie at half-three in the morning and we texted after. Sherlock, just talking to you, just seeing your words on my mobile got me so bloody turned on I had to go to the bathroom and get myself off.” His cock twitched at just the memory of it all.
Sherlock blinked. He frowned.
John lifted his eyes to the air, listening. For a moment, the room was silent. John bit at his lip. He glanced back down at Sherlock. Sherlock smiled, running his hands along John’s stomach, down his sides. He returned his attention to John’s skin.
John shrugged. “I suppose so,” he said. He considered. “My arse is a bit sore. Maybe I got knocked over.”
“How do you shield people, then?” John asked.
“Are you seriously making moon eyes at your lover while your fiancé is in the room?” Gilly asked.
John,” he says.
(See the end of the chapter for
“London needed me,” Sherlock said, another practiced answer. “The city was in danger. I saved it.” He glanced at John, a flicker of an old apology in his eye. “
John managed to get an arm free. “Sherlock,” he whispered again. He reached behind him, rubbing at Sherlock’s side, down his back. Sherlock was drenched in sweat and practically vibrating.
John wriggled under Sherlock’s grasp. He craned his head backwards, trying to catch Sherlock’s eye. “Sherlock,” he said again. Sherlock’s arm only tightened further.
who wore a posh cologne,
“Don’t take your eyes off me,” Sherlock said.
He felt Sherlock shrug next to him. “And yet,” Sherlock said, “I’m at the center of it.”
Sherlock hums. “Must’ve paid off one of the regular security guards. Or possibly an employee. I’m sure a percentage of what is stolen is enough to buy a little loyalty.” The drone catches the bag in its hook and lifts the bag from the ground. It starts to turn and Sherlock grabs your arm, tugging you against the wall just next to the vault door. The drone drifts out of the door and back into the lobby, moving towards the ceiling with the plastic bag of money dangling from its belly.
Sherlock seemed a bit exasperated. “What sort of physical affection would you expect to
John gave up shortly after that.
Across the patio lay Magnussen. He was on his back, his head cocked to the side. Dead, a prim hole in the center of his forehead. His eyes were still open, his glasses slightly askew. His thin lips were still fixed in a smile, and he looked as if he considered John and Sherlock to be endlessly fascinating. However, now the deadness to his eyes was an honesty. All the great knowledge stored in that brain was eviscerated. He was an empty shell, housing nothing.
“Not like you see
“And how do you know what the rules are?” Sherlock asked. “And—more importantly—how do you know the host plays by them?”
“You were hemming and hawing over nearly half of the menu, taking an exceedingly long time to decide, even by your standards, and I told you to just order the linguine because it would be the dish you’d like best.”
“I know, love,” John said, rubbing at her back. “I think that sort of thing might scare some people, though.”
“It was good,” you say instead.
Sherlock’s facial expression told John everything he needed to know about Sherlock’s thoughts on the plan.
Sherlock met him halfway up the hill, looking frustrated. He caught John by the shoulder and spun him, pushing him back towards the house. “He’s made off in a boat,” Sherlock said. “I fired at him, but he was too far away. I only got the side of the boat. No damage.” He pushed the gun back into John’s hands. John tucked it back into his coat pocket. Sherlock stopped him just before the two reached the house. He grasped John by the arms, scanning the whole of his body. “Are you hurt?”
“It planted its roots in a precarious place,” Sherlock said, “but it planted them strong.”
Sherlock nodded again. “Very.”
Sherlock walked into the bathroom, looking sheepish. “You seemed rather adamant about your privacy before,” he said.
“—boyfriend,” John finished, scratching at his head.
Sherlock nodded. The part of his brain that was insistent about Plan 17 cheered.
Raise your glasses high, my friends,
Sherlock’s hips were grinding against John’s, little stuttering thrusts. He lifted himself onto his elbows and nodded towards the bedside table, not stopping his movements, not capable of stopping.
Sherlock returned his attention to the journal. “The
Sherlock let out a little moan and rolled forward again. This time, he pressed himself against John, his face nearly nestled into John’s armpit. John’s body went stiff. Sherlock Holmes was pressed against him in his sleep. He could feel each of Sherlock’s breaths puff against his chest. He could feel the warmth of Sherlock’s body on his. If he focused hard enough, he could
“Shit,” John said, dropping Sherlock’s wrist to shut the bedroom door and drown out the light. “Didn’t mean to wake you.”
“Good
“He took something from them,” Sherlock said. “Declan. He took something from the Taibhses. Something worth money. Something worth enough money to provide for his family.”
“Oh.” John shifted, wincing slightly as he moved closer to Sherlock. Sherlock felt John’s hand move to his face, thumb stroking at Sherlock’s cheek. He almost nestled into the touch, nearly pressed his lips to John’s pulse-point. It was wrong that such a touch felt so comforting, especially when Sherlock ought to be the one giving out comforting touches at the moment.
“You know,” John said. His ridiculous moustache twitched with his words.
“I’ve decided,” John said. “I can’t be without you. Not anymore.”
Sherlock set the water on the bedside table. “If you need more,” he said, gesturing at the glass. “It’s a perfect arm’s reach away. The bedside table.”
Sherlock burst into the café, a few eager tourists following him, finishing up some story about Peig Sayers. John watched Sherlock as he strode through the room, having little to no control over how mesmerizing he found the man. He gripped the edges of the counter behind the till.
John hummed. “Seems like quite a lot of responsibility,” he said. “Being the center of everything.”
With that, she set off down the hill towards her boat. The dinghy carrying Darren, Conor, and Fitz had reached the ferry, and John could see the little crew hopping onto the larger boat to head back to their non-island home. In a few moments, the lot of them were gone, their boats growing smaller and smaller as they moved through the Sound.
“Will said he didn’t know Declan very well,” John said, “when I asked him.”
“Video only,” Sherlock said. “No audio. We can speak freely, provided we don’t look suspicious.”
John felt as if something were sliding through him. A knife, slicing him from end to end. “Yeah,” he said. “I would.”
Sherlock shook his head. “I’m poison,” he said. “I’ll destroy anyone who tries to make a home with me.”
Sherlock was interviewing the locals now. He sent periodic texts that were more disjointed non sequiturs than actual updates on whatever knowledge he had gained. It was confusing and infuriating and forced more than one unwanted smile onto John’s face and was absolutely, categorically, not helping.
The man pressed a button on the mobile, eyes on John the whole time. He flicked the screen, switching to speakerphone. The sound of Sherlock’s mobile rang through the little speakers, echoing through the cave. John held his breath. The ringing stopped abruptly as the call was answered.
” Sherlock’s voice shook for the slightest of seconds. He regrouped. “I wasn’t right. Wasn’t myself. Whatever I thought, I was wrong.” He sighed. “I was foolish. As I’ve said, love makes fools of us all.”
“I’ve talked her ‘round,” Sherlock repeated. “She’ll wear the dress. And she has agreed to cease all negative comments about it from this point forward.”
Sherlock made an uninterested noise but crawled under the blankets anyway. “Did you sleep?” he asked.
“That’s…” John frowned, “unnerving.”
doesn’t…” He shook his head again, regrouping. He was getting sidetracked. “You’re wrong,” he said. “Whatever you think happened that night. You’re wrong.”
Sherlock tugged John to his feet. “Move quickly,” he said. He was wiping the concern from his face, turning himself back to a blank slate, but John could still see traces of it around the edges.
with somebody—was making him lose his appetite.
“There is one in every room, I wager,” Sherlock said. “One in the kitchen. Two in the sitting room. I haven’t checked the bedroom yet, but I am very sorry to report that there is one in the loo.”
“You could have been,” she said, her voice quiet. “They could have used the two of you to get—”
“Mycroft and I are no longer on speaking terms,” John said. “And besides. It’s common sense.” John reached across his plate and sectioned off a bite of Sherlock’s lasagna. He liked Angelo’s lasagna. He was glad Sherlock ordered it.
He shook his head. That way, of course, lay madness.
You shake your head. Arrogant prick. The mobile goes silent and you’re just holding it in your hands and staring as if he might crawl out of it somehow. It feels like all the blood in your body is aching, and you can’t say any of the things you’d like to say to him.
Sherlock cleared his throat. “Didn’t you say something about
John laid his wet clothes by the fire as Sherlock busied himself with the table, setting their places and radiating with a nervous energy. When John joined Sherlock at the table, he noticed that Sherlock seemed to have recreated the rice-and-beans-and-veg dish that John cobbled together these past few nights.
“I’ll charge it when I get back to the cottage,” John said. He slowed, glancing behind him to Sherlock, who seemed thrown off-kilter by his departure. “I trust that you won’t manage to kill yourself while I’m away?”
While they were giving their statements, Detective Inspector Adams returned from the cottage. She had an officer collect Sherlock and John’s luggage, seeing as their cottage was now a crime scene and their holiday was officially over.
The sound John made couldn’t have been called a laugh even by the loosest of definitions.
Sherlock took it.
“She’s clearly just as misguided as you are,” Sherlock said. He shook his head. “Why am I the only person on this planet with the ability to
John stared at the sheep, tongue pressed against the corner of his mouth. Yes, this was definitely odd. He hadn’t woken up to anything of the sort when he lived with Mary, that was for sure. This sort of situation was uniquely
,” and Sherlock knew John was close, could hear it in the way his voice throbbed with urgency, could feel it in the way John moved against him, his hips speeding up as they bucked against Sherlock’s. John’s cock was pressed between their bodies and ground against Sherlock’s stomach, sliding in the slick of both of their sweat.
“Saying they had a problem builds intrigue,” John said. “The readers will want to know what the problem was.”
.” He pressed one more forceful kiss to John’s mouth before tearing away from him, nearly sprinting up the hill. “Come on, John!” he called behind him.
“Sherlock,” John said, “do you have any idea why—“
He was interrupted by the sound of irritated, insistent barking.
“I wasn’t right,” Sherlock said. “I was hurt.”
Sherlock must have sprung a spine because John’s mouth moved to his neck and it arched, bending him upwards, pressing him further into John’s body. He was growing bones, aching nubs of calcium, wrapping around his center like a shell and splitting from his corners to form limbs—four of them, perfect for swimming, for crawling. He barely had control over any of it and his newly-formed limbs flopped and floundered, wrapping themselves desperately around John, grasping at him, pulling him closer. John moved against him, a fierce, fluid movement, and Sherlock considered that bones were rough, much rougher than water, and everything had an urgency to it. Sherlock wasn’t formless or weightless or soft or slow anymore. Everything was growing, fast,
This, John knew. This is where he belonged.
“The flash drive is priceless to them,” Sherlock said, whirling about the room. John was waiting for one of Sherlock’s feet to crash through the hole in the floor, but he remained balanced. “Worth millions. More. Oh, Will...how much money did they offer you to retrieve their treasure for them? Was it the full one-point-two million? Or even more than that? Enough to pay off your debts and then some?” With that, Sherlock was out the door, rushing down the stairs. Fitz followed, his little body wriggling with excitement.
Sherlock tilted his head towards John, eyes narrowed. “No?”
“Oh,” Mary said, looking as if she had to stretch her memory back ages, “a while ago. The scan was at...eighteen weeks, I believe.”
“The Monty problem,” Rosie said. “Papa says you're wrong.”
As the boat neared the island, John could spy Sherlock more clearly as he made his way down the hill, climbing over the rough terrain towards the outcrop to which the smaller man directed him. The outcropping sat low over the water, jutting out a bit from the island. The boat had a clear path to the little row of rocks and the water looked fairly deep, no boulders to dodge or chances of the boat scraping bottom. They could get close enough to Sherlock to get the flash drive, to do whatever else they had planned. As the boat drew nearer to the rocks, John thought that the man wouldn’t even have to be as good of a shot as he claimed to have his shot ring true.
They were a bit uncoordinated as they made their way back to the bedroom, but John managed to wrest Sherlock’s shirt off his shoulders and push him face-first onto the bed. John grabbed at Sherlock’s hips, hitching him up until he was on his hands and knees.
“It’s my choice,” Sherlock said. His fingers flew across his mobile.
he has my nose and, I suppose, my eyes,
“And we love each other very much, don’t we?”
John shook his head. “Uneventful for now,” he said.
John’s mobile buzzed. It was Mary. She had sent him a few texts already this evening, mostly asking what time he thought he’d be home. Thus far, he had ignored all of them.
He heard a soft noise—a light puff of breath—and something shifted against his chest. His blinking eyes searched for the disturbance. A sleeping John, face half-buried in his pillow, was tucked close to Sherlock, an arm flung across Sherlock’s chest—heavy, possessive. The blankets had slipped low on his body, stopping just before the swell of his arse, revealing the muscled lines of his bare back. Sherlock smiled, and his brain decided it was worth coming back online for this.
“I don’t understand,” Sherlock said. His eyes were growing wild, frenzied. “It shouldn’t have hurt. None of it was supposed to have hurt.”
Sherlock paused, stunned. He blinked. Once. Twice. And then he surged forward and his mouth was on John’s, forcing John’s lips apart and pushing his tongue inside and they were kissing,
The ewe bleated and returned to munching on grass. All in all, it was unhelpful.
Everything was bloody pink. The walls were pink. The dresser drawers were pink. The lining on the changing table was pink. The mobile that hung above the cot was pink. Even the stuffed animals that lined the cot were pink, staring back at John with dead eyes and pink grins.
When John emerged from washing up, a cup of tea in hand and a bit of toast resting comfortably in his stomach, he spied a boat aiming itself towards the island. The O’Sullivan’s boat, he noticed—the smaller one that Claire took out to the island.
Sherlock erupted from their bedroom, as if on cue.
. How was it that Sherlock still smelled so bloody good first thing in the morning?
” John shouted, and then he was on him, his hand wrapped so tight around Sherlock’s arm he was certain to leave a bruise. He sank the full weight of his body backwards, planting his arse on the wet ground and sinking his heels into the dirt, bracing himself. He tugged at Sherlock’s body with all his might. If Sherlock tipped off this cliff, by God, John was coming with him.
much narrower than expected. John had a feeling that there might actually be some cuddling in their future, planned or not. A part of John’s body perked up at the thought, which did not exactly make anything easier for John at the moment.
When they returned to London, John moved himself and Rosie directly into Baker Street, barely taking the time to gather their things from his old flat with Mary. Mrs. Hudson had been thrilled. John asked Sherlock no fewer than a half a dozen times if he was sure, reminding him that he could refuse, that introducing a baby into the flat would bring chaos and disruption, that John was more than willing to take things slowly if Sherlock wished. Sherlock, however, had never been so sure of anything in his life.
shake. “Fucking hell,” you say, and you can barely hear your own voice.
John cleared his throat, glancing out the window. “I’ve. Um. Yeah.” He found that anything resembling eye contact was not possible for him at the moment. “I’ve been with men. As well.”
“Are Declan’s effects still upstairs?” Sherlock asked from behind the counter.
“You have nothing to apologize for,” Mary said, “I’m the one who—”
“I want to eat it,” Sherlock said.
“You feel…” Sherlock started, but lost however he meant to finish that sentence as he moved inside of John once more, slow but deep, his words dissolving into a groan.
Why was it even up there in the first place?
Sherlock chuckled, catching the box in his free hand and sitting back on his heels, keeping his fingers inside John. John whimpered at the sudden lack of contact, moving himself against Sherlock’s hand in a way that seemed just outside of his control. He looked up at Sherlock through barely-open eyes. Sherlock looked like a glorious mess. A flush had crept over his face and chest, and his hair was a knotted wreck from the bath. His plump lips were swollen and pink and he had the mark of more than a few love-bites on his neck. At the moment, however, Sherlock’s gaze was focused entirely on his fingers disappearing inside of John. His mouth had dropped slightly open and he appeared transfixed, seconds away from pouncing. He looked magnificent, debauched and wrecked, and if John didn’t feel more of him—all of him—immediately he might explode from it.
Sherlock appeared in the doorway, holding what looked to be a second notebook full of scribblings. He hadn’t had a case in a day or so; he was still wearing his pyjamas and blue dressing gown and had objectively too much time on his hands. “Watson agrees with me,” he said. “You remain the last person in this flat who refuses to think logically.”
“John,” he snapped. “Let’s
Adams sighed. She gestured towards a few nearby officers. “We’ll do a sweep of the cottage,” she said. She walked off to bark orders at the officers.
The man had headphones on and John practically ripped them off his head. “Did you see anybody come out of that building?” he demanded. “Just now? 221b?”
John frowned. “That’s bollocks,” he said.
,” John was shouting the moment he walked through the door to his and Mary’s flat. Kicked through the door was a bit more accurate, as he still had some entrails on his hands that he didn’t want to get on their doorknob.
“Realized that Irene Adler broke into the flat and took back her phone,” Sherlock admitted flatly. John's face showed both of their disappointment.
“She's fine, just out cold.” After gently turning Kate to her back, Irene nodded.
“But did you ever notice that I was never heartbroken over them?” His flatmate asked, and Sherlock had to admit that was true. John would mope for roughly 8-12 hours, but that was all.
“And if I clear whatever else is on your plate?” John stopped eating again to give the phone a long, hard look before he pointedly ignored the device.
“Can I have something else?”
“What I said was true,” Sherlock allowed. John closed his eyes, nodding tightly. Sherlock brought a hand to his friend's face, ensuring eye contact. “Yet you have become an indispensable part of my life and work. I realized that at the pool. I would be lost without my blogger.” Sherlock watched as hope, desperately irrational hope, claimed John Watson. “We might as well give them something to talk about.” With those words, he leaned forward and placed a careful kiss on John's forehead. John responded with a soft laugh and a kiss to Sherlock's exposed collarbone, sending a shiver down the detective's spine.
“I don't mind at all. Not important anyways.” With that, Sherlock turned the phone to vibrate only and turned to his own plate of food.
“How are you feeling?” He asked, not trusting himself to say much more. John looked Sherlock up and down, a frown creasing his brow for a moment before he smiled up at Sherlock.
“Which was entirely her plan. I didn't see her plan. I placed the jacket carelessly. I could have easily left it with Lestrade or my brother. That was my fault, not yours,” the detective insisted emphatically.
Sherlock jerked his head up, had to do more than just hear his voice say the words.
“Then I would be flattered and honored to stand by your side, in any and every way you wish me to.”
“Christ, what happened to him?”
“I believe the phrase is 'You're not my cup of tea.' -SH” Sherlock smirked at John before he pressed send.
“No, here is fine.” John absently patted Sherlock's chest before he realized what he was doing, freezing again.
“Captain Watson, I need to listen to me. You've been injured, and we're trying to get you to triage. Stop struggling.” As Sherlock spoke, his gambit seemed to work: John's eyes began to focus on him, and his movements stopped. Sherlock then looked at Lestrade, who nodded and began to move John up the stairs again. Sherlock grabbed John's legs and continued to help carry John. Once they reached the living room, the three men stopped, lowering John into his armchair, despite mild protests from John.
An hour later, after ensuring that John was deeply asleep, Sherlock settled himself into his mind palace. True, he couldn't move quite as he would like to, but Sherlock had no desire to wake John. And he needed to think about what John had said. Did he really mean all of it? Whether he would be willing to admit it the next morning was a completely different topic.
What he didn’t expect was for a calloused hand to slip in between his two. “Why would I want to forget that?”
“Yes?”
As Sherlock reached the top of the stairs, he saw Irene brandished the crop once in warning before she hit John twice across his supporting arm, causing his balance to wobble precariously again.
“Nah. I do. Always liked the smell. Best par' of bein' in the kitchen when you shower,” John insisted as Sherlock realized he spoke out loud.
“Well, God knows she's used to that.” She then turned back to the boys. “There's a back door. Better check it, Mr. Holmes. That pistol may come in handy.” Sherlock stared at John for a moment before nodding.
“I think now would be a good time to talk actually,” the doctor replied smoothly, his face refusing to give Sherlock any hints, spare his resolution to talk.
“Not too bad. You look better, though.” And then he winked. Sherlock blinked for a moment.
“Drop it,” Sherlock barked, and Irene's head snapped up. She instantly took two steps closer to the rope, within easy reach.
“Don't try to be coy. You already know. Besides, John has better table manners than you. -SH”
-------
“You dunno tha'. An' I do know. I'd of said it lon' ago, buh you're married tuh your work.” John lifted his head from Sherlock's shoulder, looking the other man in the eyes. And Sherlock couldn't read an ounce of insincerity, though he knew John would never lie about something like this. His words would always be sincere.
“My apologies to you Mr. Holmes, and my congratulations to whomever is the lucky diner. I do wish I were in his shoes.” Sherlock smirked and rolled his eyes.
“You always shouted that you weren’t gay.”
“Good morning Mr. Holmes. Care for dinner tonight?” John gave the phone a sideways look at the ringer.
Sherlock thought. “I can leave the room if you wish to wake on your own,” he offered, attempting to be aloof and only vaguely interested in the answer.
“I kept you distracted,” he quietly acknowledged.
“Oh, I think you can trust this doctor’s word. I’ll be fine for dinner. And if I don’t feel well, you will be the first person I tell. Now, if I may have my dessert?” John finished his request with a lick of his own lips.
“John, we're trying to help you. Calm down, and we'll set you down when we get into the sitting room,” Lestrade tried to reassure, but John continued to struggle, muttering broken phrases and looking around wildly. From what Sherlock could tell, he was having another flash back to Afghanistan. Lestrade's words wouldn't work, so Sherlock set John's legs down and leaned forward, grabbing John's face with both hands.
“Do you mind turning that thing off? Or changing the alert?” John finally snapped, staring moodily at the phone.
But there was no lie. There was only John’s heart, bared for Sherlock to observe and deduce. And with that, a puff of air left Sherlock’s lungs. He wasn’t lying.
“A kiss. Women and men on three continents have said that once they kissed me, they could not step away.” The glint was back in John’s eye, and Sherlock could not find it in him to protest. So he leaned down and gently kissed his flatmate on the cheek.
Once they reached 221b, Lestrade parked, and the pair began to carry John into the flat. Normally, Sherlock would have suggested that Lestrade throw John over his shoulder or use a soldier's carry. But with John so out of it and the head injury, Sherlock didn't want to risk John waking violently and hurting his head again. So Lestrade had John by the armpits while Sherlock had him by the knees. Unfortunately, about halfway up the stairs, John woke and immediately began to struggle.
“As long as the other doctors approve,” Sherlock conceded. He didn’t wish to push John too soon after surgery, albeit minor surgery.
“Sher-!” John began, moving determinedly towards the bedroom and raising his voice as loud as he could, but Irene's hand connected with his face, punching him hard. The additional momentum sent him crashing forwards. Thinking of the phone, John fumbled and grabbed it from his pocket. Irene's nails scratched and scrabbled painfully at the back of his hand as he pulled the phone under his body, using his weight against her.
John’s eyes fluttered awake, and despite his own thoughts, Sherlock released a breath he’d been holding for quite some time.
“Irene Adler,” Sherlock replied. “Now help me carry him to your car. I can better treat him at the flat.” Greg nodded and walked over, and together they were able to carry John to Lestrade's squad car.
“Why did you stop?”
“Will most likely be occupied. -SH”
Sherlock spent most of the trip over relating what had happened to Lestrade, providing enough detail to make sure that he wouldn't be bothered for the rest of the night. During most of the trip, John would mumble incoherently, with varying amounts of volume as he floated in and out of consciousness. Lestrade gave a pitying glance to Sherlock more than once, but Sherlock didn't mind. John had no idea what he was doing, and given John's symptoms, Sherlock had deduced that Irene had given him a cocktail of sedatives and psychoactive drugs. It would leave the client happily sleepy, and give Irene more than enough time to get out of a bad situation.
“You make the most adorable pout when you sleep. Thanks for keeping my phone safe. ;)” Sherlock rolled his eyes and put toast in for both of them and set the kettle to boil. By the time John walked out of the bathroom, several of his welts uncovered, Sherlock had a functional breakfast for the both of them. Sherlock grabbed the paper and sat down as he glanced again at John. The doctor was fully awake by now.
John took a closer look at their entwined hands. “God, what I’d love to see you work with those hands. What are the calluses on your fingertips from?”
“Drop it,” she commanded, ending it with two lashes to his back.
“John, you have been pursuing women since I have known you -” Sherlock started, but John shushed him quite loudly before overriding with his own thoughts.
“So, does that mean I still get my dinner?” John prompted, an eyebrow wiggling as Sherlock blushed.
John’s forehead creased in confusion before he saw the IV attached to his right hand. “Damn. Then how did I end up with such a gorgeous man at my bedside? I’m guessing fresh out of surgery, given how good I feel.”
“If you're sure, then I'll head out. Try to get some actual sleep tonight, and let me know how John is doing tomorrow. Technically I need a statement from him as well.” With that, Sherlock heard Lestrade leave the flat, closing the door behind him. Once he was sure Lestrade was gone, Sherlock coaxed John into a sitting position and then partly carried him into the detective's bedroom. Sherlock reasoned that the bedroom was closer to the bathroom, which would leave John out of Sherlock's sight for a shorter amount of time. The bed was also far more comfortable for John than a chair. Not to mention Sherlock would also be able to rest on a different part of the bed and still know when John was moving around. It had nothing to do with a need to shelter John from any further dangers Sherlock could incur. It was not to protect John's dignity, though he knew John would be embarrassed if Mrs. Hudson saw him strung out on the injection.
“I can stay and help you keep an eye on him,” Lestrade offered, but Sherlock waved him off.
“No, I'm not going to go chasing after him. I don't want more men coming in that way or through one of the other rooms.” She then shrugged, turning her attention back to Kate.
“They came in that way.” John motioned, standing as Sherlock and Irene entered the room, gesturing towards the open bathroom window. John crossed the bedroom to Sherlock, and Sherlock used Irene's movement into the room to cover him handing the phone over to John, who quietly pocketed the device. John then turned his attention to Irene.
“If you wish to forget last night I will never hold it against you. You were under the effect of psychoactive drugs, and you didn't mean what you said -” Sherlock began to ramble, forcing the words out in a rush, when John placed a fingertip against his lips.
In fact, if it weren’t for John’s numerous vehement objections to being placed in a relationship with Sherlock and the fact that he frequently screamed at everyone that he wasn’t gay, Sherlock would have thought his flatmate absolutely enamored with him. Perhaps Sherlock had misjudged something. Perhaps -
“Sher-” John tried to shout again, but after finally managing to get up on his hands and knees, his balanced pitched forward. So he had to steady himself with one arm, nearly face-planting into the wooden floor.
“I’m not,” John answered, a slight growl in his voice. “I would have thought that the many skirts I chased spoke for that.” Sherlock’s pulse jumped at his growl.
“But you were married to your work, so I never pushed you. I was more than happy just to be your friend, to be someone you trusted. How could I ruin that trust by pushing you for something you clearly didn’t want?”
“What have you done to him?” Sherlock growled.
“Actually, let's get you into a more comfortable position while I make sure the police take as little of my time as possible.” He then used the duvet to cushion John as much as possible against the bedside table before standing. That was when a distinctly female groan reached Sherlock's ears; it seemed that Kate was finally waking. Sherlock then moved her into a sitting position against the vanity set as someone began pounding on the door. He bounded down the stairs, shouting to the police that he would get the door. As luck would have it, Greg was the one knocking.
“It’s a long story.” It wasn’t exactly a fib, but part of Sherlock’s heart broke. “Tell you what, if you remember all of this tonight, I will happily take you out to dinner, and play my finest concerto for you.”
“Are you speaking to me?” Sherlock even took the precaution of glancing over his shoulder.
“If there are others, I will lure them in and shout. John, use the rope to go out the way they came in and get both of you out. I'll find my own way out. Besides, best to separate these two.” He tapped his pocket meaningfully, then turned on his heel and walked out before John could say a word in protest. John sighed in resignation. Irene opened her mouth, but John stopped her.
“Uh, jhzohn-i” Sherlock had to stop himself. He’d only done that once before. Why was he doing it again? Why was his heart racing?
Here, Sherlock dove through all their interactions, both public and private. Statements at The Yard and mumbled 'good morning's mingled and flashed across Sherlock's mind, and yet for all his genius, Sherlock could not make heads or tails of the army doctor's behavior. Round and round his mind wove itself, unable to reach a definitive conclusion. Eventually, sleep overpowered the detective, and night passed into morning.
“Sher-” John slurred at him, and Sherlock turned his attention back to John's face.
“Such as?”
“Mmmm. 'S nice of yuh. Comfy too. Smell nice too.” John added as he cuddled closer to Sherlock and nosed at the tall man's hair, breathing it in. Sherlock stiffened. There was no way John really meant that.
It was the first of many similar nights.
“I can understand if you want to pretend that this never happened, John. I would not dare to hold it against you. You weren’t yourself.” Sherlock couldn’t look John in the eye, couldn’t see the man’s relief suffuse over his features.
Now that John was leaning against Sherlock's bed, he could grab the necessary supplies to patch the doctor up. Sherlock made sure to grab cleaning agents as well as a roll of gauze and medical tape. Fortunately, none of John's wounds required stitches, so Sherlock left those supplies in the cabinet and crossed back to the bedroom.
“You won’t remember this.”
“I – said –” She punctuated each word with a lash to the back, followed a particularly vicious blow to the head as she circled back into the bathroom. John fell forward again, landing hard on his left shoulder as he curled the phone under his body once more. Sherlock's vision turned red in fury.
So Sherlock settled into his memories, sifting through the time he had known John, searching for something that would affirm or deny the slurred words he had spoken earlier. The easiest phrase to affirm was John's belief in Sherlock's abilities. Time and time again, the doctor had trusted Sherlock's intuition when he ordered John around. The most John had ever done was simply ask clarifying questions. Many times, those questions were redundant, but they were never questions that doubted Sherlock's abilities. The first night, John had followed Sherlock across rooftops without major protest. There was no doubt that John trusted Sherlock with his life. But did John trust his heart to Sherlock as well?
Sherlock felt John begin to move against him, jolting him from sleep. A quick glance at John told the detective that the doctor was not under a hallucination and was not experiencing any lingering symptoms, spare his usual stiffness and some lingering drowsiness. John's face had taken an imprint of the buttoned shirt it laid against, and John attempted to scrub it as he yawned. But the doctor froze when he realized who he was pushing off of.
“Next time, don't use my blogger as your distraction. -SH” Irene's reply was fairly swift.
“I glanced at her. No lasting injuries. Your men can interrogate her at your leisure. Irene Adler won't be showing her face for quite some time, and unless she talks someone into picking her up within the next few hours, you'll get everything you need from her. However, I need to take John back to 221b.” Lestrade finally turned his attention to their injured and unconscious friend.
“Easy there, gorgeous. Don’t worry. It’ll all be fine. Just let me sleep for a little while. Then we’ll get back to chatting. I want to know more about you.” John mumbled before he drifted off to sleep again.
“How do I know you’ll keep your end of the deal? You can’t just promise a doctor a meal and then skip out later.”
“Oh, really? You think you know me that well? Have you seen me recover from anesthesia before?” That made Sherlock blink. He never had. “Mmm. And there we have it. I may do strange things when I’m out of it, but I always remember.” Sherlock stopped. He would have stopped John if he had known he would remember. For a moment, Sherlock felt himself panic.
“And if I said that I’d changed my mind? That I wasn’t in such a strict marriage to my Work? That I might wish to entertain someone else?” This was it. This was Sherlock putting his closely guarded heart out for John Watson’s examination. He didn’t know what he would do if John found him wanting, but he could no longer walk away from John. Not after he had said those words.
“Easy, there, gorgeous.” John reached a hand out to him, tracing calming circles over the back of his hand. “You’ve already impressed me.”
“‘Course I am. What, did you think I was talking to someone else as pretty as you?” John was sporting a lopsided grin, and Sherlock felt his stomach doing some sort of aerial maneuver.
“Give it to me. Now!” Irene demanded over John, circling while John tried to gather his strength. Whatever he was injected with was messing with his muscles, as they barely responded to his commands.
Once Sherlock finally calmed himself, he slid deep into his Mind Palace, examining his time with John, and comparing it against what he had just witnessed. He knew that John knew how to charm any woman he came in contact with, though there were a great many who were fool enough to pass him over. But that never deterred John, who would simply shrug and try again with someone else. In a way, he was a shameless flirt. But he was a gentleman, always respectful of other’s boundaries.
A laugh escaped Sherlock’s lips, relieved that his heart still lived, now thrived in John Watson’s care. He gripped the hand in his tighter, reaching out for the other hand before changing his mind and placing it on John’s cheek, right over the spot he had kissed. John in turned began to grin, that silly, stupid grin they shared at crime scenes, that grin that told him he was enjoying himself.
Sherlock heard John begin to wake, and he quickly fled his Mind Palace. This was a topic he could peruse later. For now, his focus was on John Watson, currently laying in a hospital bed.
“Is that - ” John began to ask.
“Why?”
Making his way up the stairs two and three at a time, Sherlock dashed as quietly as he could. He could hear Irene's voice, raised and upset.
“I, uh, I guess the cat’s out of the bag.” John looked down at his bedsheets, one hand clenching and relaxing, the other hand rubbing at the back of his neck. The cat was most certainly out of the bag. Sherlock allowed himself a few moments before he took a deep breath, steeling himself.
“And how do you know that I’d be interested?”
But just as he was turning to tell Irene as much, something pushed his head into the doorframe. Hard. Dazed, he tried to push away from it as stars popped in his vision. As he recovered his senses, something sharp pierced his arm: a needle. John opened his mouth, reeling from the burn of chemicals entering his system.
The wayward feline looked as if it’d been caught, paw extended to tap at the side of another small ceramic potted plant, as it’s ‘bored’ blue green eye stared up at John.
He didn't turn, lifting his face to look out at a fluffy cloud passing by. ‘How have you been,’ he questioned.
The door before him was the only one in sight, so where had his furry friend gone?
It was the voice that led him to Chloe his first girlfriend.
His brow was instantly moist and his stomach churned.
John hissed and pulled back as he accidently sliced his tongue on one of Sherlock’s sharpened canines.
John looked away, out the window to the darkening London streets.
‘Hello John,’ the deep baritone froze the doctor in his tracks.
A moment later he could hear knocking, as if on a thick window, from behind him.
“There’s a cabby outside with your address in his GPS,” Irene grinned.
They both began to laugh as they untangled and removed their respective gloves before embracing properly. “I’m so glad you’re here,” Molly whispered.
Careful to avoid the broken glass on the floor John climbed out of the tub wrapping a towel around his waist and grabbing another from the cupboard for Chubby.
‘John! What the bloody hell are you doing here?’
‘Meeeeow,’ the cat whined across the small room from atop his dresser. It pawed at his clothes folded neatly in anticipation of tomorrow’s work day, knocking down his slacks and shirt.
Sherlock flattened his hands against the barrier, motioning for the vet to do the same.  John took a deep breath, reaching out, implicitly trusting that the reaction would be different.
With a lick of his lips Sherlock reached down John’s body to pull him free of his trousers and pants, and he kissed him softly as he slowly began to stroke him.
Only when the tall bottle was a third empty was he able to drift off to a dreamless sleep.
They were too young, to jaded, and to innocent to weather the tidal wave of blood and tribulation they’d be hit with.
A moment later Sherlock looked up with sad baggy red eyes. He smiled slightly, just a simple upturn at the corner of his mouth, and John smiled back.
“You've lost weight...I haven't seen you take a lunch break in weeks. And we can all smell that you haven't been showering or doing laundry regularly,” she said with a small smile.
‘How….’ The ex soldier sighed as he fell back on to his pillow.
On some basic level Sherlock knew how close he was standing to John as he gazed down in to his brilliantly blue eyes, and it was the ever present knowledge of the danger the doctor was in that kept him from stepping forward.
John sighed.
“Ah jeez, Myc. Your brother is stubborn as a three legged mule,” she sighed with a chuckle. “John went back to Baker Street.”
‘Sher….’
The detective knelt, stunned. ‘John,’ his voice was small.
Authors Note: Kardiá (Ka-div-ya) means heart in Greek, and Moyo is heart in Swahili.
‘I’m going mad…’ John began as the cat leapt down and walked calmly over to his front door, sitting beside it and staring up at him.
‘Ofh! Bloody hell,’ he grumbled, half asleep. He rolled on to his side from his back, rising onto an elbow and peering blearily into the darkness. There on his windowsill, framed by the brightest moonlight he'd ever seen in London, sat the same black cat he’d chased from 221B, complete with bell and missing eye.
‘Half a man,’ John thought. ‘That's what I am, split right down the middle.’
‘I got it,’ he began standing, swaying, in the tub. ‘Follow you, yea I know the drill.’
Touching the water he pulled his hand back quickly at the shock of heat. He grumbled for a moment before switching the hot for cold. A few minutes later it was tolerable so he climbed in draping a rag across his eyes to blot out the light.
Irene closed her eyes. “What you did was cowardly.”Her head hung, “you ran away from me, left me to pick up the pieces of a life I didn’t think was possible for someone like me.”
He ended the meeting with the press of a button on his phone.
‘He looks like he’s floating under water,’ the doctor thought.
John laughed and the detective was taken aback. He thought he’d never hear that sound again.
‘What,’ Sherlock looked away but didn’t remove his hands. ‘That makes no sense,’ he mumbled. ‘Why would she lead you here,’ he questioned to himself.
“Why didn’t I say it,” his breath hitched. “Why didn’t I tell you when you...when you were here.”
Would his detective still have jumped if he’d just said it...made him understand that it wasn’t a the of love of a friend he’d meant.
“Where’d you come from little guy.” John picked up the purring wriggling cat and she deftly jumped out of his arms over his shoulder and out the bedroom door.
With the press of a button the projection of a round table and six colorful symbols lit up the room.
It was that voice that had given him the half second that saved his life in Afghanistan.
‘Sherlock,’ John moaned loudly a few achingly pleasant moments later, but the detective didn’t stop his slow wet drawing of the soldier’s essence. ‘Uhhh,’ John wined, taking hold of the tousled curls. He couldn’t stand the heat that was now dampening his clothes, but he moaned despite himself as Sherlock suddenly bucked hard against him. He could feel the bulge clearly against his own, but he was also beginning to feel weak in a way that was well beyond tired, despite being asleep, and he tried to bring his lover back to himself.
‘John’
The younger man knelt atop the bed with wide shocked eyes, his hands resting against the barrier without incident. He looked as if he were yelling but John couldn’t hear him. He had so many questions, but for the moment he was just happy to be able to look into the detective’s eyes and see his soul staring back. The sudden flash of lifeless blue eyes shattered the last of John’s stoicism and his shoulders shook as he covered his eyes to hide his tears. A few minutes later when he was able to calm himself he raised his eyes back to his detective.
More than the pain in his head, it hurt to hear Sherlock sound so desperate. But he had no time to focus on that new pain. Pulled forward, he fell and instead of the plush carpet his face hit water.
He choked back the sob.
‘John’
The second sent sparks flying, and the detective turned quickly in shock.
A few moments later they sat together, hand in hand, in Molly’s office.
‘Damn it!’ Slam.
A moment later he heard a splash, followed by wet flailing and a loud high pitched meow.
Staring up at a trembling black eyed Sherlock John was unfazed, unrepentant despite his heart thundering in his chest.
“Where are you staying, while you’re in town?” Her focus was split, but only between Irene’s eyes and lips.
“Hello?”
What caused the doctor’s eyes to water was the sight of his late detective floating on his back above the bed, limbs limp, and eyes closed. Both he and the bed were encircled by a ring of light that tinted the white walls a deep ocean blue.
Molly’s past was known to three people in all of England, one of which was currently holding her hands. Her acting skills had been fooling the great Sherlock Holmes for years, with a little help from both the seated and unseated british governments.
Was Sherlock’s suicide his fault?
The man’s voice had begun to rise but Mycroft silenced him with the rase of his hand.
John could feel something not quite, but akin to, electricity shoot up his arm, and the light of the barrier rippled and crackled as Sherlock’s lax frame fell atop the plush bed.
“How did you know…,” John furrowed his brow.
He closed his eyes and shuddered; every blink seemed to bring forth the image of Sherlock plummeting, the heaping thud as he met the concrete.
“No, I haven't spoken to my therapist. There's nothing to talk about. He was alive and now he's not.” John swallowed down the last of his whiskey in two long gulps, coughing for a moment at the burn, before standing and slipping his hand from under Mary’s. “Thank you Mary,” he began taking a few bills from his wallet and placing them on the table. “Really, it's very kind of you but I'm okay. Stiff upper lip and all that.” He began walking away but turned, swaying a bit, “tell everyone not to worry. I'll see you on Monday,” he said with only a slight slur.
“Thank you Lenora.” Mycroft pinched the bridge of his nose. “Give him my regards won’t you?”
The cat continued on until it came to a thick wooden door covered in ivy. John would have thought it abandoned if it weren’t for the warm glow from the window and the crescent moon shaped sign that read closed. The cat turned back to him and meowed before walking through the small flap at it’s base.
John sat his glass down with an almost smile, “I'm sorry Mary, I um...I'm not all here right now.”
“You've also been hungover nearly every morning since Sher…,” she cleared her throat at John’s wince. “Since he died.”
The whole situation was strange.
‘John,’ Sherlock added a bit more bass to his voice, hoping for his former air of authority and hoping the medic didn’t notice it’s quiver, straightening up taller on his knees. ‘Go.’
“I'm sorry?”
‘Hum,’ John wondered. He opened the window and followed her feathery swishing tail up the ladder on to the roof. The pair stood for a moment taking in the huge hunters moon overhead. It was the largest John had ever seen it and it seemed close enough to reach out and touch.
Sherlock shook his head with a sad smile and sighed, ‘I love you John Watson.’
(See the end of the chapter for
The beeping was so light, only someone trained to sleep lightly would have heard it, which was why Mycroft was slowly shifting and blinking the sleep from his eyes.
“You also kept that bastard from killing me.” Irene squeezed her hands. “And when I was released from the hospital Lenny was waiting for me with passports, cash, and a safe house.”
When the grieving man didn't answer she continued. “Have you thought about talking to someone John, a professional or...anyone?” She touched his hand, “You have friends John, we all care about you...I care….”
The soldier looked over at his clock. It read twelve o’clock, midnight.
Molly laughed and shook her head, “anywhere, you could literally be anywhere.”
“Shouldn’t you be asleep,” a woman yawned into the phone.
Sherlock visibly deflated, sagging against the barrier. The taller man closed his eyes, again resting his forehead against the transparent blue wall. ‘I can’t leave John. I physically can’t.’
The first dream came three months to the day after Sherlock’s fall, and it began as John was startled out of bed.
Looking into Irene’s eyes today had been the third.
The room was massive, lavishly decorated with oversized furniture and a carpet he could feel bend beneath his well worn trainers. There was a large round bed at its center that sat directly beneath a similarly sized round skylight.
The word died on his lips, his eyes wide and immediately wet.
‘Sherlock,’ the doctor whispered softly. ‘It’s okay.’ Skerlock flinched as the soldier cupped his cheek, the black receding from his nearly turned right eye. The dead man turned into the hand with a lick to its palm, eager for every scent and taste of his more human half.
When she looked up it was with a mirth and clarity that had taken nearly two decades to find.
‘John!’
‘That would be a bad idea.’ Sherlock rolled his shoulder, a strange look of hunger passing over his features. ‘I’ve been put in here for a reason John.’ He shook his dark head, closing his eyes, ‘I don’t want to hurt you.’
John almost laughed at Sherlock’s, ‘don’t be thick John,’ expression.
Carefully he disentangled himself from the strong arms of the greying man next to him, but he stopped to lightly sweep his fingers through the salt and pepper strands, frowning at the realization that he’d probably been the cause of most of them.
For a moment he feared his knees would give out, but he steadied himself in the doorway.
“Doctor Watson, I understand that this is a trying time for you, but my brother….”
John laughed as he thought of his days following the bellowing tails of his detective’s belstaff across these rooftops.
The man in question grit his teeth, staring at John’s throat.
As he wandered down the street in a random direction a sleek black car slowed to a crawl next to him.
The pair stared at each other, before a small smile began to creep across the consulting detective’s lips. ‘John I...John!’
The small cat did not look amused as she flicked a paw at his face, splashing him with water.
He braced himself on the arm of his old chair and stood.
Looking up into shimmering azure eyes John spoke in a low voice, ‘I’m here, I’m with you Sherlock...If there’s work to be done than do let’s crack on.’
‘No, please! Let him stay! Just a while longer...please!’
And to Charles...his first boyfriend.
“Their connection is extraordinary….” The woman stopped abruptly.
The cat stretched out on his chest placing a hairy paw on his lips and John chuckled. Suddenly the cat stood and walked to the edge of the bed, turning back to whine at him again.
‘Who Bunny, I don’t know, why do cats do anything.’
John turned wide eyes on the door, he’d know that voice anywhere.
“Thank you….. I’m just so so shocked...but pleased,” she stumbled. “That you’re here. After our last meeting I never thought I’d see you again. I thought.” Molly shook her head and sniffed, forcing herself to keep contact with the eyes she’d been trying to avoid for over a decade. “I know what I did was...unforgivable….”
When the wind finally dried his tears he rubbed at his leg. The throbbing was intense so he hailed a cab.
“The data is still being analyzed. It’s taking some time but the readings so far do seem to be similar.” The british government sighed feigning weariness, “we will have more data by tomorrow evening and I’ll have my secretary brief you…,”
The doctor spun, eyes darting around the room and landing on the cat still sitting on top of his dresser, clearly watching him. His mouth fell open as the cat, looking him in the eyes, knocked his clothes off the dresser again.
Mycroft closed and locked the door behind him before coming to a stop in front of a massive bookshelf. His fingers deftly pulled a well worn but sturdy leather bound book forward, “A Tangled Skein”.
Molly tried to keep the mirth in her voice, “I couldn’t have lived knowing you weren’t taken care of.” She scooted her chair closer. “I still can’t.”
The British government only took two days off a year and nothing short of the apocalypse was going to keep him from it.
to be kidding me.”
“That,” John said. “And…”
you here?” John asked. “Why now?”
“That’s nice,” Birdy said, and didn’t ask any further questions on the subject. John tried to lift an eyebrow for a shared joke with Sherlock—
And if it’s inevitable that you must fall,
He told her he understood.
“You’re around a lot more frequently,” Sherlock said one evening, apropos of nothing.
“If you could have your panic attack a little quieter,” Sherlock said. “Some of us are trying to sleep.” John could feel the rumble of Sherlock’s words against his lips. Oh Christ that was good.
“I’m better at it than you,” Sherlock said. A little smile twisted at the edge of his lips.
, Sherlock had said to John last night.
John shrugged, a small smile flitting across his face. “Just trying to be sure I get a good night’s sleep. I want to be on high alert for this bloke who’s coming to kill us.”
Sherlock ran a hand over John’s cheek. His thumb left a smudge in the pale dust. “John,” he whispered.
“What’s the business with the organs?” John asked, doing his best to swat the flies away from his face.
“—which he didn’t,” John said. “I’m all right, Sherlock. I’m still here. All in one piece.” He considered. “Well. Mostly.”
advantage...”
But then, if he’s hungry, you’re bloody
John made some sort of moaning noise in response and nearly told Sherlock that he could touch wherever he wanted.
You barely have the chance to glance around Trafalgar Square before Sherlock is at your side.
“Why not?”
Sherlock shushed him, punctuating the sound with a swirl of his thumb over the head of John’s cock. John tried to breathe through the pillow. Sherlock knew how to make him come like this, with just his hand; Sherlock knew exactly what touches would make John’s body tremble and his eyes roll back in his head. Sherlock was using those touches now—every last one of them, the bastard—but too slow, too soft to ever make John come. John whimpered into the pillow.
John felt his jaw tense. He nodded, eyes still on the floor. Of course Sherlock was right. Only Sherlock could manage to be right even from the bloody grave. John sighed, looking around the room once more, wishing for a dead body. He would have gone back to that day in an instant, the day with the pink lady. He would have given anything in the world to be crouched down on a dirty floor, sniffing at a corpse with Sherlock.
Sherlock gestured to John,
“I’m fine,” Sherlock said, although he hadn’t taken any time to do any sort of assessment on the state of his own body. He was sure everything was fine. John was the most important thing at the moment.
You stare at him. You certainly hadn’t noticed any of that. “That’s incredible,” you say. “That little trick of yours.”
As I mentioned after the first chapter, there IS a real family that manages the tours and guests on the Island, but it is not my intention for the O’Sullivans to represent them. I know nothing about them and I hope to god they never, ever read this. (And if they happen to be reading this right now...hello! I’m sorry.)
“You didn’t think I’d mourn you, Sherlock?” John asked. “You didn’t think I’d grieve? You didn’t think I’d have bloody nightmares about you? About you falling, hitting the pavement, lying there pale and dead? You didn’t think any of that was going to
, Sherlock,” John said.
John tilted his head, catching Sherlock’s eye. Sherlock looked sincere, determined.
“Spread,” John said.
Sherlock slipped under the covers just behind him. The mattress dipped at the shift in weight, sliding John closer to Sherlock as he settled in. The bed in Mummy and Father Holmes’ guest room seemed to be older than everyone in the house combined and let out an angry screech at the movement. Sherlock shifted onto his side, fitting himself into the curve of John’s body, and the grind of metal on metal echoed through the room. The headboard, not to be outdone by the mattress, clattered against the wall. This was the cacophony that occurred anytime one of them got into, out of, or shifted in the slightest against the bed, and John doubted he would grow used to it anytime soon.
“Ah,” John said. “When you were away, then.” The old anger gave a groan.
Days pass, as days usually do.
the kind that came in glass-blown bottles
John tugged at the restraints on his wrists. He couldn’t see how or with what he was bound, but the scratching along his wrists made him certain it was rope. Each wrist seemed to be tied separately, connected with a small bit of rope to keep his hands behind his back. John cursed. Were his wrists bound together he might be able to wiggle out of the rope, flexing and wriggling his hands until he created enough space to slip free, dislocate a thumb if need be. As it was, the ropes were as tight as they could be around his wrists, nearly cutting off circulation. No way to wriggle out. This wasn’t, it would appear, the Taibhse Brother’s first go at tying up a hostage.
“No,” Sherlock said, barely paying attention to John’s questions. “No. I’m fine.” John appeared largely uninjured, save for the scratches along his face. He had adequate movement of all limbs, was able to shift his weight from leg to leg without wincing. He seemed lucid, sharp, albeit a bit panicked. “You’re all right?” Sherlock asked again. He was apparently in need of ample verification at the moment, beyond even what he could see with his own eyes. He needed John to tell him that he was all right, to
Sherlock took the opportunity to mouth at John’s cheek. “That was ages ago,” he said.
Gilly had a bit of an annoying ringtone, something high and chirpy and maddeningly melodic. John had heard it countless times, and it made his teeth grind. As such, it didn’t take him particularly long to recognize the sound as it drifted through his bedroom.
“It’s good,” he said, although it wasn’t.
“Yeah,” John said. It sounded more than a little idiotic of him when broken down like this, but in the moment it made perfect sense. “Yeah. I did.”
You’re just staring now. You hope you don’t accidentally stumble into traffic.
“That flashdrive,” he said. “The one you gave me, with your initials on it. Was there ever anything on it?”
“Right,” John said. “But
“Best not to discuss it,” Sherlock said.
Fitz glanced up at him, happily licking his chops. Then he returned to his plate.
“Aye,” John said again, inwardly flinching at his own terrible accent. He had just committed himself to being silent and doing his best to maneuver the wheelbarrow through the field without tipping the whole thing over when he remembered that he and Sherlock were, in fact, supposed to be investigating a death or two. “So,” John said, mustering the best Irish accent he could. “Did you know Declan well?”
“Regardless,” Sherlock said. “I’ll take care not to do it very often. Even with those methods, the act of kissing—however fake—is quite intimate. I will only utilize that strategy if strictly necessary, as should you.”
.” His eyes lit up. “There’s more. So much more than the flash drive.”
Sherlock found his brain spinning a bit at John’s admission that he had stitched himself up before. It wasn’t surprising—military doctor, survived a war—but it created a bit of a firestorm in Sherlock’s brain, a medley of,
John shoved himself up into sitting, the old anger alive and roaring once more in his chest, ready to scare the villagers. “The point is, I can’t watch you die again,” he shouted. “I can’t watch you fall again. I can’t watch you pitch off the edge of a cliff in front of me when there’s nothing I can do about it.”
“I wish to say hello to our new friend,” Sherlock said. “And I hear that guns make terrific icebreakers. You stay here, and—”
They were seated at their usual table, just by the window. This table, John noticed, was always available whenever he and Sherlock dined here, which seemed unlikely to be a coincidence. Either the table was perpetually available for some reason, Sherlock called ahead to reserve the spot, or Angelo had whoever was sitting there unceremoniously cleared out as soon as he saw the two of them coming. John knew it was one of those three options, and had a feeling that it wasn’t the first two.
“This name would be common in any of the Baltic states,” Sherlock said. “She might intend to hold onto this identity, at least for the time being.”
“Ah,” said Sherlock.
“Yeah,” John said, his voice sounding choppy. “Yeah. I suppose so.”
There was that pitying look again.
“Sherlock,” John said. He twisted again in Sherlock’s grip, but Sherlock held him tight. “Sherlock, if I had known. If I had known what you did, why you did it…”
will always suffice.”
All of that was much too long to speak out loud. His tongue had officially retired for the evening.
The two of them drifted together, sharing lazy kisses and slow touches as they skated the edge of consciousness, dipping in and out of the darkness as their bodies saw fit. At some point, John managed to wrest himself from Sherlock’s grip and retrieve a wet flannel from the loo. Sherlock was vaguely aware of the cool fabric sweeping slowly across his chest, down his stomach, between his legs. John cleaning him. Patching him up. Making him good as new. John tossed the flannel to the side and settled himself back in bed, right at Sherlock’s side where he belonged. Sherlock made room for him, pulled him back into his arms. John sighed, his breaths slow against Sherlock’s collarbone. He was hurtling towards sleep, the both of them were.
“More?” Sherlock asked
“Right,” Sherlock said, lowering the gauze to John’s leg. He tried to be as careful, as gentle as possible, but John cried out at the feel of the saline on his wound all the same. His head rocketed backwards, colliding with the wall just behind the toilet. He didn’t seem to notice, cursing and slamming his head against the wall as Sherlock patted his leg with gauze.
followed, honestly. Unfortunately, the particular spot that Sherlock had John running tonight just so happened to be a back alley that was slick with rainwater and the drained sludge from several rusted-out skips. The ground was a bit more slippery than one might have predicted. Rather, the ground was a bit more slippery than
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “That.”
John reached out a tentative hand. When she didn’t dart away, he placed the hand on the top of her wooly head, a slow touch. Lucy stepped closer. She didn’t seem to mind being petted. Declan must have pet her often, John figured. That must be why she was so friendly. That and the little scraps Declan would feed her. He remembered what Sherlock said about the dolphin, the way it comes back for treats and everyone mistakes it for genuine affection. A conditioned response that looks like love. John felt his throat tighten and did his best to wipe his mind clean, a rough sleeve over a chalkboard. Traces lingered.
“Will I see you again?” you ask.
You call me homosexual
for another person,” Sherlock snapped. “Because based on my observations of your own romantic history, I would dare to say that
“We have been,” Mary said. “Mostly. With the exception of one fairly sizable issue.” She took a deep breath, seeming to steel herself. “Sherlock Holmes.”
“The one we just did,” John said. “Thought I’d get a head start on it.”
Sherlock widened his knees, dropping himself down onto his elbows, and John grabbed at Sherlock’s arsecheeks, spreading him apart and sinking his mouth into Sherlock’s arse. Sherlock made a gasping noise that shook his body and his forehead dropped into the mattress, his hips bucking back against John’s face. John’s tongue teased and swirled and explored, dipping just inside Sherlock’s hole, pulling moans from Sherlock with each movement of his mouth.
John looked up at Sherlock. With the bright sky behind him, he was nothing more than a silhouette atop the roof, hand to his ear as he held his mobile, coat fluttering in the wind. John hadn’t known what his face looked like that day, but it hadn’t stopped him from picturing it thousands of times over the years. Pained. Contorted. Similar, John figured, to the way his own face looked at the moment.
“I knew everything about you too,” Sherlock said.
“I think Declan was on the run from someone,” John said. “In with a bad lot.”
Mary sighed. Her eyes wavered between him and the ground. Her face still held traces of the unfamiliar sharpness John witnessed as she crouched behind the table with her weapon drawn, but she was starting to fade back into the Mary that John had once known—or rather, thought he knew. She allowed a bit of her exterior to crumble. She looked tired. “I imagine you’ll want an explanation,” she said.
This particular bit of ruins, like the others, didn’t have a roof anymore but still had most of the walls intact, standing tall and blocking out the moonlight. Little bits of light came in through the holes where the windows used to be, casting the center of the building in a patchy light that only served to darken the shadowy corners. John could barely see a damn thing as he ran in after Sherlock.
“Do you want to go back to sleep, John?” Sherlock asked.
It was foolish, Sherlock considered, to ever believe he didn’t know how to do this. To say he didn’t know how to do this was to say that he didn’t know how to walk, how to speak, how to breathe. Loving John was as easy as breathing, and of course Sherlock had known all along.
“Are you not panicking?” John asked, likely a bit louder than was strictly needed. “How are you not panicking?”
He let his eyes slide closed, unable to help the smile that spread across his face.
“Can’t argue with the consensus,” John said, and he didn’t. He agreed with it, actually. He was fully aware that he had been insufferable since Sherlock died. He didn’t seem to have very much control over it. In an odd, nonsensical way, it felt as if a part of him died as well, the part that was responsible for being happy. “Best to steer clear, I’d say.”
“Is this something we do now?” Sherlock asked. There didn’t seem to be even a hint of emotion in his voice.
“Such a silly law,” Mrs. Hudson said, “making the two of you wait a full year to apply for divorce.” She looked to Sherlock, who didn’t seem to be paying attention to the clippings he shuffled through anymore. “Don’t you think, Sherlock?”
he thought. His fingers squeaked against the glass.
Sherlock’s expression was unreadable. He almost looked bored. It was the expression, John realized, that he had seen on Sherlock so many times before—as the two shared a cab together, as the two crossed paths after John emerged from the shower at Baker Street, as Sherlock stood by John’s side at John’s wedding. It was a communication to the world that Sherlock was still waters, bland and uncaring. If John didn’t know any better, he would say it was genuine, that Sherlock felt nothing at all—never had, never would. Indeed, John had claimed as such many times over. But—as Sherlock so joyfully loved to point out—John was wrong. John considered that he much preferred not knowing when he was wrong.
Sherlock blinked.
Some of the anger faded out of John’s face. He watched Sherlock, his mouth opening and closing, understanding.
John chuckled. “All of it?”
“And I was right under your nose for so long.” Gilly made a little
John pressed his eyes closed.
Sherlock collapsed at John’s side, draping an arm over his stomach. “Oh, I doubt she’ll be coming anywhere near this bedding during our stay here.”
He was falling.
John looked up. Sherlock stood in the doorway to the kitchen; John hadn’t even heard him leave the bedroom over Rosie’s cries. He was wearing an oversized vest and pyjama bottoms, his dressing gown open and fluttering at his sides. His hair was a right mess and it looked as if he hadn’t shaved in a few days. Still, John was tremendously happy to see him out of bed.
John reached behind him, grabbing at Sherlock’s hair to let him know he’d spotted it. Sherlock lifted his head and spun John in his arms, backing him against the counter.
“Further,” Sherlock said. “It isn’t just the doors. He makes contestants do a whole host of things. He has them wager on how much money is in a handbag. He has them think about what might be in a box. He has them guess at how much certain products cost.”
“It certainly isn’t,” Mary said. “Because I never stood a chance, now did I? It would have been a youth league against Manchester United if it was. I didn’t compete, John. I never did, never had any interest in it. But,” she said carefully, “I’m fairly certain I got clobbered all the same.”
Lucy said nothing.
Sherlock blinked.
, John had said. He was looking.
“The way you…” Lestrade clutched at his pint as if it would bring him luck in this catastrophe of a conversation, “follow each other. The way you look at each other.”
you’d better let me be
“John,” Sherlock hissed, but John was already up, crouched as low as he could and darting for the open wall that used to be the sleeping quarters. He heard Sherlock curse under his breath and push himself up on his knees, aiming the gun. John approached the open wall and could see the shooter now, hunkered behind a tree. John wasn’t sure if he could perfectly hit the man with the bottle—now fairly on fire—from this distance, but the goal was really just to scare him, anyway. John hurled the bottle over his head with all his might.
,” he was still cursing as he tugged his mobile from his pocket. He dialed Sherlock, watching the boat disappear in the distance.
In truth, John was still a bit dazed from his dream, and more than a little dismayed to find that he was still partially hard in his pants. However, the sound of a screaming infant is one of the most effective arousal-killers John ever encountered, and his erection threw its hands in the air and quit before he even got to Rosie’s bedroom. It had been an odd dream. John could use the change of scenery.
,” Sherlock shouted, his words rising over the wind. “Everyone leaves and you’re no exception, so it would be most helpful if you would stop pretending that you are. It is pure falsehood for you to act as if I could ever have the ability to keep you and it is utter lunacy to think that I would ever
“You aren’t exceedingly heavy,” Sherlock said. He surveyed the length of John’s body. “You haven’t gained
“He was out of bed, at least,” Lestrade said. “Showered. Seemed like an improvement.”
He considered jumping out of bed and trying to convene with Sherlock at the police station. He needed to see Sherlock again, needed to wrap his arms around him and kiss him and tell him that he loved him more than anything. He didn’t care if the whole of Scotland Yard watched.
Silence
Sherlock still knelt, his hands balled into fists against the barrier and his forehead resting against it as well. His eyes were squeezed shut but John could see the wetness on his cheeks. His hair was longer, touching his shoulders, and his curls were wild. Though his face was clean shaven and his shirt and trousers were crisp.
It was the same voice that lead him through the mile long corridors of the British Library to the ancient medical texts. Somehow the latin seemed familiar.
‘No….’
His eyes began to water at the thought of being given the chance to say those three simple words to his best friend.
The shorter blond was panting, his eyes screwed shut and leaking.
John arched with a wail of passion as he came, and a moment later there was a ringing in his ears as he heard voices yelling and loud beeping around him.
“John, John wait,” Mary called, but the doctor was already out the door. She slumped back into her seat with a sigh. “Oh John.”
He almost laughed as he imagined Sherlock urging him on with a, ‘don’t be dull John, clearly the cat is talking to you’.
And ultimately that voice was the final nudge to follow Mike Stamford to that fateful St. Bart’s Hospital.
The dream had been intense. Was it just his mind trying to process his waking life.
The cat walked quickly in the light London fog, keeping just far enough ahead that John could see the swish of it’s fluffy black tail. The tinkling of it’s bell helped as well as the feline took a sudden left onto thick cobblestone streets that John had never seen before.
‘Does losing  just a “friend” really hurt like this John?’
The two stared at each other for a moment before bursting into laughter.
‘What do you need Sherlock?’
<_< I looked it up on bing translate…..
‘John,’ Sherlock sighed as he began. ‘I...can’t explain what’s happening right now, but you must heed my words, if only this once.’ He couldn’t meet his partner’s eyes as he continued. ‘You have to leave this place. Right now.’
