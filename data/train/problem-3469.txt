“Yeah. Hopefully Dean won’t be too mad. I know how he gets when he’s busy.”
“See, I
“Everything’s fine, Dean, calm down. We just need to talk to you.”
“Sure.” Cas sat beside him but left some distance.
“Hanging out with you is never a waste of my time. Hey, if all else fails, I’m sure Jo won’t mind giving us a couple bottles of liquor to kiss instead.” That got Castiel to laugh.
“You think they’ll show up?” Dean asked once they were in Baby.
“You’re in love with me?” was all Dean managed to say. Cas smiled softly.
“Thank you,” Cas said softly. Dean responded with another light kiss to the temple. Sam came back with plates, silverware, and a bottle of syrup, which Gabriel immediately claimed for himself.
“He’s blowing bubbles in his room. Claire’s using some magic to turn them into shapes. They’re having fun. What do you look all brooding and pensive about?”
“Only if you’re sure you do. I don’t want things to be weird. I like spending time with you.” Dean hated to admit it out loud, but it was true.
“Charlie! You can’t just offer my mouth to random dudes!
“Go find him and tell him we’re leaving in thirty.”
“You didn’t sleep, did you?” Dean shook his head. “Do you wanna go out?” Dean shook his head again. “Okay.” Cas sat on the couch and situated them so Dean’s head was resting on his chest.
“What?”
Well damn. Way to call me out. I don’t exactly remember you complaining.
“I don’t hear you denying it,” Gabriel pointed out.
He had saved his favorite photos from every relationship he had ever had since the age of sixteen. It was only six years, but there were close to a hundred different people. All different ages, races, ethnicities, body types, and genders; all of them just as beautiful as the last. He had been contemplating compiling them all, and calling it “Lost in Love”. Then he met Tessa and thought he had finally found his muse. Turned out, she just liked having her picture taken. There was no depth to her, so he was back to his original plan.
“You’re paranoid.”
“You gettin’ bored over there, Winchester?” Cas asked after about two hours.
“I’m going to get you some water.” Cas got up and headed to the bar. Dean followed for lack of anything else to do. Everyone else was still listening to Sam talk about school. Not that Dean wasn’t interested, but they had already talked about how Sam was doing in school. He didn’t need to hear all the stories again. He sat beside Cas at the bar.
“Sorry. Didn’t mean to startle you.” Dean leaned back and took a more thorough look at him.
“Not particularly.” Dean flashed his famous, quirky grin. He pushed off the wall and walked over. “How’s it going?”
“Well, I will say this,” Claire said, “you two make an adorable couple.” She looked at Jack. “We’ll think about it. Does that work?”
“I guess we are.” Jody dropped off the to-go boxes. “Come on, angel.” The park wasn’t a far walk and fifteen minutes later they were sitting against a tree by the lake. It was a little chilly out, but Castiel hardly noticed. He and Dean were pressed shoulder to shoulder, watching the water in comfortable silence while they ate. They shared their pie the same way they always did, only, without the table between them, it felt different. They were closer and Dean was definitely teasing him. Castiel played into it, dragging his lips across the plastic fork a little slower than usual.
Lisa Braeden was, for lack of a better description, a goddess among women. At least, she was in Dean’s eyes, and standing there in skin-tight jeans and one of Dean’s old t-shirts, she had never looked better. Her dark brown hair was pulled up in a messy ponytail, and her caramel eyes flashed with annoyance.
“Yes, I kissed him.”
“Don’t mess up the bathroom!” Gilda called after him. Dean rolled his eyes. Sure, he was a guy, but he wasn’t a complete mess. He knew how to clean up after himself. He locked himself in the bathroom, and ran the shower. He stood under the water a little longer than necessary, letting his mind wander. As he was rinsing the shampoo out of his hair, he found himself thinking about the guy with the camera. He really wished he had gotten a name. The picture thing was a little annoying, but he couldn’t deny that the man was attractive. Disastrous dark brown hair that was damn near black, and blue eyes so vivid they looked like actual sapphires. If it were any other time, he probably would’ve made a move, but he was fresh out of a relationship, and he still loved Lisa.
“Dean, you have to calm down,” Sam said, tone perfectly even. “Whatever’s in there could be dangerous and you need your trigger hand steady.” Dean touched the gun tucked into his jeans. He’d been carrying one ever since Adam, just in case. He took a deep breath.
“We’re talking about you. So you don’t need my help?”
“Don’t tempt me.” Cas once again choked on his coffee.
“I know. Me, too.” Dean returned the smile, and leaned in for a kiss.
Updating this while standing in line at the DMV
“Shut up.” Dean kissed the top of Charlie’s head. “Merry Christmas, kiddo. Sam and Gabe here yet?”
“Maybe. Anyway, I think I’m going to enjoy this class even more than I thought I would.” Dean grinned.
“I actually wanted to talk to you guys about something.”
lay, he really didn’t see what the big deal was. He was an amazing singer, though, so Cas didn’t have a problem staying.
“Always.” He found two clean glasses and a bottle of scotch. “So, really, how’s school going?”
“I think so?”
“About ten seconds. I’m with Dean on this. We’re gonna find you someone to kiss.” Gabriel wiggled his eyebrows and Castiel shoved him.
“Gabriel can do that for him like I did for--.”
“Then why did you?”
“You don’t have to.”
Sorry I was working on something. I’m up for a late lunch if you still want to.
“Word of advice, take what Christian, Mark, and Gwen say with an ocean of salt.” Dean opened his duffle and tossed Adam one of his spare rifles. “Try that.”
“I’m sorry, Dean, I shouldn’t’ve brought her up.”
“I’m serious, Castiel.”
“Great. Pick a movie and I’ll order burgers.”
“Don’t you have friends to go talk to?” He asked.
“Sure.” Dean took his plate and got off the couch. Cas started typing on his phone again. He needed…something. He looked up and watched Dean move around the kitchen. He smiled a little. Dean caught him staring and smiled.
“Is that what he teaches? He was the only one who had available office hours.” Dean opened his laptop. “He seemed interested in my paper. Strict though. I was two minutes late because coffee and he seemed put out.”
“Dean, it’s been a long day for everyone. Talk to Sam when he gets home and talk to Charlie tomorrow. Take it one step at a time. You have a right to be mad. I’m mad about it, too.” Dean snorted.
“All right. See ya. I love you.”
“Oh. Sorry. But in my defense, you started it.”
“Can I ask you something?” Dean smiled.
“I didn’t realize how much I needed you in my life until I left. I was miserable without you and I never wanna feel that way again. The second you showed up at the diner, I knew. Full disclosure, I bought that ring at the same pawn shop I bought the locket. It wasn’t as expensive as it looks.”
Dean chewed his lip. He wanted to see Charlie, but he couldn’t stand Cas up and he couldn’t ask Charlie if Cas could tag along. That was a recipe for trouble.
“Oh, I was talking to Maggie.” Dean smirked and Cas rolled his eyes.
“That’s the second part of the game. 52 Pickup.” Dean narrowed his eyes.
“You’re pretty backed up then.” Dean grinned.
“I didn’t mean what I said,” Cas said. “I was trying to stop you from leaving. I didn’t want you out there by yourself while you were like that. I never wanted to end our relationship. I love you.” Dean’s laugh was dry and humorless.
Castiel leaned against the bathroom sink and tried to catch his breath. Dean was teasing him. And he was teasing right back. He knew drinking together was a bad idea and he should’ve known Dean wouldn’t behave himself. Even if he’d had every intention, alcohol lower inhibitions and heightened sex drive. They were venturing into dangerous territory. It didn’t help that Dean was being overly nice. He’d just sat through a two-hour bee documentary because Castiel mentioned he liked bees. It was a level of kindness Castiel wasn’t used to and it was only fueling his growing crush.
We don’t have to if it’s weird
“Yeah, but I figured you would’ve tried.”
Cas heard his phone ringing on the night stand. He ignored it. It rang four more times before he heard the buzzer for his door. He picked up his phone and texted Gabriel.
Castiel was about to put his phone down when he got another text, this one from Charlie. It was a screenshot of an Instagram post from Jo. It was the picture of him and Dean at the bar, smiling like idiots. Jo had captioned it “Young Love”.
“All right. I can get food at work.” Cas moved to get up.
“Do you guys always fight like that?” Nick asked.
“Gabriel!” Cas snapped. He felt a tear slip down his cheek. He turned away from his brother. “Leave me alone.” It came out barely above a whisper. Cas felt Gabriel move in to hug him and pushed him away. He didn’t want to be touched. He walked away, hoping Gabriel had better sense than to follow him. He scratched at his arm again. Now that his brother had told him to stop, he was fixated on it.
“Nothing. Have a good night.”
“Don’t worry, Dean. I still love you.”
“All right. Have fun.” Dean smacked his brother on the back of the head as he walked by.
“Yeah, yeah, okay. Tell Gabe I said hi.”
“You’re not wrong, but I should’ve listened to you more instead of taking everything as an attack. You were trying to help and I was…I was a dick to you. I love you and I shouldn’t’ve treated you the way I did.” Cas took Dean’s hand.
“I wish things were different,” Cas said almost to himself.
“Why were you talking to Dean Winchester?” Cas groaned.
“Fine, but you’re coming with me.”
“Give me your phone.”
Busy?
The haunted look in Cas’s eyes crossed Dean’s mind. Whatever the issue was, it was much bigger than what happened that morning. Something was slowly eating away at him. Dean didn’t think he was asking for much. Just a little bit of information so he could better understand the shifter. He wanted to help, but he couldn’t do that when Cas would only give him surface information. He understood not wanting to share certain things, but Cas kept everything hidden behind cryptic words of advice. It was frustrating.
“I love it, Dean. Have you listened to that record yet?”
“I’ll get hell for it later, I’m sure. Come on, let’s get her waxed so you can get outta here.”
Dean drummed his fingers against the window sill in time to the Zeppelin song playing on the record player. The whole family had been on lockdown since Dean gave his father Chuck’s hit list and he was bored out of his mind. He understood John’s reasoning, but it seemed a little extreme. If anything were seriously wrong, Cas would’ve told him. At least, Dean hoped he would. Or maybe he couldn’t. Maybe that was why he had cut off all communication. That was bothering Dean much more than it should. It had been nearly three weeks since he last heard from Cas. It had been nearly three weeks since he had seen another person that wasn’t his family. He was going stir crazy. The record ended and he got up to change it. There was a knock at his door before Sam walked in.
The lights dimmed and Dean settled in to watch the coming attractions. Everything seemed pretty boring. Five minutes into the movie, Dean had already bit back six snide comments and was really wishing Sammy was sitting in the empty seat next to him. He popped a piece of popcorn into his mouth and chuckled to himself.
“Yup!” Dean answered.
“How so?”
“Tell the press whatever you want,” he said bitterly. “Once this is over, I’m done.”
“He’s a good kid. I meant to ask you earlier, are you human? Normally I wouldn’t ask, but you didn’t seem fazed when Dean told you I’m a shifter and he’s a vamp.”
Dean ended up falling asleep again. The next time he woke up he felt immensely better. He picked up his phone. It was nearly ten and he had a few dozen missed calls and texts. There was also a plate with a burger on it sitting on his night stand. Underneath it was a note.
“Cas, honey, I’ve met your cousin. If Dean didn’t give him his number, it just means he has taste.”
“Please don’t yell.”
“Well, then what would you say?” Meg asked, “Because it seems like you’re spending an awful lot of time with him.”
“Goodnight, Dean.” Dean stole one last kiss before he left Cas in the motel room and went back to his apartment. Sam was on him the second he walked in the door.
“Bye, Meg.” Meg blew him a kiss and walked out the door. Cas shook his head and laughed. He had just opened his book again when his phone vibrated on the counter. He glanced at the screen
“Something tells me you’ve already figured it out. You just don’t know it yet.” She had a point, but Dean wasn’t going to tell her that. Instead, he picked up his phone.
I’ll be there 🙂
Dean looked back at Garth, who shrugged.
“Okay, Dean, I’m clocking out.” Dean looked up from where he was cleaning off the prep table. Charlie was standing in the doorway to the kitchen.
“Dean.”
“Do you have nightmares about your ex?”
“I told you to order your own.”
“Then you know what you have to do.”
speechless. He forced himself to stand up and walked over to the desk. Cas waited until the kids had left, then closed the door. He walked back over to the desk and opened the top drawer. He pulled out the piece of pie he had confiscated when Dean walked in. “Thought you might want this back.” Dean was so happy to see his pie that he moved without thinking. He grabbed Cas and hugged him.
“Happy Valentine’s Day, Dean,” Cas said, but his voice wasn’t steady, and he knew tears were slipping down his cheeks.
“Oh. Why didn’t you just say that?” He picked up one of the glasses and tossed it back. “Oh, God. What’s in these?”
“Dean, are you--?” Dean was off the couch and out the back door before his brother finished the sentence. Of course he wasn’t okay. How the fuck could he
“I wasn’t lost, I was in the bathroom.” He turned to Dean. “Dean, this is my coworker Meg, my brother Gabriel, and my cousin Balthazar. Guys, this is my friend Dean.”
“Who told you that? You know what, it doesn’t matter because it’s not true. We’re friends so I care about you. Helping you isn’t a waste of my time.”
“I just miss him.” He took his laptop back and pressed play on one of the videos. “He’d make a good politician. He’s confident and he actually believes in what he’s saying.” Gabriel watched.
“In whose world is that helping?”
“I’ve tried talking to them, but they don’t listen. Except Gabriel, but even he doesn’t understand that sometimes I really just need to be alone.”
“Fine, fine, but this is killing me.”
“I know you can, but you shouldn’t have to help me with everything. I’m an adult. I should be able to take care of myself.”
“Well, no, but…do you want me to go?” Guilt was settling in again. They
“It looks like the middle of nowhere.”
“All right, all right, enough.” Jo passed out the game pieces. “We’ve got six pieces and seven teams, who wants to sit this round out?”
,” Sam grumbled, but Dean could hear the smile in his voice. He released him and took a good long look.
Also, please let me know if this sucks. Thanks!
“Don’t go,” Dean said quietly. His voice dropped to barely audible when he added, “Please.” Cas tilted his head. Dean looked small and vulnerable curled up against the side of the building. Like a little kid who just got yelled at by his parents. Against his better judgement (or any judgement really) he put his arm around the vampire. Dean sagged against him like he was the only thing in the world keeping him from collapsing. Cas’s fingers wound their way into Dean’s hair.
“I’ll see if I can do something.”
“Yeah. Just gotta pee. Let me up, angel.” Cas hummed and released his hold on him. Dean pecked his cheek before getting up. Cas snuggled further into the covers. Two months of dating and sharing a bed almost nightly had Cas spoiled. It was getting to a point where he found it hard to sleep without Dean beside him. He registered the bed dipping and, without opening his eyes, reached over. Dean tucked into him, and Cas drifted back into unconsciousness. The next time he woke up, Dean was peppering his face and neck with little kisses.
“I get that a lot. There’s a lot of stories going around about me. Only about half of them are true. I tend to ignore them. Anyone who takes the time to get to know me can judge me for themselves. Anyone who decides to avoid me because of what they’ve heard can go fuck themselves. I don’t care what other people think.”
“Maybe you should tell him yourself.”
“I’m gonna take a cab. Depending on how Mom and Dad react, you’re gonna need me there.” Cas took a deep breath.
weird. It felt…natural. After they finished eating, Dean cleaned up the kitchen while Cas took a quick shower. Dean was sitting on the couch, scrolling through his Netflix when Cas walked out wearing nothing but a towel. Dean groaned.
“Hello, Dean.”
“NO!” Charlie put her hand on Dean’s arm.
Yes, you said you were a mechanic. I know nothing about cars, but do you enjoy it?
“Jo has a crush on Dean, too.”
“Thanks, Cas. So are we eating in tonight?”
“Me, too,” Dean said.
“Okay. Goodbye, Cas.” Cas shook his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Did you get anywhere with your book or are you still blocked?”
Murdering your own brother? Probably life sweetheart.
“I’ll stay as long as you want me around.”
Dinner tomorrow night? Got something I wanna run by you.
“Why should I apologize for being right?” Cas let his camera dangle. Dean didn’t say anything, but Cas caught his small smile.
“You know what? I'm done with this. I'm going to bed.” He turned to leave. "Cas, you’re coming with.”
“I dunno. Chuck seems to trust you.”
“Breakfast,” Cas said, holding up the bag and the coffees. “Charlie says hi, by the way.”
“Then why hasn’t he called or texted or
All right, I was I could say this chapter is better, but...sorry. I promise it gets better eventually.
“Hey, you’re up.” Dean’s smile faltered when they made eye contact. The glass he’d been holding shattered as it hit the floor. Dean ran to Cas’s side of the bed. “Cas, angel, what happened? What’s wrong?” Too many emotions hit Cas all at once. The only way he could think to react was to grab onto Dean’s shirt and hold him close. He felt Dean’s fingers in his hair. “It’s okay, angel, I’m here.”
“Can’t you just pretend you’re an adult?”
“Yes.”
“I know you will.”
“Hey, stop that.” Gabriel pulled his hand away.
“There’s no “right” way to take a picture, Dean. This is the best one I’ve seen from you, though. I feel like I’m there. I wish I had been. It’s been a long time since I’ve actually watched the sun set.”
“You guys sign up for Trivia Night?”
“You wanna come in for a minute?”
Castiel was cleaning the fork when Jody came back over.
“I was just leaving, but thanks.” He looked at his friends. “See ya tomorrow, Benny. Later, Ash. Later, Kev.” He had just barely made it out the door when he felt a hand on his arm.
“Yeah, why?” His eyes widened. “Wait, you’re not…not Baby?”
“Yeah. Yeah, I’m fine, Cas.” He stared down into his whiskey. He needed to leave, but he couldn’t do that without drawing attention to himself.
Dean made it through the rest of his double without incident. He clocked out, thought about going home, and decided he needed a drink instead. He stopped in the bar below his apartment. Ash grinned at him from behind the bar.
“I get it,” Cas cut in with a soft smile. “I’ll be outta here in five minutes.” Dean’s heart sank.
he would be Charlie’s favorite author. The second, if she talked to Dean about his books, did that mean Dean was a fan too? He shook his head. He couldn’t deal with this right now. He took the book into the office, took a minute to collect himself, then went into the kitchen.
“Hey, Cassie! Pancakes’ll be done in a minute.”
“Sure, Gabe.”
“I’m staying because I need them to pay for school. They’re happy I’m becoming a lawyer. They don’t need to know the specifics until after I graduate. I think Gabriel stays because I’m still there. He wants to look out for me.”
Cas smiled to himself. He liked his conversations with Maggie. Maybe she couldn’t talk, but she gave him better advice than anyone he had ever met, including Dean, and his brother. Probably because she didn’t have a personal agenda. Everyone always gave him the advice that would somehow benefit them. Maggie didn’t. Maggie was his best friend, and nothing was ever going to change that. Cas’s phone rang, startling him. He picked it up.
“Sure. You wanna clock me in so I can get to work?” Charlie rolled her eyes, a smile playing at her lips.
“You’re always late, I’m not surprised. Fry?”
Next update will be Sunday!
inside with a hyperactive ten-year-old…” Cas trailed off and Dean nodded.
“Yes, I do, but I don’t want you to inconvenience yourself by walking me home.”
“What is it?”
I do. You know, hindsight being 20/20 and all. I was just so blind. I really thought someone like her could actually love someone like me.”
“He’s our cousin. It’s been a while, he’ll be thrilled to see him.”
“I appreciate that,” he finally managed to say. Cas finally looked up from his book.
“You’re adorable. I didn’t mind. Actually, I was worried you minded, but I didn’t wanna say anything because I thought you’d end our arrangement and…I couldn’t deal with that. You’re the first person I’ve met in a long time that I can actually talk to and you don’t coddle me. You don’t treat me like I’m delicate or broken because of what happened to me. I need that, but no else seems to understand that.”
“Cassie!”
“That’s very sweet, Cas. A little creepy, but very sweet. Also, you don’t have to worry about Sam. He’s a good guy.”
“So what are we drinking tonight, boys?” Meg asked.
“Who are you texting?”
“Are you sure?”
“Cas--.”
“No, I’m gonna say this and then we’re gonna kick that Shadow’s ass all the way back to the fucking Empty where it fucking belongs.”
“Don’t look so smug,” he said. “You only won by one point. We’re gonna slaughter you next week.” Cas took one last picture of Dean, marking fifteen for the night before he scribbled his number down on a cocktail napkin.
“Is that a no?”
“Charlie has on multiple occasions.” Dean picked up the remote and tossed it in Cas’s direction. “You pick something.” Cas took his eyes off his pie and found Dean smiling softly. He smiled back on reflex. Dean’s fingers brushed over the back of his hand. Cas tried to ignore the zip of warmth that spiked through him. A knock on the door broke the moment. Dean got up to answer it. Cas cleaned his plate with his fork and set them both in the sink. Dean set the Chinese food on the counter. “Do you want something to drink?”
“Of course it was,” Cas said.
“I like being with you, too.”
“Told you she gets snippy when she loses.” Bela stood up again, only this time she was stopped by Ellen.
“Will she, though? I think we can conduct ourselves like professionals.” Dean nodded.
“How about you come have breakfast with me and then I’ll take these? Deal?” Sam gave him a soft smile.
“Hey, Cas, what’s up?”
“I’ll think about it.”
“Don’t bother her.”
“She kinda became like a mom to me after mine died. Same with Ellen, which is why I work here and at Harvelle’s.”
“It’s not the same, Gabe.”
“You sure you’re okay, Cas?” Sam asked. Cas smiled.
“Thanks, kiddo, but my abundance of personality doesn’t make up for my lack of ambition. I mean, she’s a business major for God’s sake. I’m a mechanic. It was only a matter of time before this happened. It doesn’t matter. I’ll get over it. What did you wanna run by me?”
“How’s Jessica?”
Cas understood why Dean was mad. He was right, Cas didn’t trust him. He couldn’t. He wanted to, more than anything, but he couldn’t. And not just because he was a Winchester. Cas had made the mistake of trusting a vampire once before and he still wasn’t over it. He wasn’t going to do that to himself again. He wasn’t going to put himself in that position. He wanted to believe that Dean was different, but there would always be doubt. Cas walked into the Roadhouse and looked around. He claimed an empty booth along the left wall and ordered a Coke.
Maybe, still have some work to do
“I’m actually getting somewhere with my new book.”
“Yes, it is. What aren’t you telling me?”
“You, too. This is my little brother.” Gabriel turned to Dean. “You met him yesterday.”
“Of course. Always. You know that.”
“Because you would’ve laughed at me. Or you would’ve been mad at me for waking you up for something this stupid.” Dean felt even worse now. Sure, he and Cas had their disagreements, but he’d thought the former angel trusted him more than that.
“It’s
Rude. Wanna get a drink?
“I’m sorry, it just slipped out. Gabe’s worried about Cas, and frankly I am, too. You’re spiraling, Dean. I’m scared you’re gonna do something…stupid.”
“You think this is funny? See how you like it.” He dropped to his knees on the cold tile. He undid Cas’s jeans and pushed them, along with his boxers, down to his knees.
“You know I love you, right, Cas? I never even considered leaving without you. I also never saw taking you with me as a burden.” Cas smiled.
“Good Lord, Dean. Sounds like you need something stronger than beer.”
Dean pocketed his phone and went downstairs. Sam was sitting in the surveillance room. That’s where Sam spent most of his time when he wasn’t hanging out with the coven. John had put him in charge of all the cameras since he was the most tech savvy. Dean dropped into the big swivel chair next to his brother.
“Trying not to.”
“Really?”
“I work here.”
“You doing okay, Clarence?”
I’ve been thinking about your mouth on me since last weekend. I can’t remember the last time I jerked off this much. Puberty maybe. I’m just glad I’m done with college and survived my finals or this could be a lot worse.
“I hate this,” Dean hissed back.
“Okay.” They went back downstairs. “You know, when you stormed out, Sam wanted to go after you. I told him to let me. He’s not mad at you. He just wants to know that you’re okay.”
“I hate this.”
You still should’ve said something to me.
“Training.”
“Can you work a double next Friday? Ash needs off.”
Now that was weird. Cas had been in Dean’s car, Baby he’d called it, exactly once and they hadn’t actually gone anywhere. Still, he was tired and he didn’t really feel like walking.
“Fine.” He followed his brother to the conference room and slumped in one of the chairs. He knew he wasn’t supposed to do that. He was supposed to steel his face, pretend he was sober, and act like nothing was wrong, but he couldn’t do that. Not this time. Not with Adam dead and the prospect of Cas being dead within the next few days.
“What was that about?”
“Because you two make sense. We all know that the four of us will probably be making decisions together, but on paper, your names look better together than mine and Dean’s. Have you two talked at all about—.”
“I’m in love with you, too,” Dean admitted, surprised his voice wasn’t shaking. “So you want this to be a serious relationship?”
“Sometimes it’s the camera settings, sometimes it’s the lighting, but most of the time it’s just the angle. Now, I can look at something and find the right angle almost immediately, but I’ve spent most of my life doing this. I took classes on this. You haven’t done this a lot, so it might take you a little longer to find the right angle. That’s fine. It doesn’t matter how long it takes you to find the angle, once you do, every picture will look like this.”
physical,” Dean said and Cas rolled his eyes, but he was laughing.
“You don’t like her?”
“Come on, it’s funny.” Cas narrowed his eyes.
“Why?”
“Ya know, you’re the first person I’ve ever met who doesn’t make fun of me for still having cassettes.” Cas returned the smile as he popped one into the player.
“No idea.” Dean sat there for a minute. Iconic. Woman. 1966. Bikini. Cavewoman. Fur. He took a shot.
“God, I want that. I can still feel your hair under my fingers and taste the smoke in your mouth. I want you to touch me so bad.” Dean could still feel Cas’s lips on him and he knew he shouldn’t, but he undid his jeans and reached his hand into his boxers.
“Why should I? You haven’t done anything to hurt me and aside from being an unwilling hitman for your father, you’re really not a bad guy.”
“Dean, you already give me free coffee almost every day. And don’t think I don’t know that you’re paying for that with your own money because Ellen would never let you just give things away. I can pay for drinks.” Dean was just a little too tipsy to argue. Once the bill was settled and they were out on the street, Dean said,
“Oh.” Cas shrugged. “Close enough.”
“And Dean’s scared of planes,” Sam said.
“You’re kidding.”
“Just in time for you to turn in your project.”
“You don’t have to. I’m just skimming.” Sam looked up. “Oh, and I forgot to tell you, we’re moving our study group to weekends at Brady’s house. Becca thought marathon studying might help.”
“Out.”
“It’s a hit list. I thought you should have it. You need to keep your family safe.” Dean stared at the list.
“I was bored. I woke up this morning and decided I wanted a change.” Cas ran his hand through his hair. “Bad color choice?”
They stayed for an hour and Cas actually only fell once. He lost his balance and knocked them both over. Dean ended up on his back with Cas on top of him. Cas tried to apologize, but Dean was laughing too hard.
“You okay, babe?”
“Would it help if I shared something first?” Cas shook his head.
“Thought this was a romance novel?” Cas shrugged.
“You’re a mess, Bradbury.”
“You did?”
“Don’t start with that. You know it’s Gabe. But you can help me plan it if you want. I’ve got a ton of ideas and no idea where to start.”
By the time Dean clocked out, he was tired, but happy. He was probably one of the only people in the world who liked his job. Living in a small town was like that. Everyone was nice to each other. Or maybe it was just living in Lebanon. Either way, Dean never really had a bad day at work and he was grateful for that. He unlocked his apartment above the cafe. After his dad died, he inherited the house, but once Sam left for college, it all seemed like too much. The house was empty. Nothing there, but ghosts of memories, both good and bad. So he sold it and Ellen offered to rent him the apartment above the cafe at half price. She was good like that.
“You’re impossible, Winchester.”
“I’m not judging, I was just surprised. Can I come in or are we having a baking lesson in the hall?” Dean smirked.
“He will
“Alcohol.” Dean rolled his eyes at Jo.
“Dean’s never on time,” Jo said, startling him.
“Yeah. Dean had a few beers and eight shots of tequila.” Charlie’s eyes widened and an uneasy feeling settled in the pit of Cas’s stomach. “What?”
“What? What happened?”
“How many hands do you think I have?” Dean laughed.
“Agreed. Also nice to put a face to the order. Charlie’s off today and she told me to make sure your coffee and pastry were ready at ten sharp.” Cas could feel the blush creeping up his cheeks.
“Usually everyone brings something for everyone, but you’re new and I didn’t give you very much advance notice, so you don’t have to unless you want to,” Dean had told him before giving him a list of all the people who would be there. He honestly wasn’t expecting anything, but he was curious.
“The man’s attractive as hell and a great actor. If you’re gonna be all judgey, you can leave.”
At least tell me if you’re alive.
“Yeah, just been a long day.”
“I went home, Sammy.”
“All right, I won’t talk to him anymore. I was just trying to be nice.” That wasn’t entirely true. Castiel had caught Dean’s eye immediately. He had been contemplating going over and talking to him when Adam mentioned that he was a Novak. Dean’s first instinct was to tell him to leave, but that wasn’t fair. Anna had been a radical. It wasn’t fair to judge her entire family based on her actions. So he went over to say hi. Castiel was cold and distant, which he had pretty much expected, so he had no reason to ever talk to him again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Next update will be tomorrow!
“Some more coffee and another slice of pie would be awesome,” Dean said. Jody walked away and Castiel looked at Dean. He shrugged. “I ate more of that pie than you did. Figured I should make it even.”
Good! I knew you two would get along! We can talk Monday after class.
“Hello, Dean.” He smiled and Dean found himself smiling back.
Fine be boring. I’ll meet you at the roadhouse in 30
Not at all
“People being nice just for the sake of being nice. Everyone always wants something from me. It’s just gonna take some getting used to.” He didn’t say anything, but Cas couldn’t help noticing that Dean stood a little closer to him as they walked up the street.
“Mystery man?”
“What if I don’t? What if I die while you’re gone?” Cas rolled his eyes.
“Please do. She’s stopped by the garage almost every day for the past week, trying to find you. She’s driving me crazy.”
“Like I said, I had a rough few weeks. We get along. I thought it might be nice to hang out. Clearly I was wrong.”
“You’ve got it so bad.”
“Thoughts?” he asked when he was done.
All right, I’ll pick you up around ten tomorrow morning.
“Yeah, just maybe not at the Roadhouse.”
“It better be. I can’t believe Sam didn’t go home with Eileen.” Meg grinned.
. Shawn Spencer on
“Dean, I could go on a million dates. It wouldn’t make any difference. I’m in love with you. That kinda thing doesn’t just go away. At least, not for me.” Silence fell between them for a moment. Then, “Have you been dating?” Dean shook his head.
“I like danger.”
“Your call. You know the bars better than I do.” Gabriel pulled off and started driving down town.
“Okay, one, you didn’t
“I’ll have to pull the pictures up side by side, but it looks good to me.” Cas let his camera dangle around his neck. “So, we still on for stalking our brothers?”
“Okay.”
“Cas, you’re a hot mess, but I don’t think I’ve seen either of you happier than you’ve been since you met. As long as you have a system that works for you, we’re happy for you.” Dean could see the tension leave Cas’s shoulders. He leaned over and pressed a kiss to his cheek. When Cas smiled his eyes lit up like two tiny sapphires and Dean felt his heart jump a little. He returned the smile, getting lost in the steady rhythm of Cas’s thumb brushing over his knuckles. Suddenly, Gabriel gasped.
“What was that all about?” Benny asked.
“Okay.” They went up to Cas’s apartment. Cas took off his jacket while Gabriel got the first aid kit from under the bathroom sink. Cas stared at the blood still trickling out of his arm. It was running in little rivulets down his arm and over his fingers. Gabriel sat on the couch beside him and started cleaning the wounds. As he wiped the blood away, Cas averted his eyes to avoid looking at the scars on his wrist. Gabriel didn’t say anything about it, but Cas knew his brother was thinking about it.
“Cas, you’re my…well, you’re my only friend, but you’re my best friend. I get that you’re scared. Between Gabe and Balt, you’ve got more than enough reasons to wanna steer clear of relationships. But you’re not your brother or your cousin. You’re kind and generous and, honestly, gorgeous as fuck. Dean would be lucky to have you. And I’ve only met him twice, but Dean seems like a good guy. I don’t think he’d hurt you. At least, not on purpose. I can’t make you do anything, but I hate the idea of you spending your entire life alone just because you’re scared.” Meg took a deep breath, like she hadn’t been planning on saying all that. She probably hadn’t. In the six years Cas had known her, that was the most emotion she had ever put into anything. He had always known she cared about him on some level, but never that much. He swallowed.
“Gabriel left it on and I haven’t bothered to change it,” Cas said without taking his eyes off his laptop.
“Say what?”
“Oh my, God.” Jessica laughed.
He must’ve fallen asleep, because the next time he opened his eyes he was alone on the couch. He lifted his head just enough to look around. He didn’t see Cas anywhere, but he could smell something coming from the kitchen. Keeping the blanket wrapped around him, he got up and followed the smell. Cas was standing at the stove, watching steaks cook.
“Where do we go from here?” Cas asked when they broke apart for air.
“I just like your natural hair better. But it doesn’t matter what I think. And you make a good ginger.”
“I mean, I’ve never done it with anyone, but I’ve tried it myself and it was fine.”
“God, yes.” They headed for the kitchen. Sam was still sitting at his table, pouring over his books. “Lunch, Sam?” Sam looked up.
“That you do.”
“Dean, are you touching yourself?”
“Makes every show different,” Dean said. He knew Kevin found Ash mildly annoying, but they had been friends for as long as Dean could remember and he wasn’t going to cut him just because he had a few bad habits. They all had bad habits. Ash more than the rest of them, but Dean was a very close second.
“You don’t have to come, ya know.” Dean smacked his brother’s hand to keep him from messing with his hair again.
Also I encourage you all to check out Jeff Dunham on Netflix. He’s hilarious.
“Charlie said you wanted to talk to me,” Cas said. He crossed the room, concern masking his face. “Are you okay? You seemed…off today.” Dean smiled weakly.
“Okay. We should set boundaries before we do anything else. Last night and earlier were fun, but I need to know what you’re comfortable with.” Dean seemed to relax a little at the topic change.
“Relax, Dean. We’ll get there. Let me take you apart.” Dean shuddered and Cas smirked. He moved back down Dean’s body, his lips drawing a line of hot, open-mouth kisses down his chest and torso. He knew every single spot that drove Dean crazy, and within a matter of minutes had him whimpering and shaking with need.
Next update will be later today!
“I’m not. You can leave.”
“Oh. That’s…actually a really good idea.” Dean sipped his hot chocolate. “I could help you, if you want.” Cas tilted his head and Dean silently cursed himself for thinking it was cute.
“But…Dean, you put all the work into it. I’m just using it for a my project. If anyone should take it, it’s you.”
“What do you think he’s gonna do?”
“Fine. What’s for lunch?”
“Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean.” Dean groaned and rolled over.
“Come on, dude. Not even a half-hour sitcom?” Cas shook his head. “Hoo, boy. I’m gonna find something we can watch together. Something that’ll actually hold your attention.”
“Don’t sweet talk me, Winchester.” It was Dean’s turn to laugh.
“I…” Cas touched his lip. It hadn’t hurt. Not really. It felt like a pinch. He looked at the blood on his fingers then back at Dean. The vampire’s eyes were getting darker. “Why did you do that?”
“Sorry. I wasn’t paying attention.”
“Maybe it’s a late birthday present.”
“Wow.”
“Why’d you dig out your old Walkman? And how does that thing even still work?”
“Sure.”
“Hi.” Jessica spoke first. She smiled. “Sam talks about you all the time.”
“Dean, I haven’t even
Next update will be Wednesday.
I’ll just hang at your apartment if that’s cool
“Why do you always have an earbud in?”
“You look good in his clothes,” Gabriel whispered. Cas rolled his eyes.
“I know, Cas.” Whatever else Gabriel had planned to say was cut off by Balthazar barging in the door.
“Yes, I do. We do this together, or not at all.” Cas smiled for real this time.
“Hey, Cassie! Who’d you hook up with?” Cas groaned and pushed past his cousin.
“Dean’s brother basically got a perfect score on his LSAT!” Cas smiled.
Dean set his phone down. That fight had been a tipping point. For Dean anyway. It was when he first realized just how much he actually cared about Cas. He knew it was dangerous, but so much of him didn’t care. Cas
“I think you just like having your name on something,” Dorothy said.
Forever. Me and Cas are friends. That’s it.” Charlie nodded.
Cas spent the entire two weeks in his room. Gabriel brought him food and sat with him sometimes, but mostly he just stayed in bed and waited for a call from Dean that would never come. He had never been in love before and now he wasn’t sure he ever wanted to be again. Being with Dean had been intense, but the knowledge that they would never be together again made him feel like he was drowning. He couldn’t breathe. Every inhale was more painful than the last and every exhale made the ache in his chest that much greater.
“Sorry. I’m trying to help.”
“First, thank you for your continued support. Second, it’s not stupid. One of these days this city is gonna be torn apart and I wanna tell the world how it happened.”
“What?” Charlie asked. “What is it? Come on, Dean!” Dean reached into the box and gingerly picked up the record. Charlie audibly gasped.
Well you asked. How’s your day going?
“I was gonna let you decide. It’s your car.” Cas blinked.
“I love you, Dean.” For all the times they had said those words since moving into the bunker, they never once said them in bed and Dean felt something warm blooming in his chest. He moved his lips across Cas’s chest and down his stomach. He nipped and sucked at his hip bones before licking the tip of Cas’s leaking dick. Cas gasped softly. Dean smirked before swallowing the whole thing in one fluid motion, the tip hitting the back of his throat.
“Good because flirting is a reflex when I’m around attractive people.” He took another picture.
“Cas?” Charlie asked and Dean nodded. Benny frowned.
“Gee, thanks.”
“Seemed a little friendlier than “keeping an eye on him”,” Kevin pointed out. Dean rolled his eyes.
“Okay, see ya.”
“What? Cas! Why didn’t you tell me?”
“You’re so dramatic.”
“He’s a good kid.” Dean folded his arms on the table and smiled softly. “I’m glad they decided to stay with us.”
“Want me to stop?”
“Hello, Dean.”
“You, too? Are people not allowed to be friends anymore? Do two people who get along
“For the record, you don’t get first dibs on our pie,” Jo said, setting down a plate.
“Hey, Clarence, bored yet?” Cas smiled.
“Give me the fucking camera.” Cas grinned.
Cas tucked his phone into his pocket just as Gabriel pulled up. He rolled down the window and grinned at Cas.
“I don’t know you well enough,” Charlie replied with a smile. Maggie ran over and started nipping at Dean’s boots.
“He told you he loved you?” Dean swallowed.
“Call another press conference. Tell Dad you wanna make a statement, and set the record straight on what happened.”
“Ten. I’ll probably work a double. See ya.” Dean got back into Baby and sat there for a minute. He still had to go over to his old apartment and get his stuff. He was just bracing himself. He took a deep breath and started the engine. He could do this. He could face Lisa. He took the familiar route from the garage to the apartment. He cut the engine and looked up at the building. He took a deep breath before climbing the stairs. He was about to unlock the door, but something didn’t feel right about it. He knocked. Two minutes and fifteen second later, Lisa opened the door. Dean’s breath caught.
“So you think you’re an angel?” Cas snorted.
“Damn it.” Dean checked the screen. “And I’m being summoned.” He kissed Cas again. “Are you leaving tonight?”
“I understand. Let me just ask you. When you’re ready, will you eventually tell me the whole story?”
“I know. I figure this’ll go away in a few months, so I’m keeping my mouth shut.” That part wasn’t a lie. Cas had every intention of keeping his feelings to himself. He didn’t see the point in telling Dean that he loved him. Dean didn’t feel the same way, and he would be over it soon enough.
He wasn’t expecting a response, so he was surprised when his phone buzzed a minute later.
“I think it’s sweet,” Eileen said. Cas noticed that she and Sam were sitting closer than they normally did. He smiled.
I have the next three days off from work so y'all are in for an onslaught of updates. Hope you all enjoy!
“Deal.” Dean was beyond exhausted, but he still knew how to do his job. He drank three more cups of coffee before Benny showed up.
“It’s done until we go back. That’ll be the epilogue, I guess. What remains after the war is over.”
“I wish I were. All that money for a degree I don’t even really use.”
“You’re an idiot.”
“Yeah, I know, but that kid’s gonna be a great lawyer.” Dean had been a little upset when his little brother told him he wanted to go to college in California, but the truth of the matter was, he was really proud that Sam had gotten into Stanford.
, Dean thought, but he couldn’t bring himself to say it. He didn’t
“Guess I didn’t think about that,” Cas admitted.
“Seriously?”
“Take care of yourself, kid,” Dean said with a fond smile.
“Yeah. Yeah, I’m good.” Dean was quiet, but his eyes said more than his mouth every could. Cas swallowed the words on his tongue. He couldn’t say them no matter how badly he wanted to.
“Just stupid brother stuff. We’ll work it out when we get home. It’s not something I wanna talk about in front of everyone else, and Sam knows that.”
Gabe told me about Oregon
Awesome!
“It’s quite all right, Jack, but she’s right. You shouldn’t talk to strangers.” He held out his hand. “I’m Cas, and this is my boyfriend Dean.”
you want?” Dean leaned forward on the table with a look on his face like he was actually interested. Cas shrugged.
“Well, he probably doesn’t talk about things for a reason, too.” That made sense. Dean was being a hypocrite. “Take your time with him and don’t push him. I’m guessing that’s what started the fight in the first place?”
“It’s no problem.”
“I never thought we’d get here,” Cas admitted. “I wanted to ask you so many times, but I didn’t wanna scare you off. Then you left and I figured that even if you did come back you wouldn’t wanna rush back into things.”
“No, it’s not. We made you uncomfortable.” Cas rolled his eyes.
We’re boarding the plane in about ten minutes. Should be there in a few hours.
“I’m from a little religious town in Illinois. Lived there my whole life and I hated every second of it. I wanted to do something with my life that was more than Church picnics and singing badly in choir and going to town hall meetings with my father. I was supposed to be this perfect, polished little Catholic boy that my parents could be proud of. I didn’t want that. I went to college and got a business degree because I was supposed to, but all I’ve ever really wanted to do is write. So I did. Under a pen name so my parents wouldn’t find out. Anyway, long story short, I was up one night, trying to get some work done, ignoring harassing emails from my publisher, and I suddenly realized, this is stupid. I’m an adult. I can do things for myself. So, I broke my contract with the publisher, packed a bag, and got on a bus. I ended up here.” Dean was quiet for a minute, probably trying to process everything, before he said,
“I guess.” Dean grinned.
“I think I said something similar to you once, didn’t I?” Dean nodded. “Okay, and look where we are now. Like you said, it’s just gonna take some time. Are you done out here? Because I could use some lunch.”
“Hit me with your best shot, Talbot.” Bela stood up and Charlie grabbed her arm.
“Dean,” Balthazar said simply. “Cassie, if you love him that much, go back. We love having you here, but if you’re miserable, there really isn’t a point.”
“Better. You help.”
“Have you told him?”
He took it out and looked at the screen.
“You.” Max gestured at him. He glanced down. He was wearing Cas’s jeans and his shirt was inside out. He grinned.
“Yes, it is. You’re trying to do everything for everyone else and it’s taking its toll. You can’t keep doing that to yourself.”
“Why not? I like you guys…sometimes.” Balthazar crossed his arms over his bare chest.
“Okay. How about this? You try to get some sleep. I’ll go back to my apartment and talk with Gabriel and Balthazar, and then I’ll come back and we can go out to dinner like we were going to. Only it’ll be a real date this time. We can go somewhere nice.” Dean considered that. It sounded nice. After the day he’d had, he really did just want to sleep.
“Um…buying a record. Maybe. It’s hard to find ones I don’t already have.”
“Yes, please.” Dean settled into the couch while Charlie popped the DVD in.
“How is any of this relevant? Can we just play the game?”
“I did, too. And it seems like Gabe and Sam hit it off.”
“You say that like it’s a bad thing,” Dean grinned.
“I can hear you thinking at me.”
“Oh, all right.” They settled in to watch. They were half way through the first movie when Dean took out his phone.
“Thanks.” They stepped a safe distance from his friends. “Drink?”
“Hey, Cas.” His students were the first people Dean had been ready to forgive. Sam and Adam were next. He was still working on getting there with his friends, but Castiel knew he’d get there eventually.
“You miss whoever it was that had you all giddy,” Gabriel finished. Cas shrugged. “Come on, Cassie, just tell me who he is.”
“Lisa. It’s nice to meet you.” Cas tensed. He kept his expression neutral, but he could feel anger bubbling in his chest.
“Just a suggestion. Maybe if you ever actually do move out to Cali.”
“Hardly. More like using each other. He doesn’t want this war and neither do I. If there’s a chance we can stop it, I’m gonna take it.”
“Cas feels the same way,” Sam had said with a small, encouraging smile. After a long ten minutes of teasing, of course. Dean took another calming breath before entering the library. It was Cas’ favorite place to go when they were sort of waiting around for some action. As predicted, the blue-eyed angel was sitting at one of the tables with his nose buried in a lore book. It looked more ancient than any Dean had ever seen and, for a brief moment, he wondered what Cas was researching. Then he remembered he was there for a reason. He cleared his throat.
He had been expecting Cas to be gone by the time he got up. When he wasn’t, it only seemed right to give him some breakfast and drive him home. Sam had given him hell about it when he got back to the apartment, but Dean had held firm on his stance that they were just friends, because they were. It wasn’t like Dean hadn’t fallen asleep watching movies with his friends before. Sam was reading too much into it.
“He didn’t though. We thought she was dead. That wasn’t on him.”
“I don’t like garnish.” The man’s voice was gravel-rough and damn near made for sex, but the words being spoken with it grated against Dean’s ears.
Love you guys! 💕💕 Your comments always make me smile!
Whether Dean actually believed that or not, it was enough to get him to finally knock. He waited a full two minutes before he knocked again. When he was met with silence for a second time he sighed.
“I know, but just the whole star-crossed lovers thing. It’s good you guys got out though. If you hadn’t, we never would’ve met you and we’d still be on the street. My dad used to say everything happens for a reason. Guess he was right.” Cas smiled at Dean.
“Yes, you are.” Cas combed his fingers through Dean’s hair. Dean closed his eyes and hummed quietly. Cas waited until he was sure Dean was in his own little world before he bent his head and kissed his nose. Dean squirmed a little.
“Which one?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Perfect.” Cas tucked his phone into his pocket. It had been a few weeks since the last time he had seen his cousin, and the last time hadn’t gone so well. That was mostly Gabriel’s fault, but Cas was trying to forget about it. He had too much else to worry about. He sat on his usual bench and watched Maggie while he waited. Then he felt his phone vibrate.
“I’ll think about it,” Dean said to get his brother to stop talking. He wasn’t going to buy the jacket. It was cool, but he was fairly certain he wouldn’t be able to pull it off.
“Great. You can eat rabbit food the other six days of the week, but when you’re hanging out with me, you’re eating people food.” Cas just laughed and shook his head. Dean smiled. He had been worried that things would be weird between them after Cas spent the night at his apartment, but everything was fine. If anything they were better. Dean had felt a little guilty about falling asleep and he had thought about waking Cas up, but he couldn’t bring himself to. So instead, he just got up carefully, put a pillow under Cas’s head, covered him with a blanket, and went to bed.
“Everything all right, Dean?”
“Nothing all that interesting,” Gabriel said.
“To be fair, we’ve only seen each other twice,” Dean pointed out. He had been under the impression that whatever this was between them was purely physical.
“Find anything you like?” he asked, sitting at the opposite end of the couch.
“Buddy…” Dean could feel himself blushing again. “Just don’t talk about that with anyone else, okay?” Cas paused a little too long.
“Banged my leg into my bed last night getting in. Shit happens, I’ll live.”
“And that’s the last time you spoke to him?”
. So let’s eat and drink and watch movies and we can talk about this more tomorrow, okay?” Cas smiled.
Just got off work. Wanna get drinks?
“‘For lack of a better word’. Thanks, I’ll keep that in mind next time your birthday rolls around.” Dean grinned. “Things are only weird if we make them weird. As long as you don’t hurt Sammy, we’ll be fine.”
“I think Cas would disagree, but,” Gabriel shrugged. “I’m actually glad your here. I wanted to ask you something. Sam, is he…I mean, is he single?” Dean smirked.
“Do you think I’ll get the contract?”
Dean didn’t order another drink. They sat in comfortable silence while Cas nursed his bourbon. He was surprised, but grateful that Gabriel hadn’t followed him. His brother must have realized he needed some space. On the bar, Dean’s phone vibrated. He picked it up.
“Thanks, Cas.”
“Chili cheese fries, and two blue Hawaiians. Thanks, sweetheart.” The waitress blushed a little before walking away.
“Yes, Dean, we’re good.”
“I don’t care about people. My art is for me. Unless I’m doing commissions, it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks. I like drawing you.”
“All right. Tiger head in two minutes. Go!”
him. Dean’s stomach clenched with anxiety. He closed his eyes and started humming Metallica under his breath. Then he felt a warm hand over his.
Cool if I come over?
“Yeah, I’d hate him, too. You gonna come in or do I have to invite you?” “I’m not a vampire,” Cas said. He stepped inside and Dean shut the door.
“You need to try harder.”
Three weeks later, he left the apartment and didn’t look back.
“Thank you.”
“No. I thought I would, eventually, but these last three months made me realize that I don’t like my life without you in it.”
“Cas.”
“Because we love each other,” Cas replied, “but we love winning more.”
“Good, actually.”
“No, but it doesn’t really matter. I talked to him for two seconds yesterday and Dad about had an aneurysm. He also wasn’t very nice, so whatever his reason is for staring, I promise it isn’t because he likes me.” Charlie rolled her eyes.
“Good. Come on.” They walked outside together and lit cigarettes. “Wanna walk today?”
“Bailed,” was all he said as he fell onto the couch. Charlie gave him a sympathetic smile. She sat next to him and ran her fingers soothingly through his hair.
“For the millionth time, Dean and I are friends. Leave it alone. What are you, Anna, and Balt up to?”
“You know what, whatever.” Dean took his keys out of his pocket. “Here’s your key back. Maybe I’ll call you.” He got out of the car, leaving Cas cursing himself for opening his mouth
Dean unlocked the door to Charlie’s apartment. Everyone seemed to trust him with there spare keys, so he had about a dozen keys on his key ring, and none of them belonged to him.
“Are you okay? You’re pale and spacey. Are you having a panic attack?” Cas smiled a little.
“I’m sure we could find
You at work?
“We can fix this.” He heard Cas laugh, but there was no humor behind it. It was hollow.
“Oh. All right. What about you, Winchester?”
“Can’t you just…text him?” Dean stopped pacing again long enough to give his brother a look.
“Apparently, I have a job now.” Dean grinned.
“Dean Winchester.”
“Very good, Jack. You’ve made a lot of progress in the last few months. I’m proud of you.”
“Definitely. Have a good night.” Cas leaned across the bench seat and pressed his lips against Dean’s in a soft good night kiss. Dean waited until Cas was safely inside before he drove to his own apartment. He knew he couldn’t go home. His father was going to be furious with him for leaving and he didn’t feel like dealing with it at the moment. Morning Dean could deal with that. Right now, his only thoughts were drinking and sleeping. Precisely in that order.
“Point.” Castiel crushed his cigarette under his shoe. “Come on. Jody’s waiting for us.”
“We should probably just go. It’s almost midnight. She’ll be even more pissed if we’re late.” Dean turned to Cas and Gabriel. “Thanks for the drinks, guys. Cas, thanks for the smoke. After using that vape so much, I forgot how good it feels.”
“I’m gonna get us a round,” Gabriel said suddenly and when Cas looked over at the bar, he saw Dean talking with his brothers. Gabriel had his eyes locked on Sam like a laser.
“How the fuck should I know!?” Gabriel locked the door. “I got to the paper before Mom and Dad could see it, but this is all over the internet.” Cas dropped his eyes back to the paper and the picture. The alley near the restaurant in California.
“You really do look like shit. When’s the last time you slept?” Dean slammed his fist against the table.
“I hate you so much right now.” Cas laughed again. “Seriously. I might actually kill you the next time I see you.”
“It’s okay, Cas.” Cas smiled when Dean let him go.
“Hey, sweetheart.”
“Cool.”
I’ll be there.
“Sorry. You know I hate this.”
“Practice.” Cas set a fast pace, effectively shutting Dean up until he said,
to go to California. I always have, ever since you left. It’s where I need to be, especially with my career. I can’t give that up just for Dean. No matter how much I love him.”
“Why are you walking weird?”
“You’re not mad?”
“Well?” Claire snapped.
“It’s fine, Cas. I’m used to people hitting on me.” He regretted it as soon as he said it, but he couldn’t take it back. Cas’s smile faltered a little.
“You haven’t even had lunch yet and you’re already thinking about dinner?”
“Shut up.”
“I’d accuse you of cheating, but I can’t figure out how,” Gabriel said. Dean grinned.
“I have a better game,” Cas said. He picked up the pack of cards he and Dean had been using to play poker and sat across from Jack. “It’s called Smoke and Fire. Every time you see a black card you say smoke and every time you see a red card you say fire. Ready?” Jack nodded. Cas shuffled the cards a few times then held up the deck.
“Something with cute people.”
Castiel didn’t get any sleep that night. He laid in bed, staring at the ceiling, thinking about Dean. They couldn’t be anything more than friends. There were too many variables and if they broke up things would be weird for everyone. Castiel couldn’t do that to his other friends. He wondered, though. The physical attraction had always been there and he couldn’t help wondering what it would be like to be with Dean. Just once. He couldn’t go down that road, though. There was always a price to pay for just sex and he wasn’t willing to pay it. Not with Dean.
They kissed until Cas lost track of time. Nothing existed outside of them. The way Dean kissed made Cas feel like he was floating and falling at the same time. It was slow and heated and Cas felt dizzy. Dean’s hands were everywhere, but he was taking care not to mess up Cas’s suit or his hair even though Cas could tell he wanted to. Cas didn’t particularly care about either of those things, but he had an image he had to maintain for Chuck and Dean was respecting that. Something warm bloomed in Cas’s chest. Dean’s phone went off, breaking the moment.
“Yes, they are. Hey, so where’d Dean run off to just after midnight last night?”
“Welcome,” Dean muttered. Cas walked him home. They stopped outside the door and Dean fumbled with his keys.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me for this. I promise it gets better. Eventually.
“Dean, we just—.”
“I don’t like knock-knock jokes.”
“It’s barely noon and you weren’t exactly gentle last night, so shut up.”
“Why is everyone yelling at me?”
“Of course we did!” Dean hugged his best friend tightly. “I’m proud of you.”
“No calling your ex.”
“Alcohol. Lots of alcohol. That’s about it,” Dean had lied. Well, half-lied. True to his word, when he’d first woken up he couldn’t remember anything beyond bottles of liquor. Then Sam had given him some magic hangover pills and everything had come flooding back with starling clarity. The drinks Cas had poured him. The drunken rambling. The sidewalk confession that he wasn’t good enough or strong enough. The unexpected make out session that ended with Dean falling asleep on Cas’s shoulder like it was the most natural thing in the world.
“CAN EVERYONE PLEASE LEAVE!?” Sam shouted. Dean stood up and took Cas’s hand, leading him out of the room.
“I get the feeling I’m not welcome around you guys, despite Balthazar’s staring problem.”
“Right. Well, I love Dean more than I ever loved Meg, so you can’t expect me to just get over this.”
“Fine.” He knew that was the best he was going to get and, really, he didn’t care. He just wanted to spend time with Cas. And he got the feeling that Sam wanted to spend more time with Gabriel. He was a little uneasy about that. He didn’t think Gabriel was a bad person, but he was twenty-five and Sam was seventeen. It was an age gap that made Dean uncomfortable, even for friends. But he wasn’t going to tell Sam who he was allowed to socialize with. He would just have to keep an eye on him. Dean got up and went into the adjoining room. Sam was sitting on one of the beds, flipping through an SAT prep book.
“I’m an artist!”
“I do now. Good to know.” Dean slipped off his barstool. “Text me when you have something.” He started to walk away, clearly pissed. Cas caught his arm.
“Dean, what is all this?”
“You’re not wrong, but I still feel bad.”
“You’d break ‘em because I know you’d never pass up the chance to kick ass at Trivial Pursuit.”
“I know enough. He’ll tell me everything when he’s ready. I can wait.”
“Me, of course.” Dean just shook his head with a fond smile. They stared at each other and Dean could feel himself getting lost in the endless sea of blue.
“Maybe so, but how do you talk to him? Someone who looks like that, I’d be stuttering the whole time.”
“And I officially hate you. Give me your plate. You don’t get breakfast.”
“So why are you awake?”
“Ash, a round of shots. Surprise us.” Balthazar grinned.
The word “boyfriend” snapped Dean back to reality. He grinned at Cas before extending his hand to the girl.
I made it there in one piece. I’ll be home at 8.
“I’ve never seen the appeal of being drunk,” Cas said. “And you should slow down.”
have to hide it. No one could know about what they were doing or they would both end up dead. He reached up and cupped Cas’s face, pulling him in for a gentler kiss.
“Not interested,” Dean said. Whatever it was, it probably wasn’t important. Sam had been trying to get Dean out of his room for two weeks. He had been holed up in his room since the Novaks gave their press conference. He didn’t want to deal with the world. Sam took the ice cream from him and dragged him out of bed.
“Why do you assume I don’t wanna be here?” Cas shrugged.
“I…um…here.” Dean gestured to the picnic table.
“Still not into you.”
“You want breakfast?”
The rest of the drive was filled with small talk and Dean blasting his favorite Zeppelin cassette. There were designated hunting grounds near the edge of the city as a part of the Treaty. It was safer for everyone and, in all honesty, it made the job a little easier. Dean parked Baby near the edge of the woods and cut the engine.
“You’re very nice to offer, Dean, but it’s completely out of your way considering you live upstairs.”
“Bela, you’re a genius when it comes to…everything else, but when it comes to trivia you’re completely useless,” Benny said. Bela flipped him off.
“You know, I think we were in the middle of something before Sam interrupted.”
“Really?”
I had fun too 🙂 Whenever you want. You’re not so bad I guess
“Don’t do that. This is what I’m talking about. You’re in that self-deprecating spiral and it’s only gonna get worse if you don’t let us help you.”
“Why couldn’t I be Jack Harkness?”
“Yes, I know,” Cas said with a forced smile. That was exactly why he was worried. People like Dean were few and far between and he didn’t want to break his heart any more than it had already been broken. He sighed and got to work.
“Dean’s single.” Cas chuckled.
“I mean, sure, I could use the company, but…won’t you get in trouble?”
“I know you did. I didn’t get it then. I didn’t get why you wanted to leave. I love this town and the people. I can’t imagine ever being anywhere else. I get why you wanted to leave now. And I get why you fought so hard for me to come with you. But I’m okay here.”
“I’m sure you have.”
“You two are idiots,” Gilda said with a fond smile.
“I’m guessing you’re off the campaign trail,” Dean said to break the silence. Cas snorted.
“Oh. Okay.” Dean watched a tear trace down his cheek. His heart lurched in his chest.
Sorry for the late update! Sometimes I think my job is trying to kill me. Enjoy!
“Not me little bro. Not me,” Gabriel said.
“I’m sorry.”
“Please don’t.”
“Hey, you showed up!”
“Yeah, yeah. I believe you owe me some money. You’re the only one I didn’t collect from at the bar. You ducked out before I could get to you.” Dean smirked. “You were hoping I’d stay at Sam’s tonight, weren’t you?” Charlie shrugged sheepishly.
“Both of you can fuck right off.” Gabriel and Balthazar laughed.
Good. I’m busy tonight but are you free tomorrow?
“Honest opinion? I think you shouldn’t put so much emphasis on the plot. Focus on your characters. Won’t the plot holes just fix themselves eventually?” Cas shook his head.
“Castiel Novak.” Gabriel whistled obnoxiously loud. Dean made eye contact with Cas and smiled. They hadn’t spoken since their fight…break up…whatever it was, but he wanted Cas to know that he wasn’t mad, because he wasn’t. Cas smiled back. Dean lost count of how many names came before Sam’s.
“Well, I’m sure Sam would prefer it if I let him come back at some point so he’s not freezing to death outside, but yes, we have as long as we want.”
“Not a fan of small, flying paper?” Cas asked from where he was leaning against the door.
“I do.” Dean suddenly turned serious. “Cas, over the last six months, I kept waiting for you to wake up one day and walk out on me. I was trying to convince myself that I didn’t really love you that much. But I do. I didn’t mean for it happen, but I am
“Hey, angel.” Cas tipped his head back and smiled.
“Keep talking and you’ll find out,” Sam threatened.
“Oh, yeah, sure. I’ll just walk up to him and say “Hi, I know we barely know each other, and I don’t even know your name, but I think I’m in love with you. Wanna get dinner some time?” That’ll go over real well.” Dean shook his head. “He’s out of my league anyway.” Charlie smacked him.
“Dean, are you all right?”
“Relax, Gabe. Whatever Meg thinks she saw, she didn’t. We’re friends.”
“We’ll figure it out.”
“I’ve always been interested in art,” Cas answered. “Ever since I was little. Gabriel was the only one who ever supported me. He’s the whole reason I’m even here. We both wanted to get out. Gabriel had a ton of opportunities, but he waited until I turned eighteen, then encouraged me to apply to every single college with an art program. I never thought Stanford would except me, but as soon as I got the letter, Gabe packed us up and moved us out here. He risked his life to save mine. I can never thank him enough for that.” Cas took a drink from the beer Dean had gotten for him. He wasn’t usually so open with people about his home life, but he trusted Dean.
“We’ve missed you,” Pamela said, “but you need to go back to your brother. You need to talk to Cas.”
“So what made you decide to go into art?” Dean asked.
“Oh, hell yeah. And I’m gonna kick your ass today.”
“No idea, but it won’t be good. I’m scared, Gabe.” Gabriel put his hand on Cas’s shoulder.
“Doesn’t feel like it.” Cas moved away from him a little.
“You’re both children.” He pushed some of the fries onto Dean’s plate then passed the plate back to Castiel. “There. Both of you quit it.” Castiel didn’t miss the look exchanged between Dean and Sam. Apparently neither did Charlie because she said,
“You love me.”
“Great! Any chance you can start tomorrow?”
Cas left after two hours, even though Gabriel begged him to stay. He ended up back at his apartment in a pair of sweatpants and an old t-shirt. He turned on the TV and found a documentary that looked mildly interesting. He needed to focus on anything other than Dean. His phone buzzed on the arm of the couch.
“You’re the only one I trust with this. You get me. As for Dorothy, she’s busy at work. She’ll be here soon, hopefully.”
“I think they’d like you. Show’s at seven. And I’m counting on you to get Sam there. Drag him kicking and screaming if you have to.” Adam laughed.
“Why? It’s not like-.” Cas bit his tongue to keep himself from saying something he shouldn’t.
“I’m gonna stop you right there, Winchester. Jack and Claire are gonna be back any minute. We don’t have time and I thought you had to finish what you were doing?” Dean sighed. He knew it was a long-shot, but he was getting desperate. He and Cas hadn’t had sex in almost a month. Not since the morning Cas let him top. As much as Dean liked having Jack and Claire with them, he missed when it was just him and Cas.
“Good. Maybe I’ll join you this time.” Cas smirked before pushing Dean onto the bed.
“I missed you.”
“Keep talking and I’ll come over there and kick your ass.”
“Much. Thanks. I needed today.”
“I know,” Charlie said brightly. “Sam called it right, though. He said New Years.”
“I know, you’re off the hard stuff. I’m proud of you for that, by the way.” Dean half smiled.
“‘Night, Sammy.” Dean walked the six blocks back to Charlie’s in record time. He unlocked the door, and walked in on Charlie and Gilda making out once again. “Jesus Christ. I can’t catch a break today.”
“You know I don’t do Halloween anymore, Meg.”
“I kinda wanted it to be a surprise.” Cas nodded.
“Yeah, she’s just about the best thing about me.” Dean started the engine and ran his hand along the dashboard before driving to the bar. Gabriel and Balthazar were sitting at a table near the back. Dean sat next to Gabriel and Castiel slid in beside Balthazar.
“Um, Dean, can you help me?” Dean broke eye contact to look at the girl who had come over. He smiled.
“Sure, what the hell.” Gabriel pulled Dean across the room. Sam looked at Cas.
“You ducked out of work early because you missed me.” Dean paused the game to look up at his husband.
“Shut up.” Dean responded by kissing him and messing up his hair even more.
“No, but the burgers here are amazing.” Dean smiled. “So, you’re not the commitment type?” Cas shook his head. “Have you ever loved someone?”
They were at war. It wouldn’t be long before Dean was given the order to kill him and, as much as he wanted to believe that Dean would never hurt him, he knew better. Dean Winchester was a lot of things, but disobedient wasn’t one of them. Sure, he had been spending more time than necessary with Cas, but he would never disobey a direct order from his father. There was no doubt in Cas’s mind about that and it made him sick. He was contemplating raiding his medicine drawer when the buzzer went off. Frowning, he got up and went over to the intercom.
“Well, I’ll have to make it up to her. But you first. Impala?”
“Not unannounced. I’m…with someone.” Sam’s eye widened.
“How very noble of you.” Dean shrugged.
“I don’t know. I want to, but I know I really can’t.” Dean looked up at the computer monitors to avoid looking at his brother. “Can we drop this, please?”
“Come on. Real talk, what’s up with you and Dean? I mean, I never thought you’d part with that album for anything in the world.”
Sorry for the unusually late update. I had to work all day. Hope you all enjoy!
have an announcement.” Dean put his hand on the table. Cas immediately covered it with him own.
“We’re slow now, so I’m gonna have you fill out the paperwork and then you can shadow Dorothy until her shift ends.” Cas nodded and followed Jo into the office. He filled out the forms and signed where he needed to, then followed Jo back out front. Charlie was leaning against the counter, talking quietly to Dorothy. “Dorothy, Cas is gonna shadow you for the rest of your shift.
“Sad isn’t a good look on you,” Cas said, pulling Dean out of his head. Dean smiled a little.
“For the last few weeks I’ve…kinda been thinking about…maybe asking Sam to marry me,” Dean broke into a grin immediately, but Gabriel didn’t give him a chance to say anything, “and I was wondering if I could do it at your wedding. During the reception.” Dean caught Cas’s eye. He didn’t really care, he was just happy for them, but he knew how important every single detail of this wedding was to Cas. Cas chewed his bottom lip.
“Wonderfully. You?”
“Bite me, Novak.”
friends. Dean probably didn’t want him bothering him, even if he was only trying to help. “I’m sorry.” Cas moved to get up and Dean’s hand gripped his arm. A dizzying warmth spread through him at the contact. Or maybe it was the alcohol. Either way, he stayed where he was.
He sat on his bed and opened his laptop. A blank document stared back at him. He sipped his coffee and decided he would probably have better luck making an outline first. As he worked, his mind wandered to Dean. Now that he had a face to go with the name, he understood why Charlie liked him so much. They had only spoken for a few minutes, but Cas could tell he was a good person. He had been around enough fake nice people over the years to know the genuine thing when he saw it. He hoped he would see Dean more in the future. His phone pinged in his pocket.
“Sure.” Cas didn’t really like car rides, but he liked the smile on Dean’s face. And maybe he could get a few good pictures out of it. Dean started the engine and turned his music up. Cas settled into his seat and stared out the window. There was something to be said about living near the ocean. It was beautiful. Cas took a few shots of the scenery before he turned to look at Dean. He was tapping his fingers against the steering wheel in time to the beat of the Metallica song that was playing. It wasn’t one of Cas’s favorites, so he reached over to skip to the next song. Dean slapped his hand.
“Pot calling kettle black,” Cas said. “All I’m saying is, he doesn’t have a reputation for nothing.”
“I won’t. That I can promise.” Gabriel smiled. “What’s up with you and Cas?” Dean shrugged. In truth, he wasn’t quite sure what he was feeling. He liked Cas, he knew that much, but he was beginning to straddle the line between ‘I wanna be friends’ like, and ‘I wanna fuck you against a wall’ like.
“That was rude, Dean.”
“Yeah. He wants to be a lawyer. When he got accepted, me, him, and our uncle moved out here. Bobby opened the garage, and I’ve been working there to help Sam pay for school.”
“I like the new guy,” Benny said as Dean started gathering supplies.
“Dean, why can’t you handle things like a rational human being?”
Dean smiled to himself. It had become a habit. Whenever Cas’s roommates were being especially annoying, he would come over. He spent the night more often than not, which resulted in plenty of
“Cas…”
“Yes. Just not anywhere visible.”
“Ah, you love me.”
“Language,” Dean chided.
“I like you, too, Dean. And it took you long to ask me out.”
“I’m off today and Adam’s spending the day with Mom apparently, so I actually have nothing to do for once.”
“You wanna stay here, deal with it,” Charlie laughed.
“Nope.”
“Are you alone?” Dean felt compelled to ask.
“I did.”
“Slow,” Dean whispered against his lips. “We have all night.”
“Pillow barrier?”
“Happy birthday, Dean.”
“Go out with me,” Dean said when he broke the kiss. Castiel stared at him, too shocked to say anything. “Shit. That didn’t come out right. Will you go out with me? You don’t have to say yes. And please know that your answer won’t have any bearing on your contract. I promise. And if you say no, we can still be friends. I just really like you and I’d really like to go out with you and I—.”
“Like that’s not the only reason you actually approve these trips,” Dean snapped. “You can sit here the whole time if you want, but I’m not budging on this. I’m going to treat them with respect until they give me a reason not to.” Pamela sighed.
“I’ll be there in two weeks.” Dean sighed.
“Safe-houses. All of them. Nowhere to hide if the enemy knows all your spots.”
problem with that.”
“Okay.”
Lunch was filled with jokes and small talk, but Cas wasn’t really paying attention. He spent most of the time finding every way possible to avoid looking at Dean without being obvious about it. Gabriel nudged him a few times, but no one said anything. After lunch, Gabriel said,
“It’s not the thunder. It’s the lightning. I can’t see it, but I know it’s there and…When I was an angel, almost nothing could hurt me. Now, almost everything can hurt me. That scares me.” Dean nodded. He could understand that.
“More, Dean,” Cas begged, moving his hips. Dean chuckled and took his mouth back. Cas whined at the loss of contact. Dean sat up and pulled a bottle of lube out of the nightstand drawer. He coated his hand then pressed his finger against Cas’s hole. He teased him a little longer before giving in to his own desire. He worked his first finger in slowly. When he got it up to the webbing, he pulled it out and pushed it back in, slowly stretching him out.
“Cas, that’s in
“That’s my gag gift for Gabe. Ever since we were able to buy our own stuff we’ve had this contest to see who could give the craziest present. I’ve won every single year so far.”
All right y'all. I totally meant to update this earlier, but for someone who's on vacation from work, I have had a very long day. Anyway, enjoy!
“I have no doubt. Are you gonna bring Lisa?” Dean frowned.
“That’s good, I think.”
“Good. Come on. It’s still cold out here and I want more of Charlie’s shots if there’re any left.”
“Be careful.”
“Found it,” Dean teased. Cas couldn’t find the words to retort and even if he could, he wasn’t sure they would make it past his lips. “Ready?” Cas nodded fiercely, leaving no room for doubt. Dean’s weight settled over him again. Dean’s lips covered his and he slowly sank in. Every sound that escaped Cas’s throat was lost in Dean’s mouth.
“You don’t seem like the type.” Dean crossed his arms.
“What?”
“Are you sure you’re okay?”
“I thought we could stand to get to know each other a little better. Dean seems to like you a lot.” Cas felt heat flash up the back of his neck. He cleared his throat.
Dean shook his head as he started up Baby and waited for Adam. Sam was supposed to be doing something with his life that wasn’t…this. He had never really wanted to play a role in the family business. Sam wanted to save the world. Somewhere around 1970 he had wanted to be a lawyer. He had even talked about applying to Stanford just to see if he could get in. Dean didn’t know what ever came of that, but he decided he should ask the next time he was in a clear enough head space to have a real conversation.
“Up to you. I have some ideas I need to bounce off you.” Dean grinned.
“Stop thanking me and stop apologizing. You know I like spending time with you.” That was a lie, but Cas didn’t call him on it. No one
Dean didn’t realize he was crying until a tear dripped onto the paper. He sniffed and wiped his eyes. Cas loved him. Or he had at one point anyway. Those feelings had probably long since been replaced with anger and resentment. He left the mixtape on the desk and went into his own room. Still clutching the note, he dug around in his nightstand for one of his many spare phones. He finally came up with one that wasn’t dead and dialed Cas’ number.
“Yeah, what’s up?”
“I get it. Hopefully it’ll stop raining soon.”
“Excuse me, is this seat taken?” Dean looked up at the man standing next to him. His dark hair was a disaster, and it didn’t match the vibe his suit and tie was giving off at all.
“Dean—.”
Cas opened the door and slipped out into the hallway before he could lose his nerve. He took the key Dean had given him out of his pocket. He stared at it for a minute before he locked the door and slid the key underneath it. No going back now. He touched the bus ticket in his pocket. A solid reminder that he was doing the right thing, just maybe not the right way. He went downstairs and walked to the bus station. He waited until the bus had pulled out of the station and Lebanon was miles behind him before he rested his head against the window and let himself cry.
“Good. And, hey, keep in touch, okay?”
“You’re gonna wear a hole in the floor,” Charlie said after half an hour.
“It’s easier that way, Balthazar. Trust me.”
“I’ve been thinking. What if we make this a weekly thing?” Meg shrugged.
“No reason. We just don’t hang out enough, one on one. You’ve been here for two months and I hardly know you. Dean said you’re a writer?”
“You didn’t do anything. I just…” Dean reached across the table and Cas pulled back.
“It means dear. It’s French.”
“Ya know, I had a rough day, too, but you don’t see me taking it out on you,” Cas snapped. Dean barked a laugh.
“I know, I know. I just miss you, Sammy.”
love. He kept people at a distance for a reason and he didn’t like how quickly Dean was becoming the best part of his day. He had adjusted his entire schedule just to see him. He had started waking up before nine just to see him. Dean was slowly ruining his life and there was absolutely nothing Cas could do to stop it. He swiped his way into his building and took the elevator up to the sixth floor.
“Nope.” He downed his whiskey and flagged Benny down for another.
, but I was nineteen and I wanted to get laid.” Dean laughed.
“Why do you have to be such a little brother about this? I’ll introduce you when I’m ready and I’m just not yet. Why is that such a problem?”
“Nothing. We were talking and he fell asleep. I didn’t wanna wake him because he looked like he needed it.” Sam nodded.
He was sketching something he thought Dean might like when Maggie trotted over and
Point.” Dean’s eyes flitted to the door. Charlie smirked.
“Did you start drinking again?” Cassie asked.
“No, Dean. I’m hardly a virgin. I had fun.”
“I’m gonna say something that you’re not gonna like--.”
“You got everything?” Sam leveled Dean with Bitchface #27.
“I want this. You’re the best lay I’ve had in a while. I just think that...I don’t want either of us thinking this is more than it is, ya know?”
“Good night, Dean.” Dean waited until Cas got in a cab then went upstairs. He was buzzing with whiskey and adrenaline. He wanted to kiss Cas. Even if their friendship didn’t go anywhere, he wanted to kiss him, just once. Dean stretched out in his bed and tried to think of anything else as he drifted off to sleep.
“That a promise, Cas?” He leaned through the window and took the money. “I’ll get you a cup of coffee when we get to the shop. Bobby’s coffee is unmatched.” Cas smiled a little before Dean disappeared.
“Makes sense. I respect Bobby more than I ever respected my dad. You respect the people who earn it.” Cas smiled.
“Cool. Let me get her rinsed off.” Dean turned the water back on and hosed down Baby. He dumped the bucket in the grass and left it upside down beside the hose. He fished his keys out of his pocket. “Come on.” Cas looked surprised, but he didn’t argue as he got in the passenger’s seat. Dean turned the key in the ignition. “I hope you like classic rock because that’s all I listen to.”
“Sorry. I didn’t mean to fall asleep.” Dean grinned.
“Does that mean I’m getting dental?” Cas rolled his eyes so hard he was worried for a moment that they might get stuck. He was laughing, though, because he couldn’t help it.
“Hey, Deano. Listen, Cassie’s right. Sam’s not a kid anymore. I know you want him to be. I still hate that Cassie doesn’t need me anymore. Sam’s growing up and the more you try to help him, the more he’s gonna push you away. I can try to talk to him for you if you want, but the best thing you can do is let him make his own decisions. He has to make mistakes to learn from them.”
“Well, then, what do you wanna do? This is the only safe place I know. Unless we go to my apartment, but that seems…”
“I’m sure Sammy says the same thing about me.”
“I’m flattered, but I think I’m gonna have to pass.”
I'm sorry to all people whose comments I haven't responded to yet. I've been going through a lot lately and most of my energy has been spent trying not to fall into a depressive episode. Your comments always make me smile and I will respond as soon as I'm in a better place. Love you guys!! 💕💕
“Your baking suggests otherwise.” Dean shrugged, picking one up and peeling back the wrapper.
“No.”
“Cassie, you know as well as I do that Dad doesn’t trust me with any of the important stuff. He leaves that to you.” Cas rolled his eyes.
“I am. Cas, I’m so mad at you. I can’t even…you don’t know what that did to me. But I know it wasn’t easy for you to do what you did today and I appreciate it.”
“All right, me and Sam against you guys.”
“Just leave the cork off. It’ll be ready by the time you finish cooking. Did you have this planned? Is that why Sam isn’t here?” Dean shrugged, but his expression was sheepish.
“Because if me and Cas were on the same team then we couldn’t destroy each other,” Dean said with a smile.
“The milkshakes after study group. Asking me to play a board game. It’s like you’re trying to…” Sam stopped. Dean pulled into the driveway and cut the engine.
“I’m so sorry, Dean. If I had known—.” Dean held up his hand.
“You’re welcome.” Cas sat at his usual table. He sipped his coffee then opened his laptop. He had six new emails from work and one in his advice box. He opened the one in his advice box first. He could deal with work later. He read the ask twice then opened a blank document. When he first went to his editor with the idea for an advice column, he had been aiming for general advice, but over the last year, it had become almost exclusively for relationship advice. He didn’t mind, but he also didn’t think he was in a position to be giving relationship advice. His phone vibrated in his pocket. He opened up the messaging app on his laptop.
“I’ve given up, Gabe.”
“I guess not.” Dean finished off his champagne. He glanced over to where he had last seen Cas. He was gone. Dean scanned the room. He caught a glimpse of raven hair headed in the direction of the bathroom. “I gotta pee.” He handed off his empty glass to his brother and walked to the bathroom. He smelled Cas before he even walked in and he smiled. He pushed open the door. Cas was standing at the sink splashing water on his face.
“Okay. You’re right. We could use a fourth and they both like you.” Meg grinned.
“Don’t. You. Dare. Novak.” Cas grinned and picked up Dean’s fork. “I will kill you. You think I’m kidding.” Cas rolled his eyes and scooped up some pie with the fork. He held it out and Dean smiled. He leaned forward and took the bite. The fork was halfway out of his mouth when someone cleared their throat.
“I did
“Why won’t you give up on me? I’ve made your life a living hell for
“This is exciting, Cas! You haven’t gotten laid in
“Nothing. When you’re done there, do you wanna get dinner? I still feel like I owe you for bailing on you this morning.”
“Never. Your brother is a handful, but I love him. Whatever he’s going through, I wanna help him.”
“Yeah, what else is new?”
“Keeping me company.”
“Because I’m not an angel. I promise.”
“Fine. But if I hear
“Just relax. You’ve been friends with her for how many years? You know how to talk to her. Don’t over think it. Just be yourself.”
“You don’t like it, you pay for something more expensive,” Dean said, getting out of the car. Cas met him by the trunk and kissed him.
“Michael said it was my fault.”
“No problem. Why the fascination with angels?”
“I’ll help you. You really don’t have that much stuff. You’re just messy.”
“Only because you got a lucky guess.”
“Fuck off, the both of you. Let me eat this in peace or I’m gonna go hang out with my kids.”
“Yeah, yeah. Cas want his usual, too?”
“You’re an asshole,” Gabriel snapped.
“She’s right, though,” Jack said. “Kind of.” Dean frowned.
gave you his number. He wants you to text him. Just say hi.”
“You don’t have to.”
“Good,” Gabriel said. “Don’t get me wrong, Cas, I love ya, but you’re a mess. If things ended badly between you, things would get complicated for everyone.”
“Say no if you want me to stop.” Cas’s fingers grabbed Dean’s hair. Dean had no intention of giving Cas hickeys, but it was a pretext he’d needed to see if Cas would let him do this. “Gonna have to be quiet.” Cas tugged his hair a little.
“Cas, it’s four in the morning.”
“You know what, fuck you. Dad did the best he could with us.”
Dean stayed where he was. Going over would more than likely only cause problems. He would wait and see if Cas came over to him. It wasn’t like he cared anyway. At all. Except, yeah, he did. He never should’ve bitten Cas. The memory of that night was tattooed in his brain and it had been taunting him all week. He couldn’t sleep, he was distracted at work, and he had only himself to blame. He had better self control than that.
“Cassie, come on! How do you do it?”
“Oh, you’ve got it bad,” Sam said after about five minutes.
“Doesn’t matter. The point is, you should talk to him over the summer.”
That’s awesome! I’m at work right now, but I’ll call you tonight.
“I do.”
Cas was kissing him like he was drowning, and Dean was his only source of oxygen. Dean had never experienced anything like it. Cas’s tongue darted out and Dean opened his mouth. There was tongue and teeth and heat, and it was perfect right up until Dean tasted blood.
“Are we going on a picnic?” Castiel asked.
“Cool.” He hopped off the desk. “See ya tonight.”
“Easy, angel.” He spread his cheeks and pressed his tongue against his hole. Cas gasped, but didn’t say anything. Dean teased the entrance, gently biting at the sensitive skin. He dipped his tongue inside, slowly working him open.
“Why do you insist on doing this every year? I need to sleep, Sam.” Sam handed him a travel mug.
“Well, that was odd.”
“You’re getting wise in your old age, Jack.”
“Mission accomplished. You have work later, don’t you?”
“It’s soft.” Dean laughed.
“Come on, Gabe. Do you wanna go?”
“You know what, Dean? Why don’t you just tell me when I’m allowed to speak?”
“What?” she asked innocently.
to complain about, but I never really noticed it. I was in love with her. Then one morning, she woke up and decided to end it. I was sitting in the kitchen eating breakfast before my shift. She came in, told me point blank that we were on different paths and she needed to be with someone who was actually gonna get somewhere in life, then left to go to her internship. She just…walked out on me and told me I had to have my stuff out of the apartment by the end of the week. That was it. I only saw her once after that when I went to get my stuff and that was somehow worse.”
“Now what?” Charlie asked from where she was helping Benny chop vegetables. Dean slumped against the walk-in door.
“Yes. But
“Yes,” Dean and Gabriel said in unison. Cas looked at Dean.
“Dean, shut up.” Dean blinked in surprise. “I never stopped loving you. That’s why I left. I couldn’t be around you knowing that you could barely look at me. It hurt too much. Being away from you hurt even more, but I thought it would be better in the long run.”
“People are weird.”
“I’ve been seeing someone for about four months. I really like him and he’s leaving. He’s going to California. I knew that going in, but I guess I was kind of hoping being with me would be enough to get him to stay. My friend told me to go with him, but I don’t want to. I like my life here. And what if I go with him and then it doesn’t work out? I mean, my brother’s out there, but he’s got his girl and his college friends. If this doesn’t work then I’ll just be a burden on him. I can’t do that.” Dean sighed again, heavier this time. It felt good to get that out, but now that he had, he realized he just sounded like he was whining.
“WHAT?”
“Where do we put presents?” Cas asked after returning the kiss. Charlie started to giggle.
Cas smiled for the pictures, made polite conversation with anyone who engaged him, and kept up the appearance of the perfect son, but inside he was just waiting until he could get back to the hotel so he could text Dean. Barely two weeks had passed since the weekend in Minnesota and with each day that passed, the ache in his chest got deeper. He missed Dean. They texted every day, they talked on the phone at least twice a week, and they Facetimed whenever they could, but it wasn’t enough. He had to see him. In person.
“Thank god.”
“No texting Cas. Give him some space. You two can talk once he feels better and you’re sober.”
“All right. Why don’t we pick the car up tomorrow then? We were gonna hang out tomorrow anyway.”
“What is it?”
“Nice to meet you.”
“You heard me.”
“You’re trying to make me mad so I’ll leave you alone. You’re trying to push me away just like you did when I left. It’s not gonna work this time.”
“He loves that car more than anything in the world.” Gabriel paused. “Where are your earbuds?”
“Can I take a guess as to why?” Cas shrugged. “The gay thing?” That got a small smile out of him.
“Well, for starters, you’re wearing his jacket.” Cas shifted a little.
“We’re just that good.”
He smiled a little as he added the number to his phone under “Coffee Boy”. Meg poked him in the arm.
“Oh. All right then. I can sit with you.” Cas finally smiled.
“Why don’t you tell me about it? You look like you need to get something off your chest.” Dean sighed quietly. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad, getting advice from someone who didn’t know him.
“All right, what about you, Cas? See anyone you like?”
“Text me, please. Just so I know you’re okay.” Dean smiled in spite of himself.
“Quit trying to read my mind,” he grumbled.
“We’re friends, Sam.” Sam rolled his eyes so hard Dean was worried they might actually get stuck.
“How do you know that? This is our
“Later. Give him some space. At least a couple days. He needs breathing room.”
“A bisexual unicorn,” Dean said. “All right.”
“No. I don’t talk about things for a reason.”
“Knock yourself out. I’ll have breakfast done in thirty.”
“Are you sure?” Dean nodded, already pulling Cas towards Baby. “Dean, we don’t--.”
“You want some coffee with that?”
“Hey, Dean. Are you busy?” Dean wanted to snap. Everyone seemed to need something from him lately. But he had promised Sam he would try and be nice.
