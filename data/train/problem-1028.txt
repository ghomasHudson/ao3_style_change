“Probably not, honestly. But after... after losing my cool... I needed some air.”
“See what you can find.” I said. “You work at hospital – you could talk to the A&E staff, show them a photo. Maybe they’ve seen him.”
It had been a long time since Lestrade had been with a man — before his marriage. Before he’d even met Jude. He hadn’t expected to go that route again.
“I run errands.” The Beta volunteered. “Make sure Sherlock doesn’t run out of biscuits.”
“She’s not happy. I was supposed to meet her sister tonight.”
“I know.” John sounded grim. “I called Lestrade a few minutes ago. I’m going to make sure you and Shane get out and then keep an eye on Angus until he gets here.” He handed Sherlock his vest. “Put this on, yeah?”
Sherlock strained to hear John's answer – the pause was deafening. "Yeah. Yes." John said. "He's sincere, but that's not the point."
Mary snarled curses and writhed under him. She kicked at me as I tried to bind her ankles together. “Stop it!” John commanded in his ‘Captain Watson’ voice. “Or I’ll knock you out and tie you up.”
I prayed he was not beyond repair.
But Shane was right – John needed space.
Sherlock continued to look to John, but he answered Bob. "Yes, that's right."
“Get the tasers out first. Give everyone a voucher for admission. Anyone gets too stroppy, tase them.”
"Charming." Sherlock groaned, in no mood to flirt for favors.
He was trembling…
"Oh them." She waved dismissively at the group she'd come in with. "They're ok." She smiled sweetly at me. "I've missed YOU, John."
Shane smiled hopefully at 'will.' "He'll live with it if it means he can be with you."
John wasn’t sure when Harry started drinking. But liquor was the only thing that brought her out of her room. She was as belligerent a drunk as their father, screaming at Mum and belittling John caustically, blaming him for letting them take her, for not finding her sooner, for being an Alpha…
“Good.” John said, caressing my shoulders. His hands felt phenomenal. I’d forgotten how perfectly amazing it felt when John touched me like this. “But we need to wait until after you‘ve have a proper exam.”
“Glove.” Sherlock demanded. He held out a hand without looking up.
The enemy held his hands... Sherlock tried to fight, but he had no strength. There was shouting, it was so loud! Figures looming over him! Voices booming!
“We discussed this, Sherlock. You can’t see him. He can’t know – for his own safety as well as yours. Otherwise, why did we go through this ridiculous charade?!”
Sherlock smiled humorlessly. “Staking me out like a goat?” He asked. Sherlock curled first one and then both of his long legs around Moran’s waist and pulled him closer, then leaned as far forward as he could with his wrists shackled behind him. His lips just buzzed Moran’s.
**You want it rough.**
“It was just a dream.”
“John! Oh, yes!” Sherlock moaned. Then he came quite suddenly, shuddering and spurting a jet of semen across my abdomen, his tight hole somehow becoming tighter. He collapsed onto my chest and I wrapped my arms around him, dug my heels into the mattress and fucked him through his climax, jackhammering until I felt my engorged cock swell and spit, and I was floating on the crashing waves of pleasure, Sherlock in my arms.
“Didn’t we talk about this? Use your own computer for experiments. Actually, just use your own computer."
"Yes, all right!" Shane said angrily. Then he shook his head. "I don't know what's wrong with me." He'd been walking around the block and loitering near the entrance since he’d arrived hours ago. He still had the red blanket from the Ambulance around his shoulders.
“Jim didn’t like killing either. Not firsthand, anyway.”
I touched his arm. “Sherlock, something’s been bothering you for weeks. What is it? Let me help.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Then his phone buzzed again. And again.
Sherlock wept, the tears rolling unchecked across his face into his pillow. He should NEVER have let himself hope that John might be his.
"You were just a kid..."
*You're beautiful* John had written. *I miss you*
John knew now that I'm not asexual. Would he guess how I feel about him? Did I want him to? It would be a relief... but I didn't want John's pity. I didn’t want to lose our friendship.
"Tonight, when you told me that you loved me, how much you loved me... how you wanted us to be together... you scared me. I wanted to run. I shouldn't have left you alone here, but I ... I...
"You're afraid." She said matter-of-factly.
“I’m not letting her go.” Mary said. But it wasn’t as vehement.
Mycroft smiled, warmth in it despite his distraction. “Greg.”
I retreated back to the kitchen, listening to John stumping down the stairs. He sat down as I got us water. "Do you want a beer?" I asked him. "Wine?"
“Are you hungry?” Shane asked.
“Tell me more about yourself, John. I feel like I’ve been talking all evening.” Shane said.
That afternoon when the bullies came for me, I didn’t just try to fight back, I attacked. Little, ginger eight year old, flinging himself like a berserker at older, bigger boys... and it worked! They couldn’t intimidate me and I quickly became too much trouble to bother with.
“Honestly… I came by for a bit of advice.”
Moran tucked the handgun into the waistband at the back of his trousers. It didn’t ruin the line of his suit at all. He glanced at the cabinet that held the video monitors. “Dr. Watson still has to die – and the other fellow. But I’ll make it quick.”
Roaring with rage, the American doctor leapt at John, raining blows down on his head. He took more than a few hits, struggling to do more than defend himself. He was tired and weakening... with the last of his strength he grabbed for her arm as she jabbed... and caught it easily!
"Ok, back on your side!" John commanded – Sherlock heard the fear behind the words. "Shane, help me roll him."
John had been a reluctant cocksucker. He’d only tried twice and despite taking out my piercing for him, he was tentative. He tried – he did really try – but he was daunted by his gag reflex. No one LIKES to choke and feel the tears stream from their eyes, it’s just something one had to accept when one loved cock. John hadn’t accepted it – he might love me, but he didn’t lust after the male member. I had avoided the subject for fear it would alienate him, hasten the inevitable end of our affair.
He stood up straight and turned to me. He viewed me coolly, but then his brow furrowed. "You're pale. Do you feel ok?"
He kissed me again then tugged me up the stairs. At the top, I pinned him again, staying one step below him, our mouths level for once. I was content to snog there until I felt his prick throb against my hip.
Then I heard the front door again. Voices in the hall – one belovedly familiar. A knock on the study door. “Dr. Watson is here.” One of Mycroft’s assistants. “Are you ready for him?”
We found Geraint cleaning rifles, his gun dogs lolling lazily at his feet. Both dogs stood as we entered – they swarmed around us, wiggling and wagging the stumps of their tails, sniffing at me and asking for attention from Victor.
I plucked it from his fingers, stubbing it out on the bottom of my shoe. I waved my hand at the cloud of cigarette smoke surrounding us, looking for the source.
“Call 999.” I commanded the woman. “Hey!”
I smiled blandly, though he didn't deign to look up from his task. "I wanted to speak with you."
“Not bad with the hand-to-hand combat either.”
“Fizzy water.” He said and I grabbed the bottle of sparkling from the fridge. We sat together on the couch, legs touching from knee to ankle, and started opening takeaway containers.
Sherlock groaned. “I’m awake... Lestrade...” He slurred. He forced himself to sit up and touch the gun in his pocket, make sure it was still there. “I’m awake.” He sagged against the policeman. The other Omega's arms supported him. Sitting up, Sherlock's head cleared a little.
-careful, you’ll turn my head-
“What are you doing?” Mycroft demanded. He had access to all the CCTV in the country (and quite a bit from the continent) on his laptop – which I was busily making use of. Mycroft commandeered the screen. “I should have known!” He said disapprovingly. “You have to rid yourself of this morbid curiosity and get to work!”
SHERLOCK
Sherlock leaned forward. “You don’t think that I would be more… motivated – more patient with the dull process of getting to know someone new – if you could continue to threaten John’s existence? Seb.” Sherlock made the name sound like an endearment AND a challenge.
“What we’re trying to tell you,” Virginia said. “Is to trust yourself. You’ll know when you meet an Alpha with whom it's worth bonding. There are a lot of Alphas and not very many of us – you can afford to be choosy. You
Neither Shane nor Sherlock were in his room when John returned. He felt relieved – they hadn't left him alone much recently. And he was tired, he hadn't slept much last night. Maybe he'd have a nap before dinner.
"I'm not a socialist, Mr. Holmes, I'm a millionaire."
Meeting John Watson – limping, depressed, aimless as he was – had definitely put me in the mood. There was something attractive in the very idea of a military man. (At least, that’s what I told myself.)
They nodded. All of them, pulling their legs into their chests or wrapping their arms around themselves.
“What kind of case?” John asked.
"You should take it easy – rest that broken leg." John said. "Give it a chance to heal."
"You could just hang up."
I sat up and drew my knees into my chest. I didn't want him to see my morning arousal.
John heard the unspoken words: the difference between keeping and losing your hand. "Why?" John asked quietly, his voice tight. "Why didn't he?"
Sherlock wants to empower the rescued Omegas.
But Sherlock had already steepled his fingers in front of his face and retreated into himself.
Bit of table setting this week. I’m super excited about next week’s chapter! Much will be revealed...
But my limitations have not stopped me from dreaming of you, dreaming of being with you. Something as simple as walking down the street next to you fills me with such joy. To be with you carnally – I've barely even dared to dream. The power of those feelings is shocking. I understand now why people kill for love – I would not hesitate to kill if you were threatened.
“The best.”
“Of course, I do. You know I do.” I held him, my fingers in his hair, rubbing gentle circles. “Why do you doubt me?”
Legal matters? Mycroft wouldn’t waste his time trying to wrest guardianship from John through the courts – the law supported the bondmate’s claim over family in every instance. Even, unfortunately, if the Alpha was abusive. By bonding with John, Sherlock had very neatly sidestepped both Moriarty and his overbearing brother.
“Do you shoot?” He asked. “Of course you bloody shoot, you’re daft and barmy like me.”
“John...” She said.
He ate the chip, smiling. “You always want to take care of me.”
“Is that what you were going to do? Sell Sherlock? Pimp him out?” John blurted, hoping desperately to distract Moriarty from touching his mate.
John took Sherlock’s hand, feeling his need for comfort. “Must be terrible, going through heat all alone.”
It took almost an hour to get to the prison. The longest hour of my life. We landed almost a klick away to avoid detection. It had been LONG time since I’d run with 20 kilograms of gear on my person and I was VERY glad I was in shape. I managed to keep up with the youngsters – it wasn’t pretty and I was sucking air, but I didn’t get left behind.
Sherlock set that aside - along with everything else that wouldn't help him get John back. "Ok - today, what else did he do?"
John didn’t linger there. He tugged me under the shower again, rinsing me thoroughly. He had me sit on the edge of the tub and poured a dollop of shampoo from the tiny bottle that came with the shower. He lathered my stubbled fuzz, tracing the cut over my ear with his fingers. He was extremely gentle, and I knew he saw that it was still bruised and a little swollen.
"John can take care of himself."
I could hear Mycroft shuffling paper. “Don’t tell me – Sherlock left me everything.” John joked.
“From their medical records, the murdered Omegas didn’t have the ideal genetic profile, so their eggs were considered unusable.” Mycroft said without inflection. “And they weren’t able, for whatever reason, to bring a healthy baby to term.”
"I don't like it." John's hand caressed Sherlock's cheek - Sherlock closed his eyes and savoured the sensation. John's fingers felt wonderful. John pulled him forward and kissed him.
I love him. But I hate him too. He's not the only one with new scars - he cut me deeper than I thought anyone could when he died. And deeper still when I discovered he had used me - and my foolish grief - for his own purposes. I don't know how to forgive him for that. I am just a another tool to be used.
They were standing in the kitchen as they had a thousand times before but now it was awkward, the electricity between them a burden. Sherlock thought he should leave and was about to say so… then he saw the plate of biscuits John had set out with the tea, and the spoon he’d placed by Sherlock’s mug for sugar. Sherlock was overcome with grief – what had he done?! How could he have thrown all this away.
"Sorry! Sorry... John..." Victor slurred. He sounded dead drunk.
John hadn’t thought he could be harder, could become more aroused – he had been wrong. His cock stood tall and firm against his abdomen, fat and weeping precome from the slit. He stroked it lightly as he watched Sherlock penetrate himself first with one finger then two.
It looked similar to the inside of the tent John had pulled Harry out of, right down to the Omegas strapped to gurneys and exam benches divided by curtains. The only differences were the size and the sheer number – there were far more than three here in the cavernous room. They wore thin hospital gowns over their nudity, and several weren’t wearing heat harnesses.
Mycroft shushed him. “Not here!” He sighed impatiently. “The library. At least there aren’t any windows.” He pushed John forward towards me, but he was reluctant to move.
Mycroft nodded. “I’ll meet you outside.”
"For what?!"
Sherlock looked stroppy, but his sweet tooth wouldn't be denied. "Biscuits. If they have any."
"Did you catch... whoever's doing this?"
“Shut up, Selwyn.” Geraint said tightly. “Not in front of our guests.”
John had learned that Sherlock didn't understand people very well. He could observe and deduce so much yet still not understand how those things might make someone feel. The Omega's blunt manner was honest, often offensive, and devoid of sentiment. Sherlock regularly felt confused by John's feelings and reactions through their link. John sensed him studying John's emotions, trying to fathom the whys and wherefores.
Nothing. Either he had nerves of steel or he wasn’t in there.
“It’s rare for a pureblood to bond outside of the established families.”
"It was years ago. Before I met you." I said, conscious of my flaming cheeks. I don't know why I was embarrassed – I'd met a dozen men the same way I'd met Ravi.
“I’m going!” I said. “You can lend me some rain gear or not, but I’m going.”
“No. Just something to pass the time.” I tried to say it casually, but even I didn’t believe it.
Sherlock nodded. He opened the back door and walked out into the daylight. He heard the door close and the bolt shoot home as he walked down the stairs and away.
“No, it’s just strange…” John did not sound convincing. “It’s not... you." He scratched the back of his head. "It's all about finding Molly, yeah?”
I missed him so much!
"Actually, it was Mrs. Hudson."
When Sherlock saw him, he made an inhuman noise — a gurning wail that made John struggle towards him, attracted by the sound.
“Cheers. ... What?”
He was heartily sick of needing rescue. And he never wanted to apologize for bloody Sherlock again.
Sherlock had looked confused at first. He’d dropped the bartitsu stick he’d been wielding and stared at his hand. Lestrade had had to be quick on his feet, jumping in front of the consulting detective and using the cricket bat to smash the skulls of the approaching quartet. It had been a near thing, taking out all four by himself.
“You know what he did to me.” Sherlock couldn’t stop his eyes from flicking to John’s lap. “Yeah. I can’t bear the thought of him doing anything like that to you.” He caressed Sherlock’s side with clumsy fingers.
“Yeah. I know.”
"We need to talk."
John touches my arm, my wrist. I realise he’s searching for my pulse.
He curled up on one end of the couch and opened it. There were two pages of a legal pad covered in longhand. John took a sip of his tea, set down the mug and began to read.
"I accept the things I can't change…" I subvocalised, mouthing the words over and over. Mantras are stupid, I thought, but I didn't stop repeating the phrase. It would be easy to score heroin - walk out Mrs. Hudson's back door, grab the Underground to Camden…it would be so easy to score there. I'd need works… that might be more difficult - I never shared needles, not even in prison - but not so difficult I couldn't be blissfully nodding off within a couple hours. I even had a bolt hole in Camden Town where I could retreat with the drugs… "I accept the things I can't change…" The words were meaningless now, just nonsense syllables murmured again and again. Like a magic spell. What spell was I casting? What was I trying to accomplish?
Suddenly I was exhausted. I sat down in Mrs. Hudson's kitchen chairs and listened - the stillness around me betrayed the flat's emptiness... the whole building's emptiness. I was disappointed, I'd hoped to see John... hold him... feel his arms around me...
“Ashborn College.” She said. “I want to be a pathologist like my mother.”
I nodded and returned to my task – still slightly puzzled. I reminded myself that John had only been with women, perhaps they were more fastidious... that made some sense, not having experienced the equipment first-hand. I had no idea how I'd react to pussy... it reinforced my gut instinct that men belonged with men...
“‘E ‘ad a gun. Sawr it on ‘is belt.”
"It's not clear to ME." John said in that way he has that makes me question myself.
"What did he do?"
“Yeah.”
John is lost to me.
“Ok – but why?”
“But you made progress on the blood samples.”
“Someone will be here if you change your mind.” Mycroft said as the door closed on him.
“Yes, you do. Not because of this.” Shane gestured at John’s left arm. “We all need someone.”
When they got to the lift, Moran nodded at his henchman. “Follow them.” He said. “Make sure…”
"But..."
Sherlock looked closer. Someone was in the sling – he could see the outline of the body. Feet, with ropes looped around the ankles protruded from one end. The video was high enough resolution that Sherlock could see the intricate knotting that held every loop of rope in place. Freeing the person would require that each loop be individually cut.
"It was a little village about two hundred klicks outside of Rishikesh. A tiger had been killing goats. Then she took a child. No one in the village felt safe, they kept their fires burning all night long, even though it was hot.
John felt himself blush. It felt GOOD. And Shane’s hands felt even better.
She hugged back fiercely. “John! Oh, I’m so glad you’re ok!”
"Oh, hell no!" John said and incapacitated Victor with a swift move that sent him face first into the wall where John held him, fury barely contained. "Sherlock, are you ok?" He called to me.
. He smells like… it sounds like sentimental nonsense, but he smells like happiness to me. I asked him to bond with me less than a half hour after meeting him. I knew if we were bonded, no one could force me to bond with... with anyone else. I thought I might regret it, making such a hasty choice, but I don’t. I could never regret John.”
"I don't."
“I feel woozy.” John said, lying bonelessly in our nest. I lay next to him, fitting my head into the space between his shoulder and neck and smiling, fitting my body against his. I let myself be happy.
Suddenly he slowed and stroked into me with excruciating deliberateness. I wept with lust and frustration, gyrating my hips, trying to take more of him.
“Where?”
"Oh jesus...." John moaned. "Fuuuck!" He was sitting on the edge of my bed, legs spread, hands tense on his thighs. I stroked him slowly and looked up into his face. He licked his lips unconsciously and my erection strained against my trousers. I took his hand and kissed it, then placed it on my head, smiling a little. I swallowed him down again, savouring the weight of his hand. He had a fistful of my hair and I let him guide my head.
John waited for me. HE WAITED FOR ME! I cannot fathom how he waited 882 days – years of his life – for ME. A skinny, obstinate, thoughtlessly cruel person with the opposite anatomy than what he prefers…
I shook him, I cried out. I kissed him again and again, his cheeks and brow, his mouth and chin... but he ignored me. Victor, however, Victor didn't like what I was doing. He grabbed me and with one great heave, threw me over the edge. I plummeted...
“Got it.”
London! I HAD missed it! The smells, the sounds, the familiar neighbourhoods, the streets...
Abruptly he stood up. He knew where he was – if that stupid wall hadn’t been in the middle of the stupid alley he would have been in his bolt-hole by now – and all those people wouldn’t be trying to kill each other. He could still get there, hide himself away… but the riot would tell Mycroft and (shudder) Jim exactly where to look for him. Sherlock would never be safe.
Dad formed an informal pack of Alphas who spent the games yelling ‘advice’ from the sidelines and belittling Coach. John couldn’t help but see the Beta parents – and a few of the Alphas –avoiding his Dad, glancing sympathetically at Coach. They did that defensive Beta thing where they grouped up like herd animals – safety in numbers. The Alpha pack thought that was hysterical.
"Then I won't delete it." Sherlock said with quiet sincerity.
"You're not a fool, John. There must be some explanation – I can't believe he'd do that."
Sherlock scoffed. “Or course they are, they’re Alphas. But it doesn’t matter now. You are mine and nothing will change that.”
“A prostitute...” I echoed stupidly.
“A distracted man is a happy man?”
Was he going to do to Shane what Angus' boyfriend had done to him? It wasn't exactly analogous – Angus had been with Taz for many years, John had been seeing Shane for a year. They hadn't made any commitments stronger than an agreement that they were boyfriends. That they were exclusive.
I woke again in the morning light. I could hear John in the kitchen and listened contentedly for several minutes... until my dried out and aching throat drove me out of bed for tea.
“Lestrade?” Sherlock prompted. Lestrade gave him an aggrieved look. “John is completely trustworthy. You have nothing to fear.”
“Ha! Queen. Two cards.” I was playing Beggar My Neighbour with Fielding. He was at least fifteen years my junior, and apparently his parents hadn’t cared for cards – I’d had to teach him. I’d tried teaching him rummy first... but Beggar My Neighbour was more his speed.
John discarded the sling and pulled the hospital gown off in front of the mirror. He examined his torso, the bruises, the rope burns, the finger marks around his neck. He glanced once at the white, dead hand with the fingers curling loosely towards the warm, rosy wrist. They would amputate tomorrow, John was certain.
Sherlock fit another finger into himself, frigging in and out. “Oh John...” He moaned. “Touch me.” He eased a fourth finger in, his big hand making his hole gape.
"YES!" Finally she understood.
Imaging was endless and required me to lay flat on my back. It was horrid. I complained bitterly, demanding to be anesthetized immediately.
“Yeah, how did you –“
“John...”
I remember the moment I realized that I was in love with you. It was at the swimming pool when you stepped out – I didn’t know yet that you had been taken by Moriarty and forced to do this. For that moment, I thought that somehow YOU were Moriarty.
John's phone rang.
He would be found.
“You’ll take your gun.”
It wasn't. The heroin wasn’t helping – it was just postponing what he had to do. It WAS time to go to rehab.
With an effort, Lestrade pulled back. He took Mycroft’s hand and led him down the hall to his bedroom.
“Yes.” I said. “Now.”
John took a deep breath and opened his door.
John followed Sherlock off the derelict barge and up the mud flat away from the river. “Why’d you call her Aunt?” He asked, tasting the complex roil of emotion his mate was feeling.
"Mr. Watson?" The doctor said. Was she asking? What was she asking? John couldn't follow. The nurses were giving him an I.V. while the doctor continued to speak. "You're in circulatory shock? I'm giving you fluids and something for your pain?" She made every statement sound like a question, as if she was seeking his approval. Did she expect an answer? John couldn't formulate one.
I regarded him skeptically, wondering what he wanted. "Were you at Wallog when your father had his accident?"
"John? John!" It was Shane. He was standing over John looking worried.
Something else happens today, something I’m equally as fearful of: Moriarty’s trial. I’m to be called as a witness, John will sit in the gallery and monitor the entire affair. It’s the beginning of a new chapter... and an end to this one.
Lestrade liked the look of Mycroft in his bed.
"No, Shane...!"
Ten minutes later, John left the flat in trainers and sweats, the sleeve of his sweatshirt pulled down over his stump. Sherlock watched from the window as John stretched cursorily on the front stoop then trotted down the pavement. Sherlock picked up his violin.
"Yes." I said. "John, I'm worried that Moriarty will be acquitted..."
But now, in one sentence, I had accused him, tried him and found him wanting.
"I lost yours. Plug it in now – the cables are in the bag – and it'll be ready to go in an hour or so."
“Best I ever had.”
He was alive!
“Yikes. Where’s Roger now?”
I grinned ferally. “You’ve got it Pete Tong.” I said, the rhyming slang for ‘wrong.’ “Seb, mate, that wasn’t Sherlock in the Tommy Trinder.”
The adrenaline had given him purpose and clarity, but Sherlock was still weak. He needed Shane’s wiry strength to support him, to keep him moving forwards. He was surprised at the power in Shane’s skinny form – and he thought bitterly that this must be what John felt when they touched...
Nazer himself had been the torturer, and I was grateful for it after a fashion. He hadn’t pulled his punches – he’d mulched my face with his fists, laid open my back with a bamboo cane, and had broken three of my fingers with stunning nonchalance. But he hadn’t used a knife. Or a blow torch. He hadn’t ruptured any organs. He hadn’t cut or gouged out pieces of me. Even in the middle of it, I was cognizant that Nazer was deliberately avoiding causing me permanent damage.
“Yeah. I mean, this feels amazing. Thank you.”
“You? No. He thought it might be the Queen. Or Angela Merkel. I was certain that if my brother had a soulmate, it was an endless supply of fairy cakes.”
"Yes!" Sherlock agreed. "Fuck your cum into me! Harder!! Oh!"
John nodded once – acknowledgment not agreement – and the burly nurse walked away.
"Sherlock wasn't my boyfriend." John said.
"I've followed your career in the papers. It seemed that you were doing well – helping the police solve crimes, helping people with problems. I've even looked at the blog a few times."
"Do you know what your brothers were doing?"
**how rough?**
"Not him. Of course not HIM, whoever he was. But I knew that if it were you in the next stall, I would be on my knees in a second. And I realized, I wished it were you. I wanted it to be you."
At the bottom of the corkscrew, there was another locked door. Moran pulled out a key - from a different pocket, Sherlock noted – and let them in.
Now John was finally in a cab, turning onto Baker Street for the first time since he’d been kidnapped by Moran’s men. It felt like years, not weeks. He was relieved and happy to be coming home.
There was a thump and a groan. I couldn't help but smile – I knew the sound of John being a bad-ass when I heard it.
“Right.” I said, clearing my throat. “How do you know which flat?”
"Yeah. Yes. But... "
"And Shane..."
I shucked off my jeans and pants, pulling the duvet over me to ward off the chill.
“Would you like to see Dr. Watson? Would that make you feel better?”
"Perfect?" Lestrade asked doubtfully.
Walter's eyebrows shot up to his hairline. "Fine? All you've talked about for weeks is how much you love London, how you can't wait to see John. Aren't you excited?"
After that... Vinokourov was supposed to kill me. The heroin wouldn’t have mattered if he’d killed me. It was an escape from that hellish existence – I was plaything, whore, punching bag... I was utterly and completely debased. I took all the drugs they would give me whilst I awaited the comfort of death.
It was Mycroft’s turn to sigh. “She’s home from hospital. But I’m afraid she may never fully recover. It was quite a blow.”
. “But now that you point it out, maybe I…”
Rammstein was a kaleidoscope of activity – shining lights and motion in the darkness. I couldn’t sleep through it, but I curled on my cot and let it all happen. The morphine drip had stopped, and that worried me, but I wasn’t in pain yet and I felt confident of my ability to bully more from the doctors.
“I should be working on the case.”
He’s sleeping with her, but he doesn’t say “I love you” in any of his notes. It’s cold comfort.
Sherlock's eyes snapped open. "No – no sleeping. We have to work tonight!"
Lestrade ignored the jibe. “I saw the video. You picked John out of that riot. How did you know? How did you know it would work out with him?”
"France! Paris! I can't wait!" Gereth cried, moaning happily.
He woke when they moved him to a private room. Mycroft's functionary was still there. "Do you know anything about Sherlock?" John asked him. "And Shane? Shane Bruno?" He remembered Shane was going back into Moran's compound. Why had he allowed that? The hypoxia had confused and weakened him to a greater degree than he realized.
“We’re almost home.” Sherlock demurred. “And it IS beautiful out.”
I knew what he wanted. I began to thrust into the tight crevice between his legs, the lotion easing my way. It felt lovely – and even lovelier when he began to suck on my neck, nipping at my collarbone then bruising my lips with his kisses. Now he gave me the urgent, hungry kisses I craved. I kissed him back, sloppy and demanding. My thrusts got harder and faster.
The door was open, and John let himself in. He could hear a class in session. It brought back so many memories.
"I don't know. I hoped he was lying, he didn't have John."
“No? I thought you were in the Army.”
"John knows the worst and he loves me anyway. Even now he loves me."
“Right. I’m sorry.”
Mycroft opened his mouth to argue, then thought better of it and gazed balefully down at Sherlock. Clearly, he'd made his point.
Sherlock ate most of his curry and a bit of John’s, then he set down his plate and picked the laptop back up. He’d been without a phone or computer for a week and suddenly he couldn’t imagine how he’d managed. He heard John chuckling softly, felt his amusement. He received a detailed image of himself on his hands and knees with his face pressed into the mattress and his arse up, begging to be fucked. He elbowed his mate in the stomach.
“Rugby? Oooh, it’s been a tight one, but then again, it always is! Do you plan on joining up again?”
“Now, I know you’ve only just gotten back, and I’m sure you have a thousand things to get sorted, but I am
“Smith, keep your head in the boat. I don’t care how many women’s crews we pass, the more you turn your head, the slower we go, and the less likely it is you’ll have a medal to inspire one of them to actually go home with you.”
“John! John Watson!” a familiar voice called from across the way. Mike Stamford, his friend from secondary school and fellow medical student, scrambled excitedly across the path.
Ahh, so he was as young as he looked. “Does he row for St. John’s?”
Aside from a few curious glances, hardly any of the people inside noticed the stranger in their presence. John watched as boats of all sizes were directed out from the racks, into slings on the dock, and into the water. It was all so organized- a smaller man, the coxswain, was in charge of shouting the commands to the larger rowers, who followed without a sound. The rigidity reminded him a bit of the military. Perhaps that was why he had been so successful there, he thought.
“Well, the annual regatta between Exeter and St. Johns happens next weekend, and St. Johns has won in the 8s for the past twenty years. I did manage to get him out of some trouble after what could very generously be considered an ‘accident’ in the chemistry lab, and so he owes me a favour. Kennick’s known the family for years, and is one of the few who can actually tolerate Sherlock, and asked if he’d step in after our last coxswain quit. But knowing Sherlock, it likely has more to do with the desire to piss off his brother than it does with helping either of us. Despite what he says, he must see
“Sure.” John cut into Greg's story with a smile. After everything he’d been through, now more than ever he realised how little time he really had. Rowing a boat for a friend? Why not. Maybe it would be good for him.
“How did you...?” John asked, glancing back and forth between Sherlock and Greg.
Their row continued mostly smoothly. For the most part, Sherlock gave very good advice.
The inside of the boathouse was a flurry of activity. Shells sat on racks six boats high, with smaller boats suspended from the ceiling by elaborate pulley systems. There was a wall of mirrors on one side of the room with sixteen ergometers lined up in front of it. His stomach flipped as he saw them, memories of the torturous workouts inflicted upon him in his earlier youth. On the other wall hung what seemed like endless sets of oars. The side of the building closest to the river was made up of several massive garage doors, all opened for access to the large dock outside.
“Wilson, you’re squaring up too late. Yes, there... Better.”
Yes, still late…
Since it was John’s first day back, they did a simple steady-state row, a chance for the eight of them to feel each other’s strokes and begin to adapt to this new rhythm. Every time John got caught up in his own head, Sherlock would tell him to relax, to breathe, to sit tall. After an hour and a half on the water, the sun was finally above the horizon, and the coxswain turned their boat around back to the club. He docked the boat, very skilfully, John thought, given the modest head wind that had developed over the course of the morning, and the crew climbed out. They put the boat back into its rack, hung up their oars, and gathered in a circle as was customary to discuss the row.
Sherlock signed the paper without reading it, and as he began to walk away, his phone rang from inside his pocket. He sighed dramatically before answering, “How many times do I have to tell you that I have absolutely no interest in assisting you?...
“Yeah, that’s how he always is,” Greg replied to the questions in John’s face. “He’s actually a brilliant rower. One of the top in the light weight single in the whole country, and only 17. Refuses to race, though. Genius of a man, too. Got into Oxford at age 15, and his brother Mycroft pulled some strings so that he could live at St. John’s College.”
“Alright, Sherlock, this one’s for you. Says you’re good to go coxing this weekend. John, ready to sign your soul away?” Greg asked, grinning.
They stayed at the table talking long after everyone else had left the dining hall. Molly yawned. “I’d best get to bed, but it’s so lovely to have you back, John! I’ll see you tomorrow morning! Did I tell you I’m assisting with your anatomy lecture?”
“Yeah, thanks, see you later,” John replied, walking out of the building, wondering what he’d gotten himself into.
As soon as they were on the water, John suddenly felt overwhelmed. Maybe he shouldn’t have jumped into a boat this quickly. Maybe a day inside on the ergos would have been better for getting back into it. Did he even remember how to hold an oar? Was this all a terrible mistake?
the blade forward, flapping like an
“We will begin the warmup with stern four. Sitting ready at the release, arms and body only, ready,
“How are you doing?” she asked. The concern and understanding in her eyes felt deeper than anyone’s attempts at empathy since his return.
Pretty good was an understatement, John thought. Given his size- too short to be successful in the open category, but too heavy to row as a light weight, he certainly wasn’t destined for success in small boats. But throw him in with seven other men, and he could make a boat
“He rowed for at least four years. Lots of raw power, but not the right size to excel in the single. Quit to join… hmm, must’ve been rugby, judging by the calves and swagger in his stride. Definitely more success with the ladies after that. Perhaps you should take a hint from him, Kennick.”
“I’m not sure how well I’ll do on the ergos, but I guess it’s inevitable,” he smiled back.
“Chapman, hold the forward body angle for a moment longer.”
John thought.
“John Watson,” he replied, still somewhat in awe. He noted thick calluses on Sherlock’s hands. Certainly not from coxing. Was he a rower, too?
“Alright, Sherlock, let’s get to it,” Greg said, with something less than enthusiasm.
“Sherlock, leave the poor man alone. Let’s talk about today’s row. I thought we were catching well together. Low stroke rate, so tough to say how it’ll translate at a higher speed, but the consistency was there,” Greg remarked. Several of the men nodded back.
No, that implies I feel some sentimental loyalty to a college I have no personal connection to...
You don’t even row, why on earth do you care which college I’m representing?...
John snorted.
“There’s always room for one more at The Lighthouse!” Mike replied, grinning. “Well, if rugby is out, I heard Greg is looking for someone to fill a spot in the men’s 8 for the regatta next weekend. You were a pretty good rower before you switched over to rugby, weren’t you?”
“John! So good to have you back, mate!” he exclaimed, giving him a hearty pat on the back. John smiled and nodded to Mike, who was standing to his left. He must’ve already told Greg about their earlier meeting.
“And you made it here that quickly? Well, then! You haven’t changed a bit. Missed the madness, did you?”
“How long have you been rowing?” asked a jovial brunet. Smith, was it? The one who couldn’t keep his eyes off the women’s crews. Kennick, John remembered from Greg’s earlier introduction.
Greg shrugged his shoulders. “He’s just… like that,” he said with a smile, folding his arms as he looked over at Sherlock, who was readjusting his curls, his microphone now in his hand.
“Rowing? I honestly haven’t thought about that in ages. Yeah, rugby definitely had its draw, but rowing could be a good way to clear my head. Well, if you see Greg, let him know that I’m interested. Good seeing you, Mike, but I best be off. Trying to sort out schedules and such. Care to meet tonight for dinner at the Hall?”
“How’s the team this season?” he asked, eager for something safer to talk about.
The men lifted the boat, carried it out to the dock, and rolled it into the water. They grabbed their oars, locking them into the riggers. “Send oars,” rang their coxswain’s voice. “One foot in, lean away and press off.”
He had really missed his friends, he realised. While it was true this had been his first full day back at Oxford, he had been in London for several months, but had been too afraid to tell anyone he knew. Things had been hard, and he wasn’t ready to talk, but now that he was surrounded by the people who cared about him, he realised how much he had missed his life here.
seen me,” John responded, smiling.
“Sure? Really?! John, you are a GREAT man,” he said clapping him on the back again, grinning from ear to ear. “Meet us at the boathouse tomorrow morning at 5 am. I’d best get to bed- definitely need to be well-rested to deal with our substitute coxswain tomorrow. Can’t live with ‘em, can’t live without ‘em- am I right John?” he said, still grinning.
Guess that means I’ll just have to spend some more time cheering with you at the pub, eh?” he replied, forcing a laugh for good measure.
“Mycroft assumed he would row for them, keeping up their impressive legacy, but he managed to piss of everyone on the crew, probably intentionally, now that I think about it, and so they won’t have him row with them. He takes his own single out every day, though, probably headed there right now.”
. He watched Greg’s body sitting in front of him, and matched his movements as he dropped his blade into the water at the catch, swung his body backwards, and tapped his hands down to pick the blade up out of the water at the finish.
“In two, lengthen to half slide. That’s one, two,” came the voice again. John added a slight bend of his knees to lengthen the stroke, moving together with Greg, each stroke feeling a bit more natural. “And in two, take it to full slide.”
“John!” he heard Greg call. He turned and walked over to see him standing with a group of 6 other men. This must be his boat. “This is Phillip, Shane, Rob, Kennick, Michael, and Tristan.” He rattled off the names too quickly for John to register. “I’m stroke, you’ll sit seven. You do row starboard?”
“Perhaps a bit,” he replied politely. His time in Afghanistan was stressful, and to be honest, he missed the
When he arrived at the Hall for dinner, he was surprised to see Greg Lestrade waving him over.
John wished Greg a good night and walked outside for a final breath of cool air before making his way to his room and slipping into bed.
John awoke on the first buzz of his alarm. He had hardly slept, fading in and out of troubled dreams involving his friends and the war. He lay still for a moment, letting his heart rate recede before sliding out of bed and pulling on some rowing trou he had placed on his desk the previous night. He pulled on a tracksuit, grabbed his keys, and walked out the door.
“Yeah, thanks, you too,” replied John.
It had been all over the papers. John wasn’t sure if he was glad, since it meant he didn’t need to explain, or if it made things worse, with everyone thinking they knew what had happened. After brief conversations with his family, he had decided to avoid the topic with everyone but his therapist. The look of pity in their eyes had only made things worse. Their hearts were always in the right place, but that didn’t make it any less painful.
Once outside, he began to jog toward the river. While he had never been inside, his usual running route through town passed right by the College Boathouses, and so he knew exactly where to go. The lights and movement inside seemed out of place in the stillness of the sleeping town. He found the right building and slowed to a walk, following two men wearing Exeter jackets through the door.
“Seven seat, relax the left shoulder. Head up, eyes forward, breathe.”
“Excellent. Now I’ve got to go find Sherlock so we can get out on the water already. Bastard only seems to show up when he’s good and ready.”
"Thank you sooo much!"  He puts the book down and grabs Sherlock in a tight hug, affectionately kissing his friend's cheek.  "I love it."
Fawnlock bleated softly at the bare contact, his chest rumbling as he began to nose John's jaw once more, lips trailing sensitive skin. The fawn's dark hands tentatively roved his mate's now bare skin, a hand skimming the warm swell of the human's bum, fingers trailing light circles into his thighs and hips.
John was certainly pleased to make his mate so wonderfully happy, and without much effort on his part apparently. Well, no, that wasn't exactly true. John was pouring all his being into loving Fawnlock, and the effects proved it beyond a doubt. His heart melted to hear such devotion and dedication in his mate's beautiful words. He sighed happily and held the fawn tighter, nuzzling against whatever bit of him he could get to, be it curl or ear or soft cheek. He hoped the fae would always be this happy with him, though surely every relationship would have its bumps along the way.
"I passed as well mummy, fly colors and all that."
The Fae chuckled softly, squeezing John's finger reassuringly, "Don't worry John, after a while moving around the woods quietly will come to you easily. When you learn the forest well enough, allot will come to you naturally." He resumed his quiet humming.
"You had a head start you cheater!" He ruffles Sherlock's hair, making it messier than usual. Sherlock laughs, poking his tongue out at his older brother.
"Tell my love to wreck it all,
"Let's go then," the fawn grinned softly, eyes still bright.
Sherlock smiles softly and hugs John back, squeezing tightly. The statement is true for both of them.
"I see you're setting up the maze..." Mycroft He smiles lightly, he would never admit how happy - yet jealous of his brother he is. So happy and has a friend who loves him dearly.
They are moving quickly, Mycroft unsure of where they are headed; he knows not where Greg lives.
"How do you feel this morning, love?" John finally asked, turning his face to nuzzle at the crook of Fawnlock's neck and shoulder.
"Careful, John. Don’t let go of my hand, I don't want you the get lost." The Fae explained as he tugged John after himself.
Harry jumps when she sees her brother and whispers to the girl she'd be right back, winking. "What?" she asks once she's at the edge of the patio, looking at the two boys. 'Johnny is going to be gay, definitely.' She thinks.
Fawnlock huffed in acknowledgement, "Not just my tree John..." He starts to pad off into the wood, following paths and deer trails so familiar to the him. "My den." He murmured, holding back some branches for John. "It's a large hollowed oak... At least part of it is... It's rather small, but I'm rather fond of it." The fawn peered up at the sky, watching leaves fluttering the icy breeze, pulling his scarf tighter, he muttered something about winter ruffs before giving a slight huff, scenting the air, he could sense them, the birds.... Mycroft's sudden extra surveillance couldn't be a coincidence. John blinked and followed after Fawnlock, paying attention to his feet so he didn't stumble over half buried boulders and tree roots. Of course, that almost earned him a face full of branches, were it not for the fae holding them back. He flashed an appreciative smile up at the fawn and hurried past, bringing his gaze back up to pay better attention.
Fawnlock was a comfort to John just by being there. No matter what his sister thought and how she acted, didn't matter, because he loved the fae. He'd call her when they returned to their cottage. Maybe she'd even want to talk to Fawnlock on the phone. That conversation would be....interesting to watch/ listen to.
"Oh? Excellent, how advanced? Think they'll skip a few levels or just one?" Mycroft tucks Sherlock's work aside and places a blank piece of paper in front of him, he writes out the first question on the paper for Sherlock from his calculus work.
Mycroft watches the two boys, letting his hand fall from Sherlock's head.
Sherlock chuckles softly, smiling at his friend, "Thank you, John." He smirks slightly at his friend's visible blush, John was silly. The lift dings at John's floor, and Sherlock follows John out and down the hall.
John tilted his head up as the taller fawn nuzzled down against him. He smiled and chuckled, shaking his head. John didn't look regal, he would always look like a war worn soldier.
"/Fawnlock./" He supplied in return, a single sculpted eyebrow lifting skyward.  "/To what do I owe the pleasure of your company?/" Though he knew, he always knew. But he so preferred to hear his brother say it for himself.
Moosecroft tilted his head and considered Ms. Hooper. She'd been infatuated with Fawnlock, following him even to his wood. Until he had scared her off. She was so very shy and timid, as most of her type of fae was. She'd dabbled in the arts in hopes of taking care of the Prince, even though it was apparent he was not interested in that sort of relationship. He gave his brother a lazy blink and then looked down at John, who was watching the exchange with interest.
A small smile quirked the fawn's lips as he turned slightly to regard his mate, "I love you, John."  He responded in kind, tail flicking as he sought out his scarf and put it on before turning and gently opening the leather flap.
Sherlock chuckles, "Okay, then can we do the driftwood? I want John to see that!" He smiles and turns to his friend, "Do you know what happens when you burn driftwood, John?" He asks, taking a roasting stick that Winston hands each boy.
"Sherly has found him self a best friend." Mycroft says first, knowing that Sherlock might be too shy to say it himself.
"The museum we're going to had just gotten a new exhibit on bees!" Explain Sherlock excitedly, "It's that brilliant!"
John blinked slowly, the gears in his mind much more sluggish in the morning, but he was quite sure the fawn had been very suggestive just then. John cleared his throat and really tried not to stare too much at the long lines of Fawnlock's back as he stretched out and put the book away.
As he pulls away he blushes slightly, then looks around the room, taking it all in. A smile quirks his lips, "I like your room."
John felt the persistent tug on the waistband of his jeans and drew back, breaking the kiss. The fawn instantly surged forwards and clung to John, burying his face against John's neck. It was then more than ever did he realize just how alone Fawnlock had been.  So ancient and yet he'd never had someone to love him, hold him, want him like this. It made John's heart ache at the pure innocence of it all. Softly petting the fawn's dark curls, John leaned back, disentangling his arms from the fawn for only a moment so he could unfasten his trousers and push them down his hips.
"I don't see how he can ignore it. We're pretty good at advertising it." John hummed in content as the fawn nuzzled against him, just enjoying their time together now, lazy and happy, since he was quite sure it would be tense and uncomfortable once Moosecroft appeared. But Fawnlock was right. Everything would be alright. He was more than happy to lean back and suffer through the assault of kisses. Hands slid up to stroke his mate's sides in soothing patterns, reassuring him.
"Pretty." John says in awe, petting his finger over the shiny rock. "How come you know so much Sherlock? You're really smart." John spies a pretty multi colored piece of sea glass on the sand and picks it up. He turns his big blue eyes over to look at his curly haired friend. He holds up the sea glass to Sherlock's face and smiles. "It matches your eyes."
John didn't eat much meat himself, so their diets would work well together. As Fawnlock finished and wriggled closer to John, the blond laughed softly and kissed that smile, arms lifting up to stroke through the dark curls.
"Yum, you should try some of the soup, it's really good." He smiled softly, rolling his eyes at the fond behavior of the elder Fae, "She frets too much," he pursed his lips slightly, "We'll all be fine," he gave a soft huff of laughter, "but we can go see her soon, right?" He snuggled close to his mate, nuzzling at his jaw, damp nose sliding against John's skin.
Fawnlock rubbed his furred cheek against John's arm, he murmured softly in his native language, before speaking English, "I love you John, thank you for making a nest with me." He turned his head to press a kiss to John's skin.
"They said twenty minutes."  John puts the phone on the receiver and takes Sherlock's hand again.  "Let’s check on our Mystery Plant."
John smiles they look at Sirius and pets him, he looks at Sherlock confused, but side hugs him back as well.
With a slow twitch of his ears, Moosecroft regarded his brother as he spoke. The fawn was not prone to sentiment, yet that seemed to have completely changed with the arrival of John. It was good to see him smile so much, it was good to see him worried over someone. To see him care. He'd thought things had become irreparable between them; when their parents had died, the fawn had pulled into himself and Moosecroft hadn't known what to do.
The fawn nosed at John's ear, humming softly, "I like wearing your jumpers, they smell good. Like you, all warm and comforting. Like home." Murmured the Fae softly.
Fawnlock gave John a small apologetic smile, "I apologize John," he nuzzled at his mate's cheek and snuffled softly before he looked back to his brother, grimacing slightly.
"We're fine though," Sherlock adds, taking a firm hold of John's hand. He pulls him and John up from the table so they can leave quicker.
The Fae’s speckled digits massaged his mate's scalp, fingertips skimming the shell of John's ear. The fawn considered John's question for a few moments, fingers working through his mate's hair.
The door to 221B slammed shut, the lonely sound echoing through the cold flat.
John nods in agreement to his friend and puts the little creature back in the water. He watches as the little creature settles back into the water, starting at it for a few minutes before returning to Sherlock's side.
cozy," he compliment, sincerely wishing he had a place like this growing up. He turns to Greg. "I'd love to see your room." Mycroft is polite as ever, it is one of two of his default settings, the other one being manipulative and controlling.
"And thank you for taking such good care of my Johnny."
Here is Chapter 8 edited! Niko OUT!
The fawn worried his bottom lips between his teeth, head bowed as he helped spread out a quilt from one of the past layers. He titled his head slightly as he though, courtship was something slightly vague in his mind other that how it started, because of his maman's love stories, but the Fae dug in his mind for what Mycroft had  laid down once the young fawn had reached puberty.
John grinned as the fawn spoke French; it really was a lovely language, all grace and finesse compared to the guttural, harsh syllables of the English language. Maybe Fawnlock could teach him more French, and vice versa, he could help out with more English. Really he just wanted any excuse to spend more time with the beautiful, antlered creature. Of course, it would be selfish to expect him to give up precious time just to appease a retired old army doctor's wishes; he had an important job as guardian of the wood. But still, John would appreciate whatever time he did get to spend in the fawn's company. His eating had slowed to a crawl as he watched the other, who obviously was quite pleased with the meal from the adorable noises he was making. John eventually set an elbow on the table and settled his chin in his hand, just watching Fawnlock with such amazement and adoration on his face.
The fawn's ears flicked and dropped, twitching with the waves of pleasure he was riding as John gave them to him. His tail swished furiously behind him before his body tensed, his whole being stilled.
Sherlock runs up the stairs to his room and throws down his school bag, flopping down on his bed. After a few moments, he bites his lip and sits back up, grabbing his bag and unzipping it. He peeks into the bag and pulls out the samples he'd collected that day during recess. He allows a small smile to slip across his lips, mold was one of his favorite things to experiment on.
"What can I get to make the nest more comfortable for you? I can fetch your books from the den...get leaves or grass for you too. I want you to be comfortable in our home."
The only thing he really had any attachment to was his favorite armchair. He was sure Fawnlock would get a kick out of plastering bits of himself all over John's home, he already had been doing just that.
"Aye, John, let's go find that treasure!" He laughs before grabbing John's hand before they run off.
The fawn bit his lip once more, ears flicking and tail swishing with uneasiness.
"Okay." Winston clasps his hands, scooting close to the fire so that his face is shadowed. "Ghost stories... I'll begin. A long long time ago..." John listens intently, leaning into Sherlock just in case story got scary. Even Mycroft listens with a small smile on his face.
"Fawnlock...or Fawnlock, I love you. Love you so much."
"Moosecroft is just an idiot." He huffed loudly, settling his hands on John's waist.
Baking, of course was not something he'd done often, and his recipes were few and far between. Some quick bake sweet breads, cinnamon buns, and maybe a few other biscuits. It was a start though, enough to keep Fawnlock delighted until he learned more. And surely Mrs. Hudson could help with recipes. He probably had a few books in the cottage from his aunt as well they could sort through.
"Want to share fish and chips?" John asks with a soft smile, proud he remembered this about his best friend. Friend's are supposed to know and remember things like that- especially about their best friends!
Sherlock flinched, jerking away from John's gentle hands, fire in his eyes, "Promises can't always be kept, John." He muttered, eyes clenching shut.
John watched him walk across the thin blanket of snow that had settles in the garden, then shut the door and crossed over to his mate.
"Look at this coral, John!" He yells to the shorter boy. John stares at Sherlock in surprise. How did he know all that? His sister. The bullying. The move. How?
John glances at Sherlock as he is busying himself with his rug and is about to ask him what is so interesting when the delivery person knocks on the door. He unlocks the door but keeps the chain in place, opening it to check who is there.
For a sibling who had never cared about anything after the death of their parents, it was refreshing to simple see him care so much. Cool grey eyes widened in mild awe as the younger fae's rant continued, venom spitting from between his lips as his eyes lit with a wildfyre that Moosecroft could feel heating the whole of the den.
Closing the den back up, John made his way back home, eager to get back to his mate. It was still early afternoon when he made it back, the sun overhead melting the frost that had settled over night. John pushed open the back door to the cottage and trekked in, pulling off the pack and setting it down on a kitchen chair.
The Fae's ears twitched as he took another bite of his sandwich, chewing thoughtfully. "It's perfectly fine, I'm excited to know you more too. Humans are fascinating. My brother never taught me much about humans.." He took another bite, tail flicking as he finished the sandwich. He gave a content bleat after he was done, dusting his fingers. "Things only wear out their welcome when they become boring, and I doubt you'd ever get boring, John." The fawn bowed his head slightly.
"Might as well get it over with, yeah?" John grips Sherlock's hand firmly, needing some support. He never got along with his sister and he didn't exactly want to ask her to stay at Sherlock's house, she is so intimidating at times.
Mrs. Watson also observes Mycroft, there is something off about him. He is very mature, but.............. far too mature for his age.
Fawnlock had given his brother an irritated look when he made the comment about John's name, though it used to be true to the fawn, now he considered it one of the most beautiful names from the human's language.
"We're done,"  John announces to them.
Fawnlock head tilted as he watched John shed his layers of fabric. His eyes roved over the newly exposed skin of John's chest. He quirked a small smile before looking away.
"What was that, love?" He asked softly, pressing his lips against the long stretch of neck as he spoke, kissing the steady beat of the fawn's pulse.
The Fawn had circled the room several times, a few times in he'd started touching things gently, then he began to pick them up, weighting them in his hand, bright curiosity shinning through his pale eyes. He'd scented the air, the room and its things, brows furrowed slightly. He'd especially liked the books, he'd seen them before, Moosecroft had taught him things from them, he had some in his den as well, though they were old, books were rare in the Fae world. Fawnlock had flipped through one's pages and read what he could understand before putting it back and looking through another. When the smell of fresh cut vegetables hit his nose, he'd smiled and turned his head to examine the human, John as he cooked, a small smile gracing his lips. When John had come over he'd closed the book and turned to him, brows raised, head tilted slightly, he examined the mug, then sniffed it carefully before deeming it safe and taking it from John. He lifted it to his lips and took a small sip, the liquid was pleasantly warm and sweet, which Fawnlock absolutely loved. He made a pleased bleat, ears twitching as he took another gulp. Suddenly he remembered Moosecroft's words about being polite and he frowned slightly before speaking, "Thank you, John." Though he did appreciate the cup of delicious liquid, he just wasn't used to it.
"Make sure to stay warm while I'm gone, I don't want you to be frozen when I come back." The fawn hummed, a slightly amused smile quirking his lips, "The wood for the fire is over there." He pointed before cuddling back up.
boyfriend, I'd like the graciously accept.." Mycroft beams at Greg and squeezes his fingers lightly, trembling with excitement.
Sherlock frowns deeply, hugging John. He winces slightly at Harry's yelling, grip tightening on John. He doesn't know where to go, so he just sits on the tiled floor, dragging John with him.
"And I told you to be patient,
**EDIT**
It was so very good to wake up with the fawn in his arms and realize the whole thing hadn't been a dream. If anyone had told him months ago that he'd find himself courting a gorgeous, magical creature of the forest in the near future, he'd think they were absolutely daft. Yet here he was, doing just that. Fawnlock was so very affectionate, and John relished every bit of it. Every kiss was sweeter than the last. As the fae suddenly pulled back and asked if John was hungry, he considered for a fraction longer than was needed. It was lovely being snuggled up to the fawn, but he supposed they had to get out of bed sometime.
It'd been a long day, and really all he wanted was to crawl into their nest and cuddle until they drifted off into sleep. But he wasn't going to go tossing his...well his brother-in-law out when he was actually being decent and sweet, something he probably wasn't very often.
John looks over at Sherlock once he had settled in and smiles. His bee plushie is quite adorable and very fitting; why didn't Sherlock want him to see it? Oh well, no sense in dwelling on it... John closes his eyes and wills himself to sleep, only for his nightmares to find him.
"And honestly, it's a bit hot." He paused, searching for a word Fawnlock would better understand. "Arousing. Exciting." He slid his under arm up across the Fawn's side.
One of the Fae's hands gently brushed over John's stomach, the other sliding up his back, fingers tapping his vertebrae lightly.
"It's not a problem John, you're my best friend, it's my job to defend you." Sherlock's nose scrunches for a moment before he moves and wraps his arms around John.
The Fawn's ears flicked as he carefully tipped his head away from the human, his antlers were sharp and dangerous. He nodded as the human spoke, his gaze falling to what he was doing, going completely focused on the human's hand, yet still aware of what was going on around them. He hissed softly at the stinging liquid and bit his lip, he watched as the human rubbed some ointment into his skin. He nodded as the human spoke, "I'm supposed to do that," he muttered, bowing his head slightly, "Protect the creatures of the Wood, keep balance." He mimicked his elder brother.
As Fawnlock's lovely fingers wrapped around him, there was an almost instant relief of pressure, and he murmured sweet nothings up at his mate, chasing his lips for another kiss. It was less of a kiss actually, more of a long exhale that brought their lips together.
"Well then we'll go get it back. And anything else I may have missed. Alright?" He stood up, helping his mate up onto his feet as well. "I'll go get dressed and we can head out? I'll pack us a lunch and we can make a hike out of it. Bring some of those biscuits you love." He teased, kissing Fawnlock's cheek and then stepping out of the nest.
"Did you bring Bilbo for that? He should see some live bees in action," He whispers to Sherlock as the lift goes down.
He bleated softly before his looked up at John, blushing softly, "Well, yes, other than nest making, and well, coupling. There's gift giving, customary nuzzles and scent sharing. I can teach you the proper ways too... Then there's... And then there's the-" Fawnlock trailed off as he silently peered back down at his dark hands on the quilt, the fabric bunching in his grip.
The Fae's tail flicked, his ears dropping slightly as he moved close. Fawnlock moved and brushed the bushes with his fingers, thorns simply moving away from his specked digits. He carefully plucked a few berries from their branches and cupped them in his palm. He turned to John, out stretching his hand to him, "Here,"  As Fawnlock spoke and held out his hand, the blond dropped his gaze to the offered berries and blinked owlishly, then smiled and took the fruit, scooping them into his war worn hands and pressing one between his lips. The juices squirted over his tongue, sweet with just a slight tang. Wonderful. John looked wistful for a moment. The berries would make the most wonderful jam. John licked the juice staining his lips and carefully slid down to sit upon the soft littering of fallen leaves, staring at the arch and the wild roses. The whole thing was so beautiful, and John was fairly sure this wasn't something humans ever were allowed to glimpse often. How he had earned that privilege was beyond him. But he was so very grateful for it.
Sherlock smiles, "It was okay, I guess, we had to leave early, Mummy didn't feel well." He pouts slightly, rubbing his chin against Bilbo's fluff.
"Yes! " he says, a blush on his face, smiling.
John finished his own sandwich as the fawn talked, eyes widening a bit as he made the claim that John would never be boring. He coughed around his mouthful, swallowing the last bite and bringing his hand up over his mouth as he regained his composure. John only ever though of himself as average, ordinary. But here was the most magnificent creature he'd ever met telling him he wasn't boring. "I'll do my best to live up to your expectations." He said with a cheeky smile, brushing his fingers off on the knee of his jeans.
He opens the door, gesturing Mycroft inside, "Nothing fancy, just two bedrooms, an eat in kitchen, sitting room, and a loo." He gives a slightly shy smile. He steps insides after Mycroft, toeing off his chucks, "Your shoes if you could." He mutters softly.
"Hullo you two, did you enjoy the soup?" She asked softly as they drew nearer, the fawn nodded eagerly, looking to John with a soft and affectionate gaze.
As Fawnlock told his tale of being buried in the snow dredge, John blinked in surprise. "It snows that much in the wood? I'll have to collect much more tinder than I thought. Probably have to make a run into town a stock up on a few things as well in case I get snowed in." He really didn't have any idea how harsh the winter was this far north. He turned towards the fawn with a smile and nodded. "It's very sweet of her. She's lovely to care for you like that." He sat up a bit beside Fawnlock, tilting his head back to watch the smoke from the fire coil up towards the vent in the tree. He turned his attention back to the fawn, watching him stroke the quilt and snuffle into the scarf. "Its nice to have someone that cares about you." John said softly, reaching over and patting the fae's dark hand.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, "Mummy doesn't care, she just cares that we visit her." He sighs as his brother grabs his hand and pulls him towards the limo, he really just wants to be with John down at the beach.
The Fae bleated excitedly in agreement, his tail swishing from side to side as he searched for his rosin, dark hands dipping into the various baskets throughout the den before he finally found the lump of resin with a triumphant bleat. Soon the fawn was rosining his bow gently, ears twitching as he mentally prepared to play for his mate.
"I love you." He mumbled, voice muffled from where his face was buried against his mate's chest.
"My apologies John...it is more of habit than anything else. Regardless of who I send, it won't be for a while yet. Not until your bond had solidified, and when the gate has reopened after the harsh winter. It would do to have the poor girl trapped her when you eventually chase her off again."
John smiled at that, it would be lovely for them to have a ceremony. He really didn't have anyone that would come save for Harry. He didn't have many friends after the war, they were still all deployed. And he didn't think he would have inviting them here anyways. These woods, and the fae were something special and wonderful, and John didn't want to do anything to risk either one.
"I brought your things too. So now we'll have a proper home for both of us."
The fawn's damp lips trailed up his mate's delicious neck to meet his lips with John's. His ears flicked curiously, his unsoiled hand moving to stroke over his lover's shoulder. He broke the kiss to nuzzle at John's heated flesh, murmuring softly in his native tongue, weaving the words as his slightly damp nose trailed up the side of Johns's face to rub at the soft skin under his love's ear.
John shut the door. “You have that look on your face.” He said.
“That’s…. crazy!” John spluttered.
“De Chirico.” Mary said. “It’s called The Red Tower.”
“Birgit, Suki.” John called them forwards. “Get them moving, ok?” The group in the room looked exceedingly relieved to see the other Omegas. John overheard Birgit telling them, “The Alpha fought Dr. Mong and Doctor Morstan, and he won! He's taking us someplace safe.” John didn't know how to counter the misconceptions that he may have inspired. He left it, moving on to the next door, and then the next, letting freed Omegas help their fellows. Quite a few were sobbing with terror and hope.
“John...”
It was the sex dungeon Sherlock had seen on the surveillance video. He didn't allow himself to run directly to John as he wanted to, he looked around the room slowly, taking it all in, feigning mild interest.
"How is he?"
"Do you want some water?" John asked.
John dutifully pulled his hand out from under the blanket and presented it to her. She ignored the striping bruises down his arm and the bandages that covered the wounds on is wrist and focused on is fingers. She pinched his little finger.
“I shan’t sell myself at all.”
Sherlock closed his eyes and tried to pretend it was John's fingers skimming his skin. It helped a little. "Where did he sleep?" He asked.
It was mesmerizing, John loved the little moans Sherlock made as he worked himself open, the gasp as he bent his fingers to brush against his prostate. God, he WANTED this man! He had wanted him for so long!
“Mycroft... Mycroft isn’t the sort to bother with guilt. No, he knows what it’s like to worry about a sibling. He worried about Sherlock constantly... not that it made one bloody bit of difference in the end!” I took a deep breath, calmed myself. “He... I don’t know when he decided to keep an eye on Harry. This isn’t the first time he’s found her in trouble. He called last Spring to tell me she was in hospital. I dropped everything, went to help her – she lasted three days. Not even three days...”
Was it too much for him? What did he expect!? I am a MAN!
Bill consulted a clipboard with a thick sheaf of papers attached. He flipped through them. “Drowning? Yeah, I’ll pull ‘er out.”
"I need your help with him – during the trial... and potentially afterwards."
Afterwards, I let Mrs. Hudson guide me to the lobby. She stayed by my side, an anchor, and island. Something that I could hold onto in all the madness.
I'd told Walter I was taking the train, but Mycroft sent a helicopter - it was easier to go unnoticed. John's life depended on my remaining unnoticed.
Thank you all for following this story! I've enjoyed all your comments, questions and ideas. I look forward to Wednesdays now, like you wouldn't believe.
“Very quickly.” John said with a shy smile. “We met by chance and just… well… bonded. It’s good. Really good – he’s amazing. The things he can do. You wouldn’t believe how smart he is, proper genius. Yeah.”
The obituary didn't say how so young a man had died – no mention of accident or illness....
We landed on the helipad adjacent to Mycroft's home and I spent less than a minute in the open. As soon as I got inside, I dropped my bag and headed straight for the tunnels in the basement. I took the one that would get me closest to Baker Street.
I hadn’t handled an assault rifle in years. I’d HAD one. I knew how to use it, how to care for it. But I’d always preferred a handgun.
"Indeed. Tell me, Sherlock, tell me what triggered your relapse."
"Do you like to be fucked?" John asked, yanking on my cock. "Do you want my cock shoved up your arse?"
Two other Alphas faced her – a man in a suit and a petite woman in athletic attire. Neither looked like fighters, but then neither did the stocky female. But John knew all too well not to underestimate an Alpha, any Alpha, when their instincts were triggered.
John enjoyed the kiss, Shane was a good lover, very giving, but not afraid to take control either. Sherlock would probably have been a selfish lover, John reflected. He was selfish in almost every other way...
“Oh thank god!” John exclaimed as his knot ebbed and he was released. He flopped onto the mattress and stretched his limbs, his physical reprieve overcoming the sense of sadness and failure associated with Harry.
“Where’s John?” Lestrade asked peeling his coat off.
What would happen when Sherlock fell in love with someone who DIDN'T reject him? What would happen to me when he rekindled his relationship with Victor? Sherlock would go off and I'd be trapped again, trapped in unending, empty corridors.
John lay awake in the dark. After the talk in the hallway they'd made love – Shane had seemed happy to be able to comfort him that way and John had been grateful for both the distraction and for the sense of calm he felt after his climax. Lying in bed afterwards, spooning with Shane, John fell asleep.
John ripped his shirt off and shoved his jeans down. His cock was so hard! It was too big and heavy to stand upright, it bobbed out in front of him instead, the fat, damp head pointing at his mate. Sherlock strained towards it and John rubbed it across the Omega’s gorgeous lips.
"What happened while I was off adventuring yesterday?" I asked. I had a scratchy throat but John didn't comment. He related his conversations with Gereth and Victor and everyone's disposition at breakfast. Gereth's account of everyone's location when Sir Afan had died was especially interesting. I was starting to form a picture of what happened.
“All right. All right... but where I have to go... I can’t take you.”
“Come here.” John says and wraps his arms around me. “Tell me about your dream.”
"Turn around and bend over the couch." John commanded. Sherlock grinned and complied. John kissed the base of his spine, nipped his buttock, then as Sherlock spread his legs, John kissed the tightly puckered hole. Sherlock moaned. John used his tongue and Sherlock spread his legs wider, giving John greater access.
He turned to find the younger man staring at grey fingertips in horror.
“You said Vic and your brothers are here now?”
Sherlock turned to glare at him, but ruined it by coughing – a deep, grating cough that, at this point in his illness, sounded worse than it was. He muffled it with his handkerchief then wiped his nose.
“So you’ve seen a few punch-ups between doctors.”
"Do you have them?" He demanded when he reached the burly nurse.
“Indeed, it does.” She said, eyeing me suspiciously. “Go out the kitchen door here and it’s 30 meters to your left. You’ll see the path, it leads into the cliffs.”
“Beggar Your Neighbour.” I said.
I sighed again and slid down from my bunk, affecting bored irritation. Inside I was giddy.
Rabbit = Rabbit & Pork - Talk
“Can you ask Shane to come in?”
“Jim.” Sherlock said. “Jim Moriarty stopped by.”
Sherlock smiled grimly. “You aren’t. You’re doing me a favour. Trust me.”
"He's missing." Shane's voice lost some of its combativeness. He sounded plaintive. "I can't find him anywhere."
“I can get new ones when all this is over.”
I knew how amazing that felt, how revelatory. I wanted it for him. I wanted to be the one to give that to him. I stroked his knuckles with my thumb, tracing across his hand. Sherlock wouldn't meet my eyes, he stared fixedly at our hands, but as I continued to caress him, his guard slowly began to drop.
"Downstairs. I didn't want to intrude."
“I have...” My voice didn’t work. It was nothing more than a breathy whisper. I tried again. “I have to talk to Mycroft.” I said. My gorge rose and I coughed and retched some more causing stabbing pains in my belly.
“I will. Thank you.” I made my exit, dashing up the staircase to our rooms.
“I can’t pay.” I said without stopping, without looking at him.
John’s fingers tightened around my arm. I felt him kiss my head softly. “I killed them... it wasn’t fast. It wasn’t easy. I disarmed the guards, I used one as a shield and his fellows shot him. I used his gun to shoot the other two. Magnussen laughed – he actually laughed when I killed his thugs. He came at me. I could have shot him too, shot them both, but that was too good for them, too fast. I had three knives on me that hadn’t been found in the pat-down, and I used them all. They both fought, but they had created a monster. I stabbed Magnussen in the liver, then beat him to death... with my hands. It took... a long time... he was... still crying when I had brain matter on my fists.
I bowed my head in despair.
That fucking flu! It had kept us apart too long. I didn't know why Sherlock had changed his mind, and I doubted he would tell me.
“Fine.” Lestrade grumbled and began dousing himself in the suppressant from the blue bottle.
“I appreciate it, John. Even if nothing comes of it, I appreciate it. I already feel less alone.”
John had not stopped petting my head, but I could feel tension in his body – as he must have been able to feel in mine. “I thought you were dead, John! They must not have known what you meant to me. Or they thought it would break me, seeing you killed. And it would have soon enough – but they didn’t plan on my rage... I didn’t care anymore if they killed me. I didn’t care about the records or bringing down the organization. I cared about one thing: revenge. They had taken you from me. So I killed them.”
She waited silently for more.
"John... come home with me." Mariah had begged as we left the pub, tugging on my arm.
Lestrade looked at the faces around him. Molly looked happy. She had a new boyfriend that was neither a psychopath nor a Sherlock look-alike. “I’m a physicist.” He’d said when John asked. Sherlock had ‘tsked’ skeptically, and the man had laughed with good nature. Lestrade liked him.
“He’s really fallen for Greg, then.”
The showdown!
“How’s your sister? She must be bonded by now.”
“Fine. Whatever.” John stalked towards the produce and Sherlock followed with the cart.
“Serious?”
Church grabbed the I.V. stand and twisted it out of Shane’s hands. Now there was nothing between them, nothing to stop Church’s scalpel.
Shane held up the letter – it had John's name written on it in Sherlock's elegant hand. "Yeah. Could you bring it?" John couldn't touch it, not yet.
I stared. "Why?" I asked. "Why now?"
“Don’t the police... or your homeless network?”
“Fuck, I want you
“Correct Holmes.” He replied archly.
“I’d been so arrogant ... so certain that I had this right! But I had it completely wrong. They took their time rubbing that in, making sure I knew all the errors in judgment I’d made, how easy it had been to trick me, to trap me...
Depressed, Sherlock returned to his lodgings. Instead of staying in one of his bolt holes, he had taken a room in a pensioners' hotel. He liked the neighborhood, it was far from his usual haunts and there were a dozen charity shops where he could acquire new disguises. Years ago he had considered having a bolt hole here, but he hadn't found a suitable place. He'd always kept the area in mind.
He hoped it was Moran. He didn't want to watch Madam Dusette kill another henchman. That had been bloody unpleasant. He just wanted her to kill Moran quickly, preferably when he wasn't looking, so he could leave this horrible place forever.
For the first time, Sherlock considered what seducing Sebastian Moran would mean. Sherlock had had sex once with the only person he'd ever desired. To go from that to being strapped down spread eagled on a table or cross – or to the bench attached to the fucking machine! – and allow this stranger to do whatever he wanted to him... for a second Sherlock quailed.
But Sherlock shrank from them, backing into the hall. “No... no! Not now...”
We drank. It WAS good to see him. As he brought back our third round, Greg nudged me.
“That you grew up on the outskirts of London, your accent gives you away. Obvious. That you were able to control your base instincts whilst surrounded by raging Alpha testosterone, told me that you’d had long practice. The way you treated me revealed that you are sympathetic to Omegas. You’ve spent a lot of time with an Omega. Not a parent, he or she would be bonded if you were their child, so a sibling that you’ve looked out for his whole life.
"He wasn't oppressing a woman, in any case." I said dryly.
Ianto handed me a hat, and I pulled it over Sherlock's soaked curls, then pulled the windbreaker’s hood over it. It took long minutes to get Sherlock fully into the coat and fasten it up, Victor holding Sherlock’s cloth coat over him, sheltering him from the worst of the storm, the whole time. I wrapped the space blanket around his waist, covering his legs to the knee, then we got his sodden wool coat on over the windbreaker. He was soaked through, but the windbreaker would keep his body heat in and the wool coat, wet as it was, would provide some warmth.
“Wet leaves. It seemed appropriately disgusting.”
It was petty this – counting the seconds, the minutes, the hours that Shane spent with John. He didn’t tally his own time with John, he just enjoyed it. He didn’t compare the time they each got with John, but Sherlock resented every second given to Shane. He knew it was stupid. Resenting John’s boyfriend would only hurt John. And himself. And Shane was GOOD for John. There was no reason to resent him.
I tried hooking up a few weeks ago. I feel so desperate for sex, for physical release... I found myself closing my eyes and imagining it was John touching me. But I knew it wasn’t him. He didn’t SMELL like John. I didn't want the anon hands pulling at my clothes, grabbing at my prick.
"I meant in relation to your recovery, William."
"You were right." Shane said softly.
If only the desire for heroin didn't sing so insistently in my blood...
John’s door finally opened after 29 minutes thirty-eight seconds. Both Shane and John came out, holding hands and murmuring together. They walked past Sherlock to the door and he heard them kissing.
I should have. My imagination supplied no end possibilities, each less palatable than the last.
I had intended to make an early night of it. But somehow, I found myself staying later and later. Mike seemed taken with Mariah, happy to have her drinking with us – and she kept the pints coming. At some point we switched from beer to whisky...
Then I wiped shortening from my own cock and hands – it was greasy and stubborn and I quickly gave up on it and spread the towel beneath us.
Mycroft didn’t want to dwell on the implications – and complications – that would create.
It wasn't until John was beginning to pass out from the pain that Moran stopped - as abruptly as he'd begun. John was hoarse from screaming, sweat and tears and snot covered his face. He knew he would never leave this room alive and he was beginning to long for death - for anything that would stop this agony.
Sherlock sighed. "I had a friend at University. And there's The Woman. I... I had – have – feelings for both of them."
“I hadn’t. Just Beta sex. Oh, please John,” Sherlock said rolling his eyes. “I thought you didn’t have double standards. Beta sex is fine for Alphas but not me?”
There was no doubt now that Moran was holed up here.
"Yes." I told him. "Not to worry." I picked myself up with an assist from Lady Anwen.
We finished the chips and walked towards home.
“I would have waited for you.” John said. “If you’d just... one word, Sherlock. That’s all I would have needed. One word.”
“Ok.” Sherlock felt John bristling once again – this was taking too long.
Sherlock nodded and allowed John to pull him down. He laid his head on John’s chest, tangled their legs together and drifted off as John combed his fingers through his dark curls.
"Not really."
SHERLOCK
“If that’s what you believe, why did you throw him in my path?” Sherlock could see he was angry, and trying to mask it with irritation.
Sherlock picked up a glass of the juice. “Can you hold it? No, not yet. Here.” Sherlock helped John sit more upright and then held the glass to his lips. “Drink it all.” He said, wishing they had a straw. He was making a hash of feeding John the juice, tilting it too far or not enough, spilling it down his chin. But John didn’t complain.
“I’ll be fine.” Sherlock lied, loving John even more. How could love be so boundless? How could it take up every part of him and still grow? “Once you’re out, you can gather the cavalry.”
I finished unbuttoning my shirt and flung it aside, pulling my vest over my head. "Take your pants off." I told him.
They had continued talking. The more used to the idea John got, the more he liked it. Why SHOULD it be John's responsibility?
“Shut up, Sherlock,” Kennick said with a grin, pulling him into a headlock and rubbing his knuckles aggressively through Sherlock’s curls. Sherlock sighed heavily and rolled his eyes. “What made you decide to join up again?” Kennick asked.
“Sounds excellent. See you later, Watson! Glad to have you back.”
Occasionally, however, his words dripped with frustration.
“Wow, that’s great, Molly!” John smiled. He and Molly had met during his first round of anatomy before he was deployed mid-term. Her announcement stirred a feeling he couldn't quite place. It seemed wrong that his life had paraded ahead without him, that his classmates were graduating and taking up careers. Walking around the campus had given him the illusion that nothing had changed, that he had traveled back two years ago when things still felt open and new and full of possibility.
he thought again.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” Sherlock asked, looking John directly in the eye.
call this number again, or I will have you blocked.” The door slammed behind him as he left the building.
d morning,” came a deep voice, as if on cue. John looked around to see a tall, thin man standing next to Lestrade.
!” came an angry voice from behind him. Phillip, was it?
“Oooooh! John!” called a small voice, running over to him. Molly Hooper had him in an embrace before he knew what hit him.
potential in our boat, otherwise he wouldn’t bother wasting his time sitting in the coxswain seat. Anyway, thanks for coming, and I’ll see you tonight for ergos.”
“Your stroke is very good, especially considering you haven’t been in a boat in years. I can see that your shoulder injury still limits your rotation, but a small amount of concentration on engaging the musculature of the lower back will keep your posture strong enough that you can avoid slouching into the catch.”
The fawn had carefully moved from John's lap before he stood. As the human left, Fawnlock arched his neck to watch him as he scurried off into the depths of the cottage. The fawn looked around as he waited for John to return.
"I've never known true happiness until I met you." John murmured.
Sherlock peers down at the problem Mycroft set up for him, "I can try it by myself." He leans over to start the problem, pencil to paper. After a minute or so, Sherlock sets his pencil down. He looks up to his brother, "How's that?" He asks, giving his brother a little smile.
John smiles and adds the next piece, following the booklet the way Sherlock is.
The Fae's lips curled in a smile, nipping the human's thumb gently before drawing their hands away from his mouth. After giving a small smirk, Fawnlock brought their hands back toward his mouth. He brushed John's knuckles across his lips one last time before letting their hands fall. John chuckled with the playful little nibble, but the sly smile and sweet little kisses stole away his breath.
The elder Fae tittered softly with a small smile on her lips, "Aren't you two a pair?" She chuckled, returning John's hug. "It's alright dear, our Prince needs you."
Fawnlock pressed another kiss to John's cheek, then another on his nose, "Thank you John, it was very good." His ears twitched as he cuddled close to his mate.
Greg offers him a dashing smile, "As your boyfriend, I'd like to ask you on a proper date."
John was always in awe of the fawn. He stood taller than John, armed with powerful antlers and a magic deep within those silvery eyes. Yet still there was a fragile aspect to him that John could see, and would spend his life protecting.
The fawn adored the colour of his mate's eyes, they were a deep blue, like the sparkling rivers and babbling brooks from the wood of his childhood, reflecting the beautifully endless sky.
After several seconds the Fae nodded, "I'd like that, though, I believe my antlers would provide some trouble.." He murmured into the wool covering his love's torso.
"It is, but in the end, after all that which they've gone through he builds up the courage to confess and learns they feel the same. You may never know what you do not know until you ask is the lesson to be had.  To find the courage to pursue your desires..."  Mycroft swallows thickly, staring at Greg as he realizes what he is doing and blushes, looking down at the book, fingers gripping the book.
The fawn wrapped his arm around John as he stepped near, the fawn nuzzled at his mate's jaw in greeting as he spoke to his brother. The fawn have a slightly exasperated huff, and looked up to press a kiss to his mate's cheek, then turned to gaze at Moosecroft.
As he looked down at Fawnlock, his face looked absolutely ashen and crestfallen at the idea of being sent away. John would have crumbled. He was a strong man, but losing the love of his life would devastate him beyond repair.
"Mousey merely needed time to get over her one sided infatuation. Perhaps seeing you and John will be what she needs to get over it."
John let himself be pushed about however Fawnlock liked, happy to be at his mercy beneath the bliss of those fingers. He was quite glad to be rid of his pants, the fabric having become uncomfortably tight.
Fawnlock pressed back into John's hands on his back, bleating softly. He wriggled slightly as his mate's fingers buried into the fur at the base of his tail, scratching lightly, the fawn bleated softly, knees weakening slightly, and apparently he was very sensitive there.
Sherlock nod excitedly, "Yeah, and I could bring out my star book!" He chuckles. After a few moments, he notices the sound of feet behind them. He tugs on John's hand and stops. He turns and spots the older boy. The taller boy already knows the possible outcome, recognizing the older boy as a bully among the older classes.
John peeled back the leather flap and watched the fawn walk off towards the gate until all he could see was the darkness of the night. It felt like a part of him was missing now that Fawnlock was gone, but it really was only a short while. He could bare it. Heading back into the den, he glanced up at the smoke hole in the ceiling, where the first flakes of snow where drifting down, only to melt before they reached the floor of the den. He hoped it wouldn't be too cold for Fawnlock. With a hum, he went to his pack and dug out the metal thermos of tea, bringing it over to the fire and tucking it beside the flames so it would heat up the liquid within. Reaching in further, he found one of the jam sandwiches he'd packed as well, unwrapping it and munching on it as he flipped through some of the pages of books inside Fawnlock's nest. There was a faint chill, but nothing uncomfortable. If he had been burrowed under the quilts it would be quite cozy. But he had no plans on falling asleep until the fae was back and in his arms.
"/I'd never banish you. You're all I have left, you idiot./" He continued out into the glowing wood, trusting his brother would follow once he got over his initial shock.
Mrs. Hudson nodded as John spoke, taking the pouch with a small smile and worried eyes.
After a moment he puts two and two together, the taller boy turns to John, "John, I think they're assuming we're 'boyfriends'... And that we.. threaten them in some way.." He puts another piece in play, frowning slightly.
The Fae's hands lowered to skim over his mate's shoulders and down his arms to take John's hands in his larger ones. Fawnlock brought John's hands to his mouth, brushing kisses over his knuckles, "I haven't made flower crowns or chains in years, but I remember, perhaps I can teach you once spring comes to the wood." His speckled thumbs brushed over the backs of his mate's hands, smoothing the skin with a find smile before he lowered John's hands to press a kiss to his mate's lips once more. Fawnlock nipped at John's bottom lip lightly before pulling away with a soft smirk, long eyelashes fluttering slightly as leant forward to nose at John's cheek.
"Come on, My! We're waiting for you! Winston said we can't start it unless you're here!" Sherlock tugs on his brother's arm dragging him off the patio and towards the fire ring, which John's sitting by. He plops down next to John before turning to him, "I got him, now we can start the fire!"
Sherlock nods, helping steady his friend "It's fantastic, a nice view to look at while I think." He smiles. His eyes sweep over the view with a fond curve to his smile. He squeezes John's hand, that he's still holding.
Greg nods, "that'll be great, I can drive you there and to yours after if you'd like," he gives a brilliant smile, shifting his back pack on his shoulder.
Sherlock's gaze flickers to the other boy and huffs in acknowledgment before he goes back to examining the crab, cupping it in his hands before settling it back carefully. He stands and wades out of the pool, ignoring the other boy. And picks up his sneakers and makes his way to the next pool. As he kneels down to pick up an interesting bit of coral Mycroft's words from earlier that month come back to him, about making friends. Sherlock rolls his eyes at himself, what a ridiculous idea, I don't NEED friends.
"/Fine, I suppose it could be useful, as long as it isn't Anderfawn, he's an idiot, and I don't want him in my wood./" The younger Fae grumbled softly in his native tongue.
"Just water, please." Sherlock squeezes his friend's fingers before letting go, taking the flatware the other took out, "I'll set the table if you get drinks." He tells John, smiling, usually, he'd never offer to do something like set the table, but he didn't want John to be doing all this stuff for him, he didn't like it, at least not with John.
"Will you play something for me? And I'll make us a bit of lunch and we can have something of a picnic."
Sherlock pouts slightly, "It's okay, as long as she feels better." He hands Winston his pack with a small smile and climbs into the limo before his brother, "But at least I'll get to see John soon."
"Yay! Thanks, Myc!" John squeals happily, clinging to Sherlock's hand.
John was lost between focusing on the kisses and licks pressed to his neck and the hand on his prick. Fawnlock was making him see stars, the pressure on his neck making him cry out and clutch the fawn tighter to him.
Greg blushes faintly as Mycroft comments on his car, the teen gives a soft chuckle as he climbs into the driver's seat.  He starts the car and waits for an opening in the flow through the parking lot. A small frown mares his handsome face as he turns to look out the rear window.
Sherlock had put on a documentary on bees. It isn't long before John dozes off. Soon Sherlock dozed off as well, head leaning on John's
The young Fae's eyes twinkled slightly, though a soft blush could be seen spreading over his cheeks through the downy fur there.
Sherlock narrows his eyes at John saying the word "miracle" but nods and picks up his paperback, eyes on John as he moves to his seat, taking note of where it is. As the teacher starts up a new lesson, Sherlock huffs and starts to read once more, already finding the lesson boring. Several times his eyes dart to where John sits and rare soft smile graces his lips as he watches his friend before his gaze slips back to his book.
"Thank you, John." The fawn mumbled softly, wrapping his arms around John and nuzzled into his neck, snuffling softly.
"How about... Ah...Sirius? Like the star?"
After a fair amount of cuddling and kisses, and those soft murmurs in a foreign language that sounded like music to John's ears, the fae was perking up and scenting the air. He had a much better sense of smell than John did, so the man was prone to trust his judgment.
Sherlock follows his friend faithfully, tilting his head at John's words, "I'm sure, I'll call him after dinner though."
"Walk me out?" He asks, shouldering his pack, and leading John out of his room and to the foyer.
"Your brother?" He asked as the fawn's hand closed around his and they began walking at a brisker pace than before.
Mycroft looks down at Sherlock with a smile, his hand still digging around for his mechanical pencil in the bottom on his bag. "Calculus, want to try one of the problems when you've finished your maths? It is quite simple really." Mycroft has no doubts that Sherlock would be able to do the calculus problems he is studying. Hell, the only reason why he is doing it is that it is part of the final grade, doing the study packet.
"I'm coming," Mycroft says for the millionth time that morning. He walks up to the counter with his personal credit card (entrusted to him by his mother and Winston)
The fae’s chatter, which John had been enjoying didn't last very long, for soon the fae was bolting up, excitingly alerting John to the existence of an instrument. John blinked in surprise; he hadn't known that Fawnlock played anything. Before John could even comment on it, his mate's face fell, distraught over the fact his violin had been left behind. Well John could fix that. He smoothed a hand over a drooping ear, then chucked under Fawnlock's chin.
The corner of the fawn's lips curves as the he gave a small smile, "It shouldn't be much trouble, John." His ears twitched, he moved to curl up slightly on the couch, feet tucked under his bum and his tail flicked. He hummed softly as he took up his tea once more, bringing it close to his face, nose twitching slightly. "It's starting to get colder out, the dark's coming earlier," He said wistfully, he'd always admired the spring more than the other seasons. He turned his head to look at the human, head tilted slightly, "Winter's coming... Your first winter here."
The Fae buried his face into John's neck, "Even if I live a life of solitude, away from my kind, save the Fae that venture to and live in my wood, I am still under my brother's rule. He is King, though I have some authority as Prince, I can only ignore his orders and rule to an extent." Fawnlock nosed against John’s neck, letting his love's scent calm him slightly.
**EDIT**
The fawn's ears flicked back and forth as he listened to his mate speak in his language, the corners of his Cupid bow lips quirk up in a pleasant smile. Fawnlock bleated softly at the barrage of kisses, and cheeky tail grab.
Sherlock happily scoots close to John to cuddle and read. Though his head snaps towards Mycroft as he speaks with Mrs. Watson about the rugby player who'd helped him and John.
The more he undulated and moved against John, the more the blond realized that he was going to have a hard time keeping this bath innocent. As it was, he was getting aroused the more the fawn wriggled his bum and flicked his tail against John's lap. With a hum, John slid his hands down to scritch at Fawnlock's ears, slicking them with soap as well. The fawn gave a soft bleat as John played with his velvet soft ears, the sensitive tips shivered slightly as John stroked suds up them.
His blush darkened and his tail twitched slightly, "Well, uh- yes, it does, I-I don't know much about.. That aspect of courting, but yes, ejaculate is one of the strongest sources of scent, it's one of the most potent substances a being can produce, other than urine."
John watched the fawn make himself comfortable by the fire, laughing as the water drops hit his cheek. Realizing how cold the fawn was, John pulled off his coat and draped it over his shoulders, which the fawn pulled tighter around him, giving a soft bleat as John gave him a reassuring kiss on the cheek before he stood to go make some tea for them both. Nothing warmed someone up quicker.
"I love you Fawnlock. Endlessly."
"Of course," John smiled and drained a sip of the tea himself, looking out into the flickering flames of the fire.
Mycroft puts his pen down on top of his homework and nods.
John could feel the timid press of Fawnlock's tongue against his and knew it was a new experience for the fawn, who'd only just learned what kissing was days before. But if anything, he was a quick learner, and the kiss was better than he could have ever imagined.
"We are mates, and will always be." He murmured softly, laying his palms out on the tabletop, just as the kettle whistled.
Mycroft looks down at their intertwined fingers and smiles before he looks up at Greg again.  That smile... it makes his knees weak... "As
After a few moments of kissing, they pull apart, Mycroft looks down at Greg, pressing his forehead to his.
Sherlock uncaps the liquor and grabs a stool for John. He leans as much as he can, pouring the alcohol into the sink. He moves away with a scrunched nose he didn't like the smell of liquor very much.
"..." Mycroft opens and closes his mouth, looking out the window at all the commotion around them.  People trying to leave all at once, making Mycroft wonder why they bothered to leave so quickly.
Sherlock strides over the sand and towards the pools. After he hits the stones he stops at large pool and takes off his shoes and ties the laces together, setting them at the pool's edge.
"Perhaps tomorrow I can come back with an axe and wheelbarrow. And a shovel to dig out most of the stump. It'll be a lot of work, but it'll be worth to for enough wood to keep us warm through the winter." John turned and looked at the fae, eyebrows furrowing just a tad with worry. "You will stay the winter with me, won't you?"
Sherlock grins softly and tugs on Mycroft's sleeve until his brother crouches to his level. The younger boy presses a quick kiss to his brother's cheek, whispering quietly; "You're the best big brother." He then moves back to the hive with John, excitedly watching the bees.
"Only read a million times!"  John rushes over to his bookcase, pointing out all the books on his shelf.  He has all of the novels and they all appear to be worn and well loved.
John tugged the fawn closer, draping half of the lanky body across his. This was his home, his family. It wasn't perfect, but it was his, and he'd never want anyone else. He sleepily kissed his mate, fingers lazy as they rubbed at the fae's lower back.
"What do you want to order? " he offers the menu to Sherlock.
With a soft laugh, John pet the side of the fawn's hip and then moved his hands down to unfasten the button and zip, and then dragged his hands away again, letting his mate take back over. He'd had his fun exploring Fawnlock's body last night, so he was content to let the overeager fawn do the same to him. He imagined it wouldn't be long before Fawnlock would be banishing clothing all together once it got warmer.
"I wanna see if they have anything on cheetahs."
John stared into the eyes he adored so much and nodded, rubbing the base of the velvety ears he held in his hands. "Oh God, yes. Please." He nuzzled against the mouth nipping at his jaw, sighing out a low exhale before kissing back, pressing his lips against the speckled cheek and kissing every freckle he could find in the pale brown fur.
Sherlock nods, "Yeah, he's pretty cool, but he barely plays with me anymore.." Sherlock sighs softly, taking John's hand and pulling him back into the sitting room.
"I'm glad you like him, the cage for him is in a box set aside, already set up for him. What do you think we should name him?"
The fawn's ears flicked, regarded the wound before bowing his head to press a gentle kiss to the red skin. He murmured softly in his native tongue, then when his gaze flickered up to John's, he blushed softly and translated, "Gentle protector be blessed."
He let the outside of the thermos cool while he fished out two plastic camping mugs from the bag, then poured the soup into them to be sipped out like a drink. He pulled out some wrapped chunks of bread as well, then brought their picnic lunch over to his mate, holding out the mug with a smile.
John grinned at that, he rather liked seeing the fawn in his clothing as well. There was something very intimate about a lover sharing your clothing. But this was even more. They were two completely different creatures, yet John was somehow good enough, had somehow managed to be the one Fawnlock wanted.
The fawn panted softly, he didn't fully understand what John was doing, all he knew was that his mate was doing something absolutely wonderful with his lovely mouth. John's warm breath ghosting over his sensitive skin, it felt as if there were velvet flames licking inside his belly. A hand firmly keeping the Fae's hips from bucking, tongue flicking over the head of his cock, Fawnlock whimpered softly and tried not to writhe under his love's ministrations.
Fawnlock’s cuddling was more than alright with the blond. John hummed and wrapped his arms around Fawnlock's waist, holding him back against his broad chest and resting his chin on the fae's shoulder.
"Hello, Mycroft." He gives a small smile.
The rugby player gives a smile, flushing slightly, "Not a problem, just making sure they're okay, they had a bit of a run in with a bully." He pushes from the table and ruffles a hand through Sherlock's curls, who gives him a slightly annoyed look, which Greg chuckles at.
Niko here! I'm the other writer DUH XD, I'm also the primary editor. She's the drawer, I'm more the grammar nazi
"You're the most adorable, lovely thing I've ever laid eyes on," he said softly, kneeling down just enough to they were face to face. "I do anything you wanted, you know? I'm hopeless for you." He was quite sure the fawn already knew it, but some things were nice to be said out loud. Kissing his mate on the cheek.
The taller boy purses his lips in thought, steepling his fingers by his chin. After a few moments he tilts his head, "I'm not really sure what I should name him." He looks to his friend, "What do you think, John?" Sherlock gives a smile.
The Fae frowned slightly, before he turned to John with a soft smile, "Tea, and then..." his brows furrowed in thought as he tried to find the right word, he muttered softly in his native tongue before his ears flicked up, perking slightly.
"Yes," The fawn practically hissed, "He's overstepping boundaries, he promised to not send any raptors to watch over me. Yet Mrs. Hudson's owls have been having problems with falcons for the past few weeks. I allowed a few, sometimes extra eyes helps keep watch but this is too much, they're starting to take owls' nests." he huffed, his ears twitching with irritation. John couldn't help but wonder if the reason Moosecroft was sending more spies was because a human was now living in the wood. Because of John. He wondered if they had already told the older fae that that very human was who his brother had been spending his time with. Not that he worried, he would defend their relationship no matter what.
His ears twitched as he considered John's idea, a crease forming between his slight furrowed brows. After several minutes of intense thought and uneasy tail swishing, the fawn locked gazes with John and nodded, a small smile curving his lips.
Pour a little salt we were never here,
"I'd love to!" John exclaims and gets up his feet, dusting himself off well.
Mycroft tries to reach out and touch his brother's curls again, but the seven-year-old flinches a bit. "Just think about it, Sherlock. I'm hoping that next year will be better."
Moosecroft could feel the anger crackle in the air between them before his brother even opened his mouth. While he had been expecting an argument, he hadn't expected Fawnlock to be so passionate about his choices.
John looks up at Sherlock in awe, simply impressed by the boy two years younger than him and yet 100 times smarter than him. At that thought, John looks down sheepishly. "You must think I'm really simple minded if that's what you like to do...." He feels stupid for saying that, but if they are being honest, he doesn't want to lie now.
Who will fight?
As the kettle began to whistle, John pushed up out of his chair, pressed a kiss to the crown of curls a top the fawn's head and went to take care of the tea.
(See the end of the chapter for
HOW MANY TIMES DID WE USE: 'Small smile' or the word smile or hand holding? XD
The fawn settled himself in John's lap, resting his dark palms on his shoulders. Speckled fingers squeezed gently as Fawnlock bleated softly at John's lips under his chin. A shiver ran up the Fae's spine, the rumbling in his chest growing louder as he leaned into the human. Fawnlock murmured something low in his native language, a hand moving into John's sandy hair. The fawn's eyes fluttered closed as he bleated once more, his tail swishing and his ears twitching.
"O-Okay Captain!" John sniffles and swallows hard, forcing his tears down and smiles a watery smile as Sherlock touches his face.  He, in turn, wipes Sherlock's tears.
His gaze met John's, "I'd like to, if you'll have me." The Fae tilted his head up to stare at the tree's few and bare branches, then bowed his head once more to scan the particular part of the forest and it's dying trees.
As the kiss broke and once again air filled his lungs, John's tongue darted out over his lips, tasting the remnants of saliva left from their kiss. Fawnlock may have no real experienced, but John could have never known that from the passion he poured into the embrace. He pushed against the fawn's forehead, nuzzling him back as his gaze dropped once more to the wild thrusts of their hips, and wet slid of their pricks between the circles made from their hands.
John frowns up at her, squeezing Sherlock's hand.
Winston smiles at the young boys and hands Sherlock one of the tubes and removes the last few sheets of paper towel from the other and hands it to John.
John held his breath as the door opened, but he let it out with a happy sigh as he saw the woman within. The feathers in her hair and along her form were lovely really, and he happily stepped in, watching her bustle about the cottage like any other grandmother. As the cabin lit with the soft candle light, he gazed about, fascinated by the home and its owner. "Oh..Hello Mrs. Hudson. It's good to meet you too. Here...these are for you." He gave a sheepish smile as he held out the bouquet of flowers he'd picked. He blinked, her first words finally sinking in. Fawnlock's human? Well, he supposed he wasn't going to argue it. "Ah..I'm uh..John. John Watson." He shifted awkwardly, feeling just slightly out of place in this world of fantastic creatures.
"I'm Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock wrings out the hem of his tee shirt, "my brother and I are here on vacation as well." His gaze narrows slightly as he looks back up to John, "You don't like it here very much, you're bored.." He deduces quietly, "Though you still think it's pretty, you don't have much to do." It wasn't the hardest to figure out, John was an easy read so far. John blushes and looks away. How did he know that?
Sherlock smiles brightly, letting go of John's pinky and leaning forward to wrap his arms around John the best he can.
Fawnlock had felt John's thoughts and worries through their bond, he pouted slightly. Dark palms moved over his mate's jumper, fingers curled into the knitted weave, pulling John closer into a warm embrace. Fawnlock breathed in his mate's scent, eyes fluttering closed as he tried to comfort his mate. Soon, the young Fae sighed softly and tucked his chin against John's shoulder, careful of his antlers, before his eyes flickered open once more. The fawn nuzzled at John's neck, the rumbling strengthening as he stayed cuddled close to his mate.
"Yes...lovers are something like mates. Though I think mates are much more than mere lovers. Humans sometimes have many lovers in their life time. Having a mate would be more like a a marriage, a family. Lovers can become mates, though it isn't always about procreation. But it is about love." John smoothed his fingers back down over Fawnlock's ears, petting the soft fur with a soothing flick of his fingers.
"Head wounds always look worse than they really are. If it was serious...you wouldn't be this coherent." John gave a twitch of a smiled and moved the gauze away and inspected the gashes on Fawnlock's chest, they were deep, but he had a few bottles of liquid stitch that would work better then sewn stitched and leave less of a scar.
The Fae's tail swished as the fawn pulled up to meet gazes with John, a soft smile painting his plush Cupid bow lips, his inquisitive eyes drank in the sight of his mate's beautiful post-coital face.
After a few minutes as they're walking out the high school he speaks, "You like him.." He states plainly, smirking when John giggles at his comment and squeezes his hand.
The fawn drew closer, ears twitching with curiosity, letting his dark palms and speckled fingers skim down John's bare back. The Fae gave a soft bleat as he bowed his head once more to nuzzle under John's ear and down his neck with his damp nose. A soft smile curled Fawnlock's lips as the rumbling continued and the fawn lifted a hand to slip back into John's hair. He bleated softly, nipping at the human's neck softly.
"We'll be best friends forever Captain, don't you forget it." John beams at his friend and the strokes Sirius gently.
Sherlock pouts slightly before letting his hand drop slowly to the grass, allowing the spider to crawl away, "I don't want to scare it." He murmurs, standing, "Whenever I bring insects, spiders or any other creatures home, Mary throws a fit, she thinks they'll get into her kitchen." He scoffs softly, "So Mycroft makes me release them. Sometimes I think he's afraid I'd hurt them on accident... I really like the different creatures you can find outside," he explains, "I'd never hurt anything though, not on purpose,"
John rose an eyebrow, he wasn't going to go off running like some unruly child. But these were magical woods, so who was he to assume it was anything so petty. So he nodded, clutching at Fawnlock's hand as they made their way into the forest.
The Fawn spent the rest of the morning gathering berries, fruits, and catching fish, gathering it all in a basket, for Mrs, Hudson, the older Fae always asked him to do so every once in awhile, since she didn't go outside during the day. He huffed softly before noticing the position of the sun in the sky, thinking he should start back, the fawn padded back into the woods from the small wild orchard he'd cultivated long ago. The Fawn obviously knew the way by heart, but still the owls still escorted him, one even flew down to land on his arm when he'd held it out. He caressed a finger over its downy feathers, the owls had always been the most accepting of him, most likely because of Mrs. Hudson, but honestly the fawn didn't mind. He let the owl flutter off, and continued, eager to see John. Fawnlock could already smell the pie and sweets that the older Fae baked frequently, giving a happy bleat, the fawn moved faster through the forest, though he doubted he'd get there before John, who'd probably have left earlier than he.
He nipped at John's nipple lightly, "You shouldn't muffle yourself John, I love the sounds you make."
Mrs. Hudson smiled softly and beckoned them forward in the dusky evening air as the owl flapped away. Fawnlock grinned softly at the elder Fae, bowing his head slightly as they approached.
The fawn's ears twitched when John's fingers touched his knee, his gaze went back to the human, though he'd been watching him from the corner of his eye. "Nothing, really, I started out early today to finish Mrs. Hudson's errands before noon. I just have my rounds before the witching hour." The fawn's tail flicked, taking another long sip from his tea before settling it down, and examining the sandwiches. He picked up one and started to munch contently. "And you, John?" He asked after he'd swallowed, ears twitching.
“After recent head trauma, he’s been instructed to avoid all contact sports, so rugby is out. Perhaps you lot might have a chance at the cup after all,” Sherlock said with a smirk, looking pointedly at Anderson.
Your aristocratic elitism is simply repulsive. I am off to my lectures, now do
“How…?”
They quickly caught him up on the happenings back at Oxford and Exeter- the sports updates, drama in Mike’s relationships, Greg’s third change in advisor, and Molly’s verbal altercation with the anatomy professor. They laughed and smiled, and John felt the weight on his shoulders lift, if only for a moment.
“Excellent work, fellows, and a special thanks to John Watson for filling in for us today,” Greg started. The other rowers grinned, and patted him on the back.
“Hello, Mike!” John said with a grin, sticking his arm out for a handshake. Mike took his hand, but pulled him in for a half hug.
