“I’m going to make love to you this time Castiel and I’m going to put everything I have towards you, and I expect you to do the same. I need you to put everything into this night, and I mean everything. Prove to me you really want this bond as much as you say you do.”
Castiel wiped his tears on the blanket beneath him and stood to meet Hannah outside. She was going to hide him away from the world.
” The wolf roared and Castiel growled in response the alpha next to him shoving him off the stool.
“Gonna fuck you up against this wall, Castiel, and no matter where you look you’ll be watching me pound into the tight sweet ass of yours.”
“As bad as it always has been.” He muttered, and his brother fixed him with a hard look.
“Ask me, Castiel. Ask me to touch you. Ask me to for fill what you so deeply desire.” Dean’s green eyes watched him closely smiling at the helplessness in Castiel’s eyes as he looked up at him. He was bringing the Priest down to his level. Down into the depths of sin. Dean had no doubt that Castiel was now
Castiel glanced over at his other half the red-eyed alpha’s hands thrown in the air walking around them like the predator he was. “
Dean turned, smiled at Michael and sauntered, yes, he fucking sauntered, over to Michael’s mat in front of Castiel’s.
Castiel hung his head a war of emotions that were battling inside of him. Part of him wanted to accept Dean back into his life trusting him in all things like he always had, but another part of him was screaming violently that he was the very thing he saved him from all those years ago, a monster, a demon.
Castiel snorted coming up to her and giving her a hug. “We both know that’s a lie.” Hannah had become very attached to Gabriel from the two weeks that she had spent helping take care of him. Her way of trying to get rid of the attachment was by not seeing him.
Dean grinned again, “Just consider it Sammy. Take it from me, there’s nothing more satisfying then defiling a Priest.”
“In the flesh.” He responded stepping out of the shadows and into the moonlight.
Sam sighed. “I know, I’m sorry, okay? I thought it might help.”
Gabriel shrugged. “Dean and I are tight, and I wanted to see his brother again.”
“Because,” She shouted anger reflecting in her now yellow eyes, “you lied to me and I need to know why! Why would you lie to me?” She hissed getting back into his face and he saw his wolf step behind her his claws raised.
I really need to get better at updating more often... This chapter was done except for the last page and I've been sitting on it for months... sorry guys. I always love to hear from you in the comments below. P.S Brief mention of rape after the grave accent's marking the last change of point of view in the story for anyone who might have triggers! It is right after the sentence, 'The door to her cell opened light pooling into the once dark room.'
Dean pulled back suddenly. “Jump,” Dean murmured, catching Castiel as he wrapped his legs around the older mans torso. Dean walked till Castiel’s back hit a mirrored wall, Dean kissed him fervently, massaging Castiel’s dick through his sweat pants.
“Your wolf thought the same thing about Lilith and look where that got you!” She seethed and Castiel held up a hand silencing her.
The baby was glaring up at him, but it wasn’t crying anymore and that was a start. Dean sighed. “Look kiddo we’re going to have to make this work for awhile so you’re going to have start trusting me.”
“So, how was the wicked witch of the west?” Meg drawled and Castiel slowed to a stop looking at her with a new perspective.
Castiel scowled. Michael Milligan, the quarterback for the school, and one of the most popular people in this hell hole. He also happened to be openly gay. Everyone knew Michael was jonesing to get into Dean’s pants.
“You see that’s where you are wrong, Cas. I can see beauty. It does not escape me like it does for many of my kind.” he slowly added another finger opening him up further and scissoring his fingers and grinning at the way Castiel whimpered.
“Welcome back sunshine. You don’t look so good, are you feeling alright?”
“Promise, Annie.” He stood fully looking at John and nodding. The alpha led him back out to the foyer and Chuck stayed behind to hold Anna’s hand. Castiel stared brokenly at the ground a blond woman stopping them.
Gabriel slapped his hand on Castiel’s mouth. “Jesus, keep it down, will you? Just take the damn thing so I know at least you’ll be safe.”
Cas smiled lightly and leaned up brushing his lips against Dean’s almost in a way asking if it was okay. Dean’s answer was pushing his lips against Cas’s dragging his tongue against Castiel lower lip till his mouth opened. Dean licked into Castiel’s mouth just tasting him and enjoying having his warm body against his.
Lilith homed in on the woman then blue eyes swimming in her mind a fierce hunger filling her, a need to conquer, control, tear him apart and revel in cries filled her. The first cruel and unpracticed smiled she’s given since that night filled her features and her mind began to clear. “Do you know where they are? Do you know where my Castiel is?” She asked excitedly clutching at the woman tightly the warmth fading away as the woman dropped her hand a wicked smile filling the other woman’s features.
“No. There are no documented cases of that happening you know that.” Chuck spoke his voice low and Meg did know that, knew it painfully as she stared at her friend that she loved so incredibly who never felt what she felt. He couldn’t form proper pack bonds, the one they shared was weak and only formed out of years of close companionship, but that was it. They couldn’t mate, and Castiel had never wanted to.
Meg sighed giving him a petulant look. “Since when did you become the rational one?” She asked and Castiel’s eyes floated over to his wolf the being leveling him with an even look his eyes clear and filled with intent.
Castiel clawed at the hand around his neck, his face slowly turning a red color as he choked out, “Mary gave up her life for you and…”
“Meg says you see him like he’s another person in the room. How bad is it, Cas?” Gabriel asked and Castiel dragged his attention back to his brother frowning.
Dean held Sam’s phone up to his ear listening to the ringing of the other line. “Sam what have you done?” Castiel’s voice hissed into Dean’s ear.
Castiel’s eyes opened wide in alarm, and he started struggling trying to get away. Dean tisked, gripping Castiel’s hair in hand, he slammed his head down twice, grinning at the way the angel went limp under him.
Castiel scowled. “He’s my son, Dean.”
The man’s eyes opened widely staring open mouthed at Dean as he twisted and pulled his heart out grinning at the sounds of flesh ripping. Dean loved watching the life of a person fading out into nothing, and he took great pleasure in crushing the heart in his hand to a bloody pulp wiping his hand off on the Priests robes.
Castiel walked towards the man in back wondering curiously why a man was in here so late. The man’s eyes flickered down towards him briefly then went back to the angels. When Castiel stopped in front of him about to ask if he could help him the man asked. “Do you believe in angels, Father?”
“No, not as easily as yours. True mates mean that your souls are cut from the same cloth. When you mate with your true mate you can sense their thoughts and feelings. Dean’s powers are centered around the mind. He can sense strong emotions, but mostly he can read thoughts and if he so wished, he could truly destroy someone’s mind. We’ve worked very hard together to master his powers, so he’d never hurt someone without meaning too. He’s good at staying out of people’s minds, but he’ll never be able to stay out of yours.”
The drive from Grand Island to Lebanon took about ninety minutes. Not long enough. As they neared the town limits, Cas looked up at the old water tower. It hadn’t been painted in over fifteen years, not since Dean had climbed up there after Cas’ graduation and spray painted their initials inside a ten-foot heart. He looked away.
“Oh, hell no, but I slept like a rock last night. We have a great show to do today. Annnnnd, you look hot as fuck with your sexy bedhead.” He reached up and ruffled Castiel’s hair before plopping down on one of the chairs.
Dean led the way across the field, trying not to think about Cas following him. In the light from the porch, he got his first good look at the man Cas had become. He’d been gorgeous back then, but now... now, he was a work of art. Literally. Ink curled around both arms disappearing into his tight t-shirt. But it was Cas’ face that made his heart race. He was beautiful.
At the doorway to the kitchen, he turned. “I love you.”
“Start filming,” Sam told him, standing to get a better view. “What is... was that?”
“Ah,” Castiel said with understanding. Gabriel was a fountain of knowledge about the New Orleans social scene. He was a walking who’s who.
“Awesome. I’ll pick you up around seven. Can you give me your cell number?” Dean handed him his phone, and Castiel entered his number. “I’ll send you a text when I get to your hotel.”
Cas cocked an eyebrow. “Sixty-nine…. Hmmmm… I suppose you’ll want me to wrap their gifts too… so that might not be a sufficient trade.”
“I don’t want to cause panic, but the public needs to be warned.”
“Winchester?” A small redhead was standing beside him. “I’m Charlie, head of rig IT and I’ve been assigned to show you around.” She wore a polo shirt and jeans. The polo was in the signature orange of the Novak company.
“Daddy... Daddy says...” Each world was punctuated by great hiccups of air.
Dean looked down, his hands deep into the pocket of his cargo shorts. He’d lost weight since they’d arrived and they sagged, showing the elastic waistband of his underwear. “It’s not impossible,” he mumbled.
“Dean, please tell me you have a good reason to interrupt my day,” the man actually purred and Dean had to keep from gagging.
The side of Dean's mouth came up in a half smile. "I really am sorry.  I was a dick."
“Maybe he could be. He looks at you a lot.”
“On that note, I shall go back to work.” He pushed Gabriel to the side and headed for the dessert station. Thankfully, Gabriel was called on to check a delivery of vegetables, so he didn’t have to answer the question.
“Where is this place?” She asked suspiciously.
“Is that... Are you giving me an ultimatum?”
“John Samuel Winchester, where are you? If you left the yard, you’re in deep trouble.”
“The caterer for the Novak’s party on Friday had a stroke.”
“One down, one to go,” he said as he dialed again. “Sam, listen, kid... I need you and Eileen to pack up some stuff and come over to the house. Don’t say a word to anyone... I’ll explain when you get here. Hurry.”
“Thanks.” Dean was dumbfounded. John Winchester didn’t do social shit, at least not when he was working.
“Is it that obvious?”
? Dean looked over at Kevin, but the younger man was busy mixing up cookie dough and didn’t seem to be paying attention. Shaking off the feeling of impending doom, Dean began popping the skulls out of the plastic molds.
Thankfully, he was saved from doing something foolish, like ask the man back to his cabin for some alone time, by the return of his staff.
Castiel shut the door. In the mirror, he saw his face red with embarrassment. He stood over the toilet, staring at the photograph on the wall. A black and white picture of the Brooklyn Bridge. When he finished, he flushed the toilet and found his towel from the night before. He wrapped it around his waist and took a deep breath before opening the door. Dean was sipping a cup of coffee, still naked. As much as Castiel admired Dean’s body, he wished the man would cover up.
“Excuse me,” The PA and Dean turned to look at him. “I don’t want to cause problems.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean.” When he stopped talking at his interruption, Castiel took a deep breath. “Dean, I’m not sure if bringing Claire is a good idea.” There was silence on the phone for much too long. “Dean?”
“Thanks, man.” John had scrambled up and knelt so he could reach the table. At Castiel’s questioning look, Dean explained, “Booster seats are for babies and John says he’s not a baby anymore.” He gave a tiny shrug telling Castiel he didn’t necessarily agree. “With kids, you pick your battles.”
The producer of the show, Fergus Crowley, was leaning back in one of the stylist’s chairs across from Dean. “We’ve gone over this. They were nominated to win a chance to cook with you on the show. You, Benny, and Charlie will taste their dishes today and pick the winner. He or she will come back to tape the episode next month.”
“God...” he whispered against Dean’s mouth. Dean opened for him and the kiss deepened. He knew he needed to breathe, but for the life of him, he didn’t know why. He’d gladly die for this. Hands skimmed his shoulders and ran down his biceps. Dean pulled back, lips wet with their combined spit. He took the hem of Cas’ tee and dragged it over his head.
Castiel lifted the tome out of the box and placed it in front of Sam. He smiled as he watched the man. His touch was respectful and his eyes were filled with wonder.
“Was it?”
He led John through the house and Dean was waiting at the front door. He took his son’s hand and hesitated. Castiel waited, his head tilted quizzically. “John, head to the house.” The boy scampered away, leaving the two men alone. “I’m sorry I said you were snooty. You just seemed so distant whenever you were outside. I waved a few times and you didn’t even... anyway, I shouldn’t have said that.”
The white Camry would need a tow, but Dean was sure the trooper was on it. The deer had done some serious damage.  Dean tipped his Stetson to the other officer. “Morning. Heard you had some fawns still alive?”
The stylist was running gel coated fingers through Dean’s hair when the guy from wardrobe came in. What was his name? Stan… Steve? He was taking Cas away when Charlie and Benny arrived for makeup. Dean called out for Cas to meet him on the set and then let the crew make him ready to face the cameras.
“Give me the lineup of the tasting table," the chef said, tiredly running his fingers through his hair.
“You aren’t holding that against me, are you? Come on, Cas, I was just playing around. You acted like you were going to catch cooties from me hugging you.”
“No, Cas. It’s all good.” Castiel watched his only means of escape walk away.  Cas? The man was calling him Cas. He wasn’t sure how he felt about that. “Follow me. I’ve just got to grab a couple things out of the dressing room and then we can leave.”
At seven, Kevin and a dark-haired woman entered through the back door. “Some old, black car is taking up all the space. I had to park behind the beauty shop,” the brunette snapped in lieu of a greeting.
“What? What do you know?” Though her legs were shorter, she had eight of them and he had to hurry to keep up.
“Amanda Marie Winchester, enough.” Castiel watched the byplay between the two with interest. She lifted her chin and Castiel saw the family resemblance. The deputy had his hands full with that one. He smirked and that got him a glare from Winchester. “Go get your stuff and get over to Uncle Sam’s. I’ll pick you up there.” She flounced her long, blonde hair and stomped off, disappearing into the library.
The only part of the room not covered in webs was a small sitting area by the window. “Sit. We have much to discuss.” Cas and Dean took their places on a small settee, while she arranged her robes over a heavy brocade chair. She picked up a leather-bound book off the table beside her and opened it near the back. “Missouri was a friend and thus, I was allowed to open her grimoire. Her final entry...” She stopped and looked up at both of them. “It was as I suspected when I found Cas to have a heartbeat.” She passed Cas the book and he turned it so Dean could read with him. The parchment was thick and yellowed with age.
Dean parked the Impala in the back of the bakery and sat staring at the unassuming door. A light illuminated the small alley. Next to him, on the seat, was his packed lunchbox. It was one of those soft, insulated kind. Sam and Eileen had bought it for him when he told them about his new job. Taking a deep breath, he picked it up, and stepped out. Cas had told him the back door would be unlocked, so he opened it. The warmth and heavenly smells hit him and he couldn’t help but smile. It was returned by the Cas, in a white t-shirt, his hands and arms covered in a fine dusting of flour. He was kneading dough.
Realization made Dean’s heart pound like a bass drum. Cas used Dean’s birthday as his PIN. He dropped the phone like it was on fire. It glanced off his denim-clad thigh and hit the floor between his feet.
of all things.
Don't worry your pretty little heads. I'm fixing their shit. Really, I am.
As he neared town, Dean spoke. “Sam and Mandy are down at the newspaper office.”
Castiel reluctantly released his grip and took a small step back. “Since I plan on continuing, I suppose you should lie down.”
“Good morning, Ash.”
Dean Winchester pulled into his designated parking place in front of the sheriff’s office and got out of his cruiser. It was just the Fourth of June and he was already sweltering. “Hot enough for ya?” The call came from Abigail King, the town’s postmaster. She was unlocking the doors of the post office across the street.
“I don’t see…”
When he got home that afternoon, he went to his bedroom to change into a pair of sweats and saw the bed. It still looked like a few rounds of awe-inspiring sex happened there. The room smelled of sex too.  Dean snatched off the comforter and tossed it to the side. He pulled off the sheets and picked up one of the pillows. He got ready to strip the pillowcase off and fuck if it didn’t smell like Cas’ aftershave. He breathed it in. When he realized what he’d just done, he threw the pillow across the room and stomped out. The first shot of whiskey when down hard, burning all the way to his stomach. The second shot was easier. By the fourth, he didn’t notice the burn at all.
“We are usually working by five-thirty,” Balthazar answered. “The workday ends when the sun goes down.”
“Fuck, I’m up at the buttcrack of dawn anyway. I could have Ash take swing by your hotel so you could grab your stuff and he could take you to the airport.” He saw Cas hesitate, boxers midway up his thighs.
Dean high-fived Garth. Castiel stared down at the dessert, turning the plate this way and that, a look of utter concentration on his face. He wasn’t smiling. Dean looked up at Garth, Garth shrugged.
Castiel took his last bite of the omelet and pushed his plate away. “That was exceptionally good, Dean. Thank you.”
Castiel had no choice but to follow the dangerously attractive chef. The freckles sprinkled over his nose and cheeks could have been seen as flaws, but it only added to his perfection. They walked down a hallway passing various people Castiel assumed worked for the network. Dean grabbed the knob of a door with his name printed on it in large, white letters. “Here we are.”
“How did your friend like the burger?”
As they neared Dean’s building, Cas asked, “Did you find a pack-n-play?”
?’ “Did you know he turned down a job at the San Diego Zoo because he wanted to continue teaching?”
Castiel took the spoon from his hand and held it aloft. “I will be your guinea pig any time. That is really good. What is it?”
, began fixing his coffee while Dean stared at the vast assortment. This was the kind of place he’d dreamed of owning before...
. We work together. That’s it.” And even if Cas was gay or bi or liked dick in any size, shape, or form, he wouldn’t be interested in Dean anyway. Because of those very reasons Sam listed. “And besides, you know I don’t date men.” Memories of Aaron bled into his thoughts. Dating men led to problems Dean couldn’t afford.
“Your turn.” Dean’s voice behind him startled him and he splashed coffee onto his hand. “Sorry, I thought you heard me coming. Sam says I walk like a draft horse, like he would know. I don’t think he’s ever seen a horse in person.” The chef was dressed in a pair of jeans, zipped but unbuttoned, and nothing else.
The mound didn’t move and Dean was about to yank off the covers when Cas spoke. “It wasn’t a nightmare, was it?” Dean blew out a breath and sat down on the edge of the bed, his hip against Cas’.
“Great. Kevin, will you finish these while I show Dean around?” He wiped his hands on a towel and stepped forward. “Well, this is your five-cent tour. You’ve seen the front of the bakery, this is the kitchen. The cooler is over there,” he said, pointing to a heavy metal door. “And that’s our storage area.” Another wave of his hand had Dean looking over at an open area with floor to ceiling shelves, filled with bins and boxes.
They all gathered around Dean’s truck and listened to the broadcast. It was a warning to stay away from swampy areas, don’t swim or wade, and report any sightings to the police or Texas Fish and Game.
Six tired, wet, and disappointed individuals got off the boats two hours later. Benny hefted a cooler out of the back of his truck and they all grabbed bottles of water. “What’s next?” Benny asked, leaning against the bumper.
“I think you mean Hallmark. Lifetime movies can be sad and somewhat depressing.” Dean smirked and Cas picked up a throw pillow off the couch and wacked Dean with it. He did go and get his husband a beer though.
Her smile was blinding. “Call everyone you know. Explain the situation. No one crosses the Novak family.”
“The prince tried and tried until one day the curse fell away and the knight swept the prince off his feet and carried him to his tower. He apologized for being cursed and begged forgiveness.”
Benny smiled warmly at Camera Three. “Andrea, my lovely wife is named Andrea,” Benny paused to smile into the camera. Somewhere in Texas, a woman named Andrea was swooning over the handsome Cajun. “There is an easier and less messy way to make French toast. If you use Texas Toast style bread, the thick kind, place it in a greased baking pan, making an even layer. Mix your egg batter and pour over the bread. Let chill in your fridge for about thirty minutes. Bake at three-fifty for about forty-five minutes.”
They got back in the elevator and went up two more floors. The doors opened on the rooftop.  Not long after Dean moved in, he got with the other tenants and with their approval, got contractors to build a nice covered area. He bought a really good grill and had a work area built around it. After it was finished, he bought a set of outdoor furniture, an ice machine, and several other things that turned the once barren rooftop into a beautiful outdoor space. Missouri had added candles and oil lanterns. Mrs. Feldheim started a small herb garden in some colorful pots and her husband had chipped in a gas firepit last winter.
“Even better, you’re my guest.”
Running his hand over the stroller’s handle, he shook his head. “Dean, this is a Bugaboo Donkey.”
“Ha, you will come to me anyway, my old friend. We are in the cavern under the waterfall. Come alone and unarmed. Do not make me kill your lover.”
“Got it.” Dean gathered his ingredients and was mixing the batter before they spoke again. “Who is in front today?” Dean knew Jack was off with his mother on a mini-vacation.
“I get it. I was involved with a woman. Lisa. We dated when I was in my early twenties. Broke up and reconnected a few years back. She had a son. He looked like me. Shit, he even acted like me. The timing was right, and I thought he was mine. She insisted he wasn’t and when we broke up the second time, I pushed for a DNA test.” Dean paused as if reliving a painful memory. Castiel remained silent, not bothering to tell him that he was absolutely gay and not bi, like Dean seemed to be, if his story about the football captain was to be believed.
“Is it because we slept together?”
“That’s pretty cool,” she said, suddenly shy and not at all like the girl who stood up for him earlier. She mounted the bike. “See you late, Dad.” They both watched her ride off.
"Yes.  It's parked..." He pointed toward the rear of Sweet.
“No, John. Perhaps you should return home though and next time, ask for permission before coming over.” Once again, John’s lips quivered. “You are always welcome here. And remember, any time you are at the zoo, please ask for me.” The boy’s thin arms wrapped around his waist and Castiel’s heart felt a warmth spreading throughout his body. This child... a small replica of Dean Winchester, could break his heart.
“Can you show them back, please?” Was it John and Dean? They hadn’t mentioned coming to visit him, but he hadn’t seen them around either.
“Of course. I was glad to be of service. To whom shall I send my bill?”
“So you said in the story,” Cas’ voice was low and soft, like smooth Tennessee whiskey.
“I’m sure you’ve heard about her death and I’d like to talk to you about...” The dog was still making racket and while it didn’t seem to faze the woman, it was driving him batshit crazy. “Perhaps I can come in and...”
Inside the leather-upholstered SUV, Dean stared out the side window. “Dean, look, I know this is going to take some getting used to, but I’m here for you. You know that, right?”
“Since we’ve seen the place, we’ll follow along and get some shots, if that’s okay?”
When the knock on his door came, Castiel looked at the time in the lower corner of his laptop’s screen. It was ten. Frowning, he set it aside and rose from his chair. He opened the door. Dean stood in the hall, his chef’s whites stained from the dinner service. He grinned. “Miss me?”
“It’s Lilith Carrigan. Her parents came home from Gulf Shores to find her.”
“I’m not holding you and I haven’t wished for anything,” he hissed back at her.
Dean stared down at his hands, still clutching the plastic bag filled with his belongings. He hated that his brother had to put his life on hold to
“Just wanted to spice it up. Are you pissed?” Cas never minded being restrained before. Dean went to sit up, but his arm jerked him backward.
“Snooty... yeah, that’s what it was. Hey, what’s your name? My name’s John. I was named after my grandpa. Why do you drive a piece of junk? Dad told Unca Sam that it was a pimps mobile and needed to be shooted.” Castiel had to concentrate to keep up with the child’s running commentary. “My dad has Baby. She’s a Chevy. I think I like your turtles. They’re big. I want a dog. Dad says I’m not 'sponsible enough yet. What’s your name?”
“I was running on empty.” Everyone knew the story. It was plastered on every supermarket rag in the world. Talking about it was therapy, or so Meg kept telling him. He pointed out the window. “I was the proverbial small-town boy, singing in church and high school talent shows. I was ‘discovered’ when I made a YouTube video.” He stopped. He remembered that day like it was yesterday. The memories of laughter, twinkling green eyes, and the feeling of being loved overwhelmed him for a moment. As if sensing it, Charlie bowed her head and gave him time to pull himself together.
“No. He did complain about being your lackey.”
“Yes?” Castiel glanced over at his son’s serious tone. Jack was staring out the passenger window, his hands fisted in his lap. “Hey, you know you can tell me anything, right?”
“Come, sit.” He took Dean’s hand and pulled him to the sofa. He told Dean about his capture and torture and how the memories of Dean had kept him from going insane. “I’m telling you this because I want you to know that during the worst time in my life, you were there for me. I love you and want to spend the rest of my life showing you how much.”
“I believe I should catch up with the other contestants.” Castiel took a few steps in the direction the others had gone.
“Hot tea, Sir?”
“Cas brings me cupcakes. You’ve never brought me cupcakes,” she said.
“I have no excuse,” Castiel repeated.
He walked out on the front porch and remembered his car was at home. “Fuck,” he muttered under his breath. He would have to walk. When he reached the sidewalk, Frank’s voice called to him and he looked across the street. The older man was sitting on his porch.
, as in you didn’t see or hear a damn thing. That guy, Henricksen, was a scary motherfucker.
"Claire isn't quite ready for restaurant dining. She tends to get boisterous and loud. Very loud."
Dean stared out of the windshield. Sam was leaning on the hood of the Impala, gazing out over the lake. Clearly, he was ready to leave… to get away from the lingering stench of burned flesh.
She stared at him. “Dude, we are in the middle of the Gulf drilling for oil. Oil. Accidents happen. Though not usually on a Novak rig. We have the highest safety rating in the business, but we need to be prepared. Remember what happened to Deepwater Horizon back in Twenty-Ten?”
The look on her face made him smile. The shock as blood pumped from her body. The Lamb of God, blood of Jesus Christ, take away my sins. The warm fluid spilled to the floor and she crumpled. He pulled out the sword and only then did the ramifications hit him. He stared at her body, still, mocking eyes open in death. Taking the envelope and the sword, he went to the kitchen and got a towel. Madge kept a clean house. He wiped his prints off the doorknob and stepped out into the backyard. He needed to think.
“Ah, I understand. My son took off too.” They stared at each other for a few more seconds. Castiel noted how beautiful the man’s eyes were. Green, not dark like a forest, but lighter, like a spring meadow. He broke the stare. He was being foolish. His gaydar wasn’t the best, but even he could tell this man was straight as they came. The t-shirt looked to be one size too small for him and it showed his biceps off perfectly. His hand had been calloused, like he worked with them. Construction? Mechanic? Something manly.
Winchester cleared his throat, glared at Frank, and then turned back to Castiel. “All I ask is that you stay in the area.”
Dean looked at the teleprompter. Castiel? How the fuck did he say it without butchering it too badly? “Cas...Cast-e-el?” Dean looked at the good-looking man, expectantly.
There is a brief mention of Dean's previous lover.
“Dinner?”
“Please just put it on the nightstand and go. I will buy lunch the rest of the week.”
“How did you kill those crocs?”
“Slow… please…”
“I did the decorating, ya know, bakery stuff.” Dean winced internally. He sounded like a moron.
“Cas, I didn’t know. Christ. She never...”
His head thrown back in laughter. Asleep on an unknown hotel bed. Back to the camera as he cooked. Sun glinting off his sunglasses. Smiling at Sam. So many pictures. Hundreds of nothing but Dean.
The first trace of cum hit the back of his throat and he swallowed, savoring the taste of Dean on his tongue. His own pleasure was forgotten as he milked Dean dry. When Dean whimpered and pulled away, Castiel reared up on his knees and licked his lips, his hand once again, jerking himself off. Dean seemed mesmerized by the sight. “Beautiful... fucking hot... show me, Cas...”
Cas stretched and rose to his feet. He’d tuck Calliope into her crib and catch a few hours of sleep himself. She was having trouble sleeping through the night and he knew he be up around three to feed her. She made soft sucking sounds as he picked her up, but didn’t wake.
Dean let his forehead thunk against the wall. Sammy. “Not feeling well… might be catching a cold or the flu.” He faked a cough and tried to make his voice sound nasally.
“Meg...” Castiel whispered a warning. “Please be nice.”
When she faced north, her voice echoed in the huge chamber.
“Back up, chief. I know my team are treated great here. I just give them some extra incentives,” Dean said, turning to face Castiel. “I like loyalty in my kitchen. In this case, I want them loyal to me
It only took a second for Dean to stand up, and still holding the Macy’s bag, follow him. Claire was in a playpen and screeching. Gabe was trying to hand her a doll that he’d just picked up off the floor. Dean stepped forward. “Hey, hey, Princess, what’s all the fuss about?” He lifted the bag. “I brought you a surprise.” The sad screams and tears stopped immediately. She looked at him with interest.
“Sure thing, boss,” she responded with a nod. Gabe turned to head back into the kitchen, and spied Dean sitting at one of the tables near the bathrooms.
“They’re all the same, Cas,” Benny said. The ‘duh’ was implied.
“Pretty much,” the teenager added to the conversation. Castiel saw others nodding their assent.
“Humph,” Dean snorted. “Yet, you know the fancy name for a turtle.”
He swung open the door and froze. So, not an old geezer then. “Cas?”
He neared the table and saw Crowley seated with an elegant redhead. “Crowley, hello, I didn’t expect to see you tonight.” No one had mentioned it during the taping that morning.
“I’m heading to the local Walmart and buy sheets and everything else I need. I’ll be staying here tonight.”
On the plane, Dean decided he just needed to get laid. The weekend was coming up, and he planned on going out to a few clubs, pick up a nice-looking guy, or girl, and release some of the sexual tension Cas had caused. It was a shame that the first person he'd been really attracted to both mentally and physically was out of his league.
“I wasn’t good enough for her mom... looks like she feels the same,” Dean whispered. Why was it so easy to spill his guts to the man?
He was staring at his monitor hoping the answer would manifest on the screen when his brother walked into the station. He was greeted by Linda and he stopped at her desk to be updated on Kevin's Yale experience. Dean took a sip of coffee and waited.
“Oh, well, was I slated to give a tour today?” He knotted the silk thread and looked at his work. One more should do it.
“You gonna take me back to my car, or what?”
“Yeah, sure.” Dean steered Castiel toward the front of the restaurant and out onto the sidewalk. The now familiar SUV was waiting. Ash opened the door. Castiel turned to say goodbye, but Dean was already entering the car. He thought the chef would remain at Winchester’s since it was still rather early by New York standards.
He stood up and leaned over the desk, palms flat on the papered surface. “No, that would be unethical.”
Dean hit the brakes hard when he stopped in front of the entrance to the extended stay hotel. He hid his laughter when Novak jumped and gave a tiny yelp in surprise. Too bad Dean didn’t catch him drooling. At least it would prove that the man wasn’t perfect.
“Shut up. I’ve slept on this bed,” Castiel cut him off. He wasn’t a germaphobe, but he didn’t want to think about it either.
Dean knelt down and waited for her to get to him and then he wrapped her in his arms. “Hey, girl… you being good for your pops? Next time I see you, we’ll go to the big pet store over on Sixteenth. Would you like that?” He breathed in her dog breath and hugged until she squirmed.
He rushed to the counter and reached into the small bin. He pulled out two sets, safety pinned in pairs. He plucked another one out because he’d left his on the work table. He had no desire to see Rowena until the Winchesters left... and not even then.
“Threatened you? Are you kidding me? Honey, you aren’t worth my time,” Castiel bit out.
… she didn’t purr, she roared. The Impala, built in 1967, was his pride and joy and the only good thing he’d ever gotten from his father.
“And...”
Thirty minutes later, the director was frothing at the mouth and the studio audience seemed restless. Dean had been off his mark twice and it had confused Castiel enough that they’d had to call ‘cut’ and retake the shots. Castiel kept mumbling his apologies and Dean cursed under his breath, but Castiel didn’t think it was directed at him.
Charlie plopped down in the other makeup chair and Becky went right to work on her. Soon, the two women were talking about shipping something… or someone? Dean wasn’t sure which and since it didn’t concern him, he ignored it. With a shot of hairspray, Dean was done. He stood up and let Benny have his place.
. He pulled up the collar of his coat against the fierce South Dakota weather and put the keys in the lock. Strangely enough, there wasn’t any snow on the ground, but the wind was biting. “I should move to fucking Florida,” he muttered as he got behind the wheel.
with him. Castiel reacted without thinking. It was only after Gabriel all but shoved him into the kitchen that he realized how badly he’d frightened Claire. She was sobbing, great big hiccups, and looking at him as if she were afraid. It tore into his heart like thousands of razor blades. “I’m so sorry. So sorry,” he whispered, rubbing her back.
“She hated the law. By binding two members of the Council, she could turn the tide. She knew the votes would swing toward allowing the species to blend blood, especially with Alistair gone.”
The house itself was in a neat neighborhood. Dean’s was painted a soft yellow. He parked the truck in the narrow driveway, behind an older car. It was probably a gas hog, and Castiel’s inner environmentalist cringed at the thought, but she was beautiful and obviously well-loved. “Is that the
“Of course, he can. There was a clause that allowed him to break the contract if it inferred with the care of his child. That is the excuse he gave, but I don’t believe that. Do you...
“Don’t. You can’t get me all horny again. Benny will be here…”
Together they chanted.
“Yes. Castiel arranged for them to be brought here and given their final rites.” Dean closed his eyes. “Castiel will take you to them, if you wish.”
“Castiel?”
Back at the fire station, they waited with coffee provided by the firefighters. At three, a pickup truck pulled into the east end lot. The flood waters had reached the street and Dean’s boat was tied off at a telephone pole standing tall out of the water.  Dean walked out into the rain and watched as Ketch alit from the cab. “Winchester.”
“Wow, that’s awesome. Will he be going to Texas?”
. Cas, who had a long line of lovers.
“Charlie, you ever see the movie Children of the Corn?” Dean asked as they waited on the sidewalk for Meg to pick them up for the trek to Old MacDonald’s. His friend’s glare had him zipping his lips. He was missing his morning run with Sam around the National Mall. It was a thing they’d been doing for a couple years now and he enjoyed it.
“Go ahead, take your ball and go home… and while you’re gone, grab me a beer.”
He stepped through the doors and found a table by the window. “You aren’t welcome here,” his brother-in-law growled from behind him.
Cas hadn’t ventured up to the apartment much. When his workday was over, he would head home... or wherever he went during his off hours. Did the man have a personal life? Someone to rub his tired feet? Someone to... Dean swallowed. What was he doing? He had to stop thinking about his boss that way.
Dean smiled and shook his head. “Next time.” Castiel had no choice but to move away from the door. Dean gave him one last look and then was gone.
Her unicorn lamp gave the room a soft glow. He padded softly across the carpet and stared down into the crib. While shopping for his new bed, he briefly thought of getting her a toddler bed, but wanted to postpone it for a little while longer. He didn’t want his baby to grow up too fast. She was sprawled out on her tummy, her favorite stuffed bear curled against her side.
“How much is that going to cost us?” Dean asked as he exited the CR-V.
“Right,” Castiel answered snidely. He pulled the large manila envelope toward him and reluctantly opened it. Inside were the documents needed to disappear until the price on his head was eliminated. Driver’s license, social security card, a passport, and various other paperwork he’d need. “What’s my cover story?”
Later that night, after taking a couple of Advil PMs, Castiel lay on his back staring at the ceiling. He’d taken every blanket in the house and made a bed for himself. It wasn’t perfect, but it would do until he bought a new one. He fired off a text to Dean telling him what he’d gotten accomplished.
“So, great…uhm…you made a hamburger.” A hamburger, really? Dean had a hamburger on his menu at Winchester’s, his Manhattan restaurant, that was out of this world. He got $34 for it. Did this guy think he’d be impressed by his… he took a bite… holy shit… it was amazing.  Dean could taste a hint of cayenne… a touch of salt, but the other flavors melded together so easily Dean couldn’t identify them. He almost blurted out how freakin’ great it was but remembered he had two co-hosts to collaborate with before a winner was chosen.  “This was really good, Castiel,” he said a little more enthusiastically than with the other contestants.
Castiel finally looked up. Jo and Benny were back in the boat, their uniforms wet and stained. It was a perfect excuse not to converse with Ketch. Something about the man made his skin crawl. It was obvious that Dean and Ketch had a past, but had they been lovers, or was that wishful thinking on Ketch’s part? It wasn’t any of his business. That’s what he told himself. Dean ended his call and grinned at everyone. “Dad... Chief Winchester said to tell everyone ‘good job’.”
Ellen brought an expensive bottle of champagne to the table and took the last chair. “Dean, are we celebrating something?”
Graffiti, or destruction of property, wasn’t a big deal to Dean. At least three times a year, the water company had to send a crew out to paint over the latest message. Mostly it was one of the college football team’s battle cries, and an occasional heart drawn by a lovesick kid. Profanity wasn’t usual and tended to upset the women of the Baptist Church.
He had to defend himself. “I told him to stay away.”
“He’s an illegal,” she hissed at Dean like he was her co-conspirator.
“Perhaps I’ll be lucky enough that someone will call security.”
"He thought you would have fun, Castiel." Ruby, blew a raspberry on Claire's cheek, causing the toddler to giggle again and kick her legs into Castiel's ribs.
As one, the coven spoke.
Castiel took him as deep as he could, then set a rhythm. He swirled his tongue around the head and then moved his head up and down, Dean’s encouraging whispers driving him on. “You’re gonna make me come, Cas. Is that what you want?”

The rat-a-tat-tat of an M-16 made his captor turn and run for the door of Castiel’s cell. More gunfire and men screaming made Castiel try to loosen the rope binding his wrists. It was futile. He’d tried until his wrists were raw and bloody. In Venezuela, it could be rival drug cartels and if that was the case, Castiel was as good as dead. The mission went south about five days in. He’d been sloppy, his mind on other things.
His eyes went wide. Was Cas calling the cops? Or the fire department? No… not the fire department. It would get back to the station and Dean would never be able to live it down.
From Castiel’s investigation, he noted that the deer must have come down to drink and the alligator had snatched it into the water. There were no tracks on the bank. Castiel let his own eyes scan the water around them. He felt a shiver move down his spine.
When the song ended, Dean brushed his lips over Castiel’s and gave a little bow. “Breakfast will be ready in ten. Want to set the table?”
“It’s a Cosmopolitan. Vodka, cranberry juice, and a squeeze of lime.”
“You or Trés Bon?”
“It is, Dean,” Cas exclaimed. “I’m an introvert who is married to his job. The men I’ve dated in the past don’t stay. They say I’m not attentive enough to their needs. I’ve accepted that, but it doesn’t mean I can’t love a child.”
Dean huffed out a bark of laughter. “Castiel, the Angel of Thursday... that’s... awesome.” He looked up. “Anymore?”
“Oh. Well, yes, I do love to eat good food,” Castiel answered cautiously. He couldn’t very well tell another Novak employee that he’d been avoiding the dining room when Dean was supposedly on shift. One night of erotic dreams involving the sexy chef had him sneaking into the kitchen between meals to take leftovers from the staff and eat in his room.
Dean disappeared into the bathroom and a few minutes later, the toilet flushed. He came out, still naked. He wasn’t self-conscious of his nudity. He scratched his chest, yawned and blinked at Castiel. “You need to use the bathroom before I start the shower?”
Dean’s bark of laughter startled even him. “That’s just it, Ellen. I’m scared shitless.”
He must have spoken that aloud, because one of the prep cooks replied, “I think you’re getting ready to make meringue...”
"Gabriel, while I appreciate your faith in my abilities as a chef, I am just uncomfortable being away from Claire."
“It’s a two way street, Gabe,” Dean muttered, thinking of the innocent lunch he’d had with Cas just hours before. He’d called because the murder suspect was the man’s fucking son. How fucked up was that? Before they’d even finished their meal, Cas touched his arm in a gesture of sympathy and somehow, someway, they wound up almost fucking in the foyer of the apartment they once shared.
“No, he stepped out to run an errand... something about specialty sugar.”
“No. It’s fine,” Dean said softly and stepped into the line for the register. Castiel set the beer on the conveyor belt and took the bag from Dean, setting it beside it. Dean didn’t protest when Castiel gave the clerk his debit card. He didn’t speak when Castiel picked up both items and walked beside him to the truck. He didn’t say anything as he drove to the motel. Castiel worried his lower lip. He wasn’t good at social interactions and he’d acted on impulse.
“I’m sorry you got caught up in this,” Castiel said softly, his eyes meeting Dean’s.
He’d avoided looking out the windows, but he did see the oil rig coming up ahead of them. It rose out of the water like some robotic leviathan.
He yanked his flannel shirt off the crates he dropped it on early. He felt like getting into his car, calling Charlie, and telling her he was out. He glanced over at the Impala and sighed. An exit now would make him look like a drama queen, besides having to pack his stuff took all the spontaneity out of it.
. Was this some kind of cosmic joke? The first person he’d really wanted in his life and his past comes back to haunt him. No, that sounded shitty. Claire wasn’t a bad thing. She was adorable and...
“Turn here,” Sam said, pointing.
“Who?” Castiel asked, then answered his own question. “That Lilith person?”
“Yes. Anna. Perhaps you would remember a woman with red hair from Times Square. New Year's Eve. Two years ago?”
“What are you doing tonight? I thought maybe we could go shoot some pool.” He waited through the disapproving silence on the phone.
“We are here to say goodbye to a colleague and my dear friend, Missouri Mosely, High Witch. She died honorably.” She didn’t have to elaborate, every member of the Council knew of the prophecy and the events of the battle by now. Word traveled fast in their world.
Cas rolled his shoulders and brought his water bottle up to drink. Dean watched his throat move as he swallowed and thought about that night in the hotel. His lips moving over that same skin, sucking and kissing and grazing his teeth over Cas’ pulse. He blinked away the thought when Cas took a step toward him. “Dean, please do not move. Not an inch.” Dean froze.
“Dean, explain how it is time consuming?” Castiel huffed and looked at Charlie for help.
“Dean, I need you to listen to me. This thing between you and Cas… look, you’ve got to tell him the truth. You can salvage this.”
“Perhaps more,” Ketch said, more of a statement than a question.
“You turned off the Keurig and the water got cold,” he said in lieu of a greeting. Oops. Had he done that?
“Please,” he said with a smile. “Did you enjoy the hike?”
She didn’t even know his last name or who he really was. He gave a relieved laugh and thought about sharing this with Dean, but shook his head. No, Dean would be embarrassed. It was a shame that she didn’t get a chance to find out what a wonderful lover Dean really was. Then jealousy reared its ugly head. Well,
“I’m busy tonight. Eileen’s got a thing.” It was always something. It’s been like this since he’d left Cas. Everyone treated him like a herpes outbreak. Even those that knew the truth.
He quickly stripped the bed and tossed the sheets in the washer. He wasn’t due at the airport until two, and nothing else was on his schedule, so he did a quick clean of the house. He wrote out his list and drove to the Kroger to do his shopping. After he ate lunch, he showered and dressed in his uniform. He glanced at his watch and since it would take him about thirty minutes to get there, he climbed in the truck. He gave his baby, his pride and joy, his Impala, one last look before backing out of the driveway.
“Aye, are you deaf as well as an imbecile?” The banging from the front grew louder.
Sam was waiting around the corner his arms crossed his expression dark irritated his hazel eyes muddied to a brown color like they always did when he was feeling to many people’s pain. “What’s up, Sammy?” Dean smiled even though he knew, he could read it in the lines of his little brother's face, in those dark eyes that flared with anger as much as he could read it in his mind.
“We’re resting tonight. We’ll leave in the morning.” Her voice gave no room for argument and Castiel nodded pulling a tattered blanket from the bag rolling it up under his head and stared up at the night sky. The nymphs crawled from tree to tree watching them, making the trees sing around them, flowers Castiel had never seen before bloom casting a warm yellow light all around them. It was beautiful and terrifying all at once a strange lilt that eventually put him to sleep despite the strangeness of it all.
“Wanted you for so long, Cas, not a day went by that I didn’t want you.”
“We don’t know him,” Castiel responded.
Crowley hummed in thought. “Very well, Dean. I’m at the warehouse collecting the ingredients I need to take the Nephilim’s soul. If he’s such an abomination you can help me take it from his body.” Castiel silently collapsed to the floor his hands beginning to shake in despair. He needed to get it together. Dean couldn’t see him like this. He already thought he was weak. How would he mock him now seeing him come apart so easily?
Castiel groaned as Dean started tugging at his cock none to gently, “Come on Cas give me a fucking answer. Should I fucking end you?”
The man, Sam, Castiel assumed, rolled his eyes. “Hello again, Gabriel.”
Castiel shuddered blinking several times to try and clear the sudden feeling of being violated. “Cas?” Meg asked a shaky smile on her face her eyes screaming with worry. Castiel nodded once reaching up with hands that had never cupped his ears to stop the screaming and grabbed her own soft hands to pull them away from his face. Castiel stepped around her, his soft footfalls the only noise in the room as he walked out past Chuck and away from his omega brother that stood in protest only for Meg to put her hand on his shoulder shaking her head. He walked far into the forest and collapsed onto the misted ground staring up into the stormy sky and prayed for all of it to end.
That night was hazy at best a mess of memories all over the place he didn’t bother to put together and he didn’t feel like it now. “What does it matter, Meg?” He spat his tone dropping low his fingernails growing in his anger as his heart hammered in his chest.
“Dean wait!” The tall alpha called and Castiel shuddered as suddenly he was shoved out of the driving seat his wolf taking full control of his body and running out the door after the omega.
“You would have liked to have gotten there before the deal went down, but you didn’t really care about poor ol’Lester, did you? Oh, and so you know, I killed Lester myself. And that wife of his married the tattoo guy.”
Dean shrugged. “It’s a mouthful to say, I like Cas better.”
Dean pulled out a flask of gasoline from him pocket for this exact occasion. He flicked it up against the ceiling taking out his lighter setting fire to the dripping gasoline waiting for the paint to burn off.
Castiel nodded and stood. Dean took the all the towels they used and hung them on the rack tacking Castiel’s hand and leading him to the large king sized bed. Castiel curled to him and Dean wrapped his arms around him pulling him flush against him looking down in beautiful aquamarine eyes.
“Sandy hair, golden eyes, snarky sense of humor Gabriel?”
Dean took in all the markings painted on Castiel’s body. They were all purifying and banishing marks and Dean’s blood boiled in anger. Castiel was
“Are you defending him?” She hissed and Castiel grabbed Meg’s arm tightly and swung the beta to face him her expression tight with anger.
“Where’s the omega?” Meg asked nonchalantly inspecting her nails her lips thin.
Sam smiled at that. If Dean were human Sam knew he’d appreciate that.“Other than looks is he anything like, Dean?” Sam asked.
“My mother is going to present you with two options when you make it back to the manor. The first is you leave and go to a ward we personally own. You will be seen by the best doctors and they will help you cope with being a rogue and teach you ways to manage it so you can live a happy normal life. The second option it that you will stay here with us and overtime your wolf will merge with your mind once more because we can’t mate till you do. That is your decision if you want to leave or stay.” His face was hard, but his eyes revealed a deeper inner pain that Castiel stared back into wearily. What was it like for him, he wondered, to have a mate that didn’t want you back?
Castiel glared up at Dean with a poison filled gaze, “Fuck you Dean Winchester.”
Dean smirked as dread filled Castiel’s heart. Crowley was trying to take their son's soul. “Not exactly, Crowley.”
Sam shrugged his eyes flashing black as they often do when he doesn’t want Dean to read him, “I’ve been around.”
Dean grinned clapping Sam on the shoulder and began walking down the hallway. “Bitch.” He said good-heartedly, but the smile fell from his face the farther he walked away from his brother, out the door of his childhood home, and past the pack mates he would one day rule over and into the forest his wolf form a relief from it all. A place for him to let go of his unrequited feelings, a place that his power became quiet, and a place he could give in to impulse and not think for a while.
“What in the bloody hell are you doing?” Crowley hissed.
Dean smiled. “I know what you did when you went looking for me. I know how far you went. Crowley told me all about it. So, let me ask you which one of us is really the monster? Hmm? Starting to come back to you now?” Dean’s grin slid into place as Sam’s heart stopped. The memory clear as day behind his eyes of tricking a guy into summoning a demon just so he could torture the demon and find out where Dean was. Sam didn’t stop that man from making that deal and at the time he didn’t really care.
Castiel grinned. "Then I must be one hell of a drug."
Castiel smiled down at the man who had finally looked at him. Bright pastel green eyes were staring into Castiel like they could see into his soul. “I believe there is something there, and that when we are in need, they help us.”
“We’re gonna get him back.” Sam tried waiting for Castiel’s reaction.
“I know.” She said in a breath her voice catching in her throat. Castiel said nothing as they continued hiking up the mountain at some point shedding their clothes and shifting into their wolf forms. He didn’t feel like anything he could say would help. The transition from him being in control to his wolf being in control was less violent and more gradual like Castiel was fading out and he was fading in. And while his wolf ran with Meg and hunted down a deer and howled at the moon Castiel thought long and hard about the last few years. He faced the night he turned rogue, boiled himself in the shame he felt, but accepted it for what it was. He’d been a boy; he’d been angry and put in an impossible situation. He was still angry with his father for what he’d allowed to happen, but Castiel could find a small amount of peace within himself for what happened.
Gabriel peeked through his hands giving him a ‘duh’ look. “He won’t tell them where you are Cas. He woke up from the spell we knew Rowena put on him. He cast her out. He wants to try and make amends with all of us.” Castiel rolled his eyes shaking his head.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Go away, Crowley I’m not in the mood for your games.”
The omega hesitated hand in midair his green eyes studying the alpha. This close up Castiel could see freckles like galaxies spread out over the bridge of his nose, and dirty blond hair mused from hands running through it, and plush pink lips. He was beautiful and his scent was soft and comforting. Castiel growled lowly as the omegas expression softened for just a moment before hardening once more. “I’m no different than your pack mate. She uses magic too.” He muttered harshly.
Dean sighed. “He’s my son too, and he needs you most of all. If you died what would he do? He doesn’t trust me, he doesn’t know, Sam. How do you think he would handle losing you? They can’t kill me, Cas. The mark doesn’t allow me to die.”
“Mary,” John warned his voice hard but his gaze softened as he looked upon her.
Castiel shook his head. “Liar.”
“Fuck off alpha I know what he thinks of me.” The omega called out hiking up further into the woods the terrain getting more difficult by the second.
Castiel entered the bunker’s library where both Dean and Sam were sitting on their respective laptops. Sam looked up and smiled warmly although his eyes slightly widened at the look of him. “Cas, how are you doing man?”
“Look at yourself, Cas you’re responding to me so well, but you want more don’t you? You want my cock in the pretty little asshole of yours don’t you?” Castiel whimpered, but this time it wasn’t in pleasure it was in fear. He wasn’t supposed to have sex because he’s a priest and he’s devoted his life to the church.
She sighed running a hand through her dark hair fixing him with a heavy look. “I didn’t know where else to look or to go when Dean had shown up. He gave no explanation other than he knew where you were, and he had a plan. He’d take Lilith down while I hauled your ass out of there. I didn’t ask many questions and he told me to forget about him when it was all over. When I saw him this morning, I hardly recognized him. It wasn’t till you ran after him this morning that I realized who it was. Without him… I would never have found you.” And there it was. He had saved Castiel’s life. He wouldn’t be here without him.
Castiel finished his cigarette and stamped out the bud rolling his shoulders uncomfortably looking over to his beta friend her expression carefully blank ready for his decision. “Let’s go.” He rumbled walking in sharp strides to the front door knocking with quick succession raps.
“Get out,” Dean spoke his voice gravelly with anger.
“Please touch me, Dean. I-I need you to touch me.” Castiel’s deep gravely voice was beautiful with all that need in it. Dean wouldn’t deny him any longer, not when he obviously needed it so badly.
Castiel didn’t smile back but nodded. “I’m fine, Sam. I want to summon Crowley here.”
“My name is, Dean Winchester. What’s your name, Father? Please tell me I really want to know.”
And we're back! Progress is happening, to say the least. This chapter is a bit longer than the last one and I hope you all enjoy it.
Castiel pulled back, his breath ragged and uneven. Castiel knew this should feel wrong, Dean was his teacher, and no matter what Dean or him felt, even if they felt anything, they shouldn’t be doing this.
“There’s so much more I can give you, Castiel all you have to do is ask me.” Castiel almost sobbed when the demon stopped touching him completely letting him fall to the ground.
Dean chuckles, “No point in hiding anything from me little brother I always find out one away or another.”
Castiel sucked in a breath his entire body locking up realizing he was defenseless against this thing that had once been the human he’d moved heaven and earth for. “I’ve been watching you for awhile now your hand was curved around it. I do have to say it’s quite the knife. Hannah sure knows how to pick them.”
“He doesn’t. You’re just reading my mind and I’m done with the games. I kill you and your mate will kill me for revenge, and then it will all be over.” Castiel growled his fingernails pricking into her skin the smell of blood filling the air when suddenly arms wrapped tightly around him pulling him back into a chest the scent of vanilla and birch filled his senses and the thick smell of omega narrowed all his attention down to it a shudder wracking his body.
Castiel heard a loud dramatic sigh and a man with a small bulging face appeared from a back hallway in a black and white suit. “Dean, always a pleasure. And you brought the ex-angel with you, lovely.” Castiel didn’t miss the heavy sarcasm in the man's voice. The man looked Castiel over with an appraising eye. “Well, he certainly is more attractive in person,” Dean growled slightly moving to stand in the demon's line of sight of Castiel. Shaking himself the demon met Dean’s gaze. “What exactly can I do for the man who bears the mark of Cain?”
“Sure you can. You just stop.” Dean yelled. “There’s no point in trying to bring your brother back now.”
“We’ll see. I’m going to head off to bed. Is there a particular room I should crash in?” She asked, and Gabriel stood nodding.
Castiel watched the omega as he spoke taking in the worn Henley with the plaid over shirt with ripped jeans and boots. He looked like the typical biker guy he’d see in a bar hustling people out of their money. What he liked seemed to fit him and Castiel thought as he stared into those green orbs this was the first time, he’d seen him genuinely smile and it was beautiful. “And what about you, Cas? Anything you’d like to share?”
“We’re going home. Anna asked for me.” It was enough for Meg who nodded grabbing her own clothes.
Sam’s eyes widened in shock then hardened, “Wait a minute when you say companion you didn’t bind yourself to this ‘companion’ did you?”
Castiel watched in the mirror as Dean ripped the lube package open with his teeth, Dean’s eyes ranking down Castiel’s back side. Castiel shuddered as the cold slick of lube teasingly circled his hole.
“That’s not true. You’ve got me, you’ve got Cas, and you’ve got your child.” Sam whisperd.
Castiel whimpered and nodded, his skin flushing red with shame that he was giving himself away so easily. He was ashamed that he wasn’t even trying to fight anymore he was just giving in. He was ashamed that he cried out with loss when the demon removed his fingers, but moaned happily when he was filled with something much thicker and longer than the demons fingers.
Hannah came to his side. “Castiel maybe Dean will become cured and he will want both of you.”
“You never had a brother. Just an excuse for not manning up. But guess what. I quit.” Dean spat sitting back into his chair.
They waited in silence till the door swung open the heavy smell of candied apples and sweet omega hit Castiel in thick waves almost clogging his nose. Gabriel stood before them his expression sharp, his blond hair cut closer to his face then Castiel’s ever seen it, and the once bright light in his golden eyes dimmed with the weight of responsibility a phone held to his ear. “Yes sir, we’ll be there tomorrow. No sir. You’ll have to talk to Chuck about that one, sir.” Gabriel jerked his head to the side allowing for the pair to come in. “Thank you, sir, we’ll see you then.” Gabriel hung up the phone his shoulders dropping his smile hardly reaching his eyes. “You came. I wasn’t sure you would.” He spoke his voice sharp stress obvious in his gaze as he looked them both up and down.
Castiel was finding it harder and harder to tell him no. Looking into this man’s green eyes made him want to be everything he could be for him. He felt like a righteous man even though he knew that he wasn’t a man at all, but an unholy demon.
“I’ll show you,” Meg said nothing to Chuck as she left the room her mind chewing over everything she’s heard tonight. It made more sense to what she remembered of that night, and a sick feeling settled over her stomach wondering if Castiel had purposely lied to her or if maybe that was truly how he remembered it.
Castiel screamed as another contraction hit him burying his face into the pillow. The baby had no way to get out of his vessel and it was trying desperately to get out. “Hannah just get it out of me!” Castiel roared as his child's first cries filled the air.
Castiel sighed. “I know that, what happened after I found her? I don’t… I don’t remember much.” He admitted, and the harder he attempted to remember, the stronger the throbbing in his mind became.
Sam huffed. “For what it’s worth, I got your blood type.”
When the truck stopped Castiel climbed from the car gently pulling his sister into his arms holding her tightly to his chest. This was the last time he’d smell her lilac smell, the last time he’d see her beautiful hazel eyes, and touch her wonderful red hair. He stared at her long and hard as if to burn her into his memory before walking towards the looming home. It was bigger than their mansion mostly made out of black stone, and white wood. It was intimidating to look at, but Castiel felt no fear. He was no longer afraid of the wolf screaming in his ear, he didn’t fear the screams of his soon death. He embraced it with full clarity that this would be worth it in the end, for everyone.
Castiel sighed as he pulled on his grey shirt for gym class; thankfully, this was his last class of the day. He was startled out of his thoughts by the sudden slap on his back.
The man looked down at his hands. “And what about demons do you believe in those as well, being one of God’s creations?”
Castiel rapped his blunt fingernails against the wooden bar the heavy smell of booze and alpha sweat was poignant in the air. Meg had just stepped outside for a smoke and the longer the beta was gone the more the fire under his skin burned.
“Give me a moment please.” Castiel whispered.
Dean grins, no Castiel was worth the rash decision. He was worth the risk of walking into a hunter’s lair to claim as his own. “What are you grinning about?”
Dean groaned opening his eyes slowly. “Yeah, if you consider drowning in your own sweat while your blood boils okay.”
Sam ambled back to the dungeon less than thrilled to go another round with his brother. Sam frowned at the open door and rushed into the dungeon seeing it empty. He turned to run out and find Dean when something hard slammed into his head dropping him to the floor. “You see Sammy the more human you made me the less the cuffs worked. Better luck next time. I have an angel to catch.” Sam groaned into the ground as slowly the darkness took over his conscience.
Sam ran a hand through his hair, “He told me, ‘It’s okay Sam I forgive you,’ like I knew him before. His name is Gabriel and I don’t remember him Dean. When he said that I just froze I couldn’t follow through. I have him chained in our dungeon, but I’ve been spending the past two day’s trying to figure out where I know him or how he knows me.”
“No.” Dean said weekly.
“What brought this on?” She asked and Castiel narrowed his gaze taking a few steps towards.
“It’s time for me to go now, Anna,” Castiel whispered in her ear and her eyes fluttered open to look at him weakly.
Crowley snorted walking forth. “There isn’t a spell for that. You don’t think that if I knew one I wouldn’t have been using it all these years?”
“One that you adore. How many times are we going to have this argument? He hasn’t show any signs of having more strength than he should. He hasn’t used any angel powers. I’m starting to think he’s normal.”
“Nowhere to run… my pretty little lamb.” He was nearly backed up against the farthest wall, and Castiel stood frozen in fear. The demon’s black eye’s shined brightly with excitement. His lips only a few inches from his ear. “Please forgive me, Father, for I’m about to sin…” he nipped at Castiel’s ear, his body shivering against his will.
Castiel suddenly arched an orgasm being pulled violently from him as Dean hit his sweet spot perfectly over and over, the painful jerking on his cock had even begun to be pleasurable all came to sudden spike. His muscles clenched around Dean pulling a slew of cuss words from the man above him as he came inside of the angel.
Dean kissed the skin behind Cas’ neck, shushing him while withdrawing his fingers.
“Mr. Singer says she was hexed by Rowena that was why no medicine would work on her. You need to fight magic with magic to cure a hex.” Chuck’s face was riddled with guilt his once handsome face gaunt with distress. It was his fault and he knew it. Castiel bit back the anger that riled inside of him fixing his gaze back on Anna.
Dean's face lit up as he pulled Castiel against him, kissing him like Castiel was the key to living. "You'll be the death of me, Cas."
Dean reached over to the night stand grabbing the bottle of lube he always kept there and opened the cap the pop of it seeming loud in the other wise silent room. Dean grinned when Castiel whined trying to pull Dean back down on top of him.
Castiel smiled cruelly at the alpha his hands curling into tight fists and his claws extended. “They never do.” He muttered and with wicked speed slashed the alpha’s throat out his claws clutching the man’s jugular in his hand the blood seeping out and onto his arm sticky and sweet.
Slowly Castiel let his hand down chewing over what the omega said. He didn’t have magic, he didn’t know how it worked, but he’d watched Meg enough times manipulate those around her and he hadn’t given it a second thought. So why was he struggling so hard with this now? Lilith. It came down to her how she’d manipulated him, the beast inside of him and twisted him around her finger.
Meg shifted back first her face angry as she glared at Castiel who changed back more slowly than she did allowing his body time to pop and crack back into place with less pain. “So, which one am I talking to the pain in the ass alpha or the real you?” She asked with a hiss and Castiel glanced up at her with hollow eyes.
The baby smiled up at him it’s little hand grabbing onto his nose. Castiel smiled tears sliding down his cheeks. “I will stay for a couple more weeks till you are comfortable on your own. This is all I can offer.”
Lilith scratched and stone wall with broken fingernails the blood pouring freshly down her hands. She didn’t feel the pain anymore, her mind constantly ached her mind bleeding in its own right. The door to her cell opened light pooling into the once dark room. Lilith didn’t move, didn’t care if the guard was there to use her body once more, or if it were mealtime, or what was going on. She only stared at the blood falling down her hand her mind replaying that night over and over. Her mind was a nightmare.
Hannah sighed. “Once I identify how he’s tracking you I will let you know, Castiel.”
“This is my brother, Castiel, excuse his lack of voice, he’s kind of shy.”
Dean chuckled and smiled mockingly copying Sam. “‘The Lore’. Hunters… Men of Letters. What a load of crap it all is.”
Hi all! It's been quite a long time. I've sat on this fic for a while. I've reviewed, tried to continue it, and now have rewritten it. There are some factors from the old fic that are the same, but so many things have changed. This version is much more brutal than the original and in this version of the story, there are a few suicidal themes coming through in this as well. I will write a warning before all fic chapters when there will be something violent or suicide related. I hope you guys will enjoy this journey with me once more. If you have questions please let me know in the comments below.
They walked down into the foyer two hushed voices whispering furiously. “You need to talk to him, Dean.” A tenor voice growled in irritation the scent of anger heavy in the air.
Everyone stood, mumbling their goodbyes. Sam walked up with Gabriel, who was ogling the older man’s ass.
Castiel let out a shuddering breath biting his lip Mary gave him a sympathetic smile. “You have a lot to think about, Castiel. Go see your sister.” This time he left her to stare up at the moon while he trudged off towards his sister his body heavy with swirling emotions and thoughts that he couldn’t make sense of.
“Dean, we really shouldn’t be doing this.”
It was early, dawn had just crested over the world when Castiel walked back to the mansion. Moister stuck to his skin, a thin fog covering the grounds. Laughing rung in his ears, crazy inconsistent laughter, his laughter, but he ignored it and shoved his hands deep into his pockets. In between the laughter muttered words would slip through. “We’re going to die. You’re going to kill us. We’re going to fucking die.” His wolf muttered to himself the image of him clutching his head as he laughed and his eyes crazed was burned into Castiel’s mind. He ignored it all; he had a job to do. Chuck had found him deep in the forest and spent the night by his side. Eventually, the other alpha told him the plan, where they would go, and what they would do, and Castiel had agreed. Like a ghost, he made his way through the hallways without a sound entering his sister’s room and lifting her from her bed. She grumbled but otherwise didn’t stir. He held her frail body close to his own as he made his way down the stairs Chuck watching him from the bottom of the staircase. Castiel stared at him blankly and the man swallowed hard unnerved by his gaze and walked them out to his truck. Castiel laid his little sister on the back seat caressing her face once before shutting the door softly pausing for just a moment.
Castiel nodded reluctantly and his wolf snarled shooting to his feet. “
The wolf screamed in his ears and Castiel closed his eyes tightly shaking his head, hands snapping up to cover his ears. It did nothing to help. He was heading down a spiral the screams heavy in his ears drowning out any other noise. He couldn’t take this, he didn’t want to. Clear as day he saw in his hands a silver blade, his hands shook, his body weak with exhaustion, and in front of him stood the wolf with red confident eyes and a steady hand held out to him for the blade, for control. Castiel looked back at him, then at the blade his hands shaking even more with indecision warring inside of him. “
Castiel’s other hand drifted down between them and cupped Dean’s heavy sac before sliding up the length of him. Using his thumb, he traced the slit, smearing precum over the head. Dean let his head roll back, bearing his neck for Castiel’s mouth. “Want you... want this...” Dean said softly.
He plucked the note off and opened it. A smile broke through the frown.
Her dark eyes turned again to Dean. “Child, this was not a spell to force love upon you. This was Missouri’s gift to you both. Castiel has his heart, and you, Dean, you have what your mother wished for you.”
"Dean Winchester is a self-entitled dick. Let's leave it at that." Castiel snatched up Claire's suitcase and bag of toys, the toys he bought her, not the huge hamper that his sibling's wife must have bought while he was away for less than three days.
“You know why I sent you away. I explained…” Okay, maybe he didn’t get it... or was it that vampires couldn’t feel things?
“Who is that?” Castiel asked, knowing that Missouri would know everything there was to know.
“Mick will have the plane waiting when you are ready,” Cas said softly. He hadn’t talked much and Dean wished he could read minds. The stairs led to a passage. The lighting was dim, but Dean’s eyes quickly adjusted. “They are here,” Cas said as he stopped by to stone doors. Etched in the stone was Campbell, then beside it, the name Winchester. Before, the engraving was too old to read. Dean touched it and warmth spread through his fingertips. He gasped and yanked his hand back. “It is the sigils. They hold your parents’ power.” Dean reached out again. He could almost hear a humming in his blood. He could remember his mother’s blonde hair and kind face as she read them stories about magic and heroes on horseback. And John, tall and imposing, bearded with a ready smile. “They would be so proud of you, Dean.”
The ride to the store was done in complete silence. Cas didn’t even turn on the radio.  The Dollar Tree wasn’t crowded since it was a work and school day. Dean grabbed a green shopping cart and headed for the grocery aisle. When he turned around, Max was still standing at the end, a perplexed expression on his face. At Dean’s questioning look, he shrugged and pointed.
Silence filled the cab and Dean looked sideways. Novak was staring back at him. “My life in a nutshell. So, any Mrs. Novak back home? Little Novaks?” Yes, he was curious. Sue him.
hated that he didn’t even know how to work a god damn car stereo anymore. More than anything though, he hated John Winchester for letting him rot in prison for something he didn’t even do.
“Who knows? It’s kind of creepy,” Dean replied with his mouth full of food. Cas turned to look at him, head tilted. Here it was. He was going to say something about Dean’s table manners. Others in the past had made some pretty snide remarks about them. Instead, Cas let one corner of his mouth twitch upward.
The show’s theme music played while the three of them deliberated. “The burger.  It has to be the burger.”
“Bex, you’ve been sitting in that same spot for the last hour, mumbling under your breath. You’re not fooling anyone.” He sat up, using his calves to press the footrest down. “Talk to me.”
. How did she get in? He’d been standing by the back door, she didn’t come in that way. “Good morning, sorry to keep you waiting. I was in the back room,” Castiel said in a rush. “Mr. Winchester?” He looked from one to the other. Both were very attractive.
“I’m sorry, you looked like...” Castiel stopped.
“Stefany should be here by now.” Dean mumbled something under his breath.
“You’re going alone?” Charlie nibbled on her lower lip and Cas was struck with a feeling of fun filled nights of movies and popcorn. She was smart, funny, and even the hard questions didn’t seem intrusive coming from her.
“That’s the third stop. First, we need to get you a phone.” Dean opened his mouth to protest, but Sam’s narrowed eyes made him shut it quickly. He made a mental note to keep a tally of these purchases. He would pay him back every last dime. Inside the Verizon store, Dean stared in wonder at all the devices. The world sure had changed since he’d been gone. He stood to the side and let Sam negotiate. He didn’t have a clue what 4G and cloud storage were. “Dean, come meet your new phone,” Sam said, motioning for him to sit down across from the cute salesperson.
“No, and I’ve already called them,” Jody replied. “They should be here soon.”
. He tried to laugh but choked.
With his newfound freedom of a car, Castiel had stopped by the grocery store and bought provisions. He had bottled water, granola bars, fresh fruit, and chocolate to add to the lunches that Dean brought. Now, he stood at the motel’s main entrance with his messenger bag and a cloth shopping bag full of snacks.
, of Dean’s hand on the small of his back. It was an intimate touch, usually reserved for a loved one, but Castiel could not dislodge it without making a scene. Dean showed him each station and introduced him to several people that Castiel would never be able to remember, nor would he have a reason to do so. Dean’s kitchen was impressive in its size and the smoothness of function. His brother’s restaurant was not shabby by any means, but it was obvious theirs was in its infancy compared to this one.
“Bobby get drunk and wreck his truck again?” Small town living had its drawbacks. Nothing exciting ever happened here.
“Huh, interesting,” he mumbled as the main complex came into view. It wasn’t what he had been expecting. Everything was neat. Raised beds were set around bleached rock walkways. A large, red barn was off to the right, but Dean had a feeling no animals inhabited it, since it was pristine. An array of tables and chairs adorned with umbrellas the same hue as the barn were in the center of it all.
“Nefarious? The scientist is in the house, ladies and gentlemen,” Dean said, giving Castiel a lopsided grin.
The pie turned out to be from a box,
“We’re still on for breakfast, hon. See you at seven,” Mildred said over her shoulder as she and Frank went down the porch steps.
“Did she have any enemies in town that you know of?”
Cas sat silent. He had to let Dean work out what was going on in his head. He’d be patient.
“Guess so,” Dean bit out. He was still angry. Castiel grabbed his bicep and dragged him behind the large doors.
Dean nodded, glanced at Victor, and nodded for Castiel to follow him. Several yards away, Dean stared at the SUVs and the operatives still processing the scene. “So, this is your life, huh?”
He pulled off his shirt, sniffed it, and grimaced. Thankfully, the motel had a laundry on the premises. He was about to turn on the shower when there was a knock on his door. Frowning, he looked out the peephole and there stood Dean. Forgetting he was half dressed, he opened it. Dean’s eyes widened and traveled down to his unbuttoned pants, then back up again. “Uh...” He thrust a bag into Castiel’s hands. “Dinner.”
“I can’t tell him here. Will you call Ruby and ask if she will watch her for an hour or so?” Gabriel nodded and patted Castiel on the back. “I’ll drop her off...”
“Are animal attacks to livestock in your jurisdiction?”
“Hey... come up to the house and let me look at your hand.” He was a glutton for punishment. He should have let Cas leave. He’d go back to his life, knowing Cas hadn’t forgotten him... knowing Cas wasn’t at fault... then what?
Castiel opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Crowley began to talk again, but Castiel realized the man was talking to someone else. Seconds later, Crowley spoke again. “Duty calls. I will wait on your decision then. Goodbye.” Castiel slipped his phone into his apron pocket and placed his hands flat on the floured surface of his work table. Did Dean know about this offer? Was Dean behind it?
“I wear a gun, Sam,” Dean retorted, his feelings a little hurt. Sam never mentioned riding along with him until Novak showed up.
He took his place in the small line of tough looking men and a couple of women that were hauling duffles and suitcases into a hangar. His eyes locked on the large helicopter sitting on the tarmac. The Novak logo was emblazoned on the side. It was a lot bigger than the one he’d trained in. That only meant it would sink faster, Dean thought, trepidation setting in. Flying in planes was bad enough and he avoided it like the plague, but this contraption was nuts.
“If you talk, I will give you water,” came the now familiar voice beyond the hot spotlight.
Dean leaned close. “In case you didn’t notice by the accent, Benny is a transplant from New Orleans. I think their loss is our gain.”
“I want to find this thing, Dean. I want to warn people.”
Dean turned on the tap and let it run until it was hot. He adjusted the temperature and before going to get Cas, he looked at himself in the mirror. He looked well and thoroughly fucked. There was a bruise forming on his collar bone that Becky would have to hide with makeup. He threw himself a wink before tossing two towels onto the closed toilet seat. At the door of the bathroom, he called out. “Come on, Cas. Shower’s ready.”
Ash was waiting and grinned at Cas. “Hey, Mr. Novak. Dean and I were wondering where you were. He wouldn’t let me leave without you.”
. He hated that he was he interrupting Sam and Eileen’s life and invading their home, hated that he had no job, no money, nothing but a couple of books and some ill-fitting clothes, and
. With Akhtar gone, Castiel could return to his life. He let his eyes take in the beautiful being that was Dean Winchester and pasted on a smile.
Castiel’s orgasm hit him like a runaway freight train. He bucked up into Dean, crying out, his cock pulsing.  Dean rode him through it, his hand never stopped jacking himself off. He heard Dean’s gasp, and felt the hot stickiness of Dean’s cum splash over his stomach and onto his chest. Dean slumped over him and Castiel wrapped him in his arms and held him. His fingers combed through Dean’s short hair and kissed the damp skin of his forehead as they came down and their heartbeats returned to normal.
Angry eyes met his and he didn’t react fast enough to duck. The fist caught him on his cheek. “Fuck off, this is between me and these carpet munchers here.” Dean swung, catching the man in an uppercut to the jaw. The guy staggered but didn’t go down. He had about thirty pounds on Dean, but Dean knew how to fight. He pushed Dean and he crashed down on the table, two women scrambling to get out of the way. Dean was aware of several people yelling. He sprung up, but not before using his feet to kick the man in the stomach. The jerk hit the concrete and Dean stood above him, hands clenched at his sides. Growling like a mad bear, the bastard made a move to stand.
“Farm life isn’t for sissies,” Castiel stated firmly. “Clyde can be feisty with strangers, but he wouldn’t cause you harm. Most of our animals are used to being handled and are usually well-mannered. I do apologize for his behavior.”
“Cas, when you finish in wardrobe, have someone bring you to the set so I can show you around the kitchen.” Dean met his eyes in the mirror and gave him a reassuring smile. Castiel nodded briskly and made his escape.
“She’s not going to try to talk me into sitting on the Council, is she? Because, honestly, dude, I can’t right now.”
“I think it’s a sure thing.”
The man, Aaron, looked from Castiel to Dean and back again. “No, that’s okay. I was just catching up with Dean. Name’s Aaron. We’re... old friends.” The man’s expression was a mixture of hurt, and perhaps anger.
If it were not for the incredibly good looks of the chef, Castiel would have faked an unfortunate bout of diarrhea to have an excuse to retreat to his office. As they exited the conference room an hour and a half later, Michael nudged Castiel and whispered. “That’s ninety minutes of my life I’ll never get back. If my marriage lasts fifty years, promise me that you’ll remind me of this insanity and tell me to take her to the Bahamas instead.”
“I’m going to work,” he called out and picked up his utility belt from its hook by the back door. He wasn’t expecting an answer and didn’t get one.
Cas stood and stretched and felt Dean’s admiring eyes on him. To be a tease, he ran his hand down his stomach and tugged at his sac. “Cocktease.” Cas grinned and winked before, he too, made his way to the shower.
“I just don’t get people. We are together, why do they still have to ‘ship’ us?”
“Fuck buddies,” Castiel said dryly. He’d always hated the term.
He felt Charlie’s presence behind him. “This is where it all began. Sad, huh?”
“It was a stupid idea. You would probably want something more private. I’m sure you have someone in your life...” Cas suddenly seemed uncomfortable and gulped down half his water bottle.
At this point, Castiel was directly behind the demon his gaze trained on the back of his head as he crept forward his angel blade a solid weight in his hands. “Crowley has gone underground. He’s been keeping his wear about under tight wraps. I swear I don’t know.”
Dean smiled softly pushing Cas onto his back while he climbed on top straddling his legs. Castiel was still beautiful if not more so than the last time Dean had saw him like this. Castiel was right their bond was torn and the best way Dean knew how to mend it was give himself to Castiel and focuse on what was left of it pouring more of their souls into it.
“Oh no you don’t angel. You don’t get to fucking crawl away from me.” Dean slammed his foot over and over into Castiel’s ribs counting every scream coming from the angel’s lips. The angel doubled over and cried out in anguish.
As they pulled up to the looming clan Castiel internally stiffened. It wasn’t the fact that he was closer to his impending death, but the fact that his instincts told him he was walking into a massive clan as a lone wolf and they would weed him out as different. Chuck glanced at him then back at all the houses, and then the sprawling mansion at the center of it all. “They won’t hurt you, Castiel. They’ll get you the help you need.” His father tried to reassure and Castiel remained silent, void, numb to his own emotions.
In Dean’s defense, Michael’s pose was truly awful, but he really didn’t have to announce it to the whole class. After running his hands over almost every inch of Michael’s body in order to correct his pose, Michael was officially supporting a boner, and Dean had a shit eating grin on his face. Dean leaned down next to Michael’s head speaking loud enough for Castiel to hear, but not loud enough for the entire class to hear his words.
Dean shook his head and left the room to take a shower one of the few things he still enjoyed doing from his human day’s. Dean had just gotten done washing his hair when he heard the loud crash and the sound of his son’s cries. Dean didn’t even care that he was but ass naked he grabbed the first blade off of the counter and burst into the main room of the motel. He saw Crowley holding his child his eyes bright red and Gabriel’s a bright blue the two staring eachother down.
When the rest of the class showed up, they were all whispering excitedly about the upcoming lesson. Castiel turned towards Gabriel. “What’s his brother teaching?”
She sighed heavily. “He’s an abomination, Castiel.”
“What’s legal?” Dean asked walking up to the two brothers.
Dean grinned. “I’m coming for you angel.”
“You’re mine now, angel.” Dean was on him in an instant ripping Castiel’s clerical clothing off, and laying him out before him on the cold stone floor. He was a beautiful sight to behold with his soft pale skin, and those deep blue eyes looking up at him as if he were God himself.
Castiel jumped at the hand on his jaw Meg’s dark eyes concerned. Castiel pulled away from the touch uncomfortable with the raw emotion in her gaze. He didn’t feel the same as her. He was protective of his friend, but that raw emotion of love he’d never returned. He knew he hurt her could smell it in her scent. “Meg, you know I don’t feel that way.”
Castiel whimpered again his erection was becoming more apparent by the second. “C-Castiel. My name is Castiel.”
Castiel glared up at Dean before answering without a tremor of pain, panic, or fear in his voice, “Yes. End it. I have nothing to live for anymore. I don’t want to see you sink any deeper into the darkness then you already have.”
This chapter contains violence.
“You like that, angel?”
Dean turned around and smiled his black eye’s flashing before disappearing. “I’ll be around,” he turned back around and started walking away, “and trust me Castiel I will be back for you. I can’t just leave my property anywhere now can I?”
Chapter summary:
She nodded once more and went back to reading while Castiel look out the window and into the woods he now called his home.
“You’re lying.” Castiel hissed and Mary shook her head as much as she was able.
Dean’s eyes lit up triumphantly. “You won’t regret this, Cas.”
His wolf knelt down in front of him the image of him broken and bruised. “You got the power you wanted, and you didn’t care for the consequences. Now you have to deal with what you have done.” But Castiel didn’t want to, and as he closed his eyes finally passing out from the pain he dreamt of a different choice, one where he had no choice that if he didn’t turn rogue Chuck would have killed him and he stuck with that choice.
True to his word before, there was nowhere Castiel, looked that did he not see Dean plowing into him from behind. Castiel watched in fascination, observing that if he angled his head right, he could see the way Dean’s leg muscles were pulled tight and how his back muscles rippled with every movement.
“S’okay, angel, I’ll take care of you.”
Castiel shook his head shuffling over to the couch to sit next to her. “There’s no need for that, Hannah.”
Dean’s face darkened. “Oh, It’s the real me, all right. The new real me. The me who sees things for what they really are. Winchester’s, do gooders. Fighting the natural order. Let me tell you something. Guys like me, we
“Goodbye, Sam.” Castiel hung up the phone and turned to Hannah who was watching him carefully.
“Coward! You’re a coward! You’d rather die than fight. You’d rather kill yourself then deal with me, deal with the world. Fucking coward you’re leaving her behind! Liar! Fucking liar!” His wolf howled in anger in his ear, and the only outward sign Castiel made was a kiss to Anna’s head his eyes flickering to the wolf then back down to his sister.
Castiel snarled, “I learned it from you! Just like I learned how to be human from you! I learned to love and feel emotions when it shouldn’t have been possible! You Dean Winchester, the once savior of my existence, is now the bane of it.”
“Why would someone want a moldy, taxidermied squirrel, Dean?”
When the woman in the red and black robe covered Missouri’s face, Dean asked, “What’s happening?”
do to be called in front of his father. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s local office was located in a large complex, complete with an inner atrium. Dean and Jo walked along the pathway that led to the elevator and rode it to the third floor.
“Ten seconds.”
Dean was stopped a half dozen times by patrons and he always had a smile and a few words. Castiel wanted to pull his hand out of Dean’s especially when he saw a few diners taking ill-disguised pictures, but Dean was holding firm. Eventually, Dean stopped at a table in a small alcove beside a set of French doors. Castiel glanced through the glass and saw a small courtyard with a fountain in the center with small bistro tables surrounding it.
As he lowered himself onto Cas cock, Dean met and held Cas’ eyes. They weren’t the color of the Kansas sky... now, they were dark, like the lake in early summer. How many others fell in love with them? Countless teenagers? Fans from all over the globe? He wanted to be the only one to see Cas like this though. The only one to take him inside...
“That sounds like fun.”
Inside the library, he quickly assessed the situation. The new man in town and Lilith Carrigan were in a heated argument, but he didn’t see any sign of an actual fight. His gaze took in his daughter, who was currently standing behind ‘sexy orange boxer guy’, and his brother, ready and waiting with his notepad for a story.
“Someone?” Cas looked up at him, hands poised above the final row of puffs.
It took them five minutes to figure out a set dollar amount with all Cas additions and subtractions, then the hard part began. Cas kept trying to throw in stuff from the farm like eggs and cheese, but Dean was adamant. No free stuff. Then, he didn’t like most of Dean’s suggestions. There was nothing wrong with PBJs for lunch. “Cas, look, I know you’re a chef, but the only seafood those on SNAP get is tuna in a can.”
“Sure, Cas.” Dean looked sincere. Castiel didn’t know if he was relieved or disappointed.
“I don’t have a Plan B,” Castiel said softly.
“Miss Sands? I’m Deputy Winchester. I’m here to ask you a few questions about your friend, Lilith Carrigan.”
He shrugged and shook his head. “I’m sorry. I’m used to working with animals, so my people skills are a bit rusty.”
“Sure we can…” Again, Dean’s mouth snapped shut. Cas’ anger was gone and in its place was a sadness so deep, Dean was sure he was drowning. “Cas… babe…”
Castiel didn’t bring any extra clothes, so he wore the same suit he’d worn at the taping. He’d brought one extra shirt to fly home in, so it would have to do. He hoped he wouldn’t spill anything on it tonight.
“No, Dean.” He reached out his hand and found Dean’s. He gave his fingers a squeeze and then started the Jeep. He needed to hold his child.
“He’s right. Stop by anytime.”
“Cas...” Dean whimpered. How was this even happening. How had this gone from him playfully teasing the professor to this feeling of utter need?
“10-4, Boss.”
“I have tortoises.” The boy’s eyebrows came together in a confused frown. “Turtles,” Castiel said, knowing the child wouldn’t know the difference.
Dean leaned his head back on the seat and closed his eyes. Was he being dismissed? Castiel sat stiffly, unable to keep his eyes off Dean. “You’re thinking too loud,” Dean mumbled.
The fandom got some devastating news today. We can do two things - we can cry and rant or we can make the last season perfect for our favorite actors. We can go to Cons and cheer for them, laugh with them, be the family they created. That's what I am choosing to do.
“Hmmm, I am crazy about you, ya know?”
“What do you want from me?”
“Excuse me?” Castiel asked, confused.
“All in a day’s work, son.” Frank looked down at him and his smile was gentle. Crap, he didn’t need this shit. “Castiel...”
“No. They didn’t care for my… sexual orientation,” Castiel stated softly.
“One minute,” Cas relented and turned to leave. Dean got out of the car to wait. Cas came out about five minutes later with Lola on her leash. She saw him and began to dance around Cas, but his firm command made her calm instantly.
“Oh, we never married. Her mom and I were a good thing for all of three months. She didn’t like my job and her parents... well, let’s just say, they didn’t think I could take care of their daughter. We did the co-parenting thing and it worked out pretty damn good until... until she was killed. Car accident,” Dean answered before the question arose.
The djinn rolled his neck and stretched out his legs. Castiel watched patiently as the five Council members made themselves comfortable. Finally, Mahto flicked out his forked tongue. “We are pleased at your loyalty to the Council, Castiel. Your diligence has paid off and the prophecy has become history.” He pressed a hidden button on the table and a much smaller door to their right opened. Castiel recognized the Navajo man, a skin-walker and appointed scribe to the Council. He carefully sat at a small table and picked up his quill. Without looking up, he held up his left palm and stabbed the end into his flesh. All Council scripture was written in blood. Castiel began.
“Who was he? Your boyfriend?”
“We don’t. Yet. One was missing from the house. It could be a coincidence or random theft,” Dean stated.
A loud scream came from the kitchen and Gabe jumped to his feet. “Claire must be getting antsy. Hang on.” Gabe pushed through the door and disappeared.
Castiel looked around his new home with his hands on his hips. Everything was finally put away, the last box of books was put on the shelving units, and he finally had a weekend to relax. The knock at the door startled him out of his thoughts. He didn’t know anyone in town yet, except for a few of his co-workers.
Cooking calmed his nerves so he threw himself into whipping up a great lunch. When Cas made his way back to the kitchen, Dean had the ingredients for fish tacos on the counter. He nodded to the cutting board and chef’s knife beside him. “Can you cut up the cabbage for slaw?” At his indignant look, Dean laughed. “Dumb question.”
He was not surprised to see the crowded halls when he returned to the main floor. Missouri was well respected. The majority of the Council would be here to attend her final rites. He inclined his head to the guards by the High Council’s offices. “Madame Tran will see me,” he told them. One spoke into the communication device strapped to his wrist.
“Yeah, I thought I was marrying the most perfect man in the world tomorrow. What a coincidence.”
Cas snatched the phone out of Dean’s hand. “Wait… who are you calling?”
The sun was setting when Dean entered his kitchen. He’d put a roast in the crockpot and the aroma made his mouth water. He looked at the clock on the wall. Sam would be there soon.
“I’m sure you are pleased, but…”
“Sorry, just remembered I need to talk to Dad about my plans to stay on one of the rigs.” He’d already talked to his brothers about it but had yet to clear it with his father. Castiel wanted to write a research paper on the effects of oil rigs on marine life in the gulf. Before Michael could respond, Castiel turned around and headed to his father’s office.
“I skimmed over it.” God, he sounded like a shit father. That essay got her picked for this trip. That fucking essay got her into the program she’d dreamed about since she was a little girl.
“My dad is a great cook, owns his own business, and drives the coolest car.”
, he filled out those boxer briefs. He really did have an awesome body.
“Nagging is so unbecoming…” Dean said, picking up the offending items and stuffing them into the wicker hamper he’d found at Pier One.
“Indeed.” Dean saw the twitch of Cas’ lips.
Linda Tran was petite, but no one crossed her. She was a force to be reckoned with. Dean called her Tiger Mommy in secret. She’d been a helicopter parent to her son, Kevin, until he got a full ride to Yale. Now, she tended to try to mother Dean. “What time did you get in last night? I hope you got plenty of rest. That jet lag is nothing to ignore.”
The next morning, he went through the cabinets and refrigerator. He made a meal plan and a list of ingredients. When Sam stumbled down the stairs, Dean had bowls set out for cereal. “You know you don’t even have eggs, man.”
“No bacon?”
“That’s cool, I went to Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts in Austin. It was the best culinary school close to Kansas.”
“Cas sent me a text last night and said we’re over and not to come this weekend,” Dean had nothing to lose by telling Gabe. Who knows, maybe having Gabe on his side would help.
With the radio shoved in his breast pocket, Charlie waited for him to lock up and then showed him the game room slash living area. Several people were sprawled on the furniture or up playing pool. Dean was impressed to find a huge library of DVDs, a couple large TVs, and some comfortable couches.
A look of relief spread over Dean’s features and he poured the whiskey into his glass. It was a lot more than a typical shot, but Dean downed it easily. He smacked the glass on the counter and wiped his mouth. “Come on.”
“You lost the right to ask me those things when you…” Cas stopped. “Lola, let’s go.” The dog obediently turned to follow Cas, all the while looking back at Dean. She loaded up easily into the back seat of Cas’ Jeep Wrangler. She stuck her big head out of the window and gave a deep woof. He wanted to cry.
“And you, sir?” Dean knew he had the deer in the headlights thing going on because,
“If you touch him...” But he was talking to empty air.
Still grinning, Dean turned to leave. “Dean?”
The door to the house opened and Cas came out holding Claire. Dean couldn’t help the smile that broke through the ball of terror in his gut. That was his little girl.
“I thought you were a bug guy.”
“What?” Alfie asked, a look of confusion on his face. Dean figured he was definitely a virgin. He wanted to nix the conversation in the bud and tell the boys that it was none of their business, but he wanted intel too. He waited.
Dean heard a burst of excited chatter and looked back to where the teens were sitting. All looked like they were having fun by Audrey. She met his eyes and glared. Uh oh. Ben must be running his mouth and nothing good would come from that. She stood up and strode toward him. She was angry and he’d seen Cassie that way enough times to know he’d better think before he spoke.
“Hello.”
“Yes.”
“There’s only one cable provider in the area,” Frank said around a bite of omelet. He rattled off the name of the company and Castiel made a mental note of it.
“Most don’t, I suppose. I don’t drive very often because parking is a bitch. She spends most of her time in a garage. I take her out of the city sometimes. Just so I can open her up.”
Castiel wasn’t sure who moved those last few inches, but he found his mouth on Dean’s and all the lonely months and the pent-up frustrations of single fatherhood disappeared and all Castiel felt was wave after wave of need. Hot, wonderful need.
“Damn, I thought we were friends,” Dean said. He stood and picked up Castiel’s plate and cutlery. Friends? Castiel liked the warm feeling that word gave him.
His shower was quick and he dressed in clean jeans and a t-shirt. He wasn’t out to impress anyone. Not anymore. While he waited for his brother, he made a batch of biscuits and cooked some carrots to go with the roast. Potatoes were baking in the oven and he was pulling them out when the backdoor opened. "Smells great,” Sam said in way of greeting.
They weren’t that far from the airport when he fell asleep and it let Dean observe the man. His hair was chocolate brown and thick, unkempt too, like he’d been running his fingers through it... or someone else had. His eyes moved to the man’s left hand. No ring. How could someone that hot not be taken? Or maybe he didn’t wear a ring. It was kind of common for men.
Dean nodded and sighed. “I need to get to Crowley or else he’ll think something is up. Let me handle this alone okay? I know you want to come, but I don’t need you getting hurt right now.”
“I do indeed my dear, and I’ll tell you free of charge. All I ask is for one tiny favor.” The fiery-haired woman motioned with her hand pinching her finger together to emphasis her point.
“Just open me up already--fuck!” Castiel cried out suddenly as a finger breached his tight hole.
Dean looked up from the ancient tomb he was reading that he’d taken from Crowley’s library. “I’m looking for a spell that can get passed angel warding.”
She was propped up by pillows an abandoned book resting on her chest moving with every movement as she breathed shallowly. Her eyes were closed as she slept, dark circles like bruises cratered underneath now thin lashes, and her once vibrant red hair dulled into rust. Her omega scent was muddied, sick-smelling, the lilacs rotting with decay. She was dying Castiel realized with impending horror. “
“Cas? Cas!” Meg was shaking his shoulders her gaze frantic searching his blue eyes for a reaction.
Dean shrugged. “I’ll just give him a ride home, you can go ahead and leave.”
Dean startled almost dropping the child when it’s eyes flashed bright blue like an angel’s for a second before it disappeared. Dean hadn’t even noticed that his own eyes had flashed black back at it. Dean hummed in thought. “You know what I am don’t you? On a heavenly level I guess you know exactly what I am and that is why you don’t trust me.”
“Name it,” Lilith said excitedly. She could picture Castiel in her mind now tall, handsome, strong, till he breaks, and he breaks so beautifully. She wanted to play with him forever. She would break him over and over only to build him back up and rip him apart. She needed this more than her own life. She needed to see him break again.
“I will,” he whispered his voice trembling for a moment before he swallowed past the lump in his throat and jerked his head at his pack mate to follow him. Begrudgingly Meg stood following him silently into the hallway.
Castiel scowled at the ground. Those fucking idiots, did they really think he wanted to be the center of attention? His brother wanted the spotlight in everything, not Castiel. Castiel was introverted, preferred playing the piano, and drawing in his sketch book all by himself. He would rather stay in the shadows, not exposed for everyone to see.
Gabriel nodded. “As you should, no point on scaring your memory for life with the idea of how much I want in your brother’s pants.”
Castiel found himself impatiently waiting for the class to end, being so caught up in his thoughts that when a pair of hands landed on his hips, he completely jumped, crashing down onto the floor. The unmistakable sound of Dean Winchester’s laugh came behind him.
him there. There was no split decision in the middle of the fight for Castiel to turn rogue in order to save his life. He wasn’t near death, he was bruised, and his pride scorned, but he wasn’t about to die.”
Castiel stiffened an uncomfortable feeling washing over him something niggling at the back of his mind like a hangnail he could never get rid of. His wolf materialized next to her his expression murderous. “You don’t have to answer her.” He growled low and barely audible his fingers twitching like he was ready to attack her at any moment.
The demon smiled. “Would you like to know my name, Father? If I tell you my name will you tell me yours?” he sounded so sincere like he really wanted to know Castiel’s name.
Sam’s eyes opened wide, “How did you-”
“What do you want his soul for?” Dean asked his tone confused.
Dean cocked his head to the side chastising. “Don’t be so full of yourself, Sammy. ‘Cause see from where I’m sitting, there ain’t much difference from what I turned into and what you already are.”
Castiel breathed in sharply. “I don’t know, perhaps.”
Castiel whined in frustration. “I feel so full with you inside of me.” Dean thrust once watching Castiel closely waiting for more, “and I want more, so much more because I never want you to stop filling me like this.”
“So, Dean, are you going to be monopolizing my brother’s attention for long? ‘Cause I gotta leave for work here soon.” Gabriel said, turning his glance towards Dean.
“You notice that I tried to get as far away from you as possible? Away from your whining, your complaining. I chose the king of hell over you. Maybe I was just tired of babysitting you or always having to yank your lame ass out of the fire since forever. Or maybe it was the fact that my mother would still be alive if it wasn’t for you. That your very existence sucked the life out of my life.”
Castiel blushed bright red.“He’s my teacher, Gabriel.”
Gabriel giggled kicking out his feet and twisting trying to get out of Castiel’s hold. “Oh no you don’t. You need a bath you stinker.”
“You said the same about Lilith,” Castiel replied dully running his hands through his hair trying to take a deep breath as he looked around the green painted room wearily. Underneath the pictures of him were painted scenes of wolves running and howling, a desk covered in papers and books, a giant bookcase filled to the brim with novels, a dresser with a large tv sitting atop it, and three doors leading Gods know where. His eyes settled on the four poster bed where the tempting smell emanated the most and shook as a shiver ran down his spine the want to bury his face in the pillows once more tempting.
The woman grinned. “Then we have so work to do, dear. We don’t want Dean messing with your mind again. My name is Rowena why don’t we take you somewhere better than this place, hmm?"
His wolf huffed and Castiel shoved at his consciousness with all his might stumbling as he came back into control falling face first into a tree root his nose snapping on the impact. “Fuck!” Castiel hissed reeling back and clutching his face as blood began pouring down his face in gushes.
“Dean has a brother? Oh man, I bet he’s as sexy as Dean is.”
Castiel nodded his eyes shinning with determination. Dean smiled warmly, “I called you my little lamb, but I think you’re so much more than that. No, you are my little
Dean’s eyes flashed with excitement and want. “You mean that, Cas?”
Castiel snorted. “Well, that backfired, people would threaten me to stay away from you.”
Castiel laughed chasing after his crawling one year old toddler swooping him up into his arms. “Did you really think you could escape bath time?”
Chuck sighed shaking his head again. “They can’t prove-.”
Dean grinned. “Looking for this?” Dean pulled from behind his back the sleek demon blade his eyes flashing black at the sight of it.
“Why do you flinch boy?” He asked and Castiel pinned him with a look.
Dean shrugged walking towards the door winking at Castiel. “I’ll consider it.” Dean threw his knife at Castiel it landing with a sharp thud next to Castiel head. Castiel screamed after Dean, but the demon didn’t turn back.
Gabriel shrugged. “Never stopped people before, and besides you’re eighteen, so it’s perfectly legal.”
“I’ve fed you, I’ve changed your diaper, and I’ve given you toys. What do you want?” Dean hissed his son just sniffled and cried some more.
“I know now what had been going on, at the time I was under Rowena’s spell, and that’s cost me a great many things including my wife, my sons, and potentially my daughter. That night I did beat Castiel, I’d left him lying on the ground in a submissive position, but I did leave him there. I’ve heard his version of the story and Gabriel can confirm that I did
“Come on, Sammy, stop distracting my students and teach them your spiritual crap.”
“I always see him, Meg, always, and I was fine but… I lost control.” He admitted weakly looking down at his bare feet the cold ground making them go numb just as numb as the rest of him already felt
Hannah cocked her head in thought. “I think that he would have gotten a kick out of that. An outcast just like him being named after him. I think it fits well. What about a middle name?”
Castiel whimpered and looked the demon in the eyes. “God’s love is the only love I need.”
Castiel nodded sighing heavily. “Okay, okay Hannah. Thank you for all of your help.”
Castiel pushed himself up kissing Dean as if his life depended on it. Dean lubed up his cock quickly and slowly pushed in wanting nothing more than to feel Cas all around him. Castiel moaned loudly when Dean bottomed out falling back against the matrass looking up and Dean with heavy lusted filled eyes.
“Don’t move.”
Castiel glared at those green eyes in annoyance. “Do you have a better plan? If so, by all means, share it, because even though you don’t give a damn if our son lives or dies I do. So instead of being snarky why don’t you put something out there that would actually help us.” Castiel was now in Dean’s face, and he didn’t even care that he was no longer an angel. He didn’t care that if Dean so desired with a flick of his hand he’d be pinned to a wall and unable to move. He really just didn’t give a fuck.
Gabriel huffed and grabbed Castiel’s hand, slapping a two small packets into his hand. “You can never be unprepared.”
Sam let out a long sigh. “He’s not dead, Cas. The mark of Cain it turned him into a demon just like it did to Cain. He’s alive, Cas.”
“I’ll answer your question if you answer mine. What did you want with the child?”
Castiel was surprised to find that Dean ignored his own straining erection in favor of letting Castiel come down from his orgasm. Kissing and sucking along his back as his hands wandered over Castiel’s body, adding enough pressure to almost have a massaging effect.
Dean kicked the doors in when the bond pulled violently at him. Dean snarled at the salt line on the floor. “Stay back demon! You’ve killed two of us already and defiled another. Leave now or I will exorcise you!”
She stared at him long and hard wiping the tears from her face biting out angrily. “You will get help this time. I don’t care what your wolf has to say. Mary recommended a doctor who can really work with you, and help you manage being a rogue. If you go through all of this Mary promised she could get every charge the Rogue council has gathered on you dropped.” Her voice was filled with conviction, but he shook his head.
“I don’t know if you’ve noticed but your son is going bat shit. His wolf was trying to take over and not just briefly, but permanently. He’s getting worse, and he won’t get help. All this because you shacked up with some whore and couldn’t stop beating your son.” Meg snarled her own instincts itched to rip the alpha’s throat out. It didn’t look hard, then the man before her was half the man he had been.
“Wow, straight to the point, baby girl.”
television. It became his mantra. He got through the segment with his dignity intact. He even lightened up enough to attempt a humorous comment to Dean. All in all, his segment wasn’t as bad as he’d anticipated.
“Uh, yes.” If he only knew what Castiel ate on missions. Military rations, lamb and bean stew, and Mejadra on good days, goat jerky and prepackaged trail mix on bad ones.
Calls made, Bobby sighed heavily and turned toward Castiel. “Where are you taking them... no, don’t answer that.” Castiel knew Bobby was having the same thoughts as he. If the demons or witches got to Bobby, they could torture him into giving information. It was better if he didn’t know anything.
“It’s a hotel. They kind of expect jizz to happen. You don’t want to get UV light in places like this. You’d never stay...”
“Yes, sir. Right away, sir.” Dean saluted and turned grabbed a sauté pan from the stack. Soon, the smell of steak sizzling in butter filled the kitchen. Dean flipped the small fillet in the air and caught it easily.
She bowed to Nazari and laced her arm through Castiel’s. Billie fell in behind them and Tran addressed her. “We don’t need your company, Captain.”  Castiel could almost feel the ire radiating off the guard. He almost smiled. Tran’s next words stole any amusement he’d felt. “Your flesh is warm to the touch. A pulse beats under your skin. What has happened?”
“That, and because my brother wanted to see what the fuss was about. It is a pretty cool place. Ever been?”
He pushed the door open, and Dean’s stare broke to take in the room. HIs tongue came out to lick his lips and Castiel inhaled sharply. He told the voice in his head to shut up and pushed Dean inside. The door slammed behind him, and their mouths met in a crushing kiss. Dean’s hands were warm on his cool skin. They seemed to be everywhere. On his hips, his chest, his shoulders. Dean tasted of mint and Castiel couldn’t stop his tongue from invading... taking...
Not wanting to push Dean, he gathered his laptop bag and slung it over his shoulder, before gathering the groceries. “Goodnight, Dean.” He closed the door and made his way to his room, mind turning over and over.
It wasn’t a question and Dean didn’t treat it like one. “And thirds,” he said honestly. “But not about us... not that. It’s just... fuck.”
“Not sure if that’s going to happen. Marv hates me.” Marv Armstrong, the mayor of Coosa Falls was a nasty, little man. He hated Dean on principal alone because Dean had never done anything to the man. He’d barely spoke to him in the five years since he’d moved to the little town to be closer to his brother.
“Duh. You came out to me before I could get up my nerve, Dad.” That was true. After Kelly died of ovarian cancer when Jack was only fourteen, Castiel became a full-time father. They never married, but he’d always taken his responsibilities seriously and did his part to help raise the boy. Once Jack moved in, Castiel sat him down and explained that while he’d thought he loved Kelly, he always identified as a gay man. Jack told him right afterward that he found boys attractive. Throughout the years since, he and Jack shared many conversations about sex and sexual identity.
, trust me, I
“Yeah, well, you’re memorable,” Dean said sarcastically. She didn’t catch it. She laughed and swatted his arm playfully. “Look, I need your help with something.” And being the good detective he was, he played good cop. Bad cop would come later.
“Romantic? Dean, we were role playing. I was the big bad cop and you were the sexy prostitute. Sexy, yes. Romantic, not so much.”
Comm: Communications room where all rig to shore communication is made. The Comm guys keep up with weather, etc.
Cas looked him in the eye. “Maybe you do have ‘cooties’, Dean.” Dean could almost picture the air quotes.
With the presents wrapped at a professional level of skill, the two men headed upstairs. In the bathroom, Dean picked up his toothbrush and then glared into his sink. “Did you shave over my sink?”
"It's along the same lines as a jalapeno popper. I slice open an okra pod and stuff it with cream cheese mixed with bacon pieces. Then I dip it in an egg wash, roll in panko crumbs, and fry until golden." Castiel began to cut open the vegetables.
Dean watched as Castiel closed his eyes and inhaled the aroma. “You are a genius.”
“For it to do any good, you gotta soak your turkey for twelve to twenty-four hours. If you baste, there isn’t any added time. I just tuck lots of butter under the skin...” Dean removed his hand, so he could use both to demonstrate on his bird. “Not to mention, you have to find a place to put that.” He pointed his greasy finger at the huge stock pot that held Castiel’s turkey.
"Yeah, well, I just wanted to bring you this and say I'm sorry again." Dean held out the box and before he could take it, Claire grabbed it. "Purty," she repeated. Castiel saw the tag for Angels & Demons. The chocolatier was his guilty pleasure. How had Dean known?
Castiel walked to the leather chair in front of the director’s desk and sat. He waited. Cain continued his observation of the world outside of his window, hands clasped behind his back. Cas’ were curled around the armrests. Finally, Cain turned. He exhaled and sat in his plush chair. Only then did he meet Castiel’s gaze. “I’ve read the reports. Care to share why my best operative allowed himself to get drunk in a bar... in Caracas... while on a fucking mission?”
“I need to see about getting Internet and I thought I’d check out the library for some local history.”
Cas’ fingers threaded through his hair, tugging almost painfully.
“I know pie was your favorite dessert.” Dean nodded and looked away. This was too much. He didn’t belong here. Not in this
Missouri's words:
Dean read over it twice before pressing send. He made himself scarce since both Sam and Eileen were off on Sundays too. He did laundry and took a drive over to the mall. He purposefully kept his phone off. He knew Cas would text back or even try to call and Dean had to be strong. He couldn’t risk this job.
“Dean... Dean Winchester. I hate that he ruined your dessert. It was a pretty cake.” The cake in question was now flattened and smeared all over the table. Dean knew it was ground into the back of his shirt.
“No, I’m not. Dean’s been having dreams of you all his life. I swear to you. He saw you turn rogue; you chose to turn rogue to try and defeat your father and then he beat you within an inch of your life.
Sam groaned, “God dammit Dean why did it have to be him?”
“You shouldn’t have done that,” Sam spoke the accusation slurred into those words. Sam didn’t miss anything, the emotions he felt sometimes spoke louder than the thoughts Dean could hear. He’d felt Dean’s pain at seeing a mate that recoiled from him, but he could feel Castiel’s confusion, and Meg’s grief as if it was his own. He had to filter through so many emotions that sometimes he couldn’t help but defend the feelings he felt.
Dean’s head snapped up. “I’ve got what?”
Castiel whimpered and pressed his face into Dean’s chest, “Dean it hurts so badly.”
“He will try to be whatever you need him to be, but he’s already perfect the way he is. He’s dark enough to look into the depths of our soul and be unafraid, but light enough to find hope when we have none. He’s… perfect.” The wolf murmured softly looking away from Castiel and back to where Dean had disappeared into the forest.
“Look at yourself, Castiel. Look at how well you’re taking my fingers inside you. Do you think you’re ready, Cas? Do you think you’re ready for my fat cock now?”
The woman’s crimson lips curled into a smile cupping the druids head a warmth spreading from her fingers. “Oh, I know him, dear. He fancies your Castiel for himself. I can ease the wounds the omega created, but I can’t fix them in their entirety. At least you’ll be able to function.”
Dean smirked. Priests always thought they were so smart, but they always kept things in plain sight. Always. Dean hoped up onto the marble base pushing into the cut out wood watching as the floor parted before him to reveal stone steps leading down to where Castiel was no doubt being held.
Anna shifted then perhaps picking up on his souring scent as her eyes fluttered open her expression weary before lighting up like a lighthouse in the middle of the night. “You came.” Her weak voice came in a high soprano, and her smile was brilliant in a face too thin to be healthy.
Sam rolled his eyes. “May I remind you that you know how to do this ‘spiritual crap’. Why don’t you two go find mats, and we’ll begin the class. Alright, everyone, we’re going to start with the basics. Dean and I will come around and correct your poses.”
She growled and he glanced up at her now yellow eyes her expression angry. “I know that, Castiel. I am fully aware of the extent of your feelings for me.” She snarled getting up in his personal space. “That doesn’t change anything for me though. I will continue to look at you every day and think about how much I love you, that there isn’t anything I wouldn’t do for you. Just because you don’t feel the same for me doesn’t make my feelings invalid. I have never pushed them on you and I still haven’t. Don’t take my concern as an attempt to make a move on you. I can love you from afar, and still, have normal concern for you. I’m glad you’re being more rational but excuse me if I’m not at least a little bit worried by the sudden change in behavior.” She stalked off and Castiel followed behind her silently. It was a fair point; she’d never come onto with him with unwanted advances. While they’d talked about her feelings before she never expected anything from him, but he couldn’t imagine this was easy for her.
Hannah made a face. “A girl’s name?”
The feel of the room changed as they stared into one another’s eyes their bodies inches apart, so close they could feel the heat radiating off of the other. Castiel watched the omega’s tongue as it darted out licking his lips with a flash of pink. Castiel pulled away from the omega stumbling back as a wave of arousal overcame him the room smelling of not only his arousal but the omega’s as well.
“There’s five minutes left, everyone. Why don’t you all go get changed. Have a great weekend.”
Dean snorts. “He’s going to expect that. We’ve summoned and trapped him many times. Don’t you think it’s a little redundant now?”
“Please answer the question, Meg,” Castiel replied his heart hammering in his chest he needed to hear this.
The sound of Sam’s movements slowed as he said, “Go away? What are you talking about, Cas?”
“I’m pregnant Sam. I’m not going to tell you how that’s even possible, but it’s Dean’s. When it’s born I’ll be human, and it will be Nephilim which means it will be hunted. I need to go into hiding. I just thought you should know.” Castiel whispered.
All his plans for being smooth and charming went up in smoke as soon as he saw Cas holding the child in his arms. He wasn't going to be able to get Cas alone. No asking him out for a drink. No dinner plans. Definitely not a trip back to his hotel for a nightcap. But he'd come all this way...so, yeah, it was supposed to be for the show and he had done the segment. Still, he only came to Atlanta because Cas lived here.
Dean couldn’t take his eyes away from it. The way Cas moved his hand up and down his own cock. He made a note to himself to ask Cas to jerk off for him someday soon. It would be so fucking hot. Cas shifted position to line himself up with Dean’s hole and Dean lifted his ass to help. “Ahhh,” he gasped as the thick head breeched his body. Then he was inside... all of him... Dean wrapped his ankles around Cas’ hips and dug his heels in. Cas got his slow torture, now it was his turn. “Fuck me, Cas. Hard and dirty, babe.”
Dean laughed. “If he wasn’t complaining about something, I’d really worry. The man is brilliant, but fuck, is he crotchety.”
Castiel nodded, unable to speak for fear that he’d say something that would break the bubble around them. Dean picked up Claire and kissed her forehead. “Dee will miss you, princess.”
“I’m sure...”
He had his phone in his hand when Crowley stuck his head in the room. “Novak. Good, you’re still here. Your boyfriend passed me a note to give to you.”
“Ellen said him and some little minute of a girl showed up this morning for breakfast. She said he looked just like his pictures on Google.”
Thank God, he was wearing a shirt now. Even if it was a very tight t-shirt with AC/DC logo across the front. He carried the gym bag and a leather jacket. Dean brushed against Castiel as he exited the room and Castiel’s breath caught in his throat.
His smile was perfect and Castiel wanted... no, needed, to ask him inside, but he knew better. “I’d like that. Tomorrow?”
“Let’s get this hunk of meat in your boat.” Dean watched as the man got behind the wheel and guided the truck up next to Dean’s boat.  The water came up over the vehicle’s axles.
“No one says you can’t retire before election day, man,” Dean said, sitting down in the cracked leather chair that was probably as old as he was.
The moment broken, Cas eased himself out and rolled to his back. Dean winced at the sudden emptiness. Yeah, he’d be sore for a while. He closed his eyes, refusing to watch Cas get out of bed. Neither spoke throughout their separate showers and dressing. Dean took his phone into the living room to check messages while Cas packed. He found himself staring out the window instead. He thought a long-distance thing would be perfect. Easy.
. He closed his eyes and waited for his heart to shatter. Another kiss, this one against his jaw. Okay, so he was letting him down gently. Considerate bastard. “New York is where your life is. Atlanta has never been my home. It was just the most logical choice after Anna died. Gabe doesn’t need me and I can probably find a job up here.” Dean was holding his breath. Did this mean...
In the evenings, in Cas’ hotel room, they studied social media and news channels for reports of missing pets, livestock, and people. Most of the reports could be explained away because they weren’t near bodies of water. A few needed to be investigated.
“Good choice.” The bartender began making Castiel’s drink. “You must not live around here.”
“Right as rain,” Meg said, holding out the paperwork. “A rep from the orphanage is on their way to pick her up.” Cas’ hand fell, not taking the clipboard.
“To your car,” Ketch said, looking bored at the grunt detail. He’d also been the one to meet Castiel at the airport and hustle him to an undisclosed location, a seedy hotel west of the city.
“You didn’t come here to chat about the view,” Castiel said, unwilling to give Dean pleasant conversation after the morning they’d both endured. He watched as Dean seemed to be having an internal argument by the scowl on his face.
“Yes,” Castiel whispered. Fingers wrapped around him and his mind blanked. The sensation was
Clyde seemed to be taking an innocent stroll behind Dean, but Castiel knew him well. Halfway to the tank, the big goat made his move. The blow from the rear sent Dean face first into the dirt. “Ow,” Balthazar said with a chuckle. The buck pawed at the ground, but Castiel’s whistle had him running back toward the females.
Cas looked at Dean for a moment and Dean gave him a slight nod. Those baby blues turned to Sam. “This morning, Dean was called out for an animal attack on some cattle. When we got there, Dean assumed it was from a cougar or maybe feral dogs, but after inspecting the remains, I concluded that the bite radius was that of an extremely large alligator. I found the tracks and I am guessing the creature is over twenty feet in length.”
“This car seat... did you make sure it was the safest? Cause I gotta tell you, all it took was one button and poof, she’s free.”
Unwilling to show Sam and Eileen how the day of rejections was affecting him, he whipped up a nice dinner and had it ready to serve when Eileen got home from the newspaper. She breezed into the kitchen, grinning. “It smells wonderful.”
His two co-stars and the producer looked at him in confusion. "Yes, Dean, Atlanta. Do you ever listen to me?" Crowley asked peevishly.
“Bullshit. You couldn’t keep it in your pants. I’ve warned you about fucking the staff.”
With school in session, the zoo wasn’t overly crowded and Dean enjoyed being incognito. No one paid attention to the two men bundled against the cold. It wasn’t until they got to the penguin exhibit that Cas surprised him by laughing. He watched the cool, little birds with rapt attention. Dean kept his eyes on Cas. He loved how the other man’s eyes crinkled at the corner when he smiled. Damn, he was in way too deep.
“I don’t know what you just said, dude.”
Dean opened his mouth, but Crowley held up his hand. “I honestly don’t give a rat’s ass. Just make sure it doesn’t happen tomorrow or your next episodes will be playing games with soccer moms and pussy-whipped husbands.” He stomped off before Dean could speak. A feral growl came from the chastised host and he stormed off, leaving Castiel with Benny and the members of the crew in charge of cleaning the set.
“Do you need a ride home?” Frank and Mildred had been released and had left a short time ago. Victor was rounding up his team to leave and Castiel knew they’d be in DC before dinnertime.
