An all-too familiar ache built up inside him. Every time Cas died it wrecked Dean, but none more so than the last.
The cool touch of a marble statue presses against Dean’s fingertips, memory resurfacing. The fire inside him is quickly replaced by ice, breaking off and spreading into his bloodstream.
“I just… I’m sorry, Cas. I didn’t know. I didn’t know about you, or me, I just got there to the Empty and it was like I couldn’t—Oh, my god.” Dean stares off into space.
Dean opens his eyes again crankily and does as he’s told. Cas moves his finger all around in front of Dean’s face, tracking Dean’s eyes as they follow it.
“I can’t bring Jack on the drives with me, so I need a new source of income. Anna lent me some money; the rest I’ll borrow from the bank.”
Cas’s look of exasperation grows deeper and deeper as Dean shops. He just doesn’t understand that it’s a tricky thing, buying a hat and boots. It’s not as if Dean was getting a closet full of them. He was only getting one hat and one pair of boots, so they had to be just the right ones, and they had to match. Dean looks at quite a few. Cas, meanwhile, refuses to so much as try on any of the hats. “Don’t be ridiculous,” he protests roughly when Dean offers him one. Dean rolls his eyes towards the salesman,
Donna already agreed to cover the bar for him tomorrow; he had to let her work tonight. Poor girl needed commission money, too.
Dean stops, suddenly unsure what to do. Only air and Sister Jo between them, and it feels far too close.
Cas can hear Dean’s shallow breaths hitting the floor. He takes a moment to breathe and reminds himself that Dean likes this. It’s just pretend. It’s okay.
Dean considers this, considers all the twists and turns of his own emotions and sexuality that he still didn’t really understand. “Yeah. Since… since forever. I don’t know when.”
“Then I’ll take real good care of you.” Dean kisses Castiel’s tip. He puts his mouth around Castiel, just barely sucking, just pulling his lips along Castiel’s shaft and getting him wet with spit. He pops off the end and looks back up at Castiel. “Anything in particular I can do for you, sweetheart?”
Dean stops there. Dean has to stop there, to proceed would be far too much, too fast. But Cas just looks back at him, uncomprehending, and it brings a lump to Dean’s throat and a quiver to his lips. He has to say it.
Cas takes Dean’s hand and moves it to his own shoulder, encouraging Dean to come in close. In general, Dean’s very comfortable with being naked and being watched, often at the same time. But something about Cas’s eyes makes him feel even more exposed than that, like Cas is looking straight into his soul. “I have been meaning to kiss you,” Cas confesses.
Cas can’t touch Dean while they wrestle with his pants and underwear, but eventually they get kicked to the floor and he and Dean are lying together again, naked now, much more comfortable than before, and he can look at Dean, touch Dean as much as he wants—
A shiver of panic. The word, a leftover from his fantasy, had slipped out before Dean could bite it back, but Cas doesn’t recoil. He just growls affirmation against Dean’s lips. As if he likes it. Hell.
Dean’s heart skitters at the word, and any grim metaphors evaporate from his mind. “Even that I’m a whore?”
“Say you’re mine,” Cas instructs, not angry, almost routine-sounding. It takes Dean’s breath away anyhow.
Dean takes the card. It has a personal telegraph number simply labelled McLeod, Boston, MA. “What he done, this guy?” Dean asks.
“You saw how long my list was, and then you wrote me a letter with no personal information about you whatsoever.”
It doesn’t matter if Cas can love him. All that matters is that he is back, and this time around, there is no Darkness, no Lucifer, no apocalypse. There is loss, plain and simple, and there is Jack, but Jack at least doesn’t want to kill them all— not yet anyway— and maybe this win would stick. Maybe they’d finally be happy.
Cas aligns himself carefully over Dean’s hips. Dean checks again that he’s good, and Cas confirms before lowering down and rubbing against his tip.
too much emotion all at once. Cas’s fingers crook inside Dean’s hole, making him shudder and groan. His cock is so sensitive, Cas’s tongue smooth and wet.
They each take their shot. It’s midday, which is morning for Dean, and Charlie isn’t much of a drinker, but she doesn’t object as Dean starts pouring a second round. Shit.
“Oh, Dean,” Cas wants to communicate it, but doesn’t have words. “That feels— ohh.” He can’t talk. He’s gone. He leans back, lets Dean take him away. If this was the future, every mistake of the past was worth it.
“Cop out,” Dean accuses, but comes forward anyway, kissing Cas and reaching a hand down into his lap—
Dean shifts a bit, and it makes a horrible sound as they un-stick and then re-stick in the heat. “How ‘bout the fact that we’re cuddling in a godawful Texas summer?” Dean jokes.
And then Cas is standing and holding him in his arms. That, more than anything, makes the tears come: that Cas had seen it in his face, whatever this feeling was, and given him kindness for it. It’s made worse by the fact that he can see Balthazar, watching him over Cas’s shoulder, but it’s too late to save face; the dam is broken and feelings are rushing out. He clenches Cas’s shirt tight in his fists and buries his face in his neck and sobs. He sobs and sobs he doesn’t know how long. At some point he can even feel Bal’s hand on his shoulder, an awkward attempt at comfort that almost makes him laugh. Cas’s hands are better, broad and warm and surrounding him as he gulps down inhospitable Texas air. “I miss them,” he says finally, emotions settling there, in his chest. “God, I miss them.” He’s been missing them for five years, every fucking day. And every day, his heart felt just like this, sore from galloping and hurting all the time. He’s fatigued, in his bones and his chest and all the way down to his soul, but he’s not exhausted. He’ll never be exhausted of this feeling, and he’ll never leave Abilene again.
Dean nods, heart still hammering. He claps Benny on the shoulder. Benny claps him on the back. He goes.
“Break time?” Dean proposes. “The house has a private washroom. Might could get some of this grit off of you. Unless we need to get to your big plans.”
with their sexual experimentation, exactly, in fact according to Dean everything went well, but Cas had had a hard time causing Dean pain, even if it had made Dean happy. He’d found excuses to avoid it ever since.
Cas doesn’t know what his true happiness is yet, exactly, outside of dreams and fantasies, but he has a feeling Dean Winchester saying ‘I love you’ would probably get him there. It’s one of his favorite—and most painful—fantasies.
“Opium,” says Balthazar immediately, without thinking. “Only I’d go somewhere terribly inconvenient first. I think I’d like to get absolutely plastered, fuck an anti-semite’s wife, and then light up in their bed. You?”
“What’s this like?” Dean asks, as if he doesn’t already know. As if he can’t see Castiel’s arousal plain as day between his folded legs. As if the sweep of Castiel’s eyes over his body doesn’t make him feel the memory of teeth pressing into his skin.
“Good.” Dean switches to kissing Cas’s shoulder, which flexes subtly beneath him as Cas draws. It wasn’t a bad place to be, really. Not bad at all.
“Dean,” Charlie chides before Adam can fire a response. “Adam— just sit. Will you just sit? And Dean will tell us what happened, and we can all move on with our stressful lives?”
“And what’ll you do with me then, Cas? What will you do with me, in the dark, while everyone’s sleeping, when you have me all to yourself?”
A few times that night, Dean can’t help but read it again, in between clients, sitting on the bed in room three and scanning Cas’s looping, black words.
“You done anything I should be warned about?” Dean asks, trying to keep his tone fun, not really asking but trying to say:
“—Said you’d be quiet, didn’t you?” Dean lifts up to meet Cas’s gaze. Cas lowers himself back to the rug. He should go. He should really have gone.
Cas sighs. “If you’d’ve told me a year ago that I’d be waiting on a male gentile whore from Texas, I wouldn’t have believed you.”
begging, because Cas had said he wasn’t hiding from his father, that he was only protecting him for the sake of the election, and so what would happen after that? If they made it to November, and Cas’s father forgave him and—
Dean isn’t sure he can do this. Cas is staring, waiting, and meanwhile Dean has to pick up the remains of his melted brain and try to mush them into shape.
The situation is too familiar to Dean, and to us. This has been Chuck’s will from the beginning— brother versus brother. Sam comes to it with FAITH, Dean with DESPERATION and DOUBT. Sam rears back, we watch his knife as he prepares to strike—
“You want this, don’t you, you pervert?” Cas murmurs, tapping Dean’s cheek with the crop. “It isn’t going to be a good punishment at all, is it?” He’s going off-script, but only slightly. If he doesn’t dole out ‘punishments’ then Dean can’t control when he gets the crop. “I asked you a question,” says Cas, raising the crop high. Sure enough, Dean doesn’t speak, but flinches in anticipation instead.
How to say this— Writing isn’t fun. It’s work. It takes blood, sweat, and tears. It isn’t easy being me, you know. But sometimes, in creation, there’s a moment, where things become easy. The words just… flow. And they’re better than any other words you’ve written before. I enjoy that part.
“Could make you work for it. Could bruise you, bite you. Could truss you up from the ceiling, just like you was gonna do to me.”
The night before, eight-year-old Sammy had confronted John with tears in his eyes, demanding to know what had happened.
“I’m sorry about the other day,” Dean says, needing to get that out of the way as he follows Bobby into the little dimly lit room.
Oh, hell. Dean falls back onto the bed, eyeing Castiel in surprise and a little bit of wonderment. “Alright.”
“No? Then tell me, feathers, while I, a fiend, as you say, from the bowels of Hell itself, assist you with finding and defeating the single greatest threat to humanity in the world today, where exactly is your flannel-clad degenerate? Off having an affair?”
“I don’t care,” says Cas irritably. “I’m not hiding. I only changed my name to avoid making any more scandals. I’m here to protect my father, not to run from anyone.”
They fall into the kiss easy as breathing. They kiss a long time, or rather Dean keeps kissing Cas for a long time. Cas soon enough finds the cloth in the tub, suds it back up and washes Dean, but Dean doesn’t move from his spot on top of Cas, kissing, lips happy to keep finding lips, kissing slowly, sweetly, Cas occasionally telling him to move and Dean generally complying. He sucks a few bruises into Cas’s neck, under where his collar usually goes, where his skin turns pale and pretty like porcelain. Cas used to look like that all over, out East. He used to sit in classrooms developing photos and studying chemistry and drawing naked people, all while pale as ivory. He used to have smooth, rich boy hands, and go to temple on Saturdays, and wear a little hat.
Dean rolls his shoulder out of Benny’s grip. What he doesn’t need is more people telling him what to do.
she adds loudly, so any girls in the house can hear, “maybe somebody ought to tell me about it.” She disappears inside, leaving Dean and Benny to stare at each other.
Dean’s gonna fuck him so good. “You wanna keep doing it like this? Or should I do something different?”
He’s interrupted by something pushing into his hole, but Cas isn’t even in position yet— it’s his hand. A finger, pushing in, curling up, unfamiliar and exquisite.
Cas shakes his head again. “You can’t ask me to—You can’t ask me to stand by and watch that.” Hell. This was it, wasn’t it?
She opens her big black eyes and Dean croons. “Hel-lo, baby girl.” He walks up and lets her have a sniff of his hand. “How old is she?”
Dean gets back down on the ground, facing toward Cas as if in prayer. Cas walks forward, taps Dean’s cheek lightly with the crop. He clicks his tongue disapprovingly.
He pants and stares up at Cas. At night, Cas’s eyes are black, twinkling only with moonlight. He looks just like stars.
Cas still doesn’t understand the question. They already were, weren’t they? Was there something he had missed, some other step? They loved each other. What else was there?
“And you?” Cas asks, finally at the end of the list. “How have you been?” God, his eyes were sweet. Dean clears his throat.
He means for Cas to keep doing what he’s doing, just reach one hand up to hold Dean’s while he does it, but Cas takes one look at him and crawls on top of him, taking his hand and pressing it into the pillow beside Dean’s head. “What is it?” he asks.
please, Dean, dear,” Balthazar says. “That name is ridiculous. And I say it is just as ridiculous for Cas to hide from him.”
Cas’s eyes are so freaking soft and beautiful and grateful. He lifts a hand to Dean’s neck and pulls Dean closer, tilting his head, and Dean goes, happily, to kiss his angel.
Jack continues talking, beginning to describe an encounter they’d had with Balthazar, when he’s interrupted by a loud yell from the hall.
“Sorry.” Dean quiets. He stares at Cas, shadowed and mysterious in the dark, under the live oaks. The wind blows through the leaves and dapples moonlight over the grass. It sends a chill through Dean; he reaches for one of the blankets and pulls it over them both.
“I—“ Cas looks off-put by the question, like he hadn’t thought that far ahead. “I want you to trust me. To rely on me.”
He doesn’t voice the thought. Not that he hadn’t enjoyed the fantasy plenty of times, but he’d never thought of it as something they’d actually do. He’d never thought of asking for it before.
“There, you can’t argue with that, can you?” says the brother, a little grouchy now. Probably upset that he hadn’t been offered the same discount.
Dean tackles him to the ground, spilling his dinner over them both, one hand firmly over Balthazar’s mouth. He pauses there, holding him down and making eye contact, ignoring the cries of protest from around him. Eventually Balthazar rolls his eyes and Dean gets off him to the tune of him grumbling about beans on his trousers.
1) He could attempt to sleep alone, in his own bed. (Sure to fail, if precedent was any sort of indicator.)
“Mm.” Cas agrees. He doesn’t move, doesn’t try to touch Dean or ask Dean to touch him. He looks so happy it doesn’t seem right to just climb on top of him, so Dean just sits there awkwardly.
Dean unlocks the cabinet under the bar and grabs them a bottle and two glasses, sliding a quarter into the cashbox.
“I just said it!” says Jack impatiently as he jumps from the stairs to the floor. So Jack didn’t think Cas was really his daddy. But Dean couldn’t get over how similar they were. Jack had such blue eyes.
They lie there, but they’re both wide awake, and Dean is starting to get fidgety by the time Cas speaks.
“No it ain’t,” he says, digging himself in. “It works good.” Should’ve just stolen some. Couldn’t steal any now she knew he was looking for it; she’d kick him out, and then where would he be.
“Nothing.” Dean isn’t ready to figure out what exactly had happened between him and Cas last night. He isn’t ready to wonder if he’ll see Cas again in six weeks or not.
“What was my momma telling you to go to hell for?” He says it accusatory, like it’s taboo, like it’s the sort of thing only a lover would say.
And John meets his eyes for the first time in five years. “There you are. Too afraid to come down and face me like a man? Let me ask you something, you pansy-ass piece of shit. Where the hell do you get off?”
“Did I tell you to talk?” Cas corrects harshly. He finishes tying the shoes and stands, examining Dean. “That’s better.” Cas reaches out with the crop, runs it gently over Dean’s backside, then taps him there. “Ass out. Show me what you have to offer.”
Meg’s voice is low and slow. She’s having a bit too much fun. “I like to add a little drama to the lives of those around me.”
Then Cas stands and picks his coat up off the floor, and for a second Dean thinks he’s going to leave, but instead he pulls a little leather booklet from the inside pocket and hands it to him. Dean unties it, and inside is a pile of telegrams, a couple of letters, and a huge pile of drawings, all of them Dean, mostly Deans on the range by the campfire, but plenty more, ones he’s never seen before, ones that he thinks might even be recent, their paper a bright cream color and the charcoal as-of-yet unsmudged. He flips through them til he gets to the bottom of the stack, where he finds the yellowest, stiffest page. On it is Dean in Cas’s old hat, laid out on that lumpy mattress in room three, tied to the headboard, covered in bruises and wearing frilly drawers.
“Watching you die,” Dean said, holding eye contact with Cas. “Every time I’ve ever had to watch you die. Cas, I can’t—“
Now it’s time to go hotwire his own car in broad daylight in a busy diner parking lot. Maybe Chuck’s gift to them as main characters extends to Dean as long as he’s in this time because no one sends him even a second glance. This time, ducked in the footwell, he notices a toolbox and a crowbar resting in the backseat, alongside some other sketchy supplies. What the hell did this owner do? Dean shakes it off and slides into his seat.
Dean shot him a dirty look and Cas laughed, dropping the air quotes and resting his hand on the steering wheel on top of Dean’s.
A corner of Cas’ mouth lifted. “I’m sure there’s a more angelic term. Jedi mind-wipe, maybe? It’s correction, apparently I’ve always been a bit of a rebel.”
“Kid, there’s no way you could have known we’d need it, and even if you did what could you have done? Don’t blame yourself.”
If he squints, he can see the little girl gently placing pink flowery band-aids all over his face, covering up the smallest wounds. Dean pauses for a moment, gripped by a tightness in his chest; he misses Jack’s childlike innocence, what he had before he was God. This time around Dean swears he’s going to let him act his age.
He doesn’t know if thought counts as part of the prayer—never got the courage to ask—but he hopes it does. From what he’s heard of the Empty, he doesn’t want Cas to be alone.
Cas smiled. “Well, you know what they say. ‘I’m your huckleberry.’” He didn’t put on the accent this time, just let the deep gravel of his voice resonate throughout the room. Dean swallowed hard.
They loaded the groceries back into the cart, this time bagged, and walked out to the Impala. Once the cart was emptied, Cas put it back in the store, and returned to the car to see Dean fiddling with the radio.
The urge to scrub at his skin bubbles up inside Dean, wanting to scrape off Chuck’s words. But he forces himself to keep the eye contact.
The grocery store was Cas’ favorite place to go now that he was human. Well, favorite place that wasn’t also a person. There was just something about all the fluorescent lights and the people quietly pushing along before returning to their own world. He knows that that food will be cooked, will be given to toddlers just starting to eat and to lovers having their own date night. In the grocery store he feels like an angel again, peering into all the bright souls.
The words rang out between them, settling over the room like morning dew. Without noticing he had stood during his monologue and he had braced himself against the table, leaning on his hands. Cas was sitting and just staring up at Dean, tears in his eyes and mouth hung open.
“I…” It’s not that Dean has nothing to say, but the weight of the words makes them sit like a rock in his chest, keeping him down. He pushes and pushes against them for some relief, some way to break the silence he’s been entombed in since the fire, but gravity always drags them back down. Even Sam asking the same has never gotten anything stronger than
Standing there, panting, he looked down at Cas, and saw how the imprint of his own body was marked in the grass next to him, a silhouette curled towards the angel. Dean wrenched his gaze away.
Of course, then fall crept in and life crept out of the field. There was still an abundance of green, but it was warring with the dying grass. The spot where he was sitting now was surrounded by withered stems when he knew there had once been flowers. A spider crawled its way up Dean’s boot and he tracked its path, only shaking it off when it tried to touch his skin.
Dean has never had words. Sure, he could use them as a weapon, a gun to point or a shield to deflect, but he could never use them to build something up, to create something beautiful. He’d try and he’d try but they’d always get stuck in his throat, mixed in with the ash that he swears still clings to his skin. To show that he cares, that he’s more than just a killer, action was always easier.
The song that had been playing, some Led Zeppelin track he’d listened to a thousand times over, fizzled out for a moment, before Robert Plant’s voice swayed back in. He frowned, reaching towards the dial to fiddle with it; even with Baby’s age, he’d never had problems with the radio.
Embarrassment threatens to wash over Dean, and he ducks his head, awkwardly rubbing one hand against his neck. “You taught me how. Well, it was a bit like you threw me in the deep end and forced me to either learn or drown, but beggars can’t be choosers.”
“Yeah,” Dean agrees, and they stare at each other for a moment. “Nobody ever said this was gonna be easy.”
But listen. I did put quite a bit of effort into getting the dialect "right," albeit with a fair amount of artistic license, and now, today, after the first chapter has been up for a week, I look up the etymology of the word 'shoot' and discover that its use as a curse word is only documented back to 1934, so the world is crumbling around me. Obviously I won't be changing it because it is adorable on Dean. But. It is especially distressing after I put in so much effort to avoid the word 'okay' which is more or less historically accurate but sounds too modern. Anyway.
“Gonna fuck you,” Cas mumbles, kissing Dean’s neck now like he was longing to be inside of it. “Gonna make it feel good. Gonna come inside you, come down your throat—or I could come on you. Come on your face and then draw you like that.” Dean groans. Cas leans back up and returns his thumb to Dean’s lower lip, pulling at his mouth. “Would you like that?”
It takes Dean a moment to pull himself together enough to say, “Well then, should ought to make sure you get your money’s worth.” He pulls on a robe from the trunk and puts on his own hat, dropping Cas’s on his head playfully. “You wait here a minute. I’ll clear it with the boss. And, Cas, darlin’,” he says, pausing in the doorway, “don’t you be getting too friendly with that picture while I’m gone.” Dean winks.
Jo launches into a diatribe about John, who had yelled at her earlier in the night. She talks about things he’d said about some old farmhand they’d hired off Bobby, about how John didn’t under
And wasn’t that the kicker, that even with the man scheduled to go in the ground, he still made Dean want to drink. John was still alive inside his bones, craving a little something, saying
There’s a pause as Cas steps to the side, out of view through the gap in the curtain. “That won’t be necessary.”
Cas wanted to get fucked. Cas wanted to get on his knees and get fucked silly by a big, strong, bearded man, and he thought Dean was that man. But Dean can’t do it; he’s already gonna be largely out of commission tomorrow, he needs to lie on his back if he wants to have any hope of keeping up with Cas and Jack for even part of the day. “Please, darlin’,” he begs. “Can fuck you proper tomorrow. Can keep the beard long as you like.”
“Howdy.” Dean smiles despite himself. The word might would sound half-natural, but Cas is still too stiff, still saying it like he’s trying to be Texan instead of practically being one for over a decade. It would never sound completely natural, Dean realizes, coming out of Cas’s mouth, and it didn’t have anything to do with being a Yankee. That was just Cas, how he talked.
Dean looks at Cas and lets a mischievous smile onto his face, like he’s been caught red-handed but ain’t sorry one bit. He bites his lip for added effect, and glances toward the ceiling.
He hits the mattress backwards, pulling Cas down on top of him, memory foam sinking beneath them. Cas is kissing into him slowly—
Cas takes it well, making a muffled moan of surprise before grabbing Dean’s hips and holding him closer, mouth opening obediently and eagerly. Dean fucking devours him; it’s been too fucking long since their lips touched. He moves his mouth like he wants Cas inside him, like he wants to be inside Cas, like the taste of him is getting him high. He loses his breath, but doesn’t care. He’s got one hand between them holding Cas’s shirt tight, the other on his bicep, feeling how strong it is, how it flexes as Cas holds him, looping his fingers through Dean’s belt loops and pulling him in. Dean has to grip Cas tightly as he goes on tiptoes, seeking a new angle on Cas’s mouth and nearly falling over, forcing Cas to hold him up with a large hand on his back. Cas pushes his tongue into Dean’s mouth, making him moan around it. Dean moves his hand to Cas’ neck in order to press in harder, slide his tongue against Cas’s, hold Cas there against the wall; he’s so fucking done with waiting—
“I’d rather not,” opines Cas mildly, and Dean finds himself agreeing. He likes this private thing between them. He didn’t want Cas drawing Benny, or any of the girls, or even him, if it meant other people would see it. “Do you like it?” Cas asks.
“—Imagination, mostly. I haven’t been in very many beds. I’m sure you could do better, but it’s your first day here.”
Hot clarity flows through him, makes him alert and relaxed all at once. Smoke and fire suffuse within him; there’s a loaded gun in his pocket. That had been the first sign, for those of them in the house— the sound of gunshots. But she hadn’t been shot. She hadn’t been anything at all, just ash and bones and a cracked pearl derringer where a mother used to be.
“Yeah. He was getting on, you know. Moved in with us near the end. Got to say goodbye to Charlie, and everyone.”
Dean serves up the hotcakes with a big pat of butter and some gooey jam that he adds hot water to to make a sort of syrup. “Egg?” he asks Cas, who nods, grabbing some cakes off the top, and Dean fries up a couple while Cas starts digging in.
“I’m one of Charlie’s biggest fans,” says Cas, with this shy little look. He looks just as innocent as the kid. Dean shifts on his stool.
Dean backs off of Cas and sits there awkwardly for a moment before deciding to make himself useful. He grabs a fresh towel, wets it, and, with a low “Here,” uses it to clean Cas up, stubbornly avoiding eye contact as he wipes angelic skin clean. Cas seems to have come down from his high pretty quick; he thanks Dean quietly, soberly. Dean would swear he can feel Cas’s eyes on him as he finishes up, but he refuses to look. “So, uh—“ Dean tries to break the awkward silence as he returns to the sink and washes his hands. “Why’d you say that thing? About killing us both?”
If I may be sincere for a moment, I know this chapter was a lot, so thank you for bearing with me. When I started writing this fic, it was just a thought experiment for myself and I didn’t have an AO3 account. I wrote these chapters for 15.09 fairly early on and considered them the ‘ending,’ because I felt they covered (my interpretation of) season 15 pretty well. I was happy to leave Dean and Cas’s future in this world unimagined, as I had already written one finale fix-it and had no desire to address the finale any further. I honestly still don’t.
On his way to the truck, Cas puts a hand in the pocket that contains the cassette. His cassette. He likes the song’s title, now that Dean’s explained it. It was apt, for so much of their lives. But Achilles Last Stand hadn’t been the song he’d really wanted to ask about. He’d chickened out at the last second, but the one he’d longed to ask about, been thinking about for months, was Rock and Roll. He wanted to ask about the lyrics, about whether Dean had thought of that song when he’d laid his hands on Cas’s chest and said those words—
It’s been years since Dean’s blown a guy in a dark alley. There’s a near-forgotten part of him that expects this to feel like that, that expects something quick and dirty and yes, ok,
“Told you so,” says Cas. He sucks on Dean’s neck. Dean looks at the barn door, at the blinding light outside. Anyone could just walk in.
“Don’t you start,” says Dean, bitterly, pulling away. “Don’t you start on that. It’s—it’s murder. Ain’t no two ways about it.”
Cas kisses him, and Dean kisses back, rubbing up against him despite the pain. Cas pulls him up, pushing the shirt from his shoulders. “You want my cock?”
“Shh, darlin’. Come here.” They kiss deeply, and Cas rubs at him slowly. “Just finger me a bit more. Calm yourself down.”
They had the morning together, and a day—one full, glorious day, and then yet another night. So little, and yet so much.
“You see, you stupid skank? You didn’t answer my question earlier. That was disobedient of you. If you disobey, you get nothing. If you obey, you’ll get what you want. When I say so. Do you understand?”
Cas brushes his hair gently and the memory of Cas’s firm grip there earlier causes leftover tingles to thrill down Dean’s spine. “Is that what you think?” Dean doesn’t bother answering. Stupid question. “When I met you, I hated myself. Not for what I was, but for daring to act on it. For disobeying and dishonoring my father. And then I met you. You’ve made a career out of those things. And you’re right to do so. That’s the— you’re right. You’re
“Tha—That was not the reaction I was expecting,” Dean said, still half-hunched over. “Cas, buddy, are you okay?” Dean winced at the buddy, knowing what he had confessed moments before.
The words are expected, the angry tone familiar, but Dean is a little less focused on what Cas is saying and more on desperately trying to forget what motels like these are used for.
Cas’ voice echoed in his head. He wanted to reach out and do something, anything, but instead he gestured towards the paper.
Dean pulled out a chair from the map table, sitting down to unlace his boots. He glanced up for a moment and internally sighed at the bloody footprints tracking him to his seat; those were going to be killer on his back to clean up.
Cas reaches out, stopping before he touches Dean, silently asking for permission. Dean nods carefully and offers his hands to Cas, tracking the movement as Cas cups his hands around Dean’s wrists, as gently as if he were cradling a baby bird. A quick glow, and Dean’s hands are healed and newly aching from the loss of contact.
“This is for Cas,” he reminds himself, before grimacing and bringing the crowbar down on Baby’s rear window, shattering it. It feels like he’s brought it down on his own hand, the bone scattered alongside the glass. In the panic of taking care of the strange man only now coming to consciousness, no one even turns their head towards the noise.
. That fucker was somewhere in Heaven and not in Dean’s passenger seat, where Dean could yell at him for just throwing everything on him and leaving like that, with no hope or promise of coming back. There had been no time to talk, no time to
For all that Dean has been unable to think about anything but Cas since the handprint left on his shoulder, none of that thinking has gone into the future. His plan so far is this: research, find something (a spell, a tablet, a god, a witch,
He was putting it nicely for Cas. After doing the deed, he climbed in Baby and looked down, and there Cas was all over him, a dark blot on his flannel. It had taken many deep breaths with his forehead pressed against the steering wheel to be able to hold in his lunch, to not collapse on the spot.
“I don’t want to answer this one,” Dean said. His clothes felt too tight, like he was choking again.
Distantly, Dean could hear Jack or Sam start to bump around, likely caught off guard by the sudden lack of light, but Dean didn’t have it within him to care about that. Cas’ face was inches from his, and his hands were reaching up slowly, tentatively. Dean saw them stop just before they touched his face, and realized that Cas was silently asking for permission. Dean nodded, and closed his eyes at the warmth on his cheek.
“All that shaking… that wasn’t a display of power. I was a little too eager to talk to ‘the Michael Sword’ and prove myself, and I messed up,” he admitted.
to Dean the way no one else has. He likes to watch trashy TV and he never fully understands Dean’s pop culture references and he’s always willing to indulge Dean and do movie night with him, even when Dean spends half the movie making sure Cas is paying attention to the right parts and Cas always already is.
Don’t— I don’t deserve that. I wan’t a father to you. Or if I was, It was the bad kind. The kind that puts too much on their kid. I treated you like dirt, Jack. And look at where it got us.
“D’you wanna come in?” Dean asks. He feels the need to ask instead of tell, to not assume anything at all.
“Yeah, I know it. Hell, spend half my time throwing men outta this place. I just feel that way sometimes. Sometimes, I even like feeling that way; big, strong cowpoke comes in and puts his hat on me.” Dean throws Cas a smile. “Other times, I want to be a big, strong cowpoke. Sometimes both at once. I dunno.”
“Yeah. Yeah, I—“ Dean shifts up to kneel in front of Cas; he puts a hand on Cas’s shoulder. “Can I touch them?”
“Hm?” Cas blinks. “Oh. Yes.” He gets back up and crosses to the dresser, grabs the drawing, and presents it to Dean. “There you are.”
“You understand the cattle. You always seem to be in the right place at the right time. You’re the perfect cowboy.”
“Fine,” says Cas, which isn’t as much enthusiasm as Dean would like, so he pulls out and gets more oil. Cas pants above him.
“Shoot. Don’t talk pretty like you. College boy here.” Dean sways as he walks, bumping Cas’s shoulder again.
I mean, I gotta hand it to you. You held out a long time. A loooong time. And yeah, he was technically dead already, but I’ll take it. If anything, this is better. I mean, you erased your brother from
It takes Dean a weirdly long time to answer. “Cas,” he starts, and Cas doesn’t want to admit to himself what it does to him, to be able to
“That’s because you’re stupid.” Dean’s panting with the force of the words. It’s hard to breathe. Cas gives him a new kind of look.
“No, no. You figured Jack out before we did. I meant, before you took it, we— you played me good.” It comes out accusatory, because it is. And here he is anyway, despite the hurt, wrapped in Cas’s arms. Completely hopeless.
“There are client spaces, and there are private spaces. The girls can’t have men walking through the whole house. And I don’t like the johns seeing where the girls bathe.”
I don’t know, but there must be something we can do. Come on, Dean. One last hail Mary. We’ll go down together. Fighting. What do you say?
“Dean.” Dean reaches a hand over the bar and they shake hands. Crowley’s eyes glitter hungrily. One and done; easy sale.
Dean turns to face him. “I know you do. Because you don’t understand. I fucked you up, Cas, with my bullshit. With the sex, and the lies. That wasn’t right. None of it was right.”
Everything feels unstoppable, inescapable, without boundary, as if it’s all happening at once. The lines are blurred; he struggles to find the differences, to separate himself from it all.
“Daytime, sleepyhead,” says Dean unapologetically, getting up and yawning loudly. Cas rolls over and buries his face in Dean’s pillow, a little ecstatic to be there, in the puddle of warmth left by Dean’s body. He peeks up a minute later and is rewarded with the sight of a still-sleepy Dean putting on his robe. Their eyes meet for a second, but Dean doesn’t say anything else; he just leaves the room, slippers slapping against his feet as he goes down the hall.
Lack of grammar aside, Dean gets the point and keeps himself still as Cas lifts up carefully and comes back down again. It’s so slow, Dean can’t stand it. He stands it anyway.
It was Dean on his knees in a crypt, covered in his own blood, choking out words that weren’t quite right.
For all his confidence that the potion would do what it needs to do, Dean can see that Jack looks scared. He, Sam, and Dean were all sitting around the table with their names scratched into it, and Jack’s fingers haven't stopped twitching and tapping on the surface since he sat down.
They had, until Cas had confessed that he’d been in love with Dean for the past 12 years while sacrificing his life for him, leaving Dean crying alone against a wall for hours. Cas had only just come back three days ago after Jack deposited him outside of the bunker, fresh out of the Empty and with his grace around his neck. Dean had been mid-research for a plan to pull Cas out, and with no grand moment of victory or swell of emotion—just Sam opening a door and a surprised shout—Dean didn’t know what to do, and so he did what he did best: he hid.
“Sorry,” Dean said, forcing his voice to be even. “I don’t know where that came from. I wish I could have been a brother to Sam, not a parent. I think I’d know him better.”
“Oh,” Cas said. His eyes went distant for a moment, and he traced one of the lines on Dean’s palm.  “Last person I cried in front of was you. By myself? Probably late last night or early this morning.”
“What are you—“ he whispers before a hand is shoved tightly over his mouth. He pushes at it but Cas’ grip is unrelenting.
Dean rolls his beer bottle in his hands, satisfied by the sound it makes scraping against the table.
Dean nodded at him, and silent communication passed between the two. They both knew where this was going.
“Dean,” he said, almost too low for him to hear. His voice was filled with warmth, and his eyes shone as bright as his grace,
Dean bites back a retort, wanting to say that interfering in his life is putting more than a bit of himself in his work. “I just need the last ingredient for a spell. That’s it.”
That’s Dean. He’s stuck here, stuck with no ability to move on and become someone else, rooted in a past he clings on to as the present. Repeating this over and over again, going through the motions until he goes to sleep and hopes that maybe this time, when he wakes up, Cas will be back. That’s how it happened once before, right? Coming back from the dead and Cas’ number on his phone and sheer relief striking through Dean hot and quick that he had managed to survive.
When he gets to the door, the number brings him to a stop. If memory serves correctly, this means that Sam is just next door, waiting to take on Lilith by himself. Dean almost wants to barge in, consequences be damned, and tell him not to do it, to tell him that Ruby isn’t to be trusted.
“Cas, buddy, you can’t just get out of a moving car like that,” Dean said, clapping a hand on Cas’ shoulder. An idea flickered within Cas, and he spun around and grabbed Dean by the collar, pulling him in for a kiss that was mostly an angry clash of lips.
The brook was a steady thrum, the noise settling over the meadow like a blanket. A wasp buzzed by his ear and he waved it away.
Slowly but surely the shock of it being an angel staring at him like that had faded away, replaced by the shock of
A snort ripped its way out of Cas, and Dean’s eyes widened in surprise; he’d never heard Cas laugh like that.
Dean wonders how many waitresses and restaurant-goers have been introduced to the supernatural because he and Sam had been unaware of their volume. Dean waves at a waitress looking at him and takes a seat in a booth at the back, tucked all the way in the corner. The waitress from earlier comes up to him, pen clicking, and Dean remembers the tofu burger he had originally ordered and how he longed for years after that one bite of bacon cheeseburger.
If Dean remembers correctly, he and Sam get a room and then fight about Lilith, his past self leaving to go park the Impala somewhere as a fuck you to Chuck. Plate cleared, he stands up and stretches his legs, smiling at the waitress in acknowledgment on his way out.
He took Cas’ hand by the palm and removed it from his face, leaning in to find the offending eyelash. Dean was barely breathing as he cleared the eyelash from where it had been balancing on Cas’ waterline.
There was silence, and then he looked up at Dean, a playful look on his face. “In the beginning, God cre—“
(Something about not wanting his brother to think he was a sap. Dean hadn’t argued his point well, but Cas enjoyed the way his blush spread across his face when he said it.)
“A beach day,” Dean blurted out, breaking the rhythm. “There’s no stress, no apocalypse, no case to worry about. Somewhere warm, like California or Florida. Just you, me, and the sand beneath our toes.”
But Dean’s knuckles on the steering wheel, white as a string of pearls, stayed in Cas’ mind. When Cas had rebuilt Dean it had given him access to his memories, and he could feel the shame that Dean had been taught to carry. How he had been forced to hide a part of himself, and the oppressive silence that came with it. People like these protesters were one of the reasons why Dean and Cas had to wait twelve years, why Claire was nervous to hold Kaia’s hand when she went out.
The swirling golden liquid seems to stare at Dean, its shimmer holding weight. On principle, Dean tries not to put things in his body that emit light, a childhood’s worth of movies telling him that never ends well. He swallows and tears his gaze from the glass.
“Sure. I’ll go first.” He thought for a moment. Know a guy for twelve years, but the second you’re asked to make a comparison, all thought leaves your head. “We are both in this room feeling… feeling… nervous. Feeling nervous.”
If Dean plays his cards right, he can save Cas and himself from suffering under Chuck’s ending for them, alone and wanting. He’ll take
Pacing back over to the couch, Chuck collapses on it and pulls his laptop onto him. Dean suppresses a wince at the clumsiness of it, grateful for modern technology. When he opens it, the screen displays a writing document in progress, the words “The Monster at the End of This Book” in big letters at the top.
He crosses towards the nearest post and scans the fliers, hoping for some indication of his spot in space and time. A concert poster for some band he’s never heard of (and what kind of name is The Cab anyways?) says that they’re playing tonight at 9pm, April 2, 2009.
They stared at each other. And stared. And stared. The moment felt a mile-wide, like it could span on for forever. At least until the timer on Cas’ phone rang, and they were both startled back into themselves. Cas released Dean’s wrist and Dean’s rubbed at it, longing for a ghost of Cas’ touch.
The song—something by Kansas—had ended, and thank God (Jack?) for that cause he always loved it in the beginning before remembering how long it dragged on. Something significantly more modern played next, Taylor Swift maybe. Dean turned the volume all the way up to distract from the way the trees lining the road all looked the same.
Pressure on his ankle distracts Dean and he glances down, almost tripping over his own feet at what’s wrapped around his leg. It’s a tentacle—
His right hand reaches out like he’s about to tap Dean on the forehead before Cas hesitates, eyebrows furrowed, and he leans down to rest his hand on Dean’s shoulder instead.
he warns himself—but the material looks hard like marble despite the way it’s curled fluidly around him.
“Rowena is just as annoyed with your lack of communication as we are, and she’s in Hell, Dean. I thought you two had fixed this problem.”
He joins Chuck on the couch, trying to sit as far as possible from the man before realizing that the edge of the couch acts like quicksand. Settling at a respectable distance, he turns towards Chuck and begins to speak.
Dean was in love with him. He knew that. He doesn’t know when it happened, but he knew the exact moment he realized. At night, outside of a cabin, watching a knife protrude from Cas’ chest and the blinding glow of grace, followed by nothing at all. Dean had been in love with him, and then it was too late because he had to burn him.
When he comes to, Dean is leaning against the motel wall, lightly shaking. Judging by the light outside barely any time has passed, but the faint fluttering in his veins is proof of his success.
Long-ingrained survival instinct told him to shake it off and pretend as nothing had happened, it was just him getting lost in the moment—but no, that wasn’t it. That kiss was every held-back touch, every too-long stare, every distinction between what everyone else had and what they had.
The feeling comes up over him, flood waters rushing to consume a house. Dean squeezes his eyes tight and he’s trapped in the motions of falling, his stomach screaming at him and his brain unhelpfully reminding him that this is why he doesn’t like planes.
He waves his hand dismissively, lifting the glass to his nose and sniffing. It doesn’t smell like anything, and he sets it back on the table with a
there are eyes—endless eyes—but nothing so organic as a pupil and iris and all of that. It’s eyes in the way that houses have eyes, that the knots in trees have eyes, everything positioned just right so that the whole world is watching you. Pattern upon pattern he recognizes and it’s all paying attention to Dean.
“The angel Castiel.” Chuck’s voice is steel. “Your little helper who is getting just a tad too close to his charge.”
He doesn’t know when it happened, but every move he makes turns to Cas, some habit that had snuck up on him. In the dead of night, he’d wake up, arm numb, and discover that he’d been laying on it in his sleep, right hand clutching the scar.
Dean bristles: it feels like Cas is in Bobby’s kitchen threatening to send him back to hell if he doesn’t behave all over again. “I don’t need all of it, Cas, I’m not trying to make you human I’m trying to save a friend.”
“Ow,” Cas said, flinching and bringing his hand up to his eye. The chair clanged on the ground, and Dean was at Cas’ side immediately, heart pounding in his throat. Rowena was the queen of Hell, after all, and she had no reason to like them. Maybe there was a time-limit and they were taking too long and they were never going to leave this room.
The meeting with Chuck left Dean jittery, like he said too much and got barely anything in return. Determined to bring himself back down to Earth, Dean heads straight towards the motel room’s bathroom, splashing cool water from the sink on his face. He shuts the water off and nearly jumps out of his skin when he turns around to see Cas behind him.
But he thinks, in the quiet ways, in moments of sharing movies and music and a son and a life, it all proves that what comes next can’t be totally hopeless, that Cas couldn't have been totally hopeless. For twelve long years, Cas knew Dean before Dean knew himself, so why is this different?
He felt a hand run through his hair, tightening at nape of his neck and holding his head firmly in place. A shiver went through Dean, and he groaned against Cas’ mouth.
“I’ll tell you in a second.” She sits on the bed beside him. “First, I want to tell you that Bobby had a talk with me yesterday, and do you know what he told me?”
“You can borrow some of my clothes tomorrow if you want,” Dean tells him, impossibly calm. How could Dean be so calm? “We can head over to Walmart, get you something for yourself.”
“No, I’ll go. I’ll go, darlin’. Just.” Dean takes Cas’s hand. “Don’t go getting your hopes up, hear?”
Dean rests his cheek against the back of Cas’s shoulder while Cas curls over to let him look. He can’t stop staring at the red mark beneath Cas’s skin. “I am. This is what bad men do, Cas. They hurt you and then they stay anyway, ‘cause they need you. Need you more than you need them. They hold you close and hurt you again. Get angry if you don’t do what they say.”
Cas holds him there for a long time, just using lips and tongue, nothing else, nothing more, kissing each other like words, like a whole conversation. They press their faces closer and closer, noses into cheeks and finally forehead against forehead. They hold each other like that, no longer kissing, just breathing into each other with their foreheads touching, each with a hand around the back of the other's neck to keep him from escaping.
He gets to the Singer property and announces himself loud as he can, hollering up a storm so nobody shoots him. It’s Rufus who comes outside first, though, and Dean reckons maybe he should’ve snuck in, after all.
Cas stands, so Dean does, too, but Cas doesn’t go to the window, or the pile of clothes, but to Dean, and he pulls him by the waist into a kiss. Cas’s hands are steady and warm on his hips, and Dean leans into him, despite the strange visit, despite his embarrassing display and resulting fuckup last night. It would be harder not to kiss Cas at this point. He loops his arms around Cas’s neck and opens to him. He wishes he didn’t have to go.
It takes a while just to get all the grit down the pipe; Dean hopes it won’t clog. That was all he needed; Sister Jo would probably make him pay for the repairs himself. He pumps more well water and tosses it down with the dirt, and Cas stands to avoid the cold rush. Then they stopper the tub back up and Dean quickly pours a bucket of cold and the full kettle’s worth of hot, one after the other so he doesn’t burn Cas. They boil two more kettles’ worth, add some well water, and by the time Dean gets in, it’s perfect. He hums as he lowers into the tub.
Dean was spiraling. Cas wouldn’t make those things up. And much as his brain tries, for the millionth time, to tell him that Cas’s ‘I love you’ was a sort of platonic, transcendental, angelic love, he can’t deny that Cas had used the word
Dean almost laughs at him, at the stupid expression on his face, but just a small breath escapes his lips. A little smile touches Cas’s eyes as well. Dean squeezes his hand. “You gotta trust me, too, though, darlin’.”
“You know, Cas, you are— I think you might be just about the only thing I ever wanted, you know? That I didn’t already have. Other’n Baby, anyhow.” His fat mouth. Cas’s eyebrows raise up.
But holy shit. It’s amazing how he can just watch as his words hit Cas, as Cas’s eyes widen in surprise before relaxing into a smile, as Cas keeps eye contact, not a bit embarrassed, just happy, just smiling back at Dean as if he’s the whole fucking world.
Silence. Chuck stares at him. He’s ruining the fun. Sam lets go of Dean, because Dean isn’t struggling anymore. He’s standing rigid, glaring straight into the eyes of God.
Dean shuts up, and makes himself sit still, and tries not to shake out of existence, until Cas speaks.
“—Dean. I’ll listen better. And I forgave you. And now you’ve promised not to hurt me again, so let’s move on, alright? I don’t want you feeling guilty for four weeks. I’m not mad.”
They kiss, wet and sloppy, all tongue and spit and hands pulling at each other. Cas pulls him right off the chair and without meaning to be Dean is on top of him and they’re half-down on the floor, Dean’s hat lost somewhere, Cas’s back against the side of the bed, Dean braced against it with one arm, just a fumbling, accidental thing, more concern given to sucking and pulling than gravity or direction. Dean nips at Cas’s lips and Cas responds by opening wider, rubbing their tongues together and moaning. They slide all the way to the floor and it’s only by nearly knocking the chair over that Dean is brought back to reality. He separates from Cas’s mouth and Cas goes for his neck instead, his hands holding Dean’s back tightly.
“No.” He scrounges around some more and finds Dean’s first prize Dallas regional belt buckle. “This is for winning?” he asks.
Dean explains the process of cleaning the bar while wiping down Cas’s chest. They get dressed, then Cas takes up a rag and starts cleaning. Dean takes a quick trip to the outhouse, then he gets to mopping and mulls his thoughts around, already decided but still rifling through the words in his brain. Finally, when they’re done, Dean holds out the bucket for Cas to throw his rag into, drops it on the ground, and then embraces him, one hand on Cas’s lower back and the other on his neck, thumbing at the soft skin by his ear and kissing him sweet as he can before pulling back slow.
Dean waves in acknowledgement as she leaves, then reaches into Meg’s stash and rolls himself another, then doesn't bother to light it. He leans back and closes his eyes. He chews the paper of the cigarette and tries not to think about little Jo, in that dark house, all alone.
“Nothing to be ashamed of, Cassie. Look. I’m calling it ‘Doctor Crowley’s Virility Elixir.’ It’s done well so far; I’m practically sold out of the stock I made. Can’t bottle it fast enough.”
Dude, you can read my mind. You made me, and I— I like who I am. And Dean, and Cas, and Jack. Eileen.
“Play on the floor!” declares Jack, straightening his body so that he slides off the mattress and onto the rug. “Toys, please,” he asks Dean from there.
Cas sighs and puts up with it, an angry sort of pout on his face that quickly fades away as Dean scrubs at it, then his neck, behind his ears, his shoulders, armpits, arms, hands. Dean even scrubs Cas’s fingernails with the little brush they have, but quickly gives up on excavating those completely. He gets the clippers from the vanity and just goes ahead and trims them down. Didn’t want them there anyway. He then lingers a bit on Cas’s hands, feeling the calluses on them. He rubs them gently, working soap and water into them until they become soft.
“Bull,” says Dean, watching Cas unbutton his shirt. Cas’s fingers move steadily and deftly down his own chest, handling buttons much too small for his large fingers with ease. “I played that hand for you, didn’t I?”
“Mm.” Cas just keeps finger fucking him, moving in and out, side to side, around in circles. A pressure begins to build in Dean, the furious need returning again.
Dean shifts his weight, takes a step closer. “Achilles Last Stand.” A strange title. There was no reference to Achilles in the song. “Robert Plant had a broken ankle when he wrote it,” Dean explains. “Had to cancel their tour, was afraid he wouldn’t be able to travel any more.”
The sheriff tips his hat back and meets Dean’s eye. “Was hoping you could tell me. Word on the street is you skipped town about a month ago with a gentleman friend, is that right?”
Dean’s face glows redder and redder, Sherwin’s words burning in his mind. They burn and burn, burrowing into the skin of his face—
“I don’t mean, I don’t mean sex. I mean, most friends don’t do that, but some people do, I mean, I don’t judge, you know. What I mean is. The kissing. And the pet names. And the hand holding. The sleeping together. Hell, you don’t even sleep. Do you have any idea how fucking weird that is? Sleeping next to an awake guy for five hours? It ain’t exactly a friend-zone sort of activity.”
Dean’s focusing on breathing. He’s used to a bed, but this. This ain’t bad. The table is waxy and smooth, no chance of a splinter.
“Yes, but that’s not what I mean. Miguel and Tagg like you better than me already. You can rope just as well as they can.”
Cas takes a deep breath. It all seems so obvious now. How stupid he was. How the one thing keeping him miserable was him keeping his mouth shut, how going along with all of Dean’s rules was eating away at him from the inside.
Dean makes himself take a deep breath and then leans back, looking up at the stars. He stretches his jaw, moving it from side to side. It’d been maybe the easiest time he’s ever had a man fuck his mouth before. Weird how things with Cas were always so much easier or so much harder than with anyone else. Dean glances down at Cas, who’s working his tip with his mouth and his shaft with his hand, studiously attentive but difficult to watch from this angle, even more so without leaning up and using his sore muscles. “Come h—come here, darlin’.”
“Huh.” Cas doesn’t seem interested in elaborating. Rufus had given Dean plenty of shit over his ignorance, but not for the same transgressions that Cas is focusing on. “Anyway, he’s the one done told me about Passover and all that. You don’t gotta be jealous of him.”
“And you’re always swallowing it. How come it’s more disgusting if it’s in your shithole? That’s where the—“
Shit. Shit. He always talked so pretty. Then it came Dean’s turn to talk and he was so far gone he didn’t know what to say.
“You could be getting paid for this, but you’re the one paying instead. You’re doing someone’s chores for a month, just to get fucked for one night.”
Sam is in the habit of getting up before sunrise, and Cas is eager to meet Jack, so Dean has to start the obscenely boring drive from Amarillo to Lebanon at an equally obscene and boring hour of the day. It’s worth it in the end, once they get to the bunker and watch Cas and Jack hug each other for the first time. Dean can’t help but notice the wonder in Cas’s eyes as he perceives— well, whatever Jack is. Whatever the hell Cas perceives. There’s a lot of talk, but all Dean hears is that Jack is the one who brought Cas back, and without even trying. They got a win, and for once it was easy. It was free. He’s almost giddy as he packs his bags for Dodge City.
Dean nods in return. He settles back on the seat and works on Cas’s tie, pulling it through its collar easily, then he starts on the shirt buttons. Cas’s neck is so beautiful.
Cas is quiet. His arms encircle Dean slowly, warm hands pressing against his back, holding him close. “Dean,” he murmurs into Dean’s neck, tickling him with stubble and breath. “You know I’m always here for you. If this is what you want right now, then I’ll do it.”
“No. Come back here.” Cas takes a step closer, not quite touching Dean this time. Dean eyes his crotch. “Got a lot going on, huh?”
Cas stares at him, eyes cool and dark in the barn. “You just said yourself living in Abilene wouldn’t solve all your problems.”
Alrighty then. Dean gets up and wiggles his pants down until they fall to the ground. He gets a little self-conscious, standing there stark naked in front of Cas, who stands up next to him and kisses him, so gentle and deep that something inside of Dean moans too soon, an embarrassingly high-pitched, desperate thing. “Cas, ain’t got time for—“
Between the three of them it’s a quick and easy hunt. They finish off the vamps that night and check into a motel. Dean has his very own motel room and it feels horrible. He’s hated motels ever since they moved into the Bunker. Now, it seems he hates them more still.
Cas goes and falls asleep right there in the tub, head hanging off the edge, leaving Dean unsure as to what to do with himself. In the end Dean washes up quickly— no need for another disaster like the last time Cas bathed him— gets up, and dries off. He puts his hat back on and pulls the stool over behind Cas. He sits there and cradles Cas’s head in his hands, supporting it so he doesn’t crick his neck any worse. Dean lifts it up gently and rubs it, massaging it again like he’d done when he washed it, until Cas makes another low sound to indicate he’s awake.
That isn’t to say he dislikes being a human. He knew that Dean removing his grace was the only way the Empty would have let them escape. Besides, he had nothing waiting for him in Heaven, the place that had only ever turned him into something he was not. Sometimes where you were from needs to remain where you were from, nothing more.
“Who made these questions?” Dean exclaimed, still holding back his delight. “I already played that game. I’m glad I didn’t change anything.”
“Why are you here Dean? I read Chuck’s manuscript for today, and nowhere was time travel from 10 years in the future mentioned.”
Dean shakes his head and takes his time finishing his burger, knowing they’re heading towards the Toreador Motel.
“At any moment Sam could walk out of that motel room,” Cas growls. “Right now, you’re on your way to go try to stop him from fighting Lilith tonight. And yet you stand here to ruin divine will for what? A friend?”
Cas looked at him expectantly, but Dean couldn’t say it just yet, not when there were still questions left. He needed to speak his truth with nothing pushing down on him, nothing waiting in the future.
Outside, a car honks, and there's the sounds of a family unloading for the night. The noises don’t quite reach into the room, like Dean is cocooned in here with Cas. There’s something wet on his neck and Dean touches it, curious, and it comes away bloody; rubbing his neck had reopened the wounds on his hand from dodging the car.
“Yeah, it’s just a habit I formed when I’d use to have to call my dad from payphones and stuff. Could never let go of it,” Dean admitted.
