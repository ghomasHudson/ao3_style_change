As soon as they arrived, they saw that John’s family were crowded against the police tape, as close as they could get. The bride was sobbing, and Ember’s mother looked pale, pinched and shellshocked. Many of those less familiar with Ember herself - his father included - watched suspiciously as Sherlock adjusted his position and bent down next to Ember.
Sherlock manhandled John to the couch, put a freaking blanket over his shoulders and made him tea.
Slightly blushing John laughed a bit.
Sherlock avoided looking down and tried painfully to think of something disgusting like Mycroft naked but then John touched his legs to get them out of the trousers and so his mind filled with John.
“Nothing! She just passed out here, I swear! And then I called you!”
“So… what did you bring me?”
The days went by and so the weather slowly began to change.
“What were you trying to do?”
“Oh. That’s what I call bad timing.”
“How do I know that you’re indeed a ghost and not just a projection?”
John raised his eyebrows and looked again at Sherlock, who looked amused.
Sherlock smirked and put three slips of paper on the counter. “I got three telephone numbers.”
John went away only to return a few minutes later.
“And…you had a psychosomatic limping that’s why you have a cane and a psychologist named Francesca who wants you to move into a mental clinic.”
John couldn’t believe what a big idiot he was.
“While she was at the bathroom the building started burning and her door stuck and no one was looking for her and so she… charred.”
John’s eyes widened as he looked at the numbers. “You got...telephone numbers…you got…from whom?”
“Alright then come one I have at least three cases for you that are at least a six.”
That he felt dizziness didn’t make it any better.
They both winced as Sherlock’s voice broke the silence. John turned around to see him picking his way towards them between tables. As their eyes met, Sherlock grinned. “But I get that you wanted to make a point.”
“Well…all right. I was seventeen…. It was with my girlfriend Alison at the time. She was sixteen and we were together for… five months I think. She was really nice.”
He put his arms under his armpits and pulled him out of his coffin and grave while walking backwards.
John looked sad and really guilty which confused Sherlock.
This seemed to make the Alpha even angrier which caused him to begin to push Sherlock’s trousers and pants down and growl once more.
His smile grew even wider, pulling his cheeks painfully, and he hugged Harry tightly.
Everyone except John ignored her until she came home with boyfriends, which made her so unhappy that she started to drink.
I just want to mention that the second half of this chapter is written by the best co-author in the world :)
It had been a huge event as the law was published which allowed Omegas to attend colleges and have jobs.
Without further words, he turned around and began to pace back and forth while pulling at his hair.
Mrs Hudson frowned and took a sip of her tea.
There he turned every information he had forth and back but he couldn’t find an acceptable solution.
As soon as Sherlock entered the flat John had to stifle a growl because of the scents which were drifting in his nose.
When John told Sherlock all of that he just groaned again and then sulked a few hours, refusing to talk.
“So…it would be okay for you to pretend that we are just flatmates?”
John tensed.
In the corner of his eye, Liam saw the ear of his teddy-bear sneak out of the bag zip.
Three hours later, Sherlock arrived home from Bart’s and found John, sitting in his usual chair, looking like a stone statue.
“No, you didn’t. I was just surprised, that’s all. I didn’t expect you to say it so soon but nothing more.”
Then he gestured Sherlock that it was his turn but said man just shook his head good-humoured.
He needed him.
“You’re here.”
“You’ll someday be the death of me you know that right?”
“I can’t say the same.”
“Look. In our files is no entry about a Liam Bellamy and it’s a really serious accusation to say that he’s a serial killer. I have no proof and you have no proof of that. If you’re willing to let your charges against Mr Bellamy drop, I would say that you can go.”
Sherlock was suddenly like under a spell and his laughter died. While John was doing his handstand, his jumper and undershirt were sliding so there was just John’s bare belly. Sherlock was grateful that John had pinched his eyes together in utter concentration so he couldn’t see him staring at him. It was muscular but not too much. There was no six-pack or something like that but it was obvious that John was fit. Sherlock had to swallow hard and tear his gaze away until John was back at his chair.
John smacked Sherlock’s head.
A few minutes later Lestrade arrived again with a file in his hand.
John couldn’t help but laugh.
Mycroft sniffed and raised his eyebrows looking at John which made Sherlock narrowing his eyes.
John had expected the man to protest but he did no such thing. He nodded and even smiled slightly.
“I didn’t! Please let me explain everything!”
“John? Would you bond with me?”
With that, he opened the drawer of the bedside table and grabbed something which he then put in John’s hand.
John nodded.
He sniffed once, turning completely toward Grace Wilkinson.
John’s next try asking him if he had a boyfriend.
He climbed wordlessly into the bed and soon the only sound to be heard was the even breathing of him.
He blushed.
Suddenly everything rushed through his mind.
They had been repelled by such acts. They had always lectured their two sons about respecting Omegas and that they had to leave the younger Omegas alone because they could be overwhelmed by the smell and attitude of a futile Alpha.
Sherlock smiled back.
“I met someone. Her name is Lisa.”
Sherlock had never reacted like this to anything. John didn’t know what to think.
Again all heads turned in their directions but because of a totally different reason than last time.
“What is it? Why are you looking like a kicked puppy?”
“Then it’s settled.”
“Of course I know that.”
John looked anxiously at him and the ghost had the nerve to give him a knowing look.
“Oh yes, that’s what they did. They could look at you and know everything about you because of the states of your clothes or the twitching of your hand. They were brilliant. The younger one always said he wanted to be a detective after rehab. He helped me with some issues with my husband.”
“You need to take your t-shirt off. Do you feel any better or do you need my help?”
Sherlock tensed and John’s curiosity grew because he also wondered that.
“No. I’m the doctor of us.”
He took a shaky breath and tried to squelch the feeling that seemed to overwhelm him.
John returned it and grabbed Sherlock’s hands that were on his chest. He felt Sherlock’s breathing on his hair and he loved it- he loved being able to feel him and every proof of his aliveness.
And he telling him that he considered himself bonded to his work and that he didn’t believe in love.
“Oh don’t worry dear, we only want to give you two a few moments to talk and get to know each other a bit better.”
Mrs Hudson smiled. “Oh, no Sir, you’re at the right door. I’m his landlady, Mrs Hudson. Are you a client?”
Here is the mentioning of rape so...be beware if that's a trigger for you
When John stood up the next morning-not to mention that he didn’t sleep at all again- he took his cane which was now always leaning on his bedside table and hopped the stairs down to make breakfast.
“No one? Really? Okay, I will tell you this very slowly so that every single one of you will understand. The barkeeper, her ex-boyfriend, mixed panda hair into her drinks. The allergens killed her.”
Now Sherlock was smiling so widely it was almost breaking his face and John smiled back.
John nodded.
She was frowning now but looked concentrated again.
He tried to put all of his feelings, all of that unbelievable love for this madman in that kiss and it seemed to work because after a few seconds Sherlock was practically clinging at him with no intention to ever end the kiss.
This made his mother even angrier and she gave him a poisonous smile.
John blushed and tried to hide it behind his cup of tea which he hastily drank.
“So you’re manipulating me into forgiving you duringsex? I’m not that easy, Sherlock.”
“Aren’t you two a bit too old to have a roommate?”
“I’m Mrs Hudson. Now tell me on which day would you be free for a visit to the house?”
He heard his own pounding heartbeat while the Alpha slowly let his finger wander between slit.
With that Sherlock smiled and snuggled himself contently against his partner until John’s stomach rumbled pretty loudly.
“Oh I see, you have some attachment to him. You’ll get over it, I’m sure of that. You can always just delete him from your mind palace.”
He couldn’t resist the urge to reach out and touch his face gently, drawing his finger down from his temple and over his cheek.
“If that’s what you want then yes. I don’t want to rush you.”
This is the spell in english:
Sherlock hummed approvingly, and so they stayed like that until Lestrade intervened. He cleared his throat demonstratively until they took a step back and faced him. He grinned.
He was touching him in the progress.
He ripped his eyes open and stared in equally wide eyes.
Sherlock looked like he was sulking. That sight made John only laugh harder.
Suddenly Sherlock pulled him down for a messy, uncoordinated kiss which was absolutely perfect for both of them.
Mrs Hudson frowned, putting two and two together. “Oh, are you John’s father? The boys told me a bit about what happened. I was so worried - John looked as though he had seen a ghost.”
“Yes, I’ll be here. I can’t go anywhere.”
Lestrade looked astonished and stared again at John.
He just couldn’t bear this anymore.
- followed his example.
At this, his schoolmates had laughed loudly and even his teacher had begun to stifle a laugh.
Lestrade’s eyes widened. A few moments later he narrowed his eyes again.
Sherlock tried to look remorseful, but failed. Instead, he grinned.
John grinned.
“Um…it’s B negative. Why?”
At once, John was caught, as the two graphite-like eyes locked with his own.
They leaned their foreheads together panting.
Nothing happened. He let his shoulders drop.
“Um… well, however her father blamed the two teachers and six supervisors and so he killed them.”
It was also a sign that things weren’t well that he wasn’t wearing his coat.
“I think it was amazing, but I don’t have any data for comparison. So what do you think?”
A few moments neither of them said something. Both of them deep in thought. Finally, Sherlock broke the silence.
John nodded.
The trousers.
John looked through the file.
“Oh, really? Could you please come with me? I would rather have this talk inside an interrogation room.”
There was no reaction which made him a bit angry.
With that, he let John the decision.
A warm, fond feeling spread itself in John’s chest.
“You’re injured. I think you need stitches.”
“I barely ate. You know that. Just transport.”
Now John was beaming at him and gave him a fond smile which Sherlock hesitantly returned. He knew that if he was a human he would be blushing, so he was thankful that he wasn’t able to do that. Not yet-at least.
He let his gaze wander over John like analysing him.
His skin was pale as if he was a creature from a fairy tale.
He always fell asleep with his head on John’s shoulder and he never slept more than since he had bonded.
“I’m sorry.”
John sighed. “I know.”
Sherlock looked a bit ashamed.
The ceremony went smoothly, in a rush of brief greetings and hurried introductions, and quiet observation - as expected; it was the wedding party afterwards which was the worrying part. There would be alcohol and a lot of John’s family members,  a lot of other people. They followed the crowdto the door of the room, itching to reach for one another’s hands, and took a moment to just breathe, separate from the festivities within.  Then they looked into each other’s eyes for a long moment, building up their characters,before they stepped into their roles and entered the room.
Every head snapped towards him and his eyes that had begun to prickle while he spoke began to drain themselves which frustrated him more than anything.
He had accepted his destiny.
John scratched his neck and blushed a bit.
Sherlock still had a blank look on his face and so John groaned.
“I’m not angry with you…I’m… never mind. What do you want to tell me?”
“You know that I’m not like other people. I don’t have emotions or act because out of sentiment.”
But with Sherlock, he had absolutely no clue what he should think.
“Yes – actually, I work here. I…“
“Yes, I’m a doctor. It takes one to two years. He only died ten months ago so we should be good.”
“Lestrade! Lestrade! You can’t be serious with that? How incompetent is actually your team?! They missed nearly everything!”
With wide eyes, Sherlock nodded and smiled incredibly wide.
It was Lestrade who said that he had news and that he would come over to tell them.
John let his eyes travel over the guests, finally resting on his father. He felt a pinch of pain in his chest when he thought about what Sherlock had told him, but now was not the time. Besides, his breath hitched and some of the pity he felt drained away when he saw how his father’s gaze lingered on Sherlock with so much hatred - as if Sherlock was the personification of evil. He was so caught up in the expression that he didn’t immediately notice that Sherlock had stood up, and was now standing in front of him with his hands folded under his chin.
“You go in your uniform.”
,” said John, raising his hands in an attempt at a calming gesture. “They just brought him in to take a look at him, in case he bit or scratched the person who killed your mother.”
“What?” the man behind the door asked, rudely.
“If we could figure out what book is being referred to, we can find out what this bastard’s been trying to tell us.”
He got up from his armchair, removed the envelope from his jacket pocket, and handed it to Sherlock before settling on the sofa next to him. Sherlock read the invitation quickly and glanced at the reply slip before putting both back into the envelope.
“But what did you mean, ‘That one?’ Did he recognise your name from somewhere?”
The address at which Sherlock exited the taxi was only a short distance from where Mallory had lived. He took John’s notepad out of his pocket and flipped through the pages. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed someone in the ground-floor flat looking out at him through the curtains. He tried to ignore them as he continued to scan John’s notes. It looked like Mallory’s parents were the ones who lived in the ground-floor flat. He could still feel the person’s eyes on him through the curtains. He pocketed John’s notepad and approached the front door. The door opened into a well-lit corridor with white walls and thick maroon carpet on the floor. Sherlock stopped at the first door on the left and knocked. Several long moments passed before he heard movement on the other side. The door opened a few inches.
? Sherlock thought to himself.
“Mhm,” Sherlock replied, before closing the distance between their mouths. He slid a hand down John’s torso.
“I hope so,” he replied. “Sherlock Holmes. And you are?”
“What’s going on, John?” Lestrade asked.
you,” John replied, resting his forehead against Sherlock’s chest.
“What are you doing here?” Lestrade asked.
Sherlock shook his head and pressed the phone back to his ear.
“No no, he’s
“I don’t know. I went round her place earlier to pick up a book I had asked to borrow, and walked in to find her dead,” Krista replied, in little more than a whisper.
“Sure thing,” said Zoё, pulling a spiral-bound hardback notebook from a drawer. She handed it across the desk to Sherlock and he began flipping through the pages. The top of each page was labelled neatly with the date and divided up into several columns; ‘delivery service,’ ‘delivered by,’ ‘time,’ ‘addressee,’ and ‘parcel signed for by.’ Sherlock continued to look through the notebook until he reached the date three days prior to the murder. He sighed as he realised that it was only partially filled out.
As John waited for his laptop to boot back up, he also read through Molly’s report. He didn’t fancy writing another long blog post when he had barely finished the previous one. He fished his notepad out of his trouser pocket and flipped through it until he found the past page he’d written on.
“Anywhere in the vicinity of Scotland Yard?”
John frowned.
“You’re impossible,” he said, pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek.
“Jacket pocket?” John asked. He’d all but forgotten about the invitation. “Oh.”
Exactly two months after their first kiss and Sherlock’s apology, John awoke to the sound of a crash coming from the kitchen. He hurriedly slipped  t-shirt over his head and went out into the living room. He saw Sherlock crouched on the kitchen floor, sweeping the shattered remains of a beaker into the dustpan. John hoped the beaker had been empty when it had hit the floor.
At what seemed like long last, the taxi pulled up outside of Irene Adler’s old address. Sherlock paid the driver and stepped out of the car. An odd feeling materialised in the pit of his stomach and he stared up at the pristine white stone of the building.
“You? Never. I did butter the toast, however,” Sherlock replied, fighting an urge to smile. John smiled, however, and walked over to the kitchen.
The stack of folders John received when he arrived at the clinic was larger than the one he’d been given last time. He sighed and asked Marjorie to give him a few minutes to get situated before sending in the first patient. He had a feeling it was going to be a long day, and he wasn’t very eager to get started. A pang of guilt shot through him as the thought occurred to him. He didn’t actually dislike his work. He was helping people, which was the reason he’d wanted to become a doctor in the first place.
“Hi, I’d like to see Krista Bates, please” John said to the nurse behind the front desk at St. Bart’s. She gave him an appraising look.
As Sherlock stared at the bookshelves, John finished his blog entry and placed the folder on the stack across the table from him. Sherlock looked over at him, then at the stack of folders, then back to him.
“Of course. I want to help find the person who killed my mother as much as I can.”
, he thought.
Sherlock gave him a look.
“Lou.”
“Why was he here?” Sherlock murmured.
“My name is Sherlock Holmes, and I was-- Yes, that one. And yes, everyone else seems to, as well. --I was wondering whether you had a few minutes to spare. I need to speak with you,” Sherlock said. “That will be fine. Now, where are you located? Okay. Thanks so much. My companion and I will be along shortly.”
_____________________
Sherlock shook his head, as if to jar the thoughts from his mind. He knew he didn’t have time to focus on ‘Why?’ He needed to figure out where Moriarty had taken John. He considered phoning Lestrade, but quickly decided against it. It would take too long to explain everything, especially since he needed Lestrade to actually believe him. No, this was something he needed to figure out on his own.
“Who’s the victim?” John asked, pulling on the pair of rubber gloves Lestrade had passed him.
“And your name?” he asked Mallory’s father.
“But Sherlock, what about the--”
John sighed.
Sherlock turned his attention back to the mirror. There was no obvious indication of where Moriarty had taken John. At first glance, it seemed like the message on the glass had been written in blood. Upon closer inspection, however, it seemed to be written with some kind of blood-red crayon-like substance. Carefully, Sherlock placed a fingertip against the edge of one of the letters, and brought his fingers up close to his nose.
“The daughter didn’t know anything useful,” John began, leaning over to peck Sherlock on the cheek.
“I… was grasping at straws when it first came to mind. It wasn’t supposed to lead anywhere,” Sherlock said, as though he were trying to convince himself.
“Don't be silly,” Moriarty had said. “Someone else is holding the rifle. I don't like getting my hands dirty.”
“Yes, I suppose we have to.”
“I’m so sorry to bother you,” he began, “I was wondering if you could let me into Agatha Bates’ flat for a moment.” The landlord eyed him suspiciously. “I’m Jack, Krista’s husband,” Sherlock continued, offering the man his hand. “There was a book of photos Krista wanted to use for… for the funeral. I know she’d really appreciate it if you could help us out.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Stomach was empty…” Sherlock muttered to himself.
She nodded, then excused herself and returned to her own flat.
“That’s very unusual. Almost all of our deliveries on that day of the week come from a particular courier service, and they keep meticulous records,” she said.
Sherlock made a noise in the affirmative. John strode into the kitchen.

“San Quentin, according to Megan. What was he incarcerated for?” Sherlock asked, jotting down the gist of what Gladys had just told him.
“Are you Mallory Jacobson’s father?”
Instead of the pieces of the puzzle coming together and forming any semblance of an image, they were multiplying exponentially. The information Sherlock had received from Zoё had already taken up residence in its proper location in his mind palace, but that didn’t prevent it from creeping up into the forefront of his brain. It persisted in doing so for the entirety of his ride back to Baker Street.
“It’s what he would want. And if you knew him you’d know that, so who are you?”
“Would you like to talk in my office?” he asked.
“Onto the subject of your daughter,” Sherlock said, as Gladys’ sentence trailed off at the end. She nodded and shifted slightly in her seat.
“Yes. Unfortunately one of your employees was found murdered today.”
“And this case piques your interest enough?” he asked.
“I believe that would be the lawyer’s daughter,” Sherlock replied.
Sherlock sat down across from John’s laptop, and opened the envelope, emptying its contents onto the surface of the table. Enclosed along with the report were two copies of each of the crime scene photos. One of each of them soon joined the others tacked up around the mirror. Sherlock stood before the wall with a pen, muttering to himself and making notes on his scraps of paper. The addition of the photos and report to his collection of evidence did nothing to shed light on either case. He ran his fingers through his hair.
, he thought.
More tags will be added as necessary as the story progresses. Certain tags will only apply to certain chapters, and I'll be sure to make note of those at the beginning of those chapters, just in case.
“Indeed. This investigation is all but dead in the water, if you’ll pardon the expression,” said Sherlock, adding the last bit as he saw John’s frown deepen.
“Are you sure?” he asked.
She smiled and held out her hand.
“Yes, and he thinks the photograph of me in the hat was the funniest thing he’d seen in a long time,” said Sherlock, rolling his eyes.
“For the mem- You’re having a memorial here? At the office?”
Sherlock didn’t answer, and simply reached for his coat.
The killer’s M.O. was all over the place. There was no apparent connection between the victims, who were of different sexes, ages, and races. They had also been killed in different ways, and in different places. If not for the numbers, it was unlikely that any connections could or would have been made between the murders at all.
“Is there anyone you can think of who might have wanted to hurt her?”
“I’m sorry, John. Go ahead.”
“This came for you, while you were out,” she told him.
Sherlock quickly put on his shoes before snatching up his mobile and his coat, and hurrying out of the flat and down to the street. The weather was cool, but the sky was deceptively clear. Sherlock thought to himself that it would be much more fitting for the sky to be full of clouds.
John was still staring at him as he slid his mobile into his trouser pocket. He quickly relayed the conversation he had had with Molly.
“Hi, can I help you?” she asked.
“John, I--”
“Anaphylaxis.”
When they arrived at the address, John paid the cabbie and followed Sherlock to a small doorway that seemed to be wedged between the two businesses on either side of it. Sherlock tried the door and pressed the doorbell when he found it was locked. A man appeared from a side room a few seconds later and unlocked the door.
“I won’t take up any more of your time,” he began. “Thanks for speaking with me.”
“It’s possible,” Sherlock admitted. “Fine. I’ll be back in a few.”
“There’s also no defensive wounds,” said Sherlock. “If someone were trying to shove an object down your throat, to which you were very allergic, wouldn’t you attempt to prevent them from doing so? She must have been incapacitated in some way,” said Sherlock. He glanced down at the coffee table, at the pair of teacups sitting amidst the various gardening magazines scattered across its surface. “And something tells me you’ll find the answer to that little portion of the mystery in her teacup.”
“Good, good,” he said, unlocking the drawer that held his prescription pad. He filled out the prescription and tore the slip off of the pad before handing it across the desk to her.
“They weren’t living together, but she did give me his address. I went over there and the landlord opened his mailbox for me. There weren’t any packages in it, but a lot of letters, as if he hadn’t checked the mail in some time. So it’s doubtful,” Lestrade explained.
“Gladys Jacobson,” she replied, smiling slightly at Sherlock until she realised her husband was looking at her. The smile faded from her face, and Sherlock could see what her eyes were red, and a bit puffy, and decided not to comment on it.
“Tell me about the lawyer,” he said.
“Krista Bates. But I guess you knew that. Are you with the police?”
“Nobody. She was a 63-year-old gardening enthusiast who was more interested in talking to her cat than most people.”
Sherlock was comparing the ketamine found in Agatha’s blood with that in her tea, for the sake of thoroughness, when John walked in. Sherlock didn’t look up from his samples as John hung up his jacket and joined Sherlock in the kitchen.
“Probably.”
“Medical examiner? He’s dead, too?!” Krista interjected, her voice rising in pitch.
Occasionally, Sherlock would pull a book off of one of the shelves and flip through it, murmuring to himself. He placed the majority of them back in their spots on the shelves, although a small stack had begun to appear on his chair.
“Nothing,” Sherlock replied, quickly realising that the car had pulled up in front of the lawyer’s office building while he’d been distracted. He paid the driver and exited the car. Then, he stood on the pavement for a moment, staring up at the building.
After spending an hour puzzling over the information in front of him, Sherlock made the decision to return to Mallory’s flat, as he had done with the previous case. With any luck, someone from forensics might still be there, so he would have no issue gaining entry to the flat. He wasn’t sure what he would be looking for, but he preferred taking action to the equivalent of sitting on his hands.
“Paul Franklin,” said Sherlock, and Anthony’s face fell.
A knock on his office door drew him out of his thoughts, and he settled himself behind his desk and answered.
“Yes?” said Sherlock, pausing to listen for a few seconds. “I already told you; the wife is lying. She only--” Sherlock’s eyebrows furrowed. “Is this a new case? Are you sure?” Another pause. “Fine. Give us a half hour.” Sherlock hung up, and slipped the phone into his pocket.
“She’s inside,” said Lestrade, turning and walking into the building. He led Sherlock and John down a short corridor to a doorway that was criss-crossed with crime scene tape. The three of them ducked under the tape and entered the flat labelled ‘1A.’ Lestrade stopped walking once they reached the sitting room. Two members of the crime scene unit were bent over, examining a figure lying in a reclining chair.
“On the right calf.”
Sherlock thought to himself. He quickly eliminated that possibility, however, because Lestrade was still keeping the bit about the numbers out of the press, and he knew John was omitting it from his blog entries. It also struck him as odd that this murder had happened so soon after the last one.
“Fairly good health, stomach was empty, and rigor mortis--”
More tags will be added as necessary as the story progresses. Certain tags will only apply to certain chapters, and I'll be sure to make note of those at the beginning of those chapters, just in case.
Another dot that Sherlock still wasn’t able to join was Irene Adler. There was no perceptible connection he could find as to what she could possibly have to do with any of it. He was sure there was no way she was even in the country.
Anthony led the way through the front office area, past several unoccupied desks and an assortment of filing cabinets, into a cramped, but organised office. He sat down in the chair behind his desk, before realising there was only one seat across from him.
John smiled slightly to himself, and chuckled at the idea of asking Sherlock to accompany him to a Hallowe’en party at his boss’ house. Still, he decided to ask when he got home. He glanced down and noticed the reply slip, which had landed in his lap. He picked it up and looked at it briefly, before placing it on his desk along with the invitation.
“That’s alright, John,” said Sherlock, interrupting him.
“That’ll be the autopsy report, thank you,” he replied, accepting the envelope from her. Her eyes widened slightly at the word ‘autopsy,’ but she said nothing, and turned to head back to her flat, closing the door behind her.
“If this is Moriarty, then--”
Well, that narrowed their suspect list considerably. Nearly anyone could steal a vial of ketamine or order it from some shady corner of the internet, but it would take someone with a much more specialised skill set to make it themselves.
Without a word, Sherlock got up, crossed the room, and pressed his lips to the side of John’s neck. He froze as he felt John flinch underneath him. Several emotions crossed John’s face in the space of a moment. The very air seemed to still, and the seconds lengthen, as Sherlock waited for John to react. John stopped typing, and a long moment passed. A huge crack of thunder rattled the windowpanes, but neither of them seemed to notice.
“Sorry, what?” John asked, a bit sheepishly.
“That’s the spirit,” said John, pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek.
“I asked whether you knew what happened to Jack,” said Krista, tucking a chunk of her hair behind her ear and avoiding John’s eyes.
? Sherlock thought. He’d watched Moriarty put the gun in his mouth and pull the trigger.
John collected his jacket, wallet, keys, and mobile before leaving the flat.
“I did,” Lestrade replied.
“Yes. Lou’s son from his first marriage. Bit of a twat, he is, if you’ll pardon my language. But this couldn’t have anything to do with him. He’s locked up in California.”
Back at Baker Street, John was finished his third cup of tea and rereading his blog entry for what seemed like the fiftieth time. He placed the teacup in the saucer and glanced down at the clock in the lower right corner of his laptop screen. Enough time had passed that Krista should be lucid, assuming she hadn’t needed to be dosed a second time.
Kate’s office was up on the fourth floor, and John spent the entirety of the ride in the elevator toying with the corner of the envelope that stuck out of his pocket. He was mildly surprised to find that he was alone in the elevator. On a day when they were so busy, he’d thought there would be more people around.
At the end of the corridor, he saw John. He was bound to a chair, and gagged. Sherlock hurried down the corridor, into what used to be Irene Adler’s bedroom. He knelt beside John, and set the gun down on the floor.
Sherlock nodded again and John squatted down in front of him.
“What’s with John?”
John chuckled weakly while Sherlock just looked at him sceptically.
After a while, she began to wake up. John grabbed her hand immediately.
“I’m not. Do you want me to prove it?”
“Okay… well if you need me, just call or write an e- mail.”
John made dinner of which Sherlock even ate a bit and then it was time to go to bed which brought John an awkward thought.
Sherlock smiled.
“Okay.”
The killer was a heavy man and so Sherlock gasped desperately for air but only a few moments later John was there and pulled the man off from him.
John was just about to enter his bedroom when he heard Sherlock.
When he came home he unpacked the bags and made himself a cup of tea.
John was watching him. He seemed really uncomfortable and that he even asked showed him in how much pain he still was.
“Oh.”
“Morning, John.”
He had told him that he had been brilliant.
After six hours, he was at the same height as his partner had been this morning.
Sherlock looked him in the eyes once more, a silent thank you, a silent promise to be there for him once the death was explained, before he turned and went back to the body. John imagined him ducking uninvited under the tape, silently beginning his process of methodical investigation, with police officers watching his work that looked more like a daydream.
“John found a spell and he did it. It worked. I’m back since yesterday. The end. Now can I look into these cases?”
“What? No… I’m not… I’m not in love with it!”
With that, he made a gesture to follow him and John and Sherlock obliged.
John smiled back now.
Sherlock just looked into the files and didn’t even bother to look at John.
There was a body on the floor.
Sherlock was still sitting at the kitchen table, totally confused.
Sherlock let his gaze wander through his living room and ended at John.
He patted again the piece of paper he had pressed on the cabin door and covered his teeth with his lips, thoughtfully.
John grabbed a novel to read but he just couldn’t concentrate on it. His thoughts circled around Sherlock. Sighing, he tossed the book away and got his laptop.
Or at least that’s how it had been.
John woke up with a start. He clasped the sheets of his bed and looked around. No one was here beside him. But again there was a loud crash coming from the living room.
Suddenly the curly haired woman spoke.
Teeth clenching he made it into a standing position. He was breathing hard.
“Goodnight, Sherlock.”
“It’s fine. I just would like to go out of the water- it’s starting to become cold.”
John raised one eyebrow but he wasn’t finished.”
“Very well then.”
“I…really? I mean yes. Thank you.”
Now they both saw themselves confronted with the possibility that Sherlock would be gone as soon as the case would be closed.
“Please. No one would be clever enough to do that. And a projection couldn’t grab things. Look.”
“We’re about to find out.”
Right now John was staring at the screen on his laptop unsure which title he should choose when suddenly Sherlock embraced him from behind while watching over his shoulder.
Everything hurt. Literally everything. He considered for a moment if he was in hell now. But no he could feel that he was lying on a couch. His couch. He could smell his home. The smell of old furniture which he had inherited from his parents. The smell of former exploded experiments.
The body suddenly moved away completely, stepping back and to the side. With a little distance between them John could see Sherlock's face bathed in what moonlight managed to fall through the open window, that same mania from before glittering in his icy eyes which were now turned towards him, the tiniest of grins playing on his lips. "There. He's gone."
to put it mildly. John had stared at the colour-coded spreadsheet of intensity for at least five minutes, certain that there must have been some sort of mistake – there was at least five hours work included on the first day alone, including reading course material that John had never even set eyes on before which was covered in notes that ranged from insanely detailed to snarky and sarcastic.
"You -" John bit his tongue, willing himself to stay patient. "I'm sorry. It wasn't... it isn't an easy choice. Being here. I would rather try and deal with it on my own."
"I don't understand."
"I'm not sure I know what you mean."
Sherlock nodded slowly, fingers wrapping themselves over his upper arms and gripping himself tightly. John did not miss it. "He's possibly even more antisocial than I am."
She stood abruptly, turning as gracefully as anyone can turn in slippers and making her way back out into the kitchen – more avoidance. God forbid she make eye-contact when discussing her husband. "He's been going to meetings at the community centre. He has to attend twelve of them before he's allowed back to work."
If John had been under the misapprehension that Sherlock would be happy about his catching a ride home with him, he soon discovered that he was sorely mistaken.
"Because that's how you work, isn't it? When you don't want to say something, admit something. If people keep asking you push yourself further and further away, rooting yourself deeper and deeper into the sand until there's nothing of you left. But
Mycroft eyed him closely. “Are you sure you’re ready?”
you, Sherlock, there was absolutely no need for you to do that – you can take that look off of your face for..." His voice trailed off as Sherlock too forced himself into a standing position, taller, far more threatening simply in height than John could ever be. "All right, calm down - sit back down -"
"True."
John's eyes flitted to Sherlock, teeth gritting as he felt the urge to both laugh and swear; christ, he never knew whether to love or hate her. "I don't even need to correct you, you
Harry shrugged as if it meant nothing. “It's just sex, John -”
has changed and that's exactly the reason I'm standing here now. Sherlock is my best friend and the last thing
A slight shuffling of feet. "…yeah."
"I promised to look out for Sherlock," Greg said simply, shrugging. "And... it's my responsibility to make sure he's not in danger of hurting himself. In any sense of the word."
"I'm not compl-"
R&R's appreciated, always!!
to make me talk about it. You know how, when you thought Irene Adler was dead, I kept pressing you? Trying to get you to talk about your feelings?”
Sherlock let a small smile slip onto his lips. “Mm. You needn’t worry about getting your privacy. I’m still likely to have days when I barely say a word.”
"Oh." John felt the uncomfortable pressure of knowing he'd asked a question that clearly had some unresolved issues attached. "Redbeard... is that in reference to anything?"
John will want to live with us." He swivelled to face John, eyebrows drawing down into a frown. "Won't you?"
John nodded stiffly. "I certainly do my best."
"Ignore him," Wanda advised a currently slightly overwhelmed John. "It's wonderful. You'll absolutely have to join us."
than friends."
It was like going back in time: the construct of his sentences, the stiff tone, the not-so-vague insult - John could barely recognise the man from last night to the one sitting inches from him now, yet in an odd way he found that it was… reassuring, maybe? Though he hadn't thought on it much, whether intentionally avoiding it or not, the truth was that his biggest concern was that things would change between them; he wasn't ignorant, he'd been there before – the dynamic of a relationship changed when... other things... were involved. Of course it was true to say that they hadn't yet specified what the nature of their relationship would involve; for all John knew it would be a whirlwind of a confusing summer full of secret kisses and suspicious mothers but it would all end once Sherlock moved back to Well Place and John... well. John still needed to find somewhere to live.
“He wanted me to tell you,” Sherlock muttered, glacial eyes observing the gambolling flames with the same intensity John had so recently accused him of, “wanted me to… explain.”
“So. Long time since we've done this.”
"No," John argued gently, shaking his head, "no, I don't agree with that and you'd only need to ask Greg to know how passionate I am about that sort of phrasing. To say that changing the nature of our relationship makes it something more than it already is would be to...
to taste, and so he did, his lips tearing away and brushing over the skin like wildfire and bringing about within him a sense of righteousness, a pulse of desire and a denial that there was anything wrong with this picture, nothing wrong whatsoever in finding his hands ceaselessly working at Sherlock's belt buckle as his own hips jerked ruthlessly to find the friction he so ardently needed and not being disappointed with the hiss of breath escaping from perfect lips and his own coarse grunt at the glorious sensation he had created –
Well, all right. He supposed it was now or never – quite literally. He knew himself too well. If he woke up the next day without having brought it up, they'd never talk about it and it would always be a source of oddness between them. Maybe it would just be better to clear the air. He took a deep breath.
She was unrelenting. "I have no one else to see today."
When he did awaken it was to a sound he was slowly becoming accustomed to, whether he liked it or not.
what we already have. It would be to say that our friendship isn't important enough, to either of us. So, in my eyes, it wouldn't be something more simply because we're adding another layer to it. It's just... developing in a direction we hadn't initially planned for."
A gentle prod to his shoulder jerked him back to the room, his head whipping around to face a very smug looking Wanda.
at his mother should he find out. Naturally, of course, John wouldn't say a word to him about it, it would just make their situation far worse if Sherlock felt his mother were in cahoots with his ex-friend. Just as naturally, John planned to make Mycroft's life a living hell with them. According to Mrs. Holmes, her eldest son would dress up in his mother's pearls and proceed to dance around the living room stark naked at the tender age of five, singing along to Elvis Presley; personally that was John's favourite.
"Why do you think it is?" Sherlock seemed to be genuinely bewildered, brow creased in confusion. "Why do you think we always seem to have to have some sort of... emotional...
She wasn't having any of it. "Nonsense. You're his friend, of course he'll listen to you. Mikey's already told us what you did with him in regards to his... well. His problem."
"Well, I wouldn't -"
“Then naturally I’ll accompany you.”
"Sherlock?" He could hear the distaste in her voice and, just as when Lauren had called him a weirdo, he felt the same lick of fiery protectiveness shoot up his spine. "What sort of name is Sherlock?"
"He's only twenty, he'll be a damned good defensive player if Mendley can get his head out of his ar-"
"No, I -"
An impatient sigh, gloriously typical of himself. “Just ask it.”
"That's hardly relevant," Sherlock snapped, whirling away from the useless cups of tea and striding over to the coat rack in the corner of the room, grabbing his long coat from its place and swinging it over his shoulder, slipping his arms in with one, seamless move. "Right, come on then, because either way we need to go to the bloody supermarket."
Sherlock realised he had not yet invited him in, stepping aside quickly and taking the bottle of wine between oddly clammy fingers and pulling it to rest against his chest. "He left half an hour ago with Lauren."
"My, look at the time – your Dad should be home soon, they usually let out at around two."
A foot came out of nowhere, too fast and foreign for John to move out of the way; the socked toe caught the end of his nose and forced him to roll over across his bed and push himself into a hasty seated position. He glared at the foot and its owner, rubbing his nose a little harder than necessary.
"When I took you on as my... mentee, shall we say, I was well aware of what I was undertaking. I understood the level of your depression and your dislike for assistance in all forms; it would take an idiot not to read that in your written tone, and as we've very well established, an idiot I am not."
“You’re right, though.” The interruption sounded strained, as if Sherlock was struggling to say the words he was so often hearing himself. His hands twitched awkwardly at his sides, looking awfully like a lost child trying to find direction in a new place. “I will.”
"I'm just going to keep asking unless you tell me. Or I'll talk more about you having sex with him. And being terrible at it. Are you hitting the g-spot? Because I think that's supposed to be amazing or something -"
April 17th 2013 – 10:22pm
Barry faded out on the radio and was replaced by a very emotional-sounding Whitney Houston. Sherlock did not move.
to what he had expected – but the majority of students in the class seemed to be girls, only nine or ten men dotted around the room. He was tempted to crack open the door to find out what class it was that Sherlock was taking, pressing his face up against the glass to see if he could read the presentation currently projected onto a giant screen –
More tags will be added as necessary as the story progresses. Certain tags will only apply to certain chapters, and I'll be sure to make note of those at the beginning of those chapters, just in case.
“Then why keep him around?” John asked.
“And the key for the desk drawer?” he asked.
“Do you remember--”
“Who found the body?” Sherlock asked.
“Ms. Bates was severely allergic to walnuts according to her daughter, and we found one lodged, whole, in her trachea. And there’s also this,” Lestrade said, turning and stepping closer to the body, the two crime scene techs moving out of his way. He reached down with one gloved hand and shifted the neckline of Agatha’s blouse a little bit, revealing the number ‘2’ that had been carved into the skin near her her collarbone. Sherlock bent down to examine the cut with his magnifier.
, Sherlock thought to himself, before hurrying back into the bathroom. The time on the clock appeared to read eight o’clock. Sherlock glanced at his watch.
The taxi dropped them off only a few streets away from Scotland Yard. The boy had been found in an alley. Sherlock couldn’t help thinking that the killer was growing even bolder, striking in broad daylight, and so close to such an important hub of police activity.
“Yes. It was a little difficult to discern at first, but he was killed in this alley. There are a few small droplets of blood on the ground near the body that aren’t present anywhere else in the area, and it’s unlikely that they would be there had he been killed in a different location.”
“Don’t try to butter me up,” said John.
“Fairly straightforward,” said Molly. “Single gunshot wound to the head. The number was the only other mark on him.”
“I have half a mind to go over there and knock him on his arse,” said John.
“You said you had bad news?” Anthony asked.
“What’s going on?” John mouthed.
“I feel fine. I just need a refill of my blood pressure medication.”
“Lock it again on your way out.” The landlord said, unlocking the door and turning to head back to his flat.
“Already??”
That was the one thing he still couldn’t figure out after pondering it in the shower. Why would Moriarty go to the trouble of murdering six people by his own hand? That had never been his style.
When Sherlock returned his attention to the samples and gave no indication that he was going to say more, John frowned slightly.
After a long moment, the woman behind the desk noticed Sherlock[,] and gestured for him to come closer. She nodded in response to something the man said, and then turned her attention to Sherlock as the man left the room.
! Sherlock realised, standing up suddenly. With Irene Adler out of the country, it was possible that her old flat was vacant.
“Who are you?” he murmured.
, John’s brain supplied, unhelpfully. He pushed the thought from his mind, and turned back to face Marjorie, just as she hung up the phone. “Have you see Kate around?” he asked.
It had taken John’s perceived loss of Sherlock for him to admit his more-than-flatmates feelings for Sherlock to himself. But, Sherlock’s sudden reappearance threw off the delicate emotional balance John had reached. John allowed Sherlock to move back into Baker Street, but for the first month or so, they barely spoke. John went to work, came home, and spent a good chunk of his free time on his laptop, ostensibly blogging. Sherlock spent large amounts of time away from the flat, doing god-knows-what, although a fresh carton of milk would inexplicably appear in the fridge whenever the current one was nearly empty. John tried his hardest to delete Mycroft’s texts about Sherlock’s ‘danger nights’ as soon as they came in. Outwardly, John ignored them, but on those nights, Sherlock would come home and complain that his sock index was out of order.
“Do you think you can walk that long?”
“Of course you’re.”
“A what? This job doesn’t even exist. I have also never heard of this name either.”
“And yours?”
He didn’t want to force him doing something that made him feel uncomfortable.
He waited but Sherlock just crossed his arms and looked at him.
“Really? Who?”
Sherlock just nodded, because he saw how angry John was. He let go of the woman, and followed him to the door.
“Bollocks.”
When he had forced a few bits of toast in his stomach, he took his cup and sat across from Sherlock in his chair.
“No condom?”
Now he knew how Sherlock felt and how he smelled directly on his hair and neck.
He hated how his voice sounded more like a shriek than anything else.
There were just pheromones that forced people together.
She just waved it aside.
As soon as they had their breath back they chuckled.  Finally, John stood up.
“So… shall we start?”
John laughed a bit at that.
He just had to bond with him!
“Honey, he’s an Alpha, I can’t force
The detective rolled the eyes, hands on hips.
“I always hated it when he dated someone and I was always relieved when these relationships ended. I always wanted to be near him and when he was kidnapped I was out of my mind! And I can guarantee you that if he had died at that time; I would have ended my life too! All of this was before the bonding! You don’t know anything! You don’t know how much I love him!”
John realised that he had no pain in his leg and that he didn’t even think about the cane.
Molly blushed and Sherlock frowned.
So it meant a lot to John that Sherlock trusted him that much when he hugged him.
He closed his eyes and braced himself for what was about to come when Sebastian had successfully shoved his own trousers and pants down and was now pressing his length to Sherlock’s buttocks.
Now he began to pace back and forth while speaking.
“I’m okay. My muscles and my skin aren’t that well but otherwise, everything is fine.”
“Yes.”
After that, he had had to prepare everything for it.
John shot him an unbelieving look and carried Mrs Hudson carefully onto the couch.
Everything underlies your mercy.
There he was standing and reflecting the last four weeks of his life.
“Clothes. John. I have no clothes beside them! “
He swallowed. There was no going back now.
“Oh, come on, Sherlock. I basically pressured you to do this. You didn’t want this when I asked you to bond with me the first time. You only agreed because I blackmailed you.”
Of course, it didn’t.
“Deduced?”
One moment later a really flustered looking John was poking his head into the room.
Before Sherlock was raising one hand to stop him and then rushing into the bathroom.
Mrs Hudson just made a waving gesture with her hand.
“So…?”
When John prepared to go downstairs he hoped it wouldn’t be awkward because of what he had said. His dream didn’t help but he was the only one who knew about this. Or so he hoped at least.
John had a blank look on his face and so Sherlock basically growled.
The next day Lestrade called them and they headed to the crime scene.
John stood up and rushed into the living room. He remembered that the gun lay on the ground but there was no gun. He looked everywhere but he couldn’t find it.  He wondered if he had dreamed everything but no he was sure that all of this had happened.
For a few seconds the Alpha froze but then he put his hands on the Omega’s back.
But John had no such luck and it was more than hurtful.
So they packed everything they needed, including baby oil and set off.
Quod exanimo corpori vigorare possis.
Sherlock smirked.
“Oh, John. Sherlock worked with the police. I remember he told me that he had his first big case and oh he was so excited. I hadn’t seen him that alive since his parents died. But everything went wrong.”
As soon as his eyes focused on Sherlock he smiled a dazzling bright smile, which Sherlock had to return.
John had told him that he’d fallen in love with him and he knew that he would do anything - everything - for him; he risked his life for him often enough now, so no need to prove it.Sherlock had assured him that the feeling was mutual.
Then he started slowly to open the buttons on the shirt. When he reached the lower abdomen he hesitated.
Sherlock only frowned in return.
“Um... what is your favourite colour?”
He couldn’t tell if they were blue or green or grey. Probably each of them.
But this was different. He had two options. Either he was going to lose his whole family, or they had to pretend to be just flatmates, testing their relationship.
“John… you can’t possibly seriously consider doing this.”
Sherlock hadn’t moved an inch, too busy with staring at John.
“Don’t look so worried, John! Dad met her. I mean, knowing that she is my girlfriend. He … he was nice to her, and he said that he was happy for me.”
“When I was in college, I used to drink a lot with my friends. We often went to parties, and most of the time I didn’t even know whose party it was. Some of the people were…I don’t know… they seemed kind of odd. They made a lot of weird comments, but I ignored them. Then one evening I drank a lot, and suddenly I didn’t feel very well. I was dizzy and I could barely talk - it wasn’t like any drunk feeling I’d ever had before. My friends were all too far gone to notice . Some of those odd-seeming guys came over to me, and one suggested that he take me back to my room. I accepted it, because by this point I was so dizzy that everything was spinning in front of me and I could barely stand, or at least that’s how I saw it. When we arrived I just fell on the bed, and I thought he would just go, back to the party, but instead he came in,  and closed and locked the door. At this point I couldn’t move or speak at all. Then he made some really nasty comments about me and what he wanted to do with me and then… he … he… just did it.”
His mouth was slightly turned upwards but it seemed like a secret smile – like it was only for John.
He opened his mouth to say something but then his gaze wandered to John and he shot it again.
During the whole drive, John was silent due to the fact that Sherlock seemed ready to rip everyone’s throat out which was new.
Even though he’d half-expected it, part of him had been praying for a different idea, hoping that Sherlock had come up with a solution he’d failed to see; he couldn’t believe what he had just heard. He rushed to Sherlock and took his hand, but Sherlock avoided his gaze.
All he knew about this particular relative was that her name was Ember. She wore an expensive-looking red dress, and had brown hair, which was shoulder-length. The drink that she held before she collapsed - some sort of cocktail - was smashed next to her, and a few broken pieces of glass had stuck in her hand and face. He looked up to meet Sherlock’s eyes.
Above all was the fact that a forced heat would be more intense and would reduce Sherlock’s ability to think straight during it even more.
“Afghanistan. Did you also deduce everything about me when I moved in?”
Sherlock opened his shirt wider and pointed at one spot. They both looked wide-eyed at the scar that was now there.
“I want you to bond with me.”
“You think that’s funny?”
“Good night.”
“Please, John. I need you.”
Her birth had been complicated and John had really been close to losing both, his mate and his daughter but in the end, they had been saved but it was sure that Sherlock would never be able to get pregnant again.
Sherlock joined his laugh and they stayed like that, laughing for a while. When they sobered Sherlock looked serious.
He ignored her.
“My lifestyle?!”
The street lights made Cody’s cheeks shine in a creepy shade of yellow. When his mother frowned and he pouted again, his face looked definitely like a cheese gâteau.
John joined his laughing. He was just glad that he was no longer in a bad mood.
“You’re welcome.”
Mycroft sighed and turned to John and Sherlock.
For a moment he just let himself enjoy the sight of his rarely sleeping genius.
He dressed him and this time nothing unexpected happened.
Sherlock snorted.
His life as he had known it would be over in eight weeks.
John raised his eyebrows.
Sometimes he had brooded days over why it wasn’t normal.
He looked even in the closet. Nothing. Then he checked the other rooms. There was nothing. He decided that if that had happened again he would go and find the source while he was hearing it.
On that evening, he finally snapped.
Earth, keep it safe!
“Oh, have I your attention now? Good. Since you are already talking about me and my intentions the whole time let me have a word and make it clear.
Sherlock copied John’s movement for a while but finally, they had to break it to breathe.
But that wouldn’t work for long. His heat would start sooner or later and then he would be helpless without a save housing which he wouldn’t be able to pay because his family would make sure to block every access to money.
Sure, he had had his work and had been successful with it. But at the end he had been alone in his flat, composing sad music and even sometimes looking out the window while watching the happy bonded couples on the streets.
John flinched.
“Price? What prize? Money?”
John frowned and Sherlock laughed.
“Oh yes?”
“Sherlock. You have no experience in such things and I believe that you’re quite naïve if you believe that he’ll stay with you forever. He’ll leave you eventually and then you’ll regret that you have no control of his whereabouts anymore.”
john - unable to let go of his still-simmering anger - scoffed. “What? All of a sudden you want to apologise?”
They moved in perfect, messy synchronicity, both sweating, both and murmuring declarations of love to one another.
Now Molly frowned.
John buried his nose in the dark curls of his boyfriend and kissed his temple.
He placed his head on John’s chest and his right hand over his heart while John held him close.
“Very well. I worked with a detective inspector Dimmock who was responsible for that case. You should ask to speak to him. Maybe you could tell him that you found notations from me where I explained everything.”
Meanwhile, Sherlock had to go to the toilet and he thought he had never been happier about that.
John waited a bit but then stood up and knocked on the door.
“What else?”
There was no pulse. John let a breath go he didn’t realize he had held.
“Why?”
John had known that he was bisexual since he was a teenager. Because of his family, he had never acted upon those urges until he met Sherlock.
“So I know very well what had happened and now I’m here now to talk to my newly alive brother. By the way, Sherlock you can come out now. It’s pathetic that you think that I wouldn’t notice you lingering on the stairs.”
John looked at him worried.
But what could they say? They were retired but not dead.
John cleared his throat. “We have to tell you something,” he started. Now he had the attention of everyone in the room. He froze for a moment until Sherlock’s left hand grabbed his right shoulder to show him that he was there. He inhaled deeply.
When he had come home that night he just couldn’t stop thinking about John.
“Oh, is that so? Go ahead.”
This was to this day one of the best decisions in his entire life.
“What?”
So that was it then, he thought while writing the title.
The other man narrowed his eyes at that.
He even tried to date Beta woman although that was always ending bad- either because Sherlock found a way to sabotage it or because they just couldn’t hold his interest for long.
John chuckled but Sherlock looked seriously confused.
Sherlock didn’t know what to do.
“Of course we have to make sure that he’ll have a secure and healthy life and to guarantee that we have to put him under constant custody.”
“What are you thinking about the whole time? Did something happen?”
With that, he left the room and Sherlock pressed his face into a pillow and smiled like a lunatic.
Even his eyes began to sting as he noticed that Sebastian began to unfasten his own belt.
John had to swallow around the sudden lump in his throat and freed his hand to lift his arm.
But soon there would also be nothing left of him.
“So… you can touch things? I mean if you’re able to throw stuff and use a laptop and make tea…”
It was never a problem for them that they were Omega and Alpha because, for them, they were just Sherlock and John.
He held his hands to Sherlock and waited until he grabbed them so he could pull him out of the water. After that, he hurriedly gave Sherlock the big towel so that he could cover himself.
The first sign for what was happening was the sinking snow around them-slowly you could see the grass beneath it.
“Um… hang on… that was when I was elven or twelve if I remember it right. It was the girl that lived next door. She was at the same age and her name was…Lilly, I think. They moved away a few months after this and I never saw her again.”
Sherlock’s face softened. “I know. I’m glad they’re trying. It’s just ridiculous that they’re still uncomfortable with certain subjects. And they still stiffen when they see us touching in any way. I mean we already avoid kissing when they are around, but they still look like they are biting into a lemon when we hold hands.”
It took embarrassingly long to achieve that and Sherlock was panting in the end. But he was proud of himself.
“Oh. So… you two…weren’t… I don’t know…a thing?”
John didn’t know what this meant and he couldn’t ask Sherlock at the moment because he was with his future Alpha.
John smiled, showing all his teeth. Then he let go of Sherlock’shands and leaned down to continue the kiss, gently at first, then hungrily. It didn’t take long for him to allow Sherlock to remove his shirt; it took even less time for Sherlock’s shirt to be pulled free, thrown somewhere - neither of them cared where - with a frustrated groan.
“Really? Whose?”
“Why would you… why would you think that?!”
“Out of (dis)order. Please have the good grace to stay back.”
Sherlock knew that John was watching him and that he knew that he was watching him back.
Mrs Hudson frowned and looked a bit puzzled but answered.
Sherlock crossed his arms.
The other man was silent for a while and John didn’t think he would get an answer anymore but then he spoke with a shrug.
“Okay, wait. I’ll help you.”
He avoided his gaze and kept preparing his breakfast.
“You meant have right?”
After a moment he cleared his throat and answered.
He seriously considered the possibility of fainting at the moment.
“Oh, really? That doesn’t sound like a real name to me.”
At this, Sherlock squinted his eyes and grabbed John’s shoulders hard while taking deep breaths in an attempt to relax.
A few moments neither of them said something. Then John broke the silence.
“Hm…as you may know every magic comes with a price. And so… you’ll have to pay just that.”
“What?”
It was an invitation toJohn’s cousin’s wedding. The date was for tomorrow, and hastily-scrawled post-it note on the back held apologies; his family messed his address up so it came that late.
His father snorted and shook his head. “And then?”
This had been his thinking until they had all presented and wow he would never forget how different they had acted.
Sherlock sighed.
John cursed himself as he looked through is clothes to find something for Sherlock to wear.
John had jumped back at all this and now he was frozen.
“Don’t worry- I can fight. Now go.”
The Alpha laughed and shook his head.
John smiled at him and Sherlock returned it with a little smile of himself.
Meanwhile John joined Lestrade who shook his head and John laughed fondly watching Sherlock sniffing at everything.
“It’s just, I thought I would never meet him again and now…Sherlock… I’m really sorry about what happened to you.”
He would still have heats but he would no longer be able to carry a child.
“That’s his first name.”
“What? Really?”
“Oh. Great. Good night, Sherlock.”
“But why?”
Now Sherlock looked shocked and with wide eyes and John noticed how what he had just said sounded.
He knew it was stupid to think that because the other one had the same choice as he had had where to stand. None.
Sherlock frowned again.
It was an offer to Sherlock to come closer and he took it.
“I believe that.”
“Okay, right. Thanks. Good night then, Sherlock.”
Sherlock brought his focus back to Sebastian who had his hands on one of his arse cheeks.
“Then… gladly.”
John frowned and thought about everything.
“So… tell me was it a ghost of a former loved one? Or no… wait… oh that’s interesting. You didn’t know that ghost when it was alive right? Oh, that’s good. Is she at least pretty? Tell me.”
And again.
He emptied the glass and went to his bedroom.
Sherlock nodded.
He felt like something was missing.
John watched Sherlock full of worry. He was alive now that much was clear but he had been miserable. Maybe this would never go away and he would have to live in pain forever. John didn’t know if he could live with that guilt.
He saw him longer than a second this time.
“But Mycroft is also alone!”
The younger one was the opposite of that. He was a bit wild not in a childish way. He was passionate about the things he loved. He played the violin and that more than well.
John didn’t expect that. He hadn’t even thought about that possibility.  He cursed himself.
John suddenly stirred in his sleep and rolled to the other side.
With new energy, he got out of his bed towards his solution which was currently making breakfast.
After a few seconds John restored his senses and he stood straight like the soldier he once had been.
Then he attached the machine and measured his blood pressure which was also completely normal.
Then the sun began to shine more intensely day by day.
“Would you help me get dressed? I mean I understand if you would rather not after…”
There his mother sat on the couch together with his Omega father and Mycroft.
“Alright. What he said to you about me… I mean, that warning he gave you... I think that’s exactly what happened to him.”
Then Lestrade took over and they all told what they had found during the investigations and Sherlock interrupted often to tell his opinion.
“I… wanted to speak with him about a case that was about ten months ago.”
Sherlock gasped and cramped a bit but when John looked at him he gave him a nod and so John massaged his hole further and used his knowledge until Sherlock was gasping for a completely different reason.
The next day they both waited anxiously for the call from Lestrade who would tell them the verdict.
Lost in his own head he didn’t notice that John had opened his eyes and was watching him with a fond smile.
Omegas were physically way weaker than Alphas and Sherlock got to feel that as he was pressed face forward to the wall.
“I love you, John.”
“Come on, it’s muscle training for your arm.”
“Are you jealous?”
“You look much better. Now fill the bathtub and help me into the bathroom.”
“No…”
His body was sunken and his skin was greyer than anything else. He was dressed in a black suit that was similar to what he was wearing as a ghost. Sherlock also wore a beige shirt and a tie which he would normally hate, John knew.
Then he began to thrust carefully into his partner’s tight entrance and now Sherlock was throwing his head back and moaning.
John smiled a bit.
Soon John had become a part of his life, he hadn’t even noticed it until he couldn’t see him one week because he had been away to celebrate something with his family.
Mrs Hudson grabbed both of Sherlock’s hands and looked at him with teary eyes.
Lestrade nodded. “Alright, I’m going to have a chat with the police and let them know everything. See you.”
An employer of the house opened him the door and gestured him to follow him into the living room.
“For God’s sake John, believe me, I wouldn’t do it if I didn’t want to do it.”
John was still in the bathroom but after a few minutes, he could hear the bathroom door opening and closing.
“Do you really think it’s worth it? I mean if I knew that someone holds my hands in his life- I would lock that person in somewhere. So that I could make sure that this person is safe and alive.”
Then John leant forward and gave Sherlock a quick but passionate kiss.
Sherlock gave him a small smile in return, and nodded.
That evening had been agony.
He didn’t get a sign of acknowledging so he just stood up and started making dinner. When he looked to the chair he saw that Sherlock wasn’t there anymore.
John put the bag on the ground and sighed.
After he unpacked the bags he made himself a cup of tea and sat again across from Sherlock.
One day later the sun finally reached John who was relieved.
“Mummy?!”
For a moment John kept staring at the body but then he opened his backpack to get the dagger and the scroll.
She only made a waving gesture with her hand.
He looked immediately around to find the source only to see him with his back to him, wild discussing with Lestrade.
This had also been new.
When he came back Sherlock was sitting in the exact same position he left him.
“Tell me something new.”
“Oh.”
“Please John? Would you please be that nice and help me?”
Sherlock just looked amused which only let John’s horror grow.
Sherlock nodded and moved to stand beside John, who sat in a cosy chair opposite to the couch where his parents lounged, with Harry in an armchair next to them.
“Everyone who was involved! Do you know what that means?”
He pulled out slowly, careful not to fall on Sherlock, and collapsed beside him. They were both breathing heavily and unable to move for a while. Then Sherlock rolled to the side, smiling at John, and John faced him and smiled back.
“Fine, would it help if I stayed here?”
“Everything will be fine. Don’t worry.”
“John, I already told you that I prefer nakedness.”
“You mean how I died.”
“Yes, but … mind to explain?”
“What for?”
He smiled and John returned it and turned his hand which was still caught under Sherlock’s to entwine their fingers.
“Let’s go to bed.”
After everyone congratulated them, Harry spoke. “Come on now, we all want to know. Who proposed and how?”
John laughed. “Wait a moment. That was a really short version of it and you left a few important details!”
They spent Sunday relaxing. John read a bit and Sherlock tried to train his muscles.
“Dad,” he started sadly. “I’m so sorry that happened to you. Did you report him?”
“So, it’s true then. You can’t even die like a normal human being, Freak.”
He chuckled before he pressed himself harder against Sherlock which let the Omega feel that the Alpha was erect which caused a shiver through his body.
John crossed his arms feeling a bit uncomfortable.
“Yes, be aware what you’re truly willing to pay. The one who’ll perform the ritual will be bound to the former dead one for eternity. This means if the performer dies someday, the other one will die too. Also, the process is irrevocable.”
He couldn’t tell if she remembered him or not – she couldn’t even speak, after all – neither scream. That was the whole point of it, after all. If she expected him to perform a great monologue pointing out every single reason why he was killing her, well – he would have disappointed her. He was too keen to live his life outside of a prison to risk his freedom for a twenty-minute narration in a bar toilet.
“I see bonding as a commitment and I would never cheat on my mate.”
“I said I would be.”
“No, it’s not your fault. But it was just a really bad day… but it doesn’t matter now. I mean you’re here!”
“Yes, I could also sleep in that bed. It’s big enough. Look, it was only an offer.”
His head snapped up and he met Sherlock’s gaze, which was only focused on him.
Slowly the body under them became warmer, before that they had been inhumanly cold.
Sherlock nodded.
One day later after John’s work, they sat down to plan everything.
He didn’t have himself under control as he was used to. That was the main reason why the next words escaped him when John’s wet eyes met his.
Sherlock hunkered down before John, and tried to get his attention with a gentle hand on his knee and a quiet call, but he failed. Instead, he wrested the card from John’shand and read it.
“I looked into the closet!”
The ghost just laughed wholeheartedly.
her, out of curiosity. For weeks. Grace Wilkinson and her tiny red-haired family, living on the outskirts of the City. It was like looking into a well, like making a wish.
He tried really hard to stay professional no matter what although seeing Sherlock topless again after such a short time was really something.
At first, it was a chaste kiss. It didn’t take long for Sherlock to grabJohn by the sides of his neck to hold him in place, and deepen the kiss, shifting until his weight pinned John to the mattress.
After a moment Sherlock breathed out and smiled back, defeated.
The woman seemed speechless and so John offered her the glass of water which she willingly accepted.
Sherlock looked at him, unaware of what had happened, and somehow unable to read John’s calm exterior with the anger bubbling and simmering beneath.
He gestured him to go into the living room while he was following him grinning.
With that he stood up and looked almost longingly at the slim figure lying in the bed.
“Spit it out!”
Sherlock held his now empty cup in John’s direction.
Sherlock frowned.
Sherlock smiled a bit and he sighed before he answered.
John, shaking with anger and - if he let himself admit it - a little fear, wrested his arm free wordlessly and walked away. He went straight to Sherlock and gently reached for his arm, while the woman he’d been dancing with looked scandalised.
He looked down to see that it was lube.
By the time John came back he was almost out of his mind what was the reason -he later claimed- why he attacked the Alpha as he did in a manner of speaking.
“And…?”
“Of course. That was extraordinary.”
John now pressed his lips together. He didn’t know how that woman could know all these things but he wouldn’t tell her more.
“Why are you looking this panicked? Have you regretted what happened or have you changed your mind?”
Someone was here.
If it had been possible he would have felt warm because of the gaze that was only fixated on him.
So he just went back to Sherlock and stood before him. Sherlock looked at him with a curious expression.
So he stood up as fast as he could and rushed down the stairs only to find Sherlock still sitting in the chair.
He beamed at Sherlock, smiling.
“Let’s ask him.”
The inspector still just looked disbelieving at John.
“Sherlock?”
“Yes, you’re probably right.”
John lifted Sherlock up, his legs behind his back, carrying him to the bedroom, proofing once more how strong Alphas were.
There was a man.
He closed the door behind him and hung his coat and scarf at the hallstand.
“And what would you do if you were alive again?”
“I sometimes even miss pain.”
There lying on the floor was an elderly woman. Her house was really big and it was clear that she was wealthy.
John couldn’t believe what he just heard.
John sighed as he noted the body. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he recognised that a sigh was a bizarre response to the discovery of a body at your cousin’s wedding - especially when technically this body belonged to a remote relative of his. He ought to be more shocked.
At the moment he felt like he was stabbed again – in fact, multiple times. The feeling became worse the longer he watched John.
John had slowly turned back and had looked up in Sherlock’s face with watery eyes which had broken Sherlock’s heart a bit.
Sherlock looked confused.
He only knew that as soon as he saw John or better smelled him and had confirmation that he was indeed alive that he had to care for him.
John nodded and followed the man while feeling like sealing his own fate.
“No, I’m just used to ordering you around.”
The sound of a slammed car door covered her last words as she dragged herself out of a tiny little white Volkswagen.
“Yes, I mean I always wished that I could touch you somehow which is really incredible because I had never had the desire to do something like that.”
Then John took a deep breath and spoke louder.
“Congratulations I guess? I never guessed you were the type for it. So? I guess this means that you won’t work anymore right?”
“Oh and John? You’re definitely an idiot.”
“You woke me up, you git. You smacked your hand onto my face.”
There had been accusations and yelling about disappointing them but in the end, it had needed Mycroft and the vow that he truly loved John and not just because he had been an Omega.
Sherlock nodded.
He was frowning at her and she was seriously giggling now. He waited till she sobered enough to talk normally again.
“Odd names.”
“Because Maddie’s death was ten years ago and it was presented as a tragic accident and he started killing them about one and a half years ago. Oh, and the police are idiots.”
Then John stood up and murmured something that sounded like “Alright.” and then avoiding the other man’s gaze started opening the belt and then the trousers.
“What is that supposed to mean, Mycroft?”
The jumper he had hated so much at the beginning was now catching the tears that he was the reason for.
“Everything hurts. It’s like every muscle in my body is cramping. And my skin…is so sore like I had sunburn on my whole body. And everything is just too much. Too loud, too bright. Help me, John.”
After what felt like an eternity, he was finally free.
Sherlock looked shocked like that was the last thing he expected John to ask.
“Alright. I think it’s time for me to leave. I’ll visit again to look after you- both of you, alright?”
“Okay, this is ridiculous.”, he murmured.
For the meal, they had to sit on a table with John’s family.
John went in and put the clothes onto the toilet lid. Then he grabbed the towel and stood in front of the bathtub.
Sherlock was now again studying his documents and didn’t pay attention to her anymore.
“What is it?”
She stayed silent during John’s talk and afterwards she just nodded.
that I was in a relationship with. I’m a good guy okay? And then the answer to your question is that you never flirted back. I mean not clearly and so I didn’t want to freak you out and stopped.”
John looked at his father in disbelief, but his dad’s eyes were fixed - he  stared at Sherlock.
During the whole time when John was being held captured he only could think that he would possibly never see him again and that thought made him feel like he couldn’t breathe.
He spoke, quieter now than before. "Greg. Please."
Sherlock was unable to stop himself from taking a few more steps into the room, close enough that he could make out the shine of John's eyes; the nudge his chest interrupted his train of thought for a moment, temporarily focused on the slight shimmer directed wholly towards him. He jerked his head forward slightly, forcing himself back to the conversation at hand.
“Her cat.”
Finally, a car stopped, and Sherlock clambered into the backseat. He gave the driver the address, and stared distractedly out the window. After a few minutes his mobile began to ring, and he groped for it in his pockets. When he noticed that the display read ‘Lestrade,’ he spent a short moment deciding whether or not to answer the call.
“Well, yes,” said John, feeling a bit sheepish. “I don’t really fancy going alone.”
“Could he possibly have been angry enough to do something drastic?”
“That was Lestrade. They’ve found a body.”
Sherlock scowled slightly. He couldn’t immediately fathom why someone would be so quick to remove Agatha’s plants, when rigor mortis hadn’t even completely set in yet. He pulled a small plastic container out of his pocket and bent down to scoop up a bit of the dirt from the pavement. As Sherlock straightened up, he pocketed the container and dusted off his hands before opening the door and stepping into the front corridor of Agatha’s building.
Sherlock sighed. He’d thought they’d made some manner of progress. However, he felt just as confused and even more frustrated than before. He stood up and paced from one end of the room to the other, muttering to himself as he went. Every few laps he paused to look at the wall of photos. He stopped pacing after a few minutes, and strode over to the second set of bookshelves. He wasn’t too fond of the idea of proceeding as he had with the books he’d chosen from the first set of shelves.
“Sherlock Holmes,” he said, shaking hands with her before sitting down on the couch.
“Yes, John.”
He had no intention of returning to Baker Street yet. Not when someone out there was being so morbidly interesting. Once Sherlock was outside, he hailed a cab and gave the driver Agatha’s address.
John found Sherlock seated at the table in the sitting room scribbling on sticky notes and frequently consulting John’s notepad. He was completely immersed in his task and didn’t notice John’s arrival. John crossed the sitting room and peered over Sherlock’s shoulder.
Inwardly, John hoped it wasn’t going to be as hectic a day as Kate was predicting, even though he knew better. Kate had a knack for being able to predict, with decent accuracy, when they were going to be swamped.
That definitely complicated things a bit. It would have been easier to find a lead if Agatha had an enemy of some kind. Although, John could hardly think what kind of enemies a woman her age could possibly have. He was drawn out of his thoughts when he realised that Krista was looking at him expectantly. She must have just asked him a question.
“You?”
“Then I can’t help you,” the nurse said, interrupting him. John sighed and started rooting around in his jacket pockets. He produced one of the police badges Sherlock had nicked from Lestrade and showed it to the nurse.
Sherlock digested the information, and then pulled out John’s notepad and began writing.
“I see no reason why not,” he replied.
She had been standing with her back to the door and all but felt Sherlock walk in. The frustration radiating off of him was nearly tangible. He said nothing and meandered over to one of the autopsy tables, reaching for the corner of the white sheet that had been draped over the body.
There had not been a single case since Sherlock’s return. Actually, as far as John could tell, there had been several. But it appeared that none of them had been interesting enough to warrant Sherlock’s attention. On more than one occasion, John had overheard Sherlock on the phone, with whom he could only assume was Lestrade, explaining why he couldn’t possibly take on whatever case had arisen. John could tell Sherlock was simply inventing reasons for not taking the cases. He just wasn’t sure why.
As she had been speaking, John had pulled a small notepad out of one of his pockets to write down the things she was saying.
“I’ll stand,” said Sherlock.
More tags will be added as necessary as the story progresses. Certain tags will only apply to certain chapters, and I'll be sure to make note of those at the beginning of those chapters, just in case.
“Fine,” said Mallory’s father, stepping aside and opening the door, rather reluctantly, to allow Sherlock to walk past him into the flat. Sherlock walked through the small foyer into the living room and offered his hand to the woman seated in a nearby armchair.
Sherlock made a noncommittal sound in his throat, but he sat up when John placed a cup of tea on the coffee table in front of him. Then John kissed him on the lips and retreated to his armchair with his own cup. He glanced expectantly over at Sherlock.
“Care to share with the class?” he asked, resisting a sudden urge to put his hands on his hips.
“Thank you,” she said, rising from the chair.
“You too.”
John closed the notepad and placed it back in his pocket, along with the pen. He figured he should probably leave Krista alone to rest, and one glance out the window told him he’d been there longer than he thought. The sun was low in the sky, turning the clouds pink and casting long shadows. John rose from the chair and offered Krista his hand again.
He passed the notebook back across the desk to Zoё, gesturing to the half-scribbled line on the page. Zoё took the log and examined it for a few seconds before her eyebrows knitted with concern.
Anthony paused and pulled a binder out of one of his desk drawers. He spent a few seconds flipping through the pages before returning his attention to Sherlock.
“Leave it. That one’s not yours.”
He turned and left the room without another word. John sighed.
Motion to John’s right distracted him from his thoughts. He stepped aside as Sherlock got up from his chair. He watched as Sherlock picked up the twelve sticky notes from the table and affixed them to the center of the mirror. Then he began to gather the pages from various autopsy reports into neat little piles. John sensed that he was trying to distract himself from his thoughts.
“Why a two?” Sherlock muttered, seemingly to himself.
There was a knock at the door, and Mrs. Hudson entered, carrying a manila folder. John accepted it, and thanked her, as at that moment, Sherlock was staring, transfixed, at one of his bookshelves.
“John!” he exclaimed a few minutes later.
“Transport,” he muttered to himself.
“So sorry to bother you,” he began. “I’m John Watson.”
The landlord continued to eye Sherlock for a few more seconds, and then stepped past him into the corridor, shutting his door behind him. He said nothing as he pulled a wad of keys out of his pocket and jiggled it around in his hand until he found the right one.
John hung up with Lestrade a few minutes later, and returned to his laptop, while Sherlock went back to staring intently at his bookshelves.
“I’ve been doing my best,” John whispered back.
,” she said, still sounding suspicious. “She’s in room 413. Wear this.” She handed John a ‘visitor’ sticker, on which she’d quickly scrawled ‘Greg Lestrade 413.’
“Colleen, please,” she replied. “Doctor Watson, I’m pretty certain we have this exact exchange every time I come to see you.”
John sat down in the chair and pulled out his notepad and glanced expectantly at Sherlock.
Sherlock took the file from John and spent a few minutes reading through the paperwork. As Lestrade had said, his cause of death was a broken neck. Aside from the number carved into the calf, there were no other external wounds on the body. The tox screen had come back clean, as well. There was no need for sedatives for a sneak attack. Sherlock passed the folder back to John and returned to examining his bookshelves.
The door to Agatha’s flat was still covered with yellow crime scene tape. Sherlock tried the door and was agitated that it was locked. He stuffed his hands into his coat pockets and thought for a moment. An idea formed in his head, and he took out his mobile and dialed.
“On one condition.”
Sherlock charged up the front steps and tried the front door. He was both relieved and confused to find that it was unlocked. It had been some time since Irene Adler had called the flat home, and the house had since been stripped of furniture. He moved from the foyer into the sitting room, only to find that it was unoccupied. The area of the wall that had previously been occupied by the safe had been reduced to a jagged hole in the wall. The other rooms on the ground floor were similarly empty, although Sherlock had found a slightly-yellowed newspaper on the floor of the kitchen that was only a few months old. Without bothering to take a look at it, he made his way back into the foyer. He drew John’s gun and headed up the stairs.
A flash of light and a triumphant burst of noise. "AHA!"
the case, I can keep a weather eye out for my brother."
“Regardless.” Mycroft’s tone quickly became sharper, focused; Sherlock had no need to look at him to deduce that his brother had enjoyed quite enough chitchat and was impatient to get down to the crux of the matter. “Let’s not waste any more time on this old argument when you clearly have something on your mind which apparently only I can unravel. I must say that I’m surprised.”
“It fits, though. I’ve had a few hours to think about it, plus, of course, the five years before all of this. Because I did think of it, which I’m sure you already know. Seeing as you know everything.”
The stomach-twist, the buzzing; the dark heightened them both. "Sorry."
“Well, we both know I'm not going to reply,” John muttered, leaning back in his chair and staring at the screen, fingers drumming idly on the desk. “Superior brain – Jesus Christ. I'll give you a superior brain...”
a lot of blood – and finding himself utterly exhausted just from having to think about it. The sound of water running in the kitchen and the quiet opening and closing of cupboard pushed him into action, manoeuvring his elbow until he could lean his weight against it to shift himself into a sitting position. He just about managed it, letting himself relax for a few moments against the back of the sofa to drag enough energy in order to lift his good hand to the buttons on the front of his shirt, a wave of frustration washing over him as he realised instantly that this would be near impossible.
"Pfft. Answer the question or I'll keep saying it. Sherlcock. Sherlcock. Sherlcock. Sherlcock and Piecroft -"
He couldn't control himself, the alcohol had too much power over him; two hours beforehand he would have simply offered a small smile, maybe even a wave, but new and more-than-tipsy John had other ideas. He walked in almost a straight line to the garden door, waving away protests at his departure from his apparently new, sloshed friends - "Air, I need air!" - and pulled it open, a welcome burst of cold air rushing in and hitting his flushed face with a freshness that felt almost bitter. He savoured it for a few moments before remembering why he had opened the door in the first place.
