“What is she talking about Cas?! Time to go where?! Tell me what is happening!” Dean begs the angel, who can’t even bare to look back at him.
Cas’ eye darted to something behind Dean and he turned around to see a woman standing there. Dark brown wavy hair, just falling past her shoulders. Her grey pants suit neatly pressed.
“Cas. You are NOT some girl at a bar.” Cas shook his head and looked down at this lap. “No, look at me.” He lifted Cas’ chin back up locked his eyes on his. “You are not them. You will never be them….You will never be them because I didn’t love them.”
He would say.
“Cas…” Dean’s voice was no louder than a whisper. “If you just let me in, we can work through this.”
Dean let out a big sigh as he walked down the hall. “Alright, let’s do this.”
A small smile creeped over Dean’s lips. “Cas. I didn’t have feelings for those girls. There was nothing there. But this?” He motioned between the two of them, the emotion on his face overwhelming. “This is different. Completely different…When you started to avoid me, I thought you didn’t feel the same way. I thought I fucked up everything. Royally.”
Dean glanced down and saw that Cas still had a hold on his elbow. He lifted his eyes to  the angels, “Uh, Cas? Can I have my arm back?”
“Sir, you just had a severe panic attack and you hit your head pretty hard. Do you know where you are?” The nurse asked, her voice calm.
“Ho-ly shit.” Dean swore and chuckled. Cas laughed, softly letting down Dean’s leg, a soft groan coming from Dean as the stiffness of having his leg yanked up like that showed itself. The ex-angel ducked down, kissing Dean deeply, the hunter raking his fingers from the bottom of Cas’ neck and up through his hair.
Dean sighed. “Well, you’re fine now. All I want you to do now is stay in bed and heal up. You’re no good to anyone broken.” He looked at the ex-angel with hope in his eyes. Maybe he’ll listen this time.
Dean stood from his crouch and attempted to scrub the exhaustion clinging to his heavy eyes. A thirty six hour bender of drinking without sleep has done a number on his body, especially now given Chuck’s lack of helpful influence, and he realized with popping knees and the newly discovered vision problems that he wasn’t the young hunter he used to be.
Dean shook his head when he heard ‘find a place to stay’. “No no, I can’t do that. I can’t leave him here alone. What is he wakes up and I’m not here? What if he doesn’t know where he is?” Dean’s heart rate started to climb again and his breathing got laboured.
Dean picked up his fork and shovelled some pasta into his mouth. He moaned in satisfaction when he realized how good it was, and then quickly bit off the pasta that was hanging out of his mouth and almost choked.
He stepped forward and rested his hand on the back of Cas’ neck, tears starting to fall. “Cas…you can’t…I…” He watched as Cas let out another sob. “I can’t lose you again. I can’t lo-” his voice completely gave out. He cupped Cas’ face in his hands desperately.
“I’ll just chop that sucker down and move it.” Dean shrugged and began to take off his seatbelt.
Cas looked at him quizzically. “Alright. What do you suggest?”
He had to think of something else.
“Well…” Cas starts to speak, but stops. He hasn’t thought about it really. He’s just been going with the motions. He’s been human before, years ago, but that was such a minuscule moment in time that he didn’t really remember what it was like. Now, it’s more permanent. He had to give up his grace to come back to earth. The only way he could escape and leave The Empty was if he left his grace behind. Human’s don’t belong in The Empty. If he had no grace, he wasn’t an angel, and he would be cast out, which is exactly what happened not even two weeks ago.
Sam is only half listening. He’s still crouched down, busy partaking in sloppy kisses, before pulling the dog up against his chest and giving him a rather emotional hug. The dog nuzzles him back.
The man isn’t even through the door before he swings one fist around and catches Dean, waiting to the side with a raised spray can and lit lighter. Both of which go flying. The man takes Sam down with a single punch. Becky is shouting. “Run!” Dean orders, before joining in the brawl.
Ah, the Supernatural fandom. I can remember when the first episode with Becky Rosen aired, and at least half the fandom was giddy from being represented, and the other half was enraged by what that representation – well, represented.
Sam thinks about it for a moment, then nods, grinning. Dean smiles, turns his eyes back to the road. The two of them smile to themselves, feeling free, and triumphant, and ready for whatever comes next. Sam stares out the window of the passenger side of the car for a moment, watching the night roar past them. Then he reaches down for the dial on the radio.
The answer to the end of violence in spn – the reduction of the need for hunters like Sam and Dean – isn’t to kill off all the monsters. (After all, how are you going to just stop ghosts from happening?) It is to put preventatives in place and offer support to those effected by the supernatural to reduce the risk of either recidivism or continuing the cycle of violence (like with Cole Trenton, or even the Winchesters themselves).
“This is going to be a thing with you, isn’t it?”
Dean holds Cas’ eyes with intent. The angel stares back.
“Mind if we make a small, uh, pit stop after?” When Sam raises an eyebrow, Dean searches for the right words, a little embarrassed. “If we’re heading to that part of town, there’s something I’d like to drop off at that mechanic shop. The one on Middleton Street.”
He’s pulling out a professional-looking flamethrower, complete with a propane cylinder that straps to the back and a nozzle that ends with a catch, when Sam joins him. “Dude,” Sam admonishes.
“Cas, man – ” Dean swallows, looks for words. “It’s good to see you. It is. I’m glad you’re not in the Empty or angelic Hell or whatever. But you
Sam looks confused, huffs a disconcerted laugh. Looks between his brother and the angel. “Cas,” he finally manages, “
In the canon, the show includes expressions of Dean’s grief: drinking to excess, a willingness to capitulate to death, signals of denial or repression in his reluctance to talk about Castiel or Jack. But that is just another example of the termination and regression of a 15 year character arc and growth on Dean’s part.
There will understandably be fans who read all the way through this because it was tagged as Destiel and come away feeling disappointed. What I imagine – and what I hope the reader imagines – down the road that lies ahead is a romantic, sexual partnership between Dean and Cas.
Dean shrugs. “They keep asking me to. I keep putting it off. Been busy, you know? Getting everything in the bunker set up. Spending time with everyone. It’s – it’s been good. But yeah, it’s about time.”
All of that takes a lot of something that makes for really boring television – administration. Something Crowley would be fairly good at, hence why I intended to write it into One of the Boys, but it is not something suited to the Winchesters themselves. We were never going to see this in the canon – except, potentially, in the finale. Because it wouldn’t need to be explored, or fully shown, or developed in any sort of episodic way. And grappling with the end of violence – or at least a partial end – in spn would have allowed for the thing we all ultimately really wanted: for Sam and Dean to lay their weary heads to rest, while still being able to save people from the supernatural.
“Can I, uh – ” she smiles cheekily at him. “Can I have the car too?”
“A wendigo?” Sam ignores his brother. “The two of you aren’t going after a wendigo, are you?”
Cas smiles cheekily, looking a little proud of himself, and glances up as if he can see all those puppet strings that never could properly bind him. “It would seem all of the criticism about my being naturally defective is true. Rebellion, it seems, comes naturally to me.”
“Yeah?” Sam is both pleased and hesitant.
With a flap of his old pea coat and a dip of his flatcap, Benny strides into the bunker. Dean gives him a hug, Sam shakes his hand. With a wave of his arm, Dean begins a tour of the newly renovated bunker, offers a beer.
“I’m just saying,” Dean teases.
Dean helping a pair of young hunters on a case, showing them the ropes, watching their backs. Eileen in a motel room, signing over a video call to Sam, who is at the bunker. Alex smiling as she patches up Claire, who sees her found sister grinning knowingly at her, and smiles awkwardly back. Not all families get along all the time, but its making the effort that matters. Cas and Meg in the bunker kitchen, kicking back, sharing a pizza and laughter after a case.
something hunters can offer them.”
a hentai channel. ‘Tentacle Love 4’ is on here. Man, throw in some Magic Fingers and I am all set!”
“So the guy at the desk says we’re only a couple of miles outside of – ” Dean controls himself and says with only the barest twinge of amusement, “Lone Butte. There’s no place in town to stay, considering the town itself is pretty small. So, we’ll shack up here, do some research, and take a look at –” he chokes on the words a second time “Lone Butte tomorrow.”
The library and the storage room, the old offices and the infirmary, everywhere resources and artifacts are being sorted and catalogued. Crowley, having removed his overcoat, carries in more items from his own personal stash. Rowena sorts through the spellbooks, making annotations and corrections. Sam and Dean examine and log weapons. Cas and Eileen work side by side properly labeling and storing items. Dean at the computer, researching. Cas, reviewing wards. Rowena sorting through spell components in the infirmary.
(It is absolutely worth noting here that this culturally-bound mental illness specifically effects the various cultures of the indigenous peoples of North America, in the northern United States and Canada. Beyond being a mythical creature, a wendigo is understood as a concept, of a person, society or organism (business, nation state, etc) that is infected and driven by an excessive and all-consuming greed. This need to consume, in whatever form it takes, leaves a path of destruction in its wake, and causes harm to both the one doing the consuming and those consumed. This conceptualization of wendigos has been used to understand colonialism and capitalism, and its effects on the indigenous peoples of North America, by native peoples. Hence why the “Monster of the Week” for this fic is set in British Columbia, and deals with the disappearance – and likely murder – of indigenous women by primarily white men, who are there purely to take what they can from the land. This is a serious and ongoing issue, and while spn is about escapism from the horrors of the real world, monsters are not bound by the imaginary borders of fiction.)
“And she thinks there’s some way to do that?” Dean asks, cynically.
“I’d like that,” Cas says, sincerely. Dean’s tension eases in light of his friend’s casual smile.
Dean nods. Violence, bloodlust, hunting. Those are all things he innately understands. As well as the difficulty that comes with separating himself from it.
“Hey. I just wanted to ask how you’re doing.
“Yeah, well,” Dean shrugs that off. “At least we didn’t go out like Game of Thrones. That was a mess.”
What would that look like? Well, it would mean making information about the supernatural available for anyone looking for it. Real information, reliable, credited, not the random lore the boys come across on the internet. (And yes, some gatekeeping would be necessary, with spells and such.) It means offering counseling sessions for families affected by the supernatural, either because it runs through their blood or they’ve been attacked by something. And providing those families with the means to continue to protect themselves, not just giving them “the talk” and then driving off. Here’s your salt, here’s what keeps ghosts at bay, here’s how to protect against possession. It means matching kids orphaned by the supernatural with families who know about it, and can help them process and heal from their experience. It means helping cryptids that are not predatory integrate into the society, so they do not feel isolated, like outcasts. And it means helping those that might become (rugarus) or have become (vampires, werewolves) non-humans manage their affliction, the same way we help – should help – people with mental health issues.
Dean Winchester was finally free, he was finally
When he entered Cas’ room he found the other man sitting up in bed, a white t-shirt on his upper half and blankets pooled around his waist. He looked different without his usual attire, more approachable - more
When they reached the location the monster radar had given them, the sun was setting, its golden rays peeking over the horizon as they exited the car and trudged across the field towards the location pinpointed on their GPS. When Dean finally saw where they were heading to, a sense of dread crept over him. He ran ahead slightly, just to make sure this really was what he thought it was.
Dean yawns, he still feels exhausted but he’s glad he’s awake and no longer in the garbled nonsense of a nightmare he’d been having. He doesn’t remember much but it left him with a very uneasy feeling. He vaguely remembers Bobby and Sam being there… and Bobby had told him he was in Heaven? But Cas wasn’t there, so Dean thinks it felt more like Hell.
“Let’s just– Can we just get going, please?” Dean begged, and Sam nodded sadly.
– was something you couldn’t have, but I want you to know, Cas, I’m yours. If you still want me, I’m yours. Always have been.”
“It’s simple Cas, you spin the bottle and you kiss whoever it lands on. Simple and stupid.” He adds, looking at Jo pointedly, she just winks at him again.
“I thought that wasn’t who you were?” Sam said softly, and Dean held back a sob as he thought of Cas’ words.
Dean gets every flavour of pie, despite the bile already rising in his throat warning him he probably won’t be able to even finish his first bite.
“Well, before you left you said that–”
As the beginning of the third week rolled round and Castiel still hadn't arrived Dean was spending most of his time confined to his room, unless there was a case or they were in need of supplies. Sam and Kevin were beginning to really worry about Dean, and Sam kept trying to reassure him by saying things like "I'm sure he's just lost" and "you said it yourself Dean, Cas can look after himself", but while comments like that had helped relax Dean in the first week, by now they were just putting him even more on edge.
what I’ve spent the time I was gone doing.”
But Dean isn’t listening. Shoving Sam out of the way, he glances around the small cabin; no one but the two of them in sight. He runs outside, but all he finds there is the lifeless body of the werewolf daughter lying on the path. Not a trace of his blue-eyed angel.
“Well, I mean, I know that,” Dean replies and Sam looks relieved. “But I figured he came back. I saw him when I– when I thought I was dying. I saw Cas.” Sam looks at him like he’s grown an extra head. “He appeared to me, so I just assumed he was the reason I’m still alive; got his angel mojo back or whatever.”
“Let’s get out of here, Dean,” Sam shouted, worry evident in his voice. “We don’t know who else could be out here, just grab Cas and let’s go.”

“But what did he mean?”
And then The Empty had turned on him. “I’m

something I wanted you to feel. You are a part of my family, and always will be.”
They sit in awkward silence for a couple more minutes before Dean decides it would all just be better if he went back inside, he turns away from the Impala and walks straight into Gabriel.
Dean stood, rooted to the spot, in utter shock. Cas loved him? Cas
Gabe winks at Dean as he leans in to kiss Sam who, Dean notes irritably, doesn’t seem displeased with his current situation. The kiss lasts far longer than Dean would like and he spends the whole time staring pointedly at the floor. He raises his eyes just in time to see Gabriel slap Sam’s butt as he crawls back to his place in the circle.
you’re scared, Dean, don’t try to deny it. I
It’s a very simple case and it doesn’t take them long to find the vamps responsible. Dean is surprised to see someone they’ve encountered before – best not to make the mistake of letting her go again. It all seems too simple to Dean, everything is going too smoothly. Nothing ever goes

"I didn't wanna play it either,” Kevin tells Dean as he sits down, "I was busy working on some translations and Jo called me up here for something
“Come on, Dean. It’s only a game, it doesn’t mean anything!” Jo laughs.
Dean Winchester had never expected to make it to forty-two, but somehow, against all odds, he was still here. Somehow, against all odds, he had overcome the destiny laid out for him. He had found love, family; everything he had ever wanted.
. These last few days, I’ve been a mess. I thought you were gone for good and I couldn't cope. Seriously, man, I’m just so,
“Thanks, Mom,” Dean growls after Sam puts the water back down. The room is silent for a minute while Sam just stares at Dean, a slight look of disbelief on his face. “I thought I was a gonner, Sammy,” Dean says eventually.
of what people might think. Scared of disappointing a father he could never gain the approval of anyway. Scared of losing the adoration of his little brother - but the look on Sam’s face made it very clear that he had had nothing to fear.
– and the parking lot is empty.
Dean is in the driver’s seat, Sam beside him. The dog is curled in the back, dozing. It’s quiet, just the roar of the engine, the rush of the road. The boys staring ahead, out into the dark. They have gone on a drive together just like this one countless times. And there are countless more that lay ahead of them.
Sam pauses, trots back down the two steps he’s taken. Dean waits halfway up, watching his brother, obviously proud of his brother’s new role.
“Sorry it’s not wrapped.”
Dean nods. He damn well does know. Sam too, though he nods for different reasons, different things that have had their claws in either brother.
Dean and Sam clearly don’t know what to say in response to that. They’ve never been particularly good about dealing with the moral greyness of that aspect of hunting.
Claire takes a moment to think about it, hands stuffed into the pockets of her leather coat, managing to look both badass and incredibly fragile. Dean’s letting his softer side show, and Claire is willing to be vulnerable if he is.
“Just, ah,” Sam smiles apologetically at Josie. “Just give us another minute, please.”
Sam stretches himself as he unravels from the passenger side. “Honestly? I’m just glad we’re here, whatever the destination. Those last few hours were brutal. I can’t listen to Eye of the Tiger one more time today.”
Sam clears his throat, wanting to be a source of comfort but also not intrude. “You, uh, you haven’t mentioned Cas in a while now. It’s been a couple of months, since…”
Middletown Street, where the mechanic shop is in Lebanon, is named after Charlie’s original last name as Celeste Middletown, meant to represent the chance at self-reinvention. Carver’s Pies is named for Jeremy Carver. Josie is a reference to Abaddon’s vessel, Josie Sands. Bucklemming got their due in the ranger station. Edlund’s Eats for Ben Edlund. Kripke and Singer got their due, as they did in the canonical finale, as the names on the FBI badges. And the Kerouac Restaurant and Lodge is named for Jack Kerouac, who’s work Kripke used as a model when constructing his original premise for spn and the Winchesters.
Sam laughs harder. “Yeah, sure, I’ll think about that.”
“And, how many souls did that take?” Dean asks uneasily. “Like, are they all gone?”
“ – and normally I would say this would be jinxing it,” Dean holds up his hands in defense. “But, I truly believe this is it. We

As the Impala roars past the Thanks For Visiting Kansas – Hope To See You Again Soon state sign, “Running On Empty” by Jackson Browne begins to play, set to a montage of the boys out on the open road.
“Yes.”
And that deserved to be represented in the text.
“You tell that sonuvabitch,” Dean says roughly, “you tell him for us that while he’ll never be enough of a dick to earn a pair of wings, he’s certainly earned himself an honorary flannel.”
Both Sam and Dean turn surprised, inquiring eyes on the former fangirl. She looks a little uncomfortable, somewhat called out.
Dean slamming up against the exterior of an industrial building in the dark, ushering over a young hunter with a wave of his hand. The young man scurries over, peers at the lock on the door. Dean keeps a look-out and gives instructions as the hunter-in-training learns lock picking skills on the job.
“So?” Sam asks.
Dean clearly thinks about it, then brushes off the offer. “Nah, thanks. Trying to cut back.”
“So’s that what you’re doing here, then?” He asks.
Cas narrows his eyes. Considers the question and the moment and the man before him. Nods.
“You two aren’t the only one who deserve the opportunity to live your lives free of divine intervention. There are others – ” Cas says, his grin just about slipping the reins, “ – family – who want to help. If you’ll have them.”
They set to work researching the local area and its history. Sam types away on his laptop while Dean scans newspaper articles accessible through the local library’s online collection. The last of the daylight fades through the green and brown plaid curtains. The boys turn on the moose lamps. Dean breaks into the stash of granola bars and chips he purchased from the motel vending machine.
gonna come back, right? And not just to stop in now and then. But actually stay. Right?”
(Also, the idea that non-humans are excluded from the afterlife simply for being non-human seemed exceptionally species-ist, even by spn standards. We’re told that “the souls of Purgatory” are energy that can be just as powerful as human souls in Heaven or Hell. Thus, monsters / non-humans have souls. And yet, their biology – not the moral weight of their actions – determines their afterlife.
“So, what happened?” Sam asks. “Twenty years, people start going missing again. Why?”
“He liked to – to set up scenarios, you know? And then watch how everything played out. I mean, maybe there was a time or two, to push the story in one direction or another, Chuck wrote what he wanted to happen, what he wanted you to do. You, or Cas, or – or Crowley, or whoever. But most of the time?” She almost looks apologetic, or maybe a little sad for them. “Most of the time, it was the two of you. Your decisions, your actions, your
is the fandom we should have seen,
A lot of fans were upset that Wayward Sisters did not get picked up as its own spin-off show. As much as I liked Claire, was interested in where Alex’s and Patience’s lives would take them, and adore Jody and Donna, I couldn’t see in the premier episode there being enough heart to the spin-off to carry it forward. It felt a little too CW-esque for me. That’s just my opinion.
Dean sets the gift to the side, and pulls his brother into a hug. It is one of those long, meaningful Winchester hugs, with their arms around each other, the grip of plaid shirts between fingers. Dean can barely see over Sam’s shoulder – or he wouldn’t be able to, if both of them weren’t breathing in the moment, eyes closed. The two of them, having made it out, made it through all that hell, together.
After some distance, the road ends, overgrown with grass and small pine saplings. The boys emerge from the car, dressed in their usual clothes, and take a look around.
“Books that detail the biology of monsters. Kitsune, Rugarus. She says she’s interested in trying to figure out a way to help people afflicted by the Supernatural manage what’s happening to them. Find a way that they don’t
Developments that were absolutely necessary to completing Dean’s character arc include his recognition – in more than just words – that he is far more than just a killer; embracing and getting a chance to live a life that is about more than just his brother and hunting; the shouldering of responsibilities that Dean takes on entirely by his own choice; a taste of the “apple pie” ie normal life; a logical and narratively fulfilling easing of Dean’s series-long anger and grief; and of course, the establishment of complete free will from divine forces.
There is the familiar flap of angel wings.
Cas gathering everyone together, explaining. The others nodding, looking from one to the other.
Crowley, dressed in dark jeans and a loose henley, laying the Demon Tablet alongside other highly valuable or dangerous items, closes the door on the new vault somewhere within the bowels of the bunker. He returns to the library to find Dean waiting for him, with two glassed of what must surely be Craig in hand. Dean passes one to Crowley, they share a smile, and clink their glasses together.
As the music begins to fade, Sam and Dean kick back in the library, wondering at and admiring what they have accomplished. The “then” of their story and their lives is over. The “now” is nearly at an end. What lies before them now is the road ahead.
We are transformative. Just look at what the Supernatural fandom has accomplished. Not just in the weeks since the finale, with all the fundraising for mental health and lgbtq+, but well before that. We have long been a fandom known for our sense of community, our willingness to give of ourselves, to support causes, to come together. That, for many, is part of what it means to be SPNFamily.
“That’s
“So,” Dean replies, “I don’t see why the hell not. Changing the world, from the ground up? Sounds a hell of a lot harder than all of the ways you and I have tried to do it. Apocalypses. Trying to – to rewrite all the rules, have a say in who rules Hell, who manages Heaven, who’s
about your powers. Okay? We never have. You’re one of
of that.”
“Okay,” Sam says, still confused but also delighted at Becky’s enthusiasm and good intentions. “That’s – that’s great, Becky. We – ” He incorporates a less than enthusiastic Dean for Becky’s benefit, “we’re really happy that we could, you know, inspire so many people. But, what does that have to do with what Dave was talking about?”
“Ben,” Jody says, stressing the boy’s name in a sweet voice and taking command of the conversation, “is a young man by the name of Ben Braedon, up in Michigan. He’s something of a hunter-in-training, though he only works locally and is attending college fulltime. He and Claire crossed paths on a wraith case a few months back.”
“And Eileen? How are the two of you getting along?” Jody prompts, a bit of her mothering tendencies showing through.
“Yeah,” Sam replies. There isn’t really anything more to say to that, and for a moment, the distance between those years with their father and now hang heavy.
Sam huffs lightly to himself. “We’re getting old,” he tells Dean with a sideways glance.
“You got a second? I, ah – ” Dean looks superbly pleased with himself, like a kid eager to share in a surprise, “I got you something.”
come first.”
thing. And,” it’s Sam’s turn to look proud of his brother. “I think you’ll be pretty great at it.”
They arrange the plates in the middle of the table where everyone can easily get a fork-load.
The room is quiet for a moment, the boys letting these words settle inside them. Cherng is content, having had his say, leans back on the couch, just being in the moment.
“People
“We call it the demon blade. It’s the only known one in existence. You can kill demons with it.” When Claire looks up at him, surprised, Dean nods. “It’s the real deal. ‘Course, there haven’t been any sightings of demons for a while. Not any that I’ve heard about, anyway. But you? Being out here, hunting? You’re going to face some nasty stuff. And I know – ” he adds, before she can interject, “that you’re more than capable of handling it. I know there’s gonna be a day when the name Claire Novak makes monsters shudder in their skin. But you don’t live long enough to see something like that,” Dean instructs her, “without being careful. Being safe.”
Dinner at Jody’s house, with Donna and all the girls around the table. Dean leaning against the Impala and sharing a beer with Ben. A birthday party for one of the Wayward Sisters, with everyone invited. Sam and Dean at Kevin’s graduation from college, shouting and applauding along with a teary-eyed, beaming Linda Tran. A disconcerted Benny being lowered into Garth’s dentist chair. Eileen crouching down, speaking softly to a cryptid, attempting to earn their trust and deescalate a situation. Crowley manipulating the screens in the control room to send resources and a respond team to a family in need. Dean, Claire, Jody and others at a hunter’s funeral, stalwart.
“Yeah,” Dean agrees, trailing off as he looks around at all the books and artifacts on the table. “Looking through all of this,” Dean gestures to the beginnings of his brother’s database and tries not to appear too hopeful. “you find anything new about closing the Gates of Hell? Or maybe” he hesitates, “getting a peek inside the Empty?”
“Too many,” Dean says with a smile. “Yeah, I know this old girl inside and out.” He reaches up, brushes the top of the dash, looking fondly over his Baby. “Wherever life takes us after this, she’ll carry us the rest of the way.”
“Dude!
“Hey there! Hey, boy,” Sam kneels down, gets his fingers in behind those ears, going right in for the scritches. The two of them nose to nose, in love the moment they set eyes on each other. “Look at you! Who’s a good dog? Huh, buddy? Yeah, you are, aren’t you.” The dog wuffs in agreement.
“Another car,” Sam calls back. It is a small silver sedan, sitting off to the side of the road, empty. Dean joins his brother and eyes the car. “It hasn’t been here long.”
Sam at the table in his new office. The room filled with books and artifacts, all neatly displayed. Familiar weapons and items arranged along the shelves and walls. Photos of friends and family stand in rows along the shelves, recognition awards from conferences he’s attended, souvenirs from trips with Eileen to various places around the world. A framed degree hangs on the wall. And where he can look up and see it whenever he needs to, there is a corkboard, covered in cards and letters. Handwritten, typed. Some with photos, some with smudged crayon signatures. Messages of gratitude from families. Sam smiles, adjusts the pair of wireless glasses he now wears to read. And returns to making an entry in the book open on the table - his journal. The next Winchester journal, and beside it, caught in the light from the lamps, are the initials of his brother and himself, and their mother. A family tradition, continued.
Sam is quietly laughing. “You ever figure we’d live long enough for you to become the grumpy old mentor?”
On the balcony overlooking the bunker, Sam pauses. He looks out over the control room and the library. And rather than seeing an empty bunker and slowly turning out the lights, Sam sees a community. He sees people brought together in a common cause – to help others – all of them hard at work, full of energy, and guided by good intentions. And Sam smiles.
“So when your friend Dave was talking about redefining what it means to save people. He wasn’t just talking about changing hunting, changing everyone’s perspective on monsters.”
Staying in motel after motel, breakfast and lunch and dinner in diners along the way. The road stretching out ahead, curving around bends, disappearing into tunnels and shooting back out the other side, the sun rising ahead or disappearing behind as the Impala crosses through small-town America. Quaint towns, gutted towns, ghost towns, towns just getting by. Some of the towns are ones the boys have been through before, worked cases in. State sign after state sign passes them by, the whole of the country open to them.
There was a beat, then, “I know you don’t want to be here. With me.”
“I don’t know! I’ve never had one before.  I guess the adrenaline coming down and then not getting any updates on Cas kinda got to me.”
“Sounds good, Sammy. I’ll get dressed and meet you at the car. I just need to find a shirt that I don’t care gets-“
Sam pinched the bridge of his nose and let out a long breath, “Seriously, Dean?” The older hunter laughed and clapped his brother on the shoulder.
Dean’s eyes went wide. He didn’t expect this from the angel, but he liked it. He liked being taken control over. From him always being the leader on hunts, if he could be dominated in the bedroom, it was a fantastic day.
Dean pushed his glasses up off his nose and rested them on top of his head. Yeah, that’s a thing now. Now that Chuck isn’t controlling their lives anymore, they don’t have the luxury of Winchester luck. Dean’s vision started to go and he found out he was now farsighted. He tried contacts, but he couldn’t handle touching his eyes with his finger. It’s hilariously ironic. The #1 best hunter in the world gets the heebie jeebies when it comes to touching his own eyeballs.
Dean quickly stood up and squeezed his eyes shut. He tried to control his heartbeat but it was almost impossible. He could feel it. The slight ache as it felt as if it was going to jump out his chest.
The hunter finally made his way to the bed side. He took in what he saw. There were cuts on Cas’ lips and cheeks. One bigger gash on his eyebrow. His neck was okay, as well as his chest, but Dean’s eyes stopped on the large bandage on Cas’ left side, just below his ribs.
Dean out a huff as his pushed himself off the wall and yanked his machete out of the wood. “Cas…” he answered, his voice hoarse.
“De-“ Cas’ interrupted himself with a groan. He squeezed his eyes shut.
Dean couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “What are you talking about Cas? You’re an angel! Heal yourself or you’re gonna die!”
Dean grinned. “Sounds like a plan.”
That was the extent of it.
It clicked in Deans brain what Cas was talking about, and his face immediately hardened. He straightened up and stared into his eyes. “Well, it’s hard to do so when that person won’t stay in the goddamn room for longer than 2 minutes. Maybe that person should’ve reached out. Maybe that person could’ve gotten the help that they wanted if they opened up alittle.”
“Cool. Lets go.” He put his bag of chips on the seat beside him, and pulled out of the gas station with nothing but gravel flying out behind them as they sped onto the road.
The two vamps ran at him.
“Do you have a machete in the trunk?”
Dean shook his head, “I was more focused on not dying. He’s was hurting, I knew that much, but we needed to get out of there. Anyway, I finally got him to the car and that’s…” his voice drifted off and he looked down at the glass.
Dean woke to a humming coming from behind him. He willed his eyes open, glancing at the digital clock on the dresser on the opposite wall, and slowly rolled over in bed.
A couple days later, Dean sat in the library, piles upon piles of books surrounded him on the table. He was halfway through a thick leather bound book and he dragged his index finger slowly across the page as he read each line carefully, not wanting to miss a single piece of information that could help him get his angel back.
The hunter didn’t know what to do.
Dean let out a sob. “No….no, no, no, no…” he cupped the angel’s face in his hands, staring intently. He waited for the angel’s eyes to open, but to no avail.
In a violent gust, the wind swept beneath the door and had it slamming open, creaking on it’s hinges as dried leaves rolled through the opening and slapped at Dean’s legs, sticking like plaster. “What the f-” he began to question, spinning on his heels only to be hit with another gust of wind.
“You weren’t close enough.” Cas said, his voice barely a whisper. “I needed to know that you were actually there.”
He wanted this to be a dream.
Then he heard something. Thumping…like footsteps. Running footsteps.
Sam knew his brother more than anyone else in the whole world. Of course he wouldn’t leave well alone.
Dean put the Impala into park, cut the engine and turned to the angel, “I’m gonna gas up. You pin out where this nest is on the map in the glove box.” and he swung himself out of the car, slamming the door shut.
“I’m fine.” That seemed to be his answer to everything now. “I just…I think I just need to lie down.”
Dean introduced Cas to Desiree and they became good friends over the 3 days. Cas enjoyed her company whenever Dean had to leave for any reason.
Then it went silent.
Dean is too engulfed in the current section he’s reading to hear Sam chirp “
Sam’s sudden interruption made Dean jump and let the breath he didn’t know he was holding go. He cleared his throat and quickly looked back down at his bag, pretending to go through his tiny check list again. His dignity still ain’t there.
Their phone call finally ended with Sam saying, “Text me as soon as there is any updates.”
Dean watched as Cas’ blinked weakly and his eyes opened only half-lidded. “There we go, bud. Up we go.” He said with a grunt and took hold of Cas’ hand and shoulder and pulled him up into a seated position, but not without a pained cry emitting from the ex-angel’s mouth. “I know, I know.”
Dean didn’t hear Sam calling his name as he ran into the room. He didn’t know Sam caught him as his knees buckled and the world went dark.
“I know.”
“Sir! There’s already too many people in there. You need to wait out here. We’ll come back as soon as possible with an update.”
A vamp came running up on Dean’s right and he flung his arm out, wedging the blade through the vamps neck and into the wood wall.
“We’re stuck here then.” Cas stated promptly.
Then the rattling stopped. The wind calmed and the world was quiet again. The crickets were back on their banter and all that interrupted was Dean’s soft open mouthed breaths, his body free of tension and his heart almost still.
“Cas?”
The hunter glares at him. “Ow.” He deadpans, which makes Cas’ chuckle. Dean sat up and peered into the backseat. “I’ll take the back.”
Dean sat next to the bed, his hands clutched together under his chin, and his elbows resting on his knees. He had been sitting there in the infirmary, for an hour or so, ever since Cas fell asleep.
Cas couldn’t help but grin and Dean smiled back. Dean slowly lifted his hand and cupped Cas’ cheek softly, the angel tilting his head into the soft drag of Dean’s thumb over his cheek bone. The hunter’s eyes fell to Cas’ lips and he moistened his own and he let his hand slid down to the back of Cas’ neck and put very mild pressure, making Cas lean forward and latch his lips onto his.
The emotions going through Dean’s head were out of control. He was angry, and scared. But my god, was he heartbroken.
Cas grinned, “Thank you.”
The next week wasn’t much better. Cas let the brothers take care of him when he needed it by bringing him food, a change of clothes. He would have good, long conversations with Sam, but whenever Dean tried to talk to him, or give him any attention really, Cas would close himself off. He wouldn’t engage him in conversation, he wouldn’t acknowledge him when he was in the room, and when he did, it was a small ‘Hello’ or a nod of the head and nothing more.
Dean twisted in his seat, bending his right leg and sitting sideways, facing Cas. “Missing as in…your grace?”
“Dean, I-” Cas began but Dean cut him off.
“Okay, move.” Sam ordered. Dean shuffled to the side and as quick as he could, he moved the rags and Sam put the bandage on and secured the tape around it. He applied pressure now with his hands.
And Dean wasn’t there. It tore at his heart.
“So,” Sam clears his throat, “I might’ve found us a case. So get this-“
Dean let out a small laugh. He watched as the ex-angel tilted his head towards him. A small grin appeared on his lips. “How are you, Dean?”
The vamps head dropped onto Dean’s chest and rolled off, leaving a pool of blood on his shirt.
They haven’t talked about it yet. The rescue. It never seemed like the right time between Jack being the new god, and all of them trying to figure out their new normal. No gods, no demons, no angels. Everyone was back to where they belonged, doing whatever the hell it is that they did before the world decided to try and end itself over and over.
“I-…” The hunter grasps for words like a fish out of water. “Cas…what did you do?”
Desiree opened the door to her apartment and walked in, Dean following behind her. He walked past her into the main room as she closed the door and dropped her keys into the bowl on table next to her.
“Alright,” he said with a huff. “My car ain’t getting down there unless we want to get stuck. We’re gonna have to foot it.” He looked at Cas who then nodded. Dean zipped up his jacket all the way and they got out of the car and rounded to the trunk. Dean grabbed his duffel with all the weapons they needed, plus a couple of syringes of Papa Campbell’s vampire cure, just in case. Cas made sure he had his angel blade on him. Dean closed the trunk and swung his bag over his shoulder. Him and Cas caught eyes. The rain was pelting them in the face but Dean could care less at the moment. He watched as the rain drops hit the angels spikey hair, flattened it and dripped off. Dean bet that he looked the same, but the way that the water rolled down the angels stubbled skin…Dean could barely contain his small grin and tiny sigh that sneaked past his lips.
“Yeah?” His voice was rough.
He took in the deepest breath he could and slowly let it back out.
“At the nest….a vamp got him….he…he couldn’t h-heal himself, Sammy…”
“Thanks Des, you were awesome the last couple days.” Dean grinned at her. Desiree stepped in front of Dean.
“Hey buddy.” Dean saw a chair earlier and grabbed it and pulled it up closer to the bed and sat down. “How you feelin’?”
“Dean…”
Cas was still. There was so much blood on him, Dean couldn’t see where a wound ended or skin began. The angels face was slack, his eyes closed.
Blood seeped through the rags slowly, but it was still an alarming amount of blood. Dean bit his lip as he felt a lump start to form in his throat.
He glanced over at the hunter. He was slightly leant forward with squinty eyes and he had both hands on the wheel. A few veins were popping on the back of his hand as he gripped the wheel tightly, steering back against the gale force winds that attack his side of the vehicle.
Cas couldn’t handle the knives digging in to his eyes and he had to look away. He turned his head to the side and looked across the room to where the wall met the floor. Dean frowned. He let out a long breath through his nose as he kept his gaze on Cas.
Desiree smiled. “Okay.”
A shorter one, but I think this is going pretty well so far! While writing this fic, I have been listening to kwajbasket non-stop. I'll most likely be editing the chapter titles later to titles of songs that go well with each chapter.  Anyway, enjoy!
Dean straightened up, clearing his throat. He stepped closer to the angel and placed his beer down on the table next to them. “Alright….Cas I-”
All Dean could do was stare at the broken man in front of him. The man that was always the rock in their team. The one who was strong, never backed down, and never showed his weaknesses.
The relief that washed over the hunter was substantial and his face softened. They both stayed there in silence, staring at each other, the agreement setting itself in invisible stone.
Cas’ eyes started to flutter closed and Dean cursed.
Sam nodded, “Well, yeah. It’s been kinda the elephant in the room all week. Did you guys have a fight or something? I’ve barely seen you two talk, let alone say even a full sentence to each other. He won’t stay in the room if you’re there. What happened?”
Dean reached and very softly touched the bandage, but a small gasp came from the angel that made him jump.
He pried the barn door open with the crowbar with minimal effort and the latch on it snapped. The rust almost eroded the whole thing useless. He was surprised no kids broke in yet and trashed the place. As he stepped in, he noticed it still had equipment in it like an old rusty tractor to his right and a hay elevator on the left. Pitchforks and saws hung on the pillars lining the center aisle and he spotted a wagon wheel hanging high on the back wall in front of him.
He glanced at his offensive hand and tightened it into a fist.
“What do you want Dean?” Cas asked as he tightened his grip on Dean’s thigh, digging his nails into the skin.
Except showering, neither of them were comfortable with that. Dean happily stayed outside the bathroom and played on his phone.
“So this is it? The deal? You dying?!”
They have been on the road for a few hours and they drove into this weather system maybe 30 minutes ago and unfortunately it didn’t seem to show any sign on letting up.
“Then how did you end up sleeping at the nurses?” Sam asked.
washed over him.
The hunter shut his mouth abruptly. Cas swore. He just swore at him. Cas never swears. He didn’t know if he even could. Dean was almost offended.
Cas shook his head. “That is not true. Dean, I…” Cas paused to think about what he was about to say. “I never experienced these feelings before. They discouraged the use of emotions in heaven, so I was conditioned to never feel them and well…I didn’t know what to do except distance myself.”
“Don’t ask. Anyway, he was about the same size as you. Let me get those and we can throw your dirty clothes in the wash. While you have a shower, I’ll make us something to eat. Sound like a plan?”
Nothing.
Dean was sat in a private waiting room in the hospital all alone. It was dark except for a small table lamp in the corner where he sat, slumped over, leaning his elbows on his knees and his forehead resting on the heel of his right hand. It had been 3 hours since he showed up with Cas, and it’s been 3 hours of nothing. No updates, no one coming to check on him. I mean, could he blame them? Two middle aged men showing up at the hospital absolutely soaked in blood and one unresponsive. How do you interpret that other than assuming their serial killers.
“Cas! CAS! Come on, stay with me. Talk to me dude.” His voice cracked.
The hunter looked to the right at the angel next to him. He watched as Cas brought his beer to his lips and took a small sip, a tiny droplet of liquid falling off his lip and down his chin. The angels gaze caught his and he put his drink down. “What?”
Desiree’s voice broke through his thoughts and brought him back to earth. She stood in front of him, with sadness on her face. “I know you’re worried about your friend, but I can assure you that he getting the best care in the state. The hospital has your cell phone number. They will call you if anything happens. I promise.”
Really good.
As Sam worked, Dean wiped Cas’ forehead and face dry from the sweat with his sleeve. Cas’ eyes drooped closed again and his head fell forward onto Dean’s shoulder, making the hunter freeze.
A lump was starting to form in his throat. Cas did not sound good. Not at all. “Stay with me Cas….” The angel’s weight got heavier. “Don’t die on me Cas!! Not today!!”
(Shuttr)
“Have you talked to Sam?”
Eileen sat up behind him and looked at Sam confused.
Dean furrowed his brows, “They said you were asking for me.”
Dean spots a cup of water on his bedside table and tries to reach for it, but pain immediately shoots through his body. His loud hiss wakes his sleeping brother.
? His head was spinning and, honestly, he had no idea what was going on. His best friend was sobbing in front of him and confessing his love while Death was literally banging on the door. There was too much happening and Dean's brain was not working fast enough to process it. Cas' gaze flickered to something behind Dean and he turned to see a dark, gloopy-looking portal had opened.
Suddenly Dean decided that they weren't in that desperate need of supplies, and if they were he could always come back later, the important thing now was getting Castiel to safety.
“Oh.” Is all Cas says, but he looks like he’s about to pass out from shock.
Sam grabs a cup of water from Dean’s bedside table and insists on helping his brother drink it, while Dean glares at him, clearly thinking he could do it himself.
about you, Dean. Please just talk to me. Talk to me about what happened with Cas, you’ve not been the same since then.”
“Yes, I believe that is the custom in a situation such as ours.”
“I didn’t think you’d want to come,” Sam responded, his eyebrows knitted together in confusion and concern. “You haven’t left the bunker in days…”
Dean continued anyway "I never expected to see you again, Cas." He murmured, gritting his teeth because he was
“Cas,” Dean breathed out, reaching up to cup the other man’s cheek, “I’ve felt this way for so long, Cas, but I was just so used to hiding it. I was so full of shame - of
They’ve been on the road for 2 hours. 2 hours of complete silence except for the radio playing Led Zeppelin so faintly you could barely hear the crash of the cymbals. The rain popped as it hit the windshield but all Dean could hear was the inhales and exhales of the man beside him.
“Is this okay?” He asked. Castiel licked his lips and responded with a hum, which was enough for Dean. He started to undo Cas’ pants and pushed them down. He looked down at him hungrily and found himself bringing his hand down.
It was 3 am when he finally arrived at the barn. He pulled into the dusty driveway and around a sharp turn behind some tall trees and shifted the impala into park. He grabbed the duffle bag and got out and headed towards the grungy, weathered barn, but not before he grabbed his .45 pistol out of the trunk, loaded it with Angel killing bullets. You know, just in case. Oh, and a crowbar.
The ex-angel looked up at the hunter. “Dean?”
“Cas…” he repeated, not as soft as before, but his voice cracked the slightest bit. He waited for a reply. He waited for the deep register of his angel to respond, letting him know that he succeeded, and that everything was okay. He needed the reassurance that it was over.
There is an awkward moment, while everyone gathers themselves. Dean refuses to make eye contact with anyone. Sam looks to his brother, to Castiel, who is also watching Dean, uncertain. After a moment, Cas raises his head and makes eye contact with Sam. He opens his mouth, raises his brows, looking for the right thing to say.
Cas tenderly hangs up his trench coat in his room, slips on a flannel shirt over a t-shirt. Looks himself over in the mirror. And smiles.
“A hunter?” Sam asks. “As in…?”
“And yes,” Dean adds, “I checked with Eileen. About your apartment and all that. Even learned how to say dog.” He makes the appropriate sign with his hand, a little clumsily, but it’s a valid attempt.
He glances over at his brother, knowingly. “You seem to have a pretty good thing going, building all of this. Running the helm.”
Sam laughs again, shakes his head at his brother, goes back to looking at the paperwork laid out on the table. When he looks up, Dean has returned – and he’s not alone.
tell me what’s going on.”
As the boys head over to the stairs leading up and out of the bunker, young Elliot runs over to them, with a tablet in hand, open to an active case file. “Hey, Sam, sorry. Can you just approve this real quick?”
The Road Ahead was written for the SPN Coldest Hits December 2020 challenge. Originally, the theme for this challenge had been to write a fic about what you thought happened next, after the series finale. That theme had been chosen because we believed –
Castiel looks between the two Winchester brothers, smiling slightly. The three of them, gathered together in that circle in Bobby’s house, reunited and victorious and free. They look to one another, smiling, just being in and sharing in the moment. There are still responsibilities they shoulder, causes they have bound themselves to, and people who need them. But they are welcome responsibilities, causes that matter, and people who give in return. Sam pats his brother on the shoulder, Dean shakes his head, laughing.
Dean chokes on his pie.
going to get around to writing all 40 more chapters of One of the Boys. It’s a Crowley-centric post-season 12 canon-divergent fic. And a lot of what Crowley builds in the later chapters of that series – yes, this is me giving it all away – is what is shown in the “family montage” of this fic. I’ve been hinting at the idea for years throughout other works, and it finally just felt like a good place and time to really bring the idea to its full fruition.
Something has caught Sam’s eye. He walks up the road a little further.
Dean looks up from something he’s working on and sees Crowley sauntering into the library. The former demon has his hands stuffed into his overcoat, a smug look on his face, raises a brow at the hunter. Dean laughs, strides towards him, pulls Crowley into a hug. Pounds him on the back. Crowley looks relieved, amused. He laughs and returns the hug.
“Yeah,” Dean adds, scrolling through articles. “That’s what I’m showing, too. Missing persons reporting began in earnest in the ‘80s. Most of the cases are from twenty years ago. Then nothing until it started up again in the last few months.”
“Yeah,” Dean agrees. “Yeah.” Then he smiles, and reaches up to adjust the rearview mirror. He turns the key in the ignition, and grins at his brother as the engine roars to life. “But we got a lot of miles left in us.”
“Most are,” Cas replies, “But the more recent souls are still in Heaven. Those that are still reliving their best moments. They will fade away naturally, once they’ve experienced what they need to experience. Like your parents.”
you are.”
I know I’m not supposed to point them out, that it’s the equivalent of “look how smart I am,” but as someone who is very sympathetic to Castiel when it comes to pop culture, I am very proud of the references and meta references I included in this fic.
Claire laughs, and they rejoin Sam and Jody, to exchange hugs and wish each other well. Then Sam and Dean climb into the Impala, Sam into the passenger’s seat, Dean into the driver’s. Their respective doors manage to slam at the same moment. They settle themselves in.
Cas falters, but in a purely human way. His smile ages into an expression that is warm and weary – and relieved at the welcome he receives. There’s a hint of Cas sass when he replies to Dean’s anger with: “It’s good to see you, too.”
Back down the road, almost swallowed by the shade of the pines, is a dark figure. It’s a man, a large one. And he has clearly spotted them. His shoulders slump, head down, and begins to move towards them, his own pace quickening into a run.
“Sam?!”
Claire holds the knife balanced between her hands, running her thumb over the spellwork along the blade. “What is it?”
Sam nods, forces a grin that falls away, feels for his brother. “Yeah, me too.”
Cas’ gaze slides from Dean to Sam, and catches the younger Winchester’s eye.
“We both have,” Sam insists in reply. Dean nods, steps back. Sam watches his brother closely, then adds. “Speaking of which, you remember we’re meeting Jody and Claire for lunch in a little while, right? They’re passing through, on the way back from that hunt in Santa Fe.”
In my defense, Lone Butte is an actual place. It’s not far from Vancouver. And when I was mapping out the area, it felt like fate.
Dean’s expression of “Ah! My bad” conveys he’s suddenly aware he was making a play on someone else’s court, and whether it’s because he’s matured or because the situation involves Claire, he obviously doesn’t let his thoughts dwell on any potential sexual scenario, like he once might have. Sam still gives his brother an exasperated look.
“With your father.” Cas says reassuringly. “Happy, and safe, both of them.” The boys visibly relax. “It will be a long while before it’s their turn. But it also means,” he adds, catching Dean’s eye and making sure he understands entirely, “you will never see them again.”
“Yes,” Cas replies, simply. “Jack believes rather strongly in the value of free will. He heard all of us, trapped inside what had been the Empty. And he let us out. Let the angels decide whether they wanted to return to Heaven, or truly end.”
In the parking lot of Edlund’s Eats, the boys make their way over to the Impala, clearly contemplating everything the day and this case has presented them with. It’s a lot to think about.

Dean looks surprised, in a good way. He claps his hands together, and then opens them wide, wiggles his fingers in a ‘gimme’ gesture.
For Sam’s character arc to really feel complete, the finale needed to show us that Sam could also have meaningful, lasting relationships with people other than his brother; that he was out from under the shadow of his father and his destiny as Lucifer’s vessel / moved past his feeling of victimization; that he could escape or redesign the more violent aspects of hunting, something that Sam in earlier seasons had strong feelings about; and that Sam had come into his own power as a Men of Letters, a magic user, and could employ his leadership skills to help people in whatever way he chose. Lastly, something that both Dean and Sam needed to have happen was for Sam to vocalize his willingness to let Dean lead his own life. And not mourn, but rather celebrate, how that allowed them both to grow as people and potentially grow closer as brothers.
Dean dropped the duffle on the floor next to the stairs and came to Cas’ side. “Thats a good idea Cas, let’s go-“
“Cas, stop fucking with me.” Tears stung at Dean’s eyes as he gritted his teeth and pointed at him. “Heal yourself right fucking now.”
Chapter title are songs by kwajbasket. Please listen while reading.
“You and Sam…you sacrificed yourselves…over and over…you fought for the whole world…this was my fight…and this is how I end it.”
Sam stepped back off the step and Cas started to descend the stairs, very slowly. He held the railing tightly, wincing with every step down, the impact of his heel landing on the step jarring his side. Dean still intended on staying close behind, but he didn’t hover.
Cas finally reached the bottom of the stairs and let out a relieved huff. Sam stood there, unsure what to do. He glanced at Dean as he reached the bottom of the stairs, hoping he would give him answer. Dean shrugged his shoulders.
“Dean…” it was faint, but it was something. Dean let out a shaky breath and glanced behind himself every once in a while to make sure he wasn’t walking into anything.
“Cas?”
The hunter zipped up the duffle and swung it over his shoulder. He turned to the angel. “We going or what?” He quickly stepped around him, barely knocking into his shoulder, and made his way to the garage.
And with that, he stepped through the barrier of holy oil.
“You didn’t see the huge gash on his side?” Sam exclaimed, his eyebrows shooting up into his hairline.
The brothers talked for another hour about the events of the past days and Sam decided to order pizza. No one was in the mood to cook tonight.
“Hey Cas…what the hell happened back there?” He didn’t hesitate. He needed answers, now.
But it never came, not in the form he desperately craved. The warmth of his body never retreated, never seeped from his softened stance as he blinked open his eyes. A film of smoke clung to the air, shifting with every move of his body as tendrils of the transparent grey fell like ribbons to the floor. Clearing his view of the figure before him, sat on the floor with their legs crossed in a delicate fashion.
“No no, I didn’t sleep with her. I slept at her house. In her guest room. She knew my name and why I was there and I guess she just wanted to be nice. It was better than sleeping in the waiting room that’s for sure.”
“You guys know where you’re going? Dean?”
He didn’t get the chance to ask Cas what the hell happened before he passed out, so he decided to sit there and wait, and he wanted to keep an eye on the bandage, just in case they needed to replace it again.
Dean bit his lip. He sighed and nodded. “Okay.”
Dean felt an overwhelming need to be closer to Cas suddenly. He stood up, shuffled over to the bed and sat down beside the ex-angel, their knees brushing ever so slightly.
