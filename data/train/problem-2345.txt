Sherlock hums. “It’s almost as if this little electronics shop isn’t Neville’s primary means of income,” he says.
“She’s clearly just as misguided as you are,” Sherlock said. He shook his head. “Why am I the only person on this planet with the ability to
Sherlock begrudgingly gave up on the ghost case—now referred to as the Mayfly Man—after hitting a series of dead ends. He tried to arrange another visit to the ghost’s flat, but apparently the landlord wouldn’t let either of them back. Sherlock pouted briefly and then turned his attention to other cases, allowing John to write up the Mayfly Man case for the blog.
Mary was rather more courageous with the eye contact, although it seemed to take quite a bit of effort. “Would you like me to offer it again?” she asked.
He heard the rustling still. Sherlock made a moaning noise that suggested the slowing of motion was taking all of his control. “John,” Sherlock said, his voice broken, needing. “Can I… Can I please…”
“Shit,” John said, placing his near-toppled wine glass on the table next to Sherlock’s as Sherlock settled to the side of him. Sherlock wedged his body between John’s and the back of the sofa until he lay at John’s side along the narrow surface, his chest pressed against John’s ribs, his leg tucked just slightly over John’s thigh. John felt a sudden heat settle over him.
Hugh gestured back towards the house. “I’ve got the keys for you,” he said. “I can give you a quick tour of the place before I head out.”
“That’s the café,” Darren said, gesturing to the building Sherlock was examining. “One of the caretaker’s main duties is to oversee the café. No electricity, of course, so the offerings are slim. Coffee, tea, some nibbles. Guests still like it, though.” Darren moved towards the building and gestured for them to follow.
John turned to see Sherlock jogging down the path from the cottage, his coat fluttering behind him. Sherlock still looked a bit shaken, and he still had the bloody debris in his hair. John paused along the road as Sherlock caught up to him.
“There are three doors,” Sherlock summarized, eyes on John. “The host asks you to choose one. Behind one door is a prize—a car—and behind the other two doors are goats.”
“Right,” she said. “That’s what I thought. So. Did you, John Watson, ever wish that you could be in some sort of non-platonic relationship with Sherlock Holmes?”
“Sherlock,” he said. “I think we need to talk.” He was still holding the bloody wine, for no reason other than giving him something to do with his hands.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” John asked. His voice sounded a bit odd. “Sherlock. Why didn’t you tell me this? Why didn’t you tell me what Moriarty threatened to do?”
“Very little,” Sherlock said. “Practically nobody in town ever saw Declan. It seems he only left the island on rare occasions. It would appear he was well and truly hiding out here, and doing a halfway decent job at it.” Sherlock waved a hand. “You know. Until…” He touched a finger to his forehead.
Sherlock’s finger circled and pressed right where John ached the most. John pushed himself against Sherlock and his finger slipped just inside and John cursed, eyes sliding shut. He bore down, taking more of him in. There was a stretch, but John didn’t mind. He needed more. Immediately. Sherlock’s lips found his and John whimpered into Sherlock’s mouth, encouragements and demands and needs.
John swallowed and set his fork on his plate, his appetite well and truly gone, not that it had ever fully arrived. He twirled at his empty wine glass, wishing it were full not nearly as much as he wished the seat across from him was. The other patrons of the restaurant chatted happily around him, chewing and chuckling and cheerful, ignoring the nutter who had been talking to an empty chair for the better part of twenty minutes. The music played on through the speakers, the notes of the violin managing to slide their way into John’s heart like a needle through flesh.
“I apologize,” Sherlock said. His voice sounded rough, cobbled together. “For…” he twisted a shoulder back in the direction of the far side of the island, “that. I shouldn’t have done that. Not any of it. It was unforgivable of me.”
“Had a feeling you’d fight me on it,” John said. “Getting you up the stairs was nightmare enough. But seriously, Sherlock.” His fingers moved through Sherlock’s hair—slow, smooth. “What the hell were you thinking? Testing a cocktail for drugs by
“No electricity means no light,” Claire said. “Previous caretakers found it best to plan their day around the sun. Wake up early, get to any chores and exploring you need to do in the morning, turn in once the light fades. We’ve stocked you up with plenty of candles, and you’ll find two head torches in the cupboard there, but it can still get quite dark out here at night. Coming from the city, you might not be used to the dark.”
The shower was scalding, nearly too hot for comfort. Still, Sherlock reveled in the sting of the water pelting against his skin, into his curls. He worked bits of plaster from his hair and watched the water below him grow dark with the debris sliding from his skin. The room filled with steam, nearly choking in its thickness. Sherlock worked a lather into his hands and scrubbed across his body, sloughing the dirt off in layers. He used John’s soap. He understood why.
You scratch at your head. Clear your throat. Your stomach is a churning mess and you have absolutely no idea what’s the matter with you. “Would you…” you say, wishing your voice were steadier, “would you care for some company?”
Sherlock went on saying nothing. John heard Sherlock take a breath that he very likely wished was steadier.
“For what?” John asked, stepping out of the car and moving towards the boot to retrieve their luggage. He didn’t make it more than two steps before Sherlock was upon him, flinging his arms around John and spinning him in a half-circle until he was dizzily facing the cottage, Sherlock standing just behind him.
John studied the pavement and supposed that Sherlock—dead as he was—had a point. “Alright,” he said, easing himself off the bench. “Let’s go poke around a condemned building. Seems appropriate for the day, I suppose.” He started off down the pavement, looking for a cab.
“Yeah,” John said. “She just learned how to count to twenty, and her accuracy at that is still a bit spotty. I think I’ll wait a few years before I start trusting her opinion on probabilities.”
Will’s hands were definitely shaking. His arms seemed to be shaking as well. “You don’t understand,” he said. “I
Sherlock wondered what John was wearing. Pyjamas, likely—loose fitting cotton trousers and a plain vest. He thought about asking John to confirm—these things are impossible to deduce over text—but thought better of it. For his part, Sherlock wondered if he ought to put some trousers on. Some pants, at least. Texting John in this state seemed a questionable idea at best. Sherlock made no movement towards his clothes. His free hand ran across his stomach, fingertips drifting across cool skin. He tapped another message into his mobile.
“I need more information on which branch Neville is likely to target next,” he says. “I don’t have the physical ability to have eyes everywhere at once myself, so…” he gestures back towards the woman, “I enlist eyes for hire.”
Sherlock’s hand was moving along John’s body, down his arm, onto his chest, along his side. “Don’t worry,” Sherlock said. “I won’t touch you below the beltline.”
John tried to say Sherlock’s name—tried with all his might—but could barely get past the first syllable before he was coming, his body shaking and swelling and twitching against Sherlock, his cock erupting, shooting streams of come onto the mattress and his stomach and his chest and an utterly unnecessary hand. John screamed and howled and buried his face into the mattress and the springs screamed right back. Then Sherlock cried out—a word that might have been John’s name—and John felt Sherlock’s cock swell inside him and he pumped and pulsed, filling John with liquid heat, sliding in the slick of his own come until John was gasping and wordless.
“Ah,” John said, his eyes still roaming across Sherlock’s body. “Yeah. Yeah, most likely. Yeah.” He grinned.
Sherlock tilted his head to the side, considering. “Sure, she turned out to be a serial killer,” he said, “but before you knew about that she was the person you loved. She still might be—she really was quite impressive in the end. The killings were well thought-out. I wouldn’t fault you. She was the person who you wanted to be with, and—”
You speak to next to no one. The eyes that land on you don’t see you. At night, the robotic arms move the city around. You’re the only living soul in London, the only real person. It’s an honor you neither asked for nor wanted.
and John was on top of him, pinning his arms atop his head and straddling him at the midsection. Sherlock blinked up at him, a slight flash of surprise darting across his features.
Sherlock felt John clench and shake around his cock as he stroked himself closer to orgasm and couldn’t hold on any longer. He shuddered and screamed and drove himself into John in frantic, rhythmless thrusts and the world exploded and Sherlock came so hard he saw spots. He fell forward against John, gripping at his chest as he moved, each stroke of his cock inside of John making him twitch and cry and then John was there, bucking against him, shaking and sobbing and spurting streaks of come all over the wall and the ground and his own hand. It was all there was and all there needed to be. It was perfect.
He pushed Sherlock onto his back and climbed atop him, straddling his thighs. He bit at Sherlock’s neck, feeling the vibrations of his moans against his tongue. Sherlock’s hands were everywhere—on John’s arse, along his back, in his hair.
“This is all rather meaningless now,” Sherlock said, handing over the flash drive to the Detective Inspector in charge of the investigation, “but I believe you will find that these bodies are the same individuals as the set of bank robbers on this footage. I’m sure you’ve heard of the Taibhse Brothers?”
“To summarize,” Sherlock said. “You wish to tell her that the two of you—three of you—are a family and families stay together. You—and I—are willing and able to keep her safe from whatever danger in which she finds herself, but she needs to return to London with you. And…” Sherlock risked a glance at John, “you miss her? Love her?”
with the kind of force that John needed. “Don’t misunderstand me,” Sherlock growled. “All that bloody jumper is doing is standing in the way of me taking you apart.”
Sherlock blinked at him. He narrowed his eyes. “He could have hurt you,” he said. “He could have…” he gestured back towards the photographs of the sheep, sliced open, with their organs strewn about messily.
“Uh,” John said, grabbing onto his seat as the boat lurched into motion. “Yeah. You could say that.”
barbed little comment be. He grabbed his whiskey glass back from Sherlock and took a long sip. “So,” he said. “The entire idea of family. Of falling in love. Of finding the person you’re meant to be with and committing to a life with them forever. You’re opposed to the lot of it?”
“Glad we could do this,” John said to Lestrade, his voice raised over the din of the pub. “Feels like I haven’t been out of the flat in ages.”
In front of Fitz, bunched up and trembling in the corner of the building, was a very unhappy-looking rabbit.
“I’ll take your word for it, John,” Sherlock said to the computer. He seemed to be fiddling purposelessly with the keyboard.
John felt his spit-slick fingers graze his hole and let out a gasp, his hand momentarily pausing on his cock. He spread his legs, leaning forward slightly against the counter, giving the arm reaching behind him better access to the part of him currently aching for touch. The tip of his finger slid inside and John cursed. He was starting to sweat, a thin layer of perspiration forming over his forehead. He worked a finger inside, trying to stifle his moans. There was not as much lube as he wanted by half, but it was enough and John could make it work. He needed to feel something inside him, needed to feel Sherlock inside him. John was nearly breathless by the time he was buried to the knuckle in his arse. He gave his cock a slow stroke and felt himself tense around his finger. He imagined the sound Sherlock would make at that, feeling John’s arse clench around his cock. John would have given quite a lot to find out at the moment. His hand started moving on his cock once more.
“I can’t,” John said. He found himself once again incapable of moving his gaze from the ruined jumper in his hands, the thing that reminded Sherlock of corpses when he wore it. “It’ll just put him off and it’ll ruin all we have and...I can’t.” John’s voice was starting to disappear on him, breaking out in chunks. “I’ll lose him, Mary,” he choked out. “I’ll lose him and I can’t… I can’t lose him. Not again. Not when I just got him back.”
A bit of him was also more than a little interested in kissing Sherlock again. He did his best to ignore that bit.
John shoved dirt over the anger. This sort of thing would not make his time alone on the island with Sherlock any more pleasant.
“Oh, of course,” Mrs. Hudson said. “I called them as soon as I got the sense that you lot were in trouble. I’m glad I came upstairs to check on you, though. Scotland Yard’s response times are bloody awful.”
Sherlock buried his face in John’s neck. He carried on laughing, sharp puffs of air tickling at John’s skin. It was infectious; John had to fight against the smile creeping over his face.
look. “Simple math, John. If Declan wanted to get the money to his family in little, paycheck-sized bits—perhaps a thousand at a time—it would have taken Will over twelve hundred visits to transport the whole of it. Even at two thousand at a time, that is still six hundred visits. Something else happened to this money. Just as something else happened to Declan.”
John’s brain was in danger of ceasing functioning altogether. “You were gone for two years,” he said. “Two years, fighting. Two years, being captured. Two years, being…” The image of the angry scars along Sherlock’s back leapt into his mind and John found himself unable to finish his sentence. “I would never have asked that of you, Sherlock. Never in a million years would I have asked that of you.”
“No it doesn’t,” John said. He moved forward. He could move this time—his legs weren’t worthless and stationary—and he flew forward, running into the street.
He doesn’t have to work to get your mouth open and you let him explore while you fumble with his overcoat, shoving the bloody thing off his shoulders and onto a pile on the floor. You set to work on his suit-jacket. His clothes are the sort that need hangers, you know. They’re meant to be neatly folded and pressed, hung up just so. His suit-jacket falls into a crumpled heap on the floor. You need for the remainder of his clothes to follow immediately.
Conor had loads of questions for the two of them about the Taibhses, how they turned up dead, and what the sheep had to do with all of it. Sherlock answered his questions with the air of a tremendously put-upon man, pretending he wasn’t thoroughly enjoying himself all the while. John nudged him as he began to provide a bit too much detail about the particular mechanics of death by drowning. Still, Conor stared up at Sherlock with unblinking eyes and a look of awe. John had a feeling that the lad had developed another Blasket Island hero aside from Pierce Ferriter.
“You saw me too,” he says. “You weren’t even meant to, but you did all the same.” He sounds very serious, and when you look back at him his eyes are fixed on you, those heterochromatic eyes with the small nevus just on the right iris that bloody
Sherlock walked into the kitchen and John did his best to fiddle the kettle without making it apparent that he had stopped breathing.
His mobile buzzed, a continuous sound, and John nearly leapt out of the chair. Gilly, calling to video chat.
“What you’d like to do,” John said, “would best be saved for when we’re back at Baker Street. Alone. With a quiet bed and a door that locks.”
If you had a brain in your head, you would be concerned. Alarmed. Leaving, at the very least. Instead, you find yourself more than a little intrigued. “That bloke you were following the other day,” you ask, dropping your voice, “is he here?”
John blinked. He had no idea what Sherlock was on about. From his perspective, John had more than an ounce of interest in being in this relationship, and not very much of it felt feigned anymore. He had been concerned that Sherlock might find his interest appalling, although this clearly wasn’t the case. “Where the hell is this coming from, Sherlock?”
Maintaining eye contact was more challenging than it had any right to be. “Do you want to remember, John?”
“The owner gets out of prison in five years,” John said. “Maybe he’ll reopen.” He switched their plates so that Sherlock’s lasagna was properly in front of him now.
left. You died, Sherlock. I was meant to think you were dead, that I had watched you die. What the hell did you expect me to do? Carry on at Baker Street forever, on the off chance that ghosts exist?” This was the space where the old anger might have risen, but in its place was only a sadness so deep John thought he might drown in it. His lungs burned. “Because I would have, Sherlock. I would have stayed right there, praying for a miracle, praying for a ghost, praying for
John recalled an old story about a man who bought a pack of biscuits at an airport before boarding his plane. Once on the plane, the man opened his biscuits and ate one. To his horror, the bloke sitting next to him on his plane—a total stranger—reached over and took a biscuit from his pack, ate it. The man was appalled but, being British, said nothing. He ate another biscuit. The stranger ate another biscuit. And so on. It continued in this way until the biscuits were gone and the flight was over. The man was filled with a righteous rage. The bloke next to him only smiled and exited the plane. The man gathered up his belongings and reached into his bag only to find...the pack of biscuits he bought earlier. As it turned out, the man was the biscuit thief the whole time and didn’t even know it.
“I thought you said the hard Rs were the most important.” John settled his hand on Sherlock’s waist.
John closed his eyes. Sherlock could see his face start to patch itself back up, turn into the soldier-wall he wore when things became particularly dangerous.
The boat was silent, engines off, rocking in the waves. Anchored down. They were waiting for something, the Taibhses. John could hear his breaths heaving out his nose, rattling the tape at his mouth with violence.
John was still seeing Appledore in his mind’s eye. He thought about the grand display of the house, an extravagant temple housing nothing, boasting of secrets that didn’t exist. He thought about the facade of Leinster Gardens, the posh white exterior meant to blend in with the rest of the street, hiding vacant space just beyond. He thought about empty vaults.
, his blood was pumping and his brain was firing on all cylinders and he was the one calm thing in the midst of chaos and he
Mrs. Hudson stood at the entrance to the flat, doing her best not to look directly at them. “I’m all finished up,” she said, “but the lot of them want to talk to you two next.”
Sherlock removed his hand from John’s shoulder but lingered on the bed a moment longer. He stared down into his lap, twiddling with his fingers. He opened his mouth, inhaled, looked as if he was about to say something. He closed his mouth again. He turned back to John, smiling. “I’ll be back soon,” he said. With that, he was gone, disappearing out the door and down the hallway in almost a single movement.
Sherlock ran his hands along John’s sides, his hips. He looked down at John with reverence. “What else would you be?”
John pulled Sherlock down on top of him, their mouths sinking together. The kiss was wet, open, and slow—gloriously slow. For the moment, John didn’t mind slow. John wound his arms around Sherlock’s back and Sherlock settled onto him, slotting himself between John’s legs.
It was January twenty-ninth, 2013, and John Watson was seated on a bench outside of Barts Hospital, trying very hard not to cry.
John laughed. He ran a hand along Sherlock’s neck, up into his hair. “You usually are,” he said. “But I don’t mind.”
He felt Sherlock momentarily stiffen beneath him, a small surprised noise escaping against John’s lips. Then Sherlock’s mouth moved against his—just a little, just enough—and the two were kissing. It wasn’t staged this time, an obscured kiss meant to look passionate but nothing but a sham, it was real—lips moving against lips, mouths opening ever so slightly. John caught Sherlock’s face in his hands and Sherlock wrapped his arms around John, his hands light on John’s shoulder blades. John kept the kiss chaste—they
Sherlock nodded. He wet another piece of gauze and ran it through the cut. John cursed some more. His hands were fists in his lap, twisting at the fabric of his vest. Sherlock carried on, wiping at the wound with the wet gauze, cleaning away the excess blood from the edges in slow stages. John panted and cursed just above him, slowly tearing a hole through his vest as Sherlock worked. Sherlock, who once poked through the lower intestines of a corpse that spent nearly two weeks marinating in the Thames, found himself completely incapable of looking up at John’s face at the moment. He had a feeling that he could either continue to clean John’s wound or see exactly how tormented John’s face looked as he did so, but he certainly could not do both.
Lestrade looked, at the moment, like a man who could have invented time travel out of sheer humiliated desire. “Mate,” he said. “I...I’m so sorry. I thought you knew. I thought… Well, it seemed like a long time coming, and—”
Sherlock nodded, swirling the thread around the needle holder and pulling through to make a knot. This was the bit he was most interested in at the moment, the bit that closed John up, made him whole once more. He tightened the knot carefully, holding his breath. Too loose and the wound wouldn’t close properly. Too tight and the skin could lose circulation. So many tiny ways he could accidentally cause harm to John. Sherlock bit at his lip.
John’s fingers ran across Sherlock’s shoulder, along the nape of his neck, into his hair. He was closer now, their foreheads nearly touching. Sherlock’s arm wrapped around John’s back, fingers splayed across John’s shoulder blade, pulling him in. He could feel John’s breaths dance across his upper lip. He could count the individual colors in John’s eyes.
“It’s just for a case,” John said. “It doesn’t mean anything, remember? This doesn’t change anything between me and you, it doesn’t change anything between me and Sherlock.” However, John was starting to wonder if that sentiment was ever so slightly not true.
Sherlock shook his head and John lowered the damp gauze to his chest. John was gentle with wound cleaning, taking care not to press too hard or too fast, but Sherlock flinched all the same, sucking in air through his teeth as the cold material pressed against his wound. The painkillers must not be at full effect yet after all.
All the sheep seemed to be alive and in one piece, so far as they could tell. Even though they had done very little about the matter, John felt an odd sense of satisfaction that they managed to keep the sheep safe for the night. Sherlock seemed pleased with the outcome as well.
Attempting to talk to Sherlock was likely ill-advised, but John pushed forward anyway. He had a lot that he wanted to say to Sherlock, and not very much of an idea how to say any of it. “It won’t be any different, you know,” John said. “After…” He gestured, not exactly ready to say the words
John quirked his head towards Sherlock. “Is that Sweeney Todd?” he asked. “Because that song has a rather different take on the place.
“I don’t know how to do this, John,” Sherlock said, his voice so quiet he could barely hear his own words. “I don’t know what I’m doing.”
John twisted his fingers and angled them just so and brushed against his prostate and had to shove his face against the tile of the counter to keep his shouts from waking up the whole bloody street. He pumped his fingers into himself, his body lighting up, sparking, ready to ignite. Sherlock’s name was in his mouth, on his lips, leaving him with every sharp pant of breath pushed out of him while he fucked himself with abandon. His hand flew over his cock and he moved his arse back against his own fingers, quickening the pace. His whole body was shaking and everything was closing in, open, raw, needing just a little more, a little more.
“I am merely pointing out the disingenuousness of your words,” Sherlock said. He was pacing over by the sofa now, taking care not to look directly at John. “If you are going to pepper me with banalities, you could at least do me the courtesy of being accurate.
,” John groaned, pushing back against the wall to move himself against Sherlock. His voice, rough and broken, was a command.
“You’ll find that the lamp is a perfect arm’s reach away from the bed,” Sherlock said, mostly because everything else he had to say was ill-advised.
Fitz sat himself on the ground, the object still in his mouth. As John stepped closer, he noticed that it was a pad of paper. Declan’s journal, which John realized he had never picked up from the spot he dropped it before he chased after the sheep-murderer the day before.
The two stayed like that long into the night, with one of them occasionally taking the head-lamp to go check on the sheep and do a quick scan of the visible bits of the island. John was a bit too worried to get much sleep, for fear that Will would return and attempt some sort of attack while they had their eyes averted. Will didn’t seem like the brightest bulb in the batch, but even he might be able to deduce that the sheep the two of them were hiding inside a cottage might just be the very sheep he had been looking for. Still, as the night wore on John’s eyes grew heavier and heavier. He found his head bobbing and dipping, barely able to stay afloat as Sherlock took his turn scanning the island.
“My parents said you caught the werewolf,” Conor said as Sherlock and John followed him down towards the harbor, bags slung over their shoulders and Fitz at their heels.
Sherlock stopped sliding. His body stilled along the slope of the hill, a toe dangling off the cliff. John was panting, his fingers digging into Sherlock’s skin through his coat.
Sherlock pulled back ever so slightly. It was a kindness that he didn’t glance down to ascertain if he was feeling what he thought he was feeling in John’s trousers, although John had a sense he already deduced what it was. Sherlock blinked for just a moment, but regained his composure rapidly.
Sherlock hums. “Must’ve paid off one of the regular security guards. Or possibly an employee. I’m sure a percentage of what is stolen is enough to buy a little loyalty.” The drone catches the bag in its hook and lifts the bag from the ground. It starts to turn and Sherlock grabs your arm, tugging you against the wall just next to the vault door. The drone drifts out of the door and back into the lobby, moving towards the ceiling with the plastic bag of money dangling from its belly.
John studied the garish flyer in his hand. He blinked. He shook his head. “You have absolutely,” he said, “
“Were we ever really in danger?” John asked. “Rosie and I? Did whoever was after you actually threaten either of us?”
John lingered for a moment, watching Sherlock walk away. He felt sliced down the middle and more than a little foolish. Had he really misread the situation last night so egregiously? He considered never leaving the island, finding the mythical little cave Conor said that Ferriter chap hid out in to kill all the English and staying there until the water took him. The wind slammed into John’s back, urging him forward. He followed after Sherlock.
“With a child on the way,” John repeated. He lifted a leg over Sherlock’s midsection, straddling him at the thighs.
“Obvious?” you ask. The two of you are still walking—a bit of muscle memory on your part, because you certainly aren’t looking where you’re going anymore.
Sherlock paid him no mind, and soon they had reached the end of the rock. They stood as close to the sharp slope of the island’s edge as they could, looking out into the ocean beyond. There were a few bits of land just past the island, but they were more oversized boulders than habitable land, jagged rocks protruding unceremoniously from the water, pounded by waves on all sides. Beyond those few rocks lay nothing. Ocean—grey-blue and glittering—as far as the eye could see. The wind tore at them, blasting at their faces and whipping their hair into mad tangles. It was an unrelenting, violent wind, the kind that stole the breath from your lungs and left you gasping. The air smelled like cold and salt.
“There you are,” he said, running a hand through Sherlock’s hair. “Thought I’d lost you there for a second.”
Sherlock rolled on top of the figure, throwing a punch just solid enough to temporarily immobilize the man. He pinned the man’s arms to his sides just as John reached them, the gun pointed fiercely at the man’s head.
Sherlock’s smile faded further. He shook his head against John’s hand. “I can’t,” he said. “It’s not safe. Not yet. I shouldn’t even be here right now.”
Sherlock forced himself to look at John. John’s mouth was a tight line, his eyes tired yet intent. He knew what Sherlock was going to say but very much needed to hear him say it. “You,” Sherlock said. “Moriarty’s return meant I could come back to you.”
“Didn’t quite manage to die,” John said, working his muddy coat off his body. “Sherlock certainly tried, though.”
Sherlock ignored him. “As I thought, you’re no better than that bloody dolphin everyone was mooning about,” he snapped. “Teaching yourself where the treats are. Learning which humans are just gullible enough to give in. Coming to me when you fancy a snog and are unable to find any more suitable alternatives. Biding your time until you leave. Well. I have absolutely no desire to reinforce that kind of behavior. I’d rather you simply left. It’ll be much more efficient that way, don’t you think?”
On a related note, John was not going to think about Sherlock. He was not going to think about Sherlock’s body on his, fingers in him, tongue gliding over his cock. He was not going to think about Sherlock sliding inside him with agonizing slowness, pulling him close and fucking him with an intensity that rearranged the colors in John’s mind.
“Yeah,” John said. He turned another page, deciding to leave Sherlock’s response alone. The rain picked up a bit outside, and the sharp hiss of water pelting against the ground increased in volume.
Sherlock was reasonably certain that he still remembered how to breathe, but he seemed to be doing it all wrong at the moment. His breaths were coming in shaking and small, and his whole body felt swimmy. He couldn’t reason, couldn’t think, could barely even bloody
. John couldn’t help but smile back—it seemed involuntary whenever Sherlock looked at him like that. The waiter busied himself at a different table and Sherlock loosened his grip but didn’t let go. John did nothing to move his hand either.
John tore the sopping bowler hat off his head, tossing it to the side without a glance. His hair underneath was clumped and disheveled, already wet from the falls. “You’ve been running from this since the start,” John said. “Since the moment you met me. You have been pretending to be some cold, unfeeling machine, and doing an abysmal job at it, by all accounts.”
He considered calling out to Sherlock as he stepped onto the sands, alerting Sherlock to his presence, but he didn’t want to spook the seals. He walked down the beach as quietly as possible, doing his best to be inconspicuous and nonthreatening, but the seals noticed him all the same. Their puppydog heads swiveled in his direction and they lifted their bellies to attention and promptly flopped themselves around and retreated to the water, tails and flippers slapping the sand as they moved.
It would have been a lot for any hour of the day, but at half-seven in the morning, it was especially a lot.
it is,” John said. It had been approximately two days since Sherlock had a case. Despite the fact that the case he just solved involved a triple murder and no more than two attempts on the both of their lives, it was about time for Sherlock to slip into a bored strop. As luck would have it, they were at the elder Holmes’ family cottage for the holidays—at the insistence of Mummy Holmes and the begrudging acquiescence of Sherlock and Mycroft—which hindered Sherlock’s usual destructive bored habits quite a bit and relegated him to simply pouting and complaining. John dealt with enough of that from Rosie and was rather finished with the lot of it.
“I love him,” John said. It was the first time he said it out loud, he realized, and the words made a smile break out across his face. He laughed, shook his head. “I love him,” he said again, simply because the words felt so wonderful to say.
“We have been,” Mary said. “Mostly. With the exception of one fairly sizable issue.” She took a deep breath, seeming to steel herself. “Sherlock Holmes.”
“Nothing to worry about, darling,” Sherlock said, his voice measured. John was very aware of the reemergence of the pet name. Sherlock placed a hand on John’s shoulder and pressed his lips to John’s kiss in something that seemed meant to look like but was decidedly not a kiss. He turned to Hugh. “Hello.”
“Wouldn’t want that,” Sherlock said, and licked a thin line up the length of John’s cock just as he pushed his fingers as far inside of John as he could. John let out a string of disjointed words, a muddled-together set of
Thank you all so much for reading! Your responses to the previous chapter put the biggest smile on my face :)
Rosie looked back and forth between the two of them. She seemed to be deciding who to side with at the moment. She looked down at the notebook full of complicated statistics and flipped through a few pages. Her mind apparently made up, she nodded and pointed at Sherlock. “I think papa is right,” she said.
Sherlock’s gaze shot up to John’s. His eyes seemed deadly. “What?” he snapped. “It wasn’t what, John?”
Sherlock pulled off him and darted away, and John felt his absence like something ripping out of him. Sherlock tore through the kitchen, throwing open the cupboards and flinging objects aside, and then he was back, bottle of olive oil in hand. He settled beside John on the sofa and John pulled him close, mouth sinking against mouth, hands wherever they could reach. Sherlock somehow managed to work the top off the bottle of oil and slick his hand without taking his mouth off John’s.
“Oh.” John shifted, wincing slightly as he moved closer to Sherlock. Sherlock felt John’s hand move to his face, thumb stroking at Sherlock’s cheek. He almost nestled into the touch, nearly pressed his lips to John’s pulse-point. It was wrong that such a touch felt so comforting, especially when Sherlock ought to be the one giving out comforting touches at the moment.
“Reminded me of Darren and myself, if I’m being honest,” Claire said. “That’s probably where I got the idea that you two were more than friends. It’s like you fit.”
“Of course,” Sherlock said, “our return will have to be delayed somewhat in order to accommodate our stop in Dublin.” He gestured back towards their luggage, inside which, tucked away underneath their clothes and other belongings, lay just under one-point-two million euros. Minus, of course, the bit they had hidden in the duffel as a trap for Will and the stack that John had set aside to give to the O’Sullivans once they arrived in Dunquin, an apology for all the destruction the two of them brought upon the island.
“Isn’t it terrible?” Gilly said. She stood at the foot of the bed now, looming over John and Sherlock’s prone figures with her knife twirling in her fingers. “Dishonesty? Disloyalty? Such a blight on our society. I can’t make people more honest,” she tossed her knife in the air, catching it with ease, “but I
John thought he heard movement from inside, but it was too faint for him to be sure. He turned his head, pressing his ear closer to the wall.
John scooted forward and grabbed at a tattered piece of clothing on the ground. It was a shirt, partially on fire. He reached for the water bottle. Enough water remained at the bottom of the bottle to give the thing a bit of weight—enough to get it thirty meters, anyway.
“Did he jump?” Sherlock asked. “He couldn’t have jumped. How could he have jumped?” He took a step to his side, trying to get closer to the cliffs, and was decidedly not looking where he was going.
“You’re clearly uncomfortable in the chair,” Sherlock said, in no particular mood for John’s feigned arguments. “You keep shifting around as if it will help. It won’t. Your back is stiff and your arse is sore and the bed will be much more comfortable. Besides,” he directed this next bit to the ceiling, “when you’re next to me you speak softer. Quieter. It’s nice. It…” he shrugged, “helps.”
John swallowed. Sherlock’s fingers were moving back up his shaft, the single pad of his middle finger tracing along the vein that ran the length of his cock. John shook his head.
,” he says. “I’ve always found that catching criminals is much easier when one is actually around in time to
John straightened. His head swam. He stumbled forward. He needed to leave, needed to get away from walls, apparently. Walls were no good, especially brick walls. As it turned out, there were brick walls everywhere in this bloody city. John wondered when that happened.
When they separated, the both of them were breathing rather heavily. Sherlock leaned his forehead against John’s. Their noses nudged together. John could have bloody well flown off the roof.
Sherlock insisted that Mary wouldn’t be in the city for long. “This is a temporary stop,” he explained, typing madly at his mobile. “The first stop after the airport, that’s the most dangerous. Her business here consists of gaining a new identity and moving onward.”
Sherlock propped himself on an elbow and wrapped his fist as tightly as he could around his cock. It wasn’t as tight as John—he couldn’t make it as tight as John—but it would have to suffice. Slowly, he shifted his hips forward, sliding his cock into his fist at an agonizing pace. His body shook and his breath caught in his throat. He clenched his hand around himself, squeezing his cock within an inch of its life. He made a little whimpering noise.
him, teeth clattering, tongue exploring. Sherlock made a growling noise and surged forward, shoving John backwards until he collided with the stone wall of the ruins. John felt the jagged edges of the rocks scratch into his skin. His head bounced against the wall. He grunted and cried out and Sherlock’s mouth never left his, not once. John dug his fingers into Sherlock’s hair and Sherlock pressed against him, chests sliding together, lifting John partway up the wall with just the force of his body. John felt skin tear. He didn’t give a shit.
John was kissing him slowly, so slowly. Sherlock couldn’t quite kiss back, not yet. He carried on smiling.
“Despite what my brother, the entirety of Scotland Yard, and several commenters on that website of yours might think,” Sherlock said, “I do indeed possess the capacity to be
John unbuttoned enough of Sherlock’s shirt to uncover the majority of his torso and pushed the material off his shoulders, down his forearms. John’s palms followed the soft fabric as he slid it off Sherlock’s body, the warmth of his hands moving down Sherlock’s arms. Sherlock nearly reached out to him, placed his hands on John’s thighs, enacted Plan 1. He figured it was the painkillers, slowly starting to take hold, dulling his senses and turning bad ideas on their head. John’s eyes were on the bandage in the center of Sherlock’s chest. His mouth was a tight line. He seemed more affected by the sight of the wound today than he had been for the past few days; he must be feeling particularly guilty today.
Sherlock ran his hands down John’s back, bowed and heaving. He could feel John’s heartbeat thudding through his ribs, through his rumpled jumper, through his jacket that was a bit tattered from being ground against the wall. His hands slipped lower and he wrapped around John’s hips, still writhing against him in desperation. He gripped John hard and, with as much strength as he could muster, thrust into John with enough force as to nearly send him toppling into the wall.
Sherlock chuckled. The car lapsed into a momentary silence. A very specific part of John’s body had recently become interested in the proceedings and John mentally willed it to leave him alone.
realized this until this very second. The thought was painful, much more painful than he’d like to admit.
Sherlock looked over at Mycroft, who was glaring at him with a mixture of disappointment and rage that only his brother would have taken the time to perfect over the years. Then he looked at Mary. Mary sat across from Sherlock, leaning forward as she studied him, her large coat draped over her very pregnant belly. Her face was unreadable, and Sherlock figured that there was an equal probability that she knew nothing as there was that she knew everything.
“Of course you aren’t going home with them,” the man says. His eyes are back on you and he’s close. How the hell did he get so close?
,” he snapped, pointing at her with the octopus dangling from his fist, tentacles flopping. “Not one word about Sherlock. Not after what he did for you. Not after…” The sentence died in his mouth.
“I won’t even care if I go to jail,” John said. “It’ll be worth it. To beat his little rat brain in with a hammer for ever introducing you to this bloody problem in the first place.”
Sherlock smiled. “Good,” he said. “Because the owner of that dim sum place down the street has been engaged in some very questionable business dealings as of late and I’m not confident you can successfully replicate their pork dumplings.”
John made a little noise of agreement. The two of them had their heart set on a particular officiant—old enough to seem wise but not too old as to be aggressively Bible-thumping. Unfortunately, he was already booked for another wedding the day John and Mary planned to get married. That is, until very recently.
“Yes,” you breathe. “Christ yes you are. God.” His hands are on you and your vision is going hazy. “You’re so bloody good because you can see,” you manage. “You can see what you do to me. And then you do it more.”
“No bother,” John said, doing his best to stumble his way through an Irish accent. It still came out a bit like a pirate, so he figured his best bet was to say as little as possible.
“So yes,” he says, “It is entirely possible that I know all there is to know about you. It seeps through you like blood through cheesecloth and I’ve always had a bit of a hound-dog nose for those sorts of things. With just a few glances at you, I can tell what you had for breakfast this morning, what your morning commute was like, what sorts of patients you saw today at your boring little surgery.” He leans forward slightly, his voice dropping dangerously low. “I know what you were
Sherlock found his way back to himself gradually, blinking back into reality with hazy eyes. There was a sound happening. Something soft and low. Someone’s voice, a voice he could recognize from a coma, saying his name, calling him brilliant, amazing, extraordinary. Sherlock felt his lips move, slipping up into the shape of a smile. He wiggled at his fingers, his toes. He flexed his legs, shifting lazily on the bed. He seemed to have all of his limbs intact and accounted for. He considered that to be a massive success.
“Maybe you’re right,” John said. “About us not needing to do anything. We can just pretend it never happened. Just go on as usual. Normal.”
“Good,” John said. He pressed his lips to the corner of Sherlock’s mouth. “And what about this one?” he asked. “How did you get this?” The scar was small, and Sherlock was somewhat surprised John even noticed. Most didn’t.
“Um. Yeah,” John said, which he figured was not wholly a lie. “I thought you said you were free to watch her while I was over here.”
He heard the rustle of blankets from Sherlock’s bed, a soft, rhythmic motion. “You…” Sherlock breathed. “You had your…”
“I know the point of her was to get close to Magnussen, but you two seemed…” John was amazed at the sick feeling the memory brought up, even after all this time. The boy and the cat, all over again. “Chummy.”
“I know what I am, John,” Sherlock said. “The kind of man I am. I know I’m not the sort of person who ought to… The sort of person that anybody should…” He swallowed. “I had quite a bit of time with my own thoughts while I was away. Too much time, arguably. The isolation and the stress and the pain, it can turn your brain to pudding, make you think sideways, and I thought… I thought if there was anyone, anyone who
Sherlock ignored him. “You extol the virtues of romantic love while you yourself treat it as if it means nothing.”
John looked up at Sherlock and a smile cracked across his face. He erupted into laughter, loud and lovely. “You,” he said, his hazy eyes finding their focus as they gazed into Sherlock’s, “are mad. You are barking mad.” He slipped the condoms back into Sherlock’s pockets but kept his hands inside, not searching for anything, just resting. Sherlock realized that his hands were on John’s elbows. John didn’t seem to mind.
John,” he said. “Since the last residents moved off the island over sixty years ago, the sheep have ostensibly taken over. It is, more or less, an island run by sheep. They have nearly full control of the place. And—might I point out—they have no natural predators on the island.”
The song was the backdrop to John’s smile. The song (four-four time, C major key, synthesizers bopping, disco-era, dull dull dull) ripped through the air as John smiled. The lights—blues and greens and dull reds—shone on as John smiled. Sherlock smiled as John smiled; the two laughed together. Then Sherlock remembered. Then he stopped smiling. His nuisance of a giant genius brain decided to capture the moment as such, with all of the unnecessary sensory details. The lights. The chatter of the crowd. The floral notes of Mary’s perfume (
The man had headphones on and John practically ripped them off his head. “Did you see anybody come out of that building?” he demanded. “Just now? 221b?”
“Do you think you could ever…” Sherlock breathed, his eyes closed and his forehead pressed to John’s, “for me?”
“You’re being unreasonable,” Sherlock said, the patience starting to drain from his voice. “I am perfectly capable of—”
John snaked a hand between their bodies and grabbed at Sherlock’s cock, hard and screaming. He gave Sherlock a stroke and Sherlock’s arms nearly turned to water. Stars danced at the edges of his world. God, he was close.
Sherlock looked down at the rocks beneath his knees. His trousers were drenched and clinging to his skin.
Sherlock looked up as John entered the bedroom. His knees were drawn up to his chest and his back was sunk against what looked to be nearly every pillow on the bed and the strangest thing about the situation was how strange it
Sherlock perched on the mattress just next to John’s feet, peering at John’s ankle. It was certainly swollen, angry and red, the bump of his lateral malleolus completely obscured. There was a bit of bruising that Sherlock could see just starting to form, a dusty blue that would likely become darker as the night progressed. Sherlock frowned. “You’re sure it’s just a sprain?”
“Certainly,” Sherlock said. “Hard to imagine that someone would travel all the way out to a deserted island to put a bullet in the head of a man who was living a law-abiding life. I would imagine that he was drawn back into the criminal element shortly after he got married.” Sherlock tapped at his lips. “Hard to keep a marriage going under those circumstances. Hence, the absence of photographs of his former wife in his sleeping quarters. His solitary existence on this island. Still, someone found him.”
John leaned forward, placing a palm on the mattress just next to Sherlock’s head. “Do you want me to?”
John shifted backwards, a slight movement that pressed himself harder against Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock stilled, his body stiffening against John’s, his breathing coming to a halt. He began to shift backwards, to move himself away from John. John reached behind him and grabbed at Sherlock’s hip, catching him, stopping him. Sherlock allowed it, his body trembling, his breaths coming out in choppy exhales against John’s neck. John pulled Sherlock’s hip forward, pressing their bodies together, grinding Sherlock’s cock against his arse. Sherlock gasped behind him, his hand stuttering on John’s cock. John repeated the movement, urging Sherlock’s hips against his arse and grinding backwards. He could feel Sherlock’s cock through the layers of fabric that separated them, sliding along the cleft of his arse. Sherlock’s body was warm and firm, pressed flush against him, and John could have cried from the sensation alone.
“Toss it,” the man said. He craned his body over the side of the boat. His hand grasped in the air. The other hand inched towards his waistband, towards the gun. His fingers twitched.
He pictured John, lounging back on the sofa, head tucked against the cushions and legs sprawled out before him, eyes on his mobile, waiting for Sherlock to respond. It would be dark in his flat—John didn’t need lights on to see the screen. John would feel safe in the darkness, the disinhibition of being unseen.
This bit of town had seen better days, with the red bricks of the buildings fading into brown with age and the stones on the streets tilting into uneven tripping hazards. There was abandoned scaffolding along a few buildings, and more than a few windows were boarded up, promises of restorations that seemed unlikely to ever occur. There weren’t as many cars or pedestrians in this part of town—for good reason, John supposed—and the place had a still and slightly ominous feel to it. The faint rush of traffic could be heard, as well as the din of someone yelling in a nearby building. Someone had a radio playing, and a crackly voice could be heard crooning out the melody to an old song.
All the moisture in John’s mouth abruptly left him. His heart gave a lurch, stuttering into overdrive on the off-chance that it would be made to stop in the immediate future. He went to make a joke, something silly about people talking, but when he turned his head, Sherlock’s eyes were boring into his, clear and bright and sharp enough to stop traffic.
Sherlock let out a little moan and rolled forward again. This time, he pressed himself against John, his face nearly nestled into John’s armpit. John’s body went stiff. Sherlock Holmes was pressed against him in his sleep. He could feel each of Sherlock’s breaths puff against his chest. He could feel the warmth of Sherlock’s body on his. If he focused hard enough, he could
Darren walked back into the café just before four o’clock. Fitz was at his side; Darren would be taking Fitz back to the mainland with him, as his guard-dog duties would likely be over soon. “Anything?” Darren asked.
“Otherwise,” Sherlock said once the waiter was safely out of earshot, “I’m afraid I’m simply myself. Playing the violin when I think, not talking for hours on end—that sort of thing.” He tapped his thumb against John’s hand. “It’s the
“Your muscles have developed something akin to rigor mortis, your heart rate has increased exponentially, your body temperature is soaring, and you appear to have stopped breathing,” Sherlock said. “Would you like me to continue?”
abandoned you in front of a bank robber’s flat, and taken over the whole of your mind for the past week. You will be goddamned if you let him buy you a drink.
“A win for everyone, really,” he says. “A bank robber is one step closer to being caught, a homeless woman is able to make a touch of money, and I’ve just found myself with a lessened workload until the St. Clair Bank Robber makes plans to strike again.” He glances about the city. “And it’s a lovely day.”
John’s hand flexed against the mattress, an instinctual movement that at the moment seemed to be causing him a bit of discomfort. “Probably stupid,” he said. “Looking back on it. And Lestrade had a thing or two to say to me about it. But. In the moment…” John shrugged.
You mean to correct him, but you realize that what he said is technically and tragically accurate. “No,” you say. “I don’t. Hardly ever, actually.”
“Oh,” Gilly said, “you’ll find that I’m a bit more flexible than your typical serial killer. Do what works, that’s what I say.” She shifted forward on the bed, leaning over Sherlock’s body. She traced along Sherlock’s jaw with the edge of her knife. John twisted in his restraints, but was able to do little besides rattle against the headboard and feel the rope tear at his wrists.
“Good?” Sherlock asked, but it was. It was so good, the best thing Sherlock had ever felt. It was better than all the nicotine patches in the world, it was better than any cocaine he had ever tried, it was even better than solving a case, a locked-door one, at that. John was hot and tight against him, and he could feel every little shudder of his body, every sharp intake of breath ripping through John and into Sherlock. It was nearly too much and Sherlock was dangerously close to coming already.
John pinched at the bridge of his nose. “Sherlock,” he said. “Molly has been nothing but kind to us over the years.
“Divorced,” John said, his mouth full. “Isolated by choice. Some criminal activity in his past. Other than that, not very much.”
“Probably from this,” Sherlock said. He pushed the sleeve of his jacket to his elbow, revealing a gash on his forearm that was leaking blood through his shirt.
“I know, love,” John said, rubbing at her back. “I think that sort of thing might scare some people, though.”
?” Sherlock was at his dresser now, digging through his socks in a manner that John knew meant Sherlock would have to reorganize everything later.
You aren’t one for religion, at least not on a regular basis. You’ve only been to church a handful of times in your life and never saw much of a point. You don’t really practice any sort of faith, never been the sort. The few times you’ve prayed, it’s been out of necessity, a situation so out of your control you needed to believe that it was in someone else’s hands, someone who knew what they were doing. That time Bill’s car hit a patch of ice and did a tailspin directly into oncoming traffic with you unbuckled in the back. When mum was diagnosed and the word
“A couple,” John said, finally finding words. “You and I. We need to convince the killer that we’re a couple.”
Distantly, John heard a noise. The click of a doorknob. A door opening. The rattle of the door knocker as a door was shut with gusto. John’s eyes widened, and it felt as if all the blood in his body dropped to his feet.
“I…” John managed to wedge his head through the correct bit of his jumper and blinked at Mrs. Hudson. Her lips were pursed and her face was stony and she looked like she might find a way to use her dust-rag as some sort of weapon against him. “What do you—”
A white line of panic shot through Sherlock. He pushed himself backwards on his knees, shoving John away from the spray of the falls. John would need to run soon. “Moriarty,” Sherlock said. “He’s here.”
Sherlock texted when he arrived on the mainland. John wasn’t particularly sure why. John didn’t respond. His brain was still a bit dull and soggy from the day before. He needed several moments before he could wrap his mind around interacting with Sherlock in any capacity.
John blinked and shifted his head, the world slowly coming into focus around him. For a disorienting moment, he had no idea where he was. The room was bright—the sun had long since risen—and all John knew was that he was not in his bed. The mattress was much more comfortable than his and the sheets were softer and there was that hand on his shoulder, rubbing softly.
John’s insides managed to feel both hot and cold simultaneously. It was a very confusing set of sensations. “You did?”
“You and Sherlock seem to have a…” she searched for the right word, “connection. It predates the two of us. I know how devastated you were when he had you think he was dead. I can tell how much he means to you. And John—” she waited until John lifted his eyes towards hers, “I can tell how much you mean to him.”
“Our werewolf certainly has business with the organs,” Sherlock said. “However, he seems unclear himself as to what his business specifically is. He is quite intent on figuring it out, though, given how passionately he seems to have gone through the innards of his sheep.” Sherlock glanced about the sheep at the smattering of entrails that were smeared about the grass.
“Ah,” Sherlock said. Another mystery solved, then. He released John’s arm and dug into the pocket of his overcoat. His pocket seemed very deep, and he spun in a little circle as his hand searched for its prize. Finally, he pulled out a little green bottle, holding it up with a flourish. “Ah!”
“We’re not boyfriends,” John snapped, trying desperately to rearrange the flannel, which had slipped away from his cock. “And this isn’t commonplace.”
“Yeah,” John said, pointing to the black masses that lined the shore. “Looks like the beach is covered in rocks. Makes for bad swimming.”
Sherlock’s brow furrowed. “Why are the sheep murdered?” he asked nobody in particular. “What possible benefit could our werewolf get from killing the sheep?”
Gilly was fully on the bed now, kneeling between them with a joyful look on her face. “I’m afraid that not hurting Sherlock,” she said, “runs in direct opposition to my plans.”
“I’ve wanted you all day,” Sherlock whispered. His fingers were still moving slowly, too slowly, but they were twisting now, driving John mad.
“Fuck,” he muttered, and it sounded as if someone else said it. He repeated the word again. And again. And again, until it sounded like his own voice once more.
Still, they didn’t find her right off and stopped for the night just outside of Oulu. Sherlock took a journey around the city to buy information off the local vagrant population while John found them some food and called Molly to beg her for just another few days of childcare. If they didn’t find Mary soon, John wasn’t sure what he would do.
Something covered his mouth. Thick. Pulling at the edges of his skin, a pinching pain. Some sort of tape, then. John exhaled with force and he felt the air rattle against the edges of the tape. He cursed again. The sound was muffled. His heart gave a little stutter.
been out here; the bushes just next to him were disturbed and there was a puddle of something—sick, John saw—just to the side. John wrinkled his nose, but figured this sort of thing was to be expected at a wedding with a free bar.
Reality slid back in around him, the weight of everything he felt, everything he had done sitting on his back with a bone-crushing strength. Sherlock was aware that he was, once again, lying in his bed alone. John was elsewhere, in his flat that he shared with Mary and Rosie, very likely dropping off to sleep. Sherlock unwound his fingers from his cock, wiping them on the sheets. He gasped and it sounded suspiciously like a sob.
Gilly extended her gun arm, the muzzle all that much closer to John. “Don’t even think about doing anything stupid, poppet.”
John pointed at a man standing at the end of the street. It was the red-faced man from the image in Sherlock’s head. His face was still red. His arms were crossed over his chest.
“You did,” Sherlock said. “You did die. You weren’t breathing. You were gone. I…” He tipped his head forward again. John could feel a tear, big and warm, land on his cheek. “I’m not worth that, John. I’m not worth you dying.” Another gust of wind came in off the water, ruffling at the frizz of Sherlock’s hair, turning the air cold. John barely felt the chill.
“This is unconvincing,” Sherlock said after some time. “We look as if we are anxiously sitting around, waiting to be murdered.”
, John,” he said. “I’m not a lark. I’m not a place you can flit to and from for your own amusement. That’s not how I work.”
“All in all,” Sherlock said, sitting shirtless on the toilet lid as John knelt before him, taking stock of the injuries he sustained and working out how best to go about fixing him up, “that could have gone much worse.”
Sherlock ripped up a floorboard. The beam of wood gave way with a cracking noise and a puff of dust. Beneath, there was only the blank space between floor and ceiling, bits of insulation peppered throughout. “It would appear so,” Sherlock said.
“Um,” John remembered his offer to prove himself to Sherlock in front of the fire and suddenly found his face growing warm.
Sherlock let out a grunt that made it seem as if he would have preferred the guests be wrongly convicted of murder. “Regardless,” he said, “his murderer was not a stranger to him. He saw no cause for alarm until there was a bullet in his brain.” He slid open one of Declan’s dresser drawers with a finger and started rummaging through his clothes.
“Exactly,” Sherlock said. With that, he spun and took off up the hill, in the direction of the path that led to the far side of the island.
“If it had been the other way around,” John said. “If you were the one in danger, if I was on the roof, I would have done the same. If that was the choice—be dead or watch you die in front of me—I would have jumped too.” He rubbed his hand across Sherlock’s back, feeling the braille of the scars that lined his skin. “You’re a bit too wonderful not to be in this world.”
“I doubt you’ll ever get that desperate,” Sherlock said, his face a sneer. He turned to walk away, but John grabbed his arm.
in every sense of the word, as if he and Sherlock were slipping into a singular unit right there in his crime scene of a bedroom. John heard himself make a little noise and Sherlock’s breathing grew unsteady against him and—god—the two of them could have stayed like that forever.
Sherlock ran his fingers around the ridges of John’s eye sockets, down the swell and dips of his cheeks, along his jaw. His eyes were on John’s, and they were lovelier than the whole of the night sky. “Of course I do,” Sherlock said. “Always, John. I’ve loved you, always.”
“Because,” Sherlock said. “You chose her.” His face flickered for just one moment, the barest glimmer of emotion shining through before he closed up again. “She makes you happy,” he said. “She’s what you want. I am to see to it that you have what you want, what makes you happy.” His eyes lifted from his mobile, and it seemed as if Sherlock allowed himself to be back with John, his face open and warm. “I want you to be happy. Always.”
John studied her hair. He wasn’t sure he could tell the difference. “It looks nice.” He narrowed his eyes at her. “Is this what that was all about? That I didn’t notice your hair?”
. A framed photograph of a girl, about five years old, if John had to guess. John lifted the frame, examining the picture.
Another string of profanity from Sherlock. “There’s no telling which harbor he’s heading back to,” Sherlock said. “For all we know, he has some private hideout where he docks his boat. God
“Christ,” John whispered. He could feel something funny start up in his chest. The thought of whatever had been done to Sherlock to cause those angry white stripes along his back made his stomach turn. “Were they going to kill you?” he asked. His voice was quiet against the pelting rain.
Sherlock after all; danger followed him like a dog after scraps. Still, Sherlock’s relationship with danger seemed to be one of affection, even nonchalance at times. It had never once occurred to John that the danger posed during Sherlock’s time away might have been different from the levels of danger with which Sherlock usually surrounded himself. And it certainly never occurred to him that Sherlock might have been scared. He remembered the scars he saw on Sherlock’s back the other morning—angry, infected—and considered, for the first time, that Sherlock might have had a valid reason to be afraid.
“Pretending to be something I thought we’d never be,” Sherlock said. “Knowing that every time I was near to you, every time I touched you, every time I kissed you, it could be the last and I was never to have another opportunity. It was killing me, John.”
Data. He would collect data. He did that sort of thing, he knew. From time to time. The first step seemed to be to find his limbs, one by one. He had a go at wiggling his fingers. His fingers seemed to mostly comply, which Sherlock considered to be a success. Proprioception was returning, which seemed like good news. There was a difference in temperature between the fingers of one hand and the fingers of another. A difference in pressure, as well. That led Sherlock to believe that his hands were in different places.
“Well,” John said, eyes still on the mattress. “As it turned out, he sustained a number of serious blows to the head. Broke his nose. Lost some teeth. Likely in need of stitches in a few places. Hospital seemed like a good first stop before the station.”
The dull roar of the journalists outside the flat could be heard through the windows. There were occasional strobes of camera flashes that flickered through the room, and their shouted commands were a wordless din that sounded more like the rush of traffic than humans attempting to speak. It was oddly nicer, John thought, to have a wall between himself and the media frenzy for once.
Sherlock spent the holidays with his family. His parents, Sherlock complained, seemed insistent on more frequent family get-togethers, spurred on by the time Sherlock spent allegedly deceased.
Conor pointed at the new skipper as he and Fitz climbed onto the boat. “Brennan is the one with the dolphin,” he said. “You know—the one we told you two about when you got here?”
Sherlock followed, walking just a step behind him. “Holding hands is a useful heuristic for onlookers to determine that we are in a relationship,” he said, but his voice was quiet.
, but John was focused on the lump that seemed to be forming in his throat. Because John, of course, had no intention of changing any of it.
He could practically hear Sherlock’s lips twitch into a little half-smile next to him. “Always nice to hear, John,” Sherlock said.
“Yes you do,” John said. “You have to answer, because you know the answer. So I’ll ask again, genius.” John’s lips brushed against Sherlock’s. “What do you want?”
Sherlock ignored her hand so John shook it instead. “John Watson,” he said. He nodded to Sherlock. “And that one’s Sherlock.”
, John!” Sherlock was nearly at the top of the hill and was showing no intentions of slowing down to wait for him.
“It’s a lovely fireplace,” Hugh said. “Heats the whole cottage up nice and warm. You two’ll have to light a fire before you leave.”
Anyway, that was the rationale he gave for why he collapsed into Sherlock’s bed and not his own. Sherlock’s was closer. John didn’t even take his shoes off. He was asleep almost immediately.
This chapter is the end of the canon-compliant portion of the fic. It is not, however, the end of the angst.
You bury your face in the arm you’ve got braced against the wall, but not before the most ridiculous moan escapes your mouth. It’s too much and it’s so good and your body is already spent and sensitive, sparking and popping at random. His cock wasn’t a monster but it feels monstrous inside, too big and too hard and so slick—slick from your come.
“Jesus Christ,” John said, hoisting his bag over his shoulder and sprinting down the stairs. Sherlock was already in the driver’s seat of their car—a compact sedan that barely contained enough room for the two of them and their bags—when John exited the flat.
John watched Sherlock for a moment longer before looking away and closing his eyes as well. The storm still showed no signs of dissipating, but John could feel exhaustion starting to win the battle over the wiry anxiety in his body. He let out another series of long, slow breaths. Sherlock was warm next to him.
Will hoisted the handles of the wheelbarrow up and started back down the field. “Don’t think you and your friend have anything to worry about,” he said. “Most folks, they don’t even know the Island exists. They certainly don’t want to spend any more time out here than they need to. Whatever sort of lot Declan got himself mixed up in, I doubt they’ll be back.”
“Breathe,” Sherlock said. “All you are responsible for in the moment is breathing.” As if to demonstrate, Sherlock took in a breath, deep and slow. He exhaled slowly, purposefully. John did his best to match Sherlock’s breathing, although his exhales were by no means as steady. As if by some miracle, he could feel his body start to unravel, his heart slow. He would have hated this typically, Sherlock seeing him in such a near-panicked state, but at the moment he was a bit too tired to care.
With the hill towering behind John, he had nowhere to move. He glared up at Sherlock. “A hell of a lot more than you,” he said. “I’m not the one who faked his death, remember? I’m not the one who planted a bloodied corpse on the pavement for his friend to see. So don’t stand here and act like you’re the patron saint of honesty, you dick. We both know it’s a goddamn lie.”
Later that night, you have a wank to the thought of him pushing inside you bare, nothing but skin on skin. You come so hard your leg cramps.
Sherlock’s head tilted back towards the sky. “Keeping a lookout,” he said. “It is likely that the werewolf will make another attempt to kill a sheep tonight. I’d like to prevent that from happening, if at all possible.”
“So you think they killed him?” John asked. “You think they found him out here? Got the flash drive? Got their revenge?”
Sherlock brushed his lips against John’s, the cruelest tease of a kiss. “Because,” he said, “there is a tour coming in ten minutes.”
“It was because you were up front,” Conor said. “It’s bumpier up front, with the waves. It gets you sick if you’re not used to it. Best to stay in the back.”
Sherlock sat down to eat with John and Rosie with minimal complaint. The sun dipped below the buildings as they ate, the flat slowly dimming into evening light, punctuated by flashes of headlights as they passed by the window. Downstairs, Mrs. Hudson switched off the telly and started baking something that smelled of cinnamon. Sherlock finished the whole of his plate as he busily explained to John exactly why and how wrong he was about his understanding of the Monty Hall problem. Rosie finished the whole of her plate as she listened to Sherlock’s explanations with rapt attention. John finished the whole of his plate because the curry actually turned out quite good, even though it could have stood for more salt.
on the call. He pocketed the mobile, looking at his mate as he wavered on the back of the boat. He nodded towards the gun. “You think you can still aim that thing?”
Sherlock chuckled, catching the box in his free hand and sitting back on his heels, keeping his fingers inside John. John whimpered at the sudden lack of contact, moving himself against Sherlock’s hand in a way that seemed just outside of his control. He looked up at Sherlock through barely-open eyes. Sherlock looked like a glorious mess. A flush had crept over his face and chest, and his hair was a knotted wreck from the bath. His plump lips were swollen and pink and he had the mark of more than a few love-bites on his neck. At the moment, however, Sherlock’s gaze was focused entirely on his fingers disappearing inside of John. His mouth had dropped slightly open and he appeared transfixed, seconds away from pouncing. He looked magnificent, debauched and wrecked, and if John didn’t feel more of him—all of him—immediately he might explode from it.
The mobile fell silent again. John thought he could hear Sherlock exhale, a wobbly thing. The man’s voice boomed through the cave as he spoke, his sharp words coming back to him in an echo. Sherlock would be able to tell they were in the little cave, surely, but he wouldn’t be able to get to them. Not without a swim, and the waters were dangerous. The currents are too strong, Claire had said. They’ll sweep you right away. Stay out of the water. The both of them were at the mercy of the Taibhses, and Sherlock knew it.
“You must think me an absolute imbecile,” Sherlock said. “And one would think we’ve been acquainted long enough for you to know that isn’t the case.”
“Exactly how many of our wedding guests have you personally threatened now?” John asked, pulling out a chair to take a seat at the table inexplicably cluttered with even more wedding-related papers.
“Ah,” John said. A moment of silence fell between the two of them, seeming to scream words that John couldn’t quite hear.
“We did,” John said, his eyes on Sherlock’s wrist. “Well. Scotland Yard did. You were flopping about in an alley. And I was tending to you. But trust me.” He released Sherlock’s wrist, apparently satisfied with whatever his pulse was or wasn’t doing. “He’s in custody.” John kept his hand on Sherlock’s forehead, rubbing slowly. Something about the pressure of John’s hand was nice, in a way. It didn’t exactly keep the room from spinning, but it made the whole ordeal a bit more bearable.
“I want you never to think straight again,” Sherlock said. “I want to be the only thing on your mind. The center of it all.” His hand gripped at John’s arse, the very tip of his finger just breaching the tight ring of his hole. He ground John against him in rough, stuttering thrusts.
Sherlock whipped around, taking a step towards John and crowding into his space. “Tell me then,” Sherlock snapped. “If you
He looks up, those deep-sea eyes shimmering with mischief, and you can’t do anything but gape down at him, trying to catch your breath. He works your cock out of your trousers without looking, eyes still on you. He licks a line up your shaft and drags his mouth along your skin, teasing, and you barely have time to contemplate how goddamn sexy he looks with your cock against his lips before he swallows the whole of you down and Christ—okay,
joy.” She ran the blade down Sherlock’s neck, tracing along the skin just over his jugular. She glanced at John. “I expect, poppet, that watching your Sherlock bleed out in front of you will make you particularly devastated. And that will give me
Everything was bloody pink. The walls were pink. The dresser drawers were pink. The lining on the changing table was pink. The mobile that hung above the cot was pink. Even the stuffed animals that lined the cot were pink, staring back at John with dead eyes and pink grins.
Sherlock muttered about sheep for the remainder of the evening and John tried his hand at putting together another edible meal from the motley assortment of food they had in the kitchen. He ended up with another rice-and-beans-and-veg dish, with a slightly different but functionally identical sauce. It was mediocre at best. Sherlock poked at it absently and John couldn’t fault him for his lack of interest.
Sherlock studied him with interest. “We need to attend to the dog, John,” he said. His lips were barely hiding a smile.
fault. He would insist that the whole thing was his fault, not Sherlock’s. It wouldn’t be much of a stretch, because the whole thing
“Will must have gotten it out of him,” Sherlock was saying, his hands at his lips. “There at the end. He must have worked it out of Declan somehow. Threatened to go after his family, maybe. He had their address. He could have.”
He reached the pavement on the other side of the street, the whining horns of the traffic not even registering in his ears. He craned his neck back, looking at the building. The buildings across t from 221b were tall and prim, white-painted brick standing out against the streets, and abandoned. Nobody, so far as John knew, lived in the flats above. No businesses ever made their homes in the shops at the street level. There was no way to get inside, no flight of stairs to get onto the roof.
The woman wasn’t far from the café, sprawled next to some ruins with her leg sticking out in front of her. She seemed more embarrassed than hurt, but still winced as she tried to shift her ankle.
, just to step one meter to the left or right. He hated that the man was standing on the spot where Sherlock died, and he did not find himself particularly keen on miracles at the moment.
There had been a bit more yelling after that, and a few more of the bullets had been thrown. John tried not to think about it. Most of it made little sense. Still, it was fairly common of Sherlock’s temperament these days, and John did his best to breathe through it. It was Sherlock, after all. Nasty moods came with the territory. Besides, John couldn’t speak very highly of his own mood since moving back in, and having to wait a full year in order to begin steps to divorce a woman he no longer loved certainly didn’t help.
