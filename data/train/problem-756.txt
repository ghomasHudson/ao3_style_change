“The point,” said John, “is that it’s sort of a bonding ritual for the people who enjoy that sort of thing.” He really wasn’t explaining it well, but then he’d never been particularly fond of strip clubs. “Women get to cut loose and admit that they have dirty thoughts and egg each other on. If it’s a traditional strip show, then the lads get to do some heterosexual posturing in front of each other — pretending they see dozens of tits every day of the week and twice on Sundays.”
—” Sherlock clapped a paw over John’s mouth.
“It’s just that not many do,” said Sherlock. “None, actually.” He looked at John’s half-buttered toast. “Carry on then. I’ll likely be in my room for the rest of the day. I have some papers to look over.”
And those were the pictures his mind was painting when he came silently, catching his ejaculate with the hem of his undershirt.
Sherlock looked at John with that intent and uncanny gaze of his.
“Partially, I suppose.” John thought for a moment. “If I could really be there right now, I’d want to make the most of it. I’d want to… use every minute to make you feel good… so you’d want to do it with me again sometime.”
“You think it was a crime of passion?”
Sherlock stood. “Just walk to the end of the street. It won’t take long to find it. When you come back, say my name, and the fog should appear.”
John could break the curse or Moriarty could let Sherlock finally die once he’d “burned the heart out of him.”
It had come as something of a shock to discover that masculine laughter could also be quite effective when it was uttered, soft and low, in his ear. The rough sting of a stubbled kiss and the taste of cock had joined the list immediately on the heels of that revelation.
“Is that why you never took it?”
The base of his skull felt hot and he could almost see the brightness of the rage lurking there, singing to him. Seducing him.
“As it should be,” John said, and before Sherlock could contest that, he added, “So why am I here? I take it’s not just to balance out the number of compliments between us.”
“Do you have orders, sir?” she asked.
"No more, Eric, please!"
He just called me Mr. Uptown Cheekbones
"Well, that's the bisexuality sorted," John murmured and, once again remembering the scotch, downed it quickly. "At least Harry'll be pleased." A huffed laugh, a joyless laugh.
"Oh, Aunt Jackie could be late to her own funeral," he joked. "Rosie will have her here soon, though. You won't believe how much she's grown up. Soon, it'll be impossible to distinguish which one of them is the actual adult." Harry nodded, but didn't look comfortable, so John took a leap. He pulled her in gently with an arm around her back, rubbed a hand against her far arm. He flashed back to when they were smaller, waiting on the steps in front of the school for their father to remember that he had to go get them. It had practically been a daily occurrence. One time, they waited so long, the principal had offered to take them home. Their father had been furious that they had taken him up on it, despite the fact that they had been waiting over six hours without food.
Not expecting or ready for the opening to talk about her male double so quickly, Joan blinked before formulating a good response. “If he’s anything like me, he changes it to humor you because if you’re anything like Sherlock, you like showing off your superiority to the rest of us mere mortals. That’s why I left the password on mine.” Joan noted his eyes lighting up before continuing. “Anyway, I would’ve lent you Sherlock’s, but he hid his somewhere, and I can never find something if he wants it hidden.” Not entirely true, but not a bold-faced lie, either. Perfect for feigning near-stupidity to a super genius. “How’re you feeling?”
“It’s really not.” And Sherlock stopped. John was right; it really wasn’t, but everything about this man was captivating, even the most basic characteristics. Not that he could come out and say that, though.
“I’m frankly surprised you remember that,” Sherlock murmured, typing one last “fuck off” for good measure before returning his full attention to the man sitting in front of him.
“A few of the finer points might have slipped through, but you’re asking me to be your flatmate, right?”
Big Brolly Brother took out a notebook from his inside pocket, and began speaking as he leafed through it. “If you do choose to resume your acquaintance with Mr. Holmes, I’d be happy to pay you a meaningful sum of money to ease your way.”
Sherlock and Lestrade's side of the Tube
Sherlock arrived at the end of his speech, and sat expectantly looking to John, who looked rather like he’d been bludgeoned with a cricket bat. Seven seconds passed (Sherlock counted) before John burst out laughing.
The memory had the opposite effect on John, though. Seized with impatience and unable to express it without upsetting Harry, he returned his gaze to the crowd, eyes darting from face to face, looking for little blondes and listening for loud female voices. In time, though, his eyes slowed and caught on the blue wooden box that sat against a far wall. It looked not unlike a telephone booth, except made entirely of wood, no windows. John thought he saw the word "police" on it, too. He frowned slightly, wondering why it was there; it hadn't been there when he'd left last week.
My God this is boring
“Not yet,” Other Sherlock said. “You’ll only aggravate your injuries, which will only slow you down in the long run. Watson - that is, Joan - and I can get a head start on Moriarty while you heal. We’ll bring everything to you we get, or we’ll send one of our colleagues to. Once you are out of the hospital, we can continue to help you as needed until you leave to go back to your own universe.”
"Hello, Rose. You've grown up, haven't you?" Rose turned to her younger cousin, and John saw the moment when she decided the only good response for that was a hug.
Well, yeah. Can’t have you meeting someone better, can I?
“Not my fault,” he replied languidly. This time she really did throw her hands into the air before she snatched the cup from him and went to fetch him more water.
“You want some help?” Just as suddenly as Sherlock whipped into motion, he halted abruptly.
“But I would prefer for various reasons that my concern go unmentioned. We have what you might call a difficult relationship.”
Can we plz focus on ur poor, suffering friend languishing in the dimly lit, nearly abandoned, and broken-down Tube?
“You play the violin?” the other Sherlock asked. Sherlock hesitated - and damn it, other Sherlock saw it - and nodded. “I do, too… But you’re not surprised by that, are you?” he added. “Who are you and how do you know so much about me?”
“Why?” Other Sherlock asked.
“An enemy.”
Mycroft sighed, letting his eyes close for a moment - he hadn’t slept all week since his brother’s fall, and unlike Sherlock, he did occasionally need to sleep - and dropped his hand to his side. “For your sake,” he murmured. “I will hope there is one. With that, Mycroft snapped back to business and sat back behind his desk. Anthea stepped into the room, eyes glued to her Blackberry as usual.
Sherlock swore and strode across the room to send his brother a very profane text. “Bloody Mycroft,” he mumbled, and John looked at him slantwise.
Sherlock determinedly did
“So this is where a Sherlock lives,” an unexpected voice said in the suddenly not-empty room, and Sherlock bolted upright. He swung around, wide-eyed as the noise in his head shut down to a single note.
Joan added silently.) “We figured that would be enough to keep you entertained for a while. Sherlock’s gone to bully some prison wardens into figuring out the details behind Moriarty’s escape from her imprisonment.” Sherlock nodded and reached for the laptop.
Hey, are you coming home soon?
“Believe me, my dear, the pleasure was all mine,” Sherlock purred, gratified when Marissa blushed.
John blinked. Then, because the man was still standing in front of him, he blinked again. When he was still there, he decided he was not, in fact, dreaming a particularly vivid fever dream or hallucinating from some drug someone had slipped him without his notice. “That was…amazing,” he managed finally.
“I know.”
Not possible, Gregory.
“Did you have difficulty understanding me?” Sherlock asked, suddenly anxious.
SISTER!!! There’s always something
“That bastard in there has less manners than you,” Watson said with calm venom (the kind that usually told Sherlock he’d gone too far and would be making and ordering his own meals for the next week or so). “If I didn’t know better, I’d say he deduced us, each of us.”
Actually, though, hes kinda ur type, Molls. Tall, dark, and faintly mysterious
And the proof? John wouldn't dare look Sherlock in the eye again without irrefutable evidence he could be away from him if circumstances forced his hand. Only a fool would believe he could hide a secret from Sherlock Holmes, and only a fool would stick around Sherlock Holmes once he knew you loved him. Wasn't Molly evidence enough? Wasn't Irene Adler? So no, John Watson was no fool. He would be prepared for the day Sherlock turned his love against him, for when he needed to leave again. Besides, ten days was plenty time to bury those pesky emotions under as many levels as possible. He may have to face the day when Sherlock uncovered his heart, but he'd be damned if it would be any day soon.
, for God’s sake? – or, when the man opened his coat to pull out his phone, at the glimpse of deep, thirsty purple shirt torturing the line of buttons leading down from his delicious-looking collarbone. (He briefly contemplated alleviating those poor buttons’ suffering before he could rein in his libido, but the thought still dried out his mouth and made his heart pound dizzily in his chest.) “Damn,” the obliviously ogled man sighed with relief. “My phone appears to only have the one camera. And without a mirror in sight!”
“I never guess,” Sherlock replied loftily. “I simply narrowed it down to the most likely candidates, seeing as I never heard your actual first name.”
“A rumor went around when I was fifteen, and people really need nothing more than a rumor to hate.” Finally, a cab noticed the two and Sherlock clambered in, Joan following. She put the tips of her fingers to his wrist in a silent but familiar extension of comfort and thanks for the offering before changing the subject.
“No,” Sherlock said slowly. “Although before I explain why I did invite you here, I must warn you ahead of time that I am not, nor have I ever been, a ‘people person’. I mean no offense nor harm to you, and I ask you to allow me to explain myself fully instead of jump to conclusions prematurely.”
“Where is he?” Other Sherlock asked.
He didn't know, but he would, when Harry called. When, with tears in her voice and desperation in her heart, she would beg him to come to the funeral.
“A little,” she admitted. “Brought up stuff from the past I wasn’t crazy about thinking about, and warped a couple of things from the present to try to sound insulting. If he hadn’t pressed on all of the nurses’ dirty little secrets before setting into me, he might not have gotten to me as much, but as is… You didn’t happen to teach anyone else how to deduce, did you?”
I know it's been a long wait, and not a lot has happened so far, but we're almost done with the awkward exposition-y bits. I'm also taking requests for misadventures for the two Sherlocks to get into while in New York. I have ideas, but filler fluffs would be very helpful. Leave suggestions in the comments as long as you don't get uber-offended if I don't get around to using your idea.
He wondered where John was now, at that very moment. He hadn’t been gone two minutes, so was he talking with Mycroft, trying to pry details about this mission out of him? Was he sitting back with Mary, watching the sky, waiting for him to find a way out, like he did on the roof of St. Bart’s? Or maybe he was already in the car, heading back home with her, ready to start trying to live without him. Sherlock shook his head at the thought. If his last absence and Mary were proof of anything, it was that John could, in fact, have a life without him. It was Sherlock who could not live without him.
“John.” He blinked a few times before making sense of the mass of questions and observations pouring through his skull. “You didn’t walk, did you?”
message unsent
Hugging his Aunt Jackie, he scanned over his shoulder, looking for the Doctor or the prat he was with, but they were both gone. He wondered if he was going crazy, seeing men no one else sees, and thinking a poor kid like him could ever be a doctor. For a chance to meet the Doctor again, though - to see those eyes again, to feel that kinship again, and perchance to get some goddamn answers - he figured it was worth a shot. And hell, maybe it was worth being a little bit crazy.
What??? – GL
He blinked slowly once then again more rapidly. “Did you get the water?” Joan blinked.
Okay, that’s enough about the poor bloke. Jesus, Sherlock! – GL
That were, if it weren’t for the drinking, the divorce, and the distinct lack of interest in paying rent.
“No relationship,” he corrected. “I am as always married to my work, and, as I have heard altogether too often, John is ‘not gay’.” He put air quotes around the end and glanced at Other Watson. “That excuse wouldn’t pan out too well for you, I’d think.” Now Other Watson really began to choke.
“Really?”
- Mr. Uptown Cheekbones
Don’t you have that mind thing you can go to? – GL
“I’m surprised you didn’t set my name as Mr. Uptown Cheekbones,” the man snarked quietly, and John nearly dropped his phone in his haste to whip around and face him.
“And did she call herself,” Sherlock asked, leaning forward, “
, John]
I’m a bit surprised you can’t tell me to the second – GL
An army doctor, huh? Sherlock didn’t mention that part.
It was what John would have done. That was why she unnerved him, he thought, watching the mob of nurses approach his door and try to push past her, watching her stand up to them.
“What does that even mean?” Sherlock whinged, and John just smiled blithely and sat again, gesturing to the seat across from him.
“Except you’re not interested in ‘everybody’, are you, brother mine?” Mycroft said. “You want to come home to the good doctor, have a good laugh over Moriarty’s stupidity, and start solving London’s various crimes again.”
That’s not any better – GL
“Take care, Sherlock Holmes.”
, Sherlock]
“No.”
what – Mike
Your idiocy has exceeded previous expectations, Lestrade. Not only do you seem to believe I want ANYTHING to do with a random stranger on the Tube whose obsession with me seems far less than what any sane individual would consider “charming” or any such attractive quality, but your grammar skills have dissolved to the levels of preadolescent children
Don’t you have an actual job to do anyway?
Yay! New chapter! And it's early! Hooray! I will be gone at Disney World on Sunday without Internet access or the slightest desire to write or post anything anyway. So here's your chapter. Enjoy it. Savor it. You won't get any more until next week. I know it's short, but consider it a result of mounting tensions before the big event, which should be next week, if all goes well.
“Is that relevant?” Sherlock snapped.
It was a well-established fact that Sherlock Holmes handled emotion about as well as Sherlock Holmes handled any other pesky intrusion that interfered with The Work, so Lestrade made it a point not to sigh or throw a fit when the detective began rattling off his deductions in lieu of responding to the previous statement. He did have a job to do, after all, and forcing Sherlock to do anything never resulted with happy endings for anyone. He pointed out the irrationality of Sherlock’s behavior, and if there was anything Sherlock hated more than boredom, it was irrationality. John wasn’t getting deleted anytime soon, Lestrade was positive.
So, apparently, Sherlock gave Remus and Romulus away to a petting zoo soon after he tamed them. I forgot that before starting, so oh well. I guess I don't comply with canon as much as I thought. *shrugs*
“Yet not instrumental enough to keep from leaping off the side of St. Bart’s,” she countered, keying in one last line of code before turning her full feline attention back to Sherlock, “and running off to go take down the rest of my husband’s empire without him.”
He spent a few minutes using the comparison to distract his increasingly fevered, sluggish mind from the morphine before he heard a distant shout. The noise died down, and then the mob dispersed. He wondered at it for a moment before realizing that the John-like woman was gone from his doorway. He had a chance to escape!
, Mycroft]
“My husband did have a success today!” she exclaimed. “Even if he is dead, he should be truly proud of all he accomplished.” She stopped pulling on her blouse and considered Sherlock for a long moment before continuing on. “I’m sure the other Holmes sent you here to reap his revenge on my husband’s network. Jim never was too good about concealing his more ambitious operations.” Fully clothed again, Jamie picked up the gun but, instead of levelling it at him, kept it loosely at her side. She knew she had his interest. “You’re wondering what his interest in this place and this man was.”
In any case, I’ll have to push my estimate back at least half an hour
You’ve got to stop offering that deal to everyone he comes into contact with
221B Baker Street.
John knew he wasn’t doing her any favors by staying with her, paying her rent and helping her whenever she was too drunk or hungover to do it herself, but he just didn’t have enough money to get a flat by himself, and he was extremely wary of trying to get a flatmate. Ever since things had fallen through with Sarah, she and Molly had become thick as thieves, which meant both were out of the picture. Mike was moving in with his girlfriend of a year in only a few weeks when she moved back to London, and Bill knew that John moving into another flat would mean that he wouldn’t get to see Harry anymore, so neither would be of any help. And that was the grand sum of his friends he’d kept since he’d been deployed and sent back to London.
“Perhaps,” he allowed, smiling slightly. “Although I shan’t take it back. I believe that after last night, the balance of compliments is skewed rather heavily towards your end.”
Perfect.
“I’m on a case, I really shouldn’t have spent this much time with you, I need to go find a suitcase before the rubbish is picked up.”
“Yes, I did, half an hour ago,” Sherlock replied, and Joan nearly threw her hands in the air and gave up on the whole affair. Instead, she took a calming breath, placed the supplies on the side table carefully, and glared at the choleric man.
“Perhaps,” the older man conceded whilst sounding as if he was not conceding at all. “But perhaps you are merely delaying the inevitable. You are not a fool, Sherlock. You know as well as I that John will be livid when he discovers your deception. Besides, when dealing with John and other matters of the heart, you can be very childish.” Mycroft rose a hand to deflect his brother’s outrage. “I only mean that you do not want to know what John would decide after being angry with you. You would rather believe that you have a loyal best friend awaiting you than a man who has decided he would rather live without you.”
“So what if I do?” Sherlock demanded. “Believe it or not, Mycroft, I led a perfectly suitable and fulfilling life before my faked suicide last week. I had my work, a comfortable place to live, and a friend. Even you agreed that John made me … better. Why are you so determined to find fault now?”
John resisted to urge to take her hand at the thought that they might never truly succeed. But he didn't manage to fight off the need to look at her again out of the corner of his eye. She was pressed as close to his side as she could without touching him, trembling, and John knew the cold couldn't account for the full force of it. She'd always been on the shorter side, they both did, but John didn't think he could remember her ever looking smaller. He could feel his mind fighting to process the entirety of the past week, but he kept a tight leash on it.
I forgot to turn off the shutter sound
“Good morning, m’lady,” he greeted her, pressing a soft kiss to her neck.
“Geoff, of course.”
Show us - Molly
Stop reading his texts, Sherlock! – GL
I think I can manage, Mycroft Holmes
Idly scanning the crowd, John couldn't help but return to the reason he was most glad he'd gone home, good-byes and closure aside. He hadn't seen Harry since before The Slap, and he had been eager to lay eyes on her again. He wasn't particularly surprised that it took awhile - Harry had always been particularly good at being anywhere else when the bad things took over the Watson household. Besides that, he figured she was going to be angry that he had left without saying good-bye, or that he had refused to go to their mother's funeral. It didn't even occur to him to be worried.
What? – Sarah
“You’re not distracting me at all,” John added casually, trying not to let his surprise and, oddly enough, pleasure shine through. He takes his time putting up his phone, hoping he looks like he’s snubbing the smart arse rather than trying not to grin like an idiot over a text from a stranger.
Ya pics or it didnt happen – Bill
Fuck u, Im definitely Mulder
than her own. He seemed more of a character out of a comic book. Hers had eccentricities, of course, but he was, at the end of the day, a man. This Sherlock seemed as though he wanted to be a god, or thought he already was.
this bloke was – he positively towered over John – and he silently fumed, knowing that the man would still be too tall, even if he stood. In the second before the man came to a halt in front of him, John reminded himself sternly not to flirt or stare overmuch. Even if this flawless statue of a man was used to as much ogling as John suspected, he doubted it would be appreciated in this context.
“Be warned, Dr. Watson,” the man (who John, deciding he liked giving these weirdos appropriate nicknames, began mentally calling Big Brolly Brother) threatened. “I am not a man one should trifle with.”
That is, if the whole thing wasn't a fever dream. He still wasn't quite sure.
“Looking for you, you think?” Other Watson asked.
“Of course it was the shock!” he asserted indignantly, and she smiled indulgently at him but let it go.
oooo SURNAMES – Bill
And maybe - if he was lucky - to try out Round Two.
My Mind Palace? I never access it in public. Draws too much attention and leaves me too vulnerable to attack
The obvious murder-suicide of the lesbian and her married girlfriend? I solved that one at the crime scene, weren’t you paying attention?
Safely in the car, John allowed himself to laugh. Whether bloody Big Brolly Brother was involved with this Sherlock Holmes bloke or not, there was no doubt in John’s mind that he wasn’t escaping from this particular world anytime soon. He wondered whether he was going insane when he was more pleased at the thought than terrified.
“That would be correct. There is a room upstairs, although I suppose I could move out of my room on this floor, should the extra stairs be of trouble.” A flash of intrigue shone in the shorter man’s eyes, and infuriating hope bubbled up in his stomach.
I just met Sherlock’s “friend” from the Tube.
it whispered treacherously.
The man was silent for a long moment, staring him down, before, “Yes.”
look at the ground as his plane took off. He’d made all of the necessary deductions on land, and the last thing he would ever do was second guess himself. He’d already made that mistake once, just before his departure to dismantle Moriarty’s web, and he’d received nothing but heartache, listening to John’s anger and grief and love. All of that love, right there for the taking, and he had been too damn scared to take it.
I paid attention! All I heard was you going on about the angle of the gun and something about violets. I didn’t know you’d solved the bloody case. – GL
i’ll try not to take that personally ;) - Bill
“Okay.”
It shouldn’t have taken you that long to type that out
Piss off, Mike.
who else is in th car w/ u? – Bill
, John thought. His phone buzzed again, and he pulled it out to find another text from Sherlock.
As always, kudos, subscriptions, bookmarks, and comments make this girl insanely happy, but just a higher hit count puts a smile on my face, so sit back and enjoy!
“I never guess,” he snapped in reply, then, slowly, considering, softened. “Sherlock.”
He’s headed to Baker Street as we speak
“Track runner,” Sherlock murmured, angrily pulling at the IV attaching the morphine to his body. “There’s always something.”
Next up, this was all supposed to be Chapter 1, but I felt like cutting it off where I did because it felt right. So if this feels like it was written in conjunction with the first chapter, you're right.
“I haven’t mentioned a figure,” Big Brolly Brother smirked.
Not reassuring, Sherlock – GL
John deposited Sherlock on the bed (not as gently as he wanted to, since he wasn’t twenty anymore, but if Sherlock’s gasp was anything to judge by, he didn’t seem to mind) and stood. “I think we could do with less clothes,” he commented, reaching for the buttons of his shirt.
“Did you really talk to me when I wasn’t here to hear you?” she asked, handing him the cup.
“What’re they usually for?”
Sherlock stepped sideways with a lurch, his feet hitting the linoleum with sharp percussion, like someone hitting wooden blocks together. John saw a… hand? It reached out and set a Manila folder on the table with remarkable dexterity considering that it more closely resembled the paw of a great cat or a bear than something human. Dark, reddish-brown hair curled down the back of it, covering his short fingers to the second knuckle (There appeared to be no third knuckle.). The fingertips ended in black, crescent-shaped claws.
“You’ve participated in this ‘bonding ritual?’”
“I know I set an alarm.” He yanked off his pyjama bottoms and hauled his jeans up over his hips.
“I see. Or rather, I won’t see, I guess.”
Harry took a long nap in the middle of the day, which she needed, but which left her restless that night, so they watched
“Well, it seems that kissing still feels good to you.” John pressed his lips to Sherlock’s — licking along his lower lip, requesting entrance, and once that was granted, kissing Sherlock senseless.
Harry mostly slept.
“Suppose it was.”
John pulled the other pillow over his face.
“I believe I mentioned licking and sucking these next.”
John wasn’t normally fazed by the dark. He’d rambled London for months now — often at night — his gun in his jacket pocket. It was there now, but what use was a gun against simply being alone in the fog after dark? He didn’t like it. He preferred solid problems with concrete answers — problems he could solve with a bullet or a fist or a gossamer length of surgical thread.
“Of course he does,” said John.
“Faeries did it. I already explained to you that magic generates heat. Don’t you listen at all?”
“It was a complicated piece of blood magic,” said Mycroft, “as you already know.”
, thought John; that was the word for it.
he thought, and snorted again at the unintended joke.
John laid Sherlock’s cock on his belly and slipped a finger under his foreskin, circling the tip as he wrapped his other hand gently around one of Sherlock’s balls.
“I don’t understand the roses, though,” said John. “As you pointed out, telephones would have made much more sense.”
That was as grounded as it was going to get today.
“Ow! Budge up a little.” John grabbed a throw pillow and shoved it under Sherlock’s head so that the offending horn now rested gently across John’s leg.
The second night in Sherlock’s bedroom had been much like the first — John went to bed in his own bed and got up when he heard Sherlock playing.
“I think it’s safe to assume that even a complete autopsy wouldn’t find proof of spell-work,” said Sherlock. “No, I think the conclusion would have been that this man died of his injuries and that the odd state of his liver, appendix, lungs, and kidneys was merely due to the severity of the attack.”
“Your backside.”
“Given it? How?”
And John, feeling sleepy —
He snorted. When they were twelve, an argument like this wouldn’t have ended until their dad took off his belt.
“I’m on the step with the tape,” called John. “It’s fine. I’m stopping here.” Then, because he couldn’t think of a better question, he asked, “Are you playing the violin?”
“Must’ve deleted it,” said Sherlock. “Now quit trying to intimidate John. It’s annoying and fruitless, I assure you.”
He heard the snap of the latches, and Sherlock’s voice near the bottom of the stair. “What next?”
“Why are you warm?” asked John. “You have no metabolic processes.”
“I’m sorry about Mr. Hudson.”
“Yeah, Sherlock. Other things. We could do anything that gives us pleasure that doesn’t require you getting it up. Maybe there’ll be orgasms. Maybe we’d just make each other feel good for awhile.”
John smoothed and petted the spot until Sherlock looked at him again.
The door to the flat was rusty and stiff. Sunlight shone weakly through the grimy windows, falling on furnishings that were at once familiar and strange. The bookcases were still there, but the contents were… off. It was hard to pinpoint why through all the dust. Sherlock’s leather chair was gone, replaced by an armchair of indeterminate colour.
“Is that what he’s doing? Playing with you?”
with men, John had always been the invitee.
Some things are whispered half in the hope that someone will hear and half in fear of it.
“The fog is always here…” She trailed off as she became preoccupied with figuring out how to get the kettle started. John stood back up and went to her. He showed her how to fit the kettle onto its base and flipped the switch.
“What’s to stop me?”
“Better go get ready,” said Sherlock.
“Yes.”
“You aren’t— mmph— wrong.”
Fear began to trickle from his solar plexus to his gut.
Back in his bedroom, he pulled out the mobile and turned it on. 11% charge. He wondered briefly why the house hadn’t seen fit to supply him with a charging cable.
“Holy fuck, you answered,” said Harry.
“I— what?”
What had changed? Sherlock had said that Moriarty wouldn’t let him out of the curse until he’d suffered to Moriarty’s satisfaction.
“John!”
“This just came,” said Sherlock. He laid a photocopy of a newspaper clipping next to John’s breakfast.
“I hate you,” she said.
“John?”
The room contained only familiar shadows in the near-total darkness. The door was closed.
In the gathering gloom of twilight, John Watson leaned on his cane and regarded the fog. It was strange — very strange. For one thing, it was thick. For another, it’s existence seemed confined to this one section of — he glanced at the sign on the corner — Baker Street.
…okay. John tested his current reality. He was naked except for the blanket pulled up to his waist. He was definitely in Sherlock’s huge bed. There was no sound of IV pumps or heart monitors — just the rustle of papers and the sound of Sherlock’s calm, even breathing.
“I don’t know yet. She may have been the target all along, or she may simply have been in the wrong place at the wrong time. But I do know that it didn’t go as planned. He didn’t want the body to be found by other Fae until it had been embalmed.”
“Sherlock?”
John’s mobile rang just as he was about to get in the shower after his run. It was Harry.
“They make your butt look great,” she said. “Length is perfect too.” She shoveled in a couple more mouthfuls of potatoes.
“You can crawl into bed,” said John, walking her back to the bedroom. “But no dying. Only getting better.” He opened the top drawer of her bureau.
So John went on, giving the area around the horn a last scratch before stroking the horn itself, and testing the sharpness of the tip.
John looked at the vial — at the tiny, handwritten label.
“Hey,” said John, snuggling down against Sherlock, “if I fall back asleep, do you think the flat magic will clean me up?”
John knew how to observe, how to draw conclusions. But not with crime scenes — with bodies.
On the screen Guy and… The Ginger One (John hadn’t really been paying attention to the movie, and it had been years since he’d last seen it.) awkwardly dragged each other through a window wearing nothing but tiny red pants. Guy tripped over a ridiculously small credenza and nearly fell into The Ginger One’s arms. They stared at each other for a couple of beats of clearly homoerotic longing.
Well, yeah. One.
“It’s nice to meet you,” she replied as she filled the kettle. “I’m Mrs. Hudson. I own this building.”
“Well, I’m getting to know you,” said John. “Figuring out what you like. Do you need coaxing or are you eager? If you’re into it, I’d probably suck your lower lip, maybe even nip it a little.”
He woke with a shout.
John shook his head.
John chose not to comment on that.
“Do you ever sleep?” asked John.
Sherlock snorted softly. “That’s exactly what it is. It’s a
“You caress them, coddle them. Your hands are strong enough to crush them, but I know you won’t. It’s… it’s exhilarating to… to…”
“Sherlock. Hey, Sherlock.”
“What do you thindk you’re doingd?” she asked, sitting down on the bed.
“And you just live here… all by yourself in a… in an enchanted house… in a pocket dimension of… Faerie?”
There was signal but no new message from Harry. He sent one to her.
From the way Sherlock was pressing his lips together, John gathered there were other ways of looking at it, but that one wasn’t entirely inaccurate. Just what happened between these two? And did John really want to get in the middle of it?
Sherlock’s eyes were open and crinkled at the corners in that way that they always crinkled when Sherlock was well and truly delighted.
John’s hand had become superfluous, and not knowing what else to do with it, he moved it up to Sherlock’s arse. He’d intended to cup Sherlock’s bottom and urge him on, but in the dark, John’s fingertips had landed rather more in Sherlock’s cleft than he’d meant.
“What do you make of this?” asked Sherlock, dropping a couple of eight-by-ten photographs next to John’s plate and sitting in the chair catty-corner from his own.
“And what if you just find some bloke named Avery Dain who made a very smart investment back in 1980?”
“What were you trying to catch a glimpse of then, John?”
"Because he wanted the police to investigate?"
John picked up Sherlock’s paw and set it back down on his hip. “These are fine.”
“I’m… with my hands. I’m human for an hour each night, but you mustn’t see me. It would ruin everything.”
Sherlock took two more steps forward, and then John could see him plainly in the light coming from the sitting room.
He wondered what Sherlock’s hands looked like. His fingers were probably long and sensitive, yet strong. He’d said they had once been his best feature. Was he glad to get them back, if only for an hour every night? Was that why he played? Or was it for John that he played?
“What time is it?” asked John.
“Afghanistan.”
“Thank you, Jane.”  Mr. Holmes looked at the same spot on the floor that Jane had.   “I am grateful... and touched by your loyalty and kindness.”
John? You know I’m useless for further amatory pursuits when I’m like this.” He swept his paw down his body.
“But you didn’t like it? Even though it meant escaping this…” John gestured at the entire flat. “…for a time?”
He wrapped his hand around it and stroked it gently. The skin was butter-soft and smooth, and the flesh it covered didn’t feel entirely flaccid, but thick and spongy. John assumed this was its normal state. He slid his hand under it and lifted. It was heavy and warm.
“Anyway, this faerie granted her a wish — to be used whenever she desired to use it. A future favour, and they don’t just hand those out at street carnivals, John. It was a Big. Deal.
“Here,” said John, taking the ties and fastening them in a firm slip knot. He sat next to Sherlock against the head of the bed and drew the covers over his lap.
John hadn’t slept in his own bed since.
And then — next to the shop, he saw it. A black door with brass numbers — 221B
“I’m still here. I haven’t given up hope — about breaking the curse, I mean.”
leave, of course,” she said, smiling reassuringly. Then she looked down at her cup and sighed. “Sooner or later.”
John finished reading the article. “So — Mrs. Miller said she put a dog’s chain collar on Mr. Miller and fastened it to their bed. She then proceeded to beat him to death with a ‘fish club’ — whatever that is —”
“It’s useless. My heart doesn’t beat, so it can never fill with blood. My kidneys don’t even function, so it’s useless for that too. It’s just this monstrous thing I have to carry around with me, and it serves no purpose other than to mock me.”
“You don’t want me to—?”
He didn’t forgive her yet, but it was only a matter of time.
John sat still and resisted the urge to drop his hand across Sherlock’s shoulder.
And again.
Sherlock made a show of actually contemplating this question before saying, “Nnnnnope. I wish her the best of luck.”
“How do you think I found you a pair of jeans and that shirt, not to mention clean knickers?” He handed her the pyjama bottoms along with a purple t-shirt.
Sherlock was right in that his cock didn’t get any harder, but he was wrong about how exciting it could be. John was fascinated… no, he was enamoured of Sherlock’s cock. His hands slipped up and down, seeking the motions and pressure that pulled the most heartfelt moans from Sherlock’s mouth, that caused Sherlock’s hips to twitch, that made the muscles in his stomach jump and shiver.
Not even a wisp.
“Good. I don’t do requests.”
“There’s me,” said John. “We get on pretty well and I’m not fussed by the age gap, if you aren’t. I mean, I’m not— you know…”
He went into the bathroom for a shower and a shave.
But now he could look, as well. He opened his eyes again.
A small squeeze bottle of lube sat on the middle shelf. He pocketed it.
“Is that an invitation?”
All John could do was stare while the various parts of his brain tried to accept the reality of what he was seeing. The overall effect wasn’t disgusting — alarming, perhaps, but not vile.
Sherlock blinked once, very slowly.
John nodded and crawled out of the bed.
And the quiet was just the absence of others — something he had still not got used to.
And things went back to what passed for normal at Baker Street.
The look in Sherlock’s eyes was neither one of excitement nor anticipation.
“But she fucked it up. And the faerie was stuck with granting her a wish that he really didn’t want to grant, but had to, because there are rules to these things, and he was magically bound to his promise.
“Magic,” said Sherlock.
“It’s pretty new and I’ve been keeping it turned off. Why doesn’t a charger just show up, anyway?”
Whenever he heard Sherlock playing, John got up, put on his tartan dressing gown and slippers, and went down the stairs where he sat and listened with his arms resting on his knees and his toes on the edge of the gaffers’ tape.
“What’s this then?” asked John, taking the tape from Sherlock and placing it on the leading edge of the step himself.
“Say I would,” said Sherlock.
“You know I watch you,” said Sherlock, “when you have the blindfold on.”
“So you talk on that.” John nodded at the telephone. “And Irene Adler talked on this. I assume that one’s Merryweather’s?” He nodded toward a similar rose paperweight.
For the next few minutes, John simply sat, possibly with his mouth slightly open, certainly with his brow knit in concentration, while Mrs. Hudson bustled about, taking cups and saucers from the cupboard and hunting for some biscuits. She finally found them in the first cupboard she’d searched.
“Yes.”
Not that he wanted it to be like his dream. He didn’t want to be hurt.
Sherlock spit what had got into his mouth next to the rest of the come on John’s stomach.
rumble that vibrated John right down to his toes.
“Sleep well, John.” Sherlock’s voice had regained the quiet thunder quality that said he’d changed back into his monstrous form.
John would have sat back down had he bothered to actually get up in the first place.
It hadn’t occurred to John that Sherlock would have a job. Then again, what else would he be doing all day? Reading, clearly. Doing experiments, whatever that entailed. Perhaps the telly worked?
Jane had been the girl-of-all-work at 221 Baker Street for nearly five years when she caught the gentlemen (her gentlemen) kissing on the stair.  She had seen them before, once or twice, just breaking apart as she came around a corner or sharing a quick peck in the garden when they didn't know she could see them from the upstairs window.  She had known, of course, that they were more than friends and colleagues.  She had known it almost from the moment that the nature of their association had changed, but she would never have embarrassed or frightened them intentionally.  Still, when she exited their sitting room and saw Mr. Holmes pressing Dr. Watson to the stairwell wall and kissing him most desperately, she merely stood there, gaping like a fish, while the door behind her finished the trajectory she had already set it upon.  She turned to catch the door before it swung shut behind her, but it was too late.  The gentlemen sprang apart at the sound of the latch catching.  It was their turn to stare at her.
“Yes, that’ll do, Wiggins,” he said. “The money will be there be by nightfall.”
“He had enemies among the Fae. He’s always skated close to the edge of what’s acceptable in their society. Those enemies would have been most interested in knowing that he had, for all intents and purposes, created a thrall in Merryweather -- someone who could, and no doubt did, carry out all sorts of mischief on his behalf.  Or perhaps the whole thing was solely for my benefit. It would amuse him to watch me despair, and his magic powers this dimension and all of the enchantments therein. Were he to die, the spells would eventually degrade.”
“Sherlock! He’s standing right here!”
Sherlock sucked in one laboured breath.
, as Sherlock charmingly put it, and sat on the sofa with Sherlock draped over his lap and fucking his thighs while he milked Sherlock’s prostate (so far, John’s favourite).
John reached down and laid his hand on Sherlock’s slowly bobbing head, winding his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.
And Sherlock’s appearance was also part of the curse, so lifting it meant that he’d be fully human again all the time.
So John spread his legs. He felt Sherlock’s naked calves brush the insides of his knees as he came to stand between them. He felt Sherlock take the two sides of his tartan robe and open it.
But this was the first hour — the only one they’d get.
“It would be better if we took off our clothes.”
“I’m a doctor. I won’t help you poison yourself.”
Harry sent him a message back.
“You’re a treasure, Jane.”
The flat was empty. Well, empty of people anyway.
People who could break the curse were kept away.
It took him a moment to notice that the entire flat was silent.
It swallowed him.
“Compared to what?”
“Yeah? Go on.”
John slammed the case shut and put it back on the mantel.
“Hello,” she said, smiling warmly. “I hope you haven’t been wandering long. Come in, and I’ll make you a nice cup of tea.”
He stopped halfway there. He just had one thing he needed to say first.
Sherlock just handed him the telephone.
That night, the violin woke him at 3:06. John couldn’t make out a tune, but he was pretty sure the mood of Sherlock’s playing was pure frustration. He hadn’t seen much of Sherlock today. After their conversation at breakfast, Sherlock had proceeded to lounge in his chair — legs stretched out in front of him, paws steepled on his chest — and stare at the spot where the mop board met the door frame for a few hours. By the time John returned from his run, Sherlock had disappeared into his sanctum.
That he was already thoroughly entangled.
“I’d just grab that pert arse of yours with both hands and squeeze.”
“Mm-hmm.”
It was like the conversations you have while sobering up with your mates at a coffee shop, John thought. Or as a kid, chatting on the phone after your parents were in bed… or pillow talk.
Back in the bedroom, the big enamelled brass bed was neatly made, and a fresh undershirt and pants lay folded on the foot. The suit John had draped across the chair, however, was missing.
He tried to recall if Sherlock had a cd player. The sound seemed too clear for vinyl and too dynamic for an mp3.
John bit his lip and smiled at Sherlock. “Maybe, for us, there isn’t a whole world of choices out there.”
“I’m going to suck you off,” said Sherlock
The rest of that day and most of the next were taken up with such reveries.
John sighed. “Alright. I’ll pick you up. What time?
There had been a time, a long time ago, when the list of things that turned him on was fairly short. He liked tits. They were amazing things — signs of divine love for all of mankind as far as he was concerned. A plump arse was also very nice. And pussies, once he finally got the chance to experience them, proved to be just as soft and lovely as their namesakes.
“Mmm-hmm,” said John. “I can almost feel it, as a matter of fact. And now, I can watch you back.” He skimmed his fingers over Sherlock’s nipple, letting it catch against the pads as it became erect.
Years of masturbating in situations where willful oblivion had stood in for actual privacy had made John very quiet, but years of experience with partners had taught him the value of feedback. He came with a series of three soft staccato “hahs.”
“I’m no such thing,” said Sherlock.
“Are you saying they weren’t useful, so you deleted them?” asked Sherlock.
“She volunteered to be exiled out of a misplaced sense of loyalty,” was how Sherlock had put it.
Mrs. Hudson came back to the table with a couple of dessert plates and a chocolate pudding. “He was very charming and a fine figure of a man, as we used to say. But he liked to gamble, and he got in with the wrong sort.”
And, if John was being honest with himself, he enjoyed the company. He really wasn’t a person who was accustomed to not having other people around, even if he was one who was accustomed to keeping them at arm’s length.
John smiled and shook his head.
“You don't have to. Not for me.” Sherlock offered.
Sherlock regarded him for a moment, looking him up and down. “I would very much welcome back your constant presence at the flat. Everything else can be discussed another time. You'll excuse me.” He got up and walked down to his bedroom, closing the door behind him.
He looked into John's face and kissed his cheek, a sigh rising from the other's throat. John stirred, arching his back to ease some of the stiffness and failing, grimacing as he nuzzled into Sherlock's curls. He fumbled for the remote and turned off the television. Then he glanced at his watch and groaned.
The night they lay back in their old position: John's back to Sherlock on the small single bed. Nothing happened and John was content.
It was no exaggeration, this had actually happened before, though John had been asleep in bed at the time. Now, he was nudged and protested being ripped out of his safe-haven.
“Don't make yourself too comfortable. We will need...” Watson's speech slowed down as Holmes bent down sideways to produce a vial from beneath the piece furniture they were occupying at the present. “You have planned this all along, haven't you?”
“You will not tell?”
John sat straighter at that, sighing a little as he remembered. “I never bit anyone before, that is still true. I drank the blood of one of my dying mates. As you can probably tell, the bullet had went right through my shoulder, so I didn't have to pull it out. He was already taking his last breaths, I could hear it, so I.. lapped at his open wounds until I had the the balance of a newly turned and just passed out. When I woke up, my wound was already healed, but with my leg and my hand, they sent me home as invalided. God, his face still haunts me.” He had his head hanging, eyes closed to keep the images out. It didn't help. That young soldier was still looking at him like he was seeing ghosts, monsters.
“Maybe you shouldn't have lied to me then.”
“John! Bloody hell, stop running off! Oh, sorry, my brother is a little.. overjoyed sometimes.” a pretty girl said to them with an apologetic look, taking the boy's hand.
! Are they.. From when are they?!” Hamish asked in awe and excitement as he gingerly fingered through the pages of two old books about sciences.
The smaller man fully climbed on the bed then, sitting up against the headboard next to Sherlock and leaning against him. “You're okay with this, right? The whole touching and kissing stuff?”
I gathered the rest of my thoughts as he nodded and began his return back into the columns of his papers. “Before the topic is fully dropped however, I wish to thank you.”
“Hamish, est-ce que tu veux avoir un petit frère ou une petite sœur?” Sherlock asked the boy in a soft voice.
John chuckled endearingly. “You expected, no doubt, I was well past a century? We live just as long as you do.”
He hadn't thought about that. Maybe it was the alcohol, but John could feel his facing warming up. “What, is that a challenge?” he tried to keep his cool.
“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH”
“You know what he is to me. My god, Mary, you have seen it all, can you not understand it? Do we really need this drama?”
Between the blood bubbling out from where his broken rip lay and the noises and the smells, John passed out on the way to the hospital. When he woke up again, he was high on painkillers and Sherlock was in his room. In the middle of the night. That wasn't allowed, right.
Well, here we are.
“But I had no right to be. I don't know
“'Some die sooner, some later. Some of us would know'?”
The look on Sherlock's face when John posed as the man behind the Game was so full of disbelief, hurt and betrayal, that it hurt John in return that Sherlock thought he'd actually be capable of doing these things. Seeing that look being replaced by pure worry as John revealed the bomb beneath the jacket was sort of comforting. Still, he couldn't help but wonder: would Sherlock be here if not for John's involvement?
Sherlock stayed quiet for a little more until raising his eyes from the undefined spot on the table to John's large blue ones, shaped by the bow of his frown. “I just wanted to thank you.”
Flat on his back, he looked beyond uncomfortable rolling his shirt back up. In order for none of it or his hands to be in the way, he had go past his point of comfort and he was torn between looking away and searching John's face for any form of reaction.
Immediately, the boy tucked in, but the thoughtful look never left his eyes. He seemed unable to let topics go as easily as other children his age. John looked at Sherlock, who took his hand in a reassuring gesture and started eating as well. He and John had come to an agreement before adopting Hamish: Sherlock had to eat with them when he was home. John didn't want their son to take Sherlock's eating habits as an example and refuse eating as well. Sherlock coped with that surprisingly well. Yes, now and then he commented in annoyance at having gained 3 pounds in the almost 5 years, but it seemed he was more than willing to sacrifice this for the small boy. Sometimes John wondered who loved Hamish more, he or Sherlock? Anyway, he was glad his lover was so consumed by his love for their son. He'd feared Sherlock would have lost interest after a week or two, but it seemed he found great joy in passing on his knowledge on to an empty 'hard drive'. Or maybe he was just enjoying the possibility to constantly show off. Either way, John enjoyed it, too. They were a lot more peaceful and in harmony since they'd included Hamish in their relationship. They weren't as tense towards each other when it came to arguments and were just incredibly glad to get a minute to themselves. Their shared time was rarer, but more intense; cuddling was a real relaxation technique that had them fall asleep on the sofa a lot; kisses were always filled with a certain longing for some time alone, to go deeper; as for the sex, it was mind-blowing, quite literally. Not having your libido constantly satisfied, made the enjoyment all the greater. If sometimes John wished he could spend more time with his husband, he'd make plans with Mrs. Hudson or Greg or Mycroft to take and occupy Hamish for a day or two so he could drown Sherlock in love and romance and sex. Thinking about it, Hamish could really spend a day with his uncle before they'd all travel to the Holmes' the day after. He could play with his new toys and the way too expensive stuff Mycroft always bought him while John tried out his own new toys with his playmate. A kick to his shin under the table made the inappropriate grin on his face vanish as Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him.
“Thank you.”
“Well, you've settled back in quite nicely.” Mary's familiar voice rang through the flat.
“You were shot. In Afghanistan. You said you never bit someone before, so how did you recover?” Sherlock suddenly asked where he sat, leaning against John.
“I am a pirate.” Sherlock argued and he felt John very close all of a sudden.
“Thirty-eight? That is very unmysterious.” Sherlock remarked, a slight pout dressing his lips.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Maybe.” he answered.
John remained smiling and alone in the flat. Probably for the best as Mary was rather ill-disposed towards Sherlock at the moment. Really, John couldn't blame her, though he really thought he should be the one getting the beef.
He woke Sherlock in the morning, hating to interrupt the man catching up on years of lost sleep, but they needed to move on. John's goal was it to get out of the city by the end of the day – they would be going to a town or village, somewhere smaller, with less people, or corpses in this case.
“What for?”
“Sorry, what now?”
“The fair sex is your department, Watson.”
Neither cab nor tube were an option, soaked and muddy as they were, so they walked back to Baker Street. It took them a good long while and when they arrived, Sherlock was first to occupy the shower. John, meanwhile, prepared some tea to warm them up from the inside and Sherlock took his gladly when he left the bathroom to John.
“Hm.” John hummed in confirmation. “Will leave one hell of a scar, though. Again.” he complained. He prodded around the area with three fingers. “Bone's coming along nicely, too. Bullet went right through it, but it feels stable...”
“Yes, please.” Sherlock simply answered, eyes following the smile that wasn't leaving John's lips.
Moments later the corpulent figure of Mycroft emerged from the upstairs corridor with an insincere smile. “Ah, brother-dear. I was not told your ship had arrived. You promised your arrival one day ago!”
They looted the dead bodies, finding some ammunition, stashing it when collecting their bags before sneaking up to the next floor.
“I told myself I could forgive her because otherwise I would have had to admit the true order of importance to me, which, inevitably, would have meant proving myself wrong.”
He had just discovered the whereabouts of a long-lost treasure; a great heap of gold coins and jewellery. He had solved the great puzzle of the Musgrave and earned his price. The families of his men would never feel hungry again. He could provide his ageing mother and pay off the debt his brother held over his freedom. For over a century this treasure had been lost and he had found it and he ordered his men to take and he clung to the trees on the shore as he looked out to his only mistress with pride. No man and no woman could ever entice him, not with any promises, as the ocean could with her great fantasy, her depth and her mystery. It was a marriage in which secrets had their rightful place, and yet trust was endless between them.
There was a kindness and honesty in John's eyes, that rarely anyone ever saw on him. Sherlock had seen it before, but it had never affected him like this. He whispered a soft 'thank you' and John smiled. “Don't worry,” he replied.
John rolled his eyes and gnawed at the insides of his cheeks, followed by a swift lick of his lips. Just breaking it to Sherlock would be idiotic, chances were high he didn't even know the name and if he ever had, he'd probably deleted it because such 'fantasy' was useless to him. John had to somehow lead him there. “What Moriarty meant, is that some die sooner, some die later and some never seem to die.” Okay, maybe that had been a wrong choice because Sherlock's look was now utterly ridiculous on him. “I am.. not in my thirties. I am, in fact.. in my one-hundred-and-thirties. I was born in 1871.”
To his surprise, Sherlock tore his eyes away from whatever he was studying and turned around “Tea? What happened to coffee?” he asked, obviously confused.
So much for the insecurity. Sherlock hadn't minded their encounters.
“Come back when you're done.”
Mrs Hudson didn't flinch at his roundabout way of telling her to keep downstairs and cease her fussing about their rooms. “I shall leave supper by the door then?”
“You know that very well.” John said simply. While they didn't keep much secret from Hamish, because honestly they couldn't, there was some things a child did not have to know. Like one of his fathers being addicted to adrenaline and danger, making him calm and focused.
John wouldn't have thought Sherlock would agree to this kind of intimacy so quickly.
Unfortunately, excitement never came alone. The annoying reality was, that in between cases, John had nothing to do other than going out to Tesco to avoid going mad inside the flat, where his overly-bored flatmate was doing his best to drag John down into the dark abyss with him. His limb and shaking hand had previously made him made both physically and mentally unfit to work as a surgeon and while his hand still denied him the full potential of his abilities, the rest of him was ready to get a job. His bank account was also ready for him to get a job.
Sherlock considered that. “Is that what makes vampires immortal?”
“I'm not sure.” Sherlock answered, mouth lowering John's shoulder again, from where he started kissing his way to the doctor's neck. “I've always been interested in you.” He threw his mobile onto the other side of the bed and moved to straddle John's lap. The blond gave a small “woah” at the sudden attack, but was otherwise very okay with the turn of events. Sherlock continued kissing his neck and throat, working in little nibbles and sucks. John breathing became laboured under the attention and he could feel, not for the first time in these last 24 hours, how his cock responded to his arousal. “I've never felt any of this before.” Sherlock's deep voice rumbled against his throat and chest, sending a pleasant shiver through him. “I've never wanted someone like this before. I can't remember the last time I was actually aroused.” John could confirm that he was definitely aroused now, if the hardness rubbing against him was any indication.
“Hey, are you alright? Sherlock?” John asked, concern obvious in his voice and expression and it was too much; much more than he deserved. The tear escaped him before he could stop it and he quickly wiped it off his cheek, hoping John hadn't seen it. “Sherlock?”
He should have listened.
His brother, however, rolled his eyes. “You already have a costume – one that cost Mummy a lot of time and effort. You can be a pirate next year.”
“You try to be normal where you're not. You try to make me normal. I thought that's what I wanted, especially after what happened, but it's not who I am. I may be crazy to like Sherlock Holmes, but at least I am myself that way.”
“I think I have little choice other than to believe you.”
“No doubt you've heard of one or two monsters.”
“Break-in at a bakery, another text on climate change like we didn't know already, celebrities, celebrities and relationships, David Cameron as if you even knew who that is..”
The doctor laid off the temptation to capture that side with his own lips until he had spoken again. “I would claim regret, but alas, I do not.”
Sherlock's gaze fell upon the black hat where it lay halfway between them. He stood and walked towards it, plucking it off the stone by its rim. “Was.” he corrected. “My father died when I was a child. He left behind my mother, brother and myself. I followed in his footsteps, whilst my brother became an English nobleman. He sees keeping me out of trouble with the Queen and the law. Still, I could not stay with him. His reputation denies me that. Our mother is sick. He takes care of her best he can, but we doubt she is long for this world. My crew was my family and my friends. He does me great favours, but I would trade one Lestrade for five Mycrofts.”
Sherlock packed, as instructed, mostly their food, giving up his expensive wardrobe to take just the most necessary, which was the outfit he was wearing and three sets of spare clothes – his favourite shirt, the purple one, included.
But like all birds on land, she had her times of anger, an irrational force that drove winds to his sails too strong to tame. He was unlucky with her temper.
“No, I did not.” John turned to pick up the boiling kettle and pour hot water into two mugs with tea bags in them.
Meanwhile, Sherlock was sitting on his bed, thinking. Well, not really thinking, just sorting through a couple of things. John's evaluation had been a self-ironic statement, but it cut deep into old wounds with Sherlock. He needed to irreparably cut those links to avoid false accusations and guilt-trapping John in the future. His rules on 'playing fair' may have been set the pretty way, but he really didn't want to push John into leaving. John had proven that he was too important for that. Two years of torture for him were one thing, but the fact that he'd wanted desperately to go home and see John again had really made some switches click into position.
When at last Watson was satisfied Holmes was thoroughly prepared, he retrieved his fingers and let go of the other man's erection, pouring more oil to coat his own. He pressed inside slowly, gently, very conscious of the pain in Holmes' scrunched up face.
“Meet me here tomorrow at sunset?”
“I was about to say, John, I have thought a little more.. And I wanted to suggest to you that, if you ever felt the need to have sex with someone, I would be okay if you went out and got yourself a partner after talking about it to me. I would propose an 'open relationship' to you, so you could have sex with changing partners, just as long as you don't fall in love with them.”
“You mean that.”
Strangulation is boring, Detective Inspector. If you’re going to murder me, at least make it interesting.
He refused my offer of money in exchange for information.
“Who are you to have shot Martinssen?” he asked in return in his true accent.
time). But the answer, for all he struggled to find it – until his scotch no longer appealed and the shadows lengthened and consumed the room around him – could not have surprised him less.
“You know as well as I that it is in everyone’s best interests to disassemble Moriarty’s empire as quickly as possible,” he replied smoothly.
“Goodnight.”
thought John. “I see,” he said. “You must have a very high boredom threshold.”
“Yes,” he whispered back. “Yes, Sherlock. Like this.” He kissed Sherlock.
“Yeah?”
“Poor man! I couldn’t leave him to face this all alone,” was how Mrs. Hudson put it. “He’d helped me out of a particularly sticky situation. And my sister, God rest her soul, was gone, so I had no one to miss me. Well — except Mr. Tadley, the greengrocer. I think he’d developed a bit of a
But without light, Sherlock was also forced to feel his way.
“It frightened Mrs. Hudson. Since then, I only sleep when I absolutely can’t stand it anymore. And I always set an alarm.”
“I want to see you.” John ran his hand down Sherlock’s torso, down under the blanket, until he reached the line where skin became a dense coat of hair.
“May I kiss you?”
“Right. Why not? Tell me a story then,” said John.
Sherlock stared even more intently at John.
“I’d put my hand on your face and—”
Sherlock grinned, his eyes and everything in the surrounding area crinkling with pleasure.
“It’s five to four,” he said, pushing himself up and off John.
Sherlock put a claw under John’s chin and tipped his face up for a kiss.
Sherlock’s penis was… immense. John supposed it was also somewhat horse-like, at least in size and coloration. Though it was shaped like a human penis, it was brown-and-cream piebald and long enough to literally reach nearly to his knees. (
Sherlock’s paws moved restlessly against the bed until John lifted his head and said, “Do it. Touch me.”
“I’d call it an admiring tone.”
John shivered and moaned softly.
“Sorry. Need anything? Let me know if you’re alive.”
John shifted and snuggled tighter into Sherlock’s side.
He lay there, trying to decide if he’d just had a nightmare or an erotic dream with his cock voting for erotic dream.
“So he fixed the baby’s heart with a patch made of pure Faerie Magic. The child grew to be quite devastatingly handsome, truthfully, but also deeply, deeply… strange. He laughed at inappropriate things, got angry over nothing, thought of no one but himself. In the end, even his mother could no longer love him. Oh, she was fine with him as a concept, but not so much with the reality. She liked the story of her clever sacrifice that saved his life, but not the life that she had saved.
“The curse?” asked John.
“Until you walked into this flat, John, I thought the second option only slightly more likely than the first.”
Except for the line. Two mornings after “the incident,” John found Sherlock clumsily placing a piece of black gaffer’s tape on the third step after the switchback on the staircase leading to John’s bedroom.
“I assume he had some way to make Merryweather look like he hadn’t had the shit beat out of him,” said John.
Mrs. Hudson went to the end of the room with the fireplace and turned to peer into a room on the left. “Sherlock?” she called again. “You have a guest!”
Harry rolled her eyes and grabbed the last piece of toast.
His robe had come untied while he’d been lounging about, and now it gaped open.
But the idea of being surrounded by Sherlock’s massive body — of being naked in the presence of sharp claws and horns and being safeguarded by nothing but Sherlock’s desire to not harm him — was its own kind of erotic.
“What time is it?” asked John.
“Definitely,” said Sherlock, tipping his head back to give John better access.
“Lets you off the hook then, doesn’t it?” she muttered.
“Hmm?”
“It would be your first time, and I’d want to show you how… fucking sweet it can be. How messy and… fun… and profound sometimes. So, damn straight I’d take my time. I’d bury my fingers in your hair. I’d kiss your lips and your face and your neck. I’d put my mouth on your nipple, and I’d lick and suck until you cried out, and then I’d do the same to the other one. I’d get down on my knees and kiss your stomach and your ribs and those hollows next to your hip bones. I’d leave your dressing gown on, Sherlock, trapping the heat and the scent of your skin, and you’d know that I could smell you as I licked and bit the tops of your thighs. I would be breathing in the scent of your arousal, feeling the heat of it against my face. I’d drive every thought out of that magnificent brain of yours, if only for a second, and all you’d be able to think about is how badly you want to me to take your cock into my mouth.”
John decided that he would pursue the very interesting topic of how Sherlock came to view blow jobs “on many occasions” some other time.
“Mmm,” said John, his lips still on Sherlock’s. “I… uhmm…” He kissed Sherlock again. “May I touch your horns?”
He ran up the steps and pounded on the door.
“London has never had a shortage of people living on her streets. And since people rarely see what they don’t want to see…”
John remembered something Mrs. Hudson had said when they were having tea in her kitchen. “But I can leave. Like the others who wandered in.”
Yeah, I do. What was he like? Did he charm your pants off too?

He waited two weeks – more a matter of his pride and Sherlock's punishment than an actual desire to be away. He would take another bullet to the shoulder before he admitted it in words, but he really did miss it. He really did miss
“You remembered his name.” Sherlock just managed to stop himself from throwing his magnifying glass at Lestrade, deigning to only glare over his shoulder.
I appreciate kudos, subscriptions, bookmarks, and comments, but just inflating the hit count makes me happy. So sit back and enjoy this fic from this happy author.
The emotion dropped from the man’s face, replaced with the alien expression John had pictured earlier. John might have been disappointed, if it weren’t for the faint edge of panic in the corners of his eyes. “A colleague of mine insisted that I take such a picture with you, or else he wouldn’t let me in on the case of the serial suicides, despite the fact that he knows he couldn’t possibly solve the case by himself and could cost dozens of people their lives, but he’s stubborn and enjoys having a chance to irritate me for some incomprehensible yet likely inane reason.” John couldn’t stop himself from gaping, either at the rate the words poured out of the man’s mouth – when did he

It brought me into contact with you, didn’t it?
“I’m not sure if I can qualify the orgasm of my life as ‘good’, to be honest,” he replied, deciding on lightheartedness. He had a feeling earnestness would be misconstrued as platitudinous. “‘Fantastic’, maybe. ‘Brilliant’, surely. ‘Glorious’, absolutely.” He felt Sherlock nip at his ear, grinning.
I don’t understand. One minute he’s complimenting me, the next he’s saying I look like a posh alien
“Hey, how are the intimidation tactics treating you?” she greeted him.

Joan and Sherlock confront Sherlock.
He loved Sherlock Holmes. He was mad and rude and unpredictable and condescending and surprisingly thoughtless and self-absorbed and he, Dr. John H. Watson, loved him with every bone in his body. Brilliant, extraordinary, fantastic – these were assets, the hook that drew him to the surface. But the rest, the issues that drew so many away, that should have driven him away? They were the net that doomed him. It was the whole of him that would keep John gasping until he was with him, beside him, however he could be. The fact that he was bloody fucking gorgeous certainly didn't hurt.
Seriously, Myc, details!
How have we not lost interest in this completely irrelevant stranger?
Whiskey forgotten, John templed his fingers beneath his chin (a self-conscious method of focus, turned comforting gesture, turned habit) and let himself analyze his own thoughts as Sherlock – no, as
Guys stop
He didn't know London well, which gave him a welcome, if not somewhat inadequate distraction. Picking his deliberate path to the Estates took concentration, and the greyscale spectacle of the city picked at the leftovers. Here, an elderly man sitting with his grandson, feeding pigeons; there, a child with a wild mop of dark curls, not five years younger than him, running alongside a ginger dog, his eyes wide with joy and something else John couldn't quite identify. Here, the scent of curry; there, a thick plume of cigarette smoke blown directly in his face. It was sensory overload in the best way, and John drank it all in.
Does the other bloke with you really look like he’d attack you? – GL
"Afghanistan or Iraq?" And yeah, John was definitely going crazy. Definitely, absolutely, 100%. Because there was no way the man in front of him was the same man who was with the Doctor in the blue box. There was no coat, no red buttonhole, but the face was the same. John tended to remember faces for a long time, and that was the prat's. It was just impossible; for one thing, the man looked nearly ten years younger, which should have been impossible. But if John was one thing, it was stubborn in the face of the impossible. He played along, and may have just gotten a flat and a flatmate out of the deal.

What he found there was quite the mob. Six different nurses were crying, screaming, or hurling abuse and profanities through a door at the end of the hall, and Joan stood in front of it, arms blocking the entrance, back stiff with anger and annoyance. When she caught sight of him, she sent him a slightly panicked look, and he smiled and pulled out his whistle. A few loud, prolonged shrieks of the whistle later, all of the nurses were holding their ears and staring at him with complete hatred.
They happened to end up on the sofa together by happy coincidence every night, then. Sherlock started eating regularly, taking his meals together with John. Then he'd lay thinking on the sofa until John went to sleep. After a week or so John stopped telling himself it was coincidence. After nine days, he turned around, he couldn't keep showing Sherlock his back, he needed to touch someone, to feel a human being still beside him. The younger man didn't seem to mind. While he'd always been one to feel uncomfortable with anyone touching him, he'd never shown signs of displeasure at John's touch; no comments, no swipes, not even disgusted glances. It made him feel privileged and, god damn him, he needed that right now.
Whatever it was, they went on solving crimes together.
Sherlock hummed, his tone amused. “That's a first. Hmm. Animal, plant, theme or object?”
For minutes they basked in each others embrace, sharing the slow, trusted swing of their bodies together, sealed at the lips and conversing in unintelligible noises understood only by the other man. It wasn't rare, these days, that they got to share this with one another. It had taken some time to feel confident in the secrecy, but now they had made this place their own and they revelled in it. There wasn't many a place they were legal to share their affections and beside private room at the Turkish baths, 221B Baker Street was their safest place to be, a haven in a world much more ignorant than them. Holmes had always been an eccentrically modern man, but the public mistakenly continued to underestimate Watson. Holmes could appreciate him and in return, he found comfort and reassurance in Watson. Their hearts full of each other and their bodies aflame with passion, intercourse never detained them for terribly long. It was just as well – they each preferred the calm that came after the storm to the one before it. So they tipped over together; Watson stopping in his movements and Holmes curling around him as release pulsed through them both.
Sherlock grinned at that, his hand falling to John's arm, squeezing his biceps. “Then what are these for?”
John would spent a lot of time looking outside, watching the stumbling figures with something akin to pity and envy. At least they didn't think about it any longer. Didn't worry.
Then again, it had been the night that Moriarty had nearly taken both their lives. Surely that's something to bond over, too, right?
“Hm?” Sherlock asked unquestioningly.
“A couple.” John breathed. “My vitals will begin to fall again once my body's used up all your blood. But we need to wait for your body to detox itself.”
“As it happens, yes. It's nice. It's affordable. He isn't my first flat share.”
“I've read a myth that the transformation is considered a rebirth that can heal any lethal wound or disease?” Sherlock inquired further, curious.
“Oh, give that here!” Sherlock scolded, taking the colour and brush from his partner and leaning down to take over. “Really, John, for a doctor, your knowledge of the bone structure of the human skull is atrocious.”
“Yes, that's what it sounds like to me.. Utterly useless..”
Moriarty made him say things. Things like “This is a turn-up, isn't it, Sherlock?” and “Gottle o' geer”, which was just pure sarcasm. John being the ventriloquist's doll.
“I've read that sunlight can do a great many things to you.”
“The ocean,” John began, freeing one hand to pluck away Sherlock's from his cheek and trace his thumb over the back of the pale fingers, “is everywhere. I'm not.”
“I can do that for you, you know I can.”
Sherlock was clever, and insensitive, as ever. He seemed to genuinely enjoy the tests he was given, without a care for the people whose lives were at risk. They were only the trophies, the confirmation of him giving the right answers, nothing more. Or were they? John wasn't so sure at times.
“That's not the whole of it.”
He would have to talk to John. Again.
They'd never been this close before. Sure, they were getting on surprisingly well, but all this, Sherlock caring for him – it had only really started when John had fallen ill, after he'd told Sherlock about what he was. Was he just an experiment now? Interesting on a scientific level? But then what about the recurring fact of Sherlock's pulse picking up whenever they were physically close to each other? That had started well before John had told him. He'd been hearing it since about after his second conversation with Mycroft and it had started as a mere irregular beating every other moment. Now it was an entire marathon being run inside the man. Not that John didn't react similarly. It made him very happy to hear the quick, strong rhythm whenever he could. And the way Sherlock looked at him when he drank from him. John had his eyes closed most of the time, but the atmosphere was just so intimate, so unlike anything he'd experienced before. When he was turned, it was crude, brutal and unwanted. It had been the first and the last time he'd been bitten and it had certainly not been the vampire's intention. He'd felt no intimacy in that and neither had he when he'd drunken others' blood to save his life.
“Am I
“So, Afghanistan..”
After a while, his face lit up and he slowly backed away from his discovery. “Ooooh, that's it!
He brushed a hand over her hair. “I know, mother. We were attacked and robbed.”
In an instant, Sherlock sat upright and set to follow John's direction. “I'll put on my pyjamas.”
For a while, Watson was silent and I dared not to look up at him. I could hear by the absence of noise from his paper, that he was still contemplating this topic and anything in his memory, which might serve him as addition to it. When he did raise his voice again, his tone was gentle and careful. “You have described men under another excuse.” Very, very slowly, as if he expected I might jump to his throat, he lowered the paper and looked at me directly. I felt his gaze for a long moment before seeing it with my own eyes. He was calm, his expression as open and welcoming as ever I knew it. In times such as these I had troubles recalling the man he could also be under the right influences, though he never seized to be a man of great morals and justice. “There have been a great many times when you saw your own prejudices against women at fault and yet you never once cared to correct them. In fact, you always held on to each one. I have always put that down as one of your queer traits and not thought more of it, but there is more to it, is there not?”
Except that mentioning that to Mike seemed to open up an option, or at least the possibility of one. John had no real desire to share a flat with anyone, to figure out how to deal with a person in the damp suppression of the city versus the desperation that dried up with everything else in the desert. He didn't want to have to explain his limp and his nightmares to some anti-social idiot, didn't want to have to make the decision of whether or not he'd reveal his biological sex, didn't want anyone around to witness his descent into madness.
Half an hour later, Sherlock stepped out of his own cab, closed out of the window about river currents and the Hudson, and strode into the hospital to meet Watson and the police. Without pausing to look around, Sherlock veered to the right side of the lobby to meet with Bell (he always flirted with the fairly attractive nurse who worked on that side of the hospital). “Well?” he asked, bounding up to him. “Where’s our mystery swimmer?”
“Consulting detective,” the man said stoutly, and Sherlock wasn’t sure whether he was more surprised by the British accent or the words he spoke. “Sherlock Holmes, to be precise. I would greatly appreciate it if you would stop harassing my partner Miss Watson. We are only trying to help.”
It drew closer to him. He remained boneless. A hand, cold and wet touched his wrist and he grabbed it, attempting to take advantage of this blunt approach, but the moment he had drawn his first deep breath, his grip weakened and he coughed violently against the water in his lungs.
Slowly Sherlock let himself slide sideways so he was sinking lower, ending on many short, but desperate, pecks before laying his head down in John's lap.
Sherlock stayed quiet for a moment before shifting to cuddle up against John's side. The doctor threw his arms around the lean body fondly. “We are going to get through this, right?”
Watson an myself were sitting together for breakfast on a grey and rainy Sunday morning. His eyes were focused upon the fantastical stories printed in the newspaper. I myself was enjoying a rather luxurious choice amount of breakfast. It was, until this point, promising to be a quiet, enjoyable morning, with the rain providing a rather musical undertone of melancholic atmosphere. My good friend, however was never one to appreciate the English weathers and so sought every distraction from the noise that he could find. At times, it did enough to not acknowledge it, but on that day, no such simple solution seemed to him to be satisfactory.
John gave a crooked, half-dirty smile back. “What's caught your interest in me so suddenly?”
Guns were raised to their heads immediately. John tried to dissolve the situation by offering food in exchange for shelter and protection by the group. There were some negotiations, but in the end, hunger won out and they were accepted in, ultimately won over by the mention of John's military career and Sherlock's intellect.
But there was none of that in Mycroft's eyes now. They were the cold, hard gaze he had experienced in their first encounter; the distrust and expectancy of the wrong move. He was every bit a chess player and John, while not strategic, a worthy opponent.
John shook his head. “I don't get it, then.” His eyes fell to were the blood-stained shirt hung limply, released by Sherlock's fingers as soon as with John's first words. “Really, I just want to make sure it won't be a problem... Do you. I mean, is it...” John seemed unable to finish his sentence, though his thoughts seemed to have a very good and precise objective in this.
“I'm not gonna bite you!” John retorted angrily, though it made his head swim.
And he would bet they weren't the only ones who've had that idea. Most certainly not everyone had fled north.
Sherlock gasped and put on his worst expression of exasperation on. “You think I'm mocking you?! Oh, no! John, I take it very seriously when you tell me you have lived through two world wars and only got damaged after a hundred years fighting in Afghanistan!” Sherlock would have laughed, John knew he would, only the unmoved features on the blond's face seemed to stop him. “Come on, John, this is pathetic. What kind of game is this? Are you taking the piss on me because I doubted you? Which, frankly, I did not even do.”
Sherlock's breath touched his neck a blink before his lips latched onto it, one of his hands joining John's, travelling there by caressing over his chest and stomach. A warmth was coiling in the lower centre of his abdomen. “So weird.”
“We should play something.”
Sherlock frowned. John sounded so honest saying that, which made Sherlock understand even less. “B.. But then what's the point of-”
“It's just a kiss.”
“182 years. They are collections of some of the very first theories on chemistry, physics and biology.” Sherlock answered.
“Imagine my surprise.” John mocked with a straight face, smirking only when Hamish showed a broad grin of his own. He shot him a look to not speak and started painting his eye sockets black. “Did, uhm, did Mummy forbid it?”
They spent the following night in the same village, but would leave the next day to avoid conflict. They'd take course to Sherlock's parents.
It sounded like more than just an offer and Sherlock found the corner of his lips twitching.
The following morning, John felt like a wreck. The very first thing he did was calling in ill to work. He wouldn't usually mind working ill, but this cold had taken him so quick and so bad, he barely made it downstairs without falling. He decided to take a break on the sofa instead of going straight for the kitchen, causing an irritated Sherlock to approach him from there. Sherlock's nose had a light touch of red to it and his eyes looked tired. John had been right; Sherlock had caught it, too. “What are you doing?” the brunet asked, confused by his flatmate's unusual behaviour.
(See the end of the chapter for
John laid a hand on his shoulder and put down a mug on the table. “Do you want to talk?” His question was very carefully voiced. Sherlock really didn't, but he supposed he would have to sooner or later, so he shrugged.
“You do not have to say anything of which you don't wish anyone to know, Holmes. I have done my part in this equation, I shall not force you into any open confessions.” After that sentence, there was a pause, one in which I feared we were frozen. I could hear my heart pounding in the very top of my skull and I knew that colour must have drained from my face. “I only wish you to know that you needn't fear betrayal of your trust from me. I have no reason to value your companionship any less or to reduce the quality and quantity of my affections toward you.” His words were as gentle as they were strong. First, I could not keep looking at him.
Sherlock opened his eyes again, observed the daring look of eyes much deeper than the sea and cocked up one eyebrow. “You would not dare.”
Sometimes, they just sat there, looking at each other. Other times, they didn't pay each other the simplest of glances, couldn't bear the honesty they knew sat behind the flat faces, the dishonest, short half-smiles; the bare soul of uncertainty. Trying to keep the spirit high was remarkably difficult these days. Maybe it was because their landlady, who had died approximately half an hour before being found, had come upstairs to greet them with a friendly long groan. Maybe it was the fact that she was going right for Sherlock. Maybe it was the fact that John finally put her out with a gunshot to the head. But, you know, maybe he was just being a little paranoid.
Sherlock, struck with confusion and disbelief, found himself unable to reply. The strange man turned on his back, his lower body rising to the surface as he floated beside him, gaze directed at the once more blue sky. “And what do you do with the gold you find? Bury it some place else? I don't understand the concept of piracy very well.
lived here for quite a while before.” he answered, drying his hands on a towel. “Tea? Coffee?”
“Oh, don't lie, John! You'd feel just as uncomfortable and misplaced without me!” Sherlock retorted and John cocked his head in challenge.
“If you have nothing but shit to give me, Mary, I suggest you leave and try to shift your centre of interest a little.”
It was the 23 of march when they got called. Well, Sherlock got called. Well, emailed. Sherlock got emailed. But John followed. Sherlock asked him to, and after fighting with darn technology, yet again, literally
The doctor turned around to regard Sherlock with a pleading expression. “Why do you think I know?”
“No way Sherlock's going to raise a child.” Mary spat as if it was the most absurd thing she had ever heard. Much to Sherlock's displeasure.
“Sherlock.” he answered, reaching up again. He smiled and nodded gratefully. “You can come to our house tomorrow and take the hat back home with you, if you want. But only if you play with me!”
He wished he'd never had reason to doubt John. “I don't blame you. I just want you to know that I don't have a problem with it. Not everyone does. Besides, I'm not a perfect man, either, who am I to judge your scars? I've got my own.”
“..was basically just an eccentric sun-bath, yes.” John grinned.
The brunet blinked, not understanding where that question came from. “Why would I be angry?”
It was a strange day, shady newspapers printing half-stories about some weird and brutal incident over in Germany. Apparently, a man bit off a strange passenger's ear, continuing to 'feed on his flesh' amidst the rush of life in the middle of a street. Other passers by tried intervening, helping the attacked man, but said 'cannibal' was said to be unbelievably strong and bit four of the helpers until he could successfully be tackled and held down. The police took the man in for custody; the hurt persons were taken to hospital. That was it. Further development was still to be seen.
Sherlock looked down at where his hand was pressing against his stab wound, his white shirt soaking up the blood, making it look more dramatic than strictly necessary. He shook his head, waving his other hand dismissively. “It's fine. I'll clean it when we get home, bit of dressing. Had worse.”
I wish everyone a Merry Christmas! Whether you celebrate with our without a family - may you have a lovely time!
John looked at him in surprise. “Coffee.” he replied and watched Sherlock make his way back into the kitchen.
John chuckled, but lowered himself into the soft pillow. “Because where else would you be.” he smiled, though Sherlock had left the room long ago. It didn't take John long to fall asleep to Sherlock's smells in the bedsheets.
Sherlock mirrored his cheeky grin. “Like with any drug, I'll get used to it eventually and it won't have as grave an effect on me. That doesn't mean I'm not interested in exploring what else this new drug can do for me.” he whispered the last part into John's ear. The older man grabbed Sherlock by the waist. “It's been five and a half hours. Surely that's good enough to get another fix, hm?”
For a moment, John and Sherlock watched Hamish's intelligent eyes as he processed this information. “What about the other children then? Are they still there?”
“To never see me again.”
“No,” John raised his index finger to shut him up, “no, I have not done this for nothing, Sherlock. This is incredibly difficult for me, you know that perfectly well, I have spent valuable time and effort trying to figure these things out and I'm not going to be stopped by your pretentious cold attitude.” something in John's voice made Sherlock quiet. Something always did. “I am sorry for what I said when you came back. I'm sorry for ever blaming you. I'm sorry for leaving you alone.”
John threw him an open and honest look at that. “
John drank like a dying man, probably literally, until he could tell that Sherlock wasn't too far off from being re-balanced. He pulled the arm away from himself, wipe over the holes in the skin and then over his mouth.
Doubtlessly she was considering taking a handful back. “Thank you, for your kindness and have a good evening.” he said in parting, tugging at Sherlock's arm to pull him back to the pavement. “One more comment like this, Sherlock, and we're going straight back home.”
Personally, Sherlock and John thought it wise to stock up on food for themselves and Mrs. Hudson – when hell breaks loose, people panic and horde up all the supermarkets have to offer; best to take precautions. Although, of course, Sherlock still rarely ate, which, as terrible as it may sound, might act up in their favour for what seemed to be lingering in the shadows ahead of them.
enticing to you?” the merman asked with a grin. Truly, Sherlock had to admit, he was handsome and he didn't seem too indecent. His curiosity spoke of an eager mind. “I do not wish for your demise, Sherlock, there would be no point. I do envy you, however. You get to conquer both land and water – I am tied to one of them.”
“Okay, stop! You know you could have just waited and asked me when I returned, right?” John requested and judging by Sherlock's expression, the man could not have waited. “Well, first of all, you've seen my fangs. The teeth just morph into shape when I demand it. It's true that human blood is very... enticing to us, but not for the sake of nutrition. It's more like a survival instinct. A vampire's blood can transport all vital nutrients through the body, but not the components of the immune defence system. They are still inside our bodies, but they cannot be transported, so they just die and are replaced without ever doing their duty. That means, that even the smallest illness can be lethal to us
The doctor frowned at him, clearly confused by his behaviour. He wasn't stupid, bless him, this wasn't his 'Sherlock you are being unnecessarily complicated and irritatingly proud' face. This was the face John made when he suspected a reason beyond his grasp and knowledge. He was intrigued, but uncertain if he should ask about it. “Something the matter?”
“I think so.” It was a clear statement that sounded like it had been given a lot of thought. John sounded convinced of his decision.
“Are you high?!” John had to ask eventually.
Sherlock could guess what it might be. “No, it's not. Well, it is in a way.” He sighed, not knowing how to convey his issue on this matter. “Fine, but...” The rest went unsaid, but was heard all the same. He rolled the hem of his shirt back up just enough to show John the wound. The doctor looked into his face to seek his final consent and Sherlock nodded before looking away. It would, no doubt, have been easier if Sherlock was sitting down, but his legs felt too stiff to move and John didn't want to push him in an already uncomfortable situation like this. He was kneeling in front of Sherlock, nudging his hands up a little more as he tried to work, but the fists were blocking the light and hindering John's movements.
“Mostly?”
“Your brother's name is Mycroft? Your parents had poor taste.” John joked, before realising what off a reaction that was. “I didn't mean- apologies!” he tried to sooth, but Sherlock shook his head, smiling.
“Do you feel ashamed of them? Or were you scared that I might insult you and run out of here?”
Sherlock's eyes were hard, distrust flashed up in them and John hated it. They were friends. Sherlock was the maddest and bloody well best friend John had ever had. He couldn't look into his eyes if they spoke to him like that. “Sherlock, please. Just drop it.”
Sherlock followed his eyes down to John's tail. Only there were no scales. “Did that... hurt?” he asked, looking at John's nude legs; now two separate limbs.
Sherlock scoffed at that. “Don't be so dramatic. It's just a cold- oh.. I, er.. I forgot.” apparently the detective suddenly remembered and his tone was tinged apologetically.
He scraped a hand down his face. Without the adrenalin of the day, realisations hit him hard – this
“Oh, I'm not scared of kissing you! What about you? Talking big-” the rest of his provocation was just a quiet hum as John pulled his head down and his lips into a kiss. Sherlock always thought of John as a good and passionate kisser, but he was still sure this wasn't what was necessarily expected under a simple mistletoe.
“Because I hoped it was a one-sided affair.” she admitted, looking sadly at John. “Obviously I was quite blind in that.”
It went as usual after that day. For months they continued doing their stuff, with no further mention of what had happened. That was, until John found himself hospitalised by a bullet in his side.
“This was it weeks ago, Mary.”
“Imagine me, I knew I was about to die.”
Nobody knew how it happened. Of course. No one ever does. Or rather, no one ever informed the people. And then, it was too late.
John merely sighed in mild relief. “Thank you.. Now, I don't know how far Mary will go with this and if she will manage to get a grip on herself some day, but I would like to know how much you actually meant what you said earlier. About raising a child- my child.”
John chuckled. “Shut up!” he replied fondly, taking a second to rest his tired eyes. “Seriously, though, you don't need to do this stuff. Nothing has to change between us.”
“You make it very hard to argue with you.” John's eyes were bright but sad with hope and sensibility.
“Yes. I told her it wasn't that bad and that they ordered a few days bed rest and you'd be back to normal.” Sherlock explained in an even voice. John just hummed his understanding. “I figured you should be on the main floor of the flat while you recover and maybe not within eyeshot of the entrance in case she or someone else comes in at an... impractical time.” he said further, smirking a little and looking up as he peeled away the gauze from John's wound.
“Idiot.”
“Safety first!” Hamish advised. “Since I broke your old goggles, I wanted to replace them, but I had to save up the money for them. As for dad-” the boy began, climbing down again and handing John a present as well, “I wanted to get you something, too, so I made them both your Christmas presents!”
Sherlock wanted to smother John with useless affection for his display of honest concern and his willingness to put Sherlock's needs and wishes before his own ego. “You're not the problem, John.” He had aimed for something that would reassure John on more than one level, giving him reason not to pursue the topic any further, but he had failed very obviously.
“Bad?” Sherlock enquired, stopping his movements to await John's answer.
John caught his arm. “Arlight! Alright. It
“Sex isn't everything, Sherlock. I mean, it's nice, yes, to me, to most people and having sex with someone you love is just an incredibly beautiful experience, but it's not what it's all about. Not for me, not for you. Sure, I'd like to try out some things with you one day, I won't pretend I'm not interested, but I can wait. And if I wait till I die, I won't regret having spent so much quality time with you.” John reached out, tucking a dark curl back. “Just tell me if something's okay or not. Initiate whatever you want yourself. I'm not a monster. I've had my time to play.”
“He's doing well. Shouldn't be too long.”
So the lay, on the too small furniture, embracing the flutter of their hearts in the quiet of their sitting room.
“Hang on! What?!” Lestrade said with his usual burst of intelligence.
he was thinking, probably nothing at all, but this, just feeling, physically feeling a warm, breathing, pulsing body beneath his hand, it was the most incredible sensation he could remember having ever had. When Sherlock calmly blinked awake, he didn't say anything, didn't tell him to stop. So John didn't. In fact, he went to touch more, feel more. Sherlock never drew back when their lips met. He didn't protest when John absent-mindedly lead his friend's hand to his lonely cock. He felt so fucked up, he didn't even care that it was Sherlock doing this any more. He just needed this right now. He even tried to return the favour, but Sherlock stopped his hand and held it till they fell back asleep.
John tugged the jumper in place, make-up laying right by his side. “Come on, Sherlock! It's Halloween! Do you want him to be the only 5-year-old in London to not go trick-or-treating?”
As the effect of the drugs got weaker, John began moaning in pain. Sherlock all but carried him upstairs. He couldn't get John up to the second floor and leaving him on the sofa would be unwise in more than one way, so he took him back into his own bedroom. His bed was big and comfortable and within easy reach of everything. He'd be able to take care of John there.
John tilted his head. “But all this pointing out stuff, calling things stupid.”
John sat down outside the door, knife to his left. With great relief, he recalled not seeing Greg among any of the corpses they had dropped in here – there was a chance their friend had somehow survived. He regretted having had so little contact with the DI before London got overrun.
“I won't be content.” Mary said I a way that screamed to raise pity. But John had been friends with Sherlock Holmes for years now, he wasn't manipulated that easily any more.
“I must admit, you did good on hiding from me, John. Then again, I had little time researching you before our very first conversation and finding this piece of information required a deeper digging.”
The most memorable and hardest thing Moriarty made John say was “Ever questioned him? Never weight his loyalty? Or is he really just a little pet?” John didn't know how Moriarty knew, but he knew where this was going. “Nice touch, this: the pool where little Carl died. I stopped him. I can stop John Watson, too. Stop his heart.”
“Oh, would I indeed not? Why so?”
“Hey, are you a bee?!”
“Oh, let's see..” he commented and began unwrapping the present in the same way that Hamish did. It was nice to see how much they valued getting presents. “A pair of gloves and safety goggles. How nice.” he said in amusement.
“I am the commander of this vessel. My men have been robbed and murdered, then you appear and try to save us – I command you tell me your name! Who gives you orders?” he raged, but the strange man only had wonder in his face.
“A vampire? Count Dracula? Twilight?” John offered. Sherlock looked back at him, expectant. “Well, they are lousy examples, I give you that, but at least they're cliché.”
John turned around putting bacon on a plate. “What are you talking about?” he asked with a smile towards his boys.
John thought for a moment. “Okay. Twenty Questions. I'll think of something first.”
“John. John, come on, you need to get out of here. They've taken the bullet out. But we need to get you home before they find out.”
“Yeah, we're talking an actual baby here, Sherlock.”
“And you choose to rely on me?!” Sherlock said with an ironic grin that soon changed into a warmer smile when John chuckled.
John sat down with them as he finished loading the table and looked at their son. “We adopted you. Your mummy and daddy couldn't take care of you the way you deserve so they gave you to a home with many other children where people like your father and I can go to see you and talk to you, talk about you with one of the nannies and then decide whether they want you as their child or not. Many people do that. Same-sex partners like us, mixed couples who can't or don't want to have own children. We wanted a son and so we went there to give a boy a family.”
“Oh, I am not sure we shall need it. Do inquire Dr Watson, when he returns, whether he will require food.”
“Will you have a divorce?”
“Yes, this definitely needs stitches.” He carefully moved the skin around, looking at the cut edges and how it would line up when put back together. “I can do it here, if you want to. I've got some stuff for small stitching. Otherwise I'll have to call an ambulance.. Your call.”
Sherlock sat up and looked at John with a very unholy expression. “Most definitely not.”
Sherlock seemed to consider John for a moment, but apparently settled on the fact that that was precisely who he was; John. He took the paper towel and John grabbed a cloth, dampened it under the sink and knelt to clean the floor before Sherlock. It was just John. John with a surprising new skill. “Don't be alarmed. They are there to pierce human skin and create a controllable flow of blood to drink. I have never done that, however.” he got up again and simply tossed the cloth into sink with abandon. Looking up, he saw Sherlock still clasping the paper towel to his chin, although his expression was calmer now, still irritated, but calmer. “I'd say 'I'm sorry I never told you', but I'm not, so I won't. Please, I have an early shift tomorrow. Let's just sleep on this, calm down, it's been a turbulent day, and talk about this tomorrow, okay?”
He didn't correct the taller man when he remarked with a smirk that John was enjoying this. In a very sad way, he did. Sherlock had it all there, in his mind, John could picture it. This was back to war; this was Captain Watson again and yes, the world was dead, their closest friends and family were all likely dead, but he couldn't help it.
John looked up at him a little taken aback. He didn't know that was actually a thing. “And I thought you just liked me a lot. Well, I won't complain..”
They had even tried sharing a bed once already, but found that was too much for Sherlock as for now. A strange sense of urgency and stress had overcome him quickly, and he asked John to leave for his own room. John had calmly and kindly agreed, pecked his cheek and trotted back upstairs sleepily, not holding a grudge against Sherlock, which had been a great relief to the brunet. Anyone else, he was sure, would have accused him of making a fuss and not making an effort; which made him even more glad to have John and made him feel even less like he deserved his kindness and respect.
“We'll come to an agreement.”
“They were sailing under English flag. I will go speak to Mycroft immediately after. I wanted to know you are well.” he assured and explained.
John released a surprised giggle. “It's weird.” But he kissed Sherlock again, leaning into it more, increasing intensity. His breath shuddered with both excitement and uncertainty, his lower body alien, moving and reacting in ways he'd never thought he would experience. Sherlock's hip bumped into his and he flinched as rough fabric chafed against his sensitive new skin. He sent a hand down to brush over his hip bone, a shudder running down his spine at the unexpected sensation. His eyes were following his movements, noting how little hairs rose to stand their pride.
His big green eyes scanned his face as he suckled on his thumb briefly before nodding with another delighted giggle. It sometimes shocked John how mature and intelligent the boy was for his young age of only five years. Granted, he tended to be silent, chose noises over words and many people actually thought he was far behind in his development, but when they got to know him, they discovered he was just a little shy and very, very thoughtful. He knew all the words and he knew how to say them, but he seemed to forget that people understood by hearing, rather than by reading his mind. Either way, John was proud of him. The boy rushed past them, having acknowledged that he'd get less fussing if he just followed daddy's rules. He began digging out plates, mugs and cutlery, a set of which they'd deposited in the lower cupboards of the kitchen, the ones Hamish could reach. John giggled in proud delight and turned to kiss Sherlock's cheek on the way to the stove where he set to prepare a festive breakfast while Sherlock repeated French vocabulary with him. He was ever so fond of Sherlock finding occupation in playing and teaching their son as well, even if he thought he was taking his education a little too far for Hamish's age, but the boy seemed to have his fun. At least he spoke a lot during these lessons
“I'm not even disappointed.”
Retirement turns out to be easier planned than done for a constantly working mind. Watson knows how to help.
, but I understand now. I think. And it has lead me to think about myself as well.”
“My crew calls- called me Blackbeard.”
They didn't talk about it, didn't even mention it the next day. Everything went like their usual routine. But that day, finally, Sherlock ate something. John felt sickly satisfied to watch him chew on those beans, swallow spoonful after spoonful, until his entire bowl sat empty before him. He was aware that Sherlock's eyes were laid on him, but he couldn't bring himself to meet them. Looking into the cold, analytic stare of his best friend, his only friend, was about the last thing he could deal with right now; he'd rather keep his mind alive and distracted instead of being reminded of what lingered outside.
(See the end of the chapter for
John chipped in. “There's fibres from the rope stuck between her teeth. She must have bitten hard on it.”
Were John not who he was, he would have picked at Mycroft for that mistake. Speaking specifically of his brother instead of just naming his name, Mycroft had shown weakness, although, John expected, that was just what the pale man had wanted. If John made use of this, he would prove the suspicion, that brought them together here, right. “I can guarantee you that I have no desire in getting close to Sherlock in that way.”
Sherlock gripped the banister, if only to give some venting to the pain, and when he arrived upstairs, John had already removed his jacket. Noises were coming from the bathroom, no doubt John was getting his kit, as Sherlock peeled out of his coat, wincing when the movement stretched his flesh around the wound. He hissed as he peeled his shirt away from the wound, sticking to the coagulating blood.
“Yes, they are still there, waiting for parents to take them home.”
John was faced with disappointment when they were back in their flat. He was already on his way upstairs, quickly fleeing to retire to bed. Not only did he not want to talk about all of what had happened, but it had actually drained him. He was tired. But Sherlock never rested before his mind was at peace.
“No.” Mycroft said, the word staying in the air like a deep bemusement. “Where is your.. family?”
“I thought it ceased to be fair when she lied to you about practically her whole life.”
He took a deep breath and lead the younger man out through Mrs. Hudson's flat, into the small back yard. Saying their goodbyes at her grave, they climbed their way out, making as little noise as possible and, being who they were, one could have thought they were cats sneaking up on their prey.
“You can live in water, I cannot.” Sherlock argued, searching the other man for means to survive in the depth of the ocean. Indeed, he could faintly see two slits just behind John's jawbones, like those of a fish.
“No, I'm not!” Sherlock replied like it was a personal offence. He then took John's silence to let his eyes roam over the smaller man's body, analysing him for answers. He sighed when he understood. “John, I may be a narcissistic arsehole, but this is not a bad thing. You are doing nothing wrong.”
Sherlock chuckled, apparently having decided John was definitely playing a joke on him. “Alright, what are you then? Some sort of Frankenstein, exchanging your dying body parts? Because I have to tell you, for a human jigsaw puzzle, you look very well balanced.”
He trusted John. Had trusted him from their very first case together. The possible reaction to his scars was beyond trust, however and he was in awe seeing how John didn't care in the least to even mention it any further.
Inside the building, John handed Sherlock one of the knives – gunshots were loud and only to be fired when unavoidable, but the Met was rather empty, yet, and it would do to have Sherlock as a safety measure behind him.
Her footsteps, balancing herself on the stairs, were still audible when John went into the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea as well. Sherlock followed him, but not knowing what to do in this situation, he just stood awkwardly behind John. After a while, he decided to attempt to dissolve the tension by speaking out to “John-”, but the blond stopped him with a clipped “don't, Sherlock. Just.. say nothing.” and Sherlock, indeed, shut up.
not understand? I love you.”
“Of course we are. This is between Mary and me. It's nice to have you have my back, though, keeps me steady.” John nuzzled Sherlock's hair, smelling his mild shampoo.
Sherlock stopped his pacing around the living room, head turning to watch the TV screen, his eyebrows drawing together in, not scrutiny, but disbelief, the incapability of accepting such happenings.
“It's just losing my heart. It's a promise. A hope. I can't do it. And neither should you.” John sounded pained at first, but cold and hard like stone towards the end. He shuffled back, away from Sherlock.
John shook his head with a sigh. It was the same question each time. “Please, Mycroft, I'm just a simple doctor. I just want to live.”
“I'm just a bit dizzy.” John answered in a nasal voice.
When Sherlock woke him in the morning, John decided he'd teach Sherlock a move or two to safely operate the knife, discussing strategies and routines with him to work more efficiently together.
“What do you want from my brother?”
John should have guessed, that when he was going to tell Sherlock he was ready, that Sherlock would be busy analysing his own blood. John smiled.
“Oh... But how did you make me then?” Hamish questioned, pure and honest interest in his eyes.
“Why?”
is constantly with us.”
“Hamish, we're talking dozens of children here. We can't possibly take care of so many.”
“Well, you already know those aren't true. Also, we don't sleep in coffins. Well, most of us.”John added as an afterthought. “You know how people can be.”
“This decision is not mine to make, Sherlock. Not that I was ever able to reign in your rebellious mind.” Mycroft said with regret weighing down his words.
A delighted gasp came from Hamish before he answered. “Oui, papa! Je vais en recevoir un pour Noël?!”
His face lit up brightly. “You bought tickets for that play!”
“He hit me on the head, I couldn't really do much for a moment. It was a very precise hit.” Sherlock replied, calm as ever.
He liked John, adored him, loved him, if you'd ask a romantic, and, judging by all the information John more or less openly provided him, that sentiment did not run just one way, but there was a barrier he felt panicked to even touch with another human being. It was the same barrier that kept him from approaching the subject of romantic feelings with John.
Sherlock whispered the directions to him and John lead them safely through the city.
In the evening, when they were alone in their room, sorting themselves out, Sherlock raised concern over the group possibly just wanting to steal their food and be gone. John argued that even if they'd manage, they could still go back to Baker Street and collect the remaining cans, the ones they weren't able to fit in their bags. It would still be enough for quite a while.
“I assumed you'd come back then.”
“That wasn't my intention. I wanted to keep seeing you, but now you have shown we cannot just go without desiring each other.” There was a pause that sounded like John was trying to collect his strength. “This pains me greatly. However, I fear you are right: I must abandon you.”
! Do you want her to grow up with such a family setting?!”
John averted his eyes delicately. “When two people stand under a mistletoe, it's tradition they must kiss..”
“Well, then, cheers.” John finally dismissed, walking into the kitchen and putting their food on the table to get out of his shoes and jacket. The food loaded onto plates, John returned to the living room, where Sherlock was pouring them their glasses. Red wine and Chinese take-out; John smiled to himself. He raised his glass to Sherlock and they took their first sip together. As a couple.
“My treasure was so much richer.”
“Wrong question, John. With that wording you are subconsciously giving me the impression that it would be normal and expected of me to be okay with it, making me feel guilty, unnatural and unsuitable for you if I wished to say no and thereby forcing me to say yes.” Sherlock corrected, keeping his look straight forward, trying his best not to sound scolding.
He strapped the backpacks around his front and his back, telling Sherlock to take the clothes and food one. It was the lightest – as was Sherlock.
John grinned toothily. Sherlock had never seen anyone smile so brightly.
Sherlock frowned disapprovingly. “Then why are you still reading?!”
Sherlock brushed down his black and yellow striped shirt, frowning at the creases on it as he leaned against the wall, waiting for John to get his much more complicated costume on. When John did finally round the corner and presented himself to Sherlock, taking his painted wooden sword in hand, the taller man couldn't help but grin softly.
For the next few days, England's citizens were glued to news reports of all forms, hunting down all the information there was to get from the developments in Germany and then Austria, Swiss, Denmark, the Netherlands. It seemed to be spreading like some kind of virus despite the surrounding countries swearing to having had all borders closed. Maybe it actually was some sort of virus then? Something that got into their systems some time ago, waiting for days, weeks to spread through the body and make them into.. 'Zombies', they say, as if this was some fucking film!This was real- the
Sherlock took in the deep circles under the man's eyes and the wrinkles forming all across his face. “Well, I should hope my beauty has not left me when I reach your age in five years time.” he answered in an arrogant joke, closing his eyes.
Holmes' eyes flickered down to Watson's lips as if to suggest a better method of showing his gratitude. As if he could read minds, like he so often had accused Holmes of doing, he pressed his mouth gently against his partner's once again. “Now,” he whispered as he made a few inches space between them, “won't you join me on the chaise longue?”
“Dare I say you are getting used to it?”
“No, it's alright, uncle Mycroft and papa gave me some money for it!”
Sherlock frowned at him, sceptical, but said nothing more. “Do you work today?” he asked, acknowledging his coffee with a little nod as it was placed beside his hand and went back to working on his slides.
What happened? – Molly
like sex. As a common dater, he’d experienced a rather varied number of reasons for being kissed, some of which he’d never truly pinpointed. However, despite the number of reasons, he can’t say he’d ever been kissed for saying that he could climb stairs.
“Is answering that question really necessary to your feeble investigation, Mr. Holmes?”
[Text Coversation:
“What is a selfie?” the man blurted, then blinked as if he wasn’t quite sure where the question had come from. John stopped himself from laughing. If he had looked like an alien before, all sharp angles and single-minded concentration, he looked like a small, fumbling puppy now.
How could you possibly know any of that? – GL
“John doesn’t talk to his family,” Sherlock muttered. “He stopped talking to Harry on a regular basis after she walked out on her wife Clara, either for the divorce or for the drinking, I was never certain which, and his parents are rather pugnacious at best. I take from your facial expression that doesn’t particularly describe your family.”
“Quite well, Wa- Joan,” Sherlock replied, and she could swear she heard him bouncing on the balls of his feet. “The warden gave us a fair bit of information to work with. I shall inform you in full when I meet you at the station. How is my injured counterpart, and did you get information from him?”
I don’t even know what that means
He appears capable but unwilling. I don’t think I’m any more than a prop in the background to him at present. Mostly he appears simultaneously frustrated with the delay and exasperated with his ex for being overly solicitous.
“Do not joke, brother,” Mycroft warned. “I cannot provide any sort of assistance during your mission. If any of my men find you in areas under my control, they will shoot to kill. You are advised not to kill anyone except out of self-defense, or else my people may find reason to pursue you. I also recommend you avoid all of your previous … recreational activities. As tempting as they might be in your newfound freedom, they will be nothing if not detrimental to your cause.”
He had hoped that, one day, they might have felt comfortable expressing their own love for him. No secrets, no lies, no hidden emotions between them. He never expected sex, although he would have never turned it down, but he never deemed it necessary. John had Mary, and Mary had John, and neither needed him for that. The baby was proof enough of that.
Exhaustion causes typos, not stupidity, and I’m not sure you don’t want to talk to this bloke – GL
Dr. John H. Watson, formerly of RAMC, yes.

Wait, how did he compliment you? – GL
In any case, enjoy!
“No.”
“For fuck’s sake, Harry!” he exclaimed as he stepped into the tiny flat he’s been sharing with her. He dropped the groceries in the armchair by the door and rushed to kneel over his big sister, who was currently passed out in a pool of her own vomit. For the fifth time in the last two weeks. He checked her pulse and reactivity to make sure she was just smashed, and, shaking his head against his knotted stomach, he hauled her up. Stumbling slightly under the dead weight, he dragged her the three feet from the kitchen into her bedroom and deposited her on the bed with as much grace and gentleness as he could manage (that was, not much). “This can’t keep happening, Harry,” he sighed and kissed her forehead, fully aware that would have gotten him slapped if she were at all conscious and not really caring. Harriet Jane Watson may have been the eldest Watson, but John was the one who was always looking out for her, not the other way around. In fact, his earliest memory was cleaning up the milk his sister had spilled in her haste to go play with her friends so their parents wouldn’t yell at her. John was the one who Harry came out to first, sure, but John was also the one who took the fall three weeks later when a half-naked girl had been found in their house at night, even though she was Harry’s girlfriend, not John’s. Even now, almost all of John’s army pension was paying for the flat, even though Harry’s job could have easily paid for the whole thing.
Actually, he seemed more inclined toward acting as insolent as possible.
“Which is about as good a summary of my brother as you can get,” Sherlock nodded decisively, and John allowed himself another snort of laughter before slinging an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders. “What –?”
“Sherlock, I only arrived a few minutes ago,” she said.
“For God’s sake!” Lestrade exclaimed. “You and I have been working together for a little over five years, I’ve been dating your brother for almost half of that –” (“Don’t remind me,” Sherlock moaned, which Lestrade studiously ignored) “and my first name is on my desk as well as half of the IDs you keep lifting off of me! If you wanted to remember my first name, Sherlock, you bloody well would. But this John bloke spends less than an hour with you on the Tube, and suddenly you remember his name perfectly. I know far better than to believe that I fully know or even slightly understand you, Sherlock, but even I know how completely and utterly bizarre that is.” He took a breath and continued in a softer tone. “I don’t know who John is to you, Sherlock, but he sure as Hell isn’t nobody.”
“Are we done?” John asked abruptly, feeling his temper reach its tipping point.
“I just might,” Marissa replied with a small smile. “And should you find yourself in San Diego or in need of a wedding planner - either for an actual wedding or just a professional opinion - call me yourself.”
“In exchange for what?” John asked, even though he was pretty sure he knew.
Bloody AGRA.
“All the information we had at home on our Moriarty and a few extra cold cases Sherlock couldn’t solve.” (
“No, I’m not, just…not interested.”
“Aren’t you?” Big Brolly Brother asked with a pointed glance at John’s phone, that he hadn’t even realized was still in his hand.
Find someone else to be a source of entertainment. They’re back on the issue with his brother
“Nope,” Sherlock said, emphasizing the “p” sound. To be honest, he should be grateful for the flashback. It served as a none-too-gentle reminder that time was of the essence, just what he needed as motivation to face and out-banter his brother. “Not that I am not particularly sorry for it. If you would cut the pointless drivel and skip to the part where you point me in the right direction, perhaps I could finish this before I reach senility.”
He didn't have to wait long. Not for her gasp of shock and horror, not for the blinding pain from her collision of her hug, and not for the hardest blow of all, her greeting, screamed in his ear. His eyes locked onto Rose Tyler and his mind stuck on the Doctor.
She was just like John.

Sherlock saw red briefly at the insult to John, but calmed himself enough to say, “The information I’ve received tells me that Dr. Watson was instrumental to Sherlock Holmes.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do you normally take pictures with them?”
“An art?” Sherlock spat before thinking. “Deduction is not an
“No one’s ever complimented you on your bedside manner, have they?” he murmured, and the strange man-child stiffened. “So is this the reformed drug addict?”
“I found a man," she sighed. “Just an ordinary man, if a particularly well-crafted one, one with a somewhat sharper mind than most. However, I found myself infatuated with him, which obviously would not do for my plans, so I faked my death to drive him to what I believed to be a suicidal ending. Instead, he dived headfirst into an addiction that took him out of Britain and my sphere of influence.”
Oh, God, the baby! Sherlock’s eyes watered further, and he shook his head to clear them. How he wished more than anything he could have been that baby’s godfather. He loved that baby before Mary and John even knew they were having one. Now he would never even know what they were naming her. He hoped a bit foolishly that they did, in fact, name her Sherlock (or maybe Sherley). He wished he could have met her, seen her grow up, seen who she would become.
"Yes, Mum," Rose answered obediently, but John saw the glint in her eye and smiled at her. He turned to Harry, who seemed frozen and distant, and he laid a hand on her shoulder. She seemed to come to herself, and turned to face Rose.
“What do people normally say?”
Hes coming over here
“Good thing I didn’t know you then,” Watson muttered and Sherlock smiled.
Except, should he have? If it were not for the case with Magnussen, he would still be out there, ruling the world through his little game of pressure points and blackmail. If it were not for Magnussen, he would have let Janine fade away into distant corners of his Mind Palace when she’s proven herself a plausible ally. If it were not for him, John would have never found out about Mary.
I've been looking forward to posting this all week! It's been a shit week, so I'm glad I got to end it well. Please make it even better by leaving kudos, reviews, and love. They feed my heart and help me keep going through to a new week.

“Regardless. You will find the first link to Moriarty’s empire at a privately funded lab in Switzerland. You will find a car outside wishing to take a man by the name of Jeremy Patterson to the airport, where he is due to catch a commercial flight there. Files containing all pertinent information about both Jeremy Patterson and the lab you will need to invade will be located in a simple black briefcase in the back seat of the car. I will cease all surveillance and contact with you once you exit this door.”
One more chapter left when they finally get it together - I might push it back to an E rating then, but it will really depend on my muse. Keep tuned!
“Sorry, mate,” he said preemptively before the man had chosen his words. “My friends dared me to take a picture of you. I can delete it if you like.” The man fidgeted for a second, obviously surprised by John’s upfront apology and unsure of what to say in response.
It and e-mails are my primary system of communication with the outside world. Do you really believe I would not master it to the full extent of my ability?
He took the offered hand and shook it, grip firm and almost lingering. “I know you’ll know how rare it is for me to truthfully reply that the feeling is mutual, John.”
Sherlock considers the wisdom of taking the Magnussen case in retrospect and wonders what the other people in his life are doing.

(Warning: not beta'd or Britpricked. Sorry.)
“And exposed your worst secrets in the cruelest way possible,” Sherlock concluded, and she nodded, eyeing him curiously. He noticed and shrugged. “When I was younger, I believed airing and forgiving another’s grievances would inspire them to do the same with me. Unfortunately, that was usually the response I got. So I used them as a defense mechanism, to an even worse effect."
