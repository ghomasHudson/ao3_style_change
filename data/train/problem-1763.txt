Sighing, I climbed into my own bed. Sleep would not come to me, however. I thought of Watson’s face, the hurt and anger there. Jealousy was a tricky thing to manage. Clearly I had gone too far, but I was sure Watson would eventually apologise and agree to stay.
Though he’s staring at the screen, John’s not really watching. Instead, he seems inwardly focused, as if he’s chewing over some problem. His hands are clenched, a clear sign of tension. His lips are pressed in a thin line, like he’s holding something inside— anger?
The Mitch Hedberg joke: "I saw this wino, he was eating grapes. I was like, 'Dude, you have to wait.'"
Sherlock has no idea how to respond to all this information. As he looks back at his own behaviour, he can see that he was polite but cool, maybe even distant. Reserve is his natural armour, and he didn’t let it down the entire evening. He winces now, thinking of the chilly goodbye on the kerb.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but had to admit that Brook’s dramatic over-acting would probably work fine with an audience of kids. It was beyond cringe, approaching satire, but their fans, who were now parents, might catch the humour. The show had always teetered between silliness and sentiment. He could live with it.
Charles eyed me, looking for a fault he could ridicule. I had many faults, but he was not a clever boy; if he had been, he might have found ways to exploit them.
of January, 2010, he would make the same choices. He would ask to borrow the phone, invite him to move in, and he would silently love him.
“My advice to you is this: give up the writing. It will bring you neither prestige nor prosperity. Writing is a vulgar profession filled with pandering scribblers. My elder son tells me that you are studying medicine, a tolerably respectable career for a man of your background. You must set yourself up in practice as soon as you are able. Marry a woman of good reputation and moderate fortune. With that face, you will have no shortage of candidates. But do not be deceived. A woman’s loveliness is a distraction, as it will inevitably fade. If she spends her time eating pastries and reading novels, she will soon lose both her figure and her complexion. Wit can be a distractor as well; a sharp tongue will quickly become a source of vexation. Choose wisely. The wife of a doctor must be clever enough to make ends meet on an income that will certainly be inadequate, once she begins to produce children. Do not marry a woman who will spend your salary on hats and dresses and gloves. She must be hard-working, not flirtatious, and resourceful, not vain. A woman who thinks herself finer than she is will become a shrew. I recommend that you have no more than three children, two boys and a girl. More than three will tax your resources. The boys may follow you into medicine, or law, perhaps. The girl, if she is as pretty as her father, may marry above her class.”
When he wakes, he’s in hospital, wrapped in bandages. He feels like he’s been set on fire and thrown against a wall. Burns from the explosion, naturally, and a few broken bones from landing after a short flight through the air. His head is intact; he remembers perfectly the moment of the explosion, but nothing after.
Once the inspector was gone, Holmes chuckled. “You have a great gift of silence, Watson. I had expected to you give the game away before I had my tale told.”
“You think I’m ambitious.” She set down her fork. “While there’s nothing wrong with ambition, you fail to see
This was the moment when I understood myself. Most people do not see ghosts, though many believe in them. I was different. How I came by this talent, I do not know. Perhaps meeting John had opened a part of my mind that in other people remained shut. I had been given a fearsome gift. What it meant, or how I might use it, I did not know.
Sherlock, though clearly not a cat person, allows Lu to rub against him, leaving hair on his trousers. Tiger follows Molly into the kitchen, sits watching as she puts the kettle on and drops teabags in two mugs. She shakes out more dry food for the cats, takes a packet of biscuits from the cupboard. Sherlock stands in the doorway, watching her.
The boxes are on the landing, waiting for John. As long as they are out there, Sherlock can’t do anything, not even make a cup of tea.
He didn’t know how to answer this. While he’d prefer to simply be who he was without announcements or media speculation, he also preferred it when people left him alone. And Mike had warned him that being an openly gay actor might mean being reduced to gay parts. He’d liked doing the cop show, but still hoped for better movie roles. For that, he’d have to keep his mouth shut, not only about his sexual preferences, but about scripts, directors, his fellow actors, and just about everything that was important to him.
“No. Things have changed. Maybe once I could have said that to him, but I’ve changed. He’s changed, too, I suppose. It’s too late.”
When they pull away, they stand, foreheads pressed together. Sherlock keeps his eyes closed, staying in the moment, committing it to a place in his Mind Palace where he will go when he needs a reminder.
It occurs to Watson that Wilkes might have delegated someone to walk them to their room, but would rather make sure Holmes doesn’t talk to anyone. He doesn’t usually leap to conclusions about things like this, but Wilkes is making him uneasy. He notes the way Holmes is looking at him, too. He’s trying to cover something up; and he’ll try to get rid of them as soon as he’s managed whatever situation is occupying Dr Huxtable.
I began to work with Mr Lestrade of Scotland Yard after I was confronted by a very persistent ghost, impatient that his murder hadn’t been solved. He showed me his own murder scene, relating in a hollow voice how he’d been assaulted. Most ghosts are silent spectres, watching and perhaps feeling regret for things unsaid, but an angry ghost finds ways to communicate, if one has the ability to hear. Just as John had shown me his death scene, this unfortunate was able to let me see his murder through his eyes.
There are too many choices here; Rosie could be anywhere in the city. She could have hopped on a train and be on her way to somewhere, anywhere. John has no idea what she would do, where she would go. He can’t solve this puzzle.
He hated himself for wanting to know. It would do him no good to know, even if it was more than just a rumour. Irene seemed to have connections. “Fine. Tell me.”
“Right,” said Watson, looking a bit mischievous. “After the play, we walked a bit, looking for a cab. I have not the ability to summon cabs effortlessly, as you do. One day, you must show me how it’s done. At any rate,” he continued, viewing my growing irritation with amusement, “we discussed a possible alliance.”
“Miss Ashton-Farbridge,” I began. “Perhaps the idea of an arranged match is disagreeable to you, as it seems to lack the romantic quality we have come to expect in marriage. You must concede, however, that in matrimony there are things more important than romance. As individuals, you and I are obviously compatible. Though my intelligence is superior, I enjoy your company, and you clearly have much to gain from a marriage with me. Let us not waste time on pointless flirtation. I wish to marry you. Our parents are counting on it, and letting more time go by before we make our plans will not change the fact that this marriage benefits us all. I see every sign of success in our union. You will produce children before you are too old to do so, and I am sure you will raise them to be fine people.” I took the ring box from my pocket, opened it, and set it before her. “This was my mother’s ring. The setting is old, but the diamond has appreciated in value. It could be reset, if you wish. Or perhaps you wish to choose your own ring. I am amenable to either of these ideas.”
“In truth, you don’t,” she replied, softening a bit. “Like prodigal sons, though, you keep coming back.”
He’d known that morning that he needed to move on, to leave what had happened in the past and live his life. And there she was.
“Of course.” Shaking his head, he sighed. “Anything is better than seeing you moon about, waiting for word from your boy. You’re both idiots, but I will not have my life made intolerable by idiocy. This is my last offer of help. When he arrives, it’s up to you to deal with whatever trouble he’s gotten himself into.” He gave a derisive snort. “The two of you deserve one another. After helping you pretend to be dead for three years, sending money to the ends of the earth to keep you alive, I might as well bring your Watson home so the two of you can be fools together. And Mummy would never forgive me if you pine away to nothing. I’ve written the ticket information there, on the envelope, so you can arrange to greet him when he arrives.”
No one is paying any attention to me here, even though I’m rather conspicuous in my pyjamas and dressing gown, my feet bare. I must look like an escaped mental patient. Nobody looks at me.
“She said that she plans to make an announcement,” Mycroft replied. “She is getting up in years, you know. It may be that she wishes to let us know her intentions.”
But he has never been in a romantic relationship before, and though he’s always considered himself superior to people who let sentiment rule their brains, he is uncertain how to do this, afraid of ruining everything.
And then, as my eyes strained to see him, he was there, dressed in an old jacket and a slouch hat. He’d grown a beard, and his hair was longer than I’d ever seen it. Over one shoulder he carried a traveling bag. A cane in his other hand, he walked with a limp, worse than when we first met. Thin as a lath and brown as a nut, his hair sun-bleached. After so many years of imagining him, here he was, wounded but alive.
Mycroft texts me. They’re somewhere in Germany, a military hospital. He gives me no details, merely says that Sherlock is recovering. This is almost more maddening that knowing nothing at all.
“Fanfiction.” She smiled at Sherlock. “Fans of the show writing their own stories, posting them on sites where other people read and comment. There are literally thousands of stories shared this way.”
He raises his hands, a surrender. “Can’t afford to do that. And even if I had, there’s nothing I could tell you.”
“Yes! Your notes are excellent. A few spelling errors, but nothing embarrassing. On the other hand, the stories you write for
Well, it wasn’t an alien, Mike had clarified; he would be playing a genetically-engineered superhuman. For all purposes, an evil alien. Villains could be fun to play if they weren’t caricatures, so he didn’t object on those grounds. But why was it that whenever anyone had an alien part to cast, people still thought of Sherlock Holmes?
John puts his arms around him. “Look, I just want to be with you tonight, not think about all of that. Let’s turn on some crap telly and eat the food. After that…” He smiles up at Sherlock. “If you’re in the mood…”
“John.” He sounds like he’s pleading, like he’s asking for everything and has nothing to give in return. “John.”
We spend the day in 221B and your phone keeps buzzing. You refuse to answer, and I finally pick it up and see:
A week later, at another crime scene, Donovan made a joke, suggesting that they were sleeping together.
A doctor came; I refused the medicine he urged on me. There was nothing to be done, and the pain would soon be over. I slept, I woke. I waited.
“Oh, pooh. You’re a man who runs after criminals without a second thought, and you’re not brave enough to risk another date? Ask him.”
He smiles. It was pretty awesome, being a person who can do things like that in front of a room of strangers.
. Though my fingernails were often packed with dirt from my habit of hunting for animal skeletons, Bessie regularly attacked my hands with soap and a stiff brush. As for
“I hope you won’t…” Chewing his lip, Matt looks down into his empty cup. “I know that what happened to you was traumatic, and you’ll need time to work through it. I’m not trying to push, but I hope you’ll come back again, some Wednesday when you’re ready.”
“You see them,” she said. “I can tell that you have the same power I have. But these ghosts put no money in my purse, and money is more useful to me than the dead. You may one day write a book on this and make a name for yourself. For me, I only hope to make a living.”
John has grown used to the highs and lows, but some days it would be nice if there were a note, just a small hint as to what he ought to do about dinner. They don’t have an organised plan for who cooks on what nights. Sometimes they cook together; sometimes John cooks. And every now and then, Sherlock creates something amazing.
They’ve placed their order and Sherlock is thinking of a story that will make John laugh, and John is smiling at him as if he has never wanted to be anywhere else, with anyone else. It’s perfect.
Sometimes I think all that was just an experiment. You know he loved pushing the limits.” He sighs deeply and shakes his head. “I guess it’s hard to know what’s going on in a person’s head. Especially Sherlock’s.”
Sherlock wants to impress him, he decides. Maybe just likes to show off, or maybe he doesn’t get much affirmation from the Yard. “You like what you do, and you’re good at it— good enough that Scotland Yard lets you help. Where are we going?”
“But he wasn’t suicidal, was he? Parents are supposed to die. It was hard on him because he felt guilty, and he felt guilty because he felt relieved. She was abusive, in my opinion. He was secretly glad she was gone. And he has no other family, besides his older sister.”
“Your disguise was perfect,” he said. “Even I would not have known you with the white wig and whiskers. And the accent—”
So. Holmes would swirl in again. He’d deduce that this was Watson’s seventh scotch, not his sixth. Something about the size of his pupils or the shakiness of his hand as he raises the glass to his mouth.
for Sherlock. He auditioned, and no one else was even considered for the role. It was a new television series about a Scotland Yard police inspector who begins working with a young genius to solve crimes. When he found out who was playing the inspector, he understood why he’d gotten a break. Greg Lestrade, who had played the young science teacher in
Greg is still waiting for him to finish his thought. He smiles. “Look, John, Sherlock isn’t the easiest person to get on with. He’s not had a lot of experience with people— in any kind of relationship. I’m sure there will be ups and downs. Under all that moodiness and lack of social know-how, though, he’s a good person. I don’t know you well, but I think you’re patient. You took him by surprise. Give him time to settle into things.”
He chuckled. “Twenty years since you retired. It must have been a difficult one. But you sound well.”
“I’m not expecting Shakespeare.” He huffed and lowered his head. “How can she think that Diarrhoea Dude could play John Watson’s part? Fans won’t accept it.”
He crushed his empty cup and tossed it in the bin. “You? I don’t think so. If I’ve achieved things, it’s because I have talent and I’ve worked for them, not because I’m privileged. I earned the breaks I got.”
And then there’s this: what if I take the pill, and nothing happens? What if the last two times were flukes? The first time I was grieving, barely alive. The second time I was sick. In weakened states, the mind can play tricks, convince you of things that aren’t real.
From a distance, it all looks different. Harry had tried, several times, to quit drinking. This latest might be as doomed as the other attempts, but at least she recognises that she has a problem and is trying to do something about it. The last time, right before he’d shipped out, she’d asked him to have a little faith in her.
John seems to realise that introductions are expected. “This is my flatmate, Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock, this is Mary, my w— my ex-wife.”
Sherlock forgot his lines completely. He moved his jaw up and down, but nothing came out. Around the periphery of his vision, he could see his cast-mates grinning at him.
Endlessly patient, she says nothing. Sometimes he wishes she would sigh or roll her eyes or just call bullshit on whatever he’s saying.
Watson’s face was red with embarrassment and resentment. He stood, picked up the jacket from where it had fallen and lay it on the chair. Crossing his arms, he huffed an exasperated breath. “What exactly do you expect of me?”
He’d imagined a future with her, and that was what kept him alive some days. It wasn’t a perfect marriage, but at least he had a family to return to, a wife and daughter. That brutally snatched away, he quickly succumbed to infection. He survived the bullet, and the letter almost killed him. He doesn’t know now why he loved her, or even if he did. She replaced him. She didn’t love him.
is an expression which might be true for the first twenty-four hours of life, but Watson grew up in a neighbourhood where the women were always pregnant and the infants always howling. This is the truth: once a new parent falls into a habit of bragging about their unbroken sleep, it will end. Somewhere in his brain is stored information about newborns and colic, but he’s fortunately never had to use it. It belongs to the category
“As I said, a secret society.” Sherlock blows on his tea. “All the boys we’ve talked to confirmed it.” He takes a sip.
. Mates generally have wives, which they will always choose over you because wives provide sex. Mates will stand you up every time, on any pretext.
It’s after midnight, and the nightly horror show has been going on for hours. It happens every night when I close my eyes and try to sleep. You on the roof, talking to me, casting your phone aside and tipping off the edge, falling…
When I wake up tomorrow, I’ll start looking for a new flat. I’ll pack my things and move somewhere else, where everything won’t remind me that I lost you. That I should have told you.
“If you think he’d be open to it, maybe Sherlock could come to one of our sessions. It might be something he’s willing to work on.”
He was a good mimic, though, and used this to his advantage. This was how he’d learned to deal with people, to pretend he didn’t care. He did this until he’d forgotten that he did actually care.
not read it. It is our book, and he owns nothing in this house but what he brought with him. He has no money, and he is merely a beggar in this house.”
I still lacked the scientific proof I sought. None of the ghosts I had met could explain to me what death was. Most were non-verbal, and the few who could verbalise, like John, seemed interested only in life. Some believed they were still alive, which complicated their ephemeral existence, as well as the lives of the people they haunted. But in the laboratory, I found no proof of death as anything other than the cessation of processes that we call life. Defining something by what it is
“Exactly.” I take another swallow of beer. “Another thing. There was too much blood. I’ve seen people shot in the head. So have you. Blood, yes. But not a pool of blood.”
must climb?” Watson hissed. “Holmes, you’re talking to an invalid. My shoulder has not yet regained its previous range of motion, and my leg—”
Overwhelmed, he stared at the tiny drawing of the two of them hugging. “I knew you could draw, but I had no idea you liked puns so much,” he said. “Thank you. You put a lot of thought into this. I love it.” His throat clenched a bit as he said this, strangling his words.
“It was an extremely tasteful kiss,” John said. He leaned over and kissed Sherlock. The audience clapped and cheered.
“I couldn’t deduce it,” says Holmes in a puzzled voice, as if he can hardly believe what he is admitting. “So much else is obvious— the wound in your shoulder that’s ended your surgical career, the psychosomatic limp—“
“Never.” I yawned. “I am a man of habit, as you know, and you’ve become one of them. I do not easily alter my ways.”
The bell rang downstairs, loudly and insistently. We heard Mrs Hudson opening the door and speaking to our client (loud, imperious, German accent) then his feet mounting the stairs.
She sits back a bit. “One year, one day, one act does not define you. Think about that. One cruel remark doesn’t need to be proved or disproved. You are allowed to try different things, accept them or reject them. You’re allowed to define yourself.”
“He’s dead,” Sherlock said, silencing everyone. “John Watson is dead.” He strode towards the door. “Now, if you’ll excuse me.”
It was unfair, he suddenly realises, that she always had to take care of him when they were kids. Neither of them had a carefree childhood, but Harry, six years older, was given responsibility for him when Mum went to work. After Mum ran off with the cousin, Harry was the one who cooked and cleaned and kept John out of trouble. He’s always felt that he was deprived of something, but never really thought how Mum’s absence must have affected Harry. No wonder she left as soon as he could make his own meals and do the laundry. It wasn’t selfish, as he used to think. It was self-preservation.
I clapped a hand on Watson’s shoulder and smiled at the Bellamys and Mr Allen. “We should be taking our seats now.”
A girl with pink hair is standing at Sherlock’s door, looking annoyed. He studies her, evaluating what it means.
It was both hilarious and strange. Neither of them would back down, admit it was all a joke. It had gone on so long, and they had both been such good liars, that it seemed inevitable that it was going to happen. They were actually getting married.
He’d never taken a holiday, never just gone off somewhere for a bit of alone time. Before, the idea had never appealed to him. He’d always been alone, so what was the point? Now, however, a holiday sounded like something he’d like. He’d ask John where they should go. Maybe Greece. An island without a lot of tourists, if such a thing existed. Just as he was settling into a happy dream, the two of them drifting in a boat on an azure sea, John suntanned and relaxed, the hot water began to turn cold.
So why hasn’t he driven him away yet? Any sane person wouldn’t put up with Sherlock’s clutter, his moods, and his experiments.
His inner editor corrects that thought. It can’t be retrospect; they’re still on the bloody train, traveling to the school he vowed never to visit again. It’s a bad idea, even without retrospect.
He gave me an appraising look. “You’re improving, but still look a bit of a toff.” Coming to me, he removed my cap, ruffled my hair, and pulled a curl down over my forehead. “There. Now you’re a credible rogue. I assume that’s what you’re aiming at. What is your trade?”
He’s looking at Sherlock now, his mouth quirking into a smile. When Sherlock doesn’t reply, the smile disappears. “Sorry, I was only trying to help.”
“I would have told him,” he says softly. “Maybe it wouldn’t have mattered, but I would have said it.” He smiles ruefully. “I mean, after I picked myself up off the floor.”
He notes that Matt’s eyes automatically go to his cane. He and Christopher look at each other, exchanging some message that John thinks he can read. Pity is what he usually sees on people’s faces when they note his cane, quickly replaced by a bland smile.
“I’ve been thinking about coming out,” he said. “Mike says no one will be surprised, so there’s that. No, I’m not angry. I hate people being all up in my private life, but that’s the price of being successful in this business. And when being with you is the reward…” He felt his face grow hot.
Sherlock shakes his head. “I can’t. He’s everything good in my life, and I will carry him with me. I’m doing this for him, remember, so he will live.”
hanging there, like a question. I wait. He licks his lips and continues. “But I was also right. It would have put you in danger, and if you had died…” Biting his lip, he looks steadily at his hands. “I thought you’d be angry with me. When you realised what I’d done.”
The man working the cash register smiles at him. He’s maybe twenty-seven, twenty-eight, about as tall as John, but more sparely built. His long hair is pulled into a silly little top-knot, probably required by food service regulations. He has dark eyes and a quick smile. Probably a student of some kind, working here part-time. His name tag says
He did not stay at home, though. He had a commission in the navy and was about to ship out. After a fortnight he was gone. I received a letter from him when I turned five.
Seeing what I was doing, Watson came beside me pulled on my shoulder. “There’s no time. We must go!”
“Right. Any help you can give us… well, I’d appreciate it.” He stands up from Watson’s chair, sets down his tea, and looks at the urn. “He was a good man. I know you miss him, Sherlock.”
My uncle was dead by this time, and I had not heard from my aunt or any of my cousins since leaving Greenwood. My brother was irritable and impatient, considering the time I’d spent at Milford a waste of my talents. I did not think of those years as wasted, however, since I had made many useful observations, and had learned to play the violin as well. Loneliness might have been my lot, but I had learned that there are worse things than feeling alone in the world.
“I’m an army doctor, trained to look at horrible injuries. And I’ve worked with the most observant man in the world for the last year and a half. I know what I saw.”
This was the sentence that most disturbed me. I only hoped that the ticket had found its way to his hands and that he was on board now, sailing home to me.
He drops his arms to his sides. “No. I was twelve, thirteen. Before we met. It was… a lot of things. I’m not normal. I don’t think the way normal people think, act the way they act. Kids are cruel, they pick up on that, don’t let you forget you’re a freak.”
“No, he’s not. What I mean is, nobody cares what he is. He plays eccentric parts, intellectual parts. He chooses what he wants to do and can take his agent’s advice or not. If he were gay, it wouldn’t matter. He gets interesting offers, and takes the ones he wants. That could be you, in a few years, if you don’t make everything about this. Right now, coming out might hurt your career. You won’t be the brilliant detective on the telly; you’ll be the gay detective. So build your career for now. Don’t go after trouble.”
Well, no, he shouldn’t be thinking that. “I mean, I didn’t think I would be a target for anything like that.”
She waits. I close my eyes, holding myself in check. When did I last cry? I remember the funeral. Did I cry? I don’t remember. People must have said things to me because that’s what people do at funerals. Empty, meaningless things. But there wasn’t anything to say. Not really. Not then, not now.
That’s simply who Sherlock is. The unpredictability of life with him is stimulating, but it has a darker side. Right now, for instance, John isn’t sure whether Sherlock has decided to do something about the milk situation, in which case he’ll be back in a bit with carton of half-skim and several packets of biscuits. Or maybe he’s gone over to Barts to get something from Molly which he will put in the refrigerator when he gets home and hope that John doesn’t notice. Or he may have rushed off after a suspect and is now lying in an alley bleeding to death.
He needs to know what to do. His gift is not solving puzzles, it’s triage, seeing the options and making a choice. Shooting an enemy, saving a friend.
I imagine what happens after that kiss, too. Is it creepy to fantasise about my dead flatmate? Probably, but I’m already in deep territory here, imagining he’s not dead. It isn’t about sex, though I suppose my body has needs that I’ve ignored far too long. It’s the intimacy, and it’s the regret.
Jay looks at him mildly, no judgment in his expression. “It’s natural that you’re still working out how to be in a relationship with another man after years of presenting yourself as straight. It sounds like you’re working on it, though.”
“You are a doctor!” said Miss Chadwick. “Poetry is charming, but medicine is…” she paused, thinking of the word, “Medicine is
John kisses him. Not a light press of the lips, but a real kiss, his tongue parting Sherlock’s lips. For a moment it’s like falling. Then it’s like drowning. And finally, it’s like coming back to life. His body lights up, drawing electricity from John, his conductor of light.
. John was important, and he hadn’t figured that out yet. It’s hard to remember what it was like before John shot the cabbie and stood behind the police tape, looking inconspicuous. He can’t even remember the Sherlock that got up that morning and didn’t think about cleaning up the mess for his new flatmate, who was meeting him later on. What was that Sherlock thinking? Did he have breakfast that day? Did he take a shower? Did Mrs Hudson bring the mail up and twitter at him about nonsense? Did he ignore her?
Instead, I imagine that I didn’t leave, that I stayed with you. I’d have been there when the building across the street blew up. Gas leak, they said. But it wasn’t. I can imagine the shock of waking up to a bomb going off, the two of us out of our beds, running into the sitting room, checking to see if we’re all right. Even you must have been panicked when that happened. Maybe we would have grabbed each other—
He has scars, too. The horrific starburst on his shoulder is the only one people ever notice, but there are others, too, remnants of a childhood unsupervised, repeated trips to the Emergency Department to be stitched up. And that doesn’t even begin to describe the scars on the inside, where no one can see.
Sighing, John returned to his computer. “Look, Sherlock, you don’t have to pretend you have amnesia just because you forgot the milk. Not like it’s the first time.”
Thank you, dear readers, for all your wonderful comments! I've so enjoyed sharing this story with you.
“I’m good at detecting things,” she said. “I found out that John is my dad all by myself. My mum didn’t want me to know until I’m eighteen. She hid the file, but I found it.”
One day while Mr Anders was reading us a Psalm, Victor’s slate slipped through his hands and broke on the floor. The teacher was on him at once, hauling him by his collar and standing him on a chair as I had once stood. He chastised him in front of all the boys for being careless and wasteful.
I had not yet found what I was looking for, though, and was willing to risk another moment of light. Just as I laid my hand upon a packet and read the name
His wife is writing books about him, and his daughter is fourteen, angry at the world. He’s not fine.” She shakes her head again. “Are you upset because he’s not paying attention exclusively to you? Here’s the truth, Sherlock. No matter how much you love a person, it’s not all about you.”
“I was a mother at twenty-five. Producing children is a risky business; it’s best you get started soon. Besides, your trust has been set up to provide you the financial stability necessary to raise a family. There is no reason to put off your duty. I do not wish to wait for grandchildren until I am too old to make sure they are brought up correctly.”
John’s mouth is open. His chin wags up and down a few times, and after a full minute, he speaks. “You’re asking me to move out?”
He allows himself to mourn, playing back the night he saw John limping across the restaurant, his obvious pain and embarrassment. And his own feelings, his heart stirring with something he barely recognised. The second meeting, the crime scene, the chase— and how John’s demeanour had completely changed in those few hours. He remembers the man he saw standing behind the police tape, unnoticed by any of the officers or onlookers. So unassuming, but in that moment Sherlock saw him for who he was: a small man with a complex morality and more intelligence than anyone gave him credit for— and there was something else, something indefinable and rare. Sherlock didn’t even know what to call it. So many contradictions: a soldier who kills, a doctor who heals; a gentle, angry, patient, restless, cautious, dangerous man. John Watson was fascinating.
My brother had died by then. At his funeral, I saw him in his navy uniform, stooping down to say goodbye, promising to write to me. The one regret he had about his life might have been me. I told him that I would miss him, but that he should go where he needed to go now. His wife never complained that he haunted her.
“I never stopped caring about you and your mum, and I didn’t leave because of anything you’d done. Maybe it was selfish, but I’d dreamed about it since I was your age, and I thought it was something I could do for a few years, get it out of my system. Then I was wounded, and I lost everything— I couldn’t be a surgeon, couldn’t be a soldier, and I was losing you as well.”
Shoving me aside, he opened the curtains and grabbed the book. “And who pays Miss Garvey to teach us? My father does. He paid for this book.”
Without thinking about it, I raise the covers and slide in beside him. It’s something I’ve dreamed about, a dream too late to realise, but I’m not about to question the reality of this. It feels real: Sherlock’s cold hands on me, his bony knees poking into my thigh, his shallow breaths ghosting across my face.
“You’re not lying,” Sherlock said. “But you’re not telling the whole truth. Don’t worry, I’m not going to push you for an answer. But you need to know that your friends— Mike and Molly and Greg, and even Phil and Sally— have mourned you for years. It was a cruel thing to do to people who cared about you.”
He hasn’t known many people possessing the power to unnerve him. Sherlock Holmes is the egregious exception. Bullies have never bothered John. While he’s more comfortable answering a challenge with his fists, he has learned to raise his chin and quietly give a look that needs no clarification. Even if he can’t let go of an insult, he’s learned to ignore when he has to. He reminds himself that most bullies are insecure people, hiding their own lack of confidence under taunts that don’t sting. Acknowledging them only gives them more power.
John walked in while I was explaining what a hoax is. He did not look pleased when I introduced him to his daughters.
Before I reached the grove I could see the destruction. I picked up my pace, running the final distance, to find that many trees had been felled and digging begun for the foundation of the greenhouse. Work had obviously halted, and I saw why. Parts of unmarked graves had been dug up. A few bones even lay in the open. I assumed that the workers, being superstitious about such things, had refused to continue until the graves could be moved. I did not blame them.
John sighs and sinks down on the sofa beside him. “No, I’m sorry. You do have a right to ask, and I should have told you before.”
Mrs Hudson is out at the shops, otherwise he wouldn’t have opened the door at all, but he’s hoping John has read his rather desperate message and will come home. He flushes, realising that he’s not exactly dressed for visitors,
In the pilot episode, he evades the cop, who’s seen the strange flashy lights and come to investigate. He takes shelter in a shed behind a small house belonging to an elderly woman living on the outskirts of town with her grandson, an average kid named Jason. Predictably Jason is twelve and rides a bike to school each day, which he keeps in the shed. Thus, they meet and converse, Alex having somehow learned English during his night in the shed. Nobody even tried to explain that.
I knew where I was going, more or less. I didn’t run through the days heedless, as so many people do. I moved slowly now, every moment aware that death was approaching. I wasn’t afraid or anxious. My life had been long, and death was merely a new place to visit, a place where John waited for me.
But it didn’t matter what I believed because I was a child, and was not given a choice. The next events of my life would not be at Greenwood Hall, but at Mr Grimshaw’s school, Milford.
But even in my dream, I finally understand that it’s real and nothing can fix what’s happened. I’m a doctor; I reach for your wrist. I see the blood pooling around you, see your precious head broken—
Mrs Hudson is back from the shops by now and goes to open the door. He hears her talking, a man replying.
People resist change, but that doesn’t stop it from happening. For so many years, he’s tried to be the person he became after Victor rejected him, the one who despised sentiment and thought alone protected him. He doesn’t miss that person. He looks forward to who he will become now, open to loving John, willing to risk hurt. Love is bound to be a bit risky; otherwise it wouldn’t be worth anything.
"Yeah, I've been thinking about those beehives. A cottage somewhere, with beehives and flowers. Imagining you in a beekeeper's kit, lovingly tending them." He sighs. "I know that you have many passions, Sherlock. I only want to be one of them, if that's possible. I'm not completely useless. I can make the tea, tend the garden while you do your thing with the bees. Well, that's a long way off. For now, I only want to be here. Not only in 221B, but wherever you are. I want to hear you play the violin, even if it's after midnight. I want to follow you to crime scenes, and write up your cases. I want to sit with you after dinner, comfortably quiet and at ease, in the way one can only be at ease with someone loved. I want... If you want, I mean... I'd like to be there someday. With you.”
“Yes, the news covered all that. What do you think, that he found a body double and killed him in the forest, and now is living somewhere under an assumed identity?”
He imagines what Watson would say about it. He has entire conversations in his head with Watson, but it’s not the same.
Sherlock sighs. “I’m not sure what my next move would have been if you hadn’t shown up here with all your stuff and started talking to the skull. I thought about having you evicted from your awful flat, but I was afraid you’d wander around the streets, pitiful and homeless. It’s a mystery how you can take down a serial killer with your skull and still not know how to manage your life. You’re an enigma.”
They arrive at the gym. Sherlock kneels beside John as he examines the body, still unidentified, no obvious cause of death. A male in his thirties, scruffy beard, thin, dressed in old jeans, a ratty shirt, and a hoodie. Obviously not a patron of the gym. John thinks he was probably dead when rolled up in the mat, or nearly so. Initially, it doesn’t look like asphyxiation; he may have died of an overdose, possibly cocaine. This doesn’t answer how he managed to get himself rolled up in a mat.
“What I’ve learned,” Moriarty says, “would take a lifetime to explain. But we’ve got all the time in the world, haven’t we? The two of us.” He gestures at Watson. “And this one, again. Really, Holmes. Immortality does not equate to intelligence.”
like somebody else, not your usual stroppy self. You remember how to cooperate with people, don’t you? Yeah, you do. I don’t understand why you have to be a prick about everything, tell them why their movie is stupid and poorly written. And you make demands— Sherlock, you’re not well-known enough to make demands of big-name producers. You’re just an actor who’s had moderate success in two series, only one of which is widely watched in the States, and done well in a couple movies no one has seen. You can’t afford to be a prima donna.”
The man who sits beside John for hours, waiting for him to wake up, is not that Sherlock. Something has changed in the past months, since John moved in. He would die for the man he’d found unconscious and bleeding in that alley.
“First of all, how would Alex know that Jason is missing? The alien has shape-shifted and everyone believes he is Jason, so what is it that brings Alex back to Earth?”
Sherlock had seen it himself. He’d deduced it that second night, standing in the car park at Roland-Kerr, describing the shooter to Lestrade:
The monk was opposed to the idea of killing; he told Holmes that he must continue on, never stop seeking enlightenment.
I regarded him silently, not surprised at his stubbornness, but forming another plan. I had no intention of letting him sacrifice himself. Forcing my face into a look of resignation, I sighed as if conceding defeat. “Very well. We will continue together. Tomorrow we will see the falls.”
“Of course. I haven’t seen her in weeks, but I want to do my part. I thought maybe we could work out some sort of schedule. What’s going on with her?”
Sometimes I dream, even without Mike’s herbal remedy. Usually they’re like normal dreams, where I don’t remember much. But sometimes it’s almost like those other dreams. I’m in a depressing hotel or an abandoned warehouse, somewhere in Eastern Europe, and he’s there, cold, hurt, ill, depressed. I comfort him. We talk of better days, and I hold him, reminding him that he’s coming home soon.
, Sherlock thinks. “Almost romantic,” he says. “Did I say that out loud?” He pops a grape into his mouth.
Knowing that I’m not even remotely perfect, I pulled him close and kissed his ear. “Perfection is boring,” I whispered.
I waved a hand carelessly. “Then I assume you’ll think of something to send to Mr Munson and his lovely bride.”
I do not generally waste time on self-analysis, but as I listened to the music, I tried to define what I was feeling. There was regret, for things done and not done. It was not possible for me to say what I would have done differently, given what I was at the time— a naive and reserved young man, brighter than my peers, but with no intimates. My father did not understand me; he had never expressed any interest in what I should do with my life. My brother, more socially adept than I, had tried to guide me. Feeling poles apart from what other young men seemed to find interesting, I’d resisted advice. I had no affinity for women. This I knew when I went to Cambridge, though I did not yet know not what it meant.
They must have all laughed then, but John only remembers that the buzzing in his ears grew louder. The teacher entered the room then and everyone stood. John stumbled to his feet, feeling a pair of sharp grey eyes trained on him.
By the time I returned with the violin, she had interrogated him about what books he read, whether he smoked tobacco (disgusting habit), and where he had purchased the suit he was wearing. She was advising him to seek a tailor who would not make him look like one of those young men who make a dubious income dancing with elderly ladies at seaside resorts. He was politely smiling and thanking her for her advice, clearly grateful that his part of the conversation consisted mainly of one-word replies.
Watson: Never fear, my dear. Marriage between men is not yet legal. We shall have to make do, living in sin.
Holmes shrugs and says nothing, but continues walking beside him. At the door of his building, John stops and turns to really look at him. He thinks about Sherlock pretending he’s Freddy Mercury, swishing his hips and singing
“Oh. Whatever the chef recommends.” He says this quickly, trying to look like he knows what he’s doing.
I frowned. “You said you forgave me. I assume that there are no unresolved issues preventing our continuing partnership.”
“I’m sorry, but we don’t give out phone numbers or addresses for drivers. If you give the note to us, we can pass it on.”
“Sherlock, please.” Stamford put down his pastry. “This is morbid. We all felt terrible when it happened. I understand why this is on your mind now, with the reunion episode under consideration. You and he didn’t get along well, so maybe it’s guilt. I don’t know. I’m not a psychologist. But it’s morbid. Maybe you should talk to a therapist—“
Mary wrote literary stuff, reflecting her own childhood of absorbing the Bronte sisters and Jane Austen. By the time they were married, she’d had two manuscripts returned. She was teaching school and writing in her spare time, demanding that John share the duties of home and child. He was in medical school, dead tired most of the time and in debt. By the time Rose was old enough to start school, she devoted herself to writing romance and doing it better than anyone had ever done. She would game the system, she said, following all the rules of the genre she had studied relentlessly, and write a romance so compelling that it would break out of the genre mould. In that way, she could begin to write the stories she really wanted to write.
The ball would be a tame affair, I realised, attended mostly by older couples. The fact that the envelope was addressed:
He shrugged. “I have informers in many walks of life. As it happens, I have another target who knows your boy rather
Sherlock hasn’t been lounging on the sofa. He’s in the kitchen, cooking something that smells wonderful.
He looked around the smiling circle of faces. “I owe you all an apology. If I have ever implied that you were not good actors, you have proved me wrong tonight. I had no idea.” He turned to Irene. “Why the secret?”
“That woman was my ex-wife, Mary. Mary Morstan, no longer Watson. She’s written a book. I saw it on display at the bookstore the other day. She’s been writing for years, and it seems this is her big break. I read the book jacket while I was waiting in line. It sounds a bit like she’s used me as a character, the evil ex.”
“Indeed, it is the foundation of the science of deduction. My observations are organised in a mansion of the mind, as it were, having rooms full of shelves and drawers and cabinets, all imagined in great detail. To retrieve the information, all I need do is visit the appropriate room.”
"If you'll be needing two bedrooms, I'm afraid there's just the one." Mrs Hudson looked at them expectantly. "What do you think, then, Doctor Watson?"
Before he can say anything, Sherlock interrupts. “Did you tell every one here, Lestrade? So much for keeping confidences.”
“Bollocks,” he muttered. A cab would be the fastest way home, but none were stopping. He’d better start getting used to riding the train.
They make their way up the stairs. He can tell John’s tired, so he pushes him into his chair and tells him he’ll make the tea. John smiles. “Thank you, love.”
It’s a nice hotel, an excellent restaurant, I’ve heard. I’m not sure if anything I have to wear is nice enough, but just as I’m beginning to fret about the state of my trousers, all of them being too loose, and the lack of any dress shoes, Mrs Hudson calls up the stairs.
“Not saying it could have been prevented,” he mutters to Holmes and Watson after he’s been ranted at by Wilkes for several minutes, countering every argument with stolid immovability. “Obviously, he’s been dead for hours. But if we’d been called in sooner…” He makes an impatient gesture, including the now pitch-dark area, illuminated by portable spotlights. “Now we’ll have to come back in daylight to finish collecting evidence; by then it will be harder to see signs of a struggle. What do you think, Mr Holmes?”
“Puns are a very intelligent form of humour, you know,” Sherlock replied. “People who make up puns are above average, mentally.” He had finished his French toast and was reaching for John’s card and gift. “My turn.”
Mycroft sends over some food. He tells me not to worry about the rent. He must be sad, losing his brother like that after spending so much effort trying to keep him alive and out of trouble. They didn’t get along well, but he must have loved Sherlock. I wonder why he didn’t cry at the funeral. But I don’t suppose Mycroft ever cries.
that happen now. It seems like more to him, but that’s just an impression. John is generally a polite and grateful person.
He’s embarrassed that he doesn’t know what interests her anymore. While he was gone, she turned into a surly teen who doesn’t laugh, wears ugly clothing, and spends all her time in her room with the door closed.
He makes John a mug of tea, though he hasn’t asked, because he worries about hydration. It’s very important to drink plenty of liquids when you’ve lost a lot of blood, even when you’ve had transfusions to stay alive. Staying alive is not the same as getting better.
John said they should be honest with one another, that this would keep them right and help them navigate this new relationship. Some things are hard to be honest about.
Milverton chuckled. “What a shame that Sherlock Holmes had to die in such a dishonourable confrontation. A common thief! People will be shocked to learn that these are your methods. They will be even more shocked when they learn about you and lover. A sad end to a man who was not so clever, after all. Well, this conversation wearies me. Goodbye, Mr Holmes.”
I place my hands on his head, gently feeling the shape of his skull, reminding myself that he didn’t die the way I imagined so many times. “You had an impossible choice. You did what you had to. And you came back to me.”
I played with my teabag, dunking it up and down. “I don’t care. I love John and he’s agreed that to marry me. If she’s unhappy that I’ve chosen a man, she will have to live with it.”
When they met in the lab at Barts, they hadn’t seen one another in years. But what if it had been their first time laying eyes on each other? What if Sherlock, a stranger, had smirked at him and asked him,
The clergyman frowned. “Your age doesn’t matter. You are old enough to obtain your own salvation, but unless you accept that you have sinned and then repent, you will go to Hell.”
“Ungrateful boy!” my aunt exclaimed. “Are you not humbled to be offered such an opportunity? Will you question this good man who is willing to take you in, wicked child?”
But she did cry when he dropped out of school and went to rehab. He felt bad that she was unhappy with his choices, but maybe parental love only existed so that parents wouldn’t ignore their offspring. It was a special kind of biological imperative, to keep your young from falling into cisterns or playing in traffic, but at some point it was less necessary. Offspring are meant to grow up, learn about self-preservation, and follow their own biological imperatives.
. The thing is, I don’t like letting people down, but it seems like that’s all I’ve done.” He feels tears welling up in his eyes and looks down at his hands. “We wrote to one another, and spoke on the phone while I was gone. I thought everything was going to work out. But then I got her letter, telling me that she’d been seeing someone. I’d been wounded, so I couldn’t even read it right away. When I finally did, I’d just learned the extent of my injuries, that they might make it impossible to practice surgery ever again. They sent me home and I stayed with her and Rosie for a while since I didn’t have anywhere else to go. But when I realised that she was still seeing this man she’d met, I just couldn’t do it anymore. What was the point? She’d obviously made a new life for herself, writing books, and I didn’t even have a job. I had a little money from my pension, so I just left, moved into a bedsit. Maybe I should have tried harder, but it was too painful. Didn’t seem worth it.”
“You’ve stated that you knew but did not participate or intervene.” Mason’s face shows no emotion; he is clearly uninterested in anything but the law. “Who else knew?”
The edges were a bit singed. I unfolded it carefully, revealing a page of Watson’s slightly uneven handwriting. The sight of that schoolboy penmanship brought tears to my eyes. But I feared what the letter might say, knowing he would have been angry with me for sending him away.
He would rather bore John than upset him, so he talks about bees, a subject he’s been reading up on in his spare time. John probably doesn’t care about bees, but it’s better than talking about cases, which could lead him to think about that alley. It might be best if he has amnesia about that, so Sherlock won’t have to think about how he miscalculated.
He doesn’t sleep. While he knows it’s the right decision, it doesn’t feel good. He loves John. By the time he realised that it was a mistake, it was too late. What made him think that he could have John? He should have seen what was happening. He can blame that on his lack of experience. And now, he will just have to get over it. If he doesn’t, it will destroy him.
They are referred to an office on the ground floor of the main building where they wait for nearly a quarter of an hour. Finally the door opens and a man enters.
Suddenly John was embarrassed. How could a pair of sock compare with what Sherlock had made for him? However odd and quirky, the little anatomy book was perfect. It had required thought and time, and it was completely Sherlock.
. Mary hasn’t mentioned moving, but it doesn’t actually surprise him. Her book is doing well, and she’s probably got a deal to write the next one. She can finally move up, leave all the trappings of this tawdry old life behind.
Jay nods. “That’s a common misconception, that if you’re bisexual you can simply choose to be straight. The truth is, a person can choose fidelity to a partner, but you can’t actually choose your sexual orientation. Conversion therapy is based on the pseudo-scientific notion that people can change their orientation. It’s caused immeasurable harm to gay people. You can’t
For a long moment John just stared at him, his mobile face betraying the inner struggle. Then a sigh. “I just couldn’t do it anymore. Maybe it wasn’t the best way, but I had to do something— or I would have killed myself for real.”
“You’re bringing him home.” This is not a question. If necessary, I will find him and rescue him myself.
I looked into his lovely eyes. It would be so easy to simply say what I felt, but it would be pointless as well. The love I saw in his eyes was mirrored in my own heart. What good would it do to say these things to one another? He could never belong to me, and I could never be his.
“Of course not. I don’t need to use blackmail to further my career. This is something else. I need information.”
He lay his head on my chest. “I love you,” he said. “I didn’t mean to bring all this into your life.”
Sometimes he dreams of Afghanistan. He remembers how they all counted on one another, made sure everyone was okay. He sees the faces of the ones who didn’t make it home, some dying as he worked on them.
“I’m merely suggesting that you might live your own life and have the money as well. Principles are fine things, but they don’t pay the rent.”
He picks up his phone. No calls from Sherlock, no texts. Maybe he’s on a case. He touches the number and waits for Sherlock to answer.
There is no reason why the man would have changed, but in the small differences Holmes reads the years since they’ve seen one another.
Mycroft had instructed us to arrive early for Mummy’s dinner, before the other guests, so we made haste to change into our evening attire as soon as we returned to Baker Street. I asked Mrs Hudson’s boy to hail us a cab.
“The revision may show some improvement. I trust that Irene won’t let us embarrass ourselves completely, lest her own reputation suffer.”
Waking up in a strange bed, Watson wonders for a moment where he is. While it used to happen quite often at university, it’s been a while since he work up like this, the inside of his mouth feeling dry and horrible, his head thick, and not recognising where he is.
Snapping my book shut, I rose and stalked to the bedroom. He would search our desks, I assumed. Watson’s revolver and my own I had put back in their usual places. When I returned to the sitting room fully dressed five minutes later, Lestrade had found the two revolvers and was holding at a slip of paper which he’d taken from an envelope on my desk. It was Milverton’s note.
And now, all of that grief was meaningless. A ridiculous joke, only reinforcing how unimportant he’d been to John. He’d let them all grieve. How could he do that? That’s not what friends do.
I picked out biscuits, three kinds I thought we should try. John got the milk and several bags of frozen peas. He doesn’t buy them to eat, I’d learned, but to use as cold packs. When we haven’t had any injuries for a while and they’re getting freezer-burned, he makes a thing with peas for dinner. Since I was grumbling about a headache, he thought we should put peas on my forehead.
“Jones will want to catalogue that,” I remarked. Inwardly, I rejoiced at his lost hopes. He was still mine, though he might wish he were hers. “I’ll send him a telegram asking him to come by.”
Holmes’s flat is interesting, like the man himself. Even though the furniture is clearly old and worn, the room is less of a tip than last time. It feels comfortable, lived in, like a place you’d feel happy to return to after a day of work, or after a long trip. An eclectic set of furnishings, very bohemian. That’s the only word that describes it; he can almost imagine a Victorian Sherlock sitting in that overstuffed chair with a pipe, his knees drawn up, puffing and furiously thinking about his latest case, blue smoke-rings chasing one another up to the ceiling.
Her confession shocked him. He’d received it at Bastion, read it, and gone to work, patching up boys who would return to faithful wives and grateful children. That was the day he’d been shot. Maybe his brain had only so much attention it could spread around, and the letter was taking up valuable focus.
“You — you made me leave you, and I thought you were dead— but you haven’t died, and you never — never told me—” More sobbing.
He sighed. “True. But it isn’t as if you would be raising your own offspring. That’s what a wife is for. Separate worlds, yours and hers. Think of how many couples we know who rarely see one another. Even our own father, when he was alive, was hardly ever around. There’s the shooting season, and hunting season, and the fishing trips to Scotland. When in town, there are evenings at the club—”
John took his hand, looking up at the trees. “I’m thinking… I would have regretted it. If regret is something a ghost can feel. Here, I feel it. So many people have died here. I’m glad I didn’t.”
Her lips tight, Molly faced him, ready to do battle. “You obviously don’t understand our audience, Sherlock. Every pre-teen girl thinks she’s going to grow up and have twins, a boy and a girl.”
He knows that couples fight. A relationship involves compromise and negotiation; where feelings are involved, it can become heated. There was nothing violent about Sherlock’s behaviour yesterday; John, though stubborn, is also contrite. He hates having Sherlock angry with him. He wants to apologise, promise that he’ll never slight him again, that he’ll proudly introduce him as his boyfriend, the love of his life, to everyone they meet. But he asked for time, and Sherlock grudgingly granted it. John is the one who has issues, and he’d better get started on them soon.
twice before, not specifically because of Mary Morstan. He just hated interviews, avoiding them unless Mike said it was necessary. Since Mike didn’t usually coerce him, he’d agreed to do it.
He smiled. “If we must play at being suitors, I will do my part. And you? Are you seeing Miss Ashton-Farbridge tonight?”
Greg returns the smile, raising it a few watts. “That sounds good. No breakfast today, just coffee. I’m running on fumes.”
Within a year Mr Hannigan had married and moved away, but he left me with the violin and a heart that had given itself to music. Those things would keep me company for many years.
I’m not sure what a remarkable funeral would look like, but it ought to be something that better represents you, who were remarkable in so many ways. Something grand, amazing, and a bit obnoxious. It should reflect who you were.
Lestrade’s elbow impacted him from the left, while Martha Hudson gave him a baleful look from the right.
Sherlock jumped up from the table and disappeared. John heard drawers being opened and closed in the bedroom, Sherlock mumbling to himself. Then, “Ah!”
“Yes, absolutely. I love him and have no desire for anyone else. But I think I’m sending mixed signals, and he’s angry with me.”
Seeing Bellamy with Allen had reminded me of a period in my life I would rather have forgotten. I admit that he had been my mentor, in more ways than I was willing to disclose to Watson. Evidently, he was still mentoring young men.
And here comes the angst. Well, not serious angst. Mild anxiety, second thoughts, doubts. And Mycroft.
Anderson is easily amused. He and Donovan are sniggering and whispering to one another while Sherlock crawls around the room, looking for the earring that matches the one on the victim. It could be the clue that reveals which of the two men killed her. Explaining this, however, is pointless, and wouldn’t change their childish behaviour.
His date is gorgeous, he decides. Not classically handsome,, but there is something ethereal about Sherlock that awes him. An hour ago, he would have said that
Unwilling to be seen as eavesdropping, though he certainly is, Watson makes a little cough before stepping into the room.
Something in Watson’s gut sinks. It’s horrifying to think that he was giving off needy vibes in a room where at least two people could spot his neediness. Sherlock Holmes knew, and the man who was planning to kill him did, too.
She reached up and laid a manicured hand on his face. “Believe me, I understand how hard this is for you.”
Soon the flat is full of friends. Matt and Christopher are wearing matching jumpers with reindeer on them, Sam is wearing antlers, and Daniel has made sausage rolls and lobster crostini. Mycroft has brought a case of champagne. Harry has brought Clara. Apparently they’ve decided to give it another chance.
“My dear Watson,” I said after we’d been around the park once. “You once named lock picking as one of your skills. Was that an exaggeration?”
All eyes were on Molly, who gave a petulant sigh. “Because they were so close, Alex knows when he’s in trouble, even if the others don’t know he’s been kidnapped. They can almost read each other’s minds.”
“Weddings do not interest me. If anyone is murdered at the event, however, you may describe it to me, omitting all irrelevant details, of course.”
Mary is there, too. She is an unknown quantity, someone Sherlock hasn’t yet deduced. But her love for John is genuine, and John wants to marry her. John will have a wedding, if that’s what he wants.
“DI Greg Lestrade,” he says, putting out a hand. “Sherlock called me from the bar when he saw you’d gone missing. Glad we found you in one piece. I interviewed your friends. You might want to give them a call when you’re able. They were pretty worried.”
He’ll ring Lestrade, he decides. He hears it buzz… three… four times. Must be on a case; it goes to his voicemail.
He doesn’t know whether to feel flattered or embarrassed. He’s mentioned that he has a flatmate, but never referred to Sherlock as his
“Focus!” Holmes barks. When Watson jumps, he sighs and speaks more quietly. “I need your help. Do you understand? What do you remember?”
He’s not used to this. He’s never had a John Watson before, a person who seems to fill in all the empty spaces in his life. He wants very much for John to stay, but he’s never had to think about somebody else’s needs and desires. As such, he’s trying to be better, to notice what John is feeling. The man is not a talker. Most of the time, that’s okay because his face gives him away.
At last he made a huffing sound, sending out of cloud of vapour before his face. “Though you have not said as much, I deduce that you are taking the case.”
“Yes, I know. She is determined to find him a bride as well. But I know my Watson; he will not wed.”
There was absolutely nothing unpredictable about the episodes. The series devolved into a typical school comedy/drama, with Jason Bradford defending his new friend, Alex. In the first episode, they watched Star Trek together, the alien boy asking lots of questions about the ships and what sector of the galaxy the Enterprise was currently in, and wondering when Earthlings had developed faster-than-light travel.
), he dreaded the day when he’d have to take something just to pay the bills. Mycroft had made it clear that he was responsible for his own success or failure. Being a difficult person to work with was all right when he was in demand, but now that the offers had become scarcer, he couldn’t afford to be a dick, even if that's who he really was.
“Why, that is what I want to ask you!” she exclaimed, arch in her feigned perplexity. Her blue eyes wide, she turned to Watson, fluttering her lashes. Holding his pen, waiting for the answer, he gave her a reassuring smile.
Whoever is breathing does not stir, but sighs a bit and mumbles. As my eyes adjust to the darkness, I see that there is someone lying in the bed. The strange thing is that this is no longer Baker Street. I turn back to the door, but it’s gone. In the darkness, I can make out the back of a chair, a wooden washstand with a cracked mirror hanging over it. The window is on the wrong wall, a tattered shade pulled down to cover it.
Charles took the corner of the flyleaf between his fingers and slowly tore it out of the binding. “Now it’s mine.” He took the title page in the same way, ostentatiously ripping it out, and continued with the next pages, tearing them one at a time from the book.
Even now, I’m not sure why he believed me. The investigation was still open, and he incorporated what I’d shown him into the evidence. A suspect was brought in and questioned. Fortunately, the murderer realised he was cornered and confessed. Mr Lestrade took credit for solving the crime, but he continued to call on me, and in return referred several private cases to me. Our partnership lasted many years.
This Rosamund was quieter than the other three. She sat in John’s chair while I put thumbs in an acid bath. She didn’t even ask me why I was doing this. (It was to check how quickly fingerprints could be eroded by various acids.) She just sat there, texting. Presumably, she was communicating with the other three Rosamunds to let them know what had happened.
My cousins took delight in tormenting me in every way possible, but occasionally they were inadvertently entertaining. There were further taunts about putting me in the
“Okay, that doesn’t sound so bad. My… my boyfriend is very important to me. I want our relationship to be strong.”
“Why did he do it?” He whispered the words, more to himself than to Molly. “What would push him to that point?”
“Give me!” Once the missive was in my hands, I paused, almost afraid to know what it said. A single sheet, folded. I opened it and read:
“She’ll be in school, John. She’s used to coming home, letting herself in. Just come after work, make sure she eats something and does her homework.”
Mr Hannigan was vibrant— young, handsome, always smiling. Wherever he went, a light seemed to shine from him, illuminating the dark corners of our hall, filling us with gladness. I would hear his laugh ring out in the hall and immediately feel content, knowing that he would patiently answer my questions and never, ever make me feel wicked for wanting to understand the mysteries of life and death. He had a snake skeleton— a lovely thing— in his room. I used to stare at it for hours, imagining the life that went on inside that narrow cage of tiny bones, all those ribs, moving in sync.
“How is Ethan?” he asks. He remembers running into her with the man, a ginger-haired fellow partial to bowties and jackets with patches on the elbows. Collector of something boring. Comic books, he thinks.
Watson would look at me the same way later, once they were home, and the question would be there, the one I could never answer.
Sherlock, ever the strategist, responded by snaking a hand inside John’s shirt and grabbing his nipple.
Sherlock raises one eyebrow, but invites him in. Crossing the threshold, he leaves his things by the door. He’ll take them upstairs later. Or maybe he won’t have to.
“He was a juvenile offender, entered the system at fifteen. I can’t tell what he did because the record is sealed. Richard Brook is the name he took on release. Before that, he was James Moriarty. No, don’t bother. There’s nothing there. Moriarty has been wiped from the internet, not a minor accomplishment.”
“If it’s anything about the script, forget it. Believe me, nobody cares if it makes sense. Did the original story make any sense?”
I did not know the man’s name, nor that of his assailant, but having seen clearly how the deed had been done, I went to Scotland Yard and asked to see the detective assigned to the case.
. I was scrawny and uncoordinated, not good at sports. I stood out, even when I tried not to.” He makes no move to put his shirt back on. “My brother found out I was cutting. At least he didn’t tell our parents. He said it could be our secret, but I needed to learn to control myself.
Henry Crawford is a rather lumpy looking boy who refuses to take his eyes off the video game he’s playing. Watson thinks he might be the kind of boy who suddenly grows into quite a nice-looking young man. It’s an awkward age, fifteen.
Matt waves him over to a table when he enters. They’ve just arrived too, the first of their group. Matt’s wearing his hair loose, around his shoulders. His boyfriend is tall and dark, with closely-cropped hair.
It was probably fine that he said this with more agitation than he had rehearsed. He shuddered, remembering Brook’s dead-eyed smile when he handed him the water. He could have been in an ambulance right now, heading for the hospital, if Irene hadn’t—
John is sitting right there, on the exam table, putting his jumper back on. Sherlock wants to ask about
“There’s something I must tell you.” His tears are making the ugly jumper wet where he’s laid his face on John’s shoulder. “You’re not yourself, John. The doctor warned me that this might happen, that you might be… different. Less inhibited. I don’t mind, as long as you’re alive. I don’t mind who you are now— but you don’t know what you’re doing. You don’t really want this—“
After that, I began to visit the hall most nights, and the ghost children of Milford accepted my presence. What does a ghost have to fear from the living? I certainly feared nothing from them.
“Your attachment to him grew, and I waited, reserving judgment. At any point I was willing to separate him from you, and had arranged a way to do that. I could have easily ruined him. But I waited, seeing that you had given up the drugs and were working hard to establish yourself in this career you invented.
I set out to adapt “The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton,” published in 1905. In that story, Holmes and Watson take the law into their own hands, breaking into Milverton’s house and stealing letters belonging to their client. They get away with it, and at the end, Lestrade comes to consult Holmes, who declines to be involved, stating, “No, Lestrade,  there are certain crimes which the law cannot touch, and which therefore, to some extent, justify private revenge.”
“I’m not an idiot, Mycroft, whatever you have deduced about me. I know a few things about lying. So answer my question. Where is he?”
Mrs Hudson was up next. Fake Jason would find her at home and she would challenge him. As he cornered her, tiny but feisty, she would stab at him with her knitting needles, but ultimately he would overpower her. When Fake Jason locked her in the cellar, the audience reacted with dismay, booing the character.
When I suspected that you were the cabbie who picked me up that evening, I became obsessed with investigating your death. You know me well enough to see that I pursued this headlong, without considering any consequences— to myself, you, or anyone else. Please understand that it was the faint hope that you might be alive, fuelled by my long grief, that drove me.
Mike shook his head. “It’s nothing. It’s just, there have been a lot of fan theories about what’s going to happen—“
But when he opens the door, John is standing there. He looks sad, and it will twist something inside Sherlock’s gut. Regret for all the times they might have approached this moment before and went another way instead. Hope that this time it will be different. Fear that it won’t.
I pad down the stairs, into the sitting room. It’s been tidied up here; I couldn’t think of any more excuses for Mrs Hudson. She’s grieving too, and the way she copes is by cleaning. I put her off for days, but finally I let her pack up the chemistry equipment and pick up the scattered dressing gowns and files and random clutter. She put them all in the bedroom and closed the door. It’s made her feel better. Sometimes I can hear her humming in her kitchen downstairs.
When I knew him better, I asked him about ghosts. He said that there are some things in creation that we are not equipped to understand. If I saw things which science could not yet explain, that did not mean they were untrue. In every age, there are those who are gifted to see what others do not.
“I’ve participated in a number of… activities,” he replies. “But not that. And not with anyone I cared about.”
“It’s going well, I think. We go out and do something most weekends.” She frowns a bit. “I’m not sure why, but I don’t look forward to our dates. It’s not that I… well, I just don’t want him to think…” She lets out a little huff. “He’s perfectly nice. Lives with his mother, and she’s nice, too. Not at all possessive. She’s quite eager to see him married, I think.”
He leaves eventually, and when he’s gone, so is my gun. I haven’t thought about that for a few weeks, but it is strange that Sherlock’s brother came to visit just so he could spout meaningless comfort. Not like Mycroft to care. Certainly not an advantage.
John was the opposite. Everyone had liked John— loved him. His life would have been full of work, love, and friends. That must not have been what he wanted, though. He must have been a better actor than anyone realised. Sherlock certainly hadn’t realised it.
Scotland Yard had begun adopting a more scientific approach, changing their protocols and placing more emphasis on physical evidence than on witness testimony. I feared that Mr Lestrade would dismiss me as a crackpot.
Weeping into his pillow, Sherlock remembers their first night together in this bed. Kissing John had felt urgent, inevitable. It nearly erased the awful memory of the night he kissed Victor, when Victor had drawn away, his face twisted with disgust, and the things he had said. John’s response, so different, had made him think that he could have the thing he’d denied himself for so long. He deserved to be loved.
wardrobe people had argued that he should dress more like a geek, but he had refused. Baz would not conform to expectations; his suit was a kind of armour, a way to let people know he was not to be dismissed as an eccentric.
I’d wanted to kiss him, as I said, from the first. I made a mistake the first day, though. He asked me if I had a boyfriend and, a bit sidetracked by his deep blue eyes and his dimples, I replied, without considering the implications,
He gave a short laugh. “No, it didn’t. This isn’t about the script. As idiotic as it is, I will perform my role as if I were up for a BAFTA.”
They were just two teenage boys rutting against one another, mouths hungrily groping. He imagined them long ago, finding one another, confessing their feelings. A private space, maybe a closet? Two boys in a closet, quietly, furtively hurried, afraid of discovery. He didn’t care. Let everyone see. Let both of them be ruined. This was all he’d ever wanted, all he ever would want. He would not deny it.
“You were no more successful with Miss Wickham than I was with Miss Ashton-Farbridge. Perhaps you’re jealous.” I gave him a rakish look. “You’re a flirt, John Watson, a shameless heartbreaker, and I do not trust you around ladies unless I am there to scare them off. If I were to send you on this errand, I have no doubt that you would come home engaged.”
Murray’s not a doctor. And he’s not really a friend. He was just the mate who got Watson out of harm’s way and saved his life. Not a thing you forget, even if you were unconscious through much of it. He remembers the blast, feeling as if someone was pushing him down. It turns out that something exploding near you can do that. He remembers realising that he was bleeding and seeing the state of things around him, knew that he would probably bleed out before anyone could help him. While he was wondering when his life would start flashing before his eyes, Murray dragged him to safety, Watson all the while mumbling, “Pressure, pressure…” He didn’t bleed out.
“He calls you a wronged woman, and himself your friend,” I noted. “He says you might bring two friends tonight if you are distrustful, but no police. Well. A pretty little mystery, to be sure. What do you intend to do, Miss Morstan?” I asked, still holding the letter in my hand.
John is definitely angry, he deduces. Today was a rather boring day, no case to occupy them. John didn’t work, so they spent the morning on their own projects, John writing in his blog, and Sherlock looking at a cold case file for Lestrade. John made himself a sandwich at noon, and asked if Sherlock would like one as well. He’d accepted (even though he wasn’t hungry) because John likes to take care of him and makes very good sandwiches. He’d eaten all of his sandwich and even washed the dishes afterwards so John wouldn’t have to do everything.
It’s a neighbourhood pub, narrow and deep, furnished with wooden tables and chairs, an old-fashioned dark wood bar with hanging glassware above, bottles behind. He’s taken a booth in the back.
When Watson took the tea tray down to Mrs Hudson, I turned to Mycroft and asked, “Why did you agree to pay for his education? You said you’d tell me one day, when you were certain. What did you mean?”
We talked until the sun was setting and we were called in to dinner. Watson had put on his best suit, I noted, and looked like a bright penny in a tray of dull antiques. The house was beautiful and traditional, its furnishings grand and dull, the servants dressed as they might have fifty years earlier. The Chadwicks were plain folk, for all their wealth. The dinner was heavy and underwhelming, meat drowned in gravy and plain boiled potatoes. The soup was thin and oily, and there was no salad.
But he lost something while he was in Afghanistan, and it’s hard not to blame himself for that. If he’d put the happiness of his family first from the beginning, he might have given up that dream and stayed, setting up a practice and taking care of his family. He and Mary had made a mistake, and Rose was the result. He would never wish his daughter hadn’t been born, and would never want her to feel unwanted, but without her he wouldn’t have married, and could have gone to war without second thoughts.
Her eyes glistened. “He came home with such hope— after so many years, our separation was to end.” She touched a handkerchief to her eye. “Poor Father.”
“I know what you want,” he told Fake Jason. “And I’m willing to negotiate. The Device in exchange for Jason.”
“I hadn’t any idea what was happening,” Huxtable says. “Wilkes told me Henry had withdrawn from school for family reasons. I never spoke with his parents, thinking he had taken care of that. I was away when Adam disappeared, and Wilkes never called to let me know what was happening. I suppose he thought it would hurt the school’s reputation.” He sighs. “This is infinitely worse. What parent would trust us with their child now?”
Watson discreetly began to pack up his filing project and tidy up the sitting room, where we always receive visitors. As the bell began its toll, he moved towards the stairway leading up to his room.
turned to Mr Allen and asked, “Tell me more about your interest in photography. Do you have cameras?”
Before he opens his mouth, he hears John step towards him. He’s about to tell Sherlock to ignore them, something like that. But he says nothing.
To save himself from the insanity that is Sherlock in a confined space, he packs up a small bag, enough for a couple days, and gets into a cab with his new (temporary) flatmate. If he’s losing his mind after a day or so, he can at least disappear stealthily while Holmes is micro-napping.
I held the letter after reading it, smiling at the laborious handwriting. After I had sat thus for several minutes, I sighed.
“Make an appointment, get a referral. Find somebody you can talk this through with. Figure it out— before you screw up someone else’s life.”
“Not you, per se. Remember the last time we met in a pub? I told you I was there on a case. That’s why I was at the Rock Garden last night, looking for the same person. Stalking him, not you. I didn’t expect to see you there.” He stretches his back, twisting a bit from side to side. “Just a happy coincidence.”
Irene and Molly had argued about what the MacGuffin should be called, and finally gave up, referring to it simply as the Device. Said with a certain intonation, it seemed ominous enough.
Thank you for following this non-canonical Holmes/Watson to Reichenbach and back. Your enthusiasm for this pair has inspired me.
“We’ve made a few adjustments, improved the pace.” Irene smiled at Molly. “And I think we’ve still managed to retain the best parts of the original.”
Holmes snorted. “Rubbish. My mental processes are slowing under the weight of such nonsense. I’m afraid you’ll have to go, old boy.”
gave up and continued. “The beginning is dull, people standing around and talking. The entire script is people sitting around drinking coffee, wondering what to do about Jason, who has obviously been kidnapped by aliens and replaced with an unconvincing double. This is… it’s all
I can hear feet ahead of me, scraping on the pavement. Or maybe it’s the sound of my own footsteps I hear, echoing off the buildings. I slow my steps, and the footsteps slow; I walk faster, and they speed up.
He sees very little of her, actually, and for that he’s glad. He recognises now how incompatible they really are. Maybe once, when they were eighteen, it seemed like love. Now he recognises what it was. A beautiful woman wanted to be with him, and he was flattered. He couldn’t be gay if a woman wanted him, could he?
John is silent for a moment, gazing idly at the neighbourhood they’re passing through. They’re on their way to a crime scene, one difficult enough that Scotland Yard is calling in an amateur to help them. But the Yard doesn’t consult amateurs, which means that Sherlock must be able to do to a crime scene what he just did to John, deducing his entire life from a phone.
She’s apparently already scouted out the first floor and knows where the stairs are. They hear her feet going up, the floor above them creaking a bit.
Mrs Hudson asks when I’ll return to work. Because I’d only been doing locum work when it happened, I really don’t have a job. I suppose I could call up and say I’m ready to take jobs again, but I don’t. My bank balance seems to stay the same. Mrs Hudson says the rent is paid, including the utilities. When I go to Tesco, the chip and pin machine does not fight with me. I suspect Mycroft has something to do with all of this. Well, he ought to pay for what he did, and if I’m the beneficiary, that’s fine. I’m not the one who betrayed his brother, who gave information to the enemy. I was Sherlock’s friend, he was mine. Best friends.
At first I drank a lot. I went through all the liquor in the flat in one week, thinking I could forget if I soaked my brain with enough alcohol. It didn’t work, but that didn’t stop me. I wasn’t reasoning well in those first days. But eventually I quit, mostly because I couldn’t get myself off the sofa to go buy more bottles.
“The way she describes him,” Watson said, “tells me there’s something off about him. Too many odd things. The dark glasses, the voice, the whiskers, the meetings that happen only when the step-father is gone. Sounds like…”
Last night he asked John to be his flatmate. That relationship, sharing these rooms, might work out well. John doesn’t have any awful habits that Sherlock can deduce, and he seems a tolerant person. John and he might get along well, as flatmates. That much is fine.
I turned on the light and decided to read over his notes, which he’d inadvertently left on the table. A few misspellings, I noted. Well, he wasn’t a genius. He had initiative and a native intelligence that didn’t hesitate to ask questions, even stupid ones. And somehow the questions he asked made me see things differently. He’d been a good partner, a loyal one—
“It’s going to come out. I’m willing to face it.” He started to gather the dishes and run water in the sink.
He used his key to let himself in the front door. He heard quiet music, a Mozart piano sonata, coming from the ground floor flat. This meant that his downstairs neighbour, a literary agent, was home, but she was a quiet person who lived a boring life, no flatmate. An ideal neighbour.
is an object pronoun. They have specific roles in a sentence.” He settled back in his chair. “Do carry on with whatever you were saying. You and your sister…?”
Lestrade is not as terrible at making deductions as Sherlock always said. He takes one look at me and says, “I’m sorry.”
Shrugging off his coat, Milverton cast a shrewd look at Watson, who with hostile submissiveness took the coat, folded it carefully, and laid it across the back of a chair.
“Because when people have concerns they go to you rather than speaking up during rehearsal, where I am the designated arsehole. Nobody wants to be me, so they keep quiet and complain to you.”
Tonight there would be no flannel shirts, no baggy trousers, Irene had decided— dark jeans, a black shirt, topped by a leather jacket. Simple, and elegant.
She says nothing, and he tries to imagine how it makes her feel to hear that he wanted adventure more than he wanted a family. She only knows him as an adult, and has always trusted him to take care of her. She can’t imagine the boy that he was when he and Mary learned that she was pregnant.
He meets Holmes at a place on the meandering little river where boys used to skive off their studies. Though it was supposed to be off-limits, generations of boys had secretly gone there to swim, making it practically a rite of passage for Priory students. Watson remembers going there with members of the rugby team more than once.
“We were doing well, I thought. When we met, he said he wasn’t really looking for a relationship. Then he kissed me. I wanted it. I wonder, though… maybe he’s regretting it.”
Selfishly, I wanted to make a confession of my love, but if I were to die at Moriarty’s hand, that confession might lie heavy on Watson. If I had to leave, I did not want to burden him. He must move on, live a new life without me.
He was nervous. After being alone for so long, avoiding relationships, he wasn’t sure how this would work. Sex was obviously going to be part of whatever they were now, but his prior experiences had always been unromantic, transactional. He’d abstained for several years now, since his last rehab, both drugs and sex, unwilling to risk attachment, which would lead to poor judgement, and ultimately disappointment. That was what Mycroft had drummed into him, and he had to admit that it had made life simpler. Fewer decisions, fewer distractions, fewer opportunities to fall. He’d stumbled into drugs, but found his feet again, and his career had grown as a result of his focus. As an actor, he had a future.
“Maybe. Or maybe it’s…” He stares into space, his eyes flicking back and forth as if he’s looking at an evidence board. “One sign, three murders, three different methods. Add to that, one failed attempt. Three successes, one failure. Why would he fail after three successes? He already knows what to do… Did he not suss you out adequately? Seems like a mistake you’d make the first time, not the fourth. But… what if it’s.. different people?”
“Beauty? Of course. The human psyche is designed to notice a pleasing symmetry, whether in a flower or a face, a sunset or a silhouette. Unfortunately, she is a woman.”
Smiling, Molly came to him and put her arms around him. “It’s all right. You’ll get the part next time.”
“I know you’ve seen a lot of… terrible things. Met a lot of criminals,” Watson begins. “Maybe you accept this, but I just find it hard to comprehend why people treat other people like that.”
“No. Well, yes. I am seeing someone.” Before he gets into that, he needs to ask her something. “Harry, do men ever flirt with you?”
“Then you will never be sad,” I said. “For I will always love you, Victor. When we finish our schooling, we must go to London and live together.”
Lestrade stands at the door, looking weary. “John texted me. I was at a hearing and couldn’t reply, but he says his daughter is missing. I tried texting him, but he hasn’t answered. You know anything?” He nods at Mycroft. “Mr Holmes.”
John shakes his head, remembering that day in the lab. Sherlock wanders among the guests, playing Christmas carols and apologising for John’s jumper.
Lying in hospital for weeks had given him a lot of time to think about this. It was normal, he’d decided. Maybe it even explained his failed marriage, in part. He’d been trying so hard back then, trying to fit in, please his family, do what he was expected to do. He remembered telling his dad that he’d gotten his girlfriend pregnant. Instead of being disappointed, his father had clapped him on the shoulder and congratulated him, as if it was a greater accomplishment than being the first in their family to go to university.
At work I treat coughs and colds and minor injuries. After the last patient of the day, I come home and watch the telly.
“For Alex to predict Mr Smith’s surprise… well, it sort of takes the air out of the scene.” He glanced at Lestrade. “Just a bit. I think I should just walk in and wait until Mr Smith notices me. His reaction will say it all.”
When he has a break between patients, he shuts his office door and makes a call. When he first got back from Afghanistan, he saw a therapist. He was referred to her for help adjusting to civilian society and the limits his injuries had placed on him. She wasn’t very helpful with that, not when things blew up with Mary and all their talk turned to fixing that disaster. He hasn’t been back in months. But she is the only therapist he knows, and maybe she can refer him to someone.
Nearly three hours passed before my uncertainty was resolved. When he came through the door, I observed his expression and his demeanour as closely as I had scrutinised any suspect. Disappointment was what I read. The treasure was recovered, and he would remain unattached, like me.
“As I’ve said,” Wilkes repeats with a sneer, “Dr Huxtable is unable to meet with you. Even the great Sherlock Holmes is not important enough to take him away from his duties.”
He was walking, finding his way between the tree trunks, which seemed to shut off every path to him. He felt closed in, almost suffocating, and the only sound he could hear was his own breathing.
“Hello, stranger.” Her voice sounds a bit hoarse. Probably drinking again. Since Clara left, she’s been off her program.
Watson improves daily. Mrs Hudson is pleased when he tells her he’s sure it was the soup. In a way, he’s right, though almost any form of sustenance would do to shake off his stasis. Soon he’s going on cases with Holmes again.
He sets his spoon down, refuses to raise his eyes and look at the man. He already got a good look the other day in the lab, and he’s not putting himself through that misery again. It’s one thing to know that Holmes is running around London, handsome and successful, doing whatever he does these days. It’s another to have him invite himself into Watson’s space.
“Holmes!” The look on his face told me that he’d been trying to get my attention. He’d taken off his mask.
Since he came home, every conversation has been about him. Maybe she doesn’t know how to help him without nagging and threatening. That was always her role, wasn’t it?
Irene put her manicured hands on her hips, daring anyone to have a problem with it. “There was an opening in the schedule when another programme was delayed. I told them we could be ready.”
“At least I don’t have to take care of that,” Murray’s saying. He leans forward and gives Watson a leering look, waggling his eyebrows for emphasis. “You know they start leaking when she hears the baby cry.” He grins. “Of course you do. You’re a doctor…”
He closed his eyes and thought about all the changes there would be now. John and he might live together. They might need more privacy than Baker Street could give them, and though he’d grown to love the ordinariness of living here, he would see how John felt about it. What if John couldn’t get acting jobs? Would he want to do something else? He would ask Mike to keep his ears open for opportunities.
“That is not my fault. Child actors are mostly chosen for looks, not talent. There’s no reason either of them should have expected an acting career. Survival of the fittest.”
There’s something he should say, something any other adult would know to say to a fourteen year old who hates her life. Something about parents and responsibility and giving things time.
Once, many years ago, he was buried after a serious wound nearly exsanguinated him, alive but cold and still, dead to all appearances. The grave robbers who dug up what was meant to be his final resting place were scared witless when they opened his coffin and found him glaring back at them. To bring himself back, he had to kill small animals and drink their blood for sustenance. Tales were told in that village about the living dead, a man who woke at night and fed on the blood of others.
Sometimes when I’m lying in bed, I put myself back into a moment I remember. Dinner at Angelo’s, giggling in the stairwell, following you down the street, your coat sweeping behind you.
“On principle, I never read tabloids. Or look at fan forums. Or listen to rumours, which is what I assume you’re about to share with me.”
That sorted, John sighs involuntarily. He feels a bit light-headed. “So, how did you know I was a doctor?”
“He’s not an idiot, Sherlock. You didn’t see him, after. He was broken. He stayed at Baker Street for a while, but then he moved into a horrible one-room flat where he barely had space to turn around. He was back at work then, because he needed money, but I don’t know how he managed.”
“We’ll arrive at the school after dinner time,” Holmes says. “If you want to eat, we should do it before continuing our journey.”
“Not at first, but after we started rehearsing, I became suspicious and did some research. He’s got a history of this sort of thing.”
This cold crept on me like that. Tendrils of vapour swirled around my legs, reaching around me like a vine, the hairs on my body rising up as it encircled me. I had not had time to notice the details of the room before the door was shut, but remembered a fireplace and a bed. I might have gone to the window and pulled aside the curtains to let some light in, but with the cold came a kind of paralysis. My heart pounded and my blood ran cold; I stood in the dark, hearing my ragged breaths, feeling the unknown
There will be pressure to get up and perform; he has no idea what he’ll lip-sync. He knows a lot of lyrics, but he might have to get drunk for that to happen. So much for his resolution to cut back.
Michael laughs. “Oh, I see. You’re critiquing my style. Well, it’s not going to matter in a few minutes, once I’ve prepared your injection.”
I was not seeing this as the scientist I wanted to be, but as a child, understanding that I would not grow up. I would not go to university and study the human body. I would find the answers I sought, but they would remain secrets to the living. I would not be the first human to know what death was. Everyone who had ever died had learned that. But I would never share this knowledge with anyone.
. They are sharing a flat, cohabiting, living together. Kissing when they feel like it, holding hands in public, having sex. Quite a lot of sex. After years of hiding, he’s still getting used to the idea that he can have this.
Philip was fascinated with my methods and followed me around, asking questions and making observations which showed considerable insight. Watson endeavoured to keep him out of my way, but I found that I did not mind his attention. I kept Watson occupied with minor tasks so that I could demonstrate the science of deduction to my young admirer.
“It’s all right, Sherlock.” John brought his face up to his and kissed him. “Whatever you want. We have time. What do you want?”
As for me, well, it’s not as if I’ll ever get over you just because your dressing gown isn’t draped across your chair.
Smiling at his confusion, John clarifies. “Mrs Hudson and I have been decorating the flat for the party. We could use your help.”
rubbish— all the tools he’d bought with his own money before he lost his job, all the broken clocks and lamps and radios he tried to fix. It was dirty, too, because the only person who seemed to care about having things clean was John. Harry hated it all, moved out as soon as she could get a job.
“Do you not think it a shame that there are so few female doctors?” she asked. “I know that I always blush when I am examined, even though Doctor Sterling has been my physician since I was a child. Do you not blush, Mr Watson, when you examine ladies?”
As predicted, Henry’s parents have no useful information. The father is a bank manager and the mother is a nurse. Hard-working, thrifty, honest people whose only desire is to be talked about by other people in positive tones. Their son is an only child, no doubt because they wanted him to have only the best of everything. Mrs Crawford is fretful, her eyes pink from crying; Mr Crawford seems angry, but without a good target for his displeasure. Like most middle-class men, he seems to think he didn’t deserve this, and wants to demand that someone be held accountable.
“Oh, Sherlock, you’re back!” she exclaims. “I was worried after you went dashing out of here last night.” She gives Watson a bright smile. “And you’ve brought a friend home! That’s lovely.”
Greenwood was a large house, and an old one. I explored the house and grounds at every opportunity. The gardener told me that it was built two hundred years ago, and that it had belonged to a family called Darrow. Parts had been added on to the original house, but were now kept closed because fewer people lived there.
“Such a pretty girl,” the mother said, touching her eyes with the edge of her apron. “We quarrelled, that morning. She’d been seeing a boy, and I said she was too young. The words we spoke to one another I will never forget. I only wish…” Her lips trembling, she bowed her head.
I was twelve then, a taller boy than others my age, with large hands, long fingers. The moment I had the violin in my hands, I felt that I had found something that had been missing. I took the bow as he directed and carefully drew it across the strings.
I felt some relief that he did not ask, but also disappointment. I did love him, and might have admitted it to him if he had asked. But I had disrespected him tonight, and he was humiliated by what I’d done. “I do, John. I respect you. I should not have let you think that you are not worthy. Please, don’t leave. You are everything I need.”
“Six months ago,” he says. “I’d probably have thought I was hallucinating. I don’t know. I might have fainted, seeing him at my door like that. Like he’d never been gone. It would be like waking up from a very long, terrible dream.”
John is talking with Lestrade when he comes home one day from using the lab at Barts. It seems that the criminals are not on holiday, John tells him. There’s an interesting case, and John is eager to see the crime scene. The suspects have all been taken into custody, so no chase today.
He wanted to share a bed, to make love with Sherlock. He wanted to have real anniversaries, not fake ones, and… grow old together. He wanted to tell real stories about their life together, to laugh about the things they both remembered.
His key is in his hand, the door open, and he’s pounding up the stairs at 221B. Maybe he should have texted, but that would have taken precious seconds, and he’s already wasted too many of those.
He thinks about his parents’ fights, how often they ended at the A&E, one or both of them bloody and bruised.
And there stood Irene Adler, looking elegant in a silk dress and a fur-trimmed wrap, wearing a tiny hat with a veil that covered her face. “Mr Holmes,” she said, looking past Watson. “How delightful to finally meet you undisguised.”
The fettuccine arrived, and Angelo fussed for a minute, refilling their glasses and removing the salad plates. “Today I have tiramisu,” he said. “On the house, for you and your lovely date.”
And gradually he talks about the hard parts, telling me, in bits and pieces, about the times he almost died, the times he almost wanted to, the beatings he endured, the drugs he sometimes took, the long hours without mental stimulation that nearly drove him mad.
“Tell me,” I say. “You said you hit me instead of doing what you’d always wished. What did you wish?”
My approach was rational. I had read the newspaper account of the investigation, I told him, and happened to have viewed the scene myself shortly after the murder occurred. I was struck by several things, I said, and pointed out several pieces of evidence that the police had overlooked.
“By then I knew John was alive, but thought he wasn’t interested in returning to acting. I certainly had no idea he would make an appearance that night. What you saw was me, live, almost speechless. A rare occurrence, to say the least.”
From all the stories told about spirits and the people who have seen them, you would think this is a common talent, but I have met only a few people who have genuinely had the experience of coming face to face a ghost. Most people who think they’ve seen a ghost have experienced some type of visual disturbance. There are many causes for this, a torn retina, for example. And peripheral vision is always indistinct, leading us to believe we have seen things that are really quite ordinary— the wind moving a curtain, some motion at the edge of our sight. Even harmless gasses like carbon dioxide can build up in confined rooms, creating hallucinations in otherwise healthy people. Enhanced imagination, I think, causes most instances of spirit-sightings, heightened emotions leading to an altered state of consciousness. It happens in seances, as I can attest.
“Okay, but they’re not going to waste time looking for a teen who’s only been missing a few hours,” he replies. “They’ll take our info and ask us to call if we hear from her. Unless it’s clearly an abduction—“
“You’ve been stood up,” Holmes says, sliding into the seat opposite Watson. A smug expression graces his stupid handsome face. Not exactly handsome, but striking. Though Watson is not thinking about that now. Or ever. Definitely not.
I glanced up, then looked at the clock, frowning. “I’ve sent him on an errand. I thought he’d be back by now, but if you’d care to wait, you’re welcome to have a seat.”
And that’s what he’s doing now. He does what his gut tells him is right, follows his instinct, his own wants and needs be damned. There is no conflict in his heart.
“Hi, Greg. It’s John. Look, my daughter is missing. She probably slipped out during the night. We’re frantic, really, and if there’s anything you can do— well, I don’t know what to do. Give me a call when you can.”
“Oh, god…” His eyes are distant for a moment. Then he looks right at Sherlock. “Yes. Yes, of course, I’ll come with you.”
my presence, for they began to descend, moving like shadows of the day-children who had inhabited the room just hours ago, sitting and reading as if their studies were not over and they needed to revise the day’s lessons. They did not look at me, but carried out their ghostly routine as if I were not there.
Conversation suddenly feels like too much. He wishes he had just stayed home in his dreary flat and watched an old movie, or read a book, or anything. It’s not as if he’s outed himself; it was understood that neither of them are straight. He just isn’t used to talking about it. In a fit of desperate honesty, he’d told Mike, and— well, here he is. He’s never been on a date with a man, and if the last twenty minutes are any indication, he’s rubbish at being gay.
Charles stood over me, gloating. “You’ll not be so brave when the ghosts come,” he said. “You’ll be begging to get out then.”
“When you came to me and asked for money, I was reluctant because I did not trust your judgement, or his. But once you’d explained it to me, I saw that something unexpected had happened. Your reasons for asking were unselfish. Your argument that educating him would help your firm was specious; clearly he did not need a degree to do the kind of work he was doing. You admitted that you wanted it for him because it would fulfil him, and not in a way that would benefit you directly. He was already practicing medicine on you, stitching you up and treating your accidents. You wanted an education for him because it would make him happy, not because it would make him more acceptable. That is why I agreed to pay.”
“And might you be needing me at some future date to drag your heads out of your arses when you get stuck on another case?”
Sherlock carries on glaring. “You didn’t plan it the other two times, either— so you said. Or when you were shot in Afghanistan. Or any of the times you drank yourself into oblivion. Just sitting in that horrible flat was a death wish. No more death wishes, Watson.”
She could not have chosen a worse button to push. Sherlock only hoped his face was not betraying him.
Even now, though, he’s not sure what he should have said. At that moment, he wasn’t the person who could have said what he’d dreamed of saying:
After the ladies had gone up, the gentlemen retired to a chamber off the dining room, where Mr Chadwick offered us port and cigars. Watson was unusually quiet, I observed. Unfortunately, Mr Chadwick filled the void, talking about the new machine he was contemplating for his factory.
You’d take it, wouldn’t you? Of course you would. You were ready to take the poison pill the cabbie gave you. You’d risk your life to prove you’re clever.
I feel certain that Sherlock is alive, but he’s wounded, traumatised by what he went through. For two years he’s had no name, no home, no friends. He’s a different person now, someone I may not recognise. I’ve dreamed of him, but I don’t really know what that means. It’s kept me alive, though.
“I mean, sir, that I do not know about Heaven and Hell, only because there is no evidence of either. Lacking proof, I must assume they are a fiction created to scare people into doing what religion holds to be right. And I do not believe that God is cruel, or that he would cast children into Hell when wicked men and women go unpunished.”
And he made a resolution: no longer would he live by other people’s expectations or rules. He would be himself and not apologise for who he was. Luck was meaningless and fickle. He was ready to rely on himself. Though he’d never seen himself as a person who failed, failure would not be the end. It might even be a good lesson. He returned home, uncertain what his life would be, but ready to move on.
In the kitchen, Mycroft had located teabags and three clean mugs, and was checking the sugar bowl for foreign substances.
Other than Brook, the rest of the cast seemed to be falling naturally into their old roles, playing off each other without reverting to adolescence. It surprised him to see that Sally was quite a good actress. He hadn’t known her well back then, and the scripts never made her more than a cardboard bully. Clearly she had made the most of her opportunities. Anderson was doomed to play oddball supporting roles, he decided. Historical dramas, mad scientists, and maybe Dr Who for a year or two. It wasn’t that he didn’t have talent; he simply had neither the look of a leading man nor the inclination to be that man. A good thing, perhaps, considering what the business often did to leading men, John Watson being a prime example.
More people arrive in various approximations of seventies fashion, from hippy funk to metal chic, shaved heads to big hair. Christopher is holding a contest to see who can name the tune. John wins by identifying a couple of flip-sides to singles.
Still woozy, he knows he’s out of time and has to move quickly. Michael is bending over him, figuring out where to put the needle, probably hoping to make it look self-administered. In that moment of indecision, Watson strikes, raising himself up and slamming his head into the other man’s. The needle goes flying.
“They have. Which is how I know it’s not just a rumour. But it’s very secret right now. You can’t even tell Greg. I can trust you, right?”
This is hard to answer. He’s pushed a lot of this down, almost as if he’d deleted those experiences from his memory. “I had a friend. I guess we were twelve, maybe thirteen. We used to do things together. I mean, yeah, we did normal stuff, but we also… erm…”
“I will,” he said, scarcely aware that he’d decided to say it. Well, what else could he say? Maybe— “I love you, Sherlock.”
A short, angry conversation between mother and daughter ensued, concluding with the words, “I hate you.” Ariel said that. Then she added, “Yes, I do mean it.”
His sister, Harriet, had dropped out of school, her own acting career having fizzled before it started.
He taught me that all life is a process, a never-ending cycle. What is alive eventually decays, and new life comes from the old. In this way, nothing ever truly dies.
“No, just…” Matt winces a bit. “I didn’t mean you look bad. You just… you’re always alone. I see you walking sometimes, or at Tesco. Actually, I’m pretty sure you live around the corner from me.”
Better than dragging it out for weeks, thought Sherlock. Fortunately, there wouldn’t be much cast promotion ahead of time for the reunion broadcast. There might be some interviews afterwards, but Mike could be selective for both of them. Once summer arrived, there would be filming for
“Indeed, Watson, you must take care,” I said. “Your marital bed must be as orderly as an accountant’s ledger. Girls may be conceived on any day of the week, but if you want boys, you must have coitus only on weekends and bank holidays.”
) than his untrained eye could see, he turned and smiled at the woman who approached him, asking if she could help. She had a round face, intelligent grey eyes. Her fair hair was dyed black, cut straight at her shoulders with a short fringe that did not hide a high forehead. A walking advert for the gallery’s jewellery collection, the helix of each ear was arrayed with multiple earrings, and rings adorned her fingers, but no necklaces. (He saw nothing he might have bought for his mother; necklaces and brooches were clearly not a young woman’s thing.) She wore no makeup, and looked quite different from the picture he had seen. But there was no doubt.
It isn’t about the sex because, god, last night was perfect. And it isn’t about John, who is also perfect.
“I make allowances because he’s fashion-impaired,” he explains. “Very sad to know that there are people who cannot dress themselves.”
“Ye gods!” Sherlock raises his hands to the heavens. “Do you see? You’re already complacent! You’re walking around in a vest with metal studs, chest hair and all, and sexy leather trousers that leave nothing to the imagination, thinking you’re invincible because you just played air guitar in front of a room of strangers. It’s horrifying enough how unobservant you are— now, with the added complacency and bravado of a guitar solo, you won’t survive a week!”
“I’m delirious. I think my husband just said we’re not actually married. Since I know that we are, since I saw the marriage license with my own eyes, I must be delirious. Now kiss me again.”
I’ve received many insults, some of them cutting, others ridiculous, but up until this point in my life, no one had ever used the word
He watches as she approaches, a man following behind her. She is bottle-blond, smiling, wearing an aggressively close-fitting dress, bright red. Many people look good in red, but on this woman it looks like a strategy more than a fashion choice. She wants people to know she’s in charge here. The man with her is not her lover; he’s probably a co-worker.
Watson’s breathing slows. When Holmes is sure he’s asleep, he takes the bowl and spoon back to the kitchen and rinses them.
John spears another dolma. “You’re not doing anything wrong, Sherlock. You’re who you are, and I accept that.”
John sniffs and scrubs the arm of his jumper across his eyes. “It’s because of you that I’m alive. That day when you came to my flat and asked me to come with you on a case. That day… I was close. I’d almost given up. I was looking at my gun, and when I heard someone in the hallway, I put it back in the drawer. Then you knocked, and everything changed. When I went back there to get my things, I saw my gun and realised that I hadn’t thought about dying since I opened that door and saw you standing there. You saved me, Sherlock, and for that I’ll always be grateful. Always love you.”
John’s smile is radiant, sincere, but there’s still something he’s hiding. Sherlock does miss the intimacy, though. He misses John’s arms, his smile, and the way he looks at Sherlock. And he wants this so much.
Wearily, I shouldered my bag. It had taken me a few days to hike out of the mountains and outfit myself for the journey I would now undertake. First to Italy, and then I would head east, into the Balkans.
Peering ahead into the darkness, I stop, trying to remember who I’m following. I don’t hear the footsteps now. The fog presses in. For a moment, I just breathe, my breath turning into vapour before my eyes.
He doesn’t remember getting home that night. Two nights ago. Saturday, it was. He’s not sure he remembers much of Sunday, either, since he spent most of it recovering. This is Monday, the day he sees Ella and updates her on his progress.
We retired to the bedroom. John still seemed distracted, but I managed to keep his attention long enough to consummate our relationship.
He wished he’d found a way to be close to John the way their characters were close. For four years, they played best friends on screen; when off the set, there was little contact between them. Sherlock made it clear to everyone that he preferred to be alone. For his part, John was nice to everyone and seemed to have no special interest in him. Sherlock never said anything. He never even said goodbye when it ended.
“I see,” he said. “And was it you who applied physics to Mrs Hudson’s sink while she was out at the shops yesterday?”
When I heard footsteps approaching, I pulled my feet up under me and sat like a Turk, not moving a muscle lest they find me.
Because covering an adolescent with glitter-paint for every episode would be tedious, the writers abandoned the silvery skin and the makeup people just made his character look pale. Because he needed some feature to give him an alien look, they opted for giving him pointed ears, like a Vulcan, but left his hair long and frizzy, which could be used to hide them most of the time. How he’d hated wearing those ears.
“I should never have let you go,” John said. “I think I always loved you, but didn’t know if you felt the same. When you left, I thought I’d never see you again. I told myself that if I ever had another chance, I’d tell you. So I’m telling you now: I love you, Alex.”
“Okay.” John feels his face colouring, and tries to find words. “We were, you know, kissing… and touching each other. Sherlock put his fingers inside of me, and it felt great. Then he wanted me to… erm… to be inside of him. I’d never done that before, and I think he realised that, so he was guiding my fingers, and I was sliding them into his… into his hole… and I was just…” He sighs and covers his face with his hands for a moment, regaining his composure. After a moment, he resumes. “Look, I’m a doctor. I’ve put my fingers into men’s arseholes more times than I can remember. When I do that, I always try to be detached because they’re embarrassed and it’s not appropriate to think about sex then. It’s not an erotic thing. You have to be professional about it. I slipped into clinical mode and I… wasn’t excited anymore. I tried to make it up to him, but I guess he wasn’t turned on either at that point, so we just went to sleep.”
“I do not love the lady, if that is what worries you. My motive is a practical one: she will provide a buffer against suspicion. For you, as well.” I finished smoothing my hair and took my top hat off the rack. “Well, time for me to be off. Wish me luck.”
“Upstairs.” DI Lestrade seems curious about John, too, giving him more than a cursory glance. “So, you’re John Watson.”
Well, it’s obvious there won’t be another date, or going back to his flat for a drink, so John will simply enjoy looking at him, bask in the attention Sherlock is trying to give him.
Sleep is risky. It brings back those minutes when I couldn’t fathom that it was too late, followed by the moment I realise you’re dead. A horrible, endless cycle of hope and despair. In my dreams, you’ve died more times than I can count. Every time I wake up and realise you’re gone, I want to die, too.
It wasn’t until we were in bed that he propped himself on an elbow and ran his fingers through my hair.
He wonders if Greg has told his wife, and what she said. Greg has several children, he thinks, probably Rose’s age or older.
. Smiling, she looked up at him. “We’re going to be seeing more of each other. I just got a guest spot on
“You want me to investigate this.” He sighs and buries his face in the arm of his dressing gown. “What about the other case—
Relieved, he stood and came forward, tentatively put his arms around John, and planted a chaste kiss on his lips.
I silently amused myself with observations about the company until the meal ended. We then retired to the room my mother grandly calls the
“Death is interesting.” Moriarty takes an apple from the bowl, begins to carve it with a pen knife. “I’ve always thought so, anyway.”
Molly’s wearing the pink jumper with the tiny cats playing with tiny balls of yarn. She looks a bit sad, and he realises that the last time they talked, she had started dating someone— an E-name… Evan? Ethan? That was it. She even mentioned that they were talking about moving in together. Perhaps it was going badly. He can certainly identify with that.
“I guess so. I mean, I’ve been with men before, but that was always… erm. Uncomplicated. Just sex. Don’t most men have gay experiences at some point? When they’re young, maybe?”
I opened the door and held it for John. As he reached for the light switch, he turned back to me to say something. “You know—”
Once he was gone, Watson excused himself, saying he should write up the case notes. I waved him off. Casting a look at Philip, he left the room.
When he turned off the tap, he could hear his phone buzzing on the sink top. Wrapping himself in a towel, he picked up the phone and saw a number he hadn’t seen in a while.
I’ve just walked through a car full of people and have my hand on the door into the next carriage. The people here are all blanks, dream creatures without features.
“I texted you earlier, asking if you wanted Chinese. Since you didn’t answer, I just picked up stuff I knew you liked.”
He kissed back. We’d known one another two weeks. From this I deduced that he was, in fact, (mostly) gay.
“Indeed.” I smiled back at him. “Soon police departments will be relying on fingerprints to solve crimes, just as they now use footprints and other observable physical evidence.”
It’s unsolvable, this grief. If I could sleep, really sleep, if I could stop hearing your voice, saying,
“By the way, Mary’s not leaving London, so it looks like Rosie will be spending time here. Maybe every other weekend. I hope you’re okay with that.”
Emma and Charles would have me believe that the Red Room was named for all the blood that had been shed there. When I saw the room, though, I realised that the walls were a faded red, the curtains a heavy, blood-red velvet, like those in the library, and the rug of an oriental pattern, mostly red.
Holmes is a loner, he guesses. He doesn’t talk about school, probably because he understands why Watson hates him. Does he still stay in touch with his old circle of friends? He tries to imagine that group— Wilkes, Darrow, Barnes, Lowry— each of them in some stuffy but well-paid job, strategically married to the right kind of woman, belonging to the best clubs. That’s what people like that do. He finds it hard to imagine Holmes exchanging Christmas letters with them.
He’d never thought of Molly as an especially good actor, and was pleased at the edge she’d given her character. She was overjoyed about Alex’s return, but still a tiny bit resentful, and managed to blend these two things flawlessly. This Holly Martin was no longer the girl with a crush; she’d become a woman who could accept that Alex and she might be friends, but nothing more.
I mean that she seemed to realise that I could see her, and was thus drawn to me. I found her in my room more than once, wringing her hands and silently weeping, as if she wanted to tell me something. Her usual visits took place after midnight, when I would wake and find her hovering at the ceiling, as John had once done.
The effect this had on me was dramatic. I imagined Watson climbing up the side of our house, entering through a window, finding me in bed…
As he gets dressed for the party, he’s thinking about Sherlock. The last time they talked was when he told Sherlock he was going back to his own flat, sleeping in his own bed, and if he remembered anything else, he’d call him. He has Sherlock’s address and number in his mobile, but they haven’t exchanged a single text.
“I’m sorry.” John ran a hand through his hair. “The cover story was Clara’s idea. She saw how close to the edge I was; when she pressed me, I admitted that I was thinking of suicide. Immediately she planned for me to disappear for a few weeks. Saved my life, she did. And took a lot of flak for it. I never actually went to Aokigahara, you know. Mount Fuji was the destination. She’d found us a place to stay, a private inn, then called my hotel in Tokyo to tell them I was hiking for a few days. When we heard the news that I was supposed to have killed myself, I told her I wasn’t going back. We argued, but I insisted. She arranged everything after that, bringing us home and creating a new identity. She made me see a counsellor, kept me from drinking. We were in Canada for a while. Other places.” He waved a hand vaguely. “I don’t even remember. It felt good not to be John Watson.”
A couple more Rosamunds turned up over the weeks following our engagement. Mycroft kept us updated on the wedding plans. It was a rushed affair, he kept complaining, but as it turns out, my brother has a flair for planning weddings. This should have been no surprise, as he’s easily organised coups, established new governments, and orchestrated summits of G8 without breaking a sweat. A wedding might involve delicate negotiations and compromises, but this is nothing to him.
Quietly he slips into the loo and washes up, shaves, brushes his teeth, then stares at himself in the mirror for a good minute. The hours of tossing and turning have done their work on him, leaving his eyes puffy and his skin grey. What does Sherlock see in this face? Why did he even come to John’s flat that morning, inviting him along on a case? The excuse he gave was that he didn’t want to leave John with a false impression of who he was. Maybe he didn’t want John to think he was boring.
Mrs Bellamy approached with a younger man in tow. As I had predicted, Mr Allen was a young, good-looking in a willowy way, with pale blond hair that kept falling across his forehead.
“You look fine,” Irene said, opening one more button on his shirt. “And a bit sexy. Live with it.” She frowned up at him. “I can count on you right? You can keep your head in the right place for an hour?”
“Why are you two still here?” Irene stood in the doorway, ready to leave. “I thought you would have been out of here like a shot.” She gave them each a hug, and then a playful shove. ”Go. Get out of here. You’re not twelve years old, boys. I think you can figure out where to take it from here.”
I realise, however, that it might be a serious disadvantage if his brother’s best friend were to put a gun to his head and be found by his landlady, bleeding into the carpet. Might be newsworthy, even. I suppose, as Sherlock’s former blogger, I do still have some publicity value. Mycroft hates publicity.
I learned the tricks of that trade so that I could discover what was genuine, if anything. I observed seances, talked to mediums and clairvoyants, people proficient in table-turning and automatic writing. Ninety percent of what I saw was fake, another nine percent less blatantly false, but vague enough that it might be thought inspired by something real.
“It’s common sense, man! My god, you were drugged! You’re a doctor, so you should know these things. It’s not like spraining an ankle or stepping on broken glass. You’re clearly not in your right mind if you think you can just go home and sleep it off. Think of what could happen! You might accidentally put the toaster in the bath and electrocute yourself.”
“Because,” she says. “On the whole, our childhood was shite. Those songs provided some bright moments after things started going to hell. I wasn’t worried about anything when we were pretending we were in a heavy metal band.” She laughs. “I guess I’m getting sentimental in my old age.”
Watson sighed. “As diverting as that game was, I’m not sure I can take more of it yet. Give me a few days.”
“John,” she says. “Running away is not processing what happened. It’s just putting off your grief. Let yourself feel what you feel.”
Moriarty steals the Crown Jewels. Well, he doesn’t exactly steal them, but he breaks the impenetrable display case and poses, wearing the jewels and sitting on the throne. And he leaves a message:
He stalks towards the door, hoping he’s made some kind of point. It’s a tiny satisfaction in a day that’s already hanging over the chasm.
“Richard Brook, a man with no past. A terrible actor whose existence begins with Diarrhoea Dude. I want to know who he was before that.”
Sherlock said nothing. For the last hour he’d been mentally kicking himself. He badly needed the role. What did it matter if it was silly and pseudo-scientific? He was a good enough actor to pull it off and no one would ever know—
When he woke up in the base hospital, he learned that he’d almost died. They described the damage to his shoulder, and he understood what it meant. The loss was complete, then: his wife, his marriage, his daughter, his career, his health, his future.
When I thought the conversation had gone on long enough, I smiled. “It’s been wonderful seeing you again, Bellamy.” I bowed to Mrs Bellamy. “Thank you for inviting us, madam. A lovely evening, brought to a finale by lovelier company. I enjoyed meeting you, Mr Allen. We must do this again some time, when I don’t have an early morning ahead of me.” I nodded at Watson. “Shall we be going, then?”
John will be the fool every time, but he’s starting not to mind so much. “Thank you for this. Walking home. And the guitar solo,” he says. “Any progress on the… thing?”
I can see myself going through months, waiting to take that last pill. Just going through the motions each day, waiting to dream again. That’s what my life is becoming. I pretend I’m back, moving through the world like a real person. But in my addict’s heart, I haven’t moved on at all. I keep him there, always, like a drug I know I can quit any time I want. But I never want that.
What he actually feared was that Sherlock would back down, call it off, tell everyone that it was a joke. But everything leading up to the big day went smoothly. Harry was miffed that she hadn’t been asked to be best man for John, but was happy for them. Mycroft insisted on following every stupid tradition and superstition either of them had ever heard of, but it was always easier to humour Mycroft about petty things than to fight him.
I told him about my parents. Though it had only been a few years, it felt like a long time. I remembered my mother, her hair shorn, lying still in her casket. I did not tell him how my father died; no one had ever explained to me what happened, but I knew that it was no accident.
The others were looking excited and a bit wary. They saw the problem as clearly as he did, and knew it was a mistake to pretend it didn’t matter.
Sherlock is right. The kiss tells John things he’s tried hard to forget. It tells him that has loved men before, but called it friendship, that he has wanted to touch men and kiss them, and called it lust, or fantasy, or
“I saw it happen, as I said. So tell me, if a man fell face first, would he have time in three seconds to turn and land with his head pointing in another direction?”
. He snorts and sits down on the landing. Looking up, he sees Holmes, remembers the key and the door.
“He hasn’t said anything. It’s more in his attitude. He’s just… distant. We’ve had a couple fights, but I thought we’d reconciled. Fighting is normal, isn’t it?”
“It’s a hard thing to deal with when you’re that young. Maybe you hadn’t figured out what you were, and he labeled you. His remark struck at your identity. You might have felt that he’d stolen from you the opportunity to define for yourself who you are.”
Disappointment is something he has lived through, learned to endure. He’s still here, and whatever happens next, he will face it.
Lestrade hurries back down the stairs; the door slams behind him. Sherlock grabs his coat and scarf and heads down, hollering to Mrs Hudson that he’ll be home late and might need some food.
