John had never been so close and he would never let him back away, he swore to his heart's holy demon.
After some moments of silence, the Alpha made a stronger attempt to drop the tone of this conversation.“Would you like tea?”
“No, John, I promise, I'm not. Now, next thing is exactly that: What's wrong with the bond, why are we not emotionally bonded?”
what I want when I want it. Won't you?”
He picked up his phone and looked through what few pictures he had on it. There were five of him and Sherlock; one attempted selfie, four shot by Greg or Molly and then sent to him. Then there were 12 photos of Sherlock, capturing the twelve weeks of pregnancy he'd already gone through. Today he would have taken the thirteenth picture with Sherlock glowering at him for this stupid idea.
“I am not sure I get your meaning.”
way.” John told him with amusement.
“A few,” Sherlock replied, tapping his lips with his index finger. “How about you?”
And was luckily met with compliance. “Yes, I would. Thank you.”
would spill something?
“John,” Sherlock began more seriously, “we're going to have babies. Four babies. I want everything to be ready before it's time and I want it done before I'm too immobile for the tasks. I'm in my fifth month of pregnancy and you heard Dr. Field – I'm only going to grow faster from now on, which means I'll qualify as my own household in about a month and a half. We need to get this done.”
“Ah, hello, dear! You must be John! So glad to finally meet you!” the plump omega woman chirped as she patted his cheek on her way in.
“I, uh.. Sorry.” the Omega replied, lowering his eyes in submission and as a peace offering that wasn't needed. “I just.. Are you going to keep me?”
“I don't know,” he answered absent-mindedly, then corrected himself with a lie. “No, I'm fine. Bored.” A white lie, he thought. He gave John his 'I-was-in-thought-and-you-interrupted-me' reaction.
He found himself unable to move when Mycroft was walking off, all his words clinging to him like bad omens. “Time to choose a side, Dr. Watson.”
“Well, let's not worry about it now. We still have god knows how long to go. Just note, that whatever decision you make, goes.”
“Sorry, it's just..
The older Alpha, whose brown hair had a clear red shimmer to it, tilted his head, raising an eyebrow and smirking in such an arrogant way, John wanted to lash out at him for, not only intruding (though Sherlock had clearly expected him), but additionally for his and his assistant's horrendously pretentious behaviour in Sherlock's home.
“Sherlock.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Yes, he was kinky about this whole pregnancy deal and yes, he would, should Sherlock let him, enjoy and relish every moment and bit in his Omega's now ever-changing body.
Sherlock's exasperation was obvious. “Definitely my brother.” he breathed, sinking into his armchair. “Just don't talk until John gets back, or do, but not to me. At me, I won't be listening.”
going out for cases again; not without me.” John decided firmly.
She smiled and shook her head. “Oh, aright. You boys go out and have fun!”
John walked the way to the taxi by his side, not speaking, just bathing in the warm feeling of Sherlock's mind at ease, feeling him strongly through their bond and suppressing any worries either of them had bubbling up inside them.
After minutes of playing he noticed it was Chopin his pup was listening to at the moment; he loved playing Chopin and it could only ever sound better when Mycroft played the piano to his violin – minimalistic number of instruments and yet rich in sound. There was one good thing about their parents' way of raising them: they were given the chance to learn to play an instrument of their choice and support could be taken for granted. Now he let the bow glide over the strings with satisfaction and his own pup was listening. If there was one aspect of parenthood he wanted to give to his child, it was this, music and the chance to play it, create it, live it because no matter how disordered a mind, how restless a soul, there was peace for everyone in some piece of music.
“You're leaving already?”
And still he had not been able to decide. Did he want this child or did he not? Surely he couldn't give it much more time to be thought through – Omega pregnancies were not tolerated to be aborted after passing the eighth week of pregnancy nowadays.
“Yeah... Sadly, that's true.”
As the Alpha looked on in shock, Sherlock positioned himself comfortably, but so that John could see what he was doing. On his back, reaching around his belly with both hands, he pushed down his pants, which John helped him discard, and then slid his hands back up what little of his thighs he could still touch, bringing them to his cock. He pumped a few times, massaging his balls to encourage his arousal, then brought one hand down, brushing over his perineum and touching the ring of muscles to his opening. He sighed luxuriously, like he was tasting water the first time after days without a drop.
When Sherlock woke up, he could just hear John breathing in little bursts, smell his sweat. He sat up in the bed to stretch and look around.
“Why is he here?” Sherlock asked. He'd been quiet during the entire tour, observing, listening. The guide and the other Alphas, which Sherlock could clearly see were more than interested in this omega speciality, looked at him, flabbergasted. “Well, as you say: he is rare and basically an Alpha's every dream. The fact that his number is lower than that of the last one you showed to us, but being placed
“They're in their cots upstairs. I took the liberty of carrying them.”
“No you won't! Will you stop pretending and just accept that you need help for once!” Sherlock shouted, grabbing his arm, swallowing hard as he could easily reach all the way around his wrist. He got up slowly, confronting John directly. “I'm done with the charade, John. This isn't just about you anymore. You're here for me and for our children. If I am able to look beyond my own interests for the sake of this family, then so, the
"London," Mycroft said as Sherlock growled the same into his ear.
"After our earlier argument, I wasn't sure that would be a comfort."
“Constable Trimble said I had until you got yourself in handcuffs to talk to you,” the sergeant said. “The joke’s apparently on me. He meant until I slapped them on you.”
"You people need to make a fucking handbook," John snapped, turning away from Sherlock. "Because I'm pretty sure 'physical withdrawal' is something you could have mentioned!"
“As I told you yesterday, Doctor Watson,” the sergeant said, “I need to speak to
Puzzled, John looked around the cluttered bedroom, and on the back of the wardrobe there was hung a blue robe. John had ignored it the night before, thinking it another piece of Sherlock’s detritus, but as he took it down he realized it wasn’t the right size for Sherlock. The sleeves were too short.
They stared at one another, silently. Sherlock had what John was starting to think of as his immovable expression on. The trouble with it was that Sherlock did not seem to grasp how stubborn John could be right back. “How in the seven hells can someone so observant miss something so painfully
him,” Sherlock said with a vicious little smile.
Dr. Watson, Greg thought, deserved better. It could be reasonably assumed that the doctor was Sherlock’s partner, and that deserved some respect.
London felt
For a moment, John’s hope surged in him.
“Of course you’re likely correct,” Sherlock allowed as the two of them skirted around a small parade of strollers on the sidewalk up from the tube, “I’d come to the same conclusion, given her last point of contact. Still, I missed something. What’s in the park?”
She added, “And I could say the same about you.”
into the skip bodily. The pipe went to the ground, clattering away, and it left both John and his attacker weaponless except for their fists.
Harry was a bit of a handful, though she was still mostly asleep. John fought briefly with her flailing arms, pleased at least that the bruises she had didn’t indicate any altercations worse than falling over, and that he hadn’t found any needle marks. Once, years ago when he was still in med school, he’d found one, and it had terrified him when she wouldn’t wake up to answer what it was.
The park was empty, at least from the distance of the entrance. If John were in another mood, he might not risk the possibility that the park wasn’t empty as it looked. But he was, still, pissed. He tucked his hands into his jacket pockets and headed into the park.
again by the time they were back at the flat.
A rough grip on the front of his jacket caught him, and John was turned sharply by the man he’d run into. John briefly caught a glimpse of a second man standing behind the other one, with an awful looking pipe in one hand, before he was slammed face-first into the wall.
“What’s her name?”
His John, who was currently asleep, sagged against his side trustingly. The flight was a smooth one, with only Mycroft's frown as turbulence. In slumber, John had slipped down a little.  At once Sherlock wanted to bury his nose in John's neck and to force him down and demand answers. To quell the urge, Sherlock shifted against the seat, turning his face away from the scent of his lovely, infuriating John.
"Which of us is clever?" John asked, grinning back.
have paperwork to do.
It was like they were trying to teach John something with all their stories.
A yawning, disheveled Anne met them in the room where the wolves had changed the night before. She gave Sherlock a knowing wink before tucking Connie against her shoulder and heading off down a hall somewhere.
“Mm.”
The climb up the hill was slow going. Sherlock seemed to have no trouble with it, but John was not as well off. Either prophetic or just terribly observant, Sherlock was right about his shoulder. It ached with the cold, and the rest of him seemed to be having sympathy pains. The pace was slow enough, though, to make up for it.
"There's a private medical facility in Dresden where your implants will be removed."
"I was on a course of antibiotics in a military hospital, so I can't really tell you how I was taken from there, I had a nasty fever at the time. I knew we were in Russia because I was in another facility before they brought me to yours." John took a breath, but hurried on before Sherlock could ask where the facility was or for any other detail that might be nagging at him. "Not every single person they employed was aware of how top secret the operation was. My nurse in Bratsk took a liking to me and practiced her English on me."
One of the others seemed to have had a dream worse than John’s.
Lestrade chuckled at that.
Unlike Horatio, Temperance was tall, looking more in the style of Sherlock himself, and a golden blond. She stood beside a broad shouldered man, John assumed this to be her mate, just as tall and blond as she was. When John followed Sherlock into the main hall she looked directly at John with a calculating look on her face before stepping past Elisabeth towards them.
A few weeks ago - it couldn’t be more than two, could it? - that wasn’t a strange way to wake up. It was less strange waking up naked with Sherlock than it was that they were in a high-security cell somewhere in Russia.
“Too late,” the sergeant said. “With the amount I’ve been running in to you this week, it’s almost social. That means manners.”
The pulsar that was his mate came speeding back towards them. He felt Sherlock enter the building.
John could see the hole in the mess set aside specifically for him, they had strongly disagreed about the state of the sitting room – when was that? Could it have only been the day before?
“Did you deduce that?” John asked, resisting the urge to huff. Enough of this talking, and even he was starting to second guess his plan.
“Someone want to catch me up?” Lestrade asked the PCO that was standing awkwardly near the door, keeping an eye on the bloody man on the couch and, possibly, the blond man sipping the tea. It was hard to tell though, the blond man might have been eying the PCO.
thrust their hips together. There wasn’t enough friction, but watching what Sherlock was doing with his mouth would make John lose it if he didn’t do
“Would you suffer through your mate being altered by medication?” Sherlock asked dismissively, flattening the file on the table top. He was finished with the reports and had moved on to the pictures.
John was staring at him. Sherlock wondered, momentarily, if he had presented the situation poorly.
about Sherlock-
Sherlock puffed up, sucking in a breath to launch into what was, John could tell, undoubtedly a rather righteous streak of insults, or possibly a graphic description of just what the two of them had gotten up to that morning and likely would be up to now if the unfortunate man hadn’t intruded on them. Neither of those would keep Sherlock out of handcuffs.
“So that… during the separation…”
“Half eleven,” Sherlock replied absently, paying far too much attention to the food he was working on.
“I fail to see how looking for plates is ridiculous,” John replied, quirking a brow.
No sense reflecting on what he had thought before he was mated, then. Sherlock sipped his tea, leaning against the wall beside the window and looking out onto Montague street below.
Sherlock’s lips found the soft skin behind John’s ear and he all but purred, “I disagree.”
From the corner of his eye, John saw his mate still and felt the first tinge of agitation from him. No, Sherlock was no better at containing his feelings than before. He simply hadn’t cared until he’d been annoyed.
Wrapped up in his thoughts, John barely heard the commotion behind him. Halfway to the front stairs he was aware of Sherlock following behind him.
Rather than focus on his own discomfort, John returned his energy to getting the blood out of the cushions.
“What time is it?” John asked, setting out the utensils as Sherlock opened the containers.
“I am within my own flat,” Sherlock retorted. “If I chose to remain naked, that is my own concern.”
It fit perfectly.
"We've begun our descent into Dresden," Mycroft said, retaking the seat opposite them. "Your Captain Watson will most likely wish to be covered up in the cold."
"The others?"
“Get some rest, John. Sherlock,” Lestrade said, nodding to the taller man.
“She gave you the phone, which you refuse to use.”
John sighed.
She was still drunk, but she was here. Time was if she was drunk, the rest of the world could go fuck itself.
Obviously the adrenaline had jump-started the metabolic processes. Sherlock looked more sober already.
“This weekend,” he replied.
The telling took the late hours and made them early. John grew sleepy, and Sherlock let him rest, stroking his hair to help him nod off without asking him to reciprocate.
As John closed the door, the bow caught on a single note, and then Sherlock’s tune changed. The agitated notes notes became longer, more contemplative. Sherlock swayed slightly, body bending and half-turning towards the door.
"For the record," John said, drawing both gazes towards him, "I'm fine. Aside being randy like a second former, that is."
Sherlock made a soft noise that wasn’t a word at all, and squeezed his hand.
A third swing, lower this time, aimed at John’s shoulder. John sidestepped, and the pipe slammed into the skip. His attacker was just enough surprised by that for John to shove
terrified John as suddenly as the nightmares he’d had in Bratsk. This time he didn’t have to suffer through and hope that morning looked better, though.
"A dream, John," Sherlock said. Despite - perhaps because of? - their earlier argument, Sherlock's voice was low and worried. Wide eyes stared into John’s from up close. "I'm- You're alright. Just a dream."
“You smell like that skip,” John said, wrinkling his nose.
“Something you wish to share, brother?”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Sherlock said from behind him, amid the rustling of the bag, “forks.”
“I would prefer if you opened the door, John,” the clipped voice of Mycroft Holmes cut through the door.
“I suppose they are rather... lively.”
And then there was Sergeant Lestrade - who obviously knew Sherlock-
“The cut wasn’t
John pulled the jumper over his head and tossed it on the back of the couch, away from the blood spots. He unbuttoned the cuffs of his shirt, and saw the way Sherlock’s eyes locked on to him undressing. He could feel his mate’s interest.
That was about when the doctor began treating John as though he'd lost a part of his mind.
“I’m not a part of violent crimes, Sherlock,” the sergeant said.
“Two at once, I see,” Mycroft said with a scowl.
John could only see the shoulder of his fatigue jacket, but it was enough to catch the man’s rank even if he couldn’t see the name on the front of it. “I’ll try not to bother you too much then, Colonel.”
“Sentiment, John,” Sherlock replied, “what
Sometimes what he anticipated as simple became difficult. The aftermath of that introduction was still echoing through their relationship.
John opened his mouth, and then he closed it. There was nothing. The memory was gone, but the sense of it was there. He turned in to Sherlock’s embrace, burying his face against his mate’s stomach.
“Tried that, he’s not answering.”
Still, Sherlock hadn’t said anything, and John didn’t have all his fancy werewolf senses to catch little things like that.
There was a man on the other side of the door. An average looking man, or at least John thought he was, in a somewhat expensive shirt. He was on the far side of twenty, probably somewhere just shy of thirty, with thinning hair and a rather unfortunate mustache. He looked as though he had been on the wrong end of a fight. There was blood coming from a most likely broken nose, and gashes on one side of his face that disappeared up into his receding hairline. He didn’t seem to see John opening the door, he staggered quickly past him into the flat.
For a moment neither said anything, but Sherlock watched his face with a melancholy look, and John managed a smile for him. “Sherlock?”
The lead scientist - John realized that though he’d been told the man’s name he couldn’t recall it, just another body on the floor in their wake - had come to him just before the moon.
“You overdosed.”
John had a sour taste in his mouth, one that he hated. It was bitterness. Nothing bad had happened, precisely, but any time he had this sort of pain in him he just couldn’t seem to shake the miasma.
The brief sensation of falling - being tackled, really - ended with a dull impact onto the bed. Sherlock made short work of John’s trousers, and between them John got naked and more clothes found their way to the floor. As Sherlock sat up to strip his shirt off, John couldn’t help but chuckle out, “You must be hell on housekeeping.”
With the door to the hall safely shut, John relaxed the grip he was keeping on his temper. He decided to clean up the broken cup and the spilled tea, which had been abandoned during the explanations.
“Was he acting suspiciously at all, Captain?”
Sherlock took it. As he wrapped his fingers around the mug, they brushed John’s, and for the briefest of moments the activity of the room was gone and all there was in the whole room was John’s blue eyes and the warmth in their hands.
“The Holmeses are afficionados,” Gerard said. “It helps ease the tension when there’s so many of them in one place.”
“Deduce,” Sherlock corrected.
The woman eyed him in the glass, and Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Mister Holmes, I’ll have to advise you, again, that the pair of you are not without suspicion in this instance. What’s happened to Mister Milton will be under investigation, and any attempts at coercion or bribery will be met with the appropriate response.”
Sherlock continued checking him over, but stilled. "Words, John. What hurt?"
The thought was surprisingly disheartening. John shifted, uncomfortable with the discussion, suddenly. He both wanted and didn't want to know who the other person was, who all the other people were.
Looking over at the doctor, Greg felt wrong for asking Sherlock to come in for questioning.
so that they would always be touching. It was a relief, it was a blessing, but it was too much. He ached for it at the same time it was happening to him. He tilted his head back and closed his eyes against the tears that threatened.
“He’s said it,” Sherlock huffed, “that ought to mean that he’s sure about it.”
“Right,” John said, sipping his own too-hot tea. He sat in the armchair and took in his brother-in-law with the beginnings of a scowl. “Well, I’d offer you a place to sit, but we’re a bit shy on the moment. I’m not sure what Sherlock has on the chairs in the kitchen.”
Another flex of muscles brought Sherlock over, and Mycroft dunked Sherlock’s face into the sink full of cold water.
“John Watson,” the blond man said.
“No,” John cut him off, aware of where that sentence was going without needing to sense Sherlock’s emotions to sort it out. “I’m saying there’s a gap in my understanding. We know there is. We’ve talked about that.”
And didn’t
Usually
“I believe that was your phone.”
In response, a cup of tea was held up for him.
"You never said a word about-"
"Not as such," Mycroft replied.
“You’ll still have to come down to the station, Sherlock,” the sergeant said.
The teacup was extended on its saucer. John glanced up at Mycroft from where he was working, and Sherlock snorted. Mycroft was forced to set the teacup and saucer on the nearest bookshelf.
Even the diagnosis that he disagreed with.
“We’re going out, then,” Sherlock said, head tipping to the side as he regarded John’s expression. He gently liberated the phone from John’s hand, setting it aside.
“Bit distracted,” John said, finding a further impediment to liberating the up-ended kettle. It was stuck on something. John tightened his grip on the handle and gave it a yank. The kettle came free, but so did several of the larger pieces of glassware, followed by several of the smaller pieces with questionable stains on them. The glassware rolled across the countertop and then crashed to the floor in a small avalanche that quickly turned into a sea of shards very dangerous to bare feet. “Bollocks.”
There seemed no response coming from Sherlock. John put his head against Sherlock’s arm again, closing his eyes. This time the noise of the water didn’t bother him, he had the noise of Sherlock’s breathing to stay him.
“As I said, people are tediously slow,” he repeated.
“Then how do you mean?”
“I remembered the tea.”
The whole day they had been half-challenges and standoffs, and John had been suppressing his temper because he had absolutely no idea how to approach the situation. Sherlock hadn’t even mentioned what he might expect. His reaction felt stupid and childish. John was glad to meet them, glad to find that Sherlock wasn’t alone in the world, but he absolutely hated being handled like he was a child or worse, that he was made of glass.
worth it.
“You said ‘the pictures’,” John said. Sherlock didn’t react to that, so no, that mustn’t be what he was concerned about. Something else, then. “What was supposed to be ‘just you’, Sherlock? You
Both wolves stilled.
“Sher-”
John slowed his cleaning, afraid he might punch the man who was already unconscious for things he had not been witness to but nonetheless got his blood boiling. “What, precisely, did he deal you?”
Not that it was any of John’s business, so long as the sergeant didn’t try to arrest either of them for a crime they didn’t commit, but… the man
Sherlock loved London. It was impossible to miss the vivid way he described the streets and scents of the sprawling metropolis. John was almost jealous of hearing Sherlock speak that way about it, but a firm grope and a lingering snog settled him a bit, and then Sherlock’s excited, “I cannot wait to have you in London, John,” was enough to set any jealousy to rest.
“For heaven’s sake, Mycroft, it’s not what you think,” Sherlock said as he answered it, turning for the bedroom. A scowl took over his expression as he walked. “I’ve explained-”
"No," Sherlock growled at him. The tall body crowded up against John's back, but John didn’t lean into that wanted contact. He held his ground, only flinching when Sherlock said, "I just got you back, I'm not letting you go again."
had no proper kettle, and set the teapot onto the hob to warm. Sherlock continued playing while John set about making tea - the last of the tea, which was a problem that would have to be sorted in short order, along with the missing kettle - and ignored John when he came in and set the teacup down on the desk beside him.
"That's not what you mean."
“Yes,” John replied, “I am me.”
His mate settled, stroking his spine in all the stiff places in a way that was slightly uncomfortable but perfect. Sherlock’s touch left John’s back at ease, and Sherlock curled closer around him reinforced the sensation. “Sleep,” Sherlock offered, “it’ll be brunch today.”
“We haven’t the time,” Sherlock said, in a tone that suggested he was reminding himself more than chiding John.
"You sleep too much. Even Russia's only so big," Sherlock said. "If I'd had at you properly, we'd be in Dresden before we were finished."
A firm press of those clever fingers cut John's words off for him. Sherlock shifted up, leaning against his back to press lips against his ear. "You
For many obvious reasons, John needed to exist in England again.
“Probably ought to get used to this,” John said, mostly to himself, though he drew the eyes of an OAP sorting through the canned goods. “Doubt he’s much of one for shopping.”
, not existing. We would never have met, Sherlock, if you had died in the sergeant’s bathroom.”
John grasped Rawden’s hand. They shook, and then a firm hand gripped John by the shoulder. Rawden pulled John close, nose sniffing his neck in the familiar way he'd experienced all day from the pack. A very low voice rumbled to him, "Be good to my son."
Sherlock seemed to take offense to Milton sitting on the couch. He stared down the intruder, almost to the point of ignoring when John asked, “Medicine kit?”
They were barely in the door when Sherlock started to ask something, only to be cut off by the chime of his mobile from his jacket pocket.
"Come now John, you're a doctor. If my presence at your side induces a particular rise in serotonin levels, a release of oxytocin, wouldn't it stand
Sherlock made an eloquent gesture in John’s direction.
“I doubt the sergeant would be so invested in you that he’d personally come and be the officer at a crime scene for you if that’s where the story ended,” John said. “If it were just that he’d have taken you in for questioning.”
Here, then, was the group of men that he was to go back to England with.
John cut Sherlock off with a kiss and said, "Any more all at once and I won't be able to remember them all."
“Mm,” Sherlock acknowledged, but didn’t sound like he was paying attention to what was being said.
But Sherlock wouldn’t answer with more than a slight shake of his head. He leaned down in an impossible curve of his spine, and kissed John firmly on the lips.
“What can we do for you today, sir?” a helpful clerk asked him, interrupting the vertigo that had taken over.
John backtracked the gray days of their separation as his mate spoke. He felt nothing but honesty, with a tinge of chagrin along with it. And then John felt it himself.
Sherlock grew agitated when he was pushed away, and once he was let back in… Well. The entire train ride Sherlock had spent pressed against John’s side and staring out the windows. Any time someone in the car moved past them or an attendant stopped to check in on them, Sherlock rose up to his full seated height and glared.
Sherlock couldn't remember more about what had happened in Maiwand. The trouble was the battle had been brought to his attention by Mycroft, and most often Mycroft's casual mentioning of things was an attempt to pique Sherlock's curiosity to get him to do abysmally tedious work. Sherlock had trained himself to answer noncommittally whenever Mycroft mentioned current events without retaining much of the facts his brother spoke. From what little he had retained from Mycroft's natterings, Sherlock knew that the wolves in the area had originally resolved to remain out of the conflict. Non-involvement was the general consensus among them all as it was inadvisable to end up in a human hospital being examined by human doctors. Whatever had been happening in Afghanistan, then, something must have gone wrong. The fighting had spilled over into some place that the wolves had to keep safe, or something more personal had caused the attack. John wouldn't know, of course. It was unlikely John knew anything about the wolves that had attacked his unit.
Also, as a point of order, Mycroft is wrong. Dresden, Germany fell within Eastern Germany, and thus would have been a part of the Eastern Bloc.
What was worse, he had no idea how to avert what he sensed was coming.
A deceptively thin arm slid around John, and Sherlock pulled them both to their feet. “Let’s return, then.”
“I was the one attacked,” Watson said.
At precisely nine-forty-two he was interrupted by banging on the door.
Lestrade gathered all of his remaining patience as he headed down the hall to where the door stood open and he could see the arm of another CSO. There was even the same dent and scratch in the wood of the open door. This was the same door, alright. He stopped in the doorway for a final breath to himself, hoping to survey the scene a bit before Sherlock began his rather-overwhelming dialog about whatever had happened.
Sherlock could think and say what he liked, but right now the flat was too small for all of John’s agitation. Walking had always been a good way to clear his head, even if it was rather late at night for it.
John chuckled. The rewrite of the story he'd been imaging of Sherlock's childhood took another turn, and now he could see a young Sherlock and a young-er Mycroft tormenting one another and acting much more like siblings.
but there was nothing about those feelings that was even remotely like what had come crashing down.
As always, thank you for reading. It was a pleasure to have you come along with me and the boys.
John had almost forgotten that Horatio was at the table. It was odd, that. Glancing over at him, though, it became apparent that Horatio was enjoying the little domestic scene playing out before him, even with his nose tucked into the newspaper.
The sharp, unfiltered sting of the blow drew John to instant attention. That was a very good thing, because when he was paying attention, he at least stood a chance of not needing reconstructive surgery at the end of this. John was even a bit of a boxer, though this wasn’t the same. There was a measured sort of back and forth of what would belong in a ring, but this was a street fight. What did John a better turn was that he had a better awareness of his surroundings than the pipe-wielder. As they traded swings, John managed to back him across the fallen bag with the kettle in its box.
Everything went white with pleasure.
“Would you like to come see the old place?” Stamford said.
“What?” John asked.
“The police have cars.”
“You are supposed to be watching
This time when John caught Sherlock's wrist it was gentle, because he understood. The whole world had fallen out when he'd seen blood in the snow around Sherlock. And then he'd felt his stomach turn into a knot when he'd seen Sherlock stumble in the snow towards the chopper, covered in blankets.
had become just
He winced further at that.
Sherlock kissed him, then, right in the middle of the crime scene. It was hot, and John surrendered to it willingly. Sherlock’s interest was infectious. John did, however, manage to keep from getting an erection in the middle of it all, but it was a near thing. Sherlock pressed their foreheads together and closed his eyes for a moment. “Correct,” he said, still grinning.
Elisabeth looked at Sherlock for a moment before turning to John, a smile playing across her lips. “My dear John,” she said, “do I understand you correctly?”
- to give it any attention. He was feeling it, after all, and that was enough. He was a mess with shaking hands and half-crossed eyes and a shooting pain in his hip that gave him a limp.
Released from stillness, it seemed, by Watson’s gaze, Sherlock reached forward and covered the doctor’s hand with the tea towel. It was bizarre to watch the scene play out before him, as though both men were moving through some unwritten script. Watson said nothing, but didn’t protest or lash out, as Greg feared any interference of his own might induce. He knelt there, left arm twitching slightly, sagged slightly forward, and let Sherlock wrap the tea towel around his injury.
to be so deeply in touch with his mate. His conclusion, as time drew on and he found his way through the depths of John's tumult, was that John seemed to be
Mycroft straightened his cuffs.
There were things that would have to happen to fit John into Sherlock’s life, to physically shoehorn him into the flat and make it more livable by his standards. And there was John’s family to see to, because Harry would be calling (she was a Watson, afterall). And if it had been over twenty days, then it would be just about the time for the moon, which meant going back out to Wiltshire. But they would work all that out later. They had time.
“Annoyed,” Sherlock said.
There was fallout, of course.
“Making my own breakfast.”
No. John
After the weeks of trouble, sleep without the pain ought to have been blissful, but instead the darkness behind John’s eyelids tormented him. He was back in the over-sized house that was a menacing sketch of the real one in Wiltshire.
John knelt beside Harriet. She hated that name, but in that moment as he checked her pulse, her temperature, made sure that there wasn’t anything wrong with her beyond a vicious blood alcohol level and a serious need of a shower, John hated his sister.
John surveyed his options - blood-stained couch, floor, or hard wooden kitchen chair - and dragged the chair in from the kitchen to sit on. “Alright. Go on.”
“That was the assumption, but it was incorrect,” Sherlock said, closing his eyes and reliving the room. It didn’t bring the same rush of pleasure to see the crime scene in his mind, the clarity of the room he could reconstruct was cold and factual. It had been a messy scene, to be sure, but now that it was solved it was as dead and empty as the bodies it had held. “The police assumed from the chaos of the room that the escalated violence of the murder was caused by recognition on the part of the victim. It was a gruesome affair, seemingly the man had been attacked from two different angles, by two separate attackers.”
At full volume.
phone if you leave it at the flat when you are
That meant... Horatio
Lestrade narrowed his eyes at Sherlock, an expression telegraphed by the guttural noise he made more than by sight as Sherlock was still looking at John. Sherlock ignored him for the moment, preferring to concentrate on the sensation of John melted into him. John was warmer, he found as his fingers brushed the man’s temple. Not warm enough to be an infection setting in, but still something to take note of.
"Jesus, I'll never make it off the plane," John moaned as Sherlock squeezed him. By then, John was clutching Sherlock's shoulder with one hand and had the other threaded into his mate's hair.
At some point in the nightmare, John started screaming. He must have, because his throat was sore as he woke, and the room sounded quiet the way quiet only feels after a loud noise. He only woke because Sherlock intruded, and despite knowing from experience that it was a
ONE MORE TO GO IN THIS STORY!!! WHOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
to yourself speak?” Sherlock grumbled.
The plane, of course.
Sherlock all but jerked to a stop, turning on him. In three strides he was back and had a hand out in a demanding gesture.
From personal experience, Mycroft knew that Sherlock
John didn’t want to hold Sherlock’s hand. More precisely he didn’t want to
What there
John didn’t know which detective had been interviewing Sherlock, but he was pretty sure that Sherlock was either being left alone to consider his attitude or was more officially cooling his heels in a cell somewhere. In the meantime, John and the sergeant -
"Loosely," Mycroft said primly. "You are an incompetent liar. There were several holes that had to be corrected."
“Sometimes a specific
Sherlock’s eyes opened, and the look he was giving John was all predator in the best way possible. “This is one of the few instances in which the obvious is…” he started, cutting himself off. Sherlock repeated, “You want me.”
“Whatever idiotic interference you are contemplating, desist,” Sherlock snapped. He swung the bag he was carrying at Greg and blustered into the kitchen.
“Well it’s not like I’d had time to update my emergency contact paperwork,” John defended.
It turned out to be a very good thing that they were given a few hours to themselves.
“Please, enlighten me,” Sherlock sneered.
Hours later, John woke to an insistent pounding on the door. Beneath him, Sherlock seemed to snap awake as well, which meant they both must have been sleeping. It was a novel concept, considering how much sleep Sherlock seemed to avoid on a weekly basis. Maybe, John thought, it was the sex. It had been very good sex, he thought, and he’d certainly been boneless and flat on his back tired afterward.
From the car the three of them got onto a plane. John was given a file to study.
“Apparently you
like it had passed as opposed to how much
The morning sun shone on John’s blond hair. The light made the gray sprinkled in it blend in with the soft yellow. There was a softening affect to the lines of his face and the lines
“My research notes,” Sherlock said with a lofty snort, folding his hands behind his head.
“I am certain the doctors in the facility will treat John in the manner they see fit,” Mycroft replied.
There was no way that this was pillow talk, which meant Sherlock had been awake and thinking through this for a while. John felt a chill as he realized what Sherlock was referring to.
gained ~30% of its word count during editing pre-posting. We began around 28,000 words, and we’re ending at over 40,000. I know it takes me a while, dear readers, but I hope it’s been worth the wait.
The garbage heap of a man huffed out a chuckle. “Looks like we’ve got a stand-up act h-”
The return to Montague street from Wiltshire that moon was rose-tinted and unrealistically light-hearted. Sunday evening, after Horatio and Anne had taken Connie home, Sherlock had explained that Connie’s curiosity was unusual for a wolf her age. Elisabeth, who had joined them again at that point, had added that it was best to discourage the young from
A text from Mycroft interrupted his searching, and only the knowledge that hurling the phone into the wall would mean getting up to reacquire it and disturbing John kept Sherlock from throwing it.
John said, taking his hands off dressing Milton’s wounds before he managed to injure the drug addict worse than he already was.
“Most people call me John.”
John didn’t particularly want to open the door this time either, but he had a sinking feeling that whatever Mycroft would do otherwise would be unpleasant. He rose from where he was working on the couch and went to let Mycroft in.
“I know that,” John said. “This
Mycroft had not been
"Mm," Sherlock agreed, nipping his shoulder.
Sherlock closed his mouth, frowning. It only lasted a moment before he said, “This is no way to make up, John. I can’t apologize if I’m being silent. Why would you ask for that, of all things?”
The only answer Sherlock gave was the vicious twist of the deadbolts.
“Sure.”
John lifted his hand obligingly, stifling the noise of protest he felt at having all the warmth gone around them. Sherlock gave a shallow thrust against him and parted his lips to John’s fingers.
“Still a bit obvious, John said, but his words lacked their earlier sarcasm.
The anger flared.
“Got it,” John replied.
, as Elisabeth had indicated they would need to, at least John could tell his feelings from Sherlock’s, and in an extreme sort of a way, he could dampen them.
Sherlock was smoothing John’s hair from his temple when Lestrade made a little noise.
it felt as though there had been nothing before him.
John wasn’t sure he was relieved to hear he would be coming ‘off the hall’.
John ground his teeth together, feeling the beginning of a headache he was only used to getting with particularly unreasonable COs. "Precisely
“No thank you, Mister Watson,” the PCO replied.
He had been wondering what it meant since it started, but the longer it went on the more troubling it was.
Asking the same questions again a day later wasn’t worth anyone’s time.
“Lestrade was the nearest police officer to a murder I happened upon.”
Sherlock pressed his lips together, straightening up well within John’s personal space and inspecting him for a moment. Reading him, deducing him, whatever.
It was all surprisingly relaxed and easy.
Being told that he was no longer a part of the army hurt. It subtracted him down to
John leaned into it, feeling the affection. He clung to that feeling, tightening his arms around Sherlock until he had to break the kiss to yawn. “That said. It’s the arse end of the day, and I’m knackered.”
“Tell me,” John repeated, reaching out a hand to Sherlock’s cheek.
"It's a pleasure to meet you both," John said, trying a hand at soothing the lot of them. It wasn't the first time he'd had his height pointed out to him, and he doubted it would be the last.
“I did.”
“Oh god, John,” she huffed into his neck.
“Shall we be off, John?” Sherlock had asked, tone just different enough that John noticed the change in it.
Draft version now at 38K. I didn't realize I was writing a book series. ^_^;
Connie bit at his pantleg, and Sherlock gave a very human sort of a shrug before picking Connie up and tossing her playfully.
Georgiana's mate was was a female werewolf by the name of Durga, who looked to be from India and had an accent to go along with it. She looked oddly familiar, but John couldn't place her. She was as friendly as Horatio, with an easy smile and a tendency to play peacemaker. They also lived in Bristol, and apparently Georgiana was a bank manager. Durga was in communications. Again, John got the impression that she had been an acquaintance of Mycroft’s.
Sherlock didn’t bother to deny it.
If Temperance had any sort of comment, it was lost when the blond man stepped over. John's hand was taken from her and a pointed sniff was given. "Charles," the man said, eying John a moment before turning to his mate. "I thought he'd be younger. Or taller."
Greg wanted to laugh at that, for some reason that he couldn’t fathom. Something about the short man nonchalantly declaring something like that was worth a chuckle. But that would be utterly inappropriate. This was at least partially a crime scene, and this man could very well be a suspect. “And you are?”
In a city the size of London, John didn’t expect he’d go unnoticed forever, but he wasn’t sure who it was that had called out to him. He turned, surveyed the path, and saw a rounded man waving to him. He nodded back, heading over.
in two varieties - as Sherlock had not yet stated a preference for a particular blend or kind - and a kettle. He wasn’t too worried about the sturdiness of it, something told him that nothing would last long in their kitchen.
was an in-processing. John was ushered into one of the re-purposed buildings, some basic information taken from him, his dog-tags checked, and then he was put in a room with a table and two chairs. A bland-looking lieutenant came in and went over some very broad particulars, the sort of thing that verified that he was, indeed, Captain John Hamish Watson of the RAMC. Time passing in the windowless room with its lack of windows and regulation lighting was only tellable by how sore the uncomfortable chairs made his ass. It must have been an hour, maybe more?
His mate came back, tossed a roll of gauze on the bed. Sherlock was no doctor, but the worst of what had happened was past. Agile fingers smoothed antiseptic across the angry wounds, and then the gauze was up and wrapped. The whole procedure was done first on his right arm where the damage was worse, and then repeated on his left.
“Yeah,” John replied, feeling defensive.
Cleaning blood out of upholstery was a thankless job.
It only served to annoy Sherlock, a sensation fueled by being reminded of how everything had gone so spectacularly to shit. He bit back the snarl that threatened, unwilling to disturb John, and settled for snapping, "As vexing as I am certain my lack of foresight for the well-equipped, well-informed-"
“There’s too much blood,” John said aloud.
So for the American readers out there, and I apologize if you already know this but I spent quite a while confused as hell when I started reading this fandom, public school in the UK seems to be akin to private school in the States. (Or boarding school, I believe.)
“Particularly that the visitor was one of Sherlock’s former dealers. John, I had not thought we would need to discuss what is best for Sherlock, but obviously there is to be no further recreational usage of that sort.”
“They said you were dead.” Harry wrapped her hands around her own cup and blew on the hot liquid. Her voice was gruff, either from drink or the weather, but it suited what John supposed was a black stab at humor. “Well. That’s not how they put it, of course. Some utter twaddle about ‘missing in action, presumed’ and all that. But the notice was pretty clear. They never expected to find you.”
“Not enough blood?”
"I suppose I would make your life easier if you could convince me to heel like-"
It was an awkward sort of phrasing, and the way it came out made John wonder how good the man was at his job. John knew he had a temper, he knew there were times he had come across
“I have no idea how to use this thing,” he sighed.
John thought he had been welcomed home that night on the sofa, but it was nothing as thorough as what he felt by the third evening. He was not a little bit sore, as well. He loved all of it.
"You assume that will be enough," Sherlock purred, tugging John's legs up over his to get closer.
" 'I'm very rarely wrong'," John parroted back to himself, thinking of the smug grin on Sherlock's lips when he had explained exactly how 'easy' this leaving the army thing was supposed to be.
put him off balance, propped up only by Sherlock. Trustingly so. John’s hand was shaking, and that was troubling, but there was nothing to be done about it at the moment.
“She slept through the night,” Sherlock replied, holding the coffee out.
Thank you all for your lovely comments. I've had to keep quiet on them because I don't want to spoil the ending with my glee at discussing what Sherlock's actually up to, etc. Also, my apologies for the delay in posting. I've been working on author-things outside of fandom, and they've eaten up more of my time than I'd like. (Creating a mailing list is hard, folks. I keep toying with the idea of having one for my fanfiction writing, but that will have to wait until after I understand how they work int he first place!)
It was only as Sherlock’s trousers hit the floor that John realized there were little tears in them.
"Temperance," Sherlock greeted neutrally.
John felt like he had sprung a leak somewhere, and he was losing the contents of himself out of it. He thought he'd hit five days without Sherlock, and he wagered that if he listened hard enough when he was eating he might actually hear the food fall into the space emptying out inside of him. He imagined that the sound of the impact would echo on his inner walls.
When Sherlock’s tongue slid out to stroke John’s fingers, John
John stared at the phone and wished he couldn’t hear Harriet’s playful, sober voice croon out,
“No matter what you and
The first time Sherlock had gotten into the liquor cabinet he’d actually turned green before he’d lost the contents of his stomach in a disobliged linen closet.
Sherlock watched him go, and knew without a doubt that John was worth all of this trouble. Every single bit of it was worth less than John was, and even despite their argument, John was still with him. John was still thinking about him.
Somewhere between Paris and London, John managed to catch his breath - something he hadn’t even realized was a problem prior to taking a suddenly unhindered inhale - and the gray that had taken over his vision became less of a haze. The world of gray became more articulate at first, and then even the gray cast of things began to let up as the train had sped him towards London.
There were drinks in the library for those that were wanting to stay up. All the middle generation, siblings and mates included, decided to. Sherlock followed them in, so John went along as well. Again the quantity of couches made sense, the worn-in old leather was meant for wolves to sit upon. John was given the impression that the pack would all be in residence at the manor that evening, which might have been problematic in a smaller house, but there was more than enough room for them. It didn’t prevent squabbling among the middle generation, though. Sherlock kept John in sight despite engaging in a heated discussion with Temperance and Marianne about what they ought not be trying to say about him.
Those words struck him. A fuzzy memory from a bloody sandpit came to mind. A slender body dragging a larger one, a barely breathing comrade stubbornly pulled from danger.
“You’re actually serious,” the sergeant concluded.
No, Doctor Watson was a doctor.
The tea was settled away as the afternoon turned towards evening, and two sets of austere looking persons were brought in to join them. The room had seemed quite full by the time Emeric Lachance and his mate Daphne came in with Adrien and Viola Fairfax joined them.
When they collapsed onto the hospital-grade sheets, John shivered. Too familiar.
“As in good, as in sexy.”
Lestrade absolutely had to know how John Watson had managed to do that. Sherlock had an impertinent tongue in his head to go with the razor wit and the catalog of bad habits he’d picked up from… whatever public school he’d gone to. It had taken the threat of actual incarceration to shut Sherlock’s mouth on their last meeting. This was… amazing, really.
Sherlock's responding erection was nudging against John's leg, even through all the clothes, but when John reached for him, Sherlock caught his wrist and kissed it.
Sherlock said, almost in unison with the Clara on the phone.
“Updated,” John mumbled into Sherlock’s neck.
The problem remained, however, that something was troubling John. His mate was unsettled, unhappy, and Sherlock did not know the source or the solution.
John hadn’t bothered to look at the wounds on his arms while he had been in Germany. He left that to the doctors and nurses. He’d barely registered their cleaning, in the days that had followed the fight, hadn’t the strength to care about it. Now they seemed important, if only because Sherlock was noticing them. So when Sherlock climbed atop his hips and lifted his arms up, John joined him in looking.
that was present when he did it. He clenched his fist, feeling the tightening of the bandage and the pull of the wound as a pleased little sting against the emptiness of the room. “It’s not the cut.”
“If it’s all the same, I’ll wait,” Watson said. He poked his head back out into the hall and looked up and down it. “Is there a lobby or… a waiting area?”
This time, Sherlock seemed to have no comment to offer.
They had a train to catch.
“Constable Trimble got called in by the CSO that took the initial,” Dotty said. “Told him you asked for a courtesy on it, and he said that if you made it before the tosser got himself into handcuffs, you were welcome to talk to him.”
into the trees once Connie had settled on his lap. And, given John’s dreams, whatever running he had done must have been considerably more than ‘stretching his legs’.
“Like I’ve gotten into a fight with heavy machinery,” John replied.
They were about the same height, though she was thinner than he was, so John bundled her into his robe and tucked her into bed.
“You make me sound like a vampire,” Sherlock muttered. “You enjoyed it.”
“Of course not.”
“How?”
“Bin the couch,” John said, tugging his sleeves down. He put on his jacket and headed out of the flat.
Sherlock had been about to reply. He cut himself off mid-sentence, but glared.
The feeling of absence was insistent, for a moment, and John barely managed to keep from bolting from the hospital in the direction of the flat. Instead he did the reasonable thing, and pointed out the time, excusing himself from the chat. Mike nodded, and gave John his cell phone number, extracting a promise from him to catch up at a pub soon - “We won’t tell the wife,” Mike said, with a conspiratory wink, “beer’s right out of the diet.” - before they said their goodbyes.
how things were supposed to be. The flat wasn’t supposed to be the bloody tarmac for the MPD. It wasn’t that John wanted more closed doors in his life, not after the last seven months. But this was the same loss of privacy from Russia. This was the same feeling of eyes on him.
it so much, so quickly.
Mycroft anything and likely did not know any other Watsons to contact in this situation.
“That so?” John asked, splaying his fingers against Sherlock’s waist. He squeezed him gently.
The sergeant took a note, and John withheld a wince and a curse. He wasn’t staying in the service, of course, he had Sherlock and the military would never let the two of them be together the way that civilians could chose to be, but he didn’t need the army to write him off as a nutter.
“You still can’t see a single reason-”
Watson turned, calmly, and said, “Sherlock.”
The simple statement drew the elder man's eyes back to John, and John was grateful for the military training that had him straightening his spine and standing more firmly. The old wolf's eyes were bright from within the wrinkles around them, harsh and calculating even more so than Mycroft's.
If I were being 100% timeline accurate, this chapter would have to be inserted within the previous one, however, part of the point of the last chapter was the loss of time John experiences during the separation. Thus it was impossible to be entirely accurate regarding the timing of it, though perhaps I could have positioned this before the previous chapter. Either way, this is where I placed this chapter, and I like it's positioning.
Sherlock snapped into the phone.
a key to Sherlock’s flat on Montague Street, but he did not require a key to access anything. He was, after all, the more clever of the Holmes brothers, according to popular opinion, and it was not exaggeration to say that Mycroft did certain things
“What was the sergeant doing here?”
“This is a bit much,” John said, leaning forward to set the glass on the coffee table in front of the couch. He pushed up to his feet. “I’ll just go on to bed. I’m sure I’ll see you again at breakfast.”
“Sorry, Abbey,” he said, wincing at her sigh, “I wouldn’t, but it’s dispatch.”
“Well it is
“Well I’ll be certain to tell him, though next time you decide to re-gift a present, you might consider including the charger.”
The great old house was quiet in the early morning, and John wondered what luck had gotten him somewhere like this. It was certainly worlds away from where he had expected to go after the gunshot, the hospital, and then the kidnapping. He-
Then they solved that too, because they put John on a train into London.
“Mm,” John repeated, considering.
Leaving the file where it was, Mycroft left the kitchen. He forced himself the few steps to where he had left his umbrella, hoping that Sherlock had been sober enough when his mate’s name had been invoked to take the question to heart. A childish impulse within Mycroft thought to text that to Sherlock, but for once that day he managed exemplary restraint and left his mobile in his pocket.
“It was a necessity,” Sherlock replied. “I put together the clues I’d taken in on my first visit only after I’d returned to my flat. In order to be certain I was correct I needed to compare.”
They went down to the dining room together, just like that. From the look Mycroft gave them as they came in and took their places, a look that intensified when Sherlock shifted his chair closer, Sherlock wasn't expected to be anywhere near so affectionate. John resisted the urge to huff in annoyance. It was made easier by the excellent food.
It didn’t matter.
A stab of anxiety from Sherlock jarred away the flashback.
The kind he turned accusingly on Greg.
"You looked fine on the pictures, I thought you-" Sherlock cut himself off. "I thought it would just be me." The words were spoken very softly.
On what ought to be the fourth day after the incident - which would make it the seventh since he’d left Sherlock, a nagging sensation in his gut and the back of his head reminded him - there was a therapist waiting for him to talk to.
“Doctor,” Sherlock corrected.
Years ago, John had done rotations in the A&E. It was a battleground entirely different from the one he’d gone to later. At the time it hadn’t affected him, even on the bloodier nights when his fellow doctors and the nurses were all bothered by the constant flow of injuries. John’s imperviousness to the carnage had been one of the things that settled his mind about going into the army, actually.
But then it was all cleaned up. There were no more pieces.
That was where John pictured Sherlock, though he couldn’t know yet what Sherlock’s flat looked like or remember what the neighborhood was near.
Dr. Watson continued staring at the floor as the blood soaked into the towel.
A confident smirk was John's answer. Sherlock nuzzled his neck.
“It was hot,” John replied, attempting to liberate the kettle from where it was lodged under far too much delicate looking glassware for one person to free it easily.
For my Sherlock-type personalities, of which I am coming to understand that I am one, it may be interesting to note that
John frowned. “Doesn’t sound like nothing.”
John told himself sternly as he pulled the nightshirt over his head. The admonishment did nothing to prevent him from watching Sherlock finish undressing. It did not even begin to temper the admiration in his eyes as he did so.
Instead, Dr. Watson was questioned for nearly an hour regarding his identity, his whereabouts for the past twelve hours, and his occupation.
The angry feeling gave way to wonder at how Sherlock could almost read his thoughts sometimes. "A bit short," John replied.
“Captain Watson,” she said in an empty voice, “I need you to come with me. You’re bleeding, Captain. Are you alright?”
“Then how did they miss the fact that the blood at the scene wasn’t entirely the victim’s blood?”
The other occupants said nothing. There was an unspoken agreement that none of them trespassed into anyone else’s agitation, whenever it was possible. The vicious fight with the Colonel had been enough of a lesson there.
Lestrade looked between the two of them, with the same air of confusion that he had worn when he first saw John in the flat. “It might be better-”
"You were saving yourself," Sherlock grumbled.
Sherlock didn’t respond.
For a long moment they stood and sat in silence. John sipped the tea with another notch of a frown at the taste of it, eventually abandoning it to the little table at the side of the couch. Some things just weren’t worth the struggle to tolerate them, and he could feel Sherlock’s approach. With Mycroft standing in the room with him, the usually pleasant sensation came into stark contrast with the vaguely annoyed sensation of having Mycroft nosing about being disapproving for no good reason. The two at-odds emotions and the off-putting tea all added up to a lurch of queasiness that John struggled to keep under control.
“Mycroft was rather firm about not letting the rest lend a hand," Gerard said in the same soft voice. Nothing, of course, was going to be low enough to avoid the wolves’ hearing, but the attempt at a little privacy was obvious, and none of the wolves turned to regard either of them. “But they were all in rather a state to hear he’d been taken.”
Sherlock was still talking, but John was back in that re-purposed facility in Siberia. He was kept in a room with a bag over his head for a day - two? There were people speaking at least two languages, some English, but something else. It was Russian, maybe, or… something Slavic that wasn’t Russian at all. There were IVs in him, and rounds of questions. John hadn’t let himself think about the eventual conclusion of his incarceration when it was happening. That wasn’t the time for it, almost like thinking the thought might have somehow made it come true. He had ignored how the incessant questions had multiplied before they trailed off. John was no commando, he had no special training, but he was as stubborn a bastard as any Watson. He didn’t take kindly to being snatched from a hospital, and he decided not to answer their questions, no matter how hard they asked. They asked pretty hard for a while.
The meal was remarkably uneventful. Elisabeth and Rawden presided over the table, possibly because it was their house but to John it felt like something more. This felt like their pack, all the siblings and children were somehow theirs, as though without their foundation there was no pack.
Greg hesitated. It was hard to argue with Sherlock’s prioritizing of the situation, not matter how odd it was to see him putting a person so far up his list, but it would be negligent not to question him about a ny of Miltons other associates. The police had looked, but there was neither hide nor hair of those they were aware of. And he really did need to tell Sherlock about the two men who’d been let out. The men had made some wild accusations, about Sherlock, about Doctor Watson, and while the detectives on the case took them at face value, they sounded like
“My siblings. Marianne is not quite as active as I am, but her job does take her from home. She may very well be away now, considering the research being done regarding our captors,” Sherlock said. He leaned into John as he spoke, tightening his arm around him. “And there’s always Mycroft.”
This had to be something else.
In the sitting room Sherlock was obviously placing their order.
twelve of us. Also twelve mates, now," Sherlock gave John a fond gaze before going on, "and several children. It's not my fault the question was imprecise."
There was a pause, possibly a sigh, something too soft to hear through the door. “From Germany.”
“Babysitting?” John asked Sherlock as the other wolves followed after Elisabeth.
Sherlock
Again, Sherlock’s bluster lost all its force. He looked up at Mycroft for a moment, as though sheer stubbornness might bring back the fury of his anger, but there was nothing. Sherlock gave up and turned back to the file in front of him. He stared for a long moment at the little collection of pictures, and flipped the top one over. Sherlock stopped at the next one, as though entranced by it. “I want him back,” he said in a low voice, running his fingers along the photograph.
Even if they hadn’t worked out their specific and particular
He often wished he could do just as Sherlock was currently doing.
Sherlock, his mate.
“Because I’m trying to figure out exactly how to explain that you are not allowed to strip me naked in my sleep before we’ve made up from a row.”
It was several minutes before Sherlock followed, brows furrowed. A pinched look tightened his features beyond the usual intensity he wore.
Sherlock sighed a mockery of John’s. “You continue to speak as though we are still fighting,” he said. “I have apologized. It will not happen again, as there was obviously some error in various, previously sound judgments.”
Some days his compassion was worn thin, and this was one of them. He’d only made sergeant a month ago, he had anticipated some longer nights, some better pay, and a different set of problems from before. He certainly hadn’t expected to get called on an old failing of his bleeding heart.
Sherlock knew it wouldn't last. It couldn’t. He could already feel the angry wolf within him burning through the chemicals he had instinctively injected, knew his body was working against his mind, but time was very different when he was under the influence, and all those thoughts came very quickly and somehow without hastening the end of the high in the slightest.
“Until what?” John snapped.
Sherlock climbed off him and then off the bed. He stood awkwardly beside it for a moment, hovering. His eyes darted over John from top to bottom, and then he edged towards the door. "I'll just... go back, then."
Together they sank down into the nest the bed had become. Sherlock grabbed blindly at the bedclothes and pulled them up, wrapping them both up as he wrapped himself around John. John sank into the embrace, leaning his cheek against Sherlock’s collarbone, and couldn’t resist pressing a kiss there even as his eyelids grew too heavy to keep open.
“And you can’t think of anything-”
“OI!” The sharp snap of the sergeant’s words cleared John’s head for a moment. “I don’t know exactly who you are, Doctor Watson, but that’s a bit much.”
“I’ll never keep up with you lot,” John said.
A second tug and a rush of irritation were John’s only answer. He gave up arguing because he rather liked this new jacket. So out he followed, as Sherlock went slowly enough not to lose him in the patchy moonlight that made it through the trees.
He wished he couldn’t remember her sneaking him smokes or the two of them pouring out every bottle of liquor in the house the night that dad wrapped his car around that tree. He tried not to think of her smiling face or the first time he realized she’d gotten his haircut on purpose.
I will say that this is
He liked Sherlock like this.
That got a little laugh out of John. He reached for a mug from the cabinet and his hand spasmed. The mug clattered first to the countertop and then fell to the floor, raining more of Sherlock’s detritus from the countertop around John’s feet and exploding into a myriad of pieces of mug on the kitchen floor.
"So this is our John Watson, then," he said, releasing Sherlock to extend a hand to John. “Rawden Holmes.”
Well.
“Friend of yours?” Greg asked, indicating the unconscious man on the couch. The man who appeared to have been cared for. That was… odd. “It’s just that you don’t really look like the type to know-” Greg checked his pad. “Milton.”
“Anything in English,” John asked, recalling that file Mycroft had made him read, not even having to embellish his desire to read something in his native language much, “a novel?”
Just as John was getting to wonder about how they’d get back to civilization enough to get to the store, Sherlock was moving again. He stalked back across the cobbled space and declared that the trash had been collected since the murder.
The sergeant sighed. “What do you think we missed?”
Sherlock rumbled in annoyance whenever John tried to ask, but the focus of Sherlock’s annoyance did not seem to be in the question. It was mostly regarding ‘previously sound judgments’, which he muttered about before flopping across the sofa with a distant expression. John learned quickly that Sherlock was unreachable at such times. For the most part it wasn’t even annoying, though something nagged at the back of John’s brain like a dog scratching to be let in.
Marriane's mate was a tall human named Gerard. He was starting to bald and wore a pair of glasses that made him look old, John thought. He smiled easily enough, but kept rather quiet. They lived in Bath. Marriane worked in software, and Gerard was an executive for a publishing company.
John looked up to meet his mate’s gaze, and for a moment there was heat, as there had been that morning and on nights and days before it, but there was something different, something warm and fond beneath it that drew John’s lips into a smile.
The moon had been on a Friday evening, and the in-laws, as John had settled on thinking of the rest of the pack until he found some reason to use another term, were at least lively company. Well, that is to say that Horatio, Anne, and Connie were lively company. Mycroft and Anthea were gone by the time brunch was called for.
“How do you know that?”
As soon as he answered, a worried voice said, “I’ve been calling for a week, and you haven’t answered.”
There was silence for a moment, obviously Detective Spoon didn’t like having that obvious fact pointed out to him by the person he was interrogating. Then, “Is there anyone that can verify the two of you were in the flat last night?”
“The skip was clean, the brick couldn’t have had five litres of blood on them, even with the rain,” Sherlock said, eyes rolling over to look at the sergeant. “Coupled with the blood not being the victim’s in the first place, and you’re missing an actual crime scene to ascribe to the murder. You won’t have that crime scene until you have more evidence, more scenes where these criminals left corpses out. So find the other blood samples that match the ones from this scene,” Sherlock said, as though it were just that simple. “And then we’ll have something to go on.”
You chastise one Holmes brother, and the other takes his place in the category of upstart. I will say that I rather enjoy Mycroft's little 'visits' to us.
He looked at the phone and tried not to think of her forcing it on him, saying that then she’d be able to get in touch with him. Throwing him a line, because she needed one, and how he’d been asleep when she called, asleep and thoroughly sideways off pain and a nightmare and naked and in Sherlock’s arms.
The buildings were drab, military structures that dated back to the time of his grandparents. The whole facility had been taken over and repurposed, of course. There had been some additions, and some upgrading to them, but the overall impression the sturdy military structures gave off was a dreary one. Coming back to it now was like entering an occupied ruin.
Once he got out there, it seemed almost pointless to ask, as Sherlock twisted his lips and tongue around phrases that John was positive were simple but sounded like verbal acrobatics. Instead he turned into the kitchen to work on their tea.
The top of the hill was a welcome sight, and the slope back to the manicured part of the grounds was an easy one.
bad.”
Sherlock made a growling noise from beyond them, and Greg shook his head. “I’m sure the EMT took a look at it for the file,” he said.
Or flat on Sherlock’s chest tired, if one wished to be accurate.
“Oh?”
“A bit of nostalgia, is all,” Stamford assured him.
“Just let me get this put away,” Sherlock said.
“Let. Go.”
“He is also not the sort to vivisect someone and then hang them by their extremities,” Sherlock said crisply. He brushed off the mobile and inspected it before handing it back to Watson.
“No,” Anthea replied, “though that likely has more to do with the proximity to the moon than any desire to spite the pair of you.”
He took a deep breath, and made himself take another one. Every time he thought he got himself on even keel, something like this happened. Every time he thought he could take a step forward there was a weight around his ankle dragging him back, pulling him under, and it was suffocating to be right back here again, even with all that had happened in the last few months to change his life. He stared at the phone and thought about doing nothing. He thought about dropping it on the table and heading back to bed and pulling a pillow over his head. He thought about pushing Sherlock down to the mattress and fucking this awful feeling out of himself.
“Some broken bones, a broken nose, and a few concussions,” the sergeant replied. “Apparently you
John led the way into the sitting room, but Sherlock passed him, moving to scoop several books from the couch. The sitting room had been an unfortunate victim of the case, towards the end. A victim that John had not been entirely prepared to lose. Sherlock’s thoughts had scattered across the surfaces there.
Of course the first time he’d gone to bed he hadn’t Sherlock in bed with him, and the second time he had.
Watson snorted out a laugh.
“There’s milk and sugar,” Greg said, motioning over his shoulder down the hallway. “I just didn’t know if you took it.”
good sheets," John clarified. "I don't care what it costs. I never want to be naked on hospital sheets again."
The wrong feeling that had been a background hum to John’s thoughts since leaving Wiltshire intensified as he made up the bunk that he’d be sleeping in. John tried to ignore it, but it was very little use. The sheets felt wrong. They were cheap regulation issue, over-washed to a false softness that had more to do with threadbareness than thread-count.
After lunch he was returned to the bunk room.
Was he speaking Siamese?
“You’re right, I don’t,” John replied. “But before we get into a game of ‘who’s more possessive’, let me ask you. How would you feel if I were the one strutting around naked in front of him?” John replied, watching the tea as it steeped in the cups.
Sherlock threaded his fingers through John’s, nimble digits warm against a hand that John hadn’t even realized was cold.
“Answer the question.”
usage of the cocaine,” Sherlock said, enunciating each word fully. John paused, and when he remained silent, Sherlock continued. “I mentioned before that I had thought the suffering would be all mine. It was… intolerable, being separated from you. I was irritable-”
Either one was useless, considering the volume with which he was speaking. Sherlock’s voice cut straight through the door. “Don’t be absurd,” he began, all his consonants sharp and his vowels clipped. “Honestly, Mycroft, I’d given you more credit than this. Years ago, Mycroft,
reason I came,” he said. “When you were interviewed, you said-”
Then he’d get back to Sherlock and he wouldn’t have to think about any of this again.
Sherlock’s eyes met his, narrowed. “You don’t project as much as I do.”
Sherlock nodded. John worked his arms around Sherlock, reveling in the closeness. He wondered if there was some way to soak in some of Sherlock so he would always be there. Sherlock let out something between a snort and a sigh, and pulled John more fully on top of him. There were too many elbows for a moment, and one too many knees, somehow, but finally they settled in to post-coital bliss.
"This isn't exactly comfortable," John said.
“It was personal?”
Once the team cleared out he was left in the elevator with a quiet woman who stood in the corner farthest from him and stared resolutely at her paperwork. There was something odd about that, John thought, but let it go. The elevator soon opened up on the basement level, and the woman hurried out, nose kept tucked down to her papers. John watched her turn towards the direction a sign indicated was the mortuary department.
Eventually Mycroft spoke again. "Though I do not gainsay your choice of mate, your timing is atrocious."
from him. It was distressing, this withdrawal of John’s feelings. To make a pedestrian sort of analogy, it was as if John’s sharing of feelings was like a faucet. John tended to keep the faucet more closed, but since this mess had started, he had all but shut off. Sherlock could feel him. Sherlock
“What am I feeling
Now it seemed that Sherlock’s strings were cut.
Once certain John was sleeping, and sleeping too deeply for dreams to trouble him, Sherlock freed his phone and began to look up what might be ailing his mate.  It was only then, by the too-bright light of the LED screen that shone like the moon in the darkness, while John was sleeping against him with a tight grip on his shirt, that Sherlock began to understand. There was a derth of information on wounded soldiers to be found on the internet.
- had gone through two cups of coffee and some biscuits. The caffeine and food were enough to make up for that morning, at least in John’s mind. Lestrade insisted he didn’t mind waiting, and John wondered what sort of a connection he had to Sherlock. John felt a jealous surge at the thought of the man with his hands on his mate, but something seemed false about that idea.
Sherlock snatched it from him almost before it was out of his jacket, and fell into the chair at the table. He opened the folder and planted his elbows in the area that Mycroft had cleaned for just that purpose.
There was a pause.
“So, for this particular chemical alteration you found worthwhile, we have your mate to blame?”
“Anything can happen,” John found himself saying.
“Not another one,” an annoyed voice from overhead snorted.
Watson seemed untroubled by the altercation, though he seemed to lament the smashed bags that were being poked at by a uniformed officer. He kept glancing that way with an expression between hope and regret. Greg ignored it as best he could, still surprised that he was once more with Sherlock and his Watson fellow. Watson still seemed nice, but there was something more there. There had to be, if he’d turned the two punks into moaning sacks of bruises.
(See the end of the chapter for
John lost himself in the distraction offered by the array of Sherlock’s feelings so thoroughly that the open back door was a surprise when they reached it.
This is the part where I meant please, please correct me if I've got my NSY ranks wrong. (Otherwise, you can probably guess who it is without me updating the tags yet, can't you?)
Sherlock stared, and John relented, patting the bench beside him.
Because Sherlock was a miracle, really, and John was an invalid ex-soldier with a twitchy hand and a trainwreck of a family.  Sherlock had a trust fund and a manor house and an extended family that cost more to dress than the cost of the Watson house and the contents of the entire Watson clan’s bank accounts combined. And Sherlock was silent, and all John could think was that it was too much to take in, that he was too much of a… a burden, or… or that he wasn’t quite-
“You are the last of anyone I should expect would forget my ability to manage surveillance is independent of my physical presence at a monitoring station,” Mycroft replied.
That thought came with the bitter taste of a dry mouth in the scorching sea of sand. When John blinked he could see the glaring sun and feel that weightless feeling of a body without enough blood in it.
be taken down by anything.
“I believed that some assurance might be required,” Mycroft replied.
John had been missing for more than six months. The army couldn’t account for his whereabouts, or how he had been treated. He had been in unknown conditions for an extended period of time. There was no telling that he had not been brainwashed or programmed in some fashion before he had been freed or released, or if he was somehow infected with something or dosed with something harmful and transmissible.
It was John’s idea to strip off and have at each other, but as happened, Sherlock took over in the follow through. Despite the moon’s distance, John could sense the wolf in his mate as they scrambled into bed together. Insistent, dexterous hands made short work of what was left of John’s clothes, and what Sherlock had been wearing all but evaporated in the midst of kiss and caress between the two of them.
"They are talking about you because you survived, but that isn't why, John. It makes you a curiosity, it will be an asset if anyone questions why I chose a human, but it has very little to do with the thing," he said, voice sounding entirely too sober and too serious.
“What I mean is, you might be more comfortable going back to the flat.”
Logic chipped its way into his panicked thoughts with the calm reason of a doctor.
Greg turned and found that the uniformed officer had emptied one of the bags, and a stomped on box looked to be the remains of a newly purchased kettle. He lifted a brow as he looked between the kettle and Watson, but the man just groaned and shook his head.
the door slamming as Sherlock rushed out of the flat, but he could imagine it. He could imagine the quick calculation of the hour, the lack of John’s coat. He could almost hear Sherlock’s tread on the stairs in those ridiculously overpriced shoes.
“That’s what I thought you said,” Sherlock muttered.
Thank you all very much for reading, and I will see you soon!
"No one's said where it is we're headed," John said, because no one had and though he wasn't currently worried about Mycroft's intentions, his last trip by private jet had been drugged and had only ended well on the technicality that was Sherlock.
“He seemed concerned enough for someone who’s not a friend,” John said. “How did you meet him?”
In the wake of that understanding, the trembling in John receded as he recognized it for what it was.
He hadn’t taken the mobile, because it wasn’t charged. Sherlock had gone to get the charger before Mycroft appeared. And even if he had a phone, he did not know Sherlock’s number. He couldn’t call and reassure his mate.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You did all that just to get your brother to leave us alone?" John frowned.
It was hard to hear anything over the memory, the sound of his own breathing, and the throb of his pulse in his ears, but John came back to the blue bedroom when Sherlock’s grip on him tightened.
He hated knowing that, but figured it was better than the ragged edges of himself he could feel in the evenings.
Before John could answer or protest, the same firm hug enveloped him, and the brown haired wolf lifted him just a little, sniffed him - John thought he did, anyway - and then set him back on his feet, extending a hand as he introduced himself with, "Horatio Fairfax."
“Tomorrow,” Sherlock said, steering John towards the door.
This was quarantine. It was still an incarceration, but also a safety precaution. It was procedure. He had done the same when their own were rescued from captivity.
“In the future, take your phone with you,” Sherlock said.
Texting was one way to always reach Sherlock. A well composed text was Sherlock’s preferred method of digital communication. It was instantaneous, and it allowed for precise use of vocabulary to deliver the sender’s exact meaning. He was as ruthless with them as he was with deductions of those who riled his ire. Sherlock had once replied to a text with his claws, just so he could snipe at Mycroft regarding… well. It didn’t matter anymore, really.
Warm lips pressed lazily at his throat, and Sherlock mumbled, “Too early.”
John turned to glance at Mycroft. “Unnecessary?”
“Hand me the phone, Sherlock.”
Truthfully, Sherlock seemed the most upset of all of them, arms folded in a way that puffed up his ridiculously posh coat. According to the witness who had called in to the Met, Watson had been alone in the fight, but somehow Sherlock had arrived before the squad cars. When asked about the scuffle, all Sherlock answered with was a thunderous expression.
“Fine,” Sherlock agreed grudgingly, “but
“Once you come away from the door.”
Sherlock huffed at that, turning to look at the fountain sharply.
“I don’t have it on me.”
John took a breath and looked up again. “You said you were careful, but that sergeant says you overdosed. At least once. You said you can’t be addicted, but you have enough of a habit that the cops know you. But the idea of you not being here…” John’s chest tightened again, more of a clenching sort of feeling that felt like his heart was
“Sherlock won’t tell me what finding his mate was like,” Connie huffed.
“You propose, then, that sex will solve this dispute for some reason based in personal experience?” Sherlock ground out. “Or are you, conversely, attempting to ignore it all — our disagreement, your siding with my brother, the unbearable malaise I am suffering under your disappointment?”
“That must have been awkward.”
When Sherlock set to good and proper fucking, the rhythm of the bed against the wall pounded out in explicit terms
“So does half the planet,” John replied.
“Uh…” John stalled, puzzled at the attention she had turned on him. He found that Charles was also looking at him expectantly. “We… haven’t even really been to London yet, so I can’t say…”
“That,” John said, pointing at Sherlock. “Not
Sherlock snorted loudly. John stared and tried to form some sort of protest or some sort of question, he wasn’t sure which.
It hadn’t rained much that day, so the sidewalks were mostly dry. John checked up and down the street. There were some lights still on in the townhouses up and down the street, and it wasn’t particularly dark with the streetlights. The residential street was quiet, and for a moment John wondered if Sherlock was the strangest thing on it. There were trees down to the right, green leaves gone golden in the glow of the streetlights. John turned for them, wanting a bit of a destination even though he wasn’t so naive as to loiter around a park in the middle of the night.
He texted back.
Then John was hustled out onto the concrete and into the building, up the stairs, through the doors and into the flat.
“Breakfast?”
John told the story from the folder as best he could remember it. He had his hiccups, places his throat felt too dry to continue, but rather than seeming disingenuous, his responses seemed to authenticate the story. John was glad of it, because he couldn’t do better. The color seemed almost gone out of the world, by then, all leeched away somewhere John couldn’t find it.
Aware of the childishness of it, John couldn’t hold back from saying, “You started it.”
The lead paramedic nodded, looking just as surprised by the direction as Lestrade felt hearing it. Then John Watson stepped back and let them at their patient. He picked up his tea cup again, sipping it for a moment before he noticed Lestrade was watching him. “Tea, Sergeant?”
“Shopping,” John replied. “Look, if you really want to question me again-”
“About you and Sherlock.”
“You deduced it, how exac- You went back to the crime scene.”
“Sherlock-?” John started, but found he was unsure what it was that he wanted to ask, precisely. Before the thoughts could come to him, he found himself distracted by further antics of his mate.
It was a sort of treatment that smacked John with similarities to the caged room in Russia, and he had to fight down a rush of panic.
John shrugged. Sherlock hid his smile, pleased at the small indication that they remained on the same side.
Some other tactic, then.
Over Sherlock’s bare shoulder, the sergeant was flushed an embarrassed shade of red and was staring determinedly at the floor.
"You're not the first I've had to bed," Sherlock said, stroking his side. "And you weren't the first human thrown into my cell."
“Larger than you,” Sherlock said absently, tilting John’s arm with gentle hands. He brought John’s other arm up, crossed them, but dismissed the positioning with a snort. As though dealing with puzzle pieces, Sherlock shifted them until they were in the choke hold John had used, and nodded. “You had to incapacitate someone. Another soldier, then, also invalidated from service, somehow. Larger than you, just look at the size of the gouts his nails made in your arms. Taller, as well.” Sherlock drew John’s forearm up and licked across the wound with a gentle tongue. “What was his name?” he murmured against John’s skin.
John reminded himself that to his regular acquaintance, losing thing military would be devastating. He looked down at his coffee and understood the loss she was imagining, but that hadn’t hit him yet.
It didn’t come out quite as cocky as intended, because John’s knees gave out and a hasty grip on Sherlock’s arms was all that kept him from ending up on the gravel beneath their feet. He felt cold, suddenly. Strong hands latched onto John, and he was pulled against Sherlock’s chest.
One collar button was open to reveal a triangle of pale skin.
“We’ll get a cab then,” Harry said, nodding to herself.
Sherlock jerked back from the open door to stare at his brother. “What are you doing here? You’re supposed to be-”
to Harry just then.
John pointedly ignored a set of dishes with moist dirt on them. He went back to see what else was in the bag.
Then John was bustled straight out of his clothes.
Sensing scrutiny, John shook his head. Low, familiar tones drew him out of sleep, accompanied by less recognizable ones. Despite the comforting warmth of the down jacket against the usual chill of the canned, recycled air in an aircraft, a tension had developed in him. It wasn't helped by the strange presence of Sherlock's immaculate and apparent mastermind of a brother, and it certainly wasn't helped by the armrest between John and Sherlock. Forcing a calm through himself to ease off the feeling, John popped his back and rolled his shoulder. He turned his face into Sherlock's neck, seeking and finding the comforting smell of his mate, and mumbled, "Nothing bad."
Greg didn’t point out how obvious that was, instead he waited with a lifted brow for the technician.
“Your hand,” Sherlock said before John could ask. His voice sounded deflated, and John looked up to see that his mate had a stricken look on his face and his eyes were trained on John’s left hand.
“We’ll rewrap them,” Sherlock replied, removing the gauze with careful hands.
John didn’t have a response to that statement, but he was uncertain anyone would. Despite that, he was glad to be among the wolves, he found. They were warm, and accepting enough, for the most part. The dynamic was different with each of them, and though they seemed to be very different, they were all… well, for lack of a better term, family. At first the only reply he could find sounded disparaging, and that wasn’t right. There was nothing lesser about Marianne or her connection with her mate. It was just
Other concerns melted away, though his stomach still turned itself in knots and nightmares filled his sleep at the persistent absence of Sherlock every night.
It was not bright in their bedroom, but as John straightened he could see a flush of color on Sherlock’s high cheekbones. When he caught John looking, Sherlock turned and began to undress himself.
“- then what exactly are you doing?”
“Morphine,” Sherlock replied. “Completely different suppliers.” He shrugged. “The statistical improbability of both of sets being unavailable at the same time made the two a reliable enough variance, as I was not addicted to the substances in question.”
Sherlock made a disgruntled noise in his throat  and pointedly turned so that his shoulder was more to Mycroft. He tightened the arm he had around John, pulling him closer before his other hand was unzipping the parka and undoing the front of the stolen shirt he had on.
Sherlock jerked, casting a quick glance at John, but it was the rush of
“I loathe repeating myself,” Sherlock reminded the sergeant.
It was Sherlock's turn to glare, but Mycroft had both hands lifted in surrender.
“John who?”
Somewhere inside of him, John had a response.
Harry’s look remained concerned, but she nodded. She’d known him through the height of his prowess, had heard his friends joking about his nickname when they’d bring him back from the pub on the off-night when he was too drunk to end up trotting off home with someone. “Old or new?”
Now was different, though. Now he could ask. Now he could
First it was the scuffle, and how did John feel about that?
Anne’s face did a rather complicated contortion as she realized her mistake and coughed out a soft apology. “I… don’t really connect you with all of that, sorry.”
of them weren’t any better at the whole issue of Sherlock’s constant-
“Not here,” John huffed, relaxing as Sherlock’s arms both came up around his waist. “We’ve a perfectly good bed not ten meters to your left.”
“And I do not have the body systems of your usual patients. I have never been
Sherlock’s anxiety fled at the realization, and he stared at John, taking in all of the things that the retelling had stirred up in him.
I have to admit, I dearly love Sherlock's little joke about he and Temperance having the same type.
“You and Sherlock are having, what did you call it? A ‘spat’?”
The kitchen door banged open in the dramatic way that only one member of the household did with any sort of regularity. Sherlock stomped in, barefoot and disheveled from sleep, and headed straight for the refrigerator.
Nothing more of that line of conversation was brought up at the table. They went on to spend the rest of the weekend in Wiltshire. Connie didn’t broach the subject again, and John found that he did not mind that one bit.
“But it has been documented. You know, on documents. By New Scotland Yard,” John pointed out. “Some Sergeant that Sherlock knew came by and said we weren’t to leave town. They took the guy-”
"My brother is fairly... protective," Sherlock said, squeezing his shoulders before stepping over to the other set of scrubs to pull them on. "It's a terrible habit of his."
“But that’s so… so subjective!”
“Don’t have any,” Sherlock said, kissing John’s stomach. “This will have to do.”
From inside his jacket, Mycroft removed the file folder. It was a bit worse for the jostling in the bathroom, but the clasps and paper clips had kept everything tucked appropriately inside.
By the time the mugs were clean and the tea was steeping, Sherlock was up and paying the delivery person. John looked up in time to see his mate locking the door and then turning with a flourish of the dressing gown he was wearing.
A shiver went through John at that, to think that so much time had passed and he hadn’t been able to mark the days as they went by. He wondered if it would have made it better or worse to know as it was happening, to know if-
that did in his little charade.
The sergeant looked at Sherlock, and then at John, and took a breath.
Because as much as Greg wanted to write the shorter man off as something he could handle,
There was no immediate response. John stopped splashing the water to listen for Sherlock's answer, but... there really was none. That didn't seem normal.
Lestrade,” he snapped, “if your skills as a detective have led you to thinking that John is an abusive lover, then I have some very serious questions regarding your promotion.”
“The more you say things like that, Mycroft, the less I believe them. Look, do you have anything else? Sherlock’s nearly back and I don’t think you two want to cross paths right now.”
John looked down to see that it was bandaged and twitching, fingers moving like they had some rhythm to tap out.
Sherlock hated Mycroft for that in the same way that he was 'vexed' with Mummy.
Well. It had to be considered more than normal transference, though. John was certain of it. Not that he had not been sharing openly before, but since it had come out in the open, Sherlock seemed to project his emotions at John like a lighthouse shining a beam into the fog. They came through bright and clear, sometimes even when Sherlock wasn’t projecting them.
“What is all this junk, anyway?” John asked, filling the kettle and setting it on the hob to heat.
It took John a moment of blissful distraction to remember what they had to be on time for.
“More important than this?” Sherlock asked, arching a brow.
“One of the neighbors,” came the easy reply, “stopped me to complain about the violin music.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The feeling was an empty one.
“Regularly,” Mycroft replied.
John scrambled to his feet, socks slipping a moment before he moved towards where the Colonel defending his corner.
Matthews held the door as the two of them entered, and Sherlock’s eyes flicked towards the door of his laboratory. John could almost see the thoughts churning in his husband’s handsome head. Sherlock had been putting off setting up his laboratory since before John had joined him in 221, and now that the case was done, he was buzzing in anticipation.
Not unlike insomuch as one might liken the spray from a garden hose to a monsoon.
It still felt wrong, and that wrong feeling came with a wave of fatigue.
“Brain chemistry is a very powerful-”
“-I was unstable, but on the third evening of your absence, something happened, and what I normally felt of you vanished,” Sherlock said, staring at the shelf. He ran a finger along the edge of the wood, cleaning off some of the dust there. “It was instinctive, not intentional. The cocaine helps me disconnect.”
John’s heart sped up at the thought of that. His mate was somewhere in this city, and soon he would be with Sherlock again.
It was still a bit odd feeling what Sherlock was feeling, but it was… strangely nice to have someone else’s feelings when he was sick of his own. John closed his eyes and let himself feel it, let Sherlock’s feelings wash over him.
“I know, love.” the doctor soothed, stroking the Omega's cheek with his thumb. “I know.” Leaning forward again, John kissed him once more, his other hand still on his partner's belly. “What do you want to eat?”
There he was, sitting in his chair like any other day, feeling unusually warm, despite the chilling autumn weather, the heaters still cold at this time of year.
“Huhu!” came the soft high pitch of their landlady's voice. “Oh, just look at you two..! You will make such a beautiful family!” she smiled, proud as a mother.
He heard John coming back downstairs to drop two pups in the living room and going upstairs again to get the other two.
“Sherlock? I was wondering if you could.. play the violin for a bit? I just want to see how they react to that kind of music; if it interests them or relaxes them, you know.” John asked one afternoon.
it was her all along, but I now have the evidence.”
“Hm, you certainly seem satisfied, yes.” the Alpha mumbled, clumsily caressing his Omega's face and cuddling up against him, mindful of the pups growing in the small space between their bodies.
The Omega shook his head. “Nothing I could poof.”
Sherlock reached out over the tabletop and took John's right hand in his left, finding that it was rather practical they had different dominant hands since they could hold each other's hand while still operating something. “John. You know better than anyone, what kind of person I am. I am not given to outbursts of emotion and if I do show much of them, it has good reason, pregnancy for example. However, I do believe I have told you, during the more mindful part of the last week, that I am having a certain emotional attachment to you and even though I was lost in the wild conundrum of hormonal spikes, I did not lie. I love you. I am willing to accept this weakness as mine. I am prepared to act upon it, so, if you will have me, I will be yours and yours entirely.”
The Omega, however, quickly turned around and stopped John, going around to face him and looking him into the eyes with a soft smile as he placed the Alpha's hands on his abdomen to let them continue what they had been doing a moment ago. His look intensified as he slowly drew in a deep breath, deliberately inflating his belly and revelling in the sight of John's pupils dilated instantly. It was only too visible on John's face how he was cursing internally while Sherlock smiled wickedly. He leaned down, sealing the Alpha's lips firmly, an unspoken promise given and he knew John understood, could feel it through their finally fully developed bond and the feelings of gratitude, great anticipation and love rose inside Sherlock as they built inside John.
“Yeah... Why are we doing this again?!”
“Alright, how much sleep've you had? Have you eaten?”
He felt so dumb. Now, that his brain had picked up on working fully again, it sunk in, all of it. How it had started, how pathetically he had tried to hide from John instead of standing strong an taking control. He remembered how John had, in his way of caring, brought him to his bedroom and how he had tried to seduce John like a ridiculous horny dog. He remembered how John had eventually lost control and taken him, helped him. And he remembered how senseless he had been, how he had not even tried to think about just
“What was that?!”
“Sounds good. Precise.”
“You will call me John.”
Then Sherlock was gently shaking his shoulder. “John.” The Omega looked at where Sherlock was leaning over him. “Perhaps you should go to bed.”
John gave a kiss to his mate's curls. “Sentiment, Sherlock, sentiment.”
“I know it's fine.” Sherlock instantly fired back like it was the most natural opinion in the world.
That particular boy had experienced John's anger in the second week of endless terror as he tried to insist on him going home and John towered his 5'6'' and barked at him until he stood down.
“Why so?”
“Maybe that wasn't quite your kind of humour.”
as most people thought him, he was far from that! Just because he wore those ridiculously adorable jumpers and could socialise, didn't mean he wasn't suffering from PTSD and fighting his own disturbed mind with all his willpower. But no one ever looked at the shaking hand, most people didn't even realise John was left-handed! They only saw limp and cane and thought 'ah, well, he was a soldier, he will have gotten wounded', but not one of them saw it was an at least partly psychosomatic limp. Nobody noticed how uncomfortable John could get talking to people, how he loathed the general ignorance of society and despised talking to narrow-minded, superficial, stupid people. John surely wasn't a genius, but lord he was intelligent. Smart. Cunning.
John waited for a moment and realised there was no further words to be expected from Sherlock, despite the doctor's waiting expression. “We are going to keep them.” the Alpha therefore added.
“Mmh, maybe we should try both at the same time sometime.”
Sherlock clicked his tongue and said “it's a cross I have to bear”in joke-complaint.
“You are now working about twice as much!”
Oh, John.
“But it will be healthy?” Sherlock asked, presently as ever.
Sherlock shuffled into the living room, clothed in only a bedsheet and found John bustling around, quite efficiently for his state, at that. “What are you doing?”
“Tommy's Alpha would be the next guardian to him, so I would say you'll stay with him.” John concluded and a smile spread across the children's faces.
“Sometimes, with a newly formed cycle and an exuberant amount of copulation, an Omega can conceive even outside of heats. If an Alpha is found and bonded with, the constant stimulation can cause an ovum to drop. Luckily this one hasn't been fertilised, but was flooded out of your body again after it 'expired', if you so like. That is what happened yesterday night. That is what the bleeding was.”
Hey, chaps!
Sherlock cleared his throat and stabbed at his food. “Good.”
(And, yes, no notes at the beginning this time. I figured it wouldn't do much good on the atmosphere^^)
The DI scratched his head and pondered for a moment. When Sherlock left the flat a few minutes later, appearing very weird to John's judgement, the police team finally retreated.
With a soft giggle, John took one more kiss from the Omega before he went to bring the tea dishes back into the kitchen. Meanwhile, Sherlock flopped down onto the sofa, staring at the ceiling.
“Oh, dear, there are help programs, you know. The government financially supports single parents, you don't have to shoulder it all on your own!” she tutted him, shaking her head at his ignorance. She didn't seem to realise that John was aware of such aid programs and, for lack of fitting words, retreated with another smile.
The Omega's face twisted until it looked painful, then he spit at John and hit his cheek. The OP let go of the table, absolute fury having taken over his eyes, and threw back his angled arm to land a fist square on the other man's jaw. He was about to leap at him when the policemen stormed into the room and secured John, the other Omega cowering under the table, shielding his head and holding his jaw.
pain of being stretched ever so slightly. With his legs bend, feet pressed flat to the mattress, he ground down on the fingers inside him desperately.
John had known it to be a bad idea to let Sherlock go on his own, but he couldn't just have left the shivering, scared Omega on the edge of his own heat standing there alone. He dived after Sherlock as soon as he was in caring hands, though, trailing their route by following Sherlock's familiar scent.
“Yes, he came here, told me about a case, said looked 'good'..” he explained, eyes still focused on the pictures Lestrade had sent him.
“So you
“The more angry I am, the more prone I am to throw up.” John spat back.
John couldn't really pinpoint Sherlock's tone of voice. If he didn't know better, he'd say it had sounded like Sherlock thought the idea stupid.
John made his way up to Greg's office, exchanging a greeting with a couple of sergeants and constables he'd got to know over the time working with Sherlock. Greg was already awaiting them, waving him right through into his office with the offer of a cup of coffee.
“I would also, at this point, like to check that everything is alright with your genitalia. I don't know and don't want to assume exactly what happened to you, but if you say you're not ready to-”
“Alright, let's see. There's one.. two.. three... four.” she counted as she took pictures and marked them on the computer. John observed the marks indicating his pups' size and position within Sherlock. They were still four delicate little creatures, but beginning to crowd up the space. The estimations had been right, the growth spurts would start soon.
“I'd never have gotten here if not for John. And I'd never have healed like this without him either.” Sherlock said to his blanket, looking up at John after. His mate was looking back as neutrally as he could manage, but something in his eyes displeased Sherlock greatly still.
pheromones?! Have you smelled yourself?” John retorted with an amused look.
Sherlock stared back at him in question, but John stepped away, giving him a look that led Sherlock to believe it would be a very bad idea to leave this spot. The doctor returned with his kit. He made a quick, and unavoidably painful, process of treating the Omega's ear. Then he caressed his face, scratching lightly with his fingernails. He moved in for a kiss, stopped short before Sherlock's lips like a question.
“Had to go undercover, didn't I?”
The little stirring he did should have been signal enough to show he was conscious. “I'm off to work now, love. There's breakfast in the fridge, just re-heat it, okay?” he leaned over the Omega's body to kiss his cheek and brushed his side quickly. “See you later.”
John tried to breath, tried not to focus on Sherlock smelling probably like a ripe 'come-and-breed-me-Alpha”-fruit.“Fucking Christ.. I can't think!”
“All the more reason to start practising! My legs have gotten weak with the lack of walking and conversion of muscle to fat; which I burned immediately, at that. I'm not going to be pushed out of here in a wheelchair! I need to work on this.” The Omega argued and John held his hands tightly.
