that the BDSM club offered, he preferred to use his own toys and to only go that far with people that he intended to see more than once - for him, BDSM wasn’t something you did for just a night. To make it worth it, you had to trust your partner completely and that wasn’t something you got from a one-night stand.
Cass pulled back from the kiss but remained impossibly close as smooth hands made their way down Dean’s body. “See? I feel you, Dean. I feel how your body responds to me, let me take care of you.”
They reached Dean, Cass and Rue’s first camp and Dean decided to call it a night. “Bobby’s camp is a few hours from here, we should get some rest.”
He avoided his teammates as he walked into the changing room and pulled his robes out of his locker. He ran his thumb over the yellow number 4 that stuck out in bright contrast against the blood red background and thought back to the first time he put these robes on.
“Stop, c’mon. Don’t be like that. I know I’ve got a lot to make up for, but with both of you lookin’ for jobs in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, I’m doin’ what I can to get you there. I took this job to help out where I could at school, but also to make some contacts at the Ministry other than the ones we’ve done jobs for.”
“I don’t need to know you well to gauge what kind of person you are, Dean. Doing this as long as I have, you meet a lot of different people. Some might say I have sort of a… gift for reading people. And what I’m reading from you… is good.” Cass stood after it was made obvious that Dean didn’t have a single fucking clue what to say back to that. “Do you mind if I shower? You weren’t the only one that had a long drive to get here, and the spotlights always make me sweat.”
The rest of the week went pretty much the same, until Thursday. He was more relaxed at work, less irritable with his coworkers, and actually looking forward to going home for once. Thursday nights were girls’ nights, which meant Lisa would be gone for the night and Dean could do whatever the fuck he wanted to do (within reason.)
“That day can’t come soon enough.” Sam promised himself in that moment that he was going to kill Caesar Flickerman, or die trying.
“Great, well uh… why don’t you just stay on your half of this death trap and I’ll stay on mine, yeah?”
Cass hummed, tapping his fingers on the desk as he considered his response. He certainly knew how Impala felt in this manner, which was one of the reasons he’d chosen the rear view instead of his face.
“Do you have a death wish, Dean? I mean, more-so than normal? Let the angels handle it, there was no reason for you to still be there and in case you don’t remember, you were
“He’s very good at his job, and I would be hard pressed to find another individual with his work ethic. He brings more to the table than anyone; his parents did an excellent job of raising him.”
Twenty minutes later, he was still fuming as he barged into Cass’s office. He threw his bag down and didn’t bother trying to change the look on his face. “Let’s just do this shit, alright? The faster we get outta here, the better.”
As it turned out, Dean was going to an empty classroom, because he wasn’t quite done with what they had started in Professor Trinket’s office.
Castiel blinked his eyes open slowly, squinting against the light. He kissed Dean back as he sat up slightly. “Hello.”
The bowtruckle on Cass’s knee hopped back over to its owner and disappeared into Newt’s robes, and Dean moved his knee just enough to brush against Cass’ without making it obvious.
Dean blinked, glancing between them. “Son of a bitch, I guess my Flesh-Eating Slug Repellant doesn’t work. You think they give refunds?”
Well, that's all folks. Huge,  HUGE shout out to CeliPuff, without whom this fic would never have been finished.
Castiel winced and clenched his jaw and pain fled through his arm, balling his hand into a fist at his side.
“I know he does. I’m going to do my best -- failure isn’t an option at this point.” He nodded once to her and then turned, heading up the stairs.
Fuck it, I don’t care. I’m going to bed, I’ll see you in Potions.” He turned on his heel and walked quickly away.
“No, I can’t get off with a condom on. I’ve never been able to. If you wouldn’t have switched, I’d have finished in the shower later.”
He stood a safe distance from them but close enough that he’d be able to catch the lift before the doors closed. None of them even so much as glanced at Dean, which suited him just fine.
Sam’s stomach sank. If Flickerman was playing up the self-defense angle, this just got a lot harder. One sip of Truth Serum would be enough to prove that they had done exactly what Flickerman claimed they did. This trial had taken a very dark, very un-promising turn in a single sentence. He clenched his jaw and remained silent, knowing he’d have his chance to speak soon.
Castiel didn’t say anything or even turn to look at Professor Trinket. He kept his back to her and his fists balled at his sides as he shivered.
Cass’s mouth drew him in completely and Dean risked a glance down, which proved to be a mistake. His cock throbbed at the sight of Cass with his cheeks hollowed out and those insanely bright blue eyes locked on his own face. “Fuck, jesus christ.”
Next to him, Sirius looked happier than Sam had ever seen him, and he was hugging James tightly as Sam looked over. Even Cato looked pleased with the announcement, and Sam was reminded yet again that Cato and Dean shared a connection whether they liked it or not. They were all on the same side tonight. Not Gryffindors and Slytherins, Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws. They were simply a bunch of kids beyond relieved that this nightmare was finally over.
I really hope you guys enjoyed this, I had a blast writing it and I’ve appreciated the feedback from you all more than you know. I’ll be continuing Elevator Music and I’ve got about a million ideas in the works, so I’ll see you all again soon 🖤
“Yep, tried that one, too.” Castiel could practically hear her eyes rolling, and he found himself wondering if she picked up that habit from Dean, or if it was Dean that learned it from Lisa.
Benny hung up without saying anything else and Dean tossed his phone on the passenger seat. He only had another few minutes until he’d reach his apartment, so he put that time to good use and pushed Baby’s speakers to their limits.
come out of the pile of swinging limbs, and he leaned against one of the pillars on the edge of the courtyard, crossing his arms.
Two Death Eaters that Sam had never seen before stood in the back behind the Headmaster and Professors McGonagall and Cinna. Sam straightened up in his chair as Headmaster Shurley magically amplified his voice. “This, by far, is the worst day of the year. I know it, they know it, and all of you know it - so let’s not kid ourselves with Games summaries or - or mock fanfare. I fought this with everything I had, but twelve kids must still be Chosen. I am so incredibly sorry that I have to be the one to oversee this, but it was either me or them.” He jerked his head towards the Death Eaters and then cleared his throat. “I thought I owed you guys at least this much.” He turned towards the Goblet of Fire as the flames turned red, and the Choosing began.
Castiel watched him, tilting Dean’s chin up. “So don’t fight with me then. Let’s just- let’s be friends to everyone’s faces, but if you want, maybe we can be…
He scanned the crowd and recognized almost every face he saw. He hadn’t fucked them all, but he’d certainly fucked all the ones worth anything. He sighed and took a sip of his whiskey, leaning lazily against the wall as the horny,
Cass, you’ve never pulled me out before the job was done. Ever. Yeah, we were outnumbered like 50 to 1, but all the other winged dickbags showed up - we shouldn’t’ve fuckin’ left them.”
water, but he knew Charlie was just worried. She was all too familiar with Dean’s drops, and that fact alone made Dean hate himself just a little more.
just won the Quidditch finals? He lowered his broom to the ground and tossed it to the side, all the other Hufflepuff players landing and celebrating as well. Even Raphael had a smile on his face.
“Then- I’ll stop,” he closed his eyes as he spoke. “I won’t flirt with you and I’ll keep my eyes closed around you as much as I can I just-” he tensed, his eyes still closed. “I need you, Dean. Even if you can’t be with me, we can still try and be friends, right?”
another book appeared. He grinned to himself, the covers matched exactly. Had he really done it the first time? It had been 2 years since he’d been able to do that, and this was O.W.L. level magic. He flipped open the duplicate book and groaned. It was blank.
He was surprised and slightly disappointed when Castiel didn’t sit next to him. He knew he had no reason to think that he would; sure, they’d gotten back some of their previous banter and comfort level with each other, but Dean had still been an ass and never even bothered to explain it. He scowled at his desk.
,” she had pursed her lips here, suggesting it wasn’t much of an agreement, but rather an argument she regretted losing, “that it would be best if I taught you.”  Professor Effie Trinket was one of the weirdest witches that Dean had ever met. Where most witches and wizards opted for dark, dull clothing to make it easier to blend in, Professor Trinket made it a point to stand out. Bizarre costumes, brightly coloured makeup splotched all over her face. He was sure she had to be a metamorphmagus; there was no way she could dye her hair like that every day. Each time he saw her it was a different shade of insane.
Giving himself a nod of encouragement, he pulled back the trapdoor and descended the ladder from his attic bedroom. He pushed the trapdoor closed and then took the main stairs down to the kitchen.
He stared at the blank dating profile for several long minutes after his pep talk, not having a clue what to put.
“Okay, I promise I’m almost done. So, once you find a way to keep it open, you come back for me. Get in here and
There’s a little bit of inevitable subdrop at the end of this, which will continue on to the following chapter. It’s not horrible and I promise it leads to good things, but there’s your warning. 🖤
When Dean sucked in a breath to start singing, Cas put a finger over his mouth and shook his head, beginning himself.
He walked out in a daze without buying anything. If that’s how Dean treated all of his customers, how was this shop even still open?
He rolled his eyes with a grin, pushing his fist into Dean’s chest as he stretched. “Shut up, I do not.”
Dean’s brain caught up with his mouth, and he pulled back. He didn’t move his hand, but his eyes were wider than he thought was possible and he quickly looked around them, because people
Once more, he clicked submit. This time, he was greeted with a confirmation message and access to the overwhelming amount of profiles available on this site. He took a deep breath, and accidentally swiped the wrong way three times before he finally got the hang of it.
Dean was the one to lean in this time, their mouths crashing together under the heat of the summer sun. Cass’s hands dropped from Dean’s face to his waist and slid up under his shirt at the same time Dean decided he’d had enough of Cass’s trench coat.
The man Sam guessed was the judge sat forward from where he was perched high up in the rows of seating. He cleared his throat, which drew the attention of every witch and wizard in the room. “My name is Osiris. I am judge, jury, and if necessary… executioner.” His eyes swept almost menacingly around the room, and Sam shivered. “Caesar Flickerman, you are brought before me today to answer for the crime of murder in the highest degree and the use of an Unforgivable Curse. How do you plead?”
Castiel shook his head, still horrified and confused as hell. “You just- the poor bicorn! What the hell did you do that for?!”
Adrenaline was pumping traitorous blood right to his fucking cheeks again, which was made worse by the fact that he’d downed a third of a bottle of whiskey in near record time.
Dean glanced down at his leftovers-for-one meal and looked almost longingly at the couch he’d been planning on dying on that night. “I mean, I know I’m cool and all, but it’s only been like twelve hours. You sure you wouldn’t rather be with your friends? You don’t see ‘em all that often.”
His phone buzzed on the seat next to him. He opened his eyes and glanced at it, then swiped to answer and groaned a little overdramatically into the phone.
He let out an exasperated sigh. Gabriel wasn’t unlike a kid in a candy store with potentially new information. Or a dog with a bone. Relentless and entirely too excited. “Yes, but I won’t be seeing
He’d been at Lafitte & Novak (soon to be Lafitte, Novak & Winchester) enough times to know that he was going to get judged no matter what he looked like. He wouldn’t even go tonight if it wasn’t the single most important night of Sammy’s life.
It took 3 more unsuccessful attempts before he was finally able to create a perfect duplicate of the book. He may not have been the first one to succeed, but he certainly wasn’t the last one, either. To his satisfaction, he saw the group of Slytherins that had followed him to the classroom were huddled together, poking their wands at a steaming pile of ashes.
isn’t exactly the finest of our Father’s creations. He tried to convince me that Balthazar - our percussionist - already took our payment. I’m not even sure Balthazar knows we get paid for gigs like this… I think mostly he’s in it for the free alcohol and… freer females. Then, he changed his tune and tried to say we didn’t draw a big enough crowd to merit payment, and I had to spend twenty minutes explaining to him that people won’t show up to a gig they don’t know is happening, and that he’d have better luck if he actually advertised. We were booked last minute, I honestly don’t even know how you found out we were playing here tonight.”
got left. You still have the other angels... Hannah, Balthazar, Gabriel. Sammy - Sammy’s gone, so that makes sense for
Dean stood, his movements quick as he pulled a few tissues from a nearby box and handed them to Cass. True to his word, Dean didn’t clean himself up before getting dressed again, those panties that would haunt every second of Cass’s life now hidden once more under worn out denim.
As he made what felt like the tenth turn after it, the bicorn finally stopped in a clearing. Dean halted as quickly as he could and braced his palm on a nearby tree for support as he tried to steady his breathing. Castiel caught up with him moments later, breathing equally as heavy. “Dean, w-what the hell are you doing?”
believe it. After everything Finnick had survived, had fought through? No, this couldn’t be true. But he could hear in Prim’s voice that it was. He knew, by all accounts, that technically all twelve of them should be dead and that he should be thankful that ten had survived, but Finnick? Dean was heartbroken all over again, and not just for his own loss, but for Sam’s and Cass’s and poor Annie Cresta’s.
Aunt Naomi sighed. “There hasn’t been any change, Castiel. She’s still very out of it.” He tensed and looked to the ground. “Aunt Naomi, it’s been three years.”
Dean groaned, and Finnick grinned. “Don’t look so happy to see me, Winchester. I might start to think you actually missed me.”
He spun immediately, dropping his chest to the desk and not giving a shit about the things he’d knocked off in the process. He wiggled his ass and spread his legs, looking over his shoulder. “Fuck me, Cass. There are condoms and lube behind you, hurry the fuck up.”
“Hey angel, you got the love I need. Maybe more than enough. Oh, darlin’, darlin’, darlin’, walk awhile with me…”
The next few minutes were full of broad hands sweeping over heated bodies and soft breaths ghosting over flushed skin. Dean couldn’t believe the way they fit together, even like this, and was determined to find out how well they fit together without clothes. The first time Dean’s fingertips touched bare skin underneath that pink shirt, the man moaned and Dean lost his fucking mind. He pulled Pink tight to him and bit his earlobe, then whispered right in his ear, “Come upstairs with me.”
He handed Castiel the canteen again and the rolled up star chart. “You need to take it before you walk through the portal, we got no idea what’s waiting for you on the other side.” He kissed Cass one last time, his hands on his face.
He never let her help, though. Never let anyone help. The strangers always left and he’d be damned if he let someone else deal with a mess he made himself.
Dean didn’t have to be told twice. He joined the rest of the team as they walked out, shook hands with the other team, and took off into the air. He faintly heard the whistle that signaled the start of the game, and then Jo whizzed past him with the Quaffle in her hand.
He and Sirius worked as a flawless team, each one sensing where the other was going and which targets they were aiming for. They managed to stop several potential goals with well-aimed
He sped around the Hufflepuff goals, rolling neatly on his broom in front of Castiel and taking off towards the other end. He was trailing Lisa Braeden, who had the Quaffle and was about to run smack into all three Hufflepuff Chasers. He was about to yell a warning to her, but realized at the last second that she was feinting. He shut his mouth, flying over her just as Jo flew under and grabbed the Quaffle out of the air. He hit the bludger that came towards them and sent it flying back up the other end of the pitch, not paying attention to where it went because Jo was about to score again. She did, but that was pretty much the end of their good luck.
“I’m sorry my dad forced you into this. I can go, I’ll tell him you’re helpin’ me anyway, and I’ll just double down on my own, alright? Don’t feel obligated to do this shit.”
can’t. This ain’t fair to you. I’d never be able to take you home to meet my family, or see you over the summer, or even
would always be one of Cas’ favorites, but he was practically bursting at the seams for the second encore so he barely paid attention.
Severus Snape had caught him trying to leave the Black’s, but Walburga had played it off as though Castiel had simply wanted some fresh air, and Snape had no proof to the contrary. He did, however, stay outside the entrance to the Black’s home for the remainder of the evening, and Castiel was forced to sleep in Sirius’s bedroom and wait it out. He hadn’t slept much. He was panicking because Voldemort had already met Dean once, and Cass knew only what Dean had told him about their conversation. If he messed something up and Voldemort found out he wasn’t actually Dean, he wouldn’t be allowed to return with Mrs. Black and therefore would never make it back to Hogwarts, let alone make it back to Dean.
“Who the hell taught you that word? I swear, every conversation we have you’re callin’ somebody an assbutt.” Dean doesn’t outright smile, but it’s there.
He squirmed, rocking back against them which caused Cass’s middle finger to bump against his prostate. Dean hissed and his cock pulsed in the air. “C’mon, Cass. I’ve waited long enough.”
“Please, Dean.” The words sounded like a desperate whimper, and Dean was done for. He snapped his hips at a brutally quick pace and Cas cried out his name as he came all over the wall, his ass squeezing Dean’s cock until he no longer had the willpower to fight his own orgasm. He pulled Cas up and held him to his chest, sucking on his neck and running his hand down Cas’ body to his wet, spent cock. When he felt the evidence of what he’d done to Cas, he bit down to stifle his moan as he emptied inside of him.
Cinna pulled back but kept his hands on Cass’s shoulders. “I wish I could have done more, but you’ve got my full support in whatever you need moving forward.”
With a heavy sigh, Cas disappeared into his bathroom. He opened the drawer just under the sink and rummaged through it - he knew he must have chapstick
Dean’s hands roved over his trench coat and dipped inside, but Cas pulled back. He wasn’t quite ready for Dean to discover what he had hidden there.
Cass laid in that bed until his chest stopped hurting. He had no right to be upset, he knew Dean wasn’t going to stay - he knew he’d never see him again - he had no reason to believe they’d have breakfast together and share some emotional farewell before parting. But this was the price he paid for being who he was. This was why he’d been alone for so long, unable to stomach the idea of falling so quickly and so completely for someone else and have it be unrequited. It was a curse, a curse he’d do anything to get rid of.
Flickerman laughed. “If you count ‘dead’ as ‘fine,’ then yes - Finnick Odair is absolutely splendid right about now. I know this… because I had the ultimate pleasure of killing him myself.”
The sad expression on Hannah’s face told him all he needed to know, and he closed his eyes. He extended his grace out in a last-ditch effort to find the soul that bore his mark, and
Dean’s eyebrows scrunched together as he looked at the bowtruckle, but he looked over at Sam. “Hey, why aren’t you with Alyssa?”
Dean rocked forward, his cock sliding messily in and out of Cass’ mouth as the man listened and worked him open a little faster. It was a weird rhythm to find with the opposing motions, but somehow they did, until Dean was about to burst.
And he did consider it. A summer away from his dad sounded too good to be true. He smiled widely and kissed her again, just as Finnick Odair opened the compartment door and made a very disgusted noise when he saw them. “Oy! Get a room, you two, other people have to share this train too.” He walked over and shimmied himself between them, then looked over at Lisa and winked, clicking his tongue. “Hey Braeden, you miss me?”
“You and I… we’re all each other has left, Dean. I can’t bear the thought of losing you, too. Is that not enough?”
Deft fingers tugged at his balls as the head of his cock slipped past the back of Dean’s mouth and into a tight, constricting throat. Cass moaned loudly, having to remind himself at the last moment that he needed to be careful not to say Dean’s name as he wasn’t yet supposed to know it. His legs were shaking and his balls tightened as he careened towards his release, but at that moment, Dean pulled off with a gasp. A hand replaced his mouth and Dean was stroking him quickly, violently - twisting his hand and licking saliva from his own lips as he bounced.
again. An exact, perfect replica of the apple on her desk appeared next to it. She turned to face the class again. “However, the duplicates are entirely worthless as they will decay over time, so I wouldn’t be getting any ideas about the trophy room if I were you, Mr. Black.” Her cat-like eyes fell on Sirius, who donned the least-convincing expression of innocence that Dean had ever seen. He snorted, looking back at Professor McGonagall. To her credit, she offered Sirius a tiny smile before releasing them to try the spell on their own.
“I wasn’t asking about me, Dean.” He chuckled, watching him. “I was trying to confirm if my dream was true, that’s all.”
Cass swallowed hard and nodded, walking towards the portal. “I’ll see you soon.” He turned back to look at Dean once more and then stepped through.
Cass immediately backed off. “I’m - I’m so sorry, Dean. I thought… I misread the situation.” He stood and moved across the room, leaning his shoulder against the wall pretty much as far away from Dean as the small space would allow.
Castiel tensed, his face flushing slightly. “Okay, Dean. I’ll just- I’ll go. I hope you feel better.” He turned around and picked up his books that he dropped, walking away without looking back.
the guy’s cock felt so good stretching his mouth that he’d break every rule ever created just to feel it do the same thing to his ass.
Sam heard the words come out, but all he could see was Dean. “N-no, Dean, this isn’t funny, okay? Castiel is dead, Rue’s dead, Finnick’s dead, but you - you’re
So Dean had packed his shit and moved to LA, where he’s been ever since. Turns out Cali natives can be dicks though, so he’d found himself in Sam’s office more times than he could count making sure he wasn’t gonna get sued because some dumbass wrecked the car Dean recently rebuilt. He was too good at his job to believe it was anything he ever did.
The top of the chat showed that Patrick hadn’t been online in a couple of hours, and Castiel assumed he was probably sleeping. He moved on to the next one.
Dean watched a couple of guys run up the stairs in the corner and turned to his best friend Charlie. He had to yell in her ear so she’d hear him above the music. “Y’know, if the owners of this joint were bound and determined to name it after a fuckin’ Aerosmith album, they missed the fuckin’ mark by not callin’ it
Dean watched as Castiel disappeared and a carbon copy of himself took his place. “Remember to talk like I do, at least until you’re safe. Now go, go home. Get out of this fuckin’ place. I’ll see you soon.”
, and the deafening roar from the crowd gave Cas a very quick crash course as to why Led Zeppelin was one of the most famous bands to ever take the stage.
His profile picture was a car. Castiel knew next to nothing about vehicles beyond basic operation, but he took an educated guess at the fact that the car was a 1967 Chevrolet Impala based on the screen name. The jet black paint shone in the photo, and Cass couldn’t deny that it was beautiful. He didn’t remember swiping right on this particular profile, but he’d made a few mistakes at the beginning and assumed it must have been one of those.
“Yes, we’ve worked closely for several years. I was the one that officially nominated him to become name partner.”
Or, it wouldn’t have been, if there wasn’t a huge crack of thunder followed by the abrupt stop of the elevator they were in.
isn’t necessarily a great strength for you, but I appreciate it. In my line of work, it’s hard to meet people that see me as anything other than ‘the guy in the band.’ Someone to gawk at and sleep with. I’m on the road constantly… sometimes I think this is the loneliest life I could have ever chosen.”
Dean rolled his eyes, but was more or less thankful for the distraction. He had a feeling he was going to need a lot of those if he was going to survive this year.
He caught bits of conversation as the elevator began to move up, and the two other lawyers ended up getting off three floors early, claiming they needed to stop in their own offices before heading up to the giant meeting room where this little party was supposed to happen.
Castiel closed his eyes again but only momentarily this time, his heart racing because this whole scenario was so familiar. Dean’s hand on Castiel’s face, Castiel’s heart beating this fast. It was just like Christmas, and he knew it would end the exact same way. He wasn’t sure his heart could take that right now, but he wanted it, too. So badly, he wanted it too. “Then what are we supposed to do, Dean? Tell me what we’re supposed to do because I’m telling you, on Christmas, it felt right. I felt… I felt safe and comfortable and everything felt right.”
Dean was never very good at sitting still, so he fidgeted. Pulled his knees in and then stretched them out again, clicking his toes together like fucking Dorothy.
“Does it?” was all he replied, a little put out with himself that he tipped Dean off to the endgame already. Traffic cleared and Cas pulled Dean across the street before he could respond, and the rest of their journey into Madison Square Garden was silent except for the exploding sounds of the city around them.
Yikes. “Yeah, uhh… y’know, we just don’t have a lot of money saved up right now. And it’s just a piece of paper, right?” And I’m not entirely sure I even wanna marry you at all. Dean rolled over, facing away from her. “I get it. Maybe tomorrow, yeah?”
Castiel gripped the back of Dean’s jacket, burying his face in Dean’s neck. “Please don’t die, okay? I- I need you more than anything else. My grandma, my dad, Rue, my mom might as well be dead, I can’t lose you too. Please don’t let me lose you too.”
“Don’t say that, Cass. I’m gonna be alive when you come back for me, okay? Once you get to Hogwarts, you figure out a way to get me out and come back for me. Look, I’ve already got my Gryffindor shirt on again, ready to be
“He was always nice to everyone, except the Death Eaters. And Cato, he was kinda mean to Cato… but to be fair, Cato deserved it.” Dean smiled to himself as he remembered some of Cass’s finer moments, but he felt a pang of sadness when he realized that now, he was left with just the memories. The loneliness was a thing he could taste and feel, despite Prim before with him. It had been less than a full day so far, but Dean already knew that he was in for the worst days of his life. He missed his brother, he missed his friend… and now, he missed his guardian angel.
Castiel forced his eyes to meet Newt’s, who looked frozen. There were only three Unforgivable Curses, and by all counts, the Imperius Curse was the most mild.
“Tell me, James, when you encounter a Boggart, does it turn into a mirror, or just your mum?” Sirius ducked quickly, expecting James to take a swing at him. No such violence ensued, however, because James was gaping at him. His face went from shock to offended amusement, and he barely missed a beat before continuing their game of insults.
Castiel knew that was true, Aunt Naomi took amazing care of his mother. He just wanted to make sure.
Castiel opened his eyes and scanned Dean’s face as if he was trying to memorize everything about it. He tried to speak but no words came out so he leaned forward and kissed Dean, his hands holding onto Dean’s shirt.
Prim circled around in front of him and brought her eyes up to meet his. “It’s not, it’s not impossible at all. Caesar Flickerman murdered him and got away with it.”
He grinned and rolled his eyes and indeed did change into the rest of his robes, tucking his wand into his pocket when he was dressed.
.” Flickerman said those last words as if he was implying that there indeed would be a ‘next time,’ and Sam found himself being dragged out of the courtroom by Cato and Sirius.
Dean wasn’t wearing a plug today, but that was fine. He knew he could open himself up quickly enough while blowing Cass to get him hard, it was something he’d done many times before with other people.
He nearly choked, and quickly pulled the bottle away from his mouth. It wasn’t a graceful movement, but the second that it took to wipe the amber liquid from his chin with the back of his hand bought him time to think.
I know this one is short, but it's kind of an awkward tipping point and I didn't want to go through the entire conversation with his mom. Hope you all are still enjoying this train wreck, see you soon!
Castiel was quickly pulled from his celebrations when he looked at the time and groaned. He slipped away from the rest of his team and quickly ran back to his dormitory to change into his regular school robes before he took off in a sprint towards Professor Trinket’s office.
He drove over to L&N after stopping to grab the booze for this high class little shindig, and it took him way too long to find a spot Baby could safely fit in without the fear that some dumbass, drunk lawyer would scratch her paint job by swinging open the door to his hybrid, computer-run piece of trash vehicle.
He blinked, then glanced at the calendar hung up next to the fridge. Yep, it was definitely Thursday. “Uhh… hey, Lis. Aren’t you gonna be late to your girls… whatever?”
Dean frowned, putting his hands on Cass’s elbows and leaning in to kiss him. “I’ll explain everything, but can we please stop somewhere for the night? It’s gonna be dark soon anyway.”
Snape shifted his eyes between Cass and Mrs. Black, his face in a scowl before nodding. “Very well. We’ll send for you in the morning, Dean. Be ready.”
Dumbass seemed to have settled down. “It just depends on what’s happening elsewhere. It could be minutes, it could be hours.”
“I’m not wearing that.” Cas held up the light pink button down shirt that couldn’t even be considered a shirt - the short sleeves and thin fabric didn’t leave much to the imagination. He stared at the tiny flamingo on the chest and then turned a grumpy stare to his brother Gabriel.
because then it was time for a lengthy drum solo by Bonham. Cas didn’t understand those tears at first, but it occurred to him that John Bonham died in September of 1980, effectively ending Led Zeppelin and putting an end to arguably one of the finest drummers to ever live. Dean was a baby at the time, this would be the first time he ever laid eyes on a living, breathing Bonham. Cas squeezed Dean’s hand a little tighter and sent love through the bond that linked Dean’s soul with Cas’ grace.
. It was delicate and gentle, and Cas was a little surprised by the look on Dean’s face that this song hadn’t made the mixtape.
Dean had stopped touching him. Cass’s eyes opened to see him looking honestly offended. He tilted his head. “Did I touch a nerve?”
Cass rolled his eyes. “Roger Waters is an asshole. Just because I can pass as David Gilmour doesn’t mean I love their story.”
Castiel wasn’t able to contain his tears as he shook his head. His voice cracked as he spoke, “you know that’s not how it works, Dean. You know that this -- this could be the last time I ever see you.”
I've decided to... REALLY up the speed of posting. You guys get the rest of Part Two today... Part Three in it's entirety next Monday, Part Four the first Monday of April.... and then the Epilogue sometime in the days following that, I doubt I'll wait a whole week. I hope that for the very, very few of you that are actually reading this... it helps make your quarantine a little bit easier. - Ketch
Castiel blinked, watching him. He looked a little embarrassed as he dropped his arms to his sides. “I’m sorry- I- I didn’t-.”
Fine, Dean was gonna have to work a little harder than normal. No big deal, it had been awhile since he’d been challenged and he was more than up to the task -- especially when the prize at the end was out-of-this-world sexy.
Cass laughed quietly as he handed Dean his own undershirt to clean up with. “Does this mean you’ll finally agree to go on a date with me?”
He put his phone on silent and laid it face down on his bedside table before crawling under the covers and burying his face in his pillow.
He spent a few moments scrolling through social media as his dinner cooked, and when the microwave beep drew his attention, he took his wine and food into the living room and sat down. For some reason, he wasn’t in the mood for a documentary. He opened the guide on the TV and scrolled through the channels until he came across HBO, which was airing Game of Thrones. He was brought back to his bar date with Dean. He considered texting him, but decided against it and went for the safer option. He opened his messages with Impala back up.
He walked quicker, his mood absolutely in the gutter. He hadn’t been able to think of a single happy memory. He thought he’d found one, but it apparently wasn’t good enough. He’d thought about a time when he was just a kid; before he knew his dad was a hunter. Before his dad found out he’d kissed a boy. Before he’d found out he was a wizard, and the very thing his dad spent his life tracking down and murdering. He’d just been a kid, with a family that loved him and he loved back. No expectations, no pressure to be something or someone that he wasn’t. Or rather, to ignore the something and someone that he
Warm, expert fingers curled around the waistband of his panties and methodically worked them down, teasing both of them with the back and forth movements that revealed what was underneath so slowly it was almost enough to drive Dean insane. When his cock finally sprang free, he was already half-hard, and he attempted to push himself away from the desk so he could turn around.
Sam had forgotten what it felt like to be happy, but in that moment… when he heard the news that his brother was
He pulled his 1967 Chevy Impala into Sam’s driveway and got out, heading inside. He was the last one there and greeted everyone before heading to the kitchen to scrub the grease from his hands. “Smells delicious, what’re we eatin’?”
playing. He was arguably the only musician of his time that did what he did purely because he wanted to share his music with the world. He wasn’t interested in fame or fortune or drugs or even women. It’s speculated that he died a virgin, actually, despite the constant parade of women - and men- that threw themselves at him.”
He huffed, looking away from Castiel. “Yeah, trust me, I fuckin’ remember. But it took you, what, like 6 seconds to heal me and get me back on my feet? This wasn’t any different than any of the other hunts we’ve gone on where I get my shit rocked and you patch me up. But we
“I just mean you and your brother are very different creatures. You were presumably raised in the same household, so was it really nurture at all?”
Castiel looked a little panicky and really unsure but he nodded and wiped his cheeks with the backs of his hands, keeping his eyes on Dean. “T-tell me what I have to do.”
Twenty minutes later, Dean walked out of the bathroom and Cas tucked away the mixtape Dean had made him all those years ago.
not the guilt they deserve. I have never felt less guilty about anything in my entire life. Valiant effort, for sure… and better luck
Castiel cleared his throat and looked to Sirius. “I think I hear James calling you. Dean, you hear it too, right?”
Sam smacked Sirius before he could reply, because Headmaster Shurley, Professor Mills and Professor McGonagall were standing at the front of the room now, and every single one of them looked
And then, it was time. The moment Cas had been waiting for for years. Several people paired off around them to slow dance when they recognized the beginning of
Sirius frowned at both of them. “I don’t hear anything, but you’re probably right. What would he do without me?” He stood, stepping over Finnick’s still outstretched legs, opening the door and disappearing back into the main part of the train.
if the curves and lines of his cock didn’t fill him up completely. It was such an oddly comforting feeling despite the faint burn that Dean thought he could fall asleep just like that, his own cock leaking and forgotten.
Sam’s anger flared and his hands curled into fists at his side. He looked almost desperately towards Osiris, nearly jumping out of his skin with the desire and need to speak.
He had waited until the last possible moment to take his second-to-last dose of polyjuice potion, so he had appeared to Snape the next morning as Dean and taken straight to Voldemort’s home. He now walked through a long, dimly lit hallway towards a door at the end of it.
He dropped back to his feet and landed with a squishy thud thanks to the dampness in his shoes from his dash inside.
Dean had done well enough on his exams that he was permitted to go back to Hogwarts, but that’s about all that could be said of his results. He had been absolutely correct about his dad’s reaction to another owl showing up, and if it wasn’t for the fact that Hogwarts didn’t use the muggle grading system, he was sure he would have gotten his ass beat. As it was, he was able to convince his dad that the “P” he got in Dark Arts stood for “passing” instead of “poor,” and that his “A” in Charms wasn’t the lowest possible passing grade he could have received.
…. Please see the above answer, although now I’m starting to wonder if the previous question was asking something different. Perhaps you should be more specific. Inquire within.
Her face fell and her shoulders slumped. “I guess I should have seen that coming. I’m glad though… for Castiel. That he got out. He was always nice to me.”
Castiel folded the last of his clothes that he was planning on bringing back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for his
He breathed out rather shakily and closed his eyes. He held his wand out and tried to go back in time to his happiest memory. He remembered the way Dean’s lips felt on his, the way his hand felt on Dean’s chest. He was so relaxed, so content at that time. He breathed out again and did the movement with his wand while saying “
“We’ve had a month, Cass. A month where we didn’t have to walk constantly or fight constantly or do anything but be here and watch this damn potion brew. It’s high time you got out of here and got a decent meal and a shower.” Dean’s heart was threatening to break in half, but he forced his voice to remain steady. “Now kiss me and go home.”
“Yeah, y’know… just been a long day. I went to work before I came out here, and it ain’t like it was a short drive.”
Sam chuckled a little and nodded. “Yeah, uh… Jess and I got engaged a coupla days ago. We wanted you guys to be the first to know, we’re gonna tell mom and dad tomorrow.”
Castiel dropped all of his books and simply stepped forward, wrapping his arms around Dean. “I’m sorry.”
It was Newt that grabbed Sam to hold him back. He clamped his hand over Sam’s mouth and forced him back to his seat, although Sam didn’t even remember standing up. Newt’s voice was desperate and quiet as he whispered, “Sam, you can’t. We were never going to be able to speak here, they brought us here to remind us of who we’re dealing with. You
He gave a noncommittal shrug in response, looking at the floor and trying not to think about what was potentially in store for him. “Yeah, I guess.  It’s gonna be like any other year, right?”
Lisa didn’t take long to make her way to bed. Before Dean knew it, she was pulling the covers back and crawling in. He was torn between attempting a fake snore and just keeping his eyes closed in an attempt to make her think he’d already fallen asleep, but she apparently wasn’t havin’ any of it.
He turned, stopping in his tracks. “What? You decide you wanna say somethin’ too? About how the great, confident Dean Winchester cried like a fucking bitch? About how I don’t have a single fucking happy memory, and how everyone fucking knows it now?” He was angry, angry at so many things. Castiel wasn’t necessarily one of them, but he was there. He was there and stupid enough not to walk away, so Dean didn’t apologize.
His parents never came to see him or Sam get on the train… they’d drive them to King’s Cross, but Dean had never been able to get them to even get out of the car. He frowned at the yellowing pages of  the journal that used to connect him to his father. Now, the stories of creatures John Winchester had hunted only caused a pit to form in Dean’s stomach. Sure, the stories were great when Dean was a kid. His dad was a hunter, which to most kids would have meant he got dressed in some sort of camo and hunted deer, or maybe coyotes, but it didn’t take long for Dean to find out that his father’s targets were much…
He teleported to Heaven, his wings extended wide behind him. As he walked towards the garden, he noticed flashes of white in his periphery - when he turned his head to see the cause, he stopped dead in his tracks. For the first time in years, his wings were white and glowing with holy light. To his surprise, he immediately felt disconnected from them, like they weren’t his at all - but some foreign entities reminding him that for the foreseeable future, everything in his world was going to be wrong. He tucked them away, no longer wanting the reminder that his connection to Dean Winchester was gone.
Rationally, he knew he was hungry. He knew he should eat something, chug a bottle of water and scrub himself raw in the shower before finally succumbing to sweet unconsciousness in his bed. But all of those things sounded like they were going to take more energy than he could muster in a hundred lifetimes. His limbs felt like jelly as he climbed the stairs to his shitty apartment and when he closed the door behind him, he didn’t even bother taking off his boots.
“Finnick’s dead. Finnick Odair? You guys were friends, right?” Prim kept her head tilted forward towards the ground but her eyes were on Dean.
“So, you’re obviously attractive… good with your hands, you like westerns and hate Roger Waters. Is there anything else I should know about you before I share a bed with you, Dean?”
Castiel didn’t bother acknowledging him and instead of thinking about writing his lines, his mind was playing over every scenario that occured between him and Dean, trying to pinpoint a reason he could be upset. He sighed and looked back down at his parchment and realized that instead of writing the word ‘class’, he had scribbled down ‘Dean’ instead, his sentence now reading, ‘I must not leave Dean.’ He quickly tore that piece of parchment out and crumpled it up, clearing his throat and starting again.
Sam was surprised to see Cato Chester, Newt Scamander, and Beetee Latier sitting at the front of the Hufflepuff table. They’d all graduated last year, but Sam supposed they were invited as a courtesy to hear how their Games ended. This wasn’t typical, in every year prior there were no survivors
“You’re a real dick, y’know that?” And yet, Dean’s mouth found Cass’s again and chased his retort away with an insistent, delicious tongue.
“Here.” He sat down at his desk across from Dean and slid one of the mugs over to him. “There’s a bit of firewhiskey in there too, not enough that the taste is greatly affected, but enough that it should help calm your nerves.”
Under normal circumstances, Dean Winchester had the best aim of anyone at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and certainly of anyone that played Quidditch there. He rarely missed his mark, especially when it was a mark he was near desperate to hit. But these weren’t normal circumstances. The stakes were too high after a year of too many lows, and it didn’t help that bludgers had minds of their own. It hit just slightly to Charlie’s right, which meant that it hit the arm that Finnick Odair had stretched out, just inches from the Snitch. Inches from victory. Dean watched in silent horror as Finnick’s left arm broke and he pulled it back from the Snitch to cradle it against his body. It was a testament to Finnick’s superior flying abilities that he didn’t fall off his broom in the torrential downpour. Finnick reached out wildly with his good arm, but he was a split second too late. Charlie Bradbury’s fingers closed around the Golden Snitch, and it was over.
His eyes flicked between Cass’s and he nodded. “I know. But luckily for you, I got enough faith here for both of us. There’s nobody else I’d trust with my life like this, probably not even Sammy.” He pulled Cass into a hug and held on tight.
Dean nodded, his fingers fumbling slightly as he pulled his shirt back on. He left his tie off but put his robes back on as well. “He’s not abusive, he just gets mad sometimes.”
The compartment door slid open and Raphael Helm stuck his fat, ugly head in. He looked from Dean on the floor to Cass on the seat and his eyebrows disappeared into his hair. “I came to let you know it’s time to change into robes, but suddenly I’m surprised you two have clothes on at all.” He looked at Castiel. “I suppose this explains a couple of things, doesn’t it?”
Dean fought tears as he spoke. “I’m not gonna die, angel. I’m gonna be waitin’ here for you to come back for me. And I know you will, I know you’ll come back.” He pulled back from the hug, knowing this part was almost over. “I’ve thought about this every fucking day for months, and I think I’ve got a plan if you’re ready to hear it.”
Cass didn’t answer right away, and Dean took the gap in conversation as a chance to drink. Whiskey, not wine. He didn’t hate wine, but at this point, he was choosing whiskey just to remind both of them how different they really were.
to, he had forced him to repeat the process on 4 other students. 5 times. He had cast an Unforgivable Curse 5 times, and he had hated every one of them.
she looked lost. She had fallen into this hole and hadn’t been able to pull herself out. Castiel remembered the summer of his fourth year when he came home and saw her. He couldn’t believe she used to be his upbeat, cheery mother.
Just as he made his mind up to turn around and skip a lesson for the first time in his life, Professor Crane appeared at the top of the staircase. Castiel attended his lessons last year as well, but he didn’t think he’d ever quite yet used to the unsettling way Seneca Crane trimmed his beard. It looked ridiculous, as far as Castiel was concerned, and it was horribly distracting. It rose like a wave on the middle of his face and yet, the curves of it somehow sharpened his features. That was a trait he usually enjoyed, but with Professor Crane, it was just off-putting. Maybe it wasn’t the beard at all, maybe it was just the man.
Dean pointedly stopped looking at his hands. In the absence of that distraction, he looked just about everywhere else
Professor Crane scanned the room, and watched as several other students also pulled their books, parchment and quills from their bags and set them on their desks. When the class stilled, he stood with his hands folded behind his back and addressed them. “You can put those away. Today’s lesson won’t be found in
Cass wanted to close his eyes and revel in the feeling of Dean’s cock stretching every part of his mouth and that glorious hand on his wing, but he didn’t want to miss a single second of Dean’s expression. He looked almost wild, his green irises barely visible around lust-blown pupils, sweat beading down his forehead… mouth hanging slightly open as he fucked Castiel’s mouth with borderline violence.
you feelin’ safe. There’s things… there’s things I didn’t mention, about my dad. About what he does for a living. It might not just be me in danger if we - if I…” Dean’s eyes dropped to Castiel’s lips again.
Dean’s pants were around his ankles and the panties were split at the bottom, giving him a crystal clear view of the jeweled black plug Dean was showing off. Dean looked over his shoulder at Cass and bit his lip. “Like what you see?”
Professor Trinket then called several more students to the front, none of whom produced anything close to what Castiel did. A few managed that strange mist, but nothing with any real shape. Dean kept his eyes on the desk until Professor Trinket called his name.
little dating profile. Chances are, no one will even respond. You don’t even have to reply if they do, but you cannot spend one more Saturday night alone in this apartment hiding from your brother. You’re a grown man. Act like it.”
And yet, all the signs pointed right in that direction. Something like shame coiled itself in Dean’s stomach, and he was positive it had nothing to do with the whiskey he drank. He was so distracted by that horrifying thought that he missed the drive for the motel entirely and had to loop all the way around, and by the time he parked his car he’d convinced himself he’d just tell Cass nothing was going to happen and they’d sleep in separate beds. Except… they wouldn’t have separate beds. They had
He stripped slowly once they were safely hidden in the back room, making sure Cass had a clear view of the hard muscles and soft curves his clothes had hidden. This time would be different, he was breaking his own rule by letting Cass fuck him but god
Castiel shifted on his feet and kept his eyes down, blinking quickly as if he was trying to fight tears. “I…” he paused for a long moment and then nodded once. “If that’s what you want, I’ll do it. I don’t like it and I’m-” the tears were definitely falling now, “I’m so fucking scared but if that’s what you want…” he swallowed hard. “I’ll do it.”
Dean slowed down, leaning forward to bite Cas’ shoulder. “Now, now, Cas. You’ve got me high as a fuckin’ kite here, I’m not finished with you.”
Castiel opened his eyes, his stomach flipping at the new nickname and he realized that was going to make this a lot harder. “What? What’s wrong with it?”
But as he watched Lisa’s features go slack and her body relax, he knew the Professor was as serious as it gets.
He stayed standing for a while, before he moved back down to where he was sitting before, taking the quill out of Dean’s hands. “Dean, I’m sorry too. I shouldn’t have exploded like that. I just- it’s not your fault and I don’t want you to leave me alone. I want- I want us to be able to be friends for more than twenty minutes at a time. I don’t understand what’s going on. I thought I did, but now I’ve never been more unsure of anything. I even feel more confident with the whole ‘Wingardium Leviosa’ thing than I do with this.”
“You always were a boy of few words, weren’t you… now speak. Tell me, Dean, how did you come to find the portal?” Sure enough, the giant snake that Dean had warned him about was slithering across the floor towards Voldemort’s chair as he spoke.
Sirius cut in. “Yeah, and you’re afraid if you do, you’ll cry harder than Winchester did during Dark Arts.” Dean looked at him, shocked and a little hurt, but then Sirius laughed. It wasn’t mocking or hurtful, it was the sort of laugh only his best friend could pull off. It wasn’t enough to make Dean laugh in return, but it took a little bit of the edge off. He playfully punched his shoulder. “Shut up.”
There were nearly a dozen of them in all, each one similar to the last. He smiled to himself at what Dean’s face must have looked like as he wrote them, all flushed and nervous and maybe even a little regretful. He unabashedly took a couple of his favorites before pitching the rest of them again and hurrying out of the room. He assumed Dean hadn’t checked out, so he went to the main lobby of the hotel to do it for him lest Dean be charged for another day. Without a last name, it wasn’t easy, but the room number and description seemed to be enough that the girl knew who he was talking about.
It started raining, and heavily. It didn’t concern Dean a whole lot; he knew that Finnick had an uncanny ability to see in all sorts of weather conditions which was one of the things that made him such an insanely good Seeker. It did, however, make it harder to keep a good grip on his bat.
She nodded. “Everyone here saw, most of them just smiled and returned to whatever they were doing before.”
“You mustn't give up on her, Castiel. She would have never given up on you. You know that,” Aunt Naomi scolded him. “Now, go tell her goodbye and meet me in the car.”
Castiel pulled at his hair and shook his head quickly, taking a deep breath. “Okay, Dean. I’ll…” he nodded slowly again, “fuck I’ll- I’ll do my best.”
Castiel opened his eyes, immediately dropping them to the floor. “Dean, you didn’t have to- I know you weren’t- it would’ve been-”
But now? Dean’s breath was hitching as Cass’s hands slid under his shirt and yes, those were Dean’s fingers digging into his sides and hooking into his belt loops.
Voldemort nodded almost approvingly. “Yes, you did. You bested my best - something that has been handled internally, I assure you… there won’t be any such mistakes moving forward. Now, Dean, tell me… what do you want to happen now?”
time. Just take care of yourself, ya hear? Give me a call if you need someone to verbally whoop your ass.”
saw them. He noticed that not a single person was looking at them though, they had all returned to the conversations they’d been having before this little public display of affection. He breathed out, his heart thumping wildly in his chest. “I think --- I think it’s okay, I don’t think anyone really cares.”
“You are mine now, Dean, just as it should be. You should thank me for the honour. Without me, you would be nothing, your blood would have seen to that.” Voldemort admired the mark on Cass’s arm for a moment and then returned to his seat. “Leave, I have no use for you right now. Severus will see you out.”
Dean’s eyes quickly raked over Castiel, stripping him bare. They lingered on the AC/DC shirt and leather jacket he’d chosen in lieu of the trench coat and then traveled down to stop entirely on the bulge pressing against his jeans. Yes, Castiel seems to have chosen the correct outfit. “Go flip the open sign to closed and find out.”
Castiel rolled his eyes as Finnick stood, leaving the compartment and mumbling something about how Cass and Annie were on the same Quidditch team, and Castiel must just be blind.
Sam’s summer had been a long one. As he’d suspected, his parents had no idea that Dean had been Chosen. They hadn’t been told a damn thing, so it was on Sam to break the news that their first born son was likely never coming home. He had braced himself for pain and tears and sorrow, but none came. His mom seemed… sad, but apparently not enough to outright cry. His father simply shook his head, and remarked that he always knew Dean “wouldn’t amount to much. Now, he won’t amount to anything.”
“You’re fuckin’ jokin’, Cas. You can’t be serious.” Dean tugged at the fabric of his shirt in an attempt to stretch it out. “Are you entering us in the circus? That what this mystery date is?”
Shurley paused to let the students control themselves, but he was laughing and smiling right along with them. Professor Mills was crying in relief next to him, and even the usually stoic Professor McGonagall was applauding.
Sam hugged Dean back, chuckling quietly. “Of course you’re gonna be my best man, Dean. I would never even consider anyone else.”
Cass’s chest tightened. “Of course I did, Dean. I’m sorry I didn’t say something or do something sooner, I just… you’d been through so much, I didn’t want to add anything else if it turned out you didn’t feel the same.”
Dean just shook his head quickly, sinking further into his seat before Professor Trinket insisted he come try the spell.
The group of students filed into the classroom behind Professor Crane and took their seats. When Castiel sat down at the end of a row, the other students seemed to make a point of avoiding the seat directly next to him. This didn’t bother him, until Lisa Braeden was the one that filled the spot. He pointedly ignored her and opened his book.
He was pushed back down and Cass thrust back in. “Patience, Dean. I simply wanted to make sure I still had your full attention.”
Dean’s eyes landed on an absolutely beautiful man standing alone by the bar and looking as stiff as Dean’s drink. His eyes traveled slowly over his body and he studied the way his muscles moved under that stupid shirt. That stupid, ridiculous pink shirt that somehow had Dean wanting to rip it off with his teeth. He pulled his bottom lip between his teeth and pushed off the wall. “See ya later, Charles!”
“Come now, Dean, you’re smarter than that. I will know if you lie…” Voldemort reached down and ran his hand along the snake, who hissed in Castiel’s direction. “And you know what I do to those who dare to lie to my face.”
“As I was saying,” Professor Shurley began again, “our tributes fought valiantly, but as we all are aware, only one shall make it out alive. I am…
people around him grinded and rutted against each other until it looked a little bit like the makings of an orgy. He was bored by it at this point, but it still made him want to take part.
fuckin’ proud of him right about now; the fuck up with more body mods than he could count anymore covered in some stranger’s jizz. Well, at least John Winchester had to hate him from afar now. Shame Dean couldn’t say the same for himself.
Dean grabbed his books quickly, shoving Castiel’s in his own bag and slinging it over his shoulder. He reached out for Cass’s hand and pulled him out of the room. “Shit, we’re lucky that wasn’t somebody else.”
Flickerman’s trial was in two days, and Sam and the other tributes had been called as witnesses for the prosecution. Sam had never seen a wizard trial, but he knew they took place somewhere at the Ministry of Magic. If Flickerman was found guilty, he’d likely be serving a life sentence in Azkaban for not only murder, but using an Unforgivable Curse on another human. Sam knew the chances of him not walking free were slim since Voldemort controlled the Ministry and the wizarding world as a whole, but he hoped that Voldemort would be pissed enough that Flickerman lost control of Hogwarts that he wouldn’t intervene on his behalf. He thought there was at least a decent chance that they’d get a fair trial, and Sam had been studying magical law and court proceedings for the last few months in preparation.
Dean seemed to have gotten the hint. He nudged Finnick’s legs off of the seat. “Shouldn’t you be drooling over Lisa or something?”
Here, have another - we all need a little bit of cute Destiel communication right now, given how this current season is going...
Dean landed on the ground with a wet, muddy squelch, and Sirius landed next to him moments later. “Don’t say it.” Dean growled. “Just don’t… fucking say it.”
Cass looked like he was serious, and Dean wasn’t in a position to argue further. “Yeah, okay. One date.”
“Congratulations, by the way. You made some good saves out there.” Dean didn’t look up, but at least he said
found it. Castiel immediately teleported to him, leaving Hannah to fend for herself against the horde of demons closing in. Dean was on the ground, bloody and broken, with a demon pacing circles around him.
Dean couldn’t seem to get his heart rate back to normal, and he was dangerously close to vomiting. “No, no, it’s fine, it’s cool, it was bound to happen eventually, right? And maybe none of them noticed, or they won’t say anything, it’s not like any of our friends saw it. Fuckin’ Raphael didn’t even see it, where’d that fuckin’ prick go, anyway?”
but kept speaking. “That’s alright, I didn’t want to punish you anyway. Run along, and quickly, before I change my mind.”
Thank you guys so much for the continued support, I love you all. Hope you enjoyed my little rock and roll fantasy :)
He moaned and cussed, and Cass kept moving until he was fully seated inside of him, which punched the air right from his lungs.
igniting the crowd and putting an end to Dean’s tears. He was dancing and laughing, singing along and urging Cas to do the same. Which, he did.
Neither one of them slept much anymore between the constant need to search for the portal and the nightmares that plagued them both, but they’d lie in hidden caves wrapped around each other for a few hours here and there anyway. Cass appreciated those moments, because he was reminded by the way that Dean held onto him for dear life that Dean needed him too. Everything he’d agreed to with Dean’s plan was for
He pulled his shirt away from his skin and groaned at the way the sweat caused the fabric to cling in all the wrong places. It was getting hot in that elevator, and not just because Cass had ditched his trench coat and rolled his sleeves up. The lack of central air cooling that death box down meant the temperature was rising higher with each passing hour.
He set his quill down as well, looking over at him. “I mean, you probably did. Bludgers hurt like a son of an assbutt.”
Dean nodded, though it was a movement Castiel couldn’t see with closed eyes. “I get it, angel. I do. But there’s a problem with your plan.”
Cass didn’t come around to Dean’s side of the desk. He braced his palms on the wood in front of him and leaned forward. “Open your Transfiguration book, Dean. We’ve got actual work to do.”
The bond between them ignited with a flash of hope from Dean that disappeared almost as quickly as it started. “Yeah, but there’s always consequences. It’s never that damn simple.”
Castiel shrugged, breathing out. “I wouldn’t know what I was either. Perhaps we could help each other figure it out?”
It was Dean’s 24th birthday when Castiel finally decided enough was enough. He was still no closer to finding out who did this to them and he was nearly coming apart at the seams from being away from Dean. He’d originally planned on waiting until Dean was a little older this time around, but something about the lip piercing, bright purple hair and tattoos covering almost every inch of Dean’s body told him that Dean needed him
The absurdity of the thought had Dean nearly in stitches. He did his best to mimic Doc Holliday as he said, “I’m your Huckleberry!”
He debated about writing back, but impala hadn’t been overly forward and sometimes he could even be fun to talk to.
That word echoed in his head like an audible fucking nightmare. Groupies were loose chicks that were desperate for attention from any rockstar they could come across. Most of them were used up fast and thrown away, only to be heard from again as fuckin’ punch lines at parties. Dean Winchester was not a
Castiel nodded to Rue and made his way back to the compartment. He grabbed his robes from his bag and then made his way to the restrooms as well. He knocked on the door, pressing his ear up against it. “Dean?”
“Where the hell are we, anyway?” Dean’s voice was still laced with bitterness and anger, but at least he was talking.
He found a small tube of it and hastily dragged it across his bottom lip several times, then rolled his lips together in an effort to spread it around. It did feel better, and certainly looked better, but he’d never tell Gabriel that. He leaned a little closer to the mirror and frowned, his lips always looked more pink than red but this seemed… accentuated. Cas took another look at the chapstick and groaned quietly. There, in small letters, were the words ‘Tinted Lip Balm.’ It wasn’t quite lipstick, but it may as well have been. “Damnit.”
She shook her head, smiling sadly. “Not until summer. The Christmas holiday is over already and they won’t be permitted to leave again until end of term. The ban on Owl Post was lifted this year though, so I might be able to get a letter to him before the official announcement is made. He’ll be so happy to hear you’re safe, Dean!” She smiled more genuinely now, clapping her hands together. “I was so afraid for you… I’d never thought much of you, to be honest, you were always getting my Sirius in trouble, you know. But then you and that other boy managed to save Sirius from… well, you know exactly what you saved him from now, don’t you?” She walked towards him and hugged him, wrapping her arms fully around him. “Thank you for bringing him home. I’m sorry I couldn’t send more than the gun, but did you get my note?”
as Dumbass’s eyes traveled down and settled somewhere on his chest. He was finally dry from the rain bath he took on the way in, but he still knew he looked good. And judging by the look on that guy’s face, he knew it, too.
text to Charlie and collapsed on the couch, hugging a ratty throw pillow to his chest as he curled in on himself and willed his thoughts to shut up long enough that he could go to sleep.
The words came so much easier in his head. He’d never been able to say them out loud, but… maybe now it was time. “Dean, I…” He trailed off, his nerve already failing him.
“What’s the rush, Dean? If this is all you’ll ever let me have, I want to take my time. Fuck you properly.”
She frowned at him but took the scroll and unrolled it, her eyes flicking back and forth across the page as she read:
and decided to teach you something that would normally be taught in a different class. As your Professor, it is my duty to prepare you for the real world, especially when the real world is let into our castle by Death Eaters.” She spoke simply, but Dean’s eyebrows shot up. To the best of his knowledge, none of the other professors had ever explicitly stated that they knew what Seneca Crane was. He was fully paying attention now.
“I dunno, Cas. Surprise me, just make it far away from here,” Dean said as he pushed himself up off the couch. “The whole place smells like vamp guts.”
The words came out with more bark than he actually felt, but for once he was grateful for it. Cass nodded and set down his quill.
Seven steps it took him to get to the couch. Seven agonizing, long steps which caused the plug to shift in ways that triggered levels of self-hatred inside of Dean he hadn’t even known were possible. With defiant tears pricking in his eyes, he shoved his pants down far enough to remove the bastard thing and chuck it across the room. It hurt like hell, he was over sensitive as it was and that thing wasn’t small by anyone’s estimation, but at least it was out. That was one thing he did for himself at least, even if he was ignoring every single other piece of the Dean Winchester’s Self-Aftercare Handbook. Fuck it, if he couldn’t even manage to care about himself, how could he ever expect anyone else to? It was better this way. He shot a quick
Dean’s knee slid up between Cass’s legs and pressed against his balls in a way that might have been painful had he not been so far gone.
Dean chuckled. “Yeah, thanks, man. I highly doubt I’ll be takin’ you up on that offer, but I appreciate it anyway.”
“You know… I lived through what happens when you succeed in doing what you were there to do. You die, Azazel. Sam Winchester never becomes the Boy King and everything you worked for falls apart. You owe this pleasure to the fact that the Winchesters deserved a better life, and I should have done this the first time.” Cass squeezed his whole hand around the gun, pulling the trigger. A blast of light erupted from the tip of the barrel and the bullet smacked Azazel right between the eyes. As Azazel died, Cass lowered the gun and let out a breath mixed with relief and sadness. It was done, the Winchesters were saved - but now, he had to wait at least twenty years to fulfill his promise to Dean.
“Well hello to you too, cher. I’m doin’ just fine, thanks for askin’.” Benny’s deep cajun accent soothed some of the irritation that was tensing Dean’s muscles and setting him on edge. “I called to find out how you were doin’. The last time we talked, you sounded a little… well, we’ll call it ‘stressed.’ You good, brother?”
the deceased to release the professor prior to taking more drastic actions?” Osiris began a slow descent down the stairs in between two sections of seating, making his way towards Flickerman.
But Cass, apparently, wasn’t other people. When Dean went to slide out of his panties, Cass gripped his hands and spun him around.
That word bouncing around in his brain just brought him back to the reality of the situation. “I gotta go, Charlie. You handle closing up today?”
“She can and she will,” was Dean’s only response before he pushed himself to his feet and walked forward. His legs bowed out at an odd angle, something Castiel wouldn’t have even noticed if it wasn’t for how obviously Dean was struggling to take steps forward.
be.” His eyes widened slightly as he realized that he’d actually done it, he’d actually stood up and said those things aloud. He noticed every pair of eyes in the room was trained on his face, but he set his jaw and stood his ground. Of course, a vast majority of the students in the room misunderstood his intention, but Castiel didn’t know that.
Castiel breathed out and nodded. “Yes, you and me both. But Professor Cinna — Dean is still in Purgatory. It’s not just him. There’s many students who are still alive, they’ve built a life for themselves there.”
Cass opened his eyes and nodded as he re-adjusted himself, laying so his head was in Dean’s lap. “You’ll stay here, right?”
“Hey, you’re gonna be okay. Listen, we’re not alone out here, okay? You remember hearing about Bobby Singer, right? He’s alive, he’s here, he’s kickin’ ass…
was why humans enjoyed things like this. He never quite grasped why anyone wanted to stand in a mass of sweaty, gross people and have their eardrums blown out, but it was
“It’s about damn time you say it right.” Dean looked up at him. “You wanna understand? Fine.” Dean stood up and pulled his robe off. “Something you might not have noticed on Christmas cuz you were never behind me.” He loosened his tie and pulled it off, then his undershirts followed. He turned around, revealing a criss-crossed pattern of what looked like old, thick scars. “Makin’ a little more sense yet?”
The girl stood, her hand covering smothering a giggle. Dean rolled his eyes, but couldn’t argue Trinket’s point - the girls certainly looked happier than the boys right now. She stepped forward, clearing her throat and donning a straight face. She didn’t seem to have to search very long for a happy memory, because she quickly shouted the incantation and immediately produced that same, silvery cloud that Remus had. Professor Trinket made an unimpressed sound, but clapped all the same. “Who would like to go next?” The girl appeared slightly out of breath as she walked back to her seat and sat down, exchanging an excited smile with the girl sitting next to her.
“I’m fine. It’s fine. Everything’s peachy. Don’t worry about it, you might hurt yourself.” He flinched, just barely.
Cass obliged, picking a new patch of skin to taste as Dean let out a moan. Cass broke his cardinal rule and scanned Dean’s mind, searching for any sign of hesitation or resistance. What he found there had his cock rapidly thickening inside his slacks. Dean was already imagining what it would feel like to fuck - or be fucked
His shoulders slumped and he made an effort to cut off all outside light - closing doors and drawing curtains until he was curled up in bed and his room was pitch black. He didn’t expect to sleep, but that didn’t stop him from closing his eyes and willing himself to slip back into unconsciousness.
He felt Azazel’s presence before he actually saw him. Cass turned quickly, still invisible, and threw himself at the demon. When their bodies connected, he teleported to Stull Cemetery and rolled into a standing position, pointing the gun directly at Azazel’s head. He dropped the camouflage and pulled back the hammer.
“On Christmas you said ‘last time’. Did you- have you- before me?” He asked quietly, his hand moving towards Dean’s, seemingly on its own.
“What’s up assholes?” Cato swung into his seat and smirked. “You think Winchester pulled it off or what?”
Castiel leaned into Dean again and wrapped his arms around him, burying his face in Dean’s neck. “I don’t want to go, Dean. I -- I know I have to but I really don’t want to go without you.”
A long, bitter drag of whiskey later, Dean’s brain shorted out. “Oh. Uhh. Yeah. Oh. I’m uhh… no, I’m not.”
His words were cut off by Dean pressing the tip of his cock against Cas’ hole and slowly sliding in. The tight ring of muscles contracted just under the head and Dean swore under his breath, placing a hand between Cas’ shoulders and the other on his waist. “Fuck, Pink. You’re so tight, feel so damn good wrapped around my cock like this.” He’d slipped back to the old nickname and he knew it, but that’s all he could see in his mind. The shirt, the lips, the blush of his skin… the pucker of his entrance and the beautiful fucking curves of his cock. Everything about Cas was pink, and Dean would be damned if it didn’t seem like he’d found himself a new favorite color… or at the very least, a new kink. He’d never tell him, though.
He wasn’t sure when he became the person people just casually mentioned dead parents to, but after his encounter with Dean, he felt this was a similar situation where he shouldn’t dwell too much on that part.
He walked slowly towards the door as it opened, and his brother Dean stepped through. He stood there in shock for a moment before dropping the glass he was holding and rushing over to him, hugging him tightly. “Jesus, Dean, you did it, man! Welcome back!”
Dean turned quickly, his eyes cloudy but almost hopeful. He cleared his throat. “Yeah, yeah we do.” He started walking towards Cass, his steps no longer forced.
Azazel’s eyes flashed yellow, his stance changing as he turned more defensive. “Castiel, to what do I owe the pleasure?”
Christmas.” He watched his hand again, before he breathed out and whispered, “fuck it.” He grabbed Dean’s hand again, probably more aggressively than intended, keeping his eyes on them as he spoke. “Do you know why I’ve never kissed- or never even looked at a girl before?”
He’d wiped Dean’s memory before letting him leave. He knew if he didn’t, that encounter might be something that stuck in his head that could lead to awkward questions when they were reintroduced later in his life. He had to hope that Dean would be able to put up with whatever John threw at him, because now… it was all the more clear to Castiel that he needed to figure out who had done this to them. Setting aside the fact that he’d already tried everything he could think of, he refocused his efforts in heaven.
The wait for his taxi was excruciating, and the ride itself was even worse. The driver kept glancing in the rearview mirror at him, and Cass knew just from the soreness alone that he was staring at at least one giant, purple hickey on his neck. He refused to look ashamed, because he wasn’t. While being an openly gay man in Montana wasn’t the easiest thing in the world, it also wasn’t as bad as other places, and there was nothing about the hickey that would suggest which gender caused it. They rode in silence, and Castiel sighed with relief when he was finally back in his own home and could drop the
“Yeah, yeah. Food first, ask questions later, right?” He turned to kiss her properly and then nodded towards his brother. “You good?”
“No, not quite. Will you relax? I need you to trust me, we don’t have a lot of time to get where we’re going.”
“Good.” Aunt Naomi started the car and drove in silence for a while before she finally spoke again. “Did she say anything to you?”
“Yes.” Cinna went on to explain how to access the room, and then pulled the invisibility cloak out and handed it to him. “Use this.”
“Dean I -” she rolled to face him, placing her hand on his cheek. “You have work in the morning, and I gotta get up with Ben.” She ran her her fingers through his hair. “Besides, I might be a lot more willing to celebrate if I were the one getting engaged.”
Cas’s bones turned to jelly and he was unembarrassed by the whimpering sound he made at those words. How he
Raphael let out a condescending laugh and turned to leave. “I should have known.” He walked out of the compartment, moving to the next one.
Welcome to part three! If you made it this far, I love you. Grab a blanket, something stiff, and maybe some tissues. This is gonna be a bumpy ride.
Sam sipped his beer and then shrugged. “Can’t complain, you know? Finals are a bitch, but I’m getting through them. I just want to graduate.”
“Oh good, you guys have room.” Sirius pushed his way in between Newt and Sam, giving the latter a dirty look - probably because he was huge and hard to get around.
Those two don’t even know I’m here. Watch.” He moved his eyes to the blur of teenage bodies still tussling on the grass and said loudly, “Hey, guys, it’s Dean! You should probably quit killin’ each other now.” Neither James nor Sirius gave any indication that they heard him, so he turned back to Remus with a look that said
Dean held a finger to his lips to signal that Cass needed to shut the hell up, and he pointed his wand at the bicorn.
Dean swallowed and turned, plastering on a grin he hoped didn’t appear half as nervous as he felt. “Nah, I mean… I’d be lyin’ if I said I wasn’t gettin’ ready to, but… here I am. What happened in there?”
So much for not giving names. “Well hey, Cas. I’m Dean.” He traced the flamingo on Cas’ shirt and chuckled quietly, not even he could deny the Aerosmith pun on that guy’s shirt.
Cass hummed, his tongue gliding under Dean’s length as his cheeks hollowed out around him. He flicked his ocean blue eyes up to Dean’s, pulling back until just the tip of Dean’s cock was still trapped between his lips. “
A quick check told him that the call button wasn’t doing shit, and after sliding open the escape hatch tile and doing some near acrobatics to boost himself up into the small opening, he’d discovered they’d stopped in the middle of a floor so no amount of trying to pry open doors would do them any good. They were too close to the top to actually try to climb out - if the elevator abruptly started working again, they could get crushed.
“Cassie… I don’t think you understand what that color does for your complexion. How is anyone supposed to know you’re gay if you constantly look like an angry accountant?”
Dean might has well have slapped him in the face. He was praying, and not to him. Dean Winchester was a lot of things, but he was
“Yes, we’ve… covered that already.” Cass was trying not to smirk, but it was clear in the way his eyes - his stupid, stupid blue eyes - lit up that he couldn’t hold it back if you paid him.
Dean walked aimlessly for what felt like hours. It was the middle of the day, he knew that much at least, and Cass had left early that morning. He spent the first part of the day staring blankly a the spot where the portal had disappeared, half thinking that it was going to spring back into existence and offer him a way out, too. But it didn’t, and eventually Dean had realized that there was no longer a reason to stay out in the open like that. He’d packed up what he had left and started walking, but it occurred to him that navigation was going to be a lot more difficult now without Cass or his star chart.
“Where do you work?” Cass dropped his hand and sat down on the bed, but kept his eyes on Dean like he actually gave a shit about the answer.
or any other book you’ll find here at Hogwarts.” He held up a single finger and added, “yet.” He waited once more as everyone put their things away, and then asked for a volunteer. When no one raised their hand or made any indication whatsoever that they’d be willing to volunteer for anything the Professor had in mind, he called on Lisa. Suddenly, her bravado disappeared, and she honestly looked scared. She rose slowly from her seat, her knee knocking against the desk. She didn’t seem to notice if it pained her at all, because she straightened her back and walked down to Professor Crane. Castiel almost admired her for that. He could see the moment that she buried her fear and did what needed to be done.
The lesson seemed to take forever, and he packed up his bags quickly in an effort to get out of there.
Nothing else he could think of even came close to that singular memory, unless he was counting what happened with Castiel on Christmas. But even that memory was tainted and tinged with guilt and regret.
“Fuck, fuck - is this really fucking happening right now?” Dean’s words were awed, and Cass’s responding nod only drove Dean deeper into his throat. “Shit- uhh, Cass, jesus that’s -”
Professor Crane walked to the door and must have used a non-verbal spell, because Castiel heard the lock click open, but the man didn’t utter a word. Castiel made a mental note to do some more research on non-verbal spells. He knew a handful of them, but none that seemed abundantly useful.
His eyes shot to the end of her wand as a silvery-white peacock burst forth. His eyes were wide, and he was sure he’d never seen anything like it. Peacocks were ridiculous creatures, all arrogance and uselessness, but this was… beautiful. He could feel the warmth and hope radiating out from it, and several students around him gasped. He understood immediately how something like this might counteract the effects of a dementor.
“I promise, okay? I do, I promise.” Dean took Cass’s hand, pulling his arms uncrossed. They walked for a little bit in silence until they found yet another cave. One glance inside told Dean it was uninhabited, which was good. They set up and started a fire, then Dean sat down next to Cass in front of it. “Okay, I’ll tell you, but
“This is the great Dean Winchester?” The demon barked a laugh, spitting on Dean. “I’m disappointed, I expected you to be…”
that lasted nearly thirty minutes. Page’s guitar and Plant’s voice screamed and whined in perfect harmony, and suddenly a full half an hour didn’t seem like long enough, even to Cas’ ears.
He boarded quickly and moved to the back, assuming they were all going the same place that he was. He chewed on his lip and tried to make himself invisible without looking like he wasn’t supposed to be there - which was turning out to be harder than he thought.
Cass looked down to see that Dean’s foot was propped between his ass and the floor, and he was bouncing on it as a way to use the heel of his boot to push the plug he was wearing in deeper. His eyes snapped forward to see Dean looked blissed out already, lost in euphoria as his lace-trapped cock leaked and twitched.
Thursday will be the conclusion, BUT I'm still tossing around the idea of continuing it, let me know!
‘Dean’ closed his eyes and swallowed hard. “Listen, Sam, I’m so sorry. Dean he- he broke me out of Purgatory and we have a plan and I’m going to go back for him, I promise. But I have to- I need your help. All of your guys help.”
Dean let out a small breath. “Okay, I’ve been gathering the ingredients for polyjuice potion and the horn of bicorn was the last one I needed. I’ve been tracking that fucking thing for months. The day we find the portal, you’re gonna take some of the potion so you look like me when you cross over. You didn’t get sponsored by a pureblood family, but I did. If you go through as you, you’ll get taken straight to Voldemort and that ain’t gonna help anyone. If you go through as
“Seriously, Dean. Quit worrying. You’re not going to get chosen, and neither am I. We’re going to have a great year and you’re going to pass all your exams and then I’m kidnapping both you and Sam over the summer.” She nodded her head once, matter-of-factly.
His voice echoed around the room and a shroud of silver mist erupted from his wand. Professor Trinket clapped politely. “That won’t do you much good if you’re faced with an actual dementor, but it’s a start.”
Dumbass was still sucking in air like he’d spent the last several minutes nearly drowning. Dean just quirked an amused eyebrow at him until irritation seemed to overtake whatever panic he was feeling, and Dumbass leveled a grade-A glare at him.
Dean slid out from underneath him slowly, laying him down on the seat. He rummaged around in the compartment above the seats, pulling out his suitcase. He changed into his robes quickly, making as little noise as possible. When he was done, he stowed the trunk again and leaned over to kiss Cass.
Dean only groaned louder. Sam leaned forward, looking around Sirius to Finnick. “Hey, man. How was your summer?”
Castiel paused for a beat, but then pressed his lips to Dean’s again, whispering “fuck it” before their lips touched.
By the time Castiel made it back to earth, his wings were once more black as night and two years had passed on Earth. He was the catalyst that caused the war that killed thousands of his brothers and sisters, and for that, he was punished. Little did Heaven know that Castiel saw his blackened wings as the greatest gift of all.
Cass shook his head and smiled slightly. “You gave me precise directions to the portal, you’ve done more than I could’ve ever imagined. I’m annoyed with how long it took me to figure it out.”
He was wrong about his Christmas present, however, as none came. He wasn’t entirely upset about this fact, but it now meant that the last family tradition they had was over. They were now just four people living in a house together, and his heart broke all over again for Sam. The summer seemed to drag on because of this, but September 1st eventually came, and Sam and Dean made their way back to Platform 9 ¾.
Lisa cleared her throat and smiled. “Congratulations to the both of you. That’s really exciting news.”
“Good morning, Castiel,” Aunt Naomi smiled small, looking toward Castiel. “Are you excited to go back to Hogwarts?” Castiel nodded and grabbed a piece of toast off of the plate, hopping up onto the counter. “You have no idea.”
Cas rolled his eyes with a huge smile and was grateful for his nearly indestructible body, he was sure Dean’s grip on a human’s hand would have completely shattered it as Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and John Bonham took the stage.
He looked towards the trapdoor that separated his room from the rest of the house as he heard Aunt Naomi. He cleared his throat and looked at himself in the mirror once more.
“Doesn’t matter now, right? Can’t change the past.” Dean rubbed his face with both hands and then laid back, turning on his side to face Cass. “I guess I should just be grateful we don’t have to hide this shit anymore, right? I know how you feel, you know how I feel. Hell, maybe we’ll finally be able to squeak a little bit of happiness outta this fucked up world.”
Castiel nodded and hesitantly hugged her back. “I did, but Mrs. Black I- I need-” he pulled back from her and handed her the star chart from inside his jacket. “I need you to read this and not freak out, okay? I need your help.”
get to spend more time with Dean, just the two of them. He quickly made it into Professor Trinket’s office and noticed that Dean was already in there.
Flickerman nodded solemnly. “It is, Osiris. Finnick Odair and some of the other tributes that escaped from the Mudblood Games kidnapped and tortured Professor Seneca Crane, and likely would have killed him had I not intervened.”
Castiel watched him leave, feeling deep in his gut that something wasn’t right. He’d succeeded, but at what cost? He walked through heaven, speaking to the angels that would even look at him. He was in the middle of a conversation with Hannah, trying to explain what happened when the alarms began to sound from the Axis Mundi.
James raised a hand to his ear, “what? Sorry, didn’t hear you… I don’t speak Troll.” Sirius tackled James and the two began wrestling in the grass. Dean chuckled and hung back to watch. They did this a lot, and Dean wasn’t necessarily worried, but the two did have the tendency to take things too far. He had lost count a long time ago of how many times the three of them had made trips to the Hospital Wing because of these little wrestling matches.
He fixed his hair in the rear-view mirror and reminded himself that he was here for Sammy, and he would
Before the words could even sink in, Cass was flicking his tongue under the head of Dean’s cock. He let out a little yelp, for all the sex he had, he rarely got his dick sucked. Mostly everyone preferred that
Every year since Voldemort gained power, 5th, 6th, and 7th year students were chosen from each of the four Hogwarts Houses - Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. One kid from each year in each house, for a total of 12. They were always…
I mean hide good, from everyone but Cinna, Shurley, and Team Free Will. Get as many of ‘em on your side as you can. When you get out of the portal, pay attention to where you land - you’re gonna need to find your way back to it in order to get the rest of us out. I doubt they’ll try to hide the location from you, cuz why the fuck would anyone ever come back here? So pay attention and then work with the others to find a way to keep it open. You still with me?” Dean finally took a breath, looking at Cass with a worried expression.
He sat up slowly and rubbed the lingering sleep from his eyes. The sun was pouring unwelcome light into the room, and the clock on the wall alerted him that he had twenty minutes to vacate before typical checkout time when someone would be coming to clean the room. He dressed in a daze and made a quick sweep to make sure he didn’t forget anything - he’d already lost his jacket to this endeavor, he didn’t want to lose anything else. He paused near the bedside table when he noticed a note tucked under the alarm. It was a phone number, followed by the worst words Dean could have ever said to him.
“Somewhere in New Zealand. I wasn’t focused on our destination when we left, I was simply trying to get you as far away from those demons as possible.”
It only took Dean a few days to get back into the swing of things at Hogwarts. Overall, not much had changed from his previous years; he was still horrible at Potions and History of Magic, and excelled in Defense Against the Dark Arts --
‘Dean’ simply frowned, looking down. “That’s terrible, poor Finn.” He took a moment to breathe and then looked up again. “Sam, listen to me. I promise you I’m not Dean. This isn’t some sick joke. Have you ever heard of Polyjuice potions and shapeshifters?”
“Yes, and how well did that work out for you last time?” Snape smiled cruelly as they approached the door. “He wasn’t expecting any…
The room echoed with gasps and ‘who won?’, but Professor Crane raised his hand to silence the room again. “The Chosen fought valiantly and-,” Professor Shurley stopped when a voice was heard from the Gryffindor table.
Castiel, for the first time this summer, fell asleep quickly. He was safe, he was happy, and he was going back to Hogwarts, which had quickly become one of his favourite places.
Prim raised her eyebrows. “Dean, it’s been like a year and a half for you. I’ve been here for… I’m working on month three I think, which is probably more like six out there, so…”
The eye roll Cass threw in his direction could have won a fucking Oscar. “We should start with Transfiguration.”
Once the coffee was poured and the Bumble app was successfully downloaded, he sat down to read over the latest essay he’d assigned.
Dean let out a desperate plea and Cass pulled his fingers out. He heard the sound of the lube bottle again and then he
The paper found its way to his pocket anyway, but his eyes fixated on the trash can. It was… full. Curiosity getting the better of him, he pulled out one of the crumpled pages and smoothed it out over the bed.
The man turned, and Dean’s initial reaction was that Bobby’s description of his eyes was entirely too mild. The man smiled lightly.
His dad gave him the same look he used to right before things would get bad at home. He straightened up in his seat and leveled a glare right at him, daring him to do something in front of an entire classroom of witnesses.
He stayed at the Black Lake as long as he dared. He came here a lot to be alone, drawing some small level of comfort from the water that barely rippled in the wind. The Black Lake was home to several sea creatures, including a giant squid, and yet… there was rarely a disturbance on the surface. Sam took strength and guidance from that as he stood up and brushed the dirt off of his pants.
Castiel sniffled and closed his eyes again. “I do have faith in you, Dean. I trust you I just-” he shook his head and opened his eyes again. “I don’t trust myself.”
See you next Sunday! And I promise, there is a very Destiel point to all of this - it's just something of a slow, agonizing burn. :)
I'll have you know that I wrote this entire fic based solely upon this specific idea for the "reveal." I hope it was worth it! See you all Tuesday for the entirely cheesy finale. I love all of you for sticking with this. :)
Cass looked exasperated, and Dean laughed from somewhere deep in his gut. “Relax, Cass. I know we said we’d wait. You aren’t gettin’ your hands on
The nod he received in response was slow at first and then more insistent, like the guy finally made up his mind that Dean was worth dancing with. Dean’s ego kicked in a little, here he was enraptured by this blue-eyed beautiful stranger dressed in pink and the guy barely seemed to register him. Okay, so he was gonna have to work a
you, Dean. That sounds a little more than ‘just mad’ to me.” He paused and then flicked his eyes to Dean. “This is what you were talking about on Christmas, isn’t it?”
“He was everyone’s friend,” Charlie whispered as the golden plates appeared on the table, accompanied by butterbeer.
He cringed internally as he climbed the final few steps and rounded the corner. There was already a crowd of students outside of the door, but Castiel couldn’t tell why none of them were going in. He pushed his way to the front and checked the door, which was locked.
Castiel kissed him back, seemingly not bothered by anything right now, his hands were resting on Dean’s sides, his thumbs stroking over the clothed skin there, which made Dean shiver.
Castiel was terrified but he knew that wasn’t the answer Dean would give. He cleared his throat and shook his head. “Nah, I’ve been through this before.”
“Maybe not, but it’s the best I’ve got right now with the options in front of me. It’s the option that
Sirius looked back and forth between Dean and Castiel with raised eyebrows. “Set aside your differences, eh? There’s a spell strong enough to lift all of them?” Dean stuck his leg out and kicked Sirius, muttering how extremely
Cinna chuckled. “I’m sorry I couldn’t make it more clear, but we were under strict instructions not to give you
It was barely above a whisper, and Castiel might not have even heard him say it if it wasn’t for the absolute quiet of the rest of the class. Nothing happened. Not a cloud, not a wisp, not even a hiccough out of Dean’s wand.
hard to keep his eyes on Cass’s face. It wasn’t overly difficult if he was being honest, his hair was wet and clinging to his cheeks, and the five-o’clock shadow only served to further pronounce his eyes. “Yeah, well… that’s why he disbanded Taste. Became all about the money and the stadium shows, and Gallagher just wanted to play small clubs and venues and write his own shit without bein’ told what sells.”
Castiel was beyond grateful for Mrs. Black’s help, but really all he needed was a ride to Hogwarts. He just needed to get to Hogwarts. “I don’t have much of a choice, Mrs. Black. I’m so sorry I’m putting you in danger but… but if I can pull this off, I’ll be able to rescue Dean and so many other people. There’s still so many people alive in Purgatory, they’ve been alive this entire time with no escape. Bobby Singer? He’s alive.”
“Fucking bullshit, how the fuck do you admit to killing someone and still get off?” Cato’s words were harsh and perfectly echoed the anger that Sam was now barely able to contain. They released him when they were safely back on the street and making their way towards Professor Cinna and the PortKey he held to take them back to the school.
“Always,” Sam nodded back, leaning against the counter. “Are you? Uncle Bobby workin’ you too hard?”
call you to fight for me, Dean. And you will obey me, or it will be you that watches everything you stand for burn to ashes in front of you.” He closed the distance between them and gripped Castiel’s forearm, turning it so his palm was facing up. “And for your defiance leading up to the Games, and your… attitude this morning, I will make sure to send your mother and father a
The sound coming from Cass could only be described as a giggle. “Could you imagine Syd Barrett and Roger Waters in a western?”
The longer it took, the more frenzied Cass became. He screamed Dean’s name over the noise of what had quickly become a battle, but it was as lost to the wind as Dean himself was. He saw several of his brethren in the fray, it would seem his call for aid over angel radio was not ignored. He was surprised to see Hannah when a blast of holy light abruptly cleared the space in front of him.
Flickerman narrowed his eyes. “Someone will need to alert the Black family that their sponsored tribute has emerged victorious at last. You can go when one of them comes to fetch you. Until then, make yourself at home.”
Cass watched Dean, a thousand memories of blood and tears and war flashing through his mind. “To hell with the consequences, Dean. It’s time I do what I should have done from the very beginning.”
“I’m glad you brought zombies into this. Can you share with the class three differences between zombies and Inferi? You know, since you were paying attention.”
He met Sirius and Alyssa in the Entrance Hall, and together they walked into the Great Hall and sat down as close to the Goblet as they could get. He’d also given a duplicate copy of the letter to Sirius, who was seated on the opposite side of the table as him so no matter which side the Gryffindor tributes came up on, they would be able to slip one of them a copy of it.
“Nah, it’s fine. My mom wasn’t around a whole lot growin’ up and my dad… guess you could say he wasn’t
“Yeah, thanks for your business. Stop by again sometime?” Dean ducked out of the room and he heard the bell of the front door chime as he must have unlocked it again. Cass stood there dumbfounded and at a loss for several seconds before following him out.
Cas stepped back when he finished singing, just far enough to reach into his pocket and pull out a ring. There wasn’t room in the throng around them to kneel, but he was shorter than Dean so he simply looked up at him as the sound of Jones’ Hammond organ filled the space around them. “I love you, Dean Winchester. The broken parts, too. My existence was meaningless before you… and it would be meaningless again if you left. Stay with me. Marry me.”
He closed his eyes and didn’t really answer Dean’s question, changing the topic instead. “You’re the only one I’ve downright told, Hael sort of assumed and that’s why we did the whole ‘fake sex’ thing, and I think Rue found out on her own. So, uh-” he cleared his throat and used his other hand to wipe his eyes before he looked up. “Now you - you know.”
Castiel frowned but didn’t acknowledge the grunt. “So, uh… yes, alright, not talking. Understood.” He opened his notebook just as Professor Trinket walked in.
Emotions flashed across Castiel’s face faster than Dean could decipher them. “Dean, no one is forcing me to do anything. The comment I made about your dad kicking my ass was a joke, he didn’t threaten me. I didn’t feel obligated.”
How none of them realized that Crane had cast an Unforgivable Curse on him was beyond him, but he did his best to shrug off the scoffs and whispered insults.
Lisa shrugged and walked over to the fridge, opening it. Her eyes scanned the contents for a moment before she closed it again and sat down at the table, grabbing Dean’s plate. “I see them every Thursday, that’s more than enough.”
He let the roar of the crowd fill him up as he circled the pitch, cheering along with everyone else when Jo passed the Quaffle to Lisa, who threw it past Castiel and through the hoop. He flew closer to Cass and winked at him. “Gonna have to be quicker than that, angel.” He startled himself with the nickname that could only have come from Cass’s patronus. Dean wasn’t even completely sure what it was, but his first reaction to it had been that it looked like a guardian angel.
He brushed his thumb across the screen to unlock it and clicked the notification. His message center opened up, and sure enough, three unread messages awaited him. He opened the first one.
For all intents and purposes, he should be happy Lisa was at his apartment waiting for him. She was his girlfriend, for fuck’s sake. What kinda guy ain’t happy that his girlfriend’s around?
The skin on his back felt like it was a thousand degrees, and he was now convinced he was going to throw up. “I gotta pee, good to see you Rue, hope you had a good summer.” He took off, moving as fast as he could towards the restrooms.
students, ones that Voldemort deemed unworthy. Voldemort hated anyone and anything that wasn’t a pureblood wizard. That included half-bloods, muggle-borns, and just about any creature that wasn’t a giant. Even Voldemort knew the tactical advantages behind having a giant on his side. The rest were disposable, and seen as less than human. There was a problem, though, as there so often is when bigotry is involved. And that problem was population. The purebloods were dwindling in numbers, and Voldemort created a solution: the Mudblood Hunger Games. He’d r0und up a mix of students and magical creatures from Hogwarts and give them a chance to prove that they belonged in his new world order. Names would be drawn from The Goblet of Fire, and unless someone volunteered to take your place, you were transported with the rest of the chosen few to Purgatory. Not much is known about what happens in Purgatory, but only one tribute ever makes it out alive. The rest either die in Purgatory, remain trapped, or… by some outlandish theories, are fed to Voldemort’s snake Nagini if they aren’t the first one to find the portal out of there. Dean shuddered at the thought of being fed to a giant snake, which causes Lisa to sit up and squeeze his hand.
“We’re good, Dean, thanks for asking. How are you?” Lisa grinned and walked up behind him, kissing his cheek. “Roast, potatoes and corn. It’ll be ready soon.”
It was time for Castiel’s first Dark Arts lesson of the year. He glanced at his course schedule and rolled his eyes when he saw he’d be with the Gryffindors this year. He didn’t know many of them, but the ones he did know, he didn’t care for. The whole lot of them were loud and boisterous, and some of them - Dean Winchester’s name might have crossed his mind - were downright rude.
He stepped inside of The Family Business record store and sought Dean out. He was sitting behind the counter, leaning back precariously as a barstool balanced on two legs. He had one of his own legs bent, his foot braced on the counter as he rocked the barstool back and forth, his back against the wall. He looked almost obscenely delicious with his legs spread like that, open and inviting. He realized that’s probably exactly what Dean was doing - inviting anyone and everyone in for a ride. His heart broke a little to think of all the things that Dean went through that led him here. He approached the counter and cleared his throat.
Dean let it happen. “No- well, yeah, but no. It was just once, a few summers ago. Some friends and I were playin’ that game, spin-the-bottle? Anyway, it was barely even a kiss, but the kid’s parents told my dad, and…” Dean fell silent for a moment, chewing his lip. “I didn’t even look at another dude after that, until you, last year.”
“Yes, Dean, six seconds that might have gotten us both killed. It was safer to bring you somewhere else, and now that you’re safe, I refuse to take you back.” Cass paused for a moment as reports over angel radio started to trickle in. Dean said something, but it was background noise. “They did it, it’s over. The demons are gone and Bartholomew is currently searching for the reason behind it. It’s over, Dean.”
Dean frowned for a moment, then pulled Cass to his side and put an arm around him. “I’m gonna figure it out, okay? Either way, I don’t care if you’re fine with it or not, cuz I’m not fine with it. It shouldn’t have to be like this and I know that. I’ll figure it out, you just gotta give me some time.”
Castiel spent the next twenty years hunting and killing all of the monsters the Winchesters would have taken out had their lives not been dramatically altered. Every day was harder than the last, and he checked up on Dean as often as he could. More than once Cass sought comfort in places… people… he shouldn’t as he waited for a good time to reintroduce himself, hoping against hope that it wouldn’t be long.
He obviously wasn’t going to go back inside or take the damn thing out in the middle of the parking lot, so he rode home with it pressing into him uncomfortably. It did nothing for his mood except ensure that it tanked fucking
Dean had this awful tendency to dig himself deeper no matter how badly he wanted to pull himself up, so he muttered under his breath, “yeah, keep runnin’ away.”
Castiel felt his stomach rumble and he knew he was starving, but he needed to get to Dean as fast as he could. “Could I take it to go? I’ve got to get back to Hogwarts.”
Sirius, to his credit, had been sticking to Sam like glue since this began a year and a half ago. Sam wasn’t sure if it was because he was worried about Sam, sad himself, or a mixture of both. No matter which one it was, Sam was grateful. He was grateful to have someone that cared about Dean nearly as much as he did, that understood exactly what Sam lost the day Dean volunteered for him.
She smiled small. “And that bastard Voldemort thought muggleborns weren’t clever. The jokes on him, I suppose, and it’s about damn time. Give me five minutes to whip you up something decent to eat. There’s a bathroom just up the stairs and to the left if you wish to shower. I also suggest changing into some of Sirius’s old school robes - they’re in his bedroom which is two doors down from the bathroom. That might allow you easier access to the Gryffindor common room. Dean seems pretty adamant that you find his brother, Sam.”
“Whatcha got there, angel?” Dean’s curious expression was enticing enough that Cas actually pulled it back out.
“Yes, part of my mission was to ensure you and Sam stayed alive long enough to avert the apocalypse. Or, I suppose now that I know the truth… it was to keep you alive long enough to begin it. So it is written, so it shall be.”
got what he wanted. As his hole expanded to let Cass’ considerable width in, Dean was grateful Cass took the time to prep him so fucking thoroughly.
Dean brushed his lips over the top of Cass’ head. “These seats are wide, why don’t you lay down and take a nap? I’ll wake you up when it’s time to get changed.”
to leave you alone, and you wouldn’t friggen go. So, I pushed. I was tryin’ to do you a god damned favour.”
Castiel hummed and fell silent, and Dean laid awake until he heard Cass’s breathing finally even out. He was still half-hard and completely unsure of his decision to leave things as they were, but he knew he’d feel like shit if he cheated on anyone — even Lisa. It just wasn’t how he was built.
Lisa moved over to sit next to Dean, taking one of his hands in her own and leaning into his shoulder. “It’s going to be fine, Dean. Hogwarts is a big place, and they’re only going to take one kid from our house and year. I’m sure you’ll be fine, even if your name does get picked… I’d bet my whole stock of Chocolate Frogs that Gordon Walker takes your place. He actually
the shit outta my Gryffindor shirt, which I’ll make sure to have on every waking fucking second that you’re gone. We can find Bobby and the others together and get everybody the fuck outta this place. The others -- I’m talkin’ Team Free Will here, not Bobby and them - are gonna need to figure out a place to hide everyone until we can figure out what to do with all of ‘em. But that’s it, that’s the plan. And it ends with me and you both free, you got that? Both of us. And I swear to god, angel, if you pull this off… I’ll ask you to marry me right in front of my dad.”
“Yeah, uh… I guess they did. Sammy’s pretty great.” He smiled at the floor, the whiskey temporarily forgotten.
Dean nearly took the stairs, but he had an armful of wine and whiskey bottles and there were about 8 flights he’d need to climb in order to reach Sammy’s floor.
Dean really was crying then, the tears budding in the corners of his eyes and Cas quickly leaned up to kiss them away. He knew Dean was mourning his parents with every note, but maybe this was needed. Music healed, in ways that even angels couldn’t.
He frowned but understood, nodding once. “Yes, alright, Dean. I’m going to the Hufflepuff common room, you can uh- you can join me if you’d like.”
As he made his way towards Platform 9 ¾, the familiar feeling of butterflies filled his stomach as they often did on September 1st.
He showered quickly, taking care to scrub as many oil stains from his skin as he could. Most of them were permanent by this point, so his brother’s hot-shot lawyer friends would just have to suck it up and deal.
After the kiss Castiel eyed Dean, his voice cracking as he spoke again. “I love you, Dean. Never forget that, okay?”
Cass crouched across the street from Dean’s childhood home. His nose was bleeding and pain richoched through his body from time traveling, but he got to his feet and fixed his eyes upon Sam’s nursery window. He took a deep breath, steadying himself as he pulled the Colt from his trench coat. The extra energy it took to time travel to get it weakened him, but if he succeeded, this would be the last time that gun ever needed to be fired.
She studied him for a moment. “You must be naturally gifted at Occlumency, and thank goodness for that. We won’t be able to Apparate to the school, I have a feeling they’ll be watching you closely. I already put Sirius’s broom in the car, we’ll need to drive there. They won’t be able to trace any non-magical forms of transportation. Once we’re close, I’ll let you out and you can fly to the Astronomy Tower. I updated Professor Cinna, he’ll be waiting for you after the official announcement is made that Dean won. Are you ready?”
Cass bit his lip, wondering if he should let the conversation stall there. In the end, he decided that conversation with Impala was harmless. He wasn’t asking for photos or saying anything inappropriate. He was easy to talk to, and had managed to get him to laugh for the first time in weeks. Maybe they could be friends, or as close to it as you can get without even knowing someone’s real name.
“We can, and we did. Sit down. I’m not taking you back, you have no car, and no other way to get there.”
harder for this one, and normally he’d just walk away - but something about the quiet demeanor and heavenly fucking curves of that guys ass had him realizing there wouldn’t be any walking away from this unless he actually told Dean to fuck off.
Sirius shrugged. “I spent almost all summer with him, Remus and Peter. I needed to talk to someone with a slightly higher IQ for a change.” He paused for just a moment and Dean grinned, but that grin quickly disappeared as Sirius finished his thought. “Shame you lot were the only ones around.” Dean kicked him again.
It was easy to tell that Castiel had definitely heard by how aggressively he put his quill down, but he didn’t move or say anything.
He huffed, but opened the book anyway. It had words this time, which he supposed was a step in the right direction. Or, word, he should say, because written on every page, over and over again, was the word
The one where progress is won and lost and won again... or... lost and won and lost again, however you want to look at it. The baby steps are taken.
“I swore to you I wouldn’t, and so I don’t unless it’s absolutely necessary. Finding out if you were in love with me or not never really seemed to fit the bill.”
that wasn’t fair to you. I do, I know that. I need you to know that I know that.” Dean kept walking, not letting go of Castiel’s hand. He was aware, very aware, that they were walking down the middle of a corridor and that they could be spotted by anyone at any time, and the thought made him nervous. It made him want to pull away, but he didn’t.
“Do you remember that time Dean and Cass nearly blew up the Potions classroom two years ago cuz they couldn’t quit bickering over who was going to add ingredients and who was going to stir? That was one
“Ahh yes, here we are. I’ll send word to Sirius at once that you’ve made it out, unless you prefer he hears it at the school update?” Walburga looked at Castiel briefly before opening the door and gesturing for him to go inside.
Dean shifted in his seat, looking around at all of the other faces in the room. Most seemed to echo exactly how he felt - even if he couldn’t even explain how he felt at the moment. His eyes fell on Castiel, like he was some sort of magnet for Dean’s gaze. At this point, he wasn’t even trying to hide it, he knew that Castiel was hurting over Garth’s death. He’d never really mentioned it to Castiel, but him and Garth had sort of been friends too. Not close, by any means, but they frequently shared compartments together on the Hogwarts Express, and he’d had Herbology with him his third year. Garth was a good kid, werewolf or not. He didn’t deserve this anymore than any of them did, but it was becoming increasingly clear to Dean that no one else gave a shit about that. He barely paid attention to the rest of the announcement, and he allowed himself to be led out with all the others.
In all of the times that Castiel had ever imagined this conversation playing out, he hadn’t anticipated that question. “Dean… you have to understand how different things were back then. I was a soldier that knew almost nothing but Heaven’s orders. I was given an order and I obeyed, up until I chose you and my wings turned black.”
Dean shook his head, a bewildered expression on his face. “No, don’t - don’t be sorry. I uhh… just kinda wish I’d have gotten here sooner.”
Not a single person cheered. Not a single person made a sound, honestly. The room was just full of eyes blinking at Professor Shurley. He cleared his throat. “Uh, that is all. Enjoy your end of the Games feast,” he paused, lowering his voice, “and may the odds be ever in your favour.”
Dean knew he’d pushed him far enough tonight, so he quickly grabbed the blankets from their bag, enlarged them and laid them out. He pulled Cass to him and laid them both down, pulling one of the blankets over top of them and holding Cass tight to his chest. “I love you, okay? No matter what happens, that’s not gonna stop.”
“I ain’t my brother, Lis. And him and Jess have been together since they were in like the 2nd grade, you and I have been together, what… six months? Not even? We don’t even officially live together yet.” Dean closed his eyes. “I get where you’re comin’ from, alright? We’ll talk about it tomorrow.” Or not.
to go? Because while you can’t stop thinking about my eyes, all I can feel when I lay in bed at night is your hands. On my back, on my chest, just - just
Cas couldn’t help but smile as he pulled Dean into his arms and kissed him gently, savoring the way Dean’s lips felt against his. “I think I can handle that.” He wanted this to be special, not just a normal ‘dinner and a movie’. He had big plans for this date.
“I know Metallica, Dean. Your humming skills are sub-par at best, and I was having trouble discerning whether you were trying to hum ‘Wherever I May Roam’ or ‘Nothing Else Matters.’”
out of here, as soon as we find that damn portal. It’s only gonna take one of us -- don’t worry, I’m gonna
Castiel looked at her, but for some reason couldn’t bring himself to smile. He shifted his eyes to Dean, scanning his face for any indication on what just happened and what it was that appeared out of his wand.
Pink gave him a look at the nickname. It wasn’t the usual response he got, but it also wasn’t unfavorable. He didn’t answer, he simply downed the rest of his drink and waved a flippant hand toward the bartender to get a refill.
He heard Dean’s words, feeling his stomach sink. He hadn’t meant to explode on Dean like that, he just-
He continued to practice, getting the spell right more often that not. He had a stack of 15 perfect replicas of
He tasted exactly the way Castiel thought he would. Smokey, like a summer barbecue - not an ashtray. Hints of cinnamon the way one would pepper the spice over a freshly baked apple pie. The bitter tang of whiskey masked the true depths of the other, more preferable flavors, but Castiel didn’t care. He’d have him sober soon enough.
“There’s another problem, too, if I’m bein’ honest. Wait, wait… d’you want me to be honest or do you want me to say the shit that’s gonna make this easier?”
He was several paces behind Dean, and so engulfed in his own thoughts that he didn’t hear the monster sneak up behind him. He might not have noticed it at all, if it wasn’t for the razor sharp claws that raked across his back and brought him to his knees.
fitting.” Cass’s face was so serious that it took Dean several long, awkward seconds to catch onto the joke.
Professor Trinket frowned at him. “So do better. Whatever you were thinking about… it wasn’t happy enough. It wasn’t
He felt Cass stir and he gritted his teeth, knowing if he didn’t put this plan into motion now, he never would. He sat up slowly, trying to lay Cass down without disturbing him. He stood up and walked over to the cauldron that had been brewing the potion and he plucked a few hairs from his head and tossed them in, then poured the contents into Cass’s canteen.
He heard several other noises of disappointment around him, which made him feel a little better. He cleared his throat and tried again.
Dean sat up again, looking down at him with an expression laced with confusion and concern. “What the hell are you talkin’ about, Cass?”
Dean ran in as fast as the bags he was carrying would allow him. He took a moment to unstick his wet shirt from his chest and shake some excess rain from his hair with his free hand. After wiping his shoes on the carpet just inside the door, he headed for the elevator. He stopped short when he saw that Some Dumbass First Name Novak was standing right in front of it with a couple other lawyers Dean knew by face but not by name.
Cass sat, and the two sat in silence until Dean cleared his thoughts enough to continue. “Bobby’s one of my dad’s friends. He’s basically an uncle to us… hell, at this point, he might as well be our damn father. He’s my boss at the garage I work at, and if it wasn’t for him, I don’t know where we’d be now.”
It got to the point where Dean dumped half his remaining belongings just to lighten the load, and had taken to keeping the shield up around him at all times. Every single thought in his head was focused on Cass and where he was now.
Lisa was bragging to Jo and Johanna about the time she spent dating Dean, and it was Sam’s turn to roll his eyes. He couldn’t help but grin as she recounted the story like they had been star-crossed lovers, when Sam knew that they had merely been kids having a good time. Cass had been the one Dean actually loved, but he didn’t have it in him to correct her.
She eyed the canteen and then huffed. “Right, well… you know Sirius was only Chosen in the first place because we’re considered “blood traitors,” yes? There was a reason for that. My husband and I spoke out against these Games on more than one occasion. It isn’t right. We’re one of the oldest pureblood families still around, though, so that bought us a little more leeway than some of the others. We were permitted to keep our sponsor abilities, but they tried to steal our son in retaliation. I will assist you in whatever way I can, you need only ask. Are you hungry?”
Cinna looked suddenly devastated. “I think you’d better just get to the Room of Requirement. I think you, Sam and the others have a lot to discuss.”
Cass pulled Dean up until their bodies were flush and fucked him deep; his left hand splayed over Dean’s chest and his right hand jerked Dean’s cock almost violently until he was spilling all over the desk. Cass fucked him through it until the aftershocks faded and Dean went limp in Cass’s arms, but that didn’t last long. Something in his brain told him Cass hadn’t cum, and that wasn’t a thing Dean was okay with. He pushed backward until he could pull himself off of Cass and spun, dropping to his knees and pulling the condom off of Cass. He looked up to see the man looking just as fucked out as Dean felt, so taking him in his mouth felt as easy and natural as breathing. Cass’s hands gripped Dean’s hair near his scalp but let him choose the pace. His legs were shaking under Dean’s hands and that spurred Dean on, he sucked him off sloppily until Castiel cried out and came in his mouth.
He didn’t know if he actually said it out loud or if the words died before they could pass his lips, but he focused every bit of waning energy that he had on trying to say them. “I love you, Dean. I love you. I love…” Cass’s body went limp as everything went black.
Angels in full battle armor began appearing around him and Cass quickly followed suit. It didn’t take long to work out the fact that Hell was attacking - for the first time in his own memory, demons were trying to break down the gates of Heaven.
Dean kinda thought getting fucked ‘properly’ meant cutting out the bullshit foreplay and just doing the damn thing, but the words died on his tongue as Cass swept him into a kiss and pressed their mostly naked bodies together.
Somewhere a little ways down the train, someone whispered, “Hey, is that Novak and Winchester?” Dean tensed, his whole body locking up, but he didn’t break the kiss.
“Yeah, right after Wood gives his speech. We might be eighty by the time we get out there to actually play.”
he got to his feet, screaming and cheering and shouting and crying. Every single other student at Hogwarts, even the Slytherins, were on their feet as well, adding to his elation.
He took a sip, hissing slightly at the heat that burnt his tongue. It was a welcome distraction, so he took another one. Cass was matching his movements but not really looking at him. After about a minute, he pulled a piece of parchment from the top of a stack and started reading over it, making little marks every couple of inches.
Castiel looked to Professor Trinket, sensing Dean’s discomfort. “All due respect, Professor Trinket, but Dean doesn’t want to. Perhaps you can pick someone else.”
Lisa smiled politely, wiping her mouth with a napkin. “Well, thank you both for hosting tonight. This week has been so busy, I didn’t know if I would’ve been able to pull my shit together in time for dinner tonight.”
He graduated high school by the skin of his teeth, but it wasn’t for a lack of brain cells. He just… didn’t give a shit about homework or studying, and it never really stopped him from passing. After that, he got a job at his Uncle Bobby’s auto shop and now, he’d been working there for about seven years. He stopped after work one day to have dinner with Sam, Sam’s girlfriend Jessica, and his own girlfriend, Lisa.
level of dignity. I’m going to teach you the Patronus Charm, and while I suspect less than half of you will be able to produce a fully-formed Patronus, it will be worth it to me if even one of you can pull it off.” She looked around the classroom and her eyes landed on Castiel. Dean’s followed, and he watched Castiel’s cheeks flush at the attention. Dean frowned to himself, because Castiel wasn’t even close to being the best in this class, so why did
Part Three will be posted in it's entirety on Monday, March 30th. We're officially at the halfway point, and for any of you that managed to make it this far... thank you. Seriously, thank you. - Ketch
Newt shook his head, his eyes somewhere just to Castiel’s left. “Not at all, I’ve been trying to get him to socialize more, this is a big step for him.”
He kissed her back when her lips met his, and he decided to see exactly how bendy she could get with a stomach full of
Curse. Performing this spell on another person was considered an imprisonable offense, surely he couldn’t be serious. Not even Professor Crane, with his strange beard and hollow eyes could be serious about
The air was blissfully warm when Dean walked down to the Quidditch Pitch for his final match of the year. They were playing Hufflepuff, and this would be the first time he’d really seen Castiel since their argument after Charms.
Cass rolled his eyes, no longer concerned with how Dean was going to react - he absolutely saw this coming. “I’m in love with you, you oblivious, suicidal moron. My ‘people skills’ might be ‘rusty’, but I’m fairly certain that’s still how humans show affection.”
When he landed and steadied himself, a grin slowly appeared on his face. Standing not more than two feet away from him was Dean Winchester.
“Would you prefer shorts?” Cas looked him up and down with a raised eyebrow, and Dean cursed under his breath. “To answer your question, the date is July 29, 1973, and we’re in Manhattan.”
Dean stood up, peeking his head out of the doorway and looking back and forth. “Okay, I think we’re finally in the clear. I didn’t think they were ever gonna leave.” He shut the door and turned back to Cass. “Did you tell Newt about us? It’s fine if you did, I actually believe him when he says he won’t tell anyone.”
Sirius shook his head, grabbing Dean’s arm. He went to say something back to him, but it was lost in the deafening roar that surrounded them. The Hufflepuff players were slowly drifting towards the ground in a victory huddle, Castiel and Charlie right in the center.
If you're seeing this chapter first, turn back. Chapters 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 were all posted today. Enjoy!
He huffed, his brow furrowing. “Goodnight? What, no uhh…” he slid his hand down her thigh and kissed her shoulder. “Celebratory ‘my brother’s getting married’ sex?”
He finally decided to go back to the basics, and used the Four-Point spell to guide him north. He thought that if he was able to find their first real camp again, he might be able to navigate back to Base without having to backtrack too many times. He was getting more of a workout now; without someone to help carry their things, most of it just felt like a burden to him. It didn’t help that now that he was on his own, he looked like an easier target so the monsters were attacking more frequently.
Castiel jumped and quickly pulled his robes on, smoothing them out as he turned to Dean, his face flushed. “Oh, uh, sorry. I thought you were going to take longer.”
There was chaos rapidly spreading through the garden as news of Azazel’s premature death spread like wildfire. He heard his own name bouncing around angel radio and panic rose in him, just as Joshua came into view and grabbed his arm.
The door to the Room of Requirement appeared suddenly and Sam immediately shushed everyone, his eyes wide as he stared at the door.
“Sirius, shut the hell up, man, look at them! They’re smiling - they’re freaking smiling, he - Dean won, I think Dean’s okay!”
Cass shook his head quickly, trying to convey that he had no clue how this got so out of hand so quickly. “Have you seen Dean?”
The smile that played across Voldemort’s lips warned Castiel that this wasn’t a choice at all, but he was being tested. “You’re the victor, are you not? You survived when no others did. To the victor goes the spoils, Dean. Tell me what you want.”
Castiel’s eyes widened and he instantly knew something was wrong. He nodded to him and pulled the cloak on, before leaving the Astronomy Tower and making his way down all the stairs to the ground. He noticed a few Death Eaters outside castle as he quickly entered it.
She blinked and for the first time this entire summer, spoke. “I love you, Michael.” He flicked his eyes between hers and stood abruptly.
He didn’t sit. He didn’t move, other than to kiss him back. He was just about at the end of his self-control when Professor Trinket opened the door, stopping dead when she saw them. “Oh - oh my.”
Whatever the demon expected Dean to be, no one will ever know. He teleported behind the demon and drove his angel blade right through his throat. When the light cleared, Cass had reached his breaking point; he no longer cared why the demons were there or how the tide may turn if he left. He bent down, grabbing Dean and teleported them as far away as he could manage.
Dean took a second to look around Cass’s office. It was neat and orderly, not a single quill out of place.
“Pssh, more like not hard enough. I still love doin’ it as much today as I did the day Dad handed me my first wrench. Doesn’t feel like work, y’know? Never has.” He helped Lisa and Jess set the table and dish up the food when it was done, and sat down to eat.
That’s it! Hope you guys enjoyed, the overall response to this has been a little disheartening but I’m grateful to all of you that stuck with it. 🖤
Flickerman clicked his tongue. “Eight months in Purgatory, perhaps. It’s been… oh, lets see… almost exactly sixteen months here. Time moves twice as slow where you came from. I must say… I’m a little surprised you killed Castiel, although… after that little display in the training center, I’m not
From his left, Sirius chuckled quietly and darky. “Good, you son of a bitch. Get used to those chains.” Sam kicked him gently as a reminder that any mis-step, any misbehavior at all on their part might result in Flickerman walking free. As screwed up as it was, Sam was partially glad that Finnick wasn’t here to cause a scene. But then again, if Finnick was here… this trial wouldn’t be necessary at all. Either way, Sam was determined to assist the prosecution in putting Flickerman away for a very long time, because at least then… Finnick would have died for something.
He looked to her briefly, and then back in the direction Dean ran. “Yeah, uh, I’m fine, Rue. Do you know how many people saw?”
Castiel shook his head, watching her. “No- no I don’t think so. Voldemort couldn’t even sense I wasn’t Dean.”
to go.” Dean leaned back, kicking his feet up on the seat where Lisa had been sitting and wrapping his arm around her shoulder. He tried to remember that her name is up for The Choosing this year too, and the gloomier he was about it, the worse it would be for her. He squeezed her gently and chuckled. “Yeah, that crazy son of a bitch has been chompin’ at the bit to get to his 5th year. Guess it’s his time to shine, huh?”
“Dean? Are you alright?” Cass slid his hands up Dean’s back and gently rubbed his skin, and Dean nodded against the wood.
Dean shrunk back in his seat and tried not to imagine what Castiel was going to use as his happiest memory. He took quite some time, but nodded to Professor Trinket once. “I’m ready.”
“Alright, we’re here,” Aunt Naomi spoke and she almost sounded sad. “Be good, Castiel. Enjoy your final year.”
Dean entered the Charms classroom the following Monday still riding the high from Gryffindor’s latest Quidditch win. He’d expected Ravenclaw to put up more of a fight, they’d been difficult to beat in the past. But Finnick was in rare form, even for him, and it took him less than an hour to catch the Snitch. It had been the most therapeutic hour of Dean’s life, if he was honest with himself. Being a Beater allowed him to be in control. Control of himself, and control of little, magical cannonballs that were the physical embodiment of the frenzied chaos he’d been feeling inside of himself for… well, for years. It felt good to direct that at someone else, to literally beat it away from himself and send it careening towards another target. Especially because all that target had to do was shift their broom slightly to avoid it. It was a win/win, and each time his bat had connected with a bludger, he’d relaxed further.
Castiel’s hands were on Dean’s face now and he deepened the kiss, but he eventually pulled back, resting his forehead on Dean’s. He spoke quietly, his eyes still closed. “Dean we- I shouldn’t…”
Dean choked on nothing and doubled over for a moment, but shook it off and stood back up. “Yeah, angel. I’m here, I’m good. Where the hell are we? Looks like the damn 70’s.”
Dean wrapped his hand around Castiel’s yellow and black tie, and pulled him even closer. He bit his lip and pulled it back, releasing it a moment before kissing him again. He backed them up until Castiel hit the desk, and then Dean helped him sit up on it, settling between his legs.
the help if he was actually going to become an Auror. That didn’t mean he wasn’t fifty shades of pissed off about it, though.
Dean answered by using his grip on Castiel’s pants to spin them around and slam him against the elevator wall.
Professor Trinket broke him out of his thoughts. Her voice was unusually soft. “I heard about recent…
Castiel sighed quietly, but chuckled at Dean’s comment. Finnick grinned and winked at Dean. “Only to the moon? Is there anything higher than the moon? Cuz I’m pretty sure that’s where it’d reach.”
He shut the book quickly and tossed it on top of the other failed attempt. He glanced around the room and saw that a couple of people seemed to have gotten it correct already, which made him more determined to do this right.
“There should be an entire ward at St. Mungo’s dedicated to whatever’s wrong with you,” Sirius began.
“Breathe, Dean.” Cass sucked in a breath, and Dean followed on instinct. In, out. It was a deep, ragged thing, exaggerated even more by how controlled and easy Cass’s was. They took another, and another, until Dean’s could pass for something not akin to a panic attack.
Cass hovered over the delete button as indignation and a slight tinge of embarrassment worked their way through his bones. This sort of response had been exactly what he’d feared. He changed his mind at the last second and clicked on the link to impala67’s profile.
Ten minutes? How long was he inside of his own head? Sure enough, there was a bottle of water sitting on the counter in front of him. He hated water, preferred just about anything to drink
Thick ropes wound their way around the bicorn, who struggled and thrashed before falling to the ground, it’s chest rising and falling erratically. Dean raced over to it, muttering “sorry, sorry… I’ll be quick, I’m sorry,” under his breath over and over again. He pulled out his knife and quickly severed one of the bicorn’s horns, and then did the same to the other. “Sorry!” Dean said to the almost convulsing animal, backing away from it slowly.
He was ignored. Dean’s lips kept moving, the muscles in his jaw flexing with determination and irritation. Cass simply sat back and waited until Dean’s chest heaved and he let out a breath of defeat.
Dean abruptly snapped out of his thought as a bludger sped towards Ginny Weasley, who was holding the Quaffle and zig zagging her way towards the goal post. He leaned forward on his broom, urging it faster. “Ginny, duck!” The second she did, he swung - connecting bat to bludger and sending it speeding towards Johanna Mason.
Dean looked genuinely concerned. “Cass, there’s nothin’ wrong with that, okay? I don’t give a shit what my dad says, there’s nothin’ wrong with you just because you’re not into girls. You know that, right?”
Dean Winchester grew up a perfectly normal kid. He played catch with his dad, helped his mom bake pies for their Sunday family dinners, and harassed his little brother Sammy as often as he could. They weren’t crazy rich, but Dean hadn’t really ever wanted for anything. Growing up in Lawrence was about as good as it got, the people were nice, it was safe, and Dean never had to worry about it when he reached his teen years and realized he played for both teams. His dad was a little weirded out when he brought home his first boyfriend, but got over it a lot quicker than he thought he would.
Castiel looked around, his heart pounding in his chest. He really didn’t have time for Voldemort’s bullshit, but this is the way the Games go and Cass knew he’d have to play along for just a little while longer. “Hello?”
“Rue, you have to be quiet, okay?” Castiel nudged her gently, matching her volume. “It’s exactly what you think it’s for.”
The way Cas said his name sent delicious shivers down his spine and had him fully hard in his jeans. He slid his hands around the sides of Cas’ neck and used his thumbs to press under his jaw and tilt his head up as their lips finally met. He tasted every bit as good as Dean had hoped, and a few steps later, he had Cas pinned against the wall and clutching onto Dean’s shirt for support. His tongue pressed for entrance and it was granted, and a surge of satisfied anticipation surged through him.
“Dean,” Castiel pleaded, sitting up. “Ignore him, he’ll go away. He doesn’t have any other joy in his life other than making fun of me. If it helps him sleep at night…” he stood up as well, narrowing his eyes at Raphael, “let him.”
Dean’s emotions were on overload and Cas could feel every single one of them, and he was tempted to calm him down but decided against it. For once, only good things were coming from Dean’s chest. Cas couldn’t pinpoint another moment in their history together where that was the case, except for maybe when Sam and Jess welcomed their first child. So, no. As overwhelming as it felt for Cas, he was going to let Dean experience this fully.
he had to be in order to make Cass sound like that over and over again. He huffed and continued writing, barely paying attention to the words he was scribbling.
The door opened and a very official-looking wizard escorted them into the courtroom. Sam glanced around quickly and was startled to see that the room was set up more like a Quidditch Pitch than a standard courtroom, with the seats extending upwards like in a stadium. He suddenly felt very small, but had a small, victorious moment when he saw Caesar Flickerman in the center of the room bound in chains and flanked by two Aurors. Sam had never seen an Auror up close, but they were basically the Ministry of Magic’s version of a magical army. They were both tough, hard looking men with various body piercings and long, leather robes. Sam had a brief thought that if Dean found his way out of Purgatory, he’d fit right in amongst the Aurors.
That's all, folks. I can't imagine more than a handful of people will actually make it this far, but if you're reading this... just know that we're eternally grateful to you for coming along on this ride with us. This story means the world to us (especially me), and even though I've written over a dozen other stories since we completed this one, I still and probably always will consider it as my crowning achievement.
Castiel’s skin ignited under Voldemort’s touch as he was branded, the skull-and-snake symbol searing into his arm.
His classes were through for the day, but his office hours were not. Students rarely needed him after class, but he’d made it a personal rule when he began teaching that he would remain in his office and accessible during office hours whether anyone came in or not. He was fidgeting with the trinkets and pens on his desk when his phone buzzed. He rolled his eyes when he saw the Bumble logo, and opened the app with the intention on deleting his profile entirely. It brought up the message center immediately, and Cass paused when he saw it was from impala67. He hadn’t heard from him since before his date with Patrick.
me so much? If I recall, you’re the one who’s pushed me away every time I’ve tried to fix our problems. You
“I just didn’t feel like going tonight. I missed you and thought I’d hang out here instead. That’s okay with you, right?”
Dean was crying, but his voice barely wavered as he continued spell after spell, attempt after attempt to stop the bleeding and heal him, but somewhere deep inside of Cass, he knew it was too late.
It was slow and sensual, the kind of kiss you’d expect with someone you love after a night of whiskey and slow dancing,
Dean sucked in a breath when his thickening cock sprang free, and Cass’s head was once more being guided forward. As it turned out, Cass’s well of patience wasn’t nearly as deep as he’d believed, so he ran his tongue along Dean’s shaft and relished the moan it drew. Castiel’s hand wrapped around him and his mouth followed, pulling Dean in with a hunger that had been barely concealed for years.
Castiel was taking shallow breaths with his face still covered, seemingly overwhelmed with all of this but still, he nodded. “Yes.”
Castiel was sick to his stomach, but he kept his face as neutral as possible. He was too smart to think this was anywhere near over. Professor Crane seemed to take Castiel’s air of indifference as a sign that they were of a same mind, which… they definitely were not. He called Castiel to the front to take Lisa’s place as she sat back down in a trembling heap.
“You just started three sentences and didn’t finish a damn one of them. If you’re askin’ if I’m into chicks, the short answer is ‘yeah.’ The long answer is ‘but probably not as much.’” Dean’s eyes met Castiel’s and he sucked in a breath.
Finnick shrugged and kicked his feet up so they were on Dean’s lap, folding his hands behind his head. “Oh, y’know. Didn’t do much. How about you, Sammy? How was yours?”
“I’m not sayin’ you wouldn’t worry about me, Cass. I’m sayin’ that at the end of the day, nobody’s gonna listen to me out there besides the damn kids. We need the professors on our side, here. The second you get the rest of us out of Purgatory, all hell is gonna break loose on Earth. It’s gonna be an all out fucking war, and you know it.” He pushed himself to his feet, turning to face Cass. “I can’t do what needs to be done out there, but I
Castiel watched as Professor Crane ushered Professor Shurley off the stage. Castiel swallowed hard as the room slowly began to come to life with chatter.
“Dean, why don’t you just tell the poor girl you just ain’t that into her?” Something on Benny’s end of the phone barked loudly. “Coda, lay down.”
. His dad hunted creatures like werewolves and vampires, ghosts and ghouls. Definitely not deer. Dean used to think he was a hero, until his 11th birthday when an
Cass’s face flushed and Dean laughed again. It wasn’t mocking, it was relieved. Well, relief and a little bit of embarrassment of his own.
The following moments were filled with tangled tongues and roaming hands, and Cas was content to stay just like that for awhile - it’s not as though they were on any kind of a schedule, time-traveling had a way of alleviating those concerns, but Dean had other plans.
Dean nodded, his lip still caught between his teeth. “Yeah, I’m done tryin’ to pretend like I don’t, but I can’t really ask you to do that. It’s not fair to you to have to hide, especially when you’ve got Helm and his goons constantly giving you shit about not bein’ with anyone.”
The man blinked and took a slow sip of his drink, then licked his bottom lip. Dean’s eyes shamelessly landed on those luscious pink things and his first thought was that the man was wearing lipstick. While it wasn’t exactly a turn-off, dudes wearing makeup wasn’t usually his cup of tea… but on him? Dean thickened a little in his jeans at the thought of those pink lips wrapped around his cock.
He pressed on, knowing this was like a band-aid that needed ripped off quickly. “Okay, so polyjuice potion won’t last forever. You’ll need to keep taking it every hour on the hour until you’re safely at the Black’s house, where you’ll give her a letter I’m gonna write explaining that I’m calling in my chips - I saved hers, now she’s gonna save mine. At that point, you can quit taking the potion and if Mrs. Black knows what’s good for her, she’s gonna get your ass back to Hogwarts. Now, the announcement will be made that I won and you’re dead, so you’re gonna have to
He sat down in his usual seat and pulled out his wand. Professor Trinket had a gleam in her eye that he’d rarely seen before, which excited him. After the Dark Arts lesson from Hell, he had been weary at best about going to his other lessons. He knew what the others called him.
That was six years ago, and Sammy climbed the ladder faster than Dean thought possible. He was about to become the youngest name partner in recent memory in any law firm on the west coast, and he’d paid Dean back in spades.
“Today, half of you will be practicing delivering a curse, while the other half have the curse administered upon you. Don’t worry, I am on hand should anything go awry.” He turned his eyes and his wand on Lisa, and muttered, “
He sighed, pulling off his proper dress shirt and replacing it with the ridiculous one. “We’re going to a gay club, Gabriel. I’m fairly certain that my presence alone will do the trick.” At least his brother had chosen regular jeans for the affair. They were tighter than he’d prefer, but they weren’t skinny jeans. He hated those, he always felt like he was suffocating and it drew too much attention to his bulge which was already visible enough in regular clothes.
gave way to Page and Plant taking the stage together, Page with just an acoustic guitar and John Paul Jones behind them on keyboards for
“Yeah, so maybe some of you guys should clear out, make some ro--” Dean was cut off by the compartment door opening again, and sure enough Finnick Odair squeezed his way inside and sat down directly across from Dean.
His breath caught in his lungs, and he was grateful that he didn’t actually need the air in order to survive or he might’ve died on the spot. It had been too long, he needed Dean. He turned on his heel and locked the already closed door and flipped the sign. When he spun around again, Dean was disappearing into the back. Cass followed swiftly, tugging his jacket off before he even rounded the corner. When he did, he froze, his mouth hanging open and his cock thickening so fast in his jeans he thought it’d keep going until it exploded.
Dean was silent as his breathing slowly evened out. “Yeah, uhh… shit. Yeah. I’ve wanted to do that for…” he trailed off and tilted his head towards the sky. “A long ass time. Just didn’t think you’d ever want me, that’s all.”
but it still felt good enough that Dean no longer gave a shit what happened to him. He knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt that when Cass finally let him cum, it would be the best orgasm he ever had. The blowjob had just edged him, prepared him for the all-encompassing feeling of having Castiel inside of him. He whined as Cass’s length filled him again and again, relaxing him until he was completely pliant.
He dropped to his knees, letting his jet black wings out behind him as his hands ran up and down Dean’s thighs. He glanced up at the hunter’s face, searching for permission. Dean didn’t bother with an answer this time, he simply reached down and hastily undid his belt. Cass took the hint and slid Dean’s jeans down to his knees, leaving just his boxers in place. Castiel wasn’t a stranger to sex, he’d had his fair share of it in the centuries leading up to meeting Dean, and he knew exactly how make him squirm. Cass’s hot breath ghosted over Dean’s length through the fabric and Dean leaned into it, threading his fingers in Cass’s hair in an attempt to guide his head.
Lisa nodded again, more insistently this time. “You heard me, Winchester. You and your brother are going to come stay with me whether you like it or not. My mom already talked to yours, it’s all set up.” She grins and kisses him quickly. “It took me ages to convince my mom, but I finally did it. I told her how you have to stay at school over the holidays and you dread going home for the summer break, because your dad is such a --” She cut off abruptly and pursed her lips. “I’m sorry, Dean. You know what I mean, though. She thought it would be good for you two to spend some time with proper wizards, and I --” She blushed, and continued quietly, “I didn’t want to spend another summer away from you. Please tell me you’ll at least consider it?”
“That’s clever, coming from you! And here I was thinking they named Platform 9 ¾ after your IQ.” James puffed his chest out, sort of proud of that one. Dean closed the distance and interrupted loudly.
he’s made himself a Base camp for all of the tributes we thought were dead that are actually pretty damn alive.” He went on to explain the shapeshifters to her as they walked, and answered her questions about Purgatory the best that he could.
“Right, yes, okay. Well uh, I’m going to go change into my robes, I’ll see you for the feast, okay?”
Castiel wanted to agree. Wanted to reach over and kiss Dean until all the memories of the horror he’d been through disappeared, but there was one thing about what he said that made Castiel incapable of doing such a thing. “I can, Dean.”
Finnick’s eyes danced as he smirked at Dean. “What, are you afraid of a little competition, Winchester? That doesn’t sound like you at all. Who hurt you over the summer?”
He took his usual seat and pulled his Transfiguration book out of his bag, setting it down with a thump. He slid his wand out from its resting place in his robes, and eyed it fondly. 12 ½ inches long, rigid, and made of cypress wood. When he had gone to Ollivander’s before his first year at school, he had tried out a variety of different wands. Some responded to him pretty well, others not at all. But this one… this one was special. He could feel it the second the old wizard slid it into his hand. It was the feeling of coming home after a long trip, a kind of warm comfort that still wove it’s way through his body when he used the wand, even now. Mr. Ollivander had seemed delighted at his choice, and had told him he sold a similar wand just the year prior. Different wood, sure, but the unicorn that supplied the hair for Dean’s cypress wand also gave another hair. From what Ollivander had told him, the twin wand was made of willow. Dean hadn’t paid much attention after that; he knew that having twin cores was rare and would have some cool properties if he ever found it, but the chances of that were slim. He hadn’t thought to ask who bought the wand, and couldn’t very well go back and ask him now.
His eyes widened at the words, and he glanced at the analog clock hanging over his stove. It was half past two in the morning, and he’d only had the profile for roughly five hours.
He double-checked his course schedule for that afternoon and sighed, he had Transfiguration with the Slytherins, and that was never something he looked forward to. He made his way out of the castle and headed towards the courtyard that would lead him to the Transfiguration classroom. He kept his eyes peeled for his best friends, Sirius and James, but all he found were a couple of Slytherins making their way towards the same classroom. He recognized two of them - Jack Morningstar and a girl named Glimmer. The third person they were with didn’t look familiar at all, but that wasn’t saying a whole lot; Dean didn’t spend a lot of time paying attention to snakes. He lowered his head and kept walking, heading towards the west side of the courtyard. He let out a sigh of relief when he heard Sirius and James arguing loudly up ahead.
