like his teachers used to do back in primary school. Though he figured Sherlock wouldn’t appreciate it.
Somebody else’s post had dropped into his cereal, splattering it all over him, had he not been so riled up from the nightmare, he probably would’ve just wiped it off his face and poured another bowl. However, he was tensed up and tired, so rather than doing what he normally would have, he slammed his hands down on the table and stormed out of the great hall.
“Right, my turn, here.” Sherlock replied, handing over a package wrapped slightly more neatly, but not by much. “Also eloquent, I’m sure you’ll agree. Though I feel my gift is slightly idiotic now.”
“I got dressed myself today.” She told him excitedly, bouncing on the spot. She was wearing a pair of jeans, and a power-rangers t-shirt, and her wellington boots, also yellow.
Mycroft furrowed his brow, why were things now becoming difficult for him, to his knowledge he hadn't ingested any poison or drug that could slow him down, things weren’t visualising how they normally would and his heart rate had elevated considerably. He could feel the heat rising to his cheeks with no explanation. “I'm not following, you already pronounced me your best friend.”
Real John said something but he didn’t hear it properly, still transfixed on the reflection. Mirror John was looking at him with a look of pure adoration, he laughed suddenly and stood on his toes to press a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek.
The sorting passed quicker than it had last year, given the fact that his little brother hadn't taken up ten minutes this time. He, as head boy was required to escort and explain everything to the new first years.
Things continued as normal at Hogwarts. Sherlock, found this strange, John seemed to have completely ignored the fact that feelings had been revealed. Well, correction,
“Toilet roll with have to do for the moment. Get back into bed, I’m going to the shops.” Sherlock spoke, shedding his dressing gown as he walked out of the bathroom briskly, going for his coat.
“So, you can braid hair?” Was the first thing Sherlock said after they got seated at a table, two coffees and an orange juice sat in front of them.
They’d got him settled, made the diagnosis, gave him the remedy he supposedly needed. Throughout it all, Mycroft didn’t let go.
Things were normal on the train, he’d shut down a rowdy group of third years with a glare, and managed civil conversation with a group of other Slytherin’s.
He’d woken from a vicious nightmare involving his mother and a hippogriff, just about managed not to scream and wake up his dormmates, and then couldn’t get back to sleep due to the images of the dream clouding his head every time he closed his eyes longer than a blink.
Then it stopped, the whole commotion stopped, and it felt like time froze as Greg’s body stopped falling.
Greg ended up falling asleep on Mycroft’s shoulder, the Slytherin ended up reading on his phone, unmoving so to not disturb the other boy. John lounged back, able to put his legs up on the seat as he had the full side to himself, he was trying to catch some sleep, but he couldn’t.
John was doing homework, they were in Sherlock’s tower, John was on the floor and sherlock was behind him, John was sitting between Sherlock’s outstretched legs, and Sherlock was drawing patterns into his back as John tried not to shiver or jolt as it tickled.
Mycroft didn’t scream, he wanted to, but he couldn’t. His hand quickly fumbled for his wand, but he didn’t know a spell to help. Wingardium Leviosa was the thought he had but he wasn’t sure he could do it on something that far away or that big.
“Uhm, thank you.” John laughed at the out-of-the-blue compliment, squeezing his eyes shut as Sherlock moved to bury his head in John’s neck. His face was warm against John’s skin. “This doesn’t feel real. Am I even alive? Or did I die and get to heaven.”
“Oh Christ.” Mycroft dropped the umbrella in his hand, and legged it toward him, dropping to his knees beside him and checking his pulse. Greg’s tanned face was splattered with dirt, his expression peaceful as he lay unconscious, which seemed like the biggest irony.
Sherlock noticed a small spot of darkening red on Johns boxers, it wasn’t rapidly expanding, thank god, but that meant two other things. He sniffed, before squeezing his eyes shut at the realisation he’d just made, it was the considerably worse of the two things. “Well I’ve made a deduction.” He said, a soft sigh escaping his lips as he glanced up at the shorter man.
The younger boy looked up, brow furrowed for a moment before replying. “Lestrade said you ran from practice. And when I asked around people pointed in this direction. You were passed out, didn’t wake up when I shook you, so I went to get something to do and brought you some lunch. You eat in a regular pattern to my knowledge.”
“So, you are coming over this summer then?” Mycroft replied after a moment of thought, deciding against asking the more awkward questions that had been rattling around his skull for months at this point. Even though he’d done his best to lock them in a box and store them away in the very back crevices of his mind, they did still linger.
“Wait.” Mycroft replied simply. “Try and get Sherlock out, even if its just for a walk. He’ll go mad trapped in there.”
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” The question came from nowhere, and then there was a mug of tea sat in front of him, and then a man sat in front of him, his head resting against his hands.
As a prefect it was his job to check down the carriages every half hour, well, it was his hour, the other hours were taken by other prefects.
“And why would that be?” Sherlock replied, rolling his eyes and gesturing to himself. “A man can only stare at an idiot for so long before it gets boring.”
He’d never told anybody about his mum before, not his muggle friends, not his wizard friends, not even Harry. Saying the words hurt his throat but he forced them out anyway, if he was going to be Sherlock’s friend, if Sherlock was going to be his friend, then that meant Sherlock shouldn’t just be guessing everything about him. John needed to tell him some things.
Sherlock had been kind enough to invite him to sit, so he could avoid the Gryffindor table as long as possible. “She will most likely try to find you, once she realises what you’ve done.”
She laughed pulling away after the brief embrace. “Get over yourself, I know your heart better than you do. Go get ‘em Boss. Just promise me one thing?”
“I don’t, I’m just good at persuasion. If anyone asks, you had a nightmare.” Sherlock mumbled, his voice low and hitting John in all the right places. “Yes, I am a mind reader, no I wasn’t asleep, no you didn’t wake me.”
Without hesitance, Sherlock knelt over her and placed a gentle kiss to her forehead, to which she giggled. In his attempt to turn and go downstairs, she tugged at his sleeve.
John had a very good knack for changing the subject like it had never been awkward. Sherlock also knew he had a knack for dwelling on a subject when it bothered him.
“Game plan- What are you going to do?” She corrected herself, rolling her eyes at the head boy, supposedly the smartest in their year, yet he still didn’t know the term
He turned the box over in his hands, trying to find any indication on what he was supposed to do with it.
To his knowledge men that were friends generally didn’t go around showing affection to one another on the regular. They were no exception. They’d been mind-numbingly stereotypical in the manners that they’d done over the past two years. It wasn’t as though the Slytherin was cold toward him, he just lacked the knowledge of human responses. But Mycroft was almost certain that the hug he’d given Greg after the match was the
Sherlock chuckled in response. “It would be fitting for Christmas. But if you were in heaven, I would be nowhere to be found.”
“That just shows how little you understand the educational system, Phillip. They would never allow a psychopath to teach, a high functioning sociopath, however? Well, here I am.”
“And the cuddling?” John asked, turning his neck only to have Sherlocks curls tickle his nose. But he smiled anyway, pushing his face against it, pressing somewhat of a gentle kiss to the top of Sherlocks head.
John was seriously considering Sherlock’s remark about decking him one. “How dramatic.” He replied, turning to the door.
“You look dead.” He deadpanned. Sherlock thought that was a bit dramatic on John’s part, he was pale and skinny, in no way was he dead, unless bewitched, dead bodies didn’t normally move. “What the hell are you playing at?” John seemed upset and Sherlock frowned, he hadn't expected that reaction. “Are you trying to kill yourself? What the hell is this?”
Greg pulled away with flushed cheeked and lips red, a grin came over his face and he started to giggle. “God you have no idea how awful it’s been. I'm so stupid. If I knew it would be that nice I would’ve asked you sooner.”
The wall shifted back and slid into itself, John turned and gestured to the Ravenclaw to follow him. Once both boys were in the passage way, the door shut, and Sherlock began to speak.
People gasped as they watched him, his broom was practically vertical to the ground, the commentator was screaming, now the match was all on Greg, the Hufflepuff seeker, heading in a similar direction but clearly clueless as to where the snitch was.
“When else? Joseph Ragamuffin has the pitch booked till the next match, Johnstone’s ready to kill him.”
Sherlock nodded, still listening, still hearing nothing. “There wasn’t laughter or insult after it though.”
He could still remember the squeal of joy and the kiss on the cheek she’d given him as a thank you for it. And he certainly remembered the span of three weeks in which it was the only cup she’d drink out of.
The words fell from his lips and as Sherlock registered them John's own eyes went wide along with his, but Sherlock blinded by his own fury at the statement didn't notice, and braced himself for the incoming barrage of insults just raring to force themselves out of his mouth. He closed his eyes trying to keep the lock shut around his emotions. He wouldn't cry. He didn't care. He'd heard it all before and hearing it from John
He was quite relieved that he could sit back and watch the new first-years be sorted, rather than having to live through the pressure of being watched by the others, and then judged by a talking hat. Deciding he was going to be as welcoming as possible to any new Gryffindors, he relaxed in his seat as the names were called, joining in in the applause every time a new Gryffindor was sorted.
“Pot, kettle, any colour you like. Unlock the door.” John ordered, the authority in his voice was startling, he’d clearly improved since their last encounter. Mycroft supposed he would make a fine army captain then, since that was where he was inevitably headed.
Everybody else seemed to rely so much on their casting, and he’d seen John try to cast spells to no avail, he’d seen the boy nearly snap his wand in frustration because he just
Mycroft walked into the Gryffindor commons, he seemed to spend more conscious time in there than his own houses common room. Greg was sitting in his usual spot at the table, shuffling cards, an anxious habit he seemed to have. He glanced up noticing Mycroft’s presence as he sat down, a small smile lighting up his features. He liked that the Gryffindor’s mood seemed to lighten when he was around, for most other people the opposite was true. But yet either a smile or a wave or a small nod was given by Greg, even when simply passing one another in the halls.
At last the door opened slowly, Sherlock standing in his dressing gown and his clothes from last night, minus the blazer and his shoes. “Is that?..” He didn’t finish his sentence, his eyes trained to the needle in John’s leg.
The air had turned suddenly quite flirtatious, and for once in his life the prefect wasn’t uncomfortable with it. In fact, he was quite welcoming of it. “Enlighten me then.”
Mycroft noticed it before he did, but he was quick on the draw and soared quickly toward the snitch, flittering near the enemy goal.
At the end of practice whilst everybody was leaving to go wash up and enjoy the rest of their Saturday, Greg pushed John down onto a bench, kneeling in front of him, looking at him with a similar look of studying given to him by Sherlock. “Watson, you need to get some sleep. You missed three goals, that’s your most ever in a practice.”
“John.” He spoke trying to catch his attention, trying to buy himself some time before he actually had to offer some comforting words.
“Don’t apologise for this, John. It’s not your fault, its hers, she did this to you and nobody else. So just try to calm down, you shouldn’t be letting it get to you this much.” This wouldn’t effect him this much, Greg knew John, maybe he wasn’t a Holmes, maybe he couldn’t read minds, but he knew his friend. John was calm, he was a happy person, it took a lot to make him like this, so it couldn’t just be Sarah, if it was just Sarah he would have broke up with her and tried to get over it.
“Why not?” John asked, clearly before he’d thought, as his face tinted red the moment the words left his mouth.
She’d been told in little detail some of the stories from their cases. As an attempt to embarrass the older man John had told her about their Buckingham visit, but much to the doctor’s dismay that only caused her to hold Sherlock in higher regard.
He'd had top surgery a few months before, he claimed something about a flu, as an excuse to why he was bed ridden.
“I like that John boy.” She’d spoken with a delighted grin on her face as she looked at the photo, John waved and then elbowed Sherlock who rolled his eyes and forced a smile and a wave.
John followed him as he twisted through the crowd, having to run in places to keep up with the taller boy, damn his short legs.
He gave the Gryffindor a curt nod as he sat at the Slytherin table for the first years to be sorted.
So, when their badges arrived in the post it was the finishing touch. Mycroft was head boy, of course, that didn’t really come as a surprise, his badge the rich Slytherin green with silver writing. Greg was the Gryffindor Quidditch captain, which he was excited about, and Mycroft was proud of. The celebratory sort of dance he did upon receiving it was enough to make everyone present in the kitchen laugh out loud.
What he didn’t expect was to wake in the middle of the night to find a mad genius sprawled on top of him. Sherlock in his lanky state had made absolutely no effort to keep to his own. He was laying on his front, one arm over the top of John’s stomach, one leg between John’s, and the other half of him god knows where else.
Greg put a hand on his shoulder, not gripping tight enough to hurt, but firm, grounding him, holding him in place. “Stop. Stop talking, you’re getting worked up, just breathe alright?” He gave John a look and the younger boy nodded, closing his mouth and taking a slow breath through his nose. “She should get expelled for that, that
“Shut it Adler, I need to talk to her.” Mycroft managed to reply, glaring at her with more ferocity than Anthea.
“Gregory, you’ve been my friend for two years, you should know I won’t be going. Besides, mother and father are insistent I come home since Sherlock refuses to.”
And despite being married to his work, here Sherlock was, pressed against his side. A troubled marriage, John supposed and chuckled to himself.
“He dislikes me very strongly.” Mycroft finished for him, he knew his boyfriend hated to say any bad word about him, no matter how much he thought it.
“You told him his glasses were as real as his facial hair and he and the fake accent could go choke on a pigmy puff.”
He shook his head and sat up to watch properly. A house hadn’t been called yet, that was odd, and his interest had been grabbed.
“So, I now know you have no issue with the violin, though I do go days on end without talking, and other days on end without stopping, would that bother you?” Sherlock spoke, breaking the silence. John looked up at him, confused as to why Sherlock was telling him this, why he was asking him this. “There’s a flat in central London, two bedrooms, and a fairly spacious living area. I know the land-lady, she’ll give us a better rate.”
“I am aware this isn’t pleasant for you John. I know I'm taller, but I do respect your privacy, and I will do everything in my power to ensure I don’t see anything you’d wish me not to.”
to pick on it would be blue, the same as your house, which is the reason you picked Ravenclaw so the hat could sort you considering you fall equally into all four,
A stinging fire of pain shot across his face and he dropped his spoon. There it was. He expected it, he knew it was probably coming but it shocked him more than he’d expected it would. He turned to see Sarah, looking furious, es expected. Her face was as red as the handprint on his cheek and her expression looked like she’d just been slapped.
Mycroft laughed abruptly, covering his mouth to silence the unexpected outburst, before clearing his throat. “You might need a moment or two to adjust, but you don’t need rehabilitation.”
Despite the fact that John now slept, dressed and had sex with Sherlock, in Sherlock’s bedroom, that they now shared. Sherlock had never seen John’s chest.
Sarah, of course, knew all about what happened, she’d badgered John to tell her the moment he stepped back into the Gryffindor commons. He didn’t particularly think she had any right to know, considering all she’d ever done in regards to Sherlock was give him dirty looks. He told her anyway, because she was his girlfriend and it would be rude to hide it from her. So, when an official looking letter just about missed his bowl, she was just as, if not more, excited than he was.
“You knew the whole time didn’t you.” John replied bitterly, glaring at him for no other reason than his desire to glare at something, Sherlock just happened to be the nearest thing.
"Of course I know. I'm the worlds only consulting detective. And you need to dispose of your shots more discretely."
Mycroft stood with his hands behind his back, posture impeccable as usual, trying to hide how tensed he was, terrified to know what this was, what was going on, dreading the answer he would be given.
Sometimes he wasn’t sure he was even a wizard, but anytime he thought that, McGonagall seemed to know, and reminded him that he’d been given a letter, that the hat had sorted him, and that he was the best keeper they’d had since Oliver Wood.
Mycroft ran a hand over his eyes, like he was talking to the biggest dunce on the planet. “I don’t mean physically, you idiot. You know you didn’t say goodbye to him before we departed for summer?”
“Hey freak! Don’t have your boyfriend to protect you now, do you?” The distinguishable nasally drawl of Phillip Anderson came from behind him. He didn’t turn round, and continued walking, a stupid miscalculation, he’d insulted Anderson less than a week ago, likening the chances of persistence in his torment. “Nothing clever to say? There’s a change.” An abrupt hand on his shoulder flipped him round so he was facing the seventh year. “Gone deaf now have you?”
Mycroft blinked breaking their unannounced staring contest, directing his focus to his cards, clearing his throat. “I’ll go after John, if you go after Sherlock. I propose we set up a study date, and if things don’t go well, then Sherlock will stop staring like a lovesick schoolgirl.”
“I don’t know. I'm not really good at much.” He replied honestly, trying not to acknowledge the shocked look on both Conrad and Lydia’s faces.
He dropped his gaze before he was caught, and instead went to staring at his hands, cracking his knuckles as a distraction from everything else. The noise. The
Their eyes met again, but this time he gave more than just a smile, he raised a hand above his head and made a fist. He couldn’t help but grin in response as Greg mimicked his action, before his hand met the broom again and he propelled his entire body down as he practically became one with the stick.
Sherlock dropped his arms from around John, walking away from him like this was perfectly normal. Like they hadn’t just exchanged Christmas gifts, like he hadn’t just changed John’s life, like they hadn’t just shared their first kiss.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, placing his own hand on John’s shoulder. “It is. Put your hand on my back, just below my shoulder. Now we’re gonna do a box so back, left, forward, right.” He wasn’t ordering, put instructing as they went, and a soft smile of triumph came onto John’s face as they completed the step. “Now repeat, and make it fluid, there you go.” Sherlock laughed, smiling proud as they kept going to the rhythm, a waltz step probably wasn’t the best for the music, but it was the easiest.
Summer came around quicker than anticipated. Easter seemed to be glossed over, April fools however came with the same grandiose it did every year.
Sherlock panicked then, and for the first time in his entire life he tried to take something back. He’d been wrong, he hadn’t seen the possibility of John being upset.
He pushed John off of him almost immediately, he saw the mixture of hurt and confusion on John’s face and unlike himself, he immediately scrambled to excuse himself. “I’m sorry I can’t- I can’t- Please.”
Sherlock gave him a gentle smile, he could feel that same interestingly warm feeling that he got when he first told John he liked him. “It’s fantastic, John. Now please tell me I can give you mine? Or do you have another five presents shoved up your jumper?” He raised a brow and John grinned back at him, rolling his eyes.
It was quiet, too quiet, the silencing charm on the room was driving Mycroft insane, even a yell or a scream would be enough for him to relax, any indicator that his brother was alright. He was anxious. Greg was anxious and it was only adding to his own worry.
“You’re Sherlock aren’t you?” He asked, taking a seat opposite the first-year, who looked at him quizzically. “Myc’s little brother yeah?”
Comfortable silence swept over the compartment, Mycroft stole the occasional glance at Greg, who didn’t seem to notice, too busy shuffling the deck of muggle playing cards he’d brought with him. Mycroft made a note to ask him to play before they got to Hogwarts.
He came out moments later, jumper in his hand, looking pleased as all get out, chest flat underneath the shirt that he was too self-conscious to wear on its own.
Sarah, per John’s request to Dumbledore, albeit quite frantic, was to serve detention and removed from the quidditch team.
I'm sick. and I wanted to write a festive chapter before im completely and utterly sick of the season.
Greg sat down at the usual table Mycroft sat at, he was out of breath and tenser than usual, clearly he’d been looking for him. That usually meant something was quite seriously exciting or quite seriously wrong. “Can I talk to you? Outside?” He asked once the slythein looked up at him quizzically, and Mycroft didn’t need another word of persuasion to shut his book and follow the Gryffindor out toward the empty quidditch pitches.
He pulled away, almost too abruptly for John, the suspect had now stopped staring and went back to work, deeming Sherlock’s presence unimportant. He allowed John to stare at him for a moment, eyes dilating in deep blue as he didn’t doubt his own were, that being their first kiss of hopefully many. John supposed it was rather clever, that idea, but he also supposed the taller man most likely had ulterior motives underneath. Not that he was opposed to those motives either.
It hadn't quite set in yet that he’d be going home and possibly never coming back (unless Sherlock did something immensely awful. Considering the route he was currently taking that didn’t seem completely implausible). Father had set him up with an internship at the ministry, if he played his cards right, in a years’ time he could be permanent and four positions up.
The Ravenclaw handed the cube to John, who looked at him confused. “Mix it up, it’ll be no fun if I do, make it a challenge.” John rolled his eyes, but he was giving Sherlock that smile of amazement he did when Sherlock was being particularly clever, or helpful.
“Don’t think that’ll go unnoticed, Watson.” The taller boy replied, stepping up the ladder, effortlessly.
Sherlock stopped for a brief moment, turning to his desk again and scribbling something down on a sticky-note. He pressed it to John’s chest, and the shorter man’s hand instinctively went over his, holding it there. “Here, my personal number, I prefer to text and I do like coffee. Evening.”
Rolling his eyes, he walked out the door, where Sherlock was standing cigarette in hand, a car was parked at the side of the road by his house. He was wearing slim dress trousers, that hugged his legs. The rest of what he was wearing was covered by a trench coat, leaving the only pop of colour as the deep blue scarf that caught everyone’s attention.
As he thought he didn’t even realised John shifting closer and before he knew it John’s hands were on his cheeks. His eyes went wide and John pressed their lips together.
The professor trusted Mycroft enough as head boy to leave him in charge whilst he went to discuss the issue with the headmaster.
“Anxiety.” John corrected quickly. He still got mild amusement out of the things that Sherlock pronounced wrong, hearing him try to talk about a television one on of their late-night flying lessons had been the funniest thing John had heard in a long time.
The quiet giggles that circled around the classroom, and the lack of work that was actually being focused on didn’t matter at this point, because the warmth that spread from his face to his chest and fizzled down to his toes was worth it.
“Yes, I know!” John burst out suddenly, before cringing back on himself, he hadn’t meant it to sound so whiny, he was just
John was awake when Mycroft walked into the Gryffindor dormitories, Greg hadn't been able to sleep either, so they were keeping each other company, each with a mug of tea and a hand of cards.
“Alright then, we have a clever one, do we? Let me be clear that there will not ever be a tolerated ridicule of another pupil in this class. The only bad word spread, should be from
The shorter boy returned moments later with a plate. Judging by the slowness of his breathing he presumed Sherlock had, against his best motives, fallen asleep. He was passed out, long legs sprawled over the side of the bed, hands clasped over his stomach, soft, slow breaths leaving his lips. He looked elegant.
"Yes, that's one way of putting it." He took in a breath before continuing. "Well, there is a free room up the stairs, its the janitors closet, fairly soundproof. She has chronic OCD so the room will be spacious, and she only works Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays." He nodded at the two, who didn't seem to get it, and he pinched the bridge of his nose, trying his hardest not to roll his eyes. "Sergeant Donovan, you're wearing the perfume Anderson likes, your dress is his favourite colour, and seemingly you listened when he said you were perfect without makeup, and instead chose a nude palette knowing he wouldn't know the difference. Lestrade could have worked out that you are desperate for intercourse. Now go." John stared at him in disbelief, he'd become adjusted to the deductions, internalising his astonishment. The other two scowled at him but walked toward the stairs anyway.
As far as he was concerned, Sherlock’s parents were perfectly normal people. Sure, they were smart, but they didn’t deduce like Mycroft and Sherlock did. They seemed to show more emotion, and definitely weren’t shy of affection, to one another, and anybody they noticed needed it.
stupefy Molly Hooper, he had a solid alibi. The staff were just so useless as to not figure out who the real culprit was, instead opting for the easiest option, to confine his little brother.
“Obviously.” John replied, forcing his voice down to mimick him, crying out in laughter when Sherlock dug him in the ribs. “We have one, though I mostly use it now.”
It was his second year at Hogwarts and he still couldn’t believe that he was allowed to be here. That he could escape his wretched excuse for a family for the whole year.
Sherlock avoided Johns waist, knowing that touching him there was likely to elicit a negative reaction. Instead he chose to keep his hand cupped against Johns cheek and the other against the kitchen table.
seen this coming. His little brother was a tyrant at the best of times it was only a matter of time before John got fed up. Considering his relationship with Sarah was
He ignored his phone even after he got out of the shower, there was nobody to judge him but himself, and he still felt that checking it twenty minutes after he’d sent the message would be embarrassingly desperate.
John rolled his eyes, before taking off after him. He winced but pushed forward anyway. He’d had P.E as his last lesson the day before and everything ached, not to mention the constraints on his chest causing him some
It was as if the events of the morning hadn’t even taken place. It was as if the events of the afternoon were perfectly reasonable.
John wore his binders almost religiously at this point. Sherlock had watched him put them on and take them on countless times. The doctor had a total of three. A white one, a black one, and a camouflage green one, all of which just reached his waist, leaving his midriff exposed, which was left often bruised by Sherlocks mouth.
“Stupefied then.” Sherlock noted to himself and John as he stood up. He walked toward her and reached for his wand. “Rennervate.” He muttered, with the movement of his wand. The spell succeeded, but it didn’t work. He swallowed, before turning to face John, who looked just as scared as he felt. “This is stronger than it should be. Go to the library and tell somebody to alert Professor Spout and Madame Promfrey.” He asked the Gryffindor, before walking in careful circles around her, trying to work out how it had happened.
John shook his head, before following the man, closing the door behind him. He managed to get himself sat at the small table by the kitchen.
“That’s a change. I mean what are we to each other? Boyfriends? Friends with benefits?” He cringed at that, saying it seemed to leave a sour taste in his mouth. “Because I'm sure that flatmates-that-make-out-in-the-kitchen isn’t a sufficient label.”
Sherlock smiled softly to himself as a flustered looking John Watson ran into the library, slowing his roll immediately as the librarian glared at him. His eyes trained sherlock almost immediately and he walked over as quickly as his body would allow.
He’d waited for the album to finish, waited to let Greg calm down, and for the information settle in his own mind. This was maybe his biggest cock up. He’d been useless to help John, he’d upset Greg, hurt him. This entire situation was hurting him, how could he have been so blind to it?
Halloween fell upon Hogwarts like it usually did. With ghastly ghouls and gory decorations, scares and shocks as people walked down the halls.
John smiled up at him once she closed the book, he took his mug from Sherlock with a grateful nod, and he handed Rosie her cup, she looked at it in disgust. “It’s tea, I don’t like tea.” She frowned, and John gave him a look of
xxx, interesting. He turned it back over in his hand, pressing the home button revealed a picture of a dog and he resisted the urge to smile. He loved dogs. “No one, I worked it out.” He muttered, still looking at John’s phone, which was password protected. It would’ve been easy to break had it been a number code, but it was a word. Sherlock didn’t know John well enough to guess so he handed it back. “Fascinating devices these, it’s a wonder we still don’t use them. We look down on muggles for how they work yet we still use candle light and you use electrissy.”
However, it was Christmas, the enchanted armour sang carols in the halls, and they were wearing party hats from their breakfast crackers, Sherlock’s was a black pirates hat and John’s was a feathered green one. He’d claimed it to look like that of Peter Pan, to Sherlock’s confusion.
He could remember the first time John ever got changed in his room. He had been stealing fervent glances at the taller man as he dressed, Sherlock would admit, if embarrassedly, that he’d done the exact same thing.
His breathing quickened as his vision went cloudy and his body threatened to go limp and slip of the broom, he managed to guide himself down before he fell completely, rolling on the grass like he was boneless before coming to a halt, chest heaving.
Softly at first, he pushed a finger in, a smile crossing his lips as John let out soft, frantic whines, and he added another. "Faster, for the love of fuck go faster." John ordered using the hand that wasn't on Sherlock, to stroke his cock.
“You know Mycroft? He’s a prefect in Slytherin.” John caught on remembering vaguely the looming ginger figure that seemed to avoid the rules yet simultaneously abide them to the letter. He nodded, gesturing for Mike to continue. “He’s a Holmes as well, they’re brothers, not that they look it. Suppose strange names are a family trait.”
“Not until you see reason John, I’m only trying to help you.” Mycroft knew there was no reasoning, bargaining maybe, but he still had to try his options, he had many ways of knocking the air clean out of the younger boy if he needed to.
The panic set in once again, heart beat quickened, breathing difficult, hands shaking so badly he could barely control them. He clocked it all at once, they were the symptoms, it was happening again, and he’d sprinted.
“You’re doing quite well, considerably less of an idiot than anybody else I know. Their funny little brains, working half the speed they could if only they’d just
He froze, glancing over at the taller man, who was staring out the window at the streets as they drove past.
The Gryffindor could tan, French relatives or something along those lines. So, he chose to make the most of the sun when it came to England, especially considering he couldn’t go to France this year either. And there he basked in the warmth of the sun, looking perfectly at peace.
His hoodie had ridden up, and Sherlocks arm was warm against his skin, hand limp at the end, his fingertips barely grazing the edge of John’s hips but it was enough to make him squirm.
They didn’t talk that much, aside from John’s explanation of what rugby was. In Sherlock’s opinion it sounded ridiculous, who in their right mind would willingly stand to be tackled and piled upon?
“If it’s any consolation, I think the red underwear looks dashing.” Sherlock remarked, and John was too tired to even think about getting flustered. Despite Sherlock’s thigh pressed firm against his crotch. “Do you know how many signs of arousal there already are?” He asked the question as if he were asking the price of milk.
“I figured you’d be here.” Mycroft spoke, calmly and he took a seat opposite the now drunken Gregory.
He didn’t do it on purpose, he just picked a point to look at before wandering through his mind-palace, trying to find any indication he had on what house he’d prefer. Flashes of red, and blue and green, the traits of each floating around in his head.
The coma was a result of the head injury, well it wasn’t a coma per say. Greg had definitely clicked back into consciousness a few times over the course of the past few days. He just seemed to squint before deciding against waking up properly and going back to sleep, whether it was voluntary or not, was indecipherable.
“Okay, its okay, I’m here Sherlock, I’m not leaving.”  He ran his thumb over Sherlock’s knuckles, trying to give him any sort of stimulant to focus on.
Sherlock frowned, rolling his eyes and turning back to his book. “I don’t do tutoring, and unfortunately my transfiguration is only fourth-year level, so it wouldn’t be much use anyway.” He muttered distractedly, in the way that aggravated Mummy and Father so much (
“I told you, I don’t care. What happened this morning didn’t mean anything to me.” Sherlock spoke, when John turned from the TV to look at him, he was met with the pale green. “Stop worrying about it.”
, his only proper friend and I insulted him. I called him a freak, Mike. I'm just as bad as Anderson.” His voice broke, and he rubbed a hand over his face in an attempt to hide the distress, but he knew he wasn’t fooling anybody, least of all himself.
He hadn't been able to say goodbye to John before school went out. The Gryffindor had been too caught up in the celebration of the Quidditch cup and got the train home in a carriage with Sarah, and her group of friends. Sherlock chose to sit with some of the nicer older Ravenclaw’s who he sat near in the great hall. They didn’t particularly acknowledge his existence but made an effort to speak to him occasionally throughout the journey, even though he ignored them anyway.
The taller boy offered him a soft smile, before throwing the cigarette to the ground, stamping it out with his foot.
" His voice was that of amazement when the pieces aligned in a case, but this was more, this was so much more.
“So does Sherlock, seemingly.” He’d muttered in response, secretly quite pleased that his brother had somebody to look after him, despite how imbecilic he was in reality.
He curved his fingers under the tougher fabric at the front, the fabric that didn’t stretch. With efficiency and as little contact as he could manage, he got it over John’s chest, and John visibly relaxed. He was slightly unsure if it would be too far but considering John couldn’t do it to its full extent, he completed John’s flattening ritual.
“That’s reassuring. Considering it wouldn’t be too hard for you to stop it- Was this supposed to be a comforting gesture?” John laughed into Sherlock’s hair.
“We were…” He paused, realising this might not be the most pleasant topic to discuss with his boyfriend. “Are you comfortable?”
He checked the most likely spare bedroom for John to have run to, and the second most likely spare bedroom. After he reached the fifth most likely, he gave up, John would show up at some point. That, or Mrs Hudson would find him and drag him to the dining room for dessert, knowing he hadn’t eaten.
Sherlock smirked. “You’ve got a psychosomatic limp, of course you have a therapist. A coma patient could have told you that.”
“Have you asked anybody to the dance yet?” Greg asked as they took seat at the bar of The Three Broomsticks. His shoulder bag was resting at his feet, now filled with presents and Mycroft’s umbrella sticking out of the zip.
Sarah was ever-loving, overbearing, insistent on her demands, so he tried his best to fill her headstrong ideals.
He was inexperienced, having never been in a relationship before, this being his first kiss. John led with gusto, his mouth soft and warm against Sherlock’s. His fingers carded gently through his curls and pulled gently and Sherlock – against his will – moaned against John.
“Despite my disregard for human sensation, I do enjoy things that feel pleasant.” Sherlock replied, his voice a low murmur. “Including this, I like this, it’s nice.” He added. “Are you feeling any better?”
Once he got to his bedroom, he did the usual pokes and prods, twists and turns and finger waggling to work out why the hell it was hurting.
“Yes but Sherlock mayn’t be so forgiving.” Mycroft replied, clear disdain written in his tone, it wasn’t like him to get so worked up over a matter regarding his brother.
Well, the fact that he was magically inept helped his case as well. Nobody said it, but it was obvious that is what they were thinking.
And suddenly this was more than just a person crying, Sherlock had been able to watch any tom, dick or harry cry and not feel a thing. This was his best friend crying, this was John.
John dropped his shoulders and simply stared at her. She wasn’t making any logical point and he was getting annoyed now. “Okay now you aren’t making any sense.”
" John gasped, he gripped the sheets with one hand, using the other to cover his eyes as soft repeated moans escaped his lips.
John glanced at it for a moment, before laughing at the comment. “God no. I don’t have a musical bone in my body.”
He was wearing a pair of normal black trousers, though he was considerably lacking as far as his torso went.
He had no clue what he was about to see. He wanted to avoid the temptation but once he had his eyes fixed on the mirror it was hard for him to look away.
But when he finally got seated at his usual spot at the Gryffindor table, he did not expect Gregory Lestrade to sit down, acting as if everything was perfectly normal, with striking locks of black hair on his head.
.” He insisted, cursing the pain in his leg, knowing that it shouldn’t be there, but his mind insisted it was.
“He didn’t listen to you did he?” Greg spoke, a soft smile on his face as he leaned into Mycroft’s warmth.
His dad didn’t give a shit, neither did Harry and his mum had been long out of the picture. So, no suspicion was ever raised.
She let out a hum of a laugh, and moved to sit opposite him at the table, lighting a candle with the flick of her wand to fill the room with dim light. He didn’t doubt that he was the only person aside from her family that had seen her without makeup. “Irene did them. Answer my question Mycroft.” She snatched the phone from him, forcing him to engage in some sort of interaction with her. He could’ve smiled at that, had he ever done the same she would’ve broken his hand, he learned early on that nobody touches her Blackberry without permission or at all.
But this was far more exciting. His eyes drew their way down John's body, studying how he moved, his facial expressions depending on how hard he thrusted into him. John gripped Sherlock's wrist, his fingers pressing so hard against the skin it might bruise.
John still had Rosie in his lap, hands wrapped around her, holding her close as they read from the story book, it was a Winnie The Pooh entry, that she adored. They were nearing the end of the familiar story and she was getting tired.
“Can you get cook to send a few pastry things up to my room. Twat over here hasn’t eaten for-“ He turned to face John, who tensed up now they were both staring at him. Sherlock’s eyes traced over his body then rested at his face, his expression annoyed. “Two days… Something to keep him
“It might rain, you don’t know, did you ask the weatherman?” She replied, flopping herself down in his lap so he could brush the tangles her blonde curls. He didn’t doubt they’d inevitably turn brown, but everybody liked to fawn over it anyway.
“Okay, calm down, I didn’t mean to pry.” He bit his lip for a minute, before turning the book around for Sherlock to read, despite the fact the Ravenclaw had already read it from where he’d been sitting. “I don’t get this bit, give us a hand.”
“It’s fine.” He replied, offering a warning glare to John who just raised his eyebrows and made a face of mock innocence.
“I don’t know.” Considering what his answer was, it suddenly didn’t seem all that surprising that Sherlock couldn’t deduce it.
Greg didn’t say anything, and instead chose to watch Mycroft as he worked, trying he focus on the gentle caress of nimble fingers over his arm, rather than the dull pain that ached from his wrist.  He moved his fingers when asked, turning his hand as far as possible without the sharp pain crying up his arm, trying not to grimace as the Slytherin gently prodded at his wrist.
A petite woman, slightly shorter than John, came bustling round the corner. “Yes, Sherlock what’s the matter!” Her short hair framed her face and she held a tray under her arm, a newspaper in her hand.
John looked up at him, confused as to the need for him to break the quiet. It was late, and they were in Sherlocks tower, studying before lights out and John would have to rush back to the Gryffindor commons. If he got caught then he could say he got lost,
Mycroft covered his mouth to hide a laugh at Greg’s bluntness. “Christ, don’t insult me, I do have taste you know.”
“The pubs’ll still be there tomorrow.” Greg repeated, giving John a look that shut him up and warned him not to be guilty about it. He still couldn’t help but feel that it was his fault. “Unless Sherlock explodes them all in rage.” He joked and the three of them shared a smile, even if it vanished quickly. The idea was plausible, not that any of them would ever share that thought.
John went a brilliant shade of red and turned around to grab his broom from the forest floor where it had fallen. “Sun’s coming up. I’ll walk you back to the commons.” He muttered making the same motions as before against the trunk of a thick tree. “Same time next week?” He didn’t turn round but tilted his head to the side Sherlock was at behind him.
“Shh now sweetheart, it’s alright, Daddy’s here.” John spoke in a gentle voice, kneeling by her bed, he pushed some of her unruly blonde hair from her face, wiping the tear tracks off her cheeks. “What’s all this about, hm?” His tone was soft, and he gave Sherlock a smile as the taller man knelt beside him.
It wasn’t until Sherlock placed on of his hands at John’s waistband did he jolt, hard, forward and away from Sherlock. His eyes were wide, and he squeezed his eyes shut, he hated that feeling.
He through his legs over the bed, and stared at the stupid fabric sling. God it was the cane all over again.
He hooked his fingers underneath the hem of the binder, tugging it further down John’s back, before moving his hands to John’s front, he heard John’s breath hitch.
“Gregory, go find Professor Flitwick, John and I will explain the situation to the engineer.” Mycroft ordered, John knew very well his calm exterior was a front for all the worry he was trying to conceal.
“John.” He answered simply, moving his hand to cup the shorter man’s face, leaning down to press his lips against John’s, gently first, before John pushed back harder.
Greg Lestrade was grinning through the glass at him, knocking the glass and saying something too muffled for Mycroft to hear, and he rolled his eyes opening the door.
“John, I came to offer an apology. I realise I was out of line and may have caused you embarrassment. Though, I can assure you, Mother and Father are quite pleased with you, as Sherlocks only friend.”
“Sarah.” She deadpanned, looking at John like he was an idiot, whilst he just stared back at her in disbelief. This was ridiculous.
“Myc?” He called out, he could hear music playing softly throughout. Mycroft had given him a record player for his birthday, though it seemed to be more of a present for Mycroft than for Greg himself. He didn’t mind it though.
“I need both of them to do the shot and I can’t pull it out either.” John replied if a little exasperatedly, he knew that Sherlock knew exactly why he’d called him here and yet this was the one time he chose to lay back from acting on his deductions. “Look, I need you to help me. It’s already in you just need to push the plunger and take it out, you’ve had enough experience with needles to know how.” He added, his words carrying more bite than he intended but Sherlock didn’t look phased.
“It’s all a case of have and want. All I'm here to do, is to remind you that in the inevitable fall, you will want him there to catch you, so I wouldn’t ditch him now.”
He didn’t have the best broom in the world, but it was decent. That didn’t matter in the slightest when he was such a good player.
He’d never missed anyone before. Ever. Not even Mycroft (maybe a little but he’d take that secret to the grave). He’d never missed a friend before, never cared about anyone before, never really had anyone
He ignored how his face began to heat up, saved by the door opening and the two teenagers emerging. Sherlock trunk in hand, John with the same frustrated expression on his face, the confused expression that Mycroft imagined mirrored his thoughts most of the time.
Mrs Hudson came to John’s rescue before he lost his nerve and snogged Sherlock’s face off. “Sherlock! I brought what you asked!” She called up the ladder.
He didn’t say anything, but he could see Mycroft, in the darkened living room, he was silhouetted with only the navy-blue sky and yellow of a table lamp illuminating the room.
Mycroft wasn’t sure why he was so surprised, he knew from the beginning in the field that Greg would be fine. Well, that’s what he’d tell the Gryffindor, he wasn’t fully aware that Greg would make a full recovery until Madame Promfrey had reassured him that.
John took in a breath, trying to keep his cool, he didn’t want to panic, and he didn’t want to get angry, the most he could do was stand there and act like he was fine, and not freaking out in a locked room with a skilled wizard who could easily do anything to him. “So, what about him?”
From what he’d told the Gryffindor about his family, John thought they sounded wonderful, maybe a little overbearing but he’d taking overbearing over alcoholic any day of the week. Somehow Sherlock seemed to realise his discomfort on the topic of family and shut his mouth halfway through a sentence, something John had never expected to witness.
Sherlock managed not to grin as she dropped John’s hand and went a brilliant shade of pink in embarrassment. “O-Oh, uhm, I-“ She stammered as John furrowed his brow, partially in annoyance with Sherlock but partially in confusion with Sarah.
The meal was over in ample time, Sherlock was going to show him a spell he’d been working on over the summer but as he went to follow the younger boy, a hand caught his shoulder. He turned to see Mycroft, looking not unlike professor Snape with the stern look he had fixated on the younger boy.
That’s what girlfriends were, they came and replaced your friends no matter how close you were before-hand to either party, because romantic relationships seemed to tower over platonic ones in the hierarchy of association.
Mycroft allowed himself to smile properly, relieved that Greg was alright, that he’d woken in the first place. “You’re welcome.”
Valentines day was in two days, John had been given a few letters, but he either didn’t know who’d sent them, or didn’t like who’d sent them, and hadn't responded. One of the worst parts of being on the quidditch team, as John had told him one day after practice, was that your name got yelled out for everyone to hear, everyone who came to watch suddenly knew who you were.
His head rested against Sherlock’s chest once he relaxed enough to slump forward, and before he knew it he was crying, as the younger boy held him close, rubbing what he supposed were to be soothing circles into his back.
“I meant it when I said you were gorgeous, I thought I went too far then. That you’d know, the kiss on the cheek was probably walking on thin ice.”
That didn’t make any sense whatsoever. Was Mycroft drunk or something? Usually he was the only Holmes that made any semblance of sanity, now he just seemed to be spouting gibberish poetry.
John got up silently, his walk out of the room was brisk. Sherlock glared momentarily at Mycroft, the expression disappearing the moment his parents turned back to him.
Anderson was his height, if a few millimetres taller. He liked to think himself a ladies man. He wasn’t all that attractive, his hair and his gait was ridiculous, and his tone of voice sent unpleasant shivers down the back of Sherlock’s neck.
“Where?” Mycroft called after him, pacing after him, but he already had his coat on, opening the door.
that usually fell from his lips didn’t feel appropriate or helpful in this instance. For the first time in his life he was left clueless as to what he was supposed to do here. He couldn’t read anything from Greg other than shame and upset. God he really wasn’t great with people, was he? “Do you-“ He cleared his throat. “Do you want a hug?” He asked.
He just hoped whatever was added to his finger was something he liked, or something, whatever John he ended up with, liked. Though it was unlikely that he would ever find that John, so he should just get used to having it there for the next however many years he lived.
“’Course I did. Where else would I get a scarf that plays Danse Macabre from the tassels? Why? Are you impressed with me, Holmes?”
Once he got over the initial shock, his hand found the back of John’s head, the other went to his back. “Have a good year, mate.”
“I mean were you planning to?” John asked, letting out a quiet giggle at the notion, Sherlock smirked with an eyeroll.
“Pleasure.” Mycroft replied with a nod, turning to give the password, as he did so Greg made a move he hadn't predicted.
“Here.” Sherlock’s voice came again, and something soft was draped over his shoulders, falling down his back, surrounding him in a soft sense of comfort, of safety. “You’re bound to be freezing.”
“Well my Father pays for it whilst I move up in the ministry, he wants me to be at his level before he’ll allow me to take over that responsibility.”
He was sitting with his face in his knees, crying when Sherlock found him. The Ravenclaw sat in front of him, placing a gentle hand on his shoulder.
"Cabbie's just arrived, come on." Sherlock replied, offering John a smile before he put his phone in his pocket.
“You, I love you just as much.” He breathed out, and he couldn’t believe the words that had just fallen from his lips, all rationality seemed to have left his body in that moment and he could have cursed himself had it not been for the doctor’s next actions.
Shakily, John pushed himself up, shivering a little, realising now that he was stark naked and they lived in England. He watched Sherlock intently, as he left the room for a moment, coming back with a basin, and a washcloth.
“Okay.” Again, he picked apart the wrapping carefully, and John watched intently as he did so. Inside was a blue notebook, written on the front was a title of sorts. “Everything you need to know about the muggle world, a guide, by John Watson.” He smiled as he read it aloud, flipping it open to the first page.
Greg would have to speak to Sherlock, as the first-year seemed to be making a conscious effort to avoid Mycroft for a reason he couldn’t deduce outside of a pre-teen mood-swing. Besides it would be too obvious if Mycroft brought it up to him anyway.
“Tomorrow I think, Sherry is going positively mad having to wait.” She gave Mycroft a knowing look that made his stomach drop.
It wasn’t from a night-terror this time. But from the realisation that he’d been asleep in the first place, because he didn’t remember falling asleep.
He thought it would take place after a case, yes. But he thought it would be because John was hyped up on adrenaline and lost all cognitive thoughts. He thought it would happen in the heat of the moment and go unspoken for years to come.
Mycroft knelt in front of him, worry rising in his throat, gently he pulled Sherlocks hands away from the sides of his head, thumbs resting gently in the Ravenclaw’s palms, smearing ink onto his fingertips. “Sherlock, what’s wrong? Talk to me.” He kept his voice soft, low, forcing every ounce of warmth he could into it. He hadn't spoken to his brother like that in a long time, he could feel his voice cracking as tears threatened to rise in his throat. He didn’t know when or why they’d become like this, but he hated himself for it.
Sherlock cocked a brow at him, sniffing in annoyance, before turning back to his book and John felt a pang of guilt in his already sick stomach. “You go between wishing I’m an idiot and praising my brilliance, how am I supposed to tell which?” The Ravenclaw replied pointedly.
“He wanted me to come to the pub with him, so he could buy me my first pint, now I'm eighteen, my birthday happened at school remember?”
Greg frowned, Mycroft's words sounded quite foreboding, like things were a lot more serious than he was letting on. “You can always come stay with me? You’ll have to learn your way around Muggle society anyway.”
He knew John loved Christmas, he hadn’t really had a good one since his mother passed away, but he chose to focus and hold onto the times when she was.
“What I said, on- on the last day, I’m sorry.” John replied a slight stutter to his voice, he was nervous.
They were silent for the rest of the journey, Greg payed the cabbie when they arrived at the station. There was a pause and a held breath of apprehension before they went in.
The smell of whatever was on that plate caught his attention, and he sighed, stabbing whatever it was with his fork and brining it to his lips.
Maybe John imagined it, but with his ear pressed against Sherlock’s chest he could’ve sworn he heard his heartbeat speed up. Now would’ve been a spectacular time to have had his stethoscope.
John naturally stood with his legs pressed together, despite the fact that he sat with his legs spread. At first it was presumable but that was due to his army background, his posture, apart from the limp, was rigid and proper. That was until John focused on Sherlock more and deliberately adjusted his stance to match. He still had that habit, though he'd become more conscious about it.
“You were an army doctor? Of course, that makes so much sense.” Sherlocks eyes widened in realisation, and an amazed smile came over his features.
“Yes, love? What’s the matter?” He asked, pushing open her door, which, as she’d requested, had been painted a golden yellow.
“Myc?” His voice came soft and broken, he didn’t move, but his eyes were open now, staring at the ceiling, hand still clasped comfortably, firmly in Mycroft’s.
The Gryffindor rolled his eyes, taking his hand off his face and straightening his posture. “I can take it, honest.”
They’d allowed Mycroft in because he was his brother, he couldn’t be certain that they’d let John in too on the off chance that he’d make things worse instead of better. “Lockie, I don’t know if I-“
“Don’t be, Myc. I'm just being a jealous git for no reason, honest.” Mycroft’s mouth quirked up at the nickname, and he heard Greg sigh, pushing his mouth into the shoulder of Mycroft’s coat. He mumbled something into the fabric that sounded an awful lot like “
It was unlikely anyone would take notice. But Greg was the Gryffindor Seeker, and potential new captain of the quidditch team, he couldn’t ruin his reputation. He knew fully well that those who still obsessed over blood purity were also very against most other minorities as well, and if one of them saw, it wouldn’t take long for it to spread around the castle. Not even Anthea could shut down school rumours.
Everything he could be thinking about at that moment was gone, his head was filled with TV static and white noise as he spooned cereal into his mouth. He couldn’t taste it, it felt like his entire body had gone numb, like it was on autopilot.
Mycroft wasn’t about to feed him any bullshit, so if he’d been lying to himself that they were in love that lie was about to be shattered, obliterated into tiny, sharp pieces.
Sherlock didn’t reply, but the way he placed his vacant hand on John’s leg told him he understood, or at least he hoped that was the gesture.
John continued to talk as Sherlock made his way about twisting the cube back into the right colour scheme. He was pretty sure that John knew he wasn’t listening, he’d be just as well off talking into the wind, but he didn’t mind, the puzzle wasn’t challenging enough to elicit a need for silence.
“You remember when we went to Diagon Alley? And I said about Sarah?” He replied, tracing patterns into the table, ignoring Greg’s stare, avoiding it even, which was even more concerning.
So, getting hit in the face with a quaffle at quidditch practice was all it took to make him snap completely.
He was angry, it wasn’t difficult to tell, he knew hiding it would be futile, Sherlock always knew when he was lying, knew when he was hiding, knew when everything was fake. He could lie by omission maybe (most likely not) but anything else didn’t fly.
“You should be.” Sherlock deadpanned, and John felt his stomach drop, before Sherlock added more to the sentence. “I was scared out of my mind when you weren’t at the library.”
Sherlock gave a hum of amusement. “Of course it is.” Taking the cup from her as John tucked her back into bed, turning down the brightness of the lamp so there was just enough to keep the room visible.
The Gryffindor landed the moment he noticed Mycroft watching him, touching down and stepping off the broom, running his gloved hands through his hair. “Myc, I'm so sorry I just couldn’t hide it anymore and I get it if you-“
“Where’re we going?” Rosie asked, considering they were walking further away from their flat, instead of going home.
He couldn’t make any sense of it, one minute he was worried sick about the younger boy and the next he was filled with so much anger that he ran his mouth further than he even thought he
This man was the most beautiful man he’d ever laid eyes on. His skin porcelain and pale, eyes sparkling blue and dark curls that framed his face nicely, curling up at the nape of his neck. He wore a dark purple dress shirt and black trousers, and he was staring down at John expectantly.
didn’t you say anything?” John replied, placing his hands on his head, massaging his temples as his head began to pound.
changed when she died. It wasn’t just that she left, Dad lost the plot, Harry moved out, I went to Hogwarts. I miss her loads, but I miss how it all used to be. I miss my dad and my sister, because they’ve changed so much they might as well be completely different people. I’d give anything to see them like that again, to see my mum smile, to watch her drag him up to dance again. Anything, Sherlock.” He was crying, not as hard as before, but his voice was breaking, and his entire body was tense with nerves as he relived it all.
Sherlock didn’t reply, choosing instead to make an indignant noise in the back of his throat and walk over to John, kneeling as he took the needle gently from him. His hands were steady as his fingers hooked the end of the needle, his thumb on the plunger, with the size of his hands he only needed to use one. Despite being embarrassed. John resisted a laugh as he took in the scenario. A lot of people would pay good money to be in this position with Sherlock Holmes on his knees in front of them.
Mycroft frowned, brow creased as he tried to work it out. “Why would you be self-conscious? The grey suited you, it looked nice.” Nice was an understatement, but Mycroft wasn’t sure if calling it endearingly beautiful was a step too far, most likely yes.
“That’s because it isn’t idle conversation, and I quite enjoy it. It began with you comforting me, or at least I think that’s what that was. It worked, by the way.”
“That’s in the basement. I do have an ensuite.” He tossed the paper onto his desk, his hand caught John’s attention, a new burn had been added to the back of his hand.
Greg laughed, suddenly. “god we are some miserable sops, how about a more light-hearted topic then? How’s your family?”
His solution was to avoid people in general, and the interaction wouldn’t have any opportunity to take place.
Greg sighed, pushing himself up and moving so he was sitting with his back against the oak tree, opposite Mycroft who had one knee drawn up to his chest, resting his chin on it. “Name of the potion that brings good fortune?”
Greg squeezed his hand, and shortly after began to rub gentle strokes over Mycroft’s thumb. “That’s fair.”
“I don’t doubt it. I just want to be able to help people.” John replied, shrugging, it was nice to have a civil conversation with someone, he hadn't had anyone to talk to other than Harry when she came round.
They found the Holmes’ and John at one of the pillars when they got to Platform 9 and ¾. Mycroft's parents gave them a courteous smile and a greeting, Sherlock gave a nod to his brother and John gave him a
He’d insisted in Angelo’s that he wasn’t gay, and a plethora of other times since then. Obvious lie, well partially. If he wasn’t he could have easily showed or told the name of his tattoo to prove that he wasn’t gay, nor Sherlock’s date. If he wasn’t he wouldn’t have protested it so harshly.
“No Father, you don’t understand-“ Greg got up quietly, pulling on a pair of boxers pulling on Mycroft's dressing gown as the cold air hit him and he shivered, unsure if it was just the cold or nerves. “You won’t- You can’t!” Greg opened the door, walking slowly. He felt bad for eavesdropping, but he hadn’t been able to stop thinking about the letter he’d found.
He knew Sherlock hadn’t told him. But he knew just as well that Mycroft would’ve known the moment he set foot in the dining room, nevertheless opened his mouth.
“He’s still in confinement.” The Slytherin spoke after a moment of silence. “I don’t think they’ll let him out next year.” He twisted to look at Greg properly, and the Gryffindor’s calm expression dropped the moment he saw the pure stress and frustration in Mycroft's face.
Later on, he saw John Watson meet his karma as the Gryffindor came passed him in the corridors as people headed for lunch. He wouldn’t have thought much of it if it weren’t for the fact that the second-year was walking on his hands, he stopped for a minute to acknowledge Mycroft.
“No… I haven’t, is that inappropriate?” His shoulders dropped, he could clearly hear the mild upset in Greg’s tone, and his mistakes were made clearer to him.
John bit his lip, taking a breath, deciding he wouldn’t lie bare face to his friend but lying by omission couldn’t hurt. “Oh, they’re good, Dad is fine, and Harry’s been sober for a bit, so her and Clara are doing better How’s things on your end?”
Sherlock stared at him at breakfast, studying him as he read through the paper, his eyes scoring through the words as he absorbed the information from the pages, he wasn’t even pining over Sherlock at breakfast like he usually was. Something wasn’t right.
John licked his lips, taking a step back before realising he’d forgotten his cane and stumbling, he gripped the door frame to keep himself upright and tried to will his face not to flush as the man gave him an odd look.
Her wrists and neck showed no sign of a struggle, her shoulders were hunched in a way that would imply anxiety, along with her grip on the books she was carrying, held in front of her stomach, pressed against her torso like she was hiding it. Her mouth was frozen in the scream she’d been caught in.
Holmes’ family Christmas’ didn’t involve much more than both the boys complaining about what they had to wear and eat and say and do, whilst family or esteemed guests paraded their house like they owned it. Sherlock would always ty to hide in his room only to be dragged out by mother, or worse Father. Sometimes Mycroft would realise in time and talk him out of hiding before he was in trouble.
John wasn’t holding his fork the way he used to, he rarely moved his left hand, unlike before where he talked animatedly and gestured with his fork. He seemed to be more timid, and any time Mycroft's father spoke even a tad louder than normal there was a definite flinch in his posture.
He’d woken up from yet another nightmare about his mum, this time it had been a mandrake of all things that killed her.
He wished for that a lot, that he’d wake up and he’d be nine years old and his mum would be alive and well, his sister would still be in the honeymoon phase with Clara, and his dad had never laid a hand on him with ill intent.
He could practically feel his nerves crawling through his blood, sickness dragged in his every thought and each was worse than the last.
Johns head snapped up his eyes filled with surprise and moderate delight. “Do- uh- Do you want to be? M-My boyfriend I mean.”
“Lockie is her name for me.” Sherlock breathed, shocked at the realisation. She had no other equivalent for
John beat Sherlock to the library, much to the first-year’s annoyance he’d been stopped by a group of girls in his History of Magic class on his way there, they wanted to get the homework off him, or copy his own version of the homework. He’d refused them the request, much to their dismay, and pushed past them to get to the library.
“And you’d be lying through your teeth.” Mycroft replied with a smirk. He was a lot of things, arrogant, clever, a smart-ass git, but
“Not too far off. But incorrect.” Sherlock replied, a fond smile written in his features. “Open it.”
“I best call my dad.” Greg spoke after a moment of waiting. The hustle and bustle of students outside on the platform had reminded him of where he was supposed to be. He pulled his phone out of his pocket and tapped the number, holding to his ear and directing his gaze back to the window. “Hi Dad.” A smile drew onto his face as his father replied before he frowned a little, he was ignoring the fact that both John and Mycroft were staring at him, listening to no avail. “No I’m not- I know, I’m sorry but it’s an emergency- I’m going back to the castle with Myc and John- I know we had plans but the pubs will still be open tomorrow- Yes you can still meet him, he’s just as excited as you- Right, thanks Dad, love you too, bye.” He let out a breath as he hung up.
“I kinda just had to jump for it, hurt my wrist pretty badly but Myc fixed it in no time.” Greg spoke he was standing somewhat awkwardly in their kitchen, hands shoved into the pockets of his shorts. “You’d need to ask John about the fall though, that one was all his glory, poor bugger dislocated his shoulder.”

Mycroft gazed at him somewhat pointedly, taking a break from reading. He couldn’t understand how Greg could be so calm, when their exams began in a couple days. Yes, they weren’t the final grades, those would come next year with buckets more stress, but these ones were still important.
He was hanging by the gloved hand of John Watson, and he was holding on for dear life. Because it quite literally depended on it.

His hands rested between his legs as he stared at the wall, willing himself to get up and do something, but he couldn’t make himself.
“I was being serious though.” He gave the elder a pointed glare. “Other than Sherlock, you’re my only friend, I’m gonna miss you.”
Obviously Greg didn’t encourage him breaking the rules, but if something was so vital that he had to swear to secrecy especially in regards to Mycroft, he supposed he could let it slide.
“Lockie? You gonna kiss goodnight?” Rosie asked in the dim lit bedroom. She was still able to make out Sherlock’s lean figure in the darkness.
