They both drift, resting, but John is too aware of Sherlock’s propensity for losing heat too quickly to let himself doze off the way he’d like. He rolls his head side to side to shake away the beginnings of sleep, is just about to suggest they move into the sun to start drying off when he hears it:
“Good morning, Sherlock,” John says dryly. Sherlock’s hips are still flush against his thigh, and dark curls are still occupying almost half of John’s field of vision. “Sleep well?” he asks mildly.
“We should get home,” Sherlock says upon stepping out of the office. His expression is shuttered, but John is (now quantifiably) attuned to Sherlock: his set jaw and stiff shoulders belie irritation at least, if not outright anger.
“A solution for boredom,” Sherlock murmurs. He doesn’t explain that it was long ago, because he knows the scars do that for him.
“Sherlock –” John pulls him down into a kiss, tucking his tentacles around him to help keep him warm.
Sherlock’s plate is mostly empty, picked over for the seafood morsels. John’s eaten as much as he wants to tonight.
“– This?” John gets his hands up inside that open shirt, drags his hands down Sherlock’s back and ribs, letting the hungry palms of his hands feast on Sherlock’s skin, his heat, the braille of his gooseflesh.
“Smoke inhalation is responsible for more fire-related deaths than burns – surely I don’t have to tell you that?” Finally, the cold seems to get to the man – his skin has peaked into bumps, and he wraps his arms around his shoulders and shivers delicately. He curls in on himself even more, and it lends him the air of someone much younger, and much less sure of himself.
With that thought echoing around his mind, John, arms still full of Sherlock, decides to stop trying to force an answer. Instead, he takes his time waking up, thinking it certainly won’t hurt his attempt to get to the heart of this new development – and it’s in that gradual shift, that stretched liminal space between asleep and awake, where the truth begins to spread out, as if it, too, is uncurling from dormancy, stretching languid and undeniable.
“Quite rich, for sand,” Sherlock says, mercurial eyes fixed on his fingers. “Organic matter – decayed vegetation – the marshes must start just over that rise.” He points beyond the gentle slope of the sand, and sure enough, the colour of the sand browns into a reddish brown clay, and when the wind shifts for a moment, the dense, borderline rank smell of a salt marsh is unmistakable.
Sherlock clears his throat and holds up his card – which is almost completely covered with writing. The space that does not contain words contains a neatly labeled pie chart. John rolls his eyes and covers his mouth, hiding a grin that’s threatening to be more fond than is called for. The card reads:
“You are not incorrect on that count. Um. I’ll just –” Sherlock shifts his weight, and John can feel him start to pull away, slip away in every sense of the word.
“Or the sofa, at least,” Sherlock adds in, as if it’s a grand concession. As if he’s not the one who tackled John to the floor when there were perfectly functional cushioned surfaces nearby.
Sherlock shakes his head, and moves back a little – to shrug off his coat and place it high up on a ledge formed by the rocks framing their little grotto, sighing at the now dripping lower hem of it. “Phone?” he asks John, and John shakes his head.
“Yeah, that – there’s no drive for it – at least, no more than usual when I see you like this,” John tries to lighten the atmosphere again, but Sherlock’s gaze remains a pressing weight upon him.
“That – that can’t be comfortable,” John points out. Sherlock normally has one or two good orgasms in him, and then any other touch becomes too much.
Sherlock shifts closer, careful not to jostle his hand against John too much, and John lays his left hand in the dip of Sherlock’s waist, under his vest. After a moment, John trails his own finger tips down, southward. Sherlock makes a pleased little sound, his hips hitching to make it easier for John to explore.
John just grins, and holds him close, and after a spell, they pull apart. They’re busy just looking at each other when Sherlock’s stomach rumbles.
“John –” he breaks off to cry out as John bites into the muscle where his neck and shoulder meet. His back arches and is breath comes in little sips, and then his hands are pulling at John’s clothing. “John, the – the sex question,” Sherlock pants. “I lied. I – I lied. I do – I do – for you – I want –”
“I should have told you ages ago. That I loved you. Right when it first happened – and I didn’t. I was such an idiot.”
“Sounds like a lesson worth remembering,” Carlton says with a wink at the audience, and John doesn’t miss the way Sherlock’s eyes narrow at that.
“No!” Sherlock answers, an over-quick bark of an answer. He visibly reins himself in. “No, I – I just. No.” He shifts his weight from foot to foot a bit before he says, “This is your home as much as mine, and therefor the phrase ‘you are welcome here’ is a bad fit, but –”
John comes with a shout, hoarse, buries himself deep and stills as his cock pulses. He can feel the wetness of his come, the silky slick of it as it spills inside, and it seems Sherlock can feel it too, his breathy cries echoing John’s release.
–!” Sherlock’s body rocks with each thrust, his pelvis jerking arrhythmically until John’s ventral tentacles shift to guide it in cadence and direction, pressing it firmly back into John’s advances. Sherlock makes a high pitched noise then, arms scrambling for a hold on John’s shoulders, his legs starting to shake.
“You’re – you’re sure?” Sherlock asks again, and there’s the disbelief again, serrating the edges of his words, and John won’t have it, can’t let Sherlock cut into himself like that.
–” John curls his fingers around Sherlock’s waist, right above the hip bones, and just breathes, tries not to give in and rut mindlessly into the writhing coil of Sherlock’s heat, body, desire.
His tapered tentacle, seated deeply inside Sherlock once more, begins a slow, back and forth jigging, the barest approximation of thrusting – but even that small amount of motion translates into a breathless cry for Sherlock and a tight grunt for John as transferred motion results in Sherlock shoving into him.
And somewhere inside John, where up and down and compass roses make their nests, is part of John that knows where home is, and how long it will take to get there.
John is impossible to read, because he shows so much, and how is one person supposed to understand all of it at once?
John had finished his shopping, bemused by his lanky shadow, and had led the way to the tills, choosing the shortest route – only to have Sherlock stop in the middle of an aisle.
John’s never done this – he didn’t have the desire when he lived among his own kind, didn’t have the means until now, and
“Me, too.” It’s a whisper, but he knows John hears because John stills his breathing, waiting – waiting? –
“Like that?” Stupid question, obvious answer, and John expects Sherlock to scoff, but what he gets is:
Mrs. Hudson’s lights are already out when they arrive, so they keep quiet as they mount the seventeen steps up to 221B.
–” the aftershocks punch through John, potent echoes of that first tip into pleasure, an exquisite excess, and Sherlock is still on top of him, shuddering as John comes undone beneath him, expression dazed, smelling of sweat and sex and
“Then yes, just like that.” John lets his hand curl carefully against Sherlock’s waist, tries to read if his touch is welcome or not.
He looks up then – to ask, maybe, to see Sherlock’s face – and finds that Sherlock is looking down at him, lips parted just a little. It gives him look of wonder, as if he’s found the shock John misplaced.
“Just a beach,” John reiterates, and Sherlock shuts his mouth with a snap, looking sheepish. “It’s alright, Sherlock – I’m not upset about being here. Really. I’m actually still sort of bowled over that you even found it – and don’t tell me it was easy, I’ve been here before and I’m not sure I could have found my way back to this exact spot.” John’s mouth hitches up into a sideways grin.
. They hadn’t really set out to do well in this competition – this was just about getting Sherlock a front row seat to observe Carlton after all – but the results so far are undeniable.
He gets his legs up between one thrust and the next, heels digging into John’s lower back as he locks his ankles, and that’s it – John can feel the difference from one moment to the next, the punch of Sherlock’s breath, the clench of his muscles, and then –
Sherlock is gasping after the first few thrusts, pelvis jerking up to meet John’s thrusts, hands full of bed sheets then John’s back, his shoulders, his hair, the pillows, the headboard.
John sighs at that touch, that invitation, and licks deeper into Sherlock’s mouth, chasing his tongue back across the threshold, and then retreating, drawing Sherlock into his mouth, and when Sherlock follows with a whimper, John has to pull back and breathe for a moment.
John grins at the bluster, but then a jolt of – not nerves, exactly, but something closer to anticipation – flashes through John as Sherlock begins to remove his pants as well.
Before long, John finds himself lying almost all the way back, Sherlock over him on elbows and knees, shaking and swaying as shallow waves and John’s flesh have their way with him, relentless, claiming –
Sherlock shakes his head. “No, I don’t mean me – or humans or whatever,” Sherlock says with a flap of his hand. “I mean – did any of
Sherlock watches John’s face for a long time, really looking for the first time since John woke up, it seems – and perhaps he’d been afraid of what he might see there, but now that he’s looking, John can see the tightness leave his jaw and the corners of his eyes, as if a blow he’d been expecting had vanished, evaporated.
John just manages to keep from snorting. There’s so much that they quibble about each day – proper safety procedures, the correct way to respond to minor crises and major traumas, how one does
“This. Here. That I brought you.” Sherlock looks down at his hands clasped in front of him, and John doesn’t miss how they’re keeping each other steady, still.
smell. It’s intoxicating, and John has been studiously avoiding it, but he can’t shift away now it’s so near. Now Sherlock’s so near.
“It’s called ‘trading,’” he says at last, “but it just means letting go of your water – your home water,” he clarifies. “That’s when you let the sun and the land and the wind bake it away. It distills you into human form, and it means you can’t ever really go home – but then again when I did it, I never thought I’d want to go home. Still don’t. Never felt like much of a home, anyway.” He tries for a smile, feels its ache, and stops trying. “Oh, and you can forget about me showing you my other form, first off because you’d only want to take samples, and second because I can’t, it won’t work without my home water. So you can put those big eyes and pouting lip away, don’t bother.”
Carlton pauses, beaming at the audience, who finish their clapping and settle down into a hush. “Everyone ready?”
“You don’t like it.” Sherlock’s voice is a tight blankness layered over something that wants to be the opposite.
With so much focus diverted towards controlling his own thoughts, it takes a moment for Sherlock to hear, to process. Another moment later he squeezes his eyes shut. “You can’t just say that,” Sherlock says softly, fiercely. “You can’t just
Sherlock is suddenly and acutely aware that he cannot control how this goes, how this – encounter? – ends – and end it must – and what then?
John is somehow closer, crouching by the sofa, concern and confusion colouring his face a familiar shade of caring. “Sherlock?” A question, (never an offer). “Why wouldn’t I come back?”
Every touch seems to writhe through Sherlock, arching his spine, angling his pelvis, and with Sherlock on top and grinding down against him, John finds he’s in much the same state: frantic and wanting, pushing up against Sherlock’s body, pushing up into the next kiss, and the next, and the next.
“No,” John says, and his hand shifts to rest his fingertips on the top of Sherlock’s wrist, mostly without consulting him first. “Get the table, it’ll be –”
“Ah – something sweet at home?” Angelo asks, and John hopes the redness creeping up his neck can be blamed on the wine.
“Because of the stitching – or should I say ‘stitches’ – you used in mending the cuff of your robe.” The man shrugs. “Also the couple that owns that flat are finishing their studies soon – virology and pediatrics – and it makes sense they would have in their circle of acquaintances a colleague of whom to ask a favour.”
“A few minutes,” Sherlock murmurs. He presses his lips together, looks down at his glass, at the fireplace, out the window.
"Your periodic table?" John could ask - and why not? John’s smarter than half of Scotland Yard put together. John would continue to survey the room and then say: "God, Sherlock, I’m sorry."
John gets up, fetches a cup of water, drinks it down in a few swallows. He pulls stale oxygen from the water, but it soothes his aching gills even as the water pools in his belly and cools him, just a bit. He feels calmer, but also knows his hand won’t tremble now.
Sherlock huffs a solitary laugh, and John doesn’t point out that it doesn’t quite sound like a laugh. It’s a bit too damp, but John’s throat’s a bit achy right now, so the less said the better.
“Hhhm,” Sherlock breathes into the hollow of John’s neck, the vibrations rattling John’s grip on the situation delightfully. “Mm,” Sherlock adds, rocking his head slightly, his far-slung arm grasping at John’s side, like a cat indulgently kneading a plush throw.
“How?” Sherlock asks, breathless, and John wants to put the breath back in him just so he can take it away again. “How – how
“We should get going,” John says, guiding them both to standing. “These will take a while to settle dormant again,” John says with a sigh, shrugging his tentacles.
“Oh, that’s –” Sherlock’s eyes open, and he takes another taste, and John can see the flush spread down Sherlock’s throat and chest. His eyes are dark, a little unfocused. “
’ from that posh mouth, he pushes home and grinds his pelvis against Sherlock, deep and dirty friction, unrelenting.
Sherlock can feel his internal walls flutter, gives a hoarse groan as John’s finger slides out, tries to keep breathing as two fingers push in, swells with a strange sense of pride that he didn’t fight John on the entry this time. He tries to keep from grinning at that, can’t, turns his head away – what will John think? – but then John shifts and is kissing him, and the kiss feels different, and Sherlock finally sees that it’s because John is grinning right back at him, even though they’re kissing and he has two fingers up Sherlock’s arse.
The whiskey John’s been sipping as he waits is a poor substitute for a certain lanky detective. In fact, what with the noise and the crush and the bizarre empty feeling beside him, John doesn’t think the whiskey’s helping at all.
“It – it is,” Sherlock’s breath hitches as the tentacle skirts where his cock is slowly hardening again, dips down to trail a light touch along his scrotum and perineum. “Unless you don’t want to –?” Sherlock says in a rush, and John brings their bodies close together again with a tightening curl of his other three tentacles.
are suddenly all John can see, those hands all he can feel. Sherlock always purses his lips as he plays the violin, fingers dancing through arpeggios, hips swaying his body through the grander swells and cascades of music.
It isn’t until Sherlock speaks that John knows everything will be fine, though, because the daft sod opens his mouth and says, without looking away from his screen:
“Tiramisu goes with everything, and everything goes with tiramisu. That’s because it isn’t a dessert – it’s a blessing. Here.” He hands Sherlock their boxed leftovers. “You carry these, and John –” he takes the box Billy brings over, and holds it for John to take, “you take care of this. And since it’s a red: wine first, then the tiramisu, yes? Good. Good!” He beams at them, and John manages to squeeze a thank you through Angelo’s exuberant goodbye before he follows Sherlock out. The door shuts on the tail end of a loud ‘Good night!’
“Good.” John puts down his wine glass, and Sherlock blinks in surprise – three blinks in rapid succession – and then John takes Sherlock’s from his unresisting fingers and sets it on the mantle.
“Mhm?” Sherlock hums, nose pressed into John’s neck, his eyelashes giving a single flutter against thin skin.
John huffs out a laugh. “That’s good.” He waits for a moment then adds, teasingly: “I did as well, thanks for asking.”
Carlton saunters up to John and Sherlock, a smug grin on his face. “Alright, gents: who makes better tea?” Obviously he’s had enough of their ‘good luck’ streak.
” Sherlock’s whole body jolts when John’s tentacle tip dips into him, just breaching the furl, a quick lick and retreat.
“Sherlock Holmes,” the madman says, extending a hand. His fingers wrap comfortably around John’s as he takes the offered hand and shakes.
“I am,” he says, and then he lurches forward and John pulls him close, and their mouths meet, hard and hot and hungry.
. John flashes a grin through his goodbyes. He’s old enough to leave and doing so, thank you very much.
Sherlock, on the other hand, simply says: “Your pulse is extremely elevated for what should be a resting heart rate, John.”
It would have to be night in reality, when everyone else was asleep, but this is his mind, his fantasy, and he wants sunlight through the windows, gold and warm and not-at-all-
“Of course I’ll still want you. I wanted you before my Tide showed up, I was just too stupid to act on it. Too worried you’d catch on and run off.”
And then the audience goes ‘awwwwwww’ in that cooing manner of currently entertained and momentarily besotted people everywhere, and Sherlock levels a look of such blatant confusion at that response that John has to intervene before his ‘husband’ can say what he just opened his mouth to say.
Sherlock’s eyes widen in understanding. “Now?” he asks, and John nods. He slides a ventral tentacle along Sherlock’s arm, demonstrating its slickness, before letting it dip down to prepare himself for Sherlock, who can only watch, gaping, his own stimulation seemingly forgotten. “John,” he rasps as John squirms at his own touch.
John huffs, can’t help the little grin, so he looks down, away, but when he looks up again he knows Sherlock saw, because he’s mirroring one right back at John, hopeful and cheeky all at once.
John, for his part, can barely spare thought to breathe, never mind make any noise himself. Sherlock is hot and heavy in his mouth, a puzzle piece slotting home, and John can’t stop touching and stroking what skin he can find, his own nerve endings ablaze with sensation – skin and salt and the swirling waves, the sand and pebbles shifting beneath his feet and knees, Sherlock’s fingers tangling with the breeze in his hair, the smell and feel of his skin like sun-blanched driftwood, and everything about him, about this moment, is a heady elixir, one John intends to drink down, to drown in.
“Dance,” Sherlock clarifies – or is it commands? John’s whiskey glass is more than half empty in his hand, and Sherlock reaches out to take it. John watches as Sherlock throws back the last swallow of amber liquid before placing the glass neatly back on the bar. “Dance with me.”
John looks over his shoulder and sees Sherlock staring at the pasta boxes all over the counter and floor. There is a lively light in his eyes, and a bit of a flush on his cheeks from rushing up the stairs. His lips quirk into an amused slant.
Somehow, that calm observation tips John over, and suddenly his tentacle is swelling, stiffening, emptying itself to fill Sherlock –
John takes a moment to shimmy out of his remaining clothes as well as grabbing the last of Sherlock’s and then pushes everything off the side of the bed, not caring one whit for wrinkles. When he looks up from his task, Sherlock’s eyes are on him, already. Those lips are parted and swollen, those cheekbones flushed with red. Sherlock’s eyes are thin rings of crystal around endless pools of black.
Sherlock snorts, not lifting a finger to help. “Mean this. This,” he repeats, as if that clarifies anything.
John gets a leg around and over Sherlock’s as they both continue to press and push. “You – you’re asking me that –
John’s breath hitches and then stumbles into a laugh, and Sherlock’s looking down at him, half indignant, half amused, his mouth a wry twist, his eyebrow an unimpressed arch. God help him though, Sherlock’s combination of hesitation and decisiveness will always be John’s undoing – Sherlock is so confident in every other facet of his life, of their lives, that in this one area where uncertainty still crops up, his brazen bluffing is endearingly obvious, disarmingly tender and sweet, and John has absolutely no defenses against its charms.
As their fervour subsides, John rolls off to lie beside Sherlock. He ends up on his back, with Sherlock’s head tucked up on his scarred shoulder, Sherlock’s finger drifting in spirals over John’s sternum, almost tickling as it moves through his chest hair.
“I know,” John answers, just as softly. “I’m not just saying it.” His hands are warm where they seek to touch and comfort, leave coolness where they hesitate to land. “Sherlock –”
“Yes,” Sherlock says a moment later, and John nuzzles closer. He turns the cloth so a clean side is ready for Sherlock’s skin – but first, he gets his mouth right against Sherlock’s perineum and kisses him. The smell – sex layered over Sherlock’s musk – is heady, and John inhales deeply. “Oh,” Sherlock says weakly, and John reaches up to check – yes: aroused again, erect again.
Sherlock wonders what the absorption rate of semen is where the tissues of the anus and rectum are concerned.
Above him, John stills, eyes blown dark despite the light pouring in through the windows, and oh god, Sherlock never thought to imagine that John could look like this, look at
,” he says, and there’s a desperation to his voice, a sort of hushed urgency, as if he’s questioning his motives, or his execution, or everything all at once.
, he realises. He feels cherished. “Sherlock,” he says, not knowing if there’s an end to that sentence.
When he returns home, the elders warn him not to go back, not to let the sun take his water, but their words only serve to pull his thoughts into this new and tantalizing stream, an irresistible current of want.
“I’m going to say it,” John says into the sweat of Sherlock’s hairline, right where his ear meets his jaw. He isn’t laughing anymore. The light inside him is thick, golden. Molten ore, ready to be shaped.
John gapes at him. “How could you possibly know that – I haven’t gotten tested since last Christmas –”
It isn’t until later that evening, when John is having a cup of tea while he reads and Sherlock is sprawled on the sofa, laptop open on his chest, bathing his face in white light, that they speak again. Sherlock hadn’t texted since their morning chat, and John hadn’t wanted to intrude, still feeling a bit uncertain of this new knowledge between them, this new sharing.
John’s hands shift lower, find Sherlock’s hips, the crease of his thigh. Sherlock jerks at the light touch, then shifts closer, and John can feel the heat radiating from him, feel it increase. It makes John dizzy with want.
“Getting you dry so you don’t get sick is not ‘being an idiot,’” John counters when he thinks his voice will be steady.
– and then his throat gills take over with a stretch and flutter, quivering with the strong pulls of water he takes while he recovers from the surprise and the breathing mishap.
Sherlock clears his throat. “John…surely you must have known we were close?” he asks, then falls silent, his words run out at last, and John looks back just in time to see doubt flit minnow-fast across Sherlock’s features.
John cries out, back arching, burying himself inside Sherlock’s still-trembling body, and comes. His hips stutter back into motion a moment later, and god it’s glorious – silky slick and wet, John’s come inside Sherlock, and outside, too, after a few good thrusts, every movement wetter than the last.
Sherlock lets his thoughts rush ahead, and now they are naked, skin against glorious, glowing skin, and the nursery is bigger and brighter than he ever thought it was, with John pressed up against him, hard and willing and wanting.
“John – yes.” Sherlock tries to move his hips, and it’s clumsy, but oh god how he wants this, this, John, John here and now and inside him – “
John purses his lips. “A way to see the world – and to get some excitement at last. Current events weren’t all that thrilling.”
John wheezes and slumps back as their laughter winds down. His spine protests its sudden re-acquaintance with the wood floor. “You may have a point.” He grins. “Got carried away a bit, though, didn’t we?”
With a soft, guiding pressure, John brings Sherlock down into a kiss, a touch of lips becoming a firm press, warm and gentle. After a long moment, John’s tongue comes forward for a taste, just a flick against Sherlock’s mouth, which parts, and then John’s tongue is back, licking along that parting, which widens, and then there – the kiss of wet heat from Sherlock’s tongue, a shy copy of John’s movements.
Sherlock looked back out of the window and sipped his coffee slowly. It was like they were having a conversation about the weather.
For once, just John had a case; a unusual case all by himself. Unfortunately though, it was a case of writer’s block. Usually, the writing up of their most recent case for the blog was almost an easy pleasure, a form of mindful therapy in choosing the right words and expressing himself. With his dictionary, thesaurus and google by his side, and making sure to add a bit of humour or drama where necessary to make it more interesting, the writing usually came easily - and if it didn't, he would wait a while and come back to it when he'd had a bit of a think, and then it would - but writing up this case was proving annoyingly difficult. He read back through the last few sentences he’d written and then deleted them in disgust. What really wasn’t helping his state of mind much either was that he was still really pissed off about what had happened earlier that morning.
After a moment, where they eyed each other on the edge of a precipice, Sherlock said in a confessional tone, “I happen to quite like it when you tell me what to do."
‘It is what it is,' thought Sherlock, ecstatic, euphoric, his heart full to bursting as John kissed him.
and Sherlock had despaired, and had to talk to Lestrade and be clever in front of John and explain that obviously it was death caused by lightning, specifically a cardiac arrest caused by splash lightning to the victim as the lightning strike had hit the tree while the victim was up it. Sherlock predicted (correctly) that the victim would display the characteristic Lichtenberg figures ("commonly known as 'lightning flowers’”) on the chest and neck where skin capillaries ruptured due to the electrical discharge, and he then indicated the places where the bark had been blown off the trunk of the tree, where the sap vaporised as the current found its way to the ground. Then he had started asking the many dog walkers and runners who were conveniently milling about nearby, and all pretending not to notice the crime scene tape, if they had seen anything, and one who was walking past said helpfully that she thought she had seen a lightning strike hit somewhere in the park from her bedroom window, very early that morning, during the storm,
“Oh, lovely! Very useful for writing down all your secrets!" Agatha brayed at him, waving her glass.
On the narrow confines of the sofa, John did as he was bid. He kissed Sherlock; on his mouth, on his neck, on his chest and eventually, John slid down on to the floor on one knee to be able to reach his stomach. He kissed Sherlock, licked him, bit him, everywhere he he reach, he caressed it with his mouth. And Sherlock, the most emotionally contained person that John had ever met - except perhaps for himself - let himself be lost to John. He let John take him over, because it was so clearly what John needed to do at that moment, and who was Sherlock to stop him? 'Plenty of time to reverse the roles later,' he thought, once, briefly, when thinking was still a viable option. And then thinking went somewhere else and he could only feel John’s lips and mouth and hands on his body, and respond to him without thought. Suddenly, John stopped what he was doing, which at that moment involved tracing hot promises on Sherlock's neck with his tongue and teeth, and he drew back to look into Sherlock's eyes. The moment he did so he knew what he wanted next. “I want more than this,” he said simply, hungrily.
“Is this an experiment?” John asks. His left hand can’t quite decide between clenching at his side and lifting to seek a hold. John tries to still it as he asks, “Or is this you taking a risk?”
Carlton starts with the other two couples (outdoor sex, sex in public, dressing up, light bondage) and then saunters over to John and Sherlock’s little booth. “And what of team Watson, eh?” Carlton’s eyebrows jump up and down a few times for effect, and John tries not to look at Sherlock.
John blinks and comes back to himself, tearing his eyes from Sherlock’s profile to look at Carlton, who gives him a cheery smile. John swallows nervously.
…On the other hand, since he has to wait, that means he has time - and it’s been a while since he’s indulged, and - well - if everything goes well this afternoon, it won’t matter. And if everything goes
“Ye-e-es,” John says, stopping to face the man again, “inside. I’m not leaving you out here to shiver all night.”
“Perfect,” John says. He feels like beaming, but he’s not sure how Sherlock will take it, so he tucks his face towards the shelves and fusses with the boxes until he has his face under control. “Take out or…?”
Sherlock cries out, voice a high rasp as he comes, his eyes closed tight, his head thrown back, arms about John’s shoulders. “I – I – oh god,
With a bit of a twist, they get their mouths together again, breathing hard and fast as they share that touch, pass sensation back and forth with lips and tongues – and then teeth as Sherlock’s lower teeth scrape John’s chin, spurring him to gently take and taste Sherlock’s plump lower lip.
John scrapes his teeth in an almost bite against Sherlock’s chin, then huffs a laugh and gets up. His bare feet are cold against the wood floor, and his muscles are tired in a wholly delightful way.
“They’re not singing words – it’s like choir scales. They’re greeting the day – the world – anyone who might be listening.”
And besides, there are so many things John wants to say that don’t involve words, but skin: palms, and hips – tongues, teeth, and lips, just the slow slide of skin, of touch. A carnal conversation.
shirt,” he points out, and Sherlock huffs out a breath, letting his hands rest on John’s biceps. “So I decided to take pity on these buttons,” John teases, and Sherlock smacks his hand away.
“Do you have –?” John asks, and Sherlock makes an unintelligible noise, trying to answer without removing his mouth from John’s earlobe, which,
“I want to,” John says, kissing up along Sherlock’s neck. His own cock is stiff and aching between his legs, brushing up against Sherlock’s skin or his own tentacles as they shift, and each time is brighter, sweeter than the last, layers of sensation building up.
“What does the mate have to do?” Sherlock asks, and he’s crouching by the edge of the tub, so close, and his scent wafts over John, and he wants desperately to pull water into his throat, into his cells, that carries that smell. Sand and sun and bleached driftwood. Old bones, new water.
Sherlock’s tone isn’t accusatory in the least – nevertheless, regret and guilt lance through John, sour as vinegar. “I was afraid,” John says. It hurts to say, to admit. He feels the words like a shadow. He swallows, and his mouth turns hard for a moment, a spike of shame becoming anger at himself, at time wasted. He looks down, cannot meet Sherlock’s eyes in the unfolding quiet, until –
“Oh god, Sherlock, oh god you’re so hot inside –” John breaks off in a hiss, head tilting back as he tries to parse the slew of sensations radiating up his dorsal tentacle: heat, pressure, friction, a flickering heart beat thrumming high.
John’s eyes snap open as the chime begins, and he barely has a moment to scribble a one word answer and toss his pen aside.
“John and Sherlock Watson, married two months now, and just back from their honeymoon in the South of France – how was it lads?”
“Thanks.” John raises his eyebrows as he puts on a worldly air: “I like to think I know my way around a beach.”
“You know what I was thinking about?” John asks, circling his middle finger around and around without pushing to the center, without pushing in. “When I woke you?”
“I should check for sand,” Sherlock teases, but doesn’t delay – he runs his thumb along the slick-coated skin, and when nothing abrades that touch, he hoists John’s lower body into his lap, a more difficult feat now that John’s water-logged tentacles have added themselves to the equation.
“Umm.” It’s the sound of someone who is aware there are no towels in the bathroom, the sound of someone who is responsible for there being no towels in the bathroom. The silence that follows that sound implies that this certain someone will take the story of their involvement to the grave.
In a flash he's back, transported to one of the rare days Before when Sherlock had joined him in the weekly run to Tesco's. He'd followed John around, seemingly lost in thought, but every time John had thought he'd lost him, he'd turn around and there Sherlock was, absorbed in his phone, or in the ingredients list on a tin of canned asparagus, or the warning label on a box of multi-surface cleaner.
“It was,” John says, and his voice is serious, but he’s filled with a tight joy, just waiting to burst. He scoops his arms around Sherlock and holds him.
And of course, there’s something John had never really expected to see: Sherlock’s penis, soft now, and mostly clean after getting off with John. John is in a not dissimilar state.
Sherlock grunts and stiffens as two fingers push into him, but John keeps on with his mouth on his nipple, splays his clean hand against Sherlock’s back and keeps him close and still as he strokes in and out, searches –
The want creeps in slowly, inexorably, soaking into his skin like wavelets into too-long dry sand, and if asked what day the Tide turned and began its advance, John would be hard pressed to answer.
“John – I –” Sherlock collapses against John’s chest and quivers, twitching as John’s tentacle finishes with him and withdraws, trailing thick strands of slick. “Oh god – John, that was –”
London is a spring gray, flashing past in concrete and unexpected flashes of pale green as John watches. The sun is setting later now that summer is approaching, but it will be dark by the time they reach home.
Sherlock’s mouth drifts open at the suggestion, as if the words themselves are a presence against his lips. “John,” he whispers, the distance between them diminishing to a humid moment of breath and nerves –
- will?) feel like inside him, only knows his own fingers’ fullness, but that’s enough to theorize. He wants that stretch, that burn, that deep and hungry ache, that fade from pain to pleasure - and he wants it from John.
His voice keens out of him in thin ribbons and tattered gasps, a tapestry of sounds unravelling with each touch from John’s hand and fingers and lips and –
,” Sherlock says, and there’s a note of warning and eye-rolling impatience and pleading in there all at once.
John smiles softly. “It’s enough to know they’re still out there. They have what the need. And well – I have you.” Sherlock huffs a laugh, but John can see the pleased smugness tucked away in the discreet corners of his mouth and eyes.
“God, you are so –” John interrupts himself with a scrape of teeth against Sherlock’s neck, “– responsive,” John finishes in a murmur against Sherlock’s pulse. “I want to kiss you all over.” His fingers relax, comb through the curls they’ve just crushed, luxuriate in the soft and thick tangle of Sherlock’s hair. “Want to taste you everywhere,” he says, breathing in deep right at Sherlock’s hairline. “Oh god –”
Sherlock clears his throat delicately, otherwise remaining motionless. “John,” he says at length. “Good morning.” It sounds painstakingly normal.
“Then – how –” but Sherlock closes his eyes before finishing the question. He takes a deep, shuddering breath. “It’s the water here,” he says, and there a resigned hollowness to his voice that slices along John’s jaw and throat. “It’s what’s missing at Baker Street, what I can’t –” he swallows.
John takes a deep breath, feeling unaccountably light and optimistic – even though he knows that can’t possibly last.
“Right.” Dessert in bed sounds grand, actually. “Shall we, then?” John reaches over, grabs the box, only just then realising he’d forgotten to grab utensils – but then, inside, next to the oversized slice of tiramisu, is one takeaway fork, courtesy of Angelo. John holds it up for Sherlock to see. They quirk matching lopsided smiles at one another, but say nothing of it.
“Well now,” Carlton starts, retaking the stage, “it seems we need to really stir up some trouble. Can’t have all this harmony and communication – it makes for terribly dull watching.” He winks as he pauses for a moment. “Are you ready, ladies and gentlemen? Ready for The Question that wrecks homes and relationships and tears whole families apart?” Carlton infuses each syllable with enough drama to shame day-time soaps. The audience holds its breath.
“Don’t be an idiot, John,” Sherlock scoffs, then turns and fiddles with something on the counter behind him. “Of course I don’t ‘mind,’” he says, and it’s low and not at all as brash as John would have expected.
Sherlock huffs at the intrusion, but there’s a smile tucked into the curl of his lips, and John can’t help but shake his head and smile as well. He lifts his answer card to show his answer:
“Could it be intended for you?” Sherlock wants to know. “Could they have heard – or sensed – us, just now?”
And here it is, unopened, un-imbibed, and – going by the layer of dust – untouched after all this time. What purpose had this wine been bought for, what purpose had then been shelved and forgotten right along with this bottle?
Waves punctuate the silence that follows, and Sherlock bites at his lip for a bit. “Would you like to leave?” Sherlock asks at last, and John is gratified to see the consideration in those storm-swell eyes, and the concern. “We don’t have to stay –”
The sun is hot and thirsty, the air is pungent with the smell of soil and plant growth, and in the distance, coming closer, John can hear laughter. John watches the humans from a nearby tide pool, sees them run and play, unencumbered by tentacles, unbothered by the sun, unfettered by the water.
John blinks and clears his throat. “I…it’s unexpected,” he starts, then stops. He decides on bluntness, despite the usual, diminishing effect that has on Sherlock’s ability to refrain from rolling his eyes. “I don’t understand,” he says, and awaits the scornful explanation with a resigned sigh.
Sherlock’s mouth falls open as his eyes close. “Better than I expected. More.” He’s panting, and the sound of that lands like coals inside John’s skin. His distraction fans them to a blaze, but he needs to know, so he asks:
The stage lights are bright, and John feels odd in the suit Sherlock had laid out for him for the event. It’s a bit closer cut than he normally goes for in formal wear, the colour a touch more vibrant: an almost jewel tone of navy, a sort of electric dark blue that he would never have picked out for himself – but so far, so good. His grey three piece suit wouldn’t have done at all; there’s no way John would have looked as if he belonged beside Sherlock, who is predictably striking in black. It is a sumptuous, velvety black that seems to drink in light rather than giving it off like John’s suit does.
He hasn't thought about that day in quite some time. The case, the Woman – events had conspired to keep them busy, keep them running. And then After there'd been no reason to, and plenty of reason not to.
Eventually they pull apart, and they both heave sighs, almost at the same time, deep come-down breaths. They catch each other’s eye, and John cracks first, grinning, and Sherlock snorts at that, which sets John giggling, high and breathless, and then they’re both laughing, shoulders shaking with it.
“About – about this – with me?” Sherlock shudders, not slowing, question ending in a whine as John twists his pelvis to slide their erections past each other again. Even with two layers of pants in the way, even with the friction just this side of too much, it’s a glorious glow of sliding pressure, and Christ – what had Sherlock asked again?
Sherlock’s hands are warm when and where they land on John, guiding and holding, and Sherlock’s waist is firm and inviting when John’s hands find their way there. It doesn’t take too long for them to wend their way lower, to the jut and sway of Sherlock’s hipbones, the swell of his arse beneath fine wool trousers.
“What?” he asks, and god his voice sounds strange, caught exactly halfway between irritated and relieved.
Sherlock shakes his head, does what he can to smother the choked sound trying to escape his throat, reaches up and does what he can to stop the words in John’s mouth with his once more, because if he hears much more he’ll be shaken, rattled to pieces by those words in that voice, and he can’t yet, he can’t.
At last John pulls out, hand still slippery slick, and he takes a hold of himself and strokes himself wet and ready.
The twinned sensations of hot suction and slick pressure are almost too much, a jumbling, bewildering array of input, and Sherlock gives a shocked cry as his hips try to push up and grind down all at once, and in the aftermath of that confused clench he feels the muscles of his abdomen relax in release, feels his Pubococcogeus muscles flex –
, Sherlock thinks. He takes a steadying breath, and is momentarily proud that it’s more-or-less even on the way in.
John licks a stripe up his cock, and Sherlock quivers at the run of sensation it scatters through his body: his nipples peak, his cock twitches, his lower abdominals clench, causing him to tighten around John’s finger – oh god – and that, that, that repeats everything, nipples to cock to rectum to –
,” Sherlock breathes, lips dragging against John’s, breathing still ragged, thighs shifting to rub against John’s legs. “Oh god, John. That was –”
John blinks. “You –” he glances about for eavesdroppers, swallows the rest of his shout, and ends in a furious whisper, “
John’s first instinct is to jump in, to cut the moment with humour – but he doesn’t. He’s learning to speak when he would have kept silent, learning to wait when he would have blundered forward. It feels like a balancing act above an unending unknown.
When Sherlock’s final shivers switch into over-sensitised twitches, John pulls off, whispers, “Shh, come down here, right here, yes –” as Sherlock folds into a boneless heap in John’s lap. His limbs are shaking and his head is buried against John’s neck once more.
“John, the show is set up to reward teamwork – wouldn’t you say we’ve survived worse than a few nosy questions with nothing and no one but each other?”
“I thought I was being obvious.” John’s hands are warm on his neck and arm, the thumbs smoothing circles into his skin. “It has to be obvious now, Sherlock. You have to know.”
Sherlock lifts off John and flops onto his side, twitching and pliant, and John arranges him as he looks on in a daze. “John,” he murmurs, sounding almost drunk, almost drugged with arousal. “I –
John peels his eyelids apart and lifts his head from where it had settled between the car’s headrest and the rattling window with a groan. It takes him a moment to realise that the window isn’t rattling anymore, and then he nearly pitches out headfirst when Sherlock opens his door without warning.
Never had they mentioned he might find the other sides of those darknesses – adventure, companionship, purpose – and now this: his friend, his mate, his Sherlock, and by the smell and feel and taste of him, his home.
“Ah,” John says, suddenly a whole lot more present. He shakes his head to try and clear it, but all the air around him is imbued with Sherlock, and well… “Ah,” he says again, after other, more useful sounds fail to present themselves for vocalization. He adds, “Um,” to the list of contributions he’s made in effort of keeping his secret a – well –
“Sherlock – I love you.” John holds his breath, and beneath him Sherlock stills, his fingers going lax in John’s hair.
As a result, he wakes up slowly, his eyelids blinking lazily, dividing darkness with light – or light with darkness, as he starts to keep his eyes open longer.
Sherlock’s mouth opens against John’s, and John licks into his welcoming, familiar heat, tasting Sherlock’s breath, the small sounds it carries, coming back again and again for more sensation, more depth, more of his mate.
Sherlock is quiet for a long few moments, lips pinched, eyes narrowed. At last he says, “Does this change anything?”
“Clothes,” John pulls away to say, then dives in again, letting his mouth travel where it wants: Sherlock’s lower lip, neck, ear, clavicles, and mouth again. He tastes like high tide, water claiming land, the meeting between the two a pulsing, thrashing dance.
“Oh,” John says faintly. He takes a deep breath – and then another when he sees Sherlock staring unblinkingly at him as he does so. “Er – no, at least, not where you can see them.”
This whole ridiculous night had been Sherlock’s idea (of course). As far as John could tell, this wasn’t even for a case – his flatmate and best friend had simply been bored and antsy enough for the past week to finally resort to desperate measures – in this case, desperate measures seemed to take the form of data gathering and/or experimenting.
"— amazing," John finishes, and has the pleasure of seeing Sherlock flush and fail to finish a sentence. He watches Sherlock look down at the thermometer, fiddling with it.
“Put your ear to the water – tell me if you can hear it,” John urges. The song is deep, low, with flutes of higher sound spiraling up, a salutation.
John gasps, breaks away, Sherlock’s nails against his skin too much to bear, not nearly enough to sate. “D’you – do you mind if we move this to a bed?” John pants. “Only,” and John pauses to squeeze the fingers now winding into his and kiss Sherlock’s parted mouth again, “I don’t know about you, but I don’t keep anything in the sofa.”
“I’m going to move,” John says after a spell, and proceeds to lie still for another minute or so, his body singing with fullness, with pressure, with heat, with being held –
“I…hoped. When I let myself. And I dreamt.” Sherlock wants to look away, but his eyes are caught up in John’s. The dim glow of morning seems magnified in his sea blue eyes. “I thought of you often. Endlessly,” he amends, because it’s true. An exercise in not thinking about something is the same as thinking about it. “I’m not sure I actually thought you – this – would happen.” He swallows. “Reciprocation.” He wonders if John will hear what he means, if he will point out Sherlock’s use of all-encompassing terms like ‘sentiment’ and ‘reciprocation’ where society would demand much more specific endearments and admissions. Sherlock’s lips attempt a smile, and it feels odd and unsure and achingly hopeful.
John must catch the thinking sickness from him, because he slows his movements, grinds his hips into Sherlock’s in a dance of aching pleasure. “Oh god,” he breathes. “I should have – d’you think – if we’d – sooner?” John huffs out between breaths, and Sherlock can’t hear this, not now, he can’t. It’s too close to unvoiced, unthought, unwished wants, and he can’t rewrite this, John’s voice spilling real and immutable into the air between them, but Sherlock can keep him from saying anything else: he pushes up for a kiss, receives it, can barely contain the lightning jump of joy and pain at the readily given press of lips and slick of tongue.
John prefers these dreams to his usual – Afghanistan or Sherlock getting himself killed – but they grow in frequency and detail, begin to blend details of his days in 221B, and he wakes confused more often than not, his skin tingling, his legs shifting, as if every part of him is searching, reaching in the dark.
The tone chimes two minutes later, and Sherlock shoots John a peculiar glance before turning to watch Carlton again. John swallows, just feeling the edge of confusion, but he puts it out of his mind as Mr. & Mrs. Willis give their answers – his bad habit is lazing about on weekday evenings, and hers is micromanagement – and their predicted answers line up neatly: full points.
John can’t help himself: “Oooh, let me guess – a 23 inch colour telly with Mediterranean styling in wood panel!”
Sherlock’s eyes fall closed, and his head tips forward to rest against John’s. “Yes,” he says, and then he nods, which moves his skin against John’s, becomes a sort of nuzzling movement, and John feels like he’s lighting up from the inside out. “Did you?” Sherlock asks, stilling, and his voice is breath and hope.
, John thinks. He should, he feels, be more nervous right now – but whatever calmness the morning’s first light, first thought, brought him lingers still. John breathes deeply through his nose, exhales long and slow. “Since I woke up.”
John raises his eyebrows at Sherlock before turning to face Carlton. “My adherence to petty human needs like food and sleep,” he deadpans. “It’s such a shame we can’t all go days without food or sleep. Biology is such a
John nods and accepts his glass when Sherlock holds it out to him. Their fingers don’t touch, but they might as well have for the tingle John feels in the skin that came closest to Sherlock.
“Your answer, if you please, John?” Carlton breaks in, and John blinks at him, having almost forgotten the man was there at all.
John feels a surge of feeling for the man atop him, wants him in a way he knows won’t diminish. “No,” he says after a moment. “I hear it gets better,” he growls, tips Sherlock forward and down for a kiss that starts simple and grows heated until Sherlock sits up with a groan, and stares wide-eyed and bewildered down at his own renewed erection.
“Oh hush, John – the tour will survive without us for an hour or so, and we’ll have a proper look at that waterfall.”
He knows John won’t come home tonight. Instead he’ll pull at some loud, crowded pub, chat and charm, so easy for him face to face (John may be lost in a crowd to a lesser eye, but one-on-one his technique is formidable) and then some faceless, nameless woman will invite him home for some friction and sweat and smeared cosmetics. John will be home early in the morning to shower before work, exhausted but with a spring in his step.
“John,” Sherlock pushes in close for a kiss, his face lighting up as John gives it, gives in, until Sherlock pulls back again and says: “Ten days on a ship together, with islands to explore, passenger intrigue to uncover, and bedding to ruin.” Sherlock gives him a blazing smile, then. “I think I’ll survive.”
Sherlock frowns at John, and it turns absentminded halfway through. Then he ups and asks what, in John’s opinion, is the most dangerous question: “We’ve lived together for quite some time now. Why did I never notice before?”
“Also, I purloined the taped copy of the show – he already had it in hand when I walked in. It’s in my coat pocket. Our stage debut won’t go beyond the audience members and their meager social circles.”
John’s touch against his own entrance is firm and familiar, despite the newness of the sensation. He knows how to move, knows what to expect to a certain extent, and soon he’s trembling, the heat of Sherlock around his dorsal tentacle competing with the coolness of his own external touch.
back out (the pebbles turning and rolling and settling as water fills the spaces between them before sluicing back towards the sea, frothing as it goes, only to be plowed into the beachfront again by the next incoming wave), all of it is suddenly obvious, undeniable.
Then they'd returned home, and John had carried all the bags up the stairs, out of breath from keeping up with a suddenly talkative Sherlock, and Sherlock had disappeared into his room.
John rolls his eyes, lets his mouth quirk into a sideways grin. Safe – or safer than the smile that threatens. “‘This?’”
John kisses him, pulls away with a grin. “Alright then, let’s go and get it.” He doesn’t think he’ll ever get over seeing Sherlock’s face shift from subtle surprise to unabashed delight.
“But this proves it, though,” Sherlock insists, his hand finding a tentacle and holding it, as if to check that it is solid, real. “This is where you belong – and I don’t – I can’t –”
“I do,” Sherlock interrupts. His eyes are caught on the fireplace now. “You were right, earlier.” His free hand rakes through his curls. There’s a look one shade shy of trepidation in his eyes. “It’d be a waste, not to at least try it.”
His gloves are in one hand, the other is deep in a coat pocket, and after an initial flash of contact, Sherlock won’t look at John, who is standing, waiting, almost shivering with the question he’s just finished putting together.
in them water, and he tips back and to the side a little further, swallows down a few quick mouthfuls, shivers as that water lights a path of want from mouth to throat to belly to tentacles –
In the meantime, he’s just as vaguely aware that Sherlock is lingering by his bed — deciding whether to take the cup? — but then he says: “Anytime, John.”
John doesn’t hesitate, only asks “Like this?” and then his hand is warm and soft and sweat damp around Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock is woefully unprepared for the reality of being held by John Watson. The first stroke is slow, so slow, and then the second a little faster, and the third sure and steady and Sherlock arches and cries out, voice creaking high and catching on a gasp, on the first half of John’s name, and then John is kissing him – perhaps to silence those sounds? – but then he pulls back a fraction and says, “Again,” and keeps working Sherlock’s cock, saying, “again, Sherlock, let me hear you, god,
.” Sherlock lifts his hips, half in an attempt to help John rid him of his trousers and pants, and half because John’s grip on his side seems to run a current straight through that pale body.
John smiles. “I’m awake now. Besides,” he says, shifting his head back and forth, not quite pushing into Sherlock’s touch, “that’s not very accurate.”
This thought has Sherlock measuring the glooming night out in solitary breaths, the quiet pressing close even as the world feels distant in ways he’d never thought possible. It scatters his intentions, and no matter how he arranges his thoughts, tonight he cannot climb into his mind.
“And you want…to try this thing…that is not the wine…with me?” John’s pulse is in his throat, in his mouth.
.” Sherlock is hot and tight inside, muscles working John’s cock with each tiny movement, with each breath it seems.
,” he says, and it sounds like pleading, like a question, and John lines up, leans forward, presses kisses where he can reach, and then, “Jo-
“You can’t hear a smile,” John says, but it comes out utterly fond and covered in grin and – and kisses, because Sherlock has pushed into his space until he can work his lips sloppily over John’s, exhaustion in each movement. John pulls back. “You should sleep,” he urges gently.
Skin - soft, cool - settles against John’s forehead. He wasn’t aware of just how sweaty his hairline was until that touch.
With his head to one side and one ear fully submerged, he can hear, in the far distance, familiar sound.
Blood seeps into sand, onto hands, into bandages, and John bleeds into fever. When the dry heat breaks, John limps back to London – close enough to smell home, but refusing to properly return. Not that he could even if he wanted to – not with his water gone.
“Stop it,” John says, because he can now, his throat no longer locked around an unworded question. “Stop it, Sherlock, and just…just answer me.” John draws a heaving breath and finally asks: “Was what happened on that stage… real.” He’s so tightly strung he can’t even manage inflection in his words.
“That – that explains why the bathroom isn’t flooded,” John says, a bit delirious, blinking up into the shower spray that isn’t being blocked by Sherlock. Little droplets seem to sizzle into him where they land on his new limbs. His human skin is less permeable, and the droplets roll down, tracing paths like a lover’s fingers might. He’d be worried about how impossible this all is if it didn’t feel so bloody amazing.
“Right at the bottom of the top middle drawer,” came the yawned response, which was the drawer where John currently was. He gave in then and just lifted out the huge sheaf of what turned out to be photocopies of the cold case police reports, which were all stapled together in twos and threes, and then a single sheet of white A4, loosely folded in thirds under them, and finally spied the stupid calculator right at the bottom of it all.
Now Sherlock looked straight at him. "I thought it was you screaming at first and I...I paused for a second. He...did
right...” he purred, deliciously pleased with himself, and Mycroft felt him smile against his neck once more. Mycroft made some kind of strangulated inelegant sound and Greg suddenly pressed harder against him. With that, Mycroft could simply take all this teasing no longer and he brought his hands up fast to slide his long, pale fingers into Greg’s silver hair and turn his face towards his own, where he kissed him with a building hunger that had suddenly raged from nowhere. In retaliation, Greg’s right hand gave his arse a proper squeeze, his other hand coming up to the side of Mycroft’s face and then round to cup the back of his head. They kissed fiercely for a few moments, pushing against each other, seeking friction, the hand on his arse sliding once again up Mycroft’s back to pull him closer still, until Greg broke away and looked at Mycroft, breathing hard. “Oh Jesus, you’re somethin’ else...” he gasped. His eyes were sweet, dark pools to drown in, Mycroft thought. “As are
He had stood there as the taxi drove away, watching it, thinking he didn’t know which was worse; Sherlock's betrayal or Mary’s. Then he thought,
But Greg clearly didn’t give a damn about what was or wasn’t done in Mycroft’s world. He didn't know or care. Or both. He was just gloriously, undeniably, refreshingly
she almost shouted his name in delight, and with barely disguised relief. "How wonderful! So you did make it!" She had raised her voice a little, partly to override Mycroft and Sherlock's heated discussion, and, John thought, to warn them that they were now to be on their best behaviour, but it was clear she was also genuinely pleased to see him. She came over to greet him and hugged him too, as warmly as Mr. Holmes had done, and narrowly missed crushing his poor flowers again. When she released him, she held onto his upper arms and squeezed. "How are you? Did you have a nice Christmas?" she asked. It wasn't a lie that he was well, but again John stuck firmly to his story and politely described his Christmas as having been 'lovely.'
Greg liked Mycroft’s lovely long neck. Had thought about liking it for quite some time. Now he could actually get to it, he burrowed his head down to explore the smooth, sensitive skin directly below his ear, forcing Mycroft to take his weight up on his elbow for Greg to get there. He closed his eyes when Greg used his teeth, but he didn’t actually intend to make any sound at all, so he was surprised when Greg suddenly dropped his mouth away from Mycroft’s skin and said softly, “Fuckin’ ‘ell, Mycroft, when you make that sorta noise it makes me think of…” he stopped short.
*semi-skimmed = half-fat milk. Semi-skimmed means half the fat (cream) is skimmed off. I think in the U.S. this is 2% milk. :)
The world simply stopped turning. John opened his mouth to say, "Did that hurt?" although that was just a cover, because he knew that Sherlock's gasp had not been a gasp of pain, but before he could speak, Sherlock brought his right hand quickly across his body and up, and his fingers touched and then rested lightly on John's where they now lay, still on his clavicle and shoulder. John watched as Sherlock's long fingers slid up John's own, up to the back of his hand.
all this?” Before Sherlock could even answer, John answered himself, remembering something he’d thought of earlier. “Oh my God -
as I prefer to call her," said Gabriella, with a grin. “But I think she calls me something else! Come in and make yourselves at home…coat hook
he said again, as he had in Constantine’s, once more feeling amused by the strangeness of his use of the word and the action. They sipped their drinks, enjoying the scent and the full, complex taste; heather and honey and gently smoky ripe, dark fruit. Greg leaned back against the counter and closed his eyes briefly in appreciation as he swallowed. “Ooh, thats good,” he remarked quietly with evident satisfaction. Mycroft hadn't needed to see that expression on his face and hear him murmur those words to know it was his favourite - he had already known by the amount left in the bottle, and its position on the shelf - but for other, more personal reasons, it was absolutely wonderful to behold both nonetheless. He didn’t say a word to himself about what he was doing, but he filed them away carefully for private quiet contemplation later.
"Oh, wow," said John in admiration, and stepped backwards in order to be able to view it properly. "Excellent birds!" He liked the way the artist had depicted the beautiful birds, their wings spread delicately in flight and reflected in the mirror-smooth surface of the water below them.
Sherlock lifted his own coffee cup to take another sip and he said into the cup, "Thank you," in such a quiet voice that John only really guessed that that was what he'd said from the look in his eyes, which was serene and grateful.
Greg gave a soft snort of laughter. “Don’t be. I’m about as vanilla as a four-year old’s ice-cream on Clacton beach,” he said softly. “But I really like you. And I’m pretty sure I’ve got this right and
Then he noticed an actual real live (dead) stuffed grey squirrel, pushed to the back of the shelves behind another plastic molecule. The squirrel was sitting up on its hind paws on a rock and was slightly lumpy looking, and a little twee, its paws positioned to hold a wizened looking acorn. It had very shiny eyes and John didn’t like the way it was looking at him. He grimaced a little back at it. “An early interest in taxidermy?” John asked, perturbed, pointing over in its general direction. Sherlock glanced over at it and raised an eyebrow dismissively. “Oh,
"I'm not a machine," said Sherlock defensively, dropping the steeple immediately and sitting upright with a frown. And hang on, was he imagining it or were Sherlock’s cheeks just a little bit pink? But he was off now, in full rant, and couldn't stop to think about that.
This was different because the knife-wound business had been an instinctive assessment of a very visible and bleeding wound, which urgently required his attention, and as a doctor and a surgeon, John's attention had been drawn to that wound and the blood with the single-mindedness of a hungry shark. But this was not the same. There
John, ever helpful, offered, "No, no, I don't mind, do you need a hand?" - although from the sound of those cats, he’d really rather not.
It was a large piece of thick, rough finished, pale-cream card. John recognised the look of it when he got closer before he even picked it up - it was expensive and handmade, clearly from the art and craft supply shop nearby. He could also now see it was an actual home-made card, and he turned it over to see what was on the front. Sherlock had just folded the piece of card neatly in half and drawn a simplified outline of a large (more or less) anatomically correct heart on the front in black Sharpie pen. In the centre of the heart, he had written
"I love the sea," said John, simply, gratefully, in awe of something so beautifully simple. They stood in silence for a moment, looking out at the marshes and the water and the sea in the distance. Then John said suddenly, "I love England. I don’t think I could ever live anywhere else."
Meanwhile, Agatha was making short work of her gin and tonic, John noticed. Remembering earlier conversations, John nudged Sherlock’s arm to point out Agatha tossing back her drink and said to Sherlock in an undertone, “ I thought you and Mycroft said something about not giving Agatha gin because of last year?”
"Been there. He wasn't there. Letters on the mat and the keyhole and door untouched for at least three days. No. Think." Sherlock snapped.
Of course John hadn't. Sherlock had got the address from the gallery owner when she had phoned him to ask for his help in finding the missing artist and his four missing paintings as quickly as possible before the exhibition started, and Sherlock had immediately gone round to his studio, found it empty and picked the lock. "It's the size of a shoe cupboard," Sherlock continued. "It'll be even smaller when it's full of police-idiots ogling. Anyway, his exhibition opens on January 7th and they'll certainly need it back before then. We need to find him before the exhibition opens or there's going to be a very unpleasant empty space on the wall."
“Oh, this gets better and better,” purred Greg in a roguish voice and downed his own drink. “More?” he offered, lifting his empty glass. Mycroft nodded, not quite trusting himself to speak. “Please,” he murmured after a moment.
John had barely taken his hand from the knocker when the vast oak door was yanked open, and Sherlock's father appeared beaming in the doorway, like a ray of sunshine dressed in checked shirt and navy corduroy. He stood there grinning for a moment and then he boomed,
"I loved these, when I was little," explained John. "The stupid thing is, I still do. It's by far the best prize! It’s definitely the most fun!"
Just then, Lucia entered the room bearing an extravagant table decoration. A neat pyramid of small, shiny bright clementines, all dotted with cloves and with strands of the ivy, and with a brassy gold candle standing in the centre. As she had both her hands full, John leaned forward to shift two of the place-cards out of the way - to make enough room for her pyramid in the middle of the runner - and when he did so, he suddenly noticed that Sherlock’s place setting was different from everyone else’s. The stem of his glass was decorated in the same way, but also included a very tiny sprig of holly dropped into the glass itself, complete with three minute bright red berries. John snorted and pointed at it. “Was that a mistake?” he asked with a grin.
Sherlock flinches as John invades his space, but doesn’t lift his hands, obviously anticipating a blow and accepting it, and every part of that cuts into John, that Sherlock should expect violence from him and think it
Clothes fall away, are thought away, discarded mentally, and Sherlock knows that if this thing ever comes to pass in real and waking life that these will be the awkward moments: socks and cuffs and buttons uncooperative, fingers clumsy and over-eager. He should practice these moments, rehearse these movements, but he can’t, he can’t, not when memories of John shirtless dance before his eyes, snatches of sight from when he’d walked in on John (accidentally, the first time) showering, changing, masturbating -
“Sherlock, get up here –” John gets his wish in the form of a firm press of a kiss. Sherlock is a lithe, warm, shifting weight on top of him, every breath shifting his skin against John’s, his hands clutching and grabbing at John’s waist and rib cage. Their legs slide together, apart, in between, and it’s not rutting, exactly, just a sort of lovely friction as their hips cant towards each other.
“Sherlock –” he says and trails his fingers down Sherlock’s right cheekbone and jaw, of all the places he could touch.
“Mhm,” Sherlock replies. They’re on their sides by now, tangled and tucked together. Sherlock has his hands right against John’s chest, only shifting one finger every now and then.
“John?” Sherlock asks softly, and John looks up from where he was staring, colouring slightly at being caught out – but then he sees that Sherlock’s staring too. He looks – careful, maybe, his expression open in a way John’s never seen. They are on their sides, not even an arm length apart, and yet for a moment, that distance seems greater.
If Irene hadn't been in Sherlock's room, would he have gone to it all the same? Called John over? For what reason, then, if not to show him the interloper in his bed?
. Sherlock is buried inside John, grinding and thrusting without ever really retreating, John’s inside Sherlock thrusting hard and fast, and every twitch of Sherlock’s pleasure becomes a clench or spasm of want and urgency for John. It’s a feedback loop, undeniable, irresistible, so intense that when their mouths meet, it takes all John’s concentration to give something resembling a kiss – and from Sherlock’s slack lips, it seems he’s in much the same position.
John presses his mouth against Sherlock’s, slips his hands into Sherlock’s curls and around his hips, and Sherlock gasps into their frantic kiss. John slips his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth, encouraging Sherlock to return that slick touch, and then Sherlock is pushing down as John pushes up, and everything is light and heat where they touch, the moment fanned back to fervour.
John thinks now of sounds and rhythms coaxed by different means from different instruments, of Sherlock’s mouth upon his now, closing the distance that had lingered that day, stiff and formal as a handshake, of hands taking, grasping, pulling, holding, pushing, a distant memory of thoughts half thought, wants half hidden in moments between waking and sleep.
And for the first time in a long time, John thinks back to all his elders warned him of, the horrors they painted of the world, their warnings and their glowers. He thinks of the things he’s seen that match that depiction – the war, his injury, parts of his recovery. Loneliness, uselessness, and a certain sort of homelessness that has nothing to do with shelter.
“I don’t mind,” John says, then pushes up to kiss him again, softer this time, slower. Sherlock’s eyes close as he kisses back, and it’s lovely, languid, lingering, this closeness, shared breath and space and touch.
John rakes his eyes over Sherlock’s silhouette, thinking that rest isn’t the only thing back on the menu now that the Work has been satisfied. “What’s going on? Fancy a swim, all of a sudden?” John asks, and god isn’t that an idea? Sherlock in the waves, the push-pull, the rush of water all over all of that skin…
“Sherlock,” John says, trying to soothe with one hand even as he undoes with the other. “Sherlock,” he breathes against his belly, and his breath wrapped around Sherlock’s name is moist and warm, and then his mouth trails kisses down as he murmurs, “Relax, I need you to –” and then his mouth is hot and wet wrapped around Sherlock’s cock, until he pops off, “–
“You’re doubting me?” Sherlock asks archly, even as he uses the stone slab behind him as leverage to push against John. For all his sometimes shyness, when skin meets skin, his reservations have a tendency to evaporate.
“It wasn’t,” Sherlock says, and it would be sharper if not for the fact that his voice is matching John’s in tone and volume.
John huffs out a laugh. "They don't sound like they have any fun, then. What's the point of having a bottle of wine and never drinking it?"
“Well, maybe not exactly,” John says, and he’d thought to say it one way, but it came out rather differently, especially since his hand is still resting against Sherlock’s skin. He doesn’t regret it, though, not with the way Sherlock looks at him before turning away. He doesn’t quite manage to do so in time to keep John from seeing the flush on his cheeks, either. John watches Sherlock’s back as he exits the kitchen.
, because his mouth drops open. “It’s very faint,” he says, “but I hear it.” He purses his lips before asking, “What are they saying?”
If John is spending his time with Sherlock, then surely it is safe to admit that Sherlock is spending his time with John. He only has to invite John to two crime scenes before the good doctor begins tagging along without prompting, clearing his schedule and assuming his place beside Sherlock, crouching beside cadavers, conferring in quiet tones the likely causes of death.
Sherlock lifts up his own glass, examining the colour against the kitchen lights. Whatever he sees he keeps to himself, and they move through to the living room, neither quite following nor leading the other. A magnetised migration.
Sherlock feels his mouth answer in kind, relaxing away from uncertainty. Tension unspools from his muscles, and he feels his eyes flutter closed, open again, then closed again. He tightens his grip where his hands have taken hold: John’s waist, John’s shoulder. There’s a heaviness in Sherlock’s bones, muscles, blood, leaden weights courtesy of the night, the revelation, the panic, the broken slumber: Sherlock knows he’ll sleep again, and he hates it. He forces his eyes open one last time. “Stay,” he says, although it’s really a request, a plea, even if it emerges as a command.
Sherlock is licking his lips as if in a daze when John’s eyes flutter open, both of them now well and truly caught in the Tide. It makes no sense – pheromones shouldn’t cross the DNA gap, and Sherlock is neither female nor fertile, has no Tide, will have no Tide, and yet –
He comes back three days later, his feet coral-scratched and two of his tentacles covered in stinging polyps, but he’s lit up with discovery, radiating wonder, deaf to concerned lectures.
John pulls his belt from the loops with a victorious laugh, and Sherlock’s fingers manage the top button, and John pulls the zipper down, and they both push, John’s legs and feet coming into play, and then he is naked, and laying his weight back down against Sherlock, and then his lips again, washing Sherlock in sensation, in stimulus, in
Sherlock tries, tries, clutches, clings to the moment, but then it breaks over him and into him and he’s coming, muscles contracting, pelvis jerking, back arching, heart rate spiking, and his breath – his breath – his voice – he’s lost all control –
“Why are you apologizing?” Sherlock wants to know. His words are slow, almost slurred, sloppy and he wonders how long he’s been lying still in John arms. He should have been measuring the seconds, keeping record.
“Hey,” he says, shuffles even closer in the sand, “hey, listen,” and he takes Sherlock’s hands where they’ve clenched inside their coat sleeves, just cups those fists with his palms, standing so close now that their bare toes are bumping and chafing against each other in the grit. “That’s not going to happen, Sherlock.”
“Ready?” John asks, and he’s maybe bruising Sherlock’s hips at this point with his fingertips, trying to brace himself against the urge to thrust. “Sherlock –”
“Just more wine,” John finds himself saying, trying to fill the silence Angelo is grinning into existence. Sherlock’s already at the door, but John knows he can hear the exchange. He picks up their boxes, only to have Angelo take them and sweep to the front with John trailing behind.
“If you think driving safely is dull, then I’ll just walk home, thanks,” John says. “It’s only about 34hrs by foot, anyway, so –” John stops to frown at Sherlock’s shocked expression, then goes back over what he just said.
“Yes, John, of course I understand what you’re saying –” Sherlock begins testily, despite still straddling John, still clinging to his shoulders, and John holds back a put-upon sigh and presses on:
.” He lifts a hand to run a thumb along Sherlock’s cheekbone, wanting to wipe away the sadness in his expression, the anguished acceptance in his eyes. “If anything is missing from anywhere, then it’s that you were missing from my life before, alright?” John lifts his tentacles from the rocking water, lets saltwater rain from them to the surface
After a moment, their breathing evens out, sighs down to stillness again, and in the hush that follows, there’s still the sound of snow softly striking the windows.
Sherlock comes back to himself at that. "It's red wine, John. It gets better with age." He steps forward then, holds out a hand, and inspects the bottle carefully when John relinquishes it. "True connoisseurs would probably argue that drinking it would be a waste."
Like this, still waking, feeling Sherlock breathe against him, his beating heart, the whirling frenzy of him slowed to slumber, John feels a surge of something he is done fighting.
“I don’t have any answers,” John says, then forestalls Sherlock’s outrage at being denied answers by lifting a hand and adding: “The elders never answered my questions.” John pulls his mouth sideways to show he’s just as displeased.
John catches his breath in a surprised hiccup, and then he can’t help it – and he’s sure Sherlock wasn’t expecting it, either – but John’s laughing, nothing for it, giving over to breathless, panting laughter, leaning forward into Sherlock’s body, and every pitch and swell of his mirth shifts pleasure through him right along with the delight, a tidal force of desire and joy.
Sherlock wonders what options John is considering and discarding, which words he wants to keep, which are scratched out before they ever reach his tongue.
“Yes,” John is saying in between kisses, and “Sherlock,” and “Of course,” and Sherlock whines at that, and John’s hands come up to cup his jaw as they kiss, his thumbs brushing across high cheekbones, feeling the heat of high emotion in that smooth skin, but also moisture, and he won’t call attention to it now, won’t say “What’s this?” but will instead try to prove to Sherlock that there’s no need.
Sherlock seems to agree – long arms wrap around John, bring him in close, and they are chest to chest, still kissing, hands urgent in their exploration, their voices reduced to gasps and each other’s names.
They stay for three more songs (all David Bowie – John will have to ask about that, but later), dancing and swaying in each other’s arms. When they do walk home, their hands keep straying and touching as if they’re still on the dance floor. They can't seem to stop, although neither of them seems to be trying very hard.
Sherlock shakes his head. “I meant – the – the sex thing.” He shivers, can’t even find it in himself to hate the uncertainty and awkwardness of his words. His pulse hammers high and hard in his head, in his throat.
“What’s this all about?” John asks, but he follows Sherlock through the throng that separates the bar and the dance floor. It takes him a long moment to realize that his hand is in Sherlock’s, and by then it’s too late to withdraw it – the crowd’s too dense, and John doesn’t fancy losing Sherlock in it, not now he’s finally shown up.
John is watching right back, holding Sherlock’s other hand still. Every little move of Sherlock’s fingers sends a scintillating cascade of want through John, washing through his chest, spilling down his arms. He wants to wash Sherlock in touch, wants him to feel like he does, right now, adrift in sensation, even from something so simple as a shifting thumb. John wants, and so he acts, one hand moving to cup a nipple, running the pad of his thumb over it.
“John!” Sherlock probably means for it to be a complaint, a chastisement, but it whips through the air between them, a breathy whisper; it coaxes a thrum from John instead of chagrin, and now the tentacles that had been keeping them upright rush in to twine and twist and push and pull and tear, flinging scraps out of the tub, and Sherlock quivers and cries out and doesn’t resist as they both slide lower into the water. His heart is pounding so loud John can hear it, feel it, Sherlock’s breath huffing out in great gasps. In mere moments he is naked above John, naked and hard and yes,
Sherlock blinks. “Still John. Of course. Of course John – his tea is reliably free of hallucinogenic additives and corrosive compounds.”
He thinks of sharing laughter and adrenaline and heady success, their breaths huffing into shared space, turning to look at one another – and on so many nights, this has been enough for the fantasy to unfold (hands reaching, mouths meeting, culmination, climax).
John starts giggling behind his hand as he reads and tries desperately to keep it from becoming something louder and more noticeable. It doesn’t help that he can see Carlton mouth the words ‘
“Of course it was – it was extraordinary.” John flails about for something else to add, but exhaustion and his mouth settle for repeating, “
A chime tells them to put their pens down, and Carlton steps up to the first couple, the Amesons. John doesn’t pay attention to their answer – it seems they got full points – but instead watches as Sherlock watches Carlton, his eyes dancing over the presenter’s figure and dress for the night.
"Hhm," John shifts his pelvis. All his joints sing their discomfort. "S’okay," he manages. "…wha’ time is’t?" He swallows again, makes a face.
?” he asks at last, voice a little hoarse, and he would love to blame it on the salt edge to the air, but his throat was made to breathe this air, current difficulties notwithstanding.
go about waking an ex-army doctor with PTSD up in the middle of the night by throwing him a gun and shouting at him to get dressed….
Sherlock stands, and John reaches for his wallet, but gives up when Angelo levels a stern look at him. “Dinner was delicious, Angelo – and no dessert, thanks,” John says with a smile.
John feels his mouth twitch to the side, something bitter and sweet, brave and fearful, hesitant and sure. “Come up here?”
If he were home, safely ensconced in his room at 221B, he’d be having John by now, or John would be having him, and he’d be a mess of desperate, quiet pleasure, but with this new setting Sherlock needs to think through the steps that lead to plausibility, because without plausibility, these thoughts amount to little more than self-torture.
John shifts his hips, takes hold of himself, and Sherlock bites his lower lip and lets his knees fall wider, and then there’s heat and a dull sort of pressure, hinting at the possibility of bright pain. John’s still-slick hand comes up and strokes Sherlock’s cock, working it back to full hardness, and Sherlock fights not to shift in that grip, tries to keep his hips still even as his muscles contract and flex.
Sherlock frowns at John like he’s being slow – and he probably is, given he’d just woken after god-knows how few hours of sleep and is now engaging in the barest bit of waking dreaming. “Don’t you recognise this place, John?” Sherlock asks, eyebrows still tucked close to each other.
John doesn’t bother shaking his head or telling them they don’t understand. He simply turns and leaves. Danger is a bright light that draws minnows to the sharp-toothed dark, and John has always wanted to bite back.
It is, of course, comforting that the axiom ‘the more things change, the more they stay the same’ proves to be true, and in three key ways:
“Sherlock – what –” John comes into view – he’s peeling Sherlock’s hands from his face. “What are you on about? Please tell me what’s going on.”
They both fall silent and listen to the distant chorus again, something in it akin to whale song, but also wind and also the echoes of underwater ravines. John realises Sherlock is watching him after a moment.
Sherlock would slip away, sneak upstairs to put some distance between himself and the goings-on downstairs, the punch and presents, the questions and quiet looks, and maybe John would follow - or maybe he wouldn’t, but he’d notice Sherlock’s absence and go looking - or maybe he’d just know where to find him, like he sometimes does-
“– long overdue?” Sherlock asks, and his whole face is unabashedly happy in a way John’s seldom seen.
John feels his face set in determination, and something of it must read well for Sherlock, because he surges forward then, pressing kiss after kiss to John’s mouth. His hands come up and hold John’s face, fingers carding through John’s hair, and John’s hands come up and hold Sherlock’s forearms, thumb running along the thin skin of his wrists. The feeling of Sherlock’s breath breaking against his face, his fingers shyly combing along his scalp, has John reaching for him, aching to hold him in his arms again, to make up for moments lost.
“You don’t have to,” Sherlock says hurriedly, body suddenly tense against John’s once more, and John hesitates before asking:
He slips from the room to grab a towel, walking carefully as his tentacles wind themselves back into their dormant places, despite being nowhere near flaccid enough to pull their disappearing act.
The kiss deepens, no longer just an intense press of lips, a ragged exchange of breath; Sherlock whimpers and sags back against the wall by the entry as John’s hands wind into his hair and hold him, tilting his head to help the kiss along, then pulling his head back so he can have a go at that neck, and Sherlock’s gasping out little ‘
Sherlock stiffens above him, his breathing stops, and his arse clenches around John’s fingers, just once, and then Sherlock shakes as he says, “I just – I nearly –”
John huffs out a laugh as his tapered tentacle slips further in, contracting to squeeze out a coating of slick as it goes. “Give – give it a moment – there, oh
And then he hears Sherlock’s laugh, a deep rumble, and it sounds utterly carefree, surprised and wanton, and John can’t get their mouths together fast enough, can’t press enough kisses against Sherlock’s shaking chest, his peaked nipples, his tilted chin, Sherlock’s long fingers twining into John’s hair, the almost curls at his nape, his lean thighs shifting to rub against John’s hips, bony ankles slipping over John’s thighs to rest beside one another between his legs.
“And that brings us to the Watsons!” Carlton chirps brightly, stepping full of bounce over to their side of the stage.
John grins, pushes forward and up, and gets his mouth on Sherlock’s again, gets his hands up between their chests, and starts to unbutton Sherlock’s white shirt. Sherlock squawks in surprise, into the kiss, into John’s mouth, and John pulls back on a laugh.
– and problematic. Sherlock had expected to come much earlier than John, to have time to put his pleasure aside and focus on John’s, to make sure the remnants of intercourse were as satisfying for John as possible with Sherlock’s limited experience. But like this – John had pushed Sherlock ahead of him, then followed immediately, and Sherlock hadn’t done much more than lay there and receive stimulus and –
When the cab pulls up outside number 221, Sherlock lingers to pay, which is odd, but John’s body is on autopilot while his mind turns over and over, and he’s in the door and up the stairs and stepping into the middle of the living room before he even realises Sherlock isn’t ahead of him or beside him or even behind him. He feels that absence suddenly, acutely, and as he does, something happens:
“Kind of hard to do this in the tub,” John says, his laughter lapsing into tired huffing. Sherlock hums, his eyes flicking up from where he’s tracing spirals into John’s skin to meet John’s fond stare through his lashes. The resourceful gleam in his gaze has John grinning right alongside Sherlock’s smirk – he somehow doubts the size of the tub is going to deter Sherlock from trying to ‘replicate results’ as he would put it.
“True.” The amused uptick on Sherlock's lips evens out into something softer, warmer. There's a look in his eyes that John would have no trouble picturing or identifying on anybody else's face, but on Sherlock's it seems unfamiliar, unexpected, and it's gone before he can quite wrap his brain around it. What replaces it is a decisive look, almost businesslike.
John slows, stills, settles. He feels like his skin might be steaming, feels they might be incandescent together, a completed circuit.
and then suddenly they’re on the dance floor, and Sherlock’s hands are shifting to make room for John while seeming to guide him closer –
He doesn’t need the sudden change in pitch of Sherlock’s groans, doesn’t need the sharp intake of breath, the botched attempt at saying his name – not when he can read the tightening of Sherlock all around him, the way it pulls him forward, against, deeper –
He gets them settled on their knees, facing each other, still cinched together with his ventral tentacles, and begins the slow advance of his dorsal tentacles, their slit tips not nearly as swollen or needy as they were during his Tide, but still all too eager to explore his mate’s quivering skin.
John blinks: downstairs the door has opened, and then there is the clatter of Sherlock hurtling up the steps, taking them two or three at a time with his long legs.
"This one?" he'd asked, and reached to take the most likely culprit. It wasn't a label he was familiar with, and furthermore, it was a red – and a posh one, at that. Sherlock normally preferred a white wine, when he indulged at all. John was a beer or scotch man, himself, but wouldn't say no to a red wine for a special occasion – even if that special occasion was usually of a more
John laughs, pulls back to look at a very flustered Sherlock. He opens his mouth to tease, and a pale hand sneaks up to cover it.
Since his onset Tide with Sherlock three months ago, there hasn’t been another – and now, despite John not being concerned or upset in the least, it seems as if Sherlock has decided to take all the worrying on himself. “You’re still worried I’m going to decide I need someone like me? Sherlock –”
John sighs, but lets his tentacles slither out to straighten some of the mess Sherlock had made. “Now what?” he asks quietly after. Sherlock is breathing sweet air into the space between them, his skin still damp, his body perfumed with satiation. John tucks his tentacles close to his body, tries not to let them go where they want, which is around Sherlock, his waist, his thighs, his upper back.
want this?” John asks, slowing his movements a bit. Sherlock’s eyes are dazed as he lifts his head to look up at John, but his mouth seems caught in indecision. “Because I do, Sherlock –”
John’s throat locks up with a click of a swallow, and Sherlock nods as if he asked a question, and then they meet in the middle, the would-be embrace becoming a press of a kiss, just their mouths against one another. They stand like that for ages, it seems, holding each other tightly, their lips pushed together, barely breathing – until at last they do, and each inhale is a little less shaky than the last, each exhale a little less desperate sounding, until they are holding each other close, breathing and looking, and not much else.
John has the distinct impression that he should be more worried – or at least shocked – by the night’s proceedings, but currently all he’s wondering is who’s seducing who, here – because whoever it is needs to take the next step –
Beside him, Sherlock scribbles down something short and – by the sounds of it – severe. John is hard pressed not to start laughing all over again as he realizes the likely reason for Sherlock’s intensity.
John blinks, tilts his head, replays the words in his mind’s ear. Silky, dark, the voice that utters those words is a billow of smoke on a damp breeze, smooth and somehow potent. John turns to face the source of the voice. “Sorry?”
“Oh god John,” he pants at last, “is it – does it always feel like that?” His voice is a little soft, a little overwhelmed.
After a moment, biting his own lip isn’t good enough, and John slips a hand up along Sherlock’s neck and jaw, telegraphing his movements, his wants, and Sherlock looks pleased and surprised as he dips down, lets John place a kiss, take a kiss – and then it’s less about exchanging kisses and more about handing the same one back and forth, tongues and teeth coming into play, until John has Sherlock’s lower lip between his teeth, lightly tugging, and Sherlock’s eyes are fluttering shut even as his mouth drops open, shallow breaths tumbling out.
There’s a breathless quality to the air, and an electric shiver runs through John. He looks down into his own cup of deep red as he asks, “How long do we wait?”
, John decides, letting his thoughts shift along skin. Time enough to worry about what could have been, what almost never was – but later. Right now, Sherlock is here, breathing shallowly above John. He’s resting his weight on one forearm, that hand wrapped around John’s side and ribcage, thumb twitching every now and then, almost absentmindedly, as he watches him.
Sherlock’s room is calm and dark, but the sudden glow of weak yellow light from a corner lamp warms the space. Sherlock heads straight for the bed, then turns to catch John up in his arms before falling back into the pillows and covers.
, for a moment, until it all drains away, leaving behind a single thought, like driftwood after high tide: Obviously he’s not done torturing himself quite yet. He may never be.
Sherlock bites his lip, so John takes his hip with his clean hand and wipes his other hand on the edge of the bed sheet. “Let’s try like this.” He guides Sherlock to all fours above him, then pushes until Sherlock’s arse is up against his thighs. “Ready?” he asks, and Sherlock nods.
, then, Sherlock. Because when I say –” John cuts himself off when he sees Sherlock’s expression shift.
Sherlock starts to grind against John, slowly, and for a moment John isn’t sure if perhaps his tentacles are pushing Sherlock against him, but then he feels Sherlock tense and twist to bring his hips to bear with greater pressure, and John groans from the pleasure of the touch, from the ecstasy of the thought.
“…Welcome?” Every coherent sentence in John’s mind is stuck in the treacle of his thoughts. It’s late – early – whatever – and there’s this man and that skin –
“Not my Tide,” he says, even as one tentacle – the ventral right – curls over Sherlock’s thigh, giving his quivering leg a squeeze. “It’s – it doesn’t
–” Sherlock’s hips twist into and against the new pressure – three of John’s fingers now – and his breath stutters. His hands flail and anchor on John’s biceps. “That’s – there –” He huffs out a breath, and it’s a bit quivery, “I’m ready, John – please – please –”
stains on the floor and the carpet are.” He grins, and it’s easy, not just because Sherlock’s behaviour naturally inspires that sort of mad grin, but because at least they’re back on solid ground now, leaving all talk of hidden desires behind.
John covers Sherlock’s mouth with his hand, because he simply cannot hear another word about that. “We are never talking about your brother again. Not like this.”
“This – I –” Sherlock tries, stops, swallows, and John releases his wrists from their fabric prison.
Carlton quirks an indulgent smile at the audience. “I meant: between the two of you –” he indicates Sherlock and John (who cracks his knuckles beneath his writing surface, growing less and less tolerant of the presenter’s patronizing handling of Sherlock) in turn, “who makes the best tea?”
John flushes. “Yes. Makes – it – easier in water. Slick. Makes everything –”and John’s words fail and his eyes go wide as Sherlock licks the wrist he’s holding. John holds his breath as Sherlock’s eyelids flutter.
“No signs of that,” he says with a playful nudge to Sherlock’s side, and Sherlock snorts and then bumps his hip back a few seconds later, as if he’d had to work out whether it would be alright to do so. There’s the barest hint of a flush high on his cheeks, and John bites his at his own lower lip and savours that expression – Sherlock, bashful, slightly awkward, but trying nonetheless.
starts up, and John laughs and moves closer in to Sherlock again. “Alright then, you ridiculous man – one more song. And then –”
for John to come home with that small, smug smile, the self-satisfied look that says he’s slipping away again, date by date, girlfriend by girlfriend.
“Ooh yeah,” Greg said, “yeah, please! Christ, it's colder than I thought. Freezin’ actually, even in the sun!” As Mycroft went to get them, Greg said, "The white one’s mine an’ all, don’t worry!”
"No, John," Sherlock said placatingly,  "we're simply borrowing it to look at it closely before this becomes a missing person's case sooner or later and the police get involved. Couldn't possibly look properly with the morons from Scotland Yard breathing down our necks - have you seen the size of his studio?"
Mycroft smiled. “Not so bad yourself,” he replied smoothly, then added, “I thought I’d join you over there in Smoker’s Corner.”
printed on them. “We don't use this one anyway,” replied Sherlock, peering carefully into it from a distance, and avoiding breathing in the faint wisps of white smoke still rising from it. It was the cup labelled
And Sherlock laughed, really laughed, that deep throaty chuckle that John adored. “It certainly is…” he said, then added, “…and John, that was by
"Now you, John!” said Agatha, excitedly, as Sherlock silently held out his palm to John for John to take the fish.
Greg, getting into his stride now, continued roughly, “It makes me wonder what it would be like for you to have
…one night stands….Y'know? Last night was—I don’t want a…a quick one off, I mean. I wanna…I wanna see you again.”
Mycroft had managed to gather his wits enough to answer, and he squeezed lightly back as he did so. “Am I indeed?” he asked, intrigued. “And where should I be?”
pleasing,” he said seriously, but with the smile still on his face. “And I think I should tell you that what
Sherlock was quiet, but it was a different sort of quiet from before, John thought. he could tell the difference now between grumpy-quiet and thinking-quiet, mind-palace-quiet and putting-together-a-case quiet. ‘The many Quiets of Sherlock Holmes,’ he thought, smiling to himself.
be so much fun. Or that he would ever want to use that disgusting three-letter word to describe it. But fun it was, and passionate, and terrifying in its intensity all the same. Mycroft leaned down and kissed him again.
Somewhere between falling asleep on opposite sides of the last bed available in Oswich and waking up sharing almost exactly the same space, John’s finally come to terms with something – and that something is fragile in its infancy. John feels that whatever it is he says next, it had better be exactly the right thing.
“Or are your appendages not that articulate?” He shuffles to face John as he asks, but keeps his eyes closed.
“That’s easy enough. I do,” John says with complete surety. “I certainly get enough practice – in the last month, he’s only made tea twice, and not to drink mind you.” With each word, it’s a little easier to recapture the feeling and flow of the character he’s supposed to be playing.
Sherlock comes with a keening cry, arms shaking, hips jerking, and John can feel little kisses of warmth against his stomach and ribs before Sherlock’s come is swept away by the grotto’s agitated wavelets. Somehow, it is those brief flares of sensation that tip John over into orgasm, his body stiffening, his tentacles tightening in their coils, his dorsal tentacle pushing home into Sherlock and pumping warm slick into him, less than during his Tide, but still enough that Sherlock gasps from the sensation, the breath punched from him with each new, powerful contraction.
Sherlock turns and leaves, striding swiftly for stage right, against the flow of people, and John follows. He wants to ask if Sherlock’s solved it already, he wants to ask what evidence he spotted, he wants to ask so many things.
Sherlock’s eyes fall shut, and there’s a deep crease in between his brows as he groans, pulling back to free himself. “
“Round one, let’s warm up with some easy ones, yes?” The glint in Carlton’s eye does not bode well for John’s dearly guarded privacy. “Alright, ladies and gentlemen, question number one:
With a gasp, Sherlock’s arms give out, and he slumps against John’s chest again, heedless of the water, simply flopping down against John’s skin and shaking, breathing, still twitching.
Danger was not the only card played in a bid to keep John from the land. His parents took him aside before he left and asked a serious question, a worried question: “And what of your Tide? If it comes for you, what then?”
Outside on the sidewalk, the night air is suddenly quiet and peaceful, despite plentiful foot traffic. A crowd has nothing on Angelo’s enthusiasm.
John opens the door, and for a moment Sherlock feels the floor tilt beneath his feet, because yellow squares are spread upon his bed like daylight made fantasy made
Sherlock pulls the offending layers from John even as they sit up, and then while John is still blinking at the sudden divestment, Sherlock opens and pushes his trousers and pants down. John does a fair job of catching up, shimmying out of hastily unbuttoned jeans, and then they are naked, side by side, breathing hard and looking at each other.
,” John hisses. “I’ve got you, I’ve got you,” he says, keeping Sherlock tilted so that spot inside him flares like a lighthouse with each of John’s thrusts.
Sherlock does a little half-shrug and moves forward to put the bottle he’s still holding on the counter John’s just cleared. “Well,” he says, but doesn’t add anything else. He clears his throat. “If you’d prefer take out –”
John feels like he’s inflating even though he’s sighing with relief. After a moment, he allows himself a small, private smile. It feels bold, and it gets him saying: “I like this.” He give’s Sherlock’s forearm a squeeze with his left hand back in place.
“Is this alright?” he asks, and Sherlock is panting, but he makes space between the rushed breaths to say, “Yes, obviously.”
John swallows, waits for his heart to turn back over, clears his throat. “The pool,” he says, and it emerges a bit raspy. “When you saw me – the way you looked at me – I mean I didn’t even realize until you... left, but it started then. Right then.”
“Lovely,” Sherlock says with one of his easy, for-other-people smiles, and it’s a good thing he’s stepping in to say so, because John is busy trying to come to terms with the fact that Sherlock entered them under the surname
John moans around Sherlock’s cock in his mouth and throat, his hands scrabble at Sherlock’s waist, grabbing and holding him, and all his muscles tense, pulling Sherlock close and further into his throat. John feels himself slip even deeper into that mouth, and Sherlock swallows against John once more, hard, and then comes with a high keen, startled, and convulses in John’s hold, in John’s mouth. His release is thick and brackish and plentiful, and John swallows, swallows, wants every last molecule of Sherlock that he can get.
“I think I get to decide where I belong,” John points out. “And furthermore, I think this is just more proof that you do things to me, Sherlock.” He tries for a light tone, but the realization behind the words sits too heavy for that. “I should never have been able to have a Tide the way I did, where I did, with you – but I did. And now… this.” Even as they both watch, the tentacles grow larger, more substantial, taking in more and more water weight. “This – I don’t know what this is, but it’s not a Tide, alright? I don’t have an urge to – to –”
about the case? I just need something to put for the blog. It’s just sounding so…lifeless as it is now.”
Mycroft looked up into Greg’s chocolate-dark eyes and his heart leapt and spun. ‘I think I might be falling in L-word already,’ he thought in total and bemused surprise.
"I think I just–I just wanted to...I just..." John took a deep breath and confessed. “Oh, come on - I was annoyed with you and you were being annoying. I just wanted to make you tell me - mostly because you seemed so reluctant to do it. I
"Who? When?" asked John, turning Sherlock's head to assess the bruise and looking for the source of the blood on his shirt. Sherlock let John turn his head with one hand and gently palpate his cheekbone, temple and around his eye socket with his other hand.  "It's just bruised," said Sherlock, "but my neck hurts. And the blood's not actually mine, it's his. My forehead met his nose with some force. That's why my neck hurts - and why I’ve got a headache - he was quite solid."
answered his sarcastic inner voice, which often sounded like Sherlock. He pushed it outside and shut the door on it.
“Ooh, look! Look, everyone! I got a really lovely hair slide!" announced Lucia, in a pretend-pleased voice. She had put it all together and now clipped it neatly into her hair, tipping her head to one side and bouncing a hand under her ear coquettishly to show it off. It was pale blue plastic with large dark blue flowers moulded onto it. “Oh, now that’s lovely!" said John, jokingly serious,
Mrs Hudson had also noticed the change in him and she had put it not so subtly. "Oh, he's good for you, Sherlock, dear," she had said, warmly, rubbing his arm fondly as she spoke, and Sherlock had just looked her in the eye and sort of smiled. He wasn't angry about Mrs. Hudson knowing. And she knew, even if she didn't say it out loud.
John, to keep John safe, to keep them all safe - and that being the only reason he had been able to contemplate doing it. He had thought about John before he made the phone call to him, thought about what he had to say, what he needed to say to make this work, and he thought about what he wanted to say and what he couldn't. And by the time he was speaking to John on the phone, on the roof, there was no acting in his voice; though the words were an act, the emotion behind them was all real. And he had remembered, suddenly, so vividly, that day in the sitting room years before, and what he had realised with the thought of “Well, you know I do love shocking you, John", and he thought, this was
Hesitantly, Greg said, “Ahh, s—I’m...sorry about the swearing...” he trailed off awkwardly, feeling that maybe he’d over-stepped a line with his use of the f-word.
As they drew closer, they realised that the person sitting there was painting at an easel. John could not believe their luck. But then he realised it was not going to be that simple after all. From a closer vantage point, they could see that the person at the easel was a woman. From the grey-white of her hair, John estimated that she was probably in her late 50's, maybe early 60's. She was dressed simply; slightly eccentrically, in an ancient looking, paint-streaked artist's smock and with what looked like a blue boiler suit underneath. She was wearing sturdy and very new walking boots, and her long silver-grey hair was wound up in a wild haphazard bun. She glanced around on hearing them approach, but didn't speak or smile, just nodded at them curtly in cordial greeting and then went back to her work.
Greg slammed the car door shut behind him and as the cab pulled away, Mycroft turned around to look at him standing on the pavement. They were close to a street lamp but not directly under it, and the vapour of their breath plumed out cleanly into the chill air. Greg smiled. “So…here we are then,” he said again, deliberately, and Mycroft laughed right on cue. “So…what’s a nice fellow like you doing in a place like this?” he quipped back immediately, and had the immense satisfaction of it now being Greg - instead of himself, for a change - who burst out with an unexpected peal of laughter.
looked. They were so close physically - staring into each other's eyes, Sherlock seated, John leaning over him holding his face, and John could feel his heart begin to beat quite hard and this was suddenly no longer a professional medical inspection of an injured patient, it had become something different. An awkward moment where they were on the very edge of...something else. But John was a professional and not knowing quite how to handle what was happening, he turned to what he knew best. Safest. Not handling it at all. "Your eyes are fine, the pupils are normal," said John, letting go of Sherlock's chin and standing up straight again. His fingers tingled where they had touched Sherlock's face and he rubbed them lightly together out of Sherlock's sight.
"Sometimes you're like an old woman, with your moaning!" John said eventually. And that shut Sherlock right up. Ten minutes later, he asked John abruptly for the poetry book, and then he pretended to read it the rest of the way.
They lay for a moment facing each other, both up on an elbow, mirroring each other’s positions again; just like they had in the kitchen. Then Mycroft leaned towards and over him and lightly pushed him down to the pillow, kissing him passionately, moving his body further over Greg’s and stroking his pale hands down over Greg’s tanned skin as he went. Lying half over Greg, he drew back a moment and stared into his deep brown eyes. They were so dark they were almost black in the wonderfully shadowed and softly-lit cocoon of his bedroom. Greg’s silvered hair was so striking, not only in the soft, cold light of the moon but also against the deep sea green of his bed sheets. ‘I’m so lucky to have this,’ thought Mycroft, looking down at him. He felt all of 18 again.
It was quite a difficult sentence for anyone to get out the first time, and saying it always made one feel so suddenly, incredibly vulnerable, but this was not just anyone; this was
“Hmmm...maybe I’m not quite close enough for you to tell?” he murmured softly, all full of flirty bravado. “Maybe I need to be...just a little bit closer...?”
"You do," John agreed, smiling more broadly, and then he came out of the kitchen to look at Sherlock. Holding the ice pack in one hand and a tea towel in the other, his smile faltered and he said, in a completely different tone, "You
Mycroft nearly faltered at that but he also saw a perfect opportunity here to get his own back. He upped the ante on his Upper Crust accent and purred in a low, deep rumble, “Oh dear. Did you not hear me very well? Perhaps I wasn’t clear enough?” He paused for a long time, letting the sexual tension build incrementally; while Greg waited, unmoving, and then he growled,
The footpath after they left the quay was just a well-worn path of hardened mud and scruffy grass, but it was dry and easy going underfoot. Just as well really, thought John, as neither of them had thought to wear the appropriate footwear for anything more trying. They rounded a curve in the path past some matured hedgerow, and then suddenly found they were walking high up on an old earthen sea-wall, directly alongside the estuary. It was breathtakingly beautiful. The tide was out and John stopped to look. The daylight here by the water was very clear somehow, with a slightly golden feel to it and the birds that were in flight looked like they were lit from below by the sun reflecting off the low water. Even the mudflats looked beautiful, like sleek grey seal-skin. They were pocked with the rune-like footprints of birds.
Considering the near icy cold conditions last night, the sun was clearly trying really hard to make up for it this morning. Greg stood in the gap of the slightly open balcony door, in the weak but very welcome early morning sunlight, and bent his head, cupping his palms up to his mouth to light his cigarette. Once lit, he kept hold of the lighter between his first two fingers and wrapped his arms around himself, rubbing his upper arms both at once. Mycroft watched him, amused, as Greg tipped his face upwards towards the sun and closed his eyes as he took in the first really deep big drag and then, without taking Sherlock’s stolen cigarette from his mouth, held it between his teeth and exhaled the smoke around it with very obvious relish.
“Hmmm, well. I should hope not…” Mycroft replied, but he smiled at the hot part. “Don’t call me that in public though, will you?”
When Sherlock's back met the wall with a satisfying thud, John immediately pushed his own body hard against Sherlock’s, like he really wanted to do, his hands releasing their grip on the front of Sherlock’s shirt and sliding down from his chest and sides of his stomach to curl his fingers and palms around his friend's lean hips, the pressure of his body against Sherlock becoming a much fiercer and hungrier echo of their earlier embrace. He tipped his head back to reach up to Sherlock's mouth.
Greg selected his message recipient and started typing. “You c’n come and watch me one weekend though, if you like,” he said casually, as he did so, not looking at Mycroft and so missing his slight jerk of shock. Greg paused to check the brief typed message through for any spelling mistakes and pressed
“Oh, don’t worry, I know, John," she had said, gently. "And even if you think you don't, you do too. You know exactly what I’m talking about.” She'd wiped her eyes with her sleeve. Now she was quiet and deathly calm; all her earlier guilty crying and asking for his understanding and forgiveness - she had asked him even as she had packed her bag - had passed. Like water passing under the bridge, he thought. She shook her arm out of his grip and said firmly, "Go to Sherlock, John. Just go to Sherlock and see if he can tell you what you already know." She almost said it kindly. And then she simply got into the back of the taxi, setting her bag on the seat beside her, and shut the door, leaving him standing alone on the pavement.
“Oh no, none at all. Goose is fine! Sounds lovely!” said John, before concentrating on taking an eye out of a potato. Then he continued, “I’ve never had it before, but I’d like really like to try it!”
"How badly? Where?" asked John sharply, seeing no visible wound on Sherlock's front, and in answer to John's question, Sherlock turned around to show John his back, whilst still in the act of shedding the coat.
Perfectly on cue, John scratched his nose and then said, "What've you just worked out then?” Like it might be something interesting, but not momentous, not earth-shattering.
but then he came back to himself again. He brought his hands up quickly, to pull Sherlock away from his neck, enjoying a moment of seeing Sherlock's shocked surprise before John took his friend's face gently between both his palms, and watched the expression dissolve as he leaned in and kissed Sherlock softly and lightly. Sherlock closed his eyes, in pleasure, like a stroked cat, and John closed his own eyes and kissed him again, slowing it right down; first feeling Sherlock's full lips with his own, and then tracing across them with the tip of his tongue, and then pressing his teeth into them lightly. At Sherlock’s soft rumble of appreciation, their kiss immediately intensified again, and John decided instantly it was time for a chair, or the sofa or the wall or anywhere; in fact,
John lowered the note again. “What?! Make some sense!” he said in exasperation, crossing his arms to listen, and still holding the note between his fingers.
“Ha ha ha,” spat Sherlock, deadpan, “Gosh, and how very droll you are, Mycroft!" he muttered, and he shook his head at his brother witheringly, pulling up his lip in a perfect imitation of said small child’s unpleasant sneer.
John went and stood behind him and he could see immediately that it was not as bad as it had first seemed. Just a very minor laceration, then, deep at the start but then less so as it went on, becoming more just a deep scratch which petered out to nothing, but it was clean, and should heal well. It did need to be cleaned up and covered properly, but was nothing to be overly concerned about. Hopefully. He put his hand on Sherlock's uninjured right shoulder to steady him before he pressed carefully just above and then just below the wound at the top. The blood was oozing slightly but not pouring, and it had already started to clot.
John stopped laughing eventually and looked at him with the laughter still lighting up his face. “Christ! I can't truthfully say that
John grinned in relief. “Oh, ok!” he said. Maybe Siger had been over-generous with the wine while stirring, he thought.
Greg snorted laughter and then his smile softened. “Listen,” he said warmly, “when I saw you at that party….” he paused and smiled more broadly. “Basically, I took one look at you and I knew I just wanted to knock you right off your haughty pedestal—” and here he actively grinned again, “—and stand underneath an' catch you.”
Sherlock squeezed his hand in return. “Then lead the way, John,” he said, with a quite different kind of smirk rising to his face. “I’m all yours.”
“Yes,” whispered back Mycroft, quite still too, on tenterhooks to hear what he knew Greg was going to say.
But Greg had thought nothing at all of his impulsive swooping kiss and was behaving perfectly normally. He grinned, delighted, at Mycroft. “You’re totally wasted in the British Government...” he remarked, still grinning, squeezing Mycroft’s fingers again.
“What you did…what you did to me…” Mycroft explained, equally out of breath. Greg rolled off Mycroft a little onto the empty side of the bed and one of his elbows, and stroked his other hand down Mycroft’s side. “You don’t ‘ave to—” Greg started, but Mycroft interrupted.
thought Mycroft, as Greg’s fingers slid down his body, but then as Greg made contact, Mycroft gasped and reciprocated the action immediately, with no forewarning, making Greg moan softly. “Oh,
"What's his name, anyway, this artist?" asked John suddenly, who had been thinking about some very similar art that he had seen some time before and quite liked.
Greg was bending down to the freezer, searching for ice, just as Mycroft walked into the kitchen and so Mycroft was presented with a surprising and wonderful view of his rear. Not only that, but he had taken off his outer jacket and suit jacket and slung both carelessly over the back of a chair at the kitchen table. As he straightened up, ice cube tray in hand, Mycroft delighted at the sight of his back and broad shoulders encased in his crisp, light-coloured shirt. He turned around and grinned, disarming Mycroft completely. “You may ask,” he said, mock seriously. “It’s their 15-year-old Speyside single malt. It’s very good,” he held out the half-full ice cube tray. “Ice?’ he asked, lifting his eyebrows.
thought Mycroft. He felt that he had been rather remiss and it really was time for a bit of mutual appreciation. “You’re
“Don't try and tell me you missed that bit!” John shot back quickly, and was rewarded with Sherlock bursting into laughter.
"Yes. Or at least, he did!…We call each other Gab,” she smiled, explaining it as an aside. “It’s…it’s a little joke we have...Anyway, it was he who provided the painting to decorate the entrance of Claridge's hotel for the visit of the emperor and empress of Japan. It was a massive stroke of luck to get that commission and it was only because he knew the general manager from somewhere - university, I think - and he asked Gab to do it as a favour.” She started to re-do her messy bun as she spoke. “It was a very popular piece, many wealthy clients saw it and liked it, and so he started to get commissions, the money started to roll in and then it started to roll out again even faster because now he
sending invisible sparks flying up John's arm and a shiver up John's back and the hairs on the nape of his neck rose up and now it was John's turn to gasp. He closed his mouth quickly and swallowed, and then opened it again to speak - without a clue of what he was going to say - but before he could even make a sound, Sherlock twisted quickly round on the chair, still holding John's forearm tightly, and he looked back and up over his shoulder at John and his gaze was like molten mercury. Hot and deadly and exhilarating.
and, with that, the absurdity of realising that everyone had been right about them - and about him - all along, then.
They sat at the kitchen table for the tea, mince pies and biscuits, and discussed how Christmas had been - for John, no discussion necessary, it had been absolutely terrible, but he stuck to his cover story and said it had been lovely again for the sake of politeness. For the Holmeses, Christmas had been either bearable, moronic, wonderful or tremendous; depending on which member of the family was answering the question.
But Greg was. “Ah, happy…er...Valentine’s Day!” he said, like he was pleased he’d remembered to say it.
Too early in the day for that!” she said to him cheerfully, taking a big gulp of her wine; as if it was really quite shocking to actually be offered water at dinner.
After a few hedonistic moments of fervent snogging and sliding, Greg decided the distribution of the oil was fairly even. Even enough for his purposes, anyway. “Lift up,” he breathed again. As Mycroft lifted his body from Greg’s, Greg shifted out from underneath him, turning onto his side to face Mycroft and pushing gently Mycroft back and off as he turned so Mycroft got the hint to do the same. Now they faced each other again, breathing hard, flushed and oiled up. “My sheets are never gonna recover from this…” said Greg cheerfully and he reached slowly down, diving the backs of his fingers down against Mycroft's stomach to take hold of his lover’s cock.
she controlling?” said John quietly to Sherlock, as they walked through to the small sitting room next door. Despite her last distinctly order-like instruction to Siger, she didn’t really seem controlling at all. Just very good at management.
But Sherlock, whether deliberately or not, misunderstood his question and said coolly, "If you like."
Greg was totally into this. “Yeah?” he said, in a challenging tone, as if he were a teenager about to get told off.
“Yes, a very funny thing to do, thank you for that little slice of amusement, Mother,” Sherlock commented drily, looking at it.
Sherlock was completely unfazed. He tossed his phone back down on the bed and stretched. “He may well have done as soon as he spoke to Greg. I’ve no idea how that went, but by then they were already both at Constantine’s, so…" he shrugged. "He didn’t go there knowing it was me who set it all up, that’s for sure…because he didn’t know that I knew about him and Greg…the thought that I might have had anything to do with it wouldn't have crossed his mind. My devious but brilliant plan worked.” And he sat back on the bed looking so bloody smug and pleased with himself.
Sherlock glanced up at him and stopped typing. He pulled a cynical face. “Well, that would be ludicrous, because it’s more than obvious it’s from me.”
John’s reply to that was to abruptly close the gap between them, letting go of Sherlock’s hand to sweep his own hand up the side of Sherlock’s face and cup the back of his head. At the same time, he came up quickly onto the balls of his feet, in a perfectly orchestrated movement to reach Sherlock’s mouth with his own. His other hand slid through Sherlock’s hair and down his neck as they kissed again passionately. The feel of Sherlock’s bare skin against his own was still unbelievably sensual. It was all so different to everything that John was used to, but John found himself revelling in the difference.
But Sherlock didn't want John to be thinking about Mary now, not in any way, shape or form, and so he closed his hand firmly over John's. John looked up at him.
So he had said, "Stay exactly where you are, John," and held up his hand, but his hand betrayed his thoughts and he realised as he did it, that his hand was not a flat palm warding John off, commanding him to stay back, to stop; in reality, his hand was reaching out, fingers outstretched, his hand was saying saying,
Sherlock and John could hear Siger asking Agatha politely about her journey, and she then began detailing the horrors of travelling long distance by public transport. John glanced over at Sherlock and said, “Shouldn't we go and…?” He inclined his head towards the kitchen, meaning
“Now we go to bed," replied John immediately, and Sherlock heard the decision and the order in John's voice and he liked it. He smiled a slow, soft smile and if John hadn't realised already that he loved Sherlock, was
My thanks to Jae_Blaze and StarsAndStitches, who both saw that something vital was missing from this chapter and patiently beta-read my changes (over and over again) as I tried to make it right...😊
This was abruptly made quite apparent, as the sounds of an argumentative discussion suddenly erupted from the depths of the house; undoubtedly the row would lead the way to the kitchen. John stopped in the hallway and glanced at Siger questioningly. "Sherlock and Mycroft have started already..." offered Siger woefully with a helpless shrug, and he turned to lead the way. Of course he was used to hearing the constant bickering between his sons, and it wasn't like John
On the way downstairs, Sherlock told John that before special event dinners like this one, his family always had drinks in the sitting room.
Greg really liked this table too, as it went. “So,” said Greg, smiling, after they’d sat down. “The note. I was really surprised that you—”
real.’ He still could hardly believe it. The red marks he had made on Sherlock’s chest and neck glowed softly against his pale skin. They would be the evidence then, for this case. He must have smiled a little at that because Sherlock, who was watching him closely, asked, “What?”
But maybe now was the time to break all the rules. “Of course,” he said smoothly. “Only not too much…It’s my favourite.” He lifted an eyebrow and smiled.
Burnham-on-Crouch is a real place in England. So is Essex. ‘Country Living’ is also a real magazine. I am also (definitely) real but I am not John's ex-girlfriend. Sigh. (If only)…😍
Sherlock unbuttoned the top of his shirt. As he did so, he said, "Don't fuss, John, it's only a flesh wound, it's nothing." He pulled the shirt open to expose the wound. His shirt was stuck to his skin with the blood. Below the pale ridge of Sherlock's left clavicle was a short, deep, diagonal cut, gently oozing dark blood. It was almost half the width of a Stanley blade. It wasn't massive, but it wasn't nothing. John didn't know how deep it was and he didn't like it. "Stab or cut?" John asked fiercely.
She made an impatient lip noise. “If you feel you really must," she said, and she had one of those deep, gruff aristocratic voices. They came and stood beside her to look, Sherlock standing on her right and John on her left. John noticed with interest that she was painting with her left hand as she laid down her brush briefly at their interruption.
…” moaned John, damp with sweat, with Sherlock’s saliva on his neck, with the clear slick from Sherlock’s cock smeared silky wet across his fingers and his palm.
“What did it say?” demanded Greg. Despite the situation, a newly-awakened part of Mycroft’s mind was finding Gregory’s Detective Inspector’s interrogation…
“Gab?" asked John, as suddenly something new clicked into place. “Wait - does he sometimes call himself ‘Gab’, professionally?”
“Come over here and I’ll tell you all about what I’ll do if you don’t…” rumbled back Sherlock Holmes, self-proclaimed consulting detective, red hot genius and newly-knighted Sex God.
if you really want to call them that. One from Mycroft to Greg, and one from Greg to Mycroft. I made the booking in the name of Holmes over a month ago. I knew Greg would get there early. Mycroft always arrives exactly on the dot, and Greg’s never late for an appointment. Plus, I phoned the restaurant last night to check they were both there on Mycroft’s favourite table at 8.20, as I’d requested, and they were. Quite happily enjoying their evening. So. It’s all
true, thought John, but Sherlock was showing no sign of stopping yet.) “…The bottom edge of the spine is scuffed from repeated pressure and rubbing against a rough surface…” Sherlock continued, “…most likely fabric, given by the slight grey/blue staining, so no doubt you frequently rest it against your knee for support as you read it.” He gestured vaguely at the book which John still held loosely on his lap, on top of the bag of scones. “… And if that isn’t enough, along with the three biscuit crumbs in the crease of that page, there is a minute smear of raspberry jam near the page number at the bottom right - you’d wiped it off but I could see the shine on the page - that’s from the edge of your thumb where you held the book open with your right hand, resting the bottom edge of the spine on your knee, no doubt while you held your mug and drank your tea with the your left hand while you read.”
Sherlock said something else about the practicalities of using boiled linseed oil and she started to laugh. Like her voice, her laugh was rusty - it didn’t sound like it got used very much.
“It’s not terribly difficult…” he muttered and came back over to stand with John. “Ok?” he asked quietly, offering John another canapé from the plate.
fuckin’ like it…” he murmured the last few words deliberately harshly in a low, slow growl. His voice was gravelly, the words flung out to smoulder in the already stoked up fireplace of Mycroft’s desire. And as for what he actually said…well, Mycroft
Greg however, had had almost enough of his favourite scotch by now to feel that it was time for some action. He said nothing, just held Mycroft’s suit jacket on one arm for a moment, looking at him with obvious pleasure, his eyes deliberately half-lidded and with
Sherlock had Just been about to remind John what the day was, but suddenly right now was not the time. He sat up completely, facing John, and now interrupted
So. Then, there followed nearly two years out in the field, under Mycroft, under other orders - alongside others and on his own - seeking them all out. Sometimes he won, sometimes he lost, but he never
While Sherlock was in the shower, John made the bed, got dressed and then shot out  - on the excuse of getting some milk - which they did in fact need, but he also needed to pick up a little something that he had arranged to collect that morning from J. Guiviers, the music shop round the corner.
To Mycroft’s immediate left, next to the slightly ajar en-suite door, hung a set of floor to ceiling thick, dark green curtains; patterned with a paler green and a delicate gold brocade - very William Morris, thought Mycroft approvingly. The hems were overlong and crumpled artistically on the floor - clearly deliberately to prevent draughts slipping underneath - so Mycroft knew instantly therefore that a large French window or small balcony must lie behind them. The room itself was painted a dark, rich green colour on two walls, much like the deep green shade of the curtains, with a lighter one on the other two, and the bedclothes were of a similar shade to the walls, but a richer, warmer green, perhaps a little lighter.
When Ian the ticket inspector reached their carriage six minutes later, he glanced in through the little window in the connecting carriage door for a moment - right before he pressed the door-release button, like he always did before he opened the doors - and then stopped short with his hand hovering frozen just in front of the button.
because it has basically been a right bastard for me to write. Only because I’ve been writing it for nearly a year, on and off. I don’t even know why it's taken me so long. And I don’t know whether to apologise for this or not, but I hope the fact that it is an 8,816 word sex-scene will make up for the length of time it has taken me to write and publish it.
It was only in the kitchen, mid-way through selecting some mugs, that John wondered how long before he could safely suggest the idea of a double date. He didn't know about Sherlock, but he quite fancied a trip back to Constantine’s. The duck there had been amazing.
And so here he was. Thinking. Not lying down on the sofa where he would prefer to be, but still thinking nonetheless. He couldn't steeple his fingers either because to John that would also be a clear sign that he was thinking and John might ask what about. He flicked the newspaper in irritation at his lack of progress.
would you—” John was so horrified he went a bit high-pitched. But Sherlock didn’t look like he thought he’d done anything wrong, so John took a breath and calmed down and pressed on. “—Ok, so you’ve forged a note from Greg to meet Mycroft? I can’t—” he stopped again and flung his hands up, suddenly imagining the carnage. “He’s gonna go mental! They’re both gonna go mental when they find out!"
John saw that Sherlock was annoyed now, so he attempted to make a joke to smooth the sudden atmosphere. “So are you getting these injuries on purpose for a bit of special attention?” asked John from the kitchen, rummaging in the freezer and half-smiling as he spoke.
“No, don’t,” gasped Mycroft, clutching at Greg’s shirt as Greg licked lightly up the side of his neck to the angle of his jaw. “Leave it. It’s wonderful in here with the moon streaming in. It’s simply gorgeous…”
John didn't pray exactly, but if you counted wishing for something every morning and every night as praying, then yes, he had prayed. For Sherlock to come back and be
He was so astonishingly right that John's indignant anger was almost obliterated. Almost. He offered no praise for that deduction though, and he crossed his arms without realising he'd done it.
“Really? Oh, that’s...that’s good,” said Greg. “I...erm...I like saying it...you know... sometimes.”
"The head chef. He's in on it. I already knew that but I needed proof. Unfortunately though, he was onto me. He’d heard my voice and seen me speaking with the manager earlier but he was out of sight and I didn’t know he was there."
“Er...er, yes. Guest bedroom, yes…” said Sherlock vaguely. He looked at John. Then he swirled into action, almost appearing to shake his head briskly to clear it. His eyes flicked to John's face. “Want to see my room?” he asked mischievously.
replied Mycroft slowly, in an amused but regretful tone. “It seems to be a fading trend, somewhat. Perhaps I should endeavour to reintroduce it.”
moment about using the ensuite bathroom, they ended up back on and then in Greg’s bed, first both wearing Greg’s bathrobes and then both not.
The light was lower, and even more deeply golden as they walked back; Sherlock wheeling the bicycle and trailer, John lugging the rucksack and easel, and Gabriella with her fold-up stool and the painting that she had been working on in a carrying frame. As they walked, Gabriella pointed out previous views and aspects of the landscape which she had painted before.
It was exactly the right thing to say. She was clearly thrilled to be asked. “Well!” she began brightly, reaching for more wine to top up her glass before it was even empty, “I’ve just been updating my little scorecard! Before we sat down, Broad tried to play across the line to a full Yorker, but got a leading edge and was strangled in the slip cordon—” not following a word of this, John glanced quickly at Sherlock and raised his eyebrows. Sherlock was paying Agatha and the cricket situation absolutely no mind at all and he simply smiled one of his little sideways smiles at John. He was often amused when John was amused, John decided. “—And so he was out for a bloody duck!” Agatha finished, waggling the bottle at them, in an ‘offering more’ fashion. They both held up a hand to refuse it, John’s glass being still practically full and Sherlock not drinking any.
He loved Gregory’s tentative gesture. He released the glass and took his hand away from it, taking Gregory’s fingers with him. On the tablecloth, unheeded by glassware, they lightly held hands like a couple of love-struck teenagers. Greg grinned at him and Mycroft found himself actually grinning back.
from Greg, it’s from me.” He scrubbed his face with his hands and yawned and stretched a bit to wake up properly.
“Oh, a cup of Yorkshire please,” said Mycroft gratefully, “it’s my favourite brand of tea. I’m almost unable to function without a good cup of Yorkshire to start with.”
When Sherlock released his hand, John swept his fingers and then his thumb across the full curves of Sherlock's lips and on up along his jawline, to cup his hand around the back of Sherlock's skull and pull him back down to his mouth again to prove it.
Sherlock stepped away from the desk to go and sit on his unmade bed. He picked up his phone from where it was charging on the bedside table to check his texts. “Mmmm. Yes,” he said distractedly, suddenly beginning to text in his usual frantic way. Now he had moved, John noticed that also on top of the chest of drawers, there was a very good sketch of the front of Holmes house made in graphite pencil and on heavy cartridge paper. It was propped slightly askew against an atlas of historical sea charts. The edges of the paper were slightly curled and it had obviously been there for some time. John couldn’t make out the signature but it looked vaguely familiar, so he went back over to look closely, and saw with surprise that it was Sherlock’s. “Wow! This is really good!” he said admiringly, picking it up carefully by the edges. “When did you do this?” The signature, while definitely Sherlock’s, wasn’t Sherlock’s current one; although the name was clear and the handwriting similar, it was very obviously a more child-like hand.
A comfortable moment of silence passed as the train rattled on through the night and over a level crossing. John was thinking about what kind of people their parents must have been to saddle their almost identical twins with almost identical names.
With his left hand and forearm he reached round, gripping hard and tight around Mycroft’s arse and hip and back, and swiftly pulled him close, deftly controlling the angle and position of Mycroft’s cock with his other hand. With both his hands, his grip was fierce, but his mouth and tongue were gentle. Mycroft sucked in air in a sharp gasp and almost sighed it out in a long, low, shuddering moan. His own hands and long fingers tentatively found their way to Greg’s broad shoulders, his neck, the side of his face, feeling the stubble on his jaw, his hair…his gorgeous,
"Oh, right, I see,” said John, vaguely, thinking, 'And you wanted to play in it just before you brought me up here. Why was that?' He didn't ask though.
"Oh, well, won't hold you up then. You ok, though?" From anyone else in their situation having just made a remark like John's, the question,
Sherlock obediently got in and John got in after him. John did not know why he was so angry. He sat opposite Sherlock on the fold-back seat so he could watch Sherlock's face for any sign of shortness of breath or sweating or a sudden increase in Sherlock's usual paleness, and he glared at him.
When Mycroft came to pull him from the Serbian hell hole, twittering gaily in his ear that he was 'back to Baker Street', the pain of the beating he had just received faded into insignificance. He had smiled. Actually smiled for the first time in what felt like months, despite the pain he was in at the time. Oh, the pain was present, it was still agonisingly real and
“Yah,” she replied and she brought it into his office. Mycroft made no move to take it so she deposited it on his desk. “Hand delivered,” she added, mysteriously, as she put it down. Mycroft glanced at it in consternation. Plain business style white envelope, no cellophane window, rather cheap stationery, his full name hand-written in a hand that he didn't recognise, right-handed writer, in a rush, black Bic biro, the word
Greg rounded the doorframe slowly and silently, peering round it cautiously a bit first, to see if Mycroft was awake. He was wearing a fleecy blue and grey checked dressing gown in a thick heavy fabric, and his hair he seemed to have simply brushed back roughly with his hands, just as Mycroft had. His feet were bare. To Mycroft, he looked
She opened the cottage front door as Sherlock led the bike and trailer away down the alleyway, and she deposited the stool and the canvas carrying case into a specially designed holding box just inside the front door, against the wall, next to which stood a pair of ancient red Hunter wellies, lightly covered in drying mud.
Sherlock's mouth opened slightly but he didn't say anything. John waited, eyebrows raised. He didn't ask if Sherlock was ok, he knew this look well enough - he just waited. Sherlock could be thinking about anything. Christ, he could be mysteriously be putting two and two together on a cold case about a stolen work of art and a lost kitten that had happened six years ago.
And in the dream, Sherlock's voice had come softly from somewhere behind him, over his shoulder, in his ear, in a whisper as intimate as a lover’s, and Sherlock had said, “No, John. You're not.” It was like a premonition. He woke up with a start and with tears on his face.
Mycroft, I don’t stand a bloody chance!” he moaned. Mycroft replied by pressing his own body reciprocally harder against Greg’s. And for each of them there was absolutely no doubt about the other’s delight. Mycroft had deduced (correctly, of course) that Gregory Lestrade was very auditorily focused. Well, incidental deductions like that one really couldn’t be helped. One was a Holmes, after all.
“Oh hello, John, how was Tesco’s?” replied John sarcastically, struggling to extract his key from the door, laden with shopping bags. “Let me help you with those bags…”
“Oh! Bugger, was that the last thing you wrote?” John asked, grabbing the milk to put it straight in the fridge. “I couldn't decipher it. It looked a bit like ‘cat food’ but I didn’t think it was that. I tried ringing you but you didn't answer.”
‘He’s thinking again,’ John realised, as he closed the gate behind him and set foot on the pavement after Sherlock, turning briefly once to raise a hand to their new acquaintances as the front door closed, and this suspicion was confirmed by the lack of chat between them as they walked briskly towards the station, following Clarissa’s directions. Thinking about that, John tried to start a conversation; mentioning how he’d twigged Clarissa’s accent because he’d known a guy at med school who was from rural Suffolk, from just outside of Ipswich, whose accent sounded very similar to Clarissa’s. But Sherlock barely responded. “Oh,” was all he said, vaguely, not really listening. John let it go. Clearly he wasn’t in the mood for talking.
"There's so much to paint here...” Gabriella said, waving her hand over to indicate the soft beginnings of dusk on the horizon. “…Endless subjects and ever-changing scenes. That's why I love this place. You'd have thought I'd have wanted to get away from it after everything, but I don't. I really don't."
Their bodies and limbs entangled, they kissed again and again. Their hands worked on each other with a growing urgency and the moments seemed intense and endless. It occurred to Mycroft the odd sensation that time was not so much standing still, but continuing to happen outside the room.
Sherlock held up a miniature note pad between finger and thumb with a scornful look on his face. He hadn’t put his paper hat on.
Sherlock started to say, “John, thank you, I’m nearly out of rosin and this is…” and then he saw that John had very carefully scratched a little heart on the surface of the rosin tablet with a pin. Sherlock smiled even more, looking down at it, turning it in his palm with his other hand so that the heart faced the right way up. John had thought he’d take the piss about the heart-thing, and immediately after he’d done it, he was a bit embarrassed that it was going too far, but since seeing how Sherlock had gone to so much trouble with getting the scarf, arranging it secretly in that heart shape on the bed, and the thing with the chocolate and the home-made card…well, nothing could be embarrassing now, he thought.
“Now who’s Secret Squirrel?” asked Sherlock, getting the caffetiere down from the cupboard, but he didn’t press for anything more. They had to have some secrets from each other.
Mycroft nodded quickly to indicate he was following the story and that Greg should continue. So Greg did. “Yeah, well, anyway, Sherlock realised that the bloke was
said Greg seriously, eyes widening, and Mycroft laughed. He had to get him back somehow. Greg couldn’t make all the jokes.
“We-ll, it's mainly because I owe the gallery owner a favour," replied Sherlock casually, "she has been incredibly helpful in the past. ‘The Case of the Octogenarian Art Fraudster,’ I think you named it on your blog - do you remember that one? And she happened to ask me very nicely."
John couldn't drink his coffee. He got up carefully from the table, poured a glass of water, and went back to bed, where he drank half the glass of water in one go and then put it down carefully on his bedside table. Then he just as carefully got into bed again and pulled the duvet slowly up over his ear. He could only lay on his right side, as the bump on the left side made it too painful to lay that way, and it was so sore that he could feel it when he laid on his back, even when he turned his head to the right. Because of this, he was lying facing the window, his back to the door, and he only realised that Sherlock was in his doorway when Sherlock pushed the door softly all the way open. John heard the familiar soft creak of it opening and sensed Sherlock was just standing there, but John wasn't sure what to do or what to say, so he did nothing and said nothing. He just lay still and waited to see what Sherlock was going to say. But, like him, Sherlock didn't say a single word. He came over and sat softly down on the edge of John's bed, making the mattress dip under the extra weight. His back where he sat down was pressed against John's.
But Greg interrupted him. “Nor do I,” he said gently. He paused, then he said seductively, “Come ‘ere and let me knock you off your pedestal…”
“They need drops three times a day, dear,” explained Agatha to John, like he should have known, and then turning to Siger, she asked, "Siggy-darling, did you manage to do their drops this morning?"
as you put it….” he looked around him on the bed, moving the crumpled duvet and bedspread aside. “Where’s my phone gone?”
“Get out of it!” laughed Greg, hoping she couldn't tell he was blushing. Sally would just about keel over if she knew who it was really from. “The ex-Mrs. Lestrade, you mean! Anyway, if it was from ‘er, I’d be setting fire to it right now!” Too late Greg realised he’d left the empty envelope on top of the pile of paperwork.
"On the wall—“ Sherlock started, and gestured at it expansively without looking over at it, “—all those photographs, two particularly, the black and white pair." John looked over at them, he had just scanned past them when they came in, had missed looking closely at the black and white photos amongst all the others - his attention caught more by the huge and strikingly-coloured painting of a stylised Bengal tiger stalking through fantastical trees in a forest at night. The colours of the painting were unworldly bright and at the top of the picture, the sky was dark blue but with a strangely luminescent crescent moon. The painting dominated the wall and grabbed the eye, holding it so firmly that John had completely missed looking closely at any of the photos.
He stood looking at it for a moment, breathing a bit, and then he marched into the bedroom and stood in the doorway. “Who’s this from?” he asked, calmly, but clearly in a state of slight
have admitted to a soul how he felt about Sherlock, before or even after it was too late; even after Sherlock had died on the pavement before him and John had thought that he was gone and lost to him forever. Not admitted it to his bereavement counsellor; not to Ella, his therapist; not to himself, and now, here was Sherlock
Mycroft could not keep his other hand out of Greg’s hair. Like being attracted by magnetic forces, his fingers were drawn to it, and once again, he made another gentle fist of the soft silver strands and pulled a little. Greg moaned, his hand on Mycroft’s cock squeezing hard and speeding up. At the same time, his other hand slipped under Mycroft’s shoulder and dug his fingers in, making Mycroft groan out a little in return.
Watching Sherlock pretend to be someone else was actually quite fascinating. He took someone else's mannerisms and speech patterns and raised and lowered and worked his voice like a musical instrument enthusiastically producing a completely different sound. He actually briefly became someone else. He could have been an actor, thought John, watching him discreetly and listening as Sherlock won the artist round. She had stopped painting to listen to him and was now agreeing vehemently with something Sherlock was saying about the colour of Burnt Umber versus Deep Sienna for these sorts of ‘mud-heavy’ landscapes.
They had to change trains once, but by lunchtime, they reached Burnham-on-Crouch; a small, pretty coastal town on the edge of an estuary that time forgot. They got off the train and began to walk. It was lovely - and just as John remembered it. It was quiet and interesting, full of old buildings and white, weather-boarded fisherman's cottages. Sherlock said nothing whilst John admired the scenery and the architecture. John knew this area vaguely well, thanks to the ex-girlfriend, and he began to relay an anecdote back to Sherlock that she had told him, about the history of the village (and one pub in particular) which had been an infamous smugglers’ meeting point, until Sherlock snapped at him about his historical knowledge being wildly inaccurate and so John, finally really pissed off with Sherlock, just shut up and fumed silently.
And so here they were. And John was sure - he had never been more sure about anything in his life - that this was
At John’s side, Sherlock muttered, “Of course you are…” making John nudge his ankle with his heel to shut him up.
Sherlock narrowed his eyebrows at her suspiciously, and then looked the other way, tossing the notepad onto the table with a disgusted flick of his wrist.
“Well…here we are then!” said Greg, voicing his thought, purely to make Mycroft smile, even if just out of politeness.
“But…ok, but what did he say?" asked John, surprised, because Sherlock didn't usually pass up any excuse to shine his brilliant deductive light in John’s general direction. Sherlock didn’t seem too keen on telling him exactly what had happened, for some strange reason. "Oh, he was very erudite - he largely just swore copiously,” replied Sherlock after a moment, in a flippant, sarcastic tone, now folding the paper back and scanning the inside front page. John waited for more but it was clear Sherlock had finished speaking.
The maitre’d looked up and smiled in a welcoming but not-making-too-much-of-a-fuss way as Mycroft approached him. “Mr. Holmes,” he said, tipping his head in a courteous almost bow, “Please come this way, Mr. Lestrade is waiting for you in the bar,” and he stepped away from the desk to lead Mycroft towards it. ‘He’s a member, even?’ pondered Mycroft as he followed the maitre’d.
and they clung to each other desperately. It was like all the goodbyes they had never had, reversed into one big
“Good,” said Greg. “So am I.” Greg moved in then, deliberately slowly, planting one polished, chocolate-brown Cheaney boot on either side of Mycroft’s shiny black Oxford brogues. “And I'm not jokin’ around now, I mean it,” he continued. “What else can I do to please you, Mycroft?” His voice was a dark, seductive whisper and Mycroft could barely breathe.
whimpered John vaguely, looking down and rubbing his forehead, so much more than just slightly flustered now. His erection had begun to make itself very undeniably known. He shifted in his seat again and took a short, sharp breath. "There's something going on here with us right now and I don't quite know how to handle it," John admitted.
