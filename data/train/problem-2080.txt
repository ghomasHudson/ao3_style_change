"The gesture… he used the knowledge of your family's tradition, yet there is nothing here to suggest manipulation." The brunette's eyes continued to scan the room while John made his way to his usual seat with his tea at hand. "What am I missing?"
And there, in all its glory, stood a gigantic fir tree adorned with lights and baubles. On the very top was a beautiful silver star. He had never seen such a glorious tree in his life. He doubted that the Queen herself had ever owned such a treasure. Yet here it was… in his living room.
John let out a small chuckle. "But he was only four!"
"No, no, no," Sherlock began, wagging his finger in the other man's direction. "You don't understand. It's all a game for him. He makes it look as if he is being unselfish and kind because it's Christmas." His face cringed at the sound of the holiday. "The gifts he gives are used as a device to manipulate you in some way. He turns you into his pawn, and you end up doing exactly what he wants you to without you even knowing it." John watched as the younger man began to examine every bit of their flat, evidently looking for something.
"John," Sherlock repeated again, slowly moving closer to the door.
Before John could completely wrap his mind around this new development, he could feel his chin being lowered, his eyes meeting Sherlock's directly, his pupils dilated. The other man's expression was one John had seen so many times before. It was the face that, in the past, had driven John crazy. It was his "we both know what's going on" face. Only this time, John actually knew exactly what was going on.
"There must be something else," Sherlock insisted. "Think, John!" He stopped his pacing and gazed directly at his friend. The sitting man could feel Sherlock's piercing eyes staring at him with such intensity that it caused him to shiver slightly. John meekly looked up from his cup. "Does anything look strange to you? Anything out of the ordinary?"
John's breath hitched when the reality sunk in. Mycroft had planted mistletoe in their apartment.
"D'you ever think that maybe he might be doing something nice for once? No ulterior motives." John knew that there was no point in asking such a thing, but he did enjoy the look he received from Sherlock. Actually, he enjoyed just about any look that Sherlock gave him.
"Absolutely not. The butcher still thinks I'm some sort of nutter! Probably thinks I get off on pig intestines or something." John was frozen in place, beginning to wonder why Sherlock was getting terribly close.
“What’s got you like this?”
“All in good time. I’m still tracking down something to lift these crazy suppressants you’re on. I do know a good chemist, but he hates me. Still, worth a shot.” The man began texting, presumably the chemist, his phone close to his face.
“‘Short and painful’ is how I like to describe you. Not a bad idea for a chest tattoo, either, if you’re shopping.”
Watson gave him an appraising look before deciding on an honest answer. “In a perfect world, I would continue the career I have and there would be no alpha to control me. We don’t live in a perfect world.”
Sherlock made an uncommitted sound at the outfit presented. It was only a marginal improvement, but apparently John was intractable in his wantonness.
“Moran? As in Sebastian Moran?”
“You. You are irritating me.”
Sherlock did not acknowledge those fair points.
“I am open to the suggestions of this council. But I think between all the minds in this room, some solution could be found that would be agreeable.”
He nodded. “So long as the arrangement amuses you.”
Mycroft continued. “I am glad. And with you now here, I would like to review my plans regarding your future. I have assembled a sizable list of potential suitors for you-” John nearly choked on his apple turnover at that. Mycroft had been his alpha for less than a day, how many suitors could he have possibly found? “-and I would like to introduce these, let us call them candidates, to you very casually. As the situation is in flux, I don’t want you getting attached to anyone before things are settled. These introductions will simply give them a chance to see and smell you properly but will be no more cumbersome than that. I would advise you always try to make a good impression, they could be your future bondmate, but thankfully you aren’t the sort who needs such a reminder.”

“No, Mr. Parker, you are quite right. My area is the military. And we do not intend to let a good and needed soldier be dragged away when he wants to stay.”
“Transport has the ring of an interesting explanation.”
James didn’t know nearly enough about the people making up the opposition, but of those he recognized, it wasn’t good. The alpha politicians especially worried him. They would likely be traditionalists, bonded to perfectly demure omegas and not at all open to the arguments he planned to make. The betas in the room were still swing votes, and he was relying on them, because as expected, there wouldn’t be a single omega present to offer so much as coffee, let alone insight. It grated him. He had hoped they could at least get some omega-rights activist politicians in the room, but no such luck under the pressed timeline. Why the Iceman was there was beyond James. He always categorized Mycroft Holmes as more of a bureaucratic spy than anything, and it seemed against his reputation to take interest in the matter of an RAMC captain’s fate.
, while pulling at John’s coat ineffectively. He was more focused on sucking that divine neck for everything he was worth, but John managed to roll them, straddling Sebastian a moment while he sat up to divest himself of the coat before leaning back into the kiss. Sebastian smiled against John’s lips and flipped him back into position. He loved to see his omega eager, but John could be on top some other time. Tonight, Sebastian wanted to control when they were done.
“Initially? As in the first of many such sessions between the three of us?”
“The very same.”
A hot spear of panic lanced John’s spine, but blessedly it seemed Victor was content to use him as a masturbatory tool for now. That or the drugs had made the alpha too uncoordinated for anything more vile. John turned his head away from the man, unfortunately exposing more of his own neck and focused on a painting of ships on the wall. Victor rutted up against John’s hip, eventually working his cock out of his trousers to stroke himself, all the while smelling and licking and sucking John’s neck.
slipped out. A confrontation would not help John.
He didn’t want her drinking herself blind with guilt when everything had turned out fine. He wouldn’t want that even if everything had gone to shit, but it’d be especially pointless now. Her voice box was full, so he just texted her the good news, and practically begged that she call him. God, he hoped she wasn’t in some terrible mess, or dangerous place, refusing to ask him for help. He paced, trying to think what to do, before calling Clara. It was a bit of a moving target, given how on-again off-again she was with his sister, but he didn’t have a great back up plan.
A picky omega was one thing, and at least this one had the qualifications to warrant it but Mycroft felt that abstaining from a bond entirely was untenable for the solider. It occurred to him that Sherlock would be an ideal solution. His brother had no interest whatsoever in omegas or sex of any kind. They could couple for one heat to form the bond, and after would be free to go their separate ways. Watson could serve to his heart’s content on his dosage of military suppressants while Sherlock’s discretionary fund could grow steadily off the military pension. The captain would be thrilled.

“Colonel Moran does not want children.”
“So yes, you would have helped him.”
“I did tell you of Captain Watson’s willfulness. He is not a submissive omega. I was under the impression that you found such characteristics attractive.”
“I see.” There was a pause. “Did you say you woke up in the afternoon?”
I felt the first chapter got a little bogged in exposition at times, so hopefully this one starts things rolling more. And Bill Murray will never let you down.
“Yes.”
“Since our first case, when you said his name. I didn’t know he had you there by force when he asked for my help. He said his new omega had very strong suppressants that needed to be lifted. I merely saw it as a challenging piece of chemistry.”
“Right, sorry, I’ll shut up.”
“Why?” a red-faced man barked out.
Charts are very important, and all doctors hate doing them. They are the notes doctors write for patient medical records and they are not the fun part of medicine. I have it on extremely good authority that they royally suck and take lots of time. I suspect John’s charts are beautiful and thorough, cause that is just how he copes with stuff he doesn’t want to do.
I close my eyes, remembering the next part. How I have longed to say those words to you. Every cell, every pore, has been screaming for me to tell you what you mean to me. I’ve been afraid. I’m still afraid, John. But maybe, maybe you sensed it? Did you? My conductor of light? You, who still knows me better than anyone, did you hear it?
“That’s it, love, yes, come for me, come now.”
“Mmm.” Sherlock rubbed his nose under John’s ear, pressing his lips to that spot that always made him shiver. John sighed. “I wanted to kill the bastard,” Sherlock growled in a low voice.
“Sherlock, the paramedics are here. You have to let go,” Mycroft says, his tone somber.
“John!”
John sucked in a breath and tightened his grip in Sherlock’s hair, pulling him close. He tilted his head up as Sherlock leaned down, meeting in a crushing kiss that left them both breathless. John broke away, pausing to press kisses to one cheekbone then the other, before pulling away and stripping down to his pants.
Sherlock seems to be similarly affected. With each command, the flush of that pale skin grows impossibly deeper, those pale eyes darkening to a smoky green. Sherlock is breathing harder than normal, and from this vantage point, John can tell his pulse is elevated. John wonders what he’d do if he flipped them right now, crawled over his body and pressed his lips to that gorgeous mouth.
“Jo-John?” Sherlock’s voice is shaking.
Sherlock’s voice is wrecked. There is a depth of emotion swimming in those pale eyes, clouded with unshed tears. John wants to stroke that face, caress those sharp cheekbones he’s always dreamed of touching. He wants to smooth away the tears that are threatening to fall. John is amazed by Sherlock’s feelings. He never could have dreamed he meant this much to him. It was almost worth being shot to see this, John thinks. John is grateful he was able to protect him. It was his turn.
“You have been spending a lot of time out of the flat and not telling him much, and then he asks you out, finally might I add, and you say you’re ‘busy’? Yeah, I’m pretty sure he thinks that’s what you meant.”
John held the newspaper up in front of his face, scanning the print for anything of interest. He hoped to find something, anything, that could constitute a case worthy of his madman of a flatmate. He’d been dealing with Sherlock’s mercurial mood for the last two days. Two days of stroppy fits, massive pouts, and flying dressing gowns. In truth, John knew what it was Sherlock really needed, but he was not going to give in so easily. He wanted Sherlock to ask for things instead of acting like an overgrown toddler.
John stepped closer, placing his hand on Sherlock’s waist, his fingers lightly brushing against the waistband of his trousers. “Mmm. I do. And maybe, you like me too?”
“John,” Sherlock sighs, “was that your idea of revenge?”
Sherlock turns back towards the car, perplexed by the emotion he hears in Mycroft’s voice. Emotion, from Mycroft?
Sherlock laughed, the full-bodied booming laugh that was reserved only for one person. “I said insults, John, not fantasies.”
“Of course we need to keep you under observation for a while, make sure there is no internal bleeding. And I’d like a cardiologist to check out your heart to make sure everything is healing well. But if everything goes well, I’d say a couple of weeks, give or take.”
“John --”
“Brilliant,” John says, walking up to where Sherlock is standing with Lestrade with the victim. “Are we done here?”
“It was never just the mistletoe, Sherlock.”
“Sherlock. I think you’re being silly. Just tell him. I’m sure it will be fine, John likes you, I know it.”
A page from John's Journal...
“No,” Sherlock whispered.
“Soo, laddie, was it something ah seid?”
Sherlock spreads his legs wider, his arousal building higher and higher in his belly. “Yes, John,” He moans, throwing his head back as John lightly circles his hole. Oh god, does he want this. He shifts his hips lower, causing John’s finger to slip in, both of them groaning at the intrusion, before John sinks his mouth back down on his cock.
Sherlock feels the cold drizzle on his hole and shivers, which quickly turn to shudders as John circles his hole again, pushing two fingers inside, opening him up. John’s other hand is intertwined with Sherlock’s on the sofa, supporting him as Sherlock rocks his hips, chasing his pleasure at John’s touch. Two fingers soon turn to three, and when John brushes against his prostate and his vision goes blurry, he knows he needs John inside him now.
. The thought of you brings a peal of joy into my heart. Are you still on the tarmac? Did you hear the news? Do you know I am coming back, coming home?
Mary levels the gun coolly at Sherlock, this time aiming for his forehead. That won’t do, he’d planned for another chest wound, the kevlar heavy where it rests under his suit. A head shot would be most...unfortunate. Still, Mycroft would protect John. He’d promised.
“Come for me Sherlock,” John panted, sucking hard on Sherlock’s neck.
John went to his knees
“Couldn’t.” Sherlock mumbled, his mouth pressed against John’s neck.
“Nothing. Just thinking how beautiful you are.”
“Breathe, John,” Sherlock whispered. “I’ve got you.” He slowly took John’s cock back in his mouth bobbing his head and sucking harder.
Sherlock nestles back down onto John’s chest. He knows eventually they will have to move, to clean up, but for now, he is content to be where he is. His last conscious thought before he drifts off is just how much he loves the beach.
“Sherlock Holmes. I’m a...relative..of Dr Watson. How is he?”
Sherlock stiffens. “John,” he cries, his hand on John’s prick going still as he pours his release over John’s skin, hot, and sticky and perfect.
John reaches out and grabs Sherlock’s left hand, kissing the platinum band nestled snugly there. “Home,” he says, entwining their fingers.
He reaches John’s side and begins to inspect the damage. At first, nothing looks amiss,  no visible wounds in the lower extremities, or thankfully, in the head. John seems to be merely passed out, lying on his back, eyes closed, gun still cradled in his hand. Sherlock reaches out and removes the weapon, slipping the safety on before tucking it into the pocket of his coat. In case the police do show up, he doesn’t need any additional trouble. Not that he couldn’t get Mycroft to smooth things over with Lestrade, but still the extra worry is not necessary at the moment.
“Sherlock.” John stopped him before he got too far, not interested in apologies. There was a more important question that needed an answer. “Had you done that before, come up to the room in the middle of the night to soothe Amy?”
“Thank you. Thank you for staying. I need you. I’d be lost without you, John.”
John looks up, then turns his head to catch Sherlock’s eyes. He can’t believe what he has just heard. Why? That’s all he wants to know. Why would she deliberately hurt him? A contract is one thing. A vile thing, yes. But to admit to wanting Sherlock dead, beyond an external reason? John cannot fathom it. Sherlock seems to be pleading with him, his eyes containing an emotion he has not seen before crossing those pale green irises. John is awed by the depth of compassion he sees. It’s a look that John would love to explore,  if he wasn’t standing in the middle of a tense standoff with his lying, murderous wife.
“The East Wind takes us all in the end...it seeks out the unworthy and plucks them the Earth,” I’d said. You’d smiled at me then, but did you hear it?
,” Sherlock moaned, releasing John’s cock to grasp him firmly by the hips and slam harder into John’s body. There would be bruises and he would surely feel this in the morning, but John really couldn’t care less. Sherlock gave one final hard thrust and came, yelling John’s name in a low growl that almost made John wish for another round. Sherlock collapsed boneless on top of him, breathing hard, while John pressed small kisses to his temple. After a minute, he rolled to his side, and John rolled with him, needing to stay as close as possible.
Sherlock smirked, shifting his hips again, his large hands sliding between John and the mattress to grab at his arse again. He leaned down and sucked at a spot behind John’s ear, before lightly nipping the abused skin. There would be a mark tomorrow, but John didn’t care. It would be more evidence that Sherlock is here. Was real. Was his.
. It’s not just the sand,
“Should I tell you how I want you?” John kissed down to Sherlock’s neck, and positioned himself so he was laying between his spread thighs. “Should I tell you that you, and your deductions, and your swirling around in that coat makes me want to drag you into the nearest room, bend you over the desk and fuck you. Hard. Or that arse. That sinful arse.”
“Sit up a bit, that’s it,” Between the two of them, they removed Sherlock’s t-shirt and pajama pants, leaving her in just her lacy black panties. “Lie back for me,” John whispered. John’s eyes darkened even further as she let her gaze travel over Sherlock’s body from her head to her feet. Sherlock felt self conscious, and almost moved to cover herself, but John’s next words stopped her.
“Why? You want to know why? Because it was my job. Because I was paid to. But I’ll tell you something,” Mary eyes track from John to Sherlock, who has moved nearly to his shoulder. “I’d have done it for free.”
“John, that’s it. I’m here,” Sherlock panted, his hips stuttering as his own orgasm threatened to overtake him.
John threaded his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, pulling him back down and sealing their mouths together. This kiss was softer, but no less passionate, their tongues sliding over one another’s, John’s hands moving from Sherlock’s head, to his nape, down his back and thighs. John loved the feel of Sherlock’s skin under his fingers, the softness, the sparse hair, the wiry strength held in check. Without breaking their kiss, John reached his right hand back and opened the bedside table, quickly reaching inside for the small bottle of lube. Sherlock, knowing exactly what he was after, broke the kiss, and smiled down at John, reaching over to take it out of his hand. He sat back on his heels, uncapping the bottle and preparing to spread some on his fingers.
Sherlock smiled. “No John, thank you, I’d rather be alone right now, if you don’t mind.” He had to get away this instant before he did something spectacularly stupid. John’s face was so open, so earnest, so hopeful, Sherlock thought he was going to burst. Really, he needed to move.
John knows he's got something special...
John can’t help it. He laughs. He laughs like it is the funniest joke he’s ever heard. But there’s no joy in it. All of it, all of the pain he felt watching Sherlock bleed out on the floor of that office comes rushing back, and he can’t control it. Can’t stop it from bubbling up past his lips and echoing in the empty space. Frightened. As if she could ever be.
“Like he said,” Mary nods in Sherlock’s direction. “It was surgery. I was frightened.”
But, I’m lonely. And she’s…well, she’s nice. And maybe it can be okay. It will never be you. No one will ever shine with your brilliance. But I have to move on now. So this is me, saying goodbye. Goodbye to Baker Street. Goodbye to the Consulting Detective and his Blogger. Goodbye to you.
John smirks, and leans down to remove Sherlock’s shirt, kissing each inch of skin as it is revealed. Sherlock wriggles and writhes at the sensation of John’s mouth on his skin, his chest. It is better than he could have imagined. John bends his head and laves his tongue around his nipple, and Sherlock arches his back, grabbing on to John to press him closer. A repeated motion on the other nipple has him close to begging, his hips instinctively rutting upwards.
Sherlock’s eyes go wide at the command, but he hastens to comply, stripping off his t-shirt and throwing it across the room. His pajama pants follow, kicked off in the direction of the couch. Sherlock is gloriously bare, and just as beautiful as John had imagined in all his many fantasies. He looks his fill, drinking in lean abs and long legs, sinewy muscles and creamy skin.
Sherlock pushed himself off the wall and barrelled up the stairs, stripping off his Belstaff the minute he crossed the threshold. John was right behind him, shucking his own coat and shoes, before locking the door, and threading his fingers into Sherlock’s hair. The kiss was instantly hot and wet, tongues meeting, stroking, sucking as they backed further into the room. Clothes were shed, buttons flying in all directions as they made their way to the bedroom. John stopped them just before the doorway, backing Sherlock against the wall and swirling a tongue around one nipple, feeling the pale nub harden under his touch. Sherlock moaned and grabbed at John’s head, rutting his hips harder.
Eager to please
“Well, I certainly hope you’ve learned your lesson. As it turns out, you’re needed”
The rest of the rant was cut off by John’s mouth, lips sliding tenderly across Sherlock’s once, twice, three times before pulling away. John rested his forehead on Sherlock’s, threading his fingers into inky curls.
“Mmph,” Sherlock grunted. They lay there for a moment, each trying to remember how to breathe. “John?”
John flicks the plastic spinner, and calls out the move. “Right foot red, Sherlock.” Sherlock hastens to comply, placing his right foot on the little red circle in front of him.
Sherlock wasn’t even sure how they had become so close to be honest. Sherlock had taken one look at John and knew he was in trouble. Blond hair, blue eyes, strong compact built body, and a flirtatious smile that make Sherlock’s knees shake. He had vowed then and there to keep his distance, to be as cantankerous as possible, because this situation had “bad news” written all over it. His resolve held out for an impressive 72 hours before crumbling to dust, powerless to resist John’s many charms. Now, almost two years later, the two were frequently in the other’s company, studying, watching movies, eating takeaway together, almost everything, really. Except for this one thing.
Sherlock groaned, quickly sliding in another finger beside the first. He kept a steady rhythm, with his fingers and his mouth on John’s cock, and John was slowly shaking apart. He loved this, Sherlock playing his body as well as he played any violin concerto, listening to every noise, changing every technique to do exactly what John needed.
Sherlock spreads his thighs wider, as John wraps one hand around his waist, the other threading into his curls. He begins to move his hips, undulations of his pelvis, each movement causing the heat to course through his veins and pool in his belly. He can hear John breathing heavily behind him, a litany of curses and praise escaping from his lips, his mouth messily smearing kisses over his shoulders. Sherlock can feel John getting closer, he wants to tip him over the edge, he bears down harder, adding a roll at the end and John’s orgasm crashes over them, filling him, his name cascading through the flat.
“Dance, husband?” He asks.
“Thanks, Doctor,” he says, his eyes already falling shut again. He can hear the click clack of the doctor’s shoes as he leaves the room, the soft click of the door catching as it closes. He’s nearly asleep again when he senses someone in his room. John supposes it's a nurse or another doctor here to check his vitals. They can bloody well go ahead without his input, he thinks.
Come find me on
“Battleship, then.”
“Not without you,” he growled, releasing one of his hands to snake it between their bodies and stroke John in time with their thrusts. John suddenly went from close to right there as he shouted his release into Sherlock’s skin, his cock spurting warm and heavy between them.
John stepped closer, causing Sherlock to back up until he hit the wall. “And then what happened, you brilliant arse?”
“Roll over.”
Rainy days are for taking things slow. For languorous kisses, sliding of tongues, gentle nips on lips. A time for soft moans, and a slow simmering burn that rises up to engulf them both. On those days John likes to lay Sherlock out on their bed and worship every inch of him, leave his marks on that alabaster skin. As the rain splatters against the window, he runs his tongue over Sherlock’s chest, his torso, his belly until he is hard and aching, begging for John to cease the torment. When the sky opens up, falling harder, John presses two slicked fingers into Sherlock’s entrance, his moans drowned out by the thunder crashing outside. And as the lightning flares, shimmering off Sherlock’s flushed form, John pushes inside. Maddenly slow thrusts, steadily leading them both towards release, their shared moans shouted into each others mouths, and tattooed on their skin. And after they have both cleaned up and are wrapped in each other, sated and sleepy, John knows that as long as the rain continues to fall, they will find each other again. Rainy days are also for round two’s.
Sherlock hummed,
“Hmm?”
“Sherlock?” John called again, “Please. I- we need to talk. Can I come in?”
Mycroft looks away and down, not meeting Sherlock’s eyes, “I never thought- I didn’t think she’d actually hurt him.”
------------
“Jesus,” John moaned, his back arching off the bed.
“Helping you practice your deductive skills.”
Come visit me on
John pulled away, heading towards the dressing room door. “Mmm, that’s to be determined. But, one thing, for me? Bring the tights, will you? I find I’m quite fond of them.” John opened the door and with a wink pushed through it, leaving Sherlock stunned in his wake.
He lets his head fall back with a sigh. He wonders what happened to Mary. He knows he’s a good shot, Jefferson Hope can attest to that, so there’s a good chance she’s dead. He feels a brief flash of guilt in his gut at that, and a twinge of something more. Sadness? Remorse? In the end he hated her, but he had loved her once. Whatever she was, there was a time when she turned his life around.  She had kept him from following Sherlock to the grave. Given the fact that Sherlock turned out to be alive, he will always be grateful to her for that. Although, he should have known it never was going to work. The minute Sherlock came back it was like a drug, he was sucked back in, craving the next hit. After the train car incident, he had truly forgiven Sherlock, although he still held on to part of his anger. He still can’t let it all fully go. But even with the lingering tension between them, they had fallen back into step, John taking his place beside Sherlock Holmes as they ran around solving crimes. It was almost like before the fall. John should have told Mary then, before the wedding was a sure thing.
“He’s in recovery, but you can see him for a few minutes.”
Other people couldn’t see beyond the basic function. They saw a chair. A place to sit. With no sentiment to cloud their minds they thought nothing of placing themselves in his spot. Sherlock hated them for it. Even Hudders. Sitting there, the morning of the worst day of his life, prattling on with nonsense.
Sherlock kisses down his neck, stopping to nibble at his shoulder, pressing his teeth hard into the tender flesh there. He moans around the skin as he continues stroking John, his other arm like a vice holding him tighter in place. His breath is coming shallower as he ruts himself against John’s arse.
Sherlock freezes, “Where?”
“I’ve only been gone four minutes.” Hopefully he cannot hear the tears in my voice. I do so hate being human around my brother.
“Mm. You, and your cheekbones, the way you move when you have the answer, you swagger. It’s sexy as all hell.”
Looking back, he should have known then that Mary was not what she seemed. So quick to take Sherlock’s side. “I like him,” she'd said as the taxi pulled away from the final restaurant from which they’d been thrown. She was quick to try and talk John around to seeing Sherlock again. She was nearly desperate in her attempts, questions of “Don’t you miss him?” “Don’t you want to know where he’s been all this time, what he’s been doing?” That was the one question that she focused on. At the time, he’d thought she was truly concerned for John and his grief. But after he’d read that flash drive, he realized why she was so concerned.
“Or maybe go for a walk? It’s nice outside.” John was decidedly not looking at the couch. Not watching Sherlock pout prettily as he pondered his next move. He had to bite his lip to keep from laughing.
“So, you have thing for the Scots, do you?” He asked, threading his fingers through those curls he’d always longed to touch.
Drenching the boards with chards and ire.
John leant forward, and Sherlock met him halfway, meeting in a tender kiss. Sherlock sighed, parting his lips, and John immediately pressed in, licking the sound from Sherlock’s mouth.  Sherlock threaded his hands through John’s hair, tilting his head to slot their mouths together, the kiss quickly turning heated, their tongues twirling together. Sherlock finally pulled back when the need to breathe became too great to ignore, resting his forehead against John’s.
“I said just delete it, and I’ll forget -”
Sherlock surprises John in the shower....
“I lost it of course. Easy enough to fake. John didn’t even notice. For a doctor he really is quite unobservant isn’t he? About a great many things.”
“You’ve too many clothes on.”
No matter the milk, or the socks, or the fridge
Sherlock can only nod, lost under the pleasure from John’s talented mouth. John moves lower, laving and nipping at each spinal joint, biting lightly at the swell of Sherlock’s arse. He moves lower, his hands grabbing the the plump flesh and pulling his cheeks apart, bending down to lick a broad stripe up the crack.
Sherlock swallowed. “Just for the night, or -?”
Oh. John thinks, not awake at all then. Suddenly the weight lifts from his hand, and the cold seeps in where Sherlock’s had been. He’s gone. Or was never really there, John cannot be sure of which. But what he thought he heard cannot possibly be real. Sherlock doesn’t love him. He doesn’t feel things that way, never has. Sure, he was upset that John was shot. But they’re friends. It’s a normal reaction. Plus, there’s nothing Sherlock hates worse than being beaten. And Mary has gotten the better of him now, twice. Anything else is just John’s desires running amok.
“Sherlock,” John sighed, stepping in fully and closing the door, “I may not like dance, but in case you hadn’t noticed, I do like you.”
Sherlock was stood in the middle of the room, swaying slightly, holding John’s sleeping daughter in his arms. He seemed to almost be dancing with the infant as he talked, the gentle sway of his body no doubt helping to soothe her slumber. Sherlock’s nose was nuzzed against the top of her head as he recited properties of honey making in a fully active bee colony. A truly fascinating topic, if Amelia’s little snuffly snore was anything to go by. John watched the two people he loved most, soft smile playing over his features, and decided that he was going to let him know how he felt, consequences be damned.

“That’s the idea. Should I stop?”
The sound of my Christian name escaping his lips is a heady thing, it never fails to send a tingle of warmth coursing through my veins.
“You like her.”
He’s going to kill Mycroft. Because standing 10 feet in front of him, leveling a well-used Sig Sauer at Mary, is none other than John Watson.

John continues downward, pressing open mouthed kisses down his stomach, pausing to flick his tongue inside Sherlock’s navel, until he reaches his cock, hard and leaking inside the threadbare pants. John nuzzles his nose where the groin meets thigh, and Sherlock inhales sharply, his hands flying to his own head, and tangling in his curls.
John shook his head. “No.” He sat up, kissing up Sherlock’s neck, nipping along his jaw. John took his earlobe between his teeth, pulling gently, swirling his tongue around the tip. He shifted forward a bit more so he could whisper in Sherlock’s ear.  “No. I want you to watch. As you open me up for you. I want you to fuck me.”
“Sherlock, please.” John moans, wrapping his fist around his cock and giving himself a firm stroke.
“Hmm. Strategy,” Sherlock smirks, pressing a kiss to John’s neck and darting inside the bathroom door.
Holmes makes a small sound in his sleep that scares me from my thoughts, and as I watch, he begins to slump over in his seat. He is threatening to tumble forwards, which would provide a humorous vision, to be sure, but he needs this chance to rest. Swiftly I am on my feet and move to his side of the car, pressing my body close into his, using my weight to hold him in his place. Even in his state he senses my presence, that brilliant mind never quenched. He shifts ever so slightly towards me, laying his head to rest on my shoulder.
“Oh, John, fuck, yes…” His release claimed him, white hot and sparkling, his vision blurring around the edges. He was dimly aware of John holding him, pressing soft kisses to his temples as he floated back to earth. He held on for dear life, grasping to John’s arms, his back, his hips, never wanting to let go.
Mary pauses for just  a moment, head tilted to the side, like a thought has just occurred to her. “Do you know why this was so easy? Because of you. You broke him, you know. Poor broken John. It was so simple to move in and be what he needed. To manipulate him to do whatever I wanted. You ran off and died and left him grieving for you, and I was there to pick up the pieces. And I’ll do it again. Only,” she smiles, that calculating smile that makes Sherlock’s skin crawl, “You won’t be coming back this time. Goodbye, Sherlock.”
–John’s hard length filling him, hitting his prostate on every stroke, his fingers laced with Sherlock’s, holding, comforting. “That’s it love,” he sighs, “come for me.”
John turns his head to look at Sherlock,“Y’ok?
“Yes, love?”
“Fuck, Sherlock.”
Big thanks to my Beta and Brit-picker
Almost as soon as it began, it was over, John pulling back, still cradling Sherlock’s face in his hands.
John made the trek up to his room, pausing just inside the doorway to let the memories come flooding in. That first night, laughing in the entryway, all the cases they had shared. Sherlock bursting in a 3 am, “The Game is on!” Happier times. John set his bags down and quickly stripped, climbing into bed.
Sherlock breaks first. “John. Thank you.”
Sherlock doesn’t answer, too busy nipping his way across shoulder blades and down John’s spine, his tongue flicking out to lick the water droplets from John’s skin.
“Hmm, missing painting from a museum in Brighton, guard reported it -”
He’d tried once to bring it up in a roundabout way. Last Christmas, the dance department was presenting their annual production of The Nutcracker, and Sherlock had landed a part in the ensemble. Sherlock had wanted badly to invite John to the performance, to have someone there for him in the audience, as his brother was “far too busy to be watching amateur dance” and his parents were away. He would have thrilled to see John watching him, to see him in his element, Sherlock as proficient on stage as John was on a field.
Sherlock executes a move with all the grace of a dancer, and suddenly he is faced upwards, still under John, holding himself up in a backwards crab stance, arm and leg muscles straining to keep him upright. The move also does two things that John cannot help but notice. They are now facing one another, their mouths mere inches from the other’s, and because of the positions of their lower halves, John is more or less resting between Sherlock’s spread thighs. Ok, the move makes one more thing apparent to John. Sherlock is not unaffected by their positions either. John closes his eyes and lets out a small groan when he feels Sherlock’s answering hardness against his hip.
Sherlock crawled back up John’s body, slotting their mouths together, before moving downwards. He trailed his lips over John’s neck, his shoulders, down his chest. Sherlock’s tongue darted out to swirl around the hard nub of John’s nipple, before closing his lips around it and sucking, gently.
“Could you - I mean, It sometimes helps if...could you stay? Just for a bit?” John looked up at Sherlock in the darkness, her eyes pleading, obviously searching for some comfort. Sherlock couldn’t refuse. She couldn’t refuse John anything when she looked at her like that. Sherlock nodded and spun in a tight circle, looking for a place she could spend the night. She supposed the floor wouldn’t be too bad. Just as she was about to sit, John surprised her.
“John,” Sherlock breathed, watching though hooded eyes as John moved closer and closer to his cock.
Two minutes. It feels like longer. Every second feels like a year. Every minute a lifetime. I’d never realized what it meant to miss someone. Truly, I’d never had anyone to miss before. Before you. Before you limped into that lab at Barts. Did you know how quickly you enraptured me, John? Did you? Most people I can look at and know their history, their wants, needs, desires in the space of a heartbeat. You were different. I could see you, yes, but I actually
“Oh god, Sherlock, move.”
The chair had to move.
John reluctantly pulled away, breathing hard, his forehead resting on Sherlock’s. “Jesus, Sherlock,” he panted.
It’s all John can get out before Sherlock grabs him and pulls him down, fitting their mouths together, and wasting no time in pressing his tongue to the seam of John’s lips. John gives back just as good, his initial ‘oomph’ of surprise fading into a drawn out moan as he slides his tongue against Sherlock’s. The kiss is hot and desperate, years of pent-up desire let loose in one instant. Between the two of them, John’s towel is shed, and four hands pull off Sherlock’s swim trunks, tossing them somewhere towards the balcony. Sherlock presses a hard kiss to John’s mouth, and then flips them on the sofa, draping his body over John’s.
Sherlock groans, grinding down on John. Remembering that damnable drop, he kisses down John’s jaw, swirling his tongue over his collarbone to his shoulder, stopping to catalogue the unique texture of his scar. Then he moves lower, tracing that watery path, over John’s chest, sucking hard on his nipple, continuing down ever lower until he reaches John’s navel and cautiously swirling his tongue inside.
John leans back against Sherlock’s chest, the warm, honey-scented water rippling around them both as his runs his hand up and down the outside of Sherlock’s thigh. John is pretty sure this spot, nestled between Sherlock’s legs with his arms wrapped around him, is the closest he could get to perfect. He tilts his head back and Sherlock leans down, brushing their mouths together in a sweet kiss. John breaks the kiss and turns back, resting his head on Sherlock’s shoulder.
He climbed in after Sherlock and pressed his body to the window, trying to fight every urge that was telling him to get closer to the man next to him. Sherlock was tense, the energy rolling off him in waves that John could practically feel vibrating against his skin. John risked a glance, a mistake, and found Sherlock watching him, tracking his every movement, those luminescent eyes heavy-lidded and hot on his own. John sucked in a shaky breath and wet his lips, watching as Sherlock traced every movement of his tongue before snapping his gaze back up. It was enough to make John lose the tenuous grip on his control and scoot closer to Sherlock, stopping only when their thighs pressed together.
“You sound like my landlady.”
John faces the aftermath of his encounter with the Woman.
“Generous of you to help strategize possible suitors now that one has been found, brother mine. And don’t be ridiculous, John is a desirable omega. Any match unwilling to bond with him would be courting disaster. What safety does an alpha provide to a man like John Watson if not a permanent deterrent to other aggressors? Only scenting him is hardly very useful once he’s off on the front lines.”
Sherlock had obediently circled them for some time, eyes raking every inch before being directed to sit. Now he was settled in his armchair, stroking himself ardently.
John was properly baffled by that, and almost forgot his frustration in the process. He looked down at himself. “What’s wrong with these clothes? Just because I don’t want to risk ruining suits when we run around back alleys doesn’t make them ridiculous.” He looked back at Sherlock, pure innocence (and very mild hurt) written in his face.
Yes, he probably did harbor something of a flame for John, but he gave himself permission not to be guilt ridden over it. If it had helped him persuade Mycroft, and thus the summit, to get John out of his bind then he couldn’t pretend to think it was a bad thing.
Sherlock felt rather proud at that.
John makes a house call for Mycroft
“And when we are in the same country?”
John didn’t know what’d he’d ever done to earn that kind of promise, but he was overwhelmed with gratitude all the same.
“Not if I can help it, sir.”
“You’ve been- this is because you're attracted to me?”
Irene raised a sculpted brow. “I can’t?”
Sebastian sighed with mock reluctance. “I don’t know. I also get turned on by the idea of you roughing other alphas up, and you might not get the chance if I scent you. But I can be persuaded. If you ask nicely.”
“I thought you said your sister depended on your pension, why is she withdrawing you?”
Was that all? Silly John for getting upset. He nodded sarcastically. “Reasonable enough. You wanted to masturbate and needed some live entertainment.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John let out a short humorless laugh. Irene's manicured hands were now unbuttoning his shirt, and his efforts to buck her off were not working. “Right. Well if Sherlock feels that way, he’s welcome to say so himself. Get off me. Now.”
“If you’ll extend the same courtesy.”
“You can’t bond me, I’m not in heat!”
He can be counted on to fuss before relenting.”
“Indeed. I never thought Mycroft would take an omega, and I wouldn’t have imagined him sending you about, doing his bidding like the other henchmen. He is very lazy though, and you would have been convenient.”
“It’s not a choice it’s my reality, Sherlock! I’ve seen what it looks like to be raped and trapped with the perpetrator. My only family nearly sold me into that. If Victor hadn’t gotten high the first night I was with him, who’s knows if I could have gotten out before he forced a bond. He wouldn’t have asked me first, wouldn’t have left me free to try to stop him. I’m not stupid. I know I can’t have everything I want, so I settled on what really matters to me, and yes, I’ve decided to be flexible with the rest. Not all of us can afford to be stubborn pricks all the time.” He jabbed his finger in Sherlock’s chest at the last comment.
Fuck. Fuck! How could she do this!? No- she’d promised- dammit, she had the alpha portion of his pay for debts, what the hell had she been thinking? John put his full strength against his restraints now, testing their hold on all four limbs. This was not good. The bindings were secure and anchored to the floor. John kept his voice level, but he was calculating, slowly, thanks to whatever they drugged him with, “How long are you planning to keep me like this?”
John felt ashamed to say it out loud. “My sister is, was, my legal alpha, and yesterday she signed my papers away.” He schooled himself. “The alpha she signed them over to filed to have me retire against my will, sir. I don’t want to abandon my unit, my career, like this. If there is any way, any appeal that I can submit, anything at all I can do, I will.”
Irene rose. “Noted, love. Now, you must let me finish. As I said, Sherlock and I have some business that we will be taking care of today, and I would like to clarify your role.” She walked toward him, “Clear communication is rather vital to keeping the stress out of these situations. That way we can all have a marvelous time.”
Irene chuckled softly as Sherlock cleared his throat and turned from the window, but he would not meet John’s eyes. Rather, Sherlock began removing his own suit jacket, which left John with the common feeling that he was too thick to discern why this sodding git had let things go so far. Sherlock couldn't possibly want what she was implying, and annoyingly, Irene’s antics were beginning to have the desired effect on John.
“I would have met you when I came to collect your blood.”
“As?”
Mycroft smiled. “Please, join me, have a pastry.”
“I was able to make preparations for your stay without her involvement.”
“Sherlock keep your eyes on John’s face. I want you to watch him.”
Now John was fully in sociologist mode. Which was a calmer state, set on getting to the bottom of Sherlock’s sideways logic.
“Then who is the alpha I smelled on him?”
“No, I am the only one capable of what I do. I assist the police when they are out of their depth. Which is always.”
“Have you decided you do not desire Watson as a mate?”
He dove into the military connection with gusto, recounting his own tales, asking the omega about his service, and warmly inquiring about the soldier’s ambitions. It was amazing how quickly it relaxed him, to play on shared home turf. They worked their way through the lunch with ease.
“Right, that is usually a good way to go about things. Though if you, or ah, any of your assistants see her, could you let me know? She’s not usually this good at staying underground.”
Why that made Sherlock grin, he did not know. “You’ve met her, when you came to see my injury.”
Parker did not back down. “The nature of the transfer is simply salacious detail, and not pertinent to the withdrawal. I suspect it is being presented here in the worst possible light, as well.”
[ Update on the money laundering case for
“Who are you then, if my not knowing was a tell?” John asked, now beginning the sutures.
Much to his displeasure, it was Irene who replied as she straddled John’s lap. “I’ve been given authority to speak on Sherlock’s behalf in this affair, darling. We had quite the long chat yesterday and agreed that this would be best. Sherlock wants me to touch you like this. He would like to watch me fuck you, as well, among other things.”
The leftovers were tasty and shouldn’t be wasted. John finished them himself and then caved, grabbing supplies from under the sink and set about exerting his will for cleanliness on the rest of the flat since the fridge was off limits.
When Sherlock emerged from his room, John was in his usual armchair, reading the newspaper, in nothing but a vest and boxers. He did not acknowledge Sherlock’s ludicrous exclamations.
“Allow is a strong word. He legally can do whatever he wants. But I agreed not to run if my conditions are met. Which makes anyone he picks a step up, from- well, what I was facing.” He didn’t really want to share the details “Let’s just say it wasn’t ideal with my last alpha, your brother helped by stepping in, taking my papers, so now he gets to pick the next one.”
“They could die promptly, and John would be free. That would be a very pleasant fate. He wouldn’t even need to be bonded, emancipation doesn’t require it.”
“The conditions?”
“Yes, Ms. Miller, that is correct. I, along with a number of my ranking colleagues, petitioned for the filing to be suspended.”
“You are reducing this to a false dichotomy.”
John smiled. “It definitely refined my technique. Plus, the suppressants and birth control they give you are top notch. Calmed things down, thank god. Secondary school was a nightmare for that, was like a fog horn before I was medicated.”
“Then what exactly are you proposing?” Ms. Miller asked, pointedly.
When they left the morgue, he pointed the injustice out. “Why do I have to go around like a vicar when she’s allowed to wear that?”
Parker looked outraged. “And if the omega was forcibly bought out from Trevor? What would happen to Watson then? He cannot be left to his own devices. Or are you so radical as to suggest he be completely emancipated, unbonded as he is?”
“Oh, I like your dirty mouth. We’ll have to see what other uses we can put it to,” he said, dropping papers onto John’s chest.
“Fair enough.”
“I don’t mind. I know you’re mine. And they should be aching for you, if they have any sense.” His voice rumbled, “I know I am.”
“Must have been one of the other students. Tension from living in close quarters, and they attacked him while he was getting in the shower- Oh. Hello, there. I don’t think we’ve been introduced.” The crime tech was giving John an unnecessary looking over.
Working their mouths together, Sebastian bore his own weight on his arms, while John caressed his chest. Sebastian liked that, but more desperately wanted to keep exploring John’s body himself. He didn’t hold out long before spreading his legs to take more of his weight and laying his torso against John. The position freed his hands and he set them to work greedily, pushing up John’s shirt to expose the wonderful expanse of skin there, while John’s thigh pressed into his groin. As they wrestled the friction felt fucking good, and Sebastian ground himself down against it.
When John initiated the kiss, firm and insistent, Sebastian could have ignited from the approval of it. His soldier didn’t back down from a challenge, and he would come up with ways to leverage that. John’s hands were at his neck and waist pulling him in, closer, and Sebastian sunk into the heat of his mouth, the heaven of his scent, the skill of his tongue, until he had John fully pinned to the door. His own hands began roving, groping, till one was in John’s hair and the other cupped his arse. He’d need to put the brakes on this eventually, but his body screamed in retaliation at the thought. It was John who eventually pulled back to gasp out the word. “Couch?”
But Mycroft saw no benefit for himself in that arrangement. It wasn’t every day a specimen like this fell into your lap, one who could inspire this kind of ‘loyalty.’ The way Sholto spoke of him- it was little wonder the politicians had been near drooling. Powerful alphas often had nontraditional tastes in omegas, whether they hid it or not, and from the flock of ranking officers prepared to leap to Watson’s aid, he was clearly a coveted prize. Even Mycroft found he was not totally immune. But he would refrain, as he had ideas of how a carrot like this would come in useful.
Mycroft was reading his phone and waved John off without concern.
John was surprised to feel himself flush. Sebastian cupped his jaw with his other hand and John kept his eyes and body defiant, but he hardly knew what for. The alpha didn’t seem about to attack or restrain him, even if this was more affectionate than normal.
“I thought this was your place of work, Anderson, little pride though you can take in such. Try to be a professional and put in a minimum effort before stating inaccuracies. This murder was committed by a team of professional killers, not a short-tempered economist. Also, quit ogling John, he’s assessing the level of your incompetence and doesn’t need distractions.”
A flashback to Sherlock's initiation of his plan.
“Alcohol?”
“You should have leveraged for more.”
God give him patience. “As my memo detailed, Victor Trevor is not Captain Watson’s bondmate, nor was he his legal Alpha until a week ago, when Captain Watson’s sister, and former legal alpha, Harriet Watson, signed him over. Trevor filed for Watson’s withdrawal later that same day, which also happened to be the first time he ever met the captain. Persuasion would have been difficult, I imagine, under such a timeframe.”
John considered if there was anything else to do that evening but decided he could worry fruitlessly just as well in his bed as in the kitchen. He diligently put away the food and did the washing up before heading to his room, where he found his laptop, rucksack, and a special key card that must be for the front door, all neatly set on a desk, along with a charging cable for his new phone. Further, all his clothes, even the one’s he’d have sworn were at Harry’s, sat smartly in his dresser and wardrobe, along with several pieces he didn’t recognize and felt certain were outside of his price point. In fact, looking at the room again, he realized everything from Harry’s flat of his, from his bookshelves worth of novels, textbooks, and medical journals to a his favorite RAMC mug, was present and tidily rehomed. He amused himself, wondering how specific Mycroft’s instructions to his apparently warrant-defying assistants had been, or if they were just trained to anticipate their bosses exacting standards. Still, it couldn’t be said that the man wasn’t accommodating, and this evening was a far nicer welcome than the one he’d received from his last alpha.
John stopped abruptly.
Nothing.
"Actually ... no, I'm not sorry. I'm not sorry for loving you, Sherlock. I may be sorry for not telling you sooner, for ruining all of this-" - he made a vague hand gesture at the both of them - "but I'll never be ... never be sorry for loving you. And if you don't want-"
"Well, I get how we went to the pubs you marked on the ... the map", John continued and Sherlock gave him a small nod. "But when I asked you earlier you said that the file-" - he hiccuped - "was ... that it was part of the plan."
Mary was lovely and normal  (at least in the eyes of the public) and a life with her seemed to be a safe option - that was what he had told himself anyway.
And it was enough. Really, it was. He had truthfully thought that marrying her would be a good idea. Not perfect, mind you, no. Not what he had dreamed of, no. But reasonable. Manageable. He had thought that he could learn to love her like she deserved to and that they could live their happy and domestic life together because it was enough, it had to be.
"Yes, well ... I never said I was straight either. And yes, that's what I'm saying. I'm sorry."
"I don't mind."
and ... and it was all just really, really not fair.
A while later he heard him rummaging around in the kitchen, opening the fridge and then a staggered intake of breath followed by an annoyed sigh. Sherlock supposed John had found the slaughtered pig he had put there yesterday for a very crucial case involving a serial killer, a farm, a stolen pig ... and the queen.
Taking another sip from his glass John unfolded his legs so that he shifted forward in his seat until he was sitting at the very edge of it. Out of a sudden he found himself sliding off and instantly reached out for Sherlock's knee, bracing himself against it. Heat shot through him in waves as he found himself face to face with him, eyes just inches apart. Now. Now was the moment he had to tell him, right? He wanted to, he really did, but the words were stuck in his throat. He pushed himself back a little and shrugged, unsure of how he should react. Should he say something?
A few minutes later a steaming cup of tea was placed down on the sofa table in front of Sherlock, who decided to simply ignore it. He still had to find a solution for his problem and the presence of John did little to help him stop thinking about him. Instead, he found himself thinking about him even more, analyzing every detail and trying to ignore the strange pull in his heart when he realized that John had made him tea because he was
He took a deep breath and continued - much quieter: "This is about you always claiming that you're 'not gay' and then going on having girlfriends and proposing to Mary and wanting to marry her and THEN telling me ... ME ... that you ... love me? I had a plan! I planned it - everything. The wedding, I thought ... I though you ... and now you say you love me?"
"Tall?"
"Because I ... might return the sentiment ... theoretically speaking."
"Clever?"
"I'm looking forward to it."
Immediatly after he had said it he wanted to dig a hole into the ground and crawl into it and never come back but instead he just took another big swallow of his drink and watched as Sherlock blushed some more.
Morse code.
He was heaving by the end, his breath coming heavily. He found Sherlock's eyes again and locked them with his own.
So, out of nervousness and fond exasperation towards Sherlock's cleaning habits, he began to organise the papers on the table. There were a few experiment notes - something about different types of soil that seemed to be important - but then he stumbled across something unexpected. His birth certificate, to be exact. Well, he knew Sherlock had been trying to find out his middle name for some time now, so he just brushed it off as something Sherlock would do. He made a mental note to have a talk with him about privacy though. Stealing birth certificates was definitely a bit 'not good'.
"But I CAN! Just ... let me tell you this, Sherlock. It's you. It has always been you, way ... way before ... all that happened. With Mary. I think she already knows. Because the moment I saw you again, that day, I knew I had made a mistake. Because I still loved you. Somehow I thought that after the fall and these years ... I had convinced myself I didn't love you anymore but nothing, nothing could ever stop me from loving you and I'm sorry it took me that long but this is definitely not the alcohol speaking and whatever you say, however you ... feel ... about this ... I'm not going to marry her. Not ever."
"Sherlock!", John cried out and Sherlock startled and turned to him. His brows creased as he looked at the files and papers all over the table and in John's hand.
what Sherlock had in mind, seeing as his flatmate was usually busy dating meaningless women and telling everyone how straight he was. Tedious.
When John opened the door to the sitting room of 221B, he was confronted with a massive mess. Now, that alone was nothing new. He was acclimatised to Sherlock and his behaviors by now and couldn't help but feel like they where just a fixed part of him. Still, they had seemed to get worse as of lately, now that John wasn't around in the flat anymore and didn't clean up after the mad genius.
Then, about a week later, it suddenly hit him. He had just been standing under the shower, letting his thoughts wander when he remembered where exactly he knew the tapping noises from. The army, of course! He had learned it in the army!
——••——
"You want me?"
He had to try, hadn't he? This was his stag night, damn it, and he had already decided he couldn't and wouldn't marry the woman he had made his fiancée. This was the time to talk about the truth and he had to at least try.
His sudden intake of breath together with the fact that he'd all but collapsed onto the chair across from Sherlock after hearing him make a bloody love confession in front of him must have piqued  the dark haired man's interest because John suddenly found himself staring into his best friend's beautiful eyes. A love confession!
And he was right.
—•——     ———     ••—
Now that he thought about it it was all so
"Stop, just ... stop. You're not making any sense! You, you can't love me, John! I have ... there were no signs that you ... I thought that ..."
"Look, I really don't have a problem if you put things in the fridge for an experiment or whatever it is you're doing with them, as long as they're not dangerous, but you promised me to store them in their
So that explains part of his anger. Mycroft knew of Sherlock’s plans and didn’t divulge them. John must have felt betrayed all over again. Here was Sherlock, off on his own again, and if John was indeed trying to protect him, meeting with Mary would not be the result he would have wanted. No wonder he showed up, and armed. Still, Mycroft knew his conditions, he knew what it meant to keep John away these past few months. And still he let him walk right into that warehouse, right into a standoff with a trained assassin. Sherlock had dressed for the occasion. John hadn’t.
John ponders this speech for a minute. He briefly considers telling Sherlock to do exactly that, to get the hell out of his bed and back to his own, that he is perfectly capable of sleeping alone, thankyouverymuch, but then he realizes that no. No he’s not. And ever since Sherlock walked into the room, his breathing has gone back to normal. Plus, Sherlock in his bed just looks...right. Sherlock nestles into the pillow, his eyes focused on John’s, and John feels a warm tingle begin in his chest and spread throughout his body.
“John. Oh god, I’m not going to last.”
John lifted Sherlock’s feet out of his lap, got up from the couch and went to the desk, fumbling through the pile of books there, throwing a few into his backpack. “I think I’d better go get some studying done,” John said softly.
“John?” No response.
He lets his head fall back and replays the last memories he has. He remembers entering the warehouse, Sherlock trying desperately to get him to leave, Mary throwing mocking insults in his direction. Mycroft arriving, a gunshot, Sherlock sprawled across the floor, Mary collapsed. He can remember the pain, and then a blissful numbness that seeped through his body. And he can remember the feel of laying in Sherlock’s lap, the warmth surrounding him. Sherlock’s hands on him, applying pressure to the wound. His eyes...
“No,” Sherlock whispered. “I want to.” He turned his head and pressed kisses to John’s wrist, his tongue darting out to chase his racing pulse. “I want you.”
“Of course I did.” John lowers his own gun, now resting against his thigh, pointing at the floor.
Mary falls and John is glad. If he hadn’t been there today there’s no doubt she would have shot Sherlock again. And John’s positive it wouldn’t have been a recoverable wound this time. Looking around he sees Sherlock sprawled on the floor, and tries to move toward him, but a sharp pain brings him up short, his head clouding. The next thing he knows, he is laying on the cold floor, Sherlock’s face swimming in his vision.
“So you told him of my rendezvous today?”
“God, yes,” Sherlock breathes, now fully hard thanks to John’s filthy texts.
“Sherlock!” Molly laughed “We’ve done it three times now. It’s perfect. If it gets any more perfect, we’ll frame it.” She giggled at her own lame joke.
Sherlock stood up and moved over to stand in front of John’s chair. He wavered there, shifting slightly from foot to foot as he waited for John to look up at him. John took his time, carefully closing the paper, folding it in half and placing it on the side table next to his chair. Only after that was complete did he look up to catch Sherlock’s eyes. His pleading, beautiful, color-of the-sea, ever-changing eyes.
“You love my arse.”
“Hell,” John said, collapsing on top of Sherlock.
Find me on
Sherlock grabs John hard, spreads him open and dips his head, pressing his tongue flat against John’s hole, once, twice. John presses back, seeking more, and Sherlock thrusts his tongue in, closing his lips around and sucking at his hole. John lets out a long guttural moan, unconsciously moving backwards to seek more. Sherlock is relentless, piercing and laving at the trembling muscle, and John’s fist moves faster on his cock, until he is fucking himself between Sherlock’s tongue and his own hand. He can feel his orgasm barreling down on him, his thighs are shaking with the effort to hold himself upright. Sherlock tongue pushes even further in, and that does it, John’s orgasm explodes in ribbons on the shower wall, his moans filling the small room.
As Sherlock approaches the bed, he can't help but think that John has never looked more helpless than he does at this moment. John would hate that. He would hate to look weak, look defeated. But he does. This man lying here is like a pale imitation of the real John. Sherlock feels lost in grief, looking down at the body of his best friend, frail and broken. For the second time that day, Sherlock’s eyes blur with unshed tears.
Tonight was no different. Well the dreams were no different. But John woke with an urgency and an anxiousness he hadn’t felt in years. Sherlock was there, as always, His heartbeat a steady pulse under John’s fingers, breath hot in his ear as he whispered his reassurances to him. But tonight, it wasn’t enough.
John exhaled sharply. “What? No! First of all, It’s Greg by the way, and he and Molly are together in case you hadn’t noticed. And yes, I was hoping to catch someone under that spot tonight. Someone I’ve desperately wanted to snog for some time now. I just didn’t expect it to be a bloody floor show!”
“Sherlo-” John breathes, feeling the heat begin the pool between his legs at the talent of Sherlock’s mouth on his skin. But he really should call an end to this, he’s running behind as it is.
Sherlock surreptitiously wipes his eyes before turning to glare at his brother. “You and I need to have a discussion, I think.”
For a moment, I freeze. Is it too much? We have the private car, but anyone may happen by. What would they see? But as night fully descends outside the moving window, I decide that for this wonderful man, I will take this small risk. Perhaps some day, some time, we can share more with no need to consider privacy. Perhaps someday I can wrap my arms fully around my beloved, hug him to me, stroke his hair while he sleeps, even when we are not alone. But if this is all we can share, here and now, I will take it, and enjoy what I can. For this man. For Sherlock.
“Mm?”
Leaning over, John lightly pressed his lips to Sherlock’s forehead, lingering softly, trailing butterfly soft down to one sharp cheekbone. John pulled back, starting again on the other side of Sherlock’s forehead, over one sculpted eyebrow, to the opposite cheekbone, John’s lips the only point of contact between them. He paused, breathing in Sherlock’s scent: tea, sandalwood, and a hint of smoke. Home. He moved lower, pressing kisses to Sherlock’s jaw, before reaching his neck. John smiled when he felt Sherlock tilt his head to grant him greater access.
“Christ, Sherlock, that’s sweet.”
“Don’t care.”
“My pleasure,” Sherlock responds, getting up from the table.
John laughed as he stepped up closer, placing his hands on those hips that he’d envied blondie touching earlier. “You know the Spice Girls? I would have thought you’d deleted it.”
Do you know? Did you hear? I sit here on the plane that carries me away from my beloved London, away from you, and I wonder if you heard it. Did you hear what I was trying to tell you behind those well chosen words we exchanged? Seemingly meaningless they were, but I didn’t know how else to express it. Not with her. HER. There. Like a shadow. A spectre.
“He stabbed you.” The arm across his stomach squeezed a little tighter, those long fingers rubbing a circle around his navel through his T-Shirt.
“Oh, god.”
Sherlock freezes for a second, his eyes wide, before a smirk breaks over his features. “I forfeit.” With that statement Sherlock throws his arms around John and slams their mouths together, both of them falling flat on the floor, John flush on top of Sherlock.
John smiled. “Yeah. Can I?”
“What do you want?” Sherlock’s voice had dropped an octave, that sinful baritone making John’s cock twitch where it was pressed against Sherlock’s body. “Tell me, John. Whatever you want, I’m here.” Sherlock accented his words with another expert roll of his hips that had both of them moaning. And suddenly, John knew what he wanted. What he needed.
“Please, John. But, I need to see you too.”
“You alright?” John asked loud enough to be heard over the music. Sherlock nodded, not moving from the spot. John swallowed. “That guy was an arse. But, Jesus, Sherlock - you, well, I didn’t realize you could move like that,” John rubbed the back of his neck and looked down at the floor.
John was losing his own composure, he rocked his hips into the sofa, desperate for friction on his aching cock. He moaned around Sherlock’s erection, and suddenly the hands on his shoulders became more insistent.
“Oh yes, Sherlock. I want to take you apart in so many ways.” John looked at Sherlock from under her lashes as she worked further down Sherlock’s body. “This is just the beginning.”
John steps back out of reach, and shakes his head. “John?” Sherlock breathes.
The next time his phone pings he decides to indulge in answering, having nothing better to do than languidly drape himself over the sofa. He swipes his thumb across the screen and notes the time, John should be home within the hour. His messages show four missed all from John, as he suspected. However, the contents aren’t something he’d have deduced.
John had lost count. This was either the fourth or fifth pint he had consumed in the time they’d been here. Not to mention the couple of chasers he’d downed, the amber liquid burning down his throat and filling his veins with a fire and a courage he normally wouldn’t possess. Otherwise, how could he explain why he was currently leaning against the bar in one of Soho’s seedier gay clubs watching the lights play off Sherlock’s face and wondering what it would be like to lick the sweat off that sinfully long neck. Or to drag his friend out on the floor and find out what that body felt like pressed up against his own. What that delicious arse would feel like nestled up against his groin.
“John, oh god, I can’t -” Sherlock was clenching the sheets so tightly her grip was white, every muscle in her body tensed.
“Ok.”
Sherlock complied, threading their fingers together and pinning them over John’s head before picking up his pace and slamming into John again and again. John met him thrust for thrust, pressing against the added weight, his fingers white with tension where he tightly gripped Sherlock’s own. He peppered open mouthed kisses to Sherlock’s throat and jaw, anywhere he could reach, the taste of Sherlock hot and delicious in his mouth. John could tell Sherlock was getting close, he was trembling in John’s arms, his moans becoming more and more desperate. John was nearing his precipice as well, but he wanted, needed, Sherlock to come inside him, needed to feel him fall apart.
“Fuck, Sherlock, I’m going to - Fuck!” John shouts his warning, shooting his release deep down Sherlock's throat. Sherlock stills his hand on his own cock as he continues to lick at John’s softening erection. He pulls off when he senses John is too sensitive, sitting back on his heels. John sits up and covers his mouth with his own, biting at his lower lip, hands still fisted in Sherlock’s hair.
John walks to his bedroom door and throws it open and runs smack into a wall. Specifically a wall shaped like Sherlock. John looks up horrified, wondering how long he has been standing there. Sherlock is still wearing his coat, leaning against the doorframe. He is breathing hard, his head bowed, his chest heaving. John begs to whoever is listening that Sherlock has just returned home.
“You’re a right arse, you know that?” John laughed, slipping off of Sherlock’s back and flopping back on the other end of the sofa.
The paramedics are off to the side, Mycroft waves them over towards the two men. Sherlock gives John one final squeeze, leaning over to whisper softly, “Fight. For me. I love you,” before standing up.
“You did.”
A chill travels down Sherlock’s spine at the words, Mary mimicking the strange sing-song nature of Jim Moriarty's taunt perfectly. That’s all this ever was, he knows. Mary, the wedding, John. All designed to burn the heart out of him. Sherlock has to commend him on his admirable job. Because right at this moment, he’s forced to admit he’s damn near charred.
So HLV always gets me right in the heart. Sherlock's tears on the plane kill me every time. That's where this came from. Forgive me.
John leaned back and checked his phone again, even though he realized it was pointless. The thought occurred that he should be calling Mycroft. Sherlock’s mood was a huge red flag and John worried he was up to old habits. On the other hand, if Mycroft got involved it would be blown way out of proportion. John really didn’t want to get in the middle of a sibling rivalry where Mycroft again tried to force Sherlock into rehab, and Sherlock proceeded to hurt himself even more out of misguided spite. And in any regard, it was just one night. Sherlock had promised him after the last time to never let himself get so far gone again. He trusted Sherlock would be smart, would come home and everything would be fine. Or so John told himself. But as one hour stretched into two stretched into five, and the unanswered texts began to pile up, John began to have his doubts.
Goodbye Sherlock.
John was grateful for Sherlock’s ability to summon cabs on command. He was thrumming with pent up arousal, desire for Sherlock racing through his blood. The groping and quick snog they had shared in the club was just the spark that had set everything aflame, and now he was on fire. He hoped that the cab ride back to Baker Street would be a quick one.
My mind is on fire. I should be focusing on what lies ahead. On what I need to do to survive. Return. As if that were likely. Even with my full attention, balance of probability says I will not be finding my way home this time. That this is the last adventure I will undertake. You’d hate that idea if you knew. Do you know? Do you understand what I’d meant, what I was trying so desperately to convey? Do you realize that there are no more miracles present in this transport, that my chances have all been used up?
John is struggling to come to terms with what he sees in front of him. Sherlock in danger. Held at gunpoint by his wife. His lying, treacherous wife. Why did he ever think he could trust her? Oh, right. A glance at Sherlock reminds him. It was his idea, his brilliant plan. Sherlock urged him to forgive, to trust, to return to her side. And John, ever loyal, always did things Sherlock’s way. So he had. He forgave and believed her when she said she’d given it all up, turned over a new leaf. Or maybe he’d just wanted to believe. Sherlock had seemed so convinced that they could trust her; he accepted it but secretly hoped that it wouldn’t be permanent. He didn’t think his resolve could hold out forever. Not even Sherlock could convince John to fall back in love with a cold-blooded murderer.
“You killed for money!”
The next time he awakes he’s not sure where he is. Hospital, surely, but it’s not the dull roar of the A&E surrounding him, or the thrum of the trama unit. He’s already been admitted then. Blinking his eyes open the first thing he registers is the beeping of the monitors. The steady tones are a break from the dull hum of the fluorescent lights glowing overhead. He looks to his left, noting the myriad of equipment monitoring all his vitals. Blood pressure, oxygen, heart rate. He’s pleased to note they all appear normal. He tries to sit up a bit, but a sharp pain stops him. He looks down at his body and the bandage wrapped around his chest. Surgery then. He wonders how bad the damage is and how soon he can get out of this place. For a doctor, he really hates hospitals.
John threw open the window, shoving his madman of a flatmate out into the clean air and clapping him on the back to relieve his coughing fit. Satisfied that Sherlock wasn’t in imminent danger any longer, he surveyed the mess, growing angrier by the second at each new disaster he spied. John whirled his head around ready to give Sherlock the dress down of his life, when he noticed that his eyes had gone wide. Wide, and dark. And was that… was he blushing? All bluster went out of him at the sight. Sherlock looked flustered. And adorable.
John wants Sherlock to know it's always two of them...
John smiles,
John smirked at Sherlock’s antics. “Lestrade hasn’t called?”
“John,” Sherlock panted as he finally sank all the way in, sucking hard on the side of his neck. “You feel amazing.”
John watched those beautiful eyes darken further, the flush spread over his chest as he took in each heaving breath. He trailed his eyes down his lover’s body, where Sherlock’s cock was fully erect, and glistening at the tip. Definitely interested, then. But still-
The profanity made John’s arousal pitch even higher. Of the two of them, Sherlock was not the swearer, that title belonged solely to himself. So to reduce this man to such profane depths was powerful and heady, and John wanted more. He pushed up, and captured Sherlock’s mouth in a searing kiss, sweeping his tongue inside. Sherlock moaned, his lips moving restlessly with John’s, desperate and hot, his hips shifting and rolling, as he rubbed their erections against one another.
“Have a good day, John. Just giving you something to think about,” Sherlock says, opening the shower door and stepping out.
Sherlock laughed, a full belly laugh that had John jiggling as he lay on his Sherlock-shaped perch. John joined in, resting his head on his hands atop Sherlock’s chest and just watching the mirth play over Sherlock’s features.
Turning around again, we moved towards the kitchen, maneuvering around John’s chair before John stopped him, gently grabbing his arm. The warmth of even that small touch hot as fire where it rested against his skin.
“Touch me, please, John, just- ohhh.” Sherlock arches his back, his hips rolling instinctively to press himself further into John’s hand where it is curled around his cock. John wastes no time, stroking him hard and fast, obviously understanding how close he is, and Sherlock is grateful. John reaches down with his other hand, kneading the rounded globe of Sherlock’s arse and sucks hard at a pulse point, and that pulls him over the edge, his vision going white around the edges as he shoots his release between their bodies. He’s dimly aware that he is chanting John’s name over and over,  but couldn’t possibly care less. Judging by the soft kisses and chuckles being pressed into his skin, John doesn’t seem to mind either.
John groans. “That voice, I knew it would sound like dripping sex, but good god, Sherlock.”
“John,” Sherlock cried, as John’s fist closed around them. “I’m not going to - oh, god.” He arched into John’s hand, his cock pulsing thick and hard as his came, pulse after pulse shooting between them.
At last.
Sharing, loving, together.
Sherlock licks a long stripe from palm to fingers, hooded eyes never leaving John’s. He sucks John’s index finger into his mouth, swirling his tongue around the tip, wicked glint in his eye. John growls low in his throat, pulling his finger out of Sherlock’s mouth. Leaning down to press kisses to Sherlock’s jaw, he snakes his hand between them to take them both in hand, Sherlock’s saliva and their own pre-come making the slide easier.
“John. Must we with the games? And Twister of all things?”
They quickly rinse off and towel dry then paddle into the bedroom, climbing into the bed. Sherlock curls his naked body around John’s, one leg thrown between his, his head snuggled on his chest. John wraps his arms around Sherlock and squeezes, once again grateful for how the day turned out, the rise and fall of Sherlock’s chest a welcome sensation. He allows himself to drift to sleep, bathed in the light of the afternoon sun, warm, safe, and content.
“Your boyfriend. You haven’t heard from him all evening. Usually he texts you when he finishes his shift, but he hasn’t this evening, and that was two, no three hours ago, hence the reason you have your mobile open and unlocked right on top of the desk. You also haven’t heard from your best friend all evening, and she was supposed to ring by at suppertime. You’ve suspected for some time that they were having an affair behind your back, quite right too. If you left on break now, you just may catch them at it.” Sherlock finishes with a smug expression, hands stuffed in the pockets of his coat. She’ll either slap him or… yes, there she goes.
Sherlock trails his fingers over John’s hand, over his wrist, up his forearms, before slowly trailing back down to grasp his hand again. He can remember the first time they’d held hands, running through the streets, two fugitives against the world. He entwines their fingers, staring at the contrast between long and short, pale and tanned. He wishes John would wake up, make some snide comment about the two of them holding hands like a pair of teenagers on a date.
“Cheated. No where on the spinner board is the move labeled ‘kiss your opponent.’”
Three minutes. I wish you were here with me. My John. I’m lost without you. Did you know? The first time I left, I did it to protect you, to keep you safe. But I always kept in mind that I was working to come home to you. To our life, to Baker Street, to Sherlock and John, the Detective and his Blogger. I suppose, in a way, I still am protecting you. I always will, John, until my last breath. I still don’t regret it. You are the best and the bravest man I have ever known.
“Hey. Just a suggestion.” She gave him another pat before moving away to pick up her bag. “I gotta run, but just think about it, okay? Tell him.”
Sherlock lowers his head, and grabs John, hauling him down into a sloppy kiss. “Yours.”
“God, Sherlock, more.”
“Of course I do,” John smiled. “But you’re also the biggest git on the planet.”
“Hello little brother, how is the exile going?”
“Git,” John chuckles, slapping Sherlock’s thigh playfully.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at the wandering limb. “Impatient?”
“Oh, John, John.” Sherlock chanted, grabbing John’s hips and thrusting harder into John’s body, his own orgasm devastatingly close.
“Obviously.”
“If he survives I’ll be sure to tell him your ineptitude allowed him to get injured, yes.”
“A damn shame. This,” John pressed a soft kiss to one arse cheek, “Deserves to be worshiped. Adored.”
“Oh,” John breathed. “Oh! That explains-,” John shook his head. “I’m - right. Well.” Sherlock felt the warmth leach away as John removed his hand. “Sorry, I didn’t realize.”
“John,” Sherlock breathed.
“Not quite,” Sherlock replied, trailing his tongue across his chest to lavish attention on the other nipple.
And rugby players didn’t like ballet dancers.
“What do you want?”
“Fuck you,” John says, but there's no real heat in it. “Just because we’re not all bloody gazelles.”
I do, John. Illogically, irrevocably, inexplicably, I love you. Always you. Since the moment we met. You must know. You must have heard it, seen it. Did you? In my words, my eyes, my body? Read it the way I can read a crime scene? I dare to hope you did. I could not bear to say the words out loud to you in front of her, my brother, an audience. But I dare to believe you heard. Did you?
John settled in and closed her eyes, and as Sherlock watched, the tension seemed to melt away, her lovely face softening. The rise and fall of her chest was deep and even, and Sherlock knew she was resting peacefully and with any luck would remain that way for the night. She attempted to remove her hand from John’s grip, but John tightened her hold, as if even in her sleep she was determined not to let Sherlock go. Sherlock felt a thrill run through her at the thought of John wanting her to stay, because honestly, there was no where else she would rather be.
“Oh Sherlock, the game is never over. And I have no intention to stop playing.”
As the soulful strains of Ella Fitzgerald coast over the room, Sherlock looks over at John. His John now. His husband. He can hardly believe that after all this time, they are actually here. To say John looked good at his last wedding is an understatement, but tonight, he is positively resplendent, his silver-blond hair glowing in the dim candlelight, his blue eyes sparkling. Those blue eyes catch Sherlock’s now, one eyebrow lifting.
“Sherlock?”
John laughs. “Well, I’m glad you put that skill to good use, then.” He looks down at the fetid water swirling around their bodies. “Right now, I observe that we need to get out of this tub.”
His brother is waiting for him, it appears as if their conversation will be now. No better time than the present, he surmises. Mycroft hands Sherlock some wipes, and he takes the offering, slowly scrubbing at the blood congealing on his fingers. John’s blood. Sherlock shudders and sucks in a breath, scrubbing harder at his right hand. Finally clean, he drops the wipes and turns his head towards the window, watching the buildings rise and fall as they pass by in a vague blur.
Those nights Sherlock seems to know instinctively what John needs. Or maybe he hears him, tossing and turning, sometimes screaming his name. But either way, he is there in the flash of an eye, pressing soft kisses to John’s temple, threading their fingers together. Letting John skim his fingers over the pulse point in Sherlock’s neck. “I’m here,” he’ll whisper. A soft reminder of his presence. And John is grateful. Grateful that Sherlock will press his body against his own, and comfort him back to slumber.
“Anything.”
“I see,” John says. “How long will I have to stay here?”
“John, there’s something ... I should say; I-I’ve meant to say always and then never have. Since it’s unlikely we’ll ever meet again, I might as well say it now...Sherlock is actually a girl’s name.”
“My turn?” Sherlock breathes, breaking John from his current thoughts.
“Good. I expect every year about this time will be amenable? That’s what people do, right? Have anniversaries?”
“John, sorry I woke you.”
He steps closer to the bed, the incessant beeping of the monitors a reassurance that John’s heart is beating healthy and strong despite its ordeal. Like before, he reaches out one finger to touch John, light brushes against his hand where it lays on the bed. It is enough to convince him that John is still alive, and that is enough, for now.
Sherlock huffs again, clearly affronted by the pattern gracing the floor of 221b. John suppresses a laugh and returns to his work, ensuring the canvas is spread flat, and retrieving the spinner from the box.
“Hi,” she whispered.
“Of course,” John says, standing and pulling off his jeans and pants.
At the same time, the two were getting closer than ever. Nights were frequently passed in each other’s company, John wrangling Sherlock into watching some insipid Christmas movie with him. Last night, Sherlock had been so tired, he’d tried to beg off, actually get some sleep, but John had trained those midnight blue eyes on his, blinking at him from under those ridiculously long lashes, and said “please” and that was all it took for Sherlock to find himself curled on one end of the sofa, John on the other. Of course, he doesn’t remember much of the movie, but he does remember waking up, blanket tucked in to his chin, and a pillow resting under his head.
“Awww!” Molly squealed, bouncing up and down. “That’s so cute! What did he say when you told him you were in it?”
John’s tread sounded extra heavy on the climb back up the seventeen stairs into the flat. Sherlock heard the tinkling of goblets, clinking of dishes and plates being placed in the sink. John was cleaning up. Sherlock supposed he should do the proper thing and help, but he didn’t think he could face John right now. Suddenly, a large crash sounded in the kitchen, followed by a muttered curse, then a determined stride towards his bedroom. Sherlock sat up, alarmed.
“What do you want?” John asked, peppering kisses along Sherlock’s jaw.
“England,” Mycroft says, and hangs up.
Making panic raise in Sherlock’s brain,
“He’s in surgery,” the nursing assistant replies.
He hears footsteps approaching, the tap of an umbrella handle. Mycroft. It has to be now. He has to tell him, if this is the last chance, John needs to know.
“If you don’t put your mouth on me - Christ!” Sherlock yelled as John spread him open and licked one firm wet stripe right up the center of his arse. John repeated the motion, slower, pressing his tongue teasingly against the furled muscle of Sherlock’s hole, reveling in the shudders and shivers coursing through the man underneath his lips, his tongue. He alternated teasing strokes, long passes of flattened tongue, kneading the plush flesh under his fingers.
John pulls back with a chuckle, flashing a cheeky grin at Greg. The whisperers are blissfully silent for once. Yes, he supposes, he could tell them all the wonderful things about his partner, his lover, his husband, but really, there are some things he’d rather keep for himself.
And what was all this isolation for, John thinks as he watches Mary turn to him, gun poised. So he could rush back into danger? Back to this spot, standing in front of an assassin, determined that this time the bullet would do its job and take him away for good? Well no. John wasn’t having that. This time, no matter what Sherlock tells him, or tries to get him to believe, he is going to be there, to protect him, watch his back. Like he should have done in Magnussen's office. Or on the roof of Bart's, for that matter. It should be the two of them. Just the two of them, always.
John stood with his hands on his hips and glared, waiting for Sherlock to look at him.
Sherlock closed the distance between them, his heart beating out a staccato rhythm he was sure John could hear. His fingers clutched at John’s bicep, the muscles jumping slightly under his touch. He bent down until they were only inches apart, their shared breath mingling in the close space.
Mycroft reaches down and retrieves the weapon, slipping it into his own overcoat. “Sherlock, you have to let go.”
“Oh god yes,” he pants as he presses inside, the burn mingling with the pleasure and spiking his arousal even further. He tightens his hold on his cock and plants his feet, bucking his hips upward, to thrust himself into his fist and back down on his fingers. He can see Sherlock between his thighs, letting him fuck into his mouth, while he fucks John with his fingers. He moans, stroking faster, as he imagines flipping them around, taking Sherlock into his mouth as he slips his fingers inside Sherlock’s body, opening him up. And more. Sherlock’s legs wrapped around his waist, John’s cock buried in that luscious arse, John’s fingers leaving bruises on those pale hipbones as he slams into him again and again. He imagines that voice moaning John’s name as Sherlock dissolves into pleasure, the slick ring of muscle tightening around his cock as Sherlock comes, breath hot on John’s neck.
He has no clue why he agreed to this inane holiday in the first place. He doesn’t need holidays. Holidays are for average idiots, to give themselves a so-called break from their dull prosaic lives. Sherlock Holmes was neither average, nor an idiot, and his life was far from dull. However, John insisted. John was tired, Sherlock was tired, and damn it, they were taking a holiday. And as usual since the army doctor limped into his life, Sherlock shut up and agreed with John’s assessment.
Ecstasy shared and consumed.
“Problem?” Sherlock felt like his stomach was going to plummet through the floor.
The door closes. Somehow, it feels different here, without the stress and fear of John bleeding out under his fingers, but he knows he needs to say it one last time. He’s not sure if John will remember, and he’s honestly not sure if he wants him to, but it feels wrong to leave this room with the words unspoken. Once more.
John doesn’t answer, too busy spreading the multi-colored canvas out on the sitting room floor. The furniture has been pushed back, chairs and the coffee table pushed to the side. The sight of all that empty space makes John pause his ministrations to remember other nights. Cleared spaces and violin waltzes, the feel of Sherlock’s lean body pressed close to his. Looking back, those dance lessons were an exquisite torture, being so close, but yet knowing that soon their time would be ending, soon John would be with Mary.  Thinking about it now, those nights learning the waltz were some of the best memories of that whole fiasco of a marriage. He should have known then that it was doomed to fail, that he’d never want to be anywhere except Baker Street, but he supposes hindsight’s always 20/20. Now after the dust is all settled, he's happy to be back home where he belongs.
Before he can even begin to reply, he hears the sound of the outer doors being breached. It appears that Mycroft has finally decided to join them. John is relieved, finally, Mycroft doing his damn job. But then Sherlock says something about the game being over, and Mary is raising her gun, aiming for Sherlock. John’s heart plummets and he doesn’t even think, reaching out and shoving Sherlock so hard that he stumbles across the floor. He can’t let her hurt him again, he won’t. He raises his gun out of instinct, pulling the trigger in an instant, the adrenaline coursing through his veins.
Sherlock laughed,
, this is what he had been waiting for, hoping for. And it is incredible. John can only think that he needs more, now. Below him, Sherlock is trembling with the strain of staying suspended, arms and legs shaking.
John turned his head, capturing Sherlock’s mouth in a lingering kiss, a sweet slide of lips that still managed to make his heart beat faster. “You’re welcome, love. Anything you need, anytime. You only have to ask. Got it?”
Sherlock smiled and leaned up to press his lips to John’s before pulling away with a contented sigh.
“Now you and I are going to have a quick chat,” he growls, turned fully in Mary’s direction.
John inwardly groans, but accepts. He knows how these things work, and no amount of griping is going to change the system. All he can hope for now is that he heals up enough to go home, and recover the rest of the way in peace. Home. Wherever that is now.
“It’s exactly the same!” Mary yells, taking a step forward, “You killed people under orders, and so did I.”
“Can ah kiss ye noo?”  He asked, stepping into Sherlock’s personal space, his face mere inches away.
“You move your ships.”
“Let’s get out of here, yeah?”
John leans up and kisses Sherlock again, pulling him down and slanting his mouth over Sherlock’s, the chaste affair quickly turning to something hungrier.
Unhappy.
“You need another shower.”
Spin. “Left foot yellow.” John puts a bit of Captain Watson in his tone, after all he is doling out orders, and he’s definitely not imagining the start of a flush blooming on those impossible cheekbones. Sherlock stretches his left leg to comply, balancing gracefully.
The wedding. Sherlock practically planned the whole thing. Honestly, John couldn’t tell you what colour the flowers were, or the bridesmaid dresses were. But Sherlock knew. John was amazed. He’d thought Sherlock would treat Mary the way he’d done all his other girlfriends, with disdain and ridicule. But Sherlock seemed to genuinely like her, going out of his way to make her feel welcome, even inviting her along on cases a couple of times. John had hated that, hated splitting one second of his time with Sherlock with Mary. And the two of them, always chatting about this and that, like old friends. John longed to shout at the pair of them. In all the madness, he just got swept up, pushed along, and before he knew it, he was pledging to love and honour Mary Morstan till death they do part. It wasn’t until the speeches started that he realised that he may have made a huge mistake.
