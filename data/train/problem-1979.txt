It was the last day of March, 2015, and John was only just now meeting Sherlock’s parents. They’d only been dating for two months, but you’d think, since they’d known each other five years, he’d have at least met them once. That’s what he told Sherlock last week while watching a movie on the couch, and Sherlock had squirmed in response.
John practically shoved the money in the cab driver’s face as he sprinted inside NSY. Ignoring the confused half-sentences from the detectives, he threw open the door to Lestrade’s office. The DI was nowhere to be seen, but on the desk was a note.
“Well, we are posing as a couple. We need to look the part.” John sighed and turned to the menu. A moment later, their waitress appeared.
He threw open the door to find two giant rubber boots visible under the door of one of the stalls. His heart sank as he knocked on the stall door.
“Alright, you can stay.” A blanket came seemingly out of nowhere and hit his side. Sherlock picked up the filthy thing and examined it. It seemed warm enough, though it smelled ghastly. He accepted the gift and found a spot on the floor to sleep on, though he didn’t actually get much sleep. Sherlock stayed in the den for a week before the other visitors grew suspicious. He wasn’t doing any hard stuff, only the cigarettes, which was strange.
“No problem. And if you ever need a wingman, just let me know. I’ll help you find a straight guy to fall for.”
“I know, but I just thought, since we know each other so well now, we might be on a nickname basis.” By now, Mycroft had regained his composure and had returned to his cool self. “Okay, you’re not on fire anymore. Good, that’s good. I’ll just call you Mike.” Moriarty walked away as unexpectedly as he had intervened. He lay on his back, floating on the water and occasionally paddling his hands so as not to go all the way back to the shore. He really was an enigma.
“Um, yeah. Sure. Excited. It’ll be great to relax while you guys watch him, for a change.” The doorbell rang again, and up came Molly, wearing a sundress over her swimsuit and donning a wide-brimmed hat. She had a big woven bag slung over one shoulder filled with stuff for the beach.
“I was invited to this gathering, as I am part of the family. And even if I weren’t, they’re my parents, too. I’m allowed to visit whenever I please.” He smirked at Sherlock. “What are we looking at?” he asked, addressing the people on the couch.
“Clammy hands, increased heart rate, increased perspiration, my face felt warm, and my stomach felt strange.” Mummy looked vaguely concerned for a few moments before smiling.
“Prove it,” challenged John. The two disappeared under the water. Molly looked at the ripples they’d left and sighed quietly. Lestrade put his arm around her.
Before long, it came time for Sherlock to pack his things and leave for Cambridge. Everything he wanted to bring went in boxes, and everything he didn’t want was taken to the attic by Mum before he could throw them away. He and Mum loaded the boxes into the boot of the car and then the only thing left was for Sherlock to say his goodbyes. First he went to the farm to say farewell to Redbeard.
“I’m sorry, I got sidetracked.” John noticed a small, flat lump under Sherlock’s blankets, near his right hand. He reached for it, but Sherlock was too quick and covered it with his hands.
One of Mycroft’s resolutions for the new year was to learn to play the violin gifted to him by Uncle Rudy. He took the instrument and bow out of the case and opened the lesson book to the first page. He tuned the violin and adjusted and rosined the bow. The first exercise in the book didn’t use the bow, though, so he put it back in the case. The exercise involved plucking the strings and learning their names, as well as how to play notes that required fretting. He had no trouble learning the theory, however, he had difficulty in actually playing the notes. He figured he would just need practice, and so he practiced every day. By Thursday, however, he still struggled with fretting, and the bow just made everything more difficult. He was getting very frustrated.
Sherlock came downstairs the next morning, wary and not knowing what to expect. He entered the kitchen to find Mum seated at the table, breakfast laid out for two. Dad, who was usually there to eat with them, was nowhere to be found. He must have left early to avoid eating with him. Sherlock was a little relieved, as he really didn’t want to face him after last night. He took his seat at the table and picked at the food. Mum had worked hard and made his favorite - eggs with chips and sausage. Sherlock wasn’t really in a good mood, but he wanted to show Mum his appreciation and smiled thankfully anyway.
“A missing persons and a murder. Possibly the missing person is the murderer, but evidence doesn’t look like it. The head officer on the case is a cousin of Lestrade’s, which explains why he’s so confused and needs our help.”
“Am I going to be arrested for drugs?” Sherlock never paid attention to laws. That was Mycroft’s area.
“Is everything alright, Victor?” asked Sherlock. “You seem upset about something.” Victor didn’t say anything, but looked around nervously. “Victor, you can tell me.”
“Whatever you say.” Mycroft decided that tomorrow he’d make a friend. He’d show his parents. He could do anything. Something so trivial as making pleasant conversation with a peer would be a piece of cake. Speaking of, Mycroft was ready for dessert.
“I’ll be back soon with your order,” she promised, turning to go inside. The boys sat silently for a while, John taking in the view and Sherlock scanning the restaurant for suspicious-looking people.
“Oh, hurry up, there’s no fun in going slow!” Jim shouted happily as he nearly shoved Mycroft in. When he came into contact with the freezing water, he grimaced.
“When you’re gone, can I use your room?” Sherlock asked Mycroft as they lay on the latter’s bed. It was stripped of its sheets and the room was practically bare, so it wasn’t like Mycroft planned on using it for anything when he’d come home. Mycroft was there to think about his last day at home. Sherlock was there because he was bored.
“Little did I know that you were not, in fact, like me, Sherlock,” said Mycroft suddenly, interrupting his narrative. “Of course, I knew I was smarter, we both did, but I didn’t think you cared. I always found it so exhausting to show emotions and care, and I assumed it was the same for you, too.”
In three years, Sherlock’s routine almost never varied. He was becoming a skilled violinist, and Redbeard was growing and as eager to play as ever. Sherlock was constantly improving and building on his observation skills and was making faster and more detailed deductions every day. Mycroft was growing more distant as he got older and more focused on university and finding a career, though he never failed to correct Sherlock when he made a mistake.
Everybody arrived on Friday, two days before Christmas. Uncle Rudy showed up first, and Mycroft was very excited to see him. Uncle Rudy was the best. He always brought cool stuff for Mycroft and enjoyed playing with him. Then Grandma and Granddad showed up. They were Daddy’s parents, and they were really nice. They brought candy, and it wasn’t the usual stuff you got in the shops. It was special stuff from Mycroft didn’t know where. It was tasty. Grandmother and Grandfather were the last to show up. Mycroft wasn’t sure how to feel about them. They were Mummy’s parents, and they were very strict. They were always criticizing Mycroft for manners, eating, and not studying enough. He couldn’t exactly tell his grandparents to go away, though, so he was stuck with a fake smile plastered on his face as he listened to all their problems. It was a wonder that Uncle Rudy turned out so cool with parents like that.
“Sherlock! Daisy just gave birth to a litter of puppies!” Daisy was the old irish setter who kept Sherlock company while he wandered the fields. Sherlock broke into a wide grin and ran to meet the farmer. They’d been waiting for this for a while, and now that the day was here, Sherlock couldn’t believe it. Puppies! Mr. Billings said he might even be able to bring one home in six weeks. They got to the house, and just inside the door lay Daisy, surrounded by four sleepy puppies. Sherlock immediately knelt down to pet them, and Daisy was happy to let him. She trusted him.
Around one in the afternoon, the guests showed up for the party. Sherlock still couldn’t walk on his own, but with the help of furniture and Mycroft’s hand, he made it around to all the guests to say hi. Since he couldn’t talk yet, this consisted of waving at them, clapping his hands, and squealing, though this delighted the guests just the same.
“Basic multiplication tables. Up to twelve times twelve. I’ll be done in less than five minutes. And I have to choose a new reading book to tell my classmates about. Apparently Animal Farm is too complex and disturbing.” He made a face, confused at his classmates’ inability to understand.
“We’ll take a look at these and see if there’s anything interesting in them,” he said to John. “Let me know what’s on that drive.” John nodded his head and went back to Baker Street. Mrs. Hudson came upstairs after him and he recounted to her the events of his day. She made them both some tea while John plugged the drive into his laptop. On the drive was an image of a desk. A very familiar desk.
“Here, mate.” Sherlock took the cig and headed back to his residence. Once there, he grabbed a match off the table and flopped down on the couch. He struck the match, struggling to keep his hands steady as he held it to the end of the cigarette. He finally lit it up and inhaled. He coughed and gagged, and it tasted horrible and disgusting, but he took another inhale, and then another.
“Yes, I think so,” he said, looking out the window towards the farm. Mum started the car, and they began the drive to Cambridge.
“John! Just who I need to see. I-” he stopped mid sentence. “I, uh.” His face was turning red. “I just remembered. I have a thing. To do. In there.” He went to his room blushing. John was confused. Sherlock almost never acted like this. He turned and saw himself reflected in the mirror above the fireplace. In his eagerness to type up the case, he had forgotten to wash the makeup off. Now it was John’s turn to blush. He buried his face in his hands. Then he heard a faint laughing sound coming from Sherlock’s room.
“I’ll just call Mycroft, find out where they are,” said John. The first ring went unanswered, but he picked up on the second.
The rest of Sherlock’s life wasn't so simple. His relationship with his dad had become strained since that horrible meeting, and his mum was caught in the middle. His parents had started fighting more, and it was usually about him. He’d overhear Mum yelling about how Dad was being unfair and how he should accept his son and show him some love. Dad would argue that homosexuality wasn’t necessarily bad, but it was still weird, and Sherlock was being petty and overdramatic in refusing to hear him out, so why should he even bother to reach out? When Mycroft was at home, he’d give Sherlock strange, searching looks, as if confused about something, though Sherlock didn’t know what that could be.
“I went inside, and they thought my pirate lunchbox was really cool, and so I showed them my other pirate stuff, and they seemed nice. Then the teacher told us to sit down, so we did, and she was saying what our class would be like. And I started asking questions. She didn’t like that. So then the kids picked on me because the teacher obviously thought I was a weirdo.” Mycroft gave him a hug.
“Do you have a girl over? Or, um, do you always sleep like that?” asked Victor. Sherlock narrowed his eyes.
“Mikey, what’s the matter? You came home in a mood and have been up here all afternoon and evening! I didn’t want to bother you, but you haven’t eaten since Billy’s party and I had to intervene.” Mycroft sighed and traced an imaginary pattern on his blanket.
“Sherlock, emotions aren’t… bad,” Mycroft said. He sat down on the bed next to Sherlock, who was now giving him a very confused look. “What I was trying to say, what I meant to say, is that… you shouldn’t care about what the other kids think. I suppose I assumed you knew what I meant.” Mycroft decided this was the simplest answer he could give.
“Shut up.” Sherlock looked away, but John could see the corners of his mouth turn upwards. They stood there for a bit, the waves lapping at their ankles. “Let’s go.”
Around eight in the evening, a knock on Mycroft’s door startled him. He invited the visitor in and saw that it was Mummy.
John Watson spent the twenty-first day of October running around London and chasing criminals, so he was all too happy to return to Baker Street that evening and sit back in his chair. Sherlock, however, had picked up a thread of investigation in a new, intriguing case, and so was pacing around the room excitedly.
Yes, I know the show said Sherlock was 8 during Carl Powers, but the show gave inconsistent dates so I had to pick my battles.
The next evening, Sherlock prepared to use his diplomatic voice again and went downstairs to ask Daddy about Redbeard.
“Sherlock, I’ve been thinking a lot lately, and I… I don’t know if I’m comfortable with you being… gay. What if you fall for me? That would be weird,” he added quietly.
“Sherlock, it’s Mum. May I come in?” she asked softly. Sherlock said nothing. “Sherlock, please, let me in,” she said, still using a gentle tone. Sherlock got up to unlock the door, and his mum opened it and came inside. Before Sherlock could go back to his bed, she gave him a hug. Sherlock was still silent.
“It hurt.” He stood for a moment, thinking. “Mycroft, I met a Bill Wiggins in a drug den last year. Is he the same one you were friends with?” Mycroft looked up, surprise written clear as day across his face for a moment before he composed himself.
Sherlock turned three in January, and was now talking in small sentences. Mycroft was glad because it was getting easier and easier to communicate with Sherlock and it took less effort on his part. Sherlock was also expressing an increasing interest in pirates. He wore his costume a lot and had taken to saying “arrgh” and “aye-aye” in response to some questions. In the fall, Mycroft began sixth year, his last year of primary school. He was eager to finish and move on to something more challenging.
Mycroft was very pleased with his gifts. He had gotten some comic books from Grandma and Granddad, and his parents had given him some too, as well as some candy and a book of puzzles (technically, that last one was from “Sherlock”, though Mycroft knew that wasn’t true). Grandmother and Grandfather had given him a “Boy’s Guide to Manners”. As soon as they weren’t looking, Mycroft put it in a bin at the very back of his closet. Uncle Rudy had gotten him a violin, though Mycroft didn’t play. Uncle Rudy thought that maybe it would be fun for Mycroft to learn, and would be beneficial to him. Mycroft decided it wouldn’t hurt to try, so he had no trouble smiling and saying thank you. Sherlock also got a good haul of presents. Mycroft had picked out for him a fuzzy blanket with bees on it, and the baby was over the moon about it. He seemed happy enough about the other presents (mainly picture books and stuffed animals), but the blanket stole the show.
“Hi!” he said cheerily. The boys waved back. “You enjoying P-Town so far?” he asked. They nodded. “It’s so refreshing to go somewhere and not have to worry about what could happen to us… it’s great.” The boys nodded again. “So how long have you two been together?” Sherlock and John both felt their cheeks grow hot as they stuttered an answer. Finally John got out “not long.” Their neighbor chuckled and gestured to his boyfriend.
Sherlock’s fourth birthday came around and it was pirate-themed. Mycroft devised a clever map that would lead the birthday boy to the treasure of birthday gifts, and Father made an excellent pirate cake that made Sherlock very happy. That summer, Sherlock spent lots of time running around with his sword at any beach they went to (they went to a lot, as Sherlock was very excited to be a real pirate in the ocean). Mycroft, meanwhile, honed his abilities and was progressing rapidly in general academics, but also observation and deduction. He could have skipped ahead to university if he really wanted to, but he didn’t feel like it.
“No, that won’t happen to us,” he declared, though deep down he knew it probably would. He went home that day in the lowest of spirits, not even saying hello to Sherlock, who was confused as to why Mycroft didn’t want to play. He trudged upstairs to his room, closed the door, and sat on his bed, tears silently streaming down his face. He read all their old comics, but that just made him more sad, and so he went to bed early that night, not even coming down for dinner.
“No, Sherlock, you did great,” said John. “I was just worried for you. But you’re fine, so there’s no reason to still be angry.” Sherlock gave a small smile that grew as John pulled him into a hug. “And you’re wearing the costume!” John drew his sword and poked him with it. Sherlock hissed jokingly in response.
“Mr. Holmes, excellent,” said Lestrade from behind. Sherlock whipped around and smiled politely. “Let’s use my office,” he said, leading Sherlock to a small room off of the main area. He directed Sherlock to a seat before taking one himself. “So, how are you feeling?”
“We need to look like we are.” John sighed. He was quickly growing tired of this case. More than anything, he just wanted to be back at Baker Street. He rifled around in his suitcase for his bathing suit and went into the bathroom to change. He would not be undressing in the same room as Sherlock for most definitely the rest of his life.
All December long, Musgrave Hall was filled with cheer and excitement for the coming holidays. Mycroft and Mummy decorated the house, and Sherlock helped (if you can call chewing on the garland helping). They made lots of sugary treats, and Mycroft got to ice the biscuits.
"Thank you, John." She grinned. "It's your turn now!" John gave a deep breath and hoped it wouldn't be too bad.
“Alright,” John said. “But never show these to anyone other than us three.” Click. Then the bathroom door opened, and out came Lestrade, looking as if he had never been roped into the fashion show. His face was plain and he was back in his normal clothes.
“No, since you overdosed.” Sherlock nodded his head. Just then, someone who was clearly with the police walked in. He had once-dark hair that was graying, a round nose, and almond-shaped eyes.
“No, I know it wasn’t, but you’re the one on the phone. Tell Molly and Mrs. Hudson I say thank you.”
“The police are wrong,” said Sherlock. “He didn’t drown. Something happened. His shoes are missing.”
“Moriarty, could Sherlock and I be partners? Please?” Jim rolled his eyes. He wasn’t relenting. “Mycroft, do something.”
The waitress brought their meals, and the boys ate in mostly silence. Sherlock was focused on the case, and John simply didn’t know what to say.
“Thanks, Mike,” Bill answered, admiring the rainbow of colors. “I’m really gonna miss you,” he added. “London seems kinda scary.”
The rest of the trip followed a similar pattern. People wouldn’t wait for an explanation and assume they were a couple, then the boys would nod along, flustered, and awkwardly attempt to show affection. One time, Sherlock came out of nowhere and kissed John on the cheek. Lestrade had managed to snap a picture, much to John’s chagrin. But now the case was solved, Sherlock lauded, and it was time to head back to London. They made it to Boston long before they needed to be at the airport, so they decided it would be fun to walk around a bit. They didn’t have a particular destination in mind; they just went wherever they felt like. At some point, they passed a bakery, and Lestrade wanted to go in. He went to go get some pastries (it was a very late flight and they were hungry), and Sherlock and John waited outside. Neither of them spoke a word, but Sherlock seemed strangely on-edge. John chalked it up to being in a strange new city that Sherlock hadn’t committed to memory yet.
Bury Three Barrels Gunpowder Red Lion George New Scott’s New Bell. John’s new list made a bit more sense now, though not much. New bell? Red Lion? And who’s George? John added the endings back to the ones that didn’t make sense. Bury Three Barrels Gunpowder Red Lion Court George New Scott’s New Bell Yard. Still that New Bell Yard. New Bell Yard… New Scotland Yard? New Scott’s… aha! John crossed the New Bell off. His list now read Bury Three Barrels Gunpowder Red Lion Court George New Scott’s Yard. It was starting to make a bit more sense now. He grouped the words together, hoping to provide some further structure to the information. Bury Three Barrels (of) Gunpowder. Red Lion Court. George, New Scott’s Yard. But who was George?
Hang on. If Sherlock called Greg the wrong name, maybe other people did, too. John went back over to the desk where his puzzle remained. Bury Three Barrels (of) Gunpowder. Red Lion Court. George (Greg), New Scott’s Yard. Now it was making more sense. John would go to NSY and ask Lestrade if the first part of the sentence meant anything to him. But first, he’d finish his soup.
“I’m really sorry about that,” he told Sherlock. “But you’re welcome to visit him anytime, and I won’t let him get adopted by anyone else.” Sherlock nodded his head sadly and gave Redbeard a scratch behind the ears.
“Sherlock! Long time, no see, eh?” he asked, clapping a hand round his shoulder. Sherlock smiled in return.
Within minutes, Lestrade came out of the bathroom. He was dressed in a leather biker outfit that Mrs. Hudson had had in her room (now don’t ask why), a pink feather boa, and knee-high magenta leather cowboy boots. He sighed and strutted down the runway, giving it his all. Mrs. Hudson and John cheered and whooped and clapped as he posed and turned. As he walked back up the runway, he had a big smile on his face. He came back to join the others.
“Don’t worry about it,” said Sherlock. “I’m not mad. I just thought you should know, so you can treat your dog. If my dog were sick, I’d want to know about it.” Victor nodded.
“I told you, Sherlock,” said Mycroft. “Now, let me see your arm.” Sherlock pulled it away before a look from his brother made him do otherwise. Mycroft rolled up the sleeve to find a dark bruise. “Who did this to you?”
“Are you sure you don’t need breakfast?” Victor pressed. “We can stop if you want.” Sherlock shook his head.
In late November of 2009, Sherlock helped out a nice old lady named Martha Hudson. Her husband had been sentenced to death for drugs and for blowing someone’s head off, and had cheated on her, too, so Sherlock made sure that he was executed. She offered him a deal on a flat she owned in central London, in Baker Street. He’d get a discount on rent for his help with the case, but he had to find someone to live with him. Mrs. Hudson was all too aware of the effect of drugs, and though Sherlock had been to rehab and was clean (he even used nicotine patches over cigarettes), she wanted to make sure he would stay that way. It took him two whole months to find a suitable roommate, but in the end, it was worth it.
John got a cab to NSY and went inside the building. People were bustling about, working hard to make up for the lack of help from the still-missing Sherlock. He saw Sergeant Donovan and approached her.
Mummy dropped Sherlock off first and Mycroft second. When they pulled into the school lot, Sherlock practically jumped out of the car and would’ve ran straight for the door if it weren’t for Mycroft. He grabbed him by the shoulder and kneeled down so they were eye-to-eye.
“Wow, John, that’s the funniest thing I’ve heard all day,” Sherlock said without changing his expression in the slightest. John scowled.
“Really sorry about that, by the way,” he added. “I only just got Ace a month ago, and he still needs to be trained.”
Mycroft was sitting cross-legged on the ground in front of a globe, spinning it and stopping it with his finger. He was trying to figure out what language to learn next by choosing the country his finger landed on, but he kept hitting languages he’d already learnt. Uncle Rudy sat on the sofa to his left, perusing a fashion catalogue that Mycroft thought was dull. Mummy and Daddy were at the hospital getting his new baby brother, and they were going to come home today. Mycroft, at the suggestion of Uncle Rudy, had made him a welcome home card, which was next to him on the ground. He had drawn him and the baby with their parents on either side. On the inside of a card, he and the baby were wearing superhero capes and they were punching a bad guy. He had worked very hard on it, and was excited to show it to the baby.
“Figure it out,” replied Mycroft with a smile. The two brothers walked for what to Sherlock seemed ages to get to town.
“Hello?” he called, trying to keep his voice level as he walked down a long corridor. “Anyone there? Sherlock? Greg? Molly? Are you guys here? Are you safe?” He kept walking, gun in front of him, ready to fire. At last he came to an open space. He could dimly make out shapes on the catwalk above, staying stock-still. He pointed the gun to the ceiling, and fired a few warning shots. “I’m armed, so you better answer me. Where are my friends?” He was getting angry now. Just as he was about to shoot one of the shapes, the lights flashed on.
“No, never. Gross. Emotions, especially love, just get in the way of that,” he said, gesturing to the chemical mess. “You said yourself. Caring is not an advantage.” Mycroft was rendered speechless for once. Maybe caring wasn’t the right word for what he had been trying to tell Sherlock so long ago. After all, he cared for Sherlock, and Billy, and he was on track to running the whole of the UK. In fact, he was only successful because he cared so much about losing Billy all those years ago. Caring could hardly be called a disadvantage. But that’s the word he’d chosen, because he didn’t know any better words. And Sherlock had taken that idea and run with it.
“It’s not like I’ve fallen in love with anyone or anything like that. So technically, I’m not showing emotions.” Mycroft nodded, still confused.
“Hello, Sherlock,” he said to the toddler when he walked inside. Sherlock waved and smiled, happy to see his brother for once. Mycroft patted him on the head. In that moment, he decided he’d never go away like that again. For that to happen, he had to shield himself off from the rest of the world, so he couldn’t be sad like that again. He found it surprisingly easy to switch off that part of him. In fact, not caring was so much easier than caring. It was almost as if Mycroft really didn’t care about anything but Sherlock.
“What happens when you burn it?” Sherlock put it on the burner. Just as he expected, nothing really happened. He struck a match and held it directly to the soil, and it started to smoke a bit, but all in all, it was pretty dull.
“Would you like to stay for a cuppa?” asked Billings, sensing that there was something utterly wrong. Sherlock refused the offer, however, and practically ran home. He ran upstairs to his room, and slammed the door shut. He picked up his violin, but his hands were shaking too much. He settled for another cigarette, and the room was hazy when he finally went down to dinner. He sat sulkily in his seat and angrily stabbed a forkful of food.
“Probably. I’ll heat up a bottle, you go enjoy talking to my delightful parents,” he said, rummaging in the supply bag for a milk bottle. John did so and left the room. The bottle heated up and ready, Sherlock was feeding Rosie when he heard a low chuckle from downstairs. Apparently everyone had moved to the sitting room. When Rosie was done with the milk, he brought her with him downstairs. “Let’s go see what everybody’s doing,” he whispered to her, her head resting on his shoulder.
“Well, um, Sherlock, he doesn’t quite… understand…” She faltered. “I’m sure he just needs time,” she finished, unsure. Sherlock nodded his head in understanding.
“We’re aware, yes. I don’t think it’s of any importance,” he dismissed. “How old are you?” Sherlock sighed.
All during the morning classes, Sherlock’s mind was preoccupied by what had happened. He couldn’t sit still, and he was having trouble focusing on the lessons. Then again, he rarely paid attention anyway. But the fact that he was focusing on a fellow classmate was strange. When lunch came, he skipped it and headed to the library, where there were a few computers to use for research. He logged on and went to a new website called WebMD. You could type in your symptoms and it would tell you what was wrong. He entered his symptoms and waited for the results.
Sherlock was considering getting out of bed one day when there was a knock on the door. He got up, wrapped the sheet round himself and went to answer it. He opened the door to find Victor standing there, out of breath. He had clearly run all the way from his residence.
“Oh, she was doing so well,” he said, sighing. “Is she hungry?” Sherlock facepalmed, disappointed for not remembering that.
After presents, it was time for cake. Everyone was amazed at Mycroft’s stunning work, especially Sherlock.
“Great! Now, I think I’ll partner up with Sherlock,” said Moriarty, putting an arm around his shoulder.
“Are you sure you want her?” He asked his friend in a low voice. “You could do loads better. She has a reputation for partying, which is clearly true. I’ve done a study on the long-term signs of the occasional use of different liquors and drugs. She’s a big spender on a small paycheck, too, I mean, look at that dress, it’s expensive, and so’s her jewelry, but the dress has been rehemmed and its cleaning job is far from professional. Not very responsible, in my opinion,” Sherlock said quickly, rattling off his observations. “I’d say she also has a boyfriend right now, and he’s cheating too, based off of…” Sherlock trailed off, suddenly aware of a pair of eyes burning the back of his head. He turned around to see Sally glaring at him.
Great. Another puzzle. Just what he needed. He examined the paper closely. It smelled like coffee and aftershave. The ink was slightly smeared in some places. It must have been written by Lestrade in a hurry. But what was the message? He looked at the numbers. The alphabet has 26 letters, and this note only had numbers up to 25. Then again, the odds are not all the letters were used. What numbers correspond to what letters? John decided to try the simplest approach of a = 1, b = 2, all the way down to z. That would explain the lack of a 26. John turned out to be right, and the deciphered message read:
“Yes,” John had answered. “I have so many questions.” Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him. John put his arms around Sherlock. “Please? If they’re anything like you, they must be amazing.” John hoped the flattery would work, and hoped even more that Sherlock wouldn’t see through it. Sherlock sighed overdramatically.
They finished their meal, and once they’d paid the bill, they left for the rental house. It was now completely dark out, save for the lights of town and a smattering of houses. It was quiet and peaceful, just the two of them walking under the stars.
“Of course it would, Gavin.” Lestrade opened his mouth to complain but was cut off. “I’m going to see if there’s a pattern that determines which crabs are more sociable than the others.”
“John, you have to be gentle, see?” He moved his hands slowly but kept a firm hold on his creation. He moved his arm back and launched it right between Mycroft’s shoulder blades. He quickly shifted his hands behind his back as if he had done nothing. Mycroft turned and glared at the pair. “It was John,” blamed Sherlock. Mycroft saw through this and kept a cool stare with Sherlock. He turned back around slowly. It was John’s turn to launch a sand ball at Mycroft. He moved so he was slightly behind Sherlock in case Mycroft tried to get him. Mycroft turned around and his eyes flashed. He drew a deep breath.
“We should do chicken-fights!” Mycroft’s brow frowned in confusion, as did Sherlock’s.  Everybody else looked either amused or excited at the idea.
Sherlock’s excellent tactics combined with Molly’s strength meant a sure win for the two friends. The gang played a few more rounds with various teams (but in the end just reverted back to their original ones) before realizing how late it was. The sun was low in the sky when they walked back up the beach to where Mrs. Hudson was waiting.
“Thanks, I guess,” he said nervously. “Um, do you want to be friends, maybe? I don’t know anybody here, well, I guess none of us do, I mean, we’re all new here, and… sorry,” he said again.
He closed his notebook and sighed. This wasn’t exactly useful information. It mostly just got him either weird looks or a black eye. Nobody needed you to tell them they’d been smoking. That was considered impolite. Offensive. He’d been sent to the headmaster’s office numerous times for upsetting people. Sometimes Sherlock wondered why he still bothered with this. He went downstairs, looking for something interesting to do, when the headline on the newspaper resting on a table caught his attention. Tragic Carl Died ‘Doing What He Loved’. Sherlock opened the paper to read the article. A boy named Carl Powers had died while swimming. The article said drowned. But there were many things about the case that didn’t quite make sense. All of Carl’s clothes had been in his locker, except his shoes. The article listed out the contents of the locker. The police either didn’t notice or didn’t care, for it wasn’t brought up as something important. Where were his shoes? Just then, Mycroft walked in. Sherlock didn’t even look up to say hello.
“London. And we’re leaving at the end of August.” Mycroft felt his eyes water up, but he didn’t want to cry right now.
“Mikey, is this true?” asked Mrs. Holmes, a horrified expression on her face. Mycroft was not in the position to correct her on his name, and continued to stare guiltily at his shoes. “I’m disappointed in you. You told your little brother to stop feeling emotions?”
“What’s that you’re reading?” Mycroft approached the table, standing just behind Sherlock’s shoulder to read the entry for himself.
“Redbeard was my dog. Just because I couldn’t bring him home doesn’t mean he wasn’t mine.” Nobody talked for the rest of the meal.
John finished his breakfast and brought his and Sherlock’s plates to the sink. He scraped Sherlock’s leftovers into a container to save. No use wasting more food and energy on breakfast tomorrow when he still had so much left. He brushed his teeth and then, for the first time all morning, sat down in peace. Less than ten minutes later, the doorbell rang. He heard Mrs. Hudson get it, and muffled voices exchanging pleasant greetings. A few seconds later, the door opened and in came Lestrade. The sunscreen on his face wasn’t totally rubbed in, and he was wearing big sunglasses. He was wearing a floral print vacation shirt and swim trunks.
“So, Mrs. Holmes, I hear you were a math genius,” ventured John, stabbing a forkful of food. Mrs. Holmes smiled.
“I’m sorry, John. I just thought, since Halloween is supposed to be scary, it would be fun. I know you were looking forward to it, so I planned a surprise party for you and I got these guys in on it. We thought you’d enjoy it,” he said, downcast. “And I did tell you I was fine.” John’s hardened eyes softened, and he felt bad. Sherlock had worked really hard on this, and it had been exciting to go on a case by himself.
“I believe you’d say I’m doing it for fun, though there is an ulterior motive.” Victor nodded his head.
“So did Billy.” Mycroft stood there for a moment. “I think I’ll head out now. Charming to see you all. Goodbye, Rosie.” He turned and walked out the door.
“What’s the matter, Billy?” asked Mycroft once all the other guests left. They were sitting on Billy’s front porch, snacking on some candy. Billy fiddled with the hem of his shirt.
“And what about the other one?” he asked. “He’s never fancied anyone. Is he gay, too? Or does he not like anyone at all?” Dad barked a harsh, joyless laugh. Sherlock trembled in his bed, trying to dismiss the pain. Trying to ignore the venom in the words directed at him. Trying to do what he’d done for nine years. Roll with the punches. Ignore the bruises.
He heard a thump and got no response from the detective that was allegedly in the shower. He picked the lock and saw Sherlock laying in the bath, he had fallen and cut his head, blood tainted the water and even though John had seen enough blood and injury for a life time, the sight of his bleeding unconscious flatmate disturbed him. He brushed away those thoughts and lifted Sherlock so that he sat up against the back of the tub.
John gathered a washcloth and Sherlock’s overpriced shower gel and shampoo from his bag before joining him in the shower. He ran the bar of hotel soap over the white cloth and began to gently wipe away the soot that littered his boyfriends face. He washed the dark curls and grimaced as his fingers brushed a cut that made Sherlock flinch in pain.
The court was dismissed. Unlike the last time the room was let out, Sherlock was the last to leave. He sat quietly with Johns hand firmly on his knee and the doctors gaze nearly burning a hole in his face. When there was no one left but the two of them, John stood and extended his hand for Sherlock to take. They waited for their cab along with Mrs. Hudson, who kept audibly quiet but her sympathetic eyes were deafeningly loud. John kept a close watch on his partner, almost desperate for a sign that Sherlock was in distress and needed him to come to his rescue, but troublesome sorrows never showed across the detectives face.
Sherlock steepled his hand under his chin, “I know who took Emily Trevor, I don’t know where she is yet, but I know who took her.” John and Greg’s eyes both lit up and the DI moved closer to the edge of his seat, “alright who? Let’s arrest them and force them to tell us where- “

Thank you so much for reading, can't wait to see you back for the final chapter!
Sherlock’s alarm went off around 7:30 and he groaned as he reached for his phone on the bedside table to quickly quiet the obnoxious sound. He sighed and looked at John who seemingly hadn’t moved since they fell asleep last night. Sherlock turned onto his side to face John, softly caressing the doctor’s jawline. Sherlock smiled shyly and blushed as he remembered he and John were both still nude from the events of a few hours ago. John’s eyes fluttered open and he made a soft moan as he stretched. “Good morning, beautiful.” John’s voice was raspy and incredibly sexy first thing in the morning, and if Sherlock hadn’t been blushing before-he certainly was now. He mumbled a good morning back to his blogger, “I’m going to get dressed and work on this case.” John nodded but made no attempt to get up. Sherlock stood next to the bed and quickly wrapped his burgundy dressing gown around his thin frame and walked a few steps down the hall to their bathroom.
John began to dry Sherlock off, starting with his hair and moving down. When he reached Sherlocks arms he realized that there probably hundrents of cuts, some healed and scared over, some new, and some healing.
Sherlock smiled and John could feel it against his bare chest, “really good…” he trailed off “like I want to go again.”
John went downstairs, ordered the food and picked a few movies. Sherlock arrived minutes later In his favorite blue dressing gown and gray pj pants.
The dark  curled pulled away from the microscope and a crinkle on the pale forehead gave away the mans confusion, “ yes, fine, why?”
Sherlock’s lips kept moving but it was as if a nuclear bomb had gone off in Greg’s mind, all he could hear was ringing. He remember Victor telling him about the custom made toy that had made Greg squirm with second hand pain. Surly it couldn’t have been the same toy, surly it couldn’t have been Sherlock it was used on.
John grabbed Sherlock hips and pulled him in close to his own, kissing his lover hard as their tongues fought for dominance. John began walking Sherlock back towards the couch before he assertively threw the detective on the cushions and climbed on top of him. Sherlock’s eyes went wide in surprise but grew dark with lust as he grabbed the front of John’s shirt and once again pulled him closer to him and back into a kiss. John began grinding his quickly growing erection into Sherlock’s and began undoing Sherlock’s shirt as the darker haired man began tugging at his. The two quickly found themselves in only their boxers, limbs tangled together and growing more desperate for friction. “you’re so incredible, baby.” John murmured against Sherlock’s skin and the detective all the but preened at the compliment and pet name. “bed. Now please.” Sherlock said desperately. John nodded and picked him up as Sherlock wrapped his legs around John’s waist. John carried his lover to Sherlock’s bedroom, “I’m going to give you a much different reason to wash these sheets.” He teased and Sherlock relaxed in his arms, letting out a breathy giggle.
" I didn't think they could help, and if he found out the punishment would have been horrible and probably would have killed me."
“ we have time before we need to get ready… play something for me.” John took the violin from its case and passed it to Sherlock along with the bow. “ play and ill fix breakfast.”
Sherlock stripped and got in the shower, turning the water as hot as he could stand it. His once ivory skin began to turn red, as if he had spent all day laying in the sun. He grabbed his loofa and body wash and scrubbed at his skin, especially over the spots Victor had touched. No matter how much soap he used or how hard he scrubbed he couldn’t seem to feel clean. He finally let himself have the moment he had been fighting off, he was in the shower after all no one could see him cry there.
“it was exclusive to oral. The plug was always kept inside me during these times.” The judge nodded for him to continue. “ the events happened at least once every week but more often than not, multiple times. I’m sure your wondering what finally made me leave. I wish I had a key moment that made things change but I didn’t. there just came a day that I knew I had to leave before he killed me. Your honor, I believe one day he would have killed me. I packed all my things and left while he was at work one day. I moved cities, I switched to an exclusive private university, and I created a job and began trying to forget the five years I spent with this vile human being. I have suffered the consequences of substance abuse, eating disorders and self-mutilation that have led to hospitalization on many occasions, not to mention severe emotional and mental trauma. I don’t want your sympathy not pity, I ask that you and the jury will consider the evidence and testimony given and make the right decision to remove this dangerous man from society.” Sherlock felt lightheaded and was grateful to quickly take a seat.
“Alright, no rush. Do you want to go home and order take out or go out to dinner?” John asked, leaning his head lightly on Sherlock’s upper arm.
“I’m sorry, I…I’m just really cold. I should have known not to touch you” she rambled barely above a whisper and began to detach herself from the taller man.
As they walked, they casually bumped into each other like always and Sherlock pulled Johns jacket tighter around him. Upon returning home Sherlock went to lay on the couch and fell asleep.
John held the door for Molly as she walked into the lab, the two of them still discussing the state of the corpse they had examined. When John came into view, he did a quick glance around the room and furrowed his eyebrows at the lack of Victor’s presence. Molly left murmuring on about how busy she was and she would see them later, her eyes took a few extra moments to linger on Sherlock who, of course, didn’t respond.
I have been in the SHERLOCK fandom since 2013, and in 2015 -when I started writing this- I was at the peak of self destruction. I was passing out in the school bathroom and acting like everything was fine when I got home. I actively self harmed from 2011- spring 2016.
John laughed softly and positioned his thick cock at his lovers’ entrance, “patience, needy boy.” He teased kissing the nape of Sherlock neck. He teased his cock over Sherlock’s tight hole a few times before slowly pushed inside. They both groaned in sync and John let his hand grip on Sherlock hip and thrusted into him. It was even slower paced than last night, but it was perfect for what it was. Sherlock wasn’t sore, but a little more sensitive. They continued until John once again finished inside of his lover and Sherlock was a sticky mess. They were sweating and out of breath. John held Sherlock tight to his chest and whispered compliments and pet names into his ear.
"Not this one. I don't want any of her relatives to know I ever looked at this. I mean it Lestrade, my name is never mentioned in the context of this crime scene ever." With that Sherlock moved quick to leave and get a cab, John had to run to catch up with him.
" do you want me to promise to send Mycroft flowers too?" Sherlocks comment didn't come across with anger like it may have sounded, it was just sarcastic.
“shit” Greg said in exasperation. “John, I know this isn’t what you want to hear, and I don’t want to say it, but I think we’re just gonna have to trust him and wait this one out. I say we give him another twelve hours and then we will notify the police.”
“well, actually I was hoping to stick around for a bit. I told Lestrade it would be a while before id be back since he’s occupied anyway and unless you want me to tell him that you kicked me out because we used to be boyfriends then I suggest you let me stay.” Victor had a teasing tone in his voice, and he walked towards Sherlock. “Where’s John at?”
"Not a word to my brother" Mycroft said seriously as he got into the car that had been waiting for him.
John knew what statement was coming next. He also knew it would be new information for most of the courtroom. As the judge spoke he subconsciously mouthed the words along with her, “ you are choosing to represent yourself  against the defendant Victor Trevor on the charges of domestic abuse and sexual assault, correct?”
“you are incredible, baby.” John praised him and he smiled. “you’re so fucking hot.” He continued, pulling Sherlock into another kiss. Sherlock threw one of his long legs over John’s’ hips and began grinding his ass on John’s’ wet cock, his own leaking pre-come onto the doctor’s lower abdomen.
When John came back, they took up their positions until it was time to go to bed. Sherlock got up leaving Johns lap feeling cold and empty.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “ oh yes, because you always let me know about your decisions.” He said sarcastically.
" well I'm done for now. If you need anything John just ring. Oh and you too sherlock." She smiled flirtatiously and handed John a small slip of paper.
Sherlock smirked, “Besides, that wouldn’t work. He knows John and I are together. It needs to be you. He trusts you; god knows you already spend half the day together.”
When the water began to go cold, they washed one another and Sherlock managed to sway John to get out first so that he could dry off and put on his dressing gown without risking John seeing his thigh. When the taller man exited the bathroom, John was packing items into a backpack. Sherlock had his burgundy silk robe on and pressed himself to John’s bare back, wrapping his arms around his shoulders. “what are you doing?” he asked curiously. “I decided to pack a bag with a few things for Emily, hoping she’s alive. I put some water and a few of those electrolyte packets, some granola bars, and a small first aid kit.” John sighed “it’s not much but it’s the best I could think of.” Sherlock smiled against the top of John’s shoulder, “I’m sure she will appreciate it. I wouldn’t have thought of it.”
“oh save it.” Greg said slamming his hand down on the metal table. “you knew exactly what you were doing…this whole time! Thank god for Sherlock Holmes or else your poor sister would probably be dead, not that you would care.”
He remembers it vividly, like he does everything if he lets himself dwell. It should have been the last act too. It was only two months into their relationship, he was head over heels in love with the popular red haired boy that captivated everyone. Sherlock had made a snarky remark as he and Victor descended the stairs to their next class, they were alone in the stairwell when he smacked Sherlock across the face…before the dark haired boy could even register what happened Victor was apologizing profusely, cupping his face in his hands and kissing over the red mark. Sherlock forgave him. He forgave him that time, and the time after that, and so fourth.
Mr. Holmes was a loving man, uncharacteristically gentle for a man of his time, always soft spoken and thoughtful with his words. He never acted from a place of anger. He accepted Sherlock wholeheartedly when he came out as gay, he was proud of his younger sons work and accomplishments. But never did he prepare himself for the feelings that overwhelmed him when he read over the article in the paper. In his time, men didn’t talk about sexual assault against other men and they definitely didn’t come forward about it. Mr. Holmes is a progressive man and had made himself overcome most of his prudence against the topic in recent years, even making donations in support of legal help for victims both male and female. However, it all felt very distant, things he heard on the television and forgot about by the next day, but this was his son. The boy he taught to walk, talk, read, drive, and to never apologize for being who he is had been defiled in a way he never thought possible. Much like his wife, he couldn’t help but feel responsible and guilty in one way or another. He vowed to always protect his family and he felt as if he had failed his son. Mr. Holmes’s vision of his son grew as Sherlock did, and for many years now he always saw Sherlock as a brilliant detective and man but now looking at him in the small living room of his flat he saw a little boy. His little boy. The same one whose eyes were glassed over and afraid of an outcome from breaking one of his father’s gardening tools while pretending to be a pirate.
“mind if I just…stay here a bit.” Johns body was fighting to restore his cardiac and respiratory rate to normal levels. Sherlock just shrugged and began releasing the water in his bath to replenish with warm. John was nearly calm when he saw the blades stuck to the tape on the counter. “ Sherlock, were you going to…where have you been keeping these?”
The morning passed being rather uneventful, Sherlock spent most of his time catching up on recording the results of his bacteria garden.
The detective teased him until shiny precome glazed over the head of his cock. Sherlock finally took him into his mouth and hummed in satisfaction as he began bobbing up and down on his boyfriend. Sherlock preened at John’s whispered ‘yes’s and ‘ god, just like that’s’ that came between compliments to Sherlock’s oral skills. The detective felt around the floor for the lube he had set down earlier and popped the cap off with his fingers, catching John’s attention. Sherlock spread the clear gel across two of his fingers as he pulled off of John’s cock and rested his head on his lover’s strong thigh. The doctor watched him with lust filled eyes as Sherlock reached behind himself and began pumping the slicked fingers in and out of himself.
After seated at their normal table Angelo came out, " ah my boys! Sherlock I heard you were in the hospital! What happened? You alright now, no?"
“By playing double agent obviously,” Sherlock stated. “you need to flirt with him, take him to dinner, to the pub, I don’t care where. Make him open up to you about things other than the case-get him to tell you about his life, interests, hobbies - come on Lestrade didn’t they teach you any of this?”
Mycroft gave his brother an odd look, “Sherlock. I told you the therapist I hired was female. I don’t know that man.”
Sherlock turned and raised his left arm, “ if you look closely you can see his name underneath the scars I put on myself.”
"Treat me like I'm broken. Even though I may be and only to you would I admit it, but I don't want you to treat me any different than you usually do."
John had always been concerned about Sherlock’s weight. The man looked so fragile, like he could break at any moment. Maybe it was because John was a doctor or maybe because he was his friend but either way Sherlock’s dwindling weight had gotten out of control. That morning at breakfast John offered him a piece of toast but he insisted he wasn't hungry. Same at lunch and dinner.
John chuckled, it was the opposite of what he was trying to do…he was trying to make Sherlock feel alive. Bring him to the brink of hypersensitivity over and over again until he could only fall apart at the touch of John’s hands.
The curly haired man look up and nodded " I understand if that's not what you want. I mean how could you want me, look at me."
Sherlock cut her off, “it’s not been a while ago. I still try to starve myself every chance I get, just two nights ago I took a blade to my leg; if it wasn’t for John, I probably would have bled out a few months ago alone in my bathtub.” The detective surprised even himself with the amount of personal information that had just rolled off his tongue.
Mark, a tall man with slicked back brunette hair came into their flat at 7 that morning. Sherlocks eyes widened, " Mycroft said my therapist was female."
When your mind is as active as Sherlock’s you can’t spend lingering moments counting sheep, you count doubts, insecurities, moments you wish you could change or have done differently. He began to worry if this could be the straw that broke the camel’s back for his and John’s relationship. Would John feel betrayed? Would he think Sherlock didn’t trust him or that their relationship had changed how they solved cases together? Worst of all, he had promised John he would never leave him again like he did when he faked his death. He promised he would never put him through something like that again. But what if he didn’t make it out of the tunnels alive…would John resent him even in death? These thoughts were all very valid and made the detective feel all the more guilty for leaving his lover behind.
The detective nodded; his eyes looked heavy with fatigue now rather than lust. John turned on the tap and let it warm up as he pressed a few gentle kisses to Sherlock’s lips, “ want to call it an early night?” another nod.
“Mr. Trevor do you have any witnesses or evidence to support these claims before we move on with the trial?” the judge asked taking down notes.
It was nearing John’s lunch at the clinic; he was discussing a treatment plan with an older woman with skin cancer when his PA knocked at his door. She opened it and gave an apologetic smile, “Dr. Watson, I’m sorry for the interruption. Could I speak with you a moment?” She announced earning a questioning look from John. He excused himself and followed Sarah back to his office.
There was a fire lit behind Sherlock’s eyes, “It is over. It has been for a long time. It’s ALL over.” His voice was strong and clear, surprising even himself.
Sherlock sat shell-shocked. There was a lot of truth in what John said and it cut deep. He blinked a few times, but John’s gaze never left him.
I BEGAN THIS STORY 5 YEARS AGO (2015) and have recently picked it back up(2020). I would like to think my writing has grown significantly since then and would really like to encourage you to continue reading this story even if it seems subpar until chapter 16. Also, if you wish for me to go back and correct/ add more detail to previous chapters I am open to doing that. Thank you! Lots of love <3
He and John lay there with each other just talking about different things wrapped in each others arms. John grew quiet and his breathing became deeper, he had fallen asleep. Sherlock smiled at the sleeping figure and cradled John's head close to his chest, dropping kisses on it every now and then.
“Sherlock, I’m so happy for you! Tell me about him!” she paused and stuttered “I mean, if you want to. Sorry.”
‘John, you will let me know if something begins to go terribly wrong, wont you?” Mycroft asked, the sentiment he hated so much reappearing in his tone.
Sherlock stood from his desk and sat down across the table from John. The doctor gave him a quick smile and scooted the detective’s tea closer to him."Do you want any toast or strawberries?" he asked.
“picked the wrong shoes, posh boy.” Billy teased “don’t feel too bad, there usually ain’t much water down here unless it’s raining hard- which it is now.”
“wh-why? Sherlock, what happened today was, well it was sick!” John stood from his chair and watched the detective do the same, both taking a few steps towards one another.
Happy update day! I hope you all are doing well! I want to say thank you so much for reading my story, i truly can't believe we have hit over 12,000 readers! It means so much to me and i hope you continue to like this story as it begins to finish up! Stay healthy and safe, lots of love...
"Well, I guess it would depend on what I'm eating, although I hardly understand how this is important John. We aren't eating."
The alarm blared on John’s nightstand early the next morning. He reached over and laid a heavy hand on the off button before gently caressing Sherlock’s arm in an attempt to wake him. The detective stirred slightly, opening one eye to look at John.
Emily’s face scrunched up in anger as she stood from her seat, “your honor, that’s a blatant lie!” she said aggressively.
Sorry it's a bit late but here it is! I really hope you all enjoy it, i'm still really new to writing smut haha
Emily shot a quick glance at him, “ are you crazy?! Normally you walk away from the things that tried to kill you!”
“first, thank you. I’m glad I could help satisfy you this morning. No, you’re right John. I didn’t get an erection this morning, in fact I almost never do whenever we mess around.” Johns face fell a bit “and it’s not because I’m not enjoying myself or because I’m not sexually aroused by you because god knows I am, John. I mean I wouldn’t drop to my knees and swallow ejaculate for just anyone” John chuckled a little at Sherlocks medically correct terminology “but I just can’t seem to get an erection when we are being physical, not right now anyways. And you’re right again, I did become uncomfortable when the attention was directed towards me. I don’t have an explanation as to why that is. My best deduction is that most of what I fear about sex is because of the things that were done to me, I’m apprehensive and fearful when its ‘my turn’ to receive. I feel overwhelmed and, in some ways, very trapped when you’re trying to please me. Even sometimes when you’re on top of me, just kissing I get nervous.” Sherlock finished his thought avoiding direct eye contact with John. The doctor lifted Sherlocks chin and gave him a soft kiss, “thank you for telling me that. That actually makes a lot of sense, love. I’m sorry that I have made you feel trapped and overwhelmed at times. Sherlock as much as I love receiving blowjobs, kisses, and all the things you are confident enough to give me- I can’t help but want to return the pleasure back to you. I know how selfish a lot of men are in bed, but I love to give, I really do. It gives me a whole different type, but equally as powerful, pleasure as an orgasm does. And if you’ll let me…id really love to start helping you overcome your fear of being touched like this.” John said, placing another kiss on Sherlocks mouth. Sherlock looked deep into Johns’ eyes for a moment and smiled, “I think I’d really like that.”
Sherlock’s hands were sweating, something they hadn’t done since the night he told Victor he was leaving for good. He saw Lestrade sitting at his desk and the familiar figure with strawberry blonde hair that was crouched over filling out what looked to be a personal information packet. Lestrade took notice of his presence, “ah, glad you made it.” Lestrade announced and Victor turned around to see who was at the door. Immediately Sherlock began trying to deduce him- he obviously worked a day job, probably something political going by his suit and haircut, as well and the fading tan lines on his wrists. When Sherlock finally let his eyes meet Victor’s, he was surprised to see that Victor seemed to be searching to find where he knew him from. This, in many different ways, made Sherlock upset. All the pain and trauma that this man had inflicted on his life and he could barely recognize who Sherlock was. In a way, Sherlock wished it could stay like this, but he knew the second Lestrade introduced them it would all be over. After-all, how many people were named Sherlock Holmes? Sherlock internally answered his own question. One. there was only one Sherlock Holmes and it was him. Lestrade stood up from his chair and walked to stand closer to the two men. “Victor, this is Sherlock Holmes, the best detective in London and probably the world, he will be playing a substantial role in this case.” As soon as his name left Lestrade’s mouth Victor’s eyes lit up, his brows raised slightly, and the faintest trace of a smirk appeared on his lips. Victor stood from his chair and outstretched his hand to Sherlock. It took every fiber in his being not to flinch or step backwards toward John. “Hi, Victor Trevor. Nice to meet you, Sherlock.” Sherlock narrowed his eyes, ‘so this is how we are going to play the game’ he thought before shaking Victor’s hand, the first contact he had made with him in nearly ten years. Sherlock didn’t return the statement, only moved to the side and let John approach. “Sorry, Victor” Lestrade apologized, “I should have warned you, Sherlock’s not the best with conversation but the more you get to know him you, will learn to cherish the moments when he is actually quiet.” Lestrade laughed but no one else did. God bless blissfully unaware Lestrade. “oh, John you didn’t have to come we are just doing an interview and paperwork.” John directed his attention to the detective inspector, still trying to comprehend the scene that just played out before him, “uh, yeah, no that’s okay I have nothing better to do. I’ve got some time off work and thought this would be a good way to stay busy.” John lied. “Victor, this is Dr.John Watson, Sherlock’s-“ John interrupted “Colleague.” Lestrade shot him a quick confused look but dismissed it. “right, Dr.Watson this is Emily Trevor’s brother, Victor. He will be acting as one of our main witnesses throughout this investigation.” Victor reached out to shake John’s hand. John wanted so badly to smack it away and knock him out cold but he followed Sherlock’s lead and acted as if everything was fine. “I’m sorry about your sister.” John chose to say rather than ‘nice to meet you.’ At least he had some genuine sincerity behind his audible remark. Victor nodded and sat back down, finishing up the last few lines of information.
But him! For God‘s sake, did he loose any time? With real soldier-like vigor, he didn‘t wait a second and let me taste a pinch of what would await me behind his bedroom door if I accepted his invitation.
As soon as the lid closed behind it, I, fully clothed, reached for the bed and folded my arms behind my head. The only company I had was a little bit of dim flickering light emitted by a fading gas lamp behind the window, and a longing silence into which my room had plunged again. By this it finally joined the rest of the dusky London, peacefully dozing behind its windows.
If the amount of my religiousness was just somewhere near the ocean of cynicism that filled my soul, I would now have to berate the heaven. But with current state of affairs I had nothing but a bitter laughter.
A simple bedroom equipped with only a few cheap pieces of furniture, until recently desolate and empty, but now undoubtedly inhabited.
I gave up and touched exactly the place where it had been just few hours before. Suddenly it was so desperately insufficient, but what could I do? The pulsing heat under my palm must have resembled the one you felt back then. I unbuttoned myself.
It was late in the evening, though, according to common social conventions, a rather deep night when I finally put my precious violins (a commemoration of my French grandmother) in their safe hiding place in a sturdy leather case.
That was my pondering in the dead of the night, while my hand was imitating his gripp on my own manhood with unmistakable precision. My mouth let out a blissful sigh. I continued in my task.
The memory of that hot hand, which without hesitation and shamelessly made its way lower and lower, to my lap, pierced my head. Of  my own thighs, which opened for him, like a gate. Even of the gentle touch of his lips on my face.
The gentleman, who have recently started to call it his home, was initially nothing more for me than a cute nice amount of money, which will ensure that, despite my thin appanage and alms, I receive from the police and my colleagues in the bussiness, I could afford this maybe a modest but neat apartment in the city center. Which would otherwise be far beyond my financial means.
The heat that had ignited in my body became more and more unbearable. I unbuttoned my vest and dropped it, as if it were the thing that had taken my breath away. I narrowed my eyes and took a deep breath. The frantic beating of my heart did not subside.
It was the next week and Sherlock is scheduled to meet with his therapist for the first time. Thankfully it fell on one of the days John didn't have to go into the office and he could stay with him.
"Okay, I won't leave. Promise."  Sherlock said bringing up John's hand from the arm that was around him to kiss it.
John let out a deep breath and his head dropped back in exasperation, “Sherlock, you’ve put yourself through so much already. Why keep adding to it? You don’t owe Emily.”
John looked up at him, staring, it was like an unspoken reassurance that Sherlock really was ready. The doctor held his lover close and placed a hand on the side of Sherlock’s face, bringing him closer into a lingering kiss, “will you still be ready this evening?” it was obvious the question took Sherlock by surprised, “what? I assume I would, but why not now?” he asked impatiently in typical Sherlock form. “I want this to be special for you, sweetheart.” John said softly as he stroked the side of Sherlock’s face with his thumb. Sherlock opened his mouth to argue but John cut him off, “ I want our first time together to be special, not some quick roll around in the sheets.” John said gently with another kiss to the detective’s lips. “ and Sherlock…” John waited for the tall man to meet his gaze, John held him tight against him, “certainly not without letting me open you up with my fingers and tongue. You can’t just take me in your tight little hole without anything first, baby.” Sherlock blushed in embarrassment; in the heat of the moment he had forgotten all about preparing himself to be able to take in John’s considerable length. He softly nodded his head and adjusted his body so that their cocks lined up with one another. He wrapped his hand around the both of them and began to stroke them against each other. He and John both moaned, slipping back into their aroused states. They were both getting close to their climax. John’s breathing was getting faster and his toes were curling in pleasure, “sher…love, I’m close.” He panted and Sherlock hummed in response, kissing the doctor’s neck as he stroked them faster. Soon John was coming and it was dripping down Sherlock’s fingers onto his own stomach as Sherlock came with a loud moan, his come landing with John’s.
"Hello? Is Sherlock there? I need his help with something." John, forgetting his makeup and outfit, went to let Lestrade in.
“Provincetown - or P-Town - is a very openly gay-friendly town. I was thinking two of us pose as a couple and chat up some residents while the other one looks for clues.”
It didn’t take John very long to figure out what the paper was saying. Back right. He showed this to Greg, and they made their way to the back right corner of the lot.
“Sounds like a plan,” said John. The three set out for town, enjoying the cool evening air. As they turned onto the street where the restaurant was, however, Lestrade stopped.
“Who wants crisps?” Sherlock asked, paying mind to neither John nor Griswold. Evidently he had been at the snack bar. “Oh, and I bought chips for you.”
“Sherlock, what are you doing?” John turned around and waded back to where he was standing. Sherlock held his bucket out so John could peer inside. He had turned the inside of the bucket into a mini ecosystem, into which he had put rocks, shells, and pieces of seaweed, and it was hosting several hermit crabs. John let out a little gasp.
It was the first day of the new school year. Sherlock arrived and took his usual seat in the back. He was watching all the students come in and take their seats as well when a new kid walked in. He was stocky and athletically-built. He had short hair and clearly played football. He took the seat directly in front of Sherlock, who immediately straightened up and smiled automatically. The boy smiled back and sat down. Sherlock’s stomach flopped. A few seconds later, his smile faded and then he realized he didn’t mean to smile. Why would he do that? He never smiled at school. He suddenly became aware of his increased heart rate and clammy hands. He felt like he was perspiring more than usual. This was not normal. He’d have to consult his books, or possibly the library computer.
I suppose that could be seen as some sort of sexual abuse though, so I'm sorry for saying it. Sometimes alcohol makes me a bit fuzz when it comes to crossing a line. -JW
“Already talking about leaving.” John falls back on the bed and looks up at the deteriorating ceiling above. “I wish we could just stay here, suspended in this moment forever.”
“It’s nothing,” said Mycroft. “Do you want to try some of mine?” Sherlock nodded his head and took a lick of the scoop of coffee. He made a face.
“I’m so proud of you, Mikey. How about a biscuit to celebrate?” Mycroft followed Mummy into the kitchen, where a plate of biscuits fresh from the oven was waiting on the table. He eagerly took one and finished it in three bites.
“Oh, um, no worries,” said Sherlock, preoccupied with examining his ankle. It was bleeding profusely where the dog’s teeth had broken the skin. He should probably see a doctor.
“Out,” Sherlock answered. John sighed and picked up the curry menu. He ordered for the both of them in case Sherlock returned, though he didn’t count on it. After dinner, he decided to text him.
“Hello, Mr. Billings. How have you been?” he asked, not listening to his answer. Instead, his eyes roamed, searching for his dog. “Where’s Redbeard?” he asked after failing to find him.
“Murders? Oh no, no murders. Today’s my day off.” Sherlock squinted at the criminal mastermind, trying to discern if he was lying or not. Moriarty smiled vacantly.
Victor wasn’t always helping Sherlock, though. Sherlock did his fair share of aiding Victor, usually in asking out a girl. Just like with lab assistance, being Victor’s wingman was a learned skill, and it took some time before Sherlock could properly read the cues of the social scene enough to not scare away Victor’s potential dates.
This time it was John tensing at the mention of his name, “it was interesting. He doesn’t suspect anything that’s for sure. He asked me if we were a couple. I told him we were.”
Hours had passed and Sherlock and Billy were trying yet another set of tunnels. Sherlock glanced at his phone for what seemed like the 100th time. Of course, there was no cell service but every time he checked he tried to imagine what John must be doing and how he was feeling. It was nearly 4 PM and he knew Greg and Victor would be in the city by now, he only hoped all was going according to plan when suddenly the sound of a gunshot rang through the tunnels. He and Billy both dropped to the ground when he felt a sharp prick stab deep into his shoulder and he could no longer fight to keep his eyes open.
“Now that you have agreed that my statements are accurate you may plea your case.” She said into the small microphone as she picked up a pen to take notes. Sherlock watched her every move. She was known for being impeccable at her job but infamously known for being rude to the individuals on the stand, never allowing her emotions to come into play. In many ways Sherlock related heavily to her, but worried if her intimidating demeanor would shake up an already nervous Emily.
"Your therapist will come on Tuesdays and Thursdays. You WILL speak with her Sherlock. If you want to stay with John you will behave." Mycroft spat with a fake smile.
John makes his way to Sherlock and goes to wrap an arm around the taller man. He had barely made contact with Sherlocks torso when his lover’s talking stopped, and Sherlock retracted from John; the whole environment of their little flat had changed drastically in a split second. A look of concern washed over the good doctor’s face, “Sherlock?” he questioned, but before he could ask if he was alright the mood had changed again.
Just as Sherlock was about to begin his statement the judge spoke into the microphone, “Mr. Holmes, what is your relationship to the plaintiff, Emily Trevor?”
Sherlock had taken a seat on the sofa and Mycroft stood in front of him, leaning slightly on his umbrella. “Mycroft, can I get you anything?” John offered. “No, thank you. I won’t be staying long. Sherlock?” he said directing his attention back towards the sofa “I wanted to talk with you about a private matter….” Mycroft’s words trailed off. Sherlock’s rolled his eyes, “yes, I’ve gathered that. John can stay.” Sherlock said assertively, answering the unasked question. Mycroft sighed and John smiled sitting back in his chair. “I was made aware this morning that you are working on a case involving the Trevor family. And not only that, but that you are in direct correspondence with Victor. What the HELL are you thinking?!” Mycroft was seething. John had never seen him show such raw emotion. Sherlock flinched for a split second as Mycroft’s voice continued to rise. “it’s a case. I got involved before I knew the details. Besides, it’s not about him. I’m not doing this for him. I can’t back out now” Sherlock said his eyes burning into Mycroft’s. “oh, you can back out and you will. I will not allow this to continue. I have been trying to protect and provide you with resources since before you left him. Have you forgotten…!” Mycroft was practically shouting towards the end before Sherlock interrupted him standing up quickly from the sofa, “Of course I haven’t forgotten!” Sherlock screamed back at him, “but if you were listening, I’m not doing this for him, it’s for his sister! Why should she be punished for who he is!” Mycroft shook his head in disappointment, “Oh, Sherlock. Your sentiment disgusts me. I’m pulling you from the case.” “No, you’re not. I can do it with or without you but your knowing of the case would help ensure my protection.” Sherlock said with a convincing tone in his voice.
John nearly dropped the tray and jerked his head up to look at Sherlock and then at Mark, " Excuse me, I thought your job is to help him, not to criticize him."
“my bedroom? Why would you- never mind I don’t care. No. you need to leave. Now. I’m done with this; I’m done with you.” Sherlock stood and took Victor’s jacket that was draped over the doorknob and he threw it down the stairs. Victor threw his hands up in a teasing display of defeat and got up from John’s chair and stood in front of Sherlock, “I’ll see you around.”
I BEGAN THIS STORY 5 YEARS AGO (2015) and have recently picked it back up(2020). I would like to think my writing has grown significantly since then and would really like to encourage you to continue reading this story even if it seems subpar until chapter 16. Also, if you wish for me to go back and correct/ add more detail to previous chapters I am open to doing that. Thank you! Lots of love <3
A few more kisses and John’s warm hands rubbing his back, Sherlock fell asleep happy, sated, loved, and proud.
"I wouldn't be asking if I wasn't"Sherlock moved back the thin hospital blankets. John got out of the chair and climbed in next to Sherlock being cautious not to wrap his arms around him or touch him in anyway that would make him uncomfortable. He thought since the remembrance of victor was so strong right now that he shouldn't touch him.
For the past several minutes Sherlock had had a lump in his throat that he couldn’t quite swallow down, he cursed himself knowing that it was the same type of lump that had formed the night he sappily confessed how thankful he was for John- the sentiment type of lump. They were still stood in the downstairs, “John, I’ll come up in a minute.” Sherlock said out of the blue, his eyes not meeting John’s. The doctor had questions of course but decided those would be left for a different time. Instead he nodded and gave Sherlock’s arm a little squeeze and went upstairs.
“the Trevor case from a few days ago. I know you said you’re no longer interested in it but we really need the help. We’ve got absolutely no clue what has happened to this girl.”
Victor looked mildly taken aback and scoffed, “come on Sherlock, we had a good run. It doesn’t have to be over.”
Sherlock swallowed hard trying to put moisture back into his mouth and throat, “are you alright?” he choked out and Emily nodded. “someone’s got it out for me, for us. We need to start moving now.”
"It's okay, really, don't worry about me pressing you to do anything, you will never have to worry about that with me, tell me to stop and I will."
Emily chuffed out a laugh, “ever the dramatic… so do you want to know what happened or have you already figured it out?” she asked sincerely.
So...Surprise! I really didn't intend to upload a chapter until next week but i have felt so inspired by your alls sweet comments and reading my story! plus writing for you all is much more fun than writing my final papers haha. Please leave any feedback you feel inclined to! Stay safe and healthy, lots of love <3

John’s hands were clenching the white sheets beneath him, he was getting too close and wasn’t ready for this to be over. Just as he was about to beg Sherlock to give that sensitive spot a rest, the detective seemed to read his mind and move his efforts even lower. John watched as the dark curls sank lower between his strong thighs and gasped loudly as he felt Sherlock take one of his balls into his hot, velvety mouth. Sherlock had never done this before, and John had never experienced it until now. Sherlock looked up at him through those beautiful dark lashes and John let out a throaty groan. John cupped his hand under Sherlock’s jaw and brought him up for a passionate kiss. Sherlock kissed his way down John’s toned body, letting his tongue trace over some of the more defined muscles and suck gently on his nipples for just a moment.
Hi everyone! i hope you are doing well! Im so sorry for the two week hiatus, finals ended last week (YAY!!) but unfortunately i've had terrible writers block. i cant even tell you how many times i've sat down to write a chapter and felt like it was going no where. so today i forced myself to write this and it really helped. so this chapter may not be my best but it was definitely what i needed to get me back in the groove of things, i may even be in the mood to write and post another one tonight. I really do hope you enjoy it anyway! I hope you all are staying safe and healthy, lots of love <3
“I guess it’s my turn now.” John said with a sigh. “what do you mean?” Sherlock questioned and John took one of his hands in his own. “things didn’t exactly go fine at the yard. Yes, he made some comments and asked personal questions, but he hit a nerve with me, and I snapped. I didn’t hit him or really hurt him- just threatened him a bit. He threatened me back with ‘emotional leverage’ about you, but I just thought you should know.” John said with his head hung a bit low in shame.
“ right. On his phone, there was a message from Victor, offering a large sum of money to separate Sherlock from somebody- we don’t know whether that was in reference to Miss Trevor or Mr. Wiggins. the text occurred while Sherlock was in the tunnels, these messages were not on Victor’s phone but there was an unread reply from this man to Victor that said something to the effect of, ‘ subtract $200 from that if I can use him the way I used to.’ It didn’t mean much when we read it at the time…obviously it does now.” Greg continued to fill in missing details of what happened while in Paris until he had exhausted everything he had to say. The judge called for a recess wile they waited on the paperwork. For the first time in days Greg was able to talk with his two friends, but the DI had very few words to say. Instead he wrapped his arms around the detective and mumbled apologies. Sherlock tentatively hugged him back with an awkward pat on the back. John shook Lestrade’s hand, waiting for Sherlock to walk away before smiling at the DI, “your drinks at the pub are on me from now on.” The two laughed quietly before exiting the room. John entered the restroom, a scowled when he saw Victor and his accompanying security guard at one of the urinals. He stepped back out to wait for the other man to leave. Sherlock spotted him and invaded his personal space, but John didn’t mind.
Hi my lovely readers! i want thank you all so much for the comments and reads in the past week, i hope you are enjoying this story as it wraps up! Here is part one of the trial, i hope it keeps your interest and doesn't feel repetitive. DISCLAIMER: i'm not a lawyer, ive never been to law school, and i don't watch many crime shows so i had to take an educated guess at how a court scene would play out, so please be gentle with me haha. Stay healthy, lots of love...xx
John couldn't help but laugh and that caught the eye of both Amy and Sherlock. "Sorry to interrupt, I brought you up some coffee love."
As if the past 24 hours hadn’t put Sherlock through the emotional ringer enough, he felt a pit of arousal open up low in his stomach. He tried to push it to the back of his mind like he normally did, but much like his moment of sentiment, it persisted. Sherlock sat up before throwing a leg over John, taking the blogger by surprise as Sherlock bent down and began kissing along the side of his neck. John laughed softly, “what are you doing?” Sherlock didn’t reply only continued to kiss lower and lower on John’s’ body until he found himself palming John’s growing erection through his boxers. “John, can I give you a blowjob?” Sherlock looked looking up at John in a way that can only be described as sinful. John took a sharp breath, “ah, Sherlock I mean, I’d love one and my god is it hard to turn you down while you’re looking at me like that but it’s almost 3 in the morning and you should get some sleep.” Sherlock hesitated not knowing how to express what was happening to John, “I need it.” John raised an eyebrow, “You need to blow me?” John asked and Sherlock shook his head, “no, yes, I don’t know, I need something John, I’m um….aroused.”
I've got a lot happening in my life right now, but I love and care about you all and this story. I am taking ONE MONTH off and then will return hopefully better than ever to finish this sorry in the way it deserves. I hope you can understand and will be here when I return.
