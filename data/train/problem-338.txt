John gave him a long, assessing look, scanning his eyes for some sign that he wasn’t telling the truth. “We're definitely not going to be here for New Year's Eve, okay? We're definitely going to be in Chicago for that.”
“That’s long enough. Now tell me,” she said, clasping her hands together, “what are the two of you getting up to tonight?”
Angelina sits on a stool near the front door, small and spry, with an enormous bun piled high on her head, wearing half her weight in necklaces and bracelets. From there she manages reservations and walk-ins from a tall podium overflowing with invoices, menus, an ancient cordless phone, and a stack of unopened mail.
John was quiet. Too quiet. Sherlock let his drifting hand come to rest on John’s bicep, and closed his eyes. He shouldn’t have asked.
“Look at how he was hitting on John. Did we tell you he’d sent John a note last night, at the restaurant?”
“John, I could probably come right now just from you looking at my cock.” He pulled his knees back and watched John’s chest rising and falling, took in the complete mess of his hair, his flushed cheeks. His pubic hair was damp from their precome, and his legs were shaking. He was radiating heat, and was slick with sweat, and Sherlock could smell the tang of his armpits and the musk of his groin.
“I’m changing the rules tonight, John. These have served their purpose. They were a very considerate gift when you knew I was unsure about being touched, when I didn’t know what I was doing or how I’d respond. You were patient with me. But we’ve moved past that now. If I don’t want something, if I’m not in the mood, I can tell you and know that it’ll be okay. And you do the same with me.
“So, anyway, I couldn’t catch up, and you must’ve realized it because you turned around to see where I was, and that slowed you down enough that I slammed right into you. I could’ve stopped, I could’ve avoided you, but I was mad and I didn’t want to. I wanted to take you down. I slammed right into you and we both fell, hard, and there I was, sprawled on top of you, and I must’ve knocked the wind right out of you because your eyes went all wide and you looked like you were choking, and I thought maybe you’d hit your head really hard or something. So then I wasn’t mad anymore, I was worried, and then I wasn’t even worried because all of a sudden I realized that I was lying right on top of you, like, fully on top of you, breathing hard, just staring at your mouth, and you weren’t moving, you weren’t joking or trying to push me off.”
“Poor Mummy, no traditional fruitcake for her son’s overly traditional wedding. Nope. I wanted chocolate mousse and buttercream and that’s what we got. Don’t drop it!” Sherlock held a hand out to steady John and John hummed and licked the chocolate off one thumb before taking the cake in both hands again. “Besides, if I hadn’t taken it she would’ve had it wrapped up and frozen for our one-year anniversary, and there’s no way I’m eating frozen, freezer-burned wedding cake one year from now.”
“The hell it isn’t.” Sherlock tossed the pillow aside, stood up, and backed his way toward the bathroom. “Do you know who has a key to my flat in London, John? No one. No one has a key to my home.” When he hit the bathroom door he reached out blindly for the doorknob.
“It’s not called anything, yet, but this whole area is the site of a new housing development. My dad’s the contractor, and they break ground next week. Right now, it’s just dirt roads … and … this.”
“Shut up. I will take no action here tonight unless I very clearly hear Laffitte offer John money in exchange for sex. Are we clear?”
“Sherlock,” John says, brushing his wing down the length of his mate’s, “we may need to reconsider the options.”
“You can discuss it privately, if you’d like,” Sherlock offers, hoping to atone for some of his past impulsive decision making.
The most common test for testing wood hardness is known as the Janka hardness test. The actual number listed in the wood profile is the amount of pounds-force (lb
He didn’t find out that night, but he did learn that slow and sleepy sex with John in the middle of the night took him to another world, to a place in which he moved under water, but could still feel the full weight of John’s adoration on him; one in which John made small, breathy sounds that sounded exactly like whispered love poems. In this dark and quiet place, cocooned under blankets and lingering dreams, they clung to each other, eyes closed, mouths brushing, right through the very end, and then they stayed right where they were, and fell back asleep.
Sherlock sat back in his chair and steepled his fingers under his chin. He walked himself through the information he’d been given.
Sherlock didn’t want to wait to hear John espouse all of James’ finer qualities. “Let me look into this a little more, if you don’t mind. I’d like to talk with your staff and your security detail, and look at the video footage that’s available from just before and after the missing segment. It might take a day or two.”
“Should I open it now?” Sherlock took the envelope from Mycroft and ran his fingernail along the sealed flap.
“You still have me, Sherlock,” John whispers into his neck. “You’ll be in my every thought, and I’ll be in yours. And I will wait for you, at home. I will watch for you every single day, do you understand? I will watch, and wait, until you come home to me.”
He didn’t find out that night, but he did learn that slow and sleepy sex with John in the middle of the night took him to another world, to a place in which he moved under water, but could still feel the full weight of John’s adoration on him; one in which John made small, breathy sounds that sounded exactly like whispered love poems. In this dark and quiet place, cocooned under blankets and lingering dreams, they clung to each other, eyes closed, mouths brushing, right through the very end, and then they stayed right where they were, and fell back asleep.
He wants to deny that he needs anything from these so-called friends of John's, but once again he can hear John in his head, saying,
John guided him down onto his side, away from the mess on the bed, and curled his body around Sherlock. He pulled up the sheets and wrapped his arm around Sherlock’s arm and chest, tucking them in, holding them together.
Sherlock untied his stained apron and tossed it over his lab stool, then gave his hands a cursory scrub and wiped them on his trousers. He threw on his wrinkled linen blazer and patted down the lapels. Into battle, then.
They are about to round the curve that will lead them back to the path that leads to the cave, when the wind carries a hiss of conversation to their ears. Sherlock drags his feet to stop himself, and John plants his face into Sherlock’s tail feathers.
He moved then, he wrapped his limbs around John, pressed his wet face into John’s warm neck, and shook.
It took about half-a-second for John to catch on, and then another half-a-second to land on top of Sherlock, put the instrument to the side, and press his mouth to Sherlock’s clarinet-swollen lips. Who cared if the herons got a free show? He was going to impress the pants right off Sherlock Holmes. John played Sherlock’s instrument like his life depended on it, and Sherlock was so impressed by the performance that he wept. In fact, John got more range of sound and pitch from Sherlock than he’d ever done on the clarinet, and afterward, Sherlock declared John a master musician.
Sherlock tosses the shirt onto the floor, then discards his own clothes, and comes to stand in the vee of John's legs. He leans down over him, placing his hands on either side of John's shoulders, and shakes his head.
Sherlock looks down at himself, and sees the pink light bouncing off his own chest and belly, hips and legs. “John,” he says. “Look.” John doesn’t look up right away. He looks at the stone and at the points of light flowing into it, through it. Then John looks up at Sherlock, and Sherlock sees John’s eyes roaming over his body before they settle on his face. John’s bill is glowing bright, his usual lavender even more intense in the stone’s reflective brilliance.
“I would estimate the odds are in the vicinity of one in ten billion. The odds of it being a coincidence, however, are much lower.”
John had used way too much liquid soap to make bubbles, and Sherlock complained that he could only see John’s face over the heaps of white.
“Shit. My mom. What time is it?” John sat up, swung his legs over the side of the bed, and grabbed his phone.
John leaned over and kissed him, and Sherlock stayed there, in that moment, only somewhat aware of what John’s hands were doing with the slick until he felt John take him in one hand, guide him up and back, and press him exactly where he wanted him.
Sherlock considers, then says, “I’ll keep it in my mouth the whole time. Can you catch something for me? I’ll transfer it back to my wing in order to eat. Or, we could take turns in the water. I’ll hold it while you swim, then you hold it while I swim.”
Sherlock sniffs at the interruption, but gives John a slight nod, and then reaches into his suit jacket pocket. He keeps the item hidden in his fist and says, “Molly helped me.”
Sherlock thought about the conversation he and James had had over breakfast a year ago, about his strong hunch that James had regretted ending things with John before John had been invalided out. “He has probably erred on the side of caution and given you plenty of time and space, as your ex, because of your marriage to me. Keep in mind he still harbors guilt for showing up here when he did.”
Sherlock lifted his arms and John yanked the shirt up and over his head, then tossed it in the direction of the dirty clothes pile. Sherlock toed his boots off, undid the buttons of his jeans, and stepped out of them. He shivered. “I really am freezing. Even my balls are freezing.” He cupped himself with both hands and shimmied closer to John.
John turned away from the counter and picked up a curvy glass contraption, poured Sherlock’s coffee into a large black and white to-go cup, snapped a lid on top, and turned back to hand it to him. “This is French press, I think you’ll like it. I put the sugar in already. That’ll be £2.95.”
Sherlock sighs and slides the tip of his wings down John’s sides. John is plump and sleek from his time hunting. Irresistible. "She can’t survive on rock skipping and secret signals, Johnling. Of course, she needs us."
Sherlock kept his mouth and tongue loose and easy on John, working only the head as he lowered his hand to fondle John’s balls. John gave the slightest roll of his hips and Sherlock squeezed in acknowledgement, brought his hand back up to the base of John’s cock, and angled it toward his mouth. He tightened the circle of his lips around John’s shaft and then slowly lowered his head, sliding John’s erection over the flat bed of his tongue. He stopped halfway, gauging the heft and weight of John’s erect penis, then slowly bobbed up and down to get a sense of the space it took up in his mouth. His lips were stretched wider than he’d anticipated, and his mouth felt much fuller than he’d imagined. The action of taking in John’s cock rendered his mouth incapable of doing anything else at the moment, and the thought sent a shudder through him. No talking, no explaining, no thoughtless, unprepared words.
Kevin took a step back, clapped his hands once, rubbed them together, and said, “Well, then. It’s been a long night, hasn’t it? We’ll just leave the two of you to settle in, shall we? Help yourself to anything in the kitchen, you know where the guest bathroom is, and let’s all sleep in tomorrow, okay?” He’d been walking backwards as he talked, and was now at the head of the hallway.
He made it upstairs and into James’ room without seeing Annette. The folders were exactly where he’d left them. He tucked them under his arm and moved back to the door, stepping lightly, as if his footprints would mark the floor and give him away as an intruder. He paused on the threshold and looked back before he left. The room appeared as it always did, except for James’ duffel bag which sat on an armchair near one of the windows. The bed was perfectly made. There wasn’t a book or comb or pair of shoes to be seen. The curtains were open and the bathroom door was closed.
“When he found out I was from Pobeda, he talked about a social revolution, and it caught me very much off-guard. I had never thought of what you and Selvic went through as the start of a social revolution, but it was, wasn't it? And he knew as much about it as anyone, maybe even more, because Selvic was there. Selvic was with the Anahi, and they came to know everything, didn’t they? About you and Selvic?”
Sherlock was ready to rip the infuriating scrap off himself when he heard John say, “Do something for me, love?”
When John took possession of Sherlock’s arse, he did so fully, the way one might wrap their mouth around a ripe summer peach, the way one kisses a lover when they intend to never, ever let go. With an open mouth and broad tongue, John kissed and sucked his way from the lush curve of one buttock to the crease in between. Hands on Sherlock’s hips, he buried his face in that lavish bounty, found the very centre of Sherlock, and flicked.
Sherlock started the internal process of bursting into flames. He figured the dynamic would be complete, resulting in spontaneous combustion, when John’s possessive hand finished its journey up Sherlock’s inner thigh and came to a stop over his crotch, which was about to happen in three-two-one seconds. He stared at his silverware and begged the cocktail gods for salvation.
Sherlock paces back and forth in front of John, who stands near the shore, flinging ice chips into the water. Wingtips pressed under his bill, Sherlock paces, and he ruminates.
Sherlock sniffed, then nodded. When he spoke he sounded congested, and later he'd wonder if that's why the words got so stuck. “I did. I loved it, and I … I … you're everything to me, John. You mean everything to me.”
“Probably. I’m not sure if Harry told him about the fight mom and I had, or if he heard any of it. So, I gave him the rundown, and asked him if he felt the same way, that you and I being together must be the result of something awful in my childhood, or was a phase that I’d ‘get over.’
“That, or perhaps the sheer relief of being able to participate in the ritual for which we had strived.”
Sherlock highly doubts this, given how hard he has worked to manage both his thoughts and his body, but he doesn’t interrupt. Instead, he directs his frustration into his furrowed brow.
Sherlock knows Erebus refers to her lack of colour, and perhaps the mysticism associated with this anomaly, but all he can think to say is, “Yes. She’s extraordinary, and very brave, and very kind. She is my friend.”
“I will, John. As fast as I can. I will be single-minded in my efforts to arrive there as quickly as possible, impart the necessary information, and return home.”
“Have you decided when you’re going?” Mr. Watson was looking at John, but John was still staring dazedly out the kitchen window, so Mr. Watson turned to Sherlock, instead.
“Extra shots and three pumps of vanilla,” John finished for her, sighing fondly. “I don’t know why I ask, you never change your order.”
“You underestimate yourself, love. Besides, most of what I went through I went through with you, yeah?”
Sherlock makes a vow and stores it as deep in his heart as the sea he swims; his and John’s hatchling will know from where she came, and in doing so, Erebus will always be known as a mate and a mentor, a friend and a father, a legend and legacy.
Sherlock shakes his head. “No. I do not wish to remain on the Shelf any longer than necessary. I wish to conduct my business and return home, soon.”
Sherlock had been nibbling along John’s jawline as he spoke, but he stopped at that last word and rubbed his nose against John’s. “I wouldn’t say I’m incorruptible. I’d say you’ve corrupted me completely.”
Instead of turning he adjusts his stance and the arc of his foot, sends the stone flying, and grins as he adds two jumps to his record. He looks at Sherlock then and says, "How'd you know that?"
Sherlock stood in Aisle 2 of Peck’s Feed and Grain and listened to Mr. Watson and an employee named Hank discuss the consumer’s ever-increasing interest in organic chickens and higher levels of Omega-3’s. John stood a few feet away inspecting a bag of what was purported to be the best grower pullet on the market. Neither subject matter interested Sherlock, so he stared at John’s ass and let his mind wander.
When John’s dad arrived, he found both Sherlock and John outside, dressed in multiple layers, armed with shovels, clearing the front walk and steps, and the path that led from house to garage. They gave him a wave and got back to work, removing heaps of snow from places Mr. Watson’s plow wouldn’t reach.
on it. It was then I allowed myself to consider that it might be true. All of it. And I have considered. I carried the tooth for a long time. It was hard to think about anything but that tooth, and John, of course. Even now, having left it behind, I still think about it, because I think if you are so consumed by something, your thoughts continue to carry it, even when you do not.
Sherlock looks at Watson suspiciously, as if trying to parse innuendo from intent. He looks at Greg, who shrugs, and back to Watson.
“Annette?” John answered. “No, she left shortly before you arrived. Hasn’t she already been interviewed?”
Sherlock knew better than to try to reassure her now. Out of the corner of his eye he saw John sitting still as stone, staring at his mom.
John smiled. He wove one hand into the curls at the nape of Sherlock’s neck and cupped his cheek with his other hand. “I’m glad to hear that. Very glad.”
John had made a toast, hash brown, egg, and bacon sandwich, and took a big bite before leaning into Sherlock's space to get a better look.
“Not just yet.” John rubbed two fingers over Sherlock, then slowly, so slowly, pushed them both in. Sherlock bit his lower lip and breathed out. John’s fingers sank deeper.
“I will be there for John, Sherlock, while you are away,” Erebus whispers into his ear. He gives him one last squeeze before stepping away.
You should all know that ever since I wrote the first draft of this chapter, the two of us have been calling it "the anal winging chapter."
It all became frighteningly clear. The tenuous understanding Sherlock had had of the tension between them, that fizzle of electricity that existed long after a case was over, the glances and touches that could have meant more than friendship if only Sherlock had ever bothered to really understand the parameters of different kinds of relationships: they were together, but not as together as they should be.
“You know I’m going to take good care of it, right? The best of care. And I won’t lose it. I’ll protect it with my life. I’ll deliver it right to the High Council and I’ll –”
Sherlock hid his smile by planting another kiss on John's temple, and slowly led him to their bedroom. John didn't let go as Sherlock pulled the duvet back, but let himself be turned and settled back into the pillows. Sherlock untied John's shoes, dropped them onto the floor, and slipped his feet out of his socks.
“That tomorrow we’re going to check out the rooftops with a sightline to Caffe Scozia’s front windows.”
They were quiet then, smiling at each other, holding tight, lost in thought. Sherlock was going to suggest John have a bit of toast and juice, when John said, "I’ve certainly had meals that concluded better than this one."
“His life is in danger, Sherlock. That’s why he came here. I told you about the mess he’s been in ever since the incident with the recruits. Today he found a note inside his house, a death threat. He didn’t know where else to go.”
Sherlock glanced at John and took note of the expression on his face. Dismayed, sad, angry. “And you haven’t seen him since he came back?”
Their apartment’s tiny bathroom was filled with steam when he turned off the shower and reached for the towel he’d draped over the radiator before getting in. He scrubbed it through his hair and over the mirror before wrapping it around his hips and pulling it tight across his waist. He listened again for signs that John was back. Nothing.
“What are you grinning at, all by yourself in bed?” John crawled in next to him and threw himself back onto the pillows. “Come here and show me.”
"Hmm. No more games, then? Maybe just one. Hide and seek. Count to five, then find me." He inhales through his nose, sinks back into the water, keeping his eyes on John's until he's under.
Sherlock woke first, to a dark house and the odd sensation that it could’ve been the middle of the night, or the next morning, and maybe he was late for the school bus, and where was everyone, anyway? John in his arms made everything clear again, and he smiled, and stretched, warm and relaxed under the blankets.
“What’s your regular?” John asked, and Sherlock, grateful for the opportunity to redirect his thoughts from the ways John might look after him, smiled and said, “Tortellini alla Panna. As far as I can tell, it’s all butter, cream, cheese, peas, and prosciutto. And the tortellini, of course.”
John rubbed Sherlock’s knee and kissed his shoulder. “You should bring them up to the farm this summer, Mycroft. Mrs. Hudson would go into fits, she’d be so happy.”
Sherlock didn’t notice the silence until it ended. “Babe?” he heard Hank say from behind them. “That some kind of joke?”
He listened for the slam of the truck door and the progress of boots approaching the porch, then shivered and pulled the afghan tighter around him when John and a draft of cold air swept into the house.
And now, Sherlock was going to make love to John, and although, yes, he was horny as hell and near desperate to experience John this way, he was also aware that this could prove to be an intensely emotional experience. And so, Sherlock thought, when he made love to John later that night, if something went wrong, if John didn’t like it, if John didn’t love it, it would be okay, because Sherlock already knew that John trusted and valued him as his partner and equal, regardless of who did what.
“Please what, tiger?” Sherlock circled until his finger dipped into that precious furled place. He pushed in and rubbed.
“Language! That cute little Sarah Sawyer, the new elementary school nurse. Red hair? Adorable freckles.”
holding John’s hand, stroking his arm, squeezing his thigh, made Sherlock want to projectile vomit the plate of mussels he’d just eaten.
“If our feelings are natural, and our actions were not inappropriate, deductive reasoning leads me to conclude that Moringa took offense only in that we are both males. Why would that be wrong?”
Sherlock grinned and bit his lip. He was not going to laugh. This was a serious matter, this discussion of his body and John’s flattery of it, and he was not going to lighten the serious mood by agreeing to measure his penis. “No. Well, yes, I’m sure I do, but I’m not going to measure my penis.”
They gathered up their empty cups and used napkins and dumped everything in the trash on their way out. Zipping up coats and wrapping scarves, they said their goodbyes and promised to keep in touch.
Tongue still flat, saliva dripping down John’s balls, Sherlock shook his head back and forth, nodded it up and down, being sure not to lose contact with John. He slowed, then stopped, just pressing, not moving, and then John began to slide back and forth on Sherlock’s tongue. He nudged his hips, just little jerks up and down, feeding Sherlock his ass. John’s breathing was growing louder, deeper, punctuated by strings of
Sherlock tilts his mouth up for a kiss, stopping just short to whisper, “Do you have any idea how filthy that sounds, John?”
The next day brought sunshine, a delicious round of sleepy frotting, a lazy breakfast of coffee and toast, and Annette. Sherlock pulled his robe tighter around him when he heard the front door open, then looked over at John, perched on a chair at the kitchen table, hair in complete disarray, buttery crumbs on his fingertips. Debauched but presentable.
“I'm not surprised, to be honest with you. Still waters, and all that. What did your mom say when you left? Had she calmed down at all?”
Sherlock was pretty sure there wasn’t enough blood left in the upper half of his body to facilitate the workings of his vocal cords. It didn’t help that John was now nibbling on his frenulum. “Y – yes, John, I do believe – I can be of assistance – when it comes to – your daily need for – sucking cock. Oh – my – God – yes.”
John was standing near the table with a plate loaded high with food. He was nodding animatedly at Rudy’s boyfriend, Scott, while waving an egg roll around in front of him.
John rolled over on top of Sherlock, who grunted, then rolled back with a handful of tissues. He tossed half of them in Sherlock's face before reaching down to wipe at his own belly and thighs. “Do I need to clean you up, too, or would you prefer to wake up with those hotel sheets glued to your dick?”
Sherlock disentangled himself from John and stood up. He put his coat back on and dug in his pockets for the hat he pulled over his ears and the scarf he knotted around his neck, then went to the bar to settle their tab. Wine paid for, tip left on the table, they held hands and walked out into the city-turned-snowglobe. The walk to The Willows was quiet, both of them having said enough to last a while.
Sherlock looked, then bounced up from the sofa and shouted. He started pacing the living room, cursing himself for not having seen this as a possible outcome. How could it be, though? It was never twins and it was never a tie! He didn't realize he was tugging at his hair and muttering under his breath until he felt John's hand on his arm and heard him say, “Hey, shhh, it's all right. Sherlock, I didn't know this was so important to you.”
Sherlock spent the majority of his time at the Shedd at the penguin exhibit, and managed to take a dozen photos of John’s face, instead of his ass, as he peered in at the Magellanics and rockhopper penguins.
“Bloody genius … incredible … cannot believe … so amazing … how did you know … fantastic … tell me everything …”
Something is coiling tight inside Sherlock, gathering him up, making him ache. It takes everything he’s got to lift his head from the wall of snow, and meet John’s kisses with his own. They stand there, necking, bills to cheeks and throats and shoulders, bill to bill.
“Alright, then, John. I’ve got your name and number and will call if we have more questions. Thanks for your cooperation, yeah?”
Sherlock throws himself to the ice and kicks forward, feet scrabbling against the slippery surface. He already knows he cannot get there in time. He opens his bill to sound the bird-of-prey-alarm – all chicks must immediately be accounted for – but what comes out is not the call, but, “
“John, Molling, Stamfjord, come closer, now that you’re here.” Cetus makes room for his apprentices near Moringa’s side. “I want you to watch how I bind her ankle with this
“I was going to say ‘here’s to a great date ahead of us, and wherever it may lead,’ but it seems you have something else on your mind.” John sipped his Scotch and made an appreciative noise that went straight to Sherlock’s gut.
James took some more chicken and then poured himself more wine. “I do trust him. Perhaps it’s misplaced but I cannot imagine he’d be a part of something like this.”
She turns to make sure that Mycroft is following, then slips her wing under Sherlock’s. “Many think that I am
He opens his bill to speak, but Mycroft has beat him to it. Next to him, standing tall, alert, his brother enumerates.
Sherlock had read Mary's note, then silently handed it back to John, and gone out to the bees. Now, John puts the small handwritten card back in the pile of papers on his lap and looks over at Sherlock, leaning back in his chair, intently reading the manuscript. His posture is casual, but the horizontal lines across the bridge of his nose speak to his focus on John's telling of their story.
The four junior pengs greet Erebus. How the other three manage to sleep on is beyond Sherlock, but he’s grateful for their continued slumber and silence.
“Really.” Sherlock hoped John wouldn’t ask to see those equations, as they were mostly doodles of what Sherlock imagined John’s penis looked like.
“I can see that. It’s quite touching. I’ll be off, then. I told Cetus I’d help him check on those who have not yet laid their eggs. I know you’re all anxious to leave on the hunt. Which one of you will go?”
John reached out and cupped the back of Sherlock’s neck with his hand. He brought their foreheads together and held him close. “Sherlock, you lovely, amazing man. If that’s what you truly want…”
“Yeah, remember? I got you something, too, something that you might want to use tonight and going forward.”
Watson ran his fingers through his hair and licked his lips. “Yeah, sometimes. Not tonight, though. So, meet me in the locker room?”
“All that said, I’d love to go on dates with you, because we skipped over that part. I’d love to take you out to dinner, and wine and dine you, and then take you home and kiss you and undress you and do all sorts of things to you. We’ve never had that, the dating part of it. Does all of this make sense?”
“I know you are. I’ll let you know if things change but for now, I do think it’s best that you stay here, where we can keep an eye on you.”
Mrs. Hudson turned right onto CR-18 and barreled along for the last mile, then turned left into the driveway, only just missing the mailbox on its thick wood post. She parked her Buick sedan next to the family station wagon, turned the ignition off, and tossed the keys into a purse bigger than herself.
“Take a moment to think about how you want this to go. Do you want to strip down in front of me? Do you want me to undress you? Or do you want to do what we were about to do the night we were interrupted?”
Sherlock turns to smile at John, because yes, that is something wonderful to look forward to, a homecoming he has thought about many times in their advancing years. He turns to smile at John, but John is gone, and now he is facing Anahera.
The Woolly Mammoth is a real place, and everything listed in this chapter can be found in the photo pages of their
“I have nothing to do with how I look, though.” Sherlock shifted from foot to foot and resisted the urge to cover his genitals with his hands.
John sits on the edge of their bed and pulls off his jumper, then undoes the buttons on his jeans, lying back and tilting his hips up to push them down and around his thighs. He stays like that, feet on the floor, staring up at the white-washed, beamed ceiling, then feels Sherlock tugging his jeans over his feet and peeling off his socks.
Annette intervened, suggesting that she pose as a housekeeper at the hotel and do the reconnaissance herself. John raised hell over the suggestion, refusing to put Annette in any danger, but she asserted that she was an adult and would do what she pleased, and if she just happened to borrow a cousin’s hotel housekeeping uniform and find herself in Daniel’s room, who was he to stop her?
John nudged Sherlock’s foot under the table, and spell broken, Sherlock jumped up and insisted that they take care of cleaning the kitchen. “You go in and watch your show, Mrs. Hudson. We’ll take care of all this. Isn’t
“John,” Sherlock said. “I cannot arrange dates that involve canoes and clarinets. I cannot remember to eat, so I can hardly feed you. I cannot remember to say please and thank you and you’re welcome, and for these, and many other reasons, I cannot for the life of me figure out what you see in me. I meant what I said. You surprise me every day with your humanity and your loyalty. I would be a broken man without you.”
entails. First, doing anything in public that could be misconstrued as adultish, adultish meaning sexual. Second, doing anything that anyone could justifiably discipline them for. Third, any attention whatsoever from Moringa.
“Oh, but I really think I do,” John answered, and then Sherlock understood. His legs were bare, and if John’s legs were bare, too, their legs would be bare
Erebus stands silent for a long moment. When he speaks again, his eyes are bright, and his voice is low. “Yes. Yes, very much so. When we were reunited. When we saw each other for the first time after those six long winters apart. Have I told you about our reunion, Sherlock?”
Sherlock put the tray down but didn’t sit. “What would you like to drink? We’ve got beer, and wine, red and white. And a bottle of rosé that looks like it’s seen better days.”
“Nooo,” Sherlock drawled, slamming his palm down on the counter. A dozen glass slides jumped and skittered across the surface of his samples tray. “I’ve been made to understand that having such a soirée is de rigueur. Ending a successful career, however, boggles the mind.”
“‘I wanted to show Dorothy the changes I've made in the master bedroom. As soon as we walked past your bedroom she turned real strange and said she forgot something and needed to go. Well, I knew what that was all about, and I wasn't having any of it, not after how hard I've been working.’
John flipped to his back and crossed his arms under his head. He was quiet for a moment but then said, “It seems to me like it’s actually a good thing to lose yourself when you kiss. It means it’s a really good kiss. And it’s not like you can get in trouble, right? You’re here with me, alone, in a room in a house with no one else around. Maybe you should let yourself go a little bit more.”
“Of course.” John stretches tall and retracts his pouch, a sentry granting access to something sacred.
Vela smiles. “That’s not possible, my dear. By design of nature, your call will most likely not even be heard by an individual who is not well-suited for you. Pairing only happens when two songs are perfectly harmonious. Yours will resonate with theirs, and theirs will resonate with yours, or it won’t happen at all.”
“It is time for each and every one of us to decide for ourselves what is right. What do you, and you, and you, and you, believe? Is this the heartstone? And what if it is? I invite each and every one of you to come stand before it today, here and now, and make up your own mind.
When they got home John disappeared into the new office to call the clinic and see if there was anything that required his attention. He’d been slow to find a way to ease into Sherlock’s wedding present of a doctor’s practice and the building it was housed in, but after discussing some ideas with Sherlock and friends from both the military and his medical training, he’d decided to shift the more traditional practice of treating head colds and injecting vaccines into one focused primarily on the healthcare needs of wartime veterans and victims of violence.
Sherlock reached in between them and started undoing his own jeans, the back of his hand bumping against John as he worked the buttons. John licked into his mouth again, and rolled his hips, trapping Sherlock’s hand between them. Sherlock turned it over, and there it was, John’s erection, pressing into his palm, filling it, throbbing against it.
Nikau shrugs. “You must give up your own colony to serve on the High Council, so then you aren't different anymore, are you?
Sherlock licked his lips, and pressed them to John's, letting the kiss turn open and wet from the start. He tried to capture and memorize the various sensations of John: the taste of his mouth, the pressure of his tongue, and the soft warmth of his chest against Sherlock’s. He could feel John’s hands, one light and caressing on his face, the other strong and insistent on his lower back. There was the bump of John’s nose against his, and the sound of John breathing through that nose, and the barely there noise of the sheets shifting as they rolled their hips into each other. He felt a drop of wet being smeared over his lower belly, and the ever increasing pressure of John’s cock making itself known.
Sherlock reeled back against the wall as if John had punched him. “And in those years, John, were you also waiting for a shift in your own interests? Because God knows, you’ve dated most of the women in London. You even went as far as to marry one of them, for Christ’s sake.”
Vela points to a young female in the middle of the pack, and her high, light voice drifts to the front. “What if we don’t like the one who responds to our call?”
Sherlock stretched, and buried his face in John’s armpit. “Mm. Text him. Ask him. I want to know how it went with Kevin, at the very least.”
“What? No, not all. I'm not exactly a believer these days, but even, I don’t know, just as a study of history, the bible can be kind of interesting.”
“Yeah, I see your point. But why would anyone go through all that trouble to leave a note? Why not wait until James was home, sneak in, and finish the job?”
Sherlock shrugged. “Get it up? I guess you could prescreen and rule people out if you were really bothered by someone’s appearance, right?”
Sherlock turned onto his side again and pushed John down onto his back. He tugged the sheet down low on John’s hips but no further than that. Coming up on one elbow, he took a good, long look at John. He’d seen all of this before, his naked shoulders and the scar, his strong arms and pink-beige nipples. He had run his hand through the hair on John’s chest and tracked that darker line of hair just south of John’s belly button. He’d looked at all of that, but not like this, not when he knew what was about to happen, not when he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that John was about to use his body to make love to Sherlock. He took his time exploring John with his eyes and his fingers and his mouth. He licked at John’s nipples and registered the sigh of contentment John made. He sucked on them and felt the way John’s breath deepened.
Sherlock does not ask if his friends are nervous to meet his colony. Anahera, he knows, would delight in any new adventure, and will impress all of his fellow Pobedans. Tui, who was so reticent, so shy just one moon ago, has bloomed under the wide, peaceful sky. Watching her now, waddling tall and happy next to Anahera, Sherlock thinks to ask whatever inspired her to insist they accompany him on his trek.
John removed the metal rod that held the truck’s hood up, set it back into the grooves that stored it away, and let the hood slam down. He wiped his hands on a dirty rag, and started tossing tools back into the toolbox at his feet.
“And probably that armchair, and that other armchair, and that desk, and the shower, and that wall, too.” John kissed him again and Sherlock reluctantly pulled his hands out of John’s jeans.
Anahera hums her agreement, and takes his wing in hers. “As would you, Sherlock. You know that, right?”
“Could you ever have imagined this, when we were younger?” Sherlock asked. “All the times we'd seen each other naked, and it was no big deal, all the times we spent at each other's houses, all the sleepovers, did you ever think this might happen?”
Twenty minutes later Sherlock was panting over his shoulder at John, hands strangling his pillow. “I was wrong,” he grunted, “I was so wrong!”
Annette side-eyed him as she propped up a broom in the utility closet and closed the door behind her.
“For understanding that I need it to be just the two of us in this house when we finally take the next step.”
John ran his hand up and down the sleeve of Sherlock’s coat and pulled him back to the ticket machine. “Our stop is Western, right?”
“You are undoubtedly aware that the proposed committee must be led by a particular type of emperor. A peng in this position must be highly educated in emperor history, mythology, and law. The position requires familiarity with council protocol, committee dynamics, and intercolonial relations. Furthermore, this emperor must be impervious to subjective opinion, and not allow bias to influence their decision making.”
Forty-five minutes later, they were propped up in bed with a large Giordano’s deep dish pepperoni pizza between them, a bottle of Perrier on Sherlock’s nightstand, and a can of Coke on John’s. Paper napkins and little plastic containers of grated parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes were tucked into the open lid of the pizza box.
Was John seriously suggesting that Sherlock get in their shared bed and try to rest in anticipation of what they would be doing later that night? Did he not realise that he was more likely to self-combust in that bed than sleep?
He lay there, muscles clenched, hard-on throbbing, and tried to let John’s words temper his own embarrassment. How could he
“This is better. You’ll be your own boss. You don’t want to be at the beck and call of some scattered front office manager who doesn’t respect your time or mine.”
“I don’t know. It makes no sense! She’s accusing me of taking thousands, John, tens of thousands of pounds over the course of the past two years. I would never!”
Sherlock looks over his shoulder to make sure no one else has wandered within earshot. Taking his cue, Cetus steps further down the shore, putting more distance between them and the rest of the Senior Council.
“John, it’s enough that you think I’m beautiful. I believe that you believe I am, and that’s all that matters.”
Sherlock reached over the table and rubbed his thumb over John’s knuckles. “Okay, tiger. Let’s see what Sarah has up her sleeve.”
They sipped and ate as the sun sank lower on the horizon, and they caught up on what they had done that day and what they had coming up in the next few days. Although Sherlock had done little more than eat scones and peruse cold case files (he had solved four of them from the comfort of his chair, including one about a dwarf with a blow dart gun), John had been busy speaking with his solicitor about the family estate, the funds his parents had left him and Harry in their will, and what it might take financially to revive the old place. Fortunately, it sounded like it would be within his reach to move forward with his plans.
“Be that as it may, you involved a young woman in your shenanigans, had her break into a hotel room, then failed to notice that she was trailing your suspect and placing herself in an extremely dangerous situation. What would you have done had she —”
You'd be amazed at the amount of time KarlyAnne and I can spend discussing the merits of one word over another. "Pillow" over "cushion," "wide" over "long," "stretched" over "thin." Don't even get me started on "girth." Girth, girth, girth, which isn't even a word in this story.
“Two months ago. My therapist suggested I take a trip to break the monotony of my daily and weekly routine, so I came here. She also recommended that ‘getting back in the game,’ so to speak, might help alleviate some of the ennui I’ve experienced since coming home, so I registered with the agency and brought the folders with me.”
- releases and begins to sink. His wings propel him even before his mind has made the connection, and then he has it, flat against his tongue, protected inside the walls of his mouth.
I don't have photos of Sherlock and Lestrade sitting in Lestrade's office, or John and Laffitte playing cat and mouse, and you've already seen photos of Sidetrack ... so here are some links to johnlock fanart that I think fit this fic perfectly. I'm going to link instead of post, because I haven't asked for permission from the authors to post their art here.
Sherlock takes a deep breath and gives John his most disarming smile. John doesn't so much as blink, so Sherlock drops the smile and begins. “Okay. Just keep in mind that although you have a history of becoming seriously perturbed when I take it upon myself to decide something on your behalf without consulting with you first, you do eventually come around to my way of thinking, and always end up agreeing that it was, indeed, a brilliant idea.”
He's distracted now, anyway, searching for John in the crowd while trying to look blasé in front of his mother. If all of these blasted penguins would simply shut up already, maybe he'd be able to hear John's call. He cranes his neck higher right in time to see several of his neighbours startle, lose their balance, and fall, complaining as they scatter. John appears in their wake, flustered and dishevelled, but beaming up at him.
Mrs Hudson smiled at him blankly and patted him on the shoulder. “That’s lovely, dear. Shall I bring up something to snack on later? You’ll need to keep your energy up.”
Thank you KarlyAnne, NOOBEE, for the idea-bouncing, verb-correcting, word-suggesting beta. Each and every time I write a fic I think maybe I've finally mastered the lay/lie/lain disaster, but apparently not...
Sherlock tugged at the hem of John’s t-shirt and helped him lift it over his head. Stepping closer, he put his hands on John’s hips and pressed his lips to his temple. “Right now, we’re going to go to bed and partake in various, long-drawn-out sexual pleasures.”
Feeling a little steadier on the heels of this realisation John leaned into the doorway, hands in his pockets, watching as Sherlock tapped away at the computer on the back room desk. The pale blue glow illuminated his sharp features, making his dark hair gleam.
There was a slight pause before James cleared his throat and said, "No regrets." The two of them fell into silence again
“You’re so handsome, Sherlock. I want to – I want – I don’t even know what I want.” John slides one leg between Sherlock’s, and slips his wing around his side. The back of Sherlock’s head hits the snow with a soft thud, and John takes the opportunity to kiss down Sherlock’s long neck and across his shoulder.
Neither of them notice Ariki and Kahu standing nearby, and neither of them hear one ask the other, “Did you know there's an ice cave?”
Sherlock spread his knees a bit more, took one last deep inhalation, and engulfed John as deeply as he could. Behind him, John whined around Sherlock’s cock, whined and sucked and sucked and whined. Sherlock grasped John’s ass from underneath, prodding him with his fingers, and John began to rock his hips, fucking himself into Sherlock’s mouth.
…” Olive’s voice breaks as she steps forward and pulls him into a tight embrace. They stand that way in the predawn light, just the two of them awake under the fading stars. He did not know how desperately he missed her until this moment, but now that she is here, he has a hard time letting go.
James was quiet for a moment but when he spoke he looked Sherlock in the eye. “John and I talked about it last night. You were right when you said that I’ll be required to marry in the near future. John thinks there are several reasons to take matters into my own hands, now, while I still have some say. Despite having staff in my home throughout the week I am isolated much of the time. From both a safety point of view and for what John referred to as my ‘state of mental health,’ it might behove my situation to not be alone so much of the time.”
He poured them each two fingers and sat next to John on the couch, close as he dared. John held up his glass, so Sherlock did the same, but when John clinked the crystal together and licked his lips as if about to make a toast, Sherlock burst out with, “Is this our last date?”
When the kiss did end they were both breathing hard and flushed. John cupped Sherlock’s cheek in one hand and rubbed his thumb over Sherlock’s swollen lips. “Yeah, I’ll definitely see you tonight, Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock stared out at the crowd of people and sighed. “I don’t like to be touched very much. I apologise. I should have told you right away so that you wouldn’t have wasted so much of your time.”
John and Sherlock continue to stare while the pengs around them coo their congratulations. Sherlock looks at John. John looks at Sherlock.
John whimpered, so Sherlock pushed in a bit more, and wiggled his finger. He still hadn't touched John's cock, now entirely distracted by John's response to what he was doing with his finger; a response that looked exactly like a man blissed out of his mind with sexual stimulation. He hadn't been sure he'd like doing this, either, but apparently he could overcome all sorts of hesitancies if John loved how it felt so much. He knew he loved it when John aroused him anally, and found his orgasms with prostate stimulation so much more intense than without. How could he deny John the same experience?
“Let me know if it happens again, yeah? Or, you know, feel free to take care of it yourself.” John winked at him and Sherlock quietly congratulated himself for not choking on his tea. “You sure you’re not hungry, love? This is delicious.” John held out the piece of banana bread toward Sherlock. “Go on, try it.”
“Always did like him more,” John muttered under his breath. He shot Sherlock a wink, then pulled out a chair and sat down.
“He, oh God, he started rutting against the captain’s pants, trying to, oh, to jack off against the captain’s thigh, and he was moaning around the glove.”
“‘Dorothy was shocked that I'd gotten rid of the few personal effects that were still in there, but I told her I'd wrapped up the framed photos and anything I thought you and Mycroft might want.’ Sorry, John, she's all over the place.”
John was dressed and pulling on his boots when Sherlock came out of the bathroom with his towel slung low around his hips. He hadn’t dried his hair, and it was hanging in long, wet curls around his face. The drops running down his neck and chest were turning cold, and his skin protested by raising goosebumps on top of goosebumps. He figured the chill was worth it for the way his nipples had peaked.
When John and Sherlock walk through the front door, Angelina hops off her stool and opens her arms wide, which is not very wide at all, but still manages to pull both of them down to her, cheek turning first toward John, then toward Sherlock, seeking and receiving their kisses.
Mycroft then revisits the only option with which they all concur. It is unlikely that she has it on, or in, her body. If she has hidden it on Cassiopeia, they must find it. The four of them have studied and memorized a map of the berg that Erebus had scraped into the ice. They each have one quarter of the iceberg to search, and have been doing so as frequently as time allows.
“We’re keeping all of these, no matter what you say, but only the pictures with both of us go into the album.”
“Not yet, you don’t.” John rolled Sherlock’s briefs down another inch, then leaned in and licked around the small space between his inner thighs. Sherlock couldn’t help wriggling. He needed it. He needed John’s tongue right
They looked down between them, fascinated by the scene they’d created, Sherlock’s shirt opened and rucked to the sides, John’s bare chest, their jeans shoved down, hands on each other’s cocks, hips jerking.
“Nonsense. John has explained that he had previously given you a key and told you to use his house as a safe place if necessary. You were only doing what you thought best.”
“Kororā took Pono, and Aumārire, back with her to the heavens. We see them there, in the stars, during the darkness of winter. Kororā abandoned her kind, never to return, never again to mate, or walk amongst us, to share her wisdom, her aid, her love.
John was silent for a moment and shifted slightly so that he could look down and meet Sherlock’s eye. “You’ve never said anything inappropriate when we’ve been together. Are you afraid you might?”
John smelled good; not clean-good, like soap and cologne, but filthy-good, like sweat and booze and lust. His armpit was pressing into Sherlock's shoulder. Sherlock wanted to turn over and bury his nose in it.
John pressed his index finger to Sherlock’s lips. “You’ve been amazing. You’re the smartest person I’ve ever known. There will be plenty more kisses, tons and tons of kisses. And you were right about Harry. She had fallen off the wagon and she didn’t make it to our wedding, just like you said.”
Sherlock scowled at the spinach goop, but continued sipping. When he’d drunk a little less than half of it, he put the bottle down on the nightstand, stood, stretched, and followed John into the bathroom.
“God, no! Why would you do that? I should have just said what I was thinking, which is that you, and the shirt, and you in that shirt, are all gorgeous.”
“Very well then. I’ll try to not be a nuisance.” He gave Sherlock a brief smile, then turned and walked out of sight. A moment later Sherlock heard him make his way up the stairs and down the hallway toward his guestroom.
“I want to get married. I want to spend the rest of my life with the same person, because I want that kind of continuity, and the opportunity to grow old together with someone. I want to know someone as well as I can know them. It’s a big decision for me, and I guess I want to make sure I don’t leave any stone unturned.”
Sherlock flips through the language files in his head. "That's odd, isn't it? Her name has a double meaning."
Sherlock brings out the big fish. John has never, not once, been able to resist what he’s about to do. He takes a deep breath, puffs out his chest, and puts his bill right next to John’s ear.
“That’s the Sears Tower. They renamed it in 2009, when a London-based insurance broker bought it. There was uproar, petitions, all sorts of protests. Most Chicagoans refuse to call it the Willis.”
I think I mentioned this in the last chapter, but it's worth reiterating, as it applies to this chapter, too. When I first started this I wasn't completely sure what a juvenile emperor peng looked like. I gave John his coloured underbill stripe as a point of contrast to Sherlock, who hadn't physically matured as much as John at that point.
The balcony was mostly free of clutter and he wished it to remain that way. The bathroom was spotlessly clean and stored only a few memories of the times throughout his life he’d been ill. He sighed. The solution was there, but he was reticent to admit it. John was going to need his own room. He shifted the desk facing the bed to the right by a few feet and created a new door. He imagined the room he would find behind this new door and added built-in shelves along the walls, a wood-framed, glass-topped showcase in the middle, and a daybed for resting when he would want to spend significant time in the space. Finally, he painted the walls of the room the exact colour of John’s eyes, carefully edging around the two large south-facing, sun-filled windows.
“I would quite like to excuse you, to be perfectly honest. I like your friend. I think you should make yourself scarce now.”
“That’s absolutely unacceptable, don’t you think?” John was on top of Sherlock now, kissing his way down Sherlock’s body. “Twenty-two days,” he said, kissing Sherlock’s sternum, “is at least twenty-one days too long, if you ask me.” He kissed Sherlock’s belly button, and kept going. “A man needs what a man needs, and what I need, is your beautiful prick in my mouth, on a daily basis.” He kissed Sherlock’s right hip, then his left hip, then nosed his way into Sherlock’s pubic hair. “Do you think you can accommodate my needs, Sherlock Holmes?”
Sherlock sucks in time with the ticking bomb, suck-tick-suck-tick-suck-tick, cradling John's bollocks as he feels the pre-come hit the back of his throat. A quick glance at the timer shows that they've got exactly forty-six seconds left before joining the cosmos in a splash of biological dust and grey matter. John is getting close, panting through his slack mouth, one hand clutched in Sherlock's glossy curls, the other pinching desperately at his own nipples. Sherlock feels John's scrotum pull tight and close to his body, and deduces that they only have seconds left. The timer counts down from twenty seconds, then fifteen, then ten. John comes in a hot spurt down Sherlock's throat, then drops like a stone to the floor next to the bomb. Too spent to move, he raises an eyebrow at Sherlock, Sherlock who still has John's come glossing over that ridiculous lower lip.
After the third course past the same brownstones, Sherlock stopped and looked up at the sky. There wasn’t much to see other than the low gray cloud cover reflecting back the city’s lights.
Sherlock straightens up enough to finish taking off John's briefs. He does not fold these neatly; he tosses them onto the floor, never taking his eyes off John. Sherlock doesn't wait to be asked twice. He splays his large hands on John's inner thighs and pushes gently, gesturing to spread, and John complies. Sherlock kneels near the edge of the bed and frames John's bollocks with his hands, then he presses his face into the warm flesh, breathing in the hidden musk.
They spend their mornings with Anahera and Tui, who grows stronger and stronger each day. John checks her wrappings and consults with the other apprentices, and they all agree, Cetus included, that Tui has made remarkable progress. She spends more and more time standing, propped up by Anahera, or John, or Sherlock, and sometimes, on her own. She cannot toboggan yet, as her injured foot and leg are not recovered enough. When she is not practicing staying upright, she lies on her belly and watches the colony move around her.
John glanced over Mycroft’s shoulder and said, “Kevin and Greg are coming in. Sherlock, are you okay?”
“And what is the poundcake of sex?” Sherlock wasn’t wasting any more time on this analogy, which truth be told, was only slightly better than his French fry/ketchup analogy. He had his jeans undone and was pushing them down around his knees.
John stepped back, and Sherlock stood tall, both of them looking away, looking for something other than the other to occupy them.
Next to him, Mycroft makes a warbled choking sound. They are standing close enough that Sherlock can reach behind and give Mycroft a solid thud on the back.
“Ah yes, and there we have them, the young saviours of our modern world, falling about the place over a silly-sounding word.” Mycroft looks grim, but Sherlock can read him like one of Vela’s seaweed leaves, the kind she uses to predict the weather, or someone’s love life, or from which direction the seals might come.
“I have something in mind.” John took the book back, put it in the paper bag he’d kept it in, and dropped it back into the backpack. “Come on birthday boy, let’s go skate.”
Sherlock felt a flush start in his chest and work its way up to his ears via his neck. He ducked down to hide his face in John’s neck, but John pushed him away and placed one hand over his collarbone, his thumb resting in the notch in between.
“You have done so much. You have been the backbone of this colony longer than any other. You have changed my life, Erebus, and John’s, and the lives of so many others. You took a chance when you told me your story. Do you remember? When we went to Cassiopeia my first summer? And then later, when you told us the story of the tooth? You gave us with so very much. We were not even one winter old yet.”
As a child, his mother had taught him to see figures in the symbol: a snowman and shovel, a man playing a trumpet, a plump honey bee with its wings extended. These days, it reminded him of a posh, graceful man, reaching out toward him with a long, elegant arm.
John sounded stuck somewhere in a Venn diagram of mindblown and desperate and elated, and his moaning was going to make Sherlock come in his pants.
, one is the protected. The protected carries a secret; not with him, but on him, wrapped in seaweed, bound to his body.
On his back, Sherlock wrapped his arms around John's shoulders and kissed him, kissed him and kissed him while he squeezed his thighs to John's hips and locked his ankles over his lower back. When John tried to break away, Sherlock squeezed harder, and held him tight against his chest.
Back at The Willow they found their room tidied, freshly laundered sheets on the bed, and a stack of clean folded laundry on top of the dresser. The curtains were drawn and one bedside light cast a warm glow to the room.
“Right. So from the time we say goodbye until the next time we’ll see each other again is less than two months.”
. One is not necessarily dependent on the other, but I wanted to explore what it would be like if John were the ill one, and Sherlock was taking care of him, instead of the other way around.
. Based on those comments, this was also supposed to be lewd and silly, and yet ... it went sweet and fluffy on me.
Sherlock, not wanting to explain, had kept quiet, but Mycroft, always the one with the answers, had explained the situation. After that, those lights were always the “Sherlock lights.” Sherlock didn’t need all the lights on anymore, but as he climbed the stairs, he could hear his mother calling, “Honey, turn the Sherlock lights on, he’s coming up for his bath,” and Mycroft, mumbling over his homework, “I wonder how much lower our electricity bill would be without the Sherlock lights on all the time?”
John spat French pastry dough all over the table. “Jesus. I'm in big trouble if that's your penis, Sherlock.”
Sherlock caught John’s subtle nod, and said, “Since this past summer, so about six months. But, we’ve known each other all our lives, and have never not been best friends, so in a way it feels much longer. In a good way, I mean.” He felt relief rush through him as he spoke, and pride, and warmth. This was the first time, other than to Mrs. Hudson or John’s family, that their relationship had been acknowledged.
“Yeah, and then she said that men are never friendly unless they're interested. So I said maybe straight men, but I really wouldn't know.”
It was not known to me at the time, but became quickly apparent, that white linen goes transparent when it has been submerged, or made wet in any way. In addition, it absorbs a quantity of water that lends to it a heavy, clinging quality, allowing it to mold tightly to the form underneath. It was in this way that I first came to suspect the bounty that swelled between my sailor's legs.
John sat next to Sherlock and twisted the top off the bottle. “You haven’t eaten since last night, not a single thing. I don’t want you going all anemic on me.”
When the sun is a feather's width above the horizon, Sherlock taps John on the shoulder. He taps harder. He puts both wings on John's shoulders and gives him a tiny shake. He gives John a bigger shake. He is about to give John a rather large shake, when John opens one eye and glares at Sherlock. John looks at the sky, no doubt judging the time of morning, and glares at Sherlock again, with both eyes this time.
"Hey, listen, I don't know what really happened, and I'm not asking for any details, but the two of you may want to chill it down a bit for the foreseeable future."
John shrugged and kept walking, then grabbed a box of miniature candy canes off the shelf and tossed it in the basket.
“Shhh. Not relevant. My point is, cleanliness should focus on the parts of the body that produce the most sweat; it should be extremely thorough; and, should end in complete satisfaction for everyone involved. Like porn.” Sherlock slipped John’s socks off, and pushed them away. He stood up again and ran his hands down John’s arms, wove their fingers together, released them, and stroked back up to John’s shoulders.
“Tired. Oh! He was with her! She’s trying to take my place! Mycroft, I saw them, I went to Pobeda, there’s a huge blizzard there, and everyone is packed wing to wing, belly to back, and she … she’s practically … and he was …”
“Not really, not anymore. I used to be so afraid, though. Remember when we thought she might come back, when we worried that she would try to take Hannah?”
“I remember everything. I remember standing at the overlook in the cave, trying to pay attention to the things you were talking about, when all I wanted to do was kiss the very air out of you. I remember how daring it felt to touch you, to press up against you, and how I thought I would turn to volcanic ash when you would touch me lower, and lower, and how you would shake when I did that to you.”
Sherlock shook and shuddered against John, who responded by wrapping both arms around him as tightly as he could. Eventually Sherlock settled, and John pressed his upper hand against Sherlock's chest, feeling his steady heart rate, then higher to the base of his throat, where his skin felt clammy and warm. He kissed the back of his shoulder and was just about to close his own eyes, when he heard Sherlock whisper, "Story?"
John runs his thumb over Sherlock’s lower lip and twists his fingers into Sherlock’s hair. In one fluid movement, he’s got Sherlock on his back, and is pressing himself down the length of that long, strong body.
Sherlock gave John a thorough tour of the place and explained what he was working on, and by the time John left that afternoon, Sherlock knew a few things for certain. John was a surgeon who would never operate again, a soldier in need of a battle, and a man comfortable in his own skin—as long as that skin was in danger. He was four years older, six inches shorter, and far more experienced in just about every element of life than Sherlock. That was hardly a surprise, as Sherlock preferred to lock himself in his lab rather than interact with other people, and life seemed to happen when other people were involved. Sherlock also knew that John respected Sherlock, which Sherlock found intriguing.
“Because we’re together again, of course.” Sherlock closes the distance between them and preens John’s errant feathers, sneaking in kisses as he does so. John raises his face toward the sky and closes his eyes, basking in Sherlock’s attentions. Around them the colony is coming to life, and Sherlock knows they don’t have much time before time is no longer their own.
“That’s up to you. Maybe you know you wouldn’t want to date someone from the military, or someone who has children, or someone with a career that wouldn’t mesh with your lifestyle.”
“I like how smart you are. I like the way you see things no one else can see. I like that you keep your distance until you’re comfortable, you don’t just throw yourself at people, you don’t ingratiate. You have good ideas and fascinating interests and no matter what you do, you do it with determination. You’re honest, steadfast, incorruptible.”
"John, they’ve been working with her on that since you left because she didn’t want to wait to start learning. You cannot fault them for their good intentions."
“Mycroft, Sherlock, this is my mother, Terina. She is the kindest, best, smartest peng you will ever meet.”
“Get caught in the storm?” John asked, mouth dry, nodding his head towards the rain streaked windows.
John laughed his way into a giggle, shaking his head and covering his mouth with the back of his fist.
“You know why,” John says, pushing his plate back and picking up his own wine glass. They stare at each other, remembering and imagining, until John says, “I'm not going to tell you how sinfully good it feels to have your legs wrapped around my back as I fuck you, not right now, not here, because then we'll need to leave right away so that we don't get banned from ever coming back like we were from that Chinese place, yeah?”
Sherlock had not anticipated the strength of the colony’s reaction to the two of them waking up with an egg on their feet. Since then, only two days ago, they have swapped the egg back and forth numerous times, and taken turns greeting friends and family who want to congratulate them and hear the full story.
Greg scrunched his face up and sighed. “Yeah. I guess he did. I didn’t have two cents to rub together, and he was pretty persuasive. Thing is, I figured out pretty quickly that I didn’t like being taken care of – I’m too independent. I didn’t want to answer to someone else just because they were dropping three-hundred bucks on dinner, you know?”
“Sherlock and I will be at your house tomorrow for Thanksgiving, but on Friday I'm driving downstate to spend the weekend with my niece and her family.”
“Well, who am I to go against Kevin’s aesthetic?” Sherlock buttoned his fly and smoothed down his pockets. “You look great too. That light blue does things for your eyes.”
Sherlock doesn't need to be asked twice. John snugs his head under Sherlock's chin and wrestles his shoulder under the taller bird's wing. Sherlock knows everything there is to know about heat conduction, but feigns ignorance now, luxuriating in John's warmth. No one is as warm as John. Not his mother or father or, well, that's pretty much the extent of Sherlock's experience with snuggling, but John is positively thermic perfection.
“Yes,” Sherlock interjects, “but it could have been any type of seal, even one of the fifty species that are now extinct. Maybe their legend died with their kind.”
“Precisely. And as a result, your trust is, might we say, not what it was when I first took guardianship of it.”
He stepped in and gave himself over to the hot water streaming over him, and to the steam swirling around his body. He stretched up, going high on his toes, then bent at the waist and sailed down, pressing his palms flat to the tiled floors. His hamstrings sang with the release of tension, and his back sighed in contentment as he brought his hands to his knees and curved his spine toward the ceiling, then the floor, then back again. He rolled his shoulders, hung his head from side to side, then stood and pulled his shoulders down by clasping his hands together behind his back.
Sherlock feels the weight of the tooth on his chest lift. It is lighter now, it is a lessening pressure on his heart. He drifts on the last of the diminishing waves. They reach him, surge, reach deep inside. Warmth floods through him, tugging at every experience, every memory. The waves stir through his ice palace, sifting, leaving a burst of recognition behind, snowflakes tossed in a storm.
The surface, with its streaks of dim light and flashes of sky, rushes to meet them, and they launch. Their angle is perfect, their speed is perfect, but Tui starts to slip out from between them before they’ve cleared the water. Sherlock contorts himself mid-air, trying to bring his free wing over and across Tui’s chest. It’s not ideal, but it’s enough. They still have her when they land, hard, Sherlock on his back, Tui on top of him, Anahera pressed to their sides. They skid and slide, careening over the ice, bumping along, and Sherlock’s head and neck and back hurt terribly, but they’re safe.
Sherlock hovers above them. He tries to break through the dense haze covering Pobeda, but the wind keeps pushing him back. Snippets of John and Maryle’s conversation reach his ears, and fuel his determination. He must reach John. He presses down again, trying to break through, wanting to make his presence known. He calls to John, he calls and calls, until his throat hurts and tears are falling from his eyes, mixing together with the sleet.
Sherlock wastes no time flipping them over and using his knees to spread John’s legs open. “I do beg to differ, John. I predict you’ll be the one moaning like a whore in church by the time I’m done with you."
At 6:55 p.m. Sherlock was standing next to one of the tall windows at the front of the flat, peering out onto the street below. The light was muted at this time of day; still bright but soft around the edges, slightly more golden than harsh white. There wasn’t much pedestrian traffic anymore, but taxis zipped back and forth, rushing their patrons to their homes and to business dinners, and to dates, like he was about to do.
“It’s okay. Mrs. Hudson said Mycroft went through the same thing. He spent less and less time here, at home, as he got older. I remember that, too, that his junior and senior year of high school, we would hardly see him for days on end.
He spread his legs and leaned closer so he could whisper in John's ear. “Talk penile anatomy to me.”
"No, she's right, though. No one would know for sure, should he vote to dismiss the allegations, if he did it for the right reasons." John has been quiet until now, but sees the way the numbers are aligning and gains confidence.
John ignored all of these asks but didn’t delete them. He did, however, delete the one that said that hedgehogs and otters were sexy together.
“There weren't enough plows, and the ones that were out couldn't clear the streets because of the trapped cars. Bilandic announced that the city would clear two hundred and fifty parking lots for people to move their cars to, free parking included, but less than half of those were ever cleared.
Sherlock stepped into the garment carefully and pulled it up his thighs. He settled the top band low around his hips and shimmied until he felt the g-string stretch into place between his legs and arse. With one hand, he gathered himself into place and smoothed the front placket over the resulting bulge. It was obscene looking, he thought to himself. He smiled. John was going to love it. He turned this way and that in the mirror, examining the various perspectives. He thought John would appreciate the view of him in profile with the curve of his arse counterbalanced by the prominence of his cock nestled to the front. Hell, who was he kidding? John would love any view. He’d love seeing Sherlock head on, or from behind, or lying down. He’d love Sherlock bent over, spread out, on his hands and knees. Sherlock touched himself through the white silk.
John stopped where he was but began to rock up and down, fucking himself on the half of Sherlock's cock he had taken.
John pinched the plump flesh of Sherlock’s ass, then kissed the tingling away. He licked Sherlock's balls, rubbed his nose up Sherlock's cleft, rubbed his thumbs over Sherlock's lower back.
Sherlock checks off items on a mental list, and nods. “Yes, Sir. That helps. I only have one other question, but I am not sure that anyone here will have an answer.”
The drive was long but uneventful, spent mostly watching the cities give way to towns and the towns to villages and farms. They passed Mrs Hudson’s thermos of tea back and forth and ate the sandwiches and biscuits she’d packed for them, laughing about how offended she’d been when they told her they would just stop for a bite to eat at a roadside motorist stop.
“Poppycock, Sherlock. If what you said is true, there will be a proposal here within the week. We have work to do!”
Coffee, muffins, and cookies were temporarily forgotten when John pushed the door open with his elbow, and found a still naked Sherlock sprawled face down on the bed. He was a long line of lean muscle and subtle curve, capped by a mop of disheveled curls on one end, punctuated by long, graceful feet at the other. It was, however, the impossibly ample bottom jutting up in the middle that most caught John's attention.
“No, I actually don’t think so. I don’t know her but I’ve observed her and what I’ve observed speaks to a person with a strong work ethic despite, or perhaps due to, many setbacks throughout her life, a caring attitude towards others, including animals, and a generosity that unfortunately sometimes defies common sense and self-preservation.”
I know it's taken me a while to get back to our boys in Chicago, but here we are, covering December 29, 30, and 31 of their winter break. :)
“And how are you, my dear? I was so saddened to hear of your loss. I realize you only knew them for a very short time, but your stepparents were absolutely delightful pengs, always so generous with their time and energy. They will be sorely missed.
John smiled. “I don’t think our physical attraction to each other will be diminished by who’s around us, but I do understand why you wouldn’t be comfortable acting on it right now.”
“I will not listen to one more word of this if you are about to tell me that she wants you to mate with her and give her an egg.”
He rested his forehead on Sherlock’s shoulder and began thrusting, everything still but his hips and ass, his thighs clenched, his lower back flexing.
She takes a step back now and cocks her head to one side, inspecting her work. “Janine, stop slouching, you’re creating a gap between yourself and Lestra. Anthea, we need to fatten you up a bit; you’re too thin for anything but the middle of the huddle. Bless you, Stamfjord, you’re a regular peng hotspot, you are. Irena, move closer to Stamfjord.”
He sucked one of John’s balls into his mouth, and mutual groans resonated between them as the puckered skin tightened on his tongue and bunched against Sherlock’s full lips. He held John there, like a cat playing with a mouse, teasing, not letting go, just
“Fine,” Sherlock huffed, reaching for the remote and the laminated list of cable channels. “No sausage unless it’s organic and homemade. God knows how that mass-produced stuff is made. And no vegetables, especially not onion. No pseudo-vegetables, either, like black olives,” he added, as John started talking with the person on the other end of the line.
There was a clinking sound of a spoon on crystal as they both moved to sit on the couch and accept the short pours of whiskey Sherlock’s father was offering.
“Since before we were together. Since high school. I saw some pictures in a gay porn magazine, and then I kind of couldn't stop thinking about doing it. To you.”
Sherlock experimented with rolling his hips and lifting himself up and down, loving that John could just lie there and watch Sherlock ride him. He picked up the pace a little, feeling the slow slide and burn give way to the buzz of stimulation, and he chased after that, riding up higher, faster, coming down harder. John's hands were squeezing Sherlock's flexing thighs, and Sherlock's cock was slapping against his own belly, drops of pre-come smearing and clinging to his flushed skin.
Sherlock took his letter and went back upstairs. He slid it into John's duffel bag and then let himself into the steam-filled bathroom, shucked his robe, underwear, and T-shirt and stepped into the shower behind John.
“I thought,” John said between deep breaths, “I thought you wanted me to do you standing up, up against the wall.”
I've gone back through chapters 1-8 and added more images, as everyone likes them so much. I don't own any of these images, so I hope it's okay to borrow them from the internet peng gods. The adorable photo of Sherlock face-planting has mysteriously disappeared, and I have no idea where it went. I think my code is fine, and a thorough internet search has come up empty. If anyone can find it, please please please let me know.
Sherlock shuffled forward and wrapped his arms around John’s waist, pressed his bare chest against John’s still outside-cold sweater. “I love it. I can’t believe I didn’t think of this myself. Of course we need to have a tree. Oh!” he said, stepping back, eyes wide. “We need ornaments, too, and lights! We need a tree skirt, a star, garland. Do we need garland? Hmm, maybe not garland. White lights or colored lights? Blinking lights, I think.”
“I'm serious, Sherlock. That was unbelievable. You should've seen yourself, riding my dick like a fucking cowboy, like you were totally getting off on it. I can't even tell you how turned on I was.”
John had started unbuttoning Sherlock’s shirt as he talked, and continued doing so as he answered. “I haven’t been there in years. I don’t remember much about the neighborhoods. What about Boys Town? Is that an option? Where’s that?”
Sherlock cringed in the hallway, wondering how far he should let her go with this fond retelling of his babyhood. He could stop it right now, announce himself, insist that she keep her secrets. He wanted to know, though. He wanted to hear what she had to say about this forgotten part of his young life, because not even he had figured out a way to retrieve memories not already stored, memories of life before the existence of his mind palace.
birthday party. Apparently it's a honey-themed affair, and our gift is a photograph of the three of us to remind our worker bee comrades of our undying friendship.”
The John Hancock is Chicago's second tallest building. I much prefer its observation deck to the Sears Tower (Willis, whatever).
Sherlock puts his own glass down on the nightstand and moves to stand in front of John, smoothing his hands down over his waist and rolling his shoulders just a touch, feeling the ruffled trim of the corset tickle his bare skin.
John came back from the other side of the table and read the tin. “You know we can’t actually use that for
John obliged. He set a pace that had them both working to stay in place; Sherlock pushing back against the headboard so he wouldn’t skid forward with each thrust, and John pulling on Sherlock’s hips to keep him balanced over his knees.
“And do you remember what Kororā said, in response to him? She said that he could not hope to know all the mysteries of the heavens and the gods that ruled them. She reminded him that her father, Atutahi, had lain with a male god, to create her brother, and then with a female, Kapua, to produce herself.
John squeezed Sherlock’s hands in his and took half a step forward. He kept his head tilted down but looked up into Sherlock’s eyes. He took a deep breath. “Okay. So. I’ve planned something that I think is important, and I think you’re going to be mad.”
Ariki peeks out. Ariki steps out. Ariki shakes out his fluff, lifts his bill, and comes to stand by Kahu’s side. “Yes, sir. I heard Sherlo-kimi call. I didn’t know who Tahu-John was then, because I was just a little hatchling at the time, so I didn’t know who he was looking for. But then Sherlo-kimi called your name, and Elder Siger’s, and Elder Cetus’, and then I knew what we had to do. And Kahu is very, super fast, so we decided he would go and find as many of you as he could, and I would stay and wave at Sherlo-kimi so he would know help was on the way.”
Two minutes in and Sherlock reiterates that Mycroft should've picked another topic. He should've picked something erudite about the calving of icebergs or the decreasing krill populations. Instead, he is stumbling over himself in his attempt to educate the chicks about their fledge and the subsequent courting rituals that will lead them onto the path of parenthood. That the chicks will not mate or become parents for several years seems lost on him.
. Your friend. Sherlock, when I hugged you, and you pushed me away, and you were so upset, so afraid for her, I thought –”
John planted one elbow on the table, narrowly missing a smear of brie, and rested his chin in his palm. He leaned toward Sherlock and licked his lips, and then he whispered. “What would you say if I asked you, Sherlock Holmes?”
Sherlock turned his face into the bed and sucked in air through the sheets. Oh, he wanted it, he wanted it so bad. Why was it so hard to say it? He turned his head again, laid his cheek flat on the bed. “Pound—pound my ass, John. Hard.”
“I’d hurry up and tell us the truth, if I were you, because she’s going to come back any time now, and if you don’t tell us, I’ll ask her myself.”
They moved around the kitchen, John working on the food prep while Sherlock set the table, rummaged for candles, and filled their wine glasses. When he was done with that, he joined John at the counter where he was snapping the ends off the green beans.
So John told them vanilla stories about ice skating, but John’s fingers were brushing up the underside of Sherlock’s forearm toward his elbow, which was pressed against his stomach, directly over his crotch. After circling Sherlock’s elbow a few times, and while talking about the capacity of the Millennium Park ice rink, John dropped his hand under the table, over the placket of Sherlock’s jeans, and squeezed.
If Google translate is correct, John’s bit of Scots Gaelic means, “You’re more beautiful than this view.”
For example John Watson is kissing me now and despite having dissected many human tongues over the years I never would have imagined that a tongue could do THIS but then again it is John Watson’s tongue
John ducks his head under Sherlock’s bill, and sighs. “Mmm. Can we slip away, right now? What are those two penggits doing?”
"First, each and every peng, regardless of age, ancestry, pairing status, or Council affiliation, is entitled to a private airing of any grievance against them, so that the allegations brought forward cannot bias the colony before the Council can form an opinion and announce action.
“Me, too. But then you did push me off. You didn't say a word, you just went to get the hot chocolate, and I thought maybe you’d seen something in my expression that you didn’t like, or that you just didn’t like it, period.”
Sherlock stepped back so John could reach the rest of the buttons. “Okay. I could do you first if you want.”
“I have spoken with Hudi, and she has informed me of the loss of your personal artefacts from the ice cave. She feels certain that Moringa absconded with these items. I must admit, I was reluctant to assign blame so soon, without endeavouring to understand her motives. Now, however, I believe I may understand.
They stop talking as they approach the entrance to the cave, each of them out of breath, each silently anticipating their time here. John enters first, then Sherlock, then Hudi. Hudi has only one foot inside the cave when John shrieks. The call is one of outrage and warning. Sherlock doesn’t make a peep. He is too shocked to open his bill.
Sherlock pulls back, straightens up, feels dizzy. “What? Oh! I guess you could say I traded in the tooth for this. A new talisman.” He tries to kiss John again, all his feathers quivering in an attempt to release heat. John’s wings are sliding over his chest, under the seaweed rope, testing the weight of what it holds inside.
“I would hope not. Guy like you, I’d say it would take a good fifteen years before you gave a guy a chance.”
John was waiting for him with a fresh towel and a quick peck on the lips. He tasted like chocolate chip cookies. “I pulled out clean jeans and a shirt for you. And underwear and socks this time, too.”
Sherlock is not convinced, but the sound of crunching snow interrupts their conversation, and he turns to see who approaches. It is John, and even though Sherlock just saw him, and spent the entire night with him, he loses his breath yet again when he sees his handsome
John smirked and tossed the flannel toward Sherlock’s head. Sherlock grabbed it out of the air, soaked it, and ran it over his neck and shoulders. John came to stand by the tub, hands on his hips. Did John realise that his index fingers were pointing directly at his beautiful penis? Sherlock was allowed to stare at said beautiful penis, wasn’t he? He stared.
“You know her?” Sherlock asked, looking back and forth between John and the woman he’d just identified as Mary.
Sherlock rolled over, bringing his eager erection with him. He folded his arms under his head and tried, rather unsuccessfully, to glare at John. “Look. Look at what you’ve done.”
“No, it’s all you. Can I maybe make you something to drink? We never turn the espresso machines off so they’re ready to go in the morning. You want a chai or something?”
Sherlock thinks back to the time he and the seal tooth were under the influence of each other, and of the places he’d travelled. Did he dream of meeting Pōrangi or did he truly meet her? Is one the same as the other when considering something that might not exist in the first place? What if someone proved that everything he had experienced was a figment of his own overactive imagination? Would it matter? No. Because he did experience it. Nocturnal dream or celestial divination, he experienced what he did, so the realm in which it took place is not significant. What is important is that it changed him.
They have more personal narratives to explore, and they turn to each other, eager to pick up where they last left off. The summer has left signs of maturity on both of them. John's grey fluff has given way to mottled black and white feathers, as has Sherlock's. Neither have achieved their adult height, but Sherlock is two sure wingtips taller than John now. Sherlock has seen his reflection in the water from time to time, and he knows that his body mirrors the changes he sees in John's. The bulk of their shape is shifting, from their hips to their chests. Their wings are elongating, which helps tremendously with balance and locomotion. They have longer, stronger tails, and longer bills, too. Most of their new height is in their torsos, but some of it is found in the stretch of their necks, too.
“The quarry? Wait, yeah, I do remember that. We all went, Harry and my parents, Mrs. Hudson, Sherlock and Mycroft. We had a huge picnic for the 4th of July, right?”
Sherlock kissed him again, his mouth, his nose, his eyebrow and forehead. "Mm. Okay. Let's get you better. This is the first time I'm the doctor."
“Imogen is in a deep and profound sleep, and is not likely to wake up before seven tomorrow morning.” Sherlock kisses down the side of John's neck and wedges one knee between John's thighs.
