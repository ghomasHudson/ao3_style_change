This is the point where the bartender is convinced that Dean is just as strange as Castiel. He's  already doubting their FBI credentials. They should get going soon.
A chopped off head is as good a reason as any to drive out, really. Dean knows that he’s not acting completely rational.
Eventually Dean said: "If I didn't believe in us, would you think I'd have stuck this out for so long? But let's not kid ourselves. We're not happy, what's the point in denying that?”
When someone sat down on the sofa next to him, he thought it would be Castiel. He had been quick to notice how overwhelmed Sam felt at this party, he'd led him to this couch and told him he'd be back with a drink for him in a minute.
"I know how important Sam is to you. I don't want you to think I don't take your pain seriously or that I believe that mine is a priority. It's just difficult for me to think of other things until I know where he is, what he's doing.“
There's no waterworks, no wailing. Instead, Dean emits a single sound that's closer to sea lion than a human being.
"You know…." Sam shifts in his bedto get a better look at Castiel. "You don’t have to wait around for him like this all the time."
If anyone else said this, it would sound cheesy and off. Sam knows Castiel means it. It's not just a phrase to him; he actually knows Sam's soul.
"Rough gig," Dean says, as they leave the factory behind. The sun, so mild and dismal an hour ago, glares down with ferocity now. Castiel looks at him in question. "Staying here," Dean says, putting a hand to his forehead to shield his eyes.
He stretches out his legs. A root sticks out of the ground and presses into his calf. It is not unpleasant to feel his body in such a way. It is not pain, just a punctured, concentrated sensation in one bundle of nerves.
It was just as bad as he'd imagined it would be. Dean forced his lips into something resembling a smile.
"It’s just…" Castiel hesitated. "Maybe it’s not the best idea that we’re all so very close to each other all the time. Maybe we —"
"So apparently you’re the thing I want most in this world," he says. Which is not what he’d planned on saying at all.
"No. Hang on." Dean waves a hand, doesn’t let him finish. "You know me. I’m a tolerant guy. Like I said, I just thought you were a late bloomer. It’s a bit weird maybe, I mean, after all that time, but I’m not going to judge. But now you’re telling me, you’ve had gay sex with angels before and you can’t even tell me who with…?" He shakes his head in disbelief. "What the fuck, Sammy! Why are you keeping shit like this from me?! Don’t you trust me?"
"Life is tough?" Sam chuckles like a crazy person in a horror movie, which is a pretty apt description for what this feels like to Dean. "That’s your great advice? Pretty sure I’ve had enough of that sentence for my whole life. At least when Dad used to say it… No, you know what? It’s not different at all, actually. You both are exactly the same. The whole tough love bullshit when you’re both so screwed up yourself. He went crazy when Mom died, not that I can blame him for that. But you…." He pauses. "At least I’m being honest with myself. I’m not ashamed to say what it’s really like."
The feet of his daughter kept kicking him without much strength. Sam's thigh was flush against his. The soothing voice of the documentary filmmaker spoke of the vastness of space.
The next thing he saw out of the corner of his eye was Charlie, throwing herself at the man from behind. Before she had reached him, he whirled around. Blue light that lit his fingertips flooded the room. Charlie tried to dive away under him, but she wasn't quick enough. Her knife fell to the ground as he grabbed her by the neck and lifted her up.
"Do you know what a hybrid is?" She whispered against his shoulders. He didn’t know what she meant. "It’s a cross between two different species. Mules, Ligers, Geeps. Stuff like that. Zoos used to do all kinds of crazy experiments. Most of the hybrids wouldn’t live for very long. They were sick a lot." She paused. "It works better with crops, which is why hybrids are used almost exclusively in agriculture. They grow bigger and sturdier and are important for the industry: they cannot multiply, so the farmers have to buy new seedlings every year." She raised her head. "Nephilims are hybrids of angels and humans. That’s why they are more powerful than the angel who created them. There is a reason why angels aren’t allowed to procreate with humans."
"I know what I said, and it’s still true in a way, but if you still have feelings for Dean, if you… If the both of you want to explore these feelings, then -  I would understand. And." He took a deep breath. "I just don’t want to hear about it."
Like thinking of Lisa and Ben, memories of a nightmare-turned dream-turned nightmare. Unlike most of the people he's lost, they're not actually dead. He’s periodically checked them in weak moments, thanking and cursing the ease of Internet at once. They’re not dead. It’s more like they’ve never existed in the first place. The closest thing he ever came to an actual family of his own.
"I'm kind of surprised," he shrugs. He opens the trunk and pushes the shopping in between Sam's and his own bag. He closes the door with a loud thump.
"Oh, for fuck’s sake!“ Dean turned around and hit the wall with his flat palm. There was no strength behind it. This was pathetic.
Sam bolts out of the door. He barely notices Anne's curious eyes following them outside. On the street, he looks at the flyer again, and then down the street, to the left and to the right, trying to figure out the directions.
"Sorry, honey. I have to go." He spoke quickly. "I just got an urgent call. But I'll call you tomorrow, okay? We'll see each other again soon."
»Did you see that? The fridge is overflowing with food! A roast, a potato gratin, a green bean casserole...« He slammed the door shut. »What the hell?! I mean, I was planning on having dinner with you guys, too, but I was thinking of something less elaborate. I'm not that much of a cook and you two, well..."
"With God?" Castiel looked at her perplexed. "Well, he was never there and I don't mean that figuratively. Almost no angel has ever seen him."
There was little Sam regrets as much as falling for her, but there comes a point when apologizing over and over again for the same thing just feels hollow.
"Yeah, so, that’d be another good reason for me to want to stay in the bunker, I guess. You being here."
Dean takes Sam's outstretched hand and lets him help him up. He nods when Sam asks if he's okay and then Sam turns away.
"You could have called and asked," he says. When he realizes how defensive it sounds, he adds: "I mean, there was no need to worry. I'm fine."
"Given the circumstances, it was the best option and success proves us right. You are alive and her existence seems to be hidden from heaven so far. "
Sam's eyes wander over the ceiling of his room, the sparse decoration, the chair and his desk. "I don't know." He knows he does aspire to it, always has. "I think order is. And order and normalcy seem pretty similar a lot of times."
An old metal sign, of which he only knew from experience that it announced the Singer Auto Self Service Salvage Yard, was thorougly covered by the snow and threatened to fall off the rotten wood any minute now.
Dean and Castiel both lean against the window sill, half a foot apart. Dean has his arms crossed in front of his chest. "So I gotta admit: this is a case, and it's our kind of case, too." Castiel looks satisfied at this, almost smug. "Still got no clue who or why or what though."
"Yeah," Sam huffs. "Of course you know. Anyway, I just can't remember him ever being like this with Dad before. I mean, of course they fought at other times, but this was different. It felt like it went on for a really long time, too. And the weirdest thing about it was, the way they acted like I wasn't there at all. They flat-out ignored me. The whole time, I was just sitting there and they didn't even look at me once. Maybe I'm remembering it wrong..." Sam shakes his head again.
The next few days were uneventful. Dean repaired the old wooden roof, which took more time than he’d expected. The rough sea climate had made some of the shingles so porous that they were falling apart between his fingers. Sometimes Sam came to help him. It surprised Dean every time, for if Sam wasn’t out here helping him fix the roof, his brother avoided him. And even if they were in the same room, Sam’s mind seemed far away. In the past few weeks he’d been oscillating between passive aggression and an eerie calm, as if he had lost a child and not his daughter. But if Dean was being honest with himself, he knew it had started earlier. Sam had been distant ever since they’d moved. He knew Sam was in pain, and felt helpless in the face of it.
There was something in her eyes, maybe her angelic power, that made it clear how serious she was. Even the idiotic sheriff must have felt it; his entire posture changed. He cleared his throat.
"Yeah." Somehow, this is worse than being asked about Dean. He feels he is going to misspeak and then what? What does he care what she thinks about them, why would it make him feel so uncomfortable?
"We are responsible for ensuring that God's creation does not perish. We protect people's souls. Like yours. It is our burden to watch over someone like her."
"That doesn't make much sense. Are you sure you are okay? You're still behaving very strangely, ever since last night. Dean thinks you might-"
Dean still had a strange feeling when he looked at the door sign or the wedding pictures, which were hung in colorful frames all over the apartment. The Winchesters live here. It felt surreal.
"Cas," Sam says, touching his shoulder, drawing his gaze away. "The thing got away from Dean, but it shouldn't have gotten too far."
He walks back through the shop through the back door. He joins Castiel in the empty parking lot, feeling dirty, and very silly.
He’s pretty sure they’re sleeping in the old screening room. That’s where he would go if he had to sleep in an old cinema. In fact, it is where he has slept before. If the seats are cushioned well enough, it’s not too bad. There’s lots of space and it’s warm and cozy. Although he’s not really sure how vampires feel about the whole warmth thing, since they’re cold anyway.
The feeling of something heavy crashing into the back of his head is familiar. Sam tumbles forward, his face makes contact with the tarred ground, something pointy scratching his cheek.
"Is Castiel not coming with us?" Sam asked, confusion on his face. Dean tried to see if there was something more in his expression, something like disappointment.
Castiel looks disappointed, and a little ashamed, too. Dean can’t stand knowing he put this face on him. "Just don’t do it again, okay?"
"You think it’s going to rematerialize or something?" Dean asks skeptically, his gaze following Sam’s to the floor.
"Okay." She rolled her eyes again. "This was just you distracting me anyway, so we wouldn't be having the conversation I was actually going for. Thanks, Dad. ”
"I’m not pissed off," he says, his voice softer now. "I’m just…" He takes a step back and leans against the projector. "I didn’t want to do this in front of Cas."
"I know it’s not the Hilton and your apartment in Seattle was a million times more beautiful, modern and superior in every way." He let go of Castiel who was still looking at him with unfathomable eyes. Dean wondered if it was because he didn’t know what he was supposed to say or if he didn’t understand what Dean was talking about. "Real estate prices in California are a little crazy. Even my super smart brother must have realized what he was getting himself into when he started looking for houses out here."
"From one day to the next, right? That's what they all said. That they suddenly changed, not gradually."
"Were you just playing footsie?" Dean’s mouth is full of food. It’s difficult to tell if he’s amused or angry. "Maybe you should wait until we’re back in the bunker. You’ve got to pace yourself for another 15 hours or so."
"Hey man, listen, you were the one who didn’t even want to hear Cas out, and now you’re totally eager just because I don’t think there’s anything?"
"No." Sam looks up at her. "I'm not asking you if you are. The therapist asked me that. And that stuff. It's all over the pages. It's odd, right?"
Occasionally it feels like they're playing a game with unclear rules. He enjoys that, figuring each other out and finding their boundaries. There's a strange thrill to the newness and potent danger. And in these moments they're in this together, both on the same page.
"No, but you might have been. You’re injured. Something really bad clearly happened to you, if you can’t even heal yourself."
"You’re right. We should contact Dean." Sam manages to look into Castiel's eyes. "I'll text him about the coffee shop. And you, um," he throws a side-glance at Lucifer, who nods encouragingly, "maybe you should head back to the girl's house for now."
"Yes, but he can comfort her and that's what she needs right now. Even if both of them are like fire and water right now, they're very close. "
"I have seen you dance," Castiel insists. "In your memories. I think you were working a case. You were wearing a tuxedo at least. Do that one."
Dean gives him a look and walks towards the bathroom. He's in there for a few minutes. Sam looks over the floor, over the bed, wondering what he's going to say in an attempt to fix things. The apology or the affront. It's hard to gauge Dean's reaction in advance. Both strategies would be an honest reflection of Sam's feelings: he's sorry for his elusiveness and the passive aggression he can't help at times. But the avoidance is backed up by real anger too.
"What I don't understand," Castiel says, "wouldn't that mean that every victim had therapy here? Even people who were affected in Canada?"
"What?" This time Sam can't help but turn around. Cas has got his arms outside of the blanket again, his hands back on his toes peeking out under the woolen throw. "What do you mean, more welcoming?"
Sam tries his waffles. They’re okay, somewhat dry. He eats some of it. He’s not really feeling hungry.
She hesitates for a moment, runs a hand over her shirt. She's not wearing her fake police uniform anymore. When they got to her car she pulled a T-Shirt from the backseat and changed in the middle of the street. Sam had turned away to give her privacy that she had neither seemed to expect or particularly wanted.
"Don't go. Please. Don't.” Castiel's hands wandered to his shoulders and held them in such a firm grasp, he knew it had to be painful, but Sam didn't even flinch.
Dean can hear his blood pumping in his own ears, just like he knows they can. Probably thinking they’re just dreaming of prey.
"Are you sure I can't help?" Castiel's eyes are searching his face. "It makes me feel so very pointless to just watch you suffer."
" There's the tiniest of question marks. Even though Castiel is just explaining why it's not working between them, hearing him call him his boyfriend feels nice. These kind of words apparently matter more to Sam that he expected.
He couldn’t answer. He felt dizzy. No, he felt like he was drowning again. Felt the pressure on his eardrums grow with each second he stood here.
Castiel kept squeezing Sam’s hand that lay on the table, as if to confirm that Sam was really there.
"Exactly!" Lucifer claps. "That’s what we’re trying to figure out right now. Why can’t I? You want to hear my theory?" He takes Sam’s hand and pulls him up further, into a full sitting position. "I mean, really, it’s your theory, but you know what I mean."
"I still don’t get it. How can you be so sensitive to hot sauce?" He heard Dean laugh. "You’re an angel."
"What do you want to hear? How bad it all was? You want to hear how angry I was? Why I didn’t leave?" He clutched the steering wheel tighter. "Sam was really unwell back then. I think it was this mixture of lying to me, all those crazy hormones, him panicking about becoming a parent and all the unprocessed hell trauma." He laughed. "I really thought I was losing him."
"I think she was trying to be supportive of us being here out in the open. Two guys. We're not in the most progressive neck of the woods."
"You know that's not true. We all love you and you just got into a little fight with Lila. That's no big deal." Sam pulled her close. "Who do you think doesn't like you?"
Out of the kitchen, there's a bang of metal against metal. First Jody laughs, then Sam joins it, softer.
It's the old-married-couple bantering and bickering indicating they’re both trying for normalcy.It feels a bit contrived, but it does do the trick.
"What are you saying?" Sam asks, uncertain. Castiel moves his shoulder ever so slightly against Sam's.
Dean's only bothered getting rid of his shoes. He's lying otherwise fully closed on the covers, the pillow sandwiched between his arms, snoring lightly.
"Are you feeling better, Sam? Did the night air help ease the strain?" Castiel sounds concerned and so full of compassion that it makes something inside Dean squirm.
"Did they seem…" He's trying to find the right word. "Agitated? Off? Was there anything you noticed at all?"
Castiel kisses him with such ease that it’s hard to believe this is still new to him, too. There’s nothing confused in his touch.
It’s strange, how normal he sounds now. Even though he’s still slumped half-dressed on the bathroom floor, and doesn’t look like he’s about to get up.
"But." Castiel wrinkled his forehead. “I don't mean this is a criticism, but you don't work. Where do you get the money from?"
"No." Of course that doesn't mean anything to Castiel. But he must see something on Sam's face, because he gets up and walks over to him with a frown. "Why?"
Castiel reached for Sam's arm and looked at his watch, as if he didn't know what time it was by himself.
“But these books are all so slow! They tell you something once and then they repeat the whole thing again for 100 pages!"
Castiel looks a little hesitant. Sam hates that he's managed to make him look so insecure. He closes his eyes again and gently presses his forehead against Castiel's.
"It’ll be two more weeks of you being okay. Maybe by then I'll find it easier to trust that you can take care of yourself again."
Castiel really likes hugging, too. Sam is pretty sure that Castiel doesn't technically need to breathe. Sam likes to think it still means something when the rhythm of his breathing changes. When Castiel presses his face into his chest and the muscles under Sam’s finger start to relax. Or when they kiss and the opposite happens. Castiel’s exhales become ragged and there’s a hitch to his voice when he speaks against Sam’s lips.
"Why do you care? You and Sam both. I'm working the case, and I work it right, so what's the problem if I'm not feeling it?"
Dean reloaded the gun. The outlines of a human body moved along the wall. Dean took aim again and pulled the trigger.
Sam walks over to her knowing what he will find. No pulse. He kneels beside her, and avoids looking at her face for too long. At the white of the one eye visible through the blood, at the shards of glass protruding from her cheek. But his hand is quicker than his mind and he picks a shard out of still warm skin.
Dean had figured out they were hunting a Japanese ghost  quite quickly, although he still had no idea what a yūrei was doing in the middle of South Dakota.
"He said he was straight, when he’s not. And I get that people change, I do. But he lied to me for years, man. Decades even. All his life for all I know." He paused, feeling how emotional he was getting. "I get if he wanted to keep this shit from other people, from Dad, friends, other hunters, whatever, but from me?"
They're watching in silence, until Castiel finally —and apropos nothing— says: "I keep having shameful thoughts."
"You can't stand to be apart from either of us," Sam says. There's no malice in his voice, just stone cold acknowledgment of the fact. It's strange how pathetic Sam makes him sound. How easy it is for him.
Dean waited a beat, before he went hunting down the right bottle to keep him company through the night. He thought of the second pillow on his bed and wondered if he should throw it out, but he knew he would keep it where it was.
He’s speaking mechanically, quietly, acutely aware that he’s most likely just talking to himself. He’s saying pretty much the same thing he’s already left on Cas’ mailbox anyway.
For a brief second Dean lets a question cross is mind: Is Sam the most important person in his life still? Maybe Dean's just so used to this being true that he can't fathom it any other way. He's never been good with changes after all.
He should have found a shit hole instead. Somewhere where people expect nothing of you and you don't expect nothing of them. You get drunk on a dime and fuck in the alleyway, and that's just fine. Or maybe what he needs isn't a warm body at all, and hustling pool and showing some idiot the ropes would feel better. You'd think solving a case on your own within a day would make you feel more accomplished. It wasn't even a 'going through the motions' kind of case. He had to rack his brain quite a bit before he got anywhere and he's pretty sure he heard his left ankle snap at some point. He turns his foot testingly in both directions; it hurts a little, maybe it's sprained. He can get Cas to take a look at it. A warmth spreads through him when he feels the ghost of his fingers on his forehead.
Sam gets up and reaches over the table to take Castiel's hand. With his other hand Sam reaches into his pocket and fishes out a 20 dollar bill, that he throws onto the table. All of a sudden he can't wait to get out of here now. At the door, Sam catches the waitress' eyes across the room and smiles. She returns his smile, unsure, her notepad pressed closely to her chest.
"You sure you’re not describing someone else?" Sam mutters and Dean can’t even tell which of them he’s referring to. "I really don’t understand what your problem is. Cas isn’t stupid. If he says he’s just checking out if there’s a case, why would I question that?"
But he knows exactly how betrayed Sam would feel. Maybe he’d even tolerate Dean's sexual phantasies, but this? This strong yearning? This thing that feels like it's tearing himself apart when he thinks of his best friend? Yeah,
Sam's sitting upright now, the laptop next to him on the couch. The book Dean's brought is still untouched.
"I don't know what kind of help he needs," Jody admits, a defeated smile on her face. "I just know you can't do it all by yourself, with or without Castiel. I'd tell you to get some help, too, but I know you won't."
The coffee shop is your regular hipster place. Dean immediately thinks of it as Sam's kind of place. He can picture it. Sam with an open book on his table and the biggest cup they offer next to it. Doing research for hours. Dean suspects this kind of stuff gives him as much of a sliver of the other life he once had as possible. It's probably why Sam loves library so much, too.
"Yeah. I doubt I could forget. But your meatsuit’s still human and you said you were feeling a bit more human-y than usual anyway, so just give it a try, huh?"
"Anyway, it's Friday today and I thought that maybe you and Sam could use some time for yourselves. Especially because it's been so exhausting having me around."
"Okay." Sam looked around the room for his bag until he remembered that he had put his clothes into the closet. He had to pass Castiel to get to his stuff.
It would be pointless to ask what they are doing here a second time. They go up to the side entrance. A high metal door leans ajar. Dean has learnt that these kinds of places can hide anything behind them, literal portals to heaven and hell, but when he enters he sees nothing but an ordinary factory. One that doesn't even seem abandoned at that. He's greeted by a large high-ceiling room, full of shiny chrome and long metal tubes and conveyor belt constructions. Walking past in quick steps, trying to keep up with Castiel, he can't figure out what kind of factory it is. The name on one of the tanks is of the generic sounding Something Something and Sons variety, revealing nothing about its contents. Castiel's heels make a rhythmic sound against the concrete floor until he stops in front of another heavy door. Dean wonders why Castiel is so sure of where they have to go. Whether he's been here before.
He thinks back of when she’d told him. Them lying on a motel bed after they’d had sex, her feet in his lap. He’d bent down to kiss her toes.
Dean slowly licks over his chapped lips. He feels dizzy. He can't afford to feel dizzy right now. He needs to focus, needs to observe with a razor sharp concentration. It's not working.
"When I got here and you weren't there -” Dean closed his eyes for a moment, as if he felt a dizzy spell. "I thought I lost you. I thought something had happened and -”
When Sam turned to his brother, he expected an amused look on his face, but Dean had turned his back on him. He knelt on the floor and was busy emptying out Bobby's backpack.
"He is angry with me," Castiel knows. "He talks to me, but reluctantly. He will not let me touch him, he avoids me." Talking about it stirs a yearning deep inside him.
Sam’s jaw tightens while his arms go slack. It’s the way Dean looks at him now that shuts him up completely. There’s some worry in Dean’s eyes, maybe, but it’s mostly disappointment.
Dean ignored the comment, his face still fixed on Castiel's. "I know that Sam wanted to go, but why were you there, Cas?”
The problem was that hunters didn't retire. The only way to leave was on a burning log. Some days, days like today, Dean wondered if the dead had intentionally forgotten about him.
He never got around to asking his question, nor did Charlie manage to answer him, because at that moment a middle-aged man came up to her. He clapped his hands slowly.
"But you’d be into that kinda thing? I mean, I don’t know how the whole angel sex thing works…. if you guys are just wave lengths and shit."
"So?" Sam shrugs. "Maybe it scares me for a good reason. It’s always gone wrong. And it’s also-" He looks at the bare wall on the other side of the room. "The last time I tried, actually tried to get out, I did. I loved it, but in retrospect, it was selfish. And even then I only managed to leave, because Dean was, well, I thought he was gone for good. You and him, both actually."
"The secretary," they both say in unison. Sam shakes his head; he should have thought of her long before. She is the obvious solution. "But if it's her, she already knows we're looking for her."
"A one-time thing?" Dean raises his eyebrows. "Yeah, cause we have such a great history with the devil nestling inside your head, you thought one time couldn't hurt? I'm really trying to wrap my head around your thinking here. Because the way I see it, there's just not one good reason to keep this a secret from me and Cas, that isn't worrying in itself."
"What are you apologizing for? I just hope you feel better soon. You look really pale. If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask. There's some painkillers in the bathroom, if you need any."
But there it is, a good view into the room. The light from the street lamp illuminates the scene conveniently like a stage lamp.
Hope of some of you enjoyed this in the summer heat (or cold, depending on time and place, I guess..). Thanks for reading. <3
Castiel cleared his throat. "Sam. You know I would do anything to help you. You just have to tell me how."
"Dean," he hears right behind him. Castiel stands against his back so that they're both under the patio. He holds his coat over both of their heads. "Sam has the key to our room."
"You don't think she's going to notice files missing after you ran out on her?" Dean glares at him.  Sam feels uncomfortably aware of the two other people in the room watching. He doesn't mean to cower, it's just what his shoulders do. He's found his ways to deal with Dean over the years, to pacify him, but it's different when someone else is around. Their dysfunctionality is much harder to ignore when he gets to peek at it from the outside.
Sam has been stirring his coffee for a good five minutes now. There’s no way in hell it’s still hot. Tepid at best.
Sometimes it is still difficult, after all these years, to fuse this ripped and muscled torso with the image of Sam in his mind.
"Are you sure?" he hears Sam ask in the background. "Yes, thank you so much for getting back to us. And again, my deepest condolences." He steps back towards them and presses his lips into a thin line, as he pockets his phone. Dean looks at him expectantly.
"You’ve been working for heaven again? For how long?" His eyes were narrowed. "When Michael and his consorts still did this job, they didn’t have to sleep with the prophet to protect him."
He turns away from Castiel without another word, and heads for the entrance. Outside the coffee shop nothing’s changed since they arrived. Of course not.
"I see.” Castiel smiled, albeit a little sadly. "I just wanted you to know that you don’t have to feel bad on my account. I know how much you loved her. If you feel the need to talk about her, I am here to listen."
He looked beside him at the passenger seat. Charlie had put her legs up onto the dashboard. Generally, he was not okay with people treating Baby with so little respect, but he just couldn't tell her off. He was much too happy to have her with him, sitting there tapping her fingers on her thighs to the beat of the music.
He squeezes water out of his hair, some of which runs down his face over his chest, down to the thin trail of hair on his lower abdomen.
He took a few steps towards Castiel. "This is so fucking ridiculous," he said and tapped against Castiel's chest.
"I don’t care. I just figured it’s not my place to explain anything to her. If you guys don’t want other people to know, that’s your thing."
"No," Castiel says. "I am not certain I know why I did it. There was a strange tugging feeling inside my chest when I contemplated telling you, as if I were catching a pulmonary disease of sorts. I did not wish to strengthen this sensation and hoped to suffocate it altogether by avoiding this sort of confrontation with you. I did not mean to stay away for so long."
"I'm not hiding it. I'm just not talking about it. I don't want to burden him. Or anyone else. I don't want to make things worse with my paranoia."
But that's been taken away from him. Because, really, he could take his razor now and slash his wrists and that would get him, what? 10 months in hell?
Castiel looks up at him through dark eyelashes. There’s something about that look and the way he says "Yes, I like it," that is almost comically seductive.
Just then, the phone in Sam's pocket vibrates. "It's Dean," he reads. "He says the case is done. He's just gonna tie up some loose ends." Which suggests the case maybe isn't completely over, but he decides to trust Dean on this and not hang around. "Let's drive back home."
The frown on Akiko's face deepens. "Isn't that what happened at the therapist's office? People asking for the truth? When they had to talk about living an authentic life? There were definitely bits about living their truth." She is getting agitated now, talking faster. "Maybe that's all it took. Maybe the therapist didn't know anything about it, but the words were what made it come true. You know, and she helped the deity by accident?"
"You don't have to do everything Dean says!" he spits out. "Dean was wrong. Dean is wrong a lot. And you knew it wasn't a good idea to leave. You said it yourself: if it had been up to you, you wouldn't have left."
It’s near empty. The three of them stand out like a sore thumb. Cas’ get-up alone would be enough to get everyone to stare. Dean should have gotten him to wear some of his clothes instead.
"You're too old." Dean paused. "And besides, you wouldn't have come to me if you were expecting. You and Cas would throw a party."
"I don't understand. I just told you I cannot help you right now. I've not just disappointed your brother by failing my mission, I'm failing you. I have nothing to offer you. I walked away from you as a coward and I return weak, unable to give you the help you've been missing."
He walks towards the wardrobe, grabs a faded black T-shirt and then goes to look for his stash of painkillers. There's quite an assortment of bottles and tubes. Some he’s got from hospital visits, others from cases. It never hurts to check the medicine cabinet, monster or not.
The thought of not the projection of his vessel, but of actual Lucifer enters his mind. It’s so much worse still.
"Just so we're on the same page here, when you say 'we all agreed’' what you really mean is the both of you?" He put the bottle on the table and pointed his fingers first at Castiel and then at Sam. "The biological parents, while I’m just the stupid uncle who teaches her baby language to dumb her down and who poisons her with cookies?"
"Does Dean ever join you?" Castiel asks. He’s still wearing his trenchcoat, and if the cinema experience is anything to go by, he won’t be taking it off any time soon.
It can't have been the cold. Castiel is still fidgeting. Sam keeps throwing him looks, inviting him to talk, but there's nothing.
The bed opposite his, the one covered by that ugly yellow, moth-eaten throw, was still empty despite the late hour.
Sam felt angry as he stood in the tiny bathroom, taking off his clothes. The plastic shower door rattled as he pulled it open. He turned the heater to the highest setting. The burning water helped a little. At least he no longer felt quite so outside of his own body.
"It’s confidential." Sam puts on his professional smile, it feels as fake as his badge. "Can you tell us anything about Mr Smith?"
He tried to push the feeling of injustice and despair that threatened to overpower him out of his heart. Charlie had put her face on the smeared table. Her blue eyes followed his every move. Every now and then a sob went through her body.
Dean's hands felt good on his body; they always did. He was skilled, too, in the art of making love. He knew where Castiel liked to be touched, and how he preferred to be handled.
There was another, clearly human scream. They paused and listened to the silence. Then they ran again.
"Besides." Sam rubs a hand over his forehead. "This wasn't what she did. She just stopped people from lying." Everyone but you, Dean thinks. "Whatever is going on here is different." He breathes out heavily. "You know what I was wondering? What if this isn't really our kind of thing after all."
Sam is ready to look for rock star allies in the list of names, but they checked in under Winchester.
Maybe he’s too tall, too much body mass for one measly pill, and that's why he's still awake, he considers after half an hour. He hasn’t taken Ambien in years. Artificial sleep is never as refreshing. It makes him feel like shit the next day. This was such a stupid idea. Why didn’t he just seek out Jody instead? Or suck it up, ignore the stupid thoughts. Get his laptop out and work. Anything would have been better than this.
Sam still doesn't know most of what Castiel used to do back when he wasn't living in the bunker. Back when he'd come in and out of his life as an unpredictable visitor. Who was he spending his time with once most angels wanted nothing to do with him anymore. Does he have other friends, people or places he misses, that he doesn't get to see because of Sam.
Everything swirled away, scenes overlapped and faded away completely. When Sam opened his eyes again, he was sitting on his bed in the bunker. Next to him, Charlie was sleeping in her crib. Her little face twitched in her sleep, as if she was dreaming or thinking hard.
It was maybe not the best opening sentence after running into a hospital room, but he didn't care. He was angry and confused. This mixture resulted in an unsavory mush that almost burst his head.
"It's really embarrassing how drunk some people get at gigs.." He heard the woman's voice and her heels move away.
"Good morning," Sam says, a little self conscious from the way they stare at him. He knows the look on Dean's face. He remembers it from times when he's woken up after uncertain days of unconsciousness.
But then there’s Sam rolling his eyes at him in that "You're so dumb but that's just how you are and I'm so not surprised" way. And Dean's not even sure why it's so easy to tell apart from the "I hate you and I can't wait to get away from you" one. But here it is. It feels so goddamn good to see Sam like this —alive, and not rejecting him— that for the moment it seems enough. It seems worth the pain.
"I thought you would have done it ages ago. What is it you told me? Sam is always honest and would never lie to you? He fully trust you? Yeah, man, this is truly what trust and honesty looks like."
"It's perfect. Teenagers want stuff just so badly. The intensity helps. And they're incredibly gullible, too."
He let the sentence run into the sand. Then they could do what? Keep the PDA to a minimum? Be really quiet?
The more he reads through mundane news articles, the more his stomach clenches. He’s always half expecting to stumble upon something that would indicate what has happened to Castiel. Which is a dumb fear, because how would he even be able to tell? “Handsome, perpetually startled-looking man with piercing blue eyes found dead” wasn’t a headline likely to appear in the Omaha World-Herald.
Dean notices the big gash on Castiel’s shoulder. His shirt is ripped and there’s dried blood on a wound that looks deep.
"It's fine. Really. It's there for me to use it and I can't think of a better way than making you better."
He remembers meeting Armisael in a town in Kentucky and driving out into a field, which —at the time— had seemed like a perfectly reasonable thing to do. He'd needed information and one of the few friends he'd still had left had tried to help him find it.
Afterwards, it's not as awkward as he thought it would be. They get dressed in silence. He fishes for his jeans, hazy and light-headed. "You okay?" he asks.
He doesn’t run into her. He doesn’t hear her. Maybe she’s in her room (maybe she’s avoiding you, after how weird you were acting, ever thought of that, huh?).
She's disarming and easy to speak to. Dean talks more in half an hour than he has in the past two weeks combined. Not about the stuff on the forefront of his mind, but other stuff, nothing concrete. Drinking preferences, other werewolf kills, trash movies of the 80s. It's not like he feels they know each other. But it's nice. She knows a version of him that only exists inside her head, a version of himself he likes better than the real thing.
Sam had given the two of them less than two months; Dean's relationship span was usually shorter than the shelf life of yogurt, and Castiel and Dean had little in common. Sam had been wrong.
It’s late in the evening on a Saturday night. They’re all sitting together doing research out of habit rather than necessity.
He feels terrible about last night. The fight with Castiel was ridiculous, and yet when he starts thinking about it, the anger resurfaces.
"Humans are weird, Cas." Sam squeezed his hand tighter. "Always worrying about things that aren’t really based on facts, just feelings."
"You say you can't tell people about your feelings, about your fears. It sounds like you're living an inauthentic life."
"It might be an animal attack," Sam says. "But I doubt it’s a bear. It couldn't hurt to check it out."
"And you don't miss an opportunity to demonstrate that you'd be the much better father. And that I should probably be thrown into jail for child abuse."
Sam looked at his own hands for a moment. The expression on his face was so pained that Castiel felt a strong urge to walk over to him and embrace him.
Dean has no idea where this is supposed to be going but he has a feeling that he won't like it. He plucks a piece of lint off his jeans.
»This guy and his damned angel. I should have known right away.« Bobby looked at Sam. »Did you know Castiel was here?«
It didn't even bother him anymore that she nestled her dirty face against him. His clothes were in need of getting washed anyway. Maybe after Charlie was asleep he could get that gone.
"I thought about that a lot over the years. Pretty much every time when I cursed myself for the fact that I still... cared about you."
They drive back to the bunker and spend the rest of the day researching Castiel's presumed case in Oregon. Sam is still not entirely convinced they got anything supernatural at their hands. Sometimes when people mess up they cling to anything that gives them some kind of reassurance why it's not their fault. But he doesn't want Castiel to disappear on his own again; he wants to work this with him.
Dean expected Sam to be jealous, or irked at least, seeing Castiel in his clothes. It's a ridiculous notion. As if you could assert some kind of ownership over a person that way. But Sam hadn't been there. Hadn't felt Castiel's breath against his earlobe. Hadn't touched his icy skin and felt the electric pull. Dean knows that it's a good thing Sam can't see these things. Still. Sometimes it would be nice for someone to acknowledge it. The tiniest bit validation that these things are there would be enough. Just to be reassured he's not going insane.
Other times it feels like a really fucked up therapy session. Right now, intimacy always has the aftertaste of taking your medicine at regular intervals to make sure you won't get symptoms in the first place. Sam is still waiting for the ease, the spontaneity.
He checks the kitchen and his own room. It's probably nothing, but with Sam's recent behavior he's less worried about an intruder than whatever Sam’s brain might have cooked up.
"I don't care what you tell your parents or the police — because believe me, the police will come and you better think of a good explanation for all of this." He looks at the boy, then at the girl. "We're taking the book with us. Whatever you do, if you touch that kind of shit again, we will be back. I guarantee. And you don't want that. You understand?"
"I didn't do it on my own," Dean says. He's not sure if he's supposed to feel flattered or irritated. Being on someone's bucket list like that feels weird. He’d thought he’d enjoy being treated like a sex trophy more than he does.
It's only a theory, a shaky one at that. It’s not something Sam would even want to ask him. Not something he's willing to say out loud. Besides, while it might work, he's not sure he would want Castiel to be someone who'd agree to that.
She only turned to him briefly. "Lucky you. It's Sunday, so you'll actually get something to eat that doesn't totally suck. Probably pizza or something."
What made him pause in the middle of the hallway was the fact that he didn't understand a single word of what was being said.
He walks away in hurried steps. He only slows down once he reaches the Impala. And then out on the street, he doesn't slow down for miles.
Her voice shouting "I’m back here again" echoed through the bunker, even when he didn’t see her anymore.
"No." She tried to push his hand away. Her sobs sounded like those of a small child. More people looked over at them. "I don’t want to go. I want to kill something! I need to kill something before I can go back home."
"Not deities," Sam says, a little less sure. He looks around the motel room, trying to spy his tablet.
"Thanks." He downs the rest of his first drink, and starts on the second. Now the waitress looks at him with pity instead of interest. Well, you can't win them all.
It’s absurd because when he’s right there, just barely hanging on, one or another sort of apocalypse hanging over them, he hates it. The feeling that everyone’s just slipping out of his hands and he’s barely holding on. Like the stuff is really not up to him but to chance. To sheer fucking luck and nothing else.
"She's only five, Dean. I know you looked after me on your own for days when you were her age but... " He sighed. "You shouldn't be angry with her."
"How are you feeling?" Castiel asks. Sam doesn't miss that Castiel has barely stepped into the room, with his back still against the door. Sam can't blame him, but it stings.
It’s an earnest question that takes him aback. That’s definitely not something he’s comfortable with answering truthfully.
He shouldn't just let them go, but he can’t kill them. They're teenagers, and this is just the sister and a hanger on. It should be fine. Most importantly, they're human and that's a distinction he still tries to make, if circumstances allow it.
“What if I die and he needs proof that he’s her father?“ Sam ran a hand through his hair and then shook his head at himself. “Well, if I was dead, then Cas would probably go to heaven with her anyway, if they let him. He certainly doesn't need proof of parenthood there."
"This has nothing to do with Ruby," Sam snarls. "Congrats for knowing she was playing me long before I did. And I’m sorry for actually thinking someone was on my side, trying to help me. Do you want me to apologize again for something that happened a decade ago?"
When Sam steps out of the bathroom, Castiel is looking through the dirty glass window, his eyes glued to the night sky.
He doesn't bother going to the bathroom. He pulls off his jeans and his shirt and slips underneath the covers. If he can fall asleep quickly enough, he won't have to feel all the shitty things that are just about to take over again.
In the bathroom, Castiel sits down on the rim of the bathtub and watches Dean intently as he takes the disinfectant and the gauze out of the cupboard.
Sam follows Lucifer's gaze and pulls out a flimsy piece of paper. A flyer for a coffee shop. Castiel looks down at the paper in his hands, like he’s considering just how crazy Sam is being right now.
It is not the same, Sam wants to explain. They are not the same. Dean doesn't doubt himself with these kinds of things. Someone is either a friend or foe, period, and Dean trusts himself to tell the difference. But he doesn't trust Sam to do the same. He thinks Sam has a blind spot, based on his tendency to veer off the right track.
"Sam,” Castiel finally managed to get out, and Dean immediately stopped. He pulled his head back and turned his questioning, incredulous eyes onto Castiel's face above.
He starts humming and eyes Sam closely, looking for some sign of discomfort. But he seems, well, just, normal.
"I don’t see how that’s relevant or cause for anger. Why does it unsettle you so? If he now found out that he liked a type of food or drink he previously thought he did not, it would not make you question his very being. You wouldn’t feel the need to alienate him."
"So..." Sam says, which is a stupid, needless thing to say, but somehow it really doesn't matter. He feels surprisingly at peace with his inadequacy.
"You’re better at understanding me then," Sam says, firm. "I'm used to him reading me well, but not other people. Not for a long time, anyway."
Dean made sure the gun was back under the pillow before walking towards the door and opening it with a quick movement. He would have expected anyone, just not the person at the door.
They haven’t mentioned it. A week ago when Sam had returned from the bathroom, Cas had been sitting on the bed in his a pair of boxer shorts and one of Sam’s shirts, that had looked very much oversized on him.
There’s something that feels very absurd about an insecure angel. Castiel not understanding why Sam would want to spend time with him is such a strange notion, that he needs a moment to let it sink it.
When his hands would wander, when his mind strayed from generic faceless, nameless women to the same intense blue-eyed stare and Cas’ voice softly moaning his name. The shame always intensifying the arousal, edging him on, hastening his hand. Afterwards, he always tried to forget it happened.
"Nothing," Sam says and rubs a hand over his jeans. Castiel keeps looking at Dean, a look of pain or pity on his face. Then Sam sighs, and apparently that means something in Sam-Cas code now, because Castiel says: "Sam and I were wondering if you could drop us off in Salt Lake City on the way back, once the case is over."
He considers Dean’s advice. He feels quite incompetent and not up to the task of talking things out.
Castiel leans back into his chair. "It's not a question of what I think. It is a statement of fact. You are unique, Sam. This world wouldn't exist as it does if it weren't for you. Your existence itself and the decisions you have taken have shaped this world."
Did Dean tell him how messed up he was while Castiel was gone. How Dean literally dragged him to the bathroom. The thought makes him uneasy, not because Castiel isn’t allowed to know, but because it’s not Dean’s story to tell.
"Hey, um," Sam appears in the doorway. "So the food is ready and on the table now." He's wringing the blue checkered kitchen towel in his hands. He looks tired. "If you guys still need a minute..."
"When you fell asleep you seemed content with my presence, but I know you also said you felt it would be awkward if I stayed."
Dean takes a step forward, just so he can reach and kick a stone out of the way. He lets out a low groan. "What the fuck is that even supposed to mean?"
Charlie's shoulder tensed under Castiel's hand. "When I'm not around, you mean. You can just talk right now. I'm not a little kid, you know."
It was merely excruciating pain they could give him. They would not kill him: they clearly needed him for something.
He wishes he could go back to that dream-less sleep state from before, the one he so rarely gets to experience.
He had to admit that he could not fool himself: there was no place where the outside world out there couldn't reach him. Where the 'what if' thoughts were kept at bay and the tugging feeling that there was another place he wanted to be, too.
"Hey," Dean says, voice gruff in an effort not to let it go too emotional. He touches Castiel's elbow, makes him face him. "It'll be fine," he promises. "Sam'll be fine."
"I've sent the mail to you. You can see for yourself. You know him best. Maybe it's nothing." She pauses. "Be careful, Sam."
"You know, angels sleeping with the people they’re supposed to protect has a long tradition in heaven and in this family in particular." When she looked at him, Castiel felt that the attack was quite unfair. He wasn’t involved in this fight at all. "Cas’ job was to get your soul out of hell and not your body into his bed. Isn’t that true?"
"Sure," Jody turns to him, bumping into Sam's side while doing so. "You guys can already set the table. You know your way around here, Dean, right?"
Dean shrugged. "It’s normal to worry about your children." A second later, he added: "At least that’s what they say."
The most absurd thing about this day was that, in some way, Sam found himself enjoying it. It probably helped that everything felt more like an absurd dream than reality.
Dean flinched when he noticed his poor choice of words. He looked at Sam, but his brother either didn't notice or pretended not to. He held his shoulders high and was still staring into the distance.
He doesn't have to face him to know that Castiel's dipping his head now. He can feel it, hear it in his voice, even.
He reaches towards the other chair, and pulls off Castiel's clothes. They're clammy but not as wet as Sam expected them to be.
Sam's phone rings. He holds up a finger and steps aside. Akiko flashes Dean a smile, that he returns without much enthusiasm. She still looks good but different. He'd taken her for a real cop, the way she looks so law-abiding and compliant. There's none of that rugged charm he remembers.
"Yeah, but it's fine. I told him we were on our way and that everything was okay, just bad traffic. And that he shouldn't get his boxers in a twist."
"I should go after him." The way Castiel said it, it sounded more like a question than a statement. Sam had almost forgotten his presence. He didn't know why he felt angry with him. Maybe because he hadn't intervened, maybe because Sam was angry with everyone right now, most of all with himself. He managed to swallow down the anger and disappointment and shrugged.
Dean laughs and reaches around him again to grab four of the right kind of forks. He puts his other hand on Castiel's lower back, to turn him around and guide him into the other side of the kitchen. "You can go grab the plates," he says. "They're over there in the cupboard."
Only Bobby still didn't seem to know what was happening. Sam gave him a compassionate look and shoved the bowl with the green beans towards him.
"Well, having a child does that to you. It changes everything. You just want what’s best for them. That’s normal, I think."
"Oh no, how horrible. I guess he should count himself lucky that this year the School of Engineering is skipping the Great Classic Rock Semester exam and is asking about IT instead."
She is too stunned by his brusqueness to reply. Dean takes out his phone and checks the current phase of the moon. "Waning crescent," he reads out loud. "Huh."
He's glad Dean's gone out to do some grocery shopping, and won't be back for a bit. He's never quick. He talks to people, he knows people. He's at home in this town, while Sam is forever a visitor.
Not that either of them had said much else, when they’d returned to the school. Sam had momentarily been too distracted by the unusual image of Castiel chewing gum to ask.
Dean’s standing in the lobby of a closed-down cinema in Bessemer, waiting for his eyes to adjust in this dimly lit foyer. It’s so not the right time to think about Sam’s damn feelings.
Sam is still trying to think of an adequate reply, when a waitress approaches their table. She pulls out a small notepad and pen and looks at them expectantly.
Moss grew under the willow. The green hanging off the branches formed a protective tent against the distant noises of the street, and the rays of the sun shone through only weakly. Inside the tent, they were in their own world where nobody could reach them. Sam took the woolen blanket he'd stolen from his motel bed out of his backpack and spread it out onto the floor. They were a well-rehearsed team; they understood each other without words. Dean smiled as he followed him onto the blanket and spread out his own blanket over them.
It looked slightly bizarre as Castiel, completely out of his element, made his hand into a half-fist, brought it to his mouth, and mimed biting into the air.
"If you’re so inclined, we could stop at The Filling Station or at something called The Crow’s Espresso Bar on our way?"
Castiel blinks. "Yes. Sam said it did, at least." He furrows his brow. "Is this what you wanted to talk to me about in private?"
"He's not in his room, or in any of the other rooms. There are a few locked ones, but I assume these are locked for a reason."
"You do ingest a surprisingly large amount of caffeine on a daily basis," Cas says, almost admiringly. He's got his hand on Sam's shoulder, as they leave, gently pushing him through the door, away from Dean.
Lucifer walks up to them, crouches down, his knee almost bumping into Castiel, as he peers into the box.
By now, Dean was pretty sure Sam must have seen them last night. He was definitely not going to admit more than he had to. »Whatever you think happened, Sam, you're wrong.«
"Listen, Dean." Sam pulled himself upright by the handle. "It's not that easy. We haven't had the best relationship in recent years and... "
"Okay... When he appeared again yesterday, he said he was there because I'd 'engaged' him. And that if I wanted him gone, I'd have to make you go away." Sam catches a breath. "I guess that's the gist of it."
He liked people. He had always found them interesting, even before he had gotten to know Sam and Dean. But when viewed up close, he felt like a zoo animal among them, with masses of visitors knocking against the glass. How did Charlie endure this? She seemed to know everything and everyone on campus. Strangers fell around her neck to greet her.
"No." Sam looks spooked at the suggestion. "No, Dean, I'm trying to say I'm angry about stuff that isn't on you." He breathes out, heavy and a little shaky. "You know when you asked me what I said in my therapy session and I blew you off. It's because I told the truth. And I don't feel good about the truth."
Dean swirls his index finger through the syrup on his plate. He gets up, sucking on his finger, while Sam’s hurrying off to the parked Impala.
"What it feels like. To lose something that you wanted so so badly, knowing that it was never meant for you."
They both lean forward to drink from the milkshake. If it’s a bit of a cheesy move, then so what. Sam doesn’t mind.
Lebanon, Kansas is not the best place for stargazing. But it's also not the worst on Earth when it comes to light pollution.
He wants to hear him say: "Of course I would never sleep with a man." Or: "Of course I would never sleep with a man that isn't you."
Sam went for a run. It's something he's started doing regularly again. To keep things in check, but also, he knows, to show Dean he's fine. Healthy. Durable. Able to go out and take on a case. He doesn't want to push it, doesn't want to fight, but he’s starting to feel restless.
Sam takes a step forward. "Didn't at least some of them talk to you about their experiences afterwards?" Sam asks. "Even if they all stopped coming to therapy, shouldn't you have noticed something was off?" She straightens her back, and the alarm bells in Dean's head start ringing again.
"I’ve had people guessing all kinds of things." She counted on her fingers. "That he’s my father, my brother, a jealous ex." She laughed and rubbed over her nose. "Like I’d ever date someone this much older."
Castiel shook his head, his arms still wrapped around Dean. "It's a miracle that you kept her from leaving for as long as you did."
He didn't when Dean had joined him in the library. He stood next to one of the bookshelves, somewhat indecisive. As if he didn't dare step closer before Castiel gave him the okay.
Castiel furrows his brow. "Sam promised me he'd tell me if any hallucinations should occur again," he repeats, like this is all there is to say.
"Then you were born. I found out about Cas and we talked about it and then we all raised you in the bunker."
Sam leant back into the couch, he gazed into the air. They had no lamps turned on, but the bright city lights illuminated the room enough to notice the unsurprising fatigue in Sam's face.
Dean turns around to Castiel. "What are some of the other names you got? Anyone else who might have a yoga connection?"
He stands up and walks towards the door. His hand lingers on the doorknob for a moment. He's either waiting for Dean to say something or he's trying to decide if he wants to add something himself.
"Alright." The chips package crackles under his fingers. It’s all gone, leaving Dean to draw back empty-handed. "What’s the deal between you two now?" The roof of his mouth is coated with a greasy film. He lets his tongue run over it, while he waits for a reply. "I know you guys talked."
"If I actively tell you all the crazy shit in my head, how can you be okay with that? How can you want this?" Sam nods down at his chest. "How could you want me, if you truly knew me?"
Castiel sorts through the cupboards for forks and knives. He acts like he's never seen cutlery before. Dean steps up to him from behind. It's still an awfully tiny kitchen and he's not sure if he should be thankful they're not on their own or not. He reaches around Castiel, takes the dessert forks out of his hands and puts them back where they came from. "We don't need these for burgers," Dean says, his chin hovering above Castiel's shoulder.
"Never mind," he says. He can tell this is going nowhere. "Thanks for your help. Greatly appreciated."
"This was really nice." He forced the corners of his mouth into a smile. "I mean, I wasn't with anyone in a long time and that was -" He shook his head. It had been good, but to act like he'd be able to separate the physical from the emotional this time would be such an obvious lie. "What I mean to say is: I hope you know that I like you and that it wasn't just a spur of the moment thing to me."
Sam had cleared his bed off Charlie’s residue. Since she’d gotten her own room, his had returned to the old sleekness that didn’t reveal that anyone lived here permanently. Sam stood, his palm pressed into his side, and glared at him accusatory.
"Rough night?" A voice next to him asks. If that's not the least original line he's ever heard. He plans on telling the guy to shove it, but when he turns his head, he's too startled to speak. His sky blue eyes just throw Dean for a tiny second.
The only thing Dean does is keeping him from ending it all. Out of habit, maybe. And because he can't let go. Because he can't accept the fact that Sam would be happier if everything ended right now. Completely. For real. Finally.
As they clinked their glasses, the painful feeling of nostalgia and loss pervaded Castiel once more.
Castiel grips him by the shoulders. "I did not mean to startle you with my absence. But when you fell asleep again, I thought it best to let you rest."
"That's not true," Sam muttered. He was rubbing his forehead again, looking anywhere but Castiel. "I mean, it's not true that I have no positive feelings towards you. I'm not angry with you or anything like that."
There's only room for the tiniest bit of uneasiness. The uncomfortable knowledge that he will have to upset Dean. But it's only a trip. It's only a vacation. He will have to understand.
It felt like a recognition of a fact he'd accepted deep down long before. After all, he went into the whole thing knowing, thinking he knew, of the thing between Dean and Castiel.
"Don't you think I get how this works between you and him? I know that as soon as Sam'd do anything that gives you even the faintest of hope – you'd go and try to -” Dean shook his head. "You wouldn't just sleep with him. You'd run away with him if he asked you to. You would leave me if he asked you to.”
"I’m not complaining, I just-" Dean shrugs and walks over to the small fridge that's buzzing softly. His face lights up when he takes out a bottle of cheap beer. "It's not the ghost hunting that I want to be compensated for. Just the whole bullshit back there... We’re putting our lives on the line for trivial shit. I mean, the thing with Cas back there, what was that?"
He thinks of the stupid moment that started all of this. If he just hadn’t stumbled over his own words, feeling sorry for himself. If he’d just told Jody what’s up. He wouldn’t have ended hallucinating fucking the devil.
Dean looks at the angel. At his angel. Slumped against the ugly car of his like a beat-down salesman after a long day of unsatisfying work.
"So we were lucky this time," Sam said. "But I'm losing her, I know it. Either she's going to die or she will just – I never thought I'd be father of the year material, but that I would fail this miserably? That I would manage to alienate her so much?"
Back in the hallway, he stops before he Sam and Cas see him. He half-hides behind some lockers, which is kind of ridiculous, but it doesn’t matter much to him right now.
"I think Sam conjured him up himself." Castiel looks at him expectantly, like he's just revealed a big secret.
"No. He didn't. He just said something about a coffee shop." Dean furrows his brow. He feels annoyed at Sam. His brother is probably trying to hide his and Cas' relationship issues from Dean. It's not like Dean feels comfortable in the role of their marriage counselor. But he doesn't need Sam to start hiding shit from him again, either.
A gunshot rings in Dean's ears. The werewolf slumps down over him and knocks the last of air from his lungs. He gets so dizzy he’s seeing black for a second.
A key turned in the lock of the apartment door. Dean turned towards the hall, and when he heard the footsteps moving toward the kitchen, he'd already guessed who it was.
Dean is on his laptop at their big table, looking for strange patterns in the news. Either Heaven and Hell have been especially quiet or he's just not in the right frame of mind for this kind of thing. Knowing the fucked up state of the world, it's probably the latter.
"That is not true!" Castiel actually sounded angry now. "I did nothing of the sort. I faced your fears and demands for years. I tried to make it work between us. I would never ever have split up with you!" He pointed his finger at Dean's chest. "You broke up with me. That was your decision. I take responsibility for all my mistakes and actions, but that was not me. This is on you."
But who knows what he'd do if he were a monster. Desperate times need desperate measures. Besides, Dean is not going to complain about someone making his job easier.
Sam had almost forgotten about Dean. He shrugged. "She's an angel. Of course she doesn't get sick. "
He's thankful for the 'we'. It makes him feel less alone. She promises to call back soon. She tells him not to worry about the police. She promises him it will be fine. He knows he should be able to do this on his own, but he's too grateful for her help; he clings to the familiarity of her voice.
"Yeah. It’s to the left, and then down the hall. I’d show you but I’m not supposed to leave the desk unattended."
"You were productive before you had a job too." Castiel stroked over Sam's side, his fingertips ghosting over the sensitive skin. "Raising Charlie is an important task."
"Don't worry," Sam told her, then he turned towards Castiel. "Look, Cas, I-” He halted. He looked torn.
"Fine. I know you’re right. There’s no point in trying to get you off my back. But I’m not going to pretend that I’m okay, when I’m not."
"No, please do repeat yourself. I clearly need reminding as I still have not fully understood what you’re trying to tell me."
Dean raises an eyebrow. "I think so. Check my bag. Took some complimentary ones from the last place we stayed at."
Dean uses his fork to cut the last pancake into big pieces, it’s easier to get them all down that way.
"I'm almost there," Dean groans. And then, after another minute or so, the shovel is hitting on wood.
share a bed." She sounds more carefree now that she knows she hasn't caught his boyfriend cheating with his brother. "Well, maybe that's why they went for the kitchen. It's roomier than Sam's bed."
Inside, Sam and Castiel are helping Jody in the kitchen. Or rather, Sam is helping and Castiel is trying to. He's holding a loaf of bread in one hand and looks around the kitchen, clearly out of his depth. Apart from the fact that he's not wearing his trench coat, he looks inconspicuous. There's not a hair on his head out of place. His eyes wander from Castiel flitting around the kitchen to Sam's broad, hunched shoulders.
He wanted to be relieved because he no longer had to watch as Sam and Castiel grew closer by the day.
. We're just friends." He's thinking about saying "I don't swing that way" but decides against it. It's an unnecessarily lie, even though he once believed it to be true. It's irrelevant to the discussion at hand and needlessly defensive.
Castiel puts his hand on the door knob, and then seems to reconsider. He darts forward to wrap his arms around Sam's middle. "Is this okay?" He asks after a beat.
It wasn't the first time that the goddamn volcano that was boiling right under them had spewed up hot steam. It wasn't the first time they'd continued as if nothing had happened.
He thinks that even right now, if Dean were to ask him again, he’d still say yes. At least he knows it’s wrong.
Sam rubs his forehead. He's not completely sure why he's struggling for words now. Castiel has seen these kind of thoughts in his head before. Talking about it out shouldn't be this hard.
"Yup." Dean opens the coke and takes a swig. "He described that thing in detail to us. White, wide-eyed and, uh, apparently with rattling chain around his ankle. Said at first he was really excited when he appeared to him in the kitchen."
"Well, and then the typical 'My father is much stronger than yours' insults continued until they starting fighting about their own strength.“ By now they had reached the living room. Cas nodded to them as Garth stood up and greeted Dean with a firm hug.
"I wanna talk. I really do," Sam says. A part of him wants nothing more than pouring his guts out to Castiel, but the thought also sets him into panic mode. "Just not now, okay? Let’s just focus on the case first. I don’t want our heads to be somewhere else right now."
At the dinner table, Sam stared at the noodle and chickpea stew in his bowl for a while. Then he looked up and watched Charlie shovel the food inside her mouth without a pause to breathe.
"That is not why I was asking.” Sam tugged on his T-shirt. "I was just thinking about, well, going out myself. And I wanted to be back by the time you guys return.”
"No, really. I'm sorry." Sam turns towards him, an apologetic smile on his lips. "About earlier. I shouldn’t have jumped to conclusions like that."
"Dean, no. I'm-” Sam rubbed over his forehead as if he had a tension headache. "I'm glad you're here. I really am."
"Everything's fine, Charlie. Calm down." Sam continued to hold her tightly so that her crying grew louder and angrier.
"You've made your heterosexuality loud in clear in several instances. I remember you saying, you were not "into that kind of thing" numerous times."
"We should be able talk about this like grownups," Sam says, despite what he’s feeling. Which is a lot less civil. "The thing appeared as Cas to you, and we both know what that means. You lied to me. Repeatedly. I don't know if you're doing this for my benefit or your own, but it sucks! You know how that makes me feel? I'm not a freaking pawn in your… whatever, your stupid game! I know it's hard for you to accept your feelings and I know how denial works with you, but damn it, Dean! I'm not going to sit here and watch this whole will-they-won't-they shit!"
"I know you, Sam," Castiel says, all gravel-voiced, not allowing for any contradiction. "I know your soul."
Parked in front of the house now, before they step onto the neatly trimmed lawn. Dean’s straightening Castiel’s tie, telling him he'll be fine if he follows his lead and lets him do the talking.
"You need to tell me, if he returns back." Castiel slowly brushes the hair from Sam's face and tugs it behind his ear. "Tell me the moment you see him or hear him or you feel he's guiding your actions in any other way." He rests his hand at the crook of Sam's neck. "You have to trust me." He hesitates. "You have to trust me or I don't know if I can do right by you."
For a moment he considered explaining to Charlie why Sam had wanted to give her away, but it would feel like stabbing his brother in the back. This here was private enough. There were things that weren’t his to explain.
Sam realizes he's sitting in a diner. He's not sure how he got here. He doesn't remember getting out of the car, but he must have.
Dean’s pretty sure Sam wouldn’t react as well if it were him cradling him in his arms instead of Cas. He wonders if he’d get him to snap out of it at all.
Castiel halts and looks up into the air. He thinks about this for an absurdly long time. "I would not be indifferent to it."
Dean considers walking away, setting down somewhere else in the bar or just leaving. He doesn't. He drinks and watches the waitress as she cleans some glasses, her back turned to them.
It's only when Sam checks the police records of the past year, and bothers to compare them with the one of the year before, that a pattern catches his eyes. "Check it out," he calls Castiel over, surprised by his sudden excitement once he’s certain. "There is a subtle but statistically significant spike across most crimes for several weeks in one place before it drops again and turns up in another place. Petty crime and theft mostly, but even manslaughter. The intervals appear to be random." He waits until Castiel stands behind him and leans over his shoulder to peek at the laptop. "Although something tells me they might not be random at all and I just don’t see it yet."
"I know you don't want to upset your brother. But don't you think that our daughter's well-being is more important than his irrational jealousy?"
"The hallucination was... a lot of the things he said were about you. About us. I just felt like I needed to get away from that stuff and not let it get between us. Does that make sense?"
"Sam." Castiel reached across the table and put his hand on his. "Rest assured. You are a wonderful father."
When they reached the bunker, it was well past midnight. At some point Charlie had fallen asleep in the back seat.
If Castiel's trench coat hadn't still been lying forgotten on the floor, he could almost have convinced himself that he had imagined it all.
Throughout the ride home Sam feels trapped —in the car, in this traitorous body of his, and between all the unspoken.
When they broke apart Dean bowed his head and looked at him carefully from under his lashes. "Are you sure you're okay? I mean.. physically?"
He remembers when he stopped fighting, even though it was so long ago. It feels childish now that he ever tried.
"What happened?" He shoves himself fully up and comes to sit next to Castiel, who doesn’t look fine at all.
"So, just one last time," Dean says, trying to ignore the tugging in his abdomen. "You’re sure you’re safe? No angels on your heels?"
Sam mostly remembers the way Dean reacted as if they were intruding. He couldn't figure out if he was upset about Akiko's presence or whether it was something else.
Sam looked good. Sanguine. Not a day older than when he had died - only a lot healthier and with more color in his face. Castiel stood next to him, holding his hand.
"I wanted to apologize," Castiel said. "Our earlier conversation was interrupted before I could adequately explain myself."
But it’s practical to share a motel room when they’re hunting, he tells himself, trying not to take it as a slight. Besides, Sam has to admit, that maybe there’s even something weirdly gratifying about having Dean in the room when Castiel lies down next to him at night.
The dread that fills Dean is instant and overpowering. He's going to lose Sam. It's actually going to happen. After all these years, he's finally slipping out of his grip again.
Sam runs his fingers over the hand over his abdomen, strokes over each knuckle. Every move is an effort.
It shouldn't surprise Sam that Dean knows this. Of course, Castiel would have figured it out and told Dean. Sam presses his lips together.
When Sam enters the kitchen 15 minutes later, his hair is still wet and he's barefoot, but he's wearing a new pair of jeans and a red flannel.
Sam draws Castiel’s face closer and asks again, pushes their lips together, just to make sure that he understood him right this time.
It would have been too simple to say that he regretted breaking up with Castiel. In his head he had repeated the scene so many times. And the truth was: he hadn't really meant to break up with Castiel in the first place. Not permanently anyway. He had never expected it to stick. He'd not really thought that Castiel would just accept the finality of it and would leave Dean be. And instead spend his time with Sam in Seattle.
Very slowly, Castiel lies down next to him, on his side. He puts a hand onto Sam's stomach and doesn't say anything.
"I believe a chosen family can hold even more significance than one determined purely by blood lines."
"I still think the therapist's our clue. Why would they cluster there if she wasn't? I believe that she's got no idea what's going on but she's the one connecting everything."
Hundreds of pens in different colors and styles lay on the floor in his room. The wooden box pushed to the edge of the room was empty.
Sam forces himself to speak the next words even though he hates it. "I'm trying to say that you don't have to try and find the fault in you, if you're unsure about this. I understand if this is too much for you."
Castiel followed Sam wordlessly to the house. When they opened the door, Sam immediately noticed the bright lights. As it turned out, Dean wasn't asleep anymore.
"Because coffee is more than the sum of its parts to him. It's not simply food or a drink." Castiel seems not the least threatened by the edge in Dean's voice. "Of course-" here he gives Sam a quick look, "he's aware of its nutritional make up, but he’s placed it in a different category. Food is a hassle, something to get through because one must. There are some other exceptions besides coffee, some food laden with positive memories, and meals he associates with carefree and fun experiences."
"It’s probably something to do with Hell and atonement," he finally says. "Anyway. I need a coffee before we can leave. You guys want anything?"
Dean went over to one of the other steel tables where a young woman was lying, her throat slit. When he opened her jaw and touched the gums, a row of sharp teeth appeared.
"Um, how about: I don't care about their crap? It's not fair for them to change my plans at the last minute? I'm almost sixteen? They would both prefer to be alone without me anyway?"
"Have you heard of the hunter again?" Castiel asks out of nowhere. Sam turns his head, not sure who Castiel is addressing. "The one that helped you last week? Did you call her?"
Dean takes out a pen and circles a small mention about a former employee at a high school a few towns away, kitchen staff, who claims to have been attacked by a ghost. It sounds far-fetched, but it’s the first thing that sounds vaguely supernatural at all.
"Aw, cute, sass. Keep it up." The smell of sulfur gets stronger as he leans in. "You know you miss me, but you don’t know why. I think it’s partially ‘cause I’m actually nicer to you than you are."
Jody's beside him on the couch in seconds. There's a warm hand on Dean's shoulder. He can't even remember the last time someone touched him like this. A touch that doesn't elicit strange feelings or desires, with no ulterior motives.
Castiel hung up. He felt how much his body had reacted to the call; his vessel's heart was pounding uncomfortably.
Even Sally was having a bad day. She was lying in her bed staring at the ceiling instead of meeting him in the common room as she usually did.
Sam ran a hand over his face. Then he looked at Castiel, who couldn’t have looked more guilty if he tried, and Dean, whose poker face was pretty good.
"I had to convince my boss you're really police. You are, right?" He assures her she is. "You can call my precinct if you want," he offers, but she quickly shakes her head, her dark hair framing her face. She has the front desk laptop with her. She sits down next to him on the end of the bed, puts the laptop on her knees so he can get a good look at the screen.
"I don't understand why Sam would feel embarrassed about this." Castiel looks hurt. "He is not responsible for Jody's misconceptions."
to be bothered with it." Castiel says, in a firm voice. "I want to know these things. I told you as much before."
He thinks he can see it in Sam's body, too. He's more relaxed around him. His shoulders are less hunched. He smiles more. At Dean, too. Or at least, Sam's smiles don’t drop when he’s around. Whatever. Pretty much the same thing. It feels good. Proof that he's acing the "taking care of Sam" thing.
She sighed. Her blue dress swirled up as she turned around to face the crowd, the people with whom she would have preferred to celebrate her wedding rather than being squeezed and questioned by her father. Dean had asked about the choice of color. She had answered that she definitely didn’t want to get married dressed in a snow-white sheet that made her look like a virgin or the epitome of an angel cliché. Sam had been glad that Castiel hadn’t been there to hear it. It was quite possible that he’d have taken the comment the wrong way.
"Well, little monster, come here, it's time for bed." She put her arms up to him so that he could easily lift her out of the chair. "Daddy still loves you very much, okay?"
Castiel's hand wanders to his belt, and he watches Sam face so intently, it sets something off in Sam. He's not some delicate thing that needs to be handled with care. The irritation turns his movements swift and he undresses with a sense of urgency. Down to their underwear, Sam shoves Castiel back against the bed, where he falls back into the mattress.
"Heaven is not where you belong," Sam said softly, running his hand through her hair. "You can choose yourself where you belong."
The pizza had started to taste stale then and later when Castiel had grabbed his hand on the way out, Sam had only pressed back briefly, given him an apologetic look, and stuffed his hands inside the pockets of his jacket.
It’s just… the way Sam talked about it. Like a drunken mistake he wasn’t proud of, not like torture.
Sam did not answer. He sat up and looked out of the window. Because there was so little space, he didn’t even have to get up from the couch to do so. Individual windows glowed brightly in the houses on the other side of the street.
"I would really like to but I don't have time. I have to hurry." Dean sighed and then turned his body so that Sam had to look him in the eye. "I wish I had enough time to break this to you gently but none of this is real."
"No. That's obviously not going to happen. But if you really want to go and buy a farm, you should maybe just go for it."
Castiel seems like he's about to protest, so Dean grabs him by the lapel and pulls him into the building.
Castiel turned away, but Dean grabbed his wrist and leaned closer. "What is it that you don't want to tell me?"
"He took the drugs, put a noose around his head, hung himself, and died of the overdose while hanging there."
They still need glasses, but Dean doesn't want to waste the few minutes they get to talk in private on the possibility of Sam overhearing them. First there's lunch and then the long drive with Sam and it will be difficult to get Castiel on his own in the bunker, too.
That's a funny way to phrase it. It's not like there's usually any opportunity for Sam's texts to go unanswered. Not when he and Castiel are always joined at the hip.
Dean looked past him into the room. It was full of giggling girls, putting their heads together and playing with their long hair, but none of them were his niece.
It was absurd that he felt sorry for him Castiel just then. It was an automatism that he had adopted in recent years. If Castiel was sad, it didn't take long for Charlie to feel sad too, and if Charlie was sad, Sam never felt quite right. So really, it was a self-preserving impulse.
He didn't want to imagine what would have happened if Dean hadn't been there for Charlie. It had been him who got her to speak for the first time after Sam's death. Who got her to eat again and to laugh.
He knew it was a strange topic to talk to Castiel about, but who else was he going to talk to? Who else, when Castiel was the only real friend he had, and the only person who was an integral part of his life besides Dean and Charlie. He had to be able to talk to someone about something without it being a big thing.
"They wouldn't even let her into the cinema. Even if they did, I certainly don't want to sit through some French sex scenes with her."
"I’m texting some angels. We opened a chat group called 'Seven Steps to the Apocalypse’.” When she noticed how pale and frozen Castiel was, she rolled her eyes, annoyed. "God, Dad! Have you never heard of sarcasm before? I'm texting Lila."
Sam's eyes didn't betray what he was thinking. Her expression was completely neutral. »He's great. Don't worry, I like him.«
"Oh, I almost forgot about the pie." Sam bent down for the tote bag that stood next to the table. "I hope you still like cherry?"
He hears voices outside the door. It takes him a second to recognize them. He only catches the last words of Castiel’s sentence. Dean laughs in response, as he opens the door and lets more sunshine in.
"The cracks of society. They were all scum. People nobody really misses." He laughed. "We still don’t know the identity of three of them and the others were runaways or dropouts who’d disappeared years ago."
"If you’re telling the truth, where is she now?" he spat. "How can I be sure that she is really fine? Why would I trust you, when you've been killing nephilims for centuries?"
"No, of course not." Sam raised her arms in confusion. "What's up with all the questions? How did you get from sending her to school to his?“
Sam knows it. He just needed to make sure it’s the “my best friend and my brother aren’t giving me their undivided attention anymore”-not okay, and not the other kind.
It was better if Dean got rid of his energy than if he was angry, and yet a lot of the situation felt wrong. Castiel was looking for a resolution to the anger he still felt, but he wasn't sure if he would find it in Dean's hands sliding clothes off his hips until he was bared naked.
He drags himself up into a sitting position and puts his feet firmly onto the ground, taking stock of the situation. He's only wearing boxer shorts. Someone must have helped him undress last night, although he doesn't recall.
"I don't think there's anyone better out there." Dean's lips are wet enough, there's no need to keep sliding his tongue over them, yet he does it. "You're perfect." Dean bites down on his lower lip and dares himself to cast a glance at Cas, to gauge his reaction. "You're perfect for each other."
"No problem. If I'm lucky she won't wake up and you can talk to Castiel about... whatever it is that went down today."
