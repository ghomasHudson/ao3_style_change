caricatured as a programme, in one scene – and it’s horrible.
that represent Sherlock’s deepest repression, in this case the morphine that he uses to mask the pain. Having Janine be the one who is fucking with the taps simply makes the link clearer, particularly when we might not associate hospital drugs with the other kind of drugs that Sherlock normally takes to take the pain away – however, it’s clear that the drugs that anaesthesise his pain do the same job as Janine – hide his queerness. Janine turned vindictive causes him intense pain, and he needs to turn back to the drugs to slip back under. Bearding was always temporary in this show, at least for Sherlock; drug abuse is a consistent problem and becomes a running metaphor for Sherlock’s repression in the EMP.
Rosie was fast asleep in John’s arms, breathing lightly, and as Judy Garland crooned out a Christmas tune to the child in her arms, Sherlock leant over to brush the soft blonde hairs on Rosie’s head with his thumb. John had never seen him behave with such tenderness. Sherlock’s hand brushed gently over his where he was cradling Rosie’s head, his ridged, calloused fingers from years of playing the violin touching on John’s smoother fingers.

, I really recommend it – it’s often cited as the best film of the last 20 years, and watching it really helps to see where TAB came from and the genre it’s operating in. David Lynch is one of the only directors to do the dream-exploration-of-the-psyche well, and I maintain that a lot of the fuckiness in the fourth series draws on Lynch. However, what I actually want to point out about
Drowning in the Mind Palace. Here we are, back where we started. Sherlock might be thinking about the case of Charlie, but he’s actually reflecting on that world we saw in the promo photos, where he’s struggling to stay alive in his brain. Notice that this isn’t just a split shot, it’s specifically a mirror, so we’re meant to focus on this episode as an act of reflection. There are great parallels between Sherlock and the Charlie case which you can find here (
What, then, is going on here? Sherlock is told by MP!Jim that John is in danger – and then imagines he wakes up. In his MP, Janine appears, puts him in pain and puts him back under. She, then, is the reason he can’t wake up. Janine has been Sherlock’s beard, and it’s quite possible to read her as being a symbol of Sherlock’s repression, but I think that’s a simplification; discounting TAB, Janine doesn’t appear again, and even then it’s minimal, whereas s4 is literally built around the concept of repression. As I go into in a lot more detail in chapter 9 (X), which is about the use of drugs to mask our darkest secrets in TLD, it’s
This chapter has a CN for death (although to be fair, the whole meta does) – it’s analysing the literal peaks and troughs (height is important in this episode) that Sherlock goes through in order to look at how close he is to dying throughout.
But this year was her first Christmas, and Sherlock wanted that to be special for her.
And so, with Mummy’s words bubbling in the back of his brain and John’s in the forefront, he had lashed out at John the previous night, thrown John’s brutal honesty straight back at him, and John had simply walked out. Sherlock had not known what to make of that. They were John’s own words, after all. But after a few hours he had returned, and the evening at Baker Street had been marked by an uneasy silence. John was normally quite direct about personal matters, but he had been silent for so long, uttering only a few brusque and functional words, that Sherlock suspected it was on him to apologise, even though it was John who had wounded him.
- but Sherlock’s mind turning that beard back on himself to mock him? Absolutely makes sense. Remember, this is the loathing that pushes him back into the deep coma – this scene is really pivotal.

John leant over Sherlock’s shoulder, gently resting on the arm of his chair. “You do wind people up.”
) – essentially, Charlie and Carl Powers from TGG are mirrors for one another both in their names and in the manner they die (a fit in a tight place, basically). Carl Powers is already a mirror for Sherlock – obsessively targeted by Jim for being the best at what he does. Charlie mirrors Sherlock through their shared trip to Tibet (dreamscape alert) and, we think, through the metatextual link of the blue power ranger. In case you hadn’t spotted it, Powers links back to that too – probably coincidence, but a nice one nevertheless. Carl Powers’s death is by drowning, which we shouldn’t ignore in an episode as loaded with ideas about drowning in the mind palace. The fact that the mirror reflects drowning Baker Street aesthetics should make us think that Charlie is asking us to reflect on Carl Powers’s death, but also on Sherlock’s own – already fatally injured (by a fit or by Mary), he is going to die smothered, unable to cry for help (in a swimming pool/carseat costume (?!)/mind palace). The idea that none of these people could cry for help is particularly poignant because so much of series 4 is about Sherlock being unable to voice his own identity, and as we’ll see once he’s able to do that, that may give him the impetus to escape his death. Think of ‘John Watson is definitely in danger’ back in HLV.
This, however, all takes place in Sherlock’s brain. In several scenes, we’ve had Sherlock engage with two concepts in his mind that he can’t know about; one is Sebastian Moran in
“We’ve imposed ourselves on you for far too long already. I know that. But a couple more months – give Rosie her first Christmas here, that sort of thing – if you can’t, don’t worry. Really. We’ll be fine. There’s plenty of money. Mary, you know. I just thought I’d ask.”
The chapter title comes from the wonderful
“Penny for your thoughts?”
There is more reference than necessary made to dream crabs making one blind, and between Madame Kovarian and the blind Doctor in the later dream episode
John was in a mood. Perhaps he had had a bad day at the surgery, but Sherlock suspected there was more to it. Rosie’s first Christmas, spent without her mother. John’s first spent without Mary. Sherlock could see this knowledge weighing on John in the increasing sag of his shoulders, the dullness in his eyes as he resigned himself to bereavement. Christmas can be a sad time, Mrs. Hudson had warned him as the season approached. Sherlock had nodded, but he had not fully comprehended. He had never lost someone in the way John had.
‘Though the world explode’ is a reference to WW1, which is coming in the final Sherlock Holmes story, and which is symbolised by Eurus – in other chapters, I explain why Eurus and WW1 are united under the concept of ‘winds of change’ in this show. Sherlock and John survive the winds of change – except they don’t move with them. Instead, they stay stuck in 1895, the year of ultimate repression. 2014!Sherlock going back in his head to 1895 and repeating how he met John suggests exactly that, that nothing has changed but the superficial, and that emotionally, he is still stuck in 1895.
[*the South Dublin accent is my accent, so although we hear a half-whispered song for all of five seconds, I’m pretty certain about this]
Eurus, incidentally, comes up here –
(We should also notice that the use of Twitter is important – it underlies a lot of the glib comedy in this episode, with Sherlock later Tweeting #221BringIt (which is so unbelievably queer?). In
Sherlock describes predestination as like a spider’s web and like mathematics – both of these are to do with Moriarty. In the original stories, Moriarty is a mathematician, and one of the most famous lines from both the stories and the show describes Moriarty as a spider. This predestined future is one that Sherlock doesn’t like – Mycroft points out that predestination ends in death, which is what Sherlock is trying to avoid in this episode, and although Moriarty is never mentioned explicitly, his inflection here suggests that Sherlock is thinking about John subconsciously, without even understanding it. The Samarra discussion brings us back to the question of Sherlock’s death, and links it in with the deep waters of the mind he’s currently drowning in – the pirate imagery becomes really important here, because a pirate is someone who stays alive on the high seas and fights against them. The merchant of Samarra becoming a pirate is not merely a joke about a little boy, it’s a point about fighting for survival – and how will Sherlock later fight for survival? We’ll see him battle Eurus (his trauma, more on that later) head on, literally describing himself as a pirate. Fantastic stuff.

“Sher-lock, Rosie.”
John’s breathing quickened; he wetted his lips, and Sherlock saw the nervousness in the tautness of his jaw. Perhaps he had been more obvious than he thought – perhaps John had seen through him a long time ago. But he had begun, and God help him he was going to finish.
Sherlock was not a part of that life; Sherlock knew that he was a reminder that those things could never be. And so Sherlock hung back, claiming to be busy, although he knew that John knew he was not. He had said he would see them at the gates to the cemetery. And here he was, collar up against the biting wind, scarf firmly tucked into his coat, waiting.
Is that right, Mary? Could you be alright with this?
Casting the same actor to play dream merchants, knocking characters unconscious and altering their memories and psyches? The universe is rarely so lazy. Other mirrors in this episode are easy to pull out. The Doctor and Sherlock have long been read as mirrors for each other – characters who have existed for a long time and are constantly evolving through adaptation, super-intelligent loners, but in case that wasn’t obvious, Moffat went to a reasonable effort to style them very similarly when both tenures began.
A lump rose in John’s throat, and he simply shook his head, not trusting himself to speak all of a sudden. He turned quickly to attend to Rosie, hoping Molly would not notice his emotion.
about how water represents Sherlock sinking deeper and deeper into his own subconsciousness – this is the deepest he can go. In Greek mythology, Eurus was the name of the wind most associated with causing storms at sea
And then, on return, Sherlock had sulked. It had been a day, which had not been totally unusual for Sherlock before Rosie, but was now ringing alarm bells in John’s brain. Before Rosie, Sherlock had frequently lapsed into sullen silences lasting several days, but his most antisocial habits had diminished now that he was sharing his home with a father and daughter, something that John suspected had taken considerable effort.
He had not forgotten the importance of the day, exactly, but he had not imagined it like this. In his mind’s eye, he had seen himself accompanying John and Rosie to the church, holding Rosie and soothing her to give John the space to mourn and even pray. He did not think Mary would have minded that. And then, perhaps, on the cab ride home, placing his hand on John’s, giving him a touch of warmth, letting him know that it would all be okay. That had been his childish fantasy. He hoped that Mary would not have minded that, either. He had always suspected that she had known.
TAB specifically deals with the question of those excluded from a Victorian narrative. This is specifically tied into to those who are excluded from the stories, such as Jane and Mrs. Hudson. Mrs. Hudson’s complaint is in the same scene as John telling her and Sherlock to blame the problems on the illustrator. This ties back to the deerstalker metaphor which is so prevalent in this episode; something that’s not in the stories at all, but a façade by which Holmes is universally recognised and which as previously referenced masks his queerness. Women, then, are not the only people being excluded from the narrative. When Mycroft tells us that the women have to win, he’s also talking about queer people. This is a war that we must lose.

in your chapter title?
Amo. Love, Smallwood’s code name, stopped him from realising it was Norbury, and by extension it’s what stopped him from realising Mary’s true self earlier – love was clouding his judgement. There is more, however. The fact that ‘ammo’ and ‘amo’ are so similar is brilliant, because they mean total opposites – ammo is to do with war, and amo is love. When it comes to the problem of being shot, of knowing that John is in danger but not quite understanding how, Sherlock has been focusing on the threat from ‘ammo’ for too long, hypothesising Mary as some kind of super dangerous villain. This isn’t what’s endangering John. What’s endangering John is ‘amo’ – without Sherlock, John is suicidal, and so it is love that is the ultimate danger. The mistake that Ajay made (ammo) is the same mistake that Sherlock has been making in hypothesising about Mary throughout the episode. Another point worth noting is that gay slang – the early 20
Other moments in this scene are lovely – Sherlock is continually distorted by a mirror on the wall, reminding us that this is him trying to process the hypotheses he is running about Mary in his brain. This brain, as previously mentioned, is under siege, and it’s important then that Mycroft and Sherlock both acknowledge that Sherlock and sentiment are becoming one and the same; TFP is going to be about the brain and the heart learning to work together, rather than against one another, but Mycroft’s disparagement and the underground dungeon he’s living in show that we’re not there just yet.
John felt his nose wrinkle inadvertently. Although he had the money for it now, he did not like the idea of private school. Sherlock laughed, and John belatedly realised that of course Sherlock would have been to one, probably all the way up from babyhood. “Sorry. Just not my cup of tea.”
We remember from TAB that Sherlock sees himself as cleverer through John’s eyes, and the reasonably sympathetic portrayal we get in TAB we can probably put down to this attempt at understanding himself from the outside. The water in TST is showing us that we’re going in, and the sad thing is that this is almost definitely how Sherlock has come to perceive himself, but just like Siri he doesn’t truly recognise it. It’s also worth noting here the emphasis placed on God in godfather and later the deliberate mentions of Christianity at the Christening – there is also a tuning out of a culture he can’t really align himself with here, which is more important when we think about the fact that this character has been around since the 19
John gulped slightly. Sherlock felt all the hairs on the back of his neck standing on end. John Watson was never lost for words. Sherlock looked to his deep brown eyes, the eyes which he normally avoided because always caused that slight familiar pang in his chest, and met John’s gaze. John seemed to lose his nerve somehow, taking half a step back from Sherlock and breaking their eye contact.
And as John looked it him, it was as though the bottom dropped out of his stomach, as though he began to spiral infinitely into an abyss he had not realised he had been staving off, because it was then that he realised that he loved him.
We then cut back to Sherlock thinking whilst Lestrade tells him more about the case – what is bizarre here, is that John and Lestrade are clearly visible through what can only be described as a rearview mirror attached to the side of Sherlock’s head. If
I confess that Mary’s travel montage bores me somewhat, although I’m tempted someday to go through all the graffiti and montages with a fine tooth comb to see if anything can be come up with. I am, however, running out of time to write this before term starts for me! Let’s jump onto the idea that not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of the dice. The theme of Sherlock being able to predict the future comes up a few times in this episode, and I’ve mentioned before how this is a set up for us to doubt the premise of TLD, that he suddenly has quasi-magic predictive powers. Here, he seems to, and then it is immediately undercut, because he says that he placed a tracker inside the memory stick. All very funny – except it doesn’t make sense. I confess I didn’t notice this, but my mum did straight away – if you have a tracker, you can follow someone, but you can’t arrive somewhere before them. It’s not possible. This is an aspect of Sherlock’s predictive power that doesn’t make sense – and we might be able to just about buy it on his ‘mathematical probability’ shtick, except he’s just told us that that’s a load of rubbish. This leaves us in a situation that is impossible – and isn’t too much of a problem, because it’s just a device, but is a huge setup for the impossibility of the next episode. It also speaks to a dreamscape again, because where else are you exactly where you need to be when you need to be there, with no explanation?
Sherlock shrugged. “Christmas films are dreadful. It’s one of the good ones.”
– it should be noted that the concept of EMP theory appeared way before the superficial shitshow that was series 4, so it was not invented as a fix-it – far from it!
A very funny film – with a very apt title for this chapter!! If you haven’t read the first half of the TST meta, check the previous chapter – we’re jumping straight back in.
Sherlock announces that he has found the black pearl of the Borgias, but of course he hasn’t – it’s the AGRA memory stick. Importantly, the original story ends with the black pearl, so we’re tying back in to the expectation that has been latently set by Craig; here, the show is diverging from canon, and Sherlock doesn’t know what to do about it – his declaration that it’s not possible is literal. This scene gives a perfect parallel to the one in TAB where he attempts to unmask Lady Carmichael only to find Moriarty – he was missing the obvious. Here, we’ve seen already in this episode the serious miscalculation he has made about Moriarty in his brain; he is still treating the Moriarty threat as one of a supervillain. Stealing jewels is something we associate with Moriarty from TRF, but that moment is high camp – it’s the end of the episode between John and Sherlock which is the emotional crux. If we’re focusing on what Jim means in himself, we’re missing the point – and it’s exactly the same here. Sherlock needs to reconceptualise Jim as his fear of losing John, and this is the moment when his brain connects this properly to Mary. Bear in mind that everything that happens after Sherlock is shot in HLV takes place within the EMP, so we know nothing about Mary in reality. The AGRA memory stick doesn’t represent who Mary genuinely is – it represents the great unknown of Mary, the question mark over her head. Never forget, after all, that the original AGRA box from the stories was empty. It’s the same here – our divergence into Mary’s past is untrue. When Sherlock realises that Moriarty is somehow to do with the memory stick, he is realising that his fear of John dying is tied into his confrontation with Mary back in 2014 (!). This moment of realisation drives the rest of the episode to Mary’s death scene, where Sherlock relives his own attempted assassination by Mary (as we’ll see) – this is what he has to figure out. If we need more impetus to realise that what happens in HLV post shooting is wrong, look at Sherlock’s flashback to John and Mary’s reunion in HLV – if we take this show at face value, that simply can’t be right, because Sherlock wasn’t there. The only way to read this is if such a scene took place in Sherlock’s own brain – a kind of fill in the blanks as he tried to excuse Mary, only now realising that she is, in fact, the most serious threat of all.

Jack Sandiford’s home in Reading could not be talking more about water – Arwel has really excelled himself here. Not only do we have a swimming pool and a Hokusai, but look at the ceiling – I have never seen a ceiling reflect water quite like that. I don’t know if it’s a mirror (!) or another visual effect, but it serves to remind us of where we are – the water is not just below us, but all around. It’s not a case of taking the plunge – we are still drowning.
[There’s a fantastic framing of Sherlock here between two portraits, a man and a woman, seemingly ancestral – I would love to know more about these, because if I know Arwel they’re significant, and the way they hang over Sherlock is really metaphorically suggestive. If anyone has any info on that, it looks like a really good avenue to explore.]
Before digging into the episode, I want to take a brief diversion to talk about one of my favourite films,
John never hugged, that was normally true. But there was something different in this moment.
“What’s wrong?”
This isn’t just the show trying to remind us of what John was like in ASiP, however. MP!Eurus is the trauma prodding Sherlock’s sexuality – it’s going to be hell to get through it, but he absolutely needs to do it. This is Sherlock’s trauma, not reminding him that John was suicidal, but forcing him to acknowledge it in the first place, something which Sherlock has buried. We know this because of the way the image of John forces its way into Sherlock’s mind – it’s much like the way Moriarty breaks into TAB. His brain is making a connection that he’s not quite capable of making and it’s knocking him. His deduction that Faith!Eurus is suicidal is accompanied by that image of John, and he then re-enacts the food ritual he completed with John the evening John left his cane behind, before throwing Faith!Eurus’s gun into the Thames – proving that it was Sherlock himself who stopped John from taking his own life.

Misinterpreting John’s silence, Sherlock stumbled over his words. “Just – hypothetically. Not that Rosie will go there. That’s just as an example. I don’t want you to think –“
But instead, that morning, seeing John swaddle Rosie to protect her against the cold, the intimacy of that father and daughter moment, a panic had set in to the pit of his stomach and he had fumbled for an excuse. Some moments were too precious to be spoiled. And it was a time, after all, for Mary. He had all Christmas with them; and if John ever needed Sherlock, he must have known that he was always there.
Only the previous week he had walked past the open shop front of a Hamley’s, glittering with Christmas promise. He had never looked twice in one of them before, but he had been awed this year. He imagined Rosie faced with such splendour. He knew, of course, that to a child under a year old it doesn’t matter whether the toys are Hamley’s or hand-me-downs. And yet.
She’s not your daughter.
If you haven’t seen the music video for
“I’ll take her, Sherlock – you’ve got a case.”
He closed the laptop. He would need to talk to Sherlock about it, of course. It wasn’t fair to impose an infant on anyone for too long. But maybe – just maybe – he could stay at Baker Street for a little longer.
She would always be there with them on some level, Sherlock knew that. Such people do not just disappear. But seeing John there playing in front of the Christmas tree with his daughter, Sherlock could not help but deduce. John’s neck muscles, which had seemed permanently tight with strain, were relaxed. The hollow tautness of his cheeks had filled out in the last month, and the circles under his eyes which at one stage had resembled charcoal seemed to have been brushed away by time. His brow, once permanently furrowed, was still lined and worn, unmistakeably changed by Mary’s death, but today it was loose, even carefree. It was the first day he was not carrying her any longer. Not a day would go by when Mary would not enter John’s mind, Sherlock knew that. But it was mid-afternoon, and he wondered if she had yet. John would never forget her, and nor should he. But he was moving on.
“She-wock.”
The excuse about Mrs. Hudson suddenly felt paltry, not to mention unnecessary. Sherlock nodded, desperately aware of the colour in his cheeks. “For Rosie,” he added belatedly, hurriedly.

John nodded. Yes. Of course he did. Still, it was a reminder to him that time was beating on, and he not heeding it.
“Yeah, of course.” Sherlock felt the heat burn behind his eyes, and desperately blinked it back. John continued. “It’s just that – I haven’t found anywhere good. Yet. I mean, I will, I know I will, but I guess…” John tailed off, but those words lit a spark in the centre of Sherlock’s chest. He didn’t dare to hope, and yet –

Sherlock looked over John’s shoulder. “Meet Me in St. Louis. Some children try to commit mass murder. It’s glossed over though.” John looked over at him, worried. “Honestly. It’s appropriate, I swear. Not just because I’m accustomed to serial killings. Plus, she won’t remember anyway.” He placed the pile of quilts he had borrowed from Mrs. Hudson at John’s feet and started to arrange them. “Plus, it’s actually quite good,” he added begrudgingly. “Daddy always used to make us watch it at Christmas. Mycroft hates it. I pretended to hate it too for ages. Daddy would kill me if he knew I was voluntarily watching it, the fight Mycroft and I used to put up.”
“Sherlock. Can we talk?”
TFP and what this might mean, which will help us to understand who she is once we have stripped off the disguises.
Something that’s interesting here, is that there is a real shift away from the implications of the dummy in acd canon. In acd canon, Moran attempts to murder Holmes, which is a way of catching him in the act and sending him to prison. This is about catching Mary in the act in a similar sense, but it’s about being caught by John. This is interesting, because it shows that Sherlock’s priorities have shifted from acd canon – or, more accurately, we’re seeing the priorities that weren’t reported in the Strand. The emotional impact on John is far more important than the legal ramifications – and this in itself is the shift which the creators have been pretty emphatic about taking from the original stories.
Others have pointed out the fantastic projector visual that we get next, as though implying that the whole Aquarium scene is a projection from Sherlock’s mind – it’s important to hint here to the audience that Mary is of course not dead, although because of the reception of series 4 I’m not sure that was entirely grasped! Mary’s coffin is then engulfed in blue flames, in case we weren’t encumbered enough in blue, but there’s also a sense of failure in this. Every time we get that level of blue, waves or fire, engulfing like it so often does in this episode, we’re sinking deeper into the subconscious rather than rising out of it. It’s a hint that something has gone terribly wrong, which is only increased at the end of the episode with the notorious final image of Sherlock drowning. We’re not on our way up here, and we aren’t going to be until the final third of TFP – until then, we have a constant aesthetic of descent into the mind.
(Ecclesiastes)
Nick Frost’s appearance as Father Christmas gave us all a good laugh, but he was also used as the indicator that the world we were perceiving was a dream world. This was made a bit of a joke of early in the episode – in a sci-fi world like this, are we seriously looking for what’s not realistic as the code to crack the dream? The exact same joke is made in
“Hacked into. MI5. Their security is paltry, really. It’s a surprise London doesn’t fall victim to terror attacks more often.”
Before then, he had begun to kid himself that he perhaps had a chance. The future had seemed hazy; he was no longer foolish enough to imagine a halcyon daydream of love and affection. But a future together, as a kind of family sharing some kind of love; he had hoped for that. It had all seemed possible until John had spoken those words.
And yet.
What’s really striking is that John has brought his gun to Christmas lunch, however. Bear in mind John-being-suicidal is the realisation that Sherlock is going to come to in TLD, but it’s prefigured here. We haven’t seen John’s gun since ASiP, when it was used to indicate that he was suicidal. It’s suddenly come back, but Sherlock misses its significance – he expects John to have it, but he doesn’t focus on the significance of the gun itself. He’s still thinking in terms of Mary and Magnussen. What’s significant is that John throws him the coat, which has the gun weighing down in its pocket. This prefigures

John felt a lump form in his throat. He had made a terrible error. He had not wanted it to be this way. He had wanted to talk to Sherlock properly, as an adult, to explain his feelings and if necessary apologise for them, to offer Sherlock a fair choice. And instead of offering Sherlock a chance to respond to him, John had floored him, crossed lines that weren’t meant to be crossed. He stepped back, the room swaying around him. Perhaps he had drunk more than he thought. He suspected, however, that the nausea rising in his system had nothing to do with the alcohol. Mumbling incoherently, he excused himself. Sherlock did not speak a word as he went.
is the idea of predictability. Way before we know that this is the Doctor’s dream, the Doctor displays a remarkable ability to finish what the Eknodines say before they do, an ability which becomes an obvious hint in hindsight. Moving over to TLD, Sherlock has similarly ridiculous powers to predict what other people will do; because this underpins TLD, it jumps out as being something that rings very false to me, almost like a parody of who Sherlock Holmes is meant to be, and so we should pay attention to it. An uncanny ability to predict what others will do – yup, that’s a dream world.
“Da,” Rosie affirmed, and both men starting laughing uncontrollably in a kind of hysterical joy. John kissed Rosie emphatically. “You clever girl. I always said she was clever, didn’t I, Sherlock? Da. You’re brilliant, you are.” A tremendous warmth filled Sherlock, not just on behalf of Rosie this time, but to see John so joyous.

This one is perhaps the most straightforward on a symbolism level, but also possibly the most significant moment in the series. Therapist!Eurus, plain and simple, is Sherlock’s trauma prodding at John, interrogating him like a therapist would, trying to work him out – and largely failing, right? She can get basically nothing about how he feels about Sherlock out of him. But this is part of MP!Eurus’s ongoing project to get Sherlock to wake up – the Gay Trauma is interrogating John, trying to suss him, and failing.

being one of Wilde’s plays. But the Vincent Starrett poem, although nostalgic and ostensibly lovely, for tjlcers and it seems for Sherlock himself symbolises something much more troubling. Do search up the full poem, but for now let’s look at the final couplet.
Sherlock was a part of that, John had to admit to himself. Sherlock had provided a home for John when John had needed it most. He never overstepped the mark – sometimes he seemed terrified of doing so – but he was always quietly there, ready to look after Rosie, to cook, to shop, to do all the domestic things that Sherlock had never deigned to do before. John knew that Sherlock was doing all of these for him. He had not yet been able to thank him. He did not know how. The magnitude of Sherlock’s kindness, and how much it had helped him, was not something that John felt able to express. On bad days, guilt filled his stomach at the thought of Sherlock, sacrificing the mad and wonderful life that he used to live, that they used to live, for him. On better days, it filled him with a warmth, like a rock he could fall back on even when he inevitably wobbled.
Do note, however, the similarly uncomfortable dynamic in both of these photos – hilarious.
The exception, of course, is Ella’s office, which ties into the heaven/ascent theme – it seems as though descent is descent into drowning in thought, but it’s not actually death, whereas death is the abandonment of the EMP project all together, letting it all go to rise up to the sky. I’ve discussed the ascent metaphor in a previous chapter (
Sherlock stiffened. That serious, direct note in John’s voice was one that he dreaded. Their life at 221B for the last few months had not been easy, of course, but having John back had meant that that had not mattered. But Sherlock had lived without him before, and he was all too aware that their existence together was a bubble, one that could pop at any moment. That tone of voice was the tone he had been dreading; the tone that called time. But he had hoped, at least, for one Christmas.
Also, he knew that one day John and Rosie would leave. It was better not to get too attached. For Sherlock, that bridge had long been crossed, but he would rather that Rosie did not experience any separation trauma when the inevitable came.
“Say it again, Rosie. What did you say? Da?”
He lay in bed a few moments longer, listening to John’s faint movements. For another few moments, however, he would bask in the moment that he knew would vanish the moment he arose.
The elephant in the room – that the baby’s not real? Possibly, but not what we normally take it to mean. Rory’s ponytail also has not shaving for Sherlock Holmes vibes, but again it’s not quite concrete in my mind. These little bits at the end aren’t quite tied up, and I would love to hear what people have to say about them. That, however, is for another day! The next chapter in this series will be jumping back into episode-by-episode analysis with TLD – see you there.
A teddy bear, then. Something she could hang onto, remember him by in some way even when she had forgotten him. That would be fine, he told himself, even as his heart sank into his chest.
The first thing that I (and most of my friends) noticed about this scene, however, is that it’s not good. The writing is questionable, to say the least. The serious resolution to the problem of Magnussen’s murder is interrupted by Sherlock tweeting, brotherly bickering, hyperactive and possibly high Sherlock being played for comedy (complete with mock opera). And then, perhaps the worst lines of the show so far:
This is arguably the key to spotting that TAB is a dream long before they tell us – when TAB’s case is early revealed to be a mixture between TRF (Emelia’s suicide) and TGG (the five pips), and we see the opening of ASiP repeated, we should be questioning what on earth is going on. This can also help us to recognise s4 as being EMP as well though – old motifs from the previous series keep repeating through the cases, like alarm bells ringing. Moriarty telling Sherlock that there is nothing new under the sun is his key to understanding that the Emelia case is meant to help him understand what happened to Jim, that it’s a mental allegory or
as it seems on the surface, we would end up with a pretty straight reading of TST – John spends too much time with Sherlock, they’re all in danger, Mary dies and John is suicidal because of it. Broadly speaking, this works – Rory is killed in the dream (with a really nice visual parallel to TST) and Amy crashes a bus and kills herself because she doesn’t want to live without Rory. Amy picks the domestic sphere and although it takes several more series to play out in full, this is broadly the direction the series takes us in.
Sherlock shook his head, finally forming the words that had been forming a lump in his throat. “You haven’t.”
Sherlock hated how right Molly Hooper had been about the magic of Christmas.
Going into the Welsborough house, we get a slip of the tongue from Sherlock which is
John gestured him into the main room, and as he settled into his armchair Sherlock sat awkwardly on his. He could feel a spike of upset rising in his throat and swallowed it down uncomfortably. He eyed John. His jaw was tense, his hand jerking slightly as it always did when he was nervous. Sherlock’s throat constricted slightly. These were signs he did not like to read.
elements into one parodically awful scene. The quick quips that are supposed to be clever and that are so common in Moffat’s dialogue are seen in that moment of dialogue – but the quip isn’t clever anymore, it’s empty. The same catchphrase of ‘the game is on’ comes back, and the quintessential use of technology is referenced in Sherlock’s Twitter account, where again his #OhWhatABeautifulMorning is unfathomably glib. Our Sherlock is also better known than previous adaptations for his drug abuse, and this also gets referenced, but here it gets played for comedy, which is incongruous with the rest of the show – in fact, THoB, HLV and TAB all take it pretty seriously, so to see it played off as a joke is tonally questionable. In other words, here we have
Money was no object. Mary had left him plenty, something that John struggled to get his head around. He did not like to think of how that money had been earned. But he had it nevertheless, and felt no guilt in spending it on his daughter. Yet with every click on yet another property, John felt a dull pang in the pit of his stomach. He did not really want to leave Baker Street. He had not had a proper home before Baker Street; his childhood house could hardly be called a home, and the military that he had fled to as soon as he could was not a stable household either. Baker Street was the first home he had, and he was reluctant to let go of that. Part of it, he knew, was that he did not trust his luck to build another. When they had bought their flat, he had trusted Mary’s homemaking skills; his sense of belonging was much more fragile. He had an equilibrium here, and so did Rosie.
Yet he could not live with this horribly pregnant silence weighing down 221B, and so when John returned from the clinic, Sherlock sidled up to him and placed a miniature chocolate Christmas king in front of him. They had been selling them in Speedy’s when Sherlock had gone down for a watery coffee, and he had bought it on an impulse.
He heard John unlock the door of 221 down below, coming in from the surgery, and suddenly Sherlock’s heart was in his mouth. Sherlock had always been vocal about his hatred for Christmas. John would think something was wrong, that he was overcompensating for Mary’s death – which he was – or trying somehow to muscle in on Rosie’s first Christmas, Rosie and John’s first Christmas together, to make it a Rosie, John and Sherlock Christmas. Maybe he was doing that too. He panicked, and as he heard John ascend the seventeen steps to Baker Street he made a rush to the mantelpiece, unhooking some of the ornamental holly just as John walked through the sitting room door. He felt heat rising in his face as John stood dead still, staring at him holding a piece of verdant plastic, disbelieving.
Don’t mind me, I’m just crying. Basically, Sherlock knows that John is in danger and that’s what pulls him back from the brink – and we know it’s serious, because Mycroft, the
Others have pointed out that when Sherlock falsely deduces that the client’s wife is a spy working for Moriarty, he should really be talking to John – and, in fact, this is another proof that this isn’t really, because otherwise this is pretty touchy stuff to be making light of in front of John. Instead, let’s remember this is Sherlock’s Mind Palace – John isn’t John here. What Sherlock does a lot in s4 – and nowhere more than the finale of TST – is displace a lot of his real world problems onto other people because he cannot handle the emotional impact of them, and that’s what he’s doing here. He’s trying to come to terms with the danger that Mary poses, but he can’t do it with John – hence why this scene has a John substitute, because that’s what the client is.
, is pretty helpful here I think – of course it has relevance within the episode, but this episode should also get us thinking about what was going on this time last year, when Sherlock was airing.
“Aaaahhh!”
“Thanks, Sherlock. But – what you said last night –“
[Obviously, there’s another, more notable use of an aeroplane in the programme – you can see where I’m going here. But bear with me – there’s more first.]
part of ‘amo’, only the love. And whilst imagining that John is suicidal, he hypothesises that it is from losing Mary. By the end of TLD, Sherlock’s going to figure out that he was very wrong. But this is why Norbury doesn’t just shoot Mary – that in itself would be enough drama, and it could have created a conflict scene which was really worthy of Amanda Abbington’s dramatic capabilities – the bullet needs to almost hit Sherlock before his mind diverts it back into this incredibly flawed vision of what a Sherlock Holmes story should look like.
This is what Sherlock says about Moriarty in the very first scene of TST, and on rewatch the application to Mofftiss is startling. Trust the writers – a short-term disappointment for a long-term excitement, if you will. The reference to the rooftop is a way of pointing out just how far back this has been planned – in other words, the seeming randomness of the series is not in fact random. But let’s see how that plays out in TST.
This chapter has been a long one, but I hoped it help to set up EMP theory on firm foundations. We’ll move into TAB next – see you there!
Chapter 12 – Three Men in a Boat [TFP 2/3]
The ‘say the words Norbury to me’ line is taken almost directly from
). I can’t make these points better than she has, nor can I take credit for them. I’m particularly invested in her description of the aquarium and the Samarra story, as well as the client cases that appear and aren’t updated on John’s blog. Our reading will diverge later on – I think this series is a lot more metaphorical than it is hypothesis-testing, although the latter is a notable feature of ACD canon (see the original THotB) that definitely does happen here as well. I’m going to leave the Samarra story, the aquarium and the cases for LSiT to explain, however, and move on.
He did not want to leave; he had known this for a long time. Putting off the new flat, delaying estate agents, all from the will to spend a few more precious weeks in Baker Street. He had excused it to himself, told himself that it would be hard to raise Rosie alone, that he needed support. That that was why.
, we can see that this has been in the works for a lot longer.
Notice that ‘glad to be alive’ is followed by Vivian saying her name – we’ll come back to this later.
I’m not going to comment on the bus scene because I have a chapter dedicated to Eurus moments before TFP – jumping straight ahead.
Holmes tricks Moran into incriminating himself by creating a dummy Holmes for Moran to shoot at. It’s true that Mary doesn’t shoot at dummy Sherlock (John) here, but the dummy is set up to incriminate her, and she acknowledges that this is a basic trick, one she should have known before. The links of the empty house and the dummy, both made explicitly familiar in the dialogue, do a lot to link Mary’s character to acdcanon!Moran.
New paragraph – spoilers gone. Moments where the perspective was actually subjective and we missed it or forgot it are great rug pulls, because the clues are there but we don’t spot them. We love a good unreliable narrator. This isn’t the case here. The plane scene, as visualised, exists only inside Eurus’s head. Eurus is emphatically not our narrator during TFP, so when it comes out that the girl on the plane isn’t real, we just feel lied to.
This is just about the loosest sketch of TAB that could exist! But TAB meta has been so extensive that going over it seems futile, or else too grand a project within a short chapter. Certain theories are still formulating, and may appear at a later date! But what this chapter (I hope) has achieved has set up the patterns that we’re going to see play out in s4 – between the metatextuality, the waters of the mind and the role of Moriarty in the psyche, we can use TAB as a key with which to read s4. I like to think of it as a gift from Mofftiss, knowing just how cryptic s4 would be – and these are the basic clues with which to solve it.
. I’ve also pointed out that there is no point at which Sherlock is told Moriarty is back, yet he seems to know it automatically – another suggestion that this is EMP, and there’s a lot more going on.
And yet, John found himself caught up in the film. Sherlock had been right; it was good, although not normally the sort of film John would choose. Yet he found himself caught up in the mundane family drama around the turn of the previous century, his heart lifting with the surge of the music. Rosie was quickly lulled to sleep, but they did not switch the film off; although Sherlock had seen it many times before, John saw that he was captivated by it once again. It was visually pleasing, he couldn’t deny. And there weren’t many films that Sherlock watched without complaining, so he took that as a plus too.
Do you get it? She’s his sister? But metaphorically, she’s a part of his soul? I was very impressed with myself for
The similarities between these two are pretty straightforward; the most common reading of
, not just the camera footage – it would have been very easy to give us most of the same footage in security camera style, but they deliberately reused shots from the show to make us doubt their own authenticity. So far, so good.
We’ve been through what Thatcher represents to queer people of Sherlock’s age, so there’s already a strong metaphor for homophobia being smashed there. However, let’s look at the AGRA memory stick being uncovered. We know (
The next transition is fantastic. We see two reflections of Mycroft listing off another meaning of Agra (an Indian city) whilst seemingly looking at each other. The reflections are distorted to be thinner than normal, again pointing to the dreamscape we’re used to by now, but also telling us that Mycroft’s voice is Sherlock’s brain here, reflecting – this is the equivalent of going into his mind palace to work something out, drawing on memories and existing knowledge. However, remember that in real life the memory stick does not exist. So why is Sherlock so keen on deciphering AGRA? Well, the treasure of Agra features in The Sign of the Four, in which Holmes is trying to regain the treasures for Mary but does not (as mentioned before, the Agra box is empty) – but the actual important development is that Watson and Mary become engaged. Agra here is not about the memory stick, much like ammo isn’t about ammunition; it’s a tool for Sherlock to engage with Mary’s past. However, Mycroft referencing the original Agra here suggests that Sherlock is trying to grapple with Mary’s potentially criminal past, and also that he can’t get past who she was supposed to be, as we’ve already seen from HLV (she wasn’t supposed to be like that!). However, it’s also a sign that he’s missing the most important part of The Sign of the Four, which is all the more notable for its importance because the wedding episode is named for it; John’s relationship with Mary is the real occurrence in that story.
“Wock,” she responded, and John laughed.
suggests that there are two worlds, and only one is a dream; their survival depends on recognising which is the real one. This is, of course, a lie – both worlds are dreamed, and that false premise is created to trap them in the Doctor’s psyche, presumably until the Doctor dies (although the threat is never clearly explained). TAB sets up a real world in the form of the modern day and a false Victorian age, but the supernatural graveyard scene is the first hint that the reality/dream binary is not real, just like

Sherlock shook his head. He did not have the words. Mummy seemed to understand; she simply sat beside him. Sherlock felt her eyes on him as he looked straight ahead, through the glass once more to John.
Sherlock laughed. “Alright. You wrap her up – I’ll be two minutes.”
“Da…”
We now discover what heart!John meant by “so many lies […] I don’t just mean you” earlier – his not-tryst with Eurus. Again, this is discussed in greater detail in an earlier chapter (

the threat that the shooting in HLV poses. Sherlock can’t emotionally process this yet, so at the very last moment he throws Mary in front of the bullet – because technically, in this shooting, John loses Mary as well. He at least loses the Mary he thought he knew. And so, at the last minute, Sherlock reverts to the superhero Sherlock Holmes story mindset which is devoutly heterosexual and devoutly heroic, and pulls his punch. He refuses to acknowledge the
These lines are delivered so quickly between the two of them that it feels like Sherlock is talking to himself, like Mary isn’t even in the room. The way BC delivers ‘mixed messages’ – it’s as though there’s still a problem, bbc!Mary hasn’t been reconciled to good!Mary yet.

Sherlock appeared in the door to the sitting room. John looked up, about to apologise. To his surprise, Sherlock was dressed in his long coat, scarf tucked in, and winter gloves on. He was holding a papoose.
. It’s also a stylish shot (what I call split screen, but given that I never went to film school I think that’s just my name for it) and it’s repeated enough times over TLD that it’s pretty clear the creatives want it to be memorable. By the time John gets shot, then, we shouldn’t be caught up in the drama of it – we should be thinking, as so many did, “something’s fucky.”

We then move into Sherlock’s interrogation of Mary behind the facade of the houses. In case we missed the reference, Mofftiss actually have the phrase
Others have pulled out similar references to Holmes adaptations he has to push through in TAB – look at the way he talks in sign language to Wilder, which can only be a reference to Billy Wilder, director of TPLoSH, the only queer Holmes film, and a film which was forced to speak through coding because of the Conan Doyle estate. That film is also referenced by Eurus giving Sherlock a Stradivarius, which is a gift given to him in TPLoSH in exchange for feigning heterosexuality. Eurus is coded as Sherlock’s repression, and citing a repressive moment in a queer film as her first action when she meets Sherlock is another engagement by Sherlock’s psyche with his own cinematic history. My favourite metatextual moment of this nature, however, is the final scene of TFP which sees John and Sherlock running out of a building called Rathbone Place.
When he looked back, of course, that was not the real reason. The flat had too many memories; everywhere he looked, he could not help but see Mary’s shape, just out of reach, in the corner of his eye. He had thought that was normal, but although he still saw her sometimes, leaving the flat had helped. She was no longer omnipresent. He had not wanted to raise Rosie in a home that constricted his chest, that made him feel like he couldn’t breathe when he walked into the nursery that he had painted with her. With Mary. He had not wanted that.
Sure, as I recall it never gets off the ground. But
Sherlock could hear John padding around the flat, attending to Rosie’s cries. It was before seven, as it normally was when they rose. This morning, however, he put off getting out of bed a little longer. He did not think he could look at John without imagining the previous night, speak to him without the note of his desires creeping into his voice. Especially not now he knew that this arrangement could not go on.
John looked abashed to see Sherlock rising so early. “Sorry. I didn’t want her to wake you. But – the snow, I guess.”
John smiled regretfully. “You’re very kind. But I was looking at flats online the other day –“
Turning Mary into a client is about moving into the rational part of Sherlock’s brain, trying not to let emotion cloud it, even though it’s incongruous and unworkable. We’ll see Sherlock’s brain and heart slowly integrate, finally uniting in TFP, but for now he thinks rationality is the way forward. This also helps us to set out a framework for what happens with Mary in the EMP – clients are deduced, worked out, they present problems - never forget Mary being framed as the abominable bride – and that’s what is happening here. She is the first problem of the extended mind palace to be solved.
He hoped that Mary knew it too. He rolled over in bed, hearing the gentle whistle of Rosie’s breathing out and in. As he slipped into semi-consciousness, he sensed a soft breath of wind over his face in the still room. He hoped Mary was in agreement.
“It’s for kids! And it’s a Christmas movie.”

John laughed drily. “You’re still young – I’ve saddled you with a brooding middle-aged man and a baby. I assumed that you would take us in – I didn’t even think about you. It wasn’t fair.” He took a deep intake of breath and continued. “So I’ve been looking at flats, and I think I’ve found somewhere that will work. I’ll be out of your hair by the new year.”
Chapter 5 – Hey, Soul Sister: Who is Eurus?
The first thing Sherlock does after being pushed under by Janine is go and interrogate who Mary is in his brain, whilst also working out her impact on John. Sherlock comes up with a pretty reasonable background for who she is in the Leinster Gardens scene, but this isn’t really what’s important – it's the
Despite the many hyperlogical explanations, John still managed to drag Sherlock to the nearest shopping centre to meet Santa with him and Rosie. The queue was not too long, largely because it was a Wednesday afternoon and all the older children were still in school. John reasoned that it was better this way; it really wasn’t fair to submit the parents of children who had just grown out of that stage to a whole host of screaming babies. This meant that the queue, although short, was tempestuous, and more than once John caught Sherlock gazing longingly at a pair of earmuffs in a winter display window.
Suddenly, Rosie extended her arm and pointed up at him. “She-wock!” Her pronunciation was questionable at best, but his name was clearly recognisable.
. Regardless, his first scene is back to parody here. Sherlock’s quip about the polling station is the sort of quip you only see on television, and the fighting that follows is clearly stage fighting. We get Bond-esque drama as they jump into the pool and smash the glass (note the same motif from the Thatcher smashing earlier), but even before that, banging each others’ heads off the surfaces without a scratch is obvious stage fighting and a well known move. It feels more like theatre than TV, and for me it doesn’t work on film. Perhaps I’m being harsh here, but I feel again that we’re moving into a parody of Sherlock Holmes the superhero. We also get several shots during the fight scene where water seems to obscure the lens with its weird refraction of light; I love this, because it’s a jarring reminder that the camera exists, and with that a reminder that this is artificial. It jolts us out of the scene and speaks to its unreality.
poem that will become so important in TAB. Except, this time, John accepts that there’s an east wind coming – he references it repeatedly, actually, as a threat, both here and in TFP. The east wind is the wind of change that comes through the changing years in acd!canon. This seems particularly important here – the social changes between 1895 and 2014 are vital for the next episode, highlighting the idea that the update of the show is a really central part to it. There’s no world war ahead of Holmes (please God @2020) so the wind of change must be referring to something else… I really couldn’t possibly comment as to why the change of time period might be so important!
Sherlock did not realise that he had stood up and turned away; it was an act of instinct, self-protection. He swallowed down the lump that was rising in his throat, took a few long breaths. John had stopped speaking; he did not want to turn around, to know whether he was just characteristically fumbling for words, or if he had genuinely seen through Sherlock’s callous act.
Sherlock had always thought of Christmas as a meretricious festivity for those whose minds were subject to the inanity of ritual and incapable of logical analysis. Yet, this time around, he had to admit Molly was right. Singing Christmas songs with Rosie earlier, when he had thought Sherlock wasn’t looking, there had been a twinkle in John’s eye. Twinkles were unverifiable, to be sure, and it might just have been the light of the fire glinting in John’s vision, but despite never having seen such a twinkle before Sherlock would have sworn by it. And with it came a fleeting thought:
You are her mother, after all.
Others have explained why Norbury is a mirror for Mary – if we hadn’t already spotted the Lady Smallwood connection, there’s the fact that they are both receptionists, that they use the exact same gun and of course that they both attempt to kill Sherlock to protect themselves. When we read this scene, we should be reading it in the same way it has become completely mainstream to read Ricoletti as Moriarty; Norbury is Mary. She thought she could outrun the inevitable, but somebody has information on her. What happened with AGRA isn’t actually relevant here, because that was all hypothesis – Magnussen has something, and that’s all that matters. Norbury’s wish to get out of criminal mess in favour of domesticity matches Mary’s, seemingly – and in case we didn’t get this parallel, Norbury draws it herself, asking Mary if they don’t just want the same thing.
That afternoon, with Sherlock out on a case, he decided to light it. It wasn’t a Sunday, and he knew that was how it was supposed to work, but he also knew the candles would run out if he did one each Sunday, and besides it was a fire hazard with an eleven-month old in the flat. He thought he would simply show it to Rosie, and light the candles in memory of her mother. While Sherlock was out, of course. Even whilst Baker Street had been a welcome rhythm to slip into once again, there was still an unspoken awkwardness around Mary. John wondered if Sherlock still blamed himself for her death. John certainly did not blame him any longer. It was a conversation he didn’t know how to have, somehow.
His drunken actions had complicated his plan of action. A confession and a proposition would now turn into a confession and an apology. But Sherlock was the most observant man in Britain, if not further afield; it would be an insult to act as though Sherlock had not apprehended his intentions. Better to be honest and part amicably. It had been nice while it lasted.
“Yes, but we also had to crack cryptic codes before opening our presents. I never know what’s universal and what’s just Holmes tradition.”

is (I believe) the final Holmes story, and the east wind that is coming refers to WW1 – Holmes tells Watson that there is an east wind coming and Watson thinks he means it’s cold, and Holmes laughs and jokes that Watson is a stalwart who will always be there. This is a touching moment to end the stories on, and might remind us of the
When.
Mary is the housemaid who has broken in to shoot Magnuessen/Milverton – so far so good. Although Holmes was hidden in the original stories, he was still present and sympathetic; the logical canon-following route here is for Mary to kill Magnussen, and that’s exactly what Sherlock expects her to do – but she doesn’t. She shoots him instead, and Sherlock can’t understand this. As we’ll see, he spends the rest of HLV trying to justify this pattern-breaking to himself, and is finally unable to.
Sherlock normally stayed up until the early hours, whereas John was more sensible; it was no surprise, then, that he had never noticed this before, those crucial hours being the few he seemed to salvage from each night for sleep. “You should have said.”
The Christmas scene doesn’t make sense in the timeline – there's a great timeline diagram here

The glowing blue light sticks around, and seems particularly associated with Rosie, like she’s the focus of much of Sherlock’s thought at the moment. LSiT’s meta linked above has already picked up on the many dangers in Rosie’s cradle decoration, from the Moriarty linked images to the killer whale mobile. Due purely to a lucky pause, I caught the killer whale’s eyes glowing blue, just like the blue from the rattle scene. He’s thinking about her in terms of the key villains of the show as well as the villains in his mind.

), but I want to give a brief outline. It first appears with the word ‘deeper’ which keeps reappearing, which then reaches a climax in the waterfall scene. The idea that Sherlock could drown in the waters of his mind is something that Moriarty explicitly references, suggesting that Sherlock could be ‘buried in his own Mind Palace’. The ‘deep waters’ line keeps repeating through series 4, and I just want to give the notorious promo photo from s4 which confirms the significance of the motif.
Sherlock had not known whether he should go or not. John no longer blamed him for Mary’s death, or at least not except in his darkest moments, or else John would not be back in Baker Street. Yet somehow Sherlock felt that he would be intruding on John’s very private grief. John was not just grieving his wife, although he certainly was doing that; he was also grieving the life that he and Mary had seen, stretching ahead of them into forever, the family that they had just begun to build.

I would be really interested to know how else this can be construed. This line can make sense in the real world if we accept that Janine is working with Mary – which must be true anyway, because otherwise Mary can’t get to CAM – and
John didn’t really know how to pray, but when he lit the candles he tried anyway. To thank Mary, for bringing him Rosie, for bringing him solace in his grief when he had most needed her, for everything. Nearly everything, he reminded himself – maybe not shooting Sherlock. Everything else. To apologise to her for not grieving enough, for not stopping his life, but to tell her that he had to keep moving and living, for Rosie. And, he added, for himself. He knew that Mary understood that. Hadn’t she done the very same, after all? And whilst his new life might not be so glamorous or exciting as Mary zipping through identities around the world, it was his. It was what he wanted.
And then he pulled away, and Sherlock released a breath he had not known he was holding. He turned furiously away from John, determined to hide the flush that he could feel rising in his cheeks, quickly placing a building block in Rosie’s hands. “Here, Rosie. Aren’t you clever?”
It looks like Heaven, for want of a better description. The window with the light streaming through looks like the very top of a church window, and the beams suggest that the ceiling is like a kind of spire – and the spire in a church is meant to be closer to heaven, that’s part of the imagery. So there’s that side of things, and I really don’t think that’s a coincidence. However, the even weirder part is the partitioning of the room, for want of a better word. The wall ends at about chair height, and from there to the floor is – nothing? These aren’t mirrors because the chairs aren’t reflected. I have
John seemed taken aback by Sherlock’s abruptness – Sherlock was too, come to that, but he knew now that it was now or never.
. This one scene is not an anomaly – the chronology of the ‘man out of my time’ scene coming
Later, when asked how he knew that the Dream Lord was him, the Doctor merely says that no one else hates him so much. Domestic!verse, then, is a manifestation of everything that the Doctor dreads – it’s his worst nightmare, being conjured by his subconscious. That nightmare involves Amy’s suicide, Rory’s death because the Doctor can’t protect them – this maps pretty neatly onto EMP theory and TST. Although John doesn’t kill himself, he is rendered suicidal in the domestic nightmare that is left behind. As the previous chapter discusses, Sherlock not being able to protect John is definitely a nightmare, but the nightmare also maps onto reality – John is suicidal, but he’s struggling to work out why, so he has to construct it through a heterosexual lens. John’s potential death and love for Mary are the two things that form the worst nightmare in both dreams, and the nightmarish sense is highlighted in TST by the deep waters metaphor.
- that such a deduction could equally be applied to himself. He’ll get there in the end (TLD), but right now, that’s what makes this scene so painful for me.
He was relieved to see John crack a smile at the ridiculousness of the gift. “Yeah, alright.” Sherlock turned to go back to his experiment, but John interrupted him.
, a British soap, and already on the wrong side of America for Freddie Mercury’s unapologetic queerness, found themselves under fire from the American censors. Brian May says that no matter how many times he tried to explain
of Rathbone Place tells us that, just as Sherlock cast off the deerstalker at the end of TAB (!), he has also cast off the iconic filmic Holmes persona which has never been true to his actual identity.
as Queen’s most iconic queer number – despite not even being one of Mercury’s songs. There is no way that Steven Moffat, and even more so Mark Gatiss would not have an awareness of this in choosing this song for Moriarty. Applying any visual to this song is going to invite comparisons to the video – and inflecting a sense of drag here is far from inappropriate. Moriarty has been subsumed into Eurus in Sherlock’s brain – the male and the female are fused into an androgynous and implicitly therefore all-encompassing being. I’m not necessarily comfortable with the gendered aspect of this – genderbending is something we really only see in our villains here – but given this is about queer trauma, deliberately queering its form in this way is making what we’re seeing much more explicit.
The lunch had been lovely, actually; John and Daddy got on a storm, and Sherlock and Mummy had exchanged playful barbs as they were wont to – they were less acerbic without Mycroft present, Sherlock always found. Sherlock had been enlisted to help with the washing up whilst John had been assured that he should do no such thing, and that he should show Rosie the garden. Sherlock had huffed and puffed at his parents’ double standard, though of course they were absolutely correct – lovely as she was, Rosie was enough work even were John not a guest. Sherlock and Mummy had stayed reasonably non-verbal through the washing-up, beyond functional conversation; Sherlock had found his eye captivated by the sight of John outside the window, showing Rosie each plant, no doubt making up stories about the magical creatures that lived in them. He was sure John knew nothing about plants. The housework finished, he had lapsed into stillness at the window, just observing.
He turned away quickly. “Nothing,” he muttered. Heat rose in his face, a flush of shame at his obviousness, his weakness in wearing his heart on his sleeve, coming so close to betraying his feelings. He suspected – hoped – that John was too preoccupied to notice. He did not dare to look back to check.
“And what about you? Are you doing your best?”
“God – I love you too, you mad bastard, I really do.”
The other thing I want to lay on the table as foundational to this theory is the fandom’s obsession with TPLoSH [1970 Billy Wilder queer Holmes adaptation, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]. Mofftiss have long stated their love for TPLoSH and even that it is the adaptation that has most inspired them, and I don’t know a single tjlcer who doesn’t have this quotation from Wilder emblazoned onto their memory.
“Why?”
“All you’re going to teach her is that her parents lie to her, John. Is that what you want her to grow up thinking about you? Or would you rather she feel that you trust her to be a mature adult?”
There was no ‘d’ to round off ‘dad’, but it was spoken in such a tone that there was no question that she had meant it as such. Sherlock’s heart skipped a beat. Da. Her first word. Joy swelled all the way through his chest as he felt his grin split his face. He turned to John, whose grumpiness was already forgotten, sweeping Rosie up into his arms, beaming.
“He’s a good dad,” Mummy said softly.
The previous day, Sherlock had found excuse after excuse to avoid more than functional conversation with John. John did not blame him. Sherlock had not mentioned the kiss, a fact for which John was grateful.
The next scene is, I think, very important. We come across Mycroft in a dark room with a tiny bit of light – this is really odd, as the obvious place to put Mycroft would be the Diogenes Club. Yet, although clearly more modern, this reminds me most of all of the room we meet Mycroft in in TAB.
Except, of course, like so much of this interrogation of John and Mary’s relationship in HLV and onwards, this doesn’t quite ring true. Because, of course, there is no mad genius in the Watsons’ relationship, and in terms of sanity Mary is certainly not the sane one. It’s like Sherlock is trying to fit them into the domestic bliss mould, but they just won’t quite go there. The comparison won’t quite be made.
Others have pointed out that Gatiss wielding a pen in this scene means that he is speaking at least partially as Mofftiss, not just as brain!Mycroft – hence we have wonderful lines such as mentioning that all the best secret societies have acronyms (cough tjlc cough) and that he hates loose ends. A little reassurance there.
And so they found themselves strolling in the icy December air. Sherlock had been right; a blast of cold wind coupled with the lulling rhythm of Sherlock’s walk and Rosie had slipped into a deep sleep. John had offered to take her on his chest, but Sherlock seemed to feel that it was the least that he could do – this was the most difficult Rosie had been in months, and John had been dealing with it all morning, and John could not help but be grateful. His back was beginning to hurt from carrying that papoose around everywhere; a pram was so cumbersome and could not be easily brought into many places in a city so tightly packed as London, and without a partner to share duties with she was starting to weigh him down. It was times like this that having Sherlock on hand was a godsend.
is the one which articulates the problem of EMP theory most specifically. Jenny, our John mirror, dies because her protector’s unconsciousness means that she can’t protect her wife. (Vastra’s Silurian abilities very much put her into the role of protector here – she could save Jenny where Jenny couldn’t save herself, and frequently does.)
(DW Christmas Special 2014) that is relevant here – the main characters, all dreaming, whenever they are asked any questions that can’t be explained in the dream universe, simply reply ‘it’s a long story’. This is a ‘long story’ moment – where no explanation is given, so questions about reality are raised and unanswered.
This is my reasoning as to why MP!Eurus represents Sherlock’s innermost trauma. She is not merely the fact that he loves John – he deduced this in TSoT without her appearance. She is the trauma that he needs to come to terms with. A running theme through our analysis of Eurus will be that her gender is particularly important; her representation of Sherlock’s repression cannot be but as a woman, because for most of s4 he is only able to process his identity through the most heterosexual of lenses. We see this hinted at quite early on in TST, when Sherlock takes on a case called ‘The Duplicate Man’, warning John that it is never twins. The word ‘duplicate’ here, removing twins, leaves us with the only real possibility that it is in fact the same person. Eurus’s gender makes that more difficult to see; she needs to be female, but it’s much more difficult to elide the two characters without employing a Cumberbatch doppelganger. However, this hint that Eurus is not only male but an actual ‘duplicate’ of her brother should give us pause for thought. With this in mind, I want to use the rest of this chapter to analyse her three forms before TFP.
“You’re a real brainbox, you know that?”
[Moriarty]
, though I don’t know if that’s a good thing.) Further to that – it ties in nicely with Sherlock being ‘high’ through a lot of s4, which represents the moments in which he is most repressed and his repression is most tied to self-harm. We have further ideas to buttress the height/aeroplane metaphor with, however – do you remember the plane in ASiB?
You’re not her father.
Their first Christmas together was like no Christmas Sherlock or John had experienced.
But this scene is metafictional too, because it gets to the core nub of Mary – as John puts it,
As far as I can tell, nobody ever tells Sherlock that Moriarty is back. It’s possible Mycroft tells him offscreen, or that he googles it from his phone, given that he’s already breaking flight rules, but given that it’s the entire trigger for TAB, it seems a pretty odd thing to leave out. In EMP theory, it’s also the thing that downs his plane – in terms of the plane metaphor as well as literally, it stops him from dying. It’s pivotal, but we don’t see it. I therefore want to hypothesise –
It was not like the following Christmas at Sherlock’s parents, when Mary had been there, barely on speaking terms with John, and he and Sherlock had hardly known what to say to one another.
, which gets very little coverage generally in HLV.
“To family!” Stamford was shouting, holding out his glass to clink with a slightly mortified Molly Hooper. Others were joining in with greater brio. “To friendship! To love! To many more years of Christmases and New Years spent with the ones we love!”
The obsession with the memory stick here is important because the memory stick represents the unknown about Mary that Sherlock is trying – and failing – to get to grips with. However, he’s still going about it the wrong way, and we know that from one line of Mary’s: ‘Sherlock the dragon slayer’. We’ve had these references to Sherlock’s ridiculous hero complex before, but this one stands out, because it feels like a throwback – and it is! But, it’s a throwback to:
The next bit I want to jump into is Sherlock’s conversation with Janine in the hospital. A lot of people have argued that this is one of the only real moments following Mary shooting Sherlock, and that Janine fiddling with the taps is part of what induces Sherlock’s fucky mind palace wanderings. I don’t buy into that theory – the more I think about this scene, the less it makes sense as being real in the context of EMP theory. The first reason for this is, very simply, that it means Sherlock has woken up after the realisation that John is in danger. The driving idea behind EMP theory is that Sherlock has to spend s4 making that realisation and trying to wake up – having that actually happen at the very start of EMP, only to be aborted, is bizarre. Secondly, it completely negates the idea that Mary’s actions are possibly fatal, which is a theme that reverberates through s4 (and all the chapters of this meta) - if Janine fiddling with the taps is what pushes Sherlock back into his MP, then by rights Janine should appear in S4, instead of the preoccupation it has with Mary and shooting.

Sherlock nodded, and John breathed out a heavy sigh. The smile he gave Sherlock was genuine, his eyes filled with relief. Sherlock did not trust himself to say anything, and from the glisten of light that reflected off John’s pupils Sherlock suspected he was in a similar situation.
He put the wreath on the table and sat beside it, Rosie on his lap, entranced by the beauty of it. Striking a match, he lit the first candle. His nostrils were instantly hit with the smell of cinnamon, so powerful that Rosie started coughing. John soothed her softly. There was no way Sherlock wouldn’t know about this now. He wondered if Sherlock would be jealous, of John and Rosie lighting the wreath just the two of them. He pushed the thought out of his mind. Why would he be jealous? This was about Mary, John’s wife and Rosie’s mother. Her relationship with Sherlock had been strained to say the least.
Sherlock not knowing who Thatcher is – perfectly feasible and actually quite important, although something that I’m not going to resolve until my meta on TFP, because that’s where it comes together for me. But Sherlock playing for time with his further jokes about being oblivious (‘female?’) – that, again, is Sherlock actively playing a caricature of himself. He’s not doing it for fun – he’s doing it to cover up his concern about the smashed
) that Sherlock deduced his feelings for John as he was marrying Mary, and so having the smashing of the Thatcher bust at the AGRA memory stick reveal is pretty devastating metaphorically. Why does Sherlock constantly think Moriarty is involved? Well, HLV tells us that the Jim in Sherlock’s mind is his darkest fear – and he’s originally tied up in Sherlock’s mind when he’s first shot, but he pretty quickly gets loose. That darkest fear is exactly what Jim says in that episode: ‘John Watson is definitely in danger’. The reason we bring Jim in to represent this is part of deconstructing the myth of Sherlock Holmes. The whole concept of an arch enemy is made fun of in the show, and rightly so; Moriarty himself tells the Sir Boastalot story which lines Sherlock up with that ridiculous heroic tradition that he’s set himself into, which isn’t what Sherlock Holmes is really about at all. Holmes has never really been particularly invested in individual criminals (although there are exceptions –  Irene Adler, for example) – the time he gets most het up is The Three Garridebs, as we all know, when he thinks Watson is dying. It’s his greatest fear, and it’s also what Jim threatens, so Jim has become a proxy for that – and to understand that Sherlock Holmes is
When TAB aired, we were preoccupied with Emelia as a Sherlock mirror, and it’s easy to see why; the visual parallels (curly black hair, pale skin) plus the parallel faked death down to the replacement body, which Mofftiss explicitly acknowledge in the episode. However, I don’t think that this reading is complete; rather, she foreshadows the Eurus that we meet in s4. The theme of ghosts links TAB with s4 very cleanly; TAB is about Emelia, but there is also a suggestion of the ghosts of one’s past with Sir Eustace as well as Sherlock’s own claims (‘the shadows that define our every sunny day’). Compare this to s4 – ‘ghosts from the past’ appears on pretty much every promotional blurb, and the word is used several times in relation to Eurus. If Eurus is the ghost from Sherlock’s past, the repressive part of his psyche that keeps popping back, Emelia is a lovely metaphor for this; she is quite literally the ghost version of Sherlock who won’t die.
I know I was joking about Molly and John’s moustaches, but putting such a silly moustache on Molly links to the silliness of John’s moustaches, which only appear when he’s engaged to a woman and in the Victorian era. He has also grown the moustache just so the illustrator will recognise him, and Molly has grown her moustache so that she will be recognised as a man. In this case, Molly is here to demonstrate the fact that John is passing, but only ever passing. Furthermore, Molly, who is normally the kindest person in the whole show, is bitter and angry throughout TAB – it’s not difficult to see then how hiding one’s identity can affect one’s mental health. I really do think that John is a lot more abrasive in TAB than he is in the rest of the show, but that’s not the whole story. Showing how repression can completely impair one’s personality also points to the suicidal impulses that are lurking just out of sight throughout TAB – this is what Sherlock is terrified of, and again his brain is warning him just what it is that is causing John this much pain and uncharacteristic distress.
At the very end of the episode, the Doctor’s reflection is still the Dream Lord, suggesting that this isn’t some psychic drug phenomenon, an explanation which was frankly crap. The Doctor’s dark side is still inside him. This feels like an allegory for mental illness, and mental illness crops up aplenty in Moffat’s depictions of the Doctor, particularly the later we get – the seeds of it are here. Again, although Sherlock is being killed rather than killing himself, we have seen the suicidal side of him before and it is made clear in TAB that his opinion of himself is low. EMP s4 is about him coming to terms with how he views himself, and the cognitive dissonance that we see in Amy’s Choice is a nice separation of the psyche in two that foreshadows the immense splintering that’s going to come in EMP, but particularly between John, Mycroft and Eurus.
“You’re cold.”
(A Study in Scarlet, Sherlock Holmes)
, so I’m not going to run through them again here. I think Sherlock comes the closest to death that we see him in the EMP at the end of HLV – if you remember, he’s been put on a plane in ‘exile’ by Mycroft, but in reality is being sent to his death. This plane/height image is really important. In the Christian tradition (and therefore majority Western tradition that the writers are writing in), the sky is associated with heaven – Sherlock’s plane taking off being synonymous with his death seems a pretty straightforward metaphor in that regard. (It’s even one that’s used in
“There’s something I need to say.”
The little sleep he had managed to get the previous night had been filled with forbidden thoughts, thoughts of what could be. He had imagined Rosie growing up and never leaving Baker Street. He had imagined the years passing like the seasons, and John remaining in his chair beside the fire, opposite Sherlock, as their future stretched on into eternity. He imagined John’s soft embrace, kissing his head once again and then kissing him more, with all the tenderness he felt for him. The tenderness he had always felt for him. It was both a curse and a blessing that John was not a more observant man.
Sherlock called back to John from his bedroom, already searching through his wardrobe for something suitably warm so he would not be reprimanded a second time. “It’s her first snow! And she has to see it when it’s soft and pure – before the roadsweepers get their machines on it, before the rush hour pedestrians turn it grey with their tread. It’s beautiful then too – differently beautiful. But it shouldn’t be her first time.” He rushed back out of his bedroom, fully clothed and wrapped up, euphoric, to see John wide-eyed and grinning right back at him, Rosie’s grin just visible beneath her woollen swaddling making a third.
Sherlock had not meant it to come out so harshly, but luckily Mummy knew him well enough that she did not even flinch, merely slid into the seat beside him. They sat in silence for a few moments before she spoke again.
). I also think, although am not an expert on sound, that we can hear a slight eerie dripping when Magnussen walks through the vaults, which ties thematically to the water that is linked to falling/sinking in the rest of the EMP.
The last episode I want to briefly invoke is
Chapter 6 – So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish [TST ½]
“Sherlock?”
The words hit Sherlock like a dull blow, thudding into his gut. She’s not your daughter. John had said them to be kind, he knew, to make sure that Sherlock felt that there was no additional responsibility on him. It was kind. Meant kindly. He twisted his lips into what he hoped was a grateful smile. She’s not your daughter. Well, she wasn’t. There was nothing untruthful about what John had said. He looked wistfully at Rosie, kicking happily strapped into her chair, then on an impulse grabbed her out of it, deftly unfastening the buckles on her high chair as he swung her around.
The chapter that deals with who or what Eurus might represent in Sherlock's Mind Palace.
He had consulted Mrs. Hudson, who had foisted a box of decorations on him that she normally put up around both flats whether he asked for them or not. She said that her back was too bad this year, and so could he do it, but he suspected that was not true. Nevertheless, she was nearing eighty; it would have been churlish to refuse.
John pulled away, and Sherlock saw his eyes were glistening. It was a moment before he remembered why – Rosie’s first word. Of course. A sense of guilt began to percolate in his stomach – this was a moment for parents. He thought of Mary. She should be the one here, sharing Rosie’s achievement with John, not him.
that shows how much fuckier than any other episode HLV is (excluding TSoT and everything post s3), and that doesn’t even take into account all of the jumping between scenes that we see in the Christmas bit. Jumping from Leinster Gardens to Christmas to Baker Street and back several times is chronologically odd and doesn’t seem to serve a purpose, except to show that the rift between John and Mary has lasted for months – and even that didn’t need such a complex interweaving of flashbacks that is so at odds with the show. It’s also at odds with the plot – why on earth did Mummy and Daddy invite John for Christmas, if he’s no longer living with Sherlock, and even stranger, why did they invite Mary if John and Mary haven’t been on speaking terms for months? This isn’t the way human beings behave. There’s also an old adage in writing which says to never move a conversation to a new place – it’s a waste of time and space. Have the conversation here, or have it there. Don’t abort it for no reason – and that’s exactly what they do here. Mofftiss are pretty experienced, and I’m inclined to believe that they’ve done it for a reason.
“Yes, of course. What’s going on?”
is a cracking song, and you should listen to it.
The weird thing about the reveal of how Charlie died is that we see what should have happened, if everything had gone right, before we see how he died. I can’t recall this happening in another episode of
Everyone has dug into Mary’s death non stop for the last few years, and I’m not sure I can add too much that is new, but my 2c on how Mary’s death happens is thus. Sherlock has finally come to the point where he can play out Mary shooting him and the impact this has on John, and so Norbury takes the place of Mary in this rerun. Sherlock is, ostensibly, playing himself, but at the very last second he substitutes Mary. Many tjlcers have pointed out that Mary’s leap in front of the bullet contravenes everything Molly Hooper says about gunshots and plays into a movie hero stereotype rather than anything realistic, and I think we’re definitely being pulled into something artificial here. Why does Mary jump in front of Sherlock? Well, let’s think about how trauma!Eurus allows Sherlock to interrogate his feelings for John (and vice versa), both as E and Faith, through a heterosexual lens by being gender swapped. This is a key sign that Sherlock isn’t able to process a queer vision of himself yet. If Norbury had shot Sherlock, which by rights she should have done in this scene, we would have seen John having to come to terms with Sherlock’s death and dealing with it suicidally – which is
to the Americans, they just didn’t get it. This was huge controversy at the time, but the video and the controversy around it also managed to cement
is that an actress commits suicide by overdose after causing the death of her ex-girlfriend, who has left her for a man, and that the first two-thirds of the film are her dream of an alternate scenario in which her girlfriend is saved. The last third of the film zooms in and out of ‘real life’, but at the end we see a surreal version of the actual overdose which suggests that this ‘real life’, too, has just been in her psyche. Sherlock dying and recognising that this may kill John is an integral part of TAB, and the relationships have clear parallels, but what is most interesting here is the structural similarity; two-thirds of the way through TAB, give or take, we have the jolt into reality, zoom in and out of it for a while and then have a fucky scene to finish with that suggests that everything is, in fact, still in our dying protagonist’s brain.
Sherlock froze.
“I mean no. It wasn’t unfair. I offered 221B. I offered to help you with Rosie for as long as you needed, no strings attached. And no – I don’t want you to leave.” He gulped, afraid he’d said too much. “I don’t want either of you to leave. Unless you want to leave. In which case I obviously won’t stop you –“ He was fumbling now, and he knew it, but John stepped in to save him.
[The chapter title comes from David Bowie’s
century. Falling in love won’t kill him in the modern day. What I missed that time around, of course, was that despite breaking through the initial Victorian layers of repression, he still dives into more water, and when the plane lands, it still lands in his MP, just in a mental state where the punishment his psyche deals him for homosexuality is less severe. This also sets up s4 as specifically dealing with the problem of the fall – Sherlock jumps to the 21
, and here we’re hitting a pretty silly version of the show where they joke that just about the only character who can’t be real is Father Christmas. These hints about looking for what’s not real, though, should be taken as just that – hints. From the emergence of ‘something’s fucky’ theories early on in s4, this has been the abiding reasoning for the various forms of EMP theory that have sprung up, and they’re not wrong. However, if I had to put my money on a figure like Santa Claus, something iconic which functions as a kind of dream thermometer, I’d be guessing:
), this is really significant and so obvious as a code that my casual family spotted it (although knowing how to crack the code was beyond most of us, an excellent piece of work by @jenna221b). Mycroft’s fridge is also unnecessarily shiny and reflective, so now we’ve seen that neither the brain or the heart is giving up just yet, and as to be discussed in a later chapter, brain!Mycroft’s final recourse to Sherrinford symbolises moving into the deepest part of Sherlock’s psyche to solve this problem – and the most guarded.
“Absolutely.”
Sherlock grinned. “Hat, coat, scarf – we’re going out.”
Sherlock nodded, and he heard John pad all the way out to his shared room with Rosie before he turned around to the empty sitting room. He had them for a few more months, at least. But suddenly he was all too aware of how soon those months would pass.
Another nice parallel between s4 and
“No. I liked it.” He saw the breath catch in John’s throat, could feel himself flushing a deep beetroot. “And that’s the problem, I think. I liked it and I like you – the way I’ve always liked you. And I thought we could make it work – I thought I could live with you, like we did before. But last night, I realised – it’s unfair. It’s unfair on you – and it’s totally unfair on me.” He took a deep breath. “I’m in love with you, John, and I have been since we met.”
Sherlock smiled. “She’s not even one yet. You have time.”
Mary showing up on a Miss Me? DVD raises the question of how the hell it got there – dream logic, fine. All a bit
And yet, for weeks he had been searching property websites, ignoring the gnawing feeling in his stomach that leaving was wrong. It was only that day, the 3rd of December, when the icy wind blew through the shoddy windows of 221B and John wrapped the blanket closer around his shoulders, that he realised that, home in Baker Street, he had never once complained about the cold.
. Anyway…
Sherlock had said it casually, and yet something stopped in John. Rosie could go here. Was that what Sherlock was suggesting? That John live near here – or still live in Baker Street – whilst Rosie went to school? “I…” He found himself quite unable to respond. The catchment area – that was quite possibly something that Sherlock just knew, like he knew dozens of perfumes from one sniff and hundreds of types of tobacco ash. But there was a chance, just a chance, that it wasn’t something that Sherlock just knew. That it was something he had researched, maybe even wanted.
can tell me what that is, I would love to know. I’m going to assume it’s a fucky mirror, because it’s in keeping with the other fucky mirrors so far. The visibility of John and Lestrade in the mirror is even more odd because it doesn’t match the colour palette of 221B at all. Sherlock is lit largely in warm, brown colours, as is Charlie’s father in the previous scene we’re transitioning from – Lestrade and John are lit in dark blue, to the point where they’re barely visible. This looks like a rearview mirror, but not like the one on the power ranger car – it’s a much older car, out of a different time, like so much in this dream world. The only colour palette they seem to match is the one from the s4 promotion photos – you know, when Baker Street is completely underwater.
What I’m proposing here is that whilst we’ve thought about this quote quite a lot, we’ve always focused on the first half – that Sherlock Holmes is a homosexual – and not the second, which is that that’s the reason he’s on dope. We talk a bit about Sherlock being upset in HLV about John’s marriage and that being why he turns back to drugs, and likewise when TAB first aired a lot of people (myself included) thought he was ODing because he wasn’t going to see John again. I now think – and will provide evidence through the meta! – that it isn’t his feelings of (seemingly) unrequited love which are sending him to drugs, nor that the EMP is a place where he’s discovering his feelings – my meta here
It was an innocuous moment when John finally realised it.
Now. Why is Sherlock so keen for Lestrade to take the credit? It’s another reason to bring up the fact that John’s blog is constantly updating – it’s dropped in a lot in this series as opposed to others – and to make us think about why nothing is happening in real life. But, given that this episode is about Sherlock trying to find who he is, is it a rejection of the persona that goes along with being Sherlock Holmes? Possibly, but he’s going to have to go to a lot more effort than that. John’s blog is the real problem here, making not just Sherlock but Lestrade out to be like they’re not. John’s blog is a stand in for the original stories, which were supposed to be written by John Watson, but TAB has already (drawing on TPLoSH) laid the groundwork for the idea that John’s blog/those stories really do not tell the whole story. So this is coming back with a vengeance here, even though for the first time Sherlock is properly moving against the persona in there, not just bitching about John’s writing style, which is a theme more common to Sherlock Holmes across the ages. John then says that it’s obvious, and when pressed just laughs and says that it’s normally what Sherlock says at this point – so again, when Sherlock stops filling the intense caricature of arrogance and bravado, John the storyteller steps in to put him back in line, even though that means pulling him back to being a much more unpleasant character.
, one of the myriad of reasons why the year 1895 is so significant.) My feeling is that these adaptations, which have layered on top of each other in the public consciousness to cement the image of Sherlock Holmes the deductive machine [which he’s not, sorry Conan Doyle estate] come to symbolise the 100+ years of repression that Sherlock himself has to fight through to come out of the EMP as his queer self.
Mrs. Hudson, knowing his annual ineptitude, had already dropped some less than subtle hints about slippers to him; she had dropped no such hints to John, suggesting that she trusted his ability to buy presents far better than Sherlock’s. Sherlock could not blame her. That would be her sorted. He would take his parents to the theatre when they came up on Christmas Eve. He doubted Mycroft would want anything. That only left John and Rosie.
“Advent calendars? Though I suppose Rosie is a bit young for them… she might choke on the chocolate. You can get ones with pictures in them, sheep, three wise men, that sort of thing. Although it’s the eighth already, I don’t suppose she’d mind.”
The following scene is an intercut phone conversation between Sherlock, still in Marrakech, and Mycroft in his office – moving back and forth between the two highlights the difference in colour scheme as well as in the angle of grating, which is similar but almost inverted. However, it’s Sherlock talking to brain!Mycroft rather than heart!John – it’s not a row between the two parts of the psyche, but showing that Sherlock has firmly moved over to the other. That won’t be the answer – they will need to integrate for the end of s4– but this is the way towards working out Mary. The split screen effect is helpful here for us to understand both sides not as different, but taking up the same space. This is heightened when Sherlock and Mycroft both walk off, their silhouettes merging into one – they are one and the same. It’s also important that it is from this space that Sherlock makes the ‘amo’ deduction – he could have done so from anywhere in London, but he doesn’t – he needs to be in a heart space.
SHERLOCK: Because I love it.
. Furthermore, although there’s a later meta in blindness across
That was the question, as much as anything else. If John had to name his friends most cut out for fatherhood, until recently Sherlock’s name would have been a definite last on the list. He was a dangerous man, John knew, emotionally immature, highly strung, an addict – all of the things that would make John wince as a GP preparing someone for parenthood. But Sherlock was also kind and gentle, more loving towards Rosie than anyone else John knew. When John had been in trouble, Sherlock had dropped everything and risked his life to get him back. Granted, in many cases it was Sherlock who had got him into trouble in the first place, but the thought nevertheless was there. When Mary had died, Sherlock had opened his home and life to John and Rosie with nary a word of complaint. John knew without needing to think that Sherlock was the steadiest, most reliable person he knew, even if he was simultaneously the most volatile.
). As we’ll later discover in a big way, the one thing that is stopping Sherlock from getting a handle on Mary and the threat she represents is that he can’t acknowledge his love for John as playing a part in this – he can’t understand why love is such an enormous threat. He will get there (at least partially) at the end of TST, but not until then. Just like the Sherlock-is-murdered metaphor in TSoT represents his realisation that he is in love with John, Mary’s attack on him here in a church stops him from getting to the bottom of what is going on with Mary.
which at some stage really needs writing, many people have made the point that Sherlock is associated with blindness throughout series 4, and so we should note that the architect of the dream people/flesh avatars is Madame Kovarian, better known (and usually credited) as the Eyepatch Lady. However, there’s one other key message they’re giving us, which comes at the end of the clip linked above – the baby’s not real. Both
2. To show that s4 is about Sherlock trying to break out of his MP coma after being shot by Mary
You’re not her father, he reminded himself. Nothing too large, too ostentatious. He was her godfather, of course, but then, when was the last time he had received something from his godfather? He had not seen Uncle Rudi in several years now. He did not want such an apathy to develop between him and Rosie. He knew that it was inevitable, of course; these few months, which had meant so much in his brain, would be forgotten by her. He would be an uncle who appeared less and less frequently as her and John’s lives got busier and busier, wherever they ended up living, and those few early months spent with him would be symbolic not of a happy home life but of her father’s mourning, his brokenness. These moments, the happiest in Sherlock’s life, would be nothing but a stopgap to her.
“Besides,” Molly continued, “Christmas will be hard for John this year. No Mary. The first year is always the most difficult. The first Christmas without my dad, my mum couldn’t do anything. She just sat there, looking so, so lost. I know John and Mary didn’t have each other that long – but it’s sadder that way, really. A Christmas tree would be nice – try to get the spirit in. Remind him that life still goes on, of how much he’s got. That’s what we did with Mum.”
She saved my life.
Chapter 2 – Look up here, I’m in Heaven: the height metaphor
The problem with parents was that they never knew when you wanted to be left alone. Sherlock would have been content gazing out the window for hours, following John’s every movement, the tenderness that he never let the rest of the world see. He turned to Mummy with an obvious sigh.
I think Eurus represents Sherlock’s queer trauma, and I’ll explain that in more detail in Chapter 5 X, which is completely devoted to Eurus. Her representing trauma, though, makes a great deal of sense in this situation. The problem of the plane, the threat that she hinges on, is one that has been repeating and repeating, though repressed, inside Sherlock’s consciousness, and he breaks through it with not only kindness, but the recognition that it is all in Eurus’s (and by extension his) head.
It is difficult, though, to buy a present for the person that you love. Sherlock remembered their Christmas party of 2011, when Molly Hooper had bought him a gift. How to tell someone you love them without scaring them off, to thank them without embarrassing them or driving a wedge between you, to ask for nothing in return? All that Sherlock wanted to express was somehow inexpressible – and if he did have the language, he was not sure that he wanted to use it. He could not help but feel that it was the one surefire way to drive John and Rosie away from him quicker than they were already inevitably going.
“Aaaaahhh!”

He braced himself for the moment. After five long years, he could not believe he was finally saying it. Through those years, the dormancy of these feelings had become the only certainty in his volatile existence. There was a strange nostalgia in letting them go after all this time.

To understand what’s going on in HLV, we’re going to need to understand the metafiction going on – and this is where a good knowledge of acd canon comes in. Most of HLV isn’t actually based on

A soft grin was spreading over John’s face. “You did this?”
, Jenny is supposed to lock up before they go into their trance, but she forgets. Intruders break in, but because Jenny and Vastra are unconscious they can’t defend themselves and so Jenny is murdered. This is the spur for everybody to wake up, to save themselves. Pretty much all of our dream states in Doctor Who are focused on the possibility of dying in the outside world, but
[A side note: can anybody identify/has anybody identified Norbury’s brooch? It looks incredibly significant, a face on it, but I have no idea who – the only person who pops into my head is the queen, and that throws up a lot of ramifications!]
“See if you can get lights, decorations. Mrs. Hudson will probably have some spare if you ask nicely. Rosie will love it. There’s nothing quite so exciting,” said Molly. Her eyes were starting to glimmer with the excitement of Christmas; she had always been a romantic, Sherlock reminded himself. That was why he had come to ask her, after all.
Molly seemed to notice the uncharacteristic uncertainty in his silence, for she stepped in. “Honestly. Sweep him up in the Christmas spirit. Let him know he’s still got a family, just a different one. You’re spending Christmas Day together, right?”
When Sherlock finally reaches Eurus’s room, he tells her that he’s on the ground and he can bring her down too – and what is most striking is the way Eurus is sitting. She’s actually incredibly grounded, sitting cross-legged on the floor, and given that the house is burned it’s likely that this is the ground floor as well. The dark room is a far cry from the bright lighting of the plane – everything suggests that she’s been pulled back. And of course, the lovely touch that all she needs to do is open her eyes. That’s all the creators have ever been asking people to do – open their eyes to what is hiding in plain sight – and Eurus is allowing Sherlock to see things afresh for the first time.
“Sorry,” Sherlock murmured, pulling his hand back from Rosie’s head, and John saw the usual guardedness fall back into his eyes, eyes which had just moments ago been so vulnerable in their loving gaze.
bears a particular relevance to Mary – and links her to Moriarty as his potential second-in-command. The most important link, however, is that in
In the dream sequence in
The first thing it tells us is that Sherlock is in his Mind Palace, because he knows that Moriarty is back without needing to be told. But the second is that Mycroft, the brain, is waking Sherlock from his dying stupor to tell him that England needs him, meaning that Sherlock’s brain equates Moriarty coming back with the word ‘England’ in some way. Perhaps this is a tenuous link, but the seed is planted back from ASiP, when we’re taught to associate John with his armchair.
“If you say so.” Sherlock’s voice curled out from behind the kitchen doors. John tried and failed not to fume.
A moment of appreciation for Sacha Dhawan, whose time on
John’s eyes locked on Sherlock’s on the other side of the room as Stamford spoke. Sherlock broke the eye contact as quickly as John had made it, and John felt something shatter in his heart. To love, indeed. There would be no more Christmases like this, he felt sure. He gave Rosie a rub as she hiccoughed on the warm milk that John had infused with cinnamon for her. Her first Christmas. He should not be so melancholy, but he could not help it.
is not the first to point out that Sherlock almost definitely deduces his own feelings for John in TSoT, in a case of the worst timing in television history. Instead, much like Wilder’s Holmes, I think our Sherlock is dealing with a huge amount of shame and internalised homophobia, which has metafictionally* been building up since Conan Doyle started writing – hence the trip back to 1895 in TAB. S4 is about breaking through over a century of Holmes adaptations which have formed Sherlock’s own version of himself, so that he can break out of them into a ‘Private Life’ outside of established canon.
“Not at all.” Sherlock forced the words out.
“Rosie normally doesn’t sleep past half five or so.”
You’ll have to tell him. Even thinking those words sent a spasm of anguish through John’s chest. They put a timer on his time at Baker Street, a timer on his friendship with Sherlock. He was not fool enough to believe he could keep lying to Sherlock, besides which, he prized honesty above all things. To continue to live a friendship with Sherlock would be dishonest to Sherlock as well as John himself. It would devalue everything they had. Yet John was painfully aware that in telling Sherlock, it was either the beginning or the end of his time in 221B.
“Yes!” Rosie replied excitedly. Her vocabulary had been slowly but surely expanding since her first word came, but not quite enough to declare what she wanted for Christmas. Father Christmas gave a great ho ho ho, that John didn’t think was entirely feigned. “Well, I’m sure your daddies will do their very best to get you that, whatever it is.”
If the Doctor and Sherlock are mirrors, Amy as the Doctor’s companion should be linked to John. Amy ran away on the night before her wedding, and whilst she is reasonably happy with Rory in the long term of the series, this episode is about her making the decision between domesticity and adventure – a pretty clear link to John in s3 and 4. This episode is particularly important for TST however, because Amy is heavily pregnant in the domestic dream – but she is far from enthused, torn between domestic life with Rory and wanting to run off with the Doctor. However, I grant the similarity with Martin Freeman isn’t striking.
“I don’t pretend to understand whatever it is that is going on between the pair of you. But you’re the happiest you’ve ever been since he was around – although fewer buildings jumped off and bullet wounds would be nice. But I don’t miss the drugs, the Saturday night A&Es we used to meet at when other families did Sunday lunch – and I’d rather they didn’t return when John leaves.”
He didn’t know what made him do it – the family melodrama playing in front of him, perhaps – but he reached out gently to Sherlock and guided his hand back to Rosie’s hair. She did not stir. Sherlock smiled, wistfully, John thought, as he gazed down at her, hand resting lightly by the side of her head, thumb gently stroking her downy hair. With the arm that wasn’t keeping Rosie in place, John reached over and rested his hand lightly on Sherlock’s. He felt an intake of breath from the other man, but he did not pull away. Neither of them spoke. John did not even dare to look at Sherlock, instead keeping his eyes fixated on the screen, but unable to think of anything except for Sherlock’s warm touch, all his awareness concentrated in that small patch of skin on skin.
However, if we want to go deeper we should look at where that quote comes from. I’ve given a few epigraphs to this section to show where the quote comes from – first the book of Ecclesiastes, then
And suddenly, a whole host of feelings burst upon him, as though from behind a floodgate. Feelings that he could not voice or understand, but which he hoped Mary could. Feelings of belonging, of home, of love, and of need, stronger than he had ever felt before. He clasped Rosie inadvertently tighter, letting go when she let out a yelp. The feelings washed over him as quickly as they had come.
The symbol of water runs through TAB as well as s4 – others have written fantastic meta on why water represents Sherlock’s subconscious (

co-stars Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton, an episode which pulls this off marvellously, although with a big cn: for death. In this moment in
A note here: most of the time in EMP theory, I think John represents Sherlock’s heart, and I try to refer to John as heart!John as much as possible when that’s the case. There are a few cases which are different, but most notable are when the blog comes up – then John becomes John the blogger, and our symbolism shifts over to the repressive features of the original stories and how that’s playing out in the modern world. Although a pain to analyse sometimes, I find it incredibly neat that the two of them are bound up in John as source of both love and pain, which fits our story beautifully.
I’m not going to pause over the next moment of importance for too long because many have covered it – let’s just notice that Sherlock’s face is overlaid with a smashed Thatcher bust, and remind ourselves that these are the walls of homophobia in Sherlock’s brain. Also note that this matches the half-face overlay of the water in the previous scene, linking the two (although the scene with Ajay later will cement that anyway).
century specifically to deal with the consequences of his romantic and sexual feelings. There’s a parallel here with Mofftiss time jumping; back when they made A Study in Twink in 2009, there was a reason they made the time jump. Having Sherlock’s psyche have that touch of self-awareness helps to illustrate why they made a similar jump, also dealing with the weight of previous adaptations.
canon divergence from the shooting scene onwards.
. It’s supposed to be explaining what is happening in the real world – and Mofftiss realised that this was going to be difficult to stomach, and so they included TAB as a kind of key to the rest of the EMP, which becomes much more complex.
. The first is that, like
This is one of the reasons that the year 1895 is so important; it was the year of Oscar Wilde’s trial and imprisonment for gross indecency, and this is clearly a preoccupation of Sherlock’s consciousness in TFP with its constant Wilde references, suggesting that his MP’s choice of 1895 wasn’t coincidental. Much was made during TAB setlock of a newspaper that said ‘Heimish The Ideal Husband’, Hamish being John’s middle name and
Rosie started to call out, incoherent once more but clearly pointing at the blocks, and John, laughing, put her down to let her continue playing with them. Sherlock gazed on the innocent child, not expecting to feel John’s strong arms pull him into a hug. A hug. John never hugged. Sherlock steadied himself as he embraced him back, trying not to let that familiar smell overpower him as he inhaled John’s scent. He felt the shorter man’s forehead brush against the bottom of his face, and Sherlock had to resist the urge to kiss it. He simply closed his eyes and embraced John tighter. A moment, he reflected, for the Mind Palace. A memory for when he is gone.
“What are you doing?”
“If you go out like that and get hypothermia – Mrs. Hudson will kill you.”
Molly sighed. “Yes, Sherlock. Most families do. I don’t even know why you’re bothering asking me – you have actually celebrated Christmas before.” She locked the locker door and began to stride towards the exit, but Sherlock evenly intercepted her once more.
“Well I can’t get you nothing – just give me a clue, for God’s sake, there’s not much time before the shops all close.”
And finally, the much discussed ending to this show – death waits for all of us, but can it be avoided – as London turns into the water which drowns out Benedict Cumberbatch’s face. We’re only going deeper.
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now…
With this in mind, let’s delve back into the MP to see how that might give this moment greater emotional significance. Chapter 10 X is on the hug scene, and that will deal with John’s revelation of his infidelity in greater detail. For the moment, the most important thing to remember is that John Watson is not real!John – he is heart!John. In other words, we are seeing a similarly heterosexualised re-enactment of Sherlock’s relationship with John.
The next section on our whistle-stop tour is Christmas with Mummy and Daddy. Plenty of people have pointed out how Mummy and Daddy are very clear mirrors for our boys – you can see here

This chapter of the meta is going to deal with the various times we meet Eurus
. It is a masterpiece that investigates queerness, the canon and the psyche all within an hour and a half. Huge amounts of work has been done on this episode, however, so I’m not going to do a line by line breakdown – that could fill a small book. A great starting point for understanding the myriad of references in TAB is Rebekah’s three part video series on the episode, of which the first instalment can be found here
Rosie was playing on the floor with some alphabet blocks that Mummy Holmes had dropped around a couple of weeks before; she knew the flat was not large and was careful not to overload them with possessions, but had offloaded several of Sherlock and Mycroft’s old toys onto Rosie over the last few months. She had long resigned herself to a lack of grandchildren from her boys; Mycroft had always been disdainful of the prospect, and Sherlock… Well. He didn’t know what she thought there. But he had a suspicion that she knew. Mothers always do.
. And, canonically, he’s right. If we follow acd!canon, Mary is not meant to be an assassin, but more importantly for HLV, she’s also supposed to save her husband. She’s meant to be all-out devoted shoot-Magnussen type – but instead she shoots Sherlock. When John says that, then, it’s not just a nod to an updated show – it’s a genuine problem that Sherlock has to contend with, because in neither acd!Mary scenario nor housemaid!Mary scenario is she obeying the framework of a woman who loves her husband. This failing marriage is not in the stories, it’s not supposed to happen, and things that come outside of established canon come outside of Sherlock’s pre-programmed mould – we can think of this as a way of thinking about our own childhood programming to be straight/cis/etc., but in a more self-conscious, literary way!
Molly shook her head. “Well, sort of. Just one of those small, desk ones. Fake. But I put little decorations on it. Toby would fight a real one all day.” Sherlock looked at her, uncomprehensive. “My cat.”
Jim’s merging with Emelia calls to mind for me what I think might be the most important visual of all of series 4 – Eurus and Jim’s Christmas meeting, where they dance in circles with the glass between them and seem to merge into each other. I do talk about this in a later chapter, but TLDR – if Jim represents John being in danger and Eurus represents decades of repressed gay trauma, this merging is what draws the trauma to the surface just as Jim’s help is what suddenly makes Eurus a problem. It is John’s being in danger which makes Sherlock’s trauma suddenly spike and rise – he has to confront this for the first time – just like Emelia Ricoletti’s case from 1895 only needs solving for the first time now that Jim is back.
Sherlock vanishing from the hospital bed, despite being nearly dead, is pretty much medically impossible, and is probably the first impossible thing that we see happen in EMP – but it should be a red flag that that’s where we are. It’s also nice and symbolic of his movement away from that surface level, a level which we see him return to briefly in the hospital scenes in TLD when he realises his place in John’s heart. Touching stuff.
