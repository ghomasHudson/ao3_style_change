It had been building slowly since he forced himself out of bed that morning. Sitting in the back of his mind like some insidious toad, biding its time, waiting to strike at the worst possible moment. A weight on his chest, tightening and releasing as he forced his mind to other tasks, ignoring the shadow that danced on his nerves. The edges were beginning to fray, but still, he pursued any activity than the one where he had to look that beast in the face.
“Okay. I’ll see you this afternoon, then,” Sherlock said and John gave a quick nod, then turned and hurried down the hallway. When he got to the kitchen he looked over his shoulder.
“It’s just hard, for me. You get that, right? It’s hard for me, all of this. I trusted you and then you just...left. And I want to believe you that you didn’t have a choice or another option. But it’s hard.”
Sherlock chuckled softly and smiled at him.
Molly eyed him, and did the courtesy of ignoring his gaff as he had ignored hers.
“I like that. Us being a family.”
“I didn’t know that,” John replied, wondering at himself why he never asked where the song came from. “Were you close to her?”
“Is there more?”
John turned to her with a smile at that.
Sherlock grabbed his hand, leading him through the kitchen and into his bedroom at the end of the hallway. When they entered the bedroom, Sherlock turned and pressed him into the wall beside the open door, one strong thigh pushing between his legs and John groaned at the contact as Sherlock pressed open mouth kisses into his neck.
“Sherlock Holmes, you seem guilty about something,” John said, a mischievous glint in his eyes, and Sherlock found himself in that odd mix of aroused and frustrated he got when John showed off how much he had learned about the science of deduction and observation. “You closed it pretty quickly when I came in. Almost like you don’t want me to know what you were doing.” He was smirking.
John’s brows shot up and he looked at his friend. Then his friend’s empty glass.
“Sherlock, it’s fine. Just...forget this night, okay? Delete it,” he quickly said, trying to salvage what he could of what he was terrified was the ending of their friendship.
John pushed back into Sherlock, then, guiding him back to the bed as they shared kisses that were far more gentle than John would have expected in that moment. When Sherlock’s knees hit the mattress, John pushed one more kiss against his lips before he pulled back.
“Yes, well, he needed to go home,” he replied.
John stared at him as his mind began to race with everything Sherlock had said.
“Oddly enough, no.”
“I was doing research,” Sherlock explained.
So, John played music when Sherlock was out because he could no longer stand the sound of silence. He didn’t like to feel like he was alone in the flat and the music pouring out through the speakers gave him an illusion of company. Sherlock never mentioned it to John and John never bothered explaining why he would turn the music off when Sherlock returned home.
“John.”
“I’d rather stand,” he replied, his tone matching the coolness from the stranger in front of him. He didn’t want to play games tonight. “Who are you? What do you want?”
“Will you spend the rest of your life with me, Sherlock?”
“Are you questioning my math?” Sherlock challenged and a trace of annoyance colored his tone.
“You love me,” Sherlock said, a small smile pulling at his lips, as he let John look at him.
John did. He completely understood. Sherlock had just put into impossible words the emotions he never knew how to describe. He felt like Sherlock had pried open his chest, sliced open his heart, and examined it under his microscope. Found all the hidden recesses that were filled with affection and love and loyalty and devotion to the man before him. But these were Sherlock’s words. Sherlock, who felt more deeply than he ever let the world know, but who never could truly hide behind the facade he built around himself. How could John even respond to that?
This photo, though, with John smiling like that, felt like a kick to the gut. It was a reminder that they weren’t there. John still didn’t smile quite like that.
Rosie nodded her agreement to his statement. “I found a new snail, too! Maybe Ice Cream and the new one can be friends!”
“You are clever.”
Mycroft looked at John and forced a smile that clearly pained him.
When he gave his razor a final rinse through the warm tap water and then returned it to its customary spot, he noticed that Sherlock was no longer there. He couldn’t recall when the man had left. Perhaps he had actually gone to pick up milk.
John grabbed one of their beach towels from earlier and walked out to the bench set in the corner of the garden. The moon was heavy and full in the sky and John could clearly make his way through the garden without tripping on loose stones or clumps of earth. The bench was surrounded by a variety of flowers that had closed after the sun had gone down. It was still wet from the rain, so John wiped it down before folding the towel and laying it on the little table beside the bench.
When he made it back to the kitchen he saw that Sherlock had already plated the food, and it all looked as wonderful as it smelled. There was fluffy basmati rice, chicken tikka masala with its rich burnt orange sauce, and what looked like homemade naan. John looked up at Sherlock as he stood behind his chair. Sherlock was pouring a deep red wine into each of their glasses, but he felt John’s eyes on him and met his gaze.
It was perfect. He had everything he wanted.
He turned his attention back to the telly. Saw that it was indeed bells on the program Mrs. Hudson had turned on.
When he finally did and made it into the kitchen, he found Sherlock pouring two glasses from the wine bottle they opened at dinner.
“About the engagement?”
“But it’s Thursday,” Sherlock argued.
“I know many things.”
“Who is he?” he asked.
John was so lost in thought that he missed the sound of Sherlock coming up the stairs and nearly jumped in surprise when the man pushed his bedroom door open and closed it carefully behind him. Sherlock’s hair was still a bit wet, curls heavy and glossy on his head, but he had changed into dry clothes.
There. Now John got to be the bearer of good news. He would get to reveal the culprit to Alex and be placed in the role of the hero of the non-profit clinic and its missing funds. The proverbial ball was in John’s court, now, and Sherlock was well aware that John was a very good player. The trail of satisfied women (at least sexually) that the man had in his wake was proof enough for that. He assumed the men that John had been with had been left equally satisfied.
Sherlock had started to feel confused by this exchange, which was decidedly an unfamiliar and frankly annoying feeling. Why was John acting like this about someone who must be a former classmate? They were of an age and since they were of similar professions, it was most likely that they went to university together, though it was possible they knew each other from an even younger age. John wasn’t acting as if he didn’t like this Alexander person. If anything he seemed flustered by his appearance in their living room. It was almost as if he was afraid of something, but that didn’t make any sense. He had never known John to be afraid of anything, and besides, Sherlock couldn’t detect anything threatening about the man at all.
He wasn’t sure what was wrong. He was perfectly capable of reading and following directions, but apparently, when they came in the form of a recipe, that ability became nonexistent and he was left standing in the ruins.
His mind was buzzing through the proposal as his spun the ring on his finger. John wanted to marry him. He wanted to build a life with him. He trusted him with his daughter. Sherlock loved Rosie as if she were his own, and now she would be. His heart pounded in his chest as he forced himself to keep his breaths even and calm.
Sherlock didn’t say anything, so John bent down to pick up the bag that had dropped.
With John safely ensconced in his bedroom, Sherlock rose from his chair at the kitchen table and made his way to the sofa. He needed to think. He briefly considered the nicotine patches that sat in an old biscuit tin, but ultimately decided against them. John didn’t like when he used them and it would have been too distracting to know that while actively thinking about John. He lay out on the sofa, adjusted the pillow there for maximum neck support, brought his hands up to steeple his fingers under his chin, and closed his eyes.
Sherlock opened his eyes and met John’s gaze. His face was open in a way it so rarely was, and John felt his stomach swoop in response. After a moment Sherlock closed his eyes again, and John convinced himself that it was nothing. Sherlock likely didn’t know any of the lyrics to these songs, and it was just coincidental timing.
“A drug’s bust,” he replied, and Sherlock mentally cursed the DI. Drugs bust. He had to say drugs bust. Couldn’t he see that he was trying to impress the doctor? John wasn’t likely to want to move in with a junkie, even if it was a clean former junkie. He closed his eyes as John’s voice called out behind him.
“I hope you haven’t been letting Joy chew on these branches.”
“That…”
Sherlock stepped closer to him, but not close enough to reach out and touch, not yet.
“I hate repeating myself. I’m trying to explain that statistically sharing a flat with a relative stranger,” the man began but was cut off by the sound of heavy footsteps running up the stairs. Definitely not the elderly landlady.
Could it really be that simple of a misunderstanding? Throughout all of these years?
Sherlock eyed him for a silent moment while John forced himself to remain still before the detective gave him a small nod. “Good,” he said.
He took it with a smile and a nod. He sniffed at the ruby-red drink before taking a small sip. Gin and cranberry and something fizzy sparked on his tongue. It was a bit too sweet for his tastes, but he wasn’t going to complain when he hadn’t been the one to pay for it.
“I hardly think that waitress counts.”
Things like that changed a man. John knew that. And the more John observed, he saw the subtle changes in Sherlock that weren’t merely related to the passage of time or his physical injuries.
Rosie shifted between them, and John lifted his hand to brush back the curls from her eyes as she settled into a new position. His hand then reached out tentatively to brush the curls from Sherlock’s eyes, as well. Sherlock leaned into the touch.
“Thank you, John.” Sherlock blew across the surface of the steaming liquid before he took a careful sip and John had to force himself to look away from the pout of Sherlock’s lips as he did so.
When his breathing was once again calm, Sherlock let his eyes drift away from John’s steady gaze. John’s hand gently grasped his chin, turning his head so he could finish shaving the other side of Sherlock’s face. Calm, measured, confident swipes. His eyes fell closed again as he concentrated on the tactile feel of the blade raking over his skin.
The idea of getting on Tube while more than half-drunk wasn’t at all appealing, so he hailed a cab and a true Christmas miracle was performed.
She had coo’d and aww’d over the dog the whole morning, ignoring every comment John made on it being a temporary arrangement while he tried to find either her owners or someone to care for her.
John’s hand on his curls tightened, just a touch, and he moaned deep in his throat, then let go of his nipple and stole John’s mouth again in a bruising kiss. John’s hand slipped from his curls to his jaw to angle his head to deepen the kiss, and Sherlock’s hands grasped John’s hips and pulled him closer. John broke the kiss and pulled just far enough away to look into his eyes. Sherlock felt more naked under that gaze than a lack of clothing would account for.
“No,” John replied quickly, clearly offended.
“John, stop messing about. We need to go.”
“I’d hate to disappoint her after she went through the trouble of moving it.”
Sherlock eyed him for a moment, then placed the board in the basket he had already filled with a few lunch and snack items. John walked over and found a few water bottles to toss in the basket, and an ice pack in the freezer to help keep everything cold while Sherlock continued to look through the fridge.
“Do what?”
Not a complete lie. It did just come to him, it was just much earlier in the day when it did. He had figured it out after he had read through Alex’s old blog, then skimmed through the fundraiser site he had found when he was waiting for John to dress after his shower. A couple of minutes on his mobile, just confirming things while the he was in the taxi earlier, and he found everything he needed. He wasn’t about to confess all of that to John, though.
John’s attention fluctuated between the movie and the woman at his side, who John couldn’t help but notice smelled very nicely, especially when her hair brushed over her shoulders as she leaned closer for another bite of popcorn. Some kind of flower, he thought. Jasmine or gardenia, maybe. Whatever it was, she smelled lovely.
“Of course, dear,” she said, and John watched as she splashed just enough tea into a cup of milk to change the color, along with a small spoonful of sugar. She cut her eyes at John before giving a wink. “It is Christmas, after all.”
“May I?” he asked and when she nodded he plucked the piece from her small palm and ran his thumb over the smoothed edges. “Beautiful, Rose. You’ll have to start a collection,” he told her with a smile before handing it back to her.
They sat in the back of the taxi, silent but content, for the rest of the ride to Baker Street. When they arrived, they climbed out and grabbed John’s possessions from the boot. Sherlock pulled a key out of his pocket and handed it to John.
His chest felt tight at the feeling and he sniffed hard to get his emotions under control before he began to make his way to the counter to pay. Right before he got there, though, he spotted a small collection of cookbooks.
“I’m afraid if I don’t say this now then I never will, and that isn’t fair to you or to me. Not anymore.” Sherlock took a deep breath, then looked up at John. “Yesterday evening. At the ice cream shoppe. That woman. You didn’t correct her when she assumed we were together. Why?”
“What about inhumanly?”
“Indian?” she asked as she made her way to the electric kettle to make a cup of tea.
“Wow, a few months and you made that? I’m impressed.”
“My number is on the website. Never know when someone might recognize it,” he explained, sort of, and John sighed quietly before he stepped closer and handed Sherlock his phone.
“Tell me what?” John asked almost nervously. He felt himself teetering on the knife-edge of wanting to know whatever it was and wanting to run away from whatever it could be that had Sherlock looking at him like that.
When he made his way to the kitchen he noticed the smell of bleach, but it wasn’t until he walked in that he noticed the counters and table were clean. Spotless. He walked to the refrigerator and pulled it open. The sharp scent of bleach flooded his nostrils as the soft white light illuminated the clean shelves. There was milk, and butter, and a sandwich on a plate wrapped in cellophane.
“About what?” John asked, thrown by the random reply.
“Where have you been?”
Silence descended again and John finished his tea. Sherlock’s legs were now bouncing, unable to sit still. Sherlock had always been like that. Either completely still or constantly in motion. No in-between. John put the cup down and took a deep breath.
John huffed a laugh at that and turned his head away to hide his smile. Sherlock turned to hide his smile as well.
“Sherlock, no. I already told you no, and I’ll tell you again. No, I am not moving in with you,” John said, a hint of fond exasperation in his voice.
John’s hands were gentle on his face again as his thumbs traced under his cheekbones and the look on his face was full of desire, yes, but also wonder, as if Sherlock were something precious and he couldn’t believe he was allowed to touch him like this. He had never felt so treasured before.
As always, comments and kudos are treasured and adored.
John held Sherlock’s gaze, unable to look away, even as his heart pounded frantically in his chest.
He tried to ignore it, but the thing growing in John’s chest felt horribly like hope and he didn’t know what to do with such an emotion anymore.
Sherlock’s eyes were closed as he swayed to the music he played as it filled the room with the smooth sound of Coldplay’s
“So many times I’ve thought about your cock, John. Tried to deduce you. What you looked like, the shape and feel of you, what you would taste like. I’ve had so many fantasies about finding out. Coming up with experiments that would give me a reason to look at you. Hold you in my hand like this,” Sherlock whispered in his ear, his hand tight and giving a delicious twist on the upstroke.
“You’ve been acting a bit off and you’ve been sneezing,” John calmly replied.
He felt Sherlock’s eyes on him, but he kept his face turned away, and took another sip of his coffee. When he went to take a bite of his muffin, he did the same crumb evading maneuver Sherlock had a moment before but wasn’t nearly as successful. He brushed awkwardly at his shirt with his hand holding the muffin, but that did nothing except shake more crumbs onto his shirt. He sighed in exasperation, but his breath caught when Sherlock’s hand reached out and gently wiped the mess away, long fingers pressing lightly into his skin through the thin material of his shirt.
Sherlock stood by the fireplace, silent. John could feel his eyes on him and just couldn’t look up. So much for bravery.
John took that as all the invitation he needed. He wrapped a hand around Sherlock’s cock, taking in the feel of the silky smooth skin, the heft of him, before he leaned forward. He looked up, unsurprised to find Sherlock’s eyes on him, and kept contact as he wrapped his lips around the head of Sherlock’s cock.
Sherlock nodded and leaned back onto the couch. “Who goes first?”
John dragged himself to the bathroom to finish his nighttime routine, then went back to his room and climbed on to the bed. He stretched out on top of the duvet with his arms behind his head and listened to the sound of the rain lashing against the window as he stared unseeing up at the ceiling. His thoughts kept circling back to the kiss in the garden. Sherlock’s lips soft and pliant under his, the taste of him on his tongue, the feel of his body under his hands, the silkiness of curls between his fingers.
“Did you get hurt, boy?” he asked, scratching gently at the dog's ears. “No, wait, girl.”
He was spooning sugar in the second teacup before he realized what he was doing. A little over 24 hours and he was already falling into old patterns. He shook his head at himself, but lifted the cup and took it into the living room anyway. He placed Sherlock’s cup down on the table and sat down in his armchair to watch Sherlock.
John blinked up at her. Immediately, “We’re not a couple” jumped to his head, to the tip of his tongue, the years-old response to those who read more into his relationship with Sherlock than was there. It was a response born out of frustration. They weren’t a couple, never had been, no matter what his feelings on the matter were. He was content with their friendship and having it thrown into his face that they weren’t more, always hurt more than he would ever admit.
“Anything you can give me.”
“Well, it’s Valentine’s Day. Cupid and love and all that. Everyone is thinking about sex and fantasies today.”
“That’s a pretty big claim,” John said.
The atmosphere of the pub hovered on the edge of uncomfortably loud, and crowded, and warm, but that same atmosphere offered the distraction he needed after the day he had. That, and the third pint he was working his way through.
When he heard Sherlock coming down the stairs he picked up Sherlock’s cup. He held it out to him when Sherlock rounded the corner, and his long fingers brushed gently over John’s shorter digits, causing the now familiar tingle that zipped along his nerves at every casual touch they shared over the years.
“Ah, John, you’re here. Can I borrow your phone? I need to send a text,” Sherlock’s deep voice came from the sofa, and John found him lying there in complete repose.
“Reckon we should head back in a bit. Get swimsuits and enjoy a proper beach stay.”
“Sherlock. I don’t understand how you managed to do that.”
When John entered the living room, it was to the sight of Rosie fast asleep on the couch with her new doll and a warm blanket tucked around her small form while Sherlock stood in front of the fire, admiring the Christmas cards that were arranged upon the mantle.
That was three years ago. There had been some adjustments to the flat with the addition of a baby, then a toddler, but Sherlock took it all in stride and never seemed to regret his decision to have them move in. He played his violin at reasonable hours and often to help Rosie calm when she was crying or sleepy, didn’t shoot the walls, kept body parts in a small fridge in his bedroom, kept his experiments in places a small toddler couldn’t reach when it became necessary, and often watched Rosie on his own when John had shifts at the clinic because Sherlock hated the idea of Rosie in daycare.
“You will be talking when I get back up here.”
He slammed the laptop lid closed, then put it down on the table beside the cold tea and stood up, irritated at the tea, the phone, the laptop, the case, and himself for being irritated at any of it at all. He was used to being irritated with the world at large and its idiotic occupants. It was a newer feeling to be irritated with his own self. He made his way through the kitchen and down the hallway to his bedroom to grab his mobile. It pinged again just as he reached it and he quickly tapped in his passcode and unlocked the screen.
“Sherlock...what is all this?” he asked, his arm flinging out sideways to encompass the flowers, the meanings behind them. Everything.
The flowers. They were apologies and pleas for forgiveness.
Heavy puffs of breath moved against his head as Sherlock’s breathing slowly returned to normal, but the taller man kept his arms wrapped tightly around him. John delighted in the feel of Sherlock’s heart beating wildly inside his chest as they held each other, their bodies calming together. He pressed his lips against Sherlock’s neck again, then worked up his jaw until he stole his mouth in another kiss.
The lower register of Alex Campbell’s voice drifted through the open door. “I’m glad you found someone, Johnny. You deserve to be happy.”
“Fine. I need tea, first,” John said and turned away from him and stepped into the kitchen.
His coworkers were nice enough, he supposed. He hadn’t really spent much time getting to know them beyond the required workplace niceties in the weeks he had spent working there before he was invited to a pub night. One of the nurses had made a point of inviting him and explaining how they tried to get together once every month or two in an effort to build a sense of camaraderie between them. John rather thought it sounded like complete shite. He had been a soldier. He knew all about building camaraderie with your fellow soldiers and he rather thought a single pub night wasn’t likely to ever be enough for that, but he also didn’t have any real reason to decline other than being the sad sod he knew himself to be. He wanted to decline. He had no desire to go out with these people he hardly knew and drink a beer in a crowded or noisy pub between other people he didn’t know, but he found himself nodding and accepting anyway.
This wouldn’t be the end of his embarrassment, though, of course not. As he was trying to sweep up some of the mess back into the bucket, his date leaning down to try and add her hands into the cleaning mix, the cause of his initial distress determined now was the perfect time to make sure John knew that he was there.
When they arrived at Mrs. Moo’s, there was a decent-sized queue, so they took their place to wait.
“Why not?”
“What? When I asked if he was seeing anyone?” John asked and Sherlock nodded. John seemed to realize when he had left, but he didn’t know how much Sherlock had heard of their conversation before that point.
They had stumbled through the door of 221B in the early hours of the morning, riding the high of a successful evening chasing the criminals of London along its dark streets. John had made his way to the kitchen to get the kettle started for tea as the inevitable exhaustion that followed these types of evenings began to creep along the edges of the adrenaline that still coursed through his veins.
Sherlock shifted closer on the couch, one hand reaching out to thread his fingers through the hair at the back of John’s head, and gently pulled him closer. John adjusted easily as he leaned in to meet Sherlock’s lips in a kiss. Gentle pressure encouraged mouths to open and the kiss deepened as they sat pressed tightly together.
“Quite so.”
“I wasn’t complaining,” John chuckled and put down his still hot tea to accept the glass Sherlock held out to him instead.
“What on earth for, John?”
John’s thigh warmed Sherlock’s cold feet while they sat quietly as the film played on as background noise that neither of them listened to.
There wasn’t time to dwell on all of it, though. Sherlock was on the computer attempting to track the victim’s phone to geo-locate her killer and the flat was thrown into chaos between the two bickering men, the several other officers conducting the supposed drugs bust, and Mrs. Hudson who repeatedly interrupted everything to tell Sherlock that his taxi was here and the cabbie was getting very irritated at being kept waiting.
“Sherlock.”
“I have plenty of ornaments we could use to spruce this old tree up a bit, love.”
Unfortunately, the pub was about as awful as he had anticipated. Whether it was a self-fulfilling prophecy or not was beyond the point. He found himself tucked into a booth between one of his fellow doctors and one of the clinic’s receptionists, sipping on a lukewarm beer, and he wasn’t completely confident that he could recall the names of anyone that he was sitting with and worked with on a daily basis.
not knowing.
“Sherlock, there were eyeballs in your microwave,” he said, going for levity instead of the more serious reasons for his objections for moving in. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to live at Baker Street. It was an effort to save what small part of his heart Sherlock hadn’t already stolen in the months they’d known each other. He was already arse over tits for the man. If he spent even more time with him, he knew there would be no coming back from it. He would be well and truly in love with him, and that was a dangerous thing to be.
“You know, for not being her biological parent, I think she’s more like you than me,” he laughed.
He walked around the main room as he carefully pulled open drawers and looked at files. It was all in order. He decided to go further in, to pull up the video files of interactions they had had over the years.
“Me too.”
Sherlock’s hand traced down John’s body, fingertips learning every texture and curve, memorizing until he reached his destination and his hand closed over both their cocks and gripped firmly. He gave a long, leisurely stroke, which caused John to buck up against him.
They both fell quiet after that and remained that way for the remainder of the taxi ride. Sherlock found himself in the rather unanticipated situation of being surprised by someone. No one had ever called his deductions extraordinary before. Especially when they were about them. That was...different. Interesting. He glanced at the smaller man beside him, eyes narrowed thoughtfully, but then the taxi pulled up outside the crime scene and they climbed out of the car and made their way to the police tape.
Unfortunately, John is very forcibly reminded that it’s difficult to keep the man out of his thoughts as Sherlock comes swooping into the theater that he was currently sitting in. John quickly tried to hide behind the man sitting in front of him, accidentally sending his bucket of popcorn tumbling from his lap to scatter its contents all across the floor. Naturally, this was a homing beacon for attention to be sent his way as he made a ridiculous amount of noise for a man trying to hide.
That had been her most recent declaration, and she was down in her flat at that moment, presumably making tea, and John had pushed himself off his chair where he had been eating his breakfast and went to find the box.
He watched as John’s pupils expanded, eyes nearly black, and he nodded. John’s hand went back into his curls as he pulled him down into a kiss. “Lube?” John asked after he pulled away.
Joy was easy to buy for, as well. He may have gone a bit overboard, actually. He had started an online cart at one of those fancy pet websites and the pricetag was at a rather embarrassingly high number considering he was buying for one dog, but he felt absolutely no regret for those impending purchases. She would love the squeaky toys and the new chew toys that could be filled with peanut butter. And the little raincoat only made since. They lived in London and purchasing his dog a raincoat just made sense. He went back and forth on the necessity of the wellies.
A chance meeting with Mike, of all people, as he wandered around London after an appointment with his Army mandated therapist would have been low on the list of things that he would have expected to happen to him. He wouldn’t have expected Mike to recognize him, to call out to him, to sit and have coffee. And he definitely wouldn’t have expected to follow him back to Bart’s and meet someone who was just as difficult to find a flatmate for as himself.
“Hm, yes, chocolate,” Sherlock answered her question. “Maybe chocolate ice cream?”
His eyes were closed as the feelings crashed over him and he let them for just that moment. He could do this. He would do this. He would do anything for John Watson.
The man took a step inside as Sherlock walked into the sitting room and crossed to his chair to sit down without properly introducing himself.
John grinned and they fell back into a comfortable silence.
“I’m glad he saved your life, John,” then, hesitant and carefully, “I thought about you all the time. I’m sorry I never wrote while you were gone.”
Sherlock leaned towards him. “Should we say anything?”
“I have matching ones for me and Rosie, as well.”
“Do you need something?” he asked. He enjoyed the feel of the lather and bubbles on his fingers as he worked the shampoo through his hair. He stood directly under the spray again to wash the shampoo out, but Sherlock continued to remain quiet.
Instead of hailing another cab, he turned and walked down the pavement. His mobile pinged with a text in his pocket, but he didn’t bother to check it. It was at least an hour walk back to Baker Street from here and he settled into his stride. The flats, shops, restaurants, people, businesses he passed were blurred and non-consequential. His stomach roiled, twisting and coiling in on itself and he rode out a wave of nausea.
“You didn’t just accidentally cook too much?”
“You’ll just have to go out and buy more.”
“What makes you think I want anything?” the oily voice of his brother came through his earpiece and he rolled his eyes.
Suddenly, he couldn’t sit any longer. He rose swiftly to his feet, crossing the room and throwing on his coat and scarf.
Then, Mrs. Hudson came through the door with a carafe full of what could only be coffee.
Sherlock’s lips quirked up suddenly, a smile playing on the edges as he thought of something, and John felt a smile pull at his own mouth. He could watch Sherlock for hours. He often did. He was sure Sherlock knew, on some level, because Sherlock saw everything. He never said anything, though, so John had decided to keep watching until he was told to stop.  It hadn’t happened yet and he figured as long as he was discreet enough about it, it wouldn’t be a problem.
“Sorry, I’ll shut up,” John replied, looking away in embarrassment, but that wasn’t what Sherlock meant to happen at all.
“Yes, that’s fine,” Sherlock agreed with a nod. “There’s ice cream in the freezer,” Sherlock smirked up at him.
“Yes,” he replied, the
John did not, in fact, like to cook.
“Mrs. Hudson, you didn’t have to make dinner,” John said.
He went back to the beginning. Not to the lab at Bart’s, but to that dinner at Angelo’s where they had sat and John insisted he wasn’t his date, but Angelo put a candle on the table anyway. They had talked, and John had asked about girlfriends and boyfriends. He had said it was good when Sherlock informed him that no, he didn’t have a boyfriend. John unconsciously (consciously?) licked his lips, which Sherlock admitted drew his attention to his mouth regardless of intention or not. “You’re unattached, like me,” John had said.
John offered her a smile in thanks and she left for her flat after another glance at Sherlock.
Sherlock turned his head to look back at him.
“I don’t even know what you wanted to ask,” John called out from behind him, but Sherlock was able to avoid giving a reply by the prompt arrival of a taxi. He climbed swiftly in and didn’t look back at the two men as it pulled away.
“Pub night. Thursday,” Sherlock responded, annoyed that he had to explain to John his own schedule.
He put the leash on the hook by the door, then tugged off his gloves and scarf and coat before placing them on their respective hooks, as well.
“I don’t know.”
“I wonder if men returned from the dead get meals on the house.”
Mycroft’s words from the day before came unbidden to his mind.
“Kind of hard to do in the city, isn’t it?”
Who the hell did he think he was? What game could he possibly be playing? There was nothing that could convince John to ever do anything for him, ever again. That bullshit about duty. John had done his duty for his country and had a hole in his shoulder and an inability to ever perform surgery again thanks to that duty. He had a fucking medal as proof of that duty completed. He didn’t owe his country, and certainly didn’t owe Mycroft Holmes, any more of his time or consideration.
“Chemistry, John. Obviously.” An eyeroll. “Sodium polyacrylate and water. Mix them together and viola! Snow.”
He ended up calling on Mike, who had a lead for a position in a clinic on the other side of the city. John didn’t want to move from 221B, no matter how many ghosts haunted it those days. He called and got an interview, anyway.
When they finally got up to head to bed, John pulled Sherlock close at the kitchen. He smiled up at him, then glanced at the entryway. Sherlock glanced up, then arched a brow.
“It turns out there’s room for more than just the Work in my life,” he stated and John bit his lip in an attempt to hold back his smile. It didn’t work.
The man watched him for a moment and no movement on his face suggested what he could possibly be thinking. “The car will take you home,” he said. “Or wherever you want to go,” he added succinctly and John turned on his heel before he could do something truly foolish, like punch that smug look off the man’s face.
“What?” John asked, bemused by the sudden turn the conversation had taken.
“Sherlock, they were out of those biscuits you like so I got,” John had begun, but then stopped as he walked out of the kitchen and took in the appearance of the other man sitting on a chair in their living room. He nearly dropped the package of biscuits he held in his hand as his eyes widened. “Alex?” John asked in quiet disbelief and Sherlock watched as John’s features quickly shifted through a myriad of emotions that he couldn’t quite track.
Just when he was about to pull his hand away because clearly he had made a mistake, he had read everything wrong, John turned his hand over under his and threaded their fingers together. He looked up for the first time since he had started down this path and his eyes locked with John’s.
Sherlock watched as John bit his bottom lip, apparently unsure or unwilling to reply to what Mr. Campbell had revealed. Then the doctor looked at him for the first time since he had exited the kitchen. He looked down at his hands as if just remembering the biscuits he still held.
“If it’s all the same to you, I’d like to just stay at the flat.”
“What locals? There’s no one else here.”
How could he ever hope to compete with Alexander Campbell? Not that there was a competition. John wasn’t interested in Sherlock that way, and knowing more about his past didn’t change that fact. Sherlock reflected that it would be convenient if his heart would jump on board with this logic, but if there was one thing he had learned for sure in his life, it was that his heart didn’t listen to his brain no matter how hard he tried. His heart was made for bleeding, and no one pierced it with more unrelenting accuracy than John.
John stared at Sherlock, his heart beating wildly in his chest at the implications in his words. He knew about them all. How? Had Mycroft been feeding him information the whole time? He wouldn’t put it past Mycroft to be spying on him. That didn’t even touch on the fact that John had often spoken at the apparently empty grave, as well. Had he been recorded? His heartbroken and honest confessions to a dead man preserved against his knowledge for any bastard who had the right clearance to listen to?
“Molly, do you have any idea how often Sherlock touches his face? Constantly. His hands are constantly on his face. And then he touches my face,” John said, then snapped his own mouth shut. “Not like that, I just mean, he’s a very physical…” he began, then stopped again. “This isn’t coming out right,” he stated simply as he ignored the flush that he felt on his cheeks.
He pulled off his coat and hung it on its hook, then climbed the stairs up to the flat. The door was shut, so he carefully opened it and mentally closed his mind to any deductions he might make when he entered. He didn’t want to confirm any of his mind's imaginings by what he might observe after he entered.
“I want to spend Christmas with you. I have a couple to make up for, I think,” Sherlock murmured quietly.
John walked around the table and held out a hand to Sherlock. Sherlock stared at it, blinking uncomprehendingly.
Sherlock hated the way John’s voice hitched up as he forced the words through a tight throat. He could hear the way John was choking back tears. Sherlock had forgiven him and John had yet to truly forgive himself. John had been attending therapy of his own choice for his anger issues and Sherlock had gone, as well.
He pulled back after a moment. “I’ll get a towel to clean us up,” he said, but Sherlock shook his head and pulled John back down.
“You missed it because you didn’t follow the list.”
“It’s laundry day,” he replied airly, and turned to go towards another window.
As they kissed, the song continued playing softly from the inside of Sherlock’s pocket.
He did a turn in the middle of the sitting room. Already the flat felt more like home than his old one ever did, but there was something missing. He frowned in thought as he stared at the mantelpiece above the cold fireplace.
John smiled as he carefully twisted a curl at the back of Sherlock’s head around his finger.
“Were attracted,” John clarified. “ We were attracted. Of course, we were attracted to each other. We were together for nearly 3 years.”
John could easily see it. A young Sherlock with dark wild curls, running about the beach, brandishing a wooden cutlass while hunting for his treasures. It was a charming image and he appreciated that Sherlock felt comfortable enough to share that glimpse into his past. Sherlock rarely spoke of any of the time before John entered into his life. His childhood and time as a young adult were as much of a mystery as the man had been when they first met. He’d learned to read Sherlock over the years, at least a bit. Or so he liked to think. But in truth, he was still an enigma that John couldn’t completely understand.
“What is it, love?”
“Fact.”
“Four serial suicides and now a note! Oh, it’s Christmas!” Sherlock grabbed his coat and scarf off the sofa he had thrown it on earlier and quickly pulled them on. “I’ll be out late. Might need some food.”
Rosie found the pickle ornament after several encouraging hints from Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson while John went to cook up a full English fit for Christmas morning. The pop and sizzle of bacon and sausages filled the kitchen as he sliced tomatoes and opened a tin of beans to heat on the hob. He filled the kettle with water to make tea and listened to Rosie as she played with her new toys, the excitement of finding the pickle already faded.
Sherlock stared at him for a long time before providing the barest suggestion of a nod.
John stood there, leaning heavily on his cane, as Mrs. Hudson tutted and shook her head. She said something, but John wasn’t listening and was unable to answer her.
“You can since you wanted to play.”
“Daddy, thunder,” Rosie called out, tears thick in her voice, from the doorway and John groaned into Sherlock’s neck for a very different reason than he had a moment ago.
“You and your facts,” John grumbled good-naturedly before turning around as he caught up to Rosie.
“Goodnight, love,” he whispered into dark curls that tickled his lips and smelled of expensive shampoo.
“I have four going. Time. They all need time.”
Sherlock’s smile quirked up again and John watched silently, one finger absently stroking along his bottom lip.
“Hey Johnny,” Alexander Campbell returned in a much softer voice than before, and Sherlock was immediately on the proverbial edge of his seat. No one called John “Johnny”, except for Harry. He hated it. Or at least, Sherlock thought he did.
He leaned forward and pressed a gentle kiss to Sherlock’s lips in an attempt to convey every joyful and blissful thought in his head and heart. Sherlock sighed into the kiss before pulling away and turning so his back pressed into John’s chest.
“Probably be for the best if you didn’t have an imagination,” John responded with an answering smile.
“Indeed.”
“There you are darling, I’ve been looking everywhere,” a deep voice boomed out, and it took all of John’s self control to not shove the person away.
Sherlock hesitated a moment, his gaze flickering to John before he turned back to the silver-haired man and nodded. “I’ll follow behind. Where at?”
It was gentle and chaste and over far too quickly. Sherlock pulled back and looked into John’s eyes.
“Molly knew,” Sherlock said after a few minutes of quiet as they both ate. John looked up at him curiously.
It was an unfamiliar feeling. Needing someone. Wanting someone. And he did want him. As a flatmate and friend, yes, but the more time they spent together, the more the idea of John’s precise hands on his skin invaded his thoughts. Hands that caressed flesh for the purpose of pleasure rather than healing. The hair on the back of his neck rose as his mind supplied images and sensations and he suppressed a delightful shiver. He forced his attention back to the present and the man in front of him.
The cold would be worse.
He could love Sherlock, and Sherlock could care for him in his way, and it was both enough, but not enough.
“I’ve never cared for a dog before. I don’t know the first thing about caring for them.”
Mycroft forged on. “I need you to protect Sherlock.”
“Thanks for coming, Sherlock,” he said, eyebrows raised in question. “Where’s John?”
They pulled back for a breath and John bent his mouth to Sherlock’s neck, pressing kisses and gentle bites into that porcelain skin as he had so often imagined.
“Charming dog, Dr. Watson.”
Sherlock sniffed delicately, a large hand coming up to flick invisible lint, or muffin crumbs, from his shirt front.
“Manners, miss,” John reminded her while she jumped up and down as they continued to walk.
“Why are you repeating me? Yes, a candy cane murderer.”
Sherlock looked down into John’s dark blue eyes and saw no hint of jest or teasing in them, but rather an almost shy hopefulness. They had danced before, of course. Several times, which might be odd if he thought about it, but their relationship was not exactly what people would call normal. Something about John’s expression at that moment, though, was different. There wasn’t a case that required dancing or a wedding that needed a first dance.
It was silent for a moment, the only sound their quiet breathing and the noise of midnight London outside the window. John knew it was a risk saying what he said. Confessing to Sherlock how much he hoped for, but he couldn’t imagine not taking the chance to speak his feelings after being given the opportunity. He felt like if he didn’t say anything, he might never get another chance.
“No, Daddy kisses for ‘Lock!” she explained with the patience of a 3-year-old dealing with slow adults, and John rolled his eyes. He stepped closer to his friend and rose to his toes to kiss his friend’s cheek. John tried to not focus on how Sherlock’s skin felt under his lips, or the way his hair smelled of the expensive honey conditioner he used. Rosie squealed in delight as he finally did what she wanted, and he forced all his attention on her, trying to ignore the way he noticed Sherlock’s cheeks flush up a lovely pink at the kiss.
By the time John had shut off the water and toweled off, Sherlock was already gone and he was left standing with a towel around his waist in the middle of their empty living room.
“No.”
“Sherlock, there were eyeballs in your microwave,” John explained and Sherlock rolled his eyes. This had been John’s excuse the last three times he asked and it was getting tedious because he knew that it wasn’t the real reason.
“Everything, John,” he whispered against his mouth, and John nodded.
Mrs. Hudson was somewhat trickier. He wanted to get something thoughtful for her. Somehow, and God only knew how, his landlady had become an integral member of his life. One of the only integral members of his life, really. She had been there for him when he most needed a friend, and he was grateful to her. Yes, she occasionally overshared, she wasn’t shy about laying on guilt trips, and she always implied things that just weren’t true about John and his relationship to a certain curly-haired man, but she was quiet when John felt the need to talk, and would hold his hand in her smaller one when he couldn’t find the words, and made sure he ate when he couldn’t be bothered to feed himself. She took care of him without coddling him and she was possibly the only reason he hadn’t completely faded away into the shadows.
Sherlock had steadily fallen back into his chair at Mrs. Hudson’s revelation. He had absolutely no idea that John had dated anyone while he was gone. He hadn’t even known for sure that John was bisexual until yesterday, yet here sat their landlady, casually informing him that not only did he date, but that he went on several dates, with men. And apparently, the doctor had a type. Tall and ginger. This was definitely going to ravage his Mind Palace organization.
“You sure?”
“Thank you, sweetheart,” he said, “and you’re the best Rosie in the whole wide world.”
Sherlock had even been the one to interview nannies and find one who could meet their sporadic needs so John could continue to join him in the Work.
“No,” he replied honestly. “I don’t. I am, however, a very observant man which I’m sure comes as no surprise to you.”
“How old were you?”
Sherlock was gone, but the city he loved, the city they both loved, was still there. It just kept going on whether they were there to live in it, to breathe it in, or not. There was something comforting in that.
“Shut up and try that.”
“Oh, I didn’t see that. I’m going to look for more!” she proclaimed before she grabbed the bucket and ran back off to the waterline.
“You simply lack imagination, John.”
“I suppose you’re right. Too much baggage.”
“It doesn’t matter, now. He did, and now he’s back, and apparently needs help.”
There was no milk for his tea, but that was alright. He sat down at the small table in his room and took a moment to just sit and relax. His eyes took in the room, the window with its pulled back curtain, the brick of the wall adjacent to his. He actually felt a bit funny, if he were being honest with himself. Almost like he was having an out of body experience. He was not exactly the type of person who just did things like book a flight and leave the country for no real reason, but here he was, sitting in a rented room in a flat for a week, having done just that.
“She’s a child. Of course, she enjoyed a cartoon.”
“Stay on the sand, Rose!” he called after her, then turned his attention to Sherlock who was turning to go back after her again. “We can watch her from here. Come sit down.”
“Yes, ‘we’. Maybe we can watch that documentary you wanted to watch or pick a movie or something,” John said as he ate more of his soup.
“Hm, yes. Your pupils are dilated. Your heart rate is elevated. You're touching your mouth.”
“That’s fantastic,” the doctor exclaimed after another deduction, and Sherlock turned to look at him.
Sherlock would be so disappointed in his complete lack of observation. Who misses a whole tree standing in their living room?
“Course not. I was biding my time. Knew you’d turn up.”
John reached blindly for the lube he had put down earlier and quickly slicked his fingers after finding it. He pulled back just enough to slide a finger in and met no resistance. He worked the finger in and out, mesmerized by the sight of his finger in Sherlock’s body, and carefully worked a second finger inside. Sherlock moaned appreciatively at the addition and John leaned back down to work his tongue around his rim, pressing into him along with his fingers. When he twisted his hand and pushed his fingers into the bundle of nerves inside, Sherlock cried out and John had never heard a more beautiful sound.
“Well, you’d know. Need to get the powder burns out of your fingers. I don’t think you’d serve time for this, but let’s avoid the court case. Are you alright?” he asked and John glanced away before looking at him again.
“Of course.”
“But why do you need parts?” Molly asked as she continued to eye him bemusedly.
“That’s the idea,” he teased before bending again to his task.
“I need you to come with me and you weren't answering my texts. Obviously, I needed to come in here to get you,” he replied, sounding annoyed at having to explain what he seemed to think should have been obvious to John.
It was with all this in mind that he planted the seed of him needing a flatmate in the ear of any who would listen. Earlier that day he had mentioned that he must be a hard man to find a flatmate for to Mike Stamford, and a mere 4 hours later, Mike had hand-delivered a handsome little package right to the lab.
Sherlock turns to his side, his eyes locked on John’s and he smiles. “That was hardly our first date, John,” he says. He leans in and gently presses his lips to John’s, and John smiles into the kiss.
“Where to?” the cabbie asked as he made his way into the traffic of London.
Sherlock leaned further back into the couch and pouted. John laughed at his antics.
“Into battle,” Sherlock threw over his shoulder, and John laughed as he bent to pack away the sandwich wrappers and napkins, the water bottle and the cups they had used, then carefully folded the blanket they had commandeered from Mrs. Hudson after he shook off the bits of flower and grass that stuck to it. He tucked the blanket under his arm and grabbed the basket, also commandeered from Mrs. Hudson, and stood up. He looked over in the direction his friend and daughter had been in and saw them walking back towards him. Sherlock had Rosie propped on his hip and she was giggling excitedly as she stuck dandelions in his hair.
“John, I owe you an apology.”
“Look, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable. Shit,” he hurried to explain, agitation clear in his tense shoulders, the flexing of his fingers. “I know, ok? You’re married to your work. I got that message, loud and clear. I accepted it. I’m not trying to get anything more. I told you then and I still mean it. It’s fine. It’s all fine,” he rushed to assure him. “Your friendship means more to me than anything else, Sherlock. Please tell me I didn’t just fuck this all up,” John finished, quiet and desperate.
John barked out a laugh.
“Of course I did. She needs all these things and you were busy.”
John sighed. “Look, I’m not going to tell you you can’t experiment in there because it’s your flat, but I would appreciate a clean place to cook and eat.”
His gaze finally caught on the man he was looking for in a back corner of the room. He was looking down at something in front of him, his head tilted to the side, and John could easily imagine the look that must have been on his face. The silvery eyes sharp with curiosity, with interest, the soft frown of his mouth as he concentrated on what he was observing. It was somewhat unusual to see him so still as he worked, but whatever it was had his full attention. He hadn’t acknowledged John in any way. Not that that was unusual, but he usually got some kind of greeting. Even if it was just “where’s that thing I asked you for twenty minutes ago when you weren’t even in the room?”.
“Well, half the fun is the fantasy,” John replied.
John arched a brow at him. “Cat got your tongue?” he teased lightly, and Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him.
Sherlock watched him for a moment before he stepped back and allowed John to walk past him into the kitchen.
He was glad for that, though. He wasn’t sure he could give Joy up, even though it had only been a week. She had wormed her way so intrinsically into his heart and life, filling holes he knew was there but didn’t think would ever be filled again, that the thought of not having her there was almost painful.
“John,” he said quietly, stepping up close to the shorter man, eyes locked on his, and John stared at him for a long moment before a look passed through his eyes.
“I was rather hoping you’d like to see the bedroom,” he replied with a quirked brow and a small smirk.
“Sorry,” John replied, forcing a smile onto his face.
“John.”
“Of course there’s more.”
Sherlock went silent as John turned to hand him his prepared tea. They both took a careful sip before Sherlock spoke again.
He was as tall as himself, perhaps a touch shorter, and more muscular. Dark auburn hair was clean and worn short to his scalp, eyes were sharp and a bright blue, and his hands bore the marks of a man familiar with a scalpel. A doctor, then. Surgeon. His clothes were new and clearly tailored to fit him to enhance his features. And he was gay.
“The usual ones.”
“Bed,” John gasped into his skin and Sherlock nodded, pressing into him and pushing him backwards a step before releasing him and pushing his own trousers and pants all the way off.
What had made Alexander Campbell so special? What had he done to have deserved John?
“She helped. With everything. She knew. She knows I’m back, too. I saw her after I visited Lestrade.”
Maybe it wasn’t the same coat. He probably went and bought a new one. The hospital wouldn’t let him have it after. John had asked. So, maybe it was the same coat and he had had it drycleaned wherever the fuck he’d been the last two years.
, he thought. He was so close and there was no way he was going to stop now. He closed his eyes as he thrust harder into his fist.
“The winds are about to change, Dr. Watson. A storm is coming. There have been threats to the Kingdom that can no longer be ignored. A...specialist is being recalled to the country and should be arriving soon.”
Caught in the crossfire. One bullet that was shot without being properly aimed. If it had, it might have hit a better target than his shoulder. Maybe it would have got him in the heart, or a lung, or the head. Sometimes, in the darkest times, he wished that it had. It’s infinitely easier being dead than existing without purpose.
Maybe she was magic. It would actually explain a lot.
“Fine. Blue, I suppose.”
He chuckled at his own thoughts, then shook his head. He should really get back home. It had only been three drinks, but he knew that if he didn’t leave soon, he’d have a fourth and that wouldn’t bode well for his Saturday. While he enjoyed a few drinks on a Friday night, he was really getting too old for the Saturday morning hangover. His body just wasn’t what it once was.
“It’s not poisonous, is it?” John asked as he wrenched the second window open.
John stayed calm in the face of it, for the moment, at least. “That’s because I’m not gay,” he reminded him like he would need a reminder, “but it was also because I didn’t want people thinking the wrong things about you.”
John let his head fall towards his chest. “I did. But it wasn’t because I don’t forgive you, or because I want more apologies. I don’t. I believe that you did what you thought was the only thing you could do. You saved my life, your friends' lives, and I’m not so petty as to hold that against you for the rest of your life. You did what was necessary; you made sacrifices that a civilian should never have to make. You did more than should ever have been asked of you. And you did it willingly.”
Sherlock remained quiet and invited John to continue with whatever he was going to say with a “carry on” gesture with one hand.
“Okay.”
Sherlock pulled away after a minute and John leaned over to open the drawer of the bedside table and pulled out the lube. He quickly opened it, poured some into his palm, and slicked up Sherlock’s cock.
It didn’t matter. He gave himself a shake of his head and told himself to stop being so melodramatic. He was on holiday, a proper holiday, and he was going to enjoy this.
“I need you now,” he pleaded, unashamed of the desperation in his voice. He needed more. He needed all of John, now, before he burned away. He nearly sobbed at the emptiness he felt when John removed his fingers.
“Only twice? I had to read it four times before she went to sleep the first time.”
The silence stretched for several moments before Sherlock grew impatient.
Sherlock ate without argument.
“What made you finally agree?” Sherlock asked, out of a mix of actual curiosity and a need to fill the silence.
“I’ll be back later,” he threw over his shoulder as he yanked on his gloves and practically ran down the stairs, unable to stay in the suffocating feeling that settled over him in the flat.
“A bit light on the gin, don’t you think?”
“Please. What use do I have for pornography, John?” he scoffed as he threw just enough distaste into his tone to hopefully kill this line of questioning. Judging by the way John’s smirk fell and the light that had just been dancing in his eyes faded, Sherlock had definitely killed something.
“I like your dog,” he said, and John blinked.
“Yes,” Sherlock agreed.
“Do what, exactly?”
“Well I could, but where’s the fun in that?” Sherlock asked, and John gave another huff of laughter. Behind him, the kettle clicked itself off as the water boiled within. He turned and set about the task of making tea for them both.
They started with breakfast foods because she insisted that it was the most important meal of the day, and since he could reliably make some breakfast foods already, then it would be a good place to start because he already had some experience.
Mrs. Hudson nodded absently as she fussed with the garland and John let her carry on without further conversation.
“Good shot,” he said quietly as he stepped up to John.
He popped into the loo to relieve himself and brush his teeth, then made his way into the kitchen. The kettle was filled, so he flicked it on to boil the water for tea and tossed a couple slices of bread into the toaster.
Luckily, the conversation drifted away from anything that he needed to reply to and he finished off his pint with the bare minimum of interactions possible.
He tried to convince himself it was because it was a decent day and not at all because he was still trying to figure out how to handle everything between him and Sherlock. He failed miserably, of course, but he hadn’t expected to win. He used to be much better at lying to himself, but age or love or the miracle of a friend returning from the dead changed that a bit.
He had seen and done things that he never wanted to do. John could see it in his face, which was both alarming and somewhat comforting. Sherlock’s mask was still there, but it slipped more than it ever had before as he spoke.
John watches as Sherlock’s eyes track the man carefully until he is out of sight. He tells himself that it’s a good thing Sherlock has decided to sit and join him. It must be good. He could have walked off if he wanted. He picks up the now filled wine glass in front of him and briefly considers offering a toast before deciding against it.
Click.
“Harry’s your sister. Sister! It’s always something,” he bit off, annoyed at getting something wrong.
“I love you.”
“Old habits,” Sherlock’s deep voice spoke softly by his ear and John turned his head for the first time to glance at him.
“Fine. Soup?” He asked, and wasn’t that just another level of ridiculousness. Asking questions he knew the answer to.
“I love the smell of the ocean.”
“How do you think Rosie will take the news?”
“Necessity.”
“You know, this would be a lot easier if you just moved in with me,” Sherlock took the opportunity to say as he and John stumbled into the flat at Baker Street after a rather exciting case, followed by the decidedly unexciting long hours of paperwork that had to be completed at NSY.
Just as he bit down gently on Sherlock’s neck, his door went flying open.
“Oh, John, she’s lovely. You’ll take care of her, dear.”
“John, I think you should know I consider myself married to my work and while I’m flattered by your interest,” Sherlock began.
“Really, I am. It’s...well, it is what it is, isn’t it?”
He sat up, rolling carefully off Sherlock, as Rosie approached the bed with her new stuffed rabbit clutched to her chest.
The dog seemed to find him trustworthy because he stepped closer to him, and John noticed the way he held his paw.
Oh, so that’s how this was going to be played? John felt his shoulders draw down and squared up, his back straightening in an instinct born of years in the military and an unwillingness to back down to bullies
Mrs. Hudson’s eyes swept over the tray and she gushed delightedly over the plates of eggs benedict and the fresh pot of tea as she ushered him inside her flat and to her kitchen table. She pulled out cups for the tea since he hadn’t had room on the tray as he placed the heavy tray down on the table. Then she gathered silverware as John placed the plates in front of the two chairs.
“Lestrade?”
He didn’t often let his mind wander in that direction, but the strong drink in his blood and Sherlock’s closed eyes gave him the confidence to ignore how dangerous those thoughts could be.
John couldn’t remember what those flowers were meant to mean and perhaps they didn’t mean anything. Perhaps the mourner had simply picked flowers they liked and left them behind. Perhaps Molly had finally come to visit.
No, John supposes. That wasn’t their first date. It wouldn’t be their last, either.
“Where’s it from?”
“Hey, now. Are you ok? Why are you crying?” John asked, voice gentle.
Two plates of bucatini in his lemony carbonara with crispy bits of fried bacon and pancetta sprinkled throughout. John let the conversation fade out as Sherlock wasn’t speaking anyway and John had to admit that the food in front of him looked like the most appetizing dish he had seen in years. The first bite, lemon and yolky sauce and salty pancetta with the al dente pasta was perfection, and John hummed in food-inspired bliss.
“Wonderful. I have it all planned out,” Sherlock declared as Rosie ran to the sofa and continued her jumping on the cushions.
“John Watson, I am going downstairs to make a pot of tea, and when I come up here I want to see you making an effort to do something about this tree.”
He shouldn’t say anything. There was no reason to say anything. But her eyes were gentle and friendly, and they could talk now, they were friends. And Sherlock always did work better when he spoke out loud.
He lengthened his strides once again and made his way to the closest exit from the park. A cab pulled to a stop after he lifted his arm and he climbed in, barking out an address, and sat back, closing his eyes as the cabbie pulled out into the traffic. The swaying of the cab was nearly hypnotic, lulling him into that stage between sleep and wakefulness, that knife-edge of conscious thought and dreaming. There he saw John, frowning at him with a mix of concern and anger clear in his features, and Sherlock wanted to apologize for whatever had put that look on his face, but the words stuck in his throat. Choking on his apologies, his excuses, he struggled to breathe. The sudden stop of the cab threw Sherlock back into reality and he shoved the fare through the window to the cabbie and nearly threw himself out of the backseat.
“Dare.”
“Too late for help. You signed your life away in front of an official and a handful of select witnesses. You belong to me now.”
“Oh, I do. And I will. But I need to eat, and so do you. I have plans for you, Sherlock Holmes, and we’re going to need our energy,” John asserted with a gentle tug to his hair and his toes curled in unexpected pleasure at the sensation. Sherlock felt the blood rush to his cheeks in a furious flush at the same time it went rushing downward. Well.
He crouched down, examining the trajectory of blood, the angle of the needle as it pierced her eye, the location of the other needle, the cat fur on her clothes.
Her mouth opened in an excited “o” at the idea of starting a new collection and she nearly vibrated in her skin at the prospect. She turned around in a circle, looking for something. “Where’s my pail?”
John walked up to stand beside Sherlock, his eyes searching for what held all of Sherlock’s attention.
Why were there constantly people inside his flat without his knowing?! He forced himself to take a calming breath before he walked into his kitchen. Mrs, Hudson was putting some kind of dish into his oven and there was a fresh plate of shortbread on the tabletop.
“John.”
They got takeaway and went back to Baker Street to eat. They ate, and talked, and laughed, and Sherlock was sure John would take the upstairs room now. But when dinner was finished and they had packed up the leftovers in the fridge, John had left.
“I don’t know, but that’s the point. I need to know in case the information learned ever becomes valuable.”
“And you belong to me.”
“Why?”
I'm sorry for the late update. My laptop was appropriated for most of the day and I just got time to work on this. I'm not 100% in love with this chapter, but it's the best I've got for now. Thank you so much for reading!
In that moment, he drifted. The pieces of his sanity were still scattered, still not quite in his grasp, but the shadows had receded, their whispering murmurs harder to decipher, thus easier to ignore.
He didn’t see anyone or anything out of place. He frowned down at the stone again, at the flowers left there, and took out his phone to take a photo of the bouquet to try and figure out what they were later.
Mrs. Hudson stood in the doorway with her hands covering her mouth, an array of biscuits spread all over the floor at her feet beside a fallen plate that had managed to land on the rug and not break, while Joy sniffed and tried to get as many as she could. Sherlock sat in his armchair, one long leg crossed over the other, fingers steepled under his chin, in a pose so familiar to John that he could almost believe that it was two years ago and Sherlock had never fallen from a building.
“Oh. Oh, right. Do you have a boyfriend, then? Which is fine, by the way,” he quickly verified when Sherlock actually looked away from the window to John.
Sherlock jumped up, not quite as agile as before, and went to put on socks and shoes. John pulled on his coat and scarf before leashing Joy. Sherlock had pulled on his own coat and scarf by the time John was done and they made their way out of the flat and to the pavement.
“I don’t think he was very serious about any of them,” Molly attempted to placate him.
When he was about five minutes from the clinic, he felt a familiar tingle on the back of his neck. Something he hadn’t felt in a long time. He felt like someone was watching him.
“You must be thinking about something. What is it?”
“He’s interesting.”
“Murder, I would think.”
Rosie pouted at the reminder that Ice Cream would not be coming back to London with them and the look reminded John so strongly of Sherlock that he barely contained the snort of laughter that bubbled up. Sherlock’s eyes shot at him yet again, and at John’s smirk, the taller man rolled his eyes. John did laugh then.
Mrs. Hudson’s head popped out of the kitchen to look at him. “Are you sure, dear? Don’t you have something to be getting on with?”
“No, you need it for tomorrow,” Sherlock explained.
“Don’t answer that,” he instructed as he crossed the room and tossed a pink suitcase on an empty chair.
John carefully took the empty mug from his hand and placed it on the sink. He turned to look back at Sherlock, a question in his eyes, and Sherlock took in a deep breath and let it out slowly before he nodded.
Work had been a constant stream of flu and strep tests, runny noses, and one memorable ingrown toenail that could possibly give him nightmares. And he knew a thing or two about nightmares.
John blinked at her for a moment, but she threw her hands up and walked away before he could think up a reply to that.

He wants Sherlock to know that he sees through the game he has been playing. A part of him wonders if Sherlock even realizes what he has been doing.
“No, no. We have to have sex. It’s tradition,” John argued as he pulled the duvet back and completely off the bed.
John sighed, his throat tight as the words faded into the silence between them once more. He looked up from his feet to look towards Sherlock again. He took in the familiar angles, the subtle changes from a lived apart, and his chest felt constricted with the loss of innocence that clung to Sherlock’s shoulders now. He knew Sherlock was no innocent, of course, but he had had to do things that he never wanted to do, and John had been around enough soldiers in his life to know how killing another person changed you. He wished, wildly, that he could have taken that responsibility for himself, to save Sherlock from that, but he couldn’t, and hadn’t been given the opportunity anyway. It was done. There was nothing to do except move forward.
John groaned and Sherlock reined in his laugh to keep from waking Rosie. John turned his groan into a good-natured chuckle.
Sherlock liked the Detective Inspector as a person, but today was not a day he could deal with idiots who ignored the evidence in front of their eyes. He rose as swiftly as a tidal wave and spun around, glaring at the man in front of him.
“I feel like we’ve moved off-topic.”
John smiled, once again finding himself grateful for his landlady. He had taken her for granted when they had first met, but he knew better now. She was a strong, brave, graceful woman. She didn’t take any shite from anyone. She was caring and loved to dote on Sherlock when he was alive. She had doted on John, too, but he had been too blinded at the time to see it. He saw it now, though, and he was thankful for her steady presence in his life. She got carried away sometimes, sure, but who didn’t? She had stood by him and held his hand, both literally and figuratively, several times since Sherlock fell. He appreciated her and felt guilty for all the times he hadn’t in the past.
“Yes. It was extraordinary. Quite extraordinary.”
“We will. Talk. Later,” Sherlock said, his throat thick with emotion and sentiment, and he was impressed he managed to get that many words out.
“Move, please,” Sherlock urged, and John gave a careful roll of his hips which left them both groaning.
“Something about needing help, he said,” John replied when Sherlock remained quiet.
The light was soft and it was warm and inviting inside. He found himself smiling without meaning to as he made his way down the first tight aisle of books.
“I love you,” Sherlock’s voice was soft, low. Large hands came up to cradle John’s face, thumbs brushing under his jaw as his long fingers slid into the hair at his nape. “I have loved you for years,” he said before closing the distance between them again.
Sherlock looked up at him with an expression that John couldn’t quite make out, but then his brows drew down in curiosity.
“I was looking for a friend for Ice Cream in the garden.”
“Thank you for coming here with me,” Sherlock suddenly said, his voice quiet, and for a moment John wasn’t sure he actually heard anything until he continued. “You and Rosie being here is...good.”
“I believe it’s a ring,” Sherlock replied calmly.
John felt his stomach drop. He hadn’t considered a possible future where Sherlock would ever be further than a cab ride away. He hadn’t considered a future where he was further than a staircase away, either, not in years, and he found the possibility left a horrible taste in his mouth. He took a sip of his tea to try and smother that bitterness, but he wasn’t surprised when it didn’t make any difference.
“Thank you. Was that before or after you stopped by to see Molly?” he asked, eyes on his risotto as he stirred.
“Chasing after criminals, takeaway, crap telly. Those were our dates. You were the relationship I wanted,” the doctor quietly revealed.
Sherlock stepped closer and slipped his hand into John’s front pocket to pull out his mobile. John watched him curiously as Sherlock typed in the passcode and swiped it open. He tapped quickly at the screen and then the speakers started playing out another song.
Sherlock had kissed him. Wanted to kiss him. Initiated the kissing. So why had he suddenly seemed to pull back and away from him?
“What’s got you in a good mood?” Mrs. Hudson asked as she returned, tea tray in hand.
He stood under the spray and let the warm water cover his face and hair and drown out any outside noise. When he reached for the shampoo he glanced through the curtain and saw the shadow of Sherlock as he stood near the sink.
“I just happened to notice that you seem to have moved into the flat at...221B Baker Street,” his brother replied, pausing deliberately over the address as if he didn’t know exactly where Sherlock was at almost any given point in time. He didn’t bother replying and was awarded by an annoyed huff of breath a moment later. “Did you find a flatmate?”
Apparently, he was a man who would look at the devastation of yet another completely ruined attempt at a home-cooked meal, order takeaway on his mobile because he had to eat somehow, and go back to the fridge to see what he had left to cook with the full knowledge that he wouldn’t make anything edible, but was unable to back down.

But Sherlock didn’t want everything that John would undoubtedly end up giving, and John wasn’t ready to follow that path all the way to its undeniable dead end.
“John, you’re thinking so loudly I’m surprised the whole restaurant can't hear you,” he says, and John huffs out a breath of a laugh.
He was getting ahead of himself. He wasn’t sure what he was thinking anymore.
He needed to do something. He needed a plan, and then a backup plan, and then a backup to the backup plan. So, John did what parents all over the world were doing. He went to his laptop, typed into the address bar, and pulled up Pinterest on ideas to keep busy at home.
He used to believe that love was a sickness. A virus. Something that made a person weak and foolish.
He began asking questions and the man seemed to relax a bit as the minutes passed in a series of questions and thoughtful answers. Sherlock was mildly impressed at the information the man had available to give. At least he wasn’t a complete idiot. It seemed more like he had simply relied on the wrong people to surround himself with in his clinic than anything else.
“The one I made.”
“John. I know I’m just an old woman, and I’m not your mother, but I worry about you.”
