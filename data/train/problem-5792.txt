Wanda hesitates, but remembers her promise to behave, and lays out across Tony’s lap, resting her head on one hand and sucking her thumb with the other. She tries not to whimper, but says softly.
“Can we handle them both being upset though? I mean, Pete knows the drill by now, but we might still be unlucky.” Steve points out. Peter has been to see Stephen for follow ups twice already since the doctor wants to keep a close eye on how his arm is healing. So far, there have been no complications.
“We can’t all four fit in the bed, babe!” Tony laughs a little. “Peter will sleep just fine in his own bed.” He assures, picking up the cup to wet Wanda’s hair and upper body. He works carefully, tilting the girl’s head back to avoid any water and shampoo from getting in her hair. After rinsing the shampoo out, he works in a generous amount of conditioner into the girl’s vibrant red hair. She has a terrible tendency to get awful knots in her hair, but she refuses to let her Daddies get it cut to make it all easier.
“Daddy? Papa?” The boy knows they are not there, but that does not stop him from wishing they were. He settles down a little when he sees the cool masks Stephen and Thomas have though. “Oh, pretty.”
“Hmm!” Peter nods with a smile. The promise of a story, and cuddles that naturally follow, sound exciting and he bounces on his feet lightly. But, then he thinks of something. “Story to Wan’a and Da?” He says, pointing to the pair still fast asleep on the sofa. Steve hesitates, then nods.
“The doctor got a quick look at him and upped the pain meds, but then got busy with an emergency. He promised to come back as soon as he could.” Maria says to Steve while Tony comforts Peter.
“Where are you two going?” Steve picks Peter up and kisses his cheek. “I’m sorry baby, but it’s just gonna be you today. You can come back and play with your sister. Wanda, back in bed.”
Wanda is curled up on the floor, clutching her knees to her chest and whimpering. Steve kneels down and touches her shoulder.
“Yeah, we better check Peter’s temp before bedtime tonight.” Tony sighs a little where he is stood back looking at the Littles with his husband. “But, I’m sure it will pass by tomorrow.”
Happy before, Peter suddenly starts to worry. He glances back at his Daddies and reaches up for Tony with his good arm.
“You are so, so brave and good. I love you so much. I want you to know that, honey. You’re the bravest little thing in the world.”
“He’ll be so scared.” Tony turns to glance back at the room where his little boy is lying there all alone. But, he and Steve both know that the sooner they go through with this, the better the outcome for Peter. “Okay. Tomorrow morning. Are you gonna want him to stay an extra few nights after the surgery?”
Steve and Tony wake up in the morning bleary eyed and worried about what the day will bring. Both of the backs hurt from sleeping in the reading chairs in the room, but thankfully Peter is comfy in his bed and fast asleep still. After tidying themselves up a bit, Steve and Tony go to wake up Peter so he can have some time to prepare for the surgery. Steve runs his fingers through the boy’s hair and hums softly to him.
“We’ll cuddle and have a nap once you’ve taken your meds. What do you wanna drink then, kitten?” Tony asks, going to the cupboard and picks out one of Wanda’s Hello Kitty sippys, which she sometimes shares with her brother.
Steve gives Tony a look that clearly says with all the sarcasm in the world, 'this is going to be fun.' Peter turns his head back and forth while his family debates. He can sense that this is serious stuff and sucks his pacifier more vigorously to sooth the anxiety that is building up in his chest.
“Okay, let’s see.” Steve says, looking for a marker that will show on the blue cast. He grabs a dark red marker and draws a little monkey on it which is surrounded by hearts. “There you go, love. It’s looking real pretty already.” He says and Peter grins. He knows that he will have to go back to daycare next week and he really wants to show his friends his cool cast.
“Peter!” Stephen is happy, but surprised to see the little boy opening the door. “What are you doing all by yourself? Where are your Daddies?”
“Come here then, Papa.” Tony says fondly, patting the free space next to Wanda to invite Steve to join them. “We’re reading about princesses and friendly bears.” He informs his partner helpfully.
“Missed you too. What doll you want? I want… Lissa.” She alternates between favourite dolls often, and today it is Lissa. “Princess.”
“Hmm!” Peter nods, pleased that he got his way and gets to watch more TV. He wiggles his toes happily and adjusts his hold on Pooh as he continues to watch. At the kiss on her forehead, Wanda stirs a little and reaches her hands up towards Steve.
“Duckies it is. We’ll take care of your sister later.” Steve says, deciding to take this one argument at a time. He tells Tony to keep an eye on Wanda, then takes Peter into the bathroom so he can start running water. He undresses him slowly, trying to get him to relax a little bit, then helps him in. “Okay baby, I’m gonna wash your hair now. Close your eyes.”
“We have diapers here. I’ll have a nurse bring some.” Stephen says. “There’s a single room available, so he won’t have to be around others. I think you need some quiet time with your Daddies, don’t you?” He pats Peter’s head. “I’ll come check up on you in a little while. His room number is B240. And holler if you need anything. And I do mean anything.”
“Then let’s roll.” Stephen says to Thomas and together they open the locks on the bed and start gently wheeling Peter out of the room and to the elevator at the end of the hall.
“Yeah, yeah, we know.” Thomas chuckles a little. “But, that’s why we put casts on and it will protect his arm while it heals. I think the doctor will want him to use a sling as well, so then he won’t use the arm as much either.” He explains.
The paramedics’ names are Gabby and Stella and Peter shyly introduces himself as well and then points to his arm.
“Wha’?” Peter asks, having walked to the kitchen obediently when his name was called. His arm is not in the sling anymore and Steve frowns at the sight.
“Hmm.” Stephen frowns, placing the stethoscope around his neck. “Can you have her lie down for me? Let’s make sure she’s breathing ok. That cough doesn’t sound like anything to joke about. Has she gone potty recently? Because she might be dehydrated too. It could make the cough worse.”
“We’ve got it under control.” Tony smiles at his husband, placing a hand on Wanda’s shoulder to keep her in place. “Wanda, why don’t you tell your brother about the princess duties?” He asks, picking up the lightly soaped loofah to wash the girl’s body.
While Tony reads the book for a second time, Peter feels himself sink into the mattress and almost falls asleep, but then things start moving again when a new pair of paramedics show up in the ER. Their uniforms look different and they seem more friendly, but Peter is still sceptical and yelps when he is moved from the bed and onto a gurney.
“Steve, uhm- what about Wanda? She’s still in daycare and we are closing in an hour.” Maria points out and Steve groans out, rubbing at his forehead as he thinks of what to do.
“We'll let you know.” Steve says gratefully. “Thank you so much, Thomas. It's really appreciated.” He actually does not know how they would have calmed Peter down without the nurse there.
“I’m all better, Daddy. I go play now. With Peter.” After all, she had promised her little brother that she would show him how to play hopscotch today with more than one rock, and she cannot possibly miss that. It is part of her big sisterly job. Even if she still feels icky all over and really wants to just cry and cuddle with her daddies, playing with Peter sounds objectively way more fun.
“Yeah, yeah. Okay.” Tony says, having a hard time wrapping his head around everything, but he trusts Stephen. He trusts him with his baby boy.
“Hey.” Steve kisses him quickly. “Did you two have a good day? It looks like she tired you out.” Wanda’s usually so dainty and shy, but the whole pneumonia incident has just sent her into a completely different mode that is a mix of hyperactivity and fever induced delirium. “I’ll handle her for the rest of the night if you want a break. She probably needs a bath. Peter does too.”
“Moomin home with Mama. Back home with Mama.” Peter explains. The last part always makes him feel so safe with knowing that Moomin got back to Moominmamma and they are all drinking juice happily.
“I sure can.” Steve always does funny voices when he reads to Peter and Wanda, and he tries to make the bear sound big and growly. However, he tries not to be too loud, and reaches over to take Tony's hand as he reads. Wanda cannot keep her eyes open, but rolls over so she is halfway on top of Tony, her head resting on his shoulder.
“Stay?” He does not want to be without them, even if there is going to be magic involved. Uncertain of they can come with Peter, both of the Daddies turn to the doctor for an answer. Stephen smiles and pats Peter’s shoulder.
The girl nods, still crying, but not as hysterically as before. She thinks of Peter who is hurt and needs her to look after him and how she is such a mess. The worst big sister ever.
“Just can’t be away from you, Daddy. I have to be with you. And Peter. Can he sleep with us too? I want him to. It’s like a sleepover!” She perks up a little bit. “I saw a sleepover on TV once. It looked fun, but I think I’d cry, cause I only wanna be with Daddies.”
“You should brush your teeth too, princess.” He says, knowing that the aftertaste of throwing up is the worst there is. Together all three of them head to the bathroom to run Wanda a bath, completely forgetting about Peter downstairs, who is supposed to have a snack and lay down very soon.
“You’re very welcome. Would you mind getting your boy undressed? We want all the little patients here in gowns. I’ll take care of the t-shirt.” Thomas says, fixing an ID band on Peter’s good hand and then takes out a pair of scissors from his pocket.
“I’m sorry, but I can’t kiss it better with the mask on. But, we’ll get you fixed up very soon.” Stephen comforts and lifts Peter up onto the procedure table carefully. With Thomas’ help, he gets Peter to lie down comfortably. “And Thomas tells me you want a blue cast on your arm, is that right?” Stephen asks, stroking Peter’s cheek while he looks down at the boy.
“Okay, we'll read again. I swear, one of these days you'll find a new story to read.” Tony starts from the beginning. Steve pulls out his phone and texts Stephen, knowing it is a good idea to keep in contact with the doctor themselves even if the nurse let him know that they are coming. At least Stephen is not a stranger to Peter. The little boy does not know any of the doctors and nurses here and that had to have been absolutely terrifying for him.
'We're collecting my friend Bruce and then we're flying home,' Tony tells the boy in his arms as he abandons the rest of his team to do the debriefing thing.
'Tony! Leave those...' Steve stops when he sees the skin where the reactor used to be is already nothing more than an angry looking pink line. 'It's... You perfected the serum?'
After eating Tony does seem a little more human. Steve is now hoping that if Tony notices him staring at his chest he'll assume he's looking at the arc reactor.
'In other news I'm rolling out arc reactor power to all of my facilities, I think Jarvis may have bought every children's film on the planet, including the ones not in English, and I have a new Audi.'
Steve feels there must be alarm bells going off somewhere. Loud ones that have spinning flashing lights and signal some form of apocalypse because Tony Stark
'They'll cope without me,' he hears a clinking sound and then the familiar whirring of one of Tony's expensive coffee machines. 'I've said the opening piece; Pepper will fight my corner until I get back.'
'You have not known each other long enough for me to extrapolate outcomes,' Jarvis informs him regretfully.
He wants something to do. The armour and a toolbox are brought up a mere minute after Steve asks for them and so Tony is pacified in the short term.
Watching Tony work is normally fascinating and strangely relaxing; there's a surety, a happy confidence to him beyond what he shows to the outside world.
A slightly harder bite is all it takes to throw the blonde over the edge with a wail. Tony follows him a moment later and slumps, panting, into Steve's arms.
The next chapter is pretty damn fluffy to apologise for breaking all your hearts/souls/lives etc. It isn't ready yet though, so maybe tomorrow?
Steve is sitting quietly over in the beaten up sofa in the corner; Dummy is hover nearby peeking over his shoulder at whatever he's sketching. You is in his charging station and Butterfingers appears to be reordering his wrench collection.
'Right,' Tony's head jerks up. 'Ok, I have some things I need to take care of. I'll try to meet you back at the helicarrier. Cap, you need to look after him, ok?' he shifts the boy into Steve's arms.
He sighs and moves the muffins to his kitchen island and the painting, very carefully, to his spare room.
'I shall take his food to him then,' the older man replies, 'enjoy your food, gentlemen. Call me if you require anything else.'
'Jarvis is trying him right now,' Tony smiles up at her, 'no answer. Not from the other members of his team either.'
'I'm coming,' Pepper looks a little horrified by the thought of sending Tony off alone to an important meeting. 'They're sending me the reports, same as they are you.'
'Apart from my kid, Pepper is the most important person in my life. I wouldn't get anywhere near as much done without her.'
'I'm on a roll with the escape pod,' Tony nods. 'I have a few things to do this afternoon and that call at eleven. Can you have Pete for me for a few hours? I should really speak to those guys in DC.'
‘Alright, I’m going home then,’ Tony winces as he straightens his right arm against his side. ‘Jarvis, lock off my right arm as much as you can; I’ll adapt to steer without it,’ the faceplate snaps down as the repulsors fire.
‘Speaking to someone about it might help,’ Steve tells him doggedly. 'There are professionals in medical who can...'
He just pulls the other man against him and deepens the kiss. He never really would have expected the rasp of a beard against his skin to be so welcome.
Tony surprises him by loosely wrapping his own arms around Steve’s waist and tucking his head under the super soldier’s jaw.
'Then, Bruce,' he gestures across the lab to the sleeping child, 'meet Peter Jarvis Stark and,' he gestures to the incubator, 'James Steven Stark.'
It's when Rhodey arrives in the tower and drops his kit bag to pull Tony into a hug that the situation finally becomes a little too real for Steve.
‘You must connect the generator to the electromagnet in sir’s chest,’ Jarvis instructs him. ‘Butterfingers is getting a spare reactor but it will need to be activated and we must buy ourselves time.’
'Sir?' Jarvis sounds bemused more than anything. 'You passed out a little over seven hours ago, what is it that, as you say, 'does that'?'
'What did you want to... mmmm,' Steve gets cut off when Tony frames his face with his hands and kisses him.
Tony lays awake on his back with Steve latched to his side. The soldier has fallen into a deep sleep so Tony turns his attention to his latest projects and adjusts some plans in his mind and asks Jarvis to run some simulations.
Steve looks up to see Dummy has apparently snatched the arc reactor from Butterfingers and has moved it to a workbench where he’s now peering down at it.
'He was up late with Jarvis,' Steve manages to slip his arm away from Tony and sit up. 'Come on, we'll get some breakfast and come back for your Dada later, ok?'
Pete heads to his own room to get dressed, dragging his sword and blanket with him, as Tony detours to get coffee before coming back for him. He helps his son pick out clothes that match while gulping down his coffee.
'I will tell him,' Tony wants to make sure Jarvis knows. 'Make a reminder; I have to tell Steve by Jim's sixth birthday or you just send him a message the day after.'
'I don't know how but whatever I've just made must have wiped some memories or given me some false ones or fucking something,' Tony grumbles and gets up. 'Steve, sorry, I need to go and fix this. I'll see you later.'
'Yes,' Steve hooks a finger into one of his belt loops and pulls until his face is pressed beside Tony's groin. 'I want...' he places a gentle kiss to Tony's fly.
'Sir,' Jarvis interrupts, 'I wouldn't normally disturb you at this time, but you have been at the penthouse level for a while now and other people wish to have use of the lift.'
‘I shall paraphrase Mr. Stark’s response,’ the AI announces finally. ‘He requests you leave him alone, as he previously requested. He points out he has food in his workroom and that it is not your responsibility to look after him even if he were to allow it. And he says that apologising to him when you don’t know what it is for nullifies the apology.’
'Do it,' Tony agrees. 'Let's get this ball rolling. Send messages to all our other teams; they need to start planning for the switch over. We'll alternate between east and west and work our way north.'
Clint just grins up at her and then stares as Pete slips down onto the floor and builds himself a small car.
Needless to say he changes his mind three times on what to get Steve before Pete even wakes from his nap.
‘Busy work,’ Tony replies without opening his eyes. ‘Had to get stuff done; I’ve been neglecting my company.’
Steve makes himself as comfortable as he can against the wall and watches Tony work as the night draws in.
'Glad I get a mention...' Clint grumbles under his breath and then immediately throws up his hands and takes a step back as Tony turns to glare at him.
Maybe he should? Tony is rich, powerful, influential, great with Pete... Can Steve offer anything as Jim's father that he can't offer as 'Cap'? Is that what Tony meant?
Steve takes a reluctant step back as Tony crosses his arms and stands, entirely casually, between where Hulk's clenched fists are pressed to the ground.
'Because Stark doesn't know how to be in a relationship that doesn't hurt him,' she tells him shortly.
'Sure, sweet pea,' Tony takes a sip of his drink. 'Now, what did you play with as a kid?' he gestures to the images on the table.
Steve surrenders himself to being kissed by a man who clearly knows what he’s doing and lets his hands rest hesitantly on Tony’s waist. Tony rubs his hands up Steve’s chest and then digs his fingers into his hair. He arches up against the taller man then jolts backwards with a wince.
‘There is that,’ Tony agrees straightening up and looking up to where the fight is finally calming down. Even as they say it Hulk is swinging down from the roof making a beeline for Tony.
Tony arrives freshly showered and shaved as Pete finishes his food. Steve immediately holds up the coffee jug as an offering and Tony makes a happy noise in his throat as his mug is refilled.
He can't promise Pete he'll be around all the time when he doesn't know for sure if he'll be allowed to be.
When he arrives back at the tower JARVIS tells him Tony’s down in the workshop. The sight that greets him when he gets there surely takes several years off his life.
Secondly the little boy, who has been half cringing from Steve this entire time, lights up at the sight of Tony and scrambles out from behind the machinery.
'It's just genetics,' Tony continues weakly, 'you shouldn't have to be involved if you don't want to be.'
'Not complaining though,' he grins. 'You can come round and clean up after us more often if you're single.'
'My friend!' Thor strides over as soon as his feet are on the floor and grasps Tony into a bear hug. 'It is most wondrous to see you well!'
'I already did,' Steve blushes. Tony looks to see that, yes, Steve apparently is the hottest thing in the entire galaxy.
'I don't think they deliver,' Tony sees the exact moment Steve remembers who he's talking to. 'I'll have some more of the same then, please.'
'Jarvis activated the ceiling turrets,' Tony gives in. 'Kept them aimed at Steve until I told him to stand down.'
'I'm not sure I can afford to lose games against you,' Steve tries to get his expression under control before he looks up.
'I'll be thankful for having you as a friend,' he corrects. 'I don't need a new bike for that, or lots of muffins, or an original Da Vinci.'
When Tony wakes up he makes his way automatically to the nearest coffee machine. He doesn't really notice that he's in his workshop until he's most of his way through a third mug of coffee. He looks around blearily.
'I was attempting to hint towards what you have just discovered,' Jarvis agrees. 'Sir had one parent who neglected him, one who actively abused him and a parent-like mentor who tried to kill him; he is unlikely to trust his son with many people.'
'Since as soon as I got back to the workshop after New York,' Tony shrugs and glances to his friend. 'I'm a consultant, but the actual Avengers should be at a high enough level of clearance to know. Coulson thinks you know.'
'This one as a hook on the back,' he shows Thor. 'That means it can fix the other ones if they break.'
'I won't bore you with the details, but they wanted a me loyal to them to make them tech,' Tony rolls his eyes. 'Guess they were playing the long game.'
'Talk, please,' Tony doesn't beg. He sighs and closes his eyes as his head rests against Steve's chest, 'Say something Captain America-y; recite the constitution or something.'
Pete giggles and settles against his chest instead of immediately starting to poke him again. He hugs his son close and presses a kiss to the boy's hair.
'This alright?' Tony pulls back so they can each grab a breath and then presses in for another kiss without waiting for Steve to answer.
'Exposure could be a factor,' Jarvis continues, 'in which case I suggest on your next loop you should stay out of the workshop. Perhaps for several loops if the situation is not corrected immediately.'
'Hey, Pep,' Tony fixes the cuff links on the shirt he threw on after dropping off Pete; it is best to wear a suit to Board Meetings.
'You're here and we're both wet and naked,' he tells Steve. 'There is nothing bad about this situation.'
'You have had a large adjustment to make in these last four days,' Jarvis continues. 'Knowing you will be bound to the Captain through a child for the rest of your lives is not something easy to accept. I was confident, however, that you would always have chosen to tell him well before your deadline.'
'SGR is on his floor,' Jarvis tells him carefully, 'Agent Romanov is out driving your Ferrari, Colonel Rhodes has not yet returned to the tower, Doctor Banner is working in his laboratory and Agent Barton is with Prince Thor on the communal floor.'
'No! I just... Does he even really need me? That's what Tony meant, isn't it? Jim doesn't really need me as a father if he has Tony.'
'Where did they all come from?' Clint complains. 'Between us and you, Cap. Think you can come take them from the rear?'
Tony kissed him. And Tony is selfless in some ways, but he’s not likely to have thought that Steve would have wanted that to be their last interaction. Tony didn’t kiss him because he thought Steve wanted him to. So Tony kissed Steve because Tony wanted to.
Steve stands quietly confused as Tony finishes the conversation with his PA (which doesn’t do justice to what Pepper does but is still the perfect description for what she does) and his best friend (best
'I would...' his mind is still spinning. 'I'd move in with him. We'd raise the boys together...' he falters before finally admitting 'I'd marry him, if he'd have me.'
Pete tries to insist on carrying the bag himself but, as it's larger than he is, Steve manages to convince him to hand it over.
'This must be Peter,' the reporter is gesturing crazily to her photographer, who is ignoring her as he's already snapping away. 'Can I ask him some questions?'
'Sir, do you wish for me to display the project files for Captain...?' Jarvis starts to ask but Tony interrupts.
'There you go, kiddo,' he tucks him into the bed in the master suite. 'We should probably try out your bed sometime, you know?'
'I'm Captain America,' Steve smiles, 'but you can call me Steve, if you'd like. What shall I call you?'
'Take a look,' she gestures to the TV as Pete scrambles out of his arms to go to his toys, 'the press are loving this.'
'Come on, Pete,' his son is lifted onto Steve's hip as he stands. 'Let's get you dressed and leave your Dada to caffeinate.'
'I'm in my suit too,' Tony replies. 'My faceplate is back though so I can kiss you. I make you keep the cowl on.
'Good,' Tony murmurs to him, 'you're brilliant darling. Relax for me pet, you know I won't hurt you. Tell me you want this, Steve. Tell me this is good for you.'
'I... I've seen...' how do you tell your boyfriend that you may have once accidently seen a clip of him with his dick up another guy's arse? 'On the internet. You were...'
'Stay here,' he gets pushed behind a desk and the man makes the other people in the shop go out of the door. 'Kid, I can't get the guards to put your Dad's name over the tannoy; there would be a riot.'
‘I think I probably shouldn’t drink that right now,’ Tony pats the bot and downs some water before step back to Steve’s side. ‘Are we ok?’
So here he is; on a ragged sofa in the corner of Tony’s lab. His sketchbook has a lot more robots in it now.
'A little over four years ago the question of having an heir was raised at an SI Board Meting,' he lies between his teeth. 'One of the people there suggested the idea of surrogacy and it stuck with me. Ten months later I brought Pete home and I've never regretted it for a second.'
'Oh, sure, blame the kid,' Tony sighs dramatically. 'I'm going to start charging rent, Rogers. Don't you think that I won't.'
'Nothing wrong with mixing business and pleasure,' Tony suggests with a smile. 'At least they'd understand what you do.'
'Pep, it's not like we slept together and accidentally produced a baby. This isn't some unfortunate consequence that we both knew might happen; our DNA was stolen. Are you telling me you think it's ok to make a baby from someone and then expect them to deal with it? It isn't fair.'
'What?' ok, the question probably should have been asked before Tony drew all of Steve's blood into his cock.
'It occurs to me that you're strong enough that I could ride you against the shower wall...' Tony says, and then wraps his fist around both their cocks and starts pumping.
'As an icebreaker then,' Tony waves a hand. 'Hey, good morning Cap, there's something I need to tell you. Please eat a muffin.'
Steve obeys without question and is relieved when Tony follows suit, if a little slower, with his dress shirt.
'And you know what? Maybe Steve wouldn't do that. Maybe he'd stick it out for the kids and the team and he'd see I was happy and he'd just be stuck in a relationship he didn't want anymore and that isn't any better than him leaving.'
He lets out a long sigh as Steve pets his hair and slumps against him, knowing his weight is nowhere near enough to knock the soldier from his feet.
‘Jarvis is temperamental with new people,’ Tony smirks and throws his legs up onto Bruce’s lap as he relaxes against the arm of the sofa.
'But he does like art!' Tony points out. He's a little proud of himself. 'And I didn't buy it, Howard did, so it's different.'
'I'm not telling you that you have to trust him,' Pepper tugs his hair and then soothes again, 'I'm telling you that's why he's upset.'
'He could have been killed!' Tony doesn't acknowledge the interruptions. 'He could have ended up with AIM! What is wrong with...?'
Tony waves one of his hands around as he argues his point and Steve catches hold of it to keep it still without thinking. Tony stops talking and stares at him in surprise as Steve rubs a small circle over Tony’s fingers with his thumb.
'I didn't... need to see you for anything, Tony,' Steve shrugs and sighs. 'I just missed you, that's all.'
'Sir is my primary concern,' Jarvis reverts to sounding like a computer when he doesn't want to talk.
'Sure you are,' he opens one eye to see Steve crouching beside the sofa looking at him. 'Except for this little nap you've been awake for around thirty six hours.'
'I have more uses for you than just your money,' Steve tells him and then places a steaming pile of pasta and sauce in front of him.
'You really think you'd be able to cope slumming it in my room? Pete reliably informs me that yours is much bigger.'
The communal floor is abuzz with suppressed curiosity when they arrive. Pete curls close against Tony’s chest as the other Avengers all turn to gaze at them.
'Oh, of course,' Steve collects it from where he'd left it with his bike keys. 'I guess I'll learn how to use that function then.'
Which doesn't stop him from curling up in Tony's bed at night, while the genius is still up and working, and feeling a little sorry for himself.
'Barely cost me anything!' Tony retorts immediately. 'And I would have given you the bike soon anyway. There's a present giving occasion coming up, right? Jarvis?'
'I'm not kidding on the muffins though. Get me muffins. Like a giant basket of muffins. With a bow.'
‘But… I was only surprised! And a bit put out for you that Tony never said anything! I’m sorry, Jarvis, if you thought I was… unhappy about you.’
He nods his head and sits up at the table. The sandwich is two rectangles, not two triangles like Dada does it, but it tastes good. Clint and Thor are talking but he doesn't listen to them because he has to concentrate on his food. He licks his fingers clean of egg before drinking his milk.
'Really, I appreciate the concern, but you can't just push me at SHIELD agents and expect me to sleep with them.'
They come in for a rough landing and Steve rolls away so Tony can use his left arm to stabilise himself.
'If you leave your belongings here they will be taken to your suite,' the man continues. 'This way to Master Stark, please.'
'This is new territory,' Steve understates earnestly, 'but we can do this... I mean, if you want me to help...'
Steve also tidies up after they've eaten and puts the leftovers into a little plastic box in the fridge.
'Intergalactic facebook stalking,' Tony nods and grins at Thor's confused smile. 'It's all good. Thor, this is an old friend of mine, James Rhodes. Rhodey, meet the god of thunder.'
He forces himself to watch the movie but he can’t keep himself from being unnaturally aware of Tony dozing a couple of feet away.
'I flirt a lot,' Tony clarifies, 'but I wouldn't ever cheat. I mean; I assume you want exclusive? I never thought to ask but I wasn't going to be straying and maybe you want to keep your options open and that's fine but just so you know I'll just be...'
'Nice line; they'll know that came from you,' Pepper reads back over what she's written and offers it to Tony who waves her away.
'Come here,' Steve laughs as he sits on the bed by Tony's feet. Pete abandons his father in favour of Captain America.
'For the data from the other arc reactor prototype?' Pepper puts down her tablet. 'The numbers were that good?'
'I got back to the tower, asked who was in and was told you weren't. You don't go running at half four in the morning unless you're upset,' she bumps their shoulders together. 'When you still weren't back by quarter to seven I got Jarvis to track you and got a cab.'
PS not to be smug about my own fic, but isn't it interesting how both parties can think everything is fine when we know it really, really isn't?
Steve is slowly taking more of Tony into his mouth and adjusting the angle as he goes. When his cock nudges the roof of Steve's mouth it's all Tony can do not to start thrusting into him. He does grip his fingers into Steve's hair and, for a split second, behave as if he's going to hold him there.
Tony gives Steve a little push to make him sit back on the sofa and then kicks his pants and boxers off from around his ankles to curl into Steve's arms. He pulls Steve into a filthy kiss and licks the trail of come from the corner of his mouth.
Pete settles himself on the floor a selection of his plastic animals, some cars and lots of paper and pencils. That he's hugging his blanky as he draws and his sword is on the floor beside him rather completes the picture.
Steve swallows heavily and bows his head over Tony. He takes a deep breath and squares his shoulders as he stands,
'Here!' Pete lets go of his hand and runs off down the hall before careening through a door to the left. He jogs after him and catches the door before it swings closed, 'Alfred, this is Cap!'
Once in the bedroom Steve finds himself being pushed backwards towards the bed before falling back to land on it on his elbows. Tony looks down at him assessingly for a moment and then undoes his own trousers.
'Cap, would you put some more coffee on and find some fruit to go with lunch?' Tony starts backing out of the room. 'And milk for Pete. And yourself. Probably.'
He's gotten used to being under constant surveillance, and at least with Jarvis he can be pretty sure the AI doesn't pay active attention when he isn't dressed unlike when he was still living under SHIELD's radar.
'You have magical powers,' he tells the soldier as he abandons his meal and rounds the table to place himself on Steve's lap.
It’s not that he thinks Tony will have a problem with Steve being attracted to him. Or rather he’s sure that having a man be attracted to him won’t faze Tony; he’s accidently seen more than one clip of Tony with a man on the internet.
And the way Tony declared he wanted him as if it was the most obvious thing in the world, even if he didn't mean it like
He swallows down the last of his pancakes and refills his coffee before venturing over to help Steve with the boxes. Dumping them all in the middle of the floor means they can see what's arrived as well as freeing up the lift.
'You told me they'd stopped,' his friend scowls. 'Pepper and I were only ok with you moving back to New York because you said...'
Tony doesn't really let Steve watch the movie, but it's only fair because he's not watching it himself either.
There are two loud clunks behind him as Tony drops his gauntlets and then a third when Tony manages to get a hand to the helmet. Tony wipes his thumbs across Steve's cheeks and pulls him into a life-reaffirming kiss.
Steve curls up towards him as he gasps and then throws himself backwards as he thrusts himself up against Tony. For a moment Tony thinks he's going to come but then Steve's emitting a sob as he falls back from the edge.
'Thank you, Steve,' Pepper smiles as Tony takes two from the top for his son before taking some for himself.
The charging net deploys beautifully, just as he designed it, and glows a soft white colour when it starts to transmit power to the sensors below.
‘I need to speak to Jarvis,’ is the only thing Tony tells him before dashing the phone against the wall and prising it apart. He adjusts some wires and then turns the phone over and dials a long number. ‘This is now contacting one of SI’s data centers directly; Jarvis will know it’s me.’
‘Unless you have the previously undisclosed power of magic healing hugs,’ Tony snarks at him, ‘this isn’t helpful.’
He loves this man. He cannot let Steve have a bad experience with this; Steve deserves everthing he can give and more.
They come to a hovering stop and Tony makes a thoughtful sound. When Steve lifts his head to look around he finds them midair across from StarkTower and level with the penthouse landing platform.
Pete's last mouthful has barely been swallowed when, with his eyelids starting to droop, he gets down from the table,
The solution is so simple that Steve is a little embarrassed. Tony doesn’t seem to mind though and talks him through using the phone again and tells him to always come down if he needs a hand.
'All is well,' Thor just laughs, 'that is merely your arm becoming used to such activity and becoming stronger!'
He is certain that trust is the issue here; it can’t be an OCD germ thing or putting the item down wouldn’t solve anything, so he must be half expecting to be grabbed or something. Steve tries not the dwell on all the possibilities that could make Tony react this way.
‘That is fine, Captain,’ Jarvis does sound… happier now? ‘Would you like me to grant you access to the workshop?’
'Can't exactly tell them the truth; we might all be alright with him being a clone and Jim growing in a machine, but I hardly want everyone to know. Also it amuses me,' Tony admits with a grin. 'I'll probably have Jarvis put together some bland exposé from the surrogate and sell it to some rag; funnel the money into an adoption charity somewhere.'
'There's a next present,' she doesn't even make it a question. 'Yes, Tony; if you aren't going to speak to him, you at least have to write to the man.'
Clint huffs and starts building something that looks like it's probably a plane. This offering does at least entertain Pete when Clint starts waving it around and making engine noises.
'I expect so, Captain,' Jarvis agrees. 'He knew you were the child's father when he chose the name.'
‘It’s my brain,’ Tony actually leans his head against Butterfingers. ‘There’s nothing I’m willing to try.’
‘Jarvis,’ Steve makes his mind first thing the next morning, ‘as soon as Tony wakes up can you let me know?’
Steve laughs; a marked improvement over a few weeks ago when he would have flinched and glared angrily.
'So what's the real problem, Tony? You know he's too good to ever reject the kid and he's too stubborn to get himself trapped doing something he doesn't want to do. And, bluntly, if you thought he was doing either you could just up and move across the country. Again. Or out of the country altogether.'
The other members of the night team have joined the meeting and are discussing the output values with their counterparts but Tony tunes them out.
‘We cannot wait but I believe we will not be able to complete the task without him. Butterfingers and You can replace the reactor casing. Dummy will assist you.’
'I'm borrowing your bathroom,' Tony doesn't wait for a response before leaving the room and tugging off his t-shirt as he goes.
He's panting against Steve's hair when his position is recalled to him as he suddenly slides down the wall as Steve's legs apparently give out.
appreciate him,’ Tony huffs and sips at his drink. ‘And Capsicle! I honestly didn’t expect you to turn up,’ he tips his head back against the armrest to look up at Steve on the next sofa over.
He opens his mouth and tries to think of something, anything, that will stop Tony looking at him as if he's insane.
‘I would assume so,’ the face plate flicks up and Tony looks up at him; his pupils are dilated to different extents making him look stoned. ‘Hey, Cap.’
“I’ll get you some water, honey bee, and then I’ll come right back. I want some good cuddles from my best princess.” Tony says with a wink to Wanda before turning to Stephen. “Can you stay with her for a moment and I’ll get her meds too?” Tony asks Stephen. The doctor nods in response before turning to the little girl.
“I want... Elsa!” Peter says, which is the princess he always chooses. The two Littles head upstairs to play, leaving behind the mess of crayons and markers on the dinner table for Tony to clean up.
“All clean.” Wanda yawns. She leans against Tony and puts her thumb in her mouth, sucking contentedly. “Sleep in Daddy’s bed now?”
“Oh, baby, I know. I know it hurts.” Tony feels his heart break and he just wants to reach out and hold Peter and never let go. “It’s okay, we’re here now. I’ve got you. You’re okay, love. The doctor is gonna make sure you feel all better.” He kisses his forehead. “Show Daddy where it hurts.” The fact that Peter lost consciousness freaks Tony out even more, but he is not going to let on, especially since his baby boy is already so distressed.
“Papa where? Papa colour too.” Peter looks at Tony demandingly, wanting an answer and for Steve to show up very soon.
'You tired?' Tony holds his scotch out to Steve so it doesn't get spilt. After the boy his settled against his chest he reclaims his glass.
'I have to mention one of the cars I recognised outside,' she acts like she's asking him to reveal a secret, 'is Bruce Wayne here?!'
He keeps quiet under Tony's renewed glare but Pete squirms enough in his father's lap to turn red rimmed eyes to him,
‘Ah, good boy,’ Tony runs a hand over Dummy as he rolls over. He pulls out the temporary electromagnet by the trailing cables and presses the arc reactor home
'I do,' Tony gets a knot in his stomach as he realises that costume was his. 'So you're Captain America now?'
'What were the choices?' Tony picks up his tablet with a sudden urgency. 'Jarvis, put me down for the terrine, the salmon and the tart.'
'Sorry, Steve,' Bruce tells him, 'but we do worry that you... well... don't have that many friends.'
'Very,' Pepper sounds relieved. 'We have a new contract signed and new people on board for forwarding the Intellicrops programme.'
'I don't necessarily mean permanently,' Tony dismisses. 'I mean to do those father son bonding things that real people do.'
'He hates it here,' he sighs and retrieves his sketch pad from the coffee table and settles himself in the window seat, 'I'm beginning to think Tony does a lot of things that he doesn't like.'
'If it turns out like Dummy that's not much of an improvement, but it wouldn't shed on everything, I suppose.'
Steve doesn’t avoid Tony after that, but they don’t speak often. He spends time in the workshop, like he used to, and he’s certain Tony’s more aware of his presence than he used to be, but Tony doesn’t acknowledge him.
It’s daunting because all the communal areas that Steve has taken to spending time in are no longer deserted and he feels awkward inserting himself into what is clearly a comfortable friendship.
'Here,' Tony reappears, brandishing an elephant, and immediately has a three and a half year old attached to his legs. 'Pete?'
He’s half dozing himself with his left hand having migrated to resting on Tony’s ankle when Tony wakes up.
‘You’ve done a number on this, Big Guy. I’ll salvage the metals from it though,’ he puts it down on the side and returns his attention to the coffee machine.
'This just in!' the reporter announces from the television. 'We have new images of Tony Stark visiting a hospital over the last couple of months! This added to reports that he has been sighted with an unknown, but heavily pregnant, blonde woman leads us to wonder if...'
He gets a better grip on Steve, who's still riding out his own release, and boosts himself to get his legs around the soldier's waist. He hears himself, as if from a distance, making a desperate whining sound. Steve has him presses against the wall now lets out a groan and bites against Tony's shoulder.
'Sure you are,' Steve shakes his head and dishes up the first batch of pancakes. 'Just eat your food.'
I'm not loving this chapter, which is probably why it took me so long to past it... Hopefully the next will be better, and come quicker!
Steve keeps his gaze and tries to puzzle out what Tony's actually asking. A remote control car humps his leg before flipping over and moving back across the floor. Tony's biting his lip against laughing at him.
Steve plays with Pete as Tony keeps working above them. Pete insists on swapping rooms each time Tony does but Tony barely seems to notice.
Steve seems to be only capable of squirming right now. Luckily Tony's an expert on recognising happy squirming from uncomfortable squirming.
'Sure...' Steve shakes his head and refocuses on Pete. 'Hey, buddy, would you like to do some painting?'
‘There have been more important things happen to you since you became CEO again that just what you’ve made!’ Steve objects. ‘That can’t be all you think your life is.’
'So don't,' Bruce agrees. 'He's hurt you. Get some amusement out of whatever bizarre presents he sends to you to apologise.'
'The kitchen doesn't make me..' Steve looks like he's trying to fight his blush. 'I meant this isn't an appropriate place to.. do this.'
'That's great, darling,' Tony finds his voice. 'Anything you're comfortable with. Just careful with your teeth.'
He sees Natasha smirk, hears Clint huff a laugh but it takes Tony's bemused stare for him to realise what he's just said,
‘Shit,’ Tony topples out of the air and his repulsors only just splutter back to life before he crashes to the ground.
‘I have to get to the lab. I have minutes before this reactor is useless and I need to be there when I overload the other one.’
The HUD lights up with messages as he takes in the shelves of his tech. He ignores it as he continues to the front part of the store and to something infinitely more valuable.
This, honestly, doesn’t surprise Steve. They’ve broken up but they still love each other and he’s not sure Tony could ever bring himself to love someone he didn’t trust.
'Tony,' Pepper sighs, 'Steve isn't some perfect god of a man that's judging you at every turn; he's upset that you don't trust him but he's capable of understanding why you don't.'
Half an hour later Tony extracts himself from Steve's grip and throws on some clothes. Downstairs he devours his food as he browses the news channels and then logs himself back into his network.
He stands off to the side, cradling his coffee, as Pete chatters at Steve. Steve has pulled a chair over into the kitchen so Pete can watch him mixing.
Bruce is pleasant company when Steve sees him, but he’s holed up in one of the labs and Steve gets the impression he isn’t really welcome there. So Steve spends his time elsewhere half worrying that Tony is going to turn up and demand he pays his rent and then reminding himself that Tony is a billionaire and probably isn’t sure what rent is.
Steve's mouth fills with saliva and he swallows heavily before following suit leaving himself sprawled on the bed in just his briefs. Tony crawls onto the bed so he's hovering over Steve and gives him a nudge to move up towards the headboard.
'Be patient with him,' Jarvis pauses. 'Sir simultaneously knows how important family is and doubts its necessity.'
'That's good to know,' Steve sounds a little strange but Tony's too busy right now to wonder about it.
It's around six hours later when Tony's research is interrupted by Dummy calling to him over the network.
'Sure,' he tells her as he makes a swiping negative motion with his hand for Jarvis. 'But I have final say on what you print if he tells you any business secrets.'
'You want me to pretend I'm not one of your favourite people?' the PR smile is back. 'I'm Tony Fucking Stark; I'm everyone's favourite.'
He doesn’t allow any of the doctors to touch him or to replace any of their monitoring equipment. The argument would probably have lasted longer but Tony is wearing one of his gauntlets when the doctor comes in, which is a little intimidating as it seems to respond to Tony’s mood and powers up. Steve isn’t sure how far Tony would have gone to stand his ground on this issue, but it’s ok because Steve uses his ‘patriotic powers of persuasion’ (TM Stark Ind.) to send the doctor on his way.
'Tony,' Pepper steps closer as he takes a large swallow of his scotch. 'Tony, you have to tell him.'
'Chips,' Tony lands to accept the mug of coffee Steve's holding for him. 'They're chips, Pete; let's not let Jarvis and Alfred turn you English.'
'Yes,' Bruce sighs. 'It seems that due to the serum they were able to manipulate some cells of Steve's into behaving as eggs so then they just injected them with your DNA.'
Steve hears her first open his bedroom door and then the door to the bathroom. He can hear cascading water and muffled voices and then the door closes and Pepper reappears,
'Is Pepper joining us?' Natasha asks as Tony puts Pete onto the chair that someone, probably Steve, has put a booster seat on.
‘Alright,’ Steve agrees nervously. They’ve never planned their flying together; normally Steve is busy falling or needing a lift somewhere in battle. This seems more intimate.
‘No, thank you,’ Steve takes a tentative sip and reminds himself never to ask how much this stuff cost that Tony drinks like water.
The genius sways in place for a moment and almost looks like he'll manage to focus on Steve but then he shifts the covers just enough before collapsing face first onto the bed to Steve's left.
'This was maybe one of your better weeks?' she smiles. 'Your announcement earlier this week has gone across very well. The Arc Reactor rollout has a lot of people very excited, what can you tell us?'
The penthouse is still quiet when he arrives; Pepper must be elsewhere again. He starts the coffee machine and leans against the kitchen units as it brews.
Tony presses another kiss to his stomach as he rubs gently around Steve's opening. He's about to make Steve tell him if this is ok or not, as the soldier has become a little tense, but then Steve is spreading his legs wider and bending his knees up to plant his feet.
Tony takes his time in the shower, rather hoping Reed will answer the phone and fix this without him having to become a true expert in yet another branch of science.
'Of course, sweetheart,' Tony makes sure to keep physical contact with Steve as he guides him up from the chair and into the lift. 'Penthouse, Jay,' he starts undoing the fastenings on Steve's pants.
‘What did you do?’ she turns a baffled look to Steve, his face crumples. ‘No, sweetie, I believe you, I do, but Tony’s clearly upset about something. It’s certainly a misunderstanding.’
Steve likes to think he's managing this situation quite well, all things considered; he hasn't yelled at Tony, he hasn't run away screaming, he hasn't fainted or started stuttering.
'Ok,' Pete launches himself at his sword and blanket before allowing himself to be lifted up from the bed.
Short silences from his AI either mean he's checking a fact somewhere across the world or he's laughing.
'Fuck,' Tony drops his hand and leans forwards against his knees. 'Fuck, I thought this had stopped... Fuck.'
Tony’s fingers just brush the glass before he jerks them back to his side with a choked gasp before grinning wildly,
‘What for?’ Tony stares at him then retrieves the ratty blanket Butterfingers has brought to him. He shakes the blanket out then just holds it out to Steve to take.
There's a small pause before Steve gets into the lift with them and then Jarvis sends them down to the garage.
'We talked about this,' he checks his hair in the mirror. 'I'll go in first and call you if it's safe, ok?'
'Clone?' Tony tips his head in the identical way to Peter earlier. 'No. I don't know who the other parent is.'
'Columbus Circle, right?' Clint glances over. 'I don't think any of Stark's cars have ever been to a mall before.'
'I didn't think you'd want this,' Tony is suddenly looking him in the eye. 'Come on, Cap, none of this is fair on you.'
He needs to have Jarvis at hand. This is satisfied on two fronts now; Jarvis is still responding over the phone, which seems to surprise everyone who comes into the room (Steve wonders if being from the past and finding everything a little unbelievable is actually a benefit when living with Tony as he takes things in stride by accident) and now he has the suit Tony has a more active interface with his friend.
‘I didn’t argue with him, like I do with you,’ Steve decides this is as good a time as any to clear this all from his conscience, ‘but he always saw me as something to be outfitted… Something to be sent on a job and you’ve always treated me as… as a man. We, Howard and I, weren’t close and I… You’re amazing, Tony, I know people tell you that all the time but I don’t mean for the… genius thing, though that really is something… You’re doing all this because… because you should. Because it’s right, but it’s not something that really affects you. If you wanted you could stay right at the top of society and just run your company and no one would think anything of it but you…’
'Is this as far as you've got?' Tony strides into the room. He's now dressed in jeans and a SI t-shirt and still manages to look like he should be on the front of a magazine. 'Cap?'
'So I've heard,' Pepper beams at him when he finally picks up a tablet from beside the bed so they can see each other. 'Congratulations, Tony.'
The roar is unmistakably Bruce's alter-ego and Steve takes an automatic step forwards to get between him and Tony. He hears Tony huff an amused breath.
'Yes,' Steve gasps suddenly. 'Yes, Tony, that was... That was...' he swallows and pulls back to gaze into Tony's eyes, 'I love you.'
'I came as soon as I heard your most joyous of news!' the clap to his shoulder is only enough to rock him rather than push him off the tower so Thor is trying. 'Truly! The arrival of a healthy heir must always be celebrated!'
It hurts somewhere in his chest to think that he couldn't be a good father. He thinks he's done ok with Pete. And surely that's not the point anyway? He still has the right to know even if he is a terrible father...
'Hah, don't answer that, Jay,' Tony swallows the last of his scotch. 'I'm going to put squirt to bed and see Pepper. I'll see you freeloaders around.'
'Stark Industries, the Avengers, your Arc Reactor rollout, the Charity Gala and your son,' she lists, 'how do you keep it all straight?'
'Maybe she can have that one,' he agrees as he gathers his three favourites onto his lap. 'You can play with the one with the engine that sticks out.'
'I'm trying to understand this from his point of view... It's just hard to realise that the guy I was thinking of as my best friend apparently doesn't trust me.'
Firstly the armour retracts, which doesn't normally happen unless they have confirmed a location safe, and Tony moves to stand behind Steve.
Tony is suddenly between him and Pete, and two gun turrets have descended from the ceiling to aim at him.
It's five to seven in the morning when Steve arrives in the communal kitchen freshly showered after his run.
'I suspect there is very little you might wish to do that Colonel Rhodes would not forgive you for,' Jarvis replies without answering the question.
'Yeah, well, I am awesome,' he smiles back. 'It'll be good to be back. I'll tell the brass that I have a Stark situation to deal with; they'll give me three weeks, no questions asked.'
Whenever he needs to give something to Tony he does exactly as Steve had to with his phone. That he doesn’t need prompting, like Steve did, just means that he’s adapted to this quirk of Tony’s. They do spend a lot of time together.
The little boy finally lifts his head away from Tony's neck and stares at Steve, apparently looking at his suit.
Pete lifts his head from Tony's chest to look out across the room, Tony smirks and throws up a peace sign as the room explodes with noise and camera flashes.
'No,' he blurts, 'wait. It wasn't you. I don't think you'd... I just... You sounded just like Maria. I mean my mother. Her tone whenever she... When she was about to... I'm sorry. It wasn't you. Please don't go.'
'What the hell took them so long?' Tony grins and grabs his tablet back up. 'Get them in on this call.'
Tony lays himself back onto Steve's chest and kisses the blonde as he uncaps the lube one-handed. He rocks down against Steve who's only too happy to spread his legs to make space for him. He licks his way into Steve's mouth as he presses his finger back to Steve's opening.
'I'll make you breakfast,' Steve offers before his brain catches up with his mouth, 'I'm not a sore loser even if I didn't know we were competing.'
'No, no, it's fine. I've just... Err... gained a little something extra. Jarvis is looking into it.'
His son finds himself a seat at the table; he's clearly been domesticated. Steve puts plates on the table for himself and Pete before returning to usher him over too,
'Mine and Tony's,' he clarifies. 'He explained it... they manipulated my cells and added Tony's DNA, or something, it probably wasn't as simple as that sounds.'
It isn’t strictly their area, but Steve takes the decision to go anyway; he needs something to prove to himself that he and Tony can still work together.
Tony pulls himself away gently and pants as he takes himself in hand and quickly jerks off before crawling further up the bed and curling against Steve's side.
They meet Tony’s jet while still over the ocean. Tony uses up most of the remains of the arc reactor’s power by going across to the jet to collect the new reactor while they’re still in mid-air.
Tony is wearing the boots from one of his suits and is hovering up by the ceiling. He watches as Tony adjusts his position, clearly checking something in his eyepiece, and then drills a hole into the ceiling and a cascade of plaster falls down to the floor.
'I hadn't admittedly thought of that,' Tony looks over at his glass wall. 'But Jarvis would never let him outside on his own and even if he did get out Jay can catch him with a suit.'
'Sir will be longer than he thought,' the AI declares. 'He wanted me to check that one of you would be able to make sure Pete has dinner; he is caught in a conference call with his R&D department in Florida.'
'I'm sorry?' he starts to pull away only for the blue eyes to widen and to suddenly have a super soldier latched around his chest.
Steve tries to ask what would count as too hard and suggest maybe he just shouldn't move at all but then Tony's swallowed him all the way down and he can't think anymore.
'The initial pictures are circulating like crazy,' Pepper moves to stand beside him. 'You broke tumblr and twitter...'
‘Stark!’ Natasha snaps then actually recoils a little when Hulk’s head swings towards her and his nostrils flare.
Tony is rigid in his arms but just as he's about to let go he feels arms slip around his waist and Tony melts against him.
‘What are you watching?’ Tony glances back to his tablet and starts flicking things around on the screen.
‘Tony, if you rejected him he probably doesn't want anything to do with you right now,' he can see his friend is leaving his room.
'Is that alright, Pete?' Steve smiles. 'You can come and play with me when your Dada has his meeting?'
Steve seems to have been reduced to vague nodding as Tony presses a hand to his groin and rubs him through the cloth there.
‘I need to get back to my tower,’ Tony pulls himself to his feet and Steve stands to steady him. ‘Jarvis, start fabrication of a new reactor casing.’
Steve isn’t really sure what to say to that but luckily Tony has already turned away and settled his feet back into Bruce’s lap,
'Very romantic,' Tony catches hold of Steve's hand as they walk and if the other Avengers didn't know before they surely know now.
Tony scowls at one of his messages from R&D. Didn't he respond to this a few days ago? Maybe it's from someone else in the same department and somehow the message hasn't reached them?
'I'm sure I speak for many single ladies when I say we'll keep our fingers crossed that you'll change your mind!'
'Steve,' Tony runs his fingers through his hair soothingly. 'Sweetheart, it's going to be fine. I've got the best doctors money can buy and I've been over the procedure dozens of times with Jarvis. I had this thing put in in a cave; they're going to be able to take it out in the best hospital in the world.'
Tony freezes for a split second and then he’s all motion as he moves across the room fiddling with things,
'Ms Potts did inform you of her intention to select items to be donated if you did not make the decision yourself,' Jarvis tells them.
'Stop teasing him, Tony,' Bruce just smiles. 'Jarvis can't get a 3D image from anywhere at anytime.'
Steve settles himself to lean against a workbench as he looks over at his partner. Tony keeps his gaze for a few moments then glances away as he keeps adjusting something in the car.
'Hey, Thor,' Tony can hardly not hug him back. 'Good to see you too. What brings you to our corner of the cosmos?'
Tony Stark is standing in front of them, flicking at a tablet that he has magicked from somewhere, with a small boy perched on his hip and cuddled against his side.
'Sir, Peter is calling from an unknown number,' Jarvis interrupts him from finalising the locations for the sensors in the hallways.
'No,' Tony shakes his head and looks down at his son with a smile. 'Have you scouted the perimeter? All secure?'
Steve bites his lip; there are so many things Tony could be deciding right now that would need him to talk to the three of them. He could be resigning from SI, or from the Avengers, he could be restarting weapons manufacturing, or moving to one of his other many houses. He could be about to tell everyone that actually he is still dying.
‘I’ve made a decision,’ Tony moves to the coffee machine and selects one of his presets. He leans against the counter as the beans are ground, ‘I’ll tell you when Pep and Rhodey are on.’
‘Calm down,’ Tony finally looks up. ‘Cap, it’s ok. I just don’t leave the arc reactors ready to go in case any ever go walk about. I’m plugged in, the electromagnet’s working; I’m not in danger, it’s just not very comfortable.’
Tony's wearing his normal work clothes with the Iron Man boots. He's standing with a box of what Steve assumes must be the grain-of-rice sized sensors for Jarvis in one hand and the drill he had been using hanging from a wrist strap.
'You nearly shot... Hey there!' he cuts himself off as he greets Pete. 'It's great to finally meet you, kiddo.'
‘Fuck that’s tragic,’ Tony twists in his seat to look at Steve up the right way. ‘I mean, seriously tragic. Do they not pay you? Do you need an allowance? Like, pocket money or something?’
'Alright!' Tony gives in and throws up his arms before letting them drop to the bed above his head, 'I promise to take a day off and spend it licking Captain America.'
'Get that for me?' Tony asks, waving vaguely at the lift doors as they open. 'It's all stuff for Pete.'
'I'm not so interested in California's numbers as Florida's,' Tony replies. 'I want to know why they're behind.'
'Alright,' Steve smiles, 'I'll make pancakes in the morning then; I'm sure little boys like pancakes.'
His grip on Steve's shoulder would probably be bothering anyone else; he can see his knuckles are white where his fingers are pressing hard into flesh.
'The north east corner of this room will be the correct location for deployment,' Jarvis adds images to his display.
‘Yeah, like I’m going to let anyone else mess with this,’ Rhodey scoffs and the two of the fall into banter surrounding the uselessness of army tech experts.
Tony has finished announcing the roll out of the arc reactors and is taking questions from the press when it happens.
He jogs up to the front doors of the tower and rolls his shoulders as he crosses the foyer to the lift.
‘Yes, ma’am,’ he agrees promptly and wonders why the only women he’s even know personally are scary.
'I do what?' Tony's fixing one of the cuffs on his shirt, which isn't buttoned all the way, with a tie hanging loosely around his neck.
'Indeed,' Jarvis agrees. 'But I am not one of the first people they would think to call if they had been injured.'
'Sir is a large presence,' Jarvis suggests. 'I cannot fault you for missing him as much of my existence focuses on his desires.'
When Dada first left he nearly asked Jarvis to make him come back, but then Clint had mentioned throwing knives and he asked about them instead,
'Of course he'll know you're his father. You can...' Tony just seems bewildered. 'As much as you want, Cap; Jarvis will always let you up.'
And finally Tony drops to one knee, opens his arms and the little boy, with only a moment’s hesitation, runs straight to him and flings his arms around his neck.
‘God, Tony, I’m sorry,’ Steve tries not to stare at Tony’s right shoulder which even with the armour on is clearly several inches lower than it shoulder be.
'Pepper and I are a great team. I handle the tech side and she wrangles the business side,' he grins, 'and me.'
One hand grips at the sheets below him while the other flies to Tony's head and tangles in his hair. He tries very hard not to thrust upwards dispite the incredible things Tony seems to be able to do with his tongue and manages to keep himself to a gentle rocking. At one point he forces himself to let go of Tony's head as it must be poor etiquette but Tony catches his wrist and moves him back.
Tony picks at his lunch but he can't really delay putting Pete down for a nap after the boy practically falls asleep in his plate.
'You want to calibrate the room using me?' he puts the floorboard back and goes back the way he came.
‘Jarvis is the best at telling stories,’ Pete tells him as he sits under the table with a tablet of his own. ‘He does all the voices and makes the sounds!’
'Hmm? I'm going to Singapore for a conference on Intellicrops. And, because she is an evil woman, Pepper has scheduled a conference call with the Board while we're on the jet.'
'It's not like we have time for anyone else either,' he shrugs. 'And Pep was the one who pointed it out; I was happy.'
'Sir is aware of the situation, Captain,' Jarvis replies tersely. 'We shall update you when we can,' the line cuts off.
'Of course he likes you,' he voice comes out a little broken, he clears his throat. 'Pete, your Dada adores you, ok?'
No, he tells himself firmly, if he gives up on this now all he'll have done is prove Tony right to not have believed in this. It must count for something that he, at least, trusts Tony?
'And Howard?' Steve can feel his distress turning to anger. 'What possible excuse could he have for ignoring the abuse of his only son?'
He does manage to wake Tony up without the other man having a panic attack, though all the computer systems on the Quinjet go haywire for a few seconds.
He's trying to see this from Tony's point of view, he really is, but all he can think is that the other man wants to keep their son to himself.
Steve's fingers are fumbling for his zipper before he knows it. He braces himself with a hand on Steve's shoulder and runs the other gently through his hair,
'Господи, дай мне сил совладать с идиотами,' that didn't sound complimentary. 'Try not to do anything stupid until I get back.'
‘The poison wasn’t a poison. Well, it was. Definitely a poison. But also, it had something in it that’s attacking the reactor casing.’
It was pure survival instinct that had Steve grasp tightly onto Tony’s wrist before he’s out of reach and pure bad luck that the suit was been damaged earlier so that while that arm is working, it’s not strictly attached to the rest of the suit. Steve’s weight, as Tony adjusts to catch himself after the blast, is enough to pull Tony’s shoulder right out of its socket.
‘That’s not the reason,’ Steve disagrees and Tony flinches. Steve hesitates and then steps close enough to press a kiss to Tony’s cheek, ‘why, Tony?’
'I'd like to point out,' Tony starts talking as soon as the doors open to reveal Pepper, 'that this was not my fault and, all things considered, I think I did ok.'
'Barton's an overgrown kid who eats peanut butter with a spoon,' he grins. 'Romanoff thinks we're all idiots but I'm pretty sure Pepper has made her promise not to kill me.'
'I couldn't let myself be out of commission for as long as the recovery from this would need,' Tony pushes himself up before Steve thinks to stop him.
“I’ll get it.” Steve says, standing up. “What do you want, baby? Water or juice? And I guess we’d better figure out what to do with Wanda if we’re going to be gone for the night.”
“Yeah?” Tony calls out and goes to join the family in the living room. Peter’s hair is still damp, so he has had his bath and looks content in front of the TV, while Wanda does not look so pleased.
“Hold on.” Steve chuckles. “I think our little guy here is gonna need a bath after dinner. What do you think, Peter? That sound good?” He runs a hand through his hair. “You guys can have playtime before bed.”
“I absolutely promise, sweetheart. And you know Daddies can't break promises. You're going to have a lot of fun at daycare today.” Steve thinks that if he at least hypes it up to be a positive experience, Peter might go in with a better attitude. Tony, however, might be stuck with a very fussy little girl today. To try and relieve that, he says in a slightly sterner voice. “Wanda, I want you to be good for your Daddy. Do you understand? He'll take good care of you.”
“Love you, Dada. Love Papa.” He cannot help but start crying a little bit as the medicine really starts to kick in and he is rolled through the large double doors. He cries out for them, but he suddenly feels so sleepy and heavy that it comes out as just a whisper.
“Yeah.” The girl says and nods. “I don’t like it, but I’m gonna be really brave and not kick. So when Peter has to get it done he doesn’t feel as scared and I can be brave for him. And when I have to get a shot I don’t cry too. Promise. I’m a really big girl.” She feels a little better now. “Let’s play, Daddy.”
“M’scared.” Wanda whispers. “Cus if I have accidents maybe a prince won't marry me. Can I still have a prince, Papa? Can I?”
“Moomin and My!” Peter slurs with the carrot, kicking his legs again. Tony laughs at the little groan that Steve lets out at having to read the same book twice in one day. After getting Wanda dressed in some fresh pyjamas, Tony brings the girl to the dining table where Steve and Peter have already started on dinner. The little boy has already got food all over his face.
“Petey? You with me?” Stephen asks after a moment and runs a finger around Peter’s eyes. When he gets no twitching in response, Stephen addresses the rest of the surgical team. “He’s under, so we can begin now.”
Wanda considers for a few seconds and coughs again. With a slightly hoarse voice, she finally replies.
It is fun to watch the Care Bears, but after a while, Wanda finds herself becoming sleepy again. She wraps herself around Tony, her legs on either side of his torso and her head resting on his shoulder as she closes her eyes. She shivers a little bit, but mostly feels safe and warm.
“Didn’t play cause Da up.” Peter explains, kicking his feet in anticipation when he feels the doctor’s fingers part his cheeks. Stephen frowns and considers chastising Steve, but figures it better not to do so in front of Peter.
“Peter, Papa says that I’m not cursed but I’m icky and we can watch movies today. Wanna watch Frozen?” Wanda ignores Steve groaning. He has seen Frozen so many times because of the littles that he practically has it memorised. “And we can play princesses. I can be Elsa and you can be…” She thinks it over. “Belle. Or another one. Who do you wanna be?”
Peter frowns even harder. He is not buying anything his Papa is saying and turns around with his giraffe still in his little hand. He needs to investigate this on his own and goes to climb up the stairs, using his hands too as he makes his way up.
“Hi, princess! I’ve missed you too!” Tony laughs and wraps his arms around his little girl and then hauls her up and onto his hip. “Did you have a good time with Uncle Vis?” He asks, rubbing her back before extending his hand in a greeting to the other man.
Peter huffs a little and fiddles with Pooh while he tries to process everything. Even after many moments of thinking, he still cannot make sense of it. Either way, his head is working slower than normal and he can hardly have one thought before it vanishes and another pops up. Peter is about to whine for his Daddies, even though they are right next to him and stroking his hair, but then there is a knock at the door and Thomas enters with a tray in hand.
“Okay.” Steve takes a deep breath. “Should we tell him he’s going to have to have surgery? We should. It wouldn’t be fair to leave him in the dark. I just don’t want him to be afraid. Christ, he’s gonna… He’s gonna freak, isn’t he?”
“Steve, keep your head, will ya?” Tony calls after his husband before turning his attention back to Peter. “Oh baby boy. I’m so sorry. You’re gonna be okay. Look what I brought.” He reaches into the bag he had hastily thrown together before leaving, pulling out a stuffed bear and The Book About Moomin, Mymble and Little My. “See? We can cuddle and read stories until you’re all better, sweetheart. How does that sound?”
'Iron Man just tells him to do things he was already inclined to do,' Natasha disagrees as she starts piling bodies.
'I still have a lot of work to do,' Tony looks down at the tweaks he's been making. 'You think I can take him to the workshop, let him play with Dummy and You?'
‘I don’t think I’d be welcome,’ Steve tells him and stands straighter as Tony appears in a suit and wearing sunglasses even though they’re in an underground garage.
'Perfect,' Tony claps his hands together. 'Few hours until then, but we still need to get out of here.'
'Don't be absurd,' Steve tells him. 'He'll just make himself a robot dog and everything will be fine.'
‘Seriously?’ Tony stretches and stands up. ‘After the vast array of psychological hang-ups you had to battle past, you being Captain America, in order for me to half-reliably be able to take something from your hands… You think I’m a good candidate for spilling my issues to a stranger?’
‘How the hell did he build this in a cave? And with only his own memory to guide him?!’ Steve exclaims finally. ‘I’m sorry Jarvis, explain it again?’
'Your Dada bought you a lot of paints,' Steve starts unpacking the blue storage box that Tony carried down with them earlier.
'I don't understand,' Steve admits. 'You always act like Howard was such a terrible father but...' he falters when Tony gives a fake laugh.
'Jarvis, you monitor everything in the tower,' Pepper bites her lip. 'Does that fully include the floors that aren't Tony's?'
'Nnnnaarrrgh!' he scrubs at his hair with both hands. 'Fine; I'll have to eat and get another few rooms wired before getting ready for them.'
'Right,' Tony adjusts his watch on his wrist as Steve relaxes enough for the cover to slip into his lap, 'I have a long flight ahead of me. I'll call...'
'Captain,' Jarvis speaks through the earpiece he's gotten used to wearing, 'incoming call from Agent Romanov.'
'Is it extremis?' Steve is carding his fingers through Tony's hair. 'I mean, computers think really quickly? Are you having really realistic dreams?'
'You're trying to kiss me,' Tony continues. 'You love it when I bite you, but you're close and you want my tongue in your mouth, don't you?'
'You think Steve can cope with loosing another friend?' Rhodey asks. 'Because that's what'll happen here, Tony. How will he be able to trust you after this?'
'Yeah,' Steve smiles at him as he pulls back a little. 'You've been working really hard lately; can we, just tonight, go to sleep and wake up together?'
‘Do you particularly wish for sir to have just woken before you speak to him, Captain?’ Jarvis asks. ‘As he is awake at this time.’
Steve smiles as Tony takes a distracted bite of the sandwich and then gives it a confused look even as Steve guides him to where Pete is sitting.
'Dummy gave me some toast which he had run over,' Tony tells him, a little distracted by his building sense of worry.
'Sure,' Steve feels his own smile falter. 'I don't know how things would have played out if I hadn't become...' he waves towards his body vaguely, 'but I'd like to think I helped.'
‘Hey, Big Guy,’ Tony flips back the visor and smiles as Steve viciously quells the urge to back away or raise his shield.
'I missed him too,' Steve looks away. 'I just needed time to... I couldn't work out if you really wanted me here.'
'I will, of course, help him in any way I can,' the AI continues, 'but may I make a request of you, Captain?'
'I'm getting food sent to the communal floor for dinner,' Tony tells him. 'I need to introduce Pete to the others. You'll be there?'
'Sounds good,’ he renews his efforts to smile back. ‘I was thinking; if you're going to be working I might take Pete out for a few hours? I mean, if that's ok?'
'You just need to apologise,' Rhodey puts a hand on his shoulder. 'Explain why you didn't tell him and hope he understands.'
Tony makes an odd noise in his throat as he shifts over and presses his face into Steve's arm. Steve thumps his head into his pillow as Tony's hand curls around his bicep to keep him in place.
'Just calling to tell you I'll be out of town for a few days,' she reports. 'I have a lead I need to chase down.'
'Hello, sweetie,' Pepper stands up and moves to Tony. 'I brought you this,' she offers him a soft blue blanket.
'I didn't think he'd willingly leave your side,' he smiles as Tony's focus visibly flicks to his little display every few seconds.
'Well, it will be a shame to have no reason to be in your room anymore; you're such a charmer in the mornings.'
It takes until Tony is pressing kisses just under his naval for Steve to realise Tony's intended destination. His hips jerk a little and Tony's thumbs press against his hips gently.
'Lovely woman. She was a surrogate for me but we don't have any contact other than that,' he smiles.
‘Tony, it’s Steve,’ he reaches out slowly to clasp Tony’s shoulder when he sees recognition dawn in the other’s eyes.
'Ok,' she raises her hand to her face in an aborted motion to bite her nails. 'Work on this today but if you loop again take the day off, do you understand?'
'Sir occasionally apologises in strange ways,' Jarvis tells him, and then adds 'and sometimes before anyone realises he's done anything that needs apologise for.'
'I shouldn't feel so lost without him,' Steve shakes his head. 'We've barely been together for a week.'
'Dada needs the helipad for the Queenjets,' Pete tells her with giant innocent eyes that Tony can't pull off anymore.
'It's meant to,' Pete tells him. 'It flips, see?' The car drives into the sofa and flips itself over to move off again in the opposite direction.
'I am not certain, Captain. Sir seems to have experienced a panic attack, but I am uncertain as to the cause.'
At one point Steve feels that he and Jarvis are both on the verge of tears from just not being able to communicate enough. Steve does not understand technical language and Jarvis, for all his brilliance, is not used to dealing with anyone other than Tony. And it is fair to say Tony is quite a bit smarter than Steve when it comes to technology.
'Valid concern,' Rhodey wrinkles his nose, 'but doesn't he have a pack of lawyers that probably need some exercise?'
'Come on, Cap,' Tony calls to him and Steve realises they've started to move off without him. 'I'm taking Hulk to see the ducks.'
'Well,' she turns back to them, 'whatever it was he found he's wiped the data from here. Chances are he has the only copy now.'
'Here,' Steve puts a stack of pancakes in front of Tony and pours syrup over the lot, 'I'll take Pete and you eat those.'
'Productive afternoon?' he asks as his other team mates become more involved with the building project.
'Good afternoon, sir,' Jarvis has long given up speaking to Tony before there's proof of the genius' consciousness. 'You passed out on your desk a little over seven hours ago.'
'Approximately two months,' Jarvis tells him. 'Doctor Banner will have a better idea of when it will be best to open the incubator closer to the time.'
He stops visiting Tony’s workshop though. And avoids the family room in the early hours of the morning when Tony tends to emerge.
Steve, Bruce, Clint and Natasha are just chatting in the area that’s become their communal living space when suddenly the lights adjust down, some music starts playing quietly and the door opens. Tony steps though holding the suitcase suit, which he drops by the door, and a tablet.
‘Fuck, this is a whole new level of hell. I made Captain America cry. I’ll be facing a firing squad in the morning, just you wait and see. The President himself will pull the trigger and I’ll be dead. Please stop…’
'Don't think being a dad is going to keep me out of the workshop,' Tony reassures him with a grin. 'I'm going to be a better father than Howard, but I can't give up working.'
Steve visibly hesitates, but then his shoulders slump a little and he picks up the basket. Tony steps well out of his way as he moves to the lift and watches as he steps inside.
'Don't listen to him,' Steve retorts, 'your Dada is a massive cheat, he just talks his way out of it after.'
'Not on purpose!' Steve objects. 'I was looking at how... how this sort of thing works but I forgot I'd asked Jarvis to refer me to direct me to pages with references to Stark when relevant so it...'
Tony opts for pressing a kiss to Steve's lips over some awkward expression of his feelings. Thankfully Steve is a god among men and not only allows this blatant avoidance behavior but encourages it by pulling Tony tight against him.
'Time to get the charging net into place,' Tony presses the final sensor for the ballroom into position.
'I saw you on tv,' Steve adds, somewhat at a loss as to what to say as Tony isn't really saying anything.
‘You left him on his own?’ she snaps at him as she pushes passed him and through the door to Tony’s room. ‘He hates hospitals; you can’t let him wake up here alone. Do you understand?
What does that say about Steve's capabilities as a leader and as a boyfriend that Tony thinks he would withhold something this important?
‘You live with me,’ Tony’s voice is deadened though the suit so Steve can’t tell his reaction to this.
A group of people in body armour are attacking a bank and firing canisters of gas at anyone who gets close enough. It’s all very destructive and upsetting, but pretty easily dealt with as they are not even mutants.
'No, I need to know how their experiment worked. Our entire roll out plan for arc reactor power depends on it.'
Steve starts painting an Iron Man suit with a child's proportions; Tony should get a kick out of it.
‘How long have you been sitting there, by the way? Also, of course he’s real. Do you think I’d have put that much effort into programming a simulation that argues with me at every possible turn?’
Steve gives him a slightly confused look but just smiles when Tony catches his wrist to tow him to the sofa. He slumps against the blonde's side as Steve starts looking through the list of movies and doesn't pay attention to what's chosen.
'He knows we're together so he'll think it's odd if you call me...' he presses call and raises the phone to his ear.
'Isn't much to tell,' Clint shrugs as he sprawls in his chair. 'Tony got a tip that there was an AIM base, we went, he hacked, we conquered.'
'A garden?' he gives Steve a bemused look. 'One, yes, of course there's a garden; it's a mansion. Two, haven't you been there before? And Three, he isn't going to be playing in the garden.'
He cuts himself off as Pete comes round the sofa, his eyelids at half mast, and clambers his way into his father's lap,
'We're good here,' he tells the archer. 'Tony's keeping him calm so we should have Bruce back shortly.'
'You can trust me,' Steve tries a smile and hopes he's not all over with blood; he didn't think to check. 'It's ok. Do you want to come out here? I'm sure I can find you some juice if you're thirsty?'
'Perhaps Doctor Richards' thesis is simply incorrect,' Jarvis suggests. 'He has had incorrect theories before.'
'If I just wait,' Tony hopes he'll understand, 'then he'll love both of them, right? And then, when I tell him, he won't be able to stop spending time with Pete too.'
'That's what I need to speak to you about,' Pepper smiles at him so he doesn't worry. 'I need you to come home.'
'Sir is well, Ms Potts,' she knows from his tone that Jarvis hasn't pretended to misunderstand the question. 'His main concern at this time is Master Peter as the child fully reflects how sir, himself, was at that age.'
It's upsetting to realise how little Tony trusts him, but knowing what he now knows he can hardly be angry with him.
'Oh?' Tony acts surprised. 'Well, you're bunking with me, of course, as we raise our scientifically generated family together,' he grins teasingly.
'I...' Steve shifts away uncomfortably and freezes as his movement causes Pete to stir and grumble to his right.
'We're grateful,' Steve tells him earnestly, 'for everything you do for us. I'm sure we'll all do anything we can to help with your sons.'
'I have a Board Meeting,' Tony pet his son's hair absently, 'can you two look after him for a few hours?'
'Then we'll see if there's anything you want and get a coffee and a muffin. Or maybe not a muffin. I'm a little sick of muffins.'
'Jarvis,' Steve calls out as he gathers up some paper to start drafting his report of the mission, 'can you order me a camera? There should be photos of this time and I'm not sure Tony will remember to take any.'
Tony curls against his chest with a hum as Steve's hands settle on his bare hips and then rub up under his t-shirt before hugging him close.
'What's wrong?' Tony repeats. 'Tell me or I swear on my suit I'll have the jet fired up and bringing me back home so I can get it out of you myself.'
'Jarvis taught me to take photos and videos,' Steve blushes as he gestures with his phone. 'And showed me how to save them to the server.'
'Ok,' Pepper sighs, and pours herself some wine and tops off his scotch, 'I'll give you time to think about it.'
‘Stand on my feet,’ Tony instructs then they’re airborne the split second Steve is gripping the armour’s shoulders. Steve yelps and clutches an arm around the suit’s neck to press himself closer to his ride.
'Ms Potts is in her office downstairs,' Jarvis tells him, 'in a conference call with Tokyo. Captain Rogers is still out for his run and is the other side of the city.'
'I just... What we did earlier...' Steve is suddenly very aware of being in out in public and hurries into the relative privacy of an alleyway.
'Please,' Steve actually begs, 'please, Tony. I will never let this happen again. Not with Pete and not with Jim...'
‘Yes,’ Steve smiles in amusement, ‘but as he’s not real then it basically counts as talking to yourself.’
Steve puts Pete into the bed in his own room, makes sure he isn't too close to the edge and that he has his blanket. He presses a kiss to his forehead and crouches by the bed for a minute making sure Pete is definitely asleep.
Steve finds himself standing close enough to Tony’s stool that the billionaire can rest against his chest.
'Hmm...' Tony waves a hand dismissively as he pours over the new data. 'Jay, let's get the data side by side.'
'I'm a ninety year old virgin,' Steve speaks through his violent blush. 'And you're... everything I could want.'
‘I’m going back to the tower,’ Steve declares immediately. ‘You guys debrief; I need to check on Tony.’
'Thanks,' Tony hesitates for a moment before reaching to take his son. As soon as Pete is transferred Tony turns and walks away.
'Whenever Pete wakes up,' Tony replies. 'Jarvis, bump it up half a percent and run the numbers again.'
'Ok, we know whatever it did happened sometime last night because we agree on what has happened since I woke up.'
'Make it breakfast for three and you're on,' his expression is teasing but Steve thinks the invite is genuine.
'There's no downside,' Tony interrupts. 'Either Cap gets it and everything is fine or he's angry, but he'll be angry with me, not with Jim. If the only fall out is Cap being furious with me,' he shrugs, 'then I'm definitely doing the right thing.'
'All day, sir? Or do you plan to dismiss Captain Rogers after breakfast so you might prepare to see him at lunch?'
'I do,' the AI replies. 'I can only beg your forgiveness, Captain. I did only what I thought was right.'
'Now, perhaps,' Thor nods, 'but as your sword arm strengthens the weight shall merely feel welcome.'
Steve has taken to sketching in the corner of Tony’s workshop exclusively because after a few minutes Tony forgets he’s there and so doesn’t make conversation.
'Have you two been introduced?' Tony waves a hand vaguely. 'Pete, the voice without a face is Jarvis; he's my best friend and he looks after us, ok?'
“Hey, shhh, it’s all right, baby. Papa and I will always have you, promise. You, me, Papa and little Petey, we’re all family.” Tony shushes Wanda, mouthing another thank you to Stephen who heads to the door to show himself out. “We love you so much, baby girl. Now, you just sleep and I’ll be right here.” He assures quietly, brushing back the girl’s red hair and kisses her forehead to lull her to sleep.
Tony and Steve wave after Peter till they cannot see him anymore and then embrace each other in a hug.
“That’s it, hon, just a little.” Steve says. “You’re both gonna be just fine.” He leans down and gives Peter a quick kiss, then Wanda. “We love you two so much.”
'Thank you for the flowers,' Steve decides to display his good manners rather than argue pointlessly.
He watches Pete walk away talking to Jarvis using his own ear bud before collecting what turns out to be a cold coffee,
‘I’m sorry!’ Steve blurts in case Tony doesn’t already know. ‘I’m sorry for making you think I was… I’m sorry I offended Jarvis. And you.’
'I believe you wished to keep Peter from being separated from you when it would have clearly caused him pain,' Jarvis replies promptly.
'I might be wrong,' Pepper allows. 'People hero worship Tony all the time and Steve doesn't have that many friends.'
'SHIELD are on the way to clean up,' Natasha tells them. They've moved to the clearer end of the lab and away from the bodies.
'Good,' Steve arches his back and pulls off his t-shirt as Tony sits back to give him space. Tony grinds down against his crotch and Steve makes a strange yelping-whining noise and clutches and Tony's hips.
'I'll see if any of the others want to come,' he adds, strangely desperate to continue the conversation.
'Let's be fair here; you and Pepper broke up because the two of you were too busy running SI to have time for each other.'
Steve bites his lip and grips hard on the console as he watches Tony work. Natasha and Clint stay outside and Steve guesses it's to give them some privacy; he appreciates it.
'He's...' she pauses and gets off the lift at the penthouse as she considers her wording. 'I think there's a situation arising that could be quite... catastrophic.'
'Hey,' he calls softly as he ducks down to look behind some machinery. Sure enough there's a small boy, maybe three or four years old, curled up in the tiny gap. 'Hey, it's alright now. You're safe.'
'Hello,' Pete glances to Tony, 'I'm Peter.' He pauses and tips his head as he thinks, 'I'm Peter Jarvis Stark of...' he looks at Tony beseechingly.
'It's super soldier proof,' he latches to that as a subject he knows about. 'That baby has offensive and defensive capabilites, can handle the way you drive like a maniac and is so green that polar bears want to have its babies.'
He immediately spots Steve sitting on his couch with the TV quietly playing some cartoon. Steve looks up and their eyes meet briefly before Tony concentrates on his son. Pete is fast asleep, hugging his blanky, with his head in Steve's lap.
Steve makes an awesome whimpering noise as Tony turns towards him and starts kissing his way down the blonde's neck.
Steve can't concentrate on what it is that Tony's doing other than that there's suction and heat and friction all in the right ways. Occasionally Tony will pull away just enough to make him whine before sucking him all the way back in.
Initially he tries to talk Tony into telling the Doctors so they can monitor him properly but Tony refuses,
'It's fine,' Steve gives him a tight smile and shifts the arm Tony had been leaning on to the top of the sofa. He then blushes as Tony just tucks himself under his arm.
'Those are coming with us, huh?' Pete scrambles back over into his arms and manages to jab him in the neck with the sword hilt.
'Jogging isn't my thing,' Tony replies easily, 'but I'm sure I can think of an activity we could do together that'll work up a sweat.'
'I love it when it's your turn to cook,' Clint grins as Steve and Bruce carry in covered serving plates on trays.
'Captain,' the AI sounds amused, 'I am able to have a little understood but active incubator, containing a live foetus, moved across the county and installed into sir's workshop without alerting SHIELD. I also avoided allowing any unauthorised access to the technology involved in the incubator or housed in said workshop. I assure you; arranging for some sand to be cleared away is not strenuous.'
'You moved as far away as the penthouse and whatever happened still affected you without affecting Captain Rogers,' Jarvis points out.
Steve's expression has flickered from arousal to disappointment and from embarrassed to reluctant acceptance very quickly,
'Why not?' Tony agrees. 'Apparently I'm going to be gaining a space in the garage after the Gala...'
Though, to be entirely fair, the confusion comes from Bruce being the first person to move in. It’s just that people assume Tony was there first but Tony has returned to Malibu with Pepper.
Pete wasn't sure what that meant except that Thor then drew a sword and told Pete he'd show him sword stuff.
'Cap,' Tony grins at him from over on the couch as soon at the doors open. He's shed his suit jacket but is still wearing the dress shirt and suit pants, his shoes have gone as well. 'Come in. You need a drink?'
'I was going to strip to my boxers,' Tony turns to smirk at him. 'If that would meet with your approval? '
Steve is professional enough that when he's fighting with the Avengers he doesn't look up to watch Tony fly overhead. That doesn't mean he doesn't know where the man is.
Steve blinks himself awake to find himself still in the workshop. There's a ragged blanket draped over him and he smiles before remembering the events of the previous day.
'I plan to be quite a lot more restrained than that,' she stands up. 'Will that be all, Mister Stark?'
Tony settles himself between Steve's legs and peppers his thighs with suckling kisses. He runs his tongue across his balls and nudges Steve until he moves his legs further apart and plants his feet. The first swipe of his tongue over Steve's hole produces a surprised gasp and he sees the soldier's cock jolt.
The boy on Steve's lap then squirms enough to get to the floor and run to the man who is apparently his father.
'Good morning, Mr Stark,' Pepper smiles at him as she brings a suit out of the closet and lays it on the bed by Steve's feet.
'Fear not,' Thor smiles at him, 'I shall give you lessons with your blade and during such sessions you shall be able to draw it.'
'Will Master Stark be joining you?' Alfred has prepared three plates of food, two of which he places on a small table across the kitchen.
'Thor is going to teach Pete sword fighting?' Steve asks quietly as the others all cluster around the coffee machine.
As he moves to stand up Pete suddenly throws himself backwards out of his arms and scrambles across his father's legs to the other side of the bed,
'Statistically that is quite likely,' Tony points out. 'The mother get's to make the choice if she doesn't want the father involved.'
'Look, I like Cap,' Tony gestures vaguely. 'We're getting along alright and he's settling in better now. I don't think suddenly having a child is going to help. And having a child with me? When we're only just at the stage were he feels he can tease me? And with him coming from the 40s? No, it'll throw him off his stride when he's only just found it.'
Fury is telling them about the various events across the globe that SHEILD are aware of, but that don't require the attention of the Avengers themselves. Steve takes it upon himself to offer the team out as individual assistants; he hates the idea of anyone coming to harm because someone thought that the threat didn't warrant the attention of the legitimate superhumans.
Steve carries his muffins onto his floor and places them on the coffee table. He glares at them for a moment.
'Ah, yes,' his AI replies, 'nothing says I'm sorry I didn't tell you you're about to become a father like baked goods.'
'Right,' Bruce looks amused. 'Well, while experimenting with a subdermal chip we had a bit of a malfunction. It may have exploded, under my skin, when it came into contact with my blood.'
‘I… there must be…’ Steve clenches his fist to prevent himself from reaching for Tony to give him a shake.
'Is this going to be another situation where I remind you what sort of doctor I actually am?' Bruce looks over. 'Oh, hello.'
Anyway. While he’s downstairs being still and quiet, and so invisible to Tony, he sees the bots hand things to Tony all the time; tools, drinks, food… the list goes on.
Seeing Tony without the arc reactor in his chest is still surprising. The genius strides across the room to join him in the bed and immediately presses a kiss to Steve's lips. Steve tugs him closer until their lying pressed together.
'His name is Peter Jarvis Stark, he's three and a half and he's the best drain on my resources that I've ever created.'
Steve has been sitting down quietly for about half an hour now and as he’s mostly convinced that Tony can only see things if they’re shiny, moving or loud (preferably all three) it’s safe to say he’s invisible to the resident genius.
'Making the holes for Jarvis' sensors,' Tony gestures vaguely with the tiny drill in his hand. 'Once I have them all made I can insert the sensor net and then I have to install the induction charging under the floors above. Pepper made me promise not to rip anything out of the way...'
‘Tony!’ Steve raises his voice over his friend’s. ‘I’m sorry about the other day; I never meant to make you uncomfortable.’
Tony looks terrible; he’s leaning heavily against a workbench, his skin pale and shining with sweat. That’s bad enough but Steve can’t tear his eyes from the empty hole in Tony’s chest where the arc reactor should be.
'Alright,' Steve agrees and shifts Pete in his arms until he isn't being stabbed. 'Tony, are you coming?'
'Iron Man, wait...!' Steve calls out too late as Tony walks into the room and scowls through his open faceplate.
'Yes, ma'am,' he smiles back before shrugging helplessly, 'sorry, Pepper. It's... It just seems nice, you know?'
He can see Tony has closed his eyes for two long precious seconds. His eyes flick over to the helmet before he keeps working.
'He must be...' he rakes his fingers through his hair in desperation as he searches desperately between the other shoppers.
‘I would stay quite large. Pretty certain actually. Yep. Definitely poisoned,’ the armour lands beside him and stumbles to its knees.
'I brought Tony's things,' she walks past carrying a suit bag and a small selection of toiletries. 'Is he still in the shower?'
'The device may be obtaining power from the Universe itself and unplugging it may end all of creation,' Jarvis informs him dryly.
Steve takes the lift down as far as the communal floor and then sets about preparing the massive batch of coffee for when the others start arriving.
'If there's a better babysitting option than Captain America then it's got to be additional Avengers,' Tony agrees and taps his eyepiece before lifting back into the air.
Steve is barely getting over the size of the suite he'll be staying in when he hears a knock at the door.
‘The strength of the signal is decreasing,’ Jarvis adds after Tony’s interruption. ‘I calculate it should cease altogether in six days and hypothesize sir’s memory should return at that time.’
'Pete,' he smiles at his son beside him, 'get your sword, ok? You're going to play with Thor and Clint while I go to work with Auntie Pepper.'
'Hey, I may not be as smart as you, but I know being paid nothing four times is still nothing,' Steve pokes him in the side.
Steve walks back upstairs feeling somewhat crushed but mostly confused. Sitting down on one of the large sofas he doesn’t immediately notice Pepper is round.
'Wow!' Pete sits on the floor as his gift opens up to be a long knife in an elegantly crafted scabbard.
'Tony, you know I don't want to take him away from you, right?' He tries a smile, 'you're his Dada.'
'You should get some more sleep,' Steve tells him even as he steps closer with the clear intention of catching him if he falls.
He hurls his shield at another man trying to flank Tony from the side away from Hulk and catches it on the rebound as he spins to check behind them.
'You cry out wordlessly as you come. You buck into my tight fist and your come splatters between us.
'Tony, I need you to take some deep breaths for me, ok?' Tony realises there's something warm cradling his head. 'Tony? Can you hear me?'
'I'll miss you,' Steve stops himself from reaching for Tony so that he doesn't rumple his suit. Tony smiles and then sweeps out of the door and is gone.
'And if he doesn't?' Tony swallows back the last of whatever it was Dummy had blended for him. 'If he never forgives me?'
Luckily Tony doesn't seem to notice as he's found Steve's coffee from earlier. Once he's finished that, he presses a quick kiss to his son's head and heads back to Steve's room.
'That's true,' Tony agrees with a sudden grin, 'I'll stay with you, and the three kids and Pepper can live up here!'
'We lost Pete!' he hisses desperately down the phone. 'Jarvis, bring up all the cameras covering the exits and the surrounding streets. Can you access the cameras inside?'
He cuts himself off as he watches Dummy drop a piece of toast, run over it, scoop it back into the plate and then present it to him.
Steve would disapprove but Tony is asleep in his arms and he would pretty much have to let him go if he wanted to be in a meeting with Fury. Letting Tony out of his sight is just something that isn't going to happen right now. And it's not as though he could convince Tony to come with him.
'Sorry?' Tony splutters. 'You came in your pants, untouched, from giving me head; Rogers, that's unreasonably hot.' He pulls Steve back into a kiss, 'very, very hot, Steve.'
‘Yeah,’ Tony huffs and drops his head back against the wall. ‘Cap, get them to bring my armour up to me, will you?’
Natasha did say that the people that knew before him were probably the ones to convince Tony to tell him.
Clint and Natasha are both in off-duty mode so they have nothing to do other than hang around the TV or the gym or the kitchen and suddenly if Steve wants to reliably have an hour just for himself he has to retreat to his own floor.
He's completed the sensor net installation in the hallway, and the small room between the ballroom and the entrance hall, now he's doing the blue lounge and next he'll tackle the entrance hall itself.
'Shit!' Tony shoves some of the toast into his mouth and runs to the lift. He chugs his coffee on the ride down and abandons his mug just off of the lift on Steve's floor.
When Tony praises him again, the boy cannot help but wonder what he did that was so brave. He just had a weird nap and then woke up to Stephen smiling down at him. His arm is a bit of a bummer though, with the cast being so heavy and stiff.
“I don't wanna nap.” Wanda pouts. “I’m gonna have bad dreams.” She hates having nightmares, and she hates bothering her Daddies when they happen so she often ends up just curling up into a ball in her bed and crying herself to sleep afterwards. “Daddy, do you think that Stephen could give me medicine that'll make me stay awake forever?”
“Nu uh! Wanna go home, Dada! Papa!” Peter continues to wail and squirm around, which only makes his pain worse. He tries to get away from Stephen, but he can hardly get far, so he plops down on the bed and kicks his legs since he can’t throw his arms around.
Wanda breathes a sigh of relief. The past week has been so stressful, so full of fear that she is going to be cast out and abandoned by the people who she loves the most in the whole entire world. She giggles as Tony kisses her forehead and looks up to meet his eyes.
“Hey, bud. How’s your dinner? Is it yummy or super yummy?” Thomas says cheerfully, coming over and lowers the bedrail to sit at Peter’s side.
“Magic? Where's magic?” He mostly expected to see sparkles, unicorns and knights in shining armour. Maybe some wizards too.
“Yes! Angelica.” Wanda decides, referring to the plush polar bear that she keeps on her bed. “'Cause when I get scared at night and I think bad things when I'm asleep she gives me hugs and makes it better.”
She splashed a little and hums to herself, suddenly lost in her own little world. It is pleasant and bright and full of bubbles. It is all hers.
“Yeah! Blue. Like sky.” Peter points upwards, even though they cannot see the sky from the hospital room. “And like…sea." There are so many colours to choose from, but he definitely thinks blue might just be his favourite. At least it is right now. “Dada says… Says colour on it.” He adds, remembering what Tony said about how his friends at daycare could sign his cast.
“I talked to the ortho on call and he wants to realign the bone surgically to ensure that there’s no long term damage. It’s quite a standard procedure, we get Littles with injuries like these all the time.” Stephen explains, seeing the worry and panic of the two Daddies’ faces. “There’s a spot in the OR tomorrow morning.” He adds.
Except it didn’t pass by the next day and instead got worse and worse. By the third day, when none of the medication Tony and Steve had access to over the counter had zero effect, the husbands had no choice but to bring their baby girl to the doctor. Once there, Wanda got diagnosed with pneumonia and got a prescription for some antibiotics, which she refused to take without a good fight. On top of it all, Peter is beginning to act out and Steve groans out when Peter spills his juice all over their breakfast table on purpose.
“I love you so so much, baby, and I’ll see you as soon as the magic is over, yeah? Be brave for Dada.”
“You’re so brave, bud.” Thomas smiles and pulls out a lollipop from his pocket, offering it to Peter. “Here, you can have this after you’ve finished your dinner, yeah? I’ll see you tomorrow morning.” The nurse says and then stands up from the bed, putting the rail back up. “Then, if you guys don’t have any more questions...” The nurse says, looking at the two Daddies.
“Yeah, baby. We can play.” Steve promises, sitting down to do just that. “Honey, I’m sorry if we haven’t been giving you enough attention. I know it’s hard, and you’ve been so good. Sometimes Daddies make mistakes too. But, I’ll do better now and you and I are gonna spend some special time together. I would love to play with you now.” He holds his arms out. “Can I have a big hug, sweetheart?”
“Well, honey, you’ve got a nasty case of pneumonia. The good news is that your Daddies are taking good care of you and I think you’ll be better soon.” Stephen promises the little girl, patting her shoulder. Wanda looks up at Tony and holds her arms out.
“I brought your popsicles, that’s right. Do you want to try one? We can go down and have one now if you want.” Steve says. “Then dinner and a bath.”
Peter does not quite grasp the complexity of Steve’s apology, but all he needed to hear was that his Papa wants to play with him and he grins widely. He hops down from the bed and pads over to give his Papa a big hug. After a moment, he pulls back and points to his doll house.
“You can keep Pooh with you while the machine does its work, okay? But, your Daddy and I will have to go behind that glass over there. There’s a speaker and microphone in there, so you can hear us and talk to us, okay?” Stephen explains, getting Peter into position on the bed and making sure his head is still.
“’M a good princess, make everyone happy.” He says. Tony chuckles softly at the sweet interaction between the Little siblings as he continues to wash Wanda’s bottom half.
“I know it feels funny, baby, but it's good for you. It lets us know how sick you are.” Steve tries to explain. “You’ve gotta trust that we wouldn't hurt you. I know… I know that's hard to believe sometimes. But I promise it's true. Come on, angel, can you try to be good for Papa and Daddy? I promise it'll be okay.”
“Yes, you’re being a really brave and big girl.” Tony praises as he pulls down Wanda’s pyjamas and underwear once more. “ And not just yet, but soon.” He chuckles when the girl gets a bit impatient. He then inserts the thermometer carefully and holds it in place while stroking the girl’s hair with his free hand. “You’re being so good for me.”
“I'll try to keep her occupied, so he doesn't have to see much of her playing.” Steve suggests. “We should try to plan some activities that he can do from home or in bed. I'll go out and buy some new colouring books for him and maybe some new stories to read. I'll ask him what he wants.”
“I promise I’ll play with you soon, baby. Papa just has to go help. Can you hang on for just a minute?” Steve feels awful with Peter looking up at him with those sweet, melt-your-heart eyes. “I won’t be long.” With that, he rushes upstairs to find Tony, mentally promising himself he will play with Peter soon. “What is it, babe?”
“That is absolutely right, baby. Great job. I’m so proud of you! Now let’s go to daycare, you can do some more counting there. Do you want to say goodbye to your sister?”
“Can you lift your head for me, bud?” Thomas asks, coming over with a cap to put on Peter’s head. The boy nods and lifts his head up so Thomas can put the cap on. He reaches up to touch it curiously. He wonders why he needs to have something on his head when they are inside and it is not rainy or snowing.
“You are a big boy, angel. I promise.” Steve kisses his cheek. “You’re just a big boy who needs diapers. That’s okay. And thank you for using your manners, but you’re just gonna have to trust Papa on this one, okay?”
“There we go.” Thomas announces as he gets the clothing off of Peter completely without hurting his arm. “Put this one on him once you’ve changed him then.” The nurse says and gestures to the gown that he put at the bottom of the bed.
“So, you’re here because of your hurt arm, right? Well, tomorrow, like super early in the morning, we’re gonna get that fixed. I’ll come here with doctor Stephen and we’ll take a look at your arm and get you all ready to go upstairs. Up there, magic happens...” Thomas says a little dramatically. Peter widens his eyes in interest.
“It's luckily just a mild concussion.” Stephen says, having studied the images while Peter was in the scanner. “We'd better get his arm x-rayed quickly, so that he can have a rest. But, take a minute to calm him down. You did such a good job, Peter.”
“Listen to Papa, princess.” Tony warns before Wanda can begin on insisting that she will play with her brother. “Can you turn over? We gotta check your temp.” Tony explains. The thermometer he has in his hand is all ready with a single use plastic cover with some light lubrication on it to ease the temperature taking process for everyone. Wanda shakes her head, sticking her trembling lower lip out in a pout.
“Are you hungry, honeybee? We should get you something to eat.” Tony says, getting one of the extra pillows so that Peter’s hurt arm can be propped up a bit comfortably.
“Hmm, is okay.” Peter nods. To be honest, he would not mind a nap as long as he gets to cuddle with Papa and lay on him while he sleeps. He always has the best naps when cuddling with someone. “We go cuddle?” He suggests, pointing to his bed where he left Pooh.
“Yeah, okay.” Tony says, gently swaying Peter in his arms as they head to yet another part of the hospital. But, Stephen leads the way confidently. At this point, Peter is just accepting that things are happening to him, but whines now and then to still let the grown ups know that he is unhappy.
“Bad.” Peter parrots in his high chair, kicking his legs again and hitting the table from underneath. “Ah, ah! No kicking. Wanda, sit properly and eat your food.” Tony corrects both Littles, pointing to the portion that Steve has given Wanda on her plate.
She is a big enough girl to do it herself, but Steve and Tony still check whether she did a good enough job cleaning before letting her go. Peter, on the other hand, thinks the toothbrush is meant for chewing and sucking on rather than brushing. Wanda brushes her  teeth as well as she can, then shows her Daddy with a big smile.
Peter looks around to try and answer his Papa, but then he meets Gabby the paramedic’s eyes and freaks a little. As nice as the paramedic is, he is starting to get a bit overwhelmed with everything and just wants to go home. He tugs on the straps that keep him in place on the gurney in a sitting position. The side rails are also up and Peter is very much trapped.
“M’gonna...” she suddenly throws herself onto the floor and throws up in a wastebasket, chest heaving. Before Tony can answer Steve besides a simple nod, his attention is drawn back to Wanda who suddenly looks really unwell. For a second, Tony wonders if they pushed the girl too far with the temperature taking. When Wanda scrambles up, Tony goes and follows her on instinct and pulls her hair back when she throws up.
“You can always call Stephen if you need some advice you know? And I can stay home tomorrow and look after him so you get a break.” Steve suggests when he sees that Tony is stressed and overthinking stuff. He brings his husband into a hug and rubs his back.
“I know, baby boy. I’m really sorry and I will play with you later. But, Daddy can’t take care of Wanda all on his own. Can you be a brave boy for me and wait a little while? I just need you to behave and I promise we’ll get to play, sweetheart.” He stands up and finishes getting the water. “Do you want to watch TV instead?”
“She can lie down next to you but-” He gives Wanda a serious look. “You be very careful, young lady. Understand?”
“Hm!” Peter nods and squirms out of Steve’s arms to pad over to Wanda where Tony had laid her down on the sofa. After struggling just a bit, Peter manages to climb up on the sofa and joins her sister under the blanket. “No icky.” The boy decides and then takes his pacifier out of his mouth to give Wanda some sloppy, but still very loving, kisses on her cheek. Wanda giggles and kisses her brother back.
Peter listens closely to the story, following it with his eyes and runs his fingertips over the pages and the holes in them carefully. Whenever Steve gets to the last sentence on each page, Peter says it with him softly. “Well, guess what happened after that...” He repeats, slurring the words a bit as he tries to keep up with his Papa. When the story comes to an end, Peter climbs onto Steve’s lap to face him.
Tony chuckles at how dramatic Wanda is being and takes some comfort in the fact that the girl cannot be seriously ill if she is making jokes about being cursed.
“Yeah, we’ll go see Papa. What have you been doing with Vis, then?” Tony asks, bouncing Wanda in his arms as he heads up to Peter’s room where Steve is waiting.
When Stephen says that Peter is his top priority, Tony feels himself relax considerably. But, then he just tenses up again at the mention of head scans. While Tony and Stephen converse, Steve and a nurse help Peter from the gurney and onto a hospital bed.
“Papa!” Peter chimes in, patting at Steve’s shoulder to help them understand. He and Wanda are on the same page, so why are not the Daddies?
“Good thinking.” Tony nods in agreement. “I think he said he wanted apple juice if you want to put that in, too. He also needs a bath before bed, but I’ll take care of that. Peter, come here and get your bottle, honey. It’ll take just a second.”
“We’re gonna take you upstairs now where the magic happens.” Stephen says. “We’re gonna fix your arm and put a blue cast on in.” He adds.
“No, but!” Peter tries to argue, but let’s himself be placed on his own bed. He reaches over for his Winnie the Pooh stuffie and tucks it under his arm. “Don’t wike it...” He adds when he hears how Stephen is looking through his medical bag for something. “Wanna play doc, not- no this.” Peter explains, feeling just a bit betrayed that the events turned out like this instead of him playing with the two caregivers on his play mat. He would have liked to have shown the doctor his duplo lego creations.
“That’s right. And you get to find out what it is if you’re really good for me. Can you do that?” Stephen keeps himself as calm and clear as possible. Poor Peter has had enough stress already. Before Peter can really protest, his Papa picks him up and brings him upstairs to his room. The doctor follows a step behind with his medical bag. “Can you lie on your stomach for me?”
“I know it feels better now, honey, but the doctors know what's best.” Tony explains. “I'm so sorry, baby boy. I know you wanna go home. I promise that Daddy and Papa are gonna be here with you the whole time and you'll be all better before you know it.”
“Wanda, please. This doesn't have to be hard okay? You can hold my hand if you want, but Daddy has to check so we know what's going on with you.”
“Lets get you some dinner as well.” Steve says, guiding Wanda over to the table as well and to her seats where she is sat across from her brother. That way, Steve and Tony can tend to a Little each and help them during mealtimes. Wanda gets on the chair, but sits on her knees and leans across the table closer to her brother.
"I’ll get Wanda checked out when she’s out of the bath, Steve, but I’d really like to take a look at Peter right now if I could. Just to make sure he hasn’t caught anything on too. You can never be too careful.”
“Yep, I promise. We'll go to the store and get you something new to play with. You definitely deserve it, sweetheart.” Tony smiles. “And how about next time we have movie night, you get to pick the movie?”
“No.” Wanda admits. “I wanna be happy. And I'm happy with you, Daddy. Can we watch Care Bears first? And give kisses? And hugs. I have to.” She glances over her shoulder, surveying the room before turning back to look at him. “I love you. Come on. Let’s…” She coughs slightly. “Let’s go.”
Peter gets excited at the opportunity to pick the masks. They have pretty colours with his favourite characters on them. He picks one out with puppies and points to it, motioning for Stephen to look.
“Go night night now?” It is not dark out, so he figures it must be like his nap-time. “And good dreams?” He hopes that when he wakes up he can see his Daddies and sister again. Maybe he will feel all better.
Peter is sat by his play mat in the living room, letting his Papa do all the stressing with packing his lunch and everything else he needs for his day at daycare while he plays with his animal figures. When his Papa calls for him, Peter gets up from the floor and pads over like a big boy. He shows the giraffe in his hand proudly.
“Yeah, they're sleepy, baby.” Steve gives him a kiss on the forehead. “Just like you get sometimes. And Wanda's sick so we have to let her rest. How about I finish putting these away and then you and Papa can read a story together?”
Peter smiles and sighs in relief when Steve lets Wanda join him on the bed. He closes his eyes, finally feeling content and comfortable.
“Hi, baby!” Tony smiles, having arrived before them and stands waiting with Stephen in front of the ambulance ER entrance. Stephen walks forward to greet Peter too, smiling down at him kindly.
“Ponyo!” Peter shrieks. He always suggests that movie and his family is getting quite sick of it, but they try not to show it.
“But, this is an emergency!” Steve hisses and looks around the ER to spot a doctor who is not busy. “I’ll go find him myself.” He says and heads off to the reception.
“We’ll do that in just a moment, darling. I’m sure your brother would love for you to draw on his cast.” Steve says, not quite understanding Wanda’s inner conflict. He lets the clothes soak for a while and comes over to Wanda. “Princess, I think you should put on a pull-up for a while. Just to be safe, okay? You don’t have to use it, but I want you to have it still.” He says, trying to be gentle, but also a bit firm to get the girl to obey.
“You’re right, Stephen.” Steve sighs. “I’ll talk to him. Thank you, Stephen.” Steve smiles before heading back into the room with Stephen, but the doctor does not stay and picks up his bag to head to Wanda’s room to check on the girl next. However, Steve remains with Peter and crouches down in front of him on the bed, trying to figure out what to say.
When Steve finally shows up with Peter in his arms later in the afternoon, he cannot help but smile at the sight of Tony and Wanda cuddled up together on the couch. He sets Peter down along with some groceries he picked up on the way home and whispers.
