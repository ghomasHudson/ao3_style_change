Holmes considers for a moment, “He still thinks that she’s what makes John happy.”
“Hey, it's time to wake up,” John hummed, carefully nudging Sherlock, “So wake up.”
“Because,” he pauses briefly to examine his eyes, coming to a conclusion, “I love you, you idiot.”
; I think once people get to know me they see me as abrasive and would rather not have anything to do with me. I’ve also never really taken to casual flings. I work well alone.”
“I don’t…” Sherlock started, but trailed off in confusion, a rare occurrence of uncertainty tainting his tone.
"I can't feel my ears," Sherlock complains, placing his now gloveless cold hands over his even colder ears for some semblance of warmth.
Sherlock smiles courteously, “And it’s good to meet an old friend of John’s; you’ll have to tell me all the embarrassing stories you have on him.”
John asks what his plans are and Sherlock says he’s going undercover, should take about six months.
. He is given a box as a gift which he deduces contains diamond cufflinks and he callously points out that all his cuffs have buttons. John translates his dismissal in to polite human for the gifter, forcing Sherlock to say “Thank You” himself.
He debates simply moving on, leaving Sherlock’s cock untouched, but it is long and thin and beautiful and one teasing kiss couldn’t hurt, could it? He breathes warmly over the shaft, noticing the roll of the lanky man’s hips as he strives to gain any sort of contact there. He places a kiss to the frenulum reverently, but moves on much too quickly for Sherlock’s liking.
Mycroft rolls his eyes and sighs heavily before holding his hand out, “Then give them to me.”
After awhile, John obviously is growing uncomfortable lying on his left shoulder for so long, so - however unwillingly - Sherlock lets go of his hand and guides him gently to his back. John turns his face away from him and Sherlock is disgruntled to find that he misses looking at his face.
It seems like a sweet move on her part, but it leaves a foul taste the mouths of Holmes and Watson.
This raises a shy smile from Sherlock who maintains an open posture, waiting for John’s reaction. It comes a moment later when John separates their hands (leaving Sherlock bereft for a moment) and wraps his arms around the taller man’s body instead. Sherlock leans in, enjoying the sensation and the scent of John right in the crook of his neck where Sherlock’s nose is currently residing. Sherlock takes a sneaky inhale, storing the aroma in his mind palace before John pulls away with a bright smile.
“Quite,” Mr. Holmes said sadly, “I often had to attend the school. Pick Sherlock up with a bloodied nose or split lip. Or after having food tipped over him. He was in a dreadful state, but we told him: you have to stay there, otherwise they'll win. They'll think what they said was true.”
“He’s an arse, but he’s right,” he agrees, but he can’t help the large smile that comes to his face as he predicts what’s coming, “What’s your question?”
The sniper dots reappear and then that voice is back. There is an epic stand-off as Moriarty threatens to kill them. Sherlock and John – through another silent agreement – resolve, without hesitation, to die together if necessary.
“Jesus Christ, are you telling me Sherlock and John went in to Baskerville to deal with the glowing rabbit?!” Watson sounds offended at the notion.
It begins with Sherlock helping John and Mary plan their seating arrangement and other decisions. The wall behind the couch has been converted from a Rat Map to all of the wedding details. John, meanwhile, is sitting in his chair trying to find an interesting enough case to pull Sherlock away. It’s not working. Sherlock pulls out examples of serviettes from beneath the couch and admits that he learned to do it on YouTube. Mary fakes a phone call to get John in to the kitchen.
Watson is engrossed in reading the back of the case with his eyebrows drawn together in confusion when the other man enters.
. Also, not too fond of being reminded of Sebastian’s existence,” Watson bemoans. Sebastian, with his cocky attitude and looking down on Holmes always set him on edge. Same as he does now as they’re watching the “episode” play out.
“Why those five?”
We would never be the same again.
“I still can’t believe you punched the Chief Superintendent just because he called me a weirdo,” Holmes admires with a smile.
“See? Seduction,” Holmes points out.
“I’m for a bath,” John announced, walking into the bathroom and starting the faucet before leaving to rummage for a clean and workable towel. He had just reentered the bathroom when he noticed Sherlock sitting on the toilet seat, his long legs crossed and his hands placed demurely on his right knee.
With a narrowing of the eyes, Sherlock reached for John with both hands and grabbed him by the upper arms to pull him to the bed, forcing him onto his back. Once he had John in position, he placed himself over the older man almost territorially, claiming him, “
“Yes.”
“Obviously,” Sherlock humors him with a small eye roll, but his ecstatic smile belies the move.
After a few moments, Sherlock agrees with a smile, “I think you’ll enjoy what I come up with.”
“Everything alright?” John asked.
“How many will be there?”
“What else could it be?” Sherlock scoffed.
since his return.
Sherlock nuzzles John’s shoulder before settling on it heavily, finally relaxed enough to sleep, “Goodnight, John.”
“God, he’s such a creepy man!”
Sherlock’s hands tighten on John’s legs for a moment before he lifts his red eyes to examine John’s face reverently.
They watch as John limps his way to find a cab, phones ringing as he passes them. When a black car pulls up to take John to see Mycroft, Watson can’t help but chuckle.
“Anyway, I was excited at first. I wanted to attend the school so I could have access to the laboratories there. My parents wouldn’t let me have a full-sized one due to an incident with a crab and some solvents…but once I got there I realised my mistake. The children were horrible. Vulgar and crass, they made constant barbs about my sexuality and mannerisms, claiming I was a faggot because of my hair style and how I wore my tie. Ridiculous,” Sherlock gestured angrily, “but…Professor Ellis was there to support me.”
really love him. That’s…a good thing. Great, actually. But a bit of him twinges with sadness that it happened this way.
"Figure it out, genius," John needles him after lighting the candles and then moving back to the fire.
clearly
Sherlock’s brow furrows slightly, all the potion will allow, “I
“Well that’s not fair; some of the boys wanted to shag me, too.” John joked lightly, mostly to savor the blush it put onto Sherlock’s cheeks.
“The bloody fuck is
Sherlock and John enter Irene’s place via story of a vicar who has been attacked and a doctor who just conveniently happened to be passing by at the time. Sherlock waits in the sitting room while John is led to get a bowl of water and a towel to clear Sherlock’s face. Irene enters the room completely bared of all clothes, catching Sherlock utterly off guard. She asks him questions, practically straddling his lap by the time John enters the room.
“What, correcting grammar left and right and refusing to assist a murderer to get off of a legitimate charge?”
“Yeah, well, hearing that your best friend literally doesn’t consider that he has any other friend in the world but you can melt the ice pretty quick,” he replies honestly.
Sherlock pouted dramatically before shrugging and settling back into the sofa, unwilling to analyze the feeling of disappointment in his gut. He lost himself back in his mind palace, looking for more clues about the case before becoming distracted again. What could John have needed to do up in his room, and just how long had he been gone? With a sense of curiosity that would make even a cat jealous, Sherlock stood and made his way towards the stairs to John’s bedroom.
“For a police officer, you really do have terrible home security,” Sherlock scoffed, sitting back and arching an eyebrow, “I came in through the window. Obviously.”
Meanwhile, John is oscillating on the pavement outside 221B, debating if he enters or not. When he finally decides to, someone bumps in to him, distracting him as another man sneaks up and injects him with something in the neck.
Sherlock bites his lip as he fights a guilty feeling in his gut. He knows as well as John does that his nightmares come back when there’s a lull in the cases that involve a larger amount of leg work – the more dangerous, the better.
But, Sherlock reasons, if he can work the experiment like a lie-detector test by asking easily corroborated questions, he should be able to tell that way. He spends the rest of the day coming up with a plan, as well as a list of questions for the night.
John tensed a bit in reflex of Sherlock freezing beside him. John had known for years that he loved the madman -
Considering for a short moment, Sherlock smirks, “Never have I ever been to war.”
As he walked away, John’s heart began to ache thinking about the evening being over. It certainly hadn’t been the night he had imagined, but it had somehow been so much better. He wasn’t an idiot: he knew why it had been so easy to stand up for Sherlock and pretend to be his fiance - he’d been in love with the man for years, after all - but it was incredibly difficult to go through the motions, pretending at the life he really,
at this point ourselves?” Watson jokes, since they clearly were not talking about a glowing rabbit.
John followed Sherlock into the kitchen and sat opposite him, silently watching for a moment before speaking, “What’s going on in your head? Talk to me.”
“Oh, my dear Watson,” he began fondly, “with all of those fanciful stories you have written about us for The Strand, do you honestly think anyone would ever dream of separating us?”
Watson growls low in his throat, hand tightening on Holmes’ once more, “That’s it?” His face is set in an angry line, eyes looking betrayed.
“Where? Tunnels?” John scoffed.
Watson removes his hand from Holmes’ to be able to place the lower half of his face in his own hands once more instead. If John gives a speech like he himself had given…
John swallowed audibly but moved his fingers to Sherlock’s left nipple, circling it carefully with the pad of his finger before pinching it lightly, “Good?”
wrong and…”
Sherlock and John exchange brief glances laced with meaning whenever they can, silently attempting to solidify a plan between them.
We simply stare at each other until you move closer to the edge of your seat, and I mirror it without fully realizing. Slowly, your left hand reaches for my right and we both stare at your thumb moving softly over mine.
“Calm down,” Holmes scolds, “Jesus. Look, it was just some girl’s imagination at work.”
“I should have hit you more,” Watson says serenely, then thinks about how he hadn’t so much as slapped him upon his return and amends his statement, “I should have hit you
“Hhmm-uh,” Sherlock grumbled in annoyed dissent. He was
A few sentences from John Watson’s mouth, however, and Sherlock Holmes knows/knew what was happening before the vest was even exposed.
“I’m sorry, where is she yelling to? Where does she think they are right now?” Watson asks, face slowly heating as he points to the screen with his palm facing upwards.
“I’m invested now,” Holmes says in reply.
As if on cue, an ambulance crew enters 221B just as Sherlock begins to go in to cardiac distress from his internal bleeding. Sherlock insists to John that they can trust Mary. As he falls, John’s entire focus is on his best friend, possibly dying before him for a third time. Then he glares at Mary.
“No, I’m having fun now, aren’t you?” John asks with genuine glee.
“I don’t have much partnered experience - and nothing penetrative - but I find masturbatory activities to be quite...”
“What?” Comes the confused response, then the sound of running water.
Sherlock has always been shy about vocalizing his desires, but he has no issue
Sherlock - while not having an overtly interrupted sleep all night like John - finally, for the first time this night, settles in to a restful doze.
John nodded, “I do. Loving you has been the most natural thing I’ve ever known.”
To John’s surprise, the snoring stops as Sherlock lets out a quiet huff at the contact. He isn’t any more awake than he was just moments before, but he is blessedly, for the first time this excruciatingly long night, silent.
“I don’t understand,” Mrs. Hudson says, calming down after the shock, but still clearly perplexed as she looks between the two men expectantly.
Sherlock goes on to explain how she chose to wound him and knock out Magnussen instead of killing them both and making it appear as though John had done it. She phoned for the ambulance after walking out, ensuring that it would get to him in time.
On the other side, John was close. The desperate need to come was so intense that he could almost taste it against his tongue as he twisted his hand around the tip, smearing the precome with his thumb while he touched and circled around his frenulum.
“Yes, love,” John praises before demanding, “Fuck my cock.”
to do it rather than being forced by this stupid, ridiculous, and demeaning game they’re playing.
. It doesn’t even matter.
Watson groans and buries his face in his hands. Watching – essentially – himself get turned down flat by two people, one man and one woman, in the span of 20 minutes is just too embarrassing. The point that the male also happens to be his best friend that he has, in fact, been slowly falling in love with over the course of their friendship does not make it any easier to watch.
“You didn’t ask me to call you Sherlock,” Watson observes next as John gets out of the car to meet Sherlock at 221B.
“You know about them?” Watson asks in shock.
I honestly can’t remember who started the kiss, but suddenly you’re in my lap, kissing me as though you have never wanted anything more.
know: Mary.
“The safety was on,” Holmes argues, affronted.
“What a cock!”
The woman in the car, strapped to the vest and speaking for Moriarty. Watson shifts again upon seeing the vest that he knows he’ll see on himself in too short a while. The gut instinct to turn away, driven by all of the mental trauma induced by Moriarty throughout their dealings with him, is powerful. It took years for Watson to stop dreaming of the incident at the pool and how it could easily have turned out for the worse, and he’s not honestly sure he can see it from this third-person perspective, even with Holmes begging him to.
John nods silently in agreement and Sherlock removes the first disc before placing it in the DVD player. They sit on the couch to watch.
no case. If you must know, I’m going to text Lestrade in the cab to tell him to clean this mess up before we get back and offer to answer questions for him in the meantime. You are not to talk to anyone about this until you’ve been treated by a doctor,” he adds seriously.
Back in 221B Sherlock yells at crap telly while John slowly types away at his computer with a mere two fingers instead of ten. He always uses just the two, and Holmes secretly finds it adorable at the same time he’s driven mad by the lack of productivity it perpetuates. John leaves the flat, claiming to be going to see Sarah.
Sherlock thinks but can’t quite grasp it; he’s stuck on the fact that it sounds like John is offering to help him experiment sexually in whatever way he can, “Example,” he orders.
He storms to the desk and sits down heavily, grabbing the notebook and a pen angrily.
“But you don’t even know what it is.”
“I don’t know what to do,” Sherlock reluctantly admitted.
Sherlock is doing a convincing job pretending to be his typically bossy self, but vomits before he can finish the sentence.
Then he got an idea.
Sherlock and John don’t come to the complete understanding that Holmes and Watson had before the new picture shows up on the phone. It frustrates them both that their other selves are not on the same page as they should be. John pitches in to help anyway, because he cares about the lives at stake more than he cares about proving a point to Sherlock.
Sherlock shrugs nonchalantly, “Nightmare must have taken more out of me than I originally figured,” he lies, hoping that John’s empathy will drop the conversation now that the nightmares have been brought up again. John notoriously avoids the subject, possibly worried that it will cause one to occur.
your bloody nanny in charge of keeping you entertained!”
Sherlock looked away, staring at the fridge for a moment before twirling the glass in his hand slowly, “That -- the victim, it could have been me. If I wasn’t stronger -- if I didn’t have…” he winced as though he didn’t want to admit it, “if I didn’t have my brother. I could have ended it the same way.”
“It’s just a sprain, at worst,” John laughed, moving his hand to feel the area, “Probably just a bit bruised, really.”
When the sun begins to fade (what little was making it through the storm that's still raging), John stands to light some candles, a bit unnerved now that the power isn't back on. He turns the switch on the desk lamp as a guide for them to know when it returns.
“Whatever you want to do,” John offered honestly, “touch anywhere; taste everything. You can explore or you can catalogue, or you can simply come in for a nice snog and a cuddle before I take you; it is completely up to you.”
How could I not have realized that you were what I was looking for
“He always was a bit of a twat,” Holmes states with a smirk.
“Do you remember earlier this morning?” John asks gently, nervous himself.
gone away, and he wishes forcefully that it stays that way.
“Well, I don’t know what it is and I’d consider myself to be an average human being.”
dimension version of her would do this makes him feel a bit ill.
The front door opens and he quickly hides the letter.
Holmes studies him seriously for a minute, and Watson is too intrigued to break it. He can almost see his friend’s brain working.
Chapter follows immediately after the last but we had to cut it down due to it's length.
Watson returns to his normal excitement, smiling at Holmes as he says, “If we’re going to return the DVDs that finally changed the dynamic of our relationship, why don’t we send one that will change theirs, too?”
“Good God, you sure don’t beat around the bush, do you? Are you going to try to get me to agree to talk to him about this?” John asked, rubbing at his temples.
John eyes him curiously, as though trying to judge if he’s serious or not, “Disappointed? Of course I’m not
John huffs a breath out through his nose in annoyance, “Alright. Well is there anything I need to do for this experiment?”
“I was under the impression we were watching these to find that answer.”
This is how Sherlock spends the next significant portion of his life. He doesn’t know how long it is and, for once, he really doesn’t care. He’s absolutely entranced by the emotions that pass over John’s face as he dreams, fancying that he could possibly even say what the dream entails simply by watching him. John smiles and quietly chuckles three times, his brow furrows in confusion eight times, and he slowly shuffles closer to Sherlock to the point where Sherlock also has to move to keep their still-entwined hands in a relatively comfortable position.
Watson merely nods in acknowledgement, unwilling to speak.
. The idiot.
Watson clears his throat, futilely fighting the blush that he can feel creeping up his neck, “No,
“You think he’ll turn back to drugs for this?” John asked with yet more guilt.
“No,” Sherlock lied, “it's fine. It's just a lot of idiots I once knew. Why would I be worried?”
“Why that one?” He asks, his eyes falling shut in contentment.
When John walks in to Sherlock’s room, changed and ready for bed, he stops dead in his tracks at the sight he sees.
“Hell, I don’t even care. Anything you’re comfortable with will probably work for me at this point, honestly.”
Holmes observes him. Normally he takes it as an insult to be called such, but by Watson it is clearly a compliment.
Sherlock looks from John to Mary, nodding once before looking back at John standing from the chair and saying, “Right.”
Greg had cleared his throat and attempted to fast-forward the voyeuristic images only for Sherlock to slap his hand away with a deep frown and a rumbled, “What is he doing?”
“John,” Sherlock snapped, forcing John to look at him, “have I ever hinted at doing something I don't want to do? No. I have not. I want to do this. I want to do it with
“Ugh, that hat!” Holmes bemoans.
“Oh for God’s sake, have some self-respect,” he scolds his counterpart.
John keeps threatening to kill him, but Sherlock makes a joke about that being
John closed his eyes and covered them with his unoccupied left hand as he sighed, “Yes, actually,” he admitted, because there has never been any use in lying to a Holmes.
John answers the insistent knocking, apparently fully awake even though he only just fell in to a true sleep.
Holmes sighs before reaching forward and pausing the “episode” on a side-shot of Anderson and a group of others.
“John,” he breathes in revelation as his eyes open.
“On the corner of the coffee table,” John answers while gesturing to the offending corner.
“What are you doing?” John asks quietly, angrily.
Sherlock pulled back enough to turn his head to look at John, and the older man was struck with such a strong wave of fondness that it almost ached in his chest. Sherlock looked vulnerable and skeptical, yet a shine of guarded hope was clear there at the same time.
for me?” Sherlock yells at Lestrade in his office.
Is this what loving someone feels like? He’s never been in love, only theorized it enough to be able to fake it for cases in the past. But, if he had to place a descriptor on his feelings for his best friend, the ache in his chest demands that the word be: besotted.
John crossed his legs, fussing with the fraying edges of his robe as he considered his words, “It was really that bad?”
“Very good,” Sherlock praised, “you’re so good to me. Now stroke yourself for me; show me how. Educate me.”
“I have it on good authority he requested hand relief only,” Mycroft continued in the clinical voice, “he never asked for anything else…and soon became frustrated.”
Holmes just stares at him for a few long seconds before replying, “I don’t know.”
“Oh, come on!” John shouted after him with a bit of a laugh, “It was just a bit of fun!” before he chased after Sherlock, quickly catching up with him in the hallway.
They stay frozen like this for ages: John kneeling, shirtless and denims around his thighs above a Sherlock whose hands are still on his legs, thumbs barely grazing the bottom of the Y-fronts. They’re both worried about what happens from here, suddenly much more sober as they begin to register the cold again.
But he
His heart still gives a guilty lurch whenever his eyes land on the bullet scar that remains their only reminder of Mary. His left hand moves from supporting him to lovingly running over the skin near it. He kisses it as though it still pains Sherlock; as though he could never apologize enough for its existence.
Watson rolls his eyes.
“And you thought
“Don’t get too used to it,” Sherlock smirked, snuggling into John’s arms again, “You’ll become one of those loved-up imbeciles you see on television. I refuse to let that happen.”
Sherlock looks surprised that John is bored. Romance is his area, after all; shouldn’t a wedding be the epitome of entertainment for someone like that? But then, he reminds himself, the last wedding either of them were at was John’s wedding to Mary. Still a bit of a sore subject to this day, nearly two years since everything shook out.
The plans to introduce Sherlock to other pleasures of the flesh were derailed the next morning when Sherlock’s phone began to ring shrilly, startling both men from their post-orgasmic haze. Sherlock reached across and lifted his phone to his ear, giving an inelegant grunt in answer before humming.
The tone of John’s voice sets Sherlock’s analytical mind in to action. He looks back at John’s face in shock and reserved hope. Whatever he sees there leads him to repeat the words, “I love you, John.”
“You honestly scared me that night,” Watson admits quietly, “I had never seen you so unhinged.”
Holmes grabs the case from the other man’s hand, to which Watson rolls his eyes without comment before reaching down to grab the next case. They read in silence for long minutes before speaking again.
As we discuss it, I can already feel the itch in my veins that can only be satisfied by drugs. This changes everything; you’re too honorable a man to walk away from a child.
he got off, just so long as Sherlock was touching him when it happened.
“All I ever wanted was you,” Sherlock whispered, keeping his eyes fixed on John.
“Because…we love each other,” I state even though it feels like more of a question within me, “Don’t we?” I can’t help but add at the end.
Watson glances over at him and shrugs, not even bothering to try to lie after all their years together - Holmes always knows anyway, “Sometimes. I used to a lot more than I do now.”
“Bill! John!” The third calls out jovially, waving his arm enthusiastically and leading the other two wordlessly towards the table.
Magnussen leads Sherlock and John to a closet and opens it. At first they’re confused, but then he reveals that Appledore is the name of his Mind Palace; he has no physical records of anything that’s in his head, just an intricate system to remember everything. Sherlock and John begin to realize that they have just committed high treason and there is no foreseeable way out.
Watson stares in to Holmes’ eyes for a minute, much as John just got through doing on screen, and answers honestly, “A split second it tried, but it wasn’t a viable enough thought to take hold. You have to remember that from the moment we met you were doing these things; you had done nothing different during this case than any other, so to believe you had committed this one would have meant you committed the rest.”
“We might,” he reasons with a playful smile, welcoming Sherlock back into his arms, “with the alcohol in our systems, who knows how cold we truly are?”
he meets, then?”
“Yeah, I got the message quite clearly shortly after starting my shouting,” Watson laughs, speaking the words as John is being dragged bodily in to Mycroft’s office, “But really, if there are certain rules for me to follow wherever the random black car takes me, a note describing that would be helpful.”
They watch in amusement as John refuses to help Mycroft, Sherlock’s own brother joining in on implying that they might be gay, and Anthea blatantly turning down John’s advances in the car. When John enters 221B, Watson speaks again.
He finally clears his throat, gaining the attention of his friend on the sofa, “Will you be sleeping tonight?” he asks as casually as possible. The safest route of asking the real question:
Watson brings his hand to his face, rubbing the slight beard, “Hey, I make it look good,” he says with confidence.
“I know,” John smiled, “it’s probably very intense. It’s not always that way.”
Running his hand along the long, pale-yet-flushed skin of Sherlock’s chest and abdomen, John kissed Sherlock intermittently, changing up each movement so Sherlock wasn’t entirely sure what was happening next. The deduction centre of his mind palace was offline, all sirens blared that this was highly unusual behaviour which caused Sherlock to slam his eyes closed and hum.
“John…I can’t,” Sherlock sighed, “I can’t go back there, not after the -- torment. I don’t want to see those same people who made my life hell.”
John chuckles quietly before placing a kiss to the top of Sherlock’s head and saying, “Goodnight, Sherlock.”
“Obviously. Are they all stereotypical macho males?” he asks with distaste.
Sherlock freezes, he can feel the throbbing in his hugely erect penis, precome dripping out into his silk boxers to stain and mark the fabric. It’s too much, the sensations are too enormous for someone to deal with. He can’t -- he can’t -- Oh god.
“It was for a case,” Sherlock admits, a flash of excitement in his eyes as he remembers the details, “It was a delightful case: a strangling with a staging of the body…I had to find out what the window cleaner knew and I deduced that the man was attracted to me and…”
In a flash, John has taken Zach’s spot with an angry look, “What the hell? Was he flirting with you?” he asks as he glares back towards the table.
When the end credits roll, they both stretch a little.
“You were in jail until you boarded the plane,” John counters, anger building.
By the time two days had passed, Sherlock was itching to open the response that John had sent. He noticed that, this time, the envelope was simply addressed to “Dear Friend” at 221B. Odd, indeed.
Sherlock considers. He’s not done going through the case in his mind, perturbed with himself for having gotten John hurt when all he wanted to do was help him. Yes, it wasn’t really much of an injury but... “Maybe in a bit. Feel free to sleep in your own bed tonight if you’d like.”
Phew! What a ride! If you followed it to the end (or found it once completed and read it straight through) I thank you, and I hope you enjoyed reading it because I had a fun (long) time writing it. I'd love to hear what you thought via kudos, comment, or constructive criticism.
John rubs at his face before striding into Sherlock’s bedroom, picking up the bedding from the king-sized bed and bringing it back to the living room. Upon dumping it at Sherlock’s feet, John does the same with his own bedroom and the airing cupboard, finding every padded or warm item possible to build a makeshift den in the living room. Once returned to Sherlock’s side, John begins organising the fabrics until they have created an almost full-sized fort in the living room which can be climbed inside and closed up around them to conserve heat.
Sherlock groaned, hips bucking forward of their own accord, as he moaned out a “Yes, John.”
Sherlock hesitates, even with the prompting, “Do you love him?” he asks quietly before clarifying, “Sherlock, I mean.”
Holmes, on the other hand, grits his teeth in frustration at Sherlock’s transparency. He’s worked extremely hard to conceal his deep feelings for Watson over the years, and this alternate version of him may just be the one to finally give him away.
“Yes, best to be on the safe side,” Sherlock agrees with mock sincerity.
Sherlock raised his head, licking his lips and then using his other hand to dry his chin of saliva before speaking, “May I taste your scrotum? I don’t want you to kick me in the head through surprise,” he smirked.
“My brain never actually turns off, unlike some people.”
“Now this is a familiar nicotine-deprived tantrum,” Watson muses, “I thought Sherlock had quit smoking in the first episode, though.”
“But I’m
Holmes merely glances over at Watson and can’t help but laugh at his reaction to the scene, feeling a bit smug. Truthfully, he also considers himself married to the work as Sherlock does, but over the years he has found Watson becoming more important than that. If he has to be in love with someone, there’s no one else it could be but him, really, and he’s content in that knowledge.
“Well, I must say that that one was slightly disappointing,” Holmes says, lifting the remote from the table once more and navigating them back to the main menu.
“In their dimension. Maybe not ours,” Watson attempts to console him, but neither man is certain it works.
“But look at all we had been through already; how much you had changed my life in such a short amount of time. This may not be us – what with Sherlock’s disheveled hair and John’s baby face – but this is very close to our beginning, too.”
“I had to steal your birth certificate to learn your middle name!” Holmes gives him an angry look, “If I had known that all it took for you to confess it was to let some woman flirt with me, I would have gladly done so. Would have saved me a lot of time and effort, anyway.”
“And you use them as a drinking game?” Sherlock asks in utter confusion, still not quite certain what just transpired.
“Well, if you’re to be believed,
If I told you
Watson turns, supporting his back against the counter as he looks at his friend. Holmes looks as though Watson is a skittish animal that is ready to bolt. He turns his head to the left to study a stain on the floor: a marker of some experiment gone wrong. With an odd sense of fondness, he thinks about how much he loves that stain – and the countless others just like it – nearly as much as he loves his life here with this man.
“What?” John smiled, completely unselfconscious in the face of his impromptu admission, “Like you never knew,” he challenged lightly.
“Must I?” He asked with disdain.
“John...I…” Sherlock starts before attempting to bolt for the exit of their fort. John is quicker, however, and pulls Sherlock back down, holding him tightly, “Desist!”
“Which means that when Mrs. Hudson called to John’s bedroom for them, Sherlock was…”
?” John hisses through his tightly clenched teeth. Because
John’s smirk grew into a full, besotted grin, “May I, my brilliant detective, suck your cock and then bugger you senseless?”
“Yes,” the detective states, not a question, as if he already knows where this is headed.
Sherlock shudders, his fingers turning into talons as he grabs onto the bedding beneath him, almost ripping the fabric in his grip as his hips tremble and his cock twitches and pulses streams of ejaculate. He has come in his pants like a teenage boy having his first handsy grope.
Both John and Sherlock freeze and the suspect (Larry, of all the silly names) pants in to John’s right ear.
Sherlock then walks over to speak with inn keeper Gary and the screen goes black.
They simply stare at each other, exchanging light kisses for awhile until John yawns. They’re suddenly very aware that it’s still the middle of the night.
Holmes scoffs, “Hardly.”
Next Sherlock drives them to Baskerville, using his brother’s credentials to gain access to the facility. Once inside, John has to pull rank in the military facility to allow them further access which causes Sherlock to adopt an extremely pleased look.
John laughs, clutching his stomach as he struggles to stay upright, “That’s part of my job, you idiot.”
Sherlock considered for a moment before twisting to look at John again, “Are you going to penetrate me?”
“What?” Watson urges.
“Not until you tell me what’s happened; have you changed your mind? Which is fine by the way…” John says, desperately hoping that that isn’t the case.
“It’s an Eddie Izzard reference…nevermind.”
He was already halfway gone by the time he heard the rattle. It sounded like his bedroom window, but he shrugged it off - they had recently had birds nesting in the roof and that must have been the source of the sound. He closed his eyes and wrapped his hand back around his cock, stroking leisurely as he arched his back and moaned deep and low, thinking of various women (and the occasional man) he had slept with.
“What?” Sherlock asks, his eyebrows meeting in the middle as he looks horrified, “John. Not only is she of Royal birth, she is also considerably older than me. And female.”
When John starts to pull away, Sherlock chases him and roughly rejoins their lips, and John hisses at the rough contact with his split lip. They pull apart, remembering simultaneously that John needs to get to the A&E quickly.
“Oh yes, because that’s what I want to do whilst having first time penetrative sex: imagine myself defecating.”
“Thank you,” John replied, enjoying the conversation immensely and feeling the warmth and genuine care which came from the couple as they ribbed Sherlock playfully, telling John of the various mishaps they had had in the labs and the trouble Sherlock often caused when he came over for dinner with the Ellis family.
There's confusion, drama, angst, murder, all finished off with a happy ending somehow. I hope you can make it to that part.
Sherlock and John reach out towards each other for the comfort that neither can provide at the moment.
John does not dare fire at her while Sherlock is still so close, but Mary does not extend him the same courtesy. She doesn’t aim so much as point the gun generally in his direction before firing. The bullet grazes his right calf muscle and he screams at the sting before taking his aim at the prone figure. Before she can fire again with enough awareness to actually hurt him, John shoots her in the head (any other lethal location being too close to Sherlock at the moment for his comfort) and she falls limp.
He places his hands at Sherlock’s mid-back before running them down to grab his hips. He makes a conscious decision to ignore Sherlock’s quiet “
“Do you finally see why this is an issue?”
“Le...Lestrade?” Sherlock blinked roughly, before baulking and glaring at John as though it was his fault, “Lestrade?!”
,” John hisses, tears pricking unbidden at the corner of his eyes, “You’re back here and…”
Sherlock also looks pained as he realizes how deeply this one action - to save John, sure - is still affecting their relationship to this day, even after all this time. His lips purse in frustration with himself for not seeing it before, “That will never happen again,” he says honestly, “I don’t regret doing it because it kept you safe, but I don’t think either of us could handle it a second time. I sort of assumed that, should anything like that happen again - unlikely as it is - that we’d be running together,” he admits.
You moved in quickly, bringing your nightmares with you. You would scream out either wordlessly or the names of those you lost in the war. Your charges, your leaders…your friends. You would wake up sobbing to find me standing in your doorway with a cup of tea and an understanding look in my eyes.
A swift kick to his left lower leg wakes him with a jolt and a hiss. “Shite,” John cusses, because Sherlock is apparently also a kicker in his sleep. By the power behind the action, John reasons that he might have missed his calling as a damn good football player at one point. John turns on to his right side, disgruntled, as he attempts to place as much space between them as possible.
“Makes sense,” John nods in understanding, not wishing to relive their nightmares, much less think about how calming each other’s presence was to the other in those times. John has never experienced such a peaceful night sleep after waking from a nightmare as when Sherlock was behind him, subtly comforting him.
Watson laughs, “Too right you would,” and seems appeased by that reasonable take on the situation.
The left side of Watson’s mouth quirks up, “Not really, genius.”
,” he stresses with a mischievous smile as he finally takes Sherlock’s right hand.
“And as a doctor, I know that human bodies
"There it is," John smiles.
Sherlock shakes his head and fights an affectionate smile, but his eyes glow with it, “You were rubbing your fingers over the freckle you prefer on my hand.”
When you asked me to write your wedding dance, my heart broke a little more. I have written you many a piece throughout the years of our acquaintance (whether you realize it or not), but to write a piece for you to dance with the woman you have chosen over me? Is it not enough to stand next to you as you proclaim to love her always? Is it not enough to stand next to you and give a speech in front of a crowd that endorses this mistake my heart is screaming that you’re making? Now I have to write a fucking piece of music to bestow my blessing as she sweeps you away from me?
“Come with me, Mrs. Landingham,” he says gently as he offers his left arm to her for support, “everything is fine now.”
“Oh please, if I had shown up without pants to the Palace, Mycroft would have killed me,” Holmes says seriously, but his smirk gives him away.
“They replaced the mattress,” Sherlock spoke, looking over the top of the documents he was reading, “after they found him in the middle of doing unspeakable acts with the gardener’s son.”
“It simply took this different perspective for us to realize that our feelings were, in fact, mutual,” Holmes agrees.
“John isn’t even questioning Sherlock, why is that?” Holmes asks curiously, not looking from the telly.
The case had not helped the underlying emotion in Sherlock’s mind. A young boy had been bullied at school, tortured almost with accusations of his sexuality and personal failures which had led him to kill himself. The death itself was standard, but the scene was set up to look like a murder with various clues pointing towards his bullies. Sherlock had worked the case alongside John, shouting and raving deductions at the police as he whirled his way through the scene and interviewed the young men and women who had led an innocent boy to take his own life. At one point, John considered pulling Sherlock away from the interview room as he softly told a young, popular boy and his mother the intricacies of the case, showing him photos of the young victim’s swollen face in death until the young boy vomited and his mother fainted.
Starting tomorrow, you'll only be getting one chapter a day since they increase in size quite significantly. Just a heads up :)
“Because Sherlock doesn’t trust him to be, and I always did. You had proven it from the start.”
Holmes turns and locks eyes with him sadly, “Maybe,” he whispers.
John frowned slightly at the description but huffed out a laugh and continued, moving between each nipple in turn whilst Sherlock stroked himself.
“He changes the subject because John could easily answer that question but doesn’t want to encourage their thinking,” Holmes points out helpfully, “So do I snore, Watson? I’ve always wondered.”
“Well,
been doing that, but he didn’t want Sherlock to know it.
Sherlock looks over at the stack of coats on the nearby table, judging the distance, before turning back to John, “Yes.”
“John, please,” Sherlock begs as John gently prepares him, one finger slowly increasing to three.
The longer they watch, the easier it is for them to disassociate with the characters being portrayed on screen; there are enough differences to accomplish it successfully.
“Yes,” Holmes deadpans, “always has been.”
Then Sherlock begins to deduce him about the events of this morning – his train ride and breakfast – and asking him what had happened last night to bring him to London. While Henry appears to be impressed by Sherlock, as most people are at first, John looks exasperated at the direction that his own life has taken.
“My boy,” he greeted, the alcohol clearly going to his head, “I’m so glad you came tonight. I was worried you wouldn’t want anything to do with this place.”
“If you buy me kitsch teddy bears or hearts, I’m going to murder you in your sleep,” Sherlock warned good-naturedly.
“Hmm,” Sherlock shrugged, obviously not listening, “I was going to sneak in and steal his handcuffs but I think he was having phone sex with my brother.”
“You think I was pretending, but…”
“Notice how the three times I’ve been kidnapped it was
“Good,” John replied, kissing Sherlock’s head again, “I’m excited to show you everything.”
Sherlock had discovered the case earlier in the day and followed the leads. It was a death that was being half-heartedly investigated by NSY due to “slightly suspicious circumstances”. The grandmother was slowly poisoned by her grandson for the inheritance; he had fallen on some hard times and needed the money sooner rather than whenever the old bat decided to die herself.
“That’s too easy!” John grumbles, taking a long drink, “Never have I ever had dinner with a member of the Royal family.”
“Yeah,” Watson agrees, “and no, I don’t understand why, since this never happened to me, as you are well aware.”
"What are you planning on calling the Emergency Services for?" Sherlock scoffs.
Sherlock grabs his phone from where he finally spotted it on the desk and moves to help John down the stairs. Sherlock stops in the entranceway to grab his coat.
“We’re lucky you have an uncanny ability to grab cabs as soon as you raise an arm,” Watson recalls fondly.
Watson’s eyes finally focus on him with confusion, excitement diminished but not entirely gone, “No what?”
At nearly two o’clock in the morning - after one such night of studying, John had seen to his Headboy duties before going to bed - Sherlock finds himself alone in an empty classroom he commandeered two years ago for his experiments. He works on them mostly in the early hours; because he tends not to sleep for days on end, he finds this an appropriate use of his time.
Sherlock hasn’t seen or heard from John since his daughter was born four months previous. He had assumed that John was simply busy settling in to his life as a first-time father and had no time for traipsing around England with him any longer. Sherlock has tried so hard to stay occupied so he doesn’t notice the aching hole that reminds him that John is gone.
“Did you just ask for my hand by proposing to my father?” Sherlock asked, still with a vague look of being offline.
Sherlock exhales sharply, as though punched in the gut. He wants to deny the words, but he knows they’re true. He wants to cry tears of joy at the calming release he feels, but he’d rather go work things out with “his John” as Holmes refers to him.
“Yes I did. You think you’re so good at lying but you’re really not. I was okay with her being dead; why wouldn’t you have told me the truth?”
He tries to get out again, but to no avail; Sherlock still has him locked in. John attempts to call Sherlock's phone but he won’t answer. There are more noises and John makes his way to one of the empty cages for some semblance of safety, covering his own mouth to try to stop any noises that might attract the hound to him.
,” he whispers, sounding utterly broken.
“Sherlock fancies Princess Anne,” John began singing, high pitched and giddy, “Did you love her? Did you snog her?”
John inhales through his nose and nods resolutely. His worry is tinged with a small dose of cautious optimism.
Then, just as sudden, the sadness gives way to anger. He is furious with John for staying in such a situation when he could simply leave and return to him and Baker Street at any time. Why hasn’t he?
“Ah-ha! Sherlock has stopped smoking, why can’t you manage to do it?”
Sherlock couldn’t help the moan that escaped his throat as the pieces locked into place. As he squirmed back in John’s embrace, he felt John’s cock - still as hard and insistent since Sherlock’s orgasm - solid between them.
“Alright already, I get it! The beard is coming off later, you berk!” Watson attempts to sound peeved, but can’t quite hide his amusement.
“Do I make that face?” Holmes asks.
“Rest now, work later,” John says and Sherlock nods slightly before succumbing to sleep. John checks his pulse; slightly elevated, but he’s relatively certain he’s no longer in any danger of going in to cardiac arrest.
to the man he’s threatening? He didn’t even change his name!”
“Then intermittent cigarettes it is,” He smiles triumphantly, to which Watson merely gives a half-hearted glare.
“Inspector Lestrade,” Holmes greeted the man just before he came in to view.
“Good,” John chuckled, carefully moving to take a few tissues from the bedside table to mop up his hand and Sherlock’s belly.
“When has publicly shaming someone ever permanently modified their behavior?”
John hated to admit how much Sherlock's innocent naivety in asking for sex turned him on.
“And when she died?” Watson asks quietly, “Why not then? Why not give me a reason to believe in something worth living for again?”
Sherlock quickly closes the browser window about Sholto when John enters the flat, then begins telling him about IDatedAGhost.com. Sherlock enters a section of his Mind Palace that represents a government chamber for official business, women standing all around. He quickly goes through and narrows the group down to only four. He asks them a series of questions, trying to find a connection, but it’s not readily apparent.
“You think so?” He asks innocently, unsure how the experience truly compares for the more experienced man.
“They prefer to go by Sherlock and John, apparently,” Holmes replies, though it’s not of much consequence, really.
“Yes.”
“I knew it,” Watson proclaims quietly, a mix of vindication and betrayal in his tone. While this woman is clearly not the embodiment of his wife, the fact that
“I’m not!” He practically shouts, then closes his eyes to calm himself down.
A paternity test?
Holmes growls quietly, remembering the exact feeling that someone – some crazed madman – had dared to place Watson in danger because of him. Watson struggles to keep his breath steady. These nightmares had finally,
But it’s not until this moment, when Sherlock has chosen
The next few seconds stretched out in a slow dance of tongues and kisses, the only sound in the room being their breathing and the soft click of their kiss before John slowly began to push inside, inch by inch, as slowly as he could, only stopping when he was halfway inside.
“Yeah, well, one of us has to be, don’t we? And he’s not there to do it himself.”
John meets his gaze again at that, looking bewildered and a bit sad. Sherlock takes a deep breath before continuing honestly.
“Jesus,” Holmes mutters, rubbing his face with both hands in a mixture of second-hand embarrassment and frustration, because Sherlock is, indeed, laughing. If he could slap his other self, he thinks he might gladly do it.
David joins him at the sinks, turning one on and reminding John he still needs to do the same, “He’s a detective; how has he missed that you like guys?”
John nods and then climbs out of their little nest to get the scotch and two tumblers. Sherlock has already contacted the takeaway and promised a large tip if they bring food and flammable materials within the hour.
He has no idea how they came to be in this position.
“Alright?” Holmes asked, uncertain.
“You’ll be the death of me,” John moaned in false complaint, stroking Sherlock’s hair, “tomorrow we start lesson two.”
John notices Sherlock’s intent approach and looks at him in shock before his face falls in to one of annoyance, “Sherlock,” John starts as his friend comes to a stop imposingly over the table, “there is nothing you can say that is going to pull me away from this date.”
John allows his brows to bunch together and takes Sherlock’s hand again. Without being prompted, almost like John
John’s eyes shine with affection as he lifts one side of his mouth in a reassuring smirk, “We’ll have plenty of time to talk this out while I’m being seen to,” he tells him before leaning back in for a gentle, fleeting, affirming kiss.
“It was for science!” Holmes argues, stepping up to the challenge.
Back on screen Greg, Sally, and Anderson are heading out with a warrant to arrest Sherlock, Chief Inspector in tow. Mrs. Hudson comes in to the flat to deliver a parcel from earlier: same envelope and red wax seal, a burnt gingerbread man cookie inside.
“You wouldn’t shoot me,” she says as though it’s preposterous, “What about Amelia?”
Smiling shakily, Sherlock looked up at his friend with a soft blush on his cheeks, “Really? You would do that?”
John tries to act put-upon, but he’s more genuinely entertained by the impromptu history lesson. It also doesn’t hurt that Sherlock is no longer in danger of provoking a big burly man into hitting him.
John wakes around 10 the next morning, surprised to find himself on his left side instead of his back, Sherlock still cradled strongly in his arms. He smiles to know Sherlock didn’t run away in the night and sighs contentedly as he pulls him yet closer. Sherlock makes a quiet, pleased sound at the motion before returning the gesture.
In a weird twist of fate, however, John nearly arrives at a feeling of boredom before Sherlock does this time around.
“John, please,” Mycroft practically whispered, his voice finally breaking into a genuine emotion, “he needs you.”
“No, it
“That is the one,” I confirmed with a nod.
What a mess he’s made of everything.
Sherlock turns his glare on John who meets the angry gaze without fear or hesitation.
In his mind, Sherlock keeps hearing words in John’s voice but the John above him hasn’t moved his mouth at all, has simply frozen staring at him hungrily. When he feels a hand on his left cheek without John moving his arm, he is shocked to realize that maybe - just maybe - the noises and touches are coming from outside of his mind, which would mean…
And that’s just the distraction needed; in fact, if Sherlock doesn’t act now, he’s liable to be shot for the statement. He lunges for her knees, hoping to tackle her and remove the gun from her hand before she can use it, but it doesn’t quite work out that way.
Sherlock falls asleep on the floor as John falls asleep against a support pipe. Tessa calls Sherlock’s name (waking John) before the landlord bodily handles Sherlock in to a kneeling position. John instinctively moves to place himself between Sherlock and the landlord protectively.
to lose her, and the cancer took her quick, but at least I had a warning and time to come to terms with it. But with you…” he trails off, eyes casting down to the floor once more, “you were just
John smirks confidently, “I really hope you don’t plan to keep count,” he goads before closing the space between them once more. After a few minutes, John growls in frustration at the awkward angle of the kiss before he pulls back.
. The younger man whimpers and submits just enough to silently express his acceptance.
This chapter is not a song-fic, but anyone who is familiar with "Fantasies Come True" from the musical Avenue Q will notice some familiar lines. I consider it an homage, and I in no way mean any harm by their inclusion.
Sherlock’s eyes open again, “Why would that scare him off? You don’t think he loves you in return?”
“What were you working on?” John asks, trying to push his frustration down.
?!” Watson yells, gesticulating wildly at the telly.
John smiles brightly as he lifts a corner to allow the other man to join him, then does his best to secure said corner under Sherlock to seal the heat in as efficiently as possible. They are pressed chest to chest tightly, noses almost touching as they stare into each other’s eyes and try to deduce if the moment is gone - if the magical world of No Rules forged by the scotch has been lost.
“I’m not sure. I assume the faculty will be arranging a gift, but if you wanted to take something, then you could?” John answered, giving a half shrug.
but…”
They stare at each other and then the DVDs.
you counting?” Holmes asks honestly.
"I can't feel my face," John counters, words coming out nearly slurred through his numb lips.
“Transcendent,” Sherlock moaned, biting his lip and clenching his toes.
We sincerely hope you enjoyed this work. Any comments, constructive criticisms, or kudos are much appreciated! Thank you!!
Watson pulls back fully to look at his face happily, “Yes?”
Sherlock and John take Greg to talk to the inn keepers about their purchasing of large quantities of meat. Sherlock makes John a cup of coffee seemingly as a peace offering, but really as a means to test his theory about the sugar being tainted. It is clearly a poor cup of coffee by John’s standards, judging by his face, but he pretends to enjoy it nonetheless despite the sugar in it.
I do not think it is any sort of secret that I am beyond elated by my life here with Holmes and the adventures it grants the both of us. But this particular story is not about that, and it will never be published for our readers to partake in.
He appeared to be thinking back to his letters, attempting - as always - to use his incredible mind to solve the issue himself without aid. His face settled into one of understanding and he repeated, “My Dearest,” and took a breath before finishing, “Watson,” confirming in two breaths what I had not dared to hope for.
Holmes’ smile turns into a mischievous smirk, “None yet.”
The scene moves swiftly on to the taxi sitting outside the address, and Watson finally uncovers his face.
Over the course of the day, I briefly sat with some potential clients taking down basic information for Holmes to review upon his return. There were two cases I was sure he would dismiss as uninteresting, but there was at least one promising one among them.
Watson blushes slightly at the praise, “But it was wrong.”
Mrs. Hudson pauses right after another text alert moan is emitted.
“So, John…” Mr. Holmes began, taking a seat in his overstuffed armchair, “We have refreshed the room which used to be Mycroft’s. He doesn’t use it anymore and it’s basically a guest room. We just didn’t want to open the guest wing…it’s an awful lot of effort, you see.”
came back?” She says angrily, motioning closer to Sherlock with the gun on “
John looks himself in the mirror one last time, self-consciously smoothing his jumper down over his less-than-defined stomach before scoffing at himself. It’s not like the other army boys are going to look as they did last they saw each other, either.
Sherlock and Mycroft are talking in the elder’s office as Sherlock’s outrageous beard is shaved off.
“Yes it would. Maybe this year,” he assures her and they smile at each other before she leaves. Watson turns on the other man suddenly with a disapproving look, “You can’t always pretend not to have a heart, you know; she cares for you immensely and you for her in return, I know you do.”
This is also the longest chapter, so...enjoy that!
As previously mentioned, the chases and murders keep us wonderfully entertained, but they are not my favorite part of our relationship. It is the quiet mornings as we sit together drinking our tea and reading the paper. It is the secretive kisses and whispered declarations of devotion in the night.
Watson makes a discontent noise in the back of his throat.
“Agreed,” Sherlock mumbled, left hand moving to play with the hair at the base of John’s skull, his right grasping John’s muscled forearm, still caging him in.
“Only because you started it.”
Sherlock and John look at each other from roof and street as Sherlock claims that it’s all true. John won’t listen, keeps saying that it can’t be.
keep insinuating that they’re gay?” Watson asks, cheeks flushing a bit in second-hand embarrassment.
John had fallen into a kind of trance, lulled into a daze by the warmth of Sherlock’s body and the endorphins of his own orgasm. He blinked and then tilted his head, “Why not?”
you they were the same color,” John teases, fighting his own blush as he looks Sherlock in the eye reassuringly.
“Why?” John smirked, looking up innocently and using his tongue to trace the long vein along Sherlock’s impressive cock. He pulled back, sitting on his feet as he tilted his head, “We’re home alone. Nobody to interrupt.”
Completely shocked by the abrupt change, John removed his hand as though burnt at the same time he paused his hips.
They both laugh at the memory, “Oh god,” Watson wipes tears from his eyes, “he didn’t want to ask
With a relieved sigh, John pulls his hand back to himself and returns to lying on his back, eyes already closing as they anticipate sleep
“Crass,” Sherlock accused before turning back to his microscope, pretending to go back to his experiment.
Or, at least, what
The next two nights, John is permitted to sleep alone in his own bed upstairs. He thinks that he should be more pleased with this fact than he actually is. In fact, it almost sets him with a bit of unease.
John walks in to the same situation as before: Sherlock in the bed on his phone, the camera set up near the foot of the bed. He sighs warily as he lies down. Sherlock turns off the light and settles, everything feeling very similar to the night before.
He says all of these and more with three simple words: “When you’re ready…” that, in the end, roughly translate to “I’m here. I’m waiting. Come home.”
Under some very convincing make-up to make her appear to have a split lip, a black eye, and a knot on her forehead is clearly the face of Anthea. She limps slightly as she makes her way towards John, not meeting his eye as though she’s afraid of him, but also embarrassed about the state of her face. He gets the feeling that she is supposed to be the victim of domestic violence and he greets her warmly by her false name.
shaving for him,” Holmes points out calmly.
Holmes rolls his eyes, “As though ‘gay’ is a warped state of mind to be saved from?” He asks with scorn, “No, no need to be set straight.”
“I guess it’s a sentiment we both share now.”
John is nodding his head slightly to the music as he glances around the crowd lazily, secretly trying to deduce couples (not that he’d ever tell Sherlock that). He’s surprised to find a woman suddenly on his left, introducing herself.
They arrest Moriarty and watch the footage of him breaking in. The screen flashes newspaper articles detailing the event.
“Everyone is staring,” he whispered anxiously.
Both men cringe at the thought.
“And you have done quite well for yourself now, my love,” Mrs. Holmes soothed, “Consulting Detective, on the telly and in the papers.”
“DI Lestrade sent me over,” he answers distractedly, not looking from the screen, “Neither of you has been answering your phones, so I was sent to check on you.”
Sherlock flushes in embarrassment, “I’ll replace it with a proper ring, of course, but this was the only one I had lying about, and anyway, penguins mate for life, you know...”
the same color,” Sherlock insists for the millionth time, “It’s hardly my fault that idiots can’t tell the difference between sapphire and cobalt,” he finishes, gesturing to each garment as he says their color.
They both laugh at Sherlock’s deduction about Donovan and Anderson once they reach the crime scene, but then Holmes gasps.
too sophisticated a color? Too many letters? Do you think they’re even aware that pink and scarlet are not synonymous?”
John stares at him again, reflecting on how much quicker his petulance set in than he had originally calculated, "I'm reading," he tells him, motioning with his Nook.
Sherlock would like to point out how full John’s pants are with his currently mostly-flaccid cock, thus making his argument invalid, but he can’t quite do it. Instead he settles for, “I highly doubt that would be the case, but maybe it
Holmes, however, is equally unsettled and unsure about actually watching the scene play out where one small difference could have meant their lives. They nearly died together - willingly - that night. He takes in a shuddering breath as he continues to watch Sherlock work out the pieces.
something oddly different about this version of Mary, if that’s what you mean.”
that John could still want someone who tried to kill you?”
“Oh yeah, brilliant,” Watson rolls his eyes, “show a child a picture of maggots in some dead person’s eye.”
Both men flinch unconsciously as Moriarty enters the lab in disguise, or lack-thereof.
Sherlock exhales the breath through his nose as he moves back in his chair once more, a pout on his lips. He’s still glaring at Sally when he opens his mouth again, but John squeezes his leg again and says, “Don’t.”
Sherlock shakes his head, “That’s not going to happen.”
In a cab on the way to a lab in St. Bart’s, Sherlock and John discuss how the kidnapper got past the security cameras (sneaking in at the right moment and lying in wait). When they reach St. Bart’s, they rope Molly in to allowing them access to a lab. No matter if it’s John or Molly helping him with something, Sherlock thanks them as John. If he’s talking aloud about anything, it’s to John, even if the shorter man cannot hear him. Slowly, the particles in the shoe prints present themselves, allowing, later, for the location of the children to be narrowed down.
“Fine!” Came one last shouted reply from Sherlock before she returned to the kitchen looking pleased with herself.
“What do I need with more than one friend?” He asks honestly.
“Okay?” John asked, stilling his hand whilst using the other one to caress up and down Sherlock’s thigh.
“What on earth?” John sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose.
Enough time elapses in silence where John is beginning to think he’s given up or finally drifted off to sleep.
John was laying back on his bed, cock in hand and head thrown back in bliss as images of Sherlock’s heart-shaped lips flooded his brain. God, how John wished that he could see Sherlock’s lips stretched across the crown of his cock, the soft gagging when John’s tip touched the back of his throat.
He had gotten the message from Bill Murray a week ago; he was getting married and wanted to meet up for a night out with the old gang, could he make it?
the feeling.”
Sherlock sighed, nodding and clenching his toes in the bedding as John removed his fingers, then pushed them back inside, this time with three.
I thought about it for a moment, but I had already discovered the answer over my endless fretting of the past days, “No.”
“But it has to be true, doesn’t it? I mean, how else could these discs exist?”
“What? Oh stop over reacting! John is a doctor, he's seen it all before. And a soldier. I remember my national service…ahh, those boys never did stop getting naked,” Mr. Holmes sighed, “He's probably seen countless male bottoms, so I don't think John will be traumatised by this.”
position has stopped him dating ever since.”
“Oh and this one,” Mr. Holmes cooed, “Sherlock in the paddling pool.”
John opens his eyes entirely and turns his head to look at Sherlock, so nervous and unsure, and entirely too far away, “Unless you don’t want to, but I’ve been making it nice and warm under these covers. I think you might like it.”
John moaned quietly as his forehead dropped against the other man’s, “God yes,” he agreed against Sherlock’s lips.
“Bloody hell,” he grumbles refusing to say more.
Second vest, a man standing in the street. An abandoned area, abandoned car, and a seemingly distraught wife.
Mrs. Hudson enters the flat on the screen, extremely pleased to have Sherlock back on the premises. She makes a few quips before exiting and leaving the boys to play deductions with a random hat left behind by a client.
“More alcohol?” Sherlock asks with distaste, feeling an intense dislike for his new-found enemy that loosens his tongue too far.
“It would appear,” Holmes finally concedes.
They share another kiss, not even noticing that Moriarty reappears on the screen or the fact that the end credits are rolling.
Kissing Sherlock’s leg once more, John leaned forward and breathed hot air across Sherlock’s tip, moving in to messily kiss the leaking head as his eyes flicked to Sherlock’s face. Sensing Sherlock’s impatience
With a shake of his head, Sherlock moved his bag to the floor before crawling into bed, a restless night’s sleep surely ahead of him.
“Undress,” John reminds him with a slight groan.
Sherlock talks her through his deductions about her past; where Mary Morstan came from, realizing all the signs he overlooked as they came up. He asks her how good a shot she is, she threatens to shoot him again, but throws a coin in the air and shoots that instead. Sherlock appears from behind her, the other end of the tiny hallway from the shadowed figure she had been addressing.
Quick scenes of different guests being photographed. Sherlock is still deducing random men for Janine. John and Mary are discussing how Harry didn’t show up (she didn’t to Watson’s wedding, either) and then Sholto arrives and John goes to chat with him and Sherlock moves to Mary.
Greg shows up, politely asking Sherlock to report to the station with him for questioning. He refuses, explaining that he will not play Moriarty’s game (for once). They leave, Sherlock and John discussing, once more, about caring for the public perception of Sherlock. Sherlock doesn’t care what anyone thinks until he thinks that John is beginning to doubt him himself. That, apparently, is too much.
wanted. To see what he was really missing.
Holmes turns his head, his face falling in the way a scolded puppy’s does. He’s come so far over the years that sometimes it’s difficult for Watson to remember that human interactions aren’t Holmes’ strong suit.
“This isn’t...you can’t just…” he huffed before finally finishing a complete thought, “This isn’t something friends
Sherlock complied almost in a trance, locking his heated gaze with John’s as the other man climbed on top of him without touching him, simply hovering over him. John looked at him like a starving man at a feast, and a fresh wave of desire washed through Sherlock’s body and down to his cock.
John turns his face and kisses Sherlock’s forehead where he can reach it, “I love you so much.”
” as he pushes back towards his straining cock, but his body still feels it. He leans down to Sherlock’s left shoulder blade where three freckles lie in a line, as though tracing the muscle that lies underneath. The other shoulder blade with two lighter freckles spaced further apart with no sense of reason.
Sherlock looked away so he could cover his face with his hands in embarrassment. John had no right looking at him in that way, “I’m sorry,” he apologized into his hands.
It really took an embarrassingly short amount of time for John to come undone under Sherlock’s renewed efforts. He warned Sherlock of his impending release, but the younger man refused to let him go, wanting to experience John pulsing his hot come into his mouth. Sherlock surprised even himself as he hummed contently as he swallowed it down.
,” he agrees, “If you wake up and…” he stops suddenly as Sherlock rolls his hips again, “
“It’s not really
“Yes.”
John finishes for him, raising a hand for a high five that he quickly corrects himself on with a shake of his head.
“What’s the point when I refer to most everyone by their last names?”
Watson nods and glances up at him, trying for a smile but it doesn’t reach his eyes, “She knew how important it was to the both of us, not to mention to the clients.”
“It’s an honour,” John started honestly, summoning his bravery, “you’re so incredibly brilliant and unique, yet you do the most disgusting experiments and never buy the milk. You say that caring isn’t an advantage, but then half-kill a man for laying a finger on Mrs. Hudson. You see worlds where others only see vague shapes, yet you don’t remember that we live in a solar system. You claim to be a high functioning sociopath when really you just don’t want people to notice that you do everything in your power to help them,” John rambled quietly into Sherlock’s shoulder, lips continuously brushing the skin as a caress that he was too afraid to freely give, “You are so much more than just my best friend; there simply aren’t enough words to describe what you are to me.”
“The explosion must have been karma for his unwarranted strop,” Watson tries to lighten the mood, but Holmes merely hums in acknowledgement of the words.
Watson sighs heavily but makes no other response.
Sherlock’s head tilts in innocent confusion, asking a question of his own, “What is the point of pretending to love someone that you don’t? When my potion wears off, the truth is still there: that I love you. It isn’t the potion making the feeling, it’s the potion making me
“Of sentiment? Hardly,” Mycroft sniffs in derision.
stay with me, always, but I’m not the one to tell you that if you don’t already know it. If you have to ask, you’ll never know.
“Well, I have. Would you like me to show you?”
In his room, Sherlock was sitting on the edge of his bed, staring at an old picture in his hands. It’s of his graduation from the hellish school he’s meant to be revisiting, standing next to Professor Ellis. The older teacher standing with his arm around Sherlock’s shoulders, smiling with genuine pride, as Sherlock stands there trying not to look too pleased with himself. It’s the only physical evidence he has of how relieved they both were to get Sherlock through that school without anyone coming to (too much) physical harm.
“It was Mycroft’s idea to send me here, actually, and my own to portray this act in particular. I figured your disgrace of a wife won’t question what’s taking so long if she thinks it’s a delicate situation,” Anthea answers truthfully, without any remorse regarding her words.
Holmes’ mouth turns down resolutely as he shakes his head, “No. As we’ve previously compared, your wife didn’t keep us apart as this Mary seems to have. We still saw each other fairly regularly and that was enough for me,” he lies. It wasn’t ever truly enough. He always missed Watson terribly between cases, but when he would feel the itch for drugs, he’d simply go find his friend again instead.
John’s phone had rung not too long after Sherlock had left Greg’s place.
When you’re ready to be done sneaking around…
a competition between you two?” Watson asks in exasperation.
This is not the sequel I ever imagined writing for A Change of Perspective. You do need to have read that first for this story to make sense. Sorry about that!
Anyway, thank you so, so much for taking the time to read this; I hope you were able to find some enjoyment here. A special thank you to all those who commented along the way letting me know that you were enjoying it; I hope the ending was just as good for you ;)
Sherlock ducks his head down and to the right, trying to keep his next laugh in, but displaying his pleased smile to John.
Next thing they know, Sherlock is ordering two beers, to be served up in graduated cylinders. He hands John his and sits down, starting a timer on his phone. It appears to simply be the two of them, none of John’s other friends.
They both laugh at their ridiculous antics before they’re kissing heatedly once more. John moans as he pushes their hips closer together, unconsciously seeking any form of friction on his straining cock.
“Because he’s pretending and I’m not!” Sherlock half-yelled, but luckily the music and nearby conversations were still loud enough not to draw too much attention. Except for just behind Sherlock where the taller man heard a sharp intake of breath. Sherlock closed his eyes tight against the certain,
Sherlock pauses, unable to look at John, and Holmes gasps, “Oh my God.” He can hear the next words bouncing around in his head:
Holmes merely tsks in distaste.
“Point out Ronald James,” John insisted, his Captain voice firmly in place, “I’d like to have a word.”
Watson reminds himself that he has nothing to be jealous of: this never happened in their timeline because, as has been referenced, they were already solving crimes together again. Seeing John fight Sherlock and holding his ground makes Watson feel like a pushover. But then he glances at Holmes and knows that he wouldn’t have done it any other way; two years was more than enough time apart, he certainly didn’t need to extend it to prove a point.
be crossed...some things that would go too far for John to forget and go back to normal. Because that’s what he feared the most: that Sherlock would want to go back to the way they were before and John wouldn’t be able to forget, to move on.
Sherlock shifts slightly, uneasy, “Well, yes, but…”
Watson laughs outright at that, “No,” he concedes, “no they haven’t.”
“Aren't you tired?” John replied, neither confirming nor denying Sherlock's request.
How Sherlock knew that, John didn’t actually want to know, but he was right; damn him. So John situated himself sitting up, back against the headboard, mirroring the other man.
“Sounds dull,” Sherlock hummed, noticing that John had gone silent and slightly pale, “John? Whatever is the matter?”
Once naked, John proceeded to take himself in hand while still standing next to the bed. He almost took more pleasure from the look of shocked indignation on Sherlock’s face as he did from the touch of his own hand on his cock. Almost.
“Promise me,” Watson begs.
“Please, you save plenty of lives,” Watson scoffs, uncomfortable about the praise.
With a kiss to Sherlock’s hair and a jaw-cracking yawn from them both, they finally rest comfortably in each other’s arms.
I know you think I don’t understand what you went through while I was gone - how I hurt you so deeply over the span of those two years – but I assure you that we suffered the same. Knowing you were alive didn’t actually help me reconcile being away from you for so long, so I couldn’t comprehend how it would have helped you. For that I am sorry to you. For you having moved on, unable to continue grieving over me, I am sorry to myself.
“Yes,” John states with confidence. He’s had plenty of sleep partners in the past who have told him about the sleep talking and laughing, and the nightmares are obvious.
John feels Sherlock tense and he slows his mouth; he’s not sure if Sherlock likes this or not, and the detective is probably too embarrassed to say anything. Pulling off with a wet pop, John wipes his spit-slicked lips and looks down at Sherlock, their massively dilated pupils meeting before Sherlock looks away embarrassed, “You okay?”
They watch as Sherlock keeps hearing John’s voice in his head.
,” Sherlock admitted, his eyes downcast to the floor.
“I think it’s pretty clear what it means.”
“Oh,” John stops speaking, blinking rapidly and then downing his scotch, “So…you’re gay then?”
“Just making sure we were on the same page; contrary to popular belief, you're not
dimension,” he adds as a near afterthought.
“Are you still there?” John asks.
“I don’t know!” Sherlock says defensively.
Magnussen is in his home, watching the taping of the bonfire that John had been trapped in just over a year ago. Sherlock voices the connection that Magnussen had been behind the attack on John while John is entranced by the screen.
Sherlock is in the cab when the mini telly starts to show Moriarty telling a tale about Sir Boast-A-Lot, which ends up being a story about how Moriarty is poisoning the minds of those around Sherlock in to believing that he’s the bad guy instead of good.
is happening? What is this experiment about, Sherlock?”
“You are an absolute menace,” John groaned, pupils dilated already as he pinched and pawed at Sherlock's cheeks, “Are you sure? We can wait if you're not...”
Both Holmes and Watson have similar shocked revelations where they wonder if John is
Sherlock’s face hardened into a glare before he stood from the couch, “If you are unwilling to penetrate me, I’ll just go do it myself and make lots of loud noises so you can’t concentrate on the movie,” he said before turning on his heel and heading to his bedroom with purpose.
And he was harder than he had ever been in his life.
Watson cracks a small smile and admits, “No.”
“But you do...” John answered, lifting an eyebrow, “and you did teach me a few steps.”
“Sherlock!” He hissed, “Get into your room,” John rubbed his face and laughed, “Take your trousers off. Shirt too if you want. I’ll just…get some supplies and join you.”
Sherlock softly places his left hand on John’s cheek, barely caressing, “You’re wrong.”
“Good,” Sherlock huffed, feeling an unfamiliar twist in his stomach at the thought of someone else having access to John’s most private area. The women were bad enough, but the idea that Lestrade was having a look was almost too much to bear, “Promise you won’t do it again?”
videotaping this,” he says, crossing his arms over his chest in a mix of anger and embarrassment.
“Would it alarm you to know that, in my mind, that comma has been there ever since my return after faking my own death?”
John glared down at him, unable to process the teasing, “Do, and I swear to God I will cut off your cock with a rusty spoon,” he warned.
John shuffled closer to Sherlock and used his other hand to stroke Sherlock’s prick, keeping it hard whilst he circled, rotated, and thrust his finger in and out of Sherlock’s body. Once the younger man was relaxed enough, John added a second.
(See the end of the chapter for
Again, Sherlock merely nods shyly, eyes dropping to John’s lips.
“John,” Sherlock gasped, his hips bucking forward in a not-very-subtle message of desperation.
he had a bloody metal pipe down his trousers?”
Watson’s chest swells with pride and affection, but he can’t think of a single thing to say.
I think you called this one,” Holmes states pompously to which Watson merely rolls his eyes. A minute later, however, Holmes continues indignantly, “A Study in
After a few more moments of simply staring, reveling in being reunited, Holmes took himself and his suitcase to his bedroom. I followed out of instinct, possibly unwilling to let him leave my sight again so soon. As I watched him unpack his things, leaning against the doorframe, my mind inevitably went back to the comma, causing my stomach to flutter.
Sally is looking at the evidence, wondering at how convenient it is that Sherlock knew precisely where to find the children.
“John, you must have shown him pictures of us beforehand,” David reasons.
The sound of violin music. Mrs. Hudson brings tea up to Sherlock to discover that he’s not playing the violin (though it is a recording of himself) but instead waltzing to it. She makes his tea and they sit down to discuss John and Mary’s wedding happening later in the day. Sherlock seems unimpressed, insisting that nothing is being altered except titles, but Mrs. Hudson insists that marriage changes people.
Sherlock and John visit Prince’s body in the morgue. Sherlock and Greg attempt to find a connection to no avail. John shows up at Prince’s estate to talk to her brother.
When he rights himself again, he notices that Sherlock hasn't moved. With a heavy sigh, he walks over to the younger man and lifts his computer from his lap unceremoniously.
“Fine,” Sherlock pouted with a grimace of distaste, “but I hate you.”
“Yes?”
“Will you do that thing with the peas again?”
The words stop them both in their tracks as they remember their own timeline clearly. They had met Mary on one of their first cases as they helped her find some old family gold. Turns out there was none to be found, so Watson had asked her out shortly after since he wouldn’t come across as an opportunistic gold digger.
John kisses him again, “Not one moment,” he assures.
“Right,” John says with a firm nod, trying not to think about the feeling of disappointment in his gut as he heads upstairs to sleep.
TW for homophobic language
John smiles reassuringly, “You had a nightmare. You’re alright.”
Sherlock shakes his head to the statement, letting John know he hasn’t.
Sherlock’s eyes dart around as he considers and then nods curtly, “Will you still wear your jumpers?”
“John, please,” Sherlock begged quietly, changing his own tactic, “I feel the build up of pleasure you described, just like a volcano, but I can’t make myself come.
“Are you certain?” Holmes asks, genuinely not wishing to force the emotional strain on him for a second time.
“John, please,” he begs, neither really knowing what for.
John smirked a bit before pushing, “I love when I turn off that brain of yours, but I really do need to hear you say it.”
Sholto opens the door and allows the trio to enter the room and save his life instead.
In fact, in the few instances through the night where they spoke, Sherlock was the one to initiate the conversations. They weren’t long or overly intelligent conversations, but a distinct back and forth in their sleep.
Know that I have never been ashamed of my love for him, merely frustrated at the climate we have lived in. It has been a dangerous time to love the way we do, but truthfully? Danger has always been a staple in every aspect of our lives, so why not this, too?
For the first time in God only knows how long, Sherlock genuinely smiles as all of the weight he’s been carrying is lifted from him. He breathes freely once more.
She pauses just inside the doorway and turns to them again, “It’d be nice, you know,” she starts and only gets quizzical looks in return, “celebrating Christmas together, I mean.”
“No,” John chuckles as he shakes his head, “I think half a bottle is quite enough for tonight, especially in this cold. Just words and actions.”
“Of course I did,” Watson replies equally as quiet, as though the answer was obvious, neither of them looking at each other.
“Okay, but
Holmes is frustrated by his cowardice, but, at the same time he understands it. He doesn’t want their last interaction to be a bitter-sweet parting of what-might-have-been and I’ll-miss-you and please-don’t-go. He wants the last memory each has of the other to be of laughter, and each other’s smiles.
“Do I do that now?” John asks in honest curiosity.
It takes him a second to gather his courage before he whispers, “Because you were just going to leave again.”
?!” Watson yells upon seeing the almost kiss.
“Oh god, Sherlock,” John groaned, back arching. His orgasm rushing at him rapidly as he moved his other hand down to cup at his tight testicles, it was too much and John knew he wouldn’t be able to hold on, “Oh, Sherlock…Sherlock I’m…I’m coming.”
