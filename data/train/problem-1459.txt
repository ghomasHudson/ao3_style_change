"Unless you get someone more intriguing in here, don't call me," John said as he pulled his coat on in preparation for leaving. "You'll just be wasting your time and mine."
“Of course, we can.” A small, relieved smile played across the doctor’s lips, showing his pleasure at being asked.
“Excellent.” The detective opened the file and began reading whilst Mary resumed her work on the laptop.
When the detective tried the doorknob, it refused to turn. He banged on the door with his left hand balled into a fist as he rattled the doorknob. “No. No!” With determination, he threw his full weight against the door. Mocking laughter came from the other side.
Hanging up his coat, John settled in like it was any other day. He’d wait a few hours before implementing his plan. For now, he simply picked up his novel and tried to read.
"I should expect so." Sherlock had leant forward and pulled the box towards him. He started fingering through the files, looking at the labels on the folders. The moment he noticed that his hands were shaking, he pulled back and shoved them in the pockets of his Belstaff. "These should be adequate," he told Greg, making sure his voice didn't crack. He felt like a complete failure, letting Donovan get to him just as he had promised himself he wouldn't do.
John stared into the fireplace, not feeling like talking. He knew if he did, he’d take his anger out on Mycroft and for once he didn’t deserve it. Sherlock’s brother had been nothing but supportive since this whole mess had started.
“He’s hurting and worried. Not a pleasant combination,” Mycroft said. He allowed his fingers to brush Greg's briefly. It was the only physical show of affection he would permit himself in public.
Leaning back against the side, Mary smiled at him. He had the book tucked up under his arm. “I need you to do me a favour and I don’t just mean eating the toast.” She took said toast and put it on a plate, then she spread it with butter and honey and handed the plate to her partner. “John is absolutely driving me mad.”
“I feel different. It’s like a crucial piece of the puzzle has slotted into place.” Sherlock began to pace. “Maybe it’s like lancing a boil. I know the worst, now. I'm not saying that I am okay, but I think I will be.”
Sherlock shifted, but didn't uncurl from his protective position. His gaze was locked on John. The doctor looked tired, more tired than a shift at the clinic could account for, and the lines around his eyes and across his forehead were deeper. The guilt he had been feeling since his brother left trebled in intensity. "I'm sorry, John," he said, his voice rough.
Sherlock’s legs fell wider apart and he tilted his hips up. John slid his fingers further back until they encountered the puckered entrance of Sherlock’s hole. He ran his fingers in small circles around it, pressing inward until both of them were sucked in, then he spread them gently, scissoring them in place and turning them until he felt the muscles relax around them.
“Bloody hell!” Sherlock protested. It felt good. It burned like mad. It was so confusing, and he didn’t know how to process it.
Reclining on the bed, Sherlock relished the feeling of the high as it hit. Finally, finally, nothing hurt anymore. He didn’t feel hopeless or sullied. He felt alive. Why hadn’t he done this before?
Mary nodded to him, and then left. She was determined not to return without the rest if her family. She had worked too hard to allow someone to destroy what they had found with one another.
Sherlock broke out in a broad grin. Mary and John hugged him from either side. Rosie, jealous, made her way over and tugged on his trousers. He reached down and picked her up, setting her on his lap. “You're going to be a big sister.”
Sherlock popped off John's cock and grinned up at him, though the doctor couldn't see him in the darkness. “That’s what you love about me,” he said cheekily.
“Listen, if you don’t go in there with me right now, I’ll be giving you a spanking at home that you won’t be able to face as stoically as the one I gave you last night. Now come on.” He tugged on Sherlock’s arm and the detective reluctantly followed him to the door of Lestrade’s office.
“Impatient git,” John said fondly as he worked in a second finger. He scissored his fingers, stretching them, then he crooked them just so, causing Sherlock to cry out. The Dom just laughed and added a third finger, fucking his boy with them and being certain to hit his prostate on every other thrust.
Sherlock shook his head. "My face is too long, I have strange eyes and my curls are  too much to tame."
“It's a banking issue that has already cost thousands and left alone could start an economic decline. The books simply don’t balance, but the bank is at a loss to explain why,” the blond explained.
"Fine. Fine. But you really should be the one to call." John watched Sherlock crumble under his words and it made him feel ill. "Alright. I shouldn't do it, but I'll schedule an appointment for you."
On the day the detective reluctantly binned the liver in the special biohazard bin John insisted he use (the contents of which were to be returned to Molly), Sherlock stared at the ceiling from the sofa for an entire 15 minutes before announcing, "Bored!"
Before I met you, everything was drab and boring. No one and nothing caught my interest. But you, you are endlessly fascinating. I cannot look away from you, nor do I wish to. I am content to be captured by you.
He found the sub in the living room sat in the grey chair with his knees drawn up to his chest and his arms wrapped around his legs. Sherlock’s eyes had a far away look to them as if he was lost in thought.
“What exactly do you want,’ the doctor said, spreading Sherlock's shirt wide. “You can have anything.’
You are my heart, my joy, my life. I sing you my never ending song of love. I give you my self, unworthy though it is.
When John had finished binding Sherlock’s wrists, he pulled the sub against him, wrapping his arms around him, and kissed his shoulder. He ran his lips in a line from one shoulder to the other, sucking and laving his way across. “Jesus, but you're beautiful.” He stepped away from Sherlock who whined at the loss of contact.
After 30 minutes, John shook his head, disappointed. He leaned in close to Sherlock and gripped the end of the block of soap. “You accused me of breaking our contract, of interfering with the Work. That is something I will never, never do. If anything, I grounded you so you could think better. Now open.”
Sherlock did as he was told, replaying the moment in his mind, grateful he hadn’t deleted something so inconsequential yet. The world is full of idiocy. Don’t add more to it, John. Ah. His words had been... unfortunate. Mindful of the grip John still had on his hair, Sherlock nodded carefully.
The rest of the flat has struck the Dom as a complete disaster area, so he was surprised to find Sherlock’s room neat and orderly. He didn't look around much, though, since his eyes were only for the beautiful sub that had knelt up beside the bed. John locked gazes with Sherlock, his breath hitching, and he was drawn directly to him.
“No, sir, I don’t have a different idea. I want what you have planned.” The detective removed his hand from his cock and placed his hands behind his back. “I’m sorry sir. Really.”
Rosie chose that moment to start splashing, sending dark, chocolaty water everywhere. John laughed and tickled her tummy. "You need clean water." He drained the sink and refilled it.
Much later, Greg had called it a day and had headed home. When he stepped out of the Yard, he spotted the black sedan waiting for him. He smiled and headed towards it, not entirely surprised by its presence. Climbing in, he greeted his Dom, “Hello, sir.”
"I'm fine!" the detective shouted at John, punctuating it with a glare. "Why wouldn't I be? I'm not fragile! You don't have to act as if I'm..."
Now Sherlock was faced with the night and sleep and, unfortunately, the inevitable dreams that would come his way. John had already gone to bed some time ago and Sherlock couldn’t put it off any longer.
John looked around, surprised by the gesture. “Neither did I." He shrugged. “I suppose we needed it. It’s the most relaxed I’ve been in... Well, it just was.” John turned off the hob and plated the stir fry. “I hope you’re hungry.” He said hopefully. Sherlock’s eating habits had improved in recent weeks and he was more willing to eat, which John was thankful for.
"Piss off, Mycroft," Sherlock said, placing bow to violin strings and drawing out something that sounded like a dying cat.
Doctor Dieter nodded. “That’s fine. I just had to make sure.” He leant back in his chair. “I can't help but notice that you're experiencing a great deal of anxiety. Before we talk about anything else, I want to start with the basics, help you get your body back under control.”
Sherlock pulled away from John and started crawling towards the bedroom. If he had been more himself he would have found it equal parts fascinating and infuriating that he had chosen to crawl rather than walk. As it was, he was thinking with his hind brain and acting upon instinct.
Soon, Sherlock was panting. He shouted out John's name and it echoed around the container. The doctor grinned around his mouthful, and then he had to pull off to giggle. “Do that again and someone may find us.”
When Sherlock burst into 221C a few days later, it was to find Mary on a new laptop. Next to it was a new mobile and a thick file. He grinned and threw himself down in a nearby chair. “I see you’ve been in contact with my brother.”
“Alright,” the detective finally agreed. He could put up with anything for two weeks. He wouldn't make any promises beyond that.
John brought the sub to the writhing, crying edge, then he pulled off. Next, he reached for the lube and squeezed a good amount onto his fingers. John caressed Sherlock’s bollocks, then ran his fingers down over his perineum and at last circled his puckered entrance.
Crossing back over to his boy, he tapped his lips. Sherlock obediently opened his mouth and the doctor pushed the ball gag in, buckling it in place. The sub's cock twitched in response, causing John to smile. “Good boy.”
“That’s a bit not good,” the doctor said, “but I feel that way about you. So.” He kissed Sherlock's palm. The adrenaline that had surged through John at hearing his sub was in sub-Shock was fading and he was feeling knackered. “I hope they move us to a room soon.”
John looked up as he jabbed a finger at the laptop. "That one. I want to meet him." He stood again and headed for the door. "Sooner, rather than later, please."
Sherlock looked at his Dom. “I should have seen it before. In all the photos at her flat, the victim was wearing two rings on her right hand. They were antiques. Her grandmother's engagement ring and wedding band.” He picked up a photo that showed the victim's right hand clearly. “Look John. You can still see the indentation from where she wore them constantly. Her cousin thought
Mary, who had been looking on in compassionate silence, nodded. "Listen to John, dear. It's not a hopeless situation. It may not even be an issue." She couldn't stand it a moment longer. Mary stood and crossed to sit in Sherlock's lap. It caught him by surprise as it was the first time she had done it. "Stop worrying." With that, she placed a kiss on his cheek.
For his part, the doctor felt anything but comfortable. His trousers had suddenly become far too restrictive. “Ahem. Right. Yes. Why don't you go get dressed now.” His voice was rough with arousal.
Sherlock headed to the bedroom. Once there, he changed into a suit. He looked in the mirror and was surprised by what he saw: someone competent, someone that was healing. He glanced at his watch, then hurried through the flat. “I’ll be back, John. My appointment with Doctor Dieter is in less than 30 minutes.”
“Sit, and I will explain.” The government official waited until Sherlock and John had both sat, the former in his accustomed chair, the latter on the sofa.
The detective used the short time that it took John to make tea to truly compose himself. He'd said he would see a psychiatrist and he wasn't going to go back on his promise to John. He'd just have to hide his anxiety from his friend, no matter how difficult that proved to be.
Sherlock finally became aware of the smell of panic sweat that pervaded him. It reminded him of the unpleasant odour his fractious memories had carried with them and it made him feel sullied all over again. He felt the need to get the stench and the filth off his skin. Standing, he headed towards the bathroom.
“All in good time.” The Dom shifted down the bed and bent to suck on Sherlock’s bollocks. The moment John pulled one of his boy’s balls into his mouth, the sub moaned wantonly. He shivered, tingles running up and down his spine. John played with his bollocks, sucking on each ball in turn, knowing what it did to Sherlock. Finally, he hovered above him for a moment before swallowing down the sub's cock.
“Google it.” Mary considered for a moment. "Or I can let you have this back." She picked up a book off the coffee table. What to Expect When You're Expecting. “Go ahead and read it. I liked it and I still remember most of it from when I had Rosie.”
John went silent for several more minutes, long enough for Sherlock’s arms to start drooping. He leaned forward and tapped the undersides of Sherlock’s elbows and nodded with satisfaction when Sherlock lifted his arms back into position again.
When the detective finally came, he called out John's name and there was no artifice to it. He wanted his Dom's touch more than anything. His knees went weak and he slid down the door to a sitting position on the floor.
Sherlock sat up, shaking. He wrapped his arms around himself. His dream was still with him in disturbing detail. For several moments, he wondered what it meant. The implications weren’t lost on him, but he refused to face it. Instead, he shoved everything into a closet in his Mind Palace and locked the door.
On the other end of the sofa, the detective ducked his head, hiding his face against his bony knees. "I'm a burden on you. You shouldn't be spending your time worrying about me or trying to... to... fix me."
Mycroft smiled. “You know me so well.” His expression grew grave. “Tell me what you think about John Watson and his relationship with my brother.”
John ran his thumb along Sherlock's knuckles, marvelling that he was being allowed to hold it again. It was difficult not to bring it to his lips and kiss it. In the end, he gave up trying. He placed a light kiss on the back of the detective's hand. “I know you will.” He cleared his throat, then, afraid he'd gone too far, but it appeared he hadn’t. Emotion threatened to overwhelm him. He looked at the case map on the wall and used it as an excuse to change the subject. “So, the case.”
The sub rested his head against John’s shoulder. Though his arms were uncomfortable where they were bound behind him by John’s belt, he couldn't remember ever being so content. When the Dom wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s cock, the sub let out a low moan. It felt transcendent, just that simple touch. The part of him that had resisted taking a Dom for so long was completely quiet.
“No. I’ve made that mistake once already.” John drew cautiously near, stopping beside the bed. “May I sit?” he asked, his voice calm and gentle. “I won’t talk. I just want to be with you.”
"Of course. I heard you in the hall. Your footsteps were too heavy for Mary or Mrs. Hudson and a criminal wouldn't bother to knock." He drew the covers back, inviting John into bed with him.
Sherlock looked at him, blinking. “B. Upstairs.” He thought John was the most handsome man he had ever seen and the doctor was a Dom. He wasn't the typical obnoxious type of Dom either, no, he was interesting. John had actually let him do what was necessary to solve the case.
Even as the eager Dom matchmaker, Mark, smiled at John, the doctor pushed the laptop away from him, sliding it across the desk. He ran his fingers through his blond hair. "You just don't have any subs that I'm interested in. They're all too..." he waved his hand at the laptop screen, "ordinary, soft. I need someone with a bit of backbone who can stand up to an ex army captain, not fall to their knees the first time I raise my voice."
John shrugged. He didn’t see what Sherlock saw, so he sympathised with Lestrade. “Don’t be a git, Sherlock. Walk us through it.”
Sherlock bounded for the door, jerking it open. Halfway through, he paused and looked back at the Dom. After a moment of consideration, he approached him. “You’re a doctor. In fact you’re an Army doctor.”
The doctor gave her a one-armed hug. “I know. I feel exactly the same way. We’ll get him back. I promise.”
The Dom felt his cock getting hard as his desire ramped up a notch. “Like I said, we haven't talked about limits or safe words. Then there's punishments to discuss. But if you want a bit of light play, we can talk about the more serious stuff tomorrow.”
The detective climbed onto the bed ignoring the mess and curled around his Dom. “I’m sorry. I'll never be naughty again.”
Leaving John's room, he was assailed by the scattered memories. They seemed to have congregated outside the door and he had to wade through their slimy stench. At the same time, the fluttering, dark shadows bombarded him from every side. He felt himself panicking as he emerged from his Mind Palace into the real world. His breathing was wild and erratic.
“Please, sir. I can’t take this. Please, please, please, sir,” Sherlock begged, his head tossing from side to side.
“I would have enjoyed it too. Now I have to take care of myself.” The doctor rolled his bollocks around in his hand as he pumped his cock. He let his head fall back and his eyes grew half lidded in pleasure. “God, I wish my hand was your plush arse. It’s so tight and hot. I never get tired of fucking your arse. Jesus.” He increased the speed of his fist on his cock, pumping it furiously.
Quietly, John said, “I want those things too, but it can't be rushed. You know, I'll wait as long as it takes to be with you.”
“Does John know about this?” Mycroft asked. The last thing he wanted was to cross the ex-army doctor. He knew if he did, he’d never see his niece again. Besides, he didn’t want to disrupt the happiness his brother had finally found.
Sherlock frowned until finally he nodded slowly. "Alright, but how do we do this? I mean I understand the mechanics, but I'm gay."
John grasped Sherlock’s cock and pumped it a few times so that it filled out nicely and, when he released it, it stood out slightly from Sherlock’s belly, red and needy already. Opening a tube of lube, John squeezed some out onto his hand and worked it over and between his fingers, then he reached down and stroked between Sherlock’s legs, over his perineum.
The Dom started reading what Sherlock had put down. Most of it was fairly standard. He’d marked his hard and soft limits and marked some punishments as unacceptable. John doubted those punishments would have worked on Sherlock anyway. There were several scribbled notes, most of which surrounded casework. His words protected his right to take cases as and when he chose and above all other considerations.
“See, Sherlock. Let yourself enjoy that victory. And look back. Have there been others?” Doctor Dieter asked. When Sherlock didn’t speak, John cleared his throat. “John?”
“No, it certainly wasn't.” John urged the detective to sit up. “It's my turn.” He felt for Sherlock's flies, unfastening them in the dark. He bent to his task with as much enthusiasm as the detective had put into it
Inner John emptied the SIG into the door and kept firing, the bullets passing through it without showing signs of damage. A howling came from behind the door that was followed by silence. The silence stretched out for several long seconds. Finally Sherlock sagged and would have collapsed had inner John not caught him. Inner John lifted Sherlock into his arms and carried him to the sofa where he sat and held Sherlock until he had relaxed and drifted off to sleep. When Sherlock woke, he woke in the real world.
John laughed. “That will do quite nicely. Now sit!” There was no mistaking his last words for anything other than a command.
Every toy the detective had given Rosie fell into that category. He had given her everything from a press and talk mobile phone to a musical entertainment table that had eight different noise makers built into it.
John couldn’t help himself – he giggled. The detective grinned in response. Life was exceedingly good at the moment. Of course, that’s when fate chose to take a turn.
The detective heaved a deep sigh. “No. You're not.” Having it out there felt like an enormous relief.
The weather suited his mood, the rain coming down in sheets. He didn’t care that he was getting drenched to the bone.
John ran his finger over Sherlock’s lips. “It's such a shame, really. You have such a beautiful mouth. It shouldn’t be used to insult people, especially your Dom.” Sherlock started to say something, but John shushed him. “No. I don’t want to hear a word.” John reached over and picked up the object that had been laying on the table and held it in Sherlock’s mouth. “Bite down on it and don’t let go until I tell you to.”
Sherlock was enthralled with Mary’s progress. He took measurements of all sorts. Her waist size, ankle size, blood pressure, glucose levels, anything he could think of.
If you should fall into one of your dark moods, please, please, please contact me. Failing that, go to Mycroft. He’s a git, but he means well.
“It’s good to meet you. Why don't you both take a seat?” The psychiatrist sat and waited for them to get comfortable. “I have a good idea what has brought you here today based on what you, John, said when you made the appointment. For that reason, I have to ask. Sherlock, would you like John to leave the room?”
The Dom tipped over the edge into orgasm at the cry of his name, shuddering through it. When he was done, he kissed Sherlock’s face all over: forehead, eyelids, nose, cheeks, lips. Then he collapsed in bed next to him, completely sated.
John smiled at him warmly. “You don’t have to call me that unless we’re in a scene or you’re being punished.”
“Right.” John went and got the tea. At least he wasn’t being kicked out. He took a sip and hummed appreciatively. It really was perfect. Turning around, he gave a start to find Sherlock stood not two feet away. “Jesus!”
John tried to follow him just once, but Sherlock rebuffed him so the doctor went back to bed. Each night after that he stayed in bed and stared at the ceiling, unable to get back to sleep.
They didn’t have to knock. The DI looked up and spotted them, his eyes going wide at the sight of the collar around Sherlock’s neck. He hopped down off his desk and opened the door. “Come in Sherlock and... it was Doctor Watson, wasn’t it?”
"Would you stop that," John chided. "There, I think that's all the glass." He disinfected the wounds, then, after consideration, decided the detective didn't need any stitches. "You're incredibly luckly. All I need to do is bandage you up." He did so efficiently, finishing up by patting Sherlock's bandaged hand. "Sherlock..." He couldn't bring himself to ask it, but he thought perhaps they shouldn't go to the Yard.
The sub tested his bonds, and, satisfied they would hold, settled into them, ready to be used. What he didn’t expect was for his bollocks and cock to be covered in a layer of Tiger Balm. “John!”
“My sentiments exactly.” After a short pause, the government official continued, “I will arrive shortly. We can discuss the path forward when I arrive.”
After filling and turning the kettle on, Mary made a grab for the book and snatched it out of his hands. “Bollocks. You’re just excited like John and me.” She flipped through a few pages, then handed the book back to him. “Speaking of our husband, he’ll be furious if you don’t eat something.” She put two slices of bread into the toaster.
Sherlock took a few moments to breathe and calm himself. When his knee finally stopped bouncing, he felt ready to begin. He turned his head slightly towards John, but not enough to face him. “There are things that John needs to know. Things...” He took a deep breath. “John doesn’t know how much he matters. He needs to know that.” With those words, his knee started bouncing again.
“Oi! Naughty!” The doctor sat up and gave his boy a slap on the thigh. That didn't slow down Sherlock who made a dash for the bathroom. John laughed. He felt so good, he wasn't in the mood to punish his boy. He had something else in mind for the morning. “Don’t get dressed or there will be consequences!” he called out.
With his newly-found purpose, Sherlock made his way down the long hall, ignoring the distractions around him. He followed the repeated call of ‘William,’ taking turn after turn until he arrived outside a door. It was innocent-looking, but he knew that what lay beyond was anything but.
Mary let out a long sigh. “I love being a mother, but I do get bored. I don’t want to go back to what I was. I just want to be useful, maybe make up for some things...” She shrugged, not wanting to follow that sentence to where it could lead. “Use my brain a bit.”
"Of course, Mary and I are hoping you'll be more directly involved with the next baby." John used a little baby shampoo to wash his little girl's hair.
The three of them, Sherlock, John, and Mary, all headed into the bedroom. Rosie had already been tucked into bed. Together, the men gently undressed Mary. John kissed along her shoulder, then up her neck as the detective stripped. Once Sherlock was completely nude, he wrapped his arms around Mary from the back. The doctor took that as a cue to get undressed. Together, John and Sherlock led the former assassin to the bed where they all piled on it together. Mary tried to move to let the men lay next to each other, but they wouldn’t have it.
“Mycroft, sir, please,” Greg said softly, taking his Dom’s hand. He hated it when Mycroft got like this.
Just when he was about to go to bed, he heard Sherlock on the stairs. He stopped where he stood and turned towards the door. The sight that met him took his breath away.
Standing, the detective moved this way and that, bending at the waist and standing straight again. “It feel fine, sir. Comfortable.”
Mycroft allowed himself a thin smile. “Then allow me to offer my services. Whatever you require will be provided.”
John turned, pulling his knee up onto the sofa so he could face the detective. "First of all, you're not a burden, you're my best friend." And if they made it through this maybe something more. "Secondly, I can no more stop worrying about you than you could stop worrying about me if our roles were reversed. And finally, I'm not trying to 'fix' you. I just want to help you." It was frustrating to be having this conversation. How could Sherlock think himself a burden?
They started across the bullpen to Lestrade’s office, but as they got closer, Sherlock stopped. The DI could clearly be seen sitting on the edge of his desk talking to a man in a three piece suit with ginger hair. The detective did an about turn and headed back towards the lifts. John's strong hand on his upper are was all that stopped his retreat.
John placed a kiss on the back of Sherlock's neck, then kissed his way down his spine, enjoying every lovely inch as he went. Next, he lifted his boy's wrists, one at a time, and placed padded cuffs on them.
John waited until Sherlock’s cock had lost it’s purple colour, then started again. He kept it up until his boy was a writhing, panting mess, then he stopped again.
Waiting until the boys were out on a case together had been excruciating, but she hadn't wanted to raise their hopes so long as there was a chance they might be dashed. Setting the timer, she sat on the lid of the loo and waited. It was only a couple of minutes, but it seemed like an eternity. Finally, the timer sounded. Holding her breath, she picked up the bit of plastic that would foretell all their futures. He hand flew to her mouth and she let out a happy sob. She was pregnant.
Sensing he was in trouble, the sub bowed his head. “All the time, sir, but I eventually give them back.”
At her words, the detective perked up, clearly interested. “What has Mycroft found to interest you.”
Doing as the doctor instructed, he located a set of lock picks in his mind palace. He approached the door, his hand shaking. I can’t,” Sherlock said.
After falling back asleep, Sherlock woke in bed with John sprawled atop him. He felt pleasantly achy from their earlier activities. Though he enjoyed his current position, he knew he'd grow bored and hoped his Dom would wake soon. After some time had passed, the detective became impatient. He started squirming at random intervals in an attempt to wake John up.
After an appropriate amount of time had passed during which John tidied up from breakfast, he joined Sherlock in the bedroom. His boy was knelt in the centre of the bed, his hands behind his head. His dressing gown was still draped around him artfully.
“Stop,” the former assassin ordered. “You know all about me so you know I won’t hesitate to kill you.”
He settled in to wait. It seemed to take forever and, against his will, his body succumbed to sleep after the last of his high wore off. It was dark and quiet when the dream overtook him.
When I say you're gorgeous, I speak not of your transport, my love, the fact of which I have yet to convince you. No, dearest, I speak of other things: your mind, your heart.
John’s eyebrows shot up. He had been warned to expect the unexpected, but he hadn't expected what appeared to be an outright challenge. “Sorry?”
For almost an hour, the flat was filled with music. It was quiet and subdued music; peaceful, but not melancholy. It soothed something inside John that had been aching for weeks and he relaxed enough to drift of to sleep.
Downstairs, Sherlock had picked up his tea and was holding it. He let his eyes fall shut and tried to convince himself he had made the right decision. John seemed pleased enough, but he was still uncertain. The detective's eyes flew open. What had he got himself into? He'd have to talk to whomever John had chosen. His hands started shaking so badly at the idea that he had to set his tea down on the coffee table to keep from spilling it.
"I hope so," Sherlock whispered back. He shouldn't be feeling this way, slightly let down. He reminded himself again that he'd still have John and John was almost, almost everything to him. Their little family meant everything else, of course. A single, absurd, pointless little tear slid from the corner of his eye.
Sherlock had started mouthing at John's flies. “No.” He went back to work, trying to unfasten them with just his mouth.
Teasingly, he unbuttoned the cuffs of his shirt, then he started on the button that sat just below his suprasternal notch. His long fingers seemed to make love to each button as he worked lower and lower, pulling the tails of his shirt out of his trousers and letting it slide off his shoulders, down his arms. With a half smirk, he folded the shirt and set it on the chair in the corner.
Sherlock didn't want to wait and see what John would say next. He started climbing out from between the two of them, but they were having none of it. John and Mary piled on top of him.
As the paramedic continued to monitor Sherlock's vitals, he asked, “Can you contact his Dom. He'll need to meet us at A&E.”
Violin perched beneath your chin. Bow drawing forth music to make the spirit soar. Swaying. Silhouette against the window. An arrow to my heart.
Wonderful. Now the detective was thinking about having sex with Mary. Sex. S. E. X. With a woman. He tried to imagine it and his very vivid imagination conjured her naked form before him. His erection didn't wilt, but he felt his heart flutter with nerves.
Sherlock held out his hand. “There’s your brother. Your phone.” He accepted it from John. “It’s expensive, e-mail enabled, MP3 player, but you're an economical man, you wouldn’t waste money on this. It’s a gift, then.
“You know us too well, Lestrade.” Sherlock stepped away from John and tried to look professional, but his kiss swollen lips and the two spots of colour staining his cheeks ruined the effect.
Sherlock enjoyed experimenting with the liver Molly had given him for a couple of days. John couldn't help thinking of it more as playing, but he didn't mind since his friend seemed almost happy.
The detective practically fell into his chair, the contract and pen on the table beside it. He licked his lips, enjoying the way John’s words made him feel. He was still amazed that he reacted in such a manner.
John lifted him gently in his arms and stood up. He turned around and placed him face down on the bed with his head turned to the side. “Don't move. I’ll be back.”
That evening, when John announced that he was going to bed, Sherlock stopped him by calling out his name, “John?”
"Right. Of course we are." John didn't argue, but he felt a strong sense of foreboding. He just hoped he was wrong.
The Dom led Sherlock into the flat and locked that door as well, then guided him to the bedroom. He was amused at how pliable his boy was from just having his scalp stroked and his hair tugged. It just went to show how starved Sherlock was for the attentions of a Dom.
John and Mary looked at each other and burst out laughing at their ridiculous husband who only raised a single eyebrow in response.
As the doctor stood, Mark called out, "Wait!" He exchanged glances with another matchmaker who shook her head. "Why not?" he mouthed at her silently. After all, what could it hurt? "There's one sub I didn't pull up from the listings."
“I was thinking,” Sherlock told him, “somewhere safe.” He took a step towards John. “It was all a muddle in my head. I had to figure out what it all means, not just to me, but to us.”
The theory was sound, Sherlock knew that, so he tried it. He could feel the difference all over his body. It didn't last long, though, before he tensed back up. The psychiatrist noticed.
John squeezed his eyes shut as he thought rapidly. “You don't have to right now, not if you don’t want to.” He hoped he was saying the right thing.
When they arrived at the Yard, Sherlock climbed out of the cab, leaving John to pay the cabbie. Together they entered the building and headed to Lestrade's floor. As they crossed the bullpen, Donovan stepped in their way, cutting them off. She looked the detective up and down, noting his limp and marked pallor. "What happened to you, freak? We haven't seen you for a while. I remember our last drugs bust. You got the crap beat out of you." She smiled cruelly. "You finally got what you had coming."
“John,” Sherlock called out, only to be met with silence. He rolled onto his left hand and knees, then started exploring the area around him. Soon, his hand met the doctor's body. He sat up and felt for a pulse with his left hand. Finding it, he breathed a bit easier.
Fun and exciting news which is useful to no one: I'm moving back to school tomorrow! Send me good moving thoughts!
“Hi,” he said, and if his voice was a little breathless, Sherlock was kind enough not to mention it. He handed Sherlock his coffee, made just a few minutes before by John, who didn’t
He sent the text with a smile, thinking about how Sherlock would grit his teeth and grimace at the bad grammar and spelling. John wasn’t even usually that bad, he honestly just did it because he knew it made Sherlock angry.
“Has this man entered that house today?” he asked. She looked at the screen, then up at him, then at the screen again.
“What happened?” he asked, pouring a few drops of rubbing alcohol onto a cotton swab. Sherlock tried to shrug, and then winced.
John flicked his eyes over to the corner where Sherlock was curled up in his armchair. He seemed normal. But the way he had been acting made it almost seem like he was…hitting on John. He shook the though from him his head, almost wanting to laugh. If there was one thing he knew for certain, it was that Sherlock was not hitting on him.
“Fuck,” John exclaimed, looking down at Sherlock, who had stopped with John’s cock in his throat, and looked up at John. He cursed again, the sight of Sherlock looking up at him with his beautiful eyes, his gorgeous lips stretched around his prick, almost too much. Sherlock had never sucked his cock before, and for the life of him, John couldn’t figure out why, as Sherlock expertly worked him with his mouth, tonguing at all the sensitive parts, pulling back just enough to run his tongue over his slit lightly.
“Why not?” Sherlock let his lips brush against John’s ear and heard a sharp intake of breath. “I told you not to worry about my age. We both want this, John.”
He continued bobbing his head, getting lower on his cock with every time, until he was as far as he could go. He sucked for a few moments before Sherlock pulled him off with a strangled groan.
“Yes, John, right there, again,” he exclaimed, and John quickly avoided it, simply because Sherlock had told him what to do. “Bastard.”
“Can’t,” Sherlock said shaking his head. “They know my voice now because I’ve called so many times. They don’t take my tips anymore.”
“Okay, yeah, okay,” John said, releasing a breath. He checked his watch and swore, standing from his chair. “I have to finish closing up…will you stay?” He looked at Sherlock with undisguised hope.
“Yes,” was his answer, his gaze not leaving John’s. Refusing to lose, John didn’t let himself look away from the man’s light blue eyes, so similar to Sherlock’s, yet so very different as well.
Sherlock groaned in frustration. He had tried everything to get rid of the sight of John in his military fatigues. Not even continuing his experiment kept his mind occupied enough to forget the feeling of being on his knees with the heavy weight of John’s cock filling his mouth.
“Sherlock,” he growled into the taller boy’s neck, “you have no idea how long I’ve been wanting to do this.” Sherlock gave a shuddery moan at the words, his legs falling open to allow John to settle between them. John kissed his way down Sherlock’s neck, leaving marks across his pale skin. He had to force himself away from the smooth expanse of skin—he could have spent hours on Sherlock’s neck alone, but his cock was throbbing impatiently in his jeans.
"Ssh, you're a good boy," said John comfortingly, stroking the crop down is back and tickling his balls. Sherlock threw his head back and shut his eyes, his thick cock leaking precome onto the floor of his room.
“No, he’s actually studying chemistry,” John interrupted before Sherlock could insult the poor constable. Sherlock glared at him, and John returned it with a firm one of his own.
“God, you’re perfect, love,” he said, the pet name slipping from his lips without him even realizing it. Sherlock, however, stilled for just a second before catching John’s lips with his own. He ran his hands along John’s chest, thinking that if this was what sex felt like, he had no idea what he had been doing all these years. It was so much more than just having John’s cock inside him, it felt like he was truly connecting with him. Though he knew that he would scoff at his own sentimentality once he came down from being high on endorphins, for now, all he could do was moan John’s name a prayer.
“I suppose there isn’t much of a chance that I’m being driven to class, is there?” he asked, more to himself than to her. He looked at his watch and sighed. There wasn’t much of a point of going anymore. He would just have to hope that he could get the notes from someone.
When their lips finally met, it was like worlds colliding, huge and explosive, but then they shifted and the sigh that John felt across his lips was a warm breeze through a sun-filled clearing, soft and so, so, sweet. He swiped his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth and felt sparks dance between their mouths, and swore that it was the best thing he had ever felt. It was as though it was they had never touched before—their first time was hot and wonderful, but it was rushed and hard, where this was soft and warm and perfect.
It was all Bill’s fault, it really was. John had been planning on a quiet night in with some leftover Chinese and a few Bond films, but Bill had been adamant.
Yet, John knew he wouldn’t refuse. After last night, seeing and feeling how excellent sex with Sherlock Holmes really was, if Sherlock came to him again and asked to have sex again, John knew he wouldn’t refuse. He knew he
“I’m sure I shall find some way to cope,” Sherlock replied, trying to sound as though it will be a great ordeal for him, but he couldn’t quite manage to keep his face straight. John rolled his eyes playfully. “So then, since we’re exclusive, what should I call you? I mean are we…” Sherlock trailed off looking uncertain. John smiled.
“You want it harder, do you?” John asked. “Aren’t you a needy little cockslut?” Sherlock shuddered around John’s cock, his fingers tightening in the sheets.
John shook his head, slightly disgusted with himself. He was three years older than him, for Christ’s sake. He often forgot that when they were talking, because Sherlock acted so much older than his age, but still, he wasn’t even old enough to drink yet. John tried to keep his thoughts directed solely on coffee, feeling like a pervy old man.
John walked to the Tesco, even though it was raining, deciding he was going to need every last pound he had to buy a new table. When he got to the Tesco he was greeted by the sight of none other than Sherlock Holmes himself pacing in front of the automatic doors, causing them to open and close spastically. He appeared not to notice.
When it was finally over—it could have been seconds or days, Sherlock honestly couldn’t say—he was curled on the concrete in front of his school, bruised and bleeding and crying, thought trying to hide it. His phone got dropped a few steps away from him, a couple of the boys being sure to stomp on it as they walked away, breaking the screen and possibly the whole phone.
“Do whatever you need to,” John said, smiling. Sherlock descended on his chest, nipping and licking and kissing the skin in a very organized and methodical manner. John narrowed his eyes suspiciously. “Are you…categorizing what I taste like?” he asked, amused. Sherlock lifted his head, looking slightly guilty.
Sherlock’s breath hitched in what was half a chuckle half a moan. He kissed his way down John’s jaw, nipping at the skin with his teeth every once in a while.
Sherlock gasped John’s name when he found his prostate, so John continued to brush against it, not quite enough to make him come, but enough to feel good. He leaned in so their foreheads were touching and Sherlock’s face was almost just a blur.
Sherlock didn’t exactly want to see John like this, but he wanted to see his parents like this even less. Besides, John was studying to be a doctor, he might even have painkillers.
John thrust hard into him until he felt his stomach tightening and his climax approaching. He reached in between them and took Sherlock’s thick, hot cock in his hand and stroked him three times before, with an explosive shout, Sherlock came all over both of them. The sight of Sherlock, head thrown back in ecstasy and feeling of him clenching around John’s cock was enough to push him over the edge, right after Sherlock. He spilled himself deep into Sherlock with a groan, before collapsing on the bed right next to where Sherlock lay, both of them panting.
He considered sitting in his normal armchair, but the very idea bored him. He had been hoping that John would be able to distract him from the engulfing, mind-eating boredom. It was the sort of boredom that had led to the drugs, and ordinarily, Sherlock would not have fought so hard to stay clean, but his friendship with John was new and exciting and he wanted to keep it for as long as possible. Sherlock worried that John’s disapproval of drugs would make him leave if he knew Sherlock was using again.
“Don’t you dare come, you’re coming with your cock inside me, John Watson,” Sherlock said, repeating John’s own words back to him. John couldn’t help a huffed chuckle.
Hi friends! I know it's not Sunday, but it's Monday, which is really super close to Sunday, so I feel like I should get points for that.
“What, now you and Mike are talking about me behind my back?” he asked, teasing. Sarah giggled. From the corner of his eye, John saw Sherlock getting up and making his way over to him.
“Okay, so why were you waiting for me in front of a Tesco? How did you know I would be here anyway?”
From there, it was child’s play to prove that Frank Hudson had been at the scene of crime. When Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson strode into the crime scene the next morning, they were met with the slightly bashful expression on the man they spoke to the day before. The gun at the crime scene was, in fact, not the same gun that made the wounds. With only minimal gloating and smugness, Sherlock explained the whole case to those who were professionally trained to solve them.
“No, John! Please, I was such a good boy for you, please,” Sherlock said, struggling to stand up on shaky legs and all but crawling to where John stood. He kneeled next to the shorter man and pressed his face into John’s thigh, smelling him.
“Piss off.” John chuckled lightly, and a moment later, Sherlock joined in. John listened him, loving the sound.
“John, please, it was nothing,” Sherlock said, closing his eyes so he didn’t have to stare into that dark blue gaze anymore. Their faces were mere centimeters apart, and Sherlock, despite everything, found himself dying to lean in and close the distance.
“Very good, thanks. And you?” he responded in kind, and watched as Mike’s face, so much more expressive than that of the man currently sleeping his room, shifted in amusement.
“I had this…friend, I guess,” he began with a shrug. “Then I started to feel things for him that were…more than friendly. And that doesn’t often happen to me, as I’m sure you can imagine.” Mrs. Hudson smiled softly at him.
“Closest one to your flat and I ate all your biscuits,” he said, grabbing one of John’s hands and pulling. “Now come on, I need you to buy me alcohol.”
“Well I would have prepared myself before you came home, but I was told I wasn’t allowed to touch,” said Sherlock. John slapped the inside of his thigh sharply.
“We can still be friends,” lied Sherlock. If he was honest, he was bit surprised John had even called them friends. He knew, however, that after what was about to happen, happened, John would no longer want to be friends with him. Sherlock didn’t blame John—it wasn’t his fault. It was the curiosity.
“Yes, I’d heard,” Mycroft said drily, fixing Sherlock with a stare that said he knew all about the alcohol Sherlock had “hidden” and he knew just who had bought it. Sherlock held his gaze with an innocent expression.
“Now look across the street.” When John raised his eyes to it, he saw another camera pointed at him. As soon as he caught sight of it, however, it turned away.
“Yes, please,” he all but whined. The hand in his hair tightened and he thought he was going to come right there on the spot—there was no way John could have known his follicles were so sensitive.
By the time Sherlock worked his way down John’s chest both were panting and aching. He slid off John’s trousers and pants, greedily devouring John with his eyes. John couldn’t help squirming under Sherlock’s intense gaze, but his erection never faltered.
“Yes, I am high, but don’t worry I’m done with it. Today was a…relapse. It won’t be happening again,” he said, not meeting John’s eye.
“Hang on, you want me buy you alcohol just to annoy your brother? Sherlock, how much do you think I make at that damn coffee shop? I still have to buy a new table because you burned the other one!” Sherlock stuffed his hands into his coat pocket and pulled out a crumpled wad of bills.
“Oh, yes, I had a great night, thanks for asking. Though probably not as good as yours…” he trailed off with a seemingly innocent expression, and John fought to keep a smile off his face. He should have known Mike wasn’t going to make this easy for him.
“How do propose we catch him? My husband isn’t the type to confess, and he certainly wouldn’t do it to me,” she asked when the left the house. Sherlock looked up and down the street, checking if there were any cameras that could have caught someone coming up to the house. He saw nothing and was mildly disappointed, but not surprised. He did, however, notice a homeless woman across the street, sitting under a tree. He ran across the street without checking to see if any cars were coming and left Mrs. Hudson swearing in his wake. He didn’t pay her any attention; he was focused on the homeless woman.
“If you do continue being…friends, with Sherlock Holmes I would be happy to pay you a significant sum of money on a regular basis to ease your way.”
"I'm close. I'm about to come," he said. "On the bed, now." Sherlock did as he was ordered, scrambling onto the bed as fast as he could. John could see a wet spot on the carpet where Sherlock had leaked precome. "You've, been such a good boy," said John, "you deserve to be rewarded. What do you want, Sherlock?"
So I'm not super happy with this, and it's kinda short, but it's Sunday, so here you go! I may go back and edit this throughout the week if I have time. We'll see.
“How’s the view?” he asked, pulling a few bills from his pocket. Luckily, he and Mrs. Hudson had stopped at to exchange their money at the airport. The woman looked up at him suspiciously.
The relief was momentary, however, and within seconds, he was back in his hell. His cock was aching and he could feel it throbbing in time with his heartbeat.
Yet by this point, Sherlock knew there was no point in arguing with John when his voice got like that, so he merely rolled his eyes at him.
“No,” he lied in a clipped voice; he didn’t want her to know just how pathetic and sad he really was. “Black, two sugars.” She made his coffee after giving him a glance that said that she didn’t really believe him. Sherlock drank it without enthusiasm. Sarah’s coffee was watery and weak, by far worse than the coffee made by John.
“No, I imagine it doesn’t,” she said. Sherlock looked down at his plate and picked at his food. “So, what happened with this friend?”
“Oh John, you insult me. As if there were any chance I haven’t already deduced every single thing that turns you on,” he said, looking up at John from underneath thick eyelashes innocently.
“When we get back to London, I’m never coming back to Florida; it really is a horrible state,” she said, looking around in distaste. Sherlock’s lips twitched in amusement.
“Then we won’t make it awkward,” Sherlock said simply. He was a little confused as to why this same subject was being brought up again. It wasn’t like they were especially close friends—at least not by John’s standards, by Sherlock’s standards, anyone who he didn’t hate could be considered a close friend. But John had so many friends. What use did he have for a cold, strange freak, three years his junior?
It was horribly distracting. It was hard enough for John to do his job with Sherlock always looking gorgeous in the corner, but the way he was acting was making significantly more difficult.
“I’m sure they’re all just upset that they can’t do it, and they’re just happy someone can,” he said bluntly. He ducked his head, ashamed. He looked back up, however, when he felt John’s hand tighten on his knee.
“Would either of you like some eggs or bacon? Coffee?” John said quickly before Sherlock did anything that could possibly get him arrested. But when he looked up at Lestrade, he found that the man was smiling.
“John!” yelled Sherlock, seeing stars as. John pulled out slowly, letting Sherlock feel every ridge and every vein. He watched as dark curls spread out on the white pillow as Sherlock threw his head back and as sweat glistened over his smooth skin.
and the whole time, all I could think about was how much I wanted you to be there,” Sherlock said, staring at his hands. John’s breath caught in his throat, and he swore he could feel his heart stuttering in his chest.
"Yes, fuck yes. In the bedside table," he gasped. At that moment, John knew that Sherlock was truly talented because he somehow managed to arch himself off the bed and get the lube while still giving John the best hand job he had ever gotten.
"Then hurry up and fuck me already," Sherlock tried to snap, but the effect was lost when Sherlock's voice strained and he let out an involuntary whimper. John smirked before suddenly snapping his hips forward, sliding himself all the way into Sherlock, until his thighs met Sherlock's arse.
"Sherlock Holmes," he corrected, "close, though." John thought about replying but at that moment Sherlock had twisted his wrist in a particularly wicked way and it stole the words right from his mouth.
“More, Captain,” Sherlock gasped, clenching around John’s cock. John picked up the pace, brushing over Sherlock’s prostate with every hard thrust. “Harder, please.”
It took John the better part of two hours to get Sherlock out of the store. After they picked up the alcohol, John remembered that he had to do actual shopping. Grocery shopping with Sherlock was significantly harder than it should have been. He kept picking up random things and placing them into the cart as if he would actually buy them, and John kept having to take them out and replace them with normal things. Most of the time, this went unnoticed by Sherlock, but the few times he did notice were exasperating.
“That girl over there has been eyeing you all night and is planning on giving you her number.” John looked over at the girl in question and shrugged.
His results were mildly disappointing. It felt nice, sure, but all the skin and the sweat and the grunting rather put Sherlock off. He did, however, discover that he was gay, a fact which had never really bothered him. Of all his sexual
“Yes,” he said, but it was more of a whisper, and his eyes were so open and so, so, soft. John sat up and straddled him once more, without breaking eye contact. He slowly pulled Sherlock’s trousers off his long legs and only broke eye contact to run his eyes over Sherlock’s beautiful body, noticing the goose pimples that raised on Sherlock’s pale skin everywhere his eyes looked. He reached up and ran a finger along the inner elastic of Sherlock’s pants, unable to stop his tongue from flicking out and licking his bottom lip. He looked back up to Sherlock’s eyes, now heavy-lidded, but still so open that it made John’s heart ache.
“We aren’t exactly talking anymore,” Sherlock said, trying to ignore how tight his throat got at the words. He kept his eyes fixed on his plate so he wouldn’t have to look at Mrs. Hudson, but he looked up when her soft hand covered his on the table.
“Can’t do what?” John asked slowly, not daring himself to hope. He knew that if he got his hopes up, only for them to be crushed again he wouldn’t survive it—he just wouldn’t. Sherlock looked down at his hands and John noticed for the first time that they were shaking. He wanted to look at Sherlock’s pupils to see if he was high, but he wouldn’t meet his eyes.
“And aren’t you just overjoyed about it?” Sherlock asked, smirking slightly. He watched the look of hatred spread over his professor’s ordinarily kind face, and found himself picturing the look of disappointment that would be on John’s face if he had seen the exchange.
After he retrieved it from the bedside table, Sherlock unceremoniously shoved the lube into John's hands and flipped himself over so he was on his hands and knees. John sucked in a breath at the sight of Sherlock presenting himself like that.
“I’m fine,” he replied in a slightly choked voice, still not opening his eyes. If he did, and saw John in his military uniform again, he knew he wouldn’t be able to control his actions. Though their relationship had changed significantly when John came back to live with him again, with lingering touches and long glances, Sherlock knew it would be inappropriate for him to jump his flatmate out of the blue.
“You’re a prat,” John said, turning his head to look at Sherlock, his tone light, and voice full of laughter and adoration. Sherlock turned his head to look at John, so their noses were almost brushing and their eyes were locked on each other.
John glanced at the clock again and realized with the start that his six minutes had passed long ago. He stood as carefully as possible, not wanting to wake Sherlock, knowing how rare it was the boy slept at all, let alone the whole night through.
“Good morning, John. Did you sleep well?” Mike asked, in an overly formal tone. The kind he only used when there was something going on.
“And at the most?” John asked, lifting his chin to prepare himself for the worst. Sherlock didn’t answer for a long moment.
“Then don’t bother coming home at all tonight, you’ll only upset her,” he replied scathingly. He whirled around left the shop in a huff, fingers tight around the handle of his umbrella. Sherlock huffed, burrowing himself deeper into the armchair, fuming.
“Mr. Holmes!” Sherlock lifted his head, trying not to show that the exclamation had startled him out of daydreaming about John.
“Aren’t you going to answer, Mr. Watson?” she asked, nodding to the payphone. “My boss does hate to wait.” John looked from her to the phone and back again, before marching to the phone apprehensively.
“Were you watching me sleep?” he asked, his voice still fuzzy. Sherlock worried for a moment that watching him sleep might be one of those things that he considered “not good,” but then he caught the soft smile playing on his lips and relaxed.
“Yes, I suppose that’s what your father says to you right before he beats you, isn’t it?” he knows as soon as the words leave his mouth, that he has gone too far. It was always his problem—his mouth didn’t know when to stop. Sebastian’s face turned a horrible shade of puce, and he breathed hard through his nose.
“John, please,” he breathed while John slowly pulled the zipper down. With a smirk, John sped his motions up, just as eager to get Sherlock’s trousers off as Sherlock was. John pulled Sherlock’s jeans off of him, licking his lips at the sight of the obvious tent in Sherlock’s black pants.
John finished washing the last mug with a sigh, checking his watch. He still had an hour left of his shift, but there was nobody left in the shop, so he sat down behind the counter, and rubbed a hand over his face. He got out his textbook and notes, knowing that he should be studying, since he didn’t have anything else to do.
But that was problem with sentiment—it didn’t delete properly. No matter what he did, Sherlock kept getting interrupted by thoughts of John. Images from the night he had spent at his house, how John looked in the morning with his hair a mess and nothing but a pair of pants on. Images of John talking with him in the coffee shop and being impressed by Sherlock’s deductions rather than disgusted by them. Images of the wicked grin on his face when he thought of annoying Mycroft.
“Yes, Captain,” Sherlock replied, his voice hoarse with arousal. John sucked in a breath, his pupils blown wide.
Addictions did that. Made you feel like you were in power and everything was under your control until suddenly, the rug was pulled out from under you and everything was crumbling around you.
"Please, I want--I want you. Can I--may I suck your cock?" John's cock twitched at the words. Oh, yes, John would be alright with that.
The car purred as it kept pace with him, and he turned fully toward it, wondering what the hell was going on. The door opened and John looked in to see a pretty woman with her nose buried in her phone.
“I love waking up with you,” he murmured into Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock pressed himself closer to John’s warm body and hummed in reply, deepening the kiss. His hand travelled from John’s face down to his warm chest, where he rested one hand on the steady beat of John’s heart thrumming to full wakefulness and swiped a thumb across his nipple with the other. He heard John’s breath catch in his throat so he swiped again and couldn’t help but punctuate it with a lazy roll of his hips. John grinned into the kiss.
“Christ, you’re gorgeous,” he said, and then smirked when he saw the blush creeping up Sherlock’s chest.
He was cut off by John deepening the kiss, swiping his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth and doing his best to make him forget all about trying to protest his inarguable reaction to John playing with his hair. Sherlock’s lips were so soft against his own, and his tongue so wickedly clever, that John was starting to forget every reason he had for not shagging Sherlock right there in the coffee shop.
“You recently lost that rugby scholarship didn’t you? I imagine working at that coffee shop must be hellish.”
“Necessary? How is it necessary? Aside from the age issue, which we’ve already discussed what more could you possibly want to talk about?” Sherlock scoffed. John floundered a moment before grasping onto a topic with relief.
In truth, Sherlock was only now, leaving the bedroom, but he figured that seeing each other wasn’t the best idea.
On one hand, he really wanted to, yet on the other, he was older than Sherlock, and he really didn’t look like he wanted to be bothered. Just as John had made the decision to go and try to talk to him, Sherlock abruptly stood up and left the small shop, coat billowing dramatically behind him. John glanced at the clock—there was still half an hour until they closed. He wondered why he didn’t stay until closing this time.
At first it was just to annoy Mycroft, then it became a place meet his various dealers, and then, a place to experiment. He had never understood the hold that sex had on some people. And Sherlock
“Of course, yes, I got to Florida last night, so I will have been able to spend today with you,” she said hurriedly. Her husband grunted into the phone and hung up. After Mrs. Hudson put away her phone, she and Sherlock stood looking at each other with identical grins on their faces.
“Excited this morning, are we?” he murmured into the quiet stillness of the morning broken only by the sound of their mouths moving together and their breaths sharpening with want. Sherlock replied only by kissing further and further down John’s neck, finding all the spots that made John whine.
They dozed a for a bit more, before Sherlock got restless and John got hungry. They padded downstairs (Sherlock wrapped in only a bedsheet, John in nothing but his pants), trading kisses and soft touches, both hardly believing that the other was there. John made them eggs and toast and bacon, while Sherlock deduced the news before opening the newspaper and was right
He laced his fingers together with John’s free hand and squeezed tight tight tight as he came with shuddering sigh; he would have shouted were his insides not fused with John’s, would have cursed, prayed, pronounced his love for the man in his arms, were his lips not busy collecting the cells from John’s body to be distributed in his own.
John set his mobile down feeling considerably lighter than he had been. So Sherlock wasn’t mad at him. It was relief, even if it did nothing to sooth John’s confusion. What had happened that made Sherlock dash out of the coffee shop like that? He hoped that the apology meant that Sherlock would be coming back to the coffee shop tonight.
“You reacted…particularly well when I touched your hair,” John said, running his hand through it again. Sherlock closed his eyes and visibly had to stop himself from melting into John. He bit his lip to keep the sound inside, but John kissed the lip free from his teeth, shivering when Sherlock whimpered into his mouth. “Don’t try stop that noise, please.”
“Martha,” a male, greasy voice said from the phone. “I heard you were in town. Why didn’t you tell me you were coming?”
And if there was one thing that Sherlock knew, it was how to deal with addiction. He knew what he had to do. He knew that his fascination with John was, for the most part, curiosity. Curiosity for one of the few people that hadn’t immediately disregarded him as a freak. Sherlock knew that he would never be able to move on as long as that curiosity remained. He was sure that it was the same curiosity that held John there.
“What are your intentions with Sherlock Holmes?” Mycroft asked after their silent battle for dominance.
“Of course,” Sherlock replied, standing as well, thinking that there wasn’t much that could pull him away from John’s side at that moment. Especially after the bright smile John gave him when he heard the answer. John stood in his tiptoes to kiss him again, sliding his hands under the large coat to pull him closer.
He buried his face deeper into the cushion, the worn leather muffling his keening cry. He couldn’t go on like this much longer.
“You will either pay attention to the lesson, or go to the principal’s office!” the professor was fairly quivering from anger, and Sherlock, after weighing his options carefully, decided not to provoke her. Not today. Mycroft would still be home for a few more days, and Sherlock really didn’t feel like sitting through another one of his lectures. So he sighed reluctantly and slid his phone into his pocket, resisting the temptation to pull it out when he heard the low vibration announcing a reply from John.
“Actually, wait, Sarah,” he said before he could even recall completely deciding to do it. Sarah turned to him. “Look, I’m sorry, but I can’t go out with you again. I’m sorry.”
“John, you absolute genius!” he said, grabbing the most expensive bottle he could find. He threw John a sharp look. “Be grateful, John, I don’t toss that word about lightly.” John laughed.
). The taller boy had curled up against his side, resting his head against John’s chest. Their legs were tangled together along with the linens.
"God, Sherlock you're are so beautiful," John murmured against his warm, porcelain skin. He sucked and bit at Sherlock's neck until he had made a sizable bruise there. "Tomorrow, you are not going to lift the collar of your coat, and you are not going to wear your scarf. You going to show everybody whose you are and how proud you are of it. You are mine."
“So are you planning on joining the force too, then?” Lestrade asked. Sherlock scoffed and rolled his eyes.
“Make sure it’s extra crispy,” he commented, resting his chin on John’s shoulder as he looked over it to see the bacon frying on the pan. He wrapped his long arms around John’s waist, and pulled himself closer as John leaned back against him happily.
The second encounter happened just a week later. It was a Saturday—a busy day for the café, so John was working with Sarah. He liked her, and their date had gone well, if a little boring, and he intended to ask her out again. Soon, he hoped.
“Sherlock, come with me,” he said with an oily smile. He looked ridiculously well-polished to be in a coffee shop at half past one in the morning. Sherlock glared up at him from under his fringe of dark curls.
“Which means ‘no,’” Sherlock muttered under his breath so that only Mrs. Hudson could hear him. She cast him a sympathetic look, but had no more control over the situation than he did. “Will you know by tomorrow?”
“He means it’s a pleasure,” John said to Lestrade, stretching a hand out to shake for the both of them.
“John, if we are romantically or sexually involved I can’t imagine that you seeing someone else additionally would be something I would enjoy. However, if that’s something that you need, I won’t”—
Sherlock snagged his purple shirt off of the hanger, knowing it was John’s favorite on him. He buttoned it up slowly, feeling the soft fabric settle around his shoulders. His hands were shaking slightly and he found himself feeling something he hadn’t in a while—he felt nervous. Not much made him nervous anymore.
“Jesus, I thought that one guy would never leave,” John said with a groan. Sherlock licked his lips at the sound, noticing how John’s eyes followed the movement. He smirked, leaning forward in his chair.
“I’m to take you home,” the woman said into her phone. John looked at her, then to the car, and smiled tightly.
“It’s kind of hard to explain,” he sputtered, “some personal stuff, I guess. I’m not really in the right place to be a relationship right now.” He knew it was bullshit excuse, but he had nothing better.
“No, please, John, I know I said that we were done, and I know that, but I can’t seem take it in, and I know you probably don’t feel the same way, I just can’t do it anymore, I had to tell you”—
“Do as the pretty woman says, Mr. Watson, and get into the car.” The line went dead. John listened to the shrill tone for a few seconds before leaving the phone box and getting into the car.
“Will you get a new table too? It’s bloody annoying not having one,” Mike said. He was sitting on one of the chairs where the table used to be, using one hand to hold the paper and the other to hold a cup of coffee.
“Fine,” Sherlock huffed, “you get off in half an hour, I’ll just wait until then.” He stood from his crouch and sat back in his chair, not breaking eye contact with John. John shook his head.
“Why are testing that?” John asked, making his way over to the kettle. “Want some tea?” He tried (unsuccessfully) not to think about the fact that he was only wearing a ratty old shirt and his pants in front of someone who may as well be a complete stranger.
“No, wait, John, look I know you don’t want to do anything right now, but I’m telling you, that going out is exactly what you need right now. Find yourself a cute little piece of ass for the night and forget that arsehole,” Bill interrupted, almost pleading, now. John sighed. He didn’t want to go out with the boys tonight, but he knew that they would worry if he didn’t. With one last, longing look towards Bond and Chinese, John sighed again.
"You've done this before, right?" John asked, suddenly unsure. As much as he wanted this to happen, he didn't want to hurt the younger boy. Sherlock threw a scathing look over his shoulder.
“Are you serious? Right now?” he asked, incredulous. After the orgasm he had had he wouldn’t be able to get it up for at least an hour. Sherlock merely shrugged.
Sherlock gripped the soft, worn armrests of his chair, trying to hide how hard his hands were shaking. He crossed his legs, closing his eyes, hoping John would just leave.
“Buggering fuck, I do. Hey, Sherlock, be a mate and take these groceries over to my flat—you remember where it is, yeah?” John asked. He had ten minutes to get to a class that was across London. Sherlock took the grocery bags, looking uncertain.
“No, he’s at his girlfriend’s again,” he replied, smirking. “Why are you so concerned about my roommate’s whereabouts?”
That, and the coffee shop was conveniently close to his house and the only clean place that was open past midnight that would let him in. their coffee wasn’t bad either. Certainly not when John made it.
That was ridiculous. John was a doctor, a caregiver. It was in his nature to care about everyone. That didn’t make Sherlock special.
“I’m sorry, but I can’t say for sure right now, it depends on how the labs are doing right now,” the man said, far too smug to be anything close to sorry.
“What’s wrong, beautiful?” he asked, stroking soothing circles on Sherlock’s hip. Sherlock shook his head.
“Okay fine, but I do want to know something about you. You appear to know everything about me. Have you got a girlfriend?”
“Which department in the Scotland Yard did you say you worked for?” asked one of the officers. She was holding a phone and had a hard expression on her face. Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson exchanged glances, and Sherlock was suddenly quite certain that the Americans could take care of the rest of the case themselves.
“Well, I’m sure you’re terribly pleased to find out that I am, in fact, real,” Sherlock said stiffly. John looked from one man to the other and was unable to stop the giggles from pilling out. Sherlock looked at him as though offended by the betrayal.
“I’m sure that’s not true,” John said in a tone that offered no room for argument, which was ridiculous, considering he was
“Fine, fine, I’ll come out with you guys,” he acquiesced. He could hear Bill’s grin through the phone.
Honestly, until this conversation, Sherlock hadn’t even been sure that John had really counted them as friends. He had thought that he was an acquaintance that John talked to in order to alleviate the boredom of his job.
He slid out of bed, stumbling a bit when his head spun from standing too quickly. He located all of his clothes and put them on, ignoring the ache in his arse. It was a good kind of ache, but it made him think of John.
“Sherlock, I’m—I’m coming,” he gasped. Sherlock just took him deeper and swallowed around the head. John threw his head back and groaned, coming deep down Sherlock’s throat. “Fuck, yes.”
“John, who the bloody hell is this and why is he burning our table? He ate all the biscuits too! The chocolate ones, I bloody love those!” Mike exclaimed. John came into the kitchen to see Sherlock Holmes bent over their table with a lighter surrounded by bottles of spices and the news playing on their shitty television in the background.
John moaned so loudly he was quite certain the neighbors were able to hear, and would have cared, but then Sherlock swallowed around the tip of his cock and he moaned again, louder.
“Don’t think you’re getting off that easy though, we're talking about this,” John said firmly. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Yeah, see you, Sarah,” he said with a wave as she walked out. The coffee shop was blessedly empty, allowing John to take out his phone to text Sherlock.
“You already know my story, you got it all from Sarah Sawyer after the first time you saw me in here,” he replied, rolling his eyes.
Hello again, my lovelies! Once again, I apologize for the lack of updates, though I have no new excuses and you'll all just have to live with the fact that I'm a terrible human being.
“No, actually, that’s okay, I don’t mind,” he said, eager to get home. He checked his watch and figured he might even have some time to eat his Chinese and watch at least half of a Bond movie. She giggled at him one last time and gave him a parting waggle of her fingers.
“Flip over,” he said, pushing lightly at John’s good shoulder. John did as he was told, and this time it was Sherlock straddling. “Can I?” he asked, still hesitant.
“Eh, no not really my area,” Sherlock said with a huffed laugh. John fought to keep the sigh of relief inside. So whoever that girl was at the library wasn’t his girlfriend.
“Well, if you’re looking for a replacement, that man over there has been looking at you the whole time we’ve been here,” he said, jerking his head toward the man in question. Mrs. Hudson turned and gave him a cursory once over, before shaking her head.
“Aw, c’mon Sherlock, don’t be like that I was just having a laugh, I mean, you should have seen the look on your face!” John managed to stop himself from laughing at the last second.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, but do you remember the first night you stayed here?” John asked, thinking about his burnt table, and the manic gleam in Sherlock’s eye as he raced through his explanation of the crime. He could very easily imagine the exact scenario Lestrade was describing.
Sherlock both hated and loved those moments. Everywhere John touched him, his skin lit on fire. Having John’s hands on him was addicting—even more addicting than the cocaine. If truth be told, everything about John was addicting.
“Watch,” the man continued, ignoring John’s question. He stared as the security camera swiveled away from him.
John smirked as he entered the cafe. He saw Sherlock in his usual corner and gave a wave. Sherlock waved back, still scowling a bit. The sight made John smile wider.
They stayed in Florida for the rest of the case, just to make sure that Mr. Hudson got the death sentence. When they found out that he did, they celebrated by going out to nice dinner.
"Sherlock, you're so fucking tight--you feel so good," John said, thrusting balls-deep again and again, hitting Sherlock's prostate every time. Fuck, Sherlock, I'm close. I'm about to come." Just as he said the words, Sherlock felt John come deep inside of him. He gave a shout, wanting to come with him, but unsure if he was allowed to. Suddenly, he felt John grab his aching, throbbing, leaking cock and give a long tug. "Come for me, Sherlock," he growled in his ear before biting down on it and giving the detective's cock another long tug. As soon as the words left John's mouth, Sherlock saw white as he yelled, having the best orgasm he had probably ever had. He yelled out John's name multiple times, both because he couldn't help himself and because he knew John would love it.
The first time John saw Sherlock, he had only been working at Speedy's Coffee Shop for a few days. The tall boy had flounced in and muttered his order.
“Thanks, you’re a lifesaver, Sarah you really are,” he said gratefully. The words were right there, on the tip of his tongue, asking if she would go out with him again. The words were right there, yet somehow, he found himself only bidding her a good night and walking out. When he reached the street, he started the short walk back to his flat wondering why he hadn’t asked her out again. He liked her, she liked him. There was no reason not to.
“Alright, I’m going to need you to take off your shirt, is that okay?” John asked, worriedly. “Just to make sure you didn’t do any harm to ribs, okay?” Sherlock nodded, sitting up on the counter, and started undoing the buttons of his shirt with shaking fingers. It didn’t help that they ached and Sherlock was quite sure at least two of them were broken.
John doodled on the corner of his paper and wondered if this was how Sherlock felt all the time. If this was what he meant when he said he was so bored he could feel his brain rotting. Because John did have to admit, he did feel like he was getting progressively stupider the longer he had to sit and listen to his professor ramble on about something completely irrelevant to the exam they would be having in a week.
“Alright?” John asked, slightly worried. Sherlock blinked, and drew in a ragged breath, and John swore he could feel the long lashes brush against his face, mere centimeters away from Sherlock’s.
“Explain,” he said shortly, placing the first-aid kit and bag of cocaine on the counter and crossing his arms. Sherlock sighed, not meeting John’s hard, blue eyes. It was an expression that Sherlock had never seen directed at him before, and it shocked him just how much it disturbed him to see it.
“John, you’ve met me, how many friends do you imagine I have?” he asked coldly. He had wondered why John couldn’t see that he was just a loner and a freak, and perhaps this would show him that.
No one appeared to have noticed, so he bent down to pick up the bag, and walked to the bathroom, not having to look back to know that Sherlock was following.
He worked his way down the thick shaft, bobbing his head and getting John in deeper and deeper each time. Before long, the tip of John’s cock had reached the back of his throat and nose was buried in the sparse hair surrounding John’s cock, happy that he hadn’t forgotten how to do this in his long years of celibacy.
“Yes, yes alright I believe you,” said John, running his fingers through Sherlock’s soft curls, causing a shiver to run through the man. “My, aren’t you pretty when you beg?”
“Your girlfriend hates that you’re joining the police, she thinks you won’t ever have any time for her anymore,” he said dismissively, before moving in on the bacon with a fervor that John had never seen him eat with before. He smirked to himself, thinking that a few round of sex was all Sherlock needed to get his eating habits normalized.
“Yes,” said the woman without looking up from her phone. John nodded to himself, and looked out the window, trying to figure out where he was going.
He wasn’t sure if they were friends anymore. He wasn’t sure what they were. That was the reason John had resisted sex with Sherlock to begin with.
“It was kids from school, wasn’t it?” John continued when Sherlock didn’t answer. “How are they allowed to do this?” Sherlock gave John a withering look.
“Are you looking for John?” Sarah asked, looking at him critically. Sherlock knew she was trying to figure out what John saw in Sherlock that made him want to be friends with the strange loner. Sherlock didn’t blame her, because he often wondered the same thing himself.
“Mike, shut up,” John replied. Before suddenly remembering the night before (well, that same morning really). “Fuck,” he said softly. He stumbled out of bed pulling on a shirt over his pants and padded out into the hall.
"Yes, there bloody is a problem, you arrogant arse," John replied, his voice raising. "I come home in a bad mood, and all I want to do is make myself some tea and biscuits and the cabinet with the biscuits is covered in some sort of shite, you are drinking my tea, the flat smells like bloody rotten eggs-"
and it was really quite elementary, I would expect a bit more from someone with ambitions to become a detective,” Sherlock replied, glancing at John’s toast. John handed it to him without a word, already picking up a second piece and applying a smaller, more normal amount of jelly onto it. It was Sherlock with the sweet tooth, after all.
"John, what did you do?!" Sherlock exclaimed, grabbing John's hand. John stopped his rant as he looked at rapidly swelling hand, which he had jabbed into the strange gel. Just one more thing that was going wrong today. "Rinse it, John, before it gets too bad." John stuck his hand under the sink, inhaling to start yelling again.
“You’re Mycroft Holmes,” he said. If Mycroft was surprised that John knew him he didn’t show it. He merely gave an oily smile.
Taking a steadying breath, he left, hoping he wouldn’t be back until the next morning. He decided to walk to the coffee shop, both because he was low on cash and the sun was shining brightly—an odd enough occurrence in London.
“Brat,” John chuckled affectionately and dipped the tip of one finger into the jelly and brought it up to Sherlock’s lips. He wrapped his lips around John’s finger and sucked lightly, flicking his tongue against the tip, causing John to take a sharp breath.
This chapter was particularly difficult to write (for reasons quite unknown, The Inspiration had decided to abandon me until I would literally have rather been writing anything else), so hopefully the next one will come easier.
“Please,” Sherlock breathed, his eyes so full of want. John knew how difficult it was for Sherlock to open up to people, how rarely he actually showed what he wanted without any walls as he was doing for John now, and he suddenly found that he couldn’t breathe because it seemed that his heart grew to take up all the room in his chest. He gently tugged Sherlock’s pants down, uncovering his porcelain skin inch by inch.
“The housekeeper said she was baking cookies when the killer barged in, causing her to knock over the bag of sugar, which spilled everywhere on the table. The killer then, supposedly killed the housekeeper’s boss and presumably tried to burn the letter, but the table caught fire. But, the police showed up merely two minutes and fourteen seconds later—a personal best for Scotland Yard, I think—and the table was already almost completely burned. Not completely impossible if it had just been wood, given the type of wood and the size of the flame, but you forget! The housekeeper spilled sugar all over the table! Sugar doesn’t burn, and as I’ve just tested on your table, there are no household spices which could counteract the inflammable qualities of the sugar. Meaning, she has to be lying about something—but why would she lie if she had nothing to hide?” Sherlock finished a deep breath. It took John a few moments to get his brain to start up again.
When he got to the tip, he suddenly and without warning, swallowed John down to the root, causing John to shout and grab onto his curls without thinking.
For a few moments Sherlock lay on his bed before getting up with a huff. He knew he was playing right into Mycroft’s hands, but not upsetting Mummy was more important to him than upsetting Mycroft—he could always find other ways to annoy his brother.
“John please you know me reasonably well, do you really think those mindless, idiotic buffoons could teach me anything useful? I know more about all their subjects than they do,” he scoffed. John rolled his eyes.
Both boys let out strangled moans. John ran a hand down Sherlock's smooth back before slowly starting to move. He lightly thrust in and out of Sherlock, not wanting to hurt him.
“Yeah, want to go out again? Sorry I meant to ask you earlier, but I got…distracted,” he said. Sarah smiled brilliantly.
“Yeah that’s what I thought. You don’t have any other injuries, do you? Any on your legs or anything?” Sherlock quickly shook his head again. There was no way John was getting anywhere near there.
“Buy me alcohol. I have a fake I.D, of course, but Mycroft told all the stores within a fifty mile radius not to sell me.”
“You went to see your sister today,” Sherlock started, knowing how much it turned John on to hear his deductions. John settled back in his chair and smiled.
“Aren’t you cheeky? Let’s get you a little less coherent, shall we?” said John, as he set about doing just that, adding a second finger and scissoring them gently. He found his prostate in seconds and—sparing a quick mental thank you for all the anatomy classes he had to take in uni—stroked it lightly. Sherlock gasped and arched off the bed, his fingers twisting in the sheets of his bed.
“How often does this happen?” he asked firmly. Sherlock tried to shrug again, forgetting that he was hurt and hissed in a sharp breath at the stab of pain through his stomach. Luckily, it took John’s mind away from the other bruises for the moment. His hands moved deftly and surely over Sherlock’s abdomen, feeling the ribs, making sure everything was in order, stopping to patch up his scrapes along the way. Sherlock had to close his eyes and hold his breath and fight with every last fiber of his being not to get an erection. John’s hands on his chest were by far the best thing he had felt to date, and he was carefully memorizing every motion and every feeling and storing them in his mind palace. He had no doubt they would be his wanking material for weeks to come.
“I’m turning over,” he explained as though he couldn’t imagine how John could have been so stupid. John shook his head.
“Anything for you, my darling,” John replied, and Sherlock could feel his face move into a smile against his own cheek. “What kind of jelly would you like for your toast?”
“Yeah, but like I said—wicked smart. He knows it too, though. Rude as hell. We don’t get payed enough for me to try and be friendly with him, if you ask me.” John chuckled halfheartedly, thinking hard. Sarah didn’t seem to notice his preoccupation, however, as they were just hit with a wave of customers and were far too busy to continue talking. However, John kept looking over the corner, his interest piqued.
“Well, then what is it, dear?” she asked gently. Sherlock looked at her for a second before coming to a decision.
Their orgasms washed over them slowly, and more like the cresting of a wave than the explosion of lust and heat that had been their first encounter.
“People do little else,” he said, quirking half a smile for John’s sake, but he understood what he had just been asked.
He had always known that his…appreciation for military fatigues would get him trouble one day. Merely the knowledge that John was a military man had given him something to wank about for weeks, not to mention when John had pulled rank at Baskerville. He could feel a drop of sweat roll down his back at the memory. He shivered, despite himself.
“Stop being childish, Sherlock and come downstairs to eat. You don’t want to upset Mummy,” Mycroft said, a slight warning in his voice. With that, he turned and walked down the stairs, knowing that Sherlock would be following him down within a few minutes. He smiled—his brother really was so predictable once you knew how to play him, and Mycroft had had years of practice.
Now, though he wanted nothing more than to just go back and forget about it. He wanted to have never seen John Watson, to have never felt that form of emotion towards anyone.
Sherlock rolled his eyes to himself. He could almost see the thoughts racing around John’s mind. If only the fool would just let the morality of it go, and forget that Sherlock was younger than him. It was a snag that Sherlock knew he would run into, but he hoped that he could convince John to forget about. Just as soon as everyone else in the shop left, and it was just the two of them, Sherlock would be able to really start making his move. He wondered if should pretend that Mycroft had kicked him out again and he needed a place to stay, but he knew that that would make John think that he was sad and vulnerable, and he wouldn’t want to do anything, out of fear that he was taking advantage of Sherlock.
"More," Sherlock said, insistently pushing back against the finger once more. For a few moments John watched in fascination as Sherlock fucked himself on John's finger, before he added another one. Sherlock moaned as the second finger entered him and the sound made John's cock throb once more. He quickly scissored his fingers, not in the mood for teasing anymore. He stroked over Sherlock's prostate lightly, watching as the boy arched off the bed with a loud moan.
When they were fully off and Sherlock was finally fully revealed, they were both breathing hard and ragged, and It had nothing to do with the tickling anymore.
“Go away, Sebastian, or I’ll tell the class what you go up to last night,” replied Sherlock dismissively, sending his text to John, not even bothering to look at Sebastian and his loyal band of buffoons.
Now that he had left the coffee shop without explanation and was rather rude when they were texting, he thought that maybe that would be what made John realize that he wasn’t quite normal and leave.
Sherlock didn’t come into the coffee shop that evening and John tried not to be disappointed about that. Having finally talked to him only made him want to get to know him better. Sherlock was unlike anyone John had ever met. It was fascinating, even if he had cost him a new table. John found himself daydreaming about him all day. He wondered if he was planning on getting high again. The thought of that made John’s stomach clench.
“So then why did you burn my table? If you’re not going to tell the police, then what was the point?” he asked, getting slightly angry. Sherlock looked at the table disinterestedly.
“Well, now that you’re here, I need a favor,” Mr. Hudson said, with the air of someone who knows they will be getting their way. Mrs. Hudson looked questioningly at Sherlock, and he nodded at her.
And yet, he couldn’t bring himself to fake another smile for her, he couldn’t bring himself to force himself to spend time with her and pretend that everything was going great, and he couldn’t bring himself to go out with her, when what he really wanted was Sherlock.
He shrugged and hailed a cab to go anyway, as he didn’t know what else to do. For the life of him, he couldn’t remember what it was that he did before he met John.
John closed up quickly, doing possibly the worst clean-up job that he had ever done. They didn’t talk much, but the air between them was heated, tense. When John was locking the door for the night, his hands were shaking slightly, causing him to fumble around his keys.
He took Sherlock’s hand, the long fingers cold, despite the warm night and called a cab, knowing he wouldn’t be able to make the walk home if Sherlock kept looking at him like that.
About a half hour later, Sherlock strode into the coffee shop, shaking raindrops from his curls. He smiled when he saw John, and John tried not to hyperventilate at the sight of Sherlock, with raindrops still glistening on his eyelashes and his cheeks rosy with the cold, smiling at him.
Just when he was at his last string of self-control, the door was flung open and Captain Watson strode in.
“That’s Captain to you, Soldier. Slip up again and I won’t let you come at all tonight.” A shudder ran through Sherlock at the words.
“Hey, wait, sorry,” he mumbled, pushing her away. She looked up at him with eyes glassy with alcohol.
“When did you get into Florida? I need you to tell the police that we spent today together,” he said his voice surprisingly casual for someone asking their unloving wife to help cover up a double murder. Mrs. Hudson looked at Sherlock with something wicked in her eye and something almost like a smile in her lips. He grinned back at her, the second real smile since he ended things with John (not that he was keeping count or anything).
“Christ, that’s terrifying. I’ve really got to go. Thanks, Sherlock, but don’t you dare go through my stuff!” he called before jogging to the street, hailing a cab, glad that he had a passcode on his computer. He sincerely hoped Sherlock remembered which flat was his and didn’t accidently break into another person’s flat and give them all their groceries.
“I should be back in a few hours,” John said lightly, leaving Sherlock still kneeling on the ground, “be good.” He left with a wink.
,” John groaned, his thrusts getting more erratic and Sherlock knew he must be getting close. He fought hard to keep his hands off his own cock when he heard John talking to him like that.
“Well, yes, we should do that,” he replied. Sherlock sighed and visibly kept himself from rolling his eyes. John giggled once more.
“You could do better—she has chlamydia,” Sherlock said somewhat dismissively. John choked down a laugh.
Sherlock lay there for a few moments, collecting himself. A few people passed him, but none stopped to help. He tried not to think about the fact that most of them probably relished the sight of him on the ground, beaten up and crying. He stood finally, on shaking legs. He picked up his phone and found that it was, somewhat miraculously, still working. Not knowing what else to do, he tapped on John’s contact. He didn’t want to go home, and the place he went to when he didn’t want to be home was the coffee shop. However, the coffee shop held no appeal to him without John.
“I can’t do this,” he replied, buttoning up his shirt and extricating himself from her grasp. “It was nothing you did, I just…” he trailed off, unsure of what to say. He and Sherlock had never been in a relationship, so he couldn’t even say that he had just gotten out of a relationship.
“The police only took me seriously because they didn’t have any other good leads,” Sherlock replied. “And, I had tried my hand at it before a few years ago, but nothing ever came of it, so I let it go. I didn’t even think about it until Mrs. Hudson told me about her problem.”
“Then what were you planning on doing with it?” John asked, finally raising his gaze to Sherlock’s face. What he saw there must have convinced him of something, because he relaxed his iron grip on Sherlock’s arm and cast a look around to make sure no one noticed the employee who had almost completely lost his temper in the middle of the coffee shop.
"Oh, John, everybody knows that you've been wanting that from day one. When you started to yell like that, I couldn't help myself. You have no idea how sexy you look when you get angry. Its been driving me mad." Sherlock spoke in a very matter-of-fact voice, and John found himself holding back a giggle. Of course he knew that John had been wanting him. He was Sherlock. You couldn't hide anything from him.
They reached John’s flat quickly enough, though they weren’t walking very fast, preferring to stroll and enjoy the night.
Some trigger warnings: you may have been able to tell from the summary, but some discussion of addictions, and a mention of prostitution (super quick, barely even a line)
“Fuck, sorry,” he muttered, pulling back, but Sherlock hummed around his cock and held him there, wanting more. “Oh, fuck,” John cursed again, gripping his hair and thrusting in again, slowly. Sherlock moaned around his cock, and John groaned in response when he could feel the vibrations down his shaft.
“What are you doing?” he asked quietly. Sherlock smirked impossibly wider, leaning in until he was off his chair and his mouth was against John’s ear. John jumped when he spoke.
He cut off, seeming unable to find the right words. John waited patiently, knowing better than to interrupt when Sherlock was thinking hard.
John was still asleep, his breathing slow and even and his eyelashes resting lightly on his cheekbones. The morning sun from the window turned his sandy hair into pure gold and Sherlock found it almost impossible to look away. When he did look away, however, it was because the blanket had shifted, revealing John’s tanned and muscular chest, which caused the breath to catch in Sherlock’s throat. John looked like a painting made of sunlight and gold.
“Er—right,” said John, trying not to laugh. He wasn’t quite sure how he ended up in this situation, but he was glad he did, even if his table did get destroyed. “Maybe call and leave an anonymous tip? They do that, right?”
Sherlock practically kicked the door of his room open and turned to John, but the ex-military man had him pinned on his bed in seconds. Sherlock looked up at John with wide-blown pupils, hips thrusting up into John's. John lowered his head to Sherlock's neck and placed several open-mouthed kissed there. Sherlock turned his head to allow him easier access, but John sat up, straddling the detective's thin hips. Sherlock whined, but John quickly shushed him by almost ripping Sherlock's silk shirt off and beginning to suck on his thin, muscular chest.
Finally, as the time was nearing eight, the flow of people slowed down enough that John was able to get away to talk to Sherlock.
“Forensics, but now that you mention it, we really should be going, they’ll be expecting me back in London very soon,” he said, turning around and flouncing away, his coat billowing out behind him dramatically. Mrs. Hudson hurried after him, and they left the police department giggling to each other.
“Me and Sherlock are friends,” John insisted. He supposed he should have expected this. He wasn’t even sure why he was surprised that he was getting the stereotypical older brother talk.
Of course John would be ashamed of him. Of course he wouldn’t want people to know that he was friends with a loser.
Until next time my lovelies!! (I'll try not to make that too long from now, but I'm gonna be in Ukraine until mid July so we'll see how it goes. To any of you who might live here, Здравствуйте! And hit me up, we can hang out!!)
“Right, um never mind, it wasn’t important,” John said shaking his head and turning away. He just wanted Sherlock to leave now. He could hardly bear to be in his presence anymore.
“I thought you said you were clean?” John asked, not quite sure what to make of Sherlock Holmes, standing in his kitchen in his wrinkled clothes, hair a complete mess with a bit of ash on his nose, waving his hands around like a loon.
“Mike, shut up,” John replied. Before suddenly remembering the night before (well, that same morning really). “Fuck,” he said softly.
“Is that so?” his mother asked. “Then who have you been texting?” Sherlock sometimes hated how observant his mother was.
He leaned down to John’s neck, the older boy lifting his chin helpfully unable to stifle a small smile at Sherlock’s almost child-like wonder. The smile turned into a gasp, however, when Sherlock unerringly found that spot below his ear that never failed to turn him on, and sunk his teeth delicately into it.
“I know, but you’re brother wasn’t all that happy last time, I was just making sure you didn’t need to spend the night at my place again,” John said. He half hoped that Sherlock would say that he needed to sleep at his flat again.
“From what I can tell. I would suggest that you go to a real hospital, but I can already guess what your answer will be,” he replied. Sherlock shook his head.
John rolled over slowly, carefully, so Sherlock’s head resting against his bicep instead. Looking at Sherlock, John sighed softly, trying to keep from grinning. Sherlock looked so soft and young in his sleep. The sharp, hard lines of his face smoothed, and for the first time, John could see the seventeen-year-old in his friend.
He sighed, watching John interact with his customers. If he was being completely honest with himself, he would miss John. He was his first real friend. But Sherlock didn’t have time for that kind of sentiment. He worked better alone, anyway.
“Then get up here and we can get started on that,” John said, a wicked gleam in his eyes. Sherlock crawled his way back up John’s body, stopping to drop a kiss wherever he deemed one necessary. John rolled them over so Sherlock was on his back and then reached over to his nightstand for the lube. John kissed his way down Sherlock’s chest, stopping only to pay special attention to his nipples, knowing Sherlock was sensitive there, and loving how breathy his voice got when he spent extra time there.
“Thanks, Jeanette,” he said before ducking out of her apartment with relief, and tried not to look too far into the fact that he had just denied sex with a beautiful girl in favor of a night alone with Chinese takeout and James Bond.
“I can’t do this anymore,” he finally said, the words bursting out of him as though he had been keeping them in for far too long. He looked up at John through his lashes without saying anything else.
John added a third finger and watched with awe as Sherlock fucked himself on them. Finally, he couldn’t stand it anymore, thinking he might burst if he didn’t have Sherlock right then.
,” he said. Sherlock chuckled softly to himself. He had never been allowed to go this slow before, all his other partners simply took what they needed from him and left, but John had
“Sherlock, wait,” John cut through the rambling, fighting to keep a smile off his face, hope bubbling up inside him despite his best efforts. Sherlock looked so flustered and adorable, John just wanted to kiss him. And he was starting to think that what Sherlock was trying to say was that he would like that, too. “Tell me what you want.”
Sherlock was at the coffee shop the next day as well. John, however, was not. Sherlock looked toward the counter and cursed himself when he saw only Sarah. Of course John didn’t work every day. He had classes and friends and a life. It was something that Sherlock would not have ordinarily overlooked and the fact that he did made him angry. John made it hard for him to think and caused him to act illogically.
“I was going to surprise you. I know how much you love surprises,” Mrs. Hudson replied, doing a very good job at keeping her voice steady.
“You can be loud, there’s nobody here to hear us. Mike's at his girlfriend's,” John said, grinding down onto Sherlock’s cock once more. Sherlock held John’s gaze for a few seconds before his head dropped back and his eyes slammed closed, letting out a loud moan. John’s cock twitched at the sound, and he bent his head back down to Sherlock’s nipples, wanting to make him moan again.
"Sherlock! What the bloody hell is wrong with you?" he said, pulling back. Sherlock looked slightly embarrassed, but didn't apologize.
“Hey, Sherlock, how’s it going?” he asked over the din of the other customers. Sherlock smiled in reply, clenching his fists. He wasn’t sure how he was going to manage without seeing that smile all the time. Then he immediately disregarded the thought. That wasn’t him thinking, it was just the lust. He didn’t actually feel that way about John. After they had sex, everything would be sorted out and they could each continue on their lives as though they had never met each other.
He stayed there until John was closing up the cafe at two in the morning. John had wanted to say something then, perhaps ask him what he was doing in a coffee shop for almost eight hours, but before he had the chance to, he heard the door click shut with a depressing finality. John tried not to be disappointed as the last ring of the friendly bells above the doors chimed. It was quite ridiculous, really. The boy hadn’t even been doing anything, yet John hadn’t been able to stop looking over to the corner all day.
“Sure as hell doesn’t look like nothing happened,” interrupted Mike, setting aside his study materials and leaning forward in his seat. John rolled his eyes, knowing he should never have thought that Mike would drop it. He gossiped like an old woman.
“Well, I wouldn’t have to get it from Mike if I ever got the chance to talk to you,” she said, sidling up close to John. He suddenly remembered his plans to ask her out again. The more he talked to Sherlock the more he realized that that was never going to happen.
“As much fun as that would doubtless be, I had planned on being ravished tonight, and that would be quite difficult during a quickie in the bathroom,” Sherlock said, against John’s lips. Then he pulled away with a thoughtful look on his face. “Though if that’s something you’d like to try some day, you would get no arguments from me.” John laughed, not letting himself seriously think about the idea, because he knew that if he started to think about shagging Sherlock over the counter, or in one of their chairs, or, god help him, in a bathroom stall, he would never be able to get them out of the coffee shop.
When John shifted and his cock stroked over Sherlock’s prostate, he was rewarded by a non-verbal cry of ecstasy that could surely be heard by Mrs. Hudson downstairs. John grinned and pounded into him again, even harder, enjoying the way Sherlock writhed on his cock whilst making delightfully erotic sounds of appreciation.
When Sherlock’s name was called to go back to Doctor Dieter's office, he froze, but only for a moment. Standing, Sherlock walked towards the office door, not looking to see if John was following. In fact, he had avoided looking at John all morning. It was making John wonder if he was truly wanted at this session.
Ella knew how much Sherlock meant to John despite him never having actually vocalised it. She gave him time to gather himself together, before speaking. "That's a lot to handle. How are you holding up?"
Sherlock kissed him back. This was much better. Now if he could just get John to take the blasted cock cage off...
John wanted that more than anything. "If that's what you truly want, yes." At Sherlock’s smile and nod, the Dom rose from his chair and held out his hand. Sherlock took it and let himself be pulled to his feet. Immediately, John pulled him close for a kiss, tangling his fingers in the sub's curls and pulling.
Sherlock sighed. “Doctor Dieter is of the opinion that my nightmares will continue until I have faced what happened head-on.”
“Yes, but I feel the benefits outweigh the risks in this case.” The psychiatrist next addressed Sherlock. “Of course, this is all up to you. No one can force you to do anything.”
John got a dangerous look on his face and the detective immediately felt the tables being turned on him. It felt like the shorter man was now the one doing the looming.
Once dressed, the detective returned to the living room expecting to see their landlady sitting in John's chair. Instead, it was the man himself. Sherlock felt himself relax. He felt safer with John there and less like a child being babysat. “I'm glad you’re home,” he said simply. He meant it more than words could say.
Inside his mind palace, Sherlock straightened up. He wasn't going to wait, despite wanting to. The need to get the whole thing over with was paramount. He reached out and opened the door. In a flash, his memories poured forth. Had it not been for Inner John, he would have drowned beneath the onslaught. With one smooth motion, Inner John pulled Sherlock back from the door and closed it.
“I just get so... frustrated.” John clenched his left hand into a fist as he stared a hole into the opposite wall. He was well into his session with Ella and that had been the first real confession he had made.
The detective went completely off line and stayed that way. Mary took over bathing Rosie and John guided Sherlock to a chair, pressing him down into it.
The DI let the paramedics take Sherlock and lay him out on the floor. They checked his vitals and responsiveness, soon arriving at the same conclusion as Greg.
Managing a weak smile, John looked back down at his fisted hand. "It's about Sherlock. I need advice. He's been... He was... Damn." The doctor hit the armrest with his fist, then opened it and looked at the back of it for a moment.
John was very disturbed, not to mention surprised at the admission. It felt like a large hand was squeezing his heart. He didn't know what to say. He felt even more powerless to help the detective.
"Jesus, sorry. Sorry." The doctor berated himself for ten times the idiot. "I just don't seem to be able to think. Sorry."
John scoffed quietly and rolled his eyes. He stared down at the text on the screen, chewing on his lip, fingers hovering with trepidation, trembling, before he gritted his teeth and typed it out, pressing send immediately before he could lose his cool.
“This is amazing,” John declared. “It’s perfect! You’ll get him a gift and confess your love and then you two can kiss and make out under the mistletoe—”
"Irene," John said, in that whining-child voice of his. "At this point, I don't even know if I should ask him."
“I thought you’d never ask,” John said, dramatically pressing a hand to his chest. “First lesson of skating: don’t cling onto the railing like a limpet.” He gave Sherlock’s hands a pointed look.
“He hates me,” John said. “I—it’s like I can’t do anything right around him. He’s constantly correcting me, telling me what to do, insulting me. I can’t stand it.”
It disappeared, backing off at exponential speed, leaving only a faint tingle that was quickly smoothed away by the cold December air.
Sherlock's eyebrows shot up to the ceiling. "No, they aren't. They're made of ground-up chicken carcasses."
John felt heat scatter around his cheeks and did his best to hide it, ducking his head. When he raised it again, Sherlock had turned back around to face the whiteboard.
When reinforcements finally arrived to carry them away on a rough, scratchy stretcher, the divot in the sand where John had lain was sparkling in the sun where the sand had burned to glass.
“As I was saying,” Sherlock said, “I’m almost certain that he’s not interested.” He blew out a deep breath, unsure. “He’s never done or said anything that would make me think otherwise. It’s not like I’ve made my feelings for him quite obvious either. However—” He glanced over at John and stopped. “You look like you’re about to explode.”
“I don’t know if I’m making my feelings clear enough,” Sherlock said, right out of the red-and-green, after half an hour of The Holiday.
John snickered and skated past Sherlock and then back over in a small figure-eight because yeah, this was like the only thing he had over Sherlock and he was definitely going to milk it for all it had. “Anything for love, right? Not really romantic if your secret santa does triple-axels around the rink while you clutch to the railing like a lifeline.”
possible timing, because at any other time he’d be fine with it, or as fine with having a fucking crush on fucking Sherlock Holmes could be, because Sherlock Holmes was Sherlock Holmes and he could live on with the comforting fact that it was just a stagnant, unattainable crush
(Which, out of context, sounded very strange. And intriguing. Sherlock filed it down for later consideration.)
“I’m calling you,” Sherlock said. “I was told to. I have not been rejected. That’s very noble of you, John, but for the sake of your own health I’d suggest you not to.”
“Don’t do that, either,” John said, and before Sherlock could huff and roll his eyes, deposited the kitten into Sherlock’s arms. “Stay,” he told the two of them, and then scurried off for the box at the door labelled
“And I have a gift for you, too—” He twisted over to his bedside table and grabbed the nail clippers.
Sherlock’s hands fell from their rigid positions, fingers twining into John’s. “I trust you,” Sherlock said, and John felt something warm light up in his chest.
She paused dramatically before continuing. “I want you to call your crush right now, and ask him out on a date.”
“The cat,” Sherlock said. They still hadn’t come up with a name, yet. John had proposed a whole bundle, from Meredith to Pepper to Ollie. Sherlock suggested
John narrowed his eyes for a moment, scrutinizing, until he deemed the situation had passed. “Huh. Well, now that that’s done with,” he said, picking up his cup and looking at the mountain of whipped cream with satisfaction. “It’s time for you to lose your hot chocolate virginity.”
“Good.” John exhaled, the surge of happiness bubbling inside him about to bowl him over if he didn’t find an outlet for it soon. “Now get over here, you idiot.”
John told that to Sherlock, who twisted his fingers into his lap and looked at them instead of John.
Sherlock sighed a little, though John didn’t really understand why—it’s not like he knew enough to know anything. “He’s not a figure skater. He did hockey growing up.”
John was making tea. His hand froze midway through pouring the kettle, and he watched as a droplet of water skittered onto the countertop.
“I,” John said, and very politely asked his mind where the rest of that sentence was, because there was absolutely nothing there. “What?”
Across from it, wild dark curls peeked up from above an open newspaper. When John didn’t sit down, the newspaper lowered to reveal bright, slate-grey eyes attached to the curls. They gazed at John innocuously.
Glancing up, Sherlock’s eyes were skeptical. Not confused, but they held an ounce of trepidation and more than a little caution. John looked closer and saw the minuscule flicker of hope.
"But—wait." John screeched to a stop and looked, wide-eyed, at Sherlock, who suddenly looked very, very guilty. "Hold on a second. You
Maybe his quirk was flirting with death. Being in the right place at the right time, which, in objective, Normal People standards, meant the wrong place at the wrong time, often escaping death by a single, scythe-scraped hair.
The fingers on John’s right hand curled into his palm, suddenly and significantly aware of the fourth. He remembered it fit snugly. It seemed clamped, now; choked, with a strange chill in the silver band.
Picasso didn’t move. Her eyes were closed, now, and in the dim, dark-blue light of the moon through the curtains, the shadow of her tail swished lazily.
And maybe, John thinks, as he surreptitiously watches Sherlock from across the table on a rainy Sunday morning, hand tucked into his pocket and fingers clutching, tight and desperate, around a small, black, velvet-lined box—maybe he’s okay with that.
Sherlock pushed the snow off the bench with a gloved hand; it slid and toppled into the untouched ground below, scattering dappled patterns across the sleet.
"Fuck you," John said crisply, and then grabbed Sherlock by the lapels of his coat. "I'm going to kiss you now," he declared.
Mrs. Hudson was redecorating her flat. Time for a renovation, she had said cheerily, pulling out a few paintchips from her pocket that morning. After verifying that there was proper ventilation and that the paint was non-toxic, they had dropped her off and commenced the case.
Sherlock made a little noise of acknowledgement. John waited for him to speak, and when he didn't after a moment, prodded tentatively, "So are you going to say yes?"
John was too busy picking his jaw from the floor to process the rest of the conversation. When he came to his senses, Sherlock had paid for the drinks and had taken him by the shoulders and was steering him to the side.
“Thanks…” he replied, trailing off, wishing he could remember her name for the life of him. She smiled once more, this time with a hint of understanding behind it.
Sherlock grabbed John's head and pressed his lips roughly against the other man's. For a few moments John was too startled to do anything besides stand there, however, he quickly came to his senses.
“What are you doing?” John asked, placing a hand on Sherlock’s hip. Sherlock looked at him as though he was an idiot, the expression a familiar one even through the haze of arousal.
“Just once more,” Molly replied, her smile soft and shy. Sherlock sighed and didn’t answer stubbornly. Molly chuckled lightly after a few seconds. “Okay, fine, you win, I’ll let you sit there and sulk in silence while I do all the work. Again.”
“Eh, no from the looks of it, you need all the brain cells you can get your hands on,” John replied. Sherlock looked at him, affronted.
“She’s right,” Sherlock said around a mouthful of egg. John smiled apologetically at Lestrade but didn’t answer.
until they could come no more, and collapsed against each other, trying to find the way back to their own bodies, but reluctant to leave the other.
“Christ, you’re tight,” he grunted, adjusting himself with his free hand. His trousers were getting uncomfortably tight.
He added a second finger when he felt that Sherlock was ready for it, but he was so relaxed that Sherlock barely even felt the stretch.
“Okay, okay, why were you in America?” John asked. Sherlock shook his head, his curls shaking limply, with less than their usual life and chaos.
When John entered the room, Sherlock was sprawled on the bed, naked, with a bottle of lube in his hand. He shoved it at John with a pleading look on his face.
The thought made his stomach clench and he excused himself from the table abruptly. He had been angry at John, but he knew that was unfair. John had done nothing wrong—how was he to know how Sherlock felt, and who was Sherlock to expect that he felt the same way back? Sherlock knew that John was primarily into girls—though Sherlock had seen him check out a boy or two. Sherlock was angrier at himself. He was angry that he had let himself get his hopes up and believe that John would feel that way about him. He should have been happy with the fact that someone wanted to be friends with him at all and accept that John was out of his reach.
“I did say you needed to be punished, didn’t I?” he said. “And don’t you dare touch yourself—I’ll know and it’ll be that much worse for you.” Sherlock groaned, his hand falling away from his trousers, the thin cotton jutting out obscenely. John looked down at it hungrily and licked his lips, knowing the action would torture Sherlock—he was right. The detective’s breathing sped up and his eyes were hooded as they followed the movement of John’s tongue.
“I’m your friend. You know that, right? And you’re my friend,” he said. Sherlock nodded slightly, both surprised and touched. John was his friend. “Now, come on, we need to go to the bathroom, I need to look at your other injuries.” John stood, before reaching down and helping Sherlock.
When Sherlock woke up, the bed was empty. He rolled over, and his fingers encountered a small piece of paper. He brought it closer to his eyes and recognized John’s hasty, messy handwriting:
Sherlock broke off with a hoarse curse as John slipped the tip of his finger quickly. He slowly pushed his finger all the way in.
“Excuse me, you need me to do what exactly?” John asked. Sherlock sighed as if John were being the unreasonable one here.
“Jesus,” John murmured quietly, breaking the silence first. Sherlock huffed an amused breath into John’s shoulder, but didn’t reply, unsure of how to ask if that was what sex was supposed to be, or if that was truly as incredible as it had felt.
“I don’t have any intentions with Sherlock Holmes,” John said, not altogether truthfully, but he wasn’t about than admit to Sherlock’s brother that they had just had quite amazing sex, and John was planning on doing it again as soon as the chance arose. Mycroft’s eyebrows raised the smallest amount, and his smile shifted into something more resembling a grimace.
“Oh, of course!” scoffed Mike, throwing his hands in the air. “I have to get to class, John, you deal with this!”
“Because, Sherlock, you’re underage and—Jesus Christ Sherlock, how old are you?” John asked, suddenly stopping. He had thought that Sherlock was eighteen at least.
“John, really, do you think that with a brother like Mycroft there would be any chance that I would get anything less than regular checkups? I’m clean. And we don’t have to worry about you, you’re training to be a doctor, you get checked regularly as well,” Sherlock replied abruptly.
“I could do worse,” he said smiling, trying not to give away how much he didn’t care about the girl and how much he did care about the boy in front of him.
full disclosure: the reason this chapter took me so long to write is that my ability and experience to write fluffy smut (by which i mean sex where the partners are in love and the sex is a way to express that love instead of merely something that feels good) are lacking (this may, perhaps, have been obvious). so yeah this chapter was probably the most difficult thing i've ever written because i wanted to emphasize the fact that though it may seem so similar to the first time they had sex, they really have grown and accepted their feelings about each other
“Have a seat, Mr. Watson,” the man said. John looked at him with furrowed brows for a few seconds before he finally remembered.
"Sherlock Holmes," he corrected, "close, though." John thought about replying but at that moment Sherlock had twisted his wrist in a particularly wicked way and it stole the words right from his mouth.
“Yes, or at least everything would be if you stopped questioning me and just did what I asked!” Mr. Hudson snapped. Sherlock glared at the phone with such heat that he wouldn’t have been surprised if Frank felt it though the phone.
“It’s not my money, it’s Mycroft’s, I nicked it, and I’m not giving it to you, I’m paying you back for the alcohol and the table that I ruined. The rest is for the inconvenience.” John looked doubtfully at the cash in his hand.
The hardest part, he thought, would be finding a new coffee shop that was open until two in the morning. It was going to be horribly inconvenient to only come to this one whenever John wasn’t working.
“I can’t believe that the police took you seriously,” John said. “I didn’t even know you had an interest in crime solving.”
A combination of starting college, and participating (and winning!) NaNoWriMo had led me to wanting to quit on our boys like the horrible trash person I am. Fear not, however, things have slowed down and I'm back at it! (hopefully for real this time, but no promises)
“Good boy.” John reward him with another brush against his prostate before adding another finger and pumping, watching Sherlock’s slick hole stretch around them. With a harsh breath, John unlaced his trousers and pulled his stiff, throbbing cock out.
“Get both, it’s his money after all, isn’t it?” he said. Sherlock looked at him with something like awe.
“Great, me and some of the others will come pick you and Mike up at around nine,” he said, before quickly hanging up, not wanting to be on the phone long enough for John to change his mind.
“I see…” he said softly. Then he looked down at himself and once again at Sherlock. “Is it the…uh…?” he asked, gesturing toward himself—or, more specifically, the army fatigues. Sherlock gave a curt nod and curled himself into a ball, not meeting John’s eyes.
In the hopes of making my prolonged absence up to you wonderful people I have written you guys a chapter of almost total smut.
“I’m sorry Captain, please Sir,” whined Sherlock, all but thrashing on the bed. John decided to let it go just this once, mostly because he was so aroused he couldn’t see straight. He lined his cock up with Sherlock’s hole and thrust in, in one smooth motion.
“Is everything alright, brother mine?” Mycroft’s smooth voice wafted from the doorway. Sherlock grunted in response. “Mummy wants you to come downstairs for dinner. She told me not to take no for an answer. Apparently you haven’t been eating enough.”
"That was amazing," Sherlock murmured quietly. John knew he had said it more for himself, but he allowed himself to preen anyway. He was about to respond, but looked to see Sherlock was sound asleep. With a soft smile, John let his eyes drift shut and his body to relax as he fell asleep as well, wondering what the morning would bring.
With Sherlock in, however, John spent the whole time fretting and stressing over whether or not he should go and talk to him.
With a growl, John threaded his fingers in Sherlock's unruly curls and pulled, lifting his head off the bed and arching his back. The new angle allowed John to thrust harder, hitting Sherlock's prostate every time, and the moment John had touched his hair, Sherlock had gone wild. He shouted John's name in a pleasure and his cock strained and twitched.
“Got it out…? So that’s what that was?” he asked, his voice thin and brittle. Sherlock gave a sharp nod.
John had to laugh at the obvious distaste in Sherlock’s voice. He sat back in his chair, grinning from ear to ear.
Finally, John couldn’t hold himself back anymore. He opened his mouth and took the head into it, flicking his tongue against the slit lightly, smirking around it when Sherlock cried out and tightened his fingers in John’s hair. He sucked harder, but still not hard enough for Sherlock to gain any real satisfaction from it, preferring to keep teasing him.
In fact, he really had no good reason to not go out with Sarah. Sherlock was completely unattainable, not to mention about three years younger than him, so his ridiculous crush was just that—ridiculous and never going to happen. The picture with Sarah was ten years off—going a few dates with her wouldn’t change anything,
“Good boy,” replied John. He kneeled in between Sherlock’s spread legs and ran his hands down his pale thighs, licking his lips. “My, aren’t you just gorgeous?”
John lubed up one of his fingers without stopping his tongue and slowly slipped it into Sherlock’s entrance. He found Sherlock’s prostate and gently pressed it with his finger, increasing the assault with his tongue, leaving Sherlock writhing and fairly screaming. One hand was tight in John’s hair and the other was twisted in the bedsheets so hard John would have been concerned about them ripping if he could have thought about anything else besides his current activity and his own arousal.
“It sure as hell doesn’t look like nothing,” John said, applying a bandage and leaning away. Sherlock stifled a sigh of relief. He wouldn’t have been able to control himself for much longer.
“Look at you, you look beautiful. So desperate for me. You were a good boy, weren’t you? You didn’t touch yourself? I know how you like to misbehave.”
His lips were soft, so soft, and there was really no reason that one touch of his tongue should have that effect on John. John gently bit into that full bottom lip, like he had dreamed about consistently since the moment when he had first seen it. Sherlock gave a breathy moan that made John’s knees weak. With one last lick into that sinful mouth, John pulled away, smirking at Sherlock’s small whimper. It was a sound he knew Sherlock would never have made intentionally, and perhaps the taller boy didn’t even know that John had heard it, so he simply smirked and said nothing.
All thoughts of laughter stopped however, when Sherlock reached into his pants and closed his fingers around John's cock.
The first thing Sherlock was aware of when he woke up was that he was too hot. He was covered in a blanket and wrapped up in something very warm and unmoving. It took him longer than he would have like to realize that it was John he was wrapped up in and then another second after that to realize that the fight to keep a smile off of his face was a hopeless one. He wiggled so he was no longer covered in a blanket, but still close enough to John to hear his heartbeat. He lay for a moment, listening, then pulled himself up onto his shoulder to look at John.
“Nothing,” he said in a low voice, trying desperately not to think about how close they were to each other. John snorted softly.
He half wanted to talk to Sherlock, but wasn’t sure how. He wasn’t even sure if Sherlock would recognize him outside of the coffee shop. It was like he had ever done anything particularly memorable.
“I’m sure that you have your own reasons, but why don’t you just talk to him?” she asked, then paused. “Though considering what we were doing in Florida just now, I don’t know if I’m the best person to go for love advice.” She smiled softly at him, and he cleared his throat and moved his hand out from under hers.
"John, please," Sherlock said, threading his fingers through John's short hair and pulling lightly. John pulled off with a quiet pop.
“Then hurry up, so we can go back to your flat and you can ravish me,” he replied, only slightly joking. John caught Sherlock’s full lower lip between his teeth and bit down gently.
Luckily, however, they seemed to have understood that Sherlock didn’t want to talk about it and left the matter alone. For that, he was grateful. Sherlock wasn’t quite sure how to explain his relationship with John. They had only known each other for a short amount of time, and based on observations of other people his age, Sherlock would be inclined to believe that they were friends. Yet, Sherlock wanted so much more than that. And he had thought—foolishly, he now realized—that perhaps John had wanted something more than that too.
“Well, since you asked so nicely, why don’t you head over to your bedroom, and we’ll see about making that happen.” Sherlock couldn’t seem get up fast enough. He made his way as fast as he could to his bedroom, shedding clothes along the way, with John trailing slowly behind, smirking.
“I could spend days on this neck alone,” John murmured into Sherlock’s smooth skin. Sherlock snorted.
“Hello, John,” he said. John fought not to shiver when he heard his voice. It really should have been illegal for a teenager to have low of a voice. They talked normally for about half an hour until another customer came in and John had to go. Sherlock seemed to be acting normally, but his eyes kept lingering on John’s mouth and John noticed him licking his lips more often.
“Sherlock, come on, go lie down I’ll make you some tea and take your temperature. You really don’t look good.” Sherlock could almost see the concerned look on John’s face. The way his eyebrows would furrow and his mouth would curl downward in displeasure.
“I’ve never done it…like this,” he whispered. John’s eyebrows furrowed in the middle of his forehead.
“John,” he gasped, tightening his fingers in John’s hair until it became almost painful. John smirked around his mouthful. “You’re the worst person ever,” Sherlock continued when John still didn’t stop teasing him. At that, John was unable to hold back a muffled chuckle. “But I need you to stop.” John pulled off suddenly, concern clouding his features. Sherlock’s voice had sounded choked and serious.
“No, John, Florida as in the UK,” Sherlock replied, and John couldn’t help but huff out a dry laugh.
“How are you?” John asked after a few seconds of silence, and then hated himself for how forced and awful it sounded. Sherlock looked down for a moment then pursed his lips the way he did right when he made an important decision.
“Alright, but make it quick, I don’t want to be late,” John said, letting go of Sherlock’s hair. The taller man scrambled to get on his knees before him, shaking fingers making quick work of his trousers. He would normally have drawn it out longer, but he knew John was in no mood to be teased.
He wasn’t quite sure what it was about Sherlock that interested him so much. John had known for quite some time that he was bisexual, so the idea of being attracted to a man wasn’t alarming, but it was so much more than just a physical attraction. Though he was attractive, of course, with cheekbones higher than Mt. Everest, and full pouty lips, and his arse, dear god, that arse was going to kill John if it didn’t get him fired first. But it was more than that. Maybe it was air of mystery and chaos that surrounded him that seemed to be the perfect thing to break the monotony of the John’s cookie-cutter life.
The rest of the class was dreadfully boring, and as soon as the bell rang, dismissing them, Sherlock immediately pulled out his phone. Before he could open the text, however, it was snatched from his grasp by Sebastian Wilkes, surrounded by a small crowd of boys.
Sherlock turned around and regarded John with a steely stare. John, refusing to back off, lifted his chin—cursing his height—and stared right back.
John’s eyes softened as he looked up. A smile curling at his mouth. “Not a chance,” he said, and hefted the kitten closer to his chest. “Didn’t Mrs. Hudson own a cat once? I’m sure she’ll have some things leftover.”
“Hello, Doctor Watson,” the tinny voice came through the phone. “I am in the middle of a meeting that could either establish national peace or unleash a pandemic that wipes out a fifth of the country’s population. I hope this is important.”
John took the tube home from a grueling shift at work. There was a nasty flu going around, and he’d seen enough snot and tears for a lifetime in the span of a few hours. He pulled out his phone, about to make a reminder to himself to wipe down the doorknobs and counters in the flat with disinfectant. God knew what chemicals and viruses Sherlock’s experiments had put all over every available square inch.
“You haven’t gotten any better at controlling yourself,” Sebastian murmured. “Still shutting yourself out from everyone else. Alone is what protects you, Sherlock. People get close to you, they get hurt. Or worse. Are you really going to do the same to John Watson?”
Only he can see those vulnerable moments that Sherlock trusts enough to let slip through his guard of frost and ice. Only he can love Sherlock the way Sherlock loves John.
John laughed. Sherlock smiled tightly and unloaded a giant contraption covered with twine and pom-poms.
Picasso squirmed one last time before settling down entirely. In her sleep, she began to purr, deep and loud as a muscle car.
The air was dark and murky. Lights beneath the arena lit up the ice in a pale, glowing blue. The wall surrounding the rink was dappled with red and green bulbs.
John reached over and grabbed Sherlock’s hand. Ice was beginning to form between the cracks of his knuckles. John intertwined their fingers, and it trickled down their wrists, dew-like.
Sherlock sniffed derisively and didn’t respond. John sighed and threw an arm around him, drawing him closer as they both went back to sleep.
and not too bright at that—with the way she grilled them relentlessly about the importance of safety goggles and washing your hands and not chucking dangerous, corrosive chemicals at each other.
“Not quite,” Emma said. “You don’t need to tell me a name, but can you tell me why you have a crush on them?”
As they walked, John wondered what he’d just gotten himself into. But he could never back down from a lure like that. It was one of his traits that got him into plenty of trouble, for sure.
Anderson scoffed lightly and looked away. Lestrade made a bit of a choking sound in his throat, and then again, and then Anderson realized that he was laughing. Which was strange, because insults were beyond common between them, and it wasn’t even a particularly good one at that. But Lestrade was laughing, loud and open and carefree, and he even wiped a finger across the corner of his eye when he thumped a scowling Sherlock on the back.
“Sure,” John said, and quickly back-pedalled. “If you’re okay with it, that is. I mean, if you wanted to go first I’d let you.”
One of which was standing right next to him. Sherlock Holmes was the first thing people had warned John about when he first entered the university, hushed words accompanied with side-eyes and a twist of the mouth that told Sherlock’s enigmatic and cold-as-ice attitude. Whatever you do, don’t try to make friends with him, they had said.
She grew heavier with every day, just an imperceptible bit bigger, ears beginning to fit proportionally with the rest of her body. Her eyes kept that watery, dinner-plate look, but it was only pulled in moments of desperation, when John was cooking and the smell of salmon drifted enticingly through the kitchen. Other times, they were calculating, whip-sharp, trained on a spider or a bloom of dust or a stray, rolling bullet behind the couch from the last time Sherlock cleaned the guns. John nearly had an aneurysm when he entered the living room to see her on her back, happy as a lamb, tossing and pouncing at the piece of metal like a squeaky toy rat.
Lestrade had had one hell of a day. Not including the toe stub on the interrogation chair (significantly lowering his intimidation points), the coffee spill on his one good shirt (blue-and-white pinstriped, classy), and the fact that Sherlock had been right, once again (bastard; he had one hell of a longing to throw him in the lake to see if he floated), the aforementioned Sherlock was now looking at him with one of the smugest looks in the planes of existence.
There was a certain tightness around Sherlock’s lips that gave away his nervousness. He blew out a breath through his nose and uncurled his fingers.
from John’s ear, all low and rumbling heat, and John flinched so hard that his fingers clenched instinctively and he turned the stopcock all the way around. A flood of sodium carbonate solution shot down the burette and directly into the flask, immediately turning it a bright magenta.
impossible chance, one of your ridiculously-dangerous experiments self-combusts in the middle of the night.”
“Oh, Jesus,” John said, coming closer. He stroked her back and grimaced when his hand came off wet. “That’s gonna be an arse to wash off.”
“You know,” Sebastian said. “Why don’t both of you sit down? Have a cup of tea? Play a little catch-up?”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. The cat narrowed them back. The fur on the back of her neck puffed up like a heated marshmallow in a fire.
Sherlock was silent for a good minute. Then, he said, “Are you a radioactive substance? Because you’re glowing.” To further deliver his point, he lightly shook the liquid inside the test tube, which sloshed and glowed a faint neon green.
John held it together for two seconds before bursting into a fit of laughter. "It really is," he said, once he'd regained his breath.
Next to him, Sherlock made a noise so quiet John nearly missed it through the pulsing rage in his ears.
“Sure,” John said. “I’m John. Watson. Second year med.” He gestured loosely towards Sherlock, who was standing next to him. “This is Sherlock Holmes. Second year, undeclared, though I’m pretty sure he’s just stalling at this point. God knows he could ace any major he chooses. Maybe criminal defence, though, or something in chemistry. His brother went the law route already, and with the way he talks about Mycroft, I’m sure being alike is the last thing Sherlock wants. But then again—”
“This is ridiculous,” Mycroft finally snapped out. His nose was twitching, and his eyes were beginning to blink faster. “Sherlock, expect a car to be waiting for you tomorrow at four. We will discuss this without any
“Playing dirty, now, are we?” Mycroft said mildly, and Sherlock opened his mouth to retort when, all of a sudden, a tiny bundle of Calico fur dashed into view and, hissing and spitting up a storm, collided into Mycroft’s legs.
, I’d definitely be creeped.” He tilted his head. “Does this guy know you well enough that he’d be creeped?”
on someone else, and that made it so much worse, because it meant that there was someone else who had caught Sherlock’s eye and turned him on his heel, and the thought sent a cascade of twists and tugs down his torso, stupidly, irrationally
"Yup," John said cheerfully, and bit down on his tongue, hard, before he could dig himself any deeper of a hole.
He pressed send, quietly huffed out a laugh, and then put his phone back into his pocket. He paused, thinking, for another moment, then shrugged to himself and swivelled his chair back to facing the window, where he watched a man try to feed a duck what looked like a burrito from the park bench across the road.
I don’t wanna hear it. Unless you’re trying to tell me your crush is stupid, in which case fine, but I don’t think you should refer to your crush as an
“Of course you do,” John said, internally punching himself. He gave Sherlock his best, most charming smile. “Anyway. Chemicals! I’ll, um, I’ll just go do that right now.” He stood up so quickly he nearly knocked his water bottle off his desk, and only managed to catch it with his amped-up reflexes (god bless rugby), and dashed away before he could open his mouth again and make any more of an arse of himself.
“Pleasure talking to you both,” Sebastian said. “John, I’d suggest you remember what I told you. Despite what you may think, I am truly trying to help. This isn’t about his quirk, it’s about who he is.”
“Llama milk!” Sherlock said. “I should’ve known.” From out of nowhere he whipped out an honest-to-earth legal pad and pen and started furiously scribbling something down.
He unlocked his phone. He had fourteen new messages from Lestrade, twenty-one new messages from Molly, and one new message from Anderson.
A gust of wind picked up and wrapped itself around John’s shoulders, the thin cotton of his t-shirt providing little protection against the chilling embrace. John pressed his lips together and said, “It’s nearly midnight.”
John absentmindedly doodled a few more flowers in the corner of his lab book, which was turning out to be quite the garden. In his defence, it wouldn’t be
Sherlock glanced at him, and then pointed at a pair of lab goggles that John just noticed were lying on the counter. “You forgot your lab goggles,” he said.
Sherlock opened the door—and then stepped back, nearly stumbling, when a splotch of salmon pink streaked out of the laundry room and down the hall.
John looked at Sherlock balefully. "Molly Hooper? She was your lab partner?" (Only because they weren't allowed to choose their own partners, he thought, with a little flickering fire of resentment. He nearly burnt himself on the Bunsen burner because he was too busy watching Molly twirl her hair and giggle at Sherlock.)
“No, wait—” Sherlock made a low, frustrated noise in his throat that turned into a sharp inhale as they passed over a nick in the ice. They had passed the halfway point of the oblong, now; John lengthened the strokes of his left skate and eased the two of them into a slow, lazy turn.
When he arrives at 221B, he finds Sherlock lounging on his sofa, head upside down. "You're back." He rights himself up and pushes John out the door again. "Let's go."
John flashes a smile at her and hastens to stand next to a sharply dressed man. Suddenly conscious of how messy his attire looks,  he tucks his shirt in properly and smoothed it with his hands. Once he arrived at his workplace, he clocks in and greeted his  colleagues. There wasn't much to do for that day. A man came in with a dislocated shoulder, but that was about the most  interesting thing so far. The rest of the patients either had the flu or some other minor illness.
On the trip back home, Sherlock notices a hat sticking out one of the bags. He turns to John, a sour look on his face. John simply laughs.
John let his mind wander off while walking down the street, sorting out his thoughts to this and that. He would've walked all the  way back like that had it not been for the sudden rain. He snapped out of his trance as soon as the first drop of rainwater hit his  head. Instinctively he fumbles for his umbrella, only to remember that he had left it back at 221B. Seeing that a nearby building had an awning, he moved to stand underneath it, getting out of the rain.
John merely smiled in response, grateful for her thoughtfulness. Bless her, Mrs.Hudson .She asks how John how he is doing, and  continues small talk for a bit before leaving him alone once again. He drinks the tea quickly, letting the hot water burn his tongue,  then left the cup on the counter, turning his attention to the kitchen stove. Eggs will do, he thought.
John hails a cab home, just so he could shave the few minutes off from walking, eager to shop with Sherlock.
Silence ensues. John still in disbelief at the transpiring incident. Sherlock huffs at this. "How long are you going to stare at me slack-jawed? I'm starving."
The familiar exterior of 221 came to view, and he finds his feet climbing up the steps and his hands pushing open the door with 221B etched in gold on it. Jacket thrown onto the floor, cane immediately forgotten on the ground, shoes carelessly kicked away, he dragged his body to his bedroom and sank into the cold sheets of his bed. Arms splayed across the bed, he fell asleep soon  after. The bleakness of the day had drained the life out of him.
In order to get back up his room quietly, John had to take off his shoes, his socks muffling the steps he makes. The cat's padded feet prevented it from making any noise. It arrived at the top of the stairs first. It nudged the door open and the cat immediately  slipped in. He should really remember to close the door. John takes off his jacket and throws it on the armchair. The cat is already  perched on top of the kitchen counter top, glaring at him, those icy blue eyes watching his every move.
When John woke up, the sun had set. The streaks of bright sunlight on his wall has shifted from a muted blue to a softer orange of a sunset. His limbs refused to move his body out of the bed and there he lay, staring at the edge of his bed. The soft lull of sleep,  the chill of the room, and the silken feel of the sheets are too comforting. It won't hurt, just a... Few more..... Minutes.....
Hazy rays from the sunrise filters through the apartment blinds, gently settling in streaks across John's bedroom. He shifts in his sleep, face scrunching from the slowly brightening light. His hands stretches outward, expecting cold sheets and perhaps a pillow. Instead, his fingers brush against something warm. Soft. The cat purrs.
The cat's locks were surprisingly soft. The locks of fur curls around his fingers as he gently strokes the cat's head and down to the neck. It leans into the touch and starts purring softly moments later. How quickly this cat changes its demeanor, John thinks. He  removes his hand, not wanting to pet the cat for too long and increase the risk of it scratching his skin. They stay like that for  longer, staring at the way the rain falls in erratic patterns, pooling into small puddles.
During lunch break, he went off to a nearby cafe with Mike. Mike had invited John to go catch up sometime, and John accepted the offer, pleased to have something to do.They returned to the hospital an hour later, chatting about current events. The rest of the  day passed on really quickly. The clock struck 5 p.m., announcing the end of John's shift. This time, instead of taking the bus, he  decides to walk back home.
"What for?" John answers. He stares at Sherlock, who is looking up at the ceiling. From the side, his cheekbones look more prominent, the street lamps outside only highlighting his contours more.  His lashes glow against the dark of the room. Sherlock tilts his head, slowly facing John.
Soon the rain lightens and eventually came to a stop, and John stands up, brushing off any dirt on his pants. He gives the a cat one look over, and starts to walk away. He had thought of taking it home with him, but is not sure that Mrs. Hudson will let any pets in.  Someone else will come and take care for it, he thinks. Not even a few blocks later, guilt tugs at the back of his mind. What if the  cat never finds a home? Oh God, what if it dies, and John is the one responsible for its death, since he could've prevented it in the  first place? He turns around, ready to hobble back to the cat.
Night passes, giving way to morning. Breakfast, shower, work, come home tired, sleep, eat dinner, sleep again, and then repeat the cycle. The predictability of everything only makes it all seem so dull. Mrs. Hudson rapped on the door, coming in a second later. "I  hope you don't mind, dear. I brought you a cup of tea. Just this time only, though. You looked like you could use a one." She  giggled and placed the tray on the dining table.
"No one will notice. Far more people wear more outlandish clothing. Now, let's go." He spins John around and walks him down the stairs.
"Well. Good question, really." The cat-man scans around the room, seemingly lost in thought. His eyes fixes upon a book on John's nightstand. Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. "How about... Holmes. Sherlock Holmes." He flashes another grin, proud of the new self-appointed name.
John finishes up the sunny-side up for Sherlock and grabs a bowl of cereal for himself. They’re fresh out of eggs. And milk. Add a trip to the grocery store on top of that, he thinks. They ate in silence, John mulling over his cereal. This clears up having to explain a cat to Mrs. Hudson, but a cat-eared man? He could make Sherlock wear a hat. Tuck the tail in his pants, or maybe a long overcoat. Wait.
Shopping went by relatively uneventful. Sherlock got himself a few dress shirts, some pants (both under and not), and a dark grey cashmere coat. John wandered back with a deerstalker hat.
The cat breaks off the stare, glancing to the side and instead stares off to the falling droplets of rain. John follows its gaze, looking at the same spot as the cat is. The streets of London is glazed over by a gray color, dark clouds casting shadows all over the  buildings. The loud crashing of the rain fills his ears. John finds his gaze back at the cat, eyes fixed on its features. He studied its  curves, the way its curly locks twists in some places or longer in other parts of its body. Its piercing, icy blue eyes looks on at the  world. Fixated on a part of the street as if something only it can see is there. Unconsciously his hand reaches out once again to pet the cat. It didn't flinch away or hiss again this time.
"Wait! Sherlock, wait." John manages to turn and face Sherlock, his grip still on his shoulders. "Shouldn't we hide your... cat parts?"
The cat...  Maybe he should call it- him, the man? However distraught John was by the sudden appearance of a naked man in his bed, he couldn't help but take note of how sharply defined his cheekbones were. His lips a soft shade of pink, if a bit chapped. His lashes long and delicate. John felt an urge to brush his fingers against them, but quickly pushed the thought away. In the midst of all the inner panic, the unidentified man had woken up, and is now staring at John.
Sherlock inhaled noisily and then let it out in a sigh, the tension seeping from his shoulders. He said, “And if he starts to cry, what am I supposed to do?”
John grabbed the second, unfilled mug—the one that wasn’t his, with one cube of sugar accompanying the teabag. He carried it to the kitchen sink and opened the tap until it was brimming with water.
Molly was just about to lock up, looking forwards to a long night of cuddling with her cats and rewatching Netflix movies, when the door slammed open and Lestrade marched in, dragging a reluctant-looking Sherlock by the arm in a way that seemed like he had taken him by the ear instead.
“Come here, Picasso,” Sherlock said, keeping his voice soft, low. He reached out, and John placed her into his arms.
Without pausing from their stroll down the campus trails, Sherlock turned to face John, his jaw open and eyebrows shot up high to the sky, bright opal eyes shining theatrically. “Who, John?
Emma aww-ed right on cue. John was too busy having his entire viewpoint on the world ripped out from beneath his feet like someone had yanked the carpet of reality right off the floorboards.
Letter by letter, John takes Sherlock’s language and takes it apart and learns it all. He grows to understand, to comprehend his silence and draw words from the tense way he holds his shoulders when he’s stressed, to the soft bleed of pain in his eyes when he’s patching John up after a case gone awry.
He barely registered hitting the ice, the dull impact landslided by the churning chaos that had exploded in his head.
John was too stunned to reciprocate. Holy shit, what was happening? Oh, right, Sherlock! He liked him, right? Hooray, hallelujah, what was that about the secret santa again? what the fuck was going on? well, none of that was important now, now Sherlock was kissing (kissing!) him and it was the least he could do to kiss him back—except he couldn’t really remember how lips worked anymore.
Mycroft’s lips thinned into a humourless smile. “Sherlock refused to wear his own pair. He’d freeze them until they cracked. We went through half a dozen replacements and a great gap of our fortune trying to sedate him.”
“I told you,” Sherlock said, rounding the corner. A lick of hair had sprung up, unbidden, right over his left ear. John’s fingers twitched. “I burned some eggs.”
"Hurry it up, Watson!" The coach's voice bellowed into the change room. "It's been twenty minutes! Stop primping and get the hell on with it!"
They hardly hurt, of course, less than paper cuts, even, but Sherlock scowled and washed them with disinfectant and glared at the kitten anyway.
John absentmindedly ran his fingers through Sherlock’s curls. Sherlock rumbled happily. Seriously, it was like he was a cat.
John heaved a sigh through gritted teeth. “That’s not my point,” he said. “It doesn’t matter whether or not you know it, it’s if you believe it.”
The door clicked shut behind him. Anderson furrowed his brow for a second, and then pulled out his phone.
“Excellent hypothesis,” Sherlock said, and he was smiling. “So what if I am? What’s your conclusion?”
“Oh,” John said. “In that case, I’ll make this quick.” He allowed himself half a second to swallow his spit and then blurted,
There was a pause. In the background of the other side of the phone call, John heard someone speaking in an accent that sounded vaguely Welsh.
John lived in a dingy, dusted flat five floors up. His lifestyle of cheap food and no pets meant his pension could suffice for a more spacious home, but he found that he didn’t really care.
“Enough.” Sherlock’s voice carried a promise that resembled a warning. “Your girlfriend of over a year just left you, and you’ve gained ten pounds in the past month. You are slowly but surely descending into methamphetamine addiction. There was nothing to move on from. We need to know the location of Peter Hochins.”
“Oh,” John said, taken aback. “So it’s a he. I mean, not that I’m surprised, because—well, you’ve told me before, not explicitly but you know what I mean. I’m fine with that, of course, obviously, because hey, I swing both ways myself, but—”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, placing both drinks on the table and sliding one to John. “Like what? Please and thank you?” He gasped a little.
Sherlock felt cold under his palm. He flinched at first contact, then shuddered, then went still, his chest rising and falling an inch with every breath.
“Likes me?” Sherlock repeated, twisting his face around to shoot John an exasperated stare. “She is clawing my third-best button-up into shreds. She won’t stop hissing. She bit my thumb.”
“She,” Sherlock said, “has been abandoned by her mother. Most likely the weakest of the litter, a runt.
The skating rink was crowded with couples, enough that skating backwards holding hands would be a death wish, but even side by side Sherlock managed to distract John enough for him to fall. His hand had narrowly missed someone’s skate blades.
“Oh, thank God,” Lestrade said. “If you did it to Anderson I think I might actually have to arrest you.”
Sherlock’s eyes shone as he grabbed John’s hand. Lightly stroking his knuckles, Sherlock bent his head down to brush a kiss to the back of John's hand, and then slipped on the ring.
John snorted. “Okay, princess,” he said, and walked into the living room to sit down at the coffee table, ignoring Sherlock’s affronted noise.
"I don't," John said without thinking, and then, "I mean, I guess I tried to do the homework more than I actually did it. I kind of just stared at it, I guess."
Downstairs, Sherlock was, once again, standing in the middle of the kitchen, standing right in front of the sink—
John was about to retort when a clearing of the throat reminded him of Emma, who was still pointing the camera towards the two of them, red light blinking accusingly. Right, they were still on camera.
“Good morning, John,” Sherlock said, casually, as if he stood point-blank from the door to John’s room every single morning. Which, now that John thought of it, wouldn’t be as unrealistic as it should’ve been. He thought about it some more, then was unnerved by how not unnerved he was at the thought.
John nearly stumbled. “Thanks,” he said, too surprised to come up with a snarky response. He cleared his throat. “You’re a really fast learner.”
Sherlock stroked her ears, flaky from nearly-dried paint. He rubbed his fingers together absentmindedly.
"Oh, really?" Sherlock said, and, in a swift move that was so smooth John would swear he'd practised it before, turned a half-circle and pulled John in close, until they were breathing the same air, heartbeats syncing. "I suppose we're the lucky ones, then."
It must have been the winter breeze, that made his chest constrict and his throat contract. John let his voice skim above the surface of true intent, lightly casual. “So what’s the real reason?”
