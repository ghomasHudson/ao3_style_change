"Thank you Tony for coming out here today" Steve whispered
"Hulk protect Bruce. Hulk be nice" He said and turned towards Nat. Nat just smiled and started rubbing his hand.
"Chop Chop lets go. Nat, Bruce, Carol and Rhodey in one car. Barnes, Sam and Cap you are with me" Tony said and started walking towards the lift.
Everyone started to scatter and Steve held Tony's hand stopping him. Steve moved forward and wrapped his arms around Tony "Are you okay?" He whispered in Tony's hair. Tony tried to nod but Steve knew how he was feeling. "I promise I will try my best Tony to protect our family" Steve replied and kissed Tony before they all went to dig up some information.
"Bucky I just really want to go out please do not stop me" Steve left and went for a run. He was responsible for this and he hated himself.
"I did it" Bucky whispered and hugged Tony. Tony smiled. He was happy that he helped Barnes. He knew how fucked up it would be to feel like someone else will take over his body. Tony knew that Barnes was not who killed his family. Steve hugged bucky. He was so happy and proud of him. Tony was about to leave.
"I would not have to sneak up on you if you would agree to see me" Steve replied.
"He is okay. They sent him off to bed. The kid wanted to stay up till Tony woke up but we put him to bed. We have not informed Pepper yet" Rhodey said.
Steve took the tags with him and went on a run the longest run of his life it was raining and the weather was dark just like his life he thought but he knew he will get Tony back. He will make him fall in love with him. He just prayed he would come back from the mansion.
"Mr Stark it looks so cool I love it" Peter said and hugging Tony. He realised what he did and took the suit and went away quickly to try it on. Tony just laughed and turned towards Steve
In the evening everyone visited Tony. He was allowed to leave in 2 days but he knew he could snuck out in the night as well but with way all the members were guarding him he doubted it. Bruce had told him that till he took less stress, ate on time, had a healthy sleep pattern and looked after himself he would be fine and Peter had taken notes. Bucky was confused about some things but Sam and him were listening with so much interest which made Tony laugh and earned him a glare from Carol. Rhodey and Carol were so pissed at him and Carol had taken her mission to blast Ross out of this world. Steve just stood in the corner making mental notes about Tony's health. Laura and the kids visited him and he was happy to see Laura happy.
"I can go on the Trial Tony. Shuri has cleaned most of the Winter Soldiers memory and I can control it. The risk is too high and I have not been in that normal line for a long life all my life I have been a soldier I cant leave this Tony" Bucky said and Tony just looked up to him. Tony understood the guy he was more worried about Bruce.
Everyone was gathered in the room. Carol came and hugged him, he loved how she did not super coat things for him ever that was one of the few things he admired about her. He knew she also made Rhodey happy. She worked with Avengers but no one except Him, Rhodey and Nat knew about her powers after the whole accident. She could fly, had fire in her fist, she could manipulate minds but that was something that she never did. It was similar to Wanda but she knew once that power was used you could not stop.
"Is he alone? who is with him? I need to see him please" Steve said.
"Wanda is going to get better at Kamar Taj she will learn. You know his knuckles whatever you told him he did that to himself because he was upset at himself"
"Sir it is 5pm"
Steve saw Rhodey sitting beside Tony. Tony looked so peaceful, he always did when he slept. He looked like a baby. If only Steve could go back in time and fix it. The doctors had clearly instructed them that Tony needs to rest and be stress free. Steve knew if he had to he will take all the blame away from Tony.
"I know but how can he still not blame me, I feel-" Bucky just wanted this to be over.
"No Tony" Steve replied and lowered his eyes.
After 20 minutes everyone was back in the common room. Stephen was standing a bit to close to Tony for Steve but he did not say anything and just averted his eyes.
"Punk"
"Hey there Steve" Laura broke the silence as they came out of the lift.
“Hey,” Tony says, looking confused. “Sorry, was it supposed to be a hands-only thing? I don’t mind, I asked you for –”
Having control of the blowjob makes Steve heady with power, but it’s balanced by the fact that he can’t really move, his limbs tied together, holding him where Tony had placed him.
He moves back over to the turkey and starts shaking containers over it, dusting the white-glooped bird with savoury smelling herbs, salt and pepper.
Tony laughs. “You’re not in trouble. I really meant it, this was incredible. You’re gorgeous, and your hands are magical, and your dick is –”
Tony crawls over him, straddling his hips, and leans down to keep kissing him. He rocks back and forth a little, sliding their cocks together, and Steve moans.
Steve is too distracted by Stark’s cock, jerking under the towel, the slightly dark patch from the dampness of precome, to pay attention to the words.
!" Tony remembers, tapping away at his phone. The projected photos on the ceiling disappear, and then Tony's voice comes out of the speakers around the room.
They’re supposed to be celebrating. They’d won a battle against Dr. Doom where everything had miraculously gone right. They’d worked as a team, truly, and the forces of evil hadn’t stood a chance. It’s a huge win for them.
Tony brings the paddle down again, this time on the other cheek, revelling in the way Steve’s skin goes immediately red, instantly marked under Tony’s ministrations. He’ll heal fast, but at least for the time being, Tony can lay welts and bruises where he likes.
“Okay?”
“If you’re tired, Tony, we don’t have to –”
Steve strokes him through the orgasm, and Tony is dimly aware, after a few moments, of his whispered praise. “That’s beautiful, Tony, just beautiful. You’re stunning, spread out for me like this. I want to watch you come forever, sweetheart, just like this, under my hands, unable to stop yourself.”
Steve pulls back, tucks a finger under Tony’s chin to bring his face up so he can meet Tony’s eyes. He studies him for a long moment, then leans forward and presses a gentle, chaste kiss to Tony’s lips. He hadn’t known there would be kissing; had assumed there wouldn’t.
“What did you put all over Big Bird, there?” Tony asks, engaging against his better judgement. He should be making excuses about important science, Stark Industries business, anything to get out of dinner. But Steve is moving so fluidly in the kitchen, almost as graceful as he is on the battlefield, that Tony finds himself entranced, wanting to draw the moment out. This thing between them, this easy camaraderie and acceptance, is new. Tony doesn’t want to let it go just yet.
, just wants Tony to know, that after everything that’s happened, everything Tony has taught him about himself, that’s what’s left – Steve’s love for Tony.
Originally, he hadn’t wanted to go to one of the government facilities. For starters, they’re mostly designed for doms to come and do a scene with a willing sub, not for subs to go and be dominated. Beyond that, though, Tony is also fully aware that most of the workers here aren’t free to do as they please.
“Wow,” Steve agrees with a grin, dropping the T-shirt of the side of the bed and pulling Tony to his chest. He presses a kiss to Tony’s temple, and they lay there together.
Tony holds it up for him, and now Steve can see that it has three loops in total, not just one round collar, and he’s even more confused.
“I thought you were, I don’t know… lonely. You needed to connect to someone, and I’m the only person around you can talk to, and –”
Now that he knows Tony isn’t with Pepper anymore – and how had they missed that? Had they really not talked to Tony in that long? Did Rhodey know? – he can’t stop thinking about it.
Tony knows what he's trying to say, though, and he laughs a little, proud of himself.
Tony shakes his head, nerves getting the better of him. He rocks a little on his heels as Coulson opens the door, and the previously-muffled sounds filter through loudly, jarring in their suddenness.
The pleasure rushes over him suddenly, a wave of white noise and darkened vision as his whole body tenses. His ass clenches, making him that much tighter for Tony, and Steve revels in the sound of shocked pleasure that Tony gives then. Steve's balls are pulsing, his cock jerking in the air and spilling come all over his belly. It's pulsing out of him; this kind of orgasm, coming untouched like this, is always more intense, but it's always less explosive. His whole body convulses, his cries raise in pitch, and he shivers, writhing in pleasure.
Things are just starting to not be at all interesting when Steve's phone vibrates, rather loudly, in his pocket. He's glad he'd remembered to silence the ringer.
The problem is that Steve is firmly ensconced in the
“I insist,” he says. “I’m the client, we’re here on my dime, and I insist.” He grins to take the sting out of the words.
“Yeah?” Tony says, and there’s a smile starting to creep over his face.
, he barely knows this Dom, but Tony knows he’s a strange Sub, that most Subs need the violence and the pain to reach subspace, and he doesn’t want to think about Steve providing that. Doesn’t want to think about Steve wishing he could be doing it now, even though Steve had said he didn’t like pain, either. He’s probably trained to say whatever the Sub he’s servicing wants to hear.
With regret, Tony slows his thrusts, and pulls his cock all the way out. He pulls the dildo out, and watches Steve’s hole clench around nothing. The rim is puffy, stretched, and won’t even close all the way – Tony can see a few centimeters into Steve’s hole as he gapes open.
Tony speeds up his thrusts, putting a little more force behind them, and Steve cries out in pleasure.
The man with the arm augment is gagging, choking on the cock in his throat, but he’s not struggling to get away. If anything, his own cock gets harder, twitches a little against his belly.
something I can work with. Out of curiosity, from a scientific standpoint, how many times can you…?”
He forces himself still, and he’s rewarded with Tony taking his hand away to dip his fingers in the jar of vaseline.
Steve knows it frustrates him to no end that he hasn’t been able to get in Pym’s good graces enough to be invited to work on the project, and that he hasn’t been able to work out the formula on his own.
He rolls the latex down over his cock, and steps forward, pumping another couple of tablespoons of the (thankfully) internally safe massage oil from the bottle strapped to his belt. He pushes the bottle to the side so it’s out of the way, and rubs the oil over his cock, thrilling at the taboo of what he’s doing. He swipes the remainder of the slick fluid over Stark’s hole, then steps forward until the front of his thighs are touching the back of Stark’s.
, Tony replies.
Tony grins, and it’s devilish, then straps the collar around Steve’s neck. It’s not tight – Tony can fit his whole hand in between the fabric and Steve’s throat, and it still doesn’t feel tight, so it’s good. Then Tony uncuffs Steve’s right wrist, putting it into one of the collar’s cuffs immediately. He does the same with Steve’s left wrist, then pulls a rope with a D-ring from the centre of the headboard, and attaches it to the ring on the collar strap.
They’ve been dating for months. It’s been so good – they’ve only had a handful of fights, and Tony has even apologized a few times, when it was unequivocally his fault, and Steve has apologized
“Maybe.”
But had they, really? The thought niggles at the back of his mind. What if they’d been manipulated into making the choice? What if the choice had been this, or die on the streets? Was that even any choice at all?
The next partition has two more people in it, a man and a woman, neither of whom are wearing a mask.
It’s a long time before Steve helps Tony sit up a little, and dribbles sweet, tangy orange juice against Tony’s lips. He swallows obediently. The room is quiet, nothing but the sound of their breathing and Tony swallowing the juice.
Tony snorts, mutters “Bossy little sub, aren’t you?” and turns away from Steve, straddles his chest, backs up and tucks his calves under Steve’s bent elbows.
has never been.
Steve sighs, and goes back to what he was doing when Tony had come into the communal kitchen and found him with his hands covered in white gloop. He starts… massaging the turkey on the counter. He reaches his hand into a bowl beside the bird, scoops up more of the white gloop, and starts to rub it into the turkey’s pebbled skin. It’s intensely distracting.
Steve opens his mouth instantly, pokes his tongue out to lick and taste, but Tony doesn’t push forward yet, just lets Steve lick at the head, tasting pre-come and clean skin.
“I love you,” Tony tells him, bursting with it. “God, I love you.”
+++++
“I know we had a deal. You weren’t supposed to – well, you were supposed to be there. To see Morgan grow up. You weren’t supposed to lose her and Pepper.”
Steve haphazardly pulls his own pants up, fastening them quickly, and brushes a hand through Tony’s hair.
"Okay, honey," Tony says, pressing a kiss into Steve's hair. "Have a little sleep, we'll get up and shower in a little bit."
“Shh, shh, honey, I know, it was so good, you’re so good,” Tony murmurs, dropping to his knees in front of Steve. Steve flushes at the praise, feeling light and warm and easy, and then Tony is kissing him, rough and wet and hard, like he’s trying to taste his own pre-come in Steve’s mouth.
. He knows Mr. Stark is an attractive man. He’s far enough on the sexuality spectrum that most of his partners have been men, so he’s seen his fair share of gorgeous male forms. But Mr. Stark is… just the right amount of compact, muscled, fit. He’s strong without being bulky (like Steve, himself), and his muscles are in good form. He’s svelte without being wiry, slim in the waist and thick in the thighs. God, he’s exactly Steve’s type, and his ass is… if Steve were a poet, he could write sonnets. The man is

"It's going to be boring without you," he heard himself say, the ache and affection indelibly tangled inside him, and regretted it while the words were still ringing in the air.
, and as the bright lights in my head came to life, warm  and molten  and perfect, one after another, I thought:
Tony shudders, right up to the edge of coming, but he’s not ready to be done yet.
He’s very tall. His chest is broad, shoulders huge, and his waist tapers into a neat little V. His feet are bare, and Tony finds himself staring at the pale, slightly crooked toes for a moment before his gaze travels back up the man’s body. His lips are plush and pink, his jaw strong, and his hair a dirty blonde.
“Oh, jesus, seriously, you’re a menace,” Tony gasps, wrapping his legs around Steve’s waist, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck.
“Tony, the way I feel about you… I don’t have the words yet. I can’t… but it’s something real. It’s something real, and it means a lot, and I feel like you’re either not in this with me, or you don’t understand how in it I am. So I’m rectifying that part. If you didn’t know how I feel about you, you do now. You’re amazing, and I love spending time with you, I love being with you, I – well, shit, Tony, I love you. You have to know that.”
“Fuck, yes,” Stark moans, and that’s the encouragement Steve needs. He pushes his finger deeper, and Stark’s arms snap to grip under his knees and pull his legs wider and more open.
for you, all day."
Steve rolls out the dough, presses it gently into a pie plate. He works on the filling next, letting Tony watch him. Pumpkin pie; Tony hasn’t had homemade pumpkin pie since his mother had died. He’d watched her, when he was small; the chef staff did most of the cooking, but Mom made her own pie, and no one else’s had tasted quite like hers since.
Tony laughs, and the sound is like music to Steve’s ears.
Tony thinks about that for a moment.
“Oh, you’re gonna pay for that,” Tony promises, shifting back a little more. He spreads his knees, and now Steve can see a hint of it, the furled skin of his hole, pink and clean and tight. It looks amazing, he wants to see if it feels just as good.
Sure enough, Tony is true to form. He stands at the foot of the bed, staring at Steve, looking up and down his body as he reaches into the red panties he's wearing and starts to touch himself. He starts with teasing strokes, at first – a loose grip stroking up and down, then letting go of himself to massage his balls. Steve watches hungrily as Tony's cock responds to his own touch, hardening and plumping, the head slipping out the waistband of his panties as he grows to full erection.
He's naked, save for the lacy red panties he's clearly been wearing all day.
Tony curls his fingers and claws his nails all the way up Steve’s back, and Steve lets out a scream, his whole body bowing as he releases Tony’s sac to yell.
Whatever. Tony can live with Steve being a luddite, he supposes.
Tony holds out another taco container. “You really

Tony holds up the collar-thing again, picks up one of the smaller hanging loops. “These would go around your wrists,” he says. “So your hands would be at your face, you’d have a little bit of room to move them, but not exactly

“I’m just asking.”
Steve works at it methodically, and he does a pretty good job of it. He dashes nutmeg into the filling mixture, and then reaches for the cinnamon, but Tony stops him, puts his hand over Steve’s, around the jar of nutmeg.
"Now, since you were too busy to look at the beautiful pictures I sent you today, you can take the time to look at them now." He taps a few keys on the phone, and then suddenly it's projecting his screen up on the ceiling, blowing the pictures up and showing them in their full glory.
“Shh,” Steve soothes, reaching for the cloth bags. “I think you’re going to like this.”
– gasps.
Steve knows better than to suck before he’s told, so he just stays where he is, mouth open and wet and warm, as Tony slides his dick over the slightly rough texture of his tongue. Steve looks up through his eyelashes, doing his best to look up at Tony’s face the way he knows Tony likes.
“He’s fine. Got a little bit of an education this weekend, that’s all.”
“Thank you, Tony,” he says.
Steve lays the toy down beside them, takes hold of Tony’s leg and gently lays it down on the bed, slides out from under Tony’s hips and reaches up to gently tease Tony’s fingers from around the wrought iron bars at the head of the bed. He pulls Tony’s hands up and brushes kisses across Tony’s knuckles, and Tony is floating dreamily, the deepest he’s been in years, but not all the way down. It’s comfortable, though, soothing, and if this is as far as he gets it could be enough.
Tony’s hand spasms, fingers digging into Steve’s hip, and he moans as that tight heat envelopes him again and again.
"Oh, the humanity," Steve says, deadpan.
Tony moans loudly when Steve’s hands dig into the meat of his cheeks, pushing and massaging at sore muscles there.
Steve’s steady stroking on his cock has Tony’s toes curling, even as he sinks another step into subspace. Steve lets go of the bulb and takes hold of the dildo in Tony’s body, pushing it forward and pulling it out a little, stretching Tony’s rim further around the wider part of the toy before pushing it back in, deep, pressing it against Tony’s prostate.
Tony freezes for half a second, but then his hands are up, gripping around Steve’s face, fingers digging into Steve’s beard as Tony kisses him back, lips sliding and tongue hot and dipping between Steve’s lips to explore his mouth.
Tony’s chest and belly are heaving with the effort of sucking air into his lungs as the wide dildo opens him, presses into his body and stretches him to a fullness he’s never felt before.
Steve is panting with the effort as he fucks into Tony’s body roughly. He’s not making any effort to hit Tony’s prostate, but his cock is big enough and Tony’s hanging at the right angle so that every thrust slides across that sensitive gland with every wild thrust. Steve grunts as he fucks, and Tony’s head is floating so deeply into subspace, down and down with every thrust. He’s made for this; made to be a hole for Steve to use, because Steve has needs, and Steve needs to get off, needs to come somewhere warm and wet and welcoming, and Tony can be that for him. His own pleasure doesn’t matter, it never matters, as long as he’s hot and tight and perfect for Steve.
Then he’s pushing down on the small of Steve’s back, and Steve spreads his legs, his knees going out wider and he arches his back, doing what he can to make his ass look as enticing and inviting as possible, and Tony groans behind him.
“I need to apologize to you,” Tony says, voice sounding hoarse and rough.
He nearly chokes and drops the phone on the table in front of him.
Steve’s head is too light, too airy, too
He leans forward, over Steve's torso. The action bends Steve's leg up, up, up, until he's almost folded in half, and Tony has to let go of Steve's cock to support himself, but he leans all the way anyway. He tilts his head to the side and presses a soft, gentle kiss to Steve's lip, the bottom one, that's stretched out around the lace fabric.
it in his kiss, that same emotion reflected back to him.
at 4:30, more like 5:00,” Steve says, smoothing his hands over the poultry. Tony’s actually having a hard time tearing his gaze away from where Steve’s giant hands are sliding across the flesh of the impressively sized bird. “And if we eat early, we’ll have room for turkey buns before Midnight Mass.”
“You could keep yours,” Tony says, grinning at him lasciviously. “Gotta admit I don’t mind beard burn on my thighs.”
looked at. He slides his thumb across the screen slowly, flicking through a couple of pictures. Each seems to get even more pornographic than the last. In one, Tony has his cock pulled all the way out of his panties, stroking it. In the next, he's on the bed on all fours, with the panties pulled partially down onto his hips so that he can pull his buttocks apart and show the tight pucker between his cheeks.
When Steve gets into his head like this, there’s only one way for Tony to pull him out of it, and that’s by bringing all of his focus into his physical body, into his skin and his muscles, pulling him out of himself.
Tony makes his way through that one, finding himself face to face with a woman seated at a desk. She has bouncy blonde hair, styled in waves, and she’s smiling kindly up at him.
“We, uh, we can move on,” he says. He ignores a surge of arousal as Bruce cries out again, as a little dribble of come forces its way out of his cock to drip on the floor between his spread legs, despite the cock cage. It’s not the fisting that is making Tony hot under the collar so much as Bruce’s obvious enjoyment of it. It’s more in line with what Tony likes in submitting, and it reinforces his decision to have come to this place.
Coulson pulls a silver domino mask off a peg on the wall. It’s delicate, adorned with lace and ribbons.
But the cock ring isn’t nearly as wonderfully unpleasant as the plug vibrating away in his ass. Steve had delicately tucked the string of his thong panties over the plug, so Tony can feel the tickle vibrating across his perineum and balls. He moans, the sound coming hoarsely out of his wide-open mouth.
“Do you have an appointment?” Her tone is friendly enough, but doesn’t invite small talk.
Tony leans down, presses a kiss against Steve’s back. Steve pushes back against him, and Tony bites the muscled flesh. Steve clenches and thrusts back, and Tony kisses the bruising bite, knowing it will be gone in no time.
Another squeeze, and Tony feels his cock twitch, feels himself get harder and fuller and stretched wider.
“Are you comfortable?” Steve asks him, even as he pulls some attachments out from under the table, swinging them forward and pulling Tony’s arms up, pressing his wrists down to the new attachments and slipping thick rubber cuffs around them to hold them there.
Tony expects the dom to fuck him, then, but Steve doesn’t move. He simply lies on Tony’s back and breathes against his ear. After a few minutes, Tony feels himself slide a little further down.
Tony honestly has
After another few calming breaths, Tony hauls himself up to standing, and then gently, carefully, helps Steve up as well. He gives them both a moment or two before he starts to guide Steve to the bed – the playroom bed, not the bedroom bed, because Tony isn’t sure he can walk them that far – and helps him lay down on his side.
“It’s hard to get,” Tony slurs, stating the obvious. Steve breaks off a small square and touches it to Tony’s lips. Without thinking about it, Tony obediently opens his mouth, and Steve places the sweet square on his tongue. Tony closes his lips and lets it rest there for a moment, melting and spreading sweetness across his tastebuds.
Tony opens them again, and Steve is still standing at the kitchen counter, his hands coated in white goo.
“How do you feel? Relaxed?” Steve asks, spreading Tony’s cheeks again.
“Whatever, the place with the… foam.”
“What’s with who?” Clint asks around a mouthful of peanut butter and banana sandwich. Tony tries not to look at it as he pours freeze-dried blueberries into a yogurt cup.
Tony has turned around and is leaning against the massage table, and clearly he’s watching the play of emotions on Steve’s face.
They’re having the same conversation they’ve had countless nights before. They’re eating dry meatloaf and boiled potatoes (it had been Steve’s night to cook, so at least they’re not eating underdone omelets) at their small kitchen table.
“You still hungry?”
Steve isn’t a dumb guy. He’s not the most suave fella out there, he knows. But he
“I mean, okay, I know it’s December 24, but it’s also not even noon, and it also doesn’t explain what you’re doing.”
catastrophic occurs, JARVIS will let him know.
Tony stares at him.
“Please,” Tony says. “They gave it to you to give to me, right?” He puts a hand up to hold Steve’s wrist as Steve tries to press another small square against his lips. “So I can do with it as I like. And what I’d like is to give it to you.”
“Aureole,” Tony laughs.
“I know I just locked you into those cuffs, but I want to see your face. I wanna watch what I’m doing to you, see you go down for me.”
“You are, baby, you’re so good,” Tony whispers against his skin. “I want – I need to untie you, Steve, so we can get to the bed, is that okay?”
Then the glass dildo is at his entrance, pushing in slowly but steadily. It stretches him, past the rim and into his body, deeper and deeper until Tony can feel Steve’s fingers brush against his skin.
And, like a switch has been thrown, Steve is asleep in moments, drifting warm and pleasant and easy until morning.
He’s nothing but want. He wants Steve. His hands or his mouth or his cock, he doesn’t give a shit, as long as he gets
“Red for stop, yellow for pause, green for go?” Steve clarifies. Traffic lights haven’t been used in the cities for a long time, and there’s no need for them in any of the surviving towns. Tony nods, so Steve nods as well. “Okay, and can you snap your fingers if your mouth is otherwise occupied?”
Tony tilts his head. “I haven’t. They haven’t even been born yet.”
friends. And co-parents. With separate bedrooms.”
Tony doesn’t know what else to say, so he says nothing. He simply walks toward the door to the room and leaves, closing it behind himself as he makes his way through the corridors – echoing with sex and cries and slaps of flesh or leather on flesh – and straight out onto the dingy, dark street, toward Happy and the car and home. He’ll
“Yeah, but you –”
“I’m all right,” Steve tries again, but the argument is bringing Tony up faster than he’d like. On the other hand, he’d been brought down so wonderfully that the upswing is smooth, and there’s no subdrop looming in sight.
, which is a thought he’s not supposed to be letting himself have.
“Oh, that’s it, that’s it honey,” Tony croons, stroking him through it. “You’re beautiful like this, come on.”
It's just a photo, with no text included. The problem is that it's a picture of Tony – Tony dressed only in a pair of lacy red panties. He's got one hand draped provocatively across the arc reactor, and the other is draped over his own hip, drawing Steve's eye instantly to his half-hard erection bulging out of the lacy red fabric.
Steven Grant and Howard Potts drive back to Philly and put the car back where they found it, and settle in to wait. Steve grows his beard back so he’s less recognizable, and Tony shaves his off so he doesn’t stand out so much.
The last buckle clips shut under Tony’s fingers, and he steps back to survey his handiwork, making sure to trail his fingertips along Steve’s bound forearm as he moves. Steve’s breathing is deep and a little fast, but not in an alarming way – in an excited way.
Thick lube dribbles down his thigh, and his hole is stretched and red, looking wildly abused.
“Sexually.”
“Want – wanna be good. For you,” Steve pants when Tony slides his mouth down Steve’s throat. Steve arches his head back, back, baring his throat to Tony.
“Pep and I – we’re not actually together anymore. I mean, we live together, and I guess every once in a while we – but we’re not married. We ‘uncoupled’, it’s all the rage, but we’re not – we’re still
There are protests from Yen and Hawley, but the SHIELD and Avengers personnel in the room with Steve all look somewhat relieved.
“I love you,” Tony murmurs again, into the skin of Steve’s neck, lips brushing against the deep red collar.
“Yes,” Tony admits.
“Oh,” Steve says again.
“This is awkward,” Tony says after a beat. He just can’t help himself from getting a dig in at Steve’s expense, after all, if for no other reason than to make sure Steve doesn’t notice the way Tony can’t keep his eyes off the other man.
They're spread over one half of the table. The other side of the table has no chairs for anyone to sit – instead, there are holo-pads lined up along that side of the room, and the projectors around the room are all shining in their direction to project holograms of the members of the WSC so it seems they're in the room.
“– fucking come all over your amazing tits –”
“Wow, what a terrible hardship that would be,” Tony deadpans, lips twitching. “Actually, we forgot about the vibrator, I was going to use that, too.”
Steve takes a deep breath, pushes his legs a little further apart.
Tony’s got hope, at least.
“Okay,” Tony says, his hand up again to forestall whatever Steve feels the need to say. “Whatever it is, Steve, it’s going to be okay.”
There are also private brothels in the city, but they don’t have the standards and regulations that the government-run ones do. The government brothels may not pay their workers, but they keep them housed and clothed and clean, keep them protected from dangerous clients and disease, match them up with customers based on the many, many surveys Tony had had to fill out.
Steve’s cock jumps at that. Yes, that’s what he wants. To be tied down to Tony’s bed, at his mercy.
"That's good, Steve," Tony sighs. "That's real good."
“Mr. Stark,” Coulson says with a dip of his chin. “If you’ll follow me?”
guys.
Sub,” Steve says, not answering the question. “The way you gave yourself over? The way you let me… God, Tony. It was gorgeous. You were so perfect.”
Tony collapses over him, pressing their chests together, completely unconcerned about the mess of come all over Steve’s torso. They’re both breathing hard, hearts pounding hard and fast, shivering with the aftershocks. After a moment, Tony manages to lift his head and press quick, gentle kisses all over Steve’s face – his jaw, his eyes, his cheeks, his forehead, then finally his mouth, and this is a longer kiss, deep and wet and soft, tongue licking into Steve’s mouth.
“What’s your colour, honey?”
. So it only takes a few nights in bed with Steve (in quick succession because apparently Steve has some pent-up sexual tension and has been relatively celibate since the ice, and Steve and Tony are
Tony lets his thumb slide inside the wet heat of Steve’s mouth, curling the pad of his thumb under Steve’s tongue to take hold of his lower jaw. He tugs gently, and Steve’s mouth drops open obediently, his cheeks pink.
Tony holds out another grape, and Steve accepts it. He slowly feeds Steve grape after grape, sneaking a few for himself, until the bowl is empty. “Do you need a bath, honey, or just a wipedown?”
Steve shifts experimentally. He can make fists just under and in front of his chin, but he can’t do much else with his hands.
Steve kisses Tony’s face, wiping up the last traces of his own release with his tongue, and Tony moans, limbs heavy and immovable. So he doesn’t try to move or help– he just lays there and lets Steve move him, lets Steve wipe his chest and face clean with a damp cloth from somewhere, lets Steve pet his hair and press soothing kisses against Tony’s brow.
“You’re fucking beautiful, my gorgeous golden boy,” Tony growls, hitting harder, and Steve gets through his orgasm without passing out. His cock is still hard, though, and Tony is still hitting him with the crop, and Steve is still crying and yelling and begging.
Steve reaches up with one hand, across Tony’s body and back, to loosen the cuffs so Tony can pull his hands free. He goes to roll over, and Steve stops him with a hand pressed to the dip of his spine.
“Sorry!” he blurts, closing his eyes and tilting his head back. “God, sorry, that was –”
“How are you feeling, love?” Steve asks eventually, his fingers dancing slow circles over Tony’s hip bone.
“Do you know what this is?” he asks. Steve shakes his head.
“What are you talking about, Steve?”
“Mass? Like, Church?”
“Pants off,” Tony murmurs against his lips. “Pants off would be better.”
the mission.”
Steve’s whole body shudders, and he swallows audibly, dropping his head between his shoulders to hang toward the bed. “Tony,” he says, helplessly around an edge of humiliation. But his cock is hard, leaking, and his voice is also full of want. Tony will have to remember that.
," Steve says, torn between jumping on the bed so he can jump Tony, and laughing at the absurdity of it all – that Tony had really spent the better part of his day sending Steve risque photos, text messages, and phone calls.
“Yes, yes, yes,” Steve chants, interrupting him, and then Tony is crying out, grinding his hips up, and Steve is slicker inside, hot and wet and full.
The process to get an appointment had been arduous. He’d been through three rounds of health screenings, two psych evals, and countless intake forms. He’d answered surveys and questionnaires about his preferences, proclivities, past sexual history and hard limits.
“Tony, come on –”
“Who’s the sub?” Tony asks. “One of your people?”
Tony is standing right where Steve left him, arms crossed as he watches. "Are you finished?" He manages to sound just slightly impatient, as though Steve had taken an inordinate amount of time to undress and get on the bed. It makes warmth curl in Steve's belly.
He thrusts the dildo in, fast and hard, and reaches for the lube beside him. Steve cries out in rhythm with the toy, his prostate probably so sensitive it’s right on the edge of pain, and he moans when Tony pours lube over the place where his rim is stretched around the silicone. Tony drops the bottle and rubs his fingers over the skin, letting the dildo push some of the slick inside, and then he pushes up on his knees, bringing his cock close to that filled hole. He tips the base of the dildo up and presses the head of his erection against the rim as Steve gasps.
"Next time you'd better answer your phone, though," Tony warns, chuckling.
He flops onto the bed beside Tony, reaches over the side of the bed and snags his T-shirt, using it to wipe his own come off Tony’s chest and belly.
Steve’s in the workshop. That’s been happening more and more, lately. Tony’s not an idiot, though. He’s not going to rush it. But Steve wouldn’t
"You know," Tony says, the words drawn out in a way that makes it sound like he's trying to pretend – poorly – that he's only just thought of his next words. "You're awfully mouthy for a guy who's at my mercy."
Tony works his way into SHIELD quickly. A few more forged pieces of paper and one particularly memorable phone call where Steve pretended to be a former employer later, and they couldn’t help but hire him. Steve gets work with a construction company, and he’s faster and able to lift more than any other guy on the crew, so he works his way up pretty fast.
Steve’s throat is dry and he can hear it clicking when he tries to swallow. He’s hard as a rock in his scrub pants, and Mr. Stark’s skin is like fire under his palms.
“Yeah,” Tony says, glancing around guiltily. The small waiting room is empty, but he’s still paranoid. “Tony Stark.”
Tony can understand why. Typically, pain play does nothing for him – it’s more of a turn off than anything else. It’s one of the many reasons he has so much trouble finding a dom. But there’s something about Clint’s posture, the way he’s looking at Natasha as though she holds all the mysteries of the universe, that he finds compelling. He has never in his entire life seen someone so deeply into subspace, and so perfectly content to be there.
Tony moans, his hips shifting, and Steve shivers with pride at the knowledge that he’s responsible for the reaction.
Tony starts a gentle rhythm, thrusting deep into Steve’s body with each slow thrust. Steve sighs in pleasure, cock swinging hard and full under his belly. Each thrust slides Tony’s cock over his prostate, and Tony keeps leaning forward to pepper kisses across Steve’s back, his hands sliding over Steve’s hips and waist.
Coulson leads him past several unmarked closed doors. They all look identical, so Tony doesn’t really know how Coulson decides which one to open. It opens into an empty, richly furnished room. Inside the room are several benches and bondage stands, a large bed, and an assortment of whips and floggers and paddles. Tony turns to look at Coulson, then back into the room.
+++++
,” he whines, almost losing his balance as he tries to get his mouth on Tony’s dick again.
His opportunity to broach the subject of his feelings – and Tony’s avoidance of them – comes as a surprise.
Tony gives him a look.
“I think we can make it work,” he says. “I’m very resourceful.”
Steve laughs into his mouth, then pulls back and gets up onto his knees, straddling one of Tony’s thighs. He pulls his shirt up over his head, tossing it off the bed, and Tony grins up at him. “Nice,” he says.
He comes back with a bottle of lubricant, a smallish glass dildo, and a cloth bag Tony can’t see into.
Tony whines again, pulling against the rope. Steve flips to a new page in his sketchbook and starts drawing again, head tilted to the side as he examines Tony’s body. Tony shivers a little; being on display like this, like a fucking fruit bowl Steve is trying to draw, is pulling at the thread of desire low in his belly. He
he’s going to come, hard and hot and sudden, but then Tony is pulling off him, pulling away, and Steve’s head surges up, trying to get back to that sweet, tight hole, trying to taste Tony again.
+++++
Stark will keep his eyes closed because he can’t imagine a world where he isn’t blushing furiously and obvious in his arousal. He lifts the towel, averting his gaze, as he entreats Stark to turn over onto his back so that Steve can work on the front of his legs, as well as his neck and shoulders and pecs.
"That's right, honey," Tony croons, standing behind Steve and placing a hand between his shoulder blades. He pushes gently, guiding Steve toward the bed. "Now, take off your clothes and lie down. And don't keep me waiting any longer than I already have, hm?"
life studies in that book by the end of the night.
Steve keeps sucking, bobbing his head in a smooth rhythm, working on taking more and more of Tony into his throat. He gets a little bit more down each time, and he’s almost at the base when Tony pulls back, breathing hard and shaking. His cock is wet, glistening with Steve’s saliva and his own pre-come, and Steve can’t help it, he leans forward, chasing after it, because he wants it back, wants it in his mouth, wants to keep pulling those pleasure noises out of Tony.
of massage therapist.”
Steve thinks about it. He would like to keep sucking Tony off, but he wants to be in the bed even more. Wants to have Tony over him, looking down at him with smouldering eyes.
“Green,” Steve says.
Steve groans, nods his head drunkenly.
“Want me to lick my come out of you, first?” Steve asks, still with that same soft, gentle tone.
+++++
Tony is so hard he could
“I asked Jarvis what your favourite dessert was,” Steve admits when he pulls out a couple of dough balls wrapped in plastic from the fridge. “I started the dough a couple of days ago.”
“Team Holiday Dinner is scheduled for 4:30 pm today,” Jarvis betrays him from the ceiling.
He nods fitfully, feeling his cheeks flame.
“Hmm?” Tony asks around the soldering iron in his mouth. Not the safest place to store it, but he only needs both hands for a second.
Steve moves down the table, picks up Tony’s right foot and begins massaging it, thumbs pressing into the muscles at the sole. Tony lets out a choked noise, but Steve doesn’t stop, working his way to the ankle, up Tony’s calf, then his hamstring. His fingers are sure, warm, digging into muscles until they start to relax under his hands.
Tony doesn’t say anything, because he’s not sure where Steve’s going with this.
“Eight?” Steve prompts him, his voice soothing and encouraging.
Tony whines, tensing his core to try and tilt his hips, hoping he can maybe bend enough at the waist to rub the head of his cock across the sheer fabric of the chemise floating over his belly. But he can’t move enough — Steve is nothing if not particularly skilled at rope play. Tony is completely immobile, suspended several feet in the air. He desperately tries to move, to try and get some friction on his cock, but he can’t get the leverage. Not that it would matter that much — Steve had made sure to put a cock ring on him before they’d even started that evening.
Tony tilts his head, and sure enough, Steve’s cock is hard. God, he loves this man.
if he’d intended to break up with him, right? He leads Steve into the penthouse suite, through the kitchen to the living room. He grabs a couple of fancy microbrew beers Rhodey had brought him on the way and they sit down together on the couch.
He pulls back from the kiss, panting a little himself, and looks into Steve’s glazed, lust-addled eyes. He’s so deep now, floating, but Tony wants to take him further, drag him down until he can’t remember his own name – only Tony’s, and that he belongs to Tony.
Tony does, resting his face in the opening. Steve moves over beside him, and Tony hears the lube bottle opening with a dull sound, then cool liquid is being poured into the crease of his ass, still wet and slick from Steve’s mouth.
After a moment, Steve turns the phone over and looks at the picture again.
The meeting starts as they all do – with a brief summary of the last few weeks' worth of SHIELD business. They touch on some Avengers missions, but Fury does what he can to keep the WSC out of Avengers business. Steve's only here because of his unique position as the leader of the Avengers and his position in the SHIELD Strike Team ranks.
. He moans and pushes the dildo in, in, in, then reluctantly pulls away from his own cock. It feels too good, and the view of watching Steve’s hole stretch around the large dildo is almost too much. Steve can – and will need to – come multiple times, but Tony’s only got one or two in him, and if he makes it to two, he’ll need time in between. He’s not as young as he used to be.
Tony cuts off the proclamation by bringing the crop down hard and fast on Steve’s ass, already a deep cherry red from his work with the paddle and the flogger, and Steve screams, whole body spasming, cock throbbing, so Tony does it again and again, leaving new marks, crisscrossing his way up Steve’s beautiful ass, down the backs of his thighs, up to his lower back, until Steve is letting out a low, continuous moan, jerking helplessly against his bonds.
“Tony,” he moans, leaning back and arching, hands moving back to brace on Tony’s thighs as he rocks and grinds, using Tony’s cock and the dildo to stimulate his own prostate. It’s so hot, Tony wants to watch him do it forever.
his mouth, big hands wrapped around Tony’s waist and fingers digging into his flesh. Steve’s whole body is pressed up against his, and Tony can already feel the thick, solid erection under Steve’s jeans.
+++++
“Do you want me to make you come?” Steve rumbles, and Stark gasps before he answers.
“I think he’s getting close,” Tony says one night over dinner. It’s soup, because Steve still hasn’t learned to cook much, but they’re both tired of meatloaf.
Steve reluctantly relinquishes his grip on Stark’s cock and pulls his fingers free, then steps around the massage table to the end table. He opens the top drawer, gratified to immediately find a box of Trojans. They’re a little on the small side for him, usually, but he can make do. He tears open the box, pulls out a foil packet, and steps back to the table.

Steve watches him take more of the vaseline and spread it over his cock in a few quick strokes, then Tony moves up onto his knees and crawls behind Steve, getting up on his knees and sliding his cock back and forth between Steve’s cheeks.
“Why silver?” He asks the question even as he pulls it over his face, obscuring his features. He can see fine, and his mouth and nose are clear. He wonders if the mask has any hope of keeping his identity a secret, what with his fairly recognizable facial hair.
“Mm,” Tony sighs, snuggling deeper into Steve’s arms happily. “Yeah,” he says. “Bath’d be nice.”
“It was a marvel of engineering and science,” Tony says, aghast.
anymore, and Rhodey helps Tony save the President. Tony asks for Banner’s help to solve Extremis – he could do it himself, but it’s Pepper’s life on the line so he’s not fucking with that. Then Tony has the arc reactor removed and his heart surgically repaired. His beautiful Malibu house is destroyed, so he heads back to New York.
Steve imagines it. Some silly little lingerie, something made for a girl, and he'd be so big in it. It would stretch across his muscles and his shoulders and his chest, and it would be obscene.
+++++
The only thing Tony can move is his head, which he does. He bends it just enough to look back over his shoulder, past where his legs are tied spread open, ankles bound to his thighs. Steve is still sitting in his chair behind Tony, seemingly uninterested in the sight before him. He’s sketching, though, and Tony knows there will be some
Steve laughs a little, leaning in close for another kiss, which, of course, Tony gives him. “I dunno. I like watching you blush like that.”

The response comes back from Tony almost immediately.
Bruce falls asleep, the bastard, but at least Tony still feels like he got it all off his chest. He even sleeps half that night.
Most Subs get what they need through pain play, through rough play, through… things Tony doesn’t get what he needs from. No, what Tony needs, what Tony gets off on, is the true submission of the acts. Most Subs need the pain, need to give in to it to get anywhere near subspace, but Tony can’t get there that way. Well, he can get partway down, but it’s awful, and the drop is intense. But when he has what he’s had with Steve tonight, that soft submission, that ability to give
“The way you take care of me…”
“Please, please,” Steve keens, leaning back and supporting himself with his hands on Tony’s thighs. He thrusts down over and over, whole body shaking as Tony’s cock hits his prostate, as Tony’s hand strokes his cock.
“But you don’t know when.”
Steve pulls away completely, moving off Tony and tucking his underwear back into place before sitting back, on the far end of the couch.
Steve swallows hard, then nods, because
In answer, Tony lifts one hand and snaps his fingers twice. “Good,” Steve says. “Do you have any questions for me before we begin?”
“Because, to me,” Steve says, holding Tony’s gaze steady, “this is a relationship. This is you and me, together, in a relationship.”
+++++
He holds Tony’s cock steady at the base, shifts his hips and then he slides down onto Tony’s cock in one slick slide.
Tony reaches over for a package of wet wipes from the night stand, uses one to quickly wipe the come off Steve's belly. He can't reach Steve's hole to clean him there, but Steve doesn't mind. He likes having Tony's come in him for a little while.
When the SHIELD employee contingent of the Avengers comes back, they’re a little beat up. Natasha has a big old shiner, and Clint is limping, but Steve looks none the worse for wear. He’s quiet, though, heading straight up to his rooms without much more than an absent wave.
“She’s very good,” Tony says, wondering if she’s the one he’s supposed to have an appointment with. He’d put on his intake form that he didn’t like pain play, and that he wasn’t particular about gender, but maybe Natasha had other talents. Tony imagines she could put nearly any sub deeply into subspace, no matter their preferences.
He hides in the workshop for a couple of days, rebuilding the suits that had been destroyed in that whole Killian mess. He hasn’t showered, and has been licking his wounds fueled only by coffee and spite, when Rogers comes down to the shop with a paper bag full of cheeseburgers.
“Shit, Steve,” Tony mutters, breaking his mouth away on a gasp. “What’s happening?”
When it’s over, Steve’s whole body relaxes, and with a deep groan, Tony pushes forward and slides in all the way, into that welcoming, warm, slickness.
Steve’s come is cool on his cheek. It’s mostly dripped off, but Tony can still feel where it had hit his face, hot and wet and sticky. Tony feels another dribble of saliva slide over his bottom lip and down his chin, feels it hit the lace of his chemise and cool the skin of his chest almost instantly.
“Come on, Tony,” Steve grits out, hips thrusting down hard and fast. “Fill me up.”
Tony pulls out carefully, gently lifting Steve's leg off his shoulder and placing it on the bed. He crawls up beside Steve's heaving body, still wracked with the odd twitch, and unlatches the cuffs on his wrists, then carefully pulls the ruined panties from Steve's mouth and presses a hot, wet kiss there.
Steve can't help but jerk away, laughing.
sound suspicious after a while,” Steve agrees. “So, how’s it work?”
“Alright,” Steve says, taking a step back. “Can you please state your safeword?”
"How many times you wanna come tonight, honey?" Tony asks, then. "You want me to make you come now, and then fuck you when you're sensitive, when it hurts, until you come again?"
Steve slams the phone face-down on the table too hard, interrupting Councilman Yen's diatribe about international waters and whether SHIELD has a place in them. Everyone stops and turns to look at him.
Steve takes a deep breath in, then nods, looking only slightly less miserable. Tony tries to push down the uneasy feeling – Steve wouldn’t have kissed him like
Steve responds with a quiet groan low in his throat, and then the floodgates are open. Steve crowds him against the wall of the elevator and

Tony blinks, looking slightly taken aback. “Did you want me to sleep with you? I mean,
“Turns out no one wants to argue with that look,” Clint shrugs. “So, Tomasson won’t be flying any missions with Cap.”
“It’s very early in the morning,” Steve says, voice measured. “And I sort of had most of my brain cells fucked out of me last night, so I’m going to need you to be very, very clear about what you’re trying to say to me right now.”
Tony's voice says, sounding strained and filthy.
“I’m okay,” Tony says, and his voice comes out rough and slurring. The sound of it brings him back up a step from his subspace, brings him to slightly more awareness, but Steve pressing his other wrist down and cuffing it to the table’s attachment helps him slip back down.
“After?” Tony raises a cheeky eyebrow, leaning back to give Steve that same cocky, mischievous grin that Steve had wanted to kiss away earlier. He gives in to the urge, gives Tony another fast, heated kiss.
A low rumbling chuckle from Steve, sweet and doting. “I was surprised when they gave it to me, too,” he says softly. “You must be – I mean, not all our clients are treated to chocolate.”
“The look on your face
“Tony.”
"Sorry 'm so useless after I come," Steve mumbles, limbs and eyelids heavy.
“Why not?” Tony asks, words clearer now. He shifts a little, managing to sit himself up a few more centimeters all on his own.
It’s over in an instant. Tony looks away, eyes down on the floor, his whole body tensing, and Steve realizes this had been another moment. Not just a
Steve can't help it – he throws his head back and howls, cheeks heating when the sound is still muffled by the panties. Tony instantly sets a quick rhythm. He pushes all the way in until his hips are pressed tight against Steve's ass, and then he pulls back almost all the way, until just the head is still inside Steve, stretching his rim wide around it. Then he pushes in again, thrusting forward and evenly paced.
Steve bites his lip to stop the grin. He's about to send back a cheeky reply when another photo comes through.
But Steve could see
For the umpteenth time since the conversation started, Tony wished he could see the guy's face. Parking by the roadside and turning the lights off in order to make a phone call might not have been his brightest idea. The lights did make his headache worse, though.
So formal, so precise.
he realized.
"Huh," Tony said and gave him a quizzical look.
Steve throws a snowball at him. Tony ducks.
“Yeah, you’re having a panic attack from it, so I’d characterize it as not so great.”
"Unlike you, I used to love Christmas," Steve began. "I mean, we were... we weren't rich, but my mom would always make it special, and then, later, when she..." He took another deep breath, apparently ordered his thoughts better. "She died young, so that was that. But later I'd celebrate with friends, and it was also fine, in a different way." This was the most he'd said about himself so far, Tony realized. And it was very... unspecific, but Tony could see how difficult it was for him to string word after word, and he knew it was important, that Steve was sharing this. "But...", Steve went on, reluctantly, resolutely. Stopped. Tried again. "Well, I mentioned about the army, and now, after all this time, it's just..."
The ship had no surveillance systems. The ship had no normal comms. No network. All of that had been removed during the refurbishment. As the war had shown, the Cylons – intelligent machines that they were – could infiltrate those systems. They acted as a super-virus, and no firewalls helped. The human race was now forced to use old, outdated equipment, immune to the enemy infection.
Steve’s voice seemed to have recovered some of it usual dryness. “And for all of your not-caring, you made us drink those disgusting chlorophyll smoothies.”
Then, a few minutes later: "During the war," Steve began, "it would get really cold in winter, and people would huddle together, for warmth."
Tony was saying, "It's okay to still grieve. Both for Nat and... him. And everything.
"Do you want my socks?" Steve whispered, which was when Tony realized he'd started drifting away on the waves of cozy warmth. He made himself blink a few times to shake off sleep.
effect?"
Tony: Are you fucking quoting fucking Lawrence Oates at me?
, although he knew he couldn't be that impolite to anyone, not even in the privacy of his head.
There was an itch of wanting in his palm, and if he didn't touch Steve he would go crazy. What was it with touching his chest and retracting, anyway? What was that about? He reached out and, never looking down, pretending nothing was happening, took a hold of Steve's hand. Steve sucked in half a breath, but still just stood there, motionless.
Tony tries to stare him down. This produces no results whatsoever.
“Look at me.” Tony's brown eyes snapped to her own. “We are going to find him," she enunciated very clearly. "Even if it takes us ten years, we are going to find him. There is not one place on this earth someone could hide him that we won't find. I refuse for any of us to lose any more family members. I'm not going through that again.” She narrowed her eyes. “Do you understand me?”
Nebula cuts him off. "No."
Later that night, their legs happily entangled together, Steve asks another question, even though Tony thought they were on the same page.
He wanted children. I could go one way or another with that, but I was always supportive. We did talk about adoption many times, but in the end we never did it. Still, it was a charmed life. We did a lot of things in those years, despite the fact we'd decided we'd done enough and we were going to just kick back and enjoy. We did retire from the Avengers. We came out of the retirement when we were needed, and Tony restored his Steve's shield for me, for that occasion. It made me feel like my old self, and I both liked it and didn't. Then, a bit later, we retired again. We did rebuild the compound. We also trained and raised at least two full generations of new Avengers. We moved house a few times. We even lived in the cottage by the lake for a decade and a half; Tony had always wanted to, and I thought it was sweet, that he still had those ideas of idyllic life. Me, I loved every place we lived together; in the end, it was as simple as that.
, and he was
And then, when Steve least expects it, Tony shifts the angle again, and curls his finger slightly, and it's there, right
, flickered through his mind, uninvited.)
And there was a pang of regret again, at all the hurry, all the frantic grabbing and biting and digging nails into skin. He straightened, pulled out. Wondered why he didn't think to steal some tissues while he was about stealing lube. Pack it in, he told himself. Pack it in, and cut your heart out, and just walk away. Else, you fall apart. But he couldn't resist the one last look. Steve still hadn't moved, he just stood there, hands against the wall, breathing and dripping. The curve of his back was so near and somehow sad. And – just one last touch then, Tony thought, as he let his hand caress him softly, all the way up the spine, lingering, stroking with his thumb, softly, slowly. And he thought
He spotted Sharon in the crowd, and all of a sudden talking to her sounded like the best of all possible ideas that floated around the universe, yet unclaimed.
I decided to shut up for a bit, for both our sakes.
"How come we're not talking about the fact you promptly sent Thor and me away so that you could risk your pretty neck all by yourself, oh, crap, this is inappropriate, isn't it, I went too far with this, didn't I?" he finished, failing to smile.
"I think he probably did his very best to hide it," I said gently.
Tony shrugged. "She just rolled her eyes and said,
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony: And here I thought you were falling for me only now.
"Tony," the guy said simply after Steve introduced himself.
The whole stupid mess of edible stuffs  probably seemed excessive to Steve. Hell, he was a person who was going to volunteer in a soup kitchen on Christmas Eve. To his eyes  and to his 40's sensibilities, having this much food must appear wasteful. He was probably right about that, too, but that question hadn't been the foremost on Tony's mind; all he'd wanted to do was to make a lot of fun things for Morgan.
Tony: Gotta uphold my reputation of your favorite mad scientist.
And for all of Tony's posturing, the moment the tent flap closed behind them, he was upon Steve. He tore off his own helmet and tossed it aside, and then his lips were on Steve's, softly insistent, almost pleading. "Good god, Steve, I missed you so much," he whispered, kissing Steve's mouth, his face, his eyes. "I missed you so much, you stupid idiot."
Steve had said, and he'd sounded uptight, he knew that. Just like he did when he said something he felt
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Tony said lightly. The corresponding swirl of warmth in his chest was... worrisome. And nice. He picked nice for now. He could at least have this one day before everything went to shit, like it probably would; memorize like crazy and stick everything into his mental photo album. This day, this glade, this smiling Steve and the silent companionship of trees as the two of them wound their way in between.
Did he really say what Steve thought he did? Because there, in the darkness of the coatroom, with the residue of the caresses still burning on Steve's skin, it had looked more and more like he had, like that was exactly what Tony meant. And Steve had sunk to the floor and hugged his knees and remembered Tony's careful touches as well as his demanding mouth, and how, during sex, he had kept whispering to Steve:
"For as long as you want to," Steve said firmly. "Let's go back to my pavilion and try to talk about all of it one more time."
Billy D. was, it turned out – after Steve peeled the layers of woolens off of her – fourteen or fifteen; a problem kid from the next town. By the number of times she said
Steve doesn't nod. He doesn't need to.
It was late in the afternoon, and dark already.  When Tony heard the knocking on the door, in the middle of the fucking Alps, he knew well who it was. After all, he had invited him over. He checked his stupid tablet for reception once again, but no use. Sneezed. Blew his nose one more time, but it was futile, really, because he apparently had a nice snot industry going there; there was no stopping the machinery once it was, quite literally, running. He walked to the door, opened it.
Tony huffed and deflated. "Nothing. Nothing. Sorry about that. I shouldn't have said anything. You know I can't fucking shut up. Ignore me."
He glares daggers at Steve; elbows him in the side, as inconspicuously as he can, because it wouldn't do to make a scene now, not in the super full hotel lobby. Steve
Tony: What, you scared?
could have ever happened. But he was..." He falters. "You've no idea how important he was to me."
Tony: Okay.
Tony: How was it?
But of course nothing can go smoothly. They get discovered and the ensuing shooting is quite an unwelcome addition to the evening. Tony is wearing a custom made bulletproof vest of his own design, so he's okay. What Steve has on under his civvies, however, is a  commercial brand piece of body armor. At finding out about this, paralyzing fear cuts right through Tony, leaving him cold; because, when push comes to shove, it's not a brand he'd trust with Steve's life.
Tony: He said to tell you to tell Sam he said hi.
"Stark!" Fury barked, and it took Tony some effort not to try and stand a little straighter. "Why the hell did it take you this long to make contact? We thought you were dead!"
Tony had about a dozen possible replies to that, one snarkier than the next, but in the end he just sighed and muttered "Oh, who cares", inconsequentially, and dug himself deeper into his blankets. (The dust made him sneeze again. He should have taken the cleaner ones from the bedroom, but he'd wanted the old things from the upper floor with the red and brown pattern he remembered from his early childhood.)
"Yeah," Steve said quietly. "Sucks."
Well, maybe somewhere on the way to that, at one point, but that was long gone now. An unsuccessful experiment.
“Sometimes that’s the same thing as afraid.” Tony shrugged. “And then I got it under control.”
Tony: No, are you crazy?
For Steve, it had almost been easier while he thought Tony was never going to forgive him. Well, no, that wasn't true, but it was like a tiny black hole taking a permanent residence inside your chest, and it loved the neighborhood, it never planned to move away, and in the end you somehow made your peace with it. (Black holes don't exactly hurt, they just swallow everything else.) And then, after a few missions together, after they finally talked... Well, after that, it was just a little bit unbearable, like wanting to explode and implode at the same time, the joy and the sheer
"Oh," is his very intelligent response. And, "Really?"
Tony rolled his eyes. "I say fuck off," he snapped and shoved his way past. In the sudden silence, his words seemed to echo. It was as if everyone had gone silent right then, and the whole landing bay was staring at them. Hammer's neck blushed bright red as he pretended to laugh it off.
Steve didn't look addled by the painkillers any longer, though. He had shaken off the effects in a record time, then; he must have an amazing metabolism. Either that or Tony had stayed in the landing bay longer than he thought. There had been a lot of people milling around, wanting to talk to him, asking about the damage, congratulating him. He'd felt almost as if he was attending one of his galas, back home. He wore his protection suit as if it were a three-piece, and he schmoozed with the smudgy and the bandaged. He smiled as if he was selling something, because that was what his lips did when he was thinking of other things. And all the while his eyes kept wandering away, looking for a blond head of hair and a pair of broad shoulders. He couldn't help it.
But there was the treacherous part of him that wondered
figure it out in the end, by which time it was almost too late. We changed the plan on the fly. And besides, who can tell what the best course of action is in those circumstances. What were we supposed to do? Give up on public protection, let the Hydra assholes lay destruction on the city and deal with this? Or let superserum go, and do damage control. We tried to do both. And it was a partial success. We controlled the damage in part. A lot of damage was still caused. People were hurt. We caused some too. We tried to save as many people as possible. We did capture the serum, but we cannot be sure it was all there was of it. We're not even sure it's the working serum; it's been around before, a few times that I know of – another thing I shouldn't be releasing to the public, I guess. These serums never really worked exactly the way they were supposed to, but they tend to cause havoc either way.
He had to keep his head. He forced himself to think.
But, in all fairness, Steve shouldn't have brought him along. Perhaps it would have been smarter to form a rescue team, contact the bridge somehow, call the marines in. Do everything by the book. But in the meantime, anything at all could have happened here. He'd worked with what he had at hand instead – a competent engineer; by a mad stroke of luck, someone who could actually take care of the situation with the engines.
, he didn't say, but Tony heard it. "I don't really like myself when I'm like that. And it's got nothing to do with reason, really."
"Too chaste?" Steve's voice, its hoarseness, sent a shiver down Tony's spine. And he nodded.
," Tony says with some ferocity. "

... again, what? He let go of Steve.
"What?" Steve echoed, and – yes, it was a prone human form on the floor. Moving the fire extinguisher to his left hand, he hauled the person up over his right shoulder and started back towards Darryl's group at a run. The air, at least, was more or less breathable near the entrance corridor; maybe they had spare oxygen masks too. He remembered seeing first aid kits somewhere. Maybe there was still hope. No matter how long it seemed, the whole thing – since he arrived on deck with Tony and Thor – had lasted perhaps twenty minutes.
I'd expected I'd be all quivery when I started talking to him, but he was the one that looked shaken. My focus seemed to have returned to me after
Tony: Steve, when I lash out at you like I did on Monday, which I promised not to do, but I still do it
, the surviving civilian cruiser. It seemed like the luckiest luck of all the lucks imaginable in this universe and any other. Then there was Fury, and Tony'd been overjoyed to see him. He'd been happy to see even Hammer at first, although he was quickly cured of that. Nevertheless, he couldn't believe his transgressions from twenty years ago were still going to haunt him.
Tony: Screw you.
And he let his lips sink onto Steve’s, a promise, and he let his hands stray into Steve’s hair, touching, caressing, petting tenderly, like he’d wanted to do for a long, long time now.
past his lips.)
" And Tony was pretty sure she muttered something like
, he thinks. It's about playing or not playing the villain's game; or doing it only to the bare minimum. Gaming the system, cutting the wire instead of lying on top of it or stepping on someone who did.
"Are you trying to talk yourself out of it?" Tony interrupted him, a tad sharply.
“Well, two can play at that game,” Tony said, crouching down himself. He imagined he could see Steve’s eyes twinkle back, behind his goggles.
"Oh, god," Rhodey whispered. "To hell with everything." And: "Okay." And then he turned around and shouted: "Carol!" far louder than the distance really warranted.
Steve leafed through the file politely, then let it fall to his lap. He gave his commander a long, steady look and raised his eyebrows. "He's tech department. We need the tech people too." Out of all the objections he might have come up with, this one seemed most practical.
Something else, then, perhaps. Something... fun, or at least not deadly serious, and, most important of all, something that wouldn't require him to have one-on-one talks with Tony because he just tended to put his foot in his mouth with him.
Then he realized he despised himself with every ounce of his being for doing that, so he deliberately let the stupid thing slide to the floor.
, Tony thinks, absolutely refusing to be disappointed because that would be ridiculous.
"If you're well enough to banter, you're well enough to drink tea," Tony decided, semi-grateful for an excuse to get out from under the blanket, now that Steve didn't need his body hit so desperately anymore. He scrambled out. "Friday," he snapped while he grabbed his bathrobe that was draped over the back of a nearby chair. "Scan his life functions again."
He heard a weak  cough through the wall, a soft curse. Batted at the quiet dread that had been buzzing around him like a fly (Steve had been trying to ignore it). Waves upon waves of what-ifs. Because, because... it wasn't impossible, was it, that this was something worse than a common cold, and they were in the mountains, and it was snowing, and there was no cell signal (Steve had checked), and what if what if what if...
Tony: I do. And also, they are mine now. I expect the original as soon as it's safe to use the post again.
, and that would be just too ridiculous.
Tony: Trust me, you won't.
On the up side (or should that be down side?), Steve's arm is still firmly around him.
Tony: Oh, forget I said that, will you.
"No, but you should," Tony whispered back. "It's not a good time and all those clichés." He wasn't moving away. Neither, for that matter, was Steve.
Tony's grin was self-deprecating, ironic; so brittle it would break into shards at a wrong word, a wrong breath. It didn't put a stop to the spreading of warm happiness through my body, but it did warn me to thread carefully. I just looked at him, trying to let him know how I felt.
They avoided each other's eyes. Sheepishness was so thick in the air it was making it impossible to breathe.
What can I say, I have a type.
"A steady gun hand is always useful," Tony said. "But Steve – if you are worried about..."
I didn't think you'd..." He flailed for a way to go on, but the words were deserting one by one, leaving him naked and alone. He tried again. "But now I thought you'd maybe..." He blew out a frustrated breath. "Whatever you want is fine," he finished lamely.
He wasn't exactly looking back at me. "I had them made after our first night,," he said as if it was the greatest joke in the world, which only meant it was extremely important to him and not to be treated as anything funny in the least, at any time, ever. "Talk about rash, huh?"
Was it possible, though? Was it possible that to a smart, brilliant, world-weary Tony he hadn't been just a friend, and hadn't been just a potential lay, but something else; could a whole really be greater than the sum of its parts?
"Noooo," Peter was shaking his head. "Here, let me show you." He dug out something from his pocket and –
Somewhere out there, anything could be true; was true. That was the scary part.
even glanced in Cap's direction. He wanted to lull the prey into complacency. Then he would pounce.
He looks up sharply at that, and then suddenly he's at my side. "Darling, no," he says, and he sounds distressed, and also he's never ever called me anything but Steve or Cap or Big Man before. "That's not what I meant at all."
It slowly stops being fun, tormenting Steve. In the cab from the airport, they both sit in the back, but as far from each other as humanly possibly. This is by mutual tacit agreement. For the first time in hours, Tony's hands aren't on Steve for one annoying reason or another, and it's suddenly weird.
"Walk." Natasha's voice jerked him from his reverie. "The feet. Move them." Her hand on his shoulder was gentle, almost butterfly-light, but her voice was, by contrast, quiet and sharp. They had arrived together, super early (Steve had insisted), but Natasha had been fluttering at the margins of his world since, chatting and mingling, apparently familiar with just about everyone. Her act was pure art. Steve already missed the real Natasha, but he also envied her a bit. He himself had mostly limited himself to tight smiles and nods and oh-so-firm handshakes. The more the hall filled, the more uncomfortable he was becoming.
Tony: Look, things happened. Ross has me followed. Everything around here is tapped, except for the important and not-so-obvious communication methods (I mean, don't worry, everything's scrambled, my infosec is state of the art). I made Rhodey go to a French spa so that he wouldn't have to be a part of this. He's going to be majorly pissed when he finds out what's going on.

Toy didn't mind the question. What he hadn't wanted to do was go on and on about his feelings on the matter, his loneliness. He didn't want to hog either the conversation or his own thoughts. He'd wanted to stay in the here and now, with Steve. But, weirdly enough, right now, it didn't seem like Steve was asking him to ruminate on the divorce itself. It seemed like Steve was honest to god checking if he was available.
"What's going on with you anyway?" Tony muttered, after shaking an offered, unidentified hand and trading a pair of fake smiles with someone or other.
Tony: I'm always overtly kind, you ass. Everyone knows that. It's just that you are learning to decode me only now.
"You don't get to cut either of us open and play around; concentrate."

was solid; a solid,
"Come with me. C'mon, c'mon. We're going for a run."
Tony: What's going on, I mean.
Tony: I'd just made the first predecessor of Dummy's, and I was about to test him.
I don't move.
The impulse to reach out and touch his hair, smooth out the wrinkles on his forehead wasn’t sudden. It crept up on Tony softly, like snowfall; he was pretty much grateful to fate both his hands were safely under the blankets before the impulse grew too strong.
here is convey the absolutely necessary minimum of knowledge in the best possible way. And I've got a feeling Stark can do that better than I can, at least when it comes to science and engineering. So let him do that. I don't care about anything else. I'm no good at classroom psychology. Only at leading people in battle."
"Oh, it's valid," he says. "It's just that I don't care." He pauses. Is it weird that he wants to go and discuss the 2012 with Natasha in detail now? It must be the booze talking.
"Do you really need an invitation? To come to your own HQ and see your friends?"
"Whoa. Thank you. That means
"Leave the mick on, okay? Maybe I can hear the snippets here and there. I know you don't have time to..."
Tony: I'm not really hiding. I just... needed a few moments of not looking at anyone's stupid face. A breather. Christ, I hate people sometimes.
Tony: Do you have any idea how big this corporation is? How many important projects there are? How many fucking employees? How many workplace accidents? How many health benefit plans? Do you have any idea what you are talking about like at all?
He goes back to caressing and lightly tapping Steve's right breast with the tresses, and then, just when Steve had stopped expecting it, he flicks the flogger at his left nipple again, sharply. Once again, the excitement rushes into Steve's cock, like a wave that can't quite reach the shore, and falls short, and Steve growls. So unfulfilled. He's on the verge of tearing the silk ribbon apart, grabbing his cock and giving it a stroke that it needs, two at most. He'd be done. He just need a slightest touch, anything to tip him over the edge.
Absently, Steve noticed Sharon had slipped off. He saw the back of her head bowing forward, whispering something in Natasha's ear, but he couldn't think about that now. He'll apologize later if he'd been rude...
Just that. Just the one word, just his name. Steve longs to say it, longs to have
careful," the blond tells him, arching his eyebrows, but he obediently raises the arms above his head. Tony passes the ribbon through a hoop hanging from the ceiling and ties it off.
That Steve did it at all only attested to the fact that serious weariness was setting in. He just compressed his lips and supported Tony up the stairs, a step by laborious step. Every time Tony put weight on his foot a spike of sharp, hot pain that set his teeth on edge shot through him, but he didn't think Steve was okay enough to carry him either.
"Oh, you
," he said dryly. And, just in case she didn't catch the sarcasm, which she surely did: "From my
"Every person down there, drop your guns!" Like in a dream, the bodiless voice echoed through the town, and as Tony turned his head, he saw the ship – a firefly class transporter – come into view from behind a stone formation outside the town like a second sun, big and malevolent and utterly beautiful. "Get down on your knees, put your hands behind your head,
I didn't have it in me, right then, to grin back and say 'never say never' or to make some other attempt at quippiness. But I did do my best to smile at him. "So, to answer your question," I went on, "as I said, I loved him." For some reason, my own words gave me strength. Or, if not strength, then at least some kind of emotional insubordination that doubles as strength for me. I could take stubborn pride in my own unrealistic feelings.
"Yellow can, like this big, right?"
The flash of disappointment in Steve's face wasn't supposed to hurt so, was it? Was it?
And then Steve's mouth was on his. Tony could feel the warmth of his lips flow into him, turn his guts to nitro. Almost involuntarily, he pressed himself against Steve, and that seemed to be what Steve was waiting for, because in two short steps he was pressing Tony against the cabin wall, with the whole length of his body against Tony's. The intensity of desire nearly made Tony dissociated, as if he'd stepped out of his own head and was watching them both from a short way away, and at the same time he was hyper aware of the pressure of Steve's lips, of his leg pushing between Tony's, his groin against Tony's stomach (because Tony had said not chaste was okay, and Steve was one literal guy, and also didn't tend to waste time). Tony's hands found a way under Steve's shirt, and in contact with his bare skin – the secret skin, the part of skin that wasn't for everyone to see! – they seemed to go crazy. Tony couldn't stop touching him, stroking, petting, squeezing, as Steve kissed and kissed him, pressing him ever tighter against the wooden wall.
Tony's bones are jelly, but he manages to prop himself up on an elbow and look down into Steve's face. He can't really read it, though.
, Steve." On an impulse, Tony reached out and touched Steve's cheek, soft and slightly scrapy. A reassurance Steve was still there, alive and warm, sitting on Tony's couch for real; not some kind of apparition.
The thought surfaced again. But that wasn't what was important right now; that could wait.
Tony: I guess.

Tony inspected Steve's collar. It was similar to the one on the suit he's designed, albeit a little lower. Well, it may have made the world of difference. He resisted the urge to huff. Instead, he asked, "They
"I'm afraid not, boss." Friday rose to the occasion, bless her. "Do you want me to cancel our book club meeting, maybe?"
Carol Danvers was unanimously elected as the new mayor of Timely. Steve had thought Bucky's Natasha was going to be a great help to her, but instead, she marched up to Tony and Steve and said
Tony straddles his legs then; sits. Steve can feel the weight of the suit pinning him down, stretching the muscles of his arms, perpetuating the discomfort that Steve is so hot for, rendering him virtually immobile. He digs it all.
" He smiled again, right at Tony's face, damn the man.
Tony: Nah. Don't think so, at least. Okay. So, I promise to talk to you more in future, if you'll give me something in return, how's that?
He did. And Australia happened two weeks later. The sun was warm, the sand warmer, but Tony’s hand at the small of Steve’s back when he showed Steve how
Treacherously so, a stray thought jittered his mind; why couldn't it ever be this easy with Steve? But that was... just different.
Tony: It didn't go badly. It's me and Rhodey. It'll be all right.
A bit later, we'd unpacked some things and managed to make coffee.
The shake of his head was just a tiny motion, just once. "Stark," he said. "Just don't."
, thought captain Steve Rogers of the battleship ironically renamed
, it was almost what he wanted, and now the sensation is going away.
, judging by his own inner barometer as well as by Cap’s eyes, that looked way too vulnerable for a moment there, then went all glass-apples on him again. Steve looked away, as if trying to get a grip. Then he got up, walked over to a bookshelf. Tony let him. Silence stretched.
The air around them was chill, but the sun was warm on their faces. The wind kept trying and giving up. Still, Tony was mildly irritated that Steve stubborny refused to wear a beanie or at least an earband. They sat side by side, their knees casually touching. How could so much heat radiate through layers upon layers of fabric? No, it must be a weird side effect of the stim shot. They hung between the earth and the sky; sightseeing in a limbo. From their vantage point in the ski lift chair, the landscape unfurling beneath them looked like something Hans Christian Andersen would gladly fuck up with an allegorical tale.
Steve made as if to turn back, round on him, but then he just shook his head and pressed on. "Cut the chatter." He sounded exasperated.
Around 5 p.m. or so something triggered the alarm around the perimeter. He'd set it up to detect large animals and, well, people. The property was private, and while he didn't mind hikers in general, the lake house was enough out of the way that rarely anyone ended up there without intending to; and Tony generally liked to drop by and take a look. So call him overprotective. It was the house where his daughter was supposed to be growing up. 'Simple living' was more Pepper's dream than his, and even though he'd truly come to love some aspects of it, he still missed having, say, an elaborate security system. If a bear started sniffing around the porch where Morgan could be playing, he liked to know about it. This went even more for people.
Trying his best to be calm, purposeful, he made himself walk over to Rhodey and Tony. "What happens next?" he asked them.

"My Tony," she clarified, when I didn't say anything, just stood there. I must have seen like an accomplished conversationalist to her, overall. "He loved all the others too, a lot. But you were... something else. You were deeply important to him. He'd want you to know that."
“I,” he said, his voice going dangerously soft, “thought you could take it.”
"What?" Steve sounded perplexed for a moment there.
"So I saved you?" he said.
"And I," Fury said in a deceptively light voice, "hope you can handle him if he does. Good luck, Rogers."
"Holy fuck, Rogers," Tony mutters to himself as he lubes up his fingers. "
"You're a pretty fast reader," he commented casually, turning back to the book. "I thought I was going to have to wait for you for ages to turn a page, but you're actually not bad at all."
Steve was barely aware of the waitress, even though he replied to her thanks very politely. Thank you, autopilot, you're ever helpful. In the end she even brought them burgers, her treat. They were probably good, they usually were, here. Steve didn't remember the taste at all.
As they enter the quaint, cheep little hotel, Tony inches closer to Steve, very careful not to touch him.
"I'm not so great with authority, you know," Tony felt the urge to explain instead.
Tony: That's not what I was thinking.
He limped and hopped over to his blanket, picked it up to protect his head, his face. Then he went over and stood in the left hand corner by the cell door, where the possible flying debris was least likely to get to him.
"You do realize you playing this for me is just a notch better than if I played Sabbath's
