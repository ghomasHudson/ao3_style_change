If Dean was honest with himself, after it all –saving Cas from the Empty, again – he actually was okay with quiet. With the Bunker being a home base that Sam ran for younger hunters. There was a pretty steady flow in and out of the Bunker these days, and that included just him and Sam doing their thing.
By the time Dean finished this grooming, though, Castiel wanted to do something. He felt like he was about to explode, and neither of them could ignore how hard Cas was, not with how Dean was now kneeling in front of him as he finished the feathers underneath his wing from the front. Castiel was panting a little bit, his eyes following every movement Dean made with an intensity that even he couldn’t deny.
Turning back, he saw the squirrel had moved. Bright green eyes glittering, the little creature was sitting on top of an incense package, one of his favorites, actually, that always relaxed him.
The movie ended and Dean clicked around to find another, there was just something so peaceful about this whole situation that Castiel couldn’t ignore. He found his eyes flicking to the blankets and pillows on the other bed. He felt an urge he hadn’t felt in a long time, the urge to nest.
“Awesome, I’ll see you then. What name should I put down?” Dean’s voice was cheerful, still soothing, and Castiel let a smile play on his lips a moment. He wondered what this man looked like, he should look at the shops website again.
Dean was gentle but powerful when he kissed, and it made Cas want to just melt into him. Cas gasped softly against Dean now, his eyes falling closed properly and his lips parting gently under the touch of Dean’s mouth, a tingle of delight running through him now. He let a soft groan leave his throat as Dean squeezed the back of his neck—not too hard, just enough to exert some control.
It was so easy to get lost in this. Dean took his time, though, both of them were already fairly hard. His mouth moved softly over Cas, exploring the expanse of his shoulders, down to his clavicle. He bit down lightly, not hard enough to mark in any way, but enough to make Cas gasp. His fingers slid back up, the tips brushing over one of his nipples. He shivered under it.
A flicker of movement at the corner of his eye, and then Cas is touching him, hand loosely holding his. It’s not a lot, but it’s enough, and Dean lets his eyelids sink. Thank God Cas figured it out, because he doesn’t think he could have said it.
He’ll forget to speak for a minute, and when he finally finds his tongue, you’ll cut him off, say his name low and charged, and kiss him again. You’ll stroke the words off his tongue then, with yours, and he’ll taste how much you want him.
They look at each other, then Dean looks away, a rueful smile on his face. “Go ahead, man.”
“Thank you,” he says grudgingly. He’ll believe Dean will stop when he sees it. But it’s nice to at least have the promise.
Castiel feels it from the edge of the universe. An explosion, but the stardust doesn’t spread into the blackness to become a nebula, to birth new stars. It just goes, matter into nothing, an unfolding of creation. He catches his breath and prays he can ignore it.
Dean takes in a breath. “I thought,” he says slowly, “I don’t know… I thought there’d be more.”
Dean blinks. “What else would I mean?”
He settles for threatening it. “Sam, I swear to God I will punch your face in.”
Benny’s turn at watch and Dean’s supposed to be sleeping, but he can’t sleep. He twitches and shifts, his eyes open and dart and stare up into the treetops, and Cas watches from a few feet away, concerned. Dean’s the only one of them who needs to sleep. Cas likes to, and he hasn’t been able to for a long time, not when he was alone and had to watch out every moment to keep from being impaled on a leviathan’s fangs. Benny doesn’t sleep so much as stares into space and disconnects from everything.
Dean hears himself answer with Cas’ name. He realizes his hand has traveled from Castiel’s shoulder to his neck, now to his jaw, folding around the curve of it.
“That *hurt*,” he manages as Dean takes in a breath and approaches again.
Staring, round-eyed, Dean tries to pick his jaw up off the floor. “You.. what?” He shakes his head. “I wasn’t– I didn’t. Holy hell,” he says, and there’s a hint of pink in his cheeks, too.
Dean resolves to fall asleep sitting up. It’s the only way to keep himself safe.
A few minutes ago in the story, Sam finally met Castiel. It went pretty much the way Charlie expected it to go, with Sam being a bit fangirly and then ultimately disappointed at the lack of fluffy wings and caring at all about the human race. A few books sans Castiel has cured her of her enchantment with the dynamic between him and Dean. She must have imagined it. Maybe the writer just doesn’t know how to write their relationship well. All that gazing into each other’s eyes could have been just awkward silence, jazzed up for the purpose of gaining readers. He would not be the first author to throw that kind of bait out there.
Castiel drifts in and out of consciousness for a few days. He’s weak, and he doesn’t understand the sensations that are plaguing his body so overtly now that it’s his own and no longer a vessel to contain what he had been. Aches and pains, blood, anxiety, fatigue, all hit him hard, and Dean and Sam keep a close watch on him, help him recuperate.
Castiel smiles. “I look forward to meeting him.”
At times Dean closes his eyes and felt the words wash over him. achingly intimate.
Dean’s missing someone too. His brother, who’s gone away to school. So he and Cas keep each other company, exchange tales of families long gone or estranged, and occasionally find something worth laughing about.
“I was never real. I’m not a person. I’m not worthy of you and I never will be. And now, maybe you can finally be free…Don’t feel anything for me or because of me……Forget me Dean.”
Cas catches up to Dean on the mountain trail, with a broad smile across his face. Sweat drips off of his face, and he's taken off his shirt, to tie around his waist. Both he and Dean are wearing back packs, with mountaineering supplies and rations, for the day's hike.
"I’ll explain later." He sounds eerily content. "Just get there. We don’t have time."
"Castiel! We can’t just leave two dead vampire corpses in the woods for humans to find, later! We have to hide the evidence. Do you want to start a panic in the community?" Castiel stops to turn back and look at them. His face looks pained, and there is a small flash of anger in his eyes.
"Seriously! Are you even kidding me right now!? Who do we know that’s this sloppy? Now we have two bodies to burn and bury." The scene reminds Castiel of something. A young man lying at his feet, the submissive positioning of how his body is laid out, slumped forward, his arms simply lying at his sides as if not caring to try and protect himself from his fate. He seemed far too young to be taken, it not mattering to Cas that he was mourning for a vampire he had never met. He sensed some level of innocence coming from the victim’s side of things….something he could strangely relate to.
"Castiel. Dean Winchester isn’t worth the pain. Don’t think about him. He never once deserved you…" He hears Castiel gasp out loud. Looking over at Cas, Aglibol can see him trembling, his eyes wide, lips quivering. "Oh, Babe.. don’t do that." Without hesitating, Aglibol takes Castiel and wraps him in his arms. Castiel whimpers, trying to hold everything in, even at this stage of things. But Aglibol can hear Castiel muttering under his breath..a soft murmer.."Jack….Jack…..No….Dean needed you…He loved you so much..."
There are stars. So many of them.
“We wanted to…
Castiel arrives back at the top of the stairs with a bag from the local market. Dean raises an eyebrow at him. The children beam when they see Castiel reach inside to pull out three full-size candy bars.
He and Cas have only been collecting wood for a short time when they hear Jophiel call out to them. Both set down the branches in their arms and run further into the woods to find Jophiel and Lailah looking down at something. It’s another vampire…a teenage boy. His head having been separated from his body. Lailah tsk tsks at the lax in judgment from whoever left the body in the woods, for humans to find.
“Thank you Dean.” Cas closes his eyes and lets out a heavy sigh, as he leans back into his seat. "It was closer to home, this time. Even with the warding, I worry about…”
Castiel balances the pizza box as best he can, on his way to motel door '666.' He's still nervous about his job at Crowley's Pizzeria, not used to the array of customers and their quirks. Just that day, one lady had asked him in for cake and cookies, because he had been delivering pizza for a birthday party. The next customer invited him into her apartment to kill a centipede for her. Lord only knew what lies in wait behind door number three ['666' to be exact.]
"Bad timing, Castiel." Billie has appeared in Dean’s bedroom. She looks mildly interested in what’s been going on with the Winchesters but for once, almost looks sad, regretful. Sam moves towards Dean’s bed, protectively.
Dean Praying: "Cas, I’m begging you. If I could just see you one last time..." Castiel starts to panic.
“Well that's just wonderful, Dean, because I love you too....”
“Happy Halloween, Castiel.”
"It’s good to have you back, kid. This is….this is incredible. Billie thank you." But when Dean turns around, she’s gone. All who’s left is Castiel sitting on the bed. Cas..
"It wasn’t reported that the vampire we were seeking had actually managed to turn anyone. Why didn’t we know about this?" Cas looks up at Aglibol who just shakes his head sadly, shrugging his shoulders half-heartedly.
“I love you, too. Cas. I love you…”
Castiel turns on Jophiel slowly. Aglibol, Lailah and Jophiel freeze, not daring to move. Their faces pale. Cas’s eyes are burning blue, his skin starts to glow, only flickering due to lack of power but at the same time menacing enough, and his grip on his machete tightens. The leaves from the trees in the forest start to rustle. Jophiel gulps. He holds up both hands in defense.
Dean leaps out of bed. Sam’s jaw has dropped to the floor. They both run to Jack to embrace him. Jack presses his face against their shoulders. Sam fumbles for the right words, not believing what's just happened. Billie held too much of a grudge towards the Winchesters for the way they've skirted death time and time again, to randomly gift them like this.
"You know we can’t. If they were to find out that monsters like this actually existed, that we existed, there would be complete chaos. The humans would.."
Castiel approaches the door tentatively and knocks, loudly. After a short while a man with blonde hair and green eyes opens the door. He's stark naked, not even a towel around his waist. Castiel's breath hitches and Dean Winchester smiles. He's the most attractive person Castiel has ever seen, in his life. He just stands there, staring with his jaw hanging open. Dean takes a step back and palms himself. He's slick all over, as if from just showering or...is he in the middle of getting done with a massage? He notices a bottle of lube still on the bed and realizes Dean was masturbating while Castiel was knocking on the door. Cas clears his throat and nervously quotes the total for the pizza. Dean looks Castiel up and down and licks his lips before taking the pizza and setting it down on a nearby table. He then goes to get his wallet. Dean has to turn around to grab it out of his coat and Castiel can feel his face burning at the sight of Dean's perfect bubble butt. Jesus... Dean turns around with one hand over his bulge and the other waving around the exact amount that Castiel had quoted. He stutters a moment, wondering if Dean made a mistake. Dean takes note and winks.
But the best part had to be that he was still capable of sweating buckets, and looked forward to the sore feeling that was the result of vigorous exercise, the following day. Some residents preferred a “sweat and pain-free” heaven, but not Dean. Nor Castiel.
Dean grabs Castiel and covers his mouth with his own. Castiel is trembling as Dean picks him up and lays him onto the bed. He rips open Castiel’s top and leans down to suck at his neck.
“What decorations?”
Dean Praying: "I didn’t believe you before..when you said we were real. That you and I were real. I couldn’t face that….and the fact that you had to tell me…Listen. I just want you here. I know we’re not gonna fix this over night. That it’s gonna be messed up for awhile, between you and me but..Cas, I haven’t stopped thinking about the look on your face that night. A lot of things have gone wrong in my life, but you aren’t one of them. I didn’t mean to let you go like that. Please, come back to me. So I can tell you I’m sorry to your face.."
The smile fades from Castiel’s face. The tears falling down his cheeks gleam like silver, with the light of the moon. Dean takes Cas by the shoulders and turns back towards the bunker, keeping an arm around Cas as they descend the stairs to the front door. Castiel sighs heavily and leans against Dean, for support. Dean kisses his temple.
They all run out into the hallway. Castiel is gone. Sam tries to think of what to do next…and then the alarms stop sounding. The lights go back to normal and the walls stop shaking. The quiet would haunt Dean for the rest of his life. He's panicking as he looks desperately to his brother and Jack.
Heaven. He still can’t believe it. He never thought for a second that Jack would bend the rules for even him…unless he and Rowena…Dean thought that he knew he was destined for Hell, no matter what happened.
“It’s you….it’s always been you…” Cas sounds weak and afraid. He cries out and tries to stop by biting down hard on his lip.
"Castiel." Jack gently approaches Castiel by moving towards the bed with his arms open. Castiel flies at Jack and crashes into him, wrapping his arms possessively around Jack, not wanting to let go.
“We…could still call each other” Dean finally lets go and Castiel backs away from him, sadly. “We could still talk…Would you answer me if I called?” Castiel backs into the wall, feeling truly evil and wrong. No option ended with either of them finding true happiness, together or alone. He shakes his head no and Dean just stares at him, not believing any of this is real.
"Cas! Look, I don’t know what Dean said to you exactly, but…look, we’ll talk about it later. Okay? Right now, you have to go inside, Dean’s…sick. He’s….he’s not himself…" Sam looks tired. There are bags under his eyes and his cheeks look like they’ve caved in. Cas starts.
"No, there isn’t. Not now.." He’s looking at Castiel as if he had come back from the dead. "Cas. Don’t leave me again. I need you here. I need you always. Promise you’ll never leave me again." Castiel lowers himself down and kisses Dean on the forehead.
Not understanding any of it, Aglibol just holds Castiel tighter, kissing his forehead. There is the smell of ash, and a red-orangish glow coming from deep within the woods. The young man, the poor unwilling vampire's body burns brightly in the night, turning into nothing but char and ash and smoke. The forest reeks of death and failure. Castiel closes his eyes and prays to Jack, begging for forgiveness in failing him as a father...
"Um, not...not really....Sir...I...should..." Castiel starts to back up and Dean grabs his arm. He tries to tug away, lamely, and Dean pulls him inside the motel room. Castiel stumbles to the ground and Dean shuts the door, locking it behind him. When Castiel brings himself to his knees, he sees Dean stroking his cock with his hand. Dean's look is dark and sensual. Castiel swallows hard as he gazes up into Dean's eyes.
When he had first heard of Dean’s demise…
Behind the barn, Castiel added a hot spring with a view of the mountains and with a patio set up, complete with grill and mini bar. He’s enjoyed the taste of food, while in heaven. The chemical taste gone, Jack never forgot Castiel’s envy for a human being’s taste buds. Now, all supernatural beings could appreciate food like most humans could. While immune to several species, the death rate and the murderess spree on earth had shifted off of demons, angels, and even werewolves. While not eliminating the need to consume live game and blood for most beings, a new tolerance for the human species had developed. A new level of respect. Jack told Castiel that it had been because of him, but Castiel never really believed that.
"Oh Baby. Daddy's little angel. Oh, Baby, here it is...such a good submissive....here it comes...MmmmmmArggghhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Dean dumps his load all over Castiel's face. He spurts shot after shot of cum all over Castiel's eyes, his lips and chin, a beautiful thick, creamy coat of Daddy's milk, of Daddy's cream. The top of Castiel's uniform is drenched. Dean shakes out the last few drops and Castiel licks his lips and wipes his eyes so that he can open them for his Daddy. Dean reaches down and licks off most of his cum off of Castiel's face and Castiel mewls.
"No. Leave as you are. You reek of sex. Covered in cum and lube and sweat and dirt. Go to your next customer. Do you know who it is?"
Dean Praying: "Cas. It’s me…I....I’m sorry. I want you to come home. Sam and Me, we need you to come home."
The set up for the barn had changed over the past year, but Castiel finally deemed it ready for Dean’s arrival.
"Oh Baby Boy. What a nasty slut. Such a nasty slut for your Daddy.." He's almost ready to burst and Castiel happily responds to Dean's dirty words...
"CASTIEL!!! What are you waiting for?!?!" Castiel takes the vampire by the top of its head and violently pushes him to the ground. Jophiel and Aglibol release their grip. Castiel steps on the vampire’s head with one foot pressing down and Aglibol throws himself over the vampire’s legs as he tries once more to get through to Castiel, who seems as if he's in a trance.
Dean is laughing so hard, his face is red. His chest actually hurt (Dean told Jack that he wanted to enjoy all of his scrapes and bruises, though he was dead and in heaven. Jack complied, though Dean noticed he would heal a bit faster here, than if he were alive), but it was worth it. So worth it!
"NO! CASTIEL!!!..." Jack tries opening the door. When it doesn’t move for him, he stands back and raises his hand towards it, bracing himself. Dean is screaming Castiel’s name over and over again, as Sam tries to pull him away from the door. When it’s finally cleared, Jack blasts it open.
There is a whiny, rusting, creaking noise from above (
Now, he seemed almost dead-like, unresponsive, uncaring. It was unnerving. It reminded the Angel Trio of the days when Castiel had been brainwashed to kill without question, without feeling. Without caring about those who got in his way. Aglibol removes his hand from Castiel’s shoulder and suggests they all head back to the jeep, now that the vampire they had been seeking had been dealt with. Both Lailah and Jophiel protest.
"Why not? Why the hell not?! How are we protecting everyone by hiding the truth from them? I’m tired of it. Let them find the bodies! They should!" The other three are shocked at Castiel’s outburst. Aglibol tries to support Jophiel and takes a tentative step towards Castiel, holding his hands up in defense.
“What was it you were wanting to show me?” Dean has Castiel sit down next to him, facing out over a sea of green, with water flowing in and out of the open area, far below them both. Moments after they've sat down, the sun breaks through the clouds and the scene seems to sparkle and shine.
“Then….I should go…” he shifts over to open the door and Dean reaches out for him, only to fall again…afraid to touch Castiel. He knows if he trapped Cas in his arms again, he’d never let him go. And then, he wouldn’t be able to hold back his words, couldn’t be held responsible for his actions..He breaks down sobbing and lays on the floor of his bedroom. Castiel stops once more, fighting himself, wanting so badly to turn around, to look at Dean one last time…
“Well, actually…we weren’t participating with Halloween this year…In fact, I remember putting up a sign down the drive..”
“Dean…Dean…” Castiel’s tears catch at his lashes and Dean kisses them away.
“You apologize, too much.” Cas ignores him.
To be truly happy, what would be the cause of it? Weeks ago, his notions on the subject were out of the question. Dean would never hold him in bed, would never tell him that he loved him, kiss him on his lips…That was Castiel’s idea of true happiness, for a time.
“C’mon Man. Halloween!!! You promised, last year…”
Both Sam and Castiel look at Dean in exasperation. Castiel makes his way downstairs and Sam immediately goes to him, reaching out a hand to help support him, not knowing how badly Castiel’s hurt. Dean of course, keeping his distance, unsure. Castiel touches Sam’s arm lightly and goes to the table. He pulls out a chair and plops down.
“No, Dean. I didn’t. I got side-tracked….by zombies.
No pain in heaven. No despair, or want, but at the same time…
“The DECORATIONS. Halloween stuff in your yard. We thought the sign was fake, like the bodies up there.” He points to the railing. Dean, Sam, and Cas follow the kids up the stairs to see what they’re talking about.
Dean feels a pit rise up in his stomach.
"Do I look like a reaper to you? Not here to collect…..but to drop off." Dean, thinking himself to be fully recovered now, sits up in his bed.
“Jack! That’s not yours. Give it back so we can head to the next house!”
"He’s better. There’s still something wrong with him…"
Castiel is cut off by a flash of red lights, and the sound of an alarm going off. The back-up lights turn on and the screens light up, on the security monitors. Sam opens up his lap top again, and clicks on an icon that’s blinking. It opens up to show the front entrance of the bunker, from the outside. There are three darkly cloaked objects, with distorted faces approaching the door. One appears to be holding a staff, of sorts.
“I suppose I'm meant to view this as some sort of prank?” Dean has fallen back onto the ground next to Cas and is rocking with laughter, tears streaming down his face.
Would he get to see Jack, anytime soon? To thank him?
"I can't give you his name...I'm sorry...."
"Oh Baby Boy! Oh fuck. What a mouth. What a whore mouth. You like that, don't you? You like it when Daddy shoves his dick down your throat? Dirty whore...Nasty...So fucking hot!!" After what seems like too short a time, Dean releases Castiel and pulls his dick out. It leaves Cas's lips with a wet pop and Castiel's face is a mess. His hair is mussed and his neck is covered in sweat and lubricant and pre-cum drip off of his chin. He gasps for air, taking a deep breath. When he opens his eyes he sees Dean masturbating, his cock aimed at Castiel's face. His body seems to glow and his eyes are glassy. His voice is gravely when he talks down to Castiel.
Castiel’s heart stings, his body aches with each step further away he takes from his only home…He’ll find a cave, an abandoned sanctuary…He’ll beat himself and cut himself to distraction… He’ll stop when he remembers the last promise he made to the love of his life, and pray for Dean’s happiness. He’ll pray for the day Dean forgets that Castiel ever existed…forgets his face, the sound of his voice..
, Dean thinks to himself). Castiel enters the bunker. He’s covered in blood. Dean and Sam start.
. They had watched the movie a week ago (Or, whatever counted for approximately a week, in the afterlife...), and when Dean turned to look over at Cas, he saw that he was crying, at the end.
"Why isn’t there any sign of a struggle?" Jophiel and Lailah are both inspecting the body. Lailah is holding the head up by it’s hair and Jophiel is inspecting the victim’s neck. He whistles with admiration.
Maybe then, Castiel thinks, he could finally stay dead…
In his earlier years wearing a human vessel, temperature had never affected him and Castiel would wonder at Dean and Sam’s reaction to a snowstorm or a heatwave, wishing he could understand how to help them and that he could sympathize. Now, in his weakened state, Castiel found himself seeking warmth and despising the wicked cold. Finding comfort and happiness, feeling warmth only when near Dean…
"Forgive me....Daddy...I'm a whore. I'm a slut. I'm bad, Daddy..." Castiel loves being a submissive. He loves when strong men dominate him and call him names and fuck him senseless. Until recently, he got off from knowing it was wrong for him to whore himself around the neighborhood as a minor. But now, he wondered what it meant to come of age as a sub. To serve someone like Dean. At least for now, he was well suited for his role as a submissive little bitch. When he heard Dean refer to himself as his Daddy, Castiel knew exactly how to act. Dean starts to pant and his chest is heaving. He's smiling down at Castiel, pleased at Cas's words..
“Thanks for leaving the warding up on the walls. You didn’t even fix what I got wrong, the first time.”
"And you really scheduled yourself for a shift the day after your birthday? Do anything fun to celebrate?" Castiel starts thrashing his arms around and tries hugging himself to keep still. He tries to look away from Dean's abs but just bites his lower lip instead. Dean stares at Castiel's mouth.
They both look up and smile sadly, watching Sam chase the kid with the zombie head clutched in his hand. The kids think that Sam is just joking around with them, and are laughing with glee. A couple of adults standing next to the impala parked outside (the children’s parents) laugh too, and take out their phones to film their kids and the Brawny man. One looks at his watch and calls out to his son..
Dean loved hiking up heaven's mountains. As far as he could tell, his body was the same age that he was when he died, but he had more energy, here in the afterlife. He was able to do more, and he was much more flexible.
“We're here to enjoy the scenery, Man! Go on, take a look at what Jack whipped up for us, last night!”
Castiel looks up at Dean, confused.
may never have met. I had failed to engage with you, before that night in the barn. They were considering sending someone else, to get in contact with you. And I was in trouble with…Umm. Mmm.” Castiel’s eyes roll back into his head, as Dean kisses down his neck, his chest and his stomach. “Dean!” Dean brushes his lips lightly against Castiel’s hip, and teases him.
"Jack, forgive me. I love you so much. It was all my fault, all of it…." Jack wraps his arms around Castiel and closes his eyes. Cas sobs into him and Jack kisses Castiel’s face, his hair, the collar of his trench coat. "Jack. You’re alive. You’re safe. Home. I love you. What I’ve wanted for so long…..to see your face again….to hear your voice. To hold you. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!" Jack leans against Castiel and closes his eyes, returning his hug.
Aglibol doesn’t understand Castiel’s motives for leaving the vampire bodies to be discovered by the human race. He would try reading Castiel’s mind, but like Angel Radio, any thoughts he might manage to pick up could be warbled, and messed in with Castiel’s memories, past conversations he’s had… Aglibol’s afraid to touch Castiel again, so he slowly passes him on his way back to the jeep. Shortly afterwards, he hears Castiel follow him.
*****
"Cas, do you know what this is? What’s happening? What set off the alarm?" As Dean’s asking these questions, the walls begin to shake. Books fall off the shelves, and Dean’s collection of weapons crash to the floor. Castiel stands up, with a hand still on Jack.
“DEAN! This was a complete waste of Jack's time and energy! How could you?!”
-The End
Dean reaches Castiel, to see Cas covered in what looks like black ink, and blood. But worse…an imprint of his torn and frayed angel wings, covering the walls of the bunker. Later, Dean would forbid Sam or Jack from ever removing them. Dean sobs and takes Castiel’s now dead body…hugging Cas close to him. In desperation, Dean starts to pray: "I’m not letting go this time. They’ll burn our bodies together. I’m not letting go. I’m not leaving you.."
They hold out their basket and bags, eagerly. Dean shakes his head.
“I love you..” Dean pulls himself up along Castiel’s body, and Cas whimpers desperately. Dean finds Castiel’s eyes, and finally says it. His truth. His everything…
wanted, how “We” were going to celebrate Halloween, this year. And I kept saying the same thing over and over….NO!!!”
The kids turn to look at him. They are half way up the stairs to the street level, so Sam has to step outside.
“Trick or Treat!”
"Dean! You’re okay!" He smiles. Castiel furrows his brows.
“That’s different. Your face is scanned into the system, or some crap like that. You can exit and enter whenever you want, like Sam and Me.” Sam tries clearing his throat. Castiel turns to look at
"Sam, there’s something I need to tell you. When you brought me back to life, Cas and I were in heaven…..Castiel….." His lips begin to tremble. "Castiel.."
Dean starts to hum to himself. He continues along on his walk, until the path leads him to an open field. He’s surrounded by tall grass on one side of the path, and corn stalks on the other. It’s still dark out and Dean looks up at the sky to see a shooting star pass overhead.
"Relax, Babe! We’re fine. And it’s over now. Don’t get all…"
“Hey! Why don’t you keep your candy by the door, like all the other houses do?”
"Castiel, NOW!"
Lailah pulls his angel blade out of the vampire’s head, after stabbing him between the eyes. As the vamp falls, Jophiel and Aglibol catch him from behind holding both of his arms behind its back. They wrestle the vamp to the ground. He’s still writhing and wracking his body, and both of the angels struggle. Aglibol shouts over the noise.
Dean reaches out his hand, to help Castiel up the last leg of the trail. Cas stumbles and falls into Dean's sweaty chest, all apologies. Dean shakes his head at his impossible soul-mate and husband.
Afterwards, Castiel and Dean lie naked together, in bed. Castiel is explaining the new design and his additions to the barn, and Dean listens as he looks up at the stars. When Castiel finishes describing the hot spring out back, Dean wraps Castiel in his arms and pulls him close. For awhile, they both look lovingly at each other. Dean kisses Castiel once more, before saying…
-The End
"Good boy. What a good boy for Daddy." Castiel smiles.
All three hurry to the bottom of the stairs, leading up to the front door. They all look up and see Castiel at the top of the railing, slumped down against the door, from the inside. In an attempt to lead the Shadow away from his family, Castiel had attempted to reach his car and soeed as far away from the bunker as he could, before Darkness enveloped him, forever. He never even made it outside. Dean runs to Castiel, knowing the truth before he even gets to him. 'NO!' he thinks. 'That’s not fair……that’s impossible…'
Dean starts to follow behind them when Cas grabs him by the arm and turns him around so they’re facing each other.
Castiel is on the other side of the bunker door, his hand raised as if to open it when he hears Dean’s prayer and stops. He can’t remember the last time Dean tried to reach him this way. Not with a text, not through his brother..'He’s praying to me.' Castiel waits a moment, listening.
“We scanned your face after you got blasted on that ghost hunt last week. You know, after you had passed out.” Sam glares at his brother. Cas sits up straight in his seat.
“I’m thinking ‘Why would I have fixed it?’ If you had got the warding correct the first time, or if you believed before meeting me that angels were real….and that they cared about you…
“We don’t know what it is…what could do it. That your true happiness…you don’t know it has anything to do with me…” Castiel will carry this guilt with him for the rest of his life. The greatest pain Dean’s ever experienced has always been linked to his actions, his choices, good or bad…If he could get away from Dean, far away..
"Cas! What is all…" Castiel cuts Dean off by pulling at his shirt, and Dean falls into him. Their lips meet, and Castiel cradles the back of Dean’s head, with his hands. Castiel’s lips part open, slightly. Dean leans into the kiss and starts to run his hands up Castiel’s back. The alarms are going off, red lights are flashing, the bunker crashing down around them both, but Dean can’t hear or see any of it. When he opens his eyes, all he can see is bright blue, the purest of God’s angels, true happiness.. but they are full of tears. Castiel pulls away, but not before whispering… "I love you Dean." Dean starts to say Castiel’s name, but Cas pushes him violently into the panic room and slams the door. Dean crashes to the floor. It takes him a moment to realize what's just happened.
Dean’s a little frustrated, but then sees that Castiel is still holding the bag full of candy bars, and he melts. Sighing, Dean pulls Cas in for a hug. For the first time, Cas doesn’t stiffen, doesn’t hesitate…he’s been through too much. Losing Jack had left him more vulnerable than Dean has ever seen him. Cas drops the bag and wraps both arms around Dean’s waist, closing his eyes. Dean kisses the top of Castiel’s head.
“Can’t say it’s an experience I like to relive, Sammy.”
Castiel kneels to inspect him, holding his breath as he turns him over. Lifeless eyes gaze back up at him.
He raises his wand.
Jody’s stern expression releases into a large smile, skin crinkling at the corner of her eyes. She grabs Dean by the shoulders. “Thank you. I can guarantee a lot more students will be eager to take part with you and the Professor helping to lead it.”
Cas scans him. "No."
Sam takes a seat. There is an agonising silence as Crowley leans forward, picks up his teapot, and pours tea into a fine china cup only for himself. Sam and Dean look at each other. Castiel and Sam glance at each other.
Sam holds a hand out as he approaches. "Hey, you must be Castiel."
The inane soundtrack of
Castiel nods, soberly, and takes a sip of his cold coffee. He realises Sam is watching him.
Dean feels himself flush, starts untangling himself from Castiel’s form. “Oh, uh—”
"Yes," Cas notes. He tightens his hold on the bag he's carrying and shuffles past. Dean watches him go for a moment, forgetting to close the front door. He briefly wonders, again, how Cas and Jody know each other.
was the one who just didn't
"I will. Good luck." The call ends, and Cas is left staring at the black and white, fuzzy resolution security cameras in front of him. He stares. Then he looks down, and tries to call Dean.
"So he doesn't have a partner?"
"You had taken leave for a week."
“I found Michael trying to interrogate Cas here the other night,” Sam comments, as they walk across the suspension bridge. Dean turns to look at him with a frown.
Castiel  thinks, glancing around the cemetery one last time.  He straightens up, and gently tugs on Jack's hand. "C'mon, Jack. Let's go get you that milkshake."

“29 minutes. Best get a move on.”
He stops when he sees that Castiel is shaking. His footing stumbles a little when he sees tears in Cas' eyes.

“My--my--”
Jody raises an eyebrow.
"The fu--" Dean gasps, and they roll along the floor
"Sure thing, Bobby."
Dean tentatively makes his way over to the man, murmuring his own spell to light up his way. He knows Cas has sensed him, if anything by the lowering of his wand as Dean stands beside him.
"Well, I was a medic. I was hoping to continue on and perhaps become some form of medical professional. I'm not sure what I'd have specialised in. Maybe a doctor."
Dean rolls his eyes. Then he looks up.
Slowly, Cas turns his head towards Dean. His expression is unreadable.
"Hey, great work! Your C and R's are right on the money."
The other man chuckles, and it Dean turns to look at him with his eyebrows raised. Cas frowns at him. “What?”
Sam glares at him. Then throws a soul piercing stare, the one that only a younger sibling can graduate with, one that has seen you through every goddamn awkward and regretful moment of your life. A sibling that equips the insight that comes with knowing
He feels the wooden boards creak behind him. He doesn't move.
"Come on now, can't expect me to do all the wo--"
Lucifer straightens.
father."
Dean holds up the wand in celebration and the students applaud, some of the girls shaking his robe as though a small banner. Dean grins, taking in the applause with a small bow, before turning back to Cas, who is trying to dry his face with a rough wipe of his arm. Water drips off his eyelashes as he coughs, and the class fall silent; Dean included.
Dean blinks. "How'd what go?" He asks, like
, Mr Winchester, for backchatting. Now
The sun, forever persistent, slinks slowly above the horizon. Cas perches on the top seat to the cabin, frowning with some resignation that he’s coming to the end of his spliff. He closes his eyes, exhaling smoke between his lips.
He runs his tongue over his lip, mouth opening to speak – and finds himself slightly dumbfounded when Cas speaks first.

as my elder brother called him, left when I was young. All I really remember is that he loved to play the guitar. But I... know what it is to grieve, Dean, I can--"
He looks down at Cas, a smile slipping along his jaw as blue eyes settle on his own. The chilled wind brushes at the man's dark locks. "You're such a tease."
Sam nods, sheepishly. Dean laughs. “Damn, Sammy. Who brought you up in the Victorian Era?”

"No, I'm just here to stand and look as useless as you.
Lucifer runs a hand through the blood on his face, and looks at Castiel with
Dean hesitates for a moment, before taking a few steps towards the table. "Hard, huh? What's hard about it?"
“She gets out today. Figured I’d spin by here first.”
“I made a promise, Dean.” Cas finally says, voice gentle. He reaches a hand out, pressing against Dean’s elbow, nudging him to look at him. “This isn’t just you.”
“Ah, yeah. Sorry to hear that. My mom died young, too. It can be tough for everyone.”
!” Dean shouts, trying to push Cas off by the chest, trying to fight his own robes from obscuring his view. His back presses against the sodden grass, and they roll around the floor, trying to press each other’s wrists back enough that the other will relent.
"Been doin' quidditch practice, of course. Ran over. Can I come in?"
Dean is holding him as they part for breath, and he cannot resist brushing his thumb against Cas’ jaw, and Cas sees the ghost of his features soften. He wants to cry.
The crackling of oil in a pan.

eyes, like he belonged in an overzealously coloured portrait drawn by one of his students. "It's hard, moving schools so soon."
It’s the first time Dean has ever talked to him.
"Hey, lovebirds!"
Castiel deflates. “I... I’m not sure.”
Not to mention a few shiny new posters of the Marvel Superheroes. Which Dean
Cas stares down at the ground, and Dean can only manage a few moments of silence before he reaches out, placing his hand on Castiel’s shoulder.
"Did you know he's a vet, Sammy?" Dean says, coldly. Sam glances up at him through the mirror, eyebrows raised. "How do I know he ain't like Dad was?"
He looks at her. “There’s four sheets—”
Dean finishes the rest of his drink. “Well
“I was more assuming inevitable death, but sure, both works.”
"Ah, yes. So the challenge is - well. All our participants are to race around a marked track around the Hogwarts grounds with the use of brooms. Any other aids are forbidden, except those of self defence. It - it's simple enough, really."
An odd comment coming from Charlie, but whatever. "If you say so." Dean turns around to pick up the plastic box. From Charlie’s silence, he doesn’t even need to look at her to know what expression she’s throwing at him. He
Castiel nods. Dean opens his mouth to say something, before he feels his phone vibrate in his pocket. "Oh, hey, sorry--" He fishes it out of his pocket, blinking at who's on the screen. "Speak of the devil-- " He turns around, pressing the phone to his ear.
Dean stares at him. He whispers.
Castiel has a dream.
," he whispers, and lifts the tip of his wand to spray water into Castiel's face. Castiel flinches, covering his eyes. He drops his wand, and Dean catches it.
Cas is quiet for a moment, glancing down to his shoulder where Dean has just had his hand. He looks up. “Thank you, Dean.”
Voices. They creep into his consciousness, dragging him into the room, now finally self aware.
We made it, folks! Welcome to the end of Part 1 of this series. Keep an eye out for the next segment.
He has discarded his outer robe, strolling in only his waistcoat. He withdraws his wand, looking to the students. “I have been asked to establish this duelling club in light of recent events.
"Come
The rest of the meal, and the consequential drive home, is quiet.
Sam raises an eyebrow. “I think he’d know, even if I tried not to tell him.” He places a hand on Cas’ shoulder. “Thanks for looking out for him, by the way. I don’t think I ever thanked you - he’s too busy looking out for others sometimes. He’ll appreciate having someone at his back.”
“So what, you went to hang out with your new saviour after class?”
Sam sighs. "He isn't wrong. Lucifer is good. Too good."
"Jack, pass it to me," he says, holding out his hand. Jack looks at him as though wondering whether he should trust this adult man with his
Castiel sighs, anxieties only slightly appeased. "Alright, then."
"Cool." Dean grins. "
Footsteps. Voices.

“I’m sure they will give you lots of justice, if they get to exchange ideas with the Dementors.”
“Butter fingers, that’s me.”
that?”
There is tense silence as spells are thrown across the room. Dean finds himself dodging far more than he’d like for something that is not a Quidditch match, but he manages to stay on his feet. They step closer and closer, and at one point, Cas laughs when he catches Dean off guard, nearly teetering off the platform.
"What the fuck did you
accounts has damaged your ego, Dean.”
Sam waits for further deliberation, but there is none. Instead, with a sigh, he tucks the letter in his desk drawer, chair creaking as he unfolds himself from behind the desk. He nods at Michael.
there. You might think you're fooling people but you ain't fooling
"Well, it's clear what needs to go next."
“Hey, Jack. Have a good day?”
Dean growls up at him, as best he can in his state. Lucifer just watches.
“A Dark Wizard is someone who uses their magic to gain followers and gain a following and use their magic to inflict harm, on both other wizards and muggles. They also use the unforgivable curses”
"More than my face that's injured," He murmurs, adrenaline leaving his hands to shake. He falls quiet as he looks down at Cas' hand, firm on his wrist.
Dean blinks, thinking for a moment. Then he nods. “Makes sense.” A beat of silence. He speaks, quieter. “So, uh. Michael?”
“Anna?”
The hallway is bathed in the flickering red and black of flames, all coming from upstairs. Eileen freezes.
“I know your luck hasn’t been great so far,” he says, earnestly. He withdraws his wand from his robes, holding it up in front of him in preparation. Dean has flashbacks, to a few months earlier, when a taller man with blue eyes did the same thing and nearly kicked his ass. It was some of the most fun Dean had had all year.
Eileen frowns to herself for a moment, her first thought flitting to
He grabs his wand back from Dean.
“You’re the one that—”
“After all, what are friends for?”
The wind is knocked out of him as they both collide, brooms tangling between each other. The force stops their flight completely and they fall towards the ground, capes wrapping around their shoulders and heads. Growling, Dean pushes at Cas, and in their tumble they spin round and round each other, and Dean wonders when they’ll—
Dean squeezes his shoulder and lets go, taking a step back. He exhales. He tries a bashful smile.
“Enough.” Castiel states, and the room falls silent. “A Patronus is an extremely complicated spell, certainly not for third-year students to learn. If it is necessary then maybe I will. It certainly isn’t necessary for succeeding at Hogwarts.”
Crowley rolls his eyes. "While Lucifer was still
“Does Dean know?”
of you are disqualified."
"As much as I enjoy you wanderin' into my house to drink my beer, I know you got plenty at home." He pauses. "What are you doin' here?"
Crowley raises an eyebrow as they all shuffle in, and Crowley looks pointedly at Dean, then to the door. Dean blinks dumbly for a moment, before pushing it closed with his foot.
It takes a hot, nerve wracking second for his brain to recognise it. "Cas?"
Michael growls. "You'd better watch where you stand, Winchester. You don't know what you're talking about."
“Was saving it for a special occasion.”
"You're expecting him to lose?"
"Word gets round, huh."
“Professor, you’re being
As he’s leaning down, he hears the distinct sound of a person at the counter, and items being dropped by the till ready for purchase. He starts to straighten back up.
“I’ve met him on a few occasions, when certain investigations have brought me to the Department of Mysteries. He’s a good man.”
Dean begins to read.
. Dean frowns, and opens the cover. When he reads the message he finds himself swallowing, hard.
Castiel watches him for a moment. “I would if I could, but I’m fairly certain Hogwarts staff aren’t allowed to support Ministry members during a challenge. It’ll go both ways.”
They start walking towards him.
"Bullshit," Bobby barks, grabbing some slices of bread. He dunks one into the bowl of beans. "Stop carryin' this stuff by yourself, boy. Sam's not a kid no more, and you ain't protectin' him by keeping quiet."
Cas presses a hand to his shoulder. "I will... see you soon." He says.
“Sir, is it true that you saved Master Winchester from loads of dementors last night?”
Castiel is frowning. “But I didn’t—”
"Sam with Eileen?"
Castiel nods. “As you said; it is my job.”
“Weird to think that just over there is where I nearly died.”
You don’t need to say that the view is beautiful, but sometimes, it helps.
on time—early in fact—but
Charles Shurley stands, a shy smile as he clears his throat.
," both Sam and Dean say, simultaneously. Lucifer rears his head, looking at them both with narrowed eyes—all appearances of the concerned father wiped from his face.
He’s come to understood, since then, that he could very likely have been the one in the wrong.
Chuck smiles uneasily as he takes a few steps forward, stepping over the markings to enter the arena. Castiel stares down at the boundary line, then back up to Michael. He frowns.
The door was left wide open (why no neighbour had said anything or phoned
“Where'd Maximus go?”
They stare each other down a moment longer, before Michael glances to Castiel. He pulls his robe to himself. "We'll continue this conversation later, Castiel." He turns on his foot, and strides out of the hall.
“To friggin’ torture yourself?”
“If you’re here to bemoan the fact that the Dementors made yet another interruption the goings on at Hogwarts, then you’ve already made your point clear enough; despite the fact that I have already told you that the blame for this can fall on no one but the Ministry.”
Jack at that moment bounces up. ‘Uncle Lucy’s’ shoulders drop, and he smiles at the boy.
"Daddy!" Jack exclaims, sliding off his chair to run to Castiel, clinging to his leg in greeting. Cas ruffles his hair, before looking back up at Dean; Dean feels himself on edge just by the look Castiel gives him — it's a perfectly civil expression, but his back is straight, and his eyes are hard.
"Well
An arm snaps out and he grabs Cas by the neck. Castiel wheezes, and Lucifer slams, and slams, and slams and--
And Dean leans forward, so gentle that Cas forgot he could hold himself this way, and he kisses Cas, long and warm and soft, and when Cas leans back for air his hands press on Dean's arms, staring at him.
He comes to a stop, letting the engine run for a few more minutes as it sits outside the house. There is a big truck parked outside, but curiously, no one comes to the front door despite some strange vehicle being sat on his property. Either no one is home, or Dean was expected.
once he’d stuck it on the fridge.
Dean looks down. “No, ah. Sammy did. Jess woke up first. Sorry.”
He watches as Castiel silently strides to the back of his team, throwing his leg over the broom. He can’t recall ever seeing Castiel fly before. Jody must have been pretty desperate for a replacement if she’d chosen
. It had to be.
She sighs.
Castiel stares at it, then stares at the other bouquet that was there before they were. He looks at Jack, who was looking at him curiously. He hands the bouquet to Jack.
Dean laughs. Then realises he's in the middle of a race.
“Uh, no, he gave me it.”
, typed carefully underneath. He reaches his fingers out and brushes them against his name. He finds himself surprised that it isn’t Castiel’s name.
He assembles his gun, and stands up, knee creaking. He looks at Cas, for far longer than is sensible. He shoves the gun in his thigh holster.
Lucifer stands there, with a sour look directed at both Sam and Cas. "I can't believe you, brother." He says, surprisingly soft. He turns to face him, looming over his younger brother. "You're family, and yet you choose to deprive me of my own son."
Cas's smirk doesn't fade.
Comfort eating was called
A soft sigh, a head on shoulder, fingers and hearts intertwined.
. I’m just saying how unfair it is that you’re picking him apart in front of us. All families have got crap in them, don’t mean anything about the people. Hell, even I—”
"You don't need to hurt anyone."
He barrels out onto the landing just as the perpetrators arrive at the top of the stairs. He doesn't recognise them, especially being bundled up in black, but he doesn't really need to—it's pretty obvious who
“Come on, Jack,” Castiel urges, calmly wiping some of the tears from his cheeks. “You have to tell me, otherwise I can’t help you.”
Dean raises one shoulder. "Hey now, don't put yourself down. Nearly knocked me out in the game the other day."
A glance at the man he gave his wings for, and he turns to peel off his shirt.
"Two drinks on delivery to the most handsome boys in the diner," a female voice serenades from beside them and Dean drags his gaze away to stare up at the approaching waitress. Young, female. If Castiel had to guess, possibly Ellen's daughter? He wouldn't suppose to presume, though.
“Dude, what is
He’s halfway across the pitch when he finds himself coming to a halt. Hairs stand at the back of his neck, and he instinctively clutches at his wand, in hand, of where the end of it is currently lit up so he can see where he is going.
Chuck finally stands to his feet.
“I can’t explain over the phone — Jack’s fine, don’t worry. But you need to come home.”
Stood by the curtains, framed by the sun bleeding against the window, was Lucifer. Lucifer is still facing it. Castiel clenches a fist, sudden anger gnawing in his chest.
Jack gives a dutiful nod, before leaning forward, gripping the pencil he was carrying super tight and carving at the paper, tongue sticking out from concentration. Dean has to refrain a slightly amused smile. Kids were kind of adorable, when they weren't screaming at him or each other.
"Oh?" Ellen questions, flipping the burger with a nonchalance that only comes from years of muscle memory. "How were they?"
“I gotta drive later, Charlie. Even I got my limits.”
Lucifer is silent. Castiel stares at him, and attempts to press down on the elation threatening to burst in his chest.
“Dean,”
Castiel holds his suspicions, among other things.
Dean’s grin draws quiet at that, glancing at Cas with a soft look in his eyes. “Yeah. Glad she was around when I was a kid."
With a sigh, Castiel dumps Jack's slightly damp schoolbag in the hallway, and hangs up their coats. By the time he rounds the corner into the kitchen, Anna is already pouring Jack some apple juice. Cas frowns.
Dean just frowns, shaking his head. "Just some place in the middle of nowhere."
“My--” Jack pauses, swallowing a sob. He tries to take a deep breath. “I-I fell over--”
Dean stands at the back of the classroom, hufflepuff tie sliding from round his neck. He clenches his fist.
not a student—”
Meg approaches them, with a bored look on her face. "Are you all ready?" She asks. Cas is glaring at her, but says nothing. Dean glances to him, then to her. "What, you the referee?"
Castiel, sat behind Dean, holds up four sheets of paper. Naomi takes them without a glance.
unfair. You’re talkin’ about his family and calling his family evil
His partner, Kaia, glares at Jack utterly unimpressed. With no fanfare she throws his arm over her shoulder, and they wander off into the castle. Dean turns to the rest of the class. He starts to grin.
"Fuck off," Dean comments, hoisting the box into his arms. "You gonna say that about every strange guy that comes in?"
Sam doesn't realise just how blankly he's staring at the computer screen until he feels a pair of gentle hands on his shoulders, rubbing deep at the knots in his muscles. He exhales, arching a little into the motion.
They fill in the empty chairs left out at the impossibly longer staff table, and the Minister takes a stand at the lectern, Professor Singer wordlessly taking a step back.
And you all know, security
“I love you, Cas,” he murmurs, voice scratchy, and Castiel has to close his eyes.
To his surprise, it's Eileen, trying to video call him.
“Hey, uh. Have you seen Cas?”
…company."
“Relax,” Jody soothes, fingers on his arm tightening, grounding him. “He's here. We’re all safe. Take it easy, you had a rough time.” She lets go, knowing how much Dean will actually heed her words.
The house was empty. It was
what you're getting at."
“Cas, we can work this out—“
Dean’s clapping goes to wild waving when he realises who else is part of the group — a wave back and Dean hops down to go greet his brother, clasping him on the shoulder. “Dude, why didn’t you tell me you were coming?”
" Eileen exclaims, urgently. She grips under his arm and tugs hard as she can. They both stumble out, tumbling onto the landing. The flames were beginning to crawl around the door-frames, and while Eileen attempts to go out to close the door she hisses as her hand burns on the handle. Too late, too much.
"What were you gonna do?"
is more fun."
No longer facing Chuck Shurley, half dissolved in the conclusion of a Polyjuice potion.
Cas squints. He hears Sam snort, and opts to ignore him.
He looks at her.
Lucifer. Invoices. Payments.
Jack nearly drops it completely, but at least the risk of the pencil carving 'car' into the table had decreased significantly.
The students he's overseeing acknowledge Cas before he does. One of the students waves behind him.
Ellen turns, brow furrowed in frustration. She brandishes the spatula she's holding. "Boy, you call us that one more time, you're gettin this spatula straight to the face."
“I think Michael is up to something.”
“No,” Dean murmurs, eyes centered on Cas. “It’s a ‘don’t get yourself fucking killed’ kiss. I’m not done screwing you over yet.”
"What
Jody rolls her eyes, but she’s smiling.
Sam is propped up on a bed behind him, looking rather well for what Dean was anticipating. His brow furrows in confusion.
"We have reason to believe that the receipt of those invoices is linked to a murder inquiry, your Honor."
They stand there in silence in the doorway of Sam's bedroom. Dean closes his eyes; shifts so his face inches ever closer to the crook of the male's neck. He's lulled by the rhythm of the angel's chest rising; angels wouldn't need to breathe, would they?
“I’ll try it.”
Dean mutters around his burger, “Rabbit-Moose.”
"Yeah, thanks."
“Dean,”
He reaches to his chest. Chuck's expression flickers from one of anticipation to one of confusion as Dean reaches not for the gun, but his shirt pocket.
He remembers the day before, when Cas had entered his cramped office after the school's sessions had been done for the day. Dean had smiled at him, until he'd spotted the envelope clutched in the Professor's hand. It had been the details of their challenge.
When Cas doesn’t respond, Dean finally allows himself to turn around, growling. Cas is looking at him, forlorn.
Castiel finally turns around at that, blue eyes gazing at Dean with a look that merely confirms his suspicions. Dean can’t figure out if Cas is hurt or not.
Castiel sighs. He looks at his watch.
"You told me that you had those Dementors under control, Castiel," Michael seethes back, ignoring his demand. "The whole school is in danger--"
He stares at the bottle of beer as Dean opens it for him. He notices the slight shake in Dean's hands.
As he opens it, he pulls out scraps of paper - and realises that they're all receipts, or invoices. Confusion bubbling in him, Castiel opens his door (glancing around to see he's not being watched), before sliding in and sifting through them.
"I'll check in with you about Cute Dad Guy in about six months, Winchester," Charlie half sings, waltzing back towards the door.
"I was gonna tell you eventually, Sammy."
“Sammy,” Dean croaks. “Where’s Sammy?”
Sam gives a curt nod, straightening. “Yeah,” he says. Then snorts. “Thought you were the one who didn’t like chick flick moments?”
Cas is still staring at him. He speaks, quietly. Dean takes a few steps forward. “Maybe. But I don’t want to make assumptions.” He stares at Dean. “And I don’t want you to get into danger.”
“Dean.”
"Did I stutter?" Crowley asks.
Dean pauses, scanning the angel for a moment. Cas still has his hands firmly against Dean’s arms, even during his attempt to scramble away. Their eyes meet.

Castiel opens his eyes, and sees a figure stood at the doorway that he is walking towards.

The students fall silent.
“Why are we the infamous ones?”
the infamous ones?”
that I was involved. Otherwise I'll have your fucking heads." Crowley looks at them.
‘Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our penultimate match for the Quidditch inter-House cup, between Hufflepuff and Gryffindor!”
Sam sighs, and turns so that Eileen can see him. He'd been working at the papers from the custody case nearly all day. He didn't have much time left before he went on leave for the wedding, so he needed to make sure that everything was
They look at each other.
Castiel pulls Jack along, ushering him smoothly along the damp grass as they leave the cemetery.

for the past ten years, he’ll have definitely dealt with much worse than a simple paralysis poison,” he pauses, gently shaking the dropper with the antidote in. “In fact, I had to slip him a double dose, because the first one wouldn’t make him go down.” He prizes Castiel’s mouth open and drops in the mixture, before closing his mouth and stepping away. “So at least give him some space to take a breath before you snog his brains out from relief.”
He remembers her hand in his, slackening, cooling. He remembers green eyes, glassed over.
He supposes the title loses its intimidation when it’s attached to a sibling.
He tries to look down, to see if anyone on the stadium has spotted, tries to see if Cas or even Michael is there. Sam and Claire are still ahead of him, thankfully. At least the Dementors haven't gotten to them yet.
Dean shrugs. “Just seemed like he lost his timing. Happens sometime.”
Dean looks uncomfortable. There wasn't much point dancing around it. "It's about Dad."
Cas tilts his head. Then smirks. "Who said anything about me helping?"
“Well, knowing the parents always makes things easier,” Ellen remarks, flipping the burger onto a bread bun. She drops it on the counter. “Says a lot about the family when the parents are willing to know the teacher, I think. Ain’t that right, Sam?”
Crowley sits behind his desk, with a very posh tea set set aside, his legs crossed. Sam leads Castiel into the room, and Dean shuffles awkwardly behind. He sees Dean staring with some bemusement at a glass swan just…
It’s a quiet part of town that Cas directs him too, tucked away in one of the older suburbs of the area. To his relief, the lights are on when Dean pulls up.
Dean tries not to find himself anxious as silence falls between them, the cringe of what he said slowly getting the better of him. Just as he’s about to open his mouth to change topic, Castiel shakes his head.
He feels the snitch’s wings flutter underneath his fingers, and he clenches his hand and—
He feels Dean watch them both leave. Castiel winces as he hears his shoes squelch.
Castiel is still looking at the door, and for a moment Dean fears the worst. Then Cas sighs himself.
to save others."
Cas had never driven home so quickly in his life.
"Don't you dare tell m--"
Just as his fingers brush at the handle of the gun, a sharp pain shoots behind Dean's ear, and the last things he hears are Jack’s cries as everything goes black.
"Oh, you
“I’m sure your brother is more than capable.” Castiel states. He stares at Dean. “Aren’t you concerned for your own safety?”
Dean whoops and cheers louder than anyone. He holds Sammy close, closer than he would have done a few weeks ago, if that was even possible. He lifts up Eileen and spins her around, her small stature with arms stronger than you'd possibly imagine out of such a small woman. Sam would be in good hands. As would she.
questions his choice of profession.
Dean Winchester hovers outside in the pouring rain, perched on his broomstick. He gives a wet grin to Cas. "Hey."
"Unfortunately, one of our staff members were caught in the middle of the chaos. I've received news that Professor Novak is in a critical state, and has been taken into St. Mungos emergency care."
He grabs his broom (feeling incredibly cool) and leaps off the roof, landing on his broom in mid-air. He restarts his place in the race, realising he's now in last place. He isn't worried.
He stares down the aisle. “First, we will be demonstrating how I expect you to act during these sessions. Master Winchester has gratefully offered to assist me.”
Dean looks up. He frowns at his brother. “What?”
Castiel sighs, moving to sit on the bench beside Dean.
Castiel stares into Jack’s bedroom. Tumbled to the side, perched upside down on the carpet and staring at him from its odd angle, was a plush, red, gecko.
Castiel shakes his head. “No.”
“Isn’t it hard — y’know?”
"To enjoying ourselves then, I guess."
Castiel shakes his head. “No, beyond that. Something doesn’t feel right about everything that’s happening here. I can’t say yet, and I don’t think anyone else is aware.”
“There are several places you could be pointing out to me.”
They come to a stop at the top of the Grand Staircase, soft groans of wood as the stars shift throughout the hall. Castiel gazes at him.
It begins with a kiss.
Dean was a little surprised just by how many people did turn up. Pastor Jim, whom he'd not seen since he and Sammy were kids, Rufus, some other oldies. Most of them made remarks about how he was a good man, and it was a 'shame what Mary's death did to him.' He and Sammy could only exchange knowing looks.
“Distracted?”
He walks around the edge of Jody's car, giving it a once over, but opts to rap on the door before investigating any further. After a few seconds of silence, he tries it. It's unlocked.
A nod. Cas stares down at his tea. “I don’t know the details, but Kelly came to the conclusion that Lucifer was, well, an abusive ass. She was a friend of mine; we were work colleagues. So she came to me asking for help, and I helped her, and… along with some other family members, helped keep Lucifer away. We all knew he was involved in, uh, ‘conducting illegal activities’, and eventually he ended up serving time.”
"What are you doing here, Sir?" they ask, then gasp rather dramatically. "-- Are you here to teach us?!"
"You don't know what you're asking of me, Winchester," Cas says - no, growls.
Aroma curling into old, cracked walls.
“--Okay, Jack.” Castiel says, and with a grunt swings him out of the car. He tries, as always, to not think about just how big he’s getting. “Well, let’s head in and I can also meet our ‘Uncle Lucy’.”
"Hey, ya never know.”
Ever so calmly, as though ushering in a young boy on his first day of school, walks Castiel.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Unsurprising. Is he running it?”
" Cas is yelling, sprinting towards the end of the pitch. He turns to person closest to him, which happens to Michael. "Get me a broom, I have to --"
“Yes, Michael?” He questions, once the other has come within earshot. Michael comes to a stop, and watches him for a moment.
Castiel squints. "But you're not on the clock."
Sam sighs. "Not sure who you’re trying to reassure here, Dean."
Sam realises they are not alone. Three other members are in the office - Chuck’s personal assistant, Becky Rosen, who gives Sam a smile wide enough that it shows off her teeth - Anna, who was another former Auror, now part of the Obliviator Headquarters (Sam feels Michael glare at her in greeting). Sam’s chest tightens at Meg Masters.
“I just wanted to see my son, Castiel. Does he — does he even know me?”
Dean swallows.
A few students pass by, enough to draw attention from them, and Cas quietly steps away. He shakes his head. “I can’t say too much. Maybe I will, soon. I just wanted you to know.”
"Very well. But that doesn't refute what I said," he says, and walks off—his lawyer, Crowley, in tow. As soon as they're sure Lucifer has left, Dean steps towards Cas.
It’s like the universe begins right then. And nothing I’ve done or said or prayed before matters. None of the times he didn’t come matters. He’s there, and nothing happened before he got there.
Castiel really should nip this in the bud. Dean
all of that falls away. Because this book is doing something different.
His lips are pursed and gorgeous, and Dean kisses them lightly. “Sam’s-making-breakfast-time. Get up or I’m going to eat it all.”
Small comfort, that.
thing. That skeeves her out. And then, she starts the next book, and he’s doing the
A third time, and now all the bad writing – seriously, someone had to tell this guy to stop using “the angel” all the time, and seriously, “the weight of heaven’s wrath”? – is so painfully obvious she can barely stand it. Seriously, 50 Shades could stand up to this crap. Not that Charlie has read it. She’s just read the MST3K versions and that one Tumblr that analyzes just how bad it is, piece by piece.
And for no reason he knows of, he lowers his lips down onto Castiel’s, a bare whisper of a kiss. Pressing, a second, and then gone.
“Nope,” Dean says, and dares to slide his hand behind Castiel’s neck, curl it, tug him in for more kisses. Cas makes a noise against his lips, not a hum but a moan, quickly cut off but, for the moment it sounds, bright and resonant, vibrating in Dean’s bones. Energy surges in his tired muscles at the feel of it, and he very nearly powers himself over and on top of Cas, holding back only because his back is still complaining at the stiff sitting-sleep he attempted before. But he’s imagining it now, body heating at the idea of pressing Cas into the ground, letting their legs slot together, rolling his hips down against Cas’s and kissing him until Cas’s stubble has rubbed his chin raw and neither of them can breathe.
Oh, screw everything. Charlie turns over and buries her head in her pillow. This isn’t her fault. She can’t help it. The author is shipping it. The author is the one making the overly grandiose parallels between the two of them. “Sharing more”? “Something moving within him”? How was that not written as a deliberate tease?
And mortality, too. There are times Castiel gets quiet, misty, and stares off into space for a long time. Dean finds him, usually sitting on the porch rocking back and forth on the swinging bench they’ve installed (the grandkids love it), looking out into eternity… or as far as his poor human eyes can still see.
(He needs Cas’s body warm against his, Cas’s lips breathing soft song into his own…)
“I know, right?” Charlie tells her e-reader.
When he appears, it’s like “Let there be light.”
He craves that calm more than he should. It’s the first he’s had in a long time, and it calls to him like alcohol does after a hunt, like a good stretch does when he’s been behind the wheel for hours. Something his body needs. And the craving comes up every time he looks at Cas, every time he remembers the feel of his hand closed over Cas’s hand, a silent promise made with a not-quite-handshake that yes, when the time comes, he will feel that closeness again.
“Dean. You know he’s gonna wanna talk about it with someone. He had to ask me in detail about why going to the bathroom was so strangely satisfying. He’s gonna ask.”
Castiel’s body rolls forward, a wave breaking, and his head and shoulders go to the sheets, ass waving in the air. “Dean,” he says again, voice shaking, and Dean’s never seen anything like the way his body moves, the way his ass wiggles with the plug sticking out and vibrating, like he’s trying to get it deeper inside him and push it out all at once. It’s incredible. Dean is getting hard just watching, his cheeks flushing, and he finds himself wondering, is it that good? What’s it feel like? If Cas is loving it this much, if he’s whimpering the way he’s whimpering, then maybe Dean wants to try. But what if he’s in pain and just doesn’t know how to say it? Maybe Dean should reach over, pluck it out, make sure he’s okay.
Dean tried to touch him once. He wasn’t thinking about it — he just reached out as Cas was about to leave, swiped his hand through Cas’s arm, and recoiled as a chill passed through him. “I forgot,” he mumbled when Cas turned in surprise. “You’re so real to me, I just…”
Dean’s not a fan of fruit when it’s not in pie, and he doesn’t like girly drinks. But icy droplets of strawberry daiquiri look pretty enticing when they hang off Castiel’s lips, shivering in the sunlight as though they’re about to melt and run down across his chin. One starts, and it’s too much of a waste. Dean leans in, presses the flat of his tongue to Castiel’s chin, and licks upward to his lower lip, catching the watery strawberry taste. His lips close over the other errant fragments of ice and sugar, and it doesn’t taste girly at all.
Dean fights to find words. But Castiel doesn’t wait for them. He reaches out with his other arm, catches Dean by the waist and pulls him into a loose embrace. They’re nose to nose, and when Castiel exhales Dean can feel the warm puff of breath against his own lips.
“Which makes sense,” Dean says. “Death told me that God and the angels were what beat back the Darkness before.”
Dean’s talking a little too loudly. “You’re damn right I am. And it’s like having two of each of you. God, do you have to think so damn much when you talk? Agh. And now there’s Kevin. No, we’re not planning a freaking war. Stop thinking we look like a war council.”
It takes a hundred shouts before Dean lifts his head. He’s breathless, too, from exertion and his own desire. “Cas,” he murmurs, voice rough and aching. His hips roll against Castiel’s, and they both grunt in shameless need at the heat that burns through them from that perfect point of contact. And Dean captures Castiel’s lips with his own, thrusts his tongue into Castiel’s mouth, groaning hard and loud. He pulls Castiel tight against him and just ruts against him for a moment, like an animal, uncaring.
The voice is so gentle and tempered Dean has to look twice to make sure it’s really Cas. But there he is, trenchcoat and blue eyes, and Dean gestures to the empty space next to him on the bench. Castiel sits down, folds his hands loosely between his knees, and gazes unspeaking up at the moon for a time.
“Not yet,” is the answer. “Looking across space is also looking back in time. I see these planets as they were a hundred million years ago. Most of them are just starting out. Some are cold. Lonely, frozen. Others are too hot and toxic to support life. Some are just balls of gas that never caught fire. But some…” He smiles.
That makes a lot more sense. A psychic. Charlie should have thought of it before. So there’s some psychic out there who’s keeping tabs, on purpose or by accident, on Sam and Dean. And writing about it. The thought makes her furious. She’s never had a psychic vision, but she’s pretty sure that if she had one, she’d know the difference between it and a fleeting inspiration. Those, she’s had. Mostly about Hermione. Or Starbuck. Speaking of which, how cool would these books be in space? Or Sam and Dean at Hogwarts. That would be amazing. Sam and Dean would be a pretty awesome team of Beaters…
Charlie minimizes the e-reader on her tablet and goes to the website where she first found this series of books. Yup, that’s the same series she’s reading now, by the same author, who’s apparently written himself into Sam and Dean’s life, or Sam and Dean have come into his life, or something very wonky that makes it a little difficult to understand. The lines of fiction and non-fiction here have been blurred long enough; now she’s reading a book about the books she’s reading, and that is just really mind-bending.
His shoes lift off the floor. Sam watches him, carefully, suspicious of every movement. But as Gabriel floats toward him, a foot off the ground, Sam finds himself unable to move. He stands there, rooted to the spot, watching Gabriel get closer and closer. For an instant, a pair of lips touch his. A kiss like a dream. Sam’s not even sure, right now, that it even happened.
Dean sighs. “Are you for real?”
“Saturday,” Castiel agrees, nodding.
“I wanted to wait until our options were totally open,” Dean says, as though it’s the most obvious impulse in the world. “What if you had a craving to get married in Georgia? Or a cowboy-themed wedding in Texas? We could say ‘yee-haw’ instead of ‘I do.’”
Anonymous asked you: I know this was a while ago, but if you do Destiel/Now Or Never Kiss, I will love you forever and ever… (not that I don’t already)
"And the two are not related?” Castiel tilts his head.
It’s only fair. You let go of him.
And in that moment of thought, the door opens.
Charlie’s still not over
…traitorous thoughts that have got no place in the wilds of Purgatory. They shock him out of his motionlessness, and he turns to go.
,” he says, and stumbles out of the crawl space, stretching and pulling his knife from his belt.
Dean watches his profile and wonders exactly what Cas thought for a long time. That he’d never be able to touch Dean again? Was it such a big deal, being able to touch him?
Second person Cas/Dean smutlike product.
“One of those kids who loved bugs, huh?” Dean tries to imagine Castiel as a child, crawling across the pavement following a beetle or a line of marching ants. “Bet your parents loved that.”
Another stroke, another few notes, and Dean’s whole body is calming now, relaxing into the touch and the sound. His face, too… his lips hang slightly open, and Cas stares at them, draws himself closer to Dean so they brush at feet and knees and shoulders. Keeps singing, keeps stroking, his arm bent over Dean’s body – at first suspended, then relaxing so his elbow rests on Dean’s back just beneath his shoulder. A low hum, his hand sliding back against Dean’s sweat-damp hair, Dean’s exhalations buffeting soft air against Cas’s face. All in a rhythm, all together. Every inch just a little closer.
Castiel nods. A flicker of light, and he’s gone.
Dena’s words goad, but her gaze is patient, and Castiel finds a kind of strength there. She reaches out and places her hand on Dena’s knee, a gesture that could be just a friendly reassurance. Or, if Dena chooses, perhaps it could be something more.
This time, when Dean kisses him, Castiel doesn’t turn his head away. And Dean pours into the kiss everything he’s feeling – gentle affection, the elation of the day, that golden feeling he gets every day when he wakes up and realizes he loves and is loved by a man whose courage saved him, whose faith restores him every waking moment. He clasps Castiel’s face in his hands and doesn’t let go, even when their lips have parted.
“Wait a sec,” Dean interrupts. “So you can give him a name that’s not a name just by making sure the name is what he is? What kind of weirdo nonsense logic is that?”
“I won’t see you again,” Castiel says. “Not in this life.”
“Dude, no.”
“The key is not to make any sudden movements. Did you try to swat them away? When they came into your yard.”
“What is it?” Castiel has trouble finding his voice.
So wake up. Wake up and look at me so I know things are gonna be OK.
Benny raises a hand. “Me neither.”
“He knows, though, I guess.”
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel says, without turning.
Castiel pulls himself together. “Yes,” he says carefully, “I think I could.”
So Dean and Sam find Castiel by the highway and take him in and Dean’s hustling the two of them back to the Men of Letters HQ when he hears Castiel say something he didn’t say. That is, Dean looks at Cas and says “I don’t think that’s true,” and Castiel says, startled, “I didn’t say anything.”
It’s just … the voices, when they come through … what she knows of them and the way they think and the way they talk … it’s frakking uncanny. It has to be real.
Dean follows, muttering a string of curses about his back. “Dunno about that,” he grumbles.
Gabriel is not that short, even though Sam’s obscenely tall; his head fits right in the gap between Sam’s shoulder blades, and he likes to run his tongue along the vertebrae there, finding the bumpy funniness of it endlessly interesting. Sam arches, and when he runs his fingers through his hair a torrent of loosened droplets fall down on Gabriel’s head. Gabriel chuckles into the wetness and holds Sam tight, arms wrapped around his stomach. “You’re like a big, wet dog,” he says.
* * *
“What you mean,” Castiel says, “is that
“Because it’s you. And it’s Cas. Look, I want you to be happy. I don’t care what shape that takes, it’s nothing to do with me. I just don’t want you closing any doors that’ll just hurt you in the end.”
reads the intro. Charlie rolls her eyes. She could never get into Judy Blume back in the day. She was too into Ursula K. LeGuin and Lloyd Alexander and C.S. Lewis. Who wanted to read about girls liking boys and getting their periods when you could be reading about swordfights and dragons and talking lions?
Dean blinks. "Wait a sec. A star disappeared?”
Relax, he says, but Castiel can’t relax. He’s too afraid of saying the wrong thing, doing something misguided and foolish, making Dean write him off as an annoyance. He’s failed at so much. Whether it’s fixing heaven or fixing slushy machines, he can’t seem to be competent when the pressure is on.
The beat in his head keeps him going, long after fatigue is starting to weigh down his limbs. You can’t afford it. It’s wrong. There’s no peace here. No curling up next to angels and letting their lips drift over yours as they hum sleep into your soul…
Castiel takes in a soft breath, and she speaks low and clear. “I love you. I really thought you knew,” she adds, perplexed.
“Cas.” Dean heaves a sigh, presses closer and winds his arms around Castiel’s waist. “Of course I mean it. You think I haven’t thought about it? How long have we been doing this?” He tries to kiss Castiel’s mouth, but Castiel turns away and he gets a brush of lips on cheek instead. “C’mon, don’t pout. I was just waiting for the right moment.”
“I would never abuse you. This is a partnership, not an ownership.” Dean said firmly now and then he took a breath and Cas felt his knuckles rubbed lightly and caringly. It was grounding and it made him feel good, settled and safe. “I had a sub, who was too much. Too intense, too clingy. She swore she was the only one who could satisfy me and I, I had to get away from that.”
Castiel was confused, it seemed that Dean was trying to shoo him out again,  but he wanted Dean to be happy, if they were to be snowed in, it was best to keep him fed and comfortable right? At least, after this many years he thought so, Dean could be very puzzling at times.
“Yeah,that. I mean, do we act like a couple?” Dean asked, frowning to himself. He hadn’t thought that they had, but maybe he was wrong.
“Do you ever get invitations to things asking you to bring your boyfriend?” Dean asked curiously. He had no idea why anyone would think they were dating, but he’d gotten an increasing number of comments about Cas in the last few years that showed others assumed it. His personal life wasn’t something he flaunted at the office, and he knew he talked about Cas a lot, but he hadn’t though it made it sound like the scholar was his boyfriend.
It was nice, easy, and made Castiel feel very content.
Castiel cleared his throat and then he couldn’t help a laugh.
“Totally depends on how he handles this case that I know he’s actively working on.” Gabriel sounded amused though and then Cas heard the telltale noise of a candy wrapper. “Leave your hair alone. I bet he loves the messy bedhead look. Besides it gives you this fuck me vibe.”
Castiel would do anything he could to make sure Dean never  felt alone again. His familiar.
“Dean is an unrepentant flirt; you sure you wanna be on a date with him handsome?” she asked Castiel with a wink.
“Text him then…”
“Ohhh, Dean, you naughty boy,” she cooed.
“This is Castiel. Cas, this is Ellen, the owner of this fine establishment.” Dean grinned with a clearly playful air and a note of charm that made Castiel want to laugh. The woman looked old enough to be Dean’s mother.
//Nah, I’m good here. You take good care of me, and don’t mind that I’m a squirrel. At least I’m not a moose or something.//
Castiel just laughed against his mouth and slowly pulled back. “You know, if you were more Sober I’d take you back to my hotel.”
“Someone is eager,” Dean murmured and he moved over to sink his hand into Castiel’s hair, petting through it then down to squeeze his neck a moment gently. “Want a taste, sweetheart?”
“No,We use our feathers, our wings,” Cas started, he wanted to explain that angels didn’t give birth like humans though, they only found partners for preening and sometimes companionship.
He felt himself shift, the way the feathers puffed up a little at the praise that Dean was giving. It was silly, and Castiel logically knew that it shouldn’t matter what a human thought of his wings, but any other human would be running scared. Dean, though, was literally watching him with the most interested look in his face: not fear, not clinical, but actual open interest.
“I realized that everything was about her pleasure, and rarely about what I wanted or needed. At this point, we’d been together for over a year, and I was terrified to mess up. I didn't know how to get out. I was basically cowed by her. The only time I had freedom was at work.”
That cleansing spell had changed something; Castiel just couldn’t identify what. However, after that, the squirrel would sit on his shoulder during the day. Riding around, chittering softly from time to time. Still not talking, though. He wondered what restrained the familar’s voice. He hoped that one day he would hear it.
“Yes you do, I saw you look over at all of that stuff. We could build a pillow fort or something. What do you think?” Dean was, well that was just absurd, Castiel was very confused by him. He let his brow furrow up and then he cocked his head quietly.
Dean sank his fingers into those beautiful soft feathers at the same time that Cas got his fingers around his cock. “C...Cas!” He gasped out, as those lovely warm lips kissed the head of his cock. He sank back against the counter as Cas went down on him, sucking eagerly, using every skill that he had learned over the last few months to drive Dean mad.
Cas let his eyes flutter opened to meet the deep green before him and he let a little whimper leave his throat. “Dean…”
“Mostly? Help brush out the old feathers, and smooth and oil the new ones as they come in,” Castiel replied quietly.
//I suppose I could, Cas, just don’t leave me there.// Dean jumped up onto his shoulder, definitely the familiar’s favorite place now.
“How about we exchange them and go make out in my car?” Dean suggested, he wouldn’t be able to drive, his keys given up at the door since he wanted to drink. However, he’d left her unlocked, just for this reason.
“My faith is important to me, but I’m thankful that I have escaped the toxic environment I grew up in. I go to an LGBT friendly priest now. I would never ask my partner to change themselves just because I have that faith.” Castiel looked at him now and then he smiled softly. “It is a personal thing after all, so faith or not, if I truly care about them I would not ask them to change.”
Castiel didn’t know what to think, or if he should stop Dean. He knew how stubborn the man was. “Come on Cas, get up and use some of that angelic muscle an help me!” Dean startled him out of his thoughts, and Cas found himself helping move motel furniture. They pushed the two double beds together, making one very large bed with only a bit of a gap between them that Dean quickly solved by stuffing some squishy pillows into the space until it was almost as perfectly level as the mattresses.
“Thanks.” He sighed quietly and then he rolled his shoulders lazily. “So you’re going to steal my couch again, terrorize my cat for a while?”
The natural urge to please Sir was strong inside of him. Cas couldn’t even start to explain it, and Dean seemed to already trip so many of the buttons he loved to have touched.
The extreme sensitivity went directly to his cock though. He’d stopped thinking of the vessel as anything less than his a few days ago, when unable to control its reactions, his reactions, in the physical sense.
“Sounds wonderful,” Cas agreed and he let himself glance up at Dean, studying the other man. There was a happy smile on his lips.
“Heal me, I want to do this for you Cas, I wanna do it right.” Dean was determined then. He could hear the honesty. Cas nodded and pressed two fingers to Dean’s forehead, washing away fatigue and the alcohol in his system. Then he gently nudged Dean back some more. “I’m going to have to sit in a chair,” He admitted, “there isn’t space in the nest.”
“Oh, C, A, S, T, I, E, L.,” Castiel returned easily, not bothered. He’d grown up spelling the name and knew it could be worse. Cas could hear what sounded like a pen scratching on paper; he chewed his lip absently as he listened.
“Does next Thursday work for you?” Dean asked glancing up at him now. “Because she’s right, I do have the whole afternoon open now.”
“Mm, take a picture?” he asked softly now, sighing a little. The hand squeezed his neck then pulled away, and he almost whimpered at the loss of contact.
That got him a lovely little laugh from the angel, and for a moment, it seemed almost like bells were ringing. He didn’t know what was going on, how Cas was showing this part of himself that he’d kept hidden for so long. He’d never thought he’d get to see this part of Cas, glimpses over the years, but there was something so wonderful about this, getting to see him, the real him, even if it still was in this form. “What happened to me not being able to handle….”
Then there was the brilliant smile that made Dean’s heart pound harder. Why did Cas have to be so perfect? Why? Dean wouldn’t ever dare do anything to mess up their friendship by trying to take things further. It was far too precious to him.
Dean smiled and put the bottle of lubricant against his side, then one hand slid easily down to his hip, his fingers curled around and squeezed as the man leaned in to kiss him again. Castiel kissed back eagerly, leaning up into it before Dean’s lips left his again.
“I’ll use my word, Sir,” Castiel replied softly now.
Dean’s eyebrows furrowed together almost at once. That was so, firm and absolute, he found it hard to believe though. “Come on Cas, look you tell me about it once we have a room.” He said quietly and with surprising patience.
The darker haired man was quiet and quick to tug it up, reaching for Dean’s own with his other hand. The air felt intensely cooler now that his cheeks were uncovered. Dean felt, more than could see the way man’s breath caught and his cheeks started to warm significantly. “Cas?”
“Oh, do settle down,” he said with a chuckle, as the little squirrel wiggled around. Clearly it’d smelled what was being cooked. He placed the smaller version of the burger in front of the squirrel. It was still bigger than he’d give a normal squirrel, about half the size of his own, but the familiar (oh he did wish he knew its name) didn’t care, happily grabbing for the burger with his small paws and stuffing bites into his mouth until his cheek utterly bulged with the meat, bread and cheese.
Castiel blinked briefly at the human, the faithful man. He didn’t have a reply to that so he pushed forward. “I have an issue which needs to be dealt with, but I am unsure how you will feel about your body being involved.”
“Well, maybe I thought you’d be more comfortable if I took charge. You’re welcome to plan something if I was wrong.” Dean cocked his head.
“You kinda mentioned that before. It’s a big part of your life, then?” Dean asked curiously, but Castiel was thankful the man didn’t seem to stumble at the idea. He’d run off people just for being a religious studies student in college.
“It will be fine,” Castiel said quietly now. Sam likely wouldn’t get himself into any more trouble than he already was, though he was not going to upset Dean with any of it now. “I am feeling itchy again…”
The week passed with a number of flirty texts between them. Flirty texts that made Castiel look deeply forward to their second date. Then Dean demanded a picture of his tattoo on Friday and informed him that it looked fairly healed and that he was glad for it. Castiel couldn’t help a flush on his cheeks at that. He hoped it meant a little bit more intimacy for their date.
He took a slow breath, though Dean’s mouth was moving downwards along the length of his breastbone, soft and warm with no teeth, lips just brushing almost tenderly against his skin.  Castiel whimpered quietly now and then tried not to shift—he hadn't been told that he could after all, and he wanted to respect that.
“So Cas, you feel safe?” Dean asked happily, his cheeks were a bit rosier than before. Castiel knew the man would probably have a bit of a hangover in the morning. He’d have to find a way to discreetly heal it.
“Of course, feel free to come in and see us if you have any questions or issues,” Dean assured now as he wrote out the card properly.His handwriting was fairly neat if a bit angular and all capitals. Cas liked it.
“Thank you,” Castiel said quietly. The words felt strange on his lips, but he knew that he had what he needed: consent. And with that, he returned to his usual state of being and closed his eyes, trying to figure out where Dean Winchester might be.
“My dad gave her to me.” Dean patted the dash briefly and then buckled up before he shifted into drive. “‘67 Chevy Impala. Was a graduation present, didn’t expect it. He’s taught me everything I know about taking care of her.”
“Cas? I’m done, I’m just going to put some cream on it and place a light bandage on it. You’ll be able to remove it easily. Do you wanna see it, first?” Dean’s voice was low, steady, soothing, not meant in the slightest to jolt him out of the headspace he’d fallen into, but more to coax him to the surface once more.
Suddenly every eye in the room seemed to be on him.
It was so easy, he wanted this so badly, wanted Dean to do exactly as he was promising now. He didn’t want to think of anyone else, not at all. Not even a little. This was perfect, and his eyes fluttered closed for a bit, just feeling the way Dean brushed over him, he could feel his lips, the brush of his beard as Dean shifted to nuzzle against his hip.
“The way to a man’s heart is through his stomach,” Castiel returned with a smirk. That just earned him a little laugh though, not that he minded Dean laughing at his poor joke. It was at least partly true, after all.
“It does.” Castiel shifted to tug his wallet out quietly. “I owe a deposit, yes?”
“Why don’t you open up that bottle of wine so it can breath while I finish all this up,” Dean suggested, pointing at a specific drawer. “Corkscrew is in there,” he murmured as he reached for the strainer once again, shaking it a little before depositing the potatoe wedges on some paper towels and quickly shaking the contents of a shaker over them.
“What the hell, man?”
It was a gentle dismissal. Castiel almost wanted to ask for something else, just to stay, but this was not the time for that. No, he told himself, Dean was providing a service to him right now, and he didn’t even know if the artist himself was into men. It would be presumptuous of him to attempt to get a date out of Dean without even learning that much.
“I can’t,” Dean said as if reading his mind, and then he stroked his jaw gently. “There is a lot we have to talk about before I can do that,” he whispered.
Maybe Dean wouldn’t remember in the morning. Maybe this wouldn’t mess everything up.
He listened as Dean got on the phone to talk to his brother, finding this natural, comfortable. He smiled quietly into his coffee and sipped it.
Shortly they had refilled their coffee cups, and there were a pair of full plates on the island. Dean settled onto the stool next to Castiel. He reached out to tug one closer to himself and couldn’t resist biting into a slice of bacon, delighted at the crispy cook and how it melted into his mouth.
“You should see your face, Man! Castiel, I love you. I love you so fucking much! Hahahaha!”
Aglibol doesn’t understand his tie with the moon, or how he’s supposed to manipulate it, draw power from it. When it happened, it happened. 'Could of used some of that juice a moment ago', he thinks to himself. When he had been told his title and been assigned to it, he didn’t ask questions, not caring at all. God of the Moon. How tacky of a title was that for an angel of the Lord? What had irked him the most was when many started to convince him that he was an actual God, and that he should stop fighting alongside other angels, and instead start to lead them, control them and talk down to them. But after watching the anguish that Castiel had gone through, when Metatron was manipulating the puppet strings in Chuck’s absence, forcing him to lead when Cas was uncomfortable with the idea..
Sam somehow manages to get up, and goes to Jack. He tries comforting him, but Jack backs away and looks up at Sam, guiltily. Sam knows how much Jack and Castiel meant to one-another and he attempts to comfort Jack, who is shaking his head, disbelieving.
Dean can now be heard yelling Castiel’s name, as Cas lies dead in his arms. Begging, pleading, for one more chance at happiness…a chance to finally let Castiel into his heart….
-The End
“Nope, Er-um. Heh, Heh. We don’t exactly have…” Castiel interrupts Dean, addressing the children.
“Dean. Dean…Mmm” He starts to thrust upwards, and Dean holds his hips in place, stilling him. Castiel trembles and Dean smiles against him.
"I promise." Dean reaches up and touches Castiel’s face, just when..
Jack just stands there, miserable, hopeless. Understanding the situation completely…The Shadow. Castiel’s moment of happiness....He starts crying.
When Dean makes it to the bed, Castiel slowly reaches out for him…
Castiel was of course the same angel he was before he died, only now that the time had come where he could officially rest (He'd insist on working occasionally, a safe distance from harm), he'd requested to experience some of what it was like to be human, especially when he was with Dean.
“What do you mean, for us? Did you....” Cas finally takes his eyes off of Dean to look down at the valley, far below. “Oh! Dean, it's beautiful. Stunning!” Dean's giddy over Castiel's reaction.
"Thank you Daddy..You're beautiful Daddy. So perfect, so big and strong. Such a big cock. I almost choked on it Daddy..." Dean grunts and his stomach spasms and Castiel automatically opens his mouth and tilts his chin upwards.
"Jack! I can’t believe it. We thought you were gone. We thought.."
“Hey Cool! You’re the Red Hood! Awesome! And you’re Constantine! And you’re
"What, nothing? Didn't you get to play?..." Dean starts thrusting his hips forward and Castiel watches, mesmerized, as Dean lets go of his cock and starts bouncing it around in front of Castiel's face. He can't help but reach for it, while licking his lips. Dean laughs.
Dean had prayed to Jack, before he and Castiel had set out for their hike. The scenery Castiel had been praising and admiring just now, matched what would be a real-life version of the Great Valley, from
"A vampire holding you down to the ground, snapping at your face and all Castiel does is turn around and head in the opposite direction saying ‘He’ll be right back’, like your life isn’t in jeopardy or anything?!?! You could’ve been killed! If Aglibol and I hadn’t been here..." He turns to face Castiel, seething. "Hey, you know what? Why am I even surprised, though!? It’s not like it was DEAN WINCHESTER neck to neck with a blood sucking.."
“Wait here, please.”
He quickly disappears down the stairs and into the kitchen. The kids lower their arms and look just as confused as Dean and Sam. Dean lowers the knife and tries to hide it. One of the kids is suspicious, thinking the whole procedure is taking too long.
********
And what will be the most torturous moment of Castiel’s life, he leaves the bunker and exits Dean’s life for the final time..
"Sam, it’s good to see you. I’m sorry I left without saying goodbye." Cas doesn’t know what to do. He now feels he should leave. But his feet won’t cooperate and Sam is gripping his shoulders, too tightly. He thinks to himself 'I’ll make you both regret keeping me. Why do care so much about me, after all I’ve put you through?'
"I love you so much….father.." It’s just barely a whisper, but the results of that word are....
"Sam! Tell me what’s going on, now!" Sam just shakes his head and knocks on Dean’s bedroom door. There’s no answer. Sam sighs sadly, and opens the door.
I wanted to. But you know you still have an aversion to certain electronic devices. It was easier just to...”
“Dean..I didn’t have a choice.” Dean stands and moves towards Castiel. Feeling Dean’s sorrow wash over him, Castiel turns around to stop Dean with his hands, wincing at the warmth coming from his body.
"Where is he? WHERE THE HELL IS HE?!?!" They all search the halls and the bedrooms, thinking Cas may have looked for a place to take cover. Then they hear a wail come from the other room.
“Hey! Get away from that thing!!!” Sam starts to make his way towards the kid holding the decapitated head.
“Cas! What the hell happened!? Are you okay?!” Sam shoots Cas a look of concern.
Cas leans against the door, thinking to himself 'He’s in so much pain. He believes he’s in the wrong, that he was wrong to speak to me the way he did that night. It isn’t fair. Dean…Don’t you realize the reason it hurt so badly to say the things you did, is because they were true?' He turns around and tries to make up his mind. Was it a mistake, coming back to the bunker? He could go back into hiding. Maybe contact Anael, if she was still alive…
-The End
"Castiel? Are you alright?" Cas drops the machete and puts his hands on either side of his head, his temples throbbing. He closes his eyes. Aglibol puts a hand on Castiel’s arm, not really knowing what else to do.
"Dean?" Castiel, Dean, and Sam turn their heads towards Dean’s bedroom door. Jack stands there staring right back at them. He looks amazed to see them, to be alive. For a moment he thinks it’s a trick. He looks towards Billie who just closes her eyes. Jack senses she’s irritated….because they broke the rules. For him, for his family...He beams, and looks back to his three fathers. "Sam! It’s me. It’s really me! I’m home."
“Do you remember when I said that the fight happened closer to home, this time? Well, I should have specified…”
“You got in trouble, for me. So much trouble..” Castiel bites his lip and reaches overhead to clutch onto the head board.
"Sam, please! There is no time!" Without asking anymore questions all four of them sprint down the hall and turn the corner towards the panic room. They see rubble start to fall from the ceiling and can hear things crashing to the floor, in other rooms. When they reach the panic room door, Dean and Sam struggle to get it open, together.
When Sam and Dean see the “decorations”, they pale. About ten zombie corpses lie scattered all over the grass and dirt road, decapitated, their heads separated from their bodies. The moon reflecting off of the splattered blood, gave the impression of light up decorations, or glitter. One kid walks over to one of the heads and picks it up…
Castiel opens his eyes to the sound of footsteps. He turns his head towards the barn doors. There’s a creak and the sounds of the barn shifting and humming, in response to Dean’s touch, and the barn doors open wide. Castiel slowly sits up in bed and just stares back at Dean Winchester, who glows against the light of the moon, which seems to pour in from the outside, though there is still a soft glow coming from the opening in the roof. Castiel gets out of bed and takes a step forward.
“Dean. Once I leave…depending on how much time would pass between our calls…to hear your voice again…it could…” Castiel chokes on a sob and takes a deep breath. “Did you mean what you said, just now? The thing that you need most is for me to live? To die after you?”…Castiel finally allows himself to look at Dean Winchester, perhaps for the last time in his existence. Dean has never looked so defeated and weak. Never so heartbroken. There was so much pain in his heart, and it was Castiel’s doing. Dean nods, almost unwillingly, in answer.
“I got it, Cas!”
Dean comes across a beaten path, leading into the woods. The second he enters to explore, the path is lit up by the moon, shining brightly through the trees. A perfect scene and set-up. The trees seem to sparkle and the sound of crickets and frogs fill the air.
"Castiel, NOW!!!! Quit stalling…" Finally, Cas raises the machete high over his head and strikes, decapitating the vampire. Blood squirts from its neck and gets all over Lailah’s pant legs.
"Aw Man, Whoever it was sure as hell knew what he/she was doing. I’ve never seen a cut this clean, before. Check it out!" Castiel leans lower to get a closer look. He tilts his head to the side and then notices the set of footprints near the body. He starts. Castiel’s face goes white. Aglibol looks at him, concerned.
Castiel calmly walks up to the vampire with a machete in his right hand. Since working with hunters Sam and Dean Winchester over the years, Cas had found himself experimenting, trying new weapons, switching out his angel blade for the store of weapons Dean and Sam had kept in the back of the truck he was up until recently “borrowing.” Before he had abandoned the truck to join up with the few angels who still trusted him, who still considered him as a friend, Castiel had taken his pick of weapons and stored them in Aglibol’s jeep.
"Castiel?!" Cas looks up the stairs to see Sam carrying a six pack of beer. He looks shocked to see Cas standing by the door. "You’re back!" He runs down the stairs and crushes Cas into a hug. Cas can’t help but return the hug, burrying his face into Sam’s shoulder.
"Look, I just…don’t understand why you were so chill, a moment ago. Alright? You seem…careless lately. Like you wouldn’t even care if we died…I thought we were your friends." Castiel’s light dims. His eyes go back to normal and he blinks as if trying to remember where he is. Aglibol takes a tentative step towards Cas.
I put up a sign saying we weren’t giving out candy. Why did you come to our door?” The children all look surprised, by Sam's words and one tries talking (patiently) with Sam, in order to get him to understand.
"I...I'm not a boy, Sir." Dean's cheeks burn red, but Castiel doesn't notice. "I...um....turned 18 only yesterday....and..."
“Cas. Wait there for me..” Dean watches Castiel fall to the ground, his knees giving out from underneath him. He wants to run to him, but instead takes his time. Step by step.
"Change of plans. Dean’s time isn’t up yet. Sorry. You’ll just have to collect on him another time." Even in the face of death, Sam is grinning from ear to ear. Billie shakes her head, almost sorry for what’s about to happen next.
"Why the hold up!?!?!?! You said you would be right fucking back!!" Jophiel moves towards Cas, but Lailah holds onto his arm.
“I don’t know. They almost look like those things we wiped out in Michigan, last month.”
“Um, what?” He and Castiel look at each other.
"Where’s Cas? He can’t still be out there!?!" Dean is pounding at the door in agony. Jack's face pales as he finally realizes what's going on.
"Nevermind. You answered my question. When you get to your next Daddy's house..." Castiel's face turns red, as Dean continues..."Give him his pizza, take his money, and then go to your knees in front of him and open your mouth. If he doesn't drag you inside his place, crawl in and beg him for his milk. Tell him you need it. You want to taste your Daddy. Then, stick out your tongue." Castiel and Dean stare at each other for a moment, and then Castiel smiles in gratitude.
"Uh, sure thing Cassie. After we burn the bodies, we’ll all….Hey!!!…." Castiel has already turned to head back to the jeep parked by the side of the road. The others run to catch up with him. Jophiel can't help but feel frustrated again. He tries reasoning with Cas.
“WOW! The expensive stuff, too!” The other two children agree, excitedly. They each accept a candy bar and say "Thank you!", in unison. Dean stares at Cas with a little admiration, but also questioningly. Of the three of them to be prepared for this sort of scenario…Cas looks up at him, sadly. ‘Jack' he mouths.
"Be able to keep their children safe. They would know what’s out there and have a chance at….at seeing their children grow up. They could save themselves from the torture that comes with outliving their own offspring, and then maybe he wouldn’t have had to…He wouldn’t…" Castiel doesn't want to believe what he just saw, or what he thinks he just saw. To himself: 'Dean. You would never…you would have tried to find his maker. Or you would have helped him learn to steal hospital blood, like Benny…it wasn’t you. It couldn’t have been you..He was too young, you wouldn't....' Castiel starts shaking. He refuses to cry in front of his friends, again. Tears well up in his eyes, but Castiel tries taking deep breaths, to calm himself, keeping them from falling. He doesn't understand any of this. It doesn't make sense. His throat catching, he just stands there, seething… 'Dean, how could you?..'
“Yeah, whatever. So, are you alright?” (There’s genuine concern in his voice now). He and Sam sit down again, figuring there was nothing that they could really do for Cas when he was beat down, like this. His vessel would re-charge and clean itself off, overnight. “You’re a mess.”
They both look around at the warding that Bobby and Dean had put up, when bracing themselves for Castiel’s “attack.” While Castiel updated the living spaces, he kept the character of the barn in-tact, and the warding was exactly as Dean remembered it. He wonders for a moment whatever happened to the real barn, on earth. Castiel brings him back to heaven, by kissing his temple, sweetly. Dean tackles Castiel, pinning him against the bed. Cas laughs out loud, and Dean's heart swells. He brings his lips to Castiel’s ear and whispers…
"Um...is it....is it alright if I use your sink? I have another delivery before I can punch out and go home to take a shower." Dean thinks for a minute and then smiles meanly.
Castiel’s face is frozen in shock, …and fear. His lips have parted open, and he’s shaking violently. Cas lets out a gasp that comes out as a cry, his eyes wide. Jack slowly steps away from Sam and Dean and goes towards Castiel, who is panting heavily, as if struggling to breathe.
Dean howling on the floor. Screaming Castiel’s name. Even miles away, Castiel can still hear Dean praying, begging him to turn around. To come home.
Time apparently doesn’t seem to exist in heaven. You get the luxury of night and day, stormy weather and cloudless skies, depending on what Dean figures accounted for a resident’s mood, or wish. And the setting was almost perfect…
Castiel can’t look Dean in the eyes after what he just admitted, after what he’s finally confessed to the man he swore he’d never keep secrets from again. Dean raises his hands to cling at Castiel’s wrists. Cas tries to break away and Dean pulls him in, nuzzling into Castiel’s temple, trying desperately to express the words he’s now never allowed to speak to his true angel, to his heart and his life. He had missed so many opportunities in the past to be truly happy, and now it was too late. Castiel closes his eyes and winces at the feel of Dean’s love for him. He tries so hard to ignore it…
"Yeah, Baby. Good sub. Such a good submissive. Sucking my dick like a pro, and still just a baby...Stroke it. Work my dick with your hand while you suck.." Castiel obliges and grips Dean's dick slightly as he starts to pump. His lips spread wider over the head, as he takes more of Dean in his mouth. Dean sees the shine of the wet all over Castiel's face from sweating and he laughs meanly.
"Wondering about your tip, boy?" Castiel hopes that Dean can't see him trembling.
"Cas, please..please.."
“Yes…” Unwilling to let Castiel go, but at the same time wanting nothing more than to know he’d be safe from the Empty, from eternal darkness and dreamless sleep, for all eternity. “I won’t bury you again..I won’t hear of your death again, it would kill me…but Cas, please. I…I…” He’s afraid to say it out loud, afraid of what it might do. Castiel’s body sways sickly. If the wall weren’t there to hold him up…
Sam collapses at the foot of the stairs, broken.
“You don't think, er....it looks a bit...er-hem, familiar?” Cas looks over at Dean, and then back to face the view. He furrows his brows for a moment and then a familiar scowl covers his face. He sits back, with his arms crossed over his chest.
"Dirty Boy. Naughty...Little whore, little bitch boy. Sucking cock." Castiel puts both hands on Dean's hips and without thinking, swallows Dean's dick whole, devouring him hungrily. He starts to suck and bob his head. Dean roars out loud, clasping the back of Castiel's head and gripping hard.
“Freeze Freaks! We're…Um...Wha..?” Three painted children’s faces look up at him calmly. They’re wearing Walgreen’s-bought costumes and all dressed like Darth Maul. One has a staff and a pumpkin trick-or-treat basket. The other two have giant pillow cases.
"Move away!" Jack's eyes glow yellow and he raises his hand. Sam and Dean part, just as Jack blasts the doors open. Both Jack and Sam run inside.
Castiel lays down on a bed set up in the barn that he recently built, with Jack’s permission. His legs tangled in the sheets, pajama bottoms hanging off of his hips and a top buttoned lazily and messily. Hair mussed and eyes glazed over, Castiel looks up through the broken pieces of the barn’s ceiling, and catches a shooting star pass overhead.
"Drop off? Who could you possibly want to…"
“You promised me. You promised you’d never leave again…I won’t let you go..We’ll find a way. We have to…I have to…” Cas whimpers and presses his face into Dean’s neck and Dean leans against him. Weak, his knees give out and he falls to Cas’s feet. He clings to Castiel’s legs and Cas starts trembling, tears streaming down his face.
