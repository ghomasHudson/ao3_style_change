“I kind of thought that might be the case, but I didn’t want to pry.” He turned, offered her a salute. “It’s an honor to be on the team with you, I think you should know.”
“Do you ever wonder-”  Tony says when he notes Steve's arrival “what it's like for other couples, couples who aren't as well known as we are?”
“Oh hey wha-” Tony flails, but Steve is there before any elbows can hit groins. He catches Tony in something that might be reminiscent of a bridal carry, and Tony starts laughing, looping an arm around Steve's neck and snuggling close.
“C'mon Tony, what's this about? Did something happen? Did that Hammer asshole call you or something?” Steve is getting a frankly murderous glint in his eyes. Tony can't help but laugh, it seems the name 'Hammer' is perpetually attached to asshole in Steve's mind.
Come morning Steve goes for his customary jog. Even though sleep was short the previous night he feels fairly well rested. A side effect of the serum dutifully running through his veins. Still he's up slightly later than usual, and after showering he makes it down to the main kitchen just in time to see Thor take the last apple fritter. He knows it's Tony's favorite, but Thor and his food are parted just about as easily as a bear and a ham-hock.
Hours later the team congregates around a wide conference table discussing everything that went wrong as well as everything that did work. Jan is in the middle of illustrating the solid kick she landed on Doctor Doom's pointy chin when Iron man walks in wearing an armor Steve has yet to see.
“Tony,” Steve grits out in a voice that makes Tony want to do anything but but behave. Still a no is a no, Tony can take a hint. So he puts his hands properly back on the table, stealing another kiss just because he can, and leaning back in his seat to play footsie under the table like a good forties boy.
Seventy years. He's been in the ice for seventy years. The sheer weight of it feels heavier than the water slamming into his chest. It feels as if it happened yesterday, but It was
Inside the room, the little red box from the cuff-links was sitting on his dresser where he’d left it in the morning.  It was empty, empty because Tony accepted his gift.  Maybe not directly, and maybe Steve’s intentions weren’t clear, but Tony kept them all the same.  Tony looked so sweet, so sweet the way he’d held the cuff-links, the way he almost seemed to treasure them.  It felt as if there was a hand around Steve’s heart, when he held them out, Steve was well prepared to have his heart broken.  The way it had been in the past, when he’d held out a gift, or poured his intentions into a letter.  But Tony, he hadn’t done that.  He could have dashed Steve’s hopes so easily, but here Steve was, with an empty box instead.
“You're a legend, you know? The world needs you. The Avengers need you. Sometimes the only thing you
“You drive like a maniac, Rogers, I approve.”  Tony said, pushing his sunglasses further up the bridge of his nose, leaning down to grab a briefcase from the rumble seats in the back.
“I do, god, I do, so much sweetheart.” Steve grits out, and Tony shuts his eyes, slapping the holograms away and bracing both hands on the desk to roll their hips together. Even through the thick fabric of his pants it feels incredible. Having Tony writhing against him always does.
“They are your memories, do you see them?” That voice is smooth as glass, but Tony feels it like an ice-pick between his eyes, and he crawls up onto his knees, falling down to an elbow near the water's edge when his body refuses to cooperate. Faces shimmer in that deep blue, it terrifies him for some reason, that calm stretch of water; wood planks of a barrel at the bottom, not sand-but he reaches for it anyway
“It does.” Tony blurts out, finally registering Steve's earlier question while his brain was busy rebooting itself.
“If I might say sir, you are always quite fancy, have we exceeded a particular baseline?” JARVIS snarks, and Tony just points at the flowers pinned to his lapel with an expansive gesture.
“Hats? What sort of hats, is this one of your Midgardian customs?” Thor asks, curiosity evident in his tone.  Tony nods solemnly, reaching into one of his pockets to produce a Santa hat; plopping the red and white cap atop his own head.
The flight back to New York was quiet, until the beeping of an incoming call cut through the silent hum of the engines. It was Tony, Steve could see him in the preview window projected on the glass of the cockpit. He was clearly at work, Steve recognized his fancy desk. He was holding a delicate cappuccino cup in his ringed fingers, and frowning down at one of his skinny little tablets. Steve felt his stomach sink, he hoped his teammates weren’t worrying about him.
“Yes, yes please, I will be, I'll be-I'll be good.” He wants to be good for Tony, to keep his hands wherever Tony puts them, to earn the praise Tony lavishes him with seemingly without thought. It would take almost no effort on his part to snap the bonds Tony is suggesting, it just means he has to work harder for it. Tony must know by now how he likes to earn things, how he likes to work to please Tony. He flings his hand up against the headboard, and clutches around the metalwork with his other hand.
Tony stares at him for a long moment of silence before responding.“This is all I want, you are everything I want.  Steve, honey, do I look like there is anywhere else I would rather be than with you?” Tony doesn’t wait for a response, choosing instead to lean in and capture Steve’s lips in a kiss.  It eases the tension from them both almost immediately. Tony is such a good kisser, Steve could write essays about how well he kisses, the way he makes him feel hot and molten at his core with just a brush of his lips, as if he could never feel cold again.  “Oh darling, I’ve been dreaming of spending time with you like this.” He speaks against Steve’s lips, into the minuscule amount of space between them. Steve slips both hands beneath the robe, and pulls him in for another kiss.
The click of a cap, and then everything fizzles out into hot syrupy pleasure. Tony shifts around and with a careful but deft motion slowly begins working the toy into him. It's so much smaller than Tony's cock, and Tony has all but drenched it in slippery lube, but Steve loves the feeling of something inside him, the way his body has to stretch around it, and Tony knows it. He hasn't exactly been subtle about it, especially when Tony fucks him. He had been a bit self-conscious about it at first, but Tony always makes him feel so good, praising him and making everything feel so incredible that he can't help but ask for it time and again. This is no different. Tony's free-hand is rubbing small circles on his hip. It's such a small gesture-and Steve doesn't need the soothing, the toy slides in easily, so easily-but it's so sweet, such an affectionate gesture combined with the toy nudging up against his prostate and the dizzying feeling of Tony taking him so far down his throat that Steve distantly worries about his breathing. It's so much pleasure, so much, but Tony has him, he doesn't have to be in control, or contain himself. He lets that roll through him, lets himself moan and gasp, and make whatever sounds he wants, lets himself sink that hazy space he knows so well now.
“Níðhöggr you have no business on Midgard, return whence you came!” Thor's booming voice has never been so welcome. The beast stills, head raising to stare over at Thor with dark void filled eyes. It speaks then, but Steve can't make heads or tails of what's being said, it's definitely not English. Thor understands though, his face growing thunderous as his namesake.  “Release him and return, or face the wrath of a son of Odin, beast.” That as it turns out was not the right thing to say. It lunges at Thor, but the he meets it head on, the sound of them clashing blowing back debris and trees with the force of it. Hawkeye is knocked from his perch, but he clambers to an outcropping of rocks to fire arrows at a blindingly fast speed. Widow and Captain Marvel join the fray moments later, and the clearing lights up with the crackle of power.
“So,” She said, “Tony told me you didn’t know, so, in the interests of full disclosure, I’m an omega too.” She said it with such matter of factness, but she still looked a little cautious. He wondered if Tony’d told her how Steve collapsed on him like a giant mess. He hoped not. That hardly served as a glowing endorsement of his worthiness as an Avenger, he thought.
Steve wakes on a chilly Saturday morning to an empty bed. It's not unusual for Tony to be gone in the mornings. Sometimes he's still down in the lab, other times it's because he awoke some time during the night with ideas buzzing through his mind. It wouldn't be unusual, however, Steve has been gone for the last week on a mission with Natasha. Typically when he returns from one of those, Tony greets him with a whirlwind of kisses and wandering hands. He had not even stirred when Steve crawled into bed with him last evening.
“C'mon, up then.” Steve says, completely shocking the hell out of Tony by giving his ass a playful pat and then urging him up. He firmly resolves to cop a feel when the chance presents itself next. Amazing. Steve Rogers got a hand on his ass without turning beet red. Tony squints at him suspiciously once he's on his feet; socked toes digging into the plush rug beneath him.
“What, seriously, I mean I thought the two of you might have something going on-” Tony's words cut off when he finds himself on the receiving end of a glare that all but screams for him to shut up. Given that it's Natasha glaring he wisely chooses to snap his mouth closed and slurp at his glass instead. Steve is staring too though, one of his hands dropping to pat Tony's thigh companionably.
“You're going to be incredible.” Steve says as if he heard nothing of the last sentence. Tony just blinks when Steve leans in close to pin an anemone flower and a pale pink rose to the lapel of his tux.
“Cap get out of the-” Iron Man sets the segments of the bus down, hands coming up, but he is too slow. Iron Man catches a Doombot to the chest with enough force to send him rolling backward.
“Because a leanbh, I’m an alpha too.”  Her voice was so gentle, understanding, and of course she would understand.
“Then yeah, yeah I'd like for you to do that. Warmer too if you could please.” The sound and the smell of the heater cutting on answers his request. The lighting changes as well, going from pitch black to the sort of warm tone Steve remembers filtering in through his thin curtains in a ratty little apartment in Brooklyn.  “Thanks JARVIS, that. That helps. Thank you.” After that it's a little easier to fall asleep, and the dreams aren't as cold. He wakes up with the vaguest impressions of dreaming of wide brown eyes, and the smell of mint and expensive cologne, but it's gone before he can truly register it.
It doesn't take long to make it there. Steve gets momentarily sidetracked by a magazine left laying around. Tony is on the cover. His camera ready smile is on, but his eyes are guarded. The article is an interesting one though, and never let it be said that Tony Stark gives a boring interview.
People stand to speak about the man he loves, will always love-but Steve can't hear them over the rushing in his ears. Beside him, Natasha takes his hand. He thinks at some point he speaks too, but everything seems unreal, as if he's detached from his body and is just watching himself go through the motions from far away. When the folded flag is passed into his keeping the woven fabric feels dead in his hands, numbness seeping inwards to lodge somewhere just behind his heart. Steve clutches it close and imagines that somewhere Tony is laughing about Maria Hill having said nice things about him.
"Don't worry about it."  Tony says on a yawn-and Steve watches with bemusement, and admittedly a tiny sliver of jealousy as Thor tears a piece of the doughy sweet off and holds it out to Tony on his fork. Who eats bread with a fork anyway? Tony however seems unperturbed by the gesture, shrugging and happily accepting the bites he's offered-sipping his coffee in between.
Tony groans in frustration, rubbing a hand over his face and snagging one of his motion sculptures off of a nearby desk for something to do with his shaking hands. They're cold again, nailbeds turning slightly purple with chill. Tony puts the sculpture back down to shake his hands out, rubbing them over his pant legs to encourage circulation. Rhodey stays quiet, sipping his beer and eyeing him patiently.
“Coordinates!” Tony repeats, and then he’s sinking down, head in his hands as he sobs, tears spilling through his fingers to leave specks of moisture on damp sand. Rhodey holds him until the tremors stop, until his grief simmers into something quiet and barren-a sucking wound where his heart should be. Tony will find him, it’s the least he can do. His soulmate has left him a map, in stars, in numbers, in the shifting shadows of a sunken plane.
!” Tony shouts more loudly than he intended. He drags himself to his feet on unsteady legs, unable to look Steve in the face and see the inevitable disappointment there. “I leave and the show is over-they want a Tony Stark Performance. I leave now and that's less water treatment plants, less of everything. I leave now and that's blood on my hands Steve.”
“Can you still get in touch with him?” Natasha cuts in, startling them both. He had almost forgotten the rest of the team was still there.
“Don't steal my vegetables.” Bruce says mildly, eyeing Tony's hand creeping towards a plate of sliced raw produce.
“Stay?” Tony says quietly. He can't mean that, and Steve's not going to take advantage of someone clearly not in a fully conscious state of mind. He sighs, running a hand through Tony's hair and leaning down to just barely brush his lips over the top of Tony's head.  His hair smells softly scented, Steve wants to rub his cheek against it, wants to stay, maybe if Tony was fully in his faculties, but he's not.
“Then why me?”  Steve repeated, not understanding how this made him a good candidate in the slightest.
The first thing he did after eating and going for a jog, he was not proud of. He went to his room, unlocked his tablet, and searched for Tony’s Rolling Stone cover.
Someone is singing a distance away, the accent escapes him, but he remembers this song. Pancakes, the blue eyed man makes them and sings when he thinks he's alone; old soldier's songs painful with memory and longing. He knows he pretends not to hear, because they are friends, and these wounds are still healing.
“I already agreed to go to the game, read up on our team and everything.”  Steve said, continuing on with as much earnestness as he could muster.  Tony’s eyes went a little wider, his mouth opened and then shut.  “Just give me a moment and I’ll be packed in a jiffy.  Say, how do you think I can bring my shield?”
“That’s what we were about to ask you!”  Iron Man said, then tilted his head, Steve felt the strangest impression that he was being measured up.  “We won the war alright, if it’s the one I think you’re asking about, but, you can’t be Captain America, can you?”  Iron Man’s voice was metallic, but Steve realized suddenly that there might be a person in there.  There had to be.  His bearing, the hesitation in his voice, Steve didn’t think it was possible for a robot to do all that.  Maybe it was just wishful thinking, a vain hope things were not so alien, that there was a man beneath all that sleek metal, that Iron Man wasn’t a robot at all.  Just as that hope took root, the room tilted, alarms blared, a mechanical sounding voice declaring the presence of hostiles.
“We're Avengers Tony, walking into danger is what we do.” Steve can see his reasoning falling on deaf ears already.
“Yes. Yes, it's good.” Tony says, dragging in a long inhale of breath. Steve shifts beneath him, going in for another kiss. Tony meets him eagerly, tangling their tongues together and groaning as Steve braces his palm across the small of Tony's back, beneath his shirt. His hand feels hot, branding, as if Tony will always feel it there. Steve nips at his lips, slipping his other hand up Tony's back to press between his shoulder blades, and then Tony finds himself being flipped down onto soft couch cushions in a move so artful it could have been pulled from his own seduction playbook.
“Go to sleep Tony, you're tired.” He grumbles, wrapping one arm a little more tightly around the warm well muscled body pressed against his.  Tony laughs, but his eyes drop shut with a soft huff of breath when Steve runs his fingers through his hair.
“Love you Steve, I just. Yeah. Can we go watch a movie? I know it's early, and you have things to do-” The last thing he wants to do right now is go lay in an empty bed with his thoughts. His mind is a riot of anxiety and ugly memories, but Steve is smiling, as if his request isn't pathetic at all.
“God, you're so beautiful sweetheart.” Steve says, voice low with arousal and reverence. Tony's not one to blush, but Steve talking about him like that? His ears are red, but he gets up onto his elbows, looks back at Steve-Steve who is also on his stomach, right up between Tony's parted thighs. His lips are red and wet, blue eyes blown in the half darkness of the room. As he watches, Steve leans in, slips his hands up to spread Tony open. The breath freezes in his chest as he watches Steve's tongue dip out, and then he's licking at him, testing, and oh Steve has never done this to him before.
“Well you know-” Tony starts conversationally, “if we were uh-courting-then I think I would get a goodbye kiss for the road too.” He finishes with a cheeky little grin. Well. Steve's never been one to back down from a challenge.
“Good night, beloved, please do dream of me.”  Tony whispers, going quiet after that. His breaths even out and deepen within only a few minutes while Steve lays there staring out at the darkness.  He must have been so tired. The dark here though, It isn't the way the dark is back in his empty cold room. This is warm, comfortable, here with everything he could ever want pressed right up along his back.  He slips a hand down to frame Tony's where it rests lax and relaxed against his abdomen now, and twines their fingers together. He's not truly tired any longer not the way he feels when he finally falls into bed back at his place, and usually he would get up, go to the gym or go for a run, do something physical to distract himself, but he wants to sleep, wants to sink into this feeling of safety and finally being home.  So he does, closing his eyes and focusing on the luxurious weave of the sheets, the perfect angle of the pillow beneath his cheek, and most of all the comfort of Tony being here with him. He loves him, he knows he does. There's no point in pretending otherwise now.
The halls were empty, dark, and silent when he walked through them, but lit up as he began walking.  Motion sensing lights, well, wasn’t that something.  He remembered where Iron Man had said the gym was, and although the house was massive, it was not as confusing as Steve would have thought.  It seemed to be designed with ease of movement and efficiency in mind.
“Yeah well, these meager charms popped you right in the kisser, so watch yourself.” Doom looks incredibly unimpressed, staring him down as if he really can't believe what Steve is saying. “It's not for lack of trying, he's so stubborn! I don't know what to do!” Steve cries, throwing his arms up. Doom tsks under his breath.
“Yeah okay, mhmmm...going, doing that.” Tony's words drop off sleepily.  Steve feels him shiver in response to his gentle light touches, but he doesn't comment, content for now to rub between strong shoulder-blades, until Tony is nuzzling his chest sleepily and his breaths even out as he drops off.
Even the ocean cannot keep them apart forever though. Their connection has bloomed now, with time, and maturity, and a soul-deep longing they both echo. And so Steve sees him in his own dreams, floating and timeless as they are. He traces his shape in the churches of his childhood, holds him close beneath the chill of the water, so close he can almost feel his soulmate's warmth. Again and again they find each other, like comets streaking across the sky in differing paths, or stars pulled into each others orbit. He sees his soulmate bent over schematics, and again standing at a building site holding plans, and again along a cold shoreline pounding with a frothy, angry surf.
“Thank you, good, just stay like that. Just like that.” Just the rumble of his voice, the way Tony is looking at him as he scoots up-and he's so bare, wet between his legs with lube when he sits up atop Steve's thighs-it feels like he's burning up, that heat just growing as Tony loops the tie of his robe around Steve's wrist, and positions pillows to give him a place to rest his arms. “Gorgeous,” Tony breathes out, skating his hands over Steve's chest, pausing to pinch and roll pink nipples between his fingers. A moan bursts from Steve's mouth as Tony teases him there, and then his hands move on, stroking over his ribs, and down over his hips. “your nipples are so pretty, so pink and sweet, I could just suck on them all day.” Tony says, almost to himself. Steve just groans, feeling himself flush even more deeply.
“I get the idea.”  He said, then took one of Tony’s gloved hands in his, and pressed a kiss to his knuckles.  The crowd went wild, but Steve could barely hear them.  Tony was staring at him, his mouth a little open, Steve kissed his hand one more time for good measure, and then turned to wave at the camera, tucking Tony’s arm against his side, curling their fingers together.  Tony’s hand felt warm against his, he squeezed it, and Tony squeezed back.  There were camera flashes everywhere.
“Uh thanks, sorry, I just um.” He stammers, feeling a little hot around the ears with embarrassment.  Rhodes just raises a knowing eyebrow, jerking his chin at Tony's turned back. Steve tries not to look guilty-probably failing miserably if the look Rhodes gives him in response is any indication.
.' Steve thinks the gesture that follows that is definitely not standard ASL. Clint's probably just sore because he lost the betting pool again.
Wordlessly JARVIS lets him into the room, bringing the lights up to a warm glow similar to candlelight. The bedcovers are flung back as if Tony had tossed them off in a rush. Mint, the whole room smells like mint. Steve notes the jar of the same scented cream still sitting on the night stand. There's much more missing than the last time.
Steve was about to reply when a glowing green figure appeared, barreling towards them at high speed, only to be intercepted by Thor.  After that it was a whirlwind of a fight.  Steve dodged blows between getting civilians safely off the bridge.  The rush was on him in force, the world sharpening into bright colors, time seeming to slow.  Each of the villains the team fought seemed to have some kind of personal vendetta, with the exception of the one they called Melter, who seemed to be searching for-there was a boom, and then a high whining sound interrupted his thoughts, a concussive blast blew Melter straight back into Radioactive Man.
“Hey Shellhead, keep these vultures off your boss.” Steve murmurs, ignoring Tony pulling a face beside him.
“Muscle-iest then.” He offers, eyes sparkling playfully.  Steve chuckles, rubbing his thumb over Tony's jaw.
“Run handwriting scan, toxicity matrix, it doesn't look explosive, but lets make sure before I touch it.” If it
“I want to see it, would love to see it. Probably won't understand much, but I can still appreciate what you've got cooking.” That earns him another brilliant smile, and Steve finds himself with a sudden armful of Tony Stark. He's warm in Steve's arms, and Steve pulls him close on the piano bench, hugs him tightly, strokes his fingers through the artful dishevelment of his hair. It feels good to hold Tony like this, to have the warmth of him so close, to feel the play of muscle beneath his hands-solid and real and wonderful. If he could paint a feeling it would be this. Joy and longing, warmth and touch. Something like ice melting. The first thaw of spring after a long and terrible winter.
be upset by the sight of Steve letting go of Hammer's throat to grab the front of his jumpsuit instead-and he
Iron Man dropped him into the largest group of Moloids, and the rush was on him in force.  Steve immediately went to work.  It was like smacking around a bunch of sentient bowling pins.  Everywhere he swung his shield, they went flying.  He bet Thor would have had a grand time of this.  He would probably be sore he missed out.  He wasn’t even winded, solely focused on containing the Moloid horde, protecting the crowd-which had decided this was an incredible show, and was cheering raucously from the stands- and keeping Iron Man’s path clear.
There were two tall big sixes hassling a tiny elderly beta woman.  As he watched they made a grab for her purse and pushed her over.  No one moved to help her, what the hell were they waiting for?  Steve didn’t miss a beat.  He ran to the woman’s side, patting her over to ensure nothing was broken.  He remembered his neighbor, Mister O’Brian breaking his hip after a fall much gentler than this one.
“Yeah I've heard about this Doom thing. Here's the thing, he thinks you're too good for him. He thinks he doesn't deserve you.” Rhodes says matter of factly. Steve fights down the hysterical laugh building in the very depths of his soul.
“Ma’am.”  He nodded, clambering into the back seat of the car.  He heard Widow say something behind him, but his hearing felt strange, fuzzy.  He felt out of his body almost, as if he were floating above it, unreal and cold and strange.  The rush was still there, his senses were on high alert, but there was nothing to fight, nothing he could do to make the world make sense.  The interior of the car smelled like his own fear, his own sweat, God he needed a shower.
Steve twirls the stylus Tony passed over to him when they first walked into the room, and Tony pauses mid-rant to take a sip of his shake. How he does that without gagging, Steve has no idea, he even seems to
“So alright, yes, I'm...I'm good, c'mon, please.” Despite Tony's obvious confidence in his ability to take him again with nothing further, Steve still drips more lube along the spaces between his fingers. Better safe than sorry, Steve would hate to think he hurt Tony while doing something like this-something that requires so much trust. Still, he can't deny Tony when he rolls over onto his back and pulls Steve close.
“No, I do not believe this will happen to you, that is why I chose you.  You and Schmidt could not be more different, you have proved this, time and again.”  Dr. Erskine sounded real sure of that, Steve wished he had that certainty.  Dr. Erskine continued, speaking in his slow measured way, it would almost have been calming, had the subject matter not been so dire.  “This, the serum, strength, power, was something he already wanted, something he was already actively working for, something he felt he deserved, but the serum amplified it, gave it greater power, and moreover gave him the power to do what he always felt entitled to. He never had any respect for strength, because he had always had it, it was his right you see, in his mind, it was owed to him.”
He flopped back on the bed, throwing an arm over his face.  Relieved laughter bubbled out of him.  He thought Tony would laugh at him, but no, it wasn’t like that at all.  He hoped Sarah could see him now, daring to give a gift to the most gorgeous man he’d ever seen, a superhero, and a billionaire to boot.
“Yeah your profits are about to take a dip, sorry about that.” Tony shrugs as Steve winds up his shot and throws the baseball harder than is strictly necessary-ducks and cans go flying everywhere. Steve smiles over at Tony when he's handed another ball, before staring down his new targets. Tony wants to swoon maybe just a little bit. Steve looking all focused and intent does
“That was atrocious, let's definitely never do that again. Zero stars on my yelp review.” Tony mutters as he's helped to his feet by no fewer than four people, including one very hangdog looking Clint.
“Oh,”  Tony said, going still beside him.  “Look, we’re on the kiss cam.”  He pointed, and sure enough, the huge screens around the stadium reflected their faces back.  Tony waved, the cheers got louder.  “We’re supposed to kiss but,”  Tony said out of the corner of his mouth.
One suggestion turns into two, and two into Steve calling out strategic suggestions to the team unthinkingly. Iron man bounces ideas off of him, able to see from above them as he is. He's fast, agile, and he packs a wallop Steve is duly impressed by. Just as he's impressed by Captain Marvel drop kicking one of their overzealous greeters into a high arc while Hawkeye yells 'Field Goal' over the comms.
“This is the best day of my life.” Tony says almost to himself. “Come up here and kiss me Steve, I'm getting lonely.”
“I'll do my best to make sure that doesn't happen.  I can't promise I won't make mistakes, but I want to try, if it turns out that's what Mister Stark wants too.” Steve says with utmost seriousness, determined to show he's not playing any games with anyone's heart.
“Thanks Dummy, good boy.” He murmurs, patting the bot where he can reach. Dummy beeps, rolling off and returning with his mini Cap shield. He drops it in front of Tony, clicking his pincer and giving him a Look.
things Steve. There was a girl there, she was, god, she was just brilliant Steve. Couldn't have been more than sixteen, but her
“Tony is a good guy, he'll want you to be where the team is, and you don't already have a house right?” She asks curiously.  Steve thinks back on his tiny apartment with it's drafty halls and creaky floors.  It probably doesn't even exist anymore.
“Where were we?” Steve slides his hands up his thighs, leaning in to press quick little kisses to Tony's lips. Tony likes where this is going, and where it is going seems to be right into the realm of Tony's fantasies. Never let it be said that a young Tony Stark had not entertained many a fantasy about Captain America and what he might get up to in the backseat of a car. His fantasies then had not included how fantastic Steve's hands feel cupping his ass, nor how absolutely intense Steve's kisses are when he's aroused and interested. God, Steve is going to be the death of him.
“That so, and here I thought you might like it.” Ah there it is, Steve's ears are a little red, but that doesn't seem to stop him from getting a double handful of Tony's backside and squeezing. Tony definitely does not let out a surprised little squeak at that.
“It smells really nice in here.” Steve observes as if Tony is not having an existential revelation right in front of him.
“You said no omega ever touched you. What did you do during the war?” Tony asked, hesitantly, after Steve finished the slice he had been determinedly mowing through.
“Captain Rogers, I would ask you to please be careful.” In the silence of the room JARVIS' speech is jarring.  Steve stops, hands stilling like he's been caught by his ma up to no good.
“You got a Monet you could hang over my bed, might make it more homey.”  Steve said, only half joking.  Iron man seemed to pause.  “No, no fella I was kidding, this is wonderful, thank you, it’s perfect, really.”  He swallowed past the lump in his throat.  Anything he could have asked for was either impossible, or far too familiar to ask of a person he barely knew.
“Fuck-” Steve swears, unable to remember he doesn't usually talk like that while in bed with Tony. The smile he gets in answer is pleased and more than a little smug, that much registers even in the hazy place he's currently floating blissfully.
“I think it's cute.” Steve says innocently, reaching up to pat the very phallic and very yellow stuffed fruit, where it hangs in a display among multitudes of other stuffed fruit near the top of the game stall. “You don't think Mister Nanners is cute?” Steve says, face completely serious, but the corners of his lips twitch tellingly.
Steve sighs, kicking the covers off with a groan of frustration and getting up to grab his sketchbook. He draws Tony's hands on the piano, Tony's face haloed by moonlight-lips turned up in a small private smile. Tony's eyes with their lush fan of dark lashes, the pout of his lips when someone teases him not unkindly. He draws until finally sleep is inevitable.
to say the least.  Steve licked his lips, if he concentrated, he could almost taste it.  He wondered how Tony would react if Steve were to pull his collar down, press his nose against his throat, see what an alpha like Tony Stark
. The walls are painted in soothing colors, white plastic tables are dotted around the place, and dead eyed teenager is standing behind a long counter full of what looks to be enough sweet toppings to make Willy Wonka cream his candy pants. It feels momentous.
“We're watching Jurassic Park, Steve saw a still from it on some website and he wanted to watch it.” Natasha says from the doorway of the room. She's carrying a tray loaded up with bowls of popcorn. Behind her, Thor has a truly impressive amount of candy in his arms.
Steve feels a grin break over his face, and he stands up, dragging Tony into a tight hug, spinning him around. Tony just laughs, heady and gleeful, and best of all,
“Tony-” He laughs, dropping his head to rest on Tony's shoulder, drawing his hand away to thumb over one of Tony's nipples until it pebbles beneath his touch. Maybe Tony is right after all.
I'm fine, peachy keen, one hundred percent ok-” He breaks off to sneeze again, the sneeze rapidly devolving into a coughing fit that both looks and sounds painful. Steve sinks down on the couch, pulling him close and letting him shiver and groan through the coughing until he stills. Most days it's easy to forget that the arc reactor can't be the most comfortable thing to live with. On days like this though, where Tony goes tense and pained after something as simple as a sneeze, Steve is reminded of just how invasive the arc must be.
“Yes, I would, I'd um. I'd like that.” He might feel embarrassed by how stammered and unsteady it comes out, but Tony just smiles and gives him another kiss that leaves his toes curling. He finds he doesn't mind waiting for the tub to fill at all, not with Tony here radiating heat against his chest.  This is good, this is
Afterwards he disappears off for days, locking down the lab and refusing to see anyone. Steve still leaves food by the blacked out doors, and is gratified when he makes another circuit and finds it gone.
“Worth the work, always worth the work.” Tony says, leaning in to cup his cheek and pressing another kiss to Steve's lips. “Call me a workaholic even, married to my wor-” Tony says between kisses, laughing when Steve grumbles at him but still going back for more. Married though. The word lingers in his awareness. It seems like lifetimes ago that he thought about getting married, having someone to come home to, someone who loved him and who he loved more than anyone or anything else. He wonders if Tony would ever want to be married again after what happened with
“Not gonna kill him, just got a point to make, and I'd like to see 'em try.” Steve practically growls. “I'm an American icon, or so they keep telling me. They can't touch me.” That was definitely a growl.  Hammer starts screaming, and Tony wants to scream too, but for completely different reasons.
AT LAAAAST the chapter is out!  Thank you to all of you for being so patient, and to everyone on discord (Ana, Palindrome, Aeniala, Seti, Rowantree, Bee your patience is mind boggling as always)
“Protecting people,”  She started, “Getting into fights, it does something to alphas.  Makes us feel good, invincible even, like you every day, spitfire.”  She smiled, gently tweaking his nose.  Steve wrinkled it, cuddling closer to try and share in whatever warmth he could.  “Things don’t hurt, I’ve seen alphas come into the hospital bloody and broken, and smiling, because they protected someone.”  She went quiet, her arms tightening around Steve’s body.  “It makes us stronger, it’s from Before, when we were all just wild things beating each other with sticks out in the woods.”
“Do not besmirch my motherland, Rogers, nor impinge on the honor of my blessed Redsox, amen.”  She said it with such seriousness Steve couldn’t help but keep needling her, especially since it had the tendency to make her laugh.
“Missed you, I'm sorry you're sick, should have told me so I coulda brought you something on the way home from the mission.” He murmurs against the blanket covering Tony's head. Tony frowns deeply, sighing when Steve kisses the top of his head.
It's so good, just hearing him talk like that, hearing that Tony liked the way it looked, still, he likes Tony's cock better than that toy. “Yeah, it did, felt so good. Like you better though.” He says, unable to keep the obstinate tone out of his voice.
“Of course. I'm a monogamist now, only the best for my Rhodey bear, pookie poo, pumpkin pie.” Tony coos to a stony faced reception.  Rhodes glares, but he looks used to this sort of behavior, and the corners of his lips twitch tellingly. Steve feels his face go a little pink. He wouldn't mind it if Mister Stark had a few sweet names for him.
“No it's...it's not-it's definitely not just sex.” Tony concedes again. “Steve, he's different than I thought he was going to be. Not in a
Thor, he just doesn't like Thor feeding Tony while he's all sleepwarm and snuggly.  Or maybe he just wants Thor to share some apple fritter with him too, what was it Clint called him when he was being a pill after not having eaten enough?  Hangry.  That was it.
Warm metal presses between his shoulder blades. Strange, he thought it would be cold, but Iron man is warm, as if he's been sitting in front of a fire. The touch grounds him in reality, and after long moments with Iron man murmuring comfort that makes no sense the world rights itself. His hearing stops fuzzing in and out, and he sits up fully, letting go of the odd hand with a glowing center he had grabbed unthinkingly.
Rhodes sighs, he seems more resigned than on guard now. "Godspeed, soldier, I hope you know what you're doing."
“What are you doing up anyway Steve?” Tony murmurs, their faces are pressed together, and Steve can't help but nuzzle him, just a little.
Steve tries to keep his focus on that, and not the sound of the wind rushing by a window Wasp opened to poke her head out of. He wants to pull her back, drag her away from that exposed position. The mountainside taunts him, and he looks down at his own hands clenched in his lap, refusing to see the trees rushing by. His peripheral vision-always such a blessing in battle-is an enemy here. Even his his gaze averted he can still see the scenery rushing by. Minute shivers dance over his skin, and he grits his teeth to keep them from chattering. Distantly, as if from the end of a long tunnel he hears Iron Man talking to the others, then the shuffle of them all filing out of the compartment.
“JARVIS, play something soothing.” He gets no response to that, JARVIS is very likely still angry about the whole Seattle thing, but the quiet strains of Maria's favorite piano piece still begin filtering through the room.
“Oh, oh, God,” The words punched out of him almost painfully. He was so hard, his cock slapping wetly against his abdomen when he let it go to pull at his own hair with just the thought of that, of Tony letting him fuck him. He could, he could get Tony on his stomach, pull his hips up, hold him like that, and-Tony was an omega, Steve wouldn’t have to keep a hand on himself, not if Tony urged him on, if he wanted it, and in his fantasy Tony sure did. Steve’s moan was shockingly loud in the room as he got his hand back around his cock. Both hands now, holding himself almost too tightly, the way Tony’s body might at first, but Tony would be able to-to, if tony wanted it, he could take a knot. Steve’s whole body arched with that thought, and he had to roll over, bury his face in the blankets, and grind into the mattress.
“Button up I mean.”  He took Tony’s gloved hand in his.  “I’ve seen scars before, you probably got that doing something wild and heroic, huh, mister?”  As soon as he said it, he knew it had been the wrong thing to say.  Tony went pale, he looked a little sick, scooting away from Steve and climbing off the couch.
“You, you, you're...no you're not here, of course you're not but-” His eyes are so blue, clear even now in the gloom and spray of the ocean.
“I'm sorry you're sore.” He murmurs, coming up behind Tony to pull him into a sort of backwards hug. Tony laughs, leaning his head back on Steve's shoulder to press a warm kiss over Steve's cheek. Steve's arms tighten around him, the sleek weave of his suit feels decadent compared to the simple cotton of his own worn army tee.
“Hey Lorenzo, got room for one more?”  Steve asked, holding his hand out so he and Lorenzo could clasp each other’s forearms in greeting.  Lorenzo just grinned, motioning for Steve to follow him around for a tour of the place.
A strange series of sounds follows from behind the door, then the crunch and whir technology between metal. Iron Man must have crushed the old reactor. Even in the safety of the jet the concern for someone picking up his old tech seems to run strong.
“Aw but that's the best kind of candy.” Clint grumbles, earning what sounds like a playful elbow to the ribs.
“What is it big guy, did I fall asleep on you?”  Tony slurs, his voice thick with drowsiness. Steve holds him a little tighter, kissing the top of his head.
“No, I don't really have anywhere to go. Still that seems kind of presumptuous.” Steve's ma' didn't tolerate the mooching type, and this seems awfully like something he would have gotten his ears boxed for entertaining.  As if reading his mind, Barton twists around in his seat, staring at Steve with a look that says he's off his rocker.
much better than good, being held close to Steve like this.  Steve sags with relief against the couch though as if somehow he had doubts over how receptive Tony would be to all this. Maybe Tony should kick up more of a fuss about being snuggled up to, maybe he should guard his heart more closely. Maybe he shouldn't allow himself to be so needy, but Steve seems to want it just as badly as he does.  From the night in the music room, to his frequent hugs, snuggling him in the kitchen, and that terrible night in the limo when they clung to each other like the last pieces of floating debris in a shipwreck. Tony has treated
“Sorry, sorry, if I would have known I'd have made another circle round the block.” Happy says when Tony has trotted off towards the cafe in search of what he had once called his one true love.
touches him. It feels life changing, earth shattering after wanting for so long, he arches against that touch, squirming in Steve's lap and trying to show him how much he wants this with everything in his being.
“I’ll leave you to it then, if you have a need of me I will not be far.”  Jarvis said, nodding towards him.
it. Likes having Tony close, the easy warmth of him there, his quick, clever fingers, and warm affectionate words.
Iron man sighs, turning to face him and scanning over the arm with a glittering network of lights. He tsks. “Not good.” Iron Man murmurs and Steve grunts, looking down at the arm in question, even through the padding of his uniform it's clearly at the wrong angle. Adrenaline is still high, but it's still incredibly painful, he knows if he allows time to pass it will only get worse. Steve has set bones in worse places before, this is going to hurt though. “Gonna need to apply traction to that but I've got some painkillers in here.” Iron Man starts opening up flaps, producing a thin syringe from god knows where and manipulating it surprisingly gently between metal clad fingers. Steve can read the label on it from where he's standing.
The barracks themselves were a whole new experience as well.  The beds were wide enough for two to three cadets to squeeze into them at the same time, he often saw a pair of betas, or alpha and beta cadets curled up together at night after a particularly difficult day.  When first settling in, Steve asked out of curiosity, if anyone was worried about getting a bun in their oven,  all betas could carry a child, or get another beta in the family way, and that seemed just a little like a bad idea, omegas could carry children too, but it was a little more complicated and there were just so few of them anyway.  But he’d seen some roaming hands at night, heard people taking comfort in each other.  He’d become a damn deep sleeper lately, and it wasn’t his business anyway, he’d just been curious. One of the cadets had assured him there was no danger of that, suppressants and birth control were passed out to any beta that wanted them, and encouraged for any beta-or even potentially omega- wanting to use the extra space in their or another’s bed.  Alphas of course were not really encouraged to take suppressants, while it made civilian life much easier for an unbonded alpha, it made a soldier more vulnerable, and vulnerable was the opposite of what was needed on the battlefield.
“Uh, if you like frozen yogurt that much then I can get a froyo machine delivered, you can have it anytime you like.” Tony murmurs, blinking as Steve darts in to steal a kiss.
“Sorry, I just realized I forgot to tell you. If you need anything I'm just down the hall-to the right across from you.” He's speaking quickly, tapping away at a clear pane of what looks like glass, but is covered in long scrolling threads of incomprehensible math.  “Scratch that, to be fair the likelihood of me actually being in my room is kind of ridiculously low. If you need me talk to Jay or Iron Man they always know how to find me.” He slides his fingertips over the glass and a bright blue glowing shape pops out. Stark eyes it critically. Steve is fascinated.
” Steve grouses, wishing suddenly he hadn't chugged that Asgardian booze so quickly. Or maybe wishing for his shield if only for something to keep his hands busy.
“Tony.” She says, drawing his attention away from dissecting what kind of material her phone could be made of. “You're going to wait out a solution at your cottage on Lake Superior in Minnesota. At least one Ave-one of us will be with you at all times.” She's already told him this before, he knows this, but the information is still welcome.
“That's not, I can't, you can't say that, you can't really believe that.” Steve feels like he's babbling. His hands are cold, the breath rushing from him as if Tony punched him in the solar plexus with the armor on. “You can't, I can't, you're the only thing, the only one and I can't be-” He slips his hands around to cup Tony's face between his palms. “I can't be without you, I just, you can't ask me that.” Distantly he realizes he's crying, wet tear tracks slipping down his face, but it doesn't matter.
“You just wait Mister Stark, I'm gonna woo your pants off.”  Steve says with a slight smirk.  Tony is laughing too hard to notice the considering look Steve shoots his way while he gathers up the stuff on the tray.
“Don't worry.” Steve says, broad hands securing him into the chair harness as the engines begin their telltale warm up. He knows Steve is aware he can do up the harness himself.  He has the sneaking suspicion Steve just wants to touch him-not that Tony is complaining.  “We've got your back.”
“You don’t really cuddle up much do you, kinda weird, you’re one of the only alphas here too.  Say, you got any idea what General Phillips and Doc are looking for?  They make my skin itch with all that staring.”  It was the most subdued he’d ever heard her, not that they had known each other long, but Steve had yet to have seen her anything less than completely sure of herself.
Steve hopes he's right about Tony being Iron Man as much as he wants to be wrong. If he's right, and he's all but one hundred percent certain he is; then Tony is constantly putting himself in danger. His fella has a heart condition, it's common knowledge-and even though Steve can't really hear his heart, he
“Whatever makes you happy, Steve.”  He said, sliding off the table. “I uh. I need to go put these somewhere safe.”  He practically bolted from the room after that, he’d even left the stolen breadstick behind.  Steve blinked a bit to clear the cobwebs from his mind.  The room smelled a little spicy, Tony’s scent lingering even after he’d gone.
Tony grinned, plopping down in the seat between he and an increasingly vexed looking Roy.  “Hot dogs, corn dogs, more chips, peanuts, a bag of caramel corn for me, but I’ll share if you ask, sunshine.”  He looked so fond, as if he really was excited to be sitting next to Steve offering him a king’s banquet worth of stadium food.
Steve flushes, rolling back onto his heels to get to his feet; pulling Tony up after him.  “I have plenty too.” Steve says, shrugging when Tony gapes at him.
“Yes Tony, god you're so beautiful, so good.” Steve murmurs against Tony's sweaty hair, his hand still pumping his cock gently, letting him ride out the last aftershocks of his orgasm until he hiccups with oversensitivity and Steve's hands both slip away.
“Santa baby-” He coos, doing a little shimmy that makes Steve's mouth go dry for all of its ridiculousness. “come hurry down my chimney tonight-” Tony grins, putting his bowl of candy aside and skipping right up to Steve with a jingle. The little striped candy cane lure dangles between them in a way Steve can only think of as menacing. Tony bounces in place, the bells adorning his sweater jingling away merrily with his movements.
“Bucky used to rub my back when this happened.” He blurts out, feeling stupid the moment it leaves his mouth. Iron Man said he had them too-before. He must understand, he won't judge Steve for this, or at least Steve hopes so. He doesn't think Tony would judge him either. Tony is good and kind, and so gentle with the pain of others even if he pretends to be careless and fickle for the cameras. Steve knows the truth.  “People don't...after the serum.” the words are garbled, but Iron man just waits patiently, letting Steve take his gauntleted hands in his; the little baggie of food falls to the wayside, forgotten for now. “People don't touch me anymore and I miss it. I miss it so much, but I can't ask for that.” Inside the armor, Iron Man takes a sharp breath.
he built will tell him nothing. It's frustrating, this not knowing, but Tony understands, he does. That doesn't change the face that he's bored out of his skull and has started contemplating building an anti-gravity device so he can climb the walls in a literal sense.
“I also said I wanted to feed the strawberries to my steady, we gonna get to do that?”  Steve asks. Tony’s eyes darken slightly, he comes closer, setting the bowls down on the table and then insinuating himself into Steve’s lap.
“Call me Steve off the field, I’m only Cap out there.”  They were so close, Their eyes met and held, and Steve felt his heart rate jump up just with that look.
He’s standing in a church. Bare feet cold on old, old wooden flooring. Somewhere a soaring choir sings, voices raised in a language he doesn’t know.  Tony can’t see them.  Hazy light filters in, casting long shadows across a figure bent over a coffin. Outside the water waits, swirling along the windows as if it wants to get in, but Tony pays it no mind. The statue of a woman dominates the room. Robed in white, she points to her heart, seven swords refract light, but her face is serene. Tony looks away from her-steps closer to the figure near the coffin, beneath his feet wood creaks, loud like a thunderclap.
“Need to get back to the quinjet, have a spare in there. If I don't it's lights out and I'll be...trapped in here. Can still get out but I'd rather not.” Iron Man sounds shaky, something in the cadence of his voice setting off alarm bells.  He can't let him leave alone.  Steve taps him as he assumes his flight pose.
“Steve!” Tony gasps, breaking away from the kiss, breaths panting out harshly in the relative quiet of the training room. Steve doesn't answer, choosing instead to mouth a trail of kisses down Tony's throat, then lower to worry marks into the smooth skin of Tony's stomach.  “Oh my god.” Tony whispers, seemingly to himself. He's watching Steve through barely open eyes, tongue flicking out to wet his lips when Steve dips his head, kissing the spot he was tormenting just moments earlier. Tony's hips shift restlessly, and Steve drops another kiss there, open mouthed and biting this time; feeling Tony's muscles flutter, and the hardness so obviously tenting Tony's sweatpants. Another drag of his teeth makes Tony moan, and Steve follows that sound up to the source, blazing a path of kisses back up to Tony's parted lips.
“Tony you need to tell everyone. I don't think anyone on the would object to you being an Avenger.  You're important to the team, you have to know that by now.”  She says it so matter of factly, but Tony doubts it, he doubts it a lot.
“Of course I'm right.” He'd say. “I'm a futurist.”  The thought of Tony's smile lifts his spirits for a moment, but that too fades.  Only the sound of an urgent call for Assembly gets him out of his room and running toward the jet.  This at least he can do.
“I shouldn’t have left like that.  You’re not feeling well.  I let my stupid feelings get in the way of what I,”  He licked his lips, pressed against Steve’s side again.  He smelled the way he usually did, like warm metal and spice, but there was a hint of something softer there, like vanilla.  “What I should be doing.”
“I’m just tired!”  Steve called through the door.  Somewhere the universe was laughing at him, he was sure of it.
.  Tony probably had a whole closet full of jewelry nicer than what he had bought.  There was no indication he was even interested.  Steve didn’t think he was stepping out with anyone, he seemed to be single, but that didn’t mean he was.  Maybe he was just private.  Still, Steve wanted.  He wanted a lot.  Even as his body grew cold and he began to shake with the drop, he still felt that desire.
“Yeah, dad's here. Kind of shaken up, but here, hey kiddos.” Tony whispers, suddenly overcome with a fierce sort of joy that he might have forgotten a lot of things, but at least no one has forgotten
“Yeah okay maybe so, c'mon, hurry up before the Hulk busts through my blast doors like the kool-aid man.” Tony says, smiling back at Steve. He's flushed, gorgeous and debauched, and Steve has no idea what that reference is, but he gets the gist.
be his. Tony seems to be stunned speechless for once, but he turns towards Steve once Doom is safely within SHIELD custody.
“Marry me.” He says dazedly. “You're already on your knees, you should just propose.” He clarifies, hazy brown eyes dropping to stare down at Steve.
It takes just moments after that to reach Tony's room. The door helpfully pops open when he stands in front of it. Proof positive that JARVIS has been watching their progress the entire time. It's comforting to Steve. The AI certainly would have spoken up if he was doing something wrong.
“Ten year old me agrees, this is like something right out of a dimestore novel.” When Steve looks up, Stark is looking wide-eyed. The expression softens his features. Steve has to agree with Thor, the man is really
Then there was Thor.  Tall, built like a mountain, with a voice that could shake the heavens, and a smile that could light up a room.  It had been no shock to find out the man was a prince, maybe a bit of one to learn he was an alien, but Steve just took it in stride, he’d worked with aliens before.  He was neither an alpha, a beta, nor an omega, but he found it all quite fascinating.  He asked Steve some rather pointed questions while sipping a sweet smelling coffee in a tall paper cup, and then royally proclaimed he wished to spar with the team.  All present had gone down to the training room and engaged in a wild sparring session that left most of them panting on the floor.  It felt good, it felt like living.
“Steve, darling, beloved-” Tony moans, pulling away from Steve's mouth, reaching back to lay a hand across Steve's wrist.
“I just dealt with it.” Steve shrugged, other alphas dealt with it fine, he didn’t see what was so special about that, why he should be any different.
Clint looks up from where he's been lovingly stroking the shaft of one of his arrows. His eyes narrow over at their target.  “Oh hell no.” Clint growls. “That's my title you little-”
“C'mon big guy, we have limited time here, line up and get in me.” Tony whines, grabbing an innocuous little bottle off the desk that Steve knows to be what Tony has dubbed their 'travel lube'.
“So.” Tony says, breaking the silence at last; voice brittle with hidden nervousness. “I guess it's time to tell you all about Ty. Fuck I'm going to need a drink for this.” He mumbles the last part under his breath, sucking in a deep steadying breath.
“Thor!  Iron Man!  Stop him, he’s gone mad!”  The giant yelled, as Steve barreled him down.  There was a robot standing in his field of vision, and a tall mountain of a man that looked like a Viking.  All around his face a tiny woman fluttered, calling to him in distress.  Steve paused, his chest heaving.  They were not trying to hurt him, they were merely trying to calm him down.  Bucky was dead, Bucky was gone and he was confused and taking it out on these people, strange though they were, they had done nothing to warrant the way he lashed out.  Confusion and grief warred within him, he dropped to a knee, clutching at his own hair.  It was damp but drying in the warm dry air of the room.
“No time to plan Cap. Everyone with superstrength, we have a Ferris wheel to stop from achieving lift off.” Then he's streaking off, Cap confirming and shooting off more orders as they all descend on the caped menace.
On the weekend, he took in a movie at the cinema.  They were showing some old silent film reels for their ten cent matinee, and Steve went eagerly.  On the screen Rudolph Valentino was sweeping Nita Naldi into a passionate kiss.  Gosh what a guy Valentino had been, Steve felt his cheeks heat a little just watching the two of them carrying on.  Having an omega like Valentino kissing the bejesus out of you was probably a head turner even if it was just an acted scene.  Steve wasn’t the only one leaning forward in his seat, so he didn’t feel too silly about his hopeless crush.  Valentino was long gone anyway.  A fact many of the alphas and betas around his ma’s age had bemoaned often.  Steve had to say, he agreed.
“Of course I did. You're an Avenger, you're my friend, you deserve the best.” Tony stops, chewing on his bottom lip nervously. “Sorry, maybe that's presumptuous but, I think,” His eyes drop to the floor, hands going tight on the hanger. “I think I can call you my friend now?”
“S'nice.” Tony murmurs when Steve starts on his other hand, dropping his head down onto one of Steve's broad shoulders.
“Steve, you finally decided to visit!”  A loud voice called out, and Steve turned to see Lorenzo De Rossi strolling over.  He was an older alpha, with salt and pepper hair and dark, laughing eyes.  He had been at Sarah’s funeral, Steve remembered his ma’ saying he’d lost his only child to the great war.  A tall strapping Alpha girl by the name of Eleonora.  She’d been a miracle baby, same as Steve.  Both Lorenzo and his wife Mia were alphas, so the odds had always been against them to have a kid.  He remembered Sarah retelling the story with great sadness.  Eleonora had made her family proud, she had been a good alpha, but that didn’t make it any easier on her family.
“Okay yeah. I do have a splint too, but it's not stored in my shiny metal ass just so you know.” Iron Man says, pulling Steve from the direction of his thoughts. He's trying for levity again but it doesn't quite work, there's too much concern there, even through the voice modulation. Iron Man sighs gustily, hand rubbing over his shoulder again in slow soothing motions.
That goes unspoken, but Steve can hear it in the air between them, see it in the tension around Tony's shoulders.
“Steve!” He gasps, reaching back to grab at silky blond hair, holding Steve against him and trying to press back against that perfect mouth. Steve growls, the vibration lighting up all the sensitive nerve endings there. It's fantastic, tortuous and incredible. Tony digs his knees into the bed, trying and failing to get leverage, as if he can urge Steve on, urge him to get up and get in him, but Steve is implacable, immovable. His ass is going to have perfect finger shaped bruises on it, Tony knows it, back in the part of his brain that's not trying to turn itself inside out with the pleasure. His cock twitches against the pillow, his thighs shake as Steve presses his knuckles against his perineum and licks a circle around his hole before giving it a sucking kiss, then another, just rocking his knuckles there, until Tony is all but sobbing with how good it feels. Tony goes limp against the bed, panting and shaking when Steve draws back and rubs soothingly over the back of his legs, turning his hands to put deep pressure on his inner thighs where they still tremble and twitch.
A few of Zemo’s strikes connected, but Steve felt nothing, setting his jaw, and rolling away from another shot, once Zemo gathered enough presence of mind to actually aim it at him. His ears rang with the noise of the blasts, but he paid it no mind, running towards Zemo, and kicking him in the chest with enough force to send him through the wall he’d unwittingly cornered himself by.
The alley seemed a lot longer than it had when he first ran into it, but Steve gamely walked towards the entrance, only to stop short when a shiny green and grey Packard 160 rolled over to block his path, and a man in a long white greatcoat stepped out.  Steve took a step back, wary suddenly that the two alphas hadn’t so much left as gone to get another friend.  Steve thought this was sure a lot of fuss for one little old lady’s purse.  The guy didn’t seem interested in the bag at all though, he was carrying a thick file, and he smelled like a beta, a neutral clean scent that reminded Steve a little of green grass and fresh laundry.  He fixed Steve with a piercing gaze, and smiled, a far kinder smile than Steve had seen from most people who wanted to punch his lights out.
The next time Steve sees Mister Stark he has an entourage with him. Steve is in the kitchen scaring up a whole mess of breakfast when a tall elegant red haired woman comes in talking away on a cellphone and looking more imposing than a drill sergeant. Virginia 'Pepper' Potts, Acting CEO of Stark Industries-Steve read the dossier, he knows her immediately.
“Noted. Come down to the lab later and help me develop something to get Steve high? Please.” The big pleading eyes are killer, it seems even Bruce isn't immune. Their resident gamma expert just slumps, shaking his head and smiling at Tony with surprising indulgence.
There was of course, the very real possibility that he would die, whether on the battlefield, or even during whatever plans Dr. Erskine and the government had for him, but then he’d be dead, and hopefully seeing his ma’ in the flesh, or maybe the spirit, or however the afterlife worked.  Steve smiled at the thought of Sarah grabbing him by the ears and telling him he’d been supposed to live to be a hundred at least.
“Ah yes, this is in fact, about that, or it will be, after a time, provided I have not been mistaken.”  Something crossed Dr. Erskine’s face then, regret, anger, but he schooled it away just as quickly, smiling obscurely over at Steve. “I certainly have been before, but no, I do not believe I am, not this time.”  He fixed Steve with an intense stare, far more intense than the way Steve was accustomed to being looked at, looked through by people in positions of power and influence.  He felt a little like a butterfly pinned to a board.  It should have been unpleasant, but it didn’t feel hostile, just curious, hopeful almost.  Steve sat up straighter, tried to look like the kind of fella Dr. Erskine could count on.
“Steve! Oh wow is that bacon?” Tony walks towards him, buttoning his jacket and smoothing the lines of it. He looks so happy to see him that Steve can't help but smile back. This close up though, Steve can see faint strain around his eyes, as if he's not feeling entirely up to par. His gait-usually so smooth and easy-is slower, the steps carefully measured and small. Steve remembers the bruising and wants to walk him right back to bed. He doubts the gesture would be appreciated however, and it sounds like a full day lies ahead of him-but Steve worries.
"Come again?" Steve manages to get out, when it comes to his attention that he's been watching Tony spin around in his lab chair in silence. Tony's gaze zeroes in on him, he looks a little gleeful, pressing his lips together and then grinning.  He snaps his fingers, pointing up at the ceiling. There's a brief dinging sound, and a scoreboard pops up. Numbers scroll all over it, but Steve can't make heads or tails of what it all means.
That earns him a snort of laughter and a glare of mock affront.  “You can't play dumb with me Steven, JARVIS told me you've got the tablet all figured out, and you use the modern equipment in the gym, so don't you give me that golly gee whiz 'what's a paperclip' bull you pull with the talking heads at FOX sometimes.” He sounds offended on Steve's part, and he finds himself smiling wide. It heartens him that Tony can see the truth. Steve may have taken to playing up his ignorance about modern technology when talking to certain members of the press. If they're the same reporters that say nasty things about Tony and the team, well, that's something only he needs to know. Watching some red faced overblown clown try to patiently explain something so low tech Tony could probably make it in his sleep has become a pastime of Steve's. Apparently his cover is blown. He's been made-by JARVIS no less.
that-but the mental image is compelling to say the least. Compelling and distracting as Steve soon finds. Tossing and turning on the bed feeling hot all over with want was not how he planned the events of this evening. Steve glares down in the direction of his persistent arousal as if that will help. It's either ignore it, or do something about it. Steve knows enough about his own anatomy to not want to deal with the latter. One time will turn into two or three, and then he'll end up sticky and guilty in the shower. The pattern has already been established.
That was where Tony found him, sitting at the kitchen table with a mouthful of Jarvis’ delicious spaghetti and an entire plate of garlic breadsticks.
are also a hero. Shall I replay the footage of you saving that busfull of people and receiving your current injuries because you were playing human shield? Or perhaps we should ask those hostages you freed last week whether or not they consider you to be worthy of such a title.” Wow, JARVIS sounds annoyed, that's difficult to evoke.
Iron man breaks it to him gently, but it's still all he can do not to collapse into himself right there. He feels heavy, weighted down and on the verge of bursting. A point of matter pulling inwards, black holes sucking in light. He saw them in the tesseract once. He feels that dread now like a physical blow. It leaves him raw and shaking in the little bed of the medbay where he sits with his outdated gear and the shield a dead man gave him.
“I can't JARVIS. You know that. If he...if he knew the truth he would hate me. I'm not like him, he's a good person, he's...a hero. I'm not like that”
“Wow, that’s, that’s so good.”  Steve says, once his mouth is no longer full.  Tony smiles brightly, accepting a strawberry when Steve offers him one in return.  Steve sorely underestimated how affecting it would be to have Tony licking cream off his fingers.
Amora stepped out in front of him and a beam of magic stretched from her.  He raised his shield to block it, but the modern New York city block was gone.  Amora was gone.  Bucky was standing across from him looking the way he’d looked the last time Steve saw him alive.  Perhaps if the exhaustion were not so intense, the obvious illusion would have been more apparent, but in that moment it was all so real.
“I notice things, you seem pretty keen on cappuccino.”  Steve shrugged, picking up the empty cup when Tony set it down.  His breakfast was getting cold, but he didn’t care, not with how warmly Tony was smiling at him.
“Please tell me you're wearing a suspender belt.” He says semi dazedly, Steve smiles, wide and promising.
“Get what?” Steve sounds so bewildered. “Tony, I love you, I'm in love with you.” He can't have heard that right, but Steve continues on doggedly, taking his chin in his hand to kiss him between words.
“Goddammit to hell.” Steve growls. Tony laughs disbelievingly, touching the side of Steve's face with one hand.
“We'll stay here tonight, then take off in the morning. Don't worry, we have a ride.” Rhodey says, anticipating Tony's objection over his only means of transportation being potentially gone.
“A tie clip. Engraved, almost solid platinum with a diamond set into the top. We found that on our sweep through the location.” Natasha says, bright red nails drumming over the arm of her chair. Tony picks up the clip, turning it from side to side. Up close he can see a tiny serial number engraved on the piece of metal, along with a pair of initials laser cut into the material.
“Ma’am, I have your bag?”  He said, the words coming out something more a question than a statement.  He held the purse out towards her, and she gently took it from his fingers.  They were starting to feel cold, he didn’t know what was happening, who these people were.
“I'll see you at the meeting in the morning Tony, bright and early, don't go back down to the lab, you hear me smart guy.” Steve says, it lacks his usual smooth delivery, but Tony chooses to ignore that.
he thinks only slightly hysterically, when the armor comes striding over to squeeze his shoulder; blue eyeslits glowing down at him as he's ushered up onto the boarding platform.
“I do. You can't make me your only anchor in this world Steve, okay, you just can't. I'm not worth that, and it's not healthy.”  Tony sounds as certain as he ever does when dismissing the value he has to Steve, has to everyone.  Steve frowns, squeezing lightly at the back of Tony's neck.
After dinner, he excuses himself down to the lab. Steve sees him off with a lingering kiss that puts a spring in Tony's step. He rubs at the tag beneath his shirt as he works, almost unable to believe it really happened. That Steve wants him that much. He contemplates calling Rhodey, but it's late, and he has a life of his own. Instead he focuses on repulsor upgrades, letting the familiar process calm the noise in his head as it always does.
“Steve, wanna suck you, can I? You can do anything, fuck my throat-come in my mouth, it'll be fucking
“Feels good?” He asks, pressing his thumbs into the defined dimples above Tony's round behind, where they peek out tantalizingly from the waistband of his pants. Tony just trembles, going down to rest on his forearms, head bowed as if he can't hold it up anymore.
“Taking too long, here, let me.”  Steve grouches, reaching out to unbelt the robe and pull Tony in by his waist.  He tucks Tony up against him, running a hand down his clothed back, his other beneath the robe, resting on the warm skin of his upper hip where the waistband of his pants begins.
So wrapped up is he in what that could possibly mean for the man inside the suit-how hurt is he? Where is he? Is there anything the rest of the team can do to help? Who is controlling the suit if Iron Man is not in it?-that he almost misses the figure of someone in the sitting room just off the hall.
“Mmm.”  It wasn’t really a word, just sounds, all he could manage.  He turned into Tony’s touches.  His hands felt so warm, his fingertips like little points of light filling him with a lazy contentment he had never experienced.  Steve let out a long exhalation, and finally let himself sink into a deep dreamless sleep.
“Good.”  Tony says softly, when he’s finished with the pears, and Steve turns his head to steal a chaste kiss.  “Better.” Tony says,turning his face to smile into his neck when they part.
“Of course I still want to date you Steve. You really have no idea, do you?” He says almost to himself, pushing up onto his knees to press careful but still toe curlingly delicious kisses to his lips.
“It doesn't have to be someone you necessarily want a relationship with. It's about trust.” Natasha finally says, folding her hands in her lap. “All field agents had someone on their files to call in the event of that sort of emergency. It might sound strange, but it can save you from a lot of uncomfortable feelings and implications after the fact.”
“Hey, hey, leggo, stoppit! You're a brute, I can't believe-” But Tony is laughing as Steve picks his feet off the ground and swings him around. It's a joyful sound, rare and completely worth the metal fingers prodding at his ribs.
“Oh, so that's what this is all about huh, spoiling me rotten?”  Steve asks, feeling carefree and overly pleased suddenly with the way Tony turns into him and smiles wide.  His arms go around Steve's shoulders, and he stays there while all the food is summarily made short work of.
“You did say that, and after all, your wish is my command, anything you want, anything for my fella.”  Tony says with a little wink, and hearing Tony say things like that, using Steve's own turns of phrase; it makes him feel his request wasn't a bad one.  That thought is further reinforced when Tony pulls back the covers and urges Steve to lay down on his side. Tony is there a moment later, settling in behind him and slipping a hand beneath the soft flannel of Steve's shirt.  “There now. How is this? Is this what you wanted, sugar?”
“Sir, are you sure?” JARVIS says, speaking now all around him from the speakers within the helmet. Tony turns his palms down, assuming flight position as the escape tunnel beneath the mansion opens up and lights from within.
“Indeed we did, the Man of Iron was not present, but we thought it likely he was with you Anthony. Regardless, we would offer our assistance, and our solidarity as warriors as you face down your foe on the battlefield of words.”  Thor announces as if this sort of thing is just another day's work for him.  He supposes Thor
There were reporters gathered around, firing questions off, while the team moved towards the waiting cars.  Iron Man slid smoothly in front of Steve, answering questions and holding court while Wasp went from Tinkerbelle sized to human.  Where Iron Man held court, she dazzled.  Both of them seemed entirely adept at handling the press.  Their cameras were different than they had been in Steve’s time, but they were definitely reporters.
Tony groaned, and continued on with an air of grand drama, “Of course, of course they did, they live to torment me, I swear, my own personal demons.”
On a call with Tony, he’d learned the government didn’t own him anymore.  He was his own man, free to do as he pleased, whether that was joining the Avengers or striking out on his own.  It had been freeing at the time, but now there was a part of him that longed for a mission to keep his feet on the ground.  He wouldn’t rejoin however, there were soldiers all over the world, battles Steve didn’t understand why they were fighting.  Money, oil, empire, that was hardly a Nazi threat, and while there were places soldiers were greatly needed, he would have no control of where he would be sent.  He wouldn’t become a puppet or a prop for some overblown politician with more greed than sense.
On Monday Steve goes to see the the psychologist Tony suggested.  She is not anything like what he expected. The last time Steve read up on psychology it wasn't nearly as good. For one thing, Freud's principles don't seem nearly as popular as they used to be.  He's immeasurably thankful for that.  Doctor Acharya is warm, welcoming, and even if she doesn't quite understand everything he's telling her, because there's no frame of reference for what Steve has lost; she tries. It's nice to just speak what's on his mind. It's still incredibly difficult. Old habits die hard, and Steve grew up being taught by society to bottle everything up except for his anger. He's trying though, and it's worth it when he talks to Tony over the phone, and Tony praises him for even making the attempt. Speaking to Tony is not the same as having him close by however.
As always, Tony’s generosity left him speechless. He didn’t know what to say to that, so he just agreed. He wouldn’t do it again though, he resolved to himself with determination. During the war he’d survived, he wasn’t about to start imposing on Tony regularly just because he couldn’t take it. He would stretch the wonderful light feeling within himself for as long as he possibly could. After that, well, there were always his water bottles and the blankets.
“That's why I have to lead him to me!” Tony cries, pulling his hands away to throw them up. His eyes are wet at the corners. “I'm his goal, and if you all get hurt protecting me then that's on me, it's on me and I can't-” Tony whispers, sagging against him when Steve pulls him close, cradles the back of his skull in one broad palm. “I can't ask all of you to fight a battle that's mine.”
“Happy I'm sweating, do I look sweaty?  Smell me.” He says faintly, words trailing off when Steve comes right into his space and tugs him into a sweet kiss by way of greeting. Tony throws his arms around his neck and makes sure to show Steve just how pleased he is with this kind of hello. It's nothing like the frantic clutching kisses they shared earlier in the workshop, but it still makes his body light up like a live wire. Happy's seen worse, he can deal.
“How do you know they're a her?” He knows the one for him will be a man, knows it in the glimpses of blue eyes he sees in dreams. Strong hands, a face he will never touch. Frozen in time like the saints his mother lit candles for on Sunday mass.
“It was a royal pain in my ass, honestly.  Roy, one of the shareholders, spent half the meeting droning on about meaningless crap, and the rest trying to give me some Patriot’s tickets.”  Tony’s lip curled, he shuffled his cards around.  “I don’t even like that team, it’s all about showing me how much money he’s throwing around.  If he really wanted to impress me you would think he would figure out my favorite teams.”
“Oh I see, did Tony here let you have a fun ride? He's good for that. Great guns and great head, or so I hear.” Hammer spits out, all sly words and innuendo. Behind him, Steve has gone frighteningly still. Clint's softly whispered
Tony comes with something near to a scream, fingers yanking at the covers so hard Steve swears he hears something tear. That thought is wiped away by the way Tony spasms around him, his orgasm making him shiver uncontrollably inside and outside. Steve pushes in once, twice, through that clinging heat, before he loses the battle with his own will, and he's coming, dropping his head down to seal his mouth over Tony's as his hips give a few last stuttering thrusts. They lay there, utterly spent for how long he has no idea, but It's Tony shifting around in obvious discomfort that finally inspires him to move.
Happy grins knowingly, and Tony pointedly does not make eye contact, choosing instead to fiddle with his watch.  The armor bracelets sit cool and comforting around his wrists, Iron man will shadow them from high above. Never let it be said that he and paranoia don't go hand in hand. He's paid for trusting the stars to align before. Never again. That he's even letting Happy drive is a huge concession. Last time someone else was in the driver's seat-Tony shakes himself from the thought. He's not going there tonight.
“Mister Stark dislikes falling asleep on couches alone. It is ah..a quirk.” There's a story here, probably a private one, like so much of what surrounds Tony Stark. JARVIS won't tell even if he asks, Steve knows this with utmost certainty. Secrets upon secrets.
“God he does, if I have to hear about it any more I'm going to club him over the head. Tony's just.” Rhodes looks over to where the man in question is deep in conversation with Jan. “Look, let's talk somewhere else.” Steve nods, following Rhodes to an empty room, slumping down into a chair morosely. Rhodes eyes him for a moment, sighing and shaking his head in clear sympathy.
Tony goes to wash his hands, straightens out what's left of his tux; just the pants and the shirt now-sleeves rolled up his forearms and buttons undone to show just the top of the vest covering the arc. He does up those buttons to hide it from view, smoothing the shirt down and stepping out of the lab doors once he's certain no one else is in the hallway. When he makes it out he stops and stares. A flower arrangement sits oh so innocently just to the left. It's in a bright red vase. A small card leans against the bottom with Tony's name scrawled across it in elegant calligraphy. Tony sinks down, taking the little card and gingerly shaking it from the envelope into his hand. It's from Steve-of course it is. Inside Cap's flowing script says a lot of things, praise, all of it. What is at the end catches his eye the most however, one simple question.
Instead, when they arrived back at the mansion, he made to walk down towards the training room, only to be stopped by Tony.
“Yeah just.”  He shrugged, feeling like the world’s biggest dummy.  “Just letting you know.”  He said, and hurriedly closed himself into his bedroom.  There was silence for a few moments from the sitting room, and then Tony knocked on his door quietly.
He was early, but not early enough it would have seemed.  In the classroom, gifts were already numerous atop Russell’s desk.  Little packages of brightly colored wrapping paper, letters on finer stationary than his own, jars full of homemade gifts, and one box Steve could tell was jewelry.  Steve put his hand in his pocket, pressed his fingers against the letter with his heart in it, and turned away to sit down at his own desk.  He stared fixedly at the woodgrain of his own desk, feeling his heart in his throat, until Russell himself walked in.
“Mister Stark needs to see to Iron Man's injuries. I will be taking control of the suit in order to fly him back to the mansion barring further need for assistance. It seems you have all in hand here Captain Rogers.” JARVIS' voice is smooth and crisp. The armor rises jerkily, joints locking into Iron Man's characteristic flight pose.
There were unconscious Moloids everywhere.  Steve stood up with his hands on his hips surveying the scene.  Behind him the turf crunched as Iron Man walked over to sling an arm over his shoulder.
“Got stuff to do, but you can watch, feel free to touch.” Tony murmurs, the glint in his eyes just shy of devious as he turns from the kiss to draw his right hand over an array of dazzling schematics. Steve watches silently for a moment, pressing harder against Tony's back, and dropping his head down to press open mouthed kisses to the nape of Tony's neck.
The second time they share a bed it's more an act of strategy on Steve's part than a happy accident. Maybe he might take advantage of the fact that Tony seems willing to follow him on most wild-hairs, maybe it's just simple desperation. Either way he talks Tony into another camping trip-citing the disaster that was their last time in the Savage Land as reason for his sudden desire to go be outdoorsy. Tony huffs and complains duly, but eventually agrees to his demands once it becomes evident that it's something of a nostalgia trip for Steve.
“Yeah. Uh-” Tony takes a good look at himself. “Yeah, tell him I'll be right down. Just gonna change.” He says faintly. His phone vibrates in his pocket, and JARVIS pops the message up on a floating screen while Tony digs through his closet for some new threads. It's from Pepper, just two words:
He stays with them for a few fleeting days, and then he's gone, a ghost again. This time Steve doesn't chase him, he'll be back, maybe this time for good.
“You better believe he still owes me on that.”  She rolled her eyes, but she still looked fond.  She also grabbed Tony’s face and began dabbing at the lipstick smudge.  Tony just stood there docily, his nose wrinkling up when she grabbed a napkin to rub a bit more vigorously.  Steve smiled to himself, scraping food from the pan onto a plate.  He was pretty sure it was a serving plate, but it served its purpose.
“Mmmguh-” Is all he can get out when Steve takes his silence as carte blanche to knead at his neck and shoulders. He groans, dropping his head back down and trying to convince himself he has things to do today. Lots of things, important super secret Iron Man things. Steve's fingers are in his hair, scratching over his scalp. Tony feels like he might just liquefy on the spot.  “You know,” he mumbles around a mouthful of Steve's shirt. “If this whole superhero thing doesn't work out, you have a bright future as a massage therapist.”
“So you admit you don’t sleep enough, never thought I’d hear that.”  Everyone said it, and there were coffee makers strewn all over the mansion.  He was pretty sure there was an espresso machine in the foyer off the main entrance.
old man. You better bring your A-game.” Tony's smile is wide, and stays that way until he leads everyone over to the ridiculously huge and lavishly decorated tree in the east facing atrium to pass out presents. Steve is briefly worried that his present will be something he'll be too worried about the cost of to enjoy, but it's not. Tony pulls him aside while the others chatter and exchange gifts to pass him a box wrapped in paper with tiny iron man armors wearing Santa hats. Steve laughs, shaking his head and opening it carefully.
“Tony, Tony, call off your dog, cut me a deal.” Hammer continues, seemingly unconcerned that he's admitted to colluding with Stane on a recording, or just how close he came to having Tony punch him directly in the trachea.  “I've got plans, you've got the arc reactor technology, it could be beautiful, you and me work-” He doesn't get to finish, JARVIS pulls his hand up and backhands Hammer in such a perfect arc that Tony thinks he might need to make a gif of it later. Hammer spins like a ballerina on point, squealing with terror and going down like a sack of bricks. It may be the most beautiful thing Tony has ever seen.
“Yeah.” Says Tony, swallowing thickly. “Yeah one of those sounds about right.” It's been a while since he had anyone around that ticked any of those boxes.  “Don't fuck this up Stark.” He whispers to his image in the mirror. Sadly his reflection looks just as lost as he does. Tony turns away, stopping by the door to his room to grab a pair of oxfords, slipping them on and doing up the laces.  “Self lacing dress shoes JARVIS. Not everyone can bend down, or maybe you know, something for people with fine motor issues. Make a note.” He chatters away with JARVIS absently, shooting off a few emails to S.I.'s research and development department before he makes it back into the room with Steve, his words trailing off when he gets a good look at the man in question. He's still wearing the same clothes from last night, but his hair is looking perfectly coiffed, and a well worn leather jacket has joined the ensemble while Tony was off having a crisis. Typical. He always misses the exciting stuff.
“Are you ready for this?” Tony asks when the limo pulls up to the long red carpet leading into the hotel hosting the foundation. Photographers line the sides, cameras already out and snapping pictures of the guests already making their way up the long walkway. The hotel was a gift from Howard to his mother after a particularly bad blowout. He knows Maria would have enjoyed the thought of her son guilting cash out of the elite in a building she received through the same emotion. His mother had been full of such poetic justice.
“It was great, fantastic even. My nanites as applicable to the regeneration of soft tissues seem to have been a big hit with the Musculoskeletal Disorder crowd, but that's not important. What's important is that I got to eat Kobe beef and I saw the face of god.” Tony says dreamily. Steve knows he's downplaying his compassion, Steve has seen enough glimpses of his soft heart by now not to take the bait.
“Is he, I won't see anything-JARVIS.” He asks, tipping his head up towards the cameras hidden around the room.
“I really need a shower, and I've got some stuff in the lab, there's a lot I need to work on-” He trails off; Steve's getting a look on his face Tony knows so well. “But I'll come take a few minutes to eat first. Well. After the shower. Didn't Thor manage to make spaghetti yesterday? Or was that some terrifying fever dream?”
“I can’t really tell, and I don’t want to ask, or put my nose right on him, it wouldn’t be proper.”  He fell into a sort of pseudo parade rest as he spoke.  The saleswoman-Julia her nametag said-her eyebrows rose, and she smiled as if she’d just been given the best present in the world.
“Just answer me, why did you go and fight this fight that wasn’t yours?”  The man asked again, and Steve could have slid over the hood of the car, could have run, but something about the man made him answer.
For a moment it's enough to cut through the panic making his hearing fuzz in and out, but it's soon back full force. His glass drops, shattering on the ground and spilling watered down whiskey everywhere. Some of the liquid hits his face, and he remembers being held under water, remembers hands in his chest.  JARVIS is listing off legal offenses to a cowering Justin Hammer. He hears something about conspiracy to commit treason before he's putting his head between his knees and trying to get his breathing back under control. The grass is nice and soft at least, even if the air coming into his lungs burns with the force of his inhales.
Tony lifts his head to stare at Steve. “Did you get that from Dr. Acharya, that um. That sounds like a very her thing to say.”
“Hi, welcome to Pinkberry, what do you want?” Says the woman behind the counter.  Tony doesn't think that's the corporate approved greeting, but he doesn't really care. The girl clearly doesn't recognize them, and that's so rare that it's worth its weight in gold.
He didn’t sleep well that night again, but the dreams were not as terrifying as they had been.  He woke, hard enough to pound nails and wrapped up in his blankets hopelessly.  It took a good few minutes to work himself out, and thirty minutes with his hand in the shower to calm himself down enough to be presentable for breakfast.
“Steve is fine, I'm living in your house, seems funny to have you call me that.” He's proud of how steady his voice sounds, it's not every day a guy that looks like a matinee idol welcomes you into his home.  Stark beams at him, seemingly unconcerned by the thought of having a stranger move into his place. No matter how huge the mansion is, it's still an awfully swell thing for him to do.
“Oh-” Steve gasps, overcome just with the way Tony feels inside. He's so soft, hole still gripping at his finger, leaking Steve's come when he carefully works a second finger into him. Tony's hand grips more tightly on his knee, and he blows out another breath, groaning as Steve curls his fingers inside him, just the way Tony does when he's making Steve crazy with want from this same thing. Steve remembers how good it always feels, how amazing Tony makes him feel. He wants to make Tony feel like that too, to make everything dissolve into pleasure and want, to please him and show him how much he loves him. His eyes are bright, watching Steve, his mouth open and wet, and Steve strokes him inside, moaning himself as Tony's body flutters around his fingers, as Tony's stomach quivers and he twists into Steve's touches.
Up ahead, walls rose up out of the ground, encircling a courtyard, and he picked up voices over the wall, one of which he recognized instantly. It was Zemo’s voice, calling out orders imperiously, Steve wouldn’t be surprised if he’d sat himself atop some kind of palanquin. It seemed like something he would do.
“Here, let me help you out there, I hear it’s trickier with gloves on.”  The gloves Tony wore were a thin, supple leather, perfect for fine detail work, but he still let Steve take his hand.  They were standing so close Steve could smell the fresh mint on Tony’s breath.  He could have counted every individual inky black eyelash ringing Tony’s lids.  Tony smelled good, spicy, clean, and very faintly, a little sweet.  His hand trembled a minutely in Steve’s grip, and Steve realized his pulse was rabbiting away unsteadily.  That was strange, maybe too much coffee.  He breathed in deep when Steve fixed the first link in place, then placed his other wrist in Steve’s hand, easily, like he trusted him implicitly.  Steve imagined fixing jeweled bracelets around that wrist, the kind you might gift after bonding.  They’d sure look good on him.  Not that that would ever happen.  With that thought reality reasserted itself.  Steve let go of Tony’s hand.  The cufflinks glimmered at his wrists, they looked good there, like they belonged.  Tony was staring up at him, his mouth slightly open.
“Have you-” He swallows, voice going high at the end. “been holding those like that this whole time?” Tony sounds completely caught off guard, eyes wide as saucers.  Steve nods, taking the uniform from Tony's lax fingers before he drops it on the floor. Tony's mouth opens and closes, he looks at the flowers, then back up at Steve, repeating the circuit a few times. Steve steps closer, holding the gold tissue wrapped stems out in offering.
“I'm going to buy dinner and ask Mister Stark to come up and eat with us.” Tony feels the straw fall out of his mouth. Is he kidding? Steve has got to be kidding. He cannot possibly want to eat dinner with
“You’re sure?” He whispered, and Steve squeezed Tony more tightly against himself. Tony was such a study in contradictions. Steve wondered how it could be sometimes, that Tony could stand in front of a million cameras and smile like a shark, and then do something like this and think Steve could be angry at him for it.
“Yeah, whassa matter with it?” he asked, plucking at the material of the shirt. He supposed he was a little sweaty.
“It's good Steve, feels good, you always feels so good.” Tony finally manages. The words sound dredged out of him. He sighs when Steve shifts inside him, reaching back to pull at soft blond hair, twisting his torso for a kiss-which Steve gives him eagerly; their tongues meeting and breaths sharing as Steve slowly begins to move. The first thrust makes Tony whine, the second makes him gasp, pulling away from their kiss to drop his head back on Steve's shoulder, letting Steve hold him up with a hand splayed over his belly, and the other on his chest. He's spread wide open, right knee up on the desk, and Steve reaches down, touching over where they're joined, then getting a hand around Tony's cock to stroke him off.
Tony had emerged from the icebox with one of his horrible green smoothies, and was busily slurping away at it while sitting at the counter behind Steve.  He smiled around his straw when he noted Steve looking, but it seemed like he was in a hurry.  It looked like he was trying to do up the French cuffs on his shirt, and not having a whole lot of success.  Tony frowned, and then swore under his breath, as something tiny and round hit the floor and rolled.
good. Is it? Tony shakes himself, stepping out of the lab, only to yelp as he runs into a solid wall of Steve just as he's exiting the elevator on the first floor of the mansion.
The envelope is addressed to Tony Stark. Tony stares at it, one hand outstretched, before he thinks better of touching it without running some diagnostics first.
Red. Red and gold in front of him. Gleaming like a diamond cut ruby. Iron Man catches both sides of the bus hard-Turning the momentum into a spin around Steve worthy of a dancer. Sparks shoot up off the pavement when the broken edges of the bus hit the ground, but the people inside are still screaming. Steve has a moment to feel the gut clenching feeling of relief. Screaming people are living people after all.
He stares at them. They stare back. It's dead silent in the room, or it would be if Steve's hearing wasn't going haywire. Everything is buzzing as if it's electrified. It's not loud, just a low ever-present hum resonating in his ears with disconcerting unfamiliarity.  Nothing seems familiar in fact, everything looks wrong, as if he's stepped out of his world into a completely new one.  The hairs on the back of his neck stand up the way they always have when something wasn't right.
“Steve, that was not at all what I meant.” Tony was looking over at him, a soft, gentle look that spoke of understanding. Steve firmed his jaw, as amazing as Tony’s touch had felt, he couldn’t have that. Not all the time, not again. Sure Tony seemed like he was feeling fine now, but Steve was out of commission for twenty hours. There was no telling how awful he might’ve felt while Steve was doing his best Rip Van Winkle impression.
Some indeterminate amount later he realized he’d dozed off with his head on Tony’s knee.  The room was quiet, the lights drawn down.  Tony’s head was leaned back on the couch, he was holding his phone over his face, the blue light from it leaving the rest of him in darkness.  Upon feeling Steve stir, he set his phone down and smiled.
here, we have a sinkhole to worry about if we don't take this guy down in oh, fifty seconds and change,” Tony calls, and suddenly they're all business. A loud crunching clang sounds as Carol's hands join his in grabbing onto the Ferris wheel, and with her comes the thwipping taps of webbing hitting the other side, trying to compensate for all that acceleration and momentum, and compensating somewhat for the massive force Carol is able to exert. Some of the webs snap, but slowly the wheel begins comes to a stop without breaking in half.
“It's powered by its own Arc Reactor, bulletproof, friction dampening, and able to survive various temperature extremes. Best of all it's nice and stretchy, I could make these for anyone on the team and have it fit.” Tony pauses, scrawling math across one of the floating screens. “Well, it probably wouldn't fit our lean green angry bean, but most everyone else should be covered.” Tony says idly, shifting from foot to foot, and the motion makes Steve want that body under his hands. Steve
Man of Iron. It said you had 'the heart he craves so deeply.' I know not who it is the Níðhöggr referred to, but it has taken an interest in you.”  Thor says, walking over to lay a Hand on Iron Man's shoulder.  Steve wants to find whatever godforsaken space rock the thing has been banished to and beat it to a bloody pulp.
“Don't have to say it back, just wanted you to know.” That's not right, Steve can't possibly think the feeling is anything but mutual.
“I believe there are many people in your life whom would debate the first half of that statement-myself included."  JARVIS' tones are soothing, and it makes Tony's eyes well up with how much it reminds him of his namesake.  How many times had the human Jarvis used this tone when coaxing him from a hiding place?  How many times had he held a handkerchief to Tony's face while he sobbed about something Howard had done?  But no, as much as he wants to believe what JARVIS is saying, he also can't put people he loves-people who love him in return for some reason-in danger.
. Tony seems to understand what he can't form into words though, arching up and catching Steve's panting, open mouth with his in a kiss. He loses track of himself for a moment, loses himself to the way tony is kissing him; one hand traveling up his back to clench in his short cropped blond hair, the other hard on his rear, holding him there as Tony grinds against him, holding him still to rub his cock where he needs it most. Steve tries to give him what he needs too, rolling his hips, trying to keep his rhythm steady; he knows that's what Tony likes, when he's fucking Steve and his strokes become uniform, almost precise, he knows that's a sure sign Tony is about to come. He tries his best to give that to Tony now, pulling away from Tony's mouth to tuck his face against his chest, so he can focus on not coming, knowing if he keeps kissing him, it will all be over too soon.
“It’s beautiful.”  He said quietly.  “Are there other colors? I'd like to buy one.”  He smiled, a little shyly, feeling the heat on his face.  “It’s not the gift I’ll make my intentions known with, but maybe one day.”  He shrugged, feeling foolish and hopeful at once.  Julia just gave him a brilliant smile and immediately moved into showing him more options than he could shake a stick at.  He settled on a delicate gold set, with deep blood colored garnet.  He didn’t look at the price, he didn’t want to know.  Everything was too expensive anyway, he didn’t have a frame of reference yet, and the cost wouldn’t stop him anyway.
The ground rumbled more, then shook violently.  The cheer crew went running off to the sidelines as the turf was ripped open by some kind of gigantic mechanized drill.  Through the holes in the ground, dozens of diminutive humanoid creatures streamed out, making way for a stocky guy in a green jumpsuit and goggles.
“Ave Maria, gratia plena,”  He said under his breath.  He closed his eyes, swallowed, and then sat on the bed beside Steve.  “Close your eyes Steve.”  It was an easy request to follow, his eyes already felt heavy, his body felt tired, as if he’d been running without respite for years and finally gotten to rest.  “Thank you.”  Tony murmured, slipping a hand into Steve’s hair.
“Sorry ma’,”  He said, she just sighed again, grabbed his chin, and tilted his face around to get a good look.
“Boyfriend? Lover? Partner?” JARVIS supplies much more carefully than tony would have expected from his ever snarky AI. “Whatever the case, yes I have, and the results are overwhelmingly positive.” JARVIS finishes smugly, bringing up an array of charts, graphs, and one really sad video of Tony staring at a picture of Steve in the workshop after the whole gala incident of ultimate FUBAR-itude. Maybe that's not a word, he doesn't care, it is now.
“Caught with my hand in the cookie jar I guess, time to fess up then?” Steve said, smiling ruefully. He felt it as his cheeks heated however, hearing Tony refer to him as his favorite hero.
“That was really something.” Tony murmurs, hissing under his breath with overstimulation when Steve pulls out of him slowly and traces around his hole.
General Phillips was a story in himself, stern and eagle eyed, he watched over all the cadets in a way that made even the cockiest of them pause.  Steve didn’t know what he was looking for exactly, but he and Dr. Erskine often stood watch while the cadets all trained.  Steve knew enough about the military to know generals typically did not pay a whole lot of attention to cadets, but it was clear he and Dr. Erskine were highly invested.  They didn’t say much, and it was unnerving as all get out, but it definitely made Steve try even harder, put his best foot forward, for what it was worth.
“Iron Man. I-” He's shaking. Tremors work up his arms, there's a ringing in his ears, and the recessed lighting glows with bright halos like the phosphorous strike of a match.
“C'mere then sweetheart.” Steve murmurs, gliding his hand over Tony's jaw then down to curl around the loosened knot of his tie. Light and shadow slants across their faces as he's tugged down.
Steve sighs, but he nods, leaning in to brush his lips over Tony's cheek.  “Okay, just don't disappear for too long, fella. Everyone will be sad without you around, and I miss you.” Steve has that smile on his face again, the one that makes Tony want to write him soppy love letters. He lets Steve hug him again because there's nothing he can possibly say to that without sounding fucking pathetic. It's so nice to be touched gently, so nice that he almost doesn't want to leave the circle of Steve's arms.
“I need you to promise me something.” Steve says, coming over to crouch in front of him before he can answer Pepper. Tony swallows when big hands wrap around his own.
“It's gonna be okay Tones, we've got you.” Rhodey is still speaking, but behind him, the television has shifted to a breaking news story. He hears it as if from far away, and in the glass of the big bay windows he sees his own face reflected back. A news ticker rolls beneath it, stock prices and something called S.I. Is blowing up the market with fantastic new technology.
Tony shrieks in a truly undignified fashion, limbs starfishing out before he's pushing at Steve's head, dissolving into uncontrollable laughter. It's a sound Steve has heard so rarely from Tony that he can't help but inhale and blow another on the warm skin of Tony's stomach.
During rut, in the war he’d ripped guns off of tanks, climbed many a vertical wall. Mamula, even with all of the fortifications, and all of Zemo’s hideously garbed henchmen, didn’t pose much of a challenge. The shield was conspicuous, so he opted for his hands instead, creeping up behind Zemo’s men, and knocking them out with an uppercut to the jaw or a blow to the head. Concussions could certainly be dangerous, but this was playing it nice as far as Steve was concerned. He knew none of these alphas and betas would hesitate to kill him, or bring him before Zemo, so he could get in the killing blow. He’d shown mercy the last time he and Zemo met, but not today. He had every intention of wiping the sorry sock faced bastard off the face of the Earth, before he could cause more harm to civilians and his team.
“If he gets along with you, I’m sure I would.”  He said sincerely, and Tony seemed pleased to hear it too, if his sweet little smile was anything to go by.  He was so handsome, so beautiful just sitting there across from Steve as if he had nowhere better to be.  Steve swallowed, finding his tongue to speak again.  “How was it anyway?  The shareholder meeting that is?”  At that Tony sat back, staring into his cards with great attention, giving a great blustering sigh.
Sometime in the intervening hours between the ceremony and the after party-which Tony refuses to call a reception-Tony ends up on the opposite side of the lounge. Steve leans against the bar and watches the motion of his lips, the animated gestures of his hands, and the dark swoop of his hair where it has gotten just long enough to curl over his cheek.
“I know you do, and trust me, watching you enjoy yourself is the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen.”  Tony shifts up, pushing the tray back and then swinging a leg over to take a seat atop Steve's thighs. Steve tries not to focus on the very sure knowledge that Tony is completely bare beneath that robe, and sitting on his lap.  “I also know you've been wanting this, and I want it too.”
After dinner, Steve went to his room.  He could feel the drop coming.  They had won the fight with Kang, but there were too many close calls, too many variables unaccounted for.  He felt there was more he could be doing.  The sight of the armor unmoving and their comm links with Tony silent still sat ill with him.  He knew Tony was fine, had said he was fine, as were the others, but he just couldn’t shake it, that feeling he wasn’t doing enough, wasn’t protecting the team as well as he should be.
“Oh.”  Tony stared down at the cappuccino cup in Steve’s hand.  He liked the idea of it, making something for the fella he was sweet on, giving him something he liked, taking care of him, even if it was in such a small way.  Tony took the cappuccino from his hands.  Steve felt the tips of his ears go red as Tony took a sip of it, looking up at Steve from under his lashes.  “Steve, this is amazing.”  He said after a moment, taking another long sip.  “How do you know how I like my coffee?”
The pajamas are just as soft and warm as his other pair when he slips them on.  He remembers the last time he wore another pair of these. Tony's quick, agile fingers doing up the buttons, the pleased curve of his smile, the comforting press of his lithe body against his in the bed as he told him how good he looked in blue.  It makes him feel a little hot under the collar to think of what they had been doing prior to the pajamas coming into play, but lately just thinking about Tony in general makes him feel overheated and red in the face. Well, maybe Tony has always made him feel that way, if he's being completely honest with himself.  Accepting that, and seeking it out had taken more time though. Time and Tony Stark's immeasurable bravery in asking Steve for a date when he expected a punch instead. He can't really put into words now how grateful he is that Tony had that bravery, because now they have this, and it's really the best thing that's ever happened to him.
“I'm fine, just superficial stuff, nothing a few days of being lazy won't fix.” He lies. Steve stares at him as if he knows it's a lie, but thankfully he doesn't call him on it.
Magic. No scratch that, not magic, but just as astounding, the future, she's the future.”  Tony is doing that thing he does sometimes, where his brain is moving so quickly that he seems to buzz with energy.  His eyes are bright, belying the mind behind them working away feverishly.
Had there been a fairy fluttering around his face?  Was he having dreams about Tinkerbelle now?  That was new, but not unwelcome.
He feels it draw tight in his belly, the sensation sucking him under like a tide. Sometimes his orgasms are slow, molasses sweet, a sigh out while his toes curl. This one punches through him when Steve thrusts deep, grinding against his prostate, holding his hips pinned against the pillows while his callused fingers squeeze around his cock in a perfect slide. His ears are ringing, rushing, he's gasping something out against the pillow, grabbing at the sheets and biting down on soft cotton. Steve strokes him through it, whispering into his ear and rocking their hips together to draw it out. Tony slumps against the bed, utterly spent, jerking and groaning as Steve thrusts once, twice, then holds there, coming with an loud, decadent moan of his own.
“Steve.” Tony breathes out, and Steve nearly groans when he feels a tiny shiver work through Tony's body. His other hand falls to his side while he stands up to lean over Tony on the couch.  “
“He's fine guys, just a hiccup I think.” Rhodey murmurs, slinging an arm around his shoulder. Tony takes a deep steadying breath when Pepper takes his hand.
“Really.” He murmurs against Tony's lips, kissing him slowly, sweetly despite what they had been doing just moments earlier.
“Thank you, and, I feel I have to say, Tony is correct,” She shot him a little wink, “that is a sentence of at least ten years in the Dakotas.”
“All I want is you, want to make you happy, seeing you enjoy yourself, that's what I want.” Steve's voice is hoarse, his kisses grow a little firmer, but they don't progress into anything heavier. Tony feels as if he's coming apart at the seams with frustration.
“Sometimes when you're in your workshop, or at the data crux it's all I can do not to bend you over your desk right then. Or to ask you to bend
they get the whole secret identity thing. And Steve would be lucky to have you, okay. I mean what the hell man, it's so obvious he wants the whole white picket fence things with you that I'm going to start picking out wedding colors for the two of you.”
He took two cold showers that night and still ended up with his hands down his pants and his face buried in Tony’s blanket.  He supposed it could have been worse, it did help him finally get a few hours of sleep.  Enough to be sharp and at the ready should any Avengers alert sound.
They don't leave the car for another thirty minutes, when they finally do stumble out, clothes askew and looking rumpled, Clint is laying across the Ferrari on the other side of the garage with his back to them, eating what looks to be an entire box of ring dings.
Tony blinked over at him, his eyes were wide, “I,” his hand shook, he set the water bottle down on the coffee table, an elegant glass and metal thing that looked a little like a spaceship, “I am very available, Steve, heinously single even-I stopped taking them because they were interacting with other medications I take.”
Next week. He thinks; watching Tony gleefully accept a shower of confetti and tinfoil thrown all over him by Jan. Next week he's going to lay it all on the line.
“He doesn't have to, I mean, it's his place right? I don't want to impose.” He's hesitant to just move into a veritable stranger's place, but Jan just shakes her head.
Later after the serum it's almost overwhelming. His hearing is so sharp that he no longer has to press his ear close to hear. Peggy's heart is strong and sure, steady as a rock even as she's buffeted on all sides. The soldiers don't believe in her at first, but she makes them see.
“Tony that's not-” But it's too late, Tony is already off and running back over by Jan in pursuit of another drink. Steve slumps, rubbing a hand over his face with the air of a man condemned to death row. Rhodes makes his way over, patting his back comfortingly and pressing a glass full of bright pink liquid into his hand.
“Put a pink swizzle stick in my whiskey, I feel fancy.” He says to the bartender, dropping a few large bills into his tip jar when he gets not one but
“You read the comics about me?”  Steve said, feeling unaccountably shy.  He wondered if there was any truth to them, or if they’d been as over grandiose as the movies.
“Just relax honey, when the water is all set, we'll have that bath, and you can look me over, as promised,” Tony says, waggling his eyebrows in a way that both makes Steve feel hot all over and makes him laugh.
Tony smiles, holding up a box of tiny gum paste jingle bells.  “I know big green, brought these just for you. Party next week too. I'm having hats made.” Thor perks up at that, snatching his hand away from where it's been creeping towards Natasha's box of cookie dough.
“Gimme a second.” Tony pants. “Just a second I need-need to calm down or I'm gonna come.” Tony squeezes his eyes shut, blowing out a gusty breath. Steve settles atop him, cock a hard heavy line resting snug up against the cleft of his ass. “God
“Jay is JARVIS, he's an AI-an artificial intelligence, but he's more alive than any of the corporate brass I've been forced to make nice with over the years. Jay is a work of art. He's on your phone too if you need him, or well, he can be if you call to him. Not important. Skynet, big brother he is not, he's my sweet baby my smartest child-”
Tony refuses to say anything else on the subject of Tiberius Stone; sitting silent and tense in his seat on the quinjet until they arrive back at the mansion. It's like a bucket of cold water being thrown over them both after their heated confessions in the SHIELD compound. Still, Tony doesn't shy away when he takes his hand and twines their fingers together. Steve doesn't let go until they disembark, but that is only so he can wrap an arm around Tony's waist, drawing him close while they follow the others into the debriefing room. JARVIS follows them closely in the armor, resting a comforting hand on Tony's shoulder when he takes a seat at the debriefing table. Brown eyes widen slightly, darting around nervously as Tony seemingly realizes he's taken Iron Man's usual spot, but he relaxes visibly, deliberately. Steve says nothing, taking his own seat and giving Tony's leg a squeeze beneath the table. There's a heavy silence around the room. It's clear no one wants to press Tony, but the curiosity is palpable.
“What if I do” He starts, fingers skating upwards to thumb over flat dusky nipples. Tony gasps, shaking sweaty hair out of his eyes to stare up at him disbelievingly.  “What If I do mean something by this, what if I've meant something by it the whole time?” He finishes, growing quieter and more hesitant as he speaks, struck with the sudden terror that he's just ruined their friendship, that Tony has really been joking all along-that he's read to much into everything, that even Rhodes, and countless others have read this all wrong- and Tony will never look at him the same way again. The only sounds in the room are Tony's shuddering breaths, and the pounding of his own heart in his ears.
“Don’t worry about it being warm, I have an ac unit in my room.”  He said, his voice sounded choked and thin.
“These are, wow Tony, I've been looking at these, how did you know?” He murmurs, lifting the biggest box of watercolor pencils he's ever seen out of the wrapping. Tony looks pleased with himself, accepting Steve's hug when he sets the pencils down to do just that.
When Steve manages to crack his eyes open again, Tony looks up at him and winks, before laying down on his side between his legs as if he's decided to take up residence there. The robe pools over Tony's hip, and Tony grabs the corner of it, and wraps the red silk around his own cock, stroking himself once and giving a slow rolling thrust into his own silk covered hand. At the same time that hot wet mouth slides further down, and Tony moans around him. Tony wants him to see, has probably noticed how Steve watches him when he's all draped in luxurious fabrics and a little mussed. He's so shameless; and just amazing, and Steve can't contain the sounds of pleasure he makes, or tear his eyes away as Tony touches himself in slow languid strokes.
He is running through a field, chasing a specter he no longer remembers the look of when he sees him; an indistinct shape far off on a verdant hill, standing in front of a towering mansion. Blue eyes. He thinks, as his shape begins to take form. Blue eyes and hair darker than the sticks of charcoal he uses for sketching. Steve turns away from that specter, away from the past, and he reaches, pulling away from the broken wreck of a plane around him, he reaches towards this familiar yet unfamiliar face, bright, so bright, like a lit candle wick on the darkest of nights.
“A long time Cap, a really really long time.” Even through the voice modulation they sound sad for him.
“The Avengers, you're one of us.” Catsuit interjects, watching the doctor who's just entered the room closely.
his beard before pulling him into a kiss that's sweet and dirty and utterly ruinous to whatever composure Tony has left. Who allowed Captain America to kiss like
“I thought erroneously that the two of you were engaged in an affair, but the Captain tells me that is incorrect. I was merely expressing my sympathies that such a talented and beautiful man has slipped through his meaty incapable fingers.”
It's a tiny scrap of silky fabric; hot-rod red, the same color as the armor. The thin string of it runs up between his crease. Steve feels the air leave him in a long exhalation.
“And I have won the bet, as I knew I would, It's almost worth it to see that mad skull if only to collect.” Steve crosses his arms over his chest, glaring down at Doom.
“Tony...you like-that?” Steve pants out. Wide dilated eyes meet his when Steve brings his hand away from Tony's hip to stroke over one flushed cheek.
“How are you feeling?” Bucky says, grabbing him and producing a penlight from god knows where to shine it right in Tony's eyes. Steve has a hold of his chin, and Rhodey is patting his back. Tony feels like his life might be one giant cosmic joke.
Sometimes he catches whiffs of cologne. It’s woodsy and fresh, similar but different to Howard’s favorite scent-and he wonders, locked away in his room, drawing the watery shapes he sees in dreams across paper-he wonders if his other half is his father’s age.  Thinks of the whispers that follow Howard.  “Such a young son” they say, reading his father’s gray hair like the rings on a tree.  He listens and wonders if he finds his One, will they brush him aside?  Will they call him foolish, will they look at his designs for clean energy and solar fuel, and crumple them up, wad them up like paper, like his heart every time Howard turns away.
Steve shook his head, holding the door open wider in invitation.  “No, I’m up, I was just about to go on a run.”  That was a lie, but he needed some excuse to be awake and fully dressed early in the morning.  He didn’t have a job like Tony’s to be off too.
He still fell ill around October, bronchitis taking hold of him and not leaving until December.  It was in December of 1941 that the congress finally did what they should have done years prior, and it would have meant a lot more to Steve had it not taken Pearl Harbor to get congress’ collective heads out of their rear ends.
“This one's for you.” Says Tony, sidling into Steve's space to hold out a tinsel bedecked tree.  “This too, had one made for you.” A sweater like the one Tony had been wearing a few days ago joins his armful of holiday swag. It's soft, green with tiny red versions of his shield all over it. Tony watches him cautiously, as if he's afraid Steve will refuse him.
“Kind of don't want to let you out of the room.” Steve admits, sitting back on the loveseat and raking his eyes up and down Tony's body as if he really likes what he sees.  Tony almost considers playing roulette with the Widow. But no. No. Even Tony is not that reckless, and he's
“Oh I. Well.” Tony stammers, his cheeks flushing his olive skin a brilliant scarlet. “Then yes, museum sounds great, so great.”
The flight back to the quinjet is much slower and quieter than usual. Iron Man scans his arm periodically, murmuring to JARVIS in that strange language he's heard him use with the bots down in the lab. “I can't believe you jumped on that thing with your arm broken.” He's says finally after yet another scan.
“What, no, I wasn't-” Steve sputters, halting abruptly when Tony gives another little snicker. “You, you shaddup.” Steve grouses, clearly put out.
Steve felt he needed to show some initiative as well, figure out a little more about the team he would be rooting for, and the number on his new shirt.  The game wasn’t for another week, so Steve went to get his new tablet out and looked up the names of all the players on the Seahawks.
“Tony,”  He rasps, “thank you, for, for letting me, God, Tony-”  He reaches out tentatively, wanting so much to touch; and Tony lets him, canting his hips up higher and rolling his head back on the mattress as Steve rubs his thumbs over his hole gently.  Tony shivers, holding more tightly to his knee, watching Steve look at him with hooded eyes. His cock is hard, dark and flushed, curved up and smearing wetly against his skin.
“Not to be rude, but what the fuck is in my chest?” Tony grits out.  A round of swearing meets his question; the source of which turns out to be an unfairly gorgeous blond who also happens to be built like a tank. Actually everyone in the room is entirely too good looking. They also all look a little like someone kicked a puppy. Tony licks his lips nervously, eyes darting around the room. He feels like maybe he should be apologizing.
“I don't want a lot for Christmas, there is just one thing that I need-” Tony coos, crawling up onto Steve's lap to share his drink. It burns slightly on the way down, warm and spiced, and tasting just the way he remembers. Tony is still singing, the words interspread by barely contained laughter. Steve loves him so much in this moment he can barely contain it; joining Tony in singing the song he's heard playing everywhere from department stores to restaurants since November. Tony is clearly delighted, hopping off his lap to grab his hand. Steve follows him back into the party, offering no resistance when Tony pulls him onto a dancefloor he doesn't recall being there earlier. No point in wondering about that, things have a way of appearing as needed in the tower. Steve wouldn't be surprised if it was JARVIS doing somehow. Jan, Natasha, and Clint are dancing together, which soon becomes Hulk carrying the three of them in a graceless but tipsy laughter filled waltz.
Steve seems to agree, sweeping him in with one hand, deepening the kiss so effortlessly that Tony wonders if he was taking notes while they made out on the couch last night. That thought seems less important when Steve uses his grip to hoist Tony a little higher-making his feet leave the ground. It shouldn't be this hot, and typically he might balk at being so easily moved around, but this is
“Something new, darling, something we haven't tried yet.  I am glad you have been enjoying yourself so much. Do let me know, I need the encouragement.”  Tony murmurs, sounding amused, but his skin has gone hot where Steve touches it, and he's smiling almost shyly.
There was a part of him, a big part that wanted to join the army too, that felt drawn to the idea of protecting people, of making the world safer for everyone, all those amazing posters of brave alphas and betas going off to the great war.  He knew he wasn’t really army material as it stood, but he was sure by the time he was eighteen, he’d be a real adult then, all grown up.
“I thought we might have something nice and simple for dessert, something you mentioned wanting to do with-”  Tony clears his throat “your sweetheart someday.”
“Whatever Tony says, I believe him, I knew Ty too, he's a jerk!” Jan's voice cuts through the room. She's perched in her chair, color high in her cheeks with sympathetic anger. Tony laughs, shoulders slumping. He takes a long sip from the glass before speaking again.
“There are eyes everywhere.”  He had said, clasping Steve’s shoulder.  It was an ominous statement, one Steve remembered later, when catastrophe struck, but at that moment he could only nod.
“You are good enough. No, no, no arguing, Rhodey time now.” Rhodey says, ignoring Tony's sputters and pointing to himself imperiously-the great big dork.  Tony feels unaccountably fond, despite that being tempered by a bit of indignance.  “You listen to me Anthony Edward Stark. I
Steve has always found heartbeats to be soothing, almost mystical in their cadence. He remembers curling up with Bucky when he was small and skinny, and the draftiness of his tiny apartment in the winter made it dangerous to sleep alone. Bucky's heartbeat is strong and steady where Steve's sometimes flutters and beats too slow or too fast.
“I’ve seen him in ah, pictures with gloves but, I haven’t even given him a letter of intent yet, seems a little premature.”  He said, but still reached down to touch one of the gloves, it was a velvet burnout lace, fine and probably handcrafted.  Wedded gloves were made of silk, often with the fingers exposed or the fingertips capped with precious metal.  Steve imagined Tony wearing something like that and felt himself flush red.
“You did great out there, really fine work, Shellhead, but are you alright?” Steve repeated, fighting the urge to ask Tony to take the armor off so he could check him over properly.
“You're gonna love the Mansion Captain Rogers. It's really nice, and I'm sure Tony will give you a good room.”  Wasp says brightly, smiling at him wide and encouraging.
“For the road.” He says, drawing his hand away slowly.  Tony purses his lips, looking down at the muffin then back up at Steve.
“Course I am sweetheart, I was waiting for you.” Steve says carefully, sitting up in their bed slowly and holding a coaxing hand out towards his lover, palm up, fingers slightly curled. Brown eyes stare down at the offered hand for a long wordless minute.
The first touch of their lips is more a question than anything else. Just a dry rub of their mouths together. Steve's lips are so soft, warm, just the simple contact sends shiver down Tony's spine, and god Tony wants this so badly. Steve hums, tilting his head to brush his lips over Tony's again, one of his arms goes around Tony's waist, pulling him closer, pressing their bodies together tightly. Okay, so maybe Steve and the word shy should never be in the same sentence. Tony's arms are trapped between their bodies, so he wiggles them out, getting his fingers into silky blond hair, opening his mouth against Steve's, and deepening the kiss with the experience of long practice. Steve tastes warm, sweet, like the lambic he'd been drinking earlier, and the tiny chocolate kisses he had been eating by the handful. Tony can't get enough.
“Now, let’s see, what do you think of this, for your first courting gift then?”  Julia said, shifting boxes around until she found one with rows of small square compartments.  Tucked within each square were all sorts of fancy cufflinks.  Some were polished precious metals, others were enameled or inset with gemstones.  “This is a nice, neutral sort of gift, it says ‘I’m interested’ without being presumptuous.”
“You didn't even buy me dinner first, I'm appalled.” Tony snarks, but he's rolling to his feet, grabbing Steve's hand to haul him up as he goes.
“I look pretty in red just so you know, I refuse to wear a white tux. It's gotta be...gotta be red.” He croaks out with none of his usual savoir-faire.
“Getting hard for me again?” Tony speaks between kisses, but he's looking at Steve, and his gaze is so proprietary, as if Steve is his, really his, and Steve feels himself melt into that feeling. He wants to be Tony's, only for him, and Tony smiles as if he knows that too. His hands feel like they're everywhere, but Steve nearly cries out as they wrap around his cock and stroke there once, pulling the foreskin over the head then down again.
“Not helping.” Natasha says from beside him, Tony shrugs, he tried, and getting Steve to let go of something once his mind is set is like prying turkey from an alligator's mouth, or something like that. Anyway, point stands, and no one seems all that intent on helping Hammer. Clint is just whispering '
“Our date got interrupted.” Tony murmurs against his lips after an indeterminate amount of time. It's the first time Tony has brought up their dates without being prompted first, and Steve feels a hot burst of joy unfurl in his chest.
“So sure, c'mon Rogers, not getting any younger here.” Tony lets his head sink back down, and Steve laughs quietly. Soft shuffling behind him, the bed dips, Steve wedging his knee between Tony's thighs to push them apart slightly. The click of a cap, and then hot, and slick, and pressure, one finger dipping inside him, testing, curving to work him back open. Last night Steve had been in him, and he in Steve, Tony knows without a doubt that he's still at least a little loose, but Steve never seems to care about that. Tony just thinks he gets off on watching him squirm on his fingers. Although, Tony can sympathize. Watching Steve desperate and writhing is one of his favorite things, he can't blame Steve for feeling the same.
“Winghead you're out of your mind, your arm is broken-get off of it, get off, the reactor is going to-” Iron Man says frantically.  Steve has a split second to throw himself to the side, the monster slams another hand back down on the reactor, claws boring through the armor like a hot knife through butter. Iron Man makes a truly horrifying sound over the comms, and then the reactor is shooting a giant beam of concentrated energy through the creature. A protective measure, and surely not one that can be repeated more than a handful of times. For a moment it seems to have stopped the monster, it rears back, hissing and spitting, but the respite lasts only a moment before it's grabbing at the Armor's chest again.
“You would be correct, but I admire your spirit.” JARVIS' answer sparks with a current of dry amusement.  Steve thinks he might be getting sassed. He's honestly kind of delighted by the thought. It's nice to be treated like just a normal guy.
“No founding fathers in the bedroom, only Steve. Besides, I was promised red? Possibly a show?” Tony raises his eyebrows imploringly, hands skating up Steve's chest as he leans over Tony's prone form on the bed.
“You, you have had a first kiss before though right?” Tony doesn't know if the answer will change things for him, but he'll cross that bridge when they come to it.
Steve took some time to look at the equipment on offer, all had little diagrams to explain their use.  Steve smiled, well, that was nice of the manufacturer.  Still he wasn’t quite ready to test any of those shiny and new looking weight machines, but there was a whole row of punching bags visible from where he was standing.  That oughta do it, punching bags he knew.  A tray full of supplies sat just off the side.  There were soft mats and benches set against the wall just behind the area with the heavy bags, and sleek silver and glass boxes holding bottles with names like Gatorade and Monster, whatever the heck that was.  Steve decided on solving that mystery later, grabbing some tape off the supply tray and winding it around his hands.  He might have been surrounded by completely incomprehensible things, but he could still throw a punch.
He stays there for a little while until Tony comes looking for him. He's flushed and carrying a cup of eggnog, swaying into Steve's space and singing obnoxiously. His mistletoe headband has disappeared, and in its place a pair of sunglasses with blinking lights and tiny Santa hats on each lens are in its place.
“Disabling shots only Hawkeye.” He hears Cap say distantly, but Tony's mind is already miles ahead analyzing and extrapolating data. JARVIS projects what he already knows to be true, a lovely blue model of the Ferris wheel becoming the anchor for a gigantic sinkhole. Not good is an understatement.
“What for fella?  All of you were amazing just now, I don’t know where President Roosevelt has been keeping you all, but I sure am glad to meet you.”
, truly thank you for sharing your talent with us.  And also a wailing, hyper affectionate thank you to
“JARVIS is loaded up on all of your tech devices, if you need anything go through him, he knows what's should be safe for you to see. Avoid watching television, and heavily crowded spaces.” Natasha is rattling off from her checklist.
Steve followed the sounds of fighting up to the surface.  They were in a submarine of sorts.  It was a sleek thing, with too many windows, and glowing lights like some kind of deep sea leviathan out of a Jules Verne novel.  Steve was accustomed to submarines being cramped things, claustrophobic at the best of times, death traps at the worst.  This was like nothing he had ever seen.
ets.” Iron Man sounds a little miffed, but Steve doesn't doubt the truth of the statement. If it is Tony in the armor Steve is lucky it's not completely anatomically accurate. Steve might be a gentleman but he's got eyes. It doesn't escape his notice that Iron Man is keeping the conversation carefully light, as if he's afraid for Steve but trying not to show it. Steve appreciates the levity, it helps him push thoughts of the train even further down, helps him smile through the agony racing up his arm and poke back at his friend just a little bit.
“Keep any lab explosions away from Mister Stark if you can, we need him around here.”  He says, shooting Mister Stark a wink.  Tony looks scandalized, setting his now empty plate down and glaring between the two of them.
“Hungry?” He asks, holding out a plate with mashed potatoes, peas, and a piece of chicken out. How very Americana. Tony nods, taking the plate easily. Steve watches him as he eats, and soon Rhodey and Bucky join them, the latter leaning against the porch railing to do some stargazing of his own.
“There's someone I want you to talk to. Have you...have you talked to anyone about what you're feeling since you woke up?” Tony sounds vaguely horrified, the expression on his face growing to match the tone of his voice when Steve shakes his head.
“I-If that were to happen. The pheromones or that kinda thing.” Steve looks away now, but Tony can't look anywhere
It was nice, relaxed and casual in a way he didn’t think stepping out with Tony could have been.  Of course they weren’t stepping out, not like that, but it was still nice.  Tony chattered away, drank copious amounts of perrier, and happily signed autographs for the other restaurant patrons.  He was charming, witty, and so kind even when their meal kept getting interrupted.  He even drew one of his Iron Man stick figures on a napkin for a little tyke who bravely came over with his ma’.
With others there's a laugh on Tony's tongue and a joke at the ready, but when he flirts with Steve it seems different-sincere. So Steve flirts back, cautiously at first, then with increasing brazenness as it becomes wildly apparent that Tony is not going to make the first move. These days it's almost the only thing he can think of. Tony's face in the mornings, Tony's smile, Tony falling asleep in strange places, Tony, Tony, Tony. Steve feels as if he might as well be behind a window staring at something he can see but can't touch.
