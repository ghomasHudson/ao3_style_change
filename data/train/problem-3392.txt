“He told me that he loved me, and that just saying it was enough for The Empty to get him,” Dean bites out. He feels like throwing up. “I didn’t have time to say anything back.”
Sam gives them one last look before he packs his gear bag and leaves the bunker. Dean waits until the door closes before he picks Jack up and turns to Cas. He flashes a crooked grin and says, “We should go shopping.”
Dean drops down across from him at the table. He shoots his most confident grin at Cas and says, “I love presents.”
“I don’t know,” Cas says softly. “You, probably —” Dean smiles despite himself. “But, I suppose saving Jack and defeating Chuck would make me feel content enough. I’d like to know that you and Sam will be okay and that Jack has a home where he’s safe.”
; that he doesn’t need Cas. Except he knows it’s bullshit, and Sam probably knows it too. He could say that he needs Cas like he needs air; that he needs Cas like he needs something entirely separate from this world and the next, and none of that matters because Cas wants nothing to do with him right now. But, of course, Dean would rather die than say any of that out loud. Sam can fill in the blanks if he wants to. Hell, he probably already has.
Dean thinks Cas is going to pull away, so he loosens his grip just slightly, but Cas just moves around him to pour the coffee into the mug, so Dean tightens his grip again. It takes a moment and then Cas is in front of him, handing him the mug; Dean slides his hand over Cas’s, taking the coffee mug from him, and placing it on the counter behind him. Cas looks up at him, blinking, and Dean thinks, not for the first time, that he could drown in the blue of Cas’s eyes forever.
“Not quite,” Amara tells him and Dean feels like he’s just been punched in the gut. Amara explains, “Angels without their grace are human in the sense that they can no longer do the things that angels can do, but they’re not human in the sense that they have a human soul. An angel without its grace can return to its angelic state by consuming grace, but a human soul can never become an angel — well, not unless God does something about it.”
“Hey Cas,” He says, out loud, when he’s alone in his room. “I don’t know if you can hear me wherever you are. Well, probably not, but I hope you can. I went through everything we have in the archives, and I can’t find anything to get you out, but I’m not giving up.”
“I bet it hasn’t been easy for her to come back and not have you around either,” Dean points out, making sure to keep his voice level. Sam’s eyes shoot up to meet his, and Dean can see the guilt flood behind them. Gently, he says, “Listen, man, I’m not blaming you. It’s been hard for all of us, but take it from me, you can’t wait forever.”
It’s a relatively straightforward spell in terms of ingredients. All it really needs is Jack’s blood, Cas’s blood, and a few things that they already have in the bunker. Dean feels giddy with excitement as he draws a salt circle around himself.
. The thing that Dean learns very quickly is that Cas is insufferably competitive sometimes; it’s never about anything important, but for every great thing Dean does around the house, Cas has to one up him. Naturally, Dean can’t let that slide, so he’ll do something else. It actually works out well because the house needs a lot of work, and between the two of them egging each other on, most of the repairs are done. Dean quickly catalogues what’s left and decides that he’ll build a bookshelf for their bedroom for all of Cas’s terrible murder mystery novels.
Dean has to concede that’s true, but he still looks away from Cas, scratching the back of his neck. “I don’t know, Cas.”
They both turn around to look at Jack because he’s always the one to break the tie. Jack looks up from his homework and says, “The second one.”
“Cas, it’s okay,” Dean cuts him off. He doesn’t know whether he should laugh or burst into tears. He leans back against the headrest and closes his eyes. Quietly, he says, “I can do this, right?”
Dean immediately closes his eyes and tries to blink away the wetness pooling in his eyes. When he opens his eyes again, Cas's mouth is flat. He studies Dean with a sharp precision that only Cas can manage, and Dean feels like his insides are on fire. The way Cas can see right through him, no matter how many barriers he puts up, will always get to him. Cas has seen every inch of his soul, several times over, and he’s never looked as resigned as he does in this moment.
Right then, Jack runs past them and Dean instinctively reaches out to grab the back of Jack’s shirt to stop him. “Where do you think you’re going?”
Rowena bites her lip and shakes her head. “Well, no. I don’t think there’s anything that can kill God, but it could neutralize him and transfer his power to another being that can hold it. In this particular case, it would have to be Jack.” She shoots Jack an apprehensive look. “If he would be willing to do it.”
He hesitates. Jack meets his eyes with the kind of resolution that Dean has seen so many times over the years, most often in the mirror. It’s a look of a boy who thinks that the greater good is worth anything, even his life.
“Of course,” Cas says. There’s a twinkle in his eye. “I told you that he looks up to you and sometimes, he picks up your frustrating desire to run head first into every fight and not let us help.”
,” Dean says at the same time that Cas says, “Jack, your time will come, and even if it doesn’t, that’s okay too.”
He doesn’t even know if Jack could hear him anymore. Mila is still looking at him curiously. Dean clears his throat. “His name is Jack.”
“Okay, hold on. Let's get you up,” Dean says, helping Jack sit up. He cups Jack’s face and meets his eyes. Despite having all the power in the universe, he looks exhausted. Without thinking, Dean pulls him into a tight hug. Jack hesitates for a moment before wrapping his arms around Dean. “Hey, kid.”
It was Jack’s idea to start a fire in the backyard. He wants to go camping, and while none of them were willing to set up a tent, this seemed like an easy enough compromise. Dean grilled dinner with Eileen’s help, and Sam and Cas started the fire.
Cas studies him carefully and Dean suddenly worries that he made things weird again. Cas looks away from him and hunches towards the desk. Weakly, he says, “Dean, I’m afraid that I haven’t been honest with you.”
“Well, let’s get to it then,” Dean says, clapping his hands. He’s about to pick Jack up when he realizes that Jack is an actual, full blown, toddler. “Wait, we can’t take him with us.”
Dean sits up and lets out an exasperated sigh. Jack, satisfied at getting one of them up at least, rolls over. He lays on his back and blinks his saucer like, too big for his tiny face, eyes and smiles. Whatever sleepiness Dean was feeling instantly dissipates, and he grabs Jack around the waist to pull him up so that he’s sitting on Dean’s lap. He looks down to see Cas curling up against him, under the covers, his dark hair falling into his face and pillow creases decorating his face. It’s the cutest fucking thing Dean has ever seen.
definitely not searching for rings. He practically flings himself out of his chair in order to get his laptop as far away from himself as possible. Cas raises a brow. “Are you okay?”
Something flickers across Sam’s face and he gives Dean a knowing look and an even more knowing, shit eating grin. His eyes dance with amusement when he says, “Oh, trust me, I absolutely do not mind.” He looks between Cas, Dean, and Jack and grins again. “Let me know if you guys need any help.”
Dean checks his phone, hoping that Sam has something for them, but it’s radio silence. He eyes Jack as he toddles around the main room. At some point, he pulls a spellbook off the bottom bookshelf, opening it to a page. Dean feels a twist of anxiety coil inside him, and he exchanges a look with Cas. Realization dawns on both of them when they see Jack lifting one of his hands.
“She said she’ll help,” Dean tells her. He lightly touches the vial with Cas’s grace. “Jack and Cas aren’t back yet?”
He spots Cas’s truck parked on the gravel path leading to the cabin as they make their way off the trail. Dean moves to unlock the door, turning the light on in the entryway. The first thing he sees is Cas’s discarded blade and wallet on the kitchen table before he sees Cas on the couch. He’s on his back, an arm thrown over his face, with his eyes closed. The trench coat is discarded on the floor and his tie is undone.
“I’m of no use without them, Dean. I really couldn’t help Claire out on our hunt — which, luckily, was something minor and she was able to take care of it,” Cas says quietly, staring vacantly at the space between them. “Perhaps the best course of action is for me to burn through whatever is left of my grace and —” He inhales sharply, fixing his eyes on to Dean’s. “And then, burn out. At least then I could be of some use to you and the mission to defeat Chuck.”
“Once he’s back to normal, he’ll never let you live that down,” Dean explains, holding back a laugh. Jack just stares at them both.
Sam’s voice trembles as he recites, “Ar dia, tha sinn a faicinn do sholas agus ceangail e taobh a-staigh ar soitheach.”
Every so often, Dean remembers that this is his life now. Sam moved out of the bunker to share an apartment with Eileen. They come by every few weeks for Sunday lunch, and it’s shockingly normal for the Winchesters.  Every time Sam shares pictures of their apartment, Dean makes a note to look for one with Cas. Living in an underground bunker isn’t good for anyone, and Cas really wants a garden. Jack still likes exploring the universe, but he always comes home. He sits around the table sharing stories about planets made out of diamonds and stars that are nearly as old as the universe itself, but Dean’s favorite part about all this is just that fact that Jack is home and he’s well.
Cas walks out of the library without saying anything else. Dean waits until the footsteps recede down the hallway before turning to Sam. He says, “So, we’re going to ignore that, and look for a way to fix him, right?”
“You know what I mean,” Sam says, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Besides, it’s been a while since I’ve gone on a solo hunt.”
It's Saturday afternoon, and Dean is in the process of downing half a bottle of old whiskey when he hears the bunker door open, followed by some movement and an unmistakable trench coat. Cas hesitates at the top of the stairs and Dean swallows hard when their eyes meet, suddenly feeling very overwhelmed. Dean can just about make out the quiet exhale of breath as Cas walks down the stairs, taking slow, deliberate steps. He pauses at the edge of the war room table and fidgets with the sleeve of his jacket, looking down at the floor. When he looks up and meets Dean's eyes, his expression is carefully blank.
When Dean kisses Cas, he's dizzy from the gratitude and the world ahead of them and the way Cas laughs into his mouth.
Dean hums to signal that he’s awake. Cas shifts so that he’s turning so that their bodies press up together until he’s close enough that Dean can make out every speck in his blue eyes, even in the dark. Dean’s gaze dips to where Cas’s collarbone peeks out of his shirt. Dean trails back up, meeting Cas’s eyes.
He doesn't know what he wants to say to that. He knows that he should argue it, say that it's not like
He doesn’t know who moves first, or whether his brain is even processing anything when he moves, but the next thing he knows, he feels Cas’s body against his. Dean pulls Cas as close as he can, and buries his face in the hollow of Cas's shoulder. He registers the tears that are running down his face, but he doesn’t care. He takes in everything he can; the way Cas still smells like he did on Earth, the way the warmth radiates off his body, the way Cas runs his fingers through Dean’s hair.
“I’m sorry it took me so long,” Jack tells him, smiling slightly. “I tried doing this on my own, and it proved to be more difficult than I thought.”
"Hello, Dean,” Jack says hesitantly. He looks down at the body and frowns. “I have a lot to tell you, but I can’t do it here.”
Dean stares after him, his stomach twisting miserably. He hopes against hope that Billie can find something — if anyone can, it’s probably her, but he knows that they’re not anywhere closer to solving this than they were before. There’s still a chance that Jack could die and there’s next to no hope that they can get Cas out of his deal. Dean grabs the whiskey bottle on the table and drinks.
“There’s something else you should know. The Empty has no shape; if it shows itself to you, it can take on any shape,” Jack tells him. His voice is quiet and so utterly young when he says, “Be careful. I — I can’t lose you too.”
Cas doesn’t say anything for a moment; instead, he turns his laptop towards Dean, biting his lip and looking away. On the screen is a foreclosed house right outside the town center. From the looks of the listing, it’s three bedrooms with one bathroom and more than enough room to grow anything and everything they could ever want. Dean remembers Claire telling him to look at a house because
Dean finds Cas and Jack in the kitchen, a Connect Four board between them. Jack drops a yellow disc into the center column of the board. Cas huffs out a breath, staring at the board in complete concentration. Dean smirks, tip-toeing over to the table.
Cas immediately reaches a hand out to cover Jack’s eyes, but the damage is already done. Dean clears his throat. “Having fun, were we?”
Dean doesn’t know how true that is. This whole situation is insane, but that's about on course for their lives. At this point, Dean isn’t sure that anything would set them free except dying, and even that doesn’t seem to be a sure thing. He says, "One thing at a time, okay? We don't even know what the plan is."
It takes two more weeks until Sam finally loses patience and starts taking cases again out of a desperate need for a distraction; this time with Eileen by his side. It’s been thirty one days since Cas walked out of the bunker — not that Dean is keeping count. With Sam and Eileen gone most days, Dean finds himself roaming the quiet expanse of the bunker. It’s disconcerting how hollow the empty, echoing rooms are now that it’s just him.
With a wave of her fingers, Billie teleports Chuck out of the bunker. Dean feels a rush of relief through him. He looks over at Cas who smiles at him, the corners of his eyes drooping down in relief and something akin to happiness. It doesn’t last long though because Jack whimpers on the ground below them.
“That’s right,” Sam says. “He’s living in a Kansas City penthouse with Adam — don’t ask, but he might help us if we can convince him that this is the right thing to do.”
Dean knows that there’s no point arguing against it now so he just nods, resting a hand on Cas’s shoulder. “If there was any other option, you know I would —”
There’s a wave of movement around the room as Cas strolls in with one of Eileen’s bags. Dean helps Sam carry the boxes out to Eileen’s truck. Dean isn’t good with goodbyes — a lifetime of people leaving would do that to you, but it’s so much easier when he knows they’ll come back. He’ll see Sam and Eileen again for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and many other holidays and birthdays after.
“You should go,” Dean says, voice rough from disuse. He can’t even remember the last time he spoke to another human.
“Dean,” Sam starts. When Dean looks at him, Sam gives him a withering look. “You need to stop Jack from doing this.”
“I have to do it for Jack,” Cas explains, voice filled with newfound determination. “I can’t say that I have much of my grace left, and it’s not regenerating fast enough, but if it’s enough then I will happily give it up.”
Dean doesn’t know what to say to that, so he leans over to take Cas’s face in his hands, and kisses him softly. “I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
The thing laughs mirthlessly as it slides up to them. Dean forgets to breathe as he looks into Chuck’s face. It snarls, “Always buzzing around. It’s a wonder why I haven’t killed you yet.”
He pulls Jack into another hug. This time, Jack doesn’t hesitate and immediately wraps his arms around Dean. They’re getting Cas back, and for the first time in a month, Dean feels like he’s seeing the world clearly again.
Amara studies him carefully as she takes a bite of her food, her eyes never leaving his eyes. Swallowing hard, Dean says, “Yeah, we need your help to trap Chuck long enough for us to cast the spell and drain him of his powers.”
He freezes at the sound of the bunker door opening and shutting behind him. He looks up to see Cas and Jack standing on the balcony. Jack raises a hand in greeting before he marches down the stairs, quickly turning down the hallway towards his room, not saying a word to the room. There’s something about Jack’s expression that feels dark and worrisome, but Dean literally can’t bring himself to look away from Cas.
“Alright,” Cas says with a shrug. “Considering I have information on The Occultum, I suggest you wait before killing me.”
Between Claire and Jack, they settle on some Disney fare, and Dean knows he should probably protest just for old time’s sake, but really, who’s going to say no to Elsa from Frozen anyways? It doesn’t really matter though because Cas is carding his fingers through Dean’s hair, and it takes all of Dean’s strength to keep from falling asleep right there and then. About half way through, Dean gives up and drops his head to Cas’s lap, curling his legs into himself.
“And he agreed to it?” Cas confirms. Dean nods. Cas exhales and the tension leaves his face immediately. “Thank you, Dean.”
"He's in Montana," Cas says, finally breaking the silence. He frowns slightly. "He — Dean, he killed a doctor and ate his heart."
“So, you’re an aquarius,” Jack muses. Dean has no idea what that means. Jack eyes him considerately. “Does Cas have a birthday?”
True to her words, Rowena has Hell on lockdown; she called all the demons still on Earth back to Hell, and the world is safer for it. The remaining angels chose humanity in the end, falling to a world that they might be able to recover in; Billie runs Heaven using the power of human souls, so the more people live their lives positively and enter Heaven, the more Heaven shines bright. It’s a different kind of Heaven too, apparently, but also true to her word, Billie locked it all up, restoring a natural order to things. Amara is still around, getting massages in Vegas or playing keno in Atlantic City. Chuck — well, Chuck Shurley is alive somewhere in the world, but Dean doesn’t really care. The world has enough sad, pathetic men, so what’s one more?
“Hello, boys,” Rowena says, tilting her head. “I’ve caught up with dear Samuel and sweet Eileen, but how have you boys been?”
Dean shoots Sam a quick text to tell him that he's heading out with Cas and that he'll let him know if something important comes up. Sam's first reply is a thumbs up emoji, followed by a standard text insisting that they both stay safe and out of sight. He doesn't know how long they'll be away for, so he packs a bag and loads everything they could possibly need into the Impala. Cas stays quiet throughout it all, casually looking at something on his phone or otherwise occupying himself away from Dean.
“You mean that?” Jack asks, tipping his head to the side. When Dean nods silently, he bites his lower lip in concentration. After considering whatever he needs to consider, he smiles brightly. “I guess it can’t hurt. I’ve been wanting to get a Nintendo Switch.”
“Famous last words,” Cas warns, eyeing Jack warily. Jack just smiles a big, toothy smile at Cas, and Cas immediately softens, the corners of his mouth curving up into a smile. He admits, “This is kind of nice.”
Dean exchanges another look with Sam and Cas, shrugging. Hell if he knows what The Occultum is. That’s not his area of expertise, and he’s not about to start now. Cas matches his shrug, but Sam presses his lips together in concentration before saying, “It’s Latin for hidden. Where do we find it?”
Dean blinks twice, his brain finally catching up with his mouth. He splutters, “No, wait — no, that’s not what I meant to say.”
“Yes, Dean, we will,” Cas tells him, very pointedly, and Dean knows he has no chance of getting out of that one.
Cas lets out a soft, wet breath against his chest, pulling a loose string on Dean’s t-shirt. “It’s dark and disconcertingly quiet. Angels and demons sleep for an eternity, but it’s not a peaceful sleep. They’re haunted by the memories of their greatest regrets —” Cas hesitates; he blinks up at Dean. “I think that’s the part that worries me the most. The regrets I have — well, I suppose I can’t say they would kill me because I would be dead already, but it would feel like eternal torture.”
Somehow the bunker doesn’t feel empty anymore, even if it’s just him, Cas, and Jack now. The halls still echo, but it’s not eerily quiet anymore. Dean cooks a lot; Cas gardens sometimes, and Jack — well, Jack is a
“I’m not good at this,” Dean admits, waving between them. “You know, my old man got on my case whenever I brought up how I felt, so for a long time, I didn’t know how to talk about things, and I still don’t. When I put you in that box —” Dean freezes, and Jack’s face falls. It takes everything in Dean not to hurl from the way his gut turns at the fear that crosses over Jack’s face. Dean says, “When I put you in that box, I did it because I was scared, but — but, I should have been there, and I should have tried harder to understand, and for that, I’m sorry.”
"Right," Dean says absentmindedly. At least until Cas's statement hits him, and a sudden fear loops around in his gut. "You hunted a djinn here?"
Dean flushes and ducks his head. Yeah, he’ll probably never be used to how utterly earnest Cas is about, well, everything, but especially about him. He eyes Cas considerately. “You are okay, right?”
"Fix it," Sam says firmly when Dean doesn’t reply. "Fix it before you regret it because our lives are dangerous, and we've lost too many people, and you never know when it's going to fall apart."
Dean leans against the counter as Cas shuffles around the kitchen, with Jack in his arms. He pulls out a pot and drops the water and the oats in. Dean watches as Cas hums to himself, stirring the oats lightly.
Dean closes his eyes, trying to keep his memories from catching up to him again, but Cas places a light hand on his back, and Dean can feel the tension leave his body. He’s surprised how strong his voice sounds when he says, “It wasn’t all your fault. I knew he wasn't well, and I tried hard to ignore it too. Besides, we never would have been in that position if Chuck hadn’t played us.”
Dean never really considers exhaustion when it comes to cosmic beings. Cas doesn’t need to sleep, but he still gets tired. His grace is rapidly fading, and Dean found Cas hunched over in pain more than once recently. Jack does sleep, but it’s a lot less than most humans. Although coming back from the dead, especially from The Empty, probably takes a lot out of someone.
“Amara, what the hell are you doing?” Chuck shouts, but then Amara places a finger on her temple, and Chuck starts choking on air.
There is a lot of grief and anger between them that’s been building for so long. They’ve spent so many years saying empty apologies, and forgiving each other for things that shouldn’t be forgiven as easily as they are, and maybe it’s time that they take their time with it. Sam is right; their lives are in constant upheaval and if this, whatever it is, between him and Cas is worth the pain, Dean figures it’s also worth the effort and time. It was never going to be an easy fix, but at least Cas is willing to try.
Lebanon Central High School has sixteen teachers and approximately hundred and fifty students. It also has exactly one exhausted principal. Cynthia Kearny takes one look at them, and Dean immediately knows that she’s some mix between overworked and underpaid, and she’s in no mood to argue with two middle aged men about student enrollment. She glances over Jack’s paperwork, and the three of them wait in silence.
Cas looks like he’s in a silent debate with himself. He takes a deep breath, steadying himself before turning to face Dean. When their eyes meet, Dean feels like every bit of him is on fire with the level of intensity and regret in Cas’s eyes. He doesn’t say anything for a long time; time feels like it’s moving backward, and Dean feels the tension and anxiety building around him.
It’s actually 2017, and at some point, it was the worst day in Dean’s life. Nowadays, it’s just Jack’s birthday. Jack writes the date down and then looks up at Dean. He asks, “When’s your birthday?”
“I’m not giving up, Sam,” Dean says quickly because he’s not. Far from it. “I just don’t know what I’ll do with myself when the inevitable happens.”
“I was saying that there’s a serum that could reverse the effects of the spell,” Sam explains, flipping through one of the lore books. “He hibernates at night, so if we hurry, we can probably catch him before sunset.”
“What else am I supposed to do?” Jack asks, more than a little desperation lacing his voice. “After Chuck, I don’t know what my purpose is.”
There’s plenty of hugs to go around, and Dean doesn’t know when they turned into the kind of family that hugs each other casually, but he finds that he kind of likes it. Dean plasters on the most convincing smile he can manage — not very convincing, and Sam raises a brow calling him out on it, and cooks dinner for everybody. It gives him something to do, to distract himself from worrying about Cas, but Dean still feels restless and twitchy. He waits until Eileen and Jack head to bed before facing Sam and Cas.
Dean immediately stares at Cas, at a loss for words. Cas’s face contorts in anger and he pulls his arm away from Dean. He gives Jack one last look before he storms out of the room. Dean watches the muscles in Jack’s face clench before Jack walks out of the room, not looking at them. Dean clenches his fist at his sides and lets out an explosive sigh, the rage churning inside him.
Jack is truly an adorable toddler, which shouldn’t surprise Dean because Jack, normal Jack, is an adorable teenager, or pseudo teenager, or whatever the hell he is. It’s funny how Jack doesn’t actually look like either of his parents much. Actually the more Dean stares at the bright blue eyes and the quietly reflective way Jack looks at his surroundings, it hits him that while he might not be Cas’s actual son, the resemblance is uncanny. It’s not even that Jack looks like Jimmy Novak’s vessel, but there’s something so intrinsically Cas about him that Dean feels a wave of warmth.
“Yes, that’s quite common in the movies you like to watch when you think nobody is looking,” Cas says, tipping his head to the side and blinking the water out of his eyes. “Though, I will say that we’re both probably going to get sick if we stay here any longer.”
When Patricia and Cas walk into the kitchen, Jack immediately tucks the EMF meter away and smiles his trademark smile and says, “Patricia, what can you tell us about the ghost haunting the house?”
Dean tears up the archives, pulling books and film tapes out, to find anything he can on The Empty. He carries them carefully to his bedroom, spreading them out. He takes out the bottle of whiskey that he keeps hidden under his bed, taking a swig directly from it, and dives in.
pointed look. Dean swallows hard. Billie says, “That includes all of you. The next time you die will be the last time you die.”
. Christ, Dean really thought this would all be over once they got through Chuck’s last apocalypse, but it’s never over. He’ll be back, and he’ll want his revenge, and Dean knows that there’s going to be death and pain at the end of it all. But the worst part is that the world might be ending and yet, all Dean can think about is the way Cas turned his back away from Dean as he walked up those stairs.
“We’ll cross that bridge when we get there,” Dean tells him, placing a hand on Jack’s shoulder. Dean smiles encouragingly at Jack. “You didn’t give up on me when I had Michael trapped in my head, so give us a chance.”
“No way,” Dean says, pulling the game out of Jack’s hand to look at it closer. He pouts. “I wanted that for my island.”
“I probably can,” Jack admits, with a shrug. “I just respect you too much to invade your privacy like that. It would be something my grandfather would do, though.”
It’s pretty funny how Sam’s face tries to contort in anger at Dean not telling him, except it doesn’t actually do that because he’s so happy. He clears his throat. “I am definitely going to kill you guys for not telling me sooner, but wow, that’s amazing.”
“Or Caddyshack,” Claire pipes from the floor. “I already gave you my review, and you still made me watch it again.”
Cas stares at him with wide eyes. Dean blinks, surprising himself at how much he means that, but he does. Chuck’s death is everything; hell, it’s more than everything, but despite everything, he can’t bring himself to turn Jack into a bomb. It might be selfish, but Dean feels like he earned the right to be a bit selfish.
Dean nearly falls off his bed at a very familiar voice. As soon as he opens his eyes, he sees Jack, who stands upright for a moment before keeling over. Dean immediately rushes to the floor to help him up. “What the fuck, Jack?”
“Good to hear. We need to be ready and vigilant,” She turns, raising a brow at Dean. “And not be stupid.”
Cas nods, but his face tightens. “But Dean, I need you to know that I still need time to work through — work through
Cas averts his gaze away, clearly uneasy at the whole situation, but Dean doesn’t really care. He’ll do whatever it takes. When he looks at Billie, her face is soft. She shakes her head. “I’m sorry, I don’t. The Empty is different. It is vast, terrifying, and exists out of normal governance. I don’t even think God has power over it.”
Dean knows Jack isn’t sleeping well; hell, he’s not sleeping well, and he’s had way less to deal with than Jack has recently. The second night after Cas left, Dean finds himself up late, not quite knowing what to do. He debates calling Sam or Cas, but Sam
“For fucks sake, Dean,” Sam says, practically shouting now. Dean refuses to look up from the cutting board. Sam lowers his voice just a fraction when he says, “I can’t forget about how you tried to kill yourself the last time Cas died, so forgive me for being worried.” Dean darts his eyes up to meet Sam’s. His eyes are watery and his bottom lip quivers. “Please, just tell me what happened.”
Cas freezes, and everything suddenly goes still. Dean can see the regret crossing over Cas’s face, so painfully obvious that Dean wishes that he could take it back, but it’s too late. Cas’s eyes widen and he tilts his head away from Dean, and Dean feels like a complete idiot because of course Cas doesn’t feel the same way. As human as he is, Cas is still an Angel, capital A, of the fucking Lord, and Dean is as human as human can be. Cas has seen him do things that would have shamed the devil himself, so of course, Dean never had a chance. Dean opens his mouth to say something else — anything else, but closes it when there’s nothing else he can say.
When Cas looks at him, Dean can feel the warmth and appreciation radiating off him and Dean’s heart clinches. He just wishes — no, he can’t go there, not now. Instead, he tries smiling, even if he knows that Cas can see right through it. “He's a lot more like me than I realized.”
Rowena just nods and turns back to the book. She traces a finger over a diagram, flips to another page where she has scratched notes written down before turning back to the diagram. She exhales sharply. “The second ingredient is a bone from the first man.”
Rowena studies him for a long time before she smiles softly. “You really are a selfless being, aren’t you?”
Dean steps back from Cas to eye David Jenkins, who crosses his arms in front of him, and eyes them warily. Dean points a finger at him. “Just for that, Dave, you’re not getting an invitation.”
Dean feels his stomach twist and something ugly coil in his core. He doesn’t know why he expects anything else. He’s lost Cas enough times to know that. He watches the little boy with the kite run around with Miracle. Dean tilts his head towards them. “Your son?”
Sam just hums, the corners of his mouth quirking up into a smile. He tries for subtlety, but that lasts about five seconds before he’s fully grinning. “You should see yourself from the outside, man.”
Jack’s face closes off, averting his gaze to the cold eggs on the kitchen island. “Not really.” He picks up his plate and walks up the stairs, and Dean can hear the bedroom door shutting in the distance.
Jack eyes Dean carefully, and just for the briefest moment, a flash of guilt spreads across his face. It dissipates so quickly that if Dean hadn't known better, he would have missed it.
Dean huffs out a low laugh. He softens when he looks at Jack who is all fiery determination. He says, “I know you want to help and you think that this is the only way, but running to your death isn’t exactly the best idea out there.”
The room feels like it’s spinning underneath him, but when Cas runs a hand through his hair, Dean starts to steady himself. He lifts his head away from Cas’s chest to look up at him. Cas’s face immediately softens, and he reaches a hand out to cup Dean’s face; Dean leans into the touch and feels the warmth radiate off Cas. He traces his thumb along the band of Cas’s pajama bottoms, before dipping under the fabric. Cas’s breath hitches above him.
“Better,” Cas confirms, trying to blink the sleep out of his eyes. “It seems that human beings need way more rest than your habits have led me to believe.”
"He's here," Cas whispers, eyeing the church with some apprehension. "I'm surprised Chuck hasn't found him with the amount of energy he's radiating."
“You’ve been watching us,” Dean asks, but it comes out more as a statement. Jack just shrugs in response. “And, clearly that didn’t work because Cas is still stuck there.”
“I already downloaded the app,” Claire tells them, looking up from her phone. “It’s like uber for hunters.”
Cas ignores him and barrels on, “I was just so desperate to save him. I had such faith that he would be good for the world — that he would be good for us, but when everything went wrong and God took him from us, I didn’t know what to do.”
"Hey," Sam says when he finally breaks the silence; he drops his tablet down onto the table and furrows his brows. Dean traces the rim of his glass and turns away from his brother. Calmly, Sam says, "Have you talked to Cas recently?"
Feeding Jack ends up being a lot easier than they thought it would be. It’s probably more due to the promised ice cream than anything else, but Jack eats his dinner quietly, with Cas feeding him. Dean tries to school down the
Dean has to admit that it's not the faultiest logic he's heard, and it's probably worth a shot. "I still don't like it. Hell, we don't even know who's in charge down there."
Dean flinches. God, he’s such an ass. Reigning his emotions in as much as he can, Dean tries again. "I know that, but — but when Chuck told us that nothing about our lives is real, I reacted badly. I just — I didn't think my actions mattered because nothing mattered anymore. I was just so lost, Cas.”
Dean sighs and rubs a hand over his face in frustration. “Fine, but keep looking just in case. We’re coming back tomorrow morning.”
“Jack, stop,” Dean says, tilting his head so that he’s meeting Jack’s gaze again. “Cas made his choice to save you because he loves you. He didn’t regret it for a moment, and I’m sure that if he was here, he’d tell you that he would make that choice all over again. We’ve all made deals that bit us in the ass because we couldn’t see the people we love die. There’s nothing to forgive, okay?”
“Dangerous,” Dean finishes. He can’t think about that right now. Right now, all that’s important is making sure that Jack doesn’t lose it. While Sam’s situation was different, Dean still remembers how bad it got for Sam after his soul was returned. The last thing anyone needs is a nephilim spiraling. Dean sighs. “One thing at a time, Cas. We got his soul back. That’s a start.”
Cas exhales sharply, tilting his head towards the ceiling. His voice is barely above a whisper when he says, "I think I found Jack."
“I know,” she replies nonchalantly, even if it’s obvious to both of them that it’s a lie. She opens her laptop. “I thought you might want to watch Scooby-Doo.”
Dean swallows a lump in his throat, his body feeling uncharacteristically stiff. He crosses his arms across his chest and keeps his voice from trembling when he says, “He’s not always fine. Actually, if my memory serves me right, he’s
“We’ve been talking about marriage a lot lately. Maybe I should get married too,” Jack muses, not looking up from where he’s finishing up a math problem.
"Not this time," Dean says quietly, as he walks out of the kitchen. He’s pretty sure Sam calls after him again, but Dean tunes it out.
Dean huffs out a laugh before he leans in, reaching up to tilt Cas’s chin closer and kisses him. Cas sighs into it, kisses him back, slow and easy, their bodies tilting together with a sense of familiarity, Cas’s arms dangling loosely around his shoulder, as Dean splays his hand over Cas’s hipbone. Dean reaches his other hand up to cup Cas’s head, and runs a thumb along Cas’s jawline, feeling the early stages of stubble under his fingers, and gently turns Cas to deepen the kiss. Dean can feel the curve of Cas’s grin when he kisses the corners of his mouth. Ever the impatient one, Cas shifts to pull Dean back on to the bed with him. Dean pulls away to raise a brow, smirking slightly.
“We should get him fed,” Dean eventually manages when Jack begins to get fussy in his lap. Cas tilts his head to the side and nods.
“Next time, you ask for help,” Dean points out from his spot on the floor. Jack just nods, expression blank. Once Dean finishes up, he asks, “So, now what?”
Dean hates that he chose that moment to take a bite of his cookie because he chokes. “We — what?” Jack just furrows his brows in confusion. Dean swallows hard and clears his throat. He debates whether it’s worth explaining why they’re fighting to Jack. Dean sighs. “I said some things to Cas that I didn’t really mean, and neither of us is in a good enough place to talk it out yet.”
Dean's eyes flutter shut and he sighs against Cas's mouth. It’s not gentle, but nothing about them has ever been gentle. It’s filled with the desperation born out of years spent yearning for something more, but never being brave enough to take that chance.
Cas stays quiet as Dean tugs them back towards the bunker, through the trees and weeds. It’s not until they’re almost home that Cas pulls Dean’s hand, stopping them, before he says, “Do you want to talk about it?”
Dean barely gets to the door before he hears her; he turns his head and spots Amara as he stands under a street lamp across the street, with a disbelieving look on her face. Her eyes are wide, and they turn wary as Dean makes his way across the street.
The one downside to living in an underground bunker is that Dean has to trade early morning sunlight trickling into the bedroom for infinite safety in the form of ancient magical warding. Logically, Dean knows that the reason why the bunker doesn’t have windows is that it’s dangerous for outsiders to catch what goes on inside, but he still hates it.
“Right.” Dean looks away, takes a step back from Cas, his breath shaking out of him. “Right, of course.” Dean shakes his head, feels his chest constrict. He barks out a strained laugh. “Christ, I’m sorry. I never should have said anything. Just — just forget it, okay?”
Dean turns around and looks at Sam, knowing full well that whatever his face is doing right now, it’s comical. There’s a small smile on Sam’s face as he tilts his chin towards Cas, who walks down the stairs. “How’d it go?”
Dean bows his head. It was a long shot, he knew, but he was just hoping for something, anything. He says, “So, it’s pretty much hopeless.”
“Jack, I don’t think High School Musical is —” Dean starts, but Cas shoots him a reproachful look. Dean quickly amends, “I think that’s a great idea, Jack.”
Dean looks at Cas and sees the struggle on his face. Dean knows it’s not an easy choice. Cas has been an angel for millennia, fighting countless battles, and asking him to give all that up because — because Dean wants him to? Because they can be together and be happy and live a normal life? It seems worth it in Dean’s mind, but he knows it’s not his choice.
It’s an uncomfortable car ride back to the bunker, with nobody really talking. Dean feels restless; there’s an itch for a drink that doesn’t go away. When they pass under a light, he sees Jack lean against the back window.
Jack nods once at Sam before meeting Dean’s gaze. Dean immediately drops his eyes; the guilt, shame, and pain hurtles through him. He lifts his head and tilts it towards Sam. He says, “Give us a minute.”
— better than he’s looked in a while. There’s an effortless, carefree quality to Cas now; his blue eyes are dark and luminous, more celestial than when he was an angel, and Dean wants nothing more than to lean over and kiss him.
“How are you feeling?” Dean asks, crossing the room so that he’s leaning next to Cas, with his back to the counter. It might just be the soft glow of the kitchen light and the haze of an early morning, but Cas looks much better. The bags under his eyes are clearing, and he doesn’t look as bone-tired as he did.
“You know, I really have no use for humans,” The Shadow continues, and Dean tries to tune it out in order to focus on Jack. “I could kill you, and make the angel watch. That would be —”
Dean nearly put The Rain Song on the mixtape. It was his mother’s favorite song, but it was a song that his father would always skip over whenever he would play the old Houses of the Holy cassette tape. When he made the tape for Cas, he didn’t know what he was trying to say. There’s the Earth-trampling guitars of Immigrant Song leading into the retelling of
“Yes,” Jack says, even if he sounds a little unsure. Dean lets Eileen help him up, as Sam carries Cas into the infirmary. Jack follows behind them. To Dean, he says, “You should rest. Chuck didn’t exactly leave me with a manual, so it might take some time.”
It takes Sam two weeks to confront Dean which, in his defense, is two weeks longer than Dean expects.
“I have to do this, Cas,” Jack says, tilting his chin up as he looks at Cas with steely determination. “Please don’t try and stop me.”
Billie rolls her eyes. “Yes, Castiel, okay. I will reach out to my contacts and figure out an alternate path, but I do have to warn you that whatever it is could be dangerous. With the original plan, Jack’s life is the only life that would be at risk, but there’s every chance that we could be messing with some intense magic. You have to be prepared.”
“As much as I hate it, you have the freedom to make your own choices,” Dean says softly, even if that’s technically not true. He can’t keep his voice from trembling when he says, “But, we can’t lose you again. I know I can’t force you to back down, but I’m begging you to consider what it would do to us —
“Actually, I don’t think our marriage holds up in any legality considering I don’t exist and Dean is legally dead in all fifty states,” Cas says, cutting Sam off.
This gets a low chuckle out of Cas. He doesn’t say anything though; instead, he stares out ahead at the dark night, the clouds obscuring the stars above them. Cas’s voice is quiet, barely above the noise of the rain, when he says, “When the solar system was first formed, we used to watch the rainfalls of diamonds on Jupiter and the sulfuric acid on Venus, but it was the life sustaining water on Earth that really amazed me. The first rainfall on Earth was one of my most treasured memories.”
Amara bites her bottom lip and Dean can see the fury rising behind her eyes, but it dissipates and it’s replaced by something sadder. She twists her mouth into a cynical smile before she huffs out a low laugh. When she looks at Dean with wide eyes, he feels a twinge of sympathy. Quietly, Amara says, “What do you need me to do?”
“I love you,” Dean says again, enjoying the way the words sound on his tongue. Cas smiles at him softly. Dean points between them. “If we do this, it’s for real. I can’t lose you again. So, please stay forever, or as long as our human lives let us, because this is it for me, Cas.”
Dean swallows dryly. He picks up his own, now cold, coffee and pointedly drains it. When Eileen snickers, Dean groans, “It wasn’t like that.”
"Can we talk about this?" Dean finally asks. Cas drags his eyes away from the blade just to give him a blank look, his lips pressed together in a thin line. Dean slumps his shoulders and looks down and away from Cas. "Look, I'm really sorry for what I said, and you know I didn't mean it."
“I know I feel bad about killing her, and I know it’s my fault,” Jack explains slowly, his face scrunching up in concentration, like he’s picking every word carefully. Dean curls his fingers around a cookie. Jack lets out a sigh, dropping his face into his hands. “And I know I miss her a lot because she was kind, beautiful, and so strong. I know you don’t forgive me, and I feel bad about that.” There’s a slight tremble in Jack’s voice now.  “But, Dean, I don’t
Dean flushes, ignoring the flutter in his chest. He clears his throat. “Yeah, well, I had to raise Sammy.”
Cas tilts his head and narrows his eyes in confusion before he turns to Sam. He says, “If you don’t mind, Sam.”
He kicks his bedroom door shut behind him, collapsing on the floor, with his back to the door. He’s tired. He’s so fucking
Rowena scoffs. “Of course not. We had to track it down and it was very dangerous.” Dean shoots her an apologetic look but she waves it off. “Luckily, the Queen of Hell and Death together is — well, it’s a deadly combination.”
“I am,” Cas agrees, but he’s smiling softly at Jack. Cas tilts his head towards Jack. “Jack, on the other hand, could be a world champion.”
“It’s not a full retirement though,” Dean admits. “I’ll still work the phones and the bunker is still open to you, Eileen, and any other hunters that might stop by. Hell, if Jack gets restless enough, I might take him out to take out a vamp nest here and there.”
“Well, he isn’t exactly human,” Cas says, pinching the bridge of his nose. “The sugar from the ice cream probably didn’t help.”
Dean carefully pulls out his phone and opens up a diagram. “I need you to find him and teleport him to the bunker at exactly a quarter past five, two days from now. You need to bind him as long as you can so that Sam can recite the spell, and Rowena can do what she does. Jack will snap his fingers, and then we’ll see what happens. Ideally, all of Chuck’s powers will transfer to Jack, leaving Chuck alive but mortal.” He fixes a firm look in Amara’s direction. “Will you do that for us?”
Jack lets out a low whine and buries his face into Cas’s chest. Dean chuckles, low and soft, and settles down on the bed. He asks, “Would it help if we stay here with you?”
Cas stares at him, tilting his head to the side. He places a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “We’ve all tried to kill each other at some point.”
Dean throws his head back, staring at the ceiling, letting out a sigh of relief. He looks back down at Jack, trying to keep his voice from trembling but failing miserably. “I’m gonna kill your ass, too.”
Dean sighs. Of course, this isn’t going to be easy. Cas seems to feel the same way because he frowns before he says, “I contacted her and it turns out that she passed it onto the demon, Ruby.”
He looks away from where Jack is scrolling through local cases to nudge Claire. When she looks at him, Dean says, “So, that’s school officially benched?”
He holds his arms out, and they have no choice, but to let him hug them. It’s secretly very, very nice. When they pull away, Dean says, “Well, lets see the rings then.”
“It’s an artifact,” Cas explains when they’re all sitting around the war room table. “It’s divine in its origin, passing through several hands until it ended up with the faith healer, Anael.”
Cas seems to follow his train of thought because he nods, a knowing expression flickers over his face. "Yes, I figure that she needs closure as well, and I want to be there for her.” He pauses, smiling slightly, in the sad way that he does sometimes. “She doesn't reach out to me that often, so I don't want to disappoint her."
Cas shrugs. "Hunted is probably an exaggerated term, but I took care of it without much harm to myself. I was just in the area, and a woman's son was missing and well —" Cas hesitates, something passing over his face that Dean couldn't place until now, but suddenly the pieces fall into place. Dean should have known.
per se, but I suppose — well, I suppose I would rule as Death. The natural order is what it is now, and when people die, they will be weighed against the abacus, and those souls that belong in Heaven will go to Heaven.” She gives Dean a
“I don’t think I’m good at this,” Cas admits, still staring at the soup with a mix of frustration and anger. He tilts his head to look at Dean. “I did quite enjoy eating when I was human, but cooking - well, I would prefer not to do it.”
The house has a leaky roof, a bathroom that doesn’t function in any capacity, and apparently a ghost. Of the three, the leaky roof is what bothers Cas the most. He questions Patricia, the real estate agent listing the house, over and and over about mold that could grow in the woodwork and how much the water damage would cost, and
Cas stares at him for a moment before he says, “It’s not your job to save me, Dean. When I made the deal with The Empty, I had the intention of going then and there, but it wants me to be tortured under the weight of my unhappiness. I truly appreciate you trying, but I won’t think any less of you if you can’t.”
Dean shifts when he feels Cas turning in his arms. When they’re face to face, Cas blinks up at him. “What about you, then?”
because Sam runs a circle between Dean’s shoulders and tells him that he knows it’s not fair. This goes against everything Dean knows; he knows he shouldn’t cry in front of Sam, he’s not allowed to cry in front of Sam, not really anyways, and definitely not like this. He’s stronger than this, or he should be, but — but, he’s not. He’s just a man and he just wants some goddamn peace and a
“I don’t understand why we’re here,” Cas tells him as he holds Jack down so that Dean can strap him into the shopping cart, narrowly escaping Jack’s kicking feet. Cas eyes him warily. “He’s not going to stay a toddler forever, you know.”
"There's something else I want to tell you, Dean," Cas says, suddenly, breaking the stillness in the room. His voice is calm and level, but Dean can see the effort it's taking Cas to keep it there. He doesn’t look at Dean, and instead flips from one side of the newspaper to the other. "I know you want to stay here and help, but I would really prefer not to be around you right now."
“So, you mean to tell me that you weren’t expecting a teenager in the place of a newborn?” Dean laughs.
“The Empty,” Jack says flatly from around his burrito. Dean nearly chokes on his own. Jack looks up at him, frowning slightly. “I wanted to come back earlier, but I didn’t know if I could.”
“Dean,” Dean says, shaking her hand. He’s not really used to making conversation with strangers anymore; hell, he’s not really used to making conversations with anyone anymore. “Just moved into town?”
There’s badly made pancakes that are totally Jack’s doing. He pulls a cup off the shelf and pours himself coffee. He eyes the papers in front of Cas carefully. “What do you have there?”
Jack is easily the smallest toddler that Dean has ever seen, which isn’t a heavily researched opinion, but he’s smaller than Sam, which is the metric that Dean uses to measure. He falls asleep quickly on the ride back to the bunker, and when Dean lifts him from the car seat, he nods his head against Dean’s shoulder. Dean feels a rush of affection when Jack rubs his eyes with tiny fists before he drops his head back to Dean’s shoulder. Dean leans down and places a light kiss to the top of Jack’s head.
“Your announcement —”Sam starts, eyebrows drawing together in confusion. He looks between Dean and Cas before something dawns on him. Before Dean can stop him, Sam gushes, “Shit, wait — are you two engaged? I didn’t mean — oh my god, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to step on your toes.”
Cas hums in quiet acknowledgment; it’s the obvious, Dean knows that, but he also knows that sometimes you need to be reminded of the obvious. Chuck isn’t writing their lives anymore, The Empty can’t get you, the world is as safe as it’ll ever be — Dean knows that, Cas knows that, but sometimes they just need a reminder.
“It wasn’t our kind of case, but we managed,” Cas says with a wave. Dean is about to ask how Jack handled the case without using his powers when he spots Cas trying to read his book upside down. Dean tilts it so that Cas can read it easier. Cas frowns, eyeing Dean. “Any luck?”
Rowena pinches the bridge of her nose. “I suppose you’re right and it could be a metaphor, and a replacement could do, but —”
Billie studies them both closely; she places her scythe down and crosses her arms across her chest. Her voice is calm when she says, “You want to kill
Dean hears Cas exhale sharply next to him before he wordlessly crosses the room towards Jack. He kicks the body with his foot, and when it turns over, he hunches over to examine the body, tracing the hole where the heart is supposed to be with his finger. Dean takes several steps closer and picks up a discarded angel blade, which clearly belongs to whoever Jack killed. Cas pokes at the body once more before standing and wiping his hands on his trench coat. He hesitates a moment before he pulls Jack into a tight hug. Dean stands back as Jack drops his head to Cas's shoulder, and Cas pulls him in even closer. When they break apart, Dean notices that Cas's eyes are misty. He cups Jack’s face with one hand, his face trembling with unspoken emotions.
“Oh for fucks sake,” Dean groans, as soon as Sam’s words register, and well, that’s not exactly what he means to say because Sam stares at him in confusion. Hell, everyone stares at him in confusion. Dean quickly amends, “No — I’m really happy for you, dude. Like, so happy. Eileen is awesome — the best, but for fucks sake, how did you manage to upstage our announcement?”
“Eileen and I can head down to Hell to figure out if Rowena has any information,” Sam offers, picking up his laptop and leaving the room.
“Chuck spent millennia doing nothing,” Dean says with a laugh. “I think you’ll be fine if you take some time off to be a kid. If there’s really some God thing that needs your attention, you can always pop out, take care of it, and come back.”
“Thank you, Jack,” Dean chokes out. Cas had said that despite everything, Jack still cares about his love, and Dean doesn’t know what he did to deserve that. Hell, he doesn’t deserve it, but Jack is willing to offer it anyway. Dean tries smiling. “We will get your soul back. I promise you that.”
Dean half expects Cas to be at the bunker when they get back; that he could walk through the empty halls and hear Cas’s low voice calling his name out once again. The world is right again; their friends are back, the birds are chirping, and Miracle is a living, breathing dog. With a flick of a finger, Jack was able to put everything back in its right place, like nothing was ever amiss, except —
at Sam and Sam just shakes his head. “I’m just happy for you, man.” Sam pauses, grinning again. “You’ve gone soft.”
“You don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to, but it might help you work through it if you do,” Dean offers again.
“Don’t worry, I already obtained all the math taught in the American school system,” Jack explains, waving to a teacher that passes by. “I couldn’t absorb history or literature because my powers aren’t as strong as they were.”
"Hey, kid," Dean says, completely unable to keep his voice from wavering. He blinks rapidly, trying not to tear up. "It's been a while.”
"Hey," Dean says, voice still rough from sleep. Cas immediately flinches before turning around to face him; he leans against the counter, wrapping his hands tightly around his coffee mug. Dean already knows that he's facing an uphill battle when he sees Cas’s face and it’s as blank as ever, clearly not in the mood to see Dean, let alone talk to him. Cas slants his head to the side but doesn't say anything.
Cas hums. “Well, it is a learning curve, but I think I’m getting used to it. I never thought I would be a father.”
Sam and Eileen are already back by the time Dean makes it back to the bunker. He feels a spark of anticipation when he sees Sam leaning over a sigil painted on the floor; he lights a candle and starts mixing various ingredients, and when he spots Dean, he nods in his direction. Dean notices a vial of Michael’s blood next to the blue-white fog of Cas’s grace on the table.
Cas looks towards the door before turning back to Dean. “Dean, as happy as I am that he’s gotten his soul back, Billie’s plan seems —”
Cas is mostly determined to not cry, but Dean doesn’t even try. He cries when he first sees Cas on his wedding day; he cries as he makes his vows. When Cas turns to Dean with red-rimmed eyes in pure, unadulterated happiness, it hits Dean right then and there that they’re
“I’m here if you want to talk about whatever you’re being strange about,” Cas says, rolling his eyes, but sounding genuine nonetheless. Dean just nods, even if he has no intention of not being weird about this. Cas doesn’t seem to want an answer though because he just continues, “Sam sent over all the paperwork we need to get Jack into school, and it’s still early enough in the year that we might be able to get him enrolled.”
than hell. At least, hell exists as something, and whatever torture a soul goes through can be substantiated. This — this is torture in a new form.
"I need to run it by Cas, but Jack and I could come back to the bunker to help," Dean offers. He feels restless and he just needs to punch something.
“We’re getting it,” Dean immediately tells Cas because there’s no way they’re walking out of the store without it.
“A while,” Cas replies, considerately. He pulls his trench coat tightly around himself, and shivers, which immediately sends another shot of panic through Dean. He knows Sam catches it as well because he raises a brow at Cas, who just shrugs. “It started a few months ago. The battle with the souls from Hell took a lot out of me, but I was hoping that it was only temporary.”
"Okay," Cas echoes him. His eyes don’t look furious anymore; instead, when Dean catches his eyes, he can see Cas’s hurt. His mouth is drawn in a thin line as he turns away to walk up the stairs.
Cas drops his head back to the pillow, and Dean quickly moves the blanket so that he’s wrapping Cas in it. He places a hand on Cas’s shoulder again, in what he hopes is comforting, before standing up. “Just get some rest.”
he thinks because that’s an incredible feeling, that all the bullshit that he’s put Cas through over the years hasn't scared him away. Cas saw all the anger and rage and decided that he still loves Dean.
This gets Cas’s attention. He looks up from the form he’s filling to give Dean a look. Dean shrugs. “The kid discovered astrology.”
“You’ll throw your neck out,” Dean grumbles. When he hears someone clear their throat, he looks up to see Claire standing over them with her arms crossed across her chest.
Rowena is silent for a very long time, as she flips between two pages in the book. A look of worry spreads across her face, but she nods. “You’re correct, but darling, this is your
"You don't think I was lost too?" Cas asks, with a crack in his voice, betraying his anguish. He fingers his blade carefully and twists it in his hands; his anger is only betrayed by the way his hand trembles around the blade. "Jack was
Sam immediately looks up from his laptop, shooting a worrying glance in Cas’s direction. Cas coughs, which sends a sudden stab of anxiety through Dean. Cas clears his throat, tilting his head and squinting. “I think my head hurts.” He hesitates, narrowing his eyes in concentration. “And my knees — and, well, everything actually.”
“I’m sure you can,” Dean agrees; it’s true as well because he has no intention of beating Jack, just like Cas and Sam don’t either. He shoves Cas’s shoulder lightly so that Cas gets up, allowing Dean to swap places with him. He takes the red chips and starts playing.
Dean doesn’t know what possesses him to take a step closer to Cas, dropping his coffee mug on the counter. He feels time still around him as he moves towards Cas, who blinks up at him, his eyes wide and startled. He moves a hand around Cas’s neck, and he can see Cas’s eyes flicker between his eyes and his lips.
“Rowena is trying to come up with a spell,” Sam explains over the phone. “If it works, we’ll be able to bind him and hopefully convince him to give us the serum to turn Jack back. If we can’t convince him nicely - well, you know.”
to work, but they both feel gross about that idea. Besides, Dean knows that Cas has been itching to do something more. He reaches over and takes Cas’s hand in his, lacing their fingers together. He squeezes lightly and says, “You’ll be great.”
Dean wonders what kind of sick joke the universe is playing on him that he had to go fall in love with a man that runs to his death every chance he gets.
“Yes,” Jack says, without missing a beat. Dean looks at Cas and sees Cas struggling to keep a straight face as Patricia considers Jack. Without waiting for an answer, Jack continues, “You said that the last owners left because of the ghost, and before that, there was a string of strange deaths?” Patricia opens her mouth to say something, but closes it because Jack keeps going. “Now, I know there’s no sulfur smell, but are there cold spots in the house?”
Jack steps back from them, wiping his tears. His mouth is drawn into a thin line. He opens his mouth, but closes it again when he can’t control the rush of emotions getting the better of him. Without saying anything else, he walks towards the entrance of the church. Sam follows him out, and Dean can make out Sam trying to talk to Jack.
Cas opens his mouth to say something, but immediately closes it when someone clears their throat. Dean throws his head back to look at the ceiling, letting out a quiet, but exasperated, sigh. Cas wordlessly steps back, and Dean looks over his shoulder to where Eileen is standing by the door. She smirks at them, running a hand through her sleep-tousled hair.
Eileen cautiously pokes her head through the door; the light from the hallway is too bright and it instantly hurts Dean’s eyes, but then Eileen turns the lights in his room on, and Dean feels his head split from the sensory change. She steps fully into the room, laptop in hand.
Dean turns towards his door to find Sam standing in the hallway, his eyes darting between Dean, the whiskey bottle, and the books. Dean struggles to control the sickening wave of fear rising through him.
The search for Michael is a dead end. The search for Lilith is somehow even harder. They might as well forget about Chuck considering he’s in any one of the thousands of worlds he’s created, and now, destroying. The hunts dry up as well; it’s almost as if the monsters realized that something big is about to go down, and have decided to make themselves scarce. Sam tries to find them cases every few days; there’s a cursed television, a random wood nymph in the bunker that they somehow missed, a couple of vengeful spirits, but mostly it’s quiet. Dean finds that he doesn’t really mind that much. He likes doing regular housework around the bunker, and he likes sleeping in. Everything is such a shit show outside that it kind of feels nice when he can stay at home and relax. So, naturally, just when he’s feeling some level of normalcy, Billie makes her presence known.
Jack squats down to the floor, dropping the ingredients into the cauldron. He looks between Sam and Dean as he explains, “Basically, we’re opening a rift into The Empty. When Nick did the ritual, he was trying to draw Lucifer to him, and he would act as the vessel for Lucifer. However, in our case, Dean is going to enter The Empty, and pull Cas out, and I’ll be able to recreate Cas’s vessel, as well as close the rift. With any luck, I might be able to put it back to sleep.”
“I’m going to die,” Jack tells them quietly. There’s a slight tremble to his voice when he continues, “The last quest for Billie’s plan will turn me into a bomb, and when the time comes, it will take Chuck out — and, it will kill me as well.”
Jack pouts, but he pulls out his pencil and starts working on it immediately. Dean is about to turn back to the parent or guardian forms when he hears the bunker door open and close. Cas strolls into the room, dressed in  a pair of jeans and one of Dean’s old band t-shirts, and grins at them.
“Christ,” Dean snorts. Cas instinctively shoots him a reproachful look, and Dean raises a hand in apology. He shakes his head and makes his way around the passenger side. “You and Sam should have just staged an intervention.”
“I should hope so, considering we’re going to be spending the rest of our lives together,” Cas says, completely seriously, turning back to the forms. Dean immediately has to remind himself to breathe.
"I'm not coming back," Cas says, crossing his arms across his chest. Dean opens his mouth to argue, but Cas raises a hand. "I made up my mind, Dean."
Dean doesn’t know why it matters because they’ll probably pay for all of the repairs they can’t handle themselves with Charlie’s magic credit card, but Cas seems to be enjoying tormenting the poor real estate agent, so Dean leaves him to it.
Dean swaps his flannel out for his Fed suit as soon they get to the lake town Cas is staying in. The cynical side of Dean wonders if Cas intentionally found the furthest, most remote place he could find just to get away from him.
Rowena flips through the book again and says, “Well, it is powerful magic so the caster will take great physical strain. There’s also the fact that we would need assistance to bring Chuck to the bunker, and the only being capable of doing that is —” Rowena frowns, looking at Dean.
Jack silently looks at his hand, twisting his fingers together. Something coils in Dean’s gut at the sight — Jack is so similar to him sometimes that it’s painful. When Jack looks up, he can’t hide the sadness in his eyes. “Dean, you know that this is the right thing to do. You know that Chuck has to die.”
“No,” Dean says, automatically, because he can’t give up. He’s already lost Cas enough times, and he’s not losing Cas again. Especially not now. “There has to be a spell somewhere that can help an angel regenerate his grace quicker.”
“We’re just waiting on Rowena,” Sam says, not looking up from where he’s mixing some myrrh and cassia. There’s less than an hour before Amara is scheduled to bring Chuck to the bunker. Dean taps his fingers on the table, feeling the anxiety rise. Sam finally stands up and looks over his handiwork. He turns to Dean. “Once she gets back from Hell, I’ll recite the incantation and Rowena will use her magic. Jack would have about a minute to snap his fingers.”
Sam and Jack are barely down the hallway before Cas walks towards him, eyebrows lifting in quiet satisfaction as turns on him. Dean opens his mouth to say something, but Cas’s hands make their way around the back of his neck, sliding into his hair and pulling him down to connect their lips. Cas’s mouth is warm and sure as it moves against his own, and Dean reaches a hand up and cups his head, his thumbs resting along Cas’s jawline, gently turning Cas’s head to deepen the kiss. He opens his mouth a little, and Dean feels the curve of Cas’s grin when he makes an embarrassingly soft noise at the brush of tongue.
Dean feels like the ground is going to cave in under him at any moment; he can’t believe that this is real, and not something Chuck dropped on their plate to break their will some more. All the words he wants to say are stuck in his throat, and he feels himself choking on them. When he meets Cas’s eyes, there’s silent despair there, an unspoken plea for Dean to say something, to talk Jack out of this. Dean lets out a breath. “Jack —”
Dean watches Cas stare at Jack like that’s the most interesting fact he’s ever heard, and Jack for his part blinks back at Cas, babbling something nonsensical. Cas laughs, low and utterly happy, and instantly Dean feels a pull in his heart.
Cas and Dean exchange a look. The corners of Cas’s mouth quirk up into a small smile as he says, “As you wish.” He raises a hand and waves behind him as he treads out of the kitchen.
Dean looks over Cas’s shoulder at where Jack’s sleeping form lay. Dean shakes his head. “You already apologized, Cas.”
“Cas, what are we doing here?” Dean asks, his voice cracking slightly. “I’m not the only one that’s thinking —” Dean hesitates, feels his face warm. “I’m not the only one that’s feeling this, right?”
Dean raises two fingers in salute. Sam sighs again, and Dean hears the door shut a moment later with footsteps receding down the hallway.
With less than ten minutes left, Rowena walks down the stairs of the bunker, smiling coyly at them all.
Rowena raises a brow at him. “Forgive me for having responsibilities, Dean. You don’t want Hell to fall into chaos, do you?” Without waiting for a response, she walks over to the sigil on the ground. She eyes them for a moment before smiling brightly. “Oh, my dearest Samuel, we’ll make a witch out of you, yet.”
Jack bites his lip, still looking at his hands. Slowly, he says, “It’s not a bad thing, but —” He hesitates, looking over at Billie who is leaning against the door frame. Jack squints at her. “Billie, do you think this power can be passed on?’
“Uh, guys. As proud as I am that my store is the chosen venue of the town weirdos’ engagement, don’t y’all want some privacy?”
“I do, but you should say it anyways,” Dean says, preening. He likes validation, sue him. “Or, you could show me how proud you are.”
“No, I don’t,” Cas says immediately. He reaches down into his side table drawer to pull out a thin leather strip. Dean watches as Cas loops the strip through the vial, turning it into a necklace. He blinks up at Dean again. “I was just thinking about what I should do with it.”
“Contradictory emotions are, like, humanity 101,” Dean says with a wave. “Some days are better than others, but getting through each day feels like a victory in and of itself, and if you live long enough, the good days would eventually outweigh the bad ones.”
When Dean lifts his head to look at Cas, he can tell that Cas is still angry, but there’s something else behind the blues of his eyes. Dean isn't delusional enough to think that everything is water under the bridge just because they're in the same room again, but they both want to save Jack, and that might be enough for now.
, for canned stuff, and it just needs some salt and black pepper. Dean sprinkles it in, stirring it lightly. He mixes some rice into the tomato soup so that Jack can get some carbs in. It’s infinitely better than the things he fed Sam when Sam was Jack’s age; hell, it’s probably healthier than the things he eats these days.
Dean stirs awake, taking in his surroundings; the lights are too bright, the smells are too clinical, and Cas — Cas is standing over him, eyebrows drawn together in worry. Dean groans and sits up. He’s on the floor in the bunker’s library. He carefully eyes the empty whiskey glass next to him. He’s been meaning to stop, and he’s
“What makes you say that?” Dean asks, but Sam just rolls his eyes. Right, brothers. Can’t really lie to them even if Dean spent a lifetime doing just that. Dean tries to keep his voice level when he says, “He called me his husband, and I know it was just the easiest thing to say to our real estate agent, but I can’t stop thinking about it, and well — it would be nice.”
. They can’t just sign up to yet another cosmic entity fucking with their lives. The only thing Billie has going for her is that she has rules she sticks to, no matter how fucked they can be at times, and that gives him some comfort.
Claire’s face immediately falls; she bites her lip and says, “It’s not for me, Dean. I know Jody really hoped for it, but I’m not like Patience or Alex. At least with hunting, I feel like I’m doing something to help people.”
He’s about to pick up a pair of khakis when Cas says, “Dean, I think I found the perfect hunting gear for him.”
“I believe you mean that,” Cas says, his lips quirking up into a small smile that doesn’t reach his eyes. There’s a
Cas is staring out the window at the dark sky above them when they cross state lines into Montana. Dean catches his face as they pass under a street light. His dark hair curls at the back; he stares at the curve of his cheekbones, the quiet downward turn of his eyes, the perpetual frown on his lips. Dean drags his eyes away. He clears his throat and asks, "What are we going to do when we find him?"
“I forgive you,” Dean says suddenly. Jack’s eyes widen in surprise, and Dean knows his own face would betray his shock at how true that is. He was angry; hell, he’s probably still angry, and he might be angry for a long time, but it’s not Jack’s fault. It took him awhile to get here, but with everything happening with Chuck, it seems so utterly pointless holding it over Jack. It’s not like Jack chose to become soulless. They saddled him with that burden, all because they couldn’t deal with his death. So, yeah, he misses his mother, but he missed Jack just as much. Dean clears his throat. He repeats, “I forgive you, Jack, and you’re wrong because you’re clearly feeling a lot right now, and --” Dean hesitates, thinking about his words. “And, I’m really sorry, too.”
Sam looks between them before he walks down the hallway. Dean inhales sharply, focusing on steadying his breath. He can do this; he
Cas raises a brow. "I'm an angel, and Jack is one of the most powerful beings in the universe. I think we'll be fine."
"She says that I need to get stronger because I'm the only one that can defeat Chuck," Jack explains, rubbing the nape of his neck. Dean exchanges a silent look with Cas and then with Sam, the worry palpable on all their faces in equal measure. "She said that I need to stay hidden and not use my powers, and she'll reach out to me as soon as it's time."
Dean’s chest tightens. Jack stares at him, waiting for a confirmation or rejection, but Dean can’t say anything. Instead, he takes a deep breath and turns to walk out of the room. At that moment, Dean realizes how hard it must have been for Cas and Sam over the years.
“Well, I mean half the windows are broken, so I’m sure there’s a draft,” Patricia starts. She looks between them and Dean knows that she’s silently debating just how insane they are. When they don’t say anything, she stutters, “Um — well, the locals think that the ghost of Clive McAllister haunts the house.”
They pull apart, and Dean flinches at the sight in front of him. The vast, scornful emptiness in front of him starts to take shape; it alternates between the shape of John, cold and ruthless, before switching to that of Mary — inviting and wholesome, but so utterly unlike the real Mary. It shifts to Jack, but the version of Jack with the burnt eyes, making the perpetual guilt that Dean feels twist into something utterly unbearable. The Shadow laughs once, clearly pleased with its own cruelty, before it changes again into Chuck.
“This might be hard to believe, but I’ve grown fond of the boy as well,” Billie says, somewhat sharply, glancing between the two of them. “Believe me when I say that if there was another way, I would have pursued it, but God’s death book is very clear on what his eventual demise is.”
them. Though, I suppose, there’s a blessing in there because a lot of those early memories were pretty awful. Still, I wish I could remember how it was when Mount Everest formed or the first storm on Earth.”
. He’s said it before, but right then, with Cas hunched over, beyond defeated, Dean knows that’s not enough.
There’s a flurry of movement in the bunker as everyone packs their gear. Rowena gets her setup ready, his eyes flashing purple, as she reads through the book; Eileen loads her gun with angel killing bullets while Sam is transferring holy oil into a small can. Dean looks down at his gun — completely ineffective against Amara, but he likes having it on him. He scans the room and immediately spots Cas passing by in the hallway. Dean double checks his gear bag before he zips it up and races out the room.
“Are you okay, Jack?” Cas asks, dropping down to the bed. Jack reaches his arms out and Cas scoops him up into his lap. Dean drops down on the bed beside them. Cas studies Jack’s face and asks, “Did you have a nightmare?”
“You are,” Cas confirms earnestly. “I think you’re doing well, and I think you’ll do better eventually. You clearly care very deeply for him, Dean, and it shows in everything you do.”
, of all people. When Cas raises an eyebrow at him, Dean shakes his head. Whatever, it’s fine; he’s fine. "He's sorting out a vampire nest about three hours north with Eileen."
“Well, not yet,” Cas says from next to him. “We still need to close and we won’t get the keys for another month. There’s also the fact that it requires a lot of repairs before it’s suitable for us to live in and —”
“I like this,” Cas says, picking up a onesie with bees on it. Dean wrinkles his nose - it’s a pale yellow; it looks ridiculous, but Cas stares at him with big, hopeful eyes that Dean sighs, and throws it into the cart as well. He’s never been particularly good at saying no to Cas, and Cas really loves bees. This earns him a small, grateful, smile. “Thank you.”
Amara, think about it. He locked you up because you stood in the way of his perfect world. He throws away people and things at a whim just because he’s bored. He doesn’t care about anything or anyone — and, that includes you.”
He wakes up again during the ending credits, and more specifically, during a pillow thrown at him during the end credits. When he blinks awake, he sees Cas with his head thrown back and mouth slightly open. Dean slowly sits up and rubs the sleep out of his eyes with the back of his hands. He lightly taps Cas on the stomach.
“I’m sorry,” Dean mumbles, reaching out to grab Cas’s wrist, pulling him closer. Cas settles between Dean’s legs and loops an arm around his shoulder, threading a hand through the hair at the back of Dean’s neck. Dean drops his head against Cas’s chest. He says, “I can’t do this, Cas.”
“We want him to grow up strong, Dean,” Cas says as he takes out Sam’s oatmeal and a bottle of honey.
Dean bows his head in shame. There’s not much he could say to that, so he says what he knows is true. "I'm really sorry, Cas."
“But you can fix it, right?” Jack asks. “You’ll fix it, and we’ll go back to the bunker, and everything will be back to normal, right?”
Jack’s eyes immediately snap away from the wall towards Dean. When he doesn’t say anything, Dean steps inside the room gingerly, closing the door behind him.
Dean opens his mouth to argue but closes it again. Sam is silent for a long time, and Dean pulls the phone back from his ear to make sure he didn't accidentally hang up, but then Sam says, "I don't know what happened between you two, but I know you were messed up for a while, and so was Cas."
“Some monsters like vengeful spirits are hopeless, and all we can do is salt and burn, but others like werewolves, we could probably work something out to keep them from killing,” Sam explains. “I mean, Garth managed to go years without feeding on humans, and we know plenty of vampires that drink cow blood.”
“Dean, I don’t blame you,” Jack says, squinting at him. “None of that was your fault. Chuck was manipulating you, just like he was manipulating me.”
“No, you can’t,” Dean agrees, reaching over to take Cas’s hand. “We’ll just stumble onto a toddler next time.”
“I’m sorry, boys,” The woman says, shrugging apologetically. “There’s only one room. It has two queens, if that would help.”
When Cas looks at him, Dean can see the fear flash behind his eyes. Dean swallows hard. Everything he could say is so incredibly inadequate in the moment; losing a part of yourself is the most terrifying thing a person can experience, and Dean can’t imagine the profound unfairness at Cas losing his oldest memories.
Cas’s face twists into something so utterly devastating  that Dean freezes on the spot. Cas shuts his eyes and says, “I know you aren’t him, so please stop.”
Dean looks around the room and the tension is so heavy that Dean feels the nausea rising through him. He says, “Okay, lay it on us. What do we need?”
“Was an accident,” Dean finishes. There was a time he wouldn’t have believed that, but he’s mostly past it now. He’s not sure if Cas is right and he’s not the person driven by anger, but at the very least, he can make a conscious decision not to let it rule him. Not around Jack, at least.
Cas squeezes his hand again and looks at him so fondly that Dean feels his heart thudding, everything feels just a little bit brighter. He says, “I love you, too. I don’t — uh, I know I don’t say it often enough, but I would have been long dead without you.”
“No, I want to,” Dean says. Cas takes several steps forward so that he’s looking down at Dean. When Dean meets Cas’s eyes, he feels like the dam is opening inside him and all his emotions are ready to burst out. He exhales sharply. “Look, I know I haven’t always been the best to you —”
Dean pats him on the shoulder, squeezing it gently. He tries smiling when he says, “Death doesn’t really stick with me.”
It becomes evident that they need to lock up all their weapons because if it exists somewhere that a toddler can reach, Jack will most certainly get his hands on it.  They also set up a playpen for him, which ends up being completely useless, because apparently Jack’s wings haven’t gone anywhere, and he can still fly.
“Something like that,” Dean agrees. He clears his throat and picks one of the chips from the bowl between them. He asks, “Okay, now that we got our chick flick moment out of the way, spill. What’s going on with The Empty?”
Dean opens his mouth to retort when Jack jumps off his chair and walks over. His eyes shine with excitement and he tilts his screen towards Dean. He says, “Dean, look, I found a surfboard in Nook’s Cranny.”
Jack stands back up, dusting himself off. He smiles slightly, dropping a little plastic bag with a bone inside on the table. With a wince, he says, “Billie’s teleportation is so different from my flying.”
When Sam had come to him to discuss the possibility of moving out, Dean told him that they all had true free will now and that Sam can do what he wants. Dean admits that it was probably a little snide at the time because it’s hard to break away from more than two decades of indoctrination at the hands of his father, but now, looking at the boxes, Dean thinks he’s okay with it. There’s always a time for the kids to move out because that’s who Sam is -- Sam is his brother, but he’s also his baby brother, and in his own way, a son.
Dean clears his throat and says, “Hey, Jack. I don’t know if you can hear me, or hell, if you wanna hear from me. I hope you’re okay, wherever you are. I hope you know that if you need anything, you can always come to Sam and me, okay? We miss you.” Dean bows his head and takes a deep breath. “Jack, I’m sorry. I know I can never make amends for everything you’ve had to deal with on Earth, but I really wish I had a chance to try.”
Jack is silent for a very long time. He doesn’t look at Dean; instead, he moves the cookies on the tray into a neat, little pile before knocking it over and starting over again. Dean fidgets with a loose string on his shirt just so he has something to do with his hands. When Jack still doesn’t say anything, Dean feels restless. He blurts out, “And I never should have pulled that gun on you. Jack, you deserve way better than me.”
Dean finds a half-empty bottle of whiskey in one of the cabinets, and drinks straight from the bottle, waiting. He’s scrolling through some files on his laptop when Cas lets out a low whine and Dean nearly trips over his feet to be at his side, but Cas doesn’t wake up; instead, he pulls the quilts up over his shoulder and curls into himself. Dean can’t resist reaching a hand out, pushing Cas’s hair out of his face to check for a fever, even if he knows that angels probably don’t get fevers. Dean collapses onto the chair adjacent to the couch and waits.
has middle of the night plans now that he and Eileen have the bunker to themselves, and he’s pretty sure talking to Dean is dead last on the list of things Cas actually wants to do.
Dean falls asleep in the chair next to Cas, and he finds that he sleeps through the whole night for once.
Cas mumbles a quiet thanks when Dean hands it over. He’s too busy counting through the twenty dollar bill that Maria, the owner of the market, hands over. It’s not until they’re heading back to the truck to load their groceries that Dean can’t wait anymore. He blurts out, “I think I’m going to quit drinking. You know, cold turkey and all.”
"Well, whatever worked on Amara should work on Chuck, and Michael is the only archangel left, and he might still be in the cage. It's worth following up on, just in case Billie’s plan doesn’t work," Sam explains.
“Alive,” Cas mutters. “I have no idea how you dealt with being tossed around like a rag doll all these years.”
Dean just stares at him. When Cas catches him, he shrugs and raises a brow. “What? The books all suggest that you speak to them in a tone they find pleasant.”
There’s a universal cliche about how you’re lost before you find your person, but Dean thinks there’s some truth to that. There’s a lot they still need to figure out, but they have a lifetime for that. It’s the first time in Dean’s long life that he feels like he has an anchor. He feels like he’s coming home after a long war, and in a lot of ways that’s exactly what happened.
Jack drops his head into his hands. “Well, not unless you have Cas’s blood lying around. Nick tried to rise Lucifer from The Empty once with a ritual, but obviously The Empty took Castiel’s body when it took him.”
Dean thinks that Cas doesn’t get nearly enough credit for being the best fucking father in the universe because the level of concentration that spreads across his face should be criminal. He can literally see Cas considering every single day. Patiently, Cas says, “My birthday should be June 18th.”
Sam immediately closes his mouth and nods slowly, an unspoken understanding passing between them that Dean is grateful for. Sam nods twice; the concern palpable on his face, and Dean can see the emotions flickering behind his eyes. He says, “We could try and get him back.”
“I’m sorry,” Dean says. He doesn’t know what he’s apologizing for. “For what it’s worth, I’m glad you never gave up on me.”
“Dean,” Jack says once, opening his hand to reveal a very familiar black goo. Dean’s blood runs cold. Jack croaks, “Dean, I tried.”
, or at least he thinks he is. The Winchester customary four hours of sleep gradually increased to a solid six, and lately, Dean thinks he’s even pulling eight hours. He still gets nightmares sometimes, it’s impossible not to. He still wakes up in the middle of the night thinking that this is all a djinn dream, and his life will crash around him, leaving nothing in his wake. He tries to shake the feeling, but he never seems to. The anxiety still prickles under his skin.
The market is busy by the time they arrive, and Cas circles the gravel makeshift parking lot a few times looking for a place to park. Dean finds some amusement that, of all the things in the world for Cas to be carefully precise about, driving a beat down truck is one of them. He slips the car into a spot in the back corner, and they step out into the crisp air. Dean reaches out to grab one of the containers filled with pumpkins while Cas grabs the other one.
Sam and Jack are waiting outside the infirmary when Dean walks out. Sam immediately stands up, shooting a look in Dean’s direction. Dean just nods, silently telling Sam that yes, Cas is fine. He might be human now, and Dean will come to terms with that and what that means with regards to
“Billie approached me while I was having my Tuesday afternoon massage telling me that you boys need help,” Rowena explains, flipping through the pages of the spellbook. “Of course, I could never say no to that. This is the Draíocht Dhiaga — an ancient, Celtic spell book that has been kept in Hell for millennia, and we think that this might solve our collective problems when it comes to God.”
across it. Cas’s face splits into a proud grin, and he drops it into the cart without waiting for Dean to respond. Obviously, they’re getting that.
Dean exchanges a look with Cas who just shrugs. Cas ruffles Jack’s hair and says, “Do you want to hear a story?”
Later that night, when Sam and Eileen come over for dinner and movie night, Cas slumps against him. Halfway through Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Cas leans over and whispers, “The answer is forty-two.”
Dean thinks Claire’s eyes are going to fall out of her head with the force of her eye roll. She says, “As I was saying — cute, but please don’t let me walk in on anything.”
He knows it’s all over his face because Sam looks at him with thinly veiled concern, like any word could be the wrong word to say in that moment, but Dean can’t bring himself to care anymore. Cas is gone, and this time, it might actually be for good. He’s ridden the waves of grief so many times in the past, but this feels different. It’s like he’s stuck in time, unable to move, unable to focus on anything, but the fact that Cas is gone, and unlike last time, Dean doesn’t even have a body to burn.
Dean swallows, but doesn’t say anything. Cas gets up from the chair to sit down next to him on the bed, close enough that their shoulders touch. Cas blinks at him, not even trying to keep his tears at bay. Dean thinks, suddenly, that this is the first time he’s seen Cas cry. Really, truly cry.
Amara laughs, low, shaking her head in amusement. “Oh Dean, do you think you found me? I let you find me because I have information that might be of use to you.”
Dean bites his tongue to keep himself from laughing as Sam and Eileen immediately register the fact that they’re not alone in the bunker. It takes a second, but Eileen immediately jumps from her place on Sam’s lap, buttoning her shirt, and turns to give them a mock salute. It takes Sam a little longer to catch up, as he scrambles around for his shirt, but when he does, he looks up at them, smiling sheepishly, the tips of his ears pink.
Dean takes the long way back, driving an extra two hours, just so he doesn’t have to run into anyone in the bunker, but of course, the universe is out to get him. He makes it back just in time to find Sam pouring over lore books in the war room. Sam shoots him a wary smile, like Dean is made of glass, and that just makes Dean want to throw a punch. He’s fine, Jesus Christ. Besides, they’re all professionals.
When Dean knocks on the door, there’s no reply on the other end; Dean waits a moment before turning the handle to find Jack sitting cross-legged on his bed as he stares at the wall, completely zoned out. “Jack.”
Dean doesn’t know when he falls asleep, but when he wakes up the next morning, he realizes that he managed to go through a night without nightmares. When Dean looks down, Cas has an arm sprawled across his chest and their legs are tangled together; Cas is snoring lightly, and Dean has half a mind to just lay there until he no longer can, but he doesn’t. He pulls himself out of bed and grabs an old book detailing everything the Men of Letters knew about cosmic entities off his desk.
“We will,” Dean says quickly. He almost wants to shove Sam out the bunker to make him get on with it.
“You know, Jack, we can’t save everyone,” Dean says quietly. “We did what we could, and we stopped it from taking any more victims.”
“That’s very selfless,” Dean says, thinking, not for the first time, that Cas is entirely too good for him.
“There’s something you need to know,” Jack says quietly. He looks like a terrified, wounded animal with the way he scans the room, eyes flickering at everything except the actual people in the room.
“Nah, I think you got this covered,” Dean says with a wave, but then Cas gives him another look, and this one says
Whatever The Shadow wants to say gets lost in a burst of light, and the next thing Dean knows, he’s being pulled through the nonexistent floor. He tries to keep his eyes on Cas, but he loses him as the light glows brighter.
Dean stands up, and Cas kisses him immediately, reaching up to cradle both cheeks. Dean makes a weak sound in the back of his throat and kisses back, eyes fluttering shut as he curls closer. When they break apart, Dean leans forward to press his forehead against Cas’s. He murmurs, “I love you.” The words still feel new, like no matter how many times he says it, it still feels like the first time.
That gets a smile out of Dean, even if he still feels like he wants to burn the whole world down and start over. They sit in silence for what feels like hours, and it very might be. Dean doesn’t know what to feel anymore.
They go grocery shopping once a week together. It originally started because the one time he sent Cas to do it on his own, he came back with too much of everything, mostly because he didn’t know how to choose between all the options available. When Dean decided to go instead, Cas wanted to accompany him. It was under the guise of learning about the basics, but Dean knows that Cas enjoys it. He enjoys it too, if he’s being honest, even when they’re doing it at the ass crack of dawn, or whatever.
Dean watches Jack walk away before turning to Sam, who gives him a positively shit eating, a typical younger brother who waited a lifetime to tease him, grin and Dean squints his eyes. He mouths
“I’m not letting Jack out of my sight,” Cas says. Jack opens his mouth to argue and Cas gives him a look. “Jack, I need you to understand that as much as you want to help, you’re still my responsibility.”
cowboy hat. It’s flat out the most adorable, sickeningly adorable, thing that Dean has ever seen. He doesn’t even wait for the go ahead from Cas before he picks it off the shelf and drops it on Jack’s head. Jack shakes his head for a moment before the hat dips further down his head till it’s almost covering his eyes, and he lets out a giggle.
“I’m getting you out of this deal if it’s the last thing I do,” Dean says suddenly, his voice far stronger than it had any right to be.
Rowena goes back to her book. She’s silent for a very, very long time and Dean can feel the anxiety rise in him. Eventually, she lets out a heavy sigh and closes the book. She pinches her forehead and closes her eyes. When she opens them again, she gives them a small, sad smile. Her voice is strained when she says, “I’m sorry, boys. I really thought I had something here, but unfortunately, this won’t work.”
“We’re working on rehabilitation too,” Eileen says, signing along. “With the demons in hell, we’re just working with regular monsters and most of them can be saved.”
“Do you want to hear the story of Daniel in the lion’s den?” Cas asks Jack, whose only response is to stare at Cas and blow a spit bubble. Cas laughs. “I’ll take that as a yes.”
"Yes, our Rowena," Sam confirms with a hint of pride in his voice. Dean lets out a low chuckle. Of course, Rowena is the new Queen of Hell. If anyone is fitting of the title, it's her. "She said that she'll do me a solid and help me track down Michael. With his help, maybe we'll come up with something."
“I’m sure we can manage,” Cas says over the phone when Dean walks over. When he spots Dean, he puts the phone back on speaker and says, “Sam is explaining that he found a way to track the demigod down, but it might be too late to try and get him tonight.”
“Are you happy?” Dean asks, not because he doesn’t trust that this is actually his life now, but he still needs to know.
Jack looks up and Dean smiles encouragingly. Jack bites his bottom lip, a flicker of nerves crossing over his face before he sighs. “I don’t feel anything, and that scares me. Logically, I know things that are true, like —” Jack hesitates, a hint of something Dean can’t read passes over his face. He slowly presses on, “Like I know that I feel bad about killing your mother.”
Dean exhales slowly before he says, “Someone I care about made a deal with it, and I would like to get him out of it.”
There’s sound; there’s actual, perceivable by human beings sound, and Dean turns around so quickly that he feels the whiplash. It takes a moment for his eyes to register light, or a reflection, or movement. When he does, the air rushes out of his lungs. There, in front of him, is Cas looking exactly like the last time Dean saw him.
“Don’t overthink it,” Sam says firmly, giving Dean a look. Then, he shoots an absolute shit eating grin at Dean. “We could have a joint wedding.”
He’s not sure who leans forward first, but the next thing Dean knows is that Cas presses his lips to Dean’s mouth; it’s not exactly a kiss, more of a brush of lips, but Dean leans back immediately. He stares at him, wide-eyed and unmoving.
Sam nods and turns to Cas. “Do you, Castiel, take Dean Winchester to be your non-lawful wedded husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?”
“I’m not doing family trust exercises,” Claire tells him immediately. Dean snickers; he has no intention of ever making anyone do trust exercises, of all things, but he knows that Jody probably put the girls up to it at least once. When Claire smirks up at him, all confidence and bravado, Dean just rolls his eyes and pulls her into a hug. Against his chest, Claire says, “What’s this about anyways?”
Jack doesn’t say anything for a long time. It’s not until they pass the sign welcoming them into Lebanon that Jack speaks up. “What if I don’t like it?”
“Here’s to good parenting,” Dean says, tilting his bottle towards Cas who clinks his. Dean considers it for a moment before amending, “Here’s to
It shouldn’t be easy to avoid people in a cabin as small as Cas’s is, but that’s what happens. Dean doesn’t get any sleep the first night, so he finds himself up early. He walks down the path from the cabin to the grocery store. He picks up eggs and bacon, tries cooking, and hopes the smell would draw Cas and Jack out of their respective rooms. It doesn’t quite work, and Dean heads back into the living room and pulls out his laptop to work. The second day is a little better because Jack comes downstairs in his pajamas. His hair is unruly, and he looks terrible.
Eileen looks at him for a long time before she smiles. She signs along as she says, “Well, there’s always Daphne — or Fred, if you’d rather.”
There have been a lot of times where Dean appreciates Cas's bluntness and honesty, but he would be lying if it doesn't sting. His first instinct is to shout — to tell Cas that he can leave if Cas doesn’t want him here, which he clearly doesn’t — but, Dean knows deep down that if he walks away without fixing this, he’ll never have another chance to. It’s not like it matters though because when he tries speaking, his throat constricts and the words don’t come out.
Amara frowns, eyeing the diagram carefully. She doesn’t say anything for a moment, her gaze flickering between the diagram and Dean’s face. The corners of her mouth quirk up into a half-smile and she says, “You’re playing with fire, Dean — but, I think I can do this for you.”
“Kid isn’t listening,” Dean tells him, not really bitter about it. “I mean, who can blame him? The last time he was around, I was ready to sacrifice him.”
It takes two days, Cas begging an untrustworthy Shaman, and Sam reading through every book that the Men of Letters have ever collected for them to even grasp what The Occultum could be, and even then, finding it becomes an entirely separate thing.
“Did you know that a honey bee would have to fly around ninety thousand miles, three times around the globe,  to make one pound of honey?” Cas asks. Dean is about to answer that no, he doesn’t know that, because most people wouldn’t know that, but then realizes that Cas is talking to Jack. Without waiting for a response, Cas continues, “It can fly up to fifteen miles an hour, which is much, much slower than you, but still, I suppose it’s still flying.”
“In exchange for Jack’s soul, I traded my life,” Cas explains quietly, his eyes never leaving Dean’s. “I’m sorry, Dean, but I couldn’t handle losing him and it was the only way. I don’t regret it for a minute.”
Sam wordlessly steps into his room, shuts the door behind him, and pulls up a chair. The lines of stress form on his forehead as he frowns. “Explain.”
Dean doesn’t have time to worry about a plan because a sphere of light descents onto the church. He exchanges a look with Cas as the sphere drops down. Within seconds, the hellhounds are gone, and the sphere explodes into a burst of light, leaving Jack in its wake.
“Still, this is kind of nice,” Dean says, reaching around Jack to push the talking button on the teddy bear’s stomach, but he quickly moves his hand away when Jack fixes him a look that can only be described as territorial. Dean smiles. “It looks like he’s calmed down, finally.”
Dean can’t see anything ahead of him and he closes his eyes. He feels a body, definitely Jack’s, and he blindly reaches a hand out to hold Jack’s. The pushback from Chuck’s powers is stronger than anything Dean has come up against. He wants to recoil, to let the light wash over him and knock him back, but he can’t. He holds on to Jack’s hand and he knows Cas is doing the same thing with the other hand.
“Sam, I’m okay,” Dean tells him, and he is. He really is. He smiles when he says, “I don’t get why you would want to go hunting on the road in shitty motels when you could live here, but hey, it’s your choice.”
At the edge of the lot, there’s a circle of tall trees, their leaves turning a burnt orange shade as they fall to the ground. Dean can feel the heaviness settle into his head as he tries to focus on them. The hangovers are worse than they were, which definitely has something to do with age, but there’s also the fact that he’s no longer a character in one of Chuck’s twisted stories, so he’s feeling it.
Dean curls up on his side and drapes his throw blanket over his lower torso, unperturbed by the state of the world. He doesn’t know how long he lies there, staring up at the ceiling, but he knows it’s been a day, maybe longer. There’s quiet whispering outside his door, but Dean doesn’t move. He tugs his blanket more tightly around himself.
“That day in the kitchen when you asked me if you were the only one that felt something between us, I told you that I was sorry,” Cas says hesitantly. Dean closes his eyes and feels the wetness on his face. He only opens his eyes again because he feels Cas’s hand reaching out to his as he laces their fingers together. “I believe I made you feel like I didn’t feel the same way, but that’s not true. I — I love you. I’ve loved you for as long as I’ve known you, even if I didn’t realize it.”
Dean knows his face is probably bright red. He ducks his head and scratches the back of his neck. “A bit hard when one of us is legally dead and one of us technically doesn’t exist.” Sam is still staring at him with the same expression so Dean concedes, “Yeah, okay, consider it considered.”
"Right," Cas says cooly, not looking at Dean. He moves towards the discarded jar of paint, picks it up, and hands it over to Dean. "If you want to stay, then start painting the warding."
Billie nods. “He would no longer be bound to The Empty. The choice is yours, Castiel. Most angels, with eons of memories, would struggle.”
While all the other forms it takes had something wrong with them, the version of Chuck staring back at them is actually eerily uncanny. Dean recoils at the way it’s face twists into a mocking smile. Cas shifts next to him, resting his hand on Dean’s forearm. Any words that Dean wants to say get lost in his throat.
Rowena laughs and it’s this lilt of a thing and Dean feels a rush of warmth. He missed her; he misses everyone, all the time, so much. She says, “I thought as much, which is why I got in touch with an old friend and we’re here to help.”
Cas is still staring at him, his eyes dancing with amusement. He bites his lower lip and smiles. “So, say it.”
It’s not that he avoids talking to Cas, but he does avoid bringing up Cas’s confession. There’s every chance that, with his newfound humanity, Cas realized that it’s all a mistake; he could wake up one day and realize that Dean is a screw up, with very little to his name, and a long body count.
“How dare you,” Chuck hisses, raising a finger. Dean braces himself as Chuck snaps his fingers. When nothing happens, his eyes widen in surprise, flickering around the room. He tries snapping his fingers again, and once again, nothing happens. He drops his shoulders. His voice is meek when he says,  “Fuck, now what?”
"Right," Dean nods. "Call me if you need help?" He means for it to be a statement, but it comes out as a question anyway.
“It’s your life and as long as you’re doing what makes you happy, nobody can tell you otherwise,” Dean concedes. He knows that feeling all too well, even if he didn’t particularly have that choice.
he feels creeping through him. Logically, he knows that Jack is his kid; he’s their kid, but it’s different when Jack is an actual, genuine, toddler. Something about it makes Dean scrape back the layers of what Jack might be, what Jack could be, and see Jack for what he is; he’s just a child who has been through entirely too much in the short span of his life. Dean hates thinking about how much of that is at his hands, but seeing Jack like this changes perspective.
She picks up her scythe again and is about to teleport out of the bunker when Dean says, “Wait.” Billie raises a brow at him. Dean clears his throat and exchanges a look with Cas before looking at Billie. “Do you know about Cas’s deal with The Empty?”
Billie eyes them all considerately. “The same will go for the gates of Heaven. I don’t see myself as
Amara collapses to her knees, looking ahead at where Chuck’s form lies. Dean exchanges a look with Sam, who has an arm around Eileen. Rowena hunches over the table, and Dean can see her struggling. Billie, who looks better than the rest of them, still looks drained. Nobody says anything, everyone watching carefully for any sign of life from Chuck. It takes several long minutes before Chuck coughs, and jolts into alertness. He tries standing but he can’t and drops back down.
“The next time Cas steals a child, he’ll make sure that they’re a bit younger so we can repurpose them,” Dean tells Sam.
“Don’t say it,” Dean grits out. He doesn’t care that he’s being an asshole making Cas an unspoken term between the two of them. He closes his eyes again. “I’m fine.”
“We’re people who want to talk about buying the house,” Cas says, pointedly. Dean snickers, but immediately shuts up when Cas gives him a look. Keeping his voice level and entirely too professional for an ex-Angel with very few people skills, he says, “Ms. Blake, if you could show me the garden while my husband and son find this ghost, that would be great.”
“I’m sure, Dean,” Sam tells him as he brings another box out into the main room of the bunker. He looks at Dean, knits his brows together, and gives him a look. “Are you sure
Lebanon is a town with a population of two hundred and eighteen people, which doesn’t include anyone living in the bunker on the rural road on the outskirts of town. There’s exactly one non denominational chapel that brags about being the geographic center of the contiguous United States, but the actual center is a tiny monument at a nearby park. Nobody actually visits Lebanon, so it’s very easy to know who everybody is, and everybody notices the weirdos living in the abandoned factory on the rural road that isn’t actually a part of the town.
Billie doesn’t say anything for a long time, and Dean thinks she might teleport out, but she doesn’t. Instead, she looks at them and nods. “Okay.”
He camps out in the infirmary all night. There’s only one bed, so Dean sleeps in a chair. Jack paces around the room, occasionally running a hand over Cas’s body. Dean sometimes makes out wings flapping, signaling Jack popping in and out of the room. He doesn’t know how long he’s been asleep for, but when he wakes up, he finds Cas sitting up in the bed. There’s tired lines around his eyes, but he’s smiling.
“You will have less than a minute to snap your fingers and then God will be bound and his powers will flow into you,” Rowena explains. “Now, I don’t know what will happen after that point, and the power surge will be immense, but we’re all hoping you can hold it off.”
“You’re a real piece of work, you know that?” Dean says out loud again, like he’s done so many times in prayers that went nowhere. “You always do this, man. You have no clue how it makes me feel, knowing that I just can never protect you, no matter how hard I try. If you just told me sooner, we could have figured it out together, and none of this would have happened.”
“I miss it,” Sam tells him, considerately. Dean thinks that his brother might be insane at that moment. Sam catches his face and laughs, “Oh, cut me some slack. I love the bunker -- I do, but you know, Eileen and I want to hunt, and sometimes the best part of hunting is stumbling on to cases.”
Dean is bought out of his thoughts by Jack whimpering, his impossibly small mouth opening in a yawn. When Dean looks down at him, he lifts his tiny arms up. Cas laughs, and it’s this blissful, little thing that Dean can think about forever. Cas says, “I think he wants you to carry him.”
There’s also no jobs in Lebanon, which Dean realizes several job searches in. He also realizes that he actually has no marketable skills and next to no references, and there’s only so far a GED and a give ‘em hell attitude can carry a person. The one garage in town is owned by a man named Rudy Schmidt; he’s a man in his fifties with broad shoulders, neatly trimmed beard, and a vocabulary that extends to a few grunts and an occasional huff. Dean doesn’t know why Rudy decides to offer him the job, but he suspects it has more to do with Baby than himself, but still, he can fix a car and Rudy is more than a generous boss.
“I’m saying,” Dean says, running his thumb over Cas’s. “That I’ve been in love with you for so goddamn long that every time I tried imagining what my happy ending looked like, it was always with you.”
"Well, at least we got Jack back. I don't know if we can trust Billie, but if this works, we might finally be free," Sam says with a shake of the head.
Cas’s small, shy smile is the last thing Dean sees before he pulls Cas close to him to kiss him; he feels like the axis of his world is finally angling itself correctly. He can hear the cheers around the hall, but all he notices in that moment is Cas.
Cas pushes himself off the counter and settles down on one of the bar stools. He opens a newspaper, pulling out a pen from his pocket, and gets to work on the daily crossword puzzle. Dean makes his way to the coffee machine, pulling open one of the cupboards above to get a cup, and silently pours himself coffee. He eyes Cas furtively, but Cas pretty much ignores him, focusing on his puzzle instead. The early morning sunlight is drifting through the window above the sink, so Dean pulls apart the blinds to let the sunlight in.
“Well, I do have good news,” Sam starts just as Jack manages to narrowly escape Cas which causes Cas to step over his own feet and land on the floor in a loud thud. Dean snickers, but feels a pang of worry when Cas winces. He makes a move to stand, but Cas gets up and dusts himself. Jack, the actual devil’s son,
There isn’t a word to describe the chill that runs down Dean’s body — he almost physically rears back in shock and fear but catches himself before he does. Cas immediately pushes himself off the table and stands in front of Jack. Dean reaches a hand out to pull Cas back.
“He always takes your side,” Cas pouts. Jack looks at him innocently and Cas just shakes his head fondly. To Sam, he says, “Well, guess our consensus is the second one.”
Dean arches the hand on Cas’s shoulder around his back, pulling him closer. Cas lets himself be pulled until Dean wraps his arms around Cas, hugging him tightly. Cas drops his head to Dean’s shoulder, inhaling softly. When Cas lifts his head, emotions flood through his eyes, and Dean feels the heaviness of the moment between them. If this goes according to plan, Chuck might actually lose and they might be free for the first time in their lives; except, Dean knows that that might just be enough for The Empty to take Cas.
“No!” Jack practically shouts his reply, eyes widening in horror. He shakes his head. “Nobody else is hurt.”
“Of course,” Cas tells him, voice completely blank, but Dean sees the corners of his mouth quirk up into a small smile. He’s quiet for a moment, his face settling into something serious. “As good as the bunker has been for us, it might be time for us to put some space between us and —” He hesitates, tilting his head towards the ceiling.
If Dean’s words won’t work, maybe his prayers will. The Shadow twists it’s fingers bringing both Dean and Cas to their knees and Dean winces as he feels his bones crack. He shuts his eyes and tries concentrating past the pain.
Sam and Eileen dive into the logistics of this new network of hunters, and Dean finds himself drifting in and out of the conversation. It’s nice, he thinks, that their hunting world is so well connected now that they can do something like this. They have friends in every state — hell, they have friends in Heaven and Hell, too.
“I mean, why is it complicated?” Jack asks slowly. “I mean, you and Castiel love each other, so whatever you’re fighting about isn’t a big deal, right?”
fine. And I can’t lose him again, man, not when —” Dean hesitates, inhaling sharply. “Not when I just got him back.”
“And you did a very good job with that,” Cas tells him, completely seriously. He looks at Dean with such earnest fondness that Dean has to look away. He knows he did a good job with Sam - hell, he probably did more than a good job with Sam, but to hear Cas say it makes his chest constrict. When he looks at Cas, he’s still giving him the same, warm, look. Dean says, “Thank you, Cas. You’re not bad at this yourself.”
“No, you aren’t,” Cas deadpans. Dean bristles with swift offense, but there’s no heat in it because Cas smiles, cocking his head to the side. When Dean scoffs, Cas schools his face into the picture of innocence. He blinks up at Dean and asks, “Coffee?”
“Don’t think Cas would be too happy with that,” Sam says, with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. Dean looks over Sam’s shoulders to where Cas and Jack are talking to Eileen. Sam’s face is a lot more serious when Dean looks at him again. He says, “You should think about it, you know.”
He pulls Cas a little closer, and Cas steps into his space and blinks up. He reaches a finger up to trace a finger over where his grace is hanging around Dean’s neck and smiles. He drops his hand and slides his arm around Dean's waist, up the back of Dean’s flannel. It’s a simple gesture, but Cas’s presence grounds Dean to Earth, to this new Earth, where God is on their side and they’re all safe.
"Sam, I'm serious," Dean warns, low and dangerous. "I don't want to talk about Cas. He's pissed at me. I'm pissed at him. So, just drop it."
His statement hangs in the air and he knows Sam feels it too. He doesn’t say anything though because there isn’t much to say. Instead, Sam reaches over to the side table and pours two glasses of whiskey. He quietly hands Dean his glass and they drink in silence.
Cas is so much, always. It sometimes hits Dean suddenly that Cas is this multidimensional wave of celestial intent dressed in a trench coat who lives down the hall from him, and Dean couldn’t be luckier for it. He doesn’t know what he’s done to deserve someone so otherworldly finding it in himself to spend time with Dean, even if it’s temporary.
“But, I do have an option for you,” Billie says slowly. Dean whips his head up to look at her. Billie bites her lip and looks away from him and directly at Cas, who tilts his head to the side in confusion. Billie sighs and pulls out a vial filled with blue-white fog and recognition flickers across Cas’s face. She walks over and hands the vial of grace back to Cas.
Jack is silent for a long time, still staring at the ground. When he finally looks up, there’s the first hint of tears forming in his eyes. Dean takes a step forward to comfort him but hesitates when Jack wipes the tears away with the back of his hands. It takes a moment but he schools his face into steady determination. He takes a sharp breath and looks at them.
"I can help," Dean offers quickly, and hopes that his silent plea translates over. Dean regrets many things in his life, but the way things ended with Jack is right at the top of the list, so if there's even the slightest hope that he can make amends, he needs to try. Jack is his kid; he's
Dean exchanges a look with Cas and Sam before turning to Billie. The fleeting illusion of security that he’s been holding on to disappears instantly. He says, “Hold up, can you tell us what the endgame is? We’re sending the kid into these quests with no idea what we’re getting ourselves into.”
He wakes up earlier than he intends, and he’s about to fall back asleep when he hears movement in the kitchen. When Dean walks in, he sees Cas moving around with a level of ease that he hasn't seen before. Not even at the bunker. Dean leans against the door frame and watches Cas pour himself a mug of coffee, with his back turned to Dean. His hair is mussed, and he's in a thin white t-shirt, and Dean doesn't remember the last time he's seen Cas dressed down. His chest flutters lightly at the sight.
“Shut up,” Dean grumbles. Cas places a hand on his shoulder and Dean immediately deflates. “I’m sorry.”
Dean makes a list of everything they need for a two year old. Between the internet and Cas’s old parenting books, he thinks he has everything down. They’ll need a first aid kit, of course, because even though Jack might still have his healing abilities, they can never be too careful. A stroller seems unnecessary because they aren’t going anywhere, but a car seat is absolutely paramount - just in case they have to leave the bunker in a hurry. They already tried Cas holding Jack in his arms while Dean drove, and that wasn’t ideal. Jack definitely needs blankets in case he gets cold; toys, too, and maybe a playpen for when he wants to play, and clothes, lots of clothes.
Almost right on cue, Jack strolls into the main room, his Nintendo Switch in hand. He waves at Sam and Dean before he drops down on a chair, looking down at his game.
“That’s nice,” Dean mutters, tossing the potatoes into the broth. He ignores the bitterness creeping into him. It’s not that he’s not happy for Sam, of course, he is. It’s just that he doesn’t want to consider what his own happiness looks like. When Sam doesn’t say anything else, Dean adds, “I’m happy for you, man.”
“Dean, calm down,” Sam tells him gently. “Look, as long as he’s not coughing up blood or fainting, maybe it’s just a side effect of everything he’s been through lately.”
“Yeah, but it’s expensive,” Dean starts but Cas stares at him firmly, and Jack picks a box off the shelf, and really, Dean never had a chance. He sighs. “Alright, alright. Put it in the cart.”
Dean swings open the door and spots an elderly woman reading a newspaper in the dim glow of the office. Dean puts on his best smile and approaches the woman. “Hey, we’re looking to book two rooms.”
“Neither did I,” Dean admits with a frown. He still feels like he’s behind the curve on that one with Jack, at least. He can feel Cas studying him, so he puts on a smile that he knows doesn’t reach his eyes and says, “We should try to put him to sleep.”
, what did you think was going to happen? You needed a soul bomb to take out Amara, and that was when she was significantly weakened by your band of merry misfits. Chuck, even with a magic bullet wound, is still devouring worlds at an alarming pace. This is the only way.”
“Probably,” Sam agrees, but he doesn’t look up from his computer. For a moment, Dean wants to throw something at him to get him to focus; instead, he clears his throat loudly. Sam looks up and meets his eyes and sighs. “I’m sure there’s probably a spell in the Book of the Damned or the Black Grimoire, but we don’t have a witch that can pull that kind of magic off.”
Cas reaches out again, touches his elbow, but Dean turns around and steps out of his reach. Dean lets out another shaky breath and walks out of the room.
. The thought fills Dean with white, hot rage. He knows that it’s probably his fault, but in Dean’s experience, people who care don’t just up and leave when things get tough.
He doesn’t look back at Sam as he leaves the room, even as Sam calls after him. He locks the door behind him before dropping down on the bed; the dim light in the corner casts a foggy haze over the room, and Dean shuts his eyes.
“Oh,” Jack says slowly. He’s still staring at Dean, and it’s disconcerting in a way that’s so reminiscent of Cas. After a moment, Jack shrugs. “Well, you should get married.”
Jack blinks, still staring at his hands. He shakes his head and smiles at them. “That was really weird.”
A chill runs up Dean’s spine and he feels his heart stumble over its own rhythm. Jack's face flashes in his mind — bright eyes turning burnt and blackened, carefree smile turning heartbroken and betrayed. Jack is
There’s just a softness to Cas in the morning that Dean doesn’t often get to see during the day, and Dean feels a flutter in his chest at the intimacy of it all. When Cas catches sight of Dean in the entryway, he tilts his chin up and smiles sleepily.
It’s not until he hears footsteps walking into the room that he stops. Cas is leaning against the door frame, a frown on his face. Dean drops his head in shame. Cas doesn’t say anything, and instead walks over to the bed, and takes the bottle out of Dean’s hand.
, he tells himself over and over again because it’s not him; he’s not a fifteen year old girl, moping around his room waiting for the guy he likes to call him back — except, Dean thinks, he’s spent so many nights like this over the years, waiting for Cas to respond to his messages or his prayers. It’s not that Cas didn’t care because Cas does, and Dean knows that; Cas gave up his entire way of existence to follow Dean into every apocalypse thrown their way, but just because Cas cares about him doesn’t mean that it’s the same.
Cas looks at Dean with wide, stunned eyes, like this is something he never thought he’d hear, which is absolutely fair because Dean never thought he’d get a chance to say it. He opens his mouth and closes it again. When the words don’t come to him, Cas surges forward to take Dean’s face in both hands, and kisses him.
It’s the first time he’s cooking in the new kitchen. The cabinets are freshly painted; they’re a bit blotchy and unprofessional, but they did it themselves, and it looks pretty damn fantastic if Dean says so himself. He’s stirring the soup, sprinkling the salt and pepper in, when he sees Cas walk in, hair still wet from his shower. With bare feet quiet on the kitchen floor, he steps up behind Dean, hands dropping easily around Dean’s hips, and hooks his chin over Dean’s shoulders.
When he gets out, Cas already shrugged off his trench coat and his suit jacket, leaving him in his white button-down. Slowly, he takes that off too, with just the undershirt remaining. He doesn’t say anything before dropping down on the bed in the far corner and closes his eyes. Dean waits until Cas’s breathing steadies before turning to Jack, who is also watching Cas with concern.
Time ticks by and Dean feels restless. He paces around the room, checks his watch constantly, and waits. When he walks over to where Sam and Eileen are discussing the spellwork, they shoo him away. Billie raises a brow at him when he walks up to her, and Dean immediately walks away. At some point, Cas stands up and grabs Dean’s wrist, leading him back to the chair and Dean lets himself be pushed back down to sit. He passes time by playing Uno with Eileen and Jack.
Dean just nods absentmindedly. He’s too busy watching Cas settle in on a chair. Jack helps Cas pull out his grace slowly, the vial not even filling up halfway. Within seconds, Cas collapses, his head dropping to his shoulder. Dean gets up and starts pacing the room.
, Dean thinks. He could just let Cas walk away again, knowing full well that it would probably be another month, maybe longer, before he sees him again. But, Cas deserves that, doesn’t he? He left, so Dean shouldn’t call after him. Except —
Jack doesn’t say anything. It’s Cas who tries this time. “I know you feel restless, but we’ve all been through a lot in the past few years, and hunting might not be the best idea right now.”
Cas squints at him. “I’m not quite sure that we’re that similar to a pair of reckless, Italian teenagers.”
Dean smiles instinctively because Cas says things sometimes that are so effortless, kind, and thoughtful, and even if Dean doesn’t want to believe it, he has to because Cas says it with such conviction. He is selfish, Dean thinks, because he wants to save Cas from The Empty for Cas’s sake, but he also wants to save him because he can’t imagine a world where he’s okay, let alone happy, without Cas.
“No, we can’t,” Dean says immediately, his voice a lot stronger than he expected it to be. “The deal he had with The Empty was final.” He inhales sharply, counting to ten, before letting out a drawn out breath. “It’s
Jack is silent for what feels like an eternity before he exhales. He looks at Dean when he says, “Okay.”
“I’m going to kill him when he gets back,” Dean mutters, grabbing the decanter filled with whiskey in the corner. He takes a swig straight from the bottle. “I’m going to yell at him first, and
Dean just stares at him incredulously. “As long as you’re alive, that’s all that matters. Even at the expense of your powers.”
Dean exhales sharply. The resentment festering in him threatens to burst out. He starts pacing the room, clenching his fists by his side. They were so close; they almost had it. He closes his eyes and concentrates on controlling his anger.
Dean takes that as an invitation to step into the room, closing the door behind him. He walks over to Cas’s bed, his bare feet pattering on the tile floor of the bunker. He doesn’t sit down though; instead, he picks up the vial, and delicately twists it. He can feel Cas studying him, so he puts the vial down and looks at Cas, who blinks up at him.
“Dean, all you had to do was ask me to stay,” Cas says, the happiness etched all over his face. “I’m not going anywhere.”
He tries focusing on anything, but there’s nothing to focus on. There’s no light, but the darkness isn’t the darkness that he knows. It’s abstract and formless. He takes a step forward, and feels disoriented. He’s moving, he knows he’s moving, but it feels like he’s rooted in a single spot.
“You’re really scared of losing him, aren’t you?” Jack asks. Dean blinks at his surroundings. He honestly forgot that he’s not alone in the room. Jack stares at him, tilting his head quizzically. “I remember when I was born and Cas died, you were —” Jack freezes and gives Dean an apologetic look.
When realization finally comes, when the feeling and the nature of the spell finally clicks in his head, Dean’s blood runs cold in his veins. “We’re hoping? So, you’re saying this is all theoretical?”
Cas drops down on the chair next to Dean and pulls one of the forms, wordlessly filling it out. He hums. “I went down to the farmers’ market to sell some of the produce, especially since we’re moving into the house. Maria asked if I would like an opportunity to earn more money, so I said yes. I’m Spinelli Farm’s new farm hand.”
, he thinks. The worst part is that he doesn’t want to; he never wants to, but his fingers twitch around it. The hunt isn’t that far out of routine, but it still took enough out of him that he takes a swig without thinking. Then he takes another, and another.
Dean groans, but pushes himself up and rushes over to Jack. He manages to pull the book out of Jack’s hand before he could rip out the page. Jack immediately stares up at him with wide eyes and pouts, and Dean thinks that he’s doing it on purpose because Dean is
“Hey, kid,” Dean says, feeling his nerves catch up to him. He drops down across Jack at the table. When Jack stares at him expectantly, Dean clears his throat. “Listen, Jack, I need you to promise me something; if you sense anything wrong, even the vaguest inclination that something is out of the ordinary, I want you and Cas to turn back.”
They realize very quickly after dinner how easily excitable and overly curious that Jack is, which shouldn’t be surprising considering that’s how Jack normally is, but it is
“Dean, you can’t,” Sam says, exhaustion lacing his voice. “This is what I mean when you always get more and more reckless whenever Cas —”
. If you’d have told him that they would involve a devastating hangover followed by Cas asking him to accompany him on a routine trip to the farmers’ market, well, he would have laughed and then pined over that thought for ages.
"Actually, I don't," Cas says, his voice low and dangerous. When Dean meets his eyes, the anger flashes like electricity behind them, and Dean is instantly transported back to their first meeting in that barn. Cas, terrifying and strange, could have disintegrated Dean with a snap of his fingers, and Dean still decided to test him. He finds that he’s decidedly more nervous now than he was then. Now, Cas’s anger is personal.
“No,” Dean says, pulling out the chemistry packet and handing it over to Jack. “Your chemistry homework is a science.”
Sam calls them after dinner when they’re in the middle of changing Jack into his pajamas. It rings four times before Dean manages to get to his phone; he puts it on speaker and drops the phone to the table.
Jack’s face falls as he averts his gaze to the floor. Dean suddenly feels like this is all a very bad idea, but then Jack lifts his head to look directly at Billie. He says, “I am.”
Dean isn't even all that sure that they should be finding Dark Kaia right now, considering the spear they promised her is long destroyed, but he also knows that Claire needs to put the Kaia situation to bed, and she'll do whatever she can for that.
Sam grins, his entire face lighting up with pride. Together with Rowena and Eileen, Sam kneels back down, lighting a fire, and slowly unscrews the vial of Michael’s blood, dropping it into the cauldron. A thick, black smoke arises. Dean wrinkles his nose, watching as Sam drops in Adam’s bone. The smoke turns white. Sam picks up the vial of Cas’s grace, a flicker of hesitation crosses over his face, and he looks up at Cas, the lines in his forehead drawn together.
Nobody says anything for a long time until Billie stands over him.  “Now, you live your life, grow old and alone, and you’ll die — and when you die, I’ll come to collect you.” Her voice is icy cold and Dean feels a sense of vindication when the fear flickers all over Chuck’s face.
Cas smiles at him softly. “You might never believe me, Dean, but the things I’ve shared with you are far more important to me than anything else.”
“Dean, you’ve been crying,” Cas deadpans, but Dean can see that his eyes are a misty too, so he’s not the only soft one here.
Sam rolls his eyes, probably agitated that Dean didn’t listen to his research, but Cas just looks at him fondly, the corners of his mouth curving up into a small smile; he doesn’t say anything though, and it’s Sam who breaks the silence between them.
Sam lets out a heavy sigh, and Dean can feel him standing up. He doesn’t open his eyes when he hears Sam’s heavy steps walk away from the bed. “You really should get out of the bunker more.”
When Dean wakes up, he realizes that the whiskey bottle is gone. He also realizes the one he keeps hidden in his wardrobe is gone as well. It’s a miracle that he’s gone this long without realizing how out of his depth he is because the signs are all around him. A glance at his phone tells him that it’s a quarter after ten. He can smell the coffee as he walks down the hall towards the kitchen. As always, Cas is sitting at the table, newspaper open in front of him. Today, though, he also has his laptop.
“Yeah, you don’t have a choice with that, buddy,” Dean says, trying to keep his voice stern, but it inevitably comes off as fond. To Sam, he says, “We’ll be fine.”
Dean's shoulders tremble, and he lets out a shaky sigh. "Okay. That’s — that’s okay.” He’s fine, really.
“Uh, fine,” Cas says, voice strained. He takes off his trench coat and suit jacket and drops them on the chair. He leans against the desk and crosses his arms across his chest. He meets Dean’s eyes when he says, “The usual. We killed the monster and saved the girl.”
“I’m here,” Dean murmurs. He leans forward to kiss the nape of Cas’s neck, and Cas leans back against him. When he doesn’t say anything, but doesn’t fall back asleep either, Dean ventures ahead. “What was it this time?”
Dean feels his face warm, and wonders if he should argue it, but he finds that he really can’t. He’s gone soft, it’s almost a fact of his life. So, he doesn’t argue it; instead, he shrugs, smiling. “There are worse things to be than soft.” He tilts his head towards Sam. “Dad would probably be rolling in his grave right now, if he had one.”
