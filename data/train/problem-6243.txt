“Are you, you know?  Still seeing things?”  Bucky holds his friend’s upper arm as the blonde turns his head to watch Tony step up to the window and look down.  Steve sighs, turning back to Bucky’s crinkled expression and trying gaze.
“HYDRA has evolved over the years while staying in secrecy.  We strive to lead humanity down the necessary path for survival.  Freedom for all comes at the cost of destruction and death, and HYDRA will take that danger away from the people to save what little is left of this world.”
“So not to change the subject at all, but do you have any plans for today?” He plucks a strip of bacon from his plate and bites it.
“You don’t have to make up for what Loki did to you,” Steve said and wondered if he was only practicing for when he would eventually find Bucky.
It didn’t feel like a miracle; it felt like a betrayal. He had promised to help Bucky through his ordeal and all that happened had been a fissure in their reality, in their relationship, in the very identity of who they were to one another. Bucky had promised when Steve was a thin and hopeless omega that if he’d been an alpha they would pair, they would bond. But he couldn’t – he wasn’t able to do it. He couldn’t knot Steve, and all that happened had been Bucky’s utter destruction.
“You’re not really going to – you know – knot him now?” Pep asks. As a beta she’s always been a curious one. Of course most betas wonder what goes on between an alpha and an omega. That’s clear; otherwise the Viz-nets wouldn’t be so overloaded with their reality experiences for betas. He’s not surprised by her question.
“Who said it was really a lion?” Jarvis grinned at him. He got to his feet, a little slower than he did as a younger man. “When you’re done packing, I’ll bring the boxes to the storage closet.” He walked out of the room without further explanation.
Tony grabs his hands and brings them away from his face. “Hey now. This isn’t going to be easy. Like you said, you were a lion for most of your life.”
“I was in my rebellious phase.” There’s no wind to speak of and the snow is perfectly white, silent, and overwhelmingly bright.
When Fury marched into the laboratory with Natasha on his heels, the scientists cowered but Steve only perked up and smiled. Granted it, he admitted it wasn’t a full smile, maybe just a grin. Or a half a grin.
“Did you hear what’s going on? What he’s up to?” Bucky says and shoves Steve back into the booth. He pushes into the bench across from Natasha, squishing Steve into the corner.
“You have to understand,” Clint said. His voice hushed in the dim light. “I had no other choice. They have my family.”
“What do you have?” Tony asked. He was taking college level chemistry even though he was still in high school.
Tony licks his lips. “Just the people you were hiding out with in Wakanda, Cho and her people. Me, that’s it.” He fists his one hand. “Ross thinks I’m in Wakanda as a Tech exchange ambassador kind of thing.”
Before Tony addresses Luke (who, by the expression on his face, instantly recognizes the prince), Steve says, “Luke, I’d like you to meet someone special and someone who needs a lot of privacy but at the same time would like to be treated like a person rather than a title.”
“What is it?” Steve pins his hands over his ears. The din of sound blasts at him and he bends over about to vomit again.
“Yes, I have.” Tony shrugged and picked grains of sleep out of his eyes. “I didn’t find anything that made any sense. But I’m sure he had a hand in it. My father knew Ross. They worked together at V-Corps for years. Howard was a god damned ass when it came to vampires. Ross and Howard worked together on this, I know it.” He shook his head. “There has to be something.”
He spins on his heel, suddenly angry and defiant all at once. “I’m fine. You can’t make this easier or nicer for me, Bucky. Running away to play games at the Rails isn’t going to help me. I can handle Sir Stark, I don’t have a proble-.”
“Wha-what?” How could she have heard that? “No, Pepper, that’s not what happened. I’m pissed at him. He’s a pain in the ass.”
“Let’s just say I had an awakening,” Tony says and tries not to think about Steve being garroted and raped. It hurts so much to think about the look on his face as he collapsed into the bed, worried that Tony would expect him to put out. But that look and all the vulnerability disappeared when Bucky happened.
Tony stands there in stunned silence. He realizes he’s standing there with his mouth agape. He shuts his jaw with a jarring snap.
“Okay,” he accepts it, but something feels charged between them as if a universe of possibilities is laid out and they’ve only begun to touch the surface. After a contemplative moment, he asks, “When’s the meeting?”
“Eat, and I’ll explain,” Stark says as he stabs the bacon with his fork. It’s silverware, sparkling and nothing like anything Steve’s touched before, the weight of it in his hands is nice.
Steve grasped Tony’s shoulders and brought him down for another kiss, disregarding his fangs, letting the fangs scrape against his lips, his tongue. It sent shivers of excitement and need through Tony. He lifted off of Steve slightly and then sat back again, breaking the kiss, the taste of blood. Steve grappled for him, but Tony stopped him, forcing his hands away, gripping his wrists and keeping them hostage against his sides.
He turns off the big screen and goes to the large sliding glass doors to the deck. Reading people is like predicting the weather. Nice one minute, a blizzard the next. Gusts torture the trees outside and bend them to its will. He thinks of Steve’s reaction. Nothing can bend Captain America to its will, but maybe a fictional story can twist him a little.
“That’s a diversion. I refuse to be off put by a diversion!” He jumps up, dusts his hands off, and when Steve doesn’t run for the hills, he sidles onto the arm of the recliner. “Kiss me, you big muscle bound man.”
He needs to never drink again. Steve shifts in his seat as everyone around the table stares at him like a thousand needles piercing his skin. “I’m sorry, Tony. I drank too much.”
Tony studies him, and that dark glance pools all his longings and wants down deep in Steve so that he wants to throw away his duties, his responsibilities and stay here. Steve steadies his need, and peers over to the mountains as Tony says, “Maybe you’ll need my assistance.”
"I'm not doing this without you," Tony says because he recognizes the look of resignation, the look of surrender in Steve's eyes.
Steve fumbles around and Tony sees that same lost look in his eyes again, but he manages to retrieve the keys from his pocket. Tony grabs them and then orders Steve into the car. He looks like he’s about the protest, but Tony glares at him and cannot believe it actually works to get the man into the car. Steve settles next to him and that’s when Tony notices it for the first time – he’s trembling. Not overtly but with small quakes as he tries to put on his seatbelt. Tony doesn’t have time to help him but revs the car into drive and then steers it close to the motorcycle. He tosses the keys out the window and hopes to god that Steve has his phone.
“Me too.” The prince reaches a counter that’s in a nook near the wall. He rounds it and leans down to pull out a bottle of wine and two glasses. “Do you think you could watch some vids and eat while I work for a bit? I don’t really partake so this isn’t true alcohol.”
“Now you’re just playing with me,” Tony replied. He’d finished his coffee and sidled closer to the fire. “He can’t leave us here for that long.”
He’s determined now. That’s what’s going to happen. But then the Avengers’ alarm rings and all hell breaks loose – literally.
“What are you going to have?” Tony touches the rim of the plate with his thumb, getting an idea for the circumference. The wrap is warm and the avocado just the right amount of spicy.
“What did you think was going on Tony? When you heard my thoughts? Did you even consider-.” It’s hard to believe that Tony dismissed such a vital piece of information. How could he? Why would he? What did he hear? “What did you hear?”
He’d been getting ready to take off when she announced it. Stopping, he turned around and let the face plate lift. “You wouldn’t do that. You know I’m trying to do good, Pepper. Ever since, I’ve been trying to do good.”
“All of them, Tony, all of them. One subject. Just one subject,” Pepper said, and her hands trembled as she tapped on the console.
“I never really understood that old Hydra adage, but now I do. I get it. You have to cleanse out all the poison not just the figureheads. I’m not sure what’s going on in the US, but it isn’t safe for us. Not for vampires, mates, Divini. No one can stay there.”
“He’s a victim,” Steve replied. “We need to find him. Get resources together and search for him.” The idea that Bucky, loosed from his Hydra bindings but at the same time captured by the soul pack, might react badly to the muddled minds in his head only served to increase Steve’s fear. Of all of them, Bucky needed direction and assistance. How would someone so lost grapple with the ties of the soul pack? The last time he’d seen Bucky, the beat of his soul resonating with Steve’s only served to drive him away. As Bucky left him by the river, the glint of metal and the bleed of the shine of it in Steve’s eyes blinded him. But then again, Bucky hadn’t been the only one to save him that day. A comforting shadow had appeared and  brought him, carried him to the hospital. He’d flown? The wind gently hitting his face and the quiet words spoken to him as they flew to safety came back to him. But how? He wasn’t sure because the memory blurred out.
“A whole lot more,” Bruce said and continued to chop away at the vegetables with such vigor Steve had to wonder what they’d ever done to him.
“We all have our burdens here,” Tony says. “It took Frigga ten years to free me. Natasha only two, because you know a spy doesn’t really trust anyone. Her nature and all.”
“A concoction from Doctor Banner. Something he would like you to drink twice a day,” Jarvis says and offers Tony a cookie on a plate.
He nods. “You’ve done it, Tony. You really have. The next steps are inconsequential. You’ve done it.”
“Yes and the rules are that an alpha should be able to bring his omega warrior into theater. A warrior is the best defense, the best protection,” Steve said.
Steve whispers something and, to Tony, it seems like he can’t look up and meet his gaze. “It means all my memories are false, fake. They’re his memories. The other Steve.”
“It’ll help. Don’t you worry about it, sweet one.” Steve smiles down at Tony as his cheeks color with the endearment. After a few minutes as Steve hums a song, he feels the air around them cooling and Tony’s erection softens a bit. He notices the prince’s lower belly relax and he lightly pets Tony. “There you go. See let’s start the prep now. You gonna be good fer me?”
Tony shook his head. “Didn’t see any type of monitoring devices when I searched the cabin.” He frowned in thought. “But then again, I don’t know how magic monitors things.”
“So what does it mean?” Steve said and moved to get out of the bed that seemed to double as an exam table. Tony stopped him but Shuri assured them it was fine. “You said the Divini are vampire’s next step, not a human’s?”
A sound of lust escapes Steve’s lips that signifies absolute pure, unadulterated desire. He wants this vow between them, he needs it as much as Tony does. It locks them together. A simple tap on the table in some future meeting and Tony knows, knows in the spaces within his heart that Steve will immediately go here to this moment and they will live in a secret world – where they’ve built this relationship over the last few days in a cabin in the woods. Their fever for one another – their yearning had been low, almost denied until these last days. And now – now they have this pact between them.
The ache of the betrayal and his world transforming in seconds overwhelmed the pains he suffered from the fall. He ran to the stairwell, managing to avoid any of the agents as the call for his apprehension blared out from the speakers embedded in the walls of the building. He rushed down the stairs, keeping his shield tightly gripped in his hands. He had to focus his mind, because it swung wildly to Tony and his fate. Was he all right? How could Steve get in touch with him? Had someone hurt him? Did he listen to Natasha and scatter to the wind? Would he be at the safe house where they’d planned to meet? His only thought was of Tony – getting to him – getting him safe. As his human mate, Steve felt the constant pull right under his breastbone to gravitate to Tony, to protect him, to care for him..
“Don’t think a wheelchair will make it down the stairs. I’m fine, Tony.” He means it to comfort but it only irritates Tony who reaches up and pulls open Steve’s collared shirt.
“No need.” Tony gestures for Steve to leave, and thankfully, the man takes the hint and folds up his portfolio. He thanks Tony for the opportunity and lets himself out of the office. After a full minute, Pepper joins him from the side room of the large office in the Tower.  “Did you watch?”
“Sure, you are,” Tony says and jostles him on the shoulder. “You might have a nearly imperceptible bump now from a certain angle, but otherwise I think it’s a pretty good job.” He assesses Steve for a few more minutes, his hands probing Steve’s face, touching his jaw line. Steve can almost imagine something else.
“I wear the vest under the armor, Stevie-boy. Don’t worry about it,” Tony said with a smile. “Let’s go Cap.”
Tony stops and Steve stumbles into him, not realizing they arrived at their destination. In front of him stands a massive gate, towering several meters over his head. Steve’s never been to this part of the station before; he wasn’t joking when he told Tony there are parts of the station, he isn’t welcome as a sex worker. This area is called Blossom Trail Row. All the residences look like something out of a fairy tale, almost like townhouses of days past on Earth. Of course, it’s just a façade as are the fake trees lining the streets with their pink flowers shimmering in the false wind. Ventilation shafts and fans provide the effect.
Sitting up, Steve blinks away the last of sleep and rubs at his eyes. He wonders if he shouldn’t have stayed in the prince’s bed, after all they assigned him his own quarters on the ship. But Tony had told him to stay and seemed quieted and comforted by Steve’s presence in the bed. It is part of his assignment to ensure his client is happy, soothed, and contented – at least in Steve’s mind anyhow. It doesn’t matter that spooning with the prince might play into all of his childhood fantasies of finding a hero to whisk him out of the Brooklyn settlement to the far reaches. Every child of the Beyond Regions dreamed the same fairy tales. Steve needs to balance out his expectations and get his head back in the game.
He picks through his clothes, which are few and finds his best shirt. It’s cambric with insets and a button down. It is also his only colored shirt; it’s a soft blue hue and he knows it reflects his eye color nicely. He spends time with the hot iron that he’s warmed on the pot belly stove in the main office of the jail. He doesn’t often iron his clothes or care much about what he’s wearing, but tonight is different.
Except he knew that being Beloved bestowed nothing of the sort on him. Sure, Tony should have stayed at Steve’s bedside after the whole blowing up SHIELD thing, but he couldn’t. There was no way in hell that he could stand there and face the idea of being Steve Rogers’ Beloved. After he got back to New York, Tony spent hours reading about it, learning it. He even visited that weird doctor who liked to call himself the Sorcerer Supreme (and wasn’t that the most obnoxious moniker he’d ever heard in his life). Beloved rang with a special closeness that he ran from because of his inability to offer more of himself. Pepper had been right, he used the armor as a cocoon. He shoved the reality of what Beloved meant out of his brain and focused on how he defined himself.  Yet, it slipped into his thoughts uninvited – what would it mean to be Steve’s Beloved. For all time. The bond was unbreakable and thus, Tony would always have someone. Someone close, someone to turn to. The idea fascinated and thrilled and terrified all at once.
“I hope you know what you’re doing. Captain Rogers might be able to handle the increased stress on his heart, but Stark isn’t.  If he hasn’t told you, then I will and damned confidentiality. He has heart damage that puts him at higher risk.” Her argument supports her poignant silent plea.
Pietro is the easiest to find. He’s out on the running path stretching and getting ready for an afternoon jog. Steve corrals him and sends him into the house. It takes another half hour before he finds both Vision and Wanda. He never wants to think about how he found them again. He had no idea. He doesn’t need that picture in his brain, but now he can’t unsee it. Wanda can’t stop giggling at his obvious embarrassment and Vision stays stone cold froze in his reaction of being caught in his birthday suit in the pantry.
Tony splays out his arms and he sends a shockwave of hurt through his ribcage, but he ignores it. “Maybe you like to walk around with your dick out, but some of us -
The man doesn’t answer immediately. He only shrugs and points to the side panel of the cell. Tony steps back and glances at the screen. A list of the omega’s statistics scrolls as well as his major characteristics, his test levels, his strengths and his weaknesses. It also lists that the termination will occur in three days.
Once finished he joined Natasha at the side of the gurney. Her brows furrowed as she checked Steve’s pulse point. “He’s weak. Very weak.”
“Well, neither do blind guys, but hell I’ve always been a trendsetter.” He winks at Steve as he fastens the helmet. “Lead the way. By the way this isn’t a tricked out helmet, just to let you know. I’m at your mercy, Rogers.”
He kisses Tony’s cheek. “It makes me happy to take care of you Tony. It’s part of who I am. Even as a tiny sickly kid, I always stood up for others and took care of others.”
He snickers but demolishes another group of terrorists as he briefly gets stuck in a recess of the tunnel. Finally he clears it and trudges his way toward the opening, only to find a stacks of his own weapons loaded in the front of the tunnel and to the back, a crumpled form.
“We know that they’re being coerced. That Hydra acted as SHIELD, and that they are now virtual prisoners of this rogue Hydra cell,” Steve said and tossed the dish towel to the counter. “Bucky is there to help them, I’m sure of it. Don’t tell me you don’t feel his need to do something.”
“Small town a bit southwest of here, friend of mine’s lives there. He’s a deputy.” He eyes the rest of the room. “Is it gonna be a problem for me to bring Sam here?”
“You are looking for escape, and I want to tell you that you are fooling yourself if you think you will find it,” he says and he lightly touches his hand to Steve’s. “You are a good man and it is not a good idea to be lost as you are.”
Steve willingly goes with Tony all the while his mind leaping off cliffs as he tries to reconcile the man in front of him and the Iron Man he’s heard about all these years. As they walk under a trellis laden with purple flowers, even Steve ducks to avoid the heady blossoms. It surprises him that his allergies haven’t taken flight. He’d always been prone to the worst attacks when Brooklyn went through it’s rare growing season. A torrential rain always led to a riot of growth. The ashy ground transformed to lush vegetation and foliage if only for a few sparse weeks a year. Unfortunately for Steve it always meant he couldn’t breathe for that month.
The omega licks his lips as if he wants to tell a lie, as if he could. The scent of his bonding gland warms the air and Tony nearly feels the struggle within the omega vibrate through the air.
Blu gets up and heads down the hillside, turn back every now and again to ensure that Tony’s following him. Blu hesitates as he finds his way down the path, choosing a slightly longer but easier trek. As Blu trots away from their tree and toward the right, Tony brings up the rear. With no idea where the closest source of water might be, he’s at the lion’s mercy. He trusts Blu. After a full day and some shadowy times in the cave, Tony implicitly trusts the cat.
“Sir, it seems there’s some chatter about a lion,” JARVIS says. His voice is normal, routine, but Tony may detect a bit of compassion or worry – or it might just be his subconscious since he’s been working non-stop for hours with little more than blueberries, almonds, and coffee.
“Yeah, but I like the team too. Don’t get me wrong, I love my family. But I want to do good. It’s part of who I am. Laura’s great because she accepts that,” Clint said as he flipped over the eggs in the frying pan. “Plus, I have a lot to make up for because of Loki.”
“No. Not anymore. The war has been going on for nearly a decade. I can’t remember the last time I went home.”
Tony pats his phone. “I’ll get right on it. Also, have you seen Steve Rogers? My assistant? He came with me from Canada and I need him.”
“I do. I loved being with you.” Even as the words tumbled out of his mouth he realized what he’d said.
Natasha had looked over to Tony who – at the time – had been sitting outside in the garden of one of the coven’s safe houses. It was twilight and the jasmine fragrance settled in the humid air. When he glimpsed Tony, the heady perfume only intensified the feelings blossoming in his chest. “He’s a young vampire. Too young to be mated. We don’t want to admit it to humans, but vampires at his age long to test the boundaries. Draining someone dry is a boundary we all have to learn not to cross and sometimes you have to learn it by doing it once. By feeling how it is to stop a heart and fuck to it. It kills parts of you.”
Steve stands, exhales loudly, and then wipes away the melted snow that’s dripping from his hair. “I’m actually pretty fine with the cold. I always wanted to be able to go out in the cold as a kid but couldn’t ‘cause I was so sickly. But people think I hate the cold because of the crash. I honestly don’t remember much of the crash. Last thing I remember is talking to Peggy. That’s all.”
Thor released an unneeded breath. “She saved me from my brother. I have always had a soft spot for him. I always allowed him much when I shouldn’t have. She recognized it and saved me, saved my mate. She will do anything for the coven including the human mates. Don’t let her hard edges fool you. She will protect your Steven if it is necessary.”
Later, he sits on the alpha’s lap, the knot still in him as he rocks against the man trying to get some friction. The alpha kisses his neck but leaves his mouth hungry and alone. It is what Steve requested. He moans as he works the man, bringing him to climax again and again. He’s flooded with come. He stinks of it. But the more primal part of him glories in it. Part of him wants to beg for the bond, though he knows they are not made to bond. He cannot feel it. He still wonders if he’s capable of it anymore. Maybe he’s just wrong now. Maybe part of him is just that little skinny omega with no hope for the future. The thought just raises the temperature of his blood until he’s burning with desire and rage.
“I have,” Steve says but doesn’t look up from the data he has streaming on his pad as he compares it to the information on his desk console.
Steve wraps Tony in his embrace. It’s only been two months. How can he be in love in two months? Steve tenderly kisses him and Tony murmurs, “I think I’m falling in love.” It’s a bold move, but tonight is the night for bold moves.
Immediately when he leaves his room, Tony smells the distinct aroma of breakfast. Once again, Steve beat him to the kitchen and has breakfast started. Today it’s stacks of pancakes, cut up fruit, and more bacon. The man is a bacon fiend.
Rumlow winks. “I think you don’t, at least not to the prince.” He peels back Steve’s collar. “Nice bruise you got there right on your pulse point.” He snickers. “What kind of personal assistant did you say again?”
Tony separates them and then Steve knows he’s made a mistake. Tony loved Pepper – and while Pepper and Morgan live on it is with them Tony will spend eternity. He spins around and faces away from Steve. Then in an exaggerated gesture, Tony throws his hands in the air and confronts Steve. His red colored eyes accentuate the anger marring his features.
Steve forgets to hold back his strength as he lifts Tony against the cracked wood, driving splinters through the back of his shirt.  He ignores Tony’s whimpers as he presses forward, dropping their jeans and rubbing their cocks together with a tight grip.
Tony no longer left the bed unless he was forced to do so. He ignored most of captor’s comments and only ate when necessary. Steve resisted the urge to knock some sense into his house guest as Tony grew more indifferent by the day.
Steve is sitting in the center of workshop’s ragged couch, the bulk of his body taking up nearly the entire surface of faded vinyl.  Tony looks at him briefly over his shoulder before he returns to fidgeting with the arc reactor in his hands.
“Okay--what the fuck.  Whoever invented bras should be burned alive.  The clasps are in the back? How can you even bend your arms that far?  Did I not get that ability with this bullshit gender-bender?”
His friendly brown eyes feel like bullets in Steve's gut.  He takes Tony's hand, weaving their fingers together and bringing the soft skin to his lips.
“Mr. Stark!  Are you okay?”  Tony lets himself be lead to the couch and sat down, stressing teen attached at his hip.
“He’s not going to be an Avenger!  You made sure of that when you gathered the whole team and left!”  Tony gestures with his arms to reference the empty space around him.
The next year is a haze of memories.  Tony spends most nights wrapped up in Steve’s arms, helping the tired nomad get some much needed rest.  The light touches and brief kisses seem to keep Steve from falling apart. After one terrible week spent scrambling across Europe and watching a town of refugees go up in flames from too far away, the supersoldier goes off the hinge.  Once they are alone in an abandoned barn with the rest of the team pressing ahead for clean-up, Steve pushes Tony up against a stall and bites into his neck.
Tony pulls up a suit schematic on the holoscreen as he scoots his chair under the workbench just as Steve enters, picking up the wrench on the floor as he passes the bots.
“Shall we continue?  We were informed your party needed you return to your vessel by midday for departure.”
Tony chances a look over at Steve.  The blonde has returned to the couch and is leaning his temple against his palm, nails driving into his skull.  Peter looks worried, placing a hand on the supersoldier’s back that Steve cannot feel. Tony forces himself to step closer and kneel next to the pair, keeping his hand from shaking as he strokes Steve’s jawline.
“I'm okay, Pep. No need to worry.  Are you alright?” Tony looked over her slightly wrinkled pant suit and splotchy makeup.
“No.  While I trust Sam’s abilities, Tony can be crafty and it may require some extra strength to keep him in check.  Buck, I won’t rest easy if you’re not here making sure he’s safe. If he manages to escape, he will die.  Or worse.”
Tony feels his fingers falter.  He screws his face into a smile and holds it there until Steve sees.
Hope you liked!  Let me know if it is worth continuing.  Poor Tony.  I do like evil Steve Rogers.  His bitch ass can do some damage.  ;)
“I brought you a couple of other bras to try if that new one doesn't fit.  Both are smaller than Wanda's, so try her's on first and go from there.  If we can’t determine how to revert this by end of day, we'll get you a better fit.” She placed the clothes he was holding along with her additional contribution on the sink counter before reeling him around to face her.
“More like bathed in it.  Armor is covered, Cap. Do you know what it is?  Jarvis, see if you can identify this awful crap.”
“What is the endgame here?  You know I will never cooperate with HYDRA and you won't be able to shelter me here indefinitely.  My immunity will be lifted, then I will be eliminated as a risk to the cause.” Tony moved slowly to touch Steve arm. The supersoldier slapped the lever down to stop the flow of water and turned.
Steve makes them come together, using their seed to continue pumping them as he rehardens.  Tony tries to scramble away once the sensation becomes overwhelming. He begs Steve to let him go as he feels a finger at his entrance.  He folds over when the single digit pushes into him, feeling like fire as he starts to rip.
“I believe the director phrased his proposal as more of a dare at the time. And then your personal feelings for Captain Rogers prolonged your service.”
“He is trying to contact them now.  Tony?” He looked up at his name and met the blue eyes next to him.
“He’s not allowed to leave Stark Tower without Steve accompanying him.  He must wear destabilizers at all times to minimize his powers. Steve drove R&D off from weekly mutation trials after their testing gave him a seizure. He told me he planned to bring the kid here when things are more settled.”
Tony forced a smile.  He dropped his phone in his pocket and reached for his watch, but Steve pulled him out the door before he could grasp the metal band.
“HYDRA would have known about the kid’s abilities even if you’d never come into the picture.  I would even wager he’d be dead by now if you hadn’t taken a personal interest in his well being. Otherwise Steve wouldn’t have stepped in when he did.”
“Any luck?”  Steve is waiting for Tony in the workshop.  He stands up from his tense position on the couch and makes his way over to the smaller man, his writhing fingers awkward at his sides.  Peter takes his seat on the sofa, eyes bright and mouth wide in a grin.
“Damn straight.  I got your favorite.”  He tilts the box so Tony sees the familiar green and red writing.  Tony nearly falls on his face as he charges his friend.
“Sir?  Should I make note of this event in your file?  I worry the results may be skewed going forward.”
“You know you didn’t have to do that.”  Pepper pulls Tony up the stairs to his room and leaves him next to the bed as she reaches for the glass decanter on the dresser.
Tony ignored the screaming in his head and the violent flashes from that familiar video as he rested the side of his head on Barnes’s chest and let the sound of the man’s pulse lull his rattled senses.
Tony looked down at the sound of ripping paper.  He watched the hunched man shred the book cover until the glossy paper was confetti.  When he glanced up at Barnes’s face, Tony's anger faltered. He averted his eyes and blinked several times, giving the man the chance to wipe the wet streaks off his cheeks.
“Boys, back up.”  Natasha pushed Steve and Sam's hovering forms a few feet from the sofa before kneeling next to her friend, using a light touch to close Tony's suit jacket.
Tony discovers the conspiracy within SHIELD.  He refuses to believe his boyfriend would be involved, despite the evidence.
Tony tries to move his head, but the half of his helmet still attached to the armor keeps him still.  Last he remembered he was sitting upright. Now he's facedown with a mouth full of concrete.
“Sir, you need to step out of the SUV,” one of the guards directs Tony – who is still sitting by Steve’s side. Where Natasha went, Steve doesn’t know.
Melanie wasn’t the main librarian who already knew about Tony’s protégé status. Melanie was new, just out of college and still one of the few who talked about free love instead of God being dead. Melanie nodded her head.
“Steve, you gotta admit what’s happening here,” Sam said, and he laid on hand on Steve’s shoulder. “There’s nothing wrong with it. There’s nothing to be ashamed of.”
Leaning Tony offers Steve the soup. He accepts it. “Thank you, Tony. I do appreciate it and you.” Steve stares down at the thick and hearty soup. It is a comfort and exactly what he needs right now. “How’d you know? How’d you know soup would be exactly what I need?”
“I don’t mean to say I wouldn’t pick you,” Steve said. That sounded too straight for Steve but it wasn’t like he understood the lingo today any more than he understood how magic worked. “I don’t mean that. I don’t know.”
When he gets back to the office and his desk, he hears something in the anteroom – the waiting room for people who are visiting him. He touches the frames of his glasses and concentrates on the shadows. The one silhouette is definitely Pepper with her ponytail and absurdly high heeled shoes and the other – the other can’t be anyone but Adonis himself, Steve Rogers. Data streams over the lenses. Data he shouldn’t be gathering like height, weight, shoulder measurements, and waist measurements. Temperature – 99. Steve is running a little hot today. Nerves? Illness? Too hot outside? Tony sighs. He wants Pepper to bring him in, get this over with.
“Here.” Steve cups Tony’s hand and places them in his palm. Steve’s fingers brush against Tony’s palm. He feels the slight writer’s (artist’s) bump on his middle right finger. He’d never noticed it before with the glasses.
"I don't know. I feel loose, as if I'm falling apart. I want to get back to New York." He said it as images of Steve reading to him came to mind. One time Steve had picked up an old paperback and read to Tony when he'd shown up with a migraine. Instead of charging him that time, Steve had taken care of him during the long night. It had been lovely and comforting and sweet. Something Tony cherished.
“We need a strong first vote though,” Steven says. “If you get that, then you can make the case to put together a government and claim the chair. Once you have it, you can keep it.” He checks them out and then adds, “Fury brings the Elders of Shield and the Upper Lanes water resource with him. Natalie brings the Wayfarers and the Outlands. Thor brings Asgard. Tony brings the technology centers and the firepower. With that we should have a powerful coalition.”
It had been Bruce who supplied that information. Decades ago when he worked with Ross, his studies investigated the coagulant to use in emergency cases of hemorrhage. What a boon to doctors and nurses if they could harness it. “He pushed for it. Really wanted to harvest the glands, but it never worked then. You couldn’t preserve the functioning gland, and you had to have it functioning. Hammer must have been using vampires. There’s no other way. He had to harvest the coagulant to discover how to detect it.” Bruce scrubbed hands through his hair.
Steve closes his eyes, forcing himself not to think about, not to want Tony’s bare mouth, his tongue, his teeth along his cock. He tells himself this is good; this is good enough. It is wondrously hot. Tony swallows him, letting the tip of his cock slide along the roof of his mouth and then as he hits the back, the prince swallows again. It sends a pulse of need so greedy and distraught that Steve cries out. Grabbing at the prince’s hair, Steve pumps once, then twice. Tony yanks away and Steve whines his protests.
“Mer Stane scheduled an emergency meeting for you in fifteen minutes. I’m afraid he’s categorized it as high priority.”
The lessons about Omegas start in pre-school and never end. In the Viz-nets and all over any type of entertainment – Omegas are not the same caste. Everyone accepts that now.  Ever since the Uprising of ’43.
Steve only half smiled as the despondency shifted over his face. It disappeared as quickly as it came and he slipped out of Tony’s arms, went to the bottom of the bed and began slowly working his way up Tony's body. His tongue elicited a masterpiece of sensations.
Tony sniffled and tried to catch his breath. He was all of seven years old and already in middle school. His hands shook as he tried to pick up the cookie. “The boys told me about the vampires. How they want to enslave us all. They want humans to be on a cattle ranch but without cattle. The humans will be the cattle.” He trembled and new tears had formed in his eyes. “They said they like to get them young and fatten them up. They put you in stalls and put you in a harness and force feed you until the blood is about to burst out of you.”
When he was thawed from the ice, no one knew he was a sub/omega. Not even SHIELD. When he went to Fury and asked for an alpha it had been a miracle the man’s working eye didn’t pop out of his head at the time. Natasha came to the rescue. She was the one who found Tony for him. He can still recall, the moment that Tony walked into his small room at SHIELD NY office. There he was, arrogant, cool. And Steve wanted to run, but his body told him something different. His body bent to the will of an alpha. Not only an alpha but a dom to Steve’s sub, and on top of that a Prime. Prime Alpha’s were rare – most went mad. Tony was a Prime, and he had it under control.
Tony cuts her off and turns to Steven. “The Asgardians don’t have the castes. No alphas, no betas, no omegas. Nothing. It’s weird.”
When the horses rush down the narrow way, Steve crouches against the rocks as the wind through the cavern hits. Shield nearly hits Steve but he’s able to avoid a direct strike to the spine. It only hits his shoulder, and he huffs in response. Steve wants to get up and calm the horse, but it’s impossible in the small space. Shield nays and leaps downward toward the water – and Steve cringes, hoping his horse doesn’t break a leg as she catapults down the wicked way.
“Yeah, it’s not a good day,” Tony says and flicks off the snow covering his arms and shoulders. “Get up.” He offers a hand.
For a second, Tony thinks he’s gone too far, but then Steve considers his request with a tiny grin. “Remember what you said about some people are better friends? Let’s just say it was something like that.”
“I saw a report on the news, sir.” Steve folded his hands and waited. He wouldn’t offer up any information if he didn’t have to. He needed to assess. When he’d left Tony’s, he’d tried to get in touch with Fury but failed. He had no idea where the Director was.
“What do you call leaving a note and cutting out your gland? What do you call that?” Tony says and his eyes are fierce with anger and tearing with pain. “You tried to kill yourself. You can’t be trusted.”
“You want to know what my Kryptonite is? You really want to know, Stark?” He pushes down into the snow with his hands on either side of Tony’s head. He’s ruining Tony’s angel. He doesn’t wait for Tony’s answer. “It’s you. Always you. I haven’t stop thinking about you, wanting you since that day in the Helicarrier. No, not when we fought because I know that’s the moment you would go to – the moment we figured out together where Loki would strike. I knew we were a match. I could fucking feel what you were going to say, what you were going to do. When you flew that bomb up into the void, my heart split open and I knew for sure if you didn’t come back that I wouldn’t stay, that I would do everything in my power to leave and disappear. It’s always been you, Tony. Always.”
When he appeared at Steve’s bedroom door, hands in pockets and a tight smile on his face, Steve returned the smile. “Hey. You ready?”
Steve hates it, loathes having to do this to Bucky, because he knows what Bucky has endured at the hands of a mad man who didn’t even have the blessings of the Confederacy for his actions.  Bucky hisses at him, deranged and out of his mind as they yank his mouth open and pour the tincture of liquid down his throat. He coughs and gags but isn’t able to spit it up despite trying. With Steve holding his jaw shut and Bruce pinching his nostrils closed he has no other choice.
“Sorry, Stevie.  I won’t risk another Winter Soldier rampage.  You still have your gang of rouge Avengers to look after your sorry ass.”
“Switch to silent mode, J.  Start recording and be ready to send Fury everything if things turn ugly.  Have the Mark LIX on standby.”
“No, Tony.  You’ve been sulking for too long.  You need to snap out of this haze you’re in and come back to reality and
Hope you enjoyed.  :)  Would love your opinion / comments / criticisms / etc.  I tend to hate the shit I write (and use it more as an outlet before I attempt other fiction), so any sort of feedback is welcome.  Also, I had to stop and think before I had Sam defend HYDRA.  Like, what is the purpose of that organization besides Nazis?  I came up with the whole "people suck and granting everyone freedom will lead to our demise".  But also Nazis.
“Come on, Cap.  Your sudden affection toward me is blindingly obvious.  I do remember you wanted to chat when I got back to the compound.  With everything falling apart with Pep, it's not unreasonable that I would make you aware of my long lived harboring crush.”
“Will you work with me to fix these documents?  Sounds like Barnes will be safe in Wakanda. We can leave him here and go back to the States.  Save the team and correct this mayhem.”
Peter shares his smile.  Steve tries to reciprocates, but his face is wet and his lips are trembling.  He leans forward and kisses Tony on the cheek.
“But it’s okay.  You’re not alone now.  I always worried, you know.”  Tony looks up as his door opens.  Steve is watching him with his sad eyes again, saying words that Tony can’t hear.  He clears his face of tears, lets go of Peter’s hand and stands, failing to hold his body still.
“I’m here, Steve.  I’m won’t leave you.  You’re forgiven. Can we please--pretend this never happened?  It was a bad day. You stopped before it went too far.”
Lifting his arm, Tony smells himself, nose wrinkling.  He hears Dum-E chirp before he wheels over, splashing some green sludge onto his creator’s lap.
“We could really use an assist, Shellhead. Your hubby and Buck may need a lift out of this mess.” Natasha’s voice crackles over the comms just as a shrill screech fills his ears.
“Nat, I’ll figure it out.  How hard can it be? You’re gearing this up to be a challenge.  Have you not heard that I am Iron Man?”
“You know I’ll never call you, right?  Even when I’ll need you, I won’t make that call.  If you believe nothing else, believe that I want to call.  If you call me, I’ll tell you--”
, I am capoosh.”  Steve nods as he looks back at his teammate.  Tony feels heat creep up to his chest.
“Pep, love of my life, why wouldn’t I want this?  You’re gorgeous, famous, brilliant--let’s not forget CEO of my favorite company.  Did I mention gorgeous? Besides, Rhodey-bear already turned me down, so you’re my next best bet.”  He expects the elbow he gets to his gut, and he fakes the hurt rather than letting the real stuff show.
ALRIGHT!  So I did decide to continue this.  I will be posting chapters as I write them.  I expect to get another one out this coming weekend.  Parts of June may be spotty due to the enormous pile of crap I need to do.
Before they get far into the bunker, a Doctor Strange greets them.  This sorcerer is a few decades older than the last man Tony met, and the Eye of Agamotto glows a faint emerald against his chest.
Peter tries to pull him up, but he stays down.  When he looks back up again, he’s sitting on the Quinjet across from a crestfallen Steve Rogers. Despite his condition, Barnes is in the cockpit as Siberia disappears beneath them.  Tony shrivels away from the blonde when Steve comes to sit next to him, a heavy hand landing on his knee. They sit still, Steve keeping a light grip on his leg.
Tony snarls but continues forward, first running into Strange’s floating cloak and then calling out his nanobots and nearly vaporizing the kid taking shelter in one of the higher levels of the main deck, still wearing his new gold-highlighted suit.
“Here.  My ma used to make these all of the time.  She always said the secret ingredient was more butter.”  Tony chuckles lightly as he turns back to the stove. Steve stands next to him as he finishes cooking, ready with a plate when he’s dishing out the first basket.
“Of course I had to, Mrs. Stark.  Now we never have to change the name of the company.  Win-win. Plus, you’re fantastic.”
“The price of your amnesty included shared control over your assets to assure your compliance and to prevent you from becoming a hazard.”
Rather than trying to move Steve’s hand, Tony turns and pulls open the drawer on the other side of his workbench and grabs another screwdriver (close enough).  He doesn’t bother shutting the drawer as he starts to work on his watch.
“W-what do you mean?”  Steve moans, pulsing against Tony’s hollowed cheek.  The kneeling man works on his own pants while sticking a pair of fingers in his mouth along with Steve’s dick, making the other whine.  Once slick with precum and spit, Tony pushes the first digit into his entrance. He manages to not choke as Steve starts to rock in his mouth, hand tangled in his brown locks and pulling.
His mouth feels like cold cotton.  He remembers eating a handful of snow that fell through the broken bunker roof about a day ago. He does that again and prefers the flavor of dirt to the stale puke still on his tongue.
Tony steps closer to Stark and leans forward, voice down to a whisper as his eyes fall to the floor.
“No point, Stark.  Dinner is in twenty.  Either you come out and join us on your open terms or James will force feed you spaghetti and sausage.  As suggestive as that sounds, I feel like you won't enjoy that experience.”
our collective decision to end weapon manufacturing to prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands. Exhibit A.  And the Iron Legion is not equipped for combat.”
Little Bucky & Tony bonding here.  I may have fallen into some WinterIron in the last couple of months.  Stony is still my one true love. <3
“Doesn't Sam owe you one?  Make him take your mission so we can go have some cake on the beach.”  Tony waggled his eyebrows, hoping the smirk on his face covered his unease.  The lack of reaction from Steve made his stomach roll.
“Oh god, Tony. I thought the worst. When I tried and couldn't get ahold of you, I called Steve and Natasha but neither of them responded.” Pepper kept her damp face in the crook of his neck as she trembled. Tony noticed the heat in Rogers's stare and his tight stance as he watched them. He pulled Pepper back, pivoting her around and away from Steve.
couldn’t call you even if I still had that ridiculous paperweight.  So, since you can’t stick with your usual mantra, how about you crawl back to whatever deluded part of my mind still has me hallucinating that you ever gave a shit.”
“I know this is hard for you.  I think you need to hear this. You do know this wasn’t your fault, right?”
“Uh huh. How about you focus on finding some luck for the old man instead.  Probably would be a better way for Cap to relieve all that tension he keeps stuffed in his shoulders. Did you know that he broke three more of my reinforced punching bags last week?  Maybe I should synthesize more vibranium and just make him a damn wall to wreck into.”
“Then what's your deal now?  You seem to regret your past actions, and yet here you are walking around with all of the other HYDRA scumbags.  Did you decide compliance was better than compulsion?”
“Hopefully.  But we need to stay together if we're to accomplish that.  Please. Tell him the truth. We need to hear it from you.” Rogers keeps his grip as he glances over to the nearly hyperventilating genius falling against his future self.  Steve seems practiced as he drops down to eye level with Stark, speaking to him in soft words as he helps the man take deep breaths in sync with his own.
“Mostly correct.  If the goo was on you earlier when you first got hit, then you have closer to ten minutes.  And based on the previous report, they both had to be...penetrated.”
“If he gets his hands on all six infinity stones, fifty percent of the population of every planet in this galaxy will be randomly selected and wiped from existence.” Tony stops himself from reaching for Rogers's familiar fingers to help his own from trembling. He watches as Cap steadies his forearm, grip tense and hesitant before he drops his hand down to Tony's and squeezes.
“Compared to the New York death site?  Yeah, Stark; I'm pretty sure your situation, husband of HYDRA's head general, is a bit nicer than the concentration camps being built across the country.  Most men with your political stance and superhero status are either dead, dying, or complying, hoping their immoral actions will allow their friends and families to survive.  And here you are, bitching how horrible your life is because Steve took a shine to you and bargained for your safety so you wouldn't be sent to die or be made a puppet of HYDRA.”
They stay like that until Sam walks in, sweating in his running gear.  He looks over to the pan of bread and eggs in the sink before making his way to the fridge.
“Seriously, Sam?  You take orders from an organization built to breed prejudice?  Are you stupid or do you just have zero preservation skills?”
) chest, taking steady breaths in time with the other’s quickening heartbeat.  His hands are released and he is pulled further into the embrace.
“Hey, jackass.  Pot, kettle. Actually take those anti-anxiety pills you've been dropping down the toilet the last three weeks.  And fix those damn documents so Ross can't con you into making missiles again. Also, free your fucking team. Go over Ross’s head. Work with T’Challa. And try to
He regretted his words when he looked up at the other man. Tony gaze was wide and unfocused as he gripped the bedspread between his strained, pale fingers.  He bent his back forward until his head hit his covered thighs.
“Not currently.  Just finished, actually.  Maybe the official report didn't specify positioning or an actual timeframe.  Clint said he'd give max twenty minutes before he interupted.  We should shave the rest of your face before the team gets here.”
“Yeah, I'm not making you do anything you don’t want to do, Rogers.” Tony rubbed his swollen cheek. His eyes darted around the cabin until they landed on the weapons locker.  As he made to stand, Steve took the seat next to Tony and pulled him over and pressed him into his lap.
Tony watches his old teammates move around the world, never staying in the same place longer than a month.  They sometimes stick together or disperse, depending on their surroundings. Five months into their traveling routine, they each get their own place in the small country of Liechtenstein.  Steve can barely fit on the twin mattress fitted into the corner of the condemned flat. Most nights he stays awake, filling up pages of a small notebook he carries with him. Tony does his best to keep his distance, which generally works in his favor.
Disclaimer:  A small part of me wishes I could help in the creation of the cannon of MCU, but another larger part of me thinks I would ruin everything.  D:
“You shouldn’t be sitting in the dark.  Turn on a light, open the blinds.” Steve is sitting in the chair next to him, sharing an unguarded smile as he reaches for his own beer.
Tony tried locking the bedroom door.  As he expected, Sam stepped in minutes later with a key in hand.
Tony spends the rest of the day wowing the kid and ignoring the overbearing supersoldier.  He doesn’t notice Steve leave as he’s helping Peter cycle through the different A.I. settings, now with a real smile.
Tony feels as that one word goes straight to his dick. He drops his eyes down to his traitorous body before he starts messing with the hologram in front of him.
“Surrendering him to SI would void his exoneration for his infractions against SHIELD.  Let's not have that conversation again. Instead, let's continue our exchange regarding the redirection of SI.  We expect for you to begin analyzing the artifacts provided by our organization so construction of armaments can begin.”
“What...no, Tony, I didn’t mean that.  Shit, I’m sorry. Please don’t leave me.”  The supersoldier drops to the ground next to him, pulling Tony into his arms and sobbing when he feels the small man flinch against his manic hold.
“Stark. He's halfway across the globe. Even if Steve picks up, Parker won't be allowed to come here without him.”
“I never should have left.  I wanted to call. I wished you would have.  I hated spending the last two years away from this.  Away from you. I did not realize how much you meant.  To me.” He keeps his eyes and smile up as the blonde stumbles through his words, clutching Tony’s fingers between his larger ones.
“Fuck you, Rogers.  You know how adamant I am about normal issues.  I am never going to join the HYDRA bandwagon. Awarding me immunity will be your downfall.”
“While SI previously was unable to assist us, we want to involve the creators of the best weapons of mass destruction and the Iron Legion.  We understand the company's move away from government contracts for the last few years went against the wishes of the board of directors.”
Tony reaches to rub the swell of his jeans, feeling Steve’s fingers wrapped around his arm, pressing bruises into his skin.  If Barton hadn't made his entrance then, then the rest of that warm body may have pushed into him until--
“His heart rate is slow.  We must get him warm.” The king motions for Steve to come closer as he tests the weight of the armor.
“I have some news to share with you.” Steve circled the counter and stepped up to Tony until the dishes touched his chest.  He opened up his mouth to refuse again, but a heavy stare and tight mouth made Tony swallow his words as he took the plates and fled to the far side of the table.
”  Steve pushes his pulsing member further into the trembling brunette beneath him.  He gives Tony a second to adjust to the change in size before he pulls out and slams forward again.
Even as he says those words, Tony can hear his voice break, body betraying him by flinching when Steve moves his arms up his back.
Tony wanted to believe Steve.  He bit into his sandwich again before noticing he was eating alone.  He assumed the fog collecting in his mind was his paranoia getting away from him.
Tony felt the grip on his shoulder tighten.  The Winter Soldier finally met his gaze, and the captive did his best not to cringe under the dark glare as he ducked his head down again.
“No can do, sugar daddy.  I lost that worthless piece of hardware in New York trying to save that worthless wizard.”  Done with his second piece, Tony hesitates before pulling out another, meeting his friend’s widening expression.
smile and starts to lean back until he remembers the purpose of his position.  Steve watches as Tony nearly falls out of his seat, and he notices Stark’s flushed face and blown pupils.
“They are strictly non-combatant.  This was intentional to avoid any confusion on whether they were machines of war.”
Steve nods despite his hesitance.  Before his nerve is lost, he presses his lips against the top of Tony's overgrown goatee, doing his best to make his promise seem real.
“He’ll calm down.  Used to see similar reactions from veterans suffering from post traumatic stress.  James and I will take care of Tony while you’re gone.”
Tony pulled his shirt over his head with his good hand. He didn’t turn to face Steve as he responded.
Tony had started shaking halfway though Barnes's explanation. After a short moment of silence, Tony got up, grasp tight as he tried to pull the larger man up from the couch.
Tony doesn’t fight the arms that wrap around his shoulders.  He pushes his forehead down into a warm shoulder and fights back the upset returning to the forefront of his mind.
“Besides, I am fine.  Already back in action and in the makings of a suit not even you can beat me out of.  Won’t make that mistake again.”
“I think an impromptu vacation is in order. How about we take next week off and go to Hawaii?  I can lay on the beach, you can go sprint up a volcano.”
“But then I remember you’re not really here.  That this is all in my head, and this possessiveness I feel for you is just one-sided.”
“I’m not blind, Stark.  I also have hyperactive senses.  I can...detect whenever you get this.”  He moves further into Tony’s space until their mutual hard-ons are pressed together, and Tony moans.
“Do not lecture me about dealing with reality, Rogers.  Not when your head is so far up your own ass that you think some damn phone and letter are going to fix things between us.”
Tony pushes himself up straight, ignoring the heat radiating from his burned arms and the rest of the empty workshop.
She never backed down, never looked away. She was the tigress and he was the prey. “Well, it wouldn’t be the first time. And it wouldn’t be the first time someone in power was only there to make profit, and it won’t be the last.”
“JARVIS informed me you would prefer not to have the Penthouse turned into the Shire,” Pepper says. He can hear the clack of her heels over the line. She must be walking – vigorously. She does that when she wants to show she’s in command. He doesn’t know why, she can be intimidating in her sleep without even trying.
“Not animal work.” She had turned and stared at the building, then turned to Tony. She looked so much smaller, even though she had a least on foot on him for height. In a whispered she’d said, “They do such horrible things. I’m not supposed to talk about it. National security and all. But I can’t. I can’t sit there and watch as they-.” She stopped when Obadiah Stane walked up to their picnic table. His hands were in his pockets and even then he had no hair on the top of his head.
“Sunscreen,” Steve said and laughed. It was the first time he’d laughed in weeks. “You need sunscreen!”
“I have a situation, I can’t explain over the phone. Is it possible for you to come to Colorado?” Tony asked. He pleaded with gods he didn’t believe it to allow him this small grace.
“Found,” Tony said and pressed fingers into his closed eyes until he saw bright lights. Tears ran down his cheeks as he met Pepper’s unfailing gaze. “Captain America. Steve Rogers.” It cracked open his heart and every childhood joy and hope drained out. That waft of a man who’d been tortured and dehumanized for over three decades was his hero. “God, Dad, what did you do?” Suddenly Tony was happy Howard was dead and buried along with Obie – who’d apparently ran the facility long after the Stark’s died in the early 90s.
“Not normal!” Natasha spewed out another diatribe in Russian. Thor answered her but then they both quieted as the reporter announced that the King of Wakanda opposed the plan. The television switched to T’Challa standing at a podium in front of a scene that included a huge black panther statue.
One last look at Steve who just might be his future, Tony climbs to his feet and follows Bruce. Out in the hall near the nurse’s station, Tony stops and shoves his hands in his back pockets. “Yeah?” It seems foolish now, all that shit he grilled Bruce about earlier. How weird Steve acted, how he would gaze at Tony without saying anything. All that time, Steve had needed his help, probably knew something was physically wrong with him but hadn’t reached out.
Tony skulked into the dining room after another threat involving the Winter Soldier with a fork.  He initially just sat there, but he soon started shoveling food in his mouth when the supersoldier stood up and began to approach him.  Once his plate was empty and his stomach was angry, Tony fled the table, wrangling his dirty bowl into the dishwasher before disappearing back into the bedroom.  He took a long shower, keeping the heat high so his skin stained a bright pink. Just as he was getting into bed dressed in his designated pajamas (Steve was insistent on the unnecessary standard for bed attire, with Tony’s only other option being nothing at all), Sam opened his door again.
“Okay.  I'm going against my better instinct of absolute hatred and frustration and giving you another shot.  Since I can't remember you royally screwing the pooch, we can try to make this work. I won't promise anything when my memories return.  I doubt you're lying, and if you are you're a damn sadist, but I am guessing reliving the last few days will be no fucking walk in the park.”
The final instance is the only one where Tony and Steve appear in the past together. They rush to the main laboratory to meet up with the pair of supersoldiers and Iron Man prattling with the sheltered Zemo.
“Does this qualify?”  Tony always hesitates before he acknowledges Steve.  Ever since that first day in the bunker, he has never started a conversation.  He sometimes responds when Steve addresses him, only when they’re alone and Tony can keep his wits about him.
“I'm chalking Cap sex fantasies to stress and lack of recent infidelity.  J, start a log for our defense against celibacy during life and death situations.”
“Why are you here, Parker?  Isn’t May wondering where you are?”  The older man keeps his brow down, using his free hand to wipe the wet off of his face.  He can’t stop his body from shaking.
“This is why the Accords can’t work, Stark.  Those families--were you able to help them? Or did Greece’s Prime Minister tell you no, the Avengers needed to stay out of their country’s affairs?”
“Alright there, Romeo.  How about we make amends and clean up our mess before we allow ourselves to get too carried away.”
Tony takes his shoulders and pulls the supersoldier in for an embrace.  Steve drags the man closer and nearly into his lap as he starts to rock back and forth.
“We need to talk about this.  These false memories are going to be there death of us if we fixate on them.” Steve throws the pan of burnt toast and runny eggs into the sink.  He hits the counter, glaring as his knuckles crack the smooth surface while missing his husband's heavy tremor.
“Yes.  This must be my guilty conscience not beating around the bush.  I nearly killed him, Buck. For an instant, I thought I was going to.”
“Tony, that’s no way to talk to a friend.  Especially since Sam has promised to stay and keep you company for the next few days.  I trust you will prefer him to your other warden.” Steve released Tony’s knee in favor of tapping the inside of his thigh with a light touch.  The brunette turned his legs away and jabbed Steve in the side with his elbow.
Tony startled awake to Steve's blank features across from him. He sat up, reached in his pocket to find his phone missing.
“Indeed. He just got back from a mission and promised to help you house-sit while I'm away.” Steve sat on the couch next to his captive, heavy hand landing on the other’s knee.  Tony continued to stare down the newcomer rather than engage the supersoldier.
“Rosemary.”  Steve nods, accepting the spice as Tony pushes the jar towards him.  Tony hears Steve humming after he takes his first bite.
“Jarvis, take him out of the suit.”  The Iron Man armor peels to reveal Tony Stark’s svelte figure.  The Captain steps closer and looks his friend up and down before making him turn.
“Jerk.  Should’ve known I was only second choice.  But, seriously, you’re giving me your camera smile.  What do you really want, Tony?” She puts down her glass and wraps her arms around his center, pushing her cheek against his repaired hole in his chest.
When he first sees Peter again, Tony drops the drink he’s holding.  He gets a face full of the kid's hair as Peter rushes forward and grabs the glass before it lands on his barefoot.
Tony allows himself to stare hard at Steve now hovering behind the kid.  That face, now covered in facial hair and much older than those years ago that they last met, looks hopeful and eager.  Tony remembers that face as he makes a show and sucks the alien out of the ship, replacing the damaged ship with nanobots.  He remembers that face as he shares his plan and takes in Strange’s heavy words. He remembers that face when he first meets the Guardians (sans Gamora), when he’s struggling to get the gauntlet off of Thanos’s fist, and when he has a dagger of his own making through his belly.
“Most of the communication between HYDRA agents must be passed along physically, sir. The reports we located containing the cypher make reference to a sleeper with code name CASR who will lead them 'when the time comes’.  No suggestion to any brainwashing or trigger words.”
The trio of heroes turn to face them. Zemo scowls into the microphone and slams his fist down, turning on the monitor next to Stark. Tony lifts his wrist as his nanobots build a glove, blasting the computer to pieces.
Barnes scowled, eyes wide and suddenly angry.  Tony scooted to the opposite side of the bed after the supersoldier slammed his metal fist on the armrest.
“Anthony, don’t say that shit.  You know what he’s lost. What we’ve all lost.”  Rhodey snaps the lid of the pizza box before Tony can grab anymore.  He grabs the box and makes to leave, giving the man behind him a scowl with wetting eyes.
“Hah, yeah right--Captain All-American BS bawling on the sofa upstairs.  Bet that serum dried all of the tears out of him.”
“Pepper would never support HYDRA.  And SI has a very strict no ransom policy, so I can’t be used a bargaining chip.”  Tony managed to finish the bacon strip he was holding, stomach already churning. He stabbed his pancakes before he glared up at the blonde.
“Do you think I can convince Barton for an assist?”  Tony gives the Captain a cheeky smile, and the blonde scowls.
She chuckled, patting the genius’s arm as she relinquished her hold.  A call from the leading pack got the two to pick up their speed.
“I doubt it.  His feelings for you have nothing to do with HYDRA’s conditioning.  If anything, they’re getting in the way of what they want from him. He’s rather adamant HYDRA keeps you out of the picture.  I’d say it’s the only real part of Steve that’s left.”
His next visitor was not his lifelong friend. Instead, Sam Wilson walked in alongside Steve, dressed in a grey suit and crimson tie.  Tony decidedly did not look at the blonde dressed in similar black attire.
“If you actually believe that bullshit, then you're nowhere near the man I thought you were.  Riley must be rolling in his grave hearing you say this trash. You were right, Wilson; you should have been the one killed that day.”
“Sir, I am unable to identify any component of this substance.  Some of the ooze permeated the crack in your helmet and may have made contact with your face.”
Tony Stark definitely did not startle when a heavy hand landed on his back.  He took a couple of quick bites of his lunch, unable to taste the flavor.
“Your elevated body heat will be his best bet for survival.  We can get him to medical once we're back in Wakanda, but that won’t be for many hours.  I also suggest getting him into some dry clothes if you're able.” The king gives the supersoldier a pack from the named lockers with a warm washcloth, lips staying straight and thin as he stares at the two heroes.
“I do not think you realize how much of an effect you have on Steve.  He’s a monster on the field and lacks ask sympathy for his targets, but he reminds me of the kid in Brooklyn I grew up with when he’s talking about you.  Maybe it’s dumb and damn naive, but that gives me some hope HYDRA didn't brainwash all of the good out of him.”
After the two HYDRA agents settled the couch parallel with the dresser, Sam exited the room.  Barnes sat on the edge of the sofa, hiding his metal hand between his torso and the armrest.
Tony tried to stand, but the fingers clutching the back of his neck kept him down.  His vision blurred as he dropped the last half of his meal.
Tony mentally curses and simultaneously rejoices when the blonde stops, mouth hanging open as his eyes bulge and cheeks burn a dusty pink.
His girlfriend's anger seemed to dissipate, mutating into confusion and concern. She dropped her shoes and stepped even closer, yanking down the front of his shirt.  She stilled at the sight of the familiar scars littering his upper chest, eyes wide and worried.  When she looked back up, she was all fury and fire.
“Friday--fuck, take it off!”  The metal covering his body falls to the floor in tiny metal bits.  Tony sees that both of his arms are now bright red with white splotches.  Rushing to the adjoined bathroom, he turns on the sink and crowds his arms under the facet.  Vision blurring, Tony closes his eyes and clenches his teeth, swallowing his sobs as pressure builds in his ears.  He feels a hand land on his shoulder soon after, and he flings his soaking arms around through empty air.
“Are you still brainstorming on how to make a break?  You must believe you can use this to your advantage.” He blocked the blue light with his hand.  Tony started squirming when those digits drifted down to his navel, tracing small circles on his belly.
“Yeah, you told me.  Don’t need a refresh again.  The planet I was deserted on had oxygen, for some dumb, illogical reason.  I’m not brain dead yet.”
“He's currently in the custody of your company. Steve arranged for SI to house him for the time being, given specific parameters.”
“But you didn’t.  You saved me, we got out.  T’Challa told us he saw Stark the other day in the States.  You will work things out. Did you send him that letter?”
The king promises to go contact Potts after he sees the blonde nod. Steve makes his way into Tony's room, hating himself when his presence makes the man smile.
“You deserted your responsibilities to SI five years ago when you shutdown the primary function of your business and later joined SHIELD. Your split focus between the two occupations has made your decisions unsound, so I am now your handler.”
Tonight when Steve leaves the apartment, Tony is able to stay.  He lies down on the small bed, listening to Peter’s whistles from the kitchen.  The soft tune allows him to drift into a state of void, the closest thing to sleep he can manage.
When Pepper appears on the news, Steve starts to worry. The Stark CEO announces Tony Stark’s disappearance and offers a significant sum as a reward for any news that helps locate the billionaire.  She gets ushered away from the microphone when her tears start to choke her words.
“The last memory Mr. Stark has is when he was at MIT many weeks ago. He'd like to speak with you.  I believe the lack of other familiar faces is making him nervous. I trust that you will not repeat any mistakes.”
“Why don’t you call me, then?  If it is so damn important for us to chat, why the hell don’t you make that first call?”  Tony stands himself, crowding Steve’s space as he juts his chin towards the discarded block phone still on the armchair.  He cannot hear his name being called from the kitchen.
“Tones.  I heard what happened.  Wasn't sure if I'd find you ecstatic or on the verge of tears.” Rhodes wrapped his arms around his friend. Tony kept his face planted in the man's soft shirt, cursing when he felt the material turn wet.
Tony loses contact with the floor for a moment.  He’s up against the wall now with Steve’s hand pushing past the elastic band of his briefs.  Tony whimpers as Steve wraps a hand around his dick and starts pumping the length against his palm.
The heat behind those repeated words make Tony’s next comeback die in his throat. Captain America is no longer manhandling him, but he’s towering over the smaller avenger and pushing into his space, and Tony suddenly wants Steve to take a fistful of his hair and yank him back
“Tony, I cannot deal with your excuses right now. I'll be upstairs working for the next few hours. I hope for our sake you can fix this.”
“Sprint up a volcano?  Really? As much fun as that sounds, next week is no good. Already booked for an assignment.”
The same hand that embraced his this morning now crushed his knuckles until Tony could only see white. He heard a string of pops before the grip released.  Tony dropped to his knees and folded over, clutching the misshapen fingers to the reactor in his chest.
“I had hoped.  I--god, Tony. You’re so tight.”  Once the pain is replaced with pleasure, Tony meets each of Steve’s thrusts.  His legs are crossed behind Steve’s back when the blonde comes, riding his orgasm with rough thrusts against Tony’s prostate while palming his pulsing dick.  Steve falls on his side next to Tony with a small smile as he leans forward and kisses him. Tony participates, but when Steve’s hand reaches up to cup his face, Tony reels back.
Tony uses a water glass to remove the centers of two slices of bread and warms up the frying pan.  Spooning a healthy heaping of butter into the pan, he quickly wipes the grease off his hands before dropping the bread into the melting butter, cracking an egg in the center of each slice.
“I wish I was.  Most mutants and overpowered beings have been rounded up and slaughtered.  Either that or they're waiting for the next round of eugenics testing to kill them or they're the newest foot soldiers for HYDRA’s SHIELD operation.”
Rogers took the next minute to clean himself before he returned his attention to the brunette.  Tony was once again breathing evenly and was watching him with red-rimmed eyes.
“Will do.  Tony, sit.”  Steve disappears into the small bathroom, carrying a straight razor on his return.  He pulls off his cowl and stares at the contaminated part of Tony’s face with a pinched expression.
to have my parents’ murderer only a few feet away from me while I’m unconscious?  And yeah, me being awake probably can't prevent you from doing whatever the fuck you want, but I like it when the monsters stay in my dreams when I wake up.”
“I'll leave for now. But do not think for an instant that this conversation is over. He adored you, Steve.  He trusted you. You will never get that back, regardless of the pain you inflict on any of us. You trying to win him back will only make him resent you more."
“Probably shouldn’t.  I was referring to Pepper.  Saw in the paper that the two of you are engaged.”  The fingers on his back slide up to his neck and into his mess of hair.  Tony hears Steve softly inhale before he pulls back only far enough to look at his companion’s face.
The blonde averted his gaze, pressing his thumbs together as the rest of his fingers strung together in front of him.  Tony shot Sam a look and took in the man’s tight lips as he watched Rogers hunched form.
“Brainwashed? I couldn’t find any evidence of brainwashing or trigger words when I hacked into SHIELD’s database.” Tony peered up and caught the other man staring down at him, eyes unfocused and dull.
Wakanda is still bright and green.  Even as warriors fall and men turn to dust, the country continues to be beautiful and luscious.
He allows himself to stare down Steve as he wraps his free arm around the woman in front of him as he downs the rest of his drink.
He holds the confused and concerned genius against his broken heart until he memorizes the feeling.  When he pulls back many minutes later, he starts speaking, holding Tony still in his arms as those warm, brown eyes turn hard and cold.  He takes the deserved slap, keeping the angry brunet in his grasp despite his resistance.
“Hopefully she makes it this time. If I find you moping around again, I'll drag your ass to the gym and beat the heartache out of you.  Probably could convince Rogers to assist.”
“I find it hilarious that you own a copy of the Federalists Papers.  Is there really a need keep your cover here?”
“I thought the discussion with the board went well.  They seem to be on the same page about next steps.”
Tony grabbed Steve's lowering hand in his own. He hadn't rewrapped his fingers, so his grip was loose and ineffective.  Even so, Steve relaxed his joints and gently cupped Tony's injured knuckles, bringing them to his lips. He kissed the nail bed of each finger until he got to his thumb.  He drew the digit into his mouth and sucked lightly, groaning against the flesh before he let go completely and allowed Tony to scoot a few inches away.
“I’ll look after him.  It is the least I can do, given everything else I have done to ruin his life.”
“Yeah, you will need a larger cup size.  Probably DD? You lucky bastard. For now, just tuck that extra in as much as possible and put on the shirt.  Gave you something breezy to keep you comfortable.”
“He’s not there.  We left him back there, remember?  His suit is disabled. He won’t be able to follow us.”
Steve toweled them both dry and dressed for bed.  Tony did not react when Steve pulled him back against his chest, his thick fingers slipping under his shirt to tap the arc reactor.
“No popcorn, let alone anything edible besides Clint’s expired Wheaties.  No soda either. What have you been eating?”
“And what's with you?  You let Tony Stark dictate our decisions?  The Accords will limit our ability to save lives.”
Tony watches as Steve rummages through the cabinets of the kitchen and peers into the fridge before returning to his seat with a frown.
?  You fucking knew and never told me.  And as for your shit excuse for comfort--hopefully those lies can keep you warm at night when you’re out there killing innocents yourself in the name of justice.  Believing I could ever love you was the
“Then let’s go upstairs.  Everyone is gathered in the common area.  Steve looks like he’s going to start crying again.”
“That's for damn sure. You really need to set him up with someone. Maybe some action will help with his Asshole America temper.”
“Thank you for coming today, Virginia. Now that we're all clear on the situation, I expect Stark Industries to begin assessing the provided commodities and start running simulations before production. SHIELD will provide test subjects for R&D.”
Steve looks back over at Tony.  His face is flushed and smeared with dirt.  Tony tries to not break down as the blonde starts walking again.  He somehow makes it to the wall to his left before he sinks to the ground, head falling to his knees as his chest heaves and arms shake.  He cannot look up as the pair passes him even when he hears a pause in movement and feels a light touch on the top of his head.
Vision is still gone.  Pepper is across the continent, taking care of his business.  He is waiting for Happy to return with the kid so that he can talk the boy through some of new features of his suit.
“More like I have been letting his calls go to voicemail.  I'll check them when my consulting hour begins, which is not until next week.  Or maybe the week after. New assistant needs to put that on my calendar, if I ever get around to finding one.”
He feels a brush of lips on the top of his head.  Tony sighs and pulls back far enough so he can watch Steve watch him, slipping him a half smile as he leads them over to the bed and pushes their bodies down to the mattress.
“Then mentor him.  Show him how to use the suit, teach him to call for backup when he needs it.  If he’s going to be an Avenger, then he has to learn.”
“Not going to argue there.  But Tony...is this actually what you want?”  She hands him a tumbler with three fingers of scotch, bringing her own glass to her lips.
Tony did not remember fainting. The J’naii had left about an hour ago and the Avengers in attendance were sharing opinions on their guests.  One minute Tony was standing in between Natasha and Vision talking politics and society's built-in gender roles, and the next moment his head was pressed against the android’s shoulder as Vision carried him over to the couch, tailed by the gang.
“You told me Barnes died.  Even if he was still alive, he would be over a century old and probably not the best person to play chaperone to my shenanigans.”
In the weeks to follow, Rogers regularly visits Tony down in the workshop.  He sometimes comes with a question or request, but more often than not he sits on the couch and just starts
“Go ahead and line up the film.  I’ll go check see if we have any popcorn.  Do we have any pop? Kid’s not old enough for beer, though back in my day no one really cared much.”
Tony forgets to leave his workshop for another thirty hours after he finishes his shower.  He takes a short snooze on the couch and wakes up to Peter Parker shaking his shoulder.
“Hey, Nat.  Have you seen Tony?  I checked the workshop and his room.”  Pepper came up to the trio with a suitcase in one hand and her heels in the other.  She glanced at Tony, giving him a once over before staring at his ratty tee. Her gaze furrowed.
Tony twists the arc reactor embedded in his jacket and builds a long vibranium blade on the front of his gauntlet. He stabs the thick metal between them and cuts a rough circle out of the barrier, making Zemo freeze with his mouth gaping.  Steve stalks over and yanks the small man down to the floor, stepping on his wrist until he hears a decisive pop and a mangled scream.
“Are you sure it’s not due to your history? It is rough, you know.” Clint offers him a look of consolation. “We could catch a drink or something. How much time do you have before you gotta be back at it?”
“This is fantastic,” he murmurs. He turns on the water and uses some soap to rinse the lube and nanites away. He wonders how they’ll stay in place during but figures Tony must have planned for that as well.
Tension constricts Steve’s muscles; Tony feels it under his palms as if he is forcing himself to stay put and not jump away from Tony’s grasp. “I know. But knowing you as there is slightly different than knowing you here. Just like-.” He inhales, holds it, and then exhales. “Knowing me as a crow would be different.”
“Step off to ten,” Steve says and then waits as Tony finds his footing on the grassy path to the house. “No. Not the steps. That your butler here is named Vision. That doesn’t strike you as strange?”
He hadn’t wanted to talk with her. Most of his time in Wakanda he’d only wished for solitary isolation. “I’m not sure what you mean, ma’am.”
Natasha is on her feet next to him. “None of us knew, Steve. Not at first. I’d seen him on the cliffs of Vormir. But none of us knew who he was. Not really.”
He slid up to meet Steve’s gaze. “I shouldn’t do this. You give too much.” He ached when he thought of how much Steve offered without asking for anything in return. “Why? Why do you do it?” Was it some kind of enthrallment? He wanted to believe that it was love and not a spell cast unknowingly by him on Steve.
Could it possibly be? Could Steve accept this – this relationship? A relationship based on everything he learned that was wrong. Except maybe he didn’t learn it was wrong. He recalled across the hall of the tenement house he shared with his mother. He remembered the pair of bachelors. Their small apartment was across the hall. A one bedroom tucked in the back of the building. Most renters of the building accepted the idea that one of the bachelors slept on the couch and the other slept in the bedroom. During the Great Depression people did what they could to survive, sharing a meal, sharing a flat. The men across the hall were survivors. Or were they?
“Yeah, can you come?” Tony asked. It was a small miracle that Rhodey happened to be so close. “Not officially.”
Every drop of blood he gave over to Tony, he had done so freely. He’d died to give Tony life again and then Tony offered the same back. The energy binding them grew in intensity while the sun rays gave him new life. Slowly they eased back onto the lounger with Tony hanging over Steve as he reclined.
“Are you sorry you interrupted me or sorry for what you said?” Tony asks and his tone sounds more teasing than condemning.
“Yeah, a little. Well, a lot. It was a great experience. I got to see a lot of the world.” Steve smiles for the first time, a real smile not the professionally pasted on one he walked through the door with.
“How many of you have I killed in his name?” He barely voices the words. It’s too hard to accept. “He found me wandering in the woods. I died.  In life, I was an old, old man when I died.” He closes his eyes only to free more tears. They stream down his face. “He bound me to him. I had nothing and he gave me a purpose. I couldn’t remember who I was.”
“Well,” Tony said as he dusted off his hands from the meal. “Then we’re going to need help when we finally find him. It’s not like we have the means to wipe away that kind of conditioning.”
Tony screams and curses. Steve groans and cries out. It’s not a perfect thing, these moments between them, but it is true. It burns and scorches his brain as he hunkers down with his ass in the air and Steve thrusts into him, his moaning more like primitive growls of want. He glances back over his shoulder and glimpses the strain, the pronounced muscles on Steve’s chest, the bulging of his biceps and his legs as he rams into Tony. The glide of Steve inside of him, running against his muscle ring, titillates and overwhelms him. He’s so full. Thick and powerful, Steve slams against Tony and then draws out with excruciating slowness. Tony pushes back to meet him and then Steve bends over him and wraps a hand around his head to hold him in place so that they can kiss. And then with a quick jerk of his hips, Steve’s coming. Hot fluid spills into Tony and he shudders out his own climax. It is over too soon and they flop down onto the bed.
Tony adjusted himself and sat up to see Steve. “When you’ve been abducted and tortured for months you start to think about ways to ensure that you’re never without your weapons. They ruined my heart, Steve. It wasn’t a choice in my book.”
As the stars of their pack cascaded down around them in bright blues and crystal white, Tony searched for an answer in Steve’s expression. “Misled?”
“You’re old fashioned, too.” Tony easily walks back to the stool and settles on it. He douses the fruit with a heaping topping of the whip cream and then proceeds to spray it directly into his mouth. He slams the spray can onto the countertop and smirks at Steve. “Want some?”
He tears out of Steve’s arms. “I need to go home. Back to the cabin. I have to work on the upgrade. Now.”
Rhodes yanks Steve away from Thor and his family and brings him to his assigned table. He leans down and says, “I’ll be back to get you after. Whatever you do, for God’s sake, don’t leave.” He glares at Thor who is still waving at Steve. “For anything.”
The warmth spreads through him and he immediately sinks down as if the water pulls him under its surface. It’s so comforting, and he reclines in the tub. “I think this might put me to sleep. I won’t be any good for you.”
“Please, everyone heard about your display. How you went to your alma mater and used that BARF technology to show off your own inner pain.” Tony clamped his mouth shut as the sorcerer studied him. “You both have that in common, I think. The past haunts you.”
Steve waits it out for a week before he breaks down and decides he needs to bring in his horse for new shoes. The last encounter with Schmidt caused his horse, Shield, to throw a shoe and he’s worried about the integrity of the hoof. Shield has been with him since the war, and is more of a friend than just a horse. Bringing himself to admit he needs Stark’s help though, isn’t an easy task.
“I didn’t mean go get dinner!” Tony yells after the big animal. “We’re not married or anything.” He looks down at his lap, filled with the armor and then back at the trail where Blu disappeared. “This really does look like some freakish Disney film. Here I am the little Disney Princess and you’re the distraught prince.” He giggles. He needs food and water.
The faceplate dissolved, and Tony glared at Steve, the anger ebbing off him like the incoming tide. “You left.”
“Want always, always to be like this. So good. So full. Not hungry anymore. So full.” He wrenches his body off the bed, so much so he nearly dislodges Tony.
“Stay with me, sunshine,” Tony whispered and then fell silent as the darkness swallowed Steve once again…
Rhodey and Pepper make their exit to get the food while Doctor Strange remains in the room. He doesn’t say anything and, for a moment, Tony thinks he’s trying to fool him.
Steve shakes his head, not because he doesn’t want to share with her, but because he doesn’t know the answer.
anytime soon. So no, you can all kiss my ass. Fury didn’t want me to be part of his boy band and I have to agree.” Tony climbed to his feet. “You can let yourselves out of my conference room.”
“Maybe,” Steve says. There’s nothing for it he knows. He’s done for, finished. “I think you might be the devil.”
Tony stood, stunned and speechless. What the hell was going on? Belligerent. That was the only word Tony could use to describe Steve. He’d visited with Steve only a few hours ago in the dreamscape and that Steve was sorrowful, mourning, lost. “Is this some kind of test?”
