Suddenly he felt a light, but also loving pressure on his hand. Castiel carefully lifted his head and looked straight ahead. He looked first at his hand, which was in Dean’s, and then at his face. He was not asleep, but his eyes were closed. Castiel looked at him like that for a long time. He looked adorable. And then Dean turned Castiel in his arms and kissed his forehead. The corner of Dean’s mouth played around a small smile. "Morning, sunshine.“
"Where’s Cas?“ Sam asked after a while.
"Of course not. Never.“
While he was sitting in the restaurant, his cell phone rang. His second cell phone which he used only for work purposes. For last-minute appointment requests, repairs and the like.
"Dean, I am sorry, I thought your idea was very funny.“ In point of fact Dean knew he wasn’t that funny, although he always told his little jokes to everyone who couldn’t hide from him. Some people, mostly women and Sam, would roll their eyes and huff a slightly amused laugh. Some would actually smirk a little. But making Cas laugh like this, all free and uncontrolled? It might be his favorite sound in the whole world right now.
Castiel noticed that Dean’s eyes had become moist.
Aww. Dammit. Dean’s heart gave a little jump, and he wrapped both arms around his torso. For a change, not to ground himself or thwart a panic attack, no, just because those words anchored and warmed him so much inside.
Cas had already gotten into a cab and a few seconds later was no longer to be seen. Dean stood in the parking lot, unable to form a clear thought. What was going on here?
At those words, Dean had started crying so hard that he had had to leave the room. And yes, Bobby had been right, there was so damn much to do and renovate, but it was in these jobs that Dean really got into it. Soon he and his friends would be tackling the next major steps, and he was looking forward to it.
He had only read the short passage of Angel’s message out loud. Maybe it had just been a figure of speech, the man trying to convince him he was capable of overcoming obstacles when his appearance fit the purpose.
"Let’s- take another one. I got an idea,“ he mumbled. "This time, you gotta smile, though, Cas. Think about your happiest state, all right?“
"Who says I dance anyway?“ Castiel grinned at him. "Maybe I’ll just sit here all evening, drinking and sulking.“ He probably would have done that if Green Eyes hadn’t shown up.
“You’re dreaming, girl, lost in a moving dream.“ -> from "Electra" by Sophocles
Dinner was awesome, and they quickly fell into casual conversation about what had happened recently. Dean hadn’t seen the two of them for a couple of weeks because Sam and Eileen had been hunting a lot in addition to taking care of their house search. Unbelievable how the time had passed.
"Dean,“ Cas growled and moved closer on the sofa, approached him as fast as a wildcat. Dean was a little turned on by that, but that sensation faltered the moment Cas watched him kinda adoringly.
Well, that monologue had lasted for another 5 or 10 minutes. Bobby meant well, he always did, but Dean couldn’t simply stop. He needed the money, Bobby was aware, one of the main reasons he had hired him in the first place. Apparently, he had also given Dean a chance because according to Bobby he was a bright kid and a better man than his dad had ever been.
Dean’s anger was tangible in his kiss, and Castiel moved his lips against his, never having felt so shaken up in his entire existence. Dean kissed him. He kissed him. It felt so much better than in his dream.
And so he opened Angel’s next message with excitement.
Thank you for reading! Please let me know what you think. :)
The story started in heaven, of course, with a brief introduction of the living situation. Mr. Adork lived on a cloud, in a small cottage with a fireplace. Castiel saw that the living room had also been drawn - with an old television, a leather armchair, and a music system from which notes rose into the air.
They went back to the car and Dean told him about his newest readings. In doing so, he went into so many details that Castiel was consumed by his feelings.
"I do have an old shirt in my room. A flannel. I don’t wear it often. If you’re not too picky style-wise you can have it,“ Cas said while looking him up and down. For the first time since Dean had met him, he saw a shy expression in his eyes.
"Like an asshole?“ Dean grinned at him again, in that mischievous way. Cheeky and open, the way he’d been to him when he wasn’t trying to put his hatred above everything else. His eyes sparkled, and briefly Castiel was tempted to sink into them like he always did. No. Dean wouldn’t. He had sent him away.
“Dean.“ Again this reprimanding tone and now the measure was full.
"Dean,“ Cas said accusingly and backed away from him.
Wordlessly, Dean reached for his own chest, stroking the spot where his heart was with his wet hand, which only made Cas cry more. It was silent crying, but Dean somehow still heard every unspoken word, understood Cas in his every emotion and gesture and facial expression. Cas leaned closer to him, closer, not kissing him, but eventually burying his face in the crook of his neck.
"Cas, I can hear your thoughts, you dumbass.“
"Cas issues,“ he evaded his brother.
The song ended and seamlessly transitioned into the next. Supertramp’s famous song "Give A Little Bit“ blared from the speakers.
"3 am,“ Cas answered.
"You’re very much focused on the matters of sexual intercourse, though. I wonder what conclusions that allows one to draw about your character.“ Castiel leaned back a bit on the sofa and sipped his cocktail extra loudly and conspicuously until the glass was empty.
Love was a trench coat which would never be only a piece of clothing anymore. Love was the smell of forest, honey, and lime.
Cas climbed onto Dean and got bolder. Cas‘ fingers were skillful, and Dean almost came in his jeans because he felt so good. They still hadn’t talked about them, and Dean was afraid to bring it up. He was aware he was an idiot, but he wasn’t good at this stuff. And Cas wasn’t exactly talkative in this matter either.
The little sounds Cas made distracted him. His humming when he discovered something interesting. The snorts when he found mistakes in the Enochian translations. The frustrated sighs Dean could never quite explain. Every few seconds Dean lifted his head, sneaked a peek at Cas and lowered his eyes again. Getting nervous in his best friend’s presence didn’t alarm him. At least, that’s what he spends most days convincing his mind of.
I'm @dean-and-cas-at-the-sea on Tumblr. :)
"Yeah, well, I prefer this one, that’s for sure,“ Dean insisted, kissing the corners of Cas‘ mouth now. Cas sighed, pulling Dean closer. "I’m willing to agree with you for a change,“ he hummed. Dean chuckled and fiddled with the blanket. "Do we have a few minutes?“
His body no longer obeyed him, and to make matters worse, the man now put his arms around his waist, quite as if he wanted to keep him with him. He was very direct and showed his interest, and Castiel liked that.
Damn. He was the biggest idiot of all time. Why did he always have to be an ass when he was insecure?
“Music in the soul can be heard by the universe.” -> by Lao Tzu
And damn it, it was Christmas, and he didn’t care that he was the gooiest guy on the planet today.
Castiel stopped reading, trying to process all the things he had just learned. Then, he reread the message, slowly taking the words in, again feeling astounded and mesmerized by the other’s way of writing, being so open and honest. He saw all those references, the personal details, the emotions and the things which were so cheeky Castiel blushed a little. In fact, all those words were so wonderful that Castiel’s belly tingled even more the second time he read them.
AngelMuses"
He sent him the photo of the notes, so Angel could also read his text about his dreams.
"Look to the left, on the side of the road where all the trees are. Yes, that’s the spot. Here they come now.“ In fact, at that moment, a man, in his late 30s or early 40s, came towards them. He looked very slimy with his hair, which had clearly seen too much gel.
"Dance with me,“ Cas demanded suddenly. Dean raised his head, slurped his cocoa and laughed out loud. "You gotta be kidding me.“
Now Dean could only cackle because Cas’s sense of humor appealed him more by the second. "Yeah, right. Remind me to never make out with you in a public bathroom.“
"Okay,“ Cas said without anger or disgust. Okay. Nothing more. This guy was so unbelievable.
The Ancient literature stuff is mostly for getting the story in motion although there will be more references to pop culture etc in the future. :)
After he’d patched up her ankle and head wound and given her a cooling pack, Dean ran into Sammy’s room and picked up a hair dryer. Finally, he looked for some old clothes he mostly used for handicraft activities.
Because Angel was going through a hard time, and in some way Dean was able to help him cope. Angel felt better because he was there for him. That dumb-founded him, but he understood that much now. Eventually, they would surely switch roles in that regard, that much he knew.
In one corner there were two small wooden chairs and a wooden table, as well as a small cupboard. "Awesome,“ Dean shouted, whereupon Cas gave a quiet laugh.
"Evidently,“ Castiel replied, increasing the pressure on Dean’s knee.
"Lemme take a picture, okay? Wanna preserve all the good memories.“ Dean raised his cell phone in the air, and at that moment he cared precious little that he was about to take a damn selfie.
A man who didn’t want to get attached yet
"Definitely. So-what’s it gonna be?“ Dean winked at him, because, naturally, he already knew the answer by now; after all, they’d talked several times about how much they were looking forward to finally falling asleep entwined in each other. Still, it touched Castiel that Dean had put so much thought into this road trip in advance.
Certainly, the cookies didn’t have the perfect form and weight, no cookie resembled the other. Instead, they were pure chaos, a bunch of variety. Some cookies were too big, some too small, some too longish, some too broad. Sometimes the edges were missing, some cookies were slightly burned, some were still a bit too soft.
“Now don’t look like that. I’m not a goth girl. There’s just something wicked about it that totally turns me on.“
"Trust me, you don’t wanna know what happened,“ he finally replied. "Family stuff. The bad kind. Ya know the book
Dean raised an eyebrow and licked his lips. "He - what? Ya serious? Huh.“ Dean paused, and hummed softly. "Wouldn’t have guessed that in a million years.“
"I accept this proposition.“
Dean massaged his temples as he already overthought tomorrow’s situation beforehand. And still, he fought against this existential fear he felt. Why did his dad always have this grip on him?
"Please,“ Dean breathed, which was enough of an answer for him. Restlessly Dean moved under him while Cas agonizingly slowly undid Dean’s belt buckle. He was getting hotter and hotter and could barely contain himself.
"Just— no scratches or dents, otherwise I’ll chase you to Mexico.“
As in their messages, their minds simply flowed into each other, words becoming new compositions just as their mouths formed duets.
"Castiel,“ Dean breathed, swallowing hard. He hadn’t called him by his full name in ages, but right now, he had to.
Dean stopped outside, didn’t go any further, just looked at the familiar site, not really knowing what he was doing here.
Finally, he stuffed the cell phone deep into his jacket pocket, as if he wanted to bury it there. As he did so, his hand brushed a piece of paper. Frowning, Dean reached for it, quickly recognizing the flyer for the party Gabriel had given him in the car store.
"I received your letter and the package, thank you. Please don’t contact me again. H.“

Because for some reason Cas actually wanted to know everything, every little detail, every anecdote, many of which weren’t even that insanely exciting. They both gushed as they expressed their desire to take time off someday to travel to different countries around the world. All the while, Cas smiled a lot, warmth coursing through Dean. As he ate, his eyes kept darting to him. Now he even found it attractive when he ate his damn burger.
"No, unfortunately not,“ Castiel replied and felt miserable.
Oh. He was also supposed to write Angel the traits he had chosen. Great.
Since RambleOn’s message, Castiel could not wait for his return. What surprise did Rambler have in store for him? And why did Rambler now make it clear in almost every message that he saw a meeting virtually ahead of him? Castiel understood his anticipation, but he had the feeling that he had missed something.
Subliminally, he heard a deep "Dean?“, then everything went black.
Burnout. Dean had always succumbed to the misconception that such things only happened to the highest bosses, the rich snobs, the top managers, not to a nobody like him.
His goosebumps didn't belong to the good ones, and he felt dirty even though he had already showered three times in the last few hours.
Thank you for reading!! Please let me know what you think. :)
Writing you, reading your answers – I can say quite frankly that this is also my current highlight. This is not even because everything is going badly, many things are developing far more positively than I would have expected, no, it’s just that the acquaintance with you is so extraordinary. Unique.
Later, he took care of Baby, washed her and finally got rid of all the dirt that covered the lack.
Less than four hours later, he was already on his feet again. With his suitcases packed and a huge appetite, he showed up at breakfast. Considering the early hour, there was only one other man present who was completely absorbed behind his newspaper.
His thoughts tumbled until he heard a loud clang. Fuck. In front of him lay various yogurt jars now burst open, bread, pie, vegetables, peanut butter and the shopping basket. At least only a few articles, otherwise it would have been a single disaster. After staring at the floor for what felt like two minutes, Dean lifted his gaze again and grasped the situation.
Hectically, Dean’s eyes darted over his counterpart’s face, still being somewhat bewildered. How could a face radiate profundity? It was impossible, Dean thought – and yet.
He heard a sniffle beside him and looked to Cas. His face was only minimally lit, but Dean couldn’t look away. Tears were running down Cas’s cheeks. Uncontrollably, growing more by the second. Cas licked his lips, wiped his eyes, his lips began to tremble. At that moment, Dean thought that he had never seen anything more beautiful than this vulnerable Cas in front of him.
Castiel laughed and sobbed simultaneously. It was unbelievable how many little details Rambler noticed by now.
I’ll also put the two scenes Dean mentions in his message in the end notes in case you wanna check them out afterwards. The clips are very short and don’t contain spoilers for the movies, but I think they make Dean’s thoughts regarding the movies more graspable. :)
The concert was coming to an end. On stage was a young guy, a bit younger than him, who had already captured Dean just now with his emotional and distinctive voice. But now he was sitting on a stool, breathing deeply in and out and announcing that he was going to sing "Better Man“ by Paolo Nutuni in an acoustic version. Holy shit. Holy shit.
"It’s not your fault,“ she said, and Dean laughed bitterly.
"Okay. Consider it done. On one condition.“
Cas laughed at that, and Dean genuinely enjoyed hearing this sound.
"Sure. Wanna ration it for the worst nights, ya know,“ Dean finally replied. "So, I’ve been busy. What do you think?“ He pointed to the newly planted beds and waited for Cas‘ reaction.
Sighing, he turned to Tim's parents, mainly looking at his father. "I’m sorry for intruding your son’s birthday like that. My- um, a friend of mine is challenging me today. I’m supposed to spread happiness and stuff. So, there’s that.“
Some receipts when the three of them had been in a diner. A printed out version of a children’s fairy tale. A photograph of Sam, him and Dean in the bunker. A newspaper article about a large bee-keeping. A small booklet about lore. One of Dean’s bracelets, which Dean had given him in a knee-jerk reaction because Cas had stared at it so intriguedly, always speculating about how much of Dean he recognized in it, whatever that meant.
"I got the feeling you ain’t here just for talking a guy out of potential jumping, huh?“ Dean asked, grinning.
That was all he said. Had Dean really just made another step towards him? Did he, after all, wanted to have more to do with Castiel than he had first let on? Hope rose in him, that treacherous, cruel hope.
"Dean, do you want to leave? You seem very angry,“ Cas muttered, and Dean felt a twinge in his stomach. Cas felt uncomfortable, of course he did. Because Dean always attracted bad stuff. He couldn’t have that, he wanted to be good to Cas, to make him happy, not sad. His eyes fell on the pink and blue checkered napkins in front of him and he crumpled the paper between his fingers. No, he wasn’t going to let this ruin his day.
During the summer he had investigated clues to a werewolf, but they had quickly turned out to be a dead end. Finally, the sun and the hot temperatures had made him adventurous. That’s why today they passed the huge rock straight on and followed their GPS device.

When had Dean come closer? When had his face taken on that determined expression? So tender and troubled and - for lack of a better description - passionate? Castiel felt Dean’s hand on his thigh, his other hand on his back, and his heart raced. He saw Dean’s face so close and easily could have counted every single freckle if he hadn’t been in a complete turmoil.
"You will leave again.“ It wasn’t a question, a statement. Castiel had guessed, actually known, but hearing Dean say it now caused an aching in his throat.
"I would like to go to the fair. I saw a poster the other day.“
"Mmm, yeah. Me neither. Move closer to me.“
Everything was right with you
"Okay, fuzz, who’s hunting you, and what brings you to our little project here? Speak up, we’re all talking openly here.“ She looked at him excitedly. Castiel suppressed a smirk. She would be hard to fool. He wasn’t interrogated, Castiel reminded himself.
I suggest listening to the songs appearing in this chapter - at the times they are mentioned. :)
Right now, he felt the urge to yell "I love you" at him over and over. Hell, for a few days it had felt like they were inseparable, like Cas was practically living with him already. So when his cell phone rang, he was briefly tempted to ignore it, but it was his other cell phone - and this one was for cases. Maybe it was an emergency.
“M’kay,“ Dean said and grinned.
Castiel rolled his eyes. "Anything else?“
"You got-“ He closed his eyes, opened them again, and grinned. "You left some cotton candy in your face, buddy.“
He was happy that Sammy wanted to see him, on the other hand he felt so much anger. For busting his ass for months to take care of Sam’s health, his brother sometimes acted ungrateful. He worked so much, always had, and Sam had been able to live his life the way it was right for the most part, at least in the past.
Depending on how the sun reflected, the water took on different shades of blue and green. It was a fascinating play of colors. However, the special turquoise stood out the most. Dean downright sank into the depths of the water. A few remaining ducks and swans swam through the cool water. Their quacking and the splash of their tails as they moved were the only loud sounds.
"Of course,“ Cas said again, still staring at him. "Anything you wish.“
Thinking of his mail partner, Castiel smiled slightly. In the morning he had seen that the other had already written him a short "intermediate message“ to his long answer.
Castiel heaved a sigh. "I don’t think I’m ready for a relationship.“ He ran his fingers through his hair, wishing they would change the subject. Why did Gabriel have to keep bringing it up?
His mind was so unreliable at the moment, and he felt like he slowly lost control. He felt like he carried a huge pile of sand with his arms and hands, and the sand just faded out of his fingers.
After a while, he heard the hotel room open, and Dean went in. He didn’t come to him, and Castiel decided to give him some quiet. It was only when he heard his name, muttered over and over, that he took action. He went inside, closing the balcony door behind him, so they wouldn’t freeze.
Castiel liked his irony and could even overlook the fact that it came out mostly when he was pulling Castiel’s leg.
"Sure. But you have to promise me you enjoy the time with him, okay? You really deserve this.“ At that Dean smiled a little while also feeling flustered.
He was standing in the door frame, apparently deciding whether he should enter or not. Dean ruffled his hair, pushed the blanket away and stood up. "No problem. What time is it?“
Dean walked and walked, eventually got a cab, and still ended up back on campus. Of course. The place he had left by choice, even though his studies were the best thing he had ever dared to do. The place that reminded him of his dreams, the place his father hated because he had had no control over him here.
"So? I’m fine, not really in the mood.“ Dean watched him, trying to figure out what the deal was. "Look, this is gonna sound weird, but I really need you to take a seat over there. Here, take the money.“ Sam handed him some notes and ugh, this was so wrong.
"Yeah,“ Dean said, taking two sips. He froze, feeling like he was sinking in a blizzard. "Could you turn on the heat?“ he asked, massaging his temples.
And the night sky is star-bright, so star-bright with you
Dean cleared his throat. "Okay, Cas. Ya know what? Tell me about those fantasies. Maybe I can help ya. I mean, that’s what best friends are for.“
His mind provided him with too many thoughts all at once. Too many thoughts over the course of just a few seconds.
And now the tears were running down Cas‘ cheeks. He sniffled, and Dean knew this was it. The happiest day of his life. Again, he kissed Cas.
Emmeline put a hand over her heart and sighed. "Tell me if I can help you in any way.“ She smiled like it was Christmas already, and now Dean was on fire. He could kill two birds with one stone. It was ideal, and he was proud of himself.
This applies not only to business meetings, but regrettably to interpersonal encounters, i.e. dating. You wrote of being objectified many times in the past. That may not apply to me to the same extent, but still, I know the feeling of being reduced to an image that people have of me.
Another fluffy chapter. Still. Warnings for: Homophobia and homophobic comments; mentions of past child abuse.
Dean had been sobbing incessantly ever since he read Angel’s words. He was fantastic at putting things like that into words, and Dean found himself thinking more and more often about whether Angel actually had to do a lot of formulating or writing in his jobs. It seemed very likely. His mind itched, like his subconscious wanted to tell him something important. He felt too emotional to develop any coherent thoughts.
Eventually, he had lain down. His face pressed to the wooden floor, he had lost so many tears that he had finally fallen into a restless sleep. It was only the (loud) doorbell that had startled him. It had been Bobby, who had said nothing but looked at him. Bobby had thrust a beer into his hand and a leather notebook. “For all those thoughts,“ he had said.
He removed his hand and shook his head. "I am more powerful than many creatures on earth, but I’m not omniscient. When you don’t want to talk to me, that’s fine. But don’t be so amusing and open and honest in one moment, and then turn back to your nasty self, this stupid, stupid facade. It confuses me and shows me all my mistakes I made in the past. Just don’t.“ Dean wasn’t used to Cas being so emotional, and he regretted his behavior – again.
Here comes chapter 16. This one's a bit angsty due to some topics they write about. (So: Warnings for homophobia and mentioned child abuse/abandonment.)
At first, they talked about the last days. The hunt and Cas‘ news concerning Lucifer. Then Dean trusted him with some of his nightmares, not leaving any detail out, though he couldn’t bear to mention the last nightmare about Cas.
For his seminar on Ovid, he was rereading the Metamorphoses, which existed in different variations and always fascinated him. They would also make an excursion to Aesop’s Fables, a real classic. In the library’s database he found that there must still be a very old edition of the Metamorphoses. He rose from his seat, combed the shelves until he found what he was looking for. The book was hidden, he almost didn’t see it, as it was stuck in the far corner of the shelf, somewhat dusty and inconspicuous. Surely no one else had strayed here.
I will watch "Castle in the Sky“ tomorrow. I have already bought it. The woman in the store eyed me strangely for a moment, then laughed and said that I’m now carrying the magic home with me. I’m excited to see this movie. Just now I was already googling for the soundtrack, and was quite taken by it.
Before Dean could react to that, Cas’ lips held a faint smile which got broader by the second, and wasn’t that a sight Dean would never get tired of. His eyes sparkled and he looked genuinely happy. Dean needed to remember this expression because seeing Cas smile was so much better than throwing any false accusations at his friend. Hurting him even. He hoped on Wednesday they’d finally watch
"Definitely. For example, I frigging love the term for this particular thing they do when they want to signalize other bees where to find food. The waggle dance. Although it’s not actually a dance but rather a way of communication, I find the expression damn funny.“
"Are you okay, Angel?“ It was so unfamiliar and yet so familiar to hear Dean say that pet name. It was spectacular. It was right.
The father, on the other hand, was still sitting behind the wheel, rolled down the window and lit a cigarette while watching the events in silence. It resembled a scene from a family satire.
He had really enjoyed dancing with Dean, the man with the beautiful green eyes, the cute freckles, the contagious grin and the cheeky, yet intriguing demeanor.
He hated the person he had become, the person the Mark made him. The person he would become. No longer truly human, maybe not a demon again, but just a shell of his normal self. Another scream rose in his throat, wanting to get out, to make itself known.
Wait a minute.
Moving here to study had been the logical move for Sam at the time. Sam had known he wanted to get into the graduate program in biomedical engineering. Moreover, the university had an appealing campus.
Why? Why would Dean say that? It didn’t make any sense to him.
So they did. Dean watched the stripper, to his own surprise felt NOT turned on by her although she had one hell of a body. But he tried, he tried to appreciate the thought here, Cas obviously wanted to give him something he liked. And at his thought he finally grinned.
Cas laughed. "You don’t have to do anything. In fact, I want to do something for you. Let me distract you.“
Next, he thought about Angel’s story about his adoption, the difficulties with his family, the tragedy with Hannah, then he thought about Cas whose faithful parents he had met and the day when he had been such a mess after book club. The very day when Angel had written Hannah again and was so sad about her short reply.
Outside, he immediately spotted Dean leaning casually against the wall of the building. He was wearing a military jacket, a dark gray scarf, and a big grin.
"That would be also your eyes, although I very much like your lips and back and shoulders, too.“ He had said it out loud, and felt a bit relieved. Not daring to look at Dean for his reaction, he continued talking fast. "Still, you already know you are an attractive man. Many people have told you that,“ Castiel added with perhaps a touch of bitterness in his voice. He hoped Dean would not notice this fact.
Dean nodded briefly at Gordon, and only now did he notice his peculiar appearance. He was muscular, had short black hair and a full beard which somehow stressed his features and eyes. He wore a gray shirt and cargo pants. Attractive guy, but not exactly Dean’s type.
“On what, sweetie?“ Holy shit, she really was a siren. Depends on whether you don’t mind that my thoughts are currently all about a guy I don’t actually know at all, but kinda also know frigging well, Dean thought. “There is someone...“ he said in a firm voice.
The man grinned – the grin being one of the cheeky kinds which Dean often used and also could make him nervous – and eyed Dean with interest. Then, his eyes widened a little, other than that he had a rather relaxed attitude. What was he doing on the roof terrace?
Again he stared at his cell phone, then back at the sky, then down at himself, looking for answers that no one could give him.
"Oh, yes, Mr. Winchester. I remember you. You had very specific wishes for the room and its location as I remember.“ She smiled at them, and Dean shrugged.
It was ironic that in this situation when he only pretended to be with Cas he didn’t feel nervous at all. It was all so natural, and he found comfort in that. Maybe that was a sign for the real them.
“I- I’m sorry I was so harsh to you. A few weeks ago dad called me.”
He turned his head, almost having a heart attack. Cas was standing in the middle of the room, without the trench coat, but still in his shirt, the tie bound a little looser than usual.
Dean scratched the back of his neck, then shrugged his shoulders.
Btw: Have I mentioned how much I appreciate almost unnoticeable subtlety? Well, I do! But you won’t find it today. :)
Referring to a fairy tale while cuddling with Cas was a bit unusual, but Dean didn’t feel like his usual self. Also, he was entitled to show his softer sides. As he remembered Cas had already told him he deserved this, Dean was all churned up inside. Cas always knew – him.
Cas continued to look at him, eyeing him neither judgmentally nor pityingly, just intensely.
"I just mean- He’s worked himself up into a frenzy, told me something about having to show you something. To give you proof. About mom. And about reminding you of your inexcusable failures. Which sounded pretty awful. I asked him what he meant but he didn’t answer. Just kept talking. And honestly, I’ve never witnessed him like this. I mean, yeah, he is pretty loud sometimes, and talks nonsense, but he was never this convinced to make your day hell.“
“'Since when does a hat have a mind of its own?', am I right?” He tapped his head like a sailor would do, and gave Cas a crooked smile. "We’re all set.“
Songs referenced/quoted:
Theatrically, Dean clutched his chest and sank to the floor, securing the first laughs of the day. Good, his friends‘ motivation was there, they could get going. He glanced around.
May I be honest? Your last message moved me so much that my brain and heart were stimulated in the best way. As if by themselves, words wrote down on paper. Words inspired only by you and by our correspondence.
Sure, he was the master in diplomacy. Not in this world.
"Woah, Cas,“ Dean yelled, and Castiel could practically see him raising his arms wildly. "Don’t overshare, all right? As much as I like our open conversations, I don’t think I need a mental cinema about you and a woman making out, okay?“ Castiel felt a sting in his gut, but he quickly recovered. His disappointment was not something Dean would gain knowledge of.
"Sure. There are so many good ones. In fact, they’re so fantastic they’d knock you off your feet, man.“
Still - in a few years, there won’t be much left of you if you keep this up. You’ll exist only as a shell. And it would devastate me if your fascinating insights, your beautiful soul, your amusing and witty ways disappeared altogether. If they were so buried under burdens and responsibilities and suffering that they could no longer be released.
' Correct?“
On top of that, I’d like to stress all of Cas‘ surprises convey a meaning/message. Some are rather obvious, some are (a bit) hidden. Keep that in mind for this and the next part because Dean – well, let’s just say he would be able to grasp Cas‘ feelings sooner if he just LOOKED. :D There are also some things to solve, but we’ll get to that.
Once again, so much was going through his mind, so much he wanted to say, so much yearning he wanted to express. But this scavenger hunt, this little adventure was not meant to build up weird expectations.
He hadn’t spent time with Balthazar for a while, a fact he was very sorry about. Usually, either he was too involved in his essays, his classes or his novel, or Balthazar was taking care of his clients and trying to win the next case for himself.
“I can not return your...gesture,”

Eventually, they both fell to the floor, exhausted and grossed out at the feeling of icing in their nooks and crannies.
Looking at the guy now…and he’s being ridiculous for even thinking this, he looked familiar. Ruffled black hair, stunning blue eyes and that unnecessary tan trench coat he was wearing over a suit of all things.
Glancing up at the man through his lashes, the man’s jaw was tense, head straight but his downward gaze was focused completely on Dean.
Still unable to move, Dean watched as he made his way back over as he picked up Dean’s satchel that was lost during his skirmish and a cloth to cover the porcelain vase in hand. Squatting down to his height, Dean felt the item being pushed into his own arms as he leaned close to whisper something into his ear.
“I know that,” he snapped, sitting up abruptly, eyes glowing blue in anger.
He wasn’t in control of his body. His hands pulled Sam’s toward him before shoving the man across the room, sending his body into one of the pillars. The gasp could be heard as the thing crumbled around him causing the Alpha to chuckle under his breath as Dean felt his body begin moving towards Sam, Castiel’s hands slipping away as he crossed the room.
“How can I? I’ve wanted this for so long,” he responded, pulling both his pants and underwear down in one go. “I don’t care what you are regardless,” cupping the man’s face again. “I knew after meeting you that I was going to love you, faults and all,” with that, he leaned in to capture those lips again, pressing forward til Cas was laying on the bed, Dean hovering on top to reach a hand to grasp to man’s hardened cock.
Castiel read on different sites that morning about how the odds of winning weren’t fair. The characters were stupid and wouldn’t listen. There were pages of other reviews but none of them mentioned anything about anyone winning.
The first thing he noticed after the blur of sleep faded, was red. The room was doused in red lighting. The blaring noise was the alarm.
He sighed, one arm wrapped around the girl, her head nestled on his bicep. His other hand moving to rest behind his head.
“Follow your heart,” the woman muttered before shutting the door behind him.
with another guy. You even
Dean glanced around the tree right after another blade whizzed by him.
"He'll be fine, he's tougher than he looks," Dean gave his brother a pat on the opposite arm that was holding ice up.
“If you believe that what you did felt right, you should pursue those interests,” he watched the meter about Dean’s head shift between red and yellow. A way Castiel knew he was contemplating everything.
“Oh my sweet Unicorn, you’re in love.”
**Edited 2/15/2020**
The last thought Castiel had when he moved in, pulling his thumb out to kiss the man. Bodies flush together, Dean’s hand gripping the Castiel’s shirt desperately.
“You got a lot of explaining to do, Dean,” Bobby said, breaking the silence, and being the first to get up. Everyone followed suit. Dean wasn’t expecting to be enveloped in a hug by Sam so soon, relaxing into his grip and patting his back. Feeling a pat on his own back, Dean turned to see Bobby.
There’s something in the air or maybe a full moon? But after the incident with the mysterious man, three more incidents occurred during the rest of Dean’s shift.
Another strike. Does Cas keep tabs on Dean's client? I mean, it wouldn't be unusual. Thinking about it now, they do discuss the ones he's been with during their sessions.
“I’m happy for him then,” Castiel managed out, feeling as if it was becoming harder to breathe. Even though they were outside. The streets were becoming filled with passersby, people and children off to wherever they were going. Glancing at his watch, the hands showed seven forty-five.
An awkward silence fell between the two as Dean finished his drink and Castiel sat there staring at his hands.
"We had no choice," the second voice came in, soothing the other. "He knows too much,"
“How dare you compare Cake and Pie. It’s like you don’t even know me!” Dean would throw a temper tantrum if he wasn’t a freaking adult, Sam always forgets the pie. How does Sam expect Dean to last the night with sandwiches, chips, and beer alone? He needs that sweetness to balance out all that salt. And watch his cholesterol go...up.
His body flinched, an anxious tic as he tried to think about something else.
A chuckle disrupted his thoughts, he turned his attention to Meg who had a small smile on her lips.
Staring at the rows of arched lights, eventually leading out to a plethora of decorated trees.
“Thor’s mom?” Dean asked, opening his eyes to stare at Castiel in disbelief. “What does she have to do with it?”
“I was intending to pick up a guy, but she came onto me. And I just rode that wave,” Castiel nodded. Dean was openly Bi, Castiel had summarized that he performed better with males than females.
A chanting cut through his thought.
“Black Coffee?” he asked, already knowing the answer. Castiel felt his stomach flutter when those green eyes landed on him, the light hitting them just so and the small smile of acknowledgment when they landed on him. As Castiel settled the cup before Dean, the man was also reaching for his wallet. Just as he was about to refuse, the fifty-dollar bill made its way into view and it sparked something else within Castiel as Dean placed it near the cup.
"No." The quick response made Castiel's eyes widened in panic, turning his head quickly in the man's direction. Eldon side-eyed him and smirked. "This one needs to remember who he belongs to. The one who lifted him off the dirty-ass floor and put him through school, allowed him to get a job.
Italic's is Castiel
“They’ve come to tear your soul into pieces and scatter it across the globe.”
"Then can I make a request then?"
“That’s none of your business,” Castiel hissed out, leveling Dean with a narrowed glare.
"I'm going to take that as a-" Castiel instantly shut up when Dean pulled out and slamming back in, continuing the motion at a bruising pace. Giving Castiel's ass a good smack every now and then.
He didn’t intend to stay as long as he did. Castiel was still sitting at the bar when they made the last call announcement. Castiel had lost count. Was this his 4th drink? And how many shots?
"I know, but in this, it just doesn’t fit in," Castiel responded, crossing his arms, squinting his eyes.
Cas looked from Dean to his coat. Reluctantly, he started maneuvering out of the said coat. He looked around, trying to find a place to chuck it.
“Nothing,” he said simply, standing up and reaching a hand to pat Sam on the shoulder but recoiling it when he felt the static cling.
The world seemed to fade as he slowly drifted back to sleep.
"They took Castiel."
“The usual?” Castiel managed, taking the smile from the guy as a yes. “To go as well?” they nodded. Turning his back, he mentally scolded himself for realizing that the entire coffee machine had been disassembled for cleaning. “It’s gonna be a while...” the words trailing, his hand falling to his side when he turned his head to find Meg appearing from nowhere by the man's side.
"Cas!" He shouted, banging on the window to wake him up. Nothing. Cursing under his breath, he followed along the side of the church until he reached the back.
"My bodyguard for...10. When I convinced you to leave the CIA..."
Dean opened his eyes, his brow creasing in irritation. He turned his entire body towards the person responsible. Amongst the three other people in the room, the closest one had their gun out, a shocked expression on his face.
"Tsk tsk," the Creature uttered, crossing their arms, lifting one hand to touch their cheek. "And here I thought we got you." They spoke, amusement clear in their voice. "Clearly Castiel has a firmer grip on his mind than we thought."
“But 3 losses, mind you,” The younger brother stared at him with a stern face before a smile broken through. “I’ll try my hardest with this one. A catchweight at 190”
Castiel hummed in approval into the man's neck, his hand reaching up to Dean’s pulse, squeezing slightly than letting go, enjoying the gasp it earned him.
“In an hour or so, or whenever his business meeting ends. Everyone is supposed to be leaving for lunch today,”
"This… This is what dragons do to the men and women of your village. They don't just kill them. They burn them alive. They fill them with fire and hold them in their claws while they scream in agony as the fire consumes them from within. Until all that's left is smoldering ashes...and a new dragon
He stopped advancing. "Explain."
After the food was gone and everyone was full, Sam, Bobby, Castiel, and Jody led Dean to the back of the house. He was half expecting a new car but what they presented him with was a thousand times better.
They stay for a moment later, until someone coughs. The pair turn to see the three averting their eyes, Sam points at his brother who throws him a confused look which turns into realization as he looks down. A bright blush covered his cheeks as he glanced around for the bags, however, before Dean made a move, a warm coat covered his shoulders. Castiel draped his trenchcoat around him and sent him a cute smile.
Sophie shrugged "I guess"
"I was just at the market when I found this poster-" He hands it to Dean "It's a wanted poster for some guy named Hiccup"
The angel in question looked up at his lover who was, to his delight, holding his arms open. He smiled brighter than the sun and rushed into his open arm with enthusiasm.
"It's ok, I'm not tired yet. I think it's because of my long legs I'm not sure, but I can keep going."
Once they were close enough the little girl who was crying, took notice of them and instead of screaming, froze. Her breathing skyrocketed and she started shaking uncontrollably. Sam then realized that perhaps approaching a crying child, in the middle of the woods, at night, while he was a 6.5 moose, was probably not the best idea. He attempted to soothe her and show he was no threat by lowering his body to the ground and resting his chin on her feet. He acknowledged that his brother would definitely make fun of him for this later, but it was entirely necessary to calm her down and be the least threatening he can be if they were going to help her.
"Sophie! Don't touch that thing!" One of the mothers exclaimed and attempted to get her away
Upon realizing that his brother was ok, Sam took a few steps back and surveyed the room
"Come on Castiel, we'll give you the room with the view of the trees," Ellen said.
"Jody? Jody!" He yelled at his phone before shoving it in his bag, packing his gun, and grabbing the keys.
"What? Why"
Dean quickly nudged him towards the diner, prompting him to go.
"How?" The angel asked.
"Can you help me Mr.Squirrel?" She whispered "I was out camping with my parents and Mimi went for a walk, I went to go with her but got lost. I've been out here forever and I'm really hungry and I'm tired and I'm thirsty, I just wanna go home. I really hate the dark." She concluded sadly
Dean narrowed his eyes, feeling like he should remember something that bobby said about the routes, he guessed it was something to with which path was faster. He settled back down in his spot which he had been in for far too long and he was starting to regret the prank war he started.
Sam glanced around for backup but only received a shrug, sighing, he shook his head "Fine, but if we get killed, I'm blaming you"
"Let's get going then" Dean had the smuggest look on his face that just made Sam groan
"Cas? What's going on" Sam looked up at him.
"It has been seven hours, forty-three minutes, and three seconds since we left the bunker." he said looking at Dean fondly
Cas looked concerned "Bobbies place is very far Dean, even further at the height, you are now. You will not be able to make it"
"We should take a shortcut through the woods, it leads straight to the junkyard" Castiel suggested
He blew air out of his nose and gestured to Cas and then his back "You wish for me to get on your back?"
Sticking to his word, Bobby fired a warning shot at their feet
"Dean? Dean are you ok?" The moose lowered its gigantic head to bump its nose against his head. Dean paused
"Snotlout, their dragons don't have a scratch on them, in fact, they're very well-groomed. I highly doubt that dragon hunters would take such good care of them"
"I assume that Gabriel has them" He assumed
"Ah, don't sweat it" He rubbed his thumb over Castiels knuckles, and earned himself a subtle smile.
"Well, we better get moving before she shuts down your angel travel for good."
"Yes, and if you truly love them then you want them to be happy right?" She cooed
Sam trotted down the path, glad that this was about to end because he knew that none of them were going to living down any of this any time soon. Between the trees, he could see bobby's house in the distance, barely a mile left to go. But just as the nightmare seemed to over, a gunshot shattered the comfortable silence followed by Sam's moose cry of pain. Dean and Castiel whipped their heads fast enough to give them whiplash
The brothers almost jumped out of their skin "Jesus Cas! Warn a guy before you do that"
Astrid suddenly charged at Dean with her axe before Hiccup could stop her. Dean dodged her blade and kicked her in the stomach, sending her in the opposite direction. She ran again and swung the weapon at him whilst he had nothing to hand, he dodged a few more times before deciding to just block with his arms. As she swung down with all her might, Dean held his arm up and caught the blade with his right hand, startling her just long enough to get in a good left hook. She stumbled back and Dean smirked. She touched her lip and upon seeing the blood on her hand she got even crazier.
"Ok, We'll need to get there as quickly as possible" Dean explained "Cas? Do you think you could give us a lift?" He nodded.
Gabriel and Dean had always had a childish rivalry, and ever since Gabriel started dating Sam it has just gotten worse.
"Well, we can cross that bridge when we get to it. For now, we stick with this." He turned back to the Winchesters "One more time, what do you want?"
"Sorry Sammy, I guess being a squirrel tires a guy out" Dean explains
"Sam-" Jody started "Dean won't be able to keep up at this speed"
Castiel was so furious that his true form was almost showing "No she will not."
"We need someone who can help, like Bobby" He glanced at his phone and furrowed his moose brows "Although, that may be a struggle"
He snapped his eyes to meet his brothers, he then felt a little better
He chuckled "Perhaps, but I cant hold you like this when I have four legs"
There lay Deans' shirts, they were absolutely shredded.
"Well, I hope you had a nice nap." His words were kind but his tone was aggressive
"Let me see your hand" Sam urged
Sam stood and contemplated his options. He glanced back at his brother and saw Cas stroking him under the chin. He let the air leave his lungs and sheathed the weapon "So how do we fix it?"
The woman seemed genuinely surprised at his decision and looked relieved "I have a book of spells back at my cottage, I could invert the spell and it should fix him."
"Baby!" He yelled and rushed over to her.
"Astrid-" He tried
"Dean?" Ellen asked slowly
"My hut is around here, just down the road, then we'll have to walk through the woods."
"But clearly they don't take kindly to visitors, so if you could just untie us, well be on our way" Dean spat
'Sam! Thank god! You have to come quickly, she's here and she has Dean!'
The witch startled "M-me?"
"And if they are, we split up a family." Astrid suddenly went silent "How would you feel if curiosity dragged you to a strange island, and instead of the people there being peaceful and exchanging information, they took away your dragon, tied you to a chair, and accused you of forcing your best friend to do your bidding?"
"We uh don't exactly have a car anymore" He chanced a glance at Dean who looked mortified "So we'll just have to hotwire one of the cars back at the motel"
"Now you give us a call when he's human-sized again so we can have a proper conversation, ya hear?" Ellen shouted to them as they were getting in the car
"It is great to see you all, but have Dean and Castiel arrived yet?" He said, mildly panicked over not seeing his gigantic brother on the way in.
Suddenly Gabriel and Sam zoomed past their siblings in an attempted challenge
They started to head for the police station, where they knew Jody would be. Cas and Dean never let go of each other the whole way. 20 minutes later they stood, drenched, in front of their destination. They walked in without much regard to their appearance and unconsciously surveyed the area.
"No, you need to rest. There should be enough shelter under the trees" He pushed on sams antler to steer him right
"With any luck, she won't be targeted, and we'll get to the witch before she attacks anyone else" Cas tried to give them some hope and it worked.
Bobby loudly cleared his throat, everyone stopped and looked at him
"Yeah, that would be awesome!"
Luckily the first thing they came upon was a police station, but by then the girl had fallen asleep so they had decided it would be best if she napped on Sam's back where she'd be safe. Upon walking up to the station, they realized that they couldn't exactly walk in and ask for help, but they couldn't exactly leave her outside. So they came up with a plan, Dean and Cas would find a way in and cause a ruckus. Then when someone inevitably chases them out, they'll see Sam and the unconscious girl upon his back. It was foolproof so it went off without a hitch. Police officers rushed outside but were hesitant to approach Sam, but when the little girl's parents spotted her, they burst into tears and rushed right to her despite the officers trying to hold them back.
"You got startled and accidentally used your witchy powers, but where did you get them, huh? A Demon deal?"
"Where is Dean" He was still calm.
"Well, maybe we're not nice!" She yelled to the horror of her friends "Maybe we just want you gone and would do anything to get rid of you!"
They were impressed before but now they were in disbelief. Castiel spoke up "I have been in heaven since the dawn of mankind and have never seen something like him before" He accused
He turned to thank the witch but found she was already gone. "Oh shit, should we go after her?" Sam asked
"But try to stay hidden!" Sam warned.
"Sorry..?" Sam questioned
The fight with the Winchesters was not going well, they had awoken to five people circling them ready to attack. They grabbed their weapons as fast as they could, but it wasn't fast enough. Soon, they were subdued along with their dragons, the fight was lost.
Dean took a step towards her "Listen lady, I don't know what your problem is, but we came here to document a night fury. YOU attacked US, you jumped us without provocation or any indication that we were doing harm. We were peaceful. you're the bad guy here.
It had been around an hour since they left when Sam got a little bit bored. He glanced at Dean in the rearview mirror and smirked to himself. Castiel gave a questioning look but he only smiled more, then all of a sudden, they started to speed up.
They both make their way over to the other pair
During their treck, Sam tried to keep himself steady, like the considerate person he is, but soon enough he tripped, it was inevitable given his now much larger stature. However, Dean did not appreciate that he was suddenly chucked from his rather warm resting place.
They walked, and walked, and walked until they couldn't anymore. Castiel was the first to get tired since he was slipping between human and angel, his need for rest was greater than theirs. Once they realized that he was slowing down, Sam recommended that they rest. At first, he refused, but once Dean plonked himself on the floor the vote was unanimous.
Sam signaled Castiel to check it out while he kept an eye on their new friend.
"Fishlegs is right. We just need to find out what they want" said Hiccup
Before anything could be said in retaliation, Sam stirred and looked in the direction Cas was. Upon seeing Dean, he jumped to his legs and glared at him huffing through his nose and stamping his front left hoof
"Then you need to let them go."
"How the hell are we going to fix this!?" moose man was starting to get a little frustrated.
"W-What?"
He nodded. Castiel now understood that there was no way he would be able to keep up with him when his legs were so much shorter and that Dean had already thought of that and come up with a solution. He held out his clawed hand and waited for Cas to hop on. Once he did, he raised it to the crook in his neck. Castiel settled himself comfortably between two of the spines on his back.
Sam, Cas, and Dean all shared glances and unanimously decided that their problem could wait but this little girl could not. Sam smiled at his brother's kindness and stood up, the girl took an alarmed step back forgetting how tall he was but soon relaxed, remembering that he means no harm.
He contemplated for a moment before standing down. All of a sudden the large mound started to move, they both took a step back and glanced to make sure their friend and their prisoner were still there. Dean started to wake but soon realized that he wasn't in his own body, he quickly started to panic which caused him to try and stand up. He flailed his legs, now having four of them, he tried to get his bearings. After a bit, he got to his feet. He towered over his brother and friends standing at 17ft. His legs were long and bulky with sharp claws at the end of his paws. His body was hefty and strong but his head looked, unlike anything they had ever seen. It was not un-similar to that of a dragon, his snout was long and smooth, his eyes were sharp and threatening and spines ran all the way down his back. A thick tail rested on his behind and seemed to weigh a ton, and his ears pointing to the sky.
"Well, it would go faster if I had some help"
witch pointed over beyond a few trees.
Sam leaned a bit so it would be easier to get her off and then the trio stood to the side awkwardly waiting for a moment to leave. The girl awoke when her mothers grabbed her off of Sam looking puzzled, but a look of relief and happiness crossed her face when she realized what was happening. She hugged them fiercely and burst into tears, probably staining their shirts, not that any of them cared. Smiling lightly, team free will decided to move on. However, before they managed to get far, the little girl, whose name was apparently Sophie, broke from her mothers' embrace and ran to them.
"I-I didn't-"
Dean huffed and crossed his little squirrel arms over his chest. Castiel smiled slightly, as much as he really could at Deans' cute pout. Fluttering his little wings, he landed beside Dean and as always invaded his personal space, not that Dean minded in fact he was grateful for the warmth he provided and relaxed slightly. After a minute of that, Sam started to get slightly uncomfortable and thus broke the silence
"I apologize, but I only had a limited window of where to land. The witch's spells have been causing rifts which will not allow me to land within a certain distance of them."
"What, What is that?" He stared at the heap on the floor.
She started to sweat and nodded. "My uh my cottage is in Nebraska" she spoke quietly.
"How long has it been?" his voice was scratchy but Cas only smiled
"Fine, but if you mention this to anyone I'll stand on you" He made his point by stomping his hoof on the floor twice
"I said are you ok?"
Dean pulled his squirrel face into the most offended expression he had ever seen, Sam only chuckled and kept walking along the road while Castiel shook his head and folded his wings tighter to his tiny body. After a while in the crisp air, Dean started to shiver. Castiel took notice first, he glanced down at the youngest Winchester and ran some calculation through his head at breakneck speeds. Once he was done, he nodded to himself and started to shuffle on Sams' head. Castiel spread his wings and fluttered them just enough to get himself into the air.
Dean startled and looked to Cas, worried that he would fly away since he can't teleport as a bird due to the lack of angel wings. But when he landed next to Dean, he relaxed. Cas placed his wing around Dean's shoulders and pulled him in tightly. When he practically melted at the warmth Cas gave him, he took that as a good sign that it was welcome. All dignity was thrown out the window at this point when Dean snuggled in closely to Cas's chest seeking more warmth. It made Sam chuckle after he adjusted to the weight difference, and he had to stop himself from shaking his head, lest he disturb the love birds. Well love bird and squirrel, he thought.
"Of course Dean" Castiel beckoned them both forward, and once they arrived he placed his right hand on Sams' shoulder, and his left gripped Deans' hand.
"Ok, so, backtrack. Where is she?"
"But Samoose" Gabe pouted at him, and once again raised his hand in preparation to cause chaos "It's so much fun"
"The what?" Dean replied slowly
Castiel sighed "If you insist, I shall go inside and rest, but what about you?"
Gabriel and Castiel, who had previously been lying down, wandered up to the boys at the mention of death. Dean patted Castiels neck since he was so much taller than him
"Choco, Blu, Peanut?"
They stepped inside and saw it was empty save for them, Jo and Ash. Jo was cleaning the tables and typically, Ash was sleeping on one.
"Yeah I'm fine" He replied automatically
Sam stood abruptly, knocking over his chair. He made eye contact with Dean who had suddenly become alert.
"-ean? Dean?"
"Sam, Jody! Lovely to see you again" She stepped aside "Please, come on in."
"And what if they're not? We just give two dragons back to their captors?"
"Where is he?" Castiel said alarmed
She sighed "I wasn't doing it randomly, these people-they deserved it."
He looked down at his best friend and was immediately calmed from his unsettled state. He took a tentative step forward and bent all the way down to his level. He tried to speak but was met with growls and random noises, his distress must have been evident, as Cas placed a small hand on his snout.
"Took you long enough" Dean huffed upon seeing his brother enter the room "If you're ready we should get going, if we leave now, we could make it by tomorrow afternoon"
"And what did these people do?" Cas asked.
The dragons waited patiently by the door, entertaining themselves quietly while Sam and Dean double-checked each other's bags. Once the boys were certain that everything needed was there, they walked their friends outside and began to mount. After around twenty minutes of flying, Dean started to get antsy
They both stared at the ground, Sam gritted his teeth and spoke with venom "She won't get away with this"
Sam looked elated and turned his full attention to Hiccup "That would be great, thanks."
"In all fairness Dean, it was a prank that a child would pull" Castiel countered
Despite Castiels warning, Dean ventured off into the wood to find something more interesting to do. Once he put enough distance between himself and the others, he looked around to make sure he couldn't be seen. Finding the nearest tree, Dean trotted up to the base of it and looked up. He crouched and jumped. Dean used his little claws to grip into the bark, he shuffled his way up the tree, ecstatic that it was working. Once he was at the top, he clung to the braches and glanced down seeing the floor so far down, he began to wonder if it was a bad idea, testing out his new skills. But when he looked back up, the view was well worth it. He wondered if Cas saw this when he flew.
Jo spoke next "So how long do you reckon that'll last?"
"I thought so. You don't attack one of us and come out unscathed, there will be consequences for this." Ellen had leaned all the way into her personal space, and suddenly her tone changed completely
"Sam? Dean?" A familiar voice called them from further in the room.
"Sammy, I'm so sorry I didn't mean for it to go this far." He glanced at his wound, waved his hand over it and suddenly it was gone "Let's get you all better, huh?"
That explains why they couldn't see him "Thanks" he heaved a sigh
Dean silently celebrated, excited to see his own bed again. He would have liked to stay and see it in person a bit more but that was not likely. Once it was all copied down, Sam took the paper and apologized again for his brother's behavior which earned an eye-roll. After agreeing to meet up again without such distractions, the Winchesters left.
Dean looked expectantly at Sam, they locked eyes for a moment before Sam sighed
Everyone seemed to think over his words, and after a while, she spoke up "It would feel...Painful. Incredibly Painful" She gazed at the brothers and heaved a sigh. She looked up at Hiccup who had on a pleading face "If you're wrong about this-" She pointed her axe at him
"Ok, alright, I know your jealous that were interested in the night fury, but I promise that you're still my favorite" Dean whispered into his ear. Castiel preened under the praise and suddenly felt better about the whole situation
Sam lit up "We have one too, but it's full of dragons from the other side of the archipelago. We don't have it with us, but I can recite it"
"Then you better start walking" Cas threatened.
Everyone was silent and Dean was starting to get uncomfortable. He curled in on himself, feeling self-conscious but a gentle hand on his face reassured him.
"Sam, run!" Dean urged
Before Dean could retort, Gabriel stomped his right foot and snorted, sending a signal to them that they were not alone. They all hushed immediately. The brothers shared a glance before Sam took two weapons from his satchel and handed one to Dean.
She walked up and hugged Sam around his abnormally large neck, which he tried to return as best he could. She let go and held her hand out to Dean who shook it with both hands, making her laugh. She held out her index finger and gently stroked it over Cas's back, he appreciated the kind gesture from the child. After everything was said and done, they once more started on their journey to bobby.
Sam snorted again and shook his moose head "You weren't even the one walking"
"Because they're crazy! They're some fucked up teens who think it's funny to make people miserable! They killed mom, dad, my brother, my two nieces, and nephews, they even killed my dog! Who the fuck does that!?" She was crying heavily.
He snapped his fingers and all went bright, Sam shielded his face while Cas covered Dean's eyes, attempting to save him from his brother's idiocy.
She looked to the floor, ashamed.
Bobby was quiet for a minute before he turned and walked back inside. Sam was going to call to him but he just waved a dismissive hand.
"Or, it could be disastrous." There was an uncomfortable silence
"Let's move, even if he is small he still has a dragon, and were currently sitting ducks" Sam suggests
"Which way do you think Sammy? Were going to Bobbies, you should know the way" He stated as if it were obvious
They all settled into a comfortable position with Dean using his huge body to curl around the camp, to keep them safe. Castiel was positioned right next to Deans head while the others were leaning against his stomach, and the witch was chained with cuffs to one of the spines of his tail.
Sam smiled at her and waved back "Promise"
"Yeah, good plan" The moose agreed
"Sam!" Gabriel exclaimed worriedly and rushed over to him
"That is correct"
Dean huffed, lifted his head back up, and laid down next to them. Sam strode over to their new guest to start questioning. He unsheathed the machete from its holder and made sure it was visible
Sam was leaning over the table staring intently at a sheet of paper when his brother approached and curiously glanced over his shoulder
Since he was cut off, his powers started to fade, which made him more and more human every day. This meant that all of his powers were limited - including his healing ability.
"Hmm?"
As the night continued, they shared funny stories and sad ones too. They played some games and enjoyed their food, and while they couldn't understand him, he could understand them, and it made him giddy with happiness at the thought that they did this all for him. Cas's words replayed in his head for a moment 'Because we love you, dean. All of us, not just me.' and he damn near cried.
This all started when they took up a job in South Dakota.
"Hey, hey! That's not fair!" Dean shouted as he and Cas sped up
"I'll only be a little bit, don't get your feathers in a bunch." He said nonchalantly
Neither of them was going to believe he was truly gone until they saw a body. following the marks in the ground, they soon heard a voice.
feeling warm and satisfied, Dean tried to get to sleep but found he was struggling with the awkward sound of Sams' heavy breathing.
Dean lifted his head from its place on the ground with renewed confidence. He first looked at Cas, who was beaming at him. Then he looked to his brother and mother figure for their response and got exactly what he was expecting, absolute shock. he chuckled at their ridiculous faces.
Bobby sighed "Then I'm guessing that's Dean, and that's the angel?"
Sam and Hiccup were each staring at their friends nervously, this was not going well, and it would only be a matter of time before it went too far
"The angel here made breakfast."
"We need to get you to a safe place, somewhere that she can't find"
"You had a chance to run." Jody started "But you didn't. Why?"
"No, you can't go, you haven't met Mimi yet!" She pleaded
"I missed you girl" He smiled.
"mmmhmmm"
"I say we feed them to their dragons." one suggested
Sam shook his head "That's great and all, but we still don't know how to change him back"
"I'll handle that," Dean said
He was looking up on a local witch who had been terrorizing the residents by turning them into animals. Her spells were not exactly lethal, but they were making more and more people aware of the supernatural, people who had lives and didn't need to be burdened with it. So as soon as the Winchesters heard about it, they started hunting.
"Sammy?" He questioned
"Hey bobby"
When Sam opened his eyes, he stood before his own angel in his human form again. He was avoiding eye contact with Sam, having the decency to look guilty
"So, what's the plan?" Sam asked
"So you're saying that she cast a spell here?" Sam piped up.
"Dean!" Castiel yelled in ecstasy.
"I'm here, Dean" Came the monotone voice from the table, which was now miles high to Dean. He jumped to his feet (Paws?) and gaped at his now bluebird boyfriend
They both physically relaxed.
He walked up to the door with as much dignity as he could, stared up at the handle, and jumped as high as he could, which was just short of his mark. He tried again but missed and then the third time he managed to grab the handle and gave a laugh in triumph. He attempted to pull down to open it, but it didn't budge and he tried again. Sam rolled his eyes and looked at Cas, gesturing to the door with his head. Getting the idea, waved his wing and the door clicked open. Dean laughed once again, dropping to the floor and looking at Sam
"Which one?"
"If we want him back we need to concentrate"
"I'm afraid you may not like it," He said carefully.
Once they reached the Dome, they saw everyone as if for the first time. A pair of twins with a Zippleback, Astrid with a Deadly Nadder, the snot-man with a Monstrous Nightmare, The big guy with a Gronckle, and Hiccup with the legendary night fury. They landed gracefully and dismounted.
"It seems that my brother has turned us into animals, as some form of a practical joke" He explains and Dean had the decency to look a little bit guilty
The others stood there in shock. Until Jody spoke, "So, dinner?"
"Scout? For who?" Dean said
Dean sat on the chair opposite his brother and swung his feet up to the table. With half a hot dog in his mouth, his words were muffled but living with him in such close quarters for their whole lives, he was fluent.
"Struggling?" Dean asked, taunting him
"Dean, even if I was not currently a bluebird, falling from any height would do me no harm, there is no need to worry." He stated
"Well, how are you supposed to open it?" Sam questioned
He laughed "Let's hope it doesn't come to that" He walked over to them and released them from their bindings
"Dammit, Dean!" Sam yelled
"We're not gonna die" Dean rolled his eyes "Not yet anyway"
"That's the problem, if we don't turn him back then he will be stuck like this."
"Dean took the car, so we'll just have to run" They made their way out the door, not bothering to lock it since they had all their stuff with them.
"We have a book of dragons which holds everything we know about them." Hiccup informed
Dean grumbled and climbed back to his little warm spot of the antler "you've always had freakishly long legs, Sammy."
All in question turned to look at her
"There was a witch that was cursing people to be animals, and when Dean and Jody pursued her she got startled and accidentally shot him with the spell. But since she was so shocked that he appeared out of the blue, the spell got warped and turned him into an amalgamation." Dean huffed at his reply. He thought he looked pretty cool.
"He was very worried when he couldn't find you" chirped Cas
Dean stood in front of the bar and noticed they had turned off all the electricity as to not attract his attention and felt a bit of pride that his family knew not to take on things they couldn't handle because if he wasn't himself, he would definitely be too much for just the two of them.
This seemed to make him think for a moment, but the small man didn't like that
Friday afternoons in the bunker were usually pretty quiet, as they have dedicated them to taking a break and unwinding since their lives are ridiculously hectic. However, This specific day was anything but relaxing.
"Dean, you take the woods all the way to the roadhouse and don't get seen, while we take the car. By the time we regroup it'll be about midday and we can stay there until dark, ok?"
They both stood and stretched
Castiel smiled at the brothers' familiar banter and politely waited for them to stop making faces at each other. Soon enough, Their focus landed on the door
"Sammy, maybe you should think about taking a break." He suggested
"Well, maybe you should consider that not everyone is to do you harm. Maybe you should consider that not everyone is out to get you!" Dean hissed
"Yes, he's breathing"
"What you looking at?" He asked
"What else would you be? Huh? You have two dragons that we've never even seen before, and from what we can tell both of them are incredibly rare. You snuck onto our island, have an entire arsenal in your pockets and a poster with hiccups face on it. So I would say, chances are you're either bounty hunters or dragon hunters."
Sam looked down at Dean "Having a craving for nuts? Or better yet how the view from all the way down there?"
"It's Deans."
"This isn't over"
She lifted the book "Right here."
"Then we better get going" Jody spoke
"Or, and think about this for a second, you could try being nice!"
"What?"
The only one of them that seemed to understand was Castiel.
"Yeah, right, old man like you cant aim for shit!"
She put the deputy in charge and left the building with the Winchesters. They took her to a local motel where they could properly protect her, they would be on full alert for the next couple of days. Sam and Cas were researching the kinds of spells used while Dean was out entertaining their new guest. He took Jody with him to go and pick up dinner down the road, they had been gone a while but the others assumed they were just catching up. Not 5 minutes after he had the thought, Sam got a call from jody.
Fishlegs stepped in with a big smile "That would be awesome! Right Hiccup?"
"Got it, Cas, come on let's get you saddled up" he pet his back as he walked by
"My powers went haywire when they jumped me, I got scared and lost control. The attack was completely unintentional so even if you do kill me nothing will change."
Sam and Dean Winchester are the sons of the chief, John Winchester. He was notoriously known for his hatred of dragons. So when Sam and Dean befriended two of the most dangerous dragons alive, they claimed that they subdued them to appease him. Not even days later they left their home in order to keep their new friends safe. They soon found a new home which they call 'the bunker', an underground sanctuary on a secluded island, safe from their father.
"No fucking way" He breathed, Which got the attention of both the rather large dragons
Sam and Castiel were sprinting down the road towards the diner, it wasn't too far but on foot, it felt like an eternity. After running like madmen for 10 minutes, they saw skid marks on the road that led into the forest.
Dean sighed "Yeah I figured he would be. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to fall asleep." the apology came quickly
One moment they were in the bunker, and the second, they were standing in the middle of an open field, presumably in Sioux falls. The ground they stood on was soggy and clung to their shoes when they tried to take a step, It was drizzling. Storm clouds were rolling in and the wind was throwing wet sticks and leaves everywhere, so they were going to have to find shelter.
Sam turned right into the woods, he walked until he found a suitable spot to rest. Once he was settled, he slowed his breathing and tried to get some sleep knowing that his brother and Cas would protect him from harm.
"I missed you too, Dean" Cas replied with that charming voice Dean loved oh so much
"You're ok, we're going to figure this out I promise you." He stared intently into his eyes
Seeing his brother go down angered Gabriel even more, prompting him to shoot whatever was close enough. The blast of an Archangel is incredibly powerful, so powerful in fact that when it hit a tree, it exploded. The blast sent all three dragons in opposite directions, causing the riders to fall onto the floor while Gabriel and the other two dragons passe out.
“How come there’s not a lot of information on Mom’s side?” Dean asked, sifting through the pages. There’s a family tree but it dates back to only a couple hundred years ago.
“You're strange, Dean,”
"Get out of him,"
to myself, I'm gonna make you feel how I did during those moments," Castiels smile widened at the equal part lust and horror as he pulled his pants on.
"It's fine," Castiel panted out, repeating it over and over, looking up at Dean. The darkness making it hard to read his facial expression.
The bells tolled, waking the Prince from his slumber with the cries of the soldiers as they scrambled through the hallways.
Dean stayed silently, allowing his fingertips to graze the top of the stone, noticing intricate carvings within it.
“No Cas-” Dean paused, bringing a hand up to rub it down his face. “I mean, you have me. And as a Winchester, we go all out for our friends and loved ones this time of year,” he said while pulling out a headband. Upon further inspection, as Dean walked closer to Cas, it was a green headband with little trees dangling off by little green fuzzy wires. Giving the man a confused look as Dean placed the headband on Cas’ head.
"Drop your pants," Dean commanded as he took off his flannel shirt, so he was only wearing the black t-shirt underneath, and shoving it between the stacks of chairs.
When Dean had come by earlier, not surprised that his brother was already there, asked him to help with a little family history. Sam had given him a strange look, but Dean managed to convince him.
Sam chuckled as Castiel walked by, disappearing into the back and reappearing a moment later.
This is a Songfic, mainly, the words were changed and that's all.
“On top of all of this, this person. This guy is MY rival. The one who's been taking out members of OUR family. And here you are, being a Suzy homemaker with the guy.”
“Thank you,” Cas was the first to break the silence.
She gave the two of them a wide smile as they walked through the entrance, Castiel staring in awe at the village they had walked into.
Click. Empty. The sound of the hammer being cocked again. A chill ran up and down Dean’s spine, his heartbeat slamming against his rib cage.
He was also grateful that Michael hadn’t come in yet to breathe down his neck about getting work done. Or just to be a pain in general.
"Whenever someone new rises, I just send one of my demons in to snatch them up or kill them,"
Moving other arm around in an attempt to remove the metal cuff.
Looking around the screen, he noticed a space to the right wasn’t outlined in brown. Castiel has played plenty of old school games to know that it’s an entranceway.
As he was passing the couch a hand reached out, grabbing his wrist, preventing him from moving.
“Fight,” he said to his phone, clicking the button.
Dean whimpered when Castiel removed his fingers, but Dean gave his butt a small pat to reassure him of what was to come.
Castiel stared down at the ring then to Dean and back. He was speechless. Truly.
"I'll give you three hints, Dean,"
Castiel took a second to admire the man before him.
Silence again.
The hummed yes was not what he wanted.
Face pinching in disgust, Castiel pulled out a handkerchief to whip his hand with.
He grabbed his notebook, standing with a smile.
“Alastair,” he acknowledged watching the man bow before coming fully into the room.
Across the way, Sam was standing in his doorway, equally confused.
“Stop being overdramatic,” Castiel stated while looking around to figure out what he was supposed to do.
“Why?” was the only thing Dean could utter when he saw the crows inching their way anxiously towards him.
“Dean.”
There really wasn’t much Dean could do to avoid the creature in time as its talons wrapped around him, gripping him tight as it launched itself into the air.
“Can you tell me what the hell is going on?”
"Hello, Dean," he greeted in that deep gravelly voice.
He got to the door right at the third knock, opening it in time to see Castiel's hand still in the air.
“We're happy you're safe, but we need to get to the island,” the helmsman intervened, bowing to pardon the interruption. “I know it's hard, but we must make sure the dragon is dead,” Michael glared over his shoulder at the man, the moment ruined.
“Fuck…” Dean uttered, holding up his gun as he spun the wheel to unlock the door. “I’m opening the door.” He called before pushing the door open.
Dean must be crazy. Having figured out why the voice was familiar. He hadn’t thought about that memory is ages and after remembering it after so long, he probably wouldn’t have been able to identify it.
“They threatened me, Raphael and Michael. If I did not do as they said-” He was cut off by a loud bang. For a split second, everything was frozen in time, Dean bracing for the pain.
“Look here pretty boy, I’m gonna save you a whole lot of trouble,” she started. “You need to go home and kiss the man,”
“Just keep going, don’t look back,” Dean commented, finally pressing the end button. “Go!”
“The game. It’s real,” he whispered between them. Castiel moved back, taking in Sam’s scared expression. “Those characters are real people. The maze is filled with creatures,”
“My Liege, it’s in regards to the prisoner,” the man spoked out before Castiel could continue his prior discussion. He watched the Alpha lean forward in his seat, his interest perked. “He says he’s ready to talk,”
“Go,”
“All that prep and still so tight,” Castiel murmured, pulling out before slamming back in causing Dean to let out a strangled yelp.
With little light the outside world provided, he was able to see a man standing there.
By his boss.
In here, the deserted hallway, he removed his hat and trench coat before checking the room key Crowley handed off to him.
The voice chuckled.
Pushing the heavy door open, he and Sam were met by an array of men bustling through the corridor, their father stood amongst them, their mother sitting on her throne. Watching. From the entrance, Dean could see worry and concern on her face clearer the closer he got.
“I’ll be fine, I have a car,” Castiel said in a clearer voice, holding up the glass, squinting at the contents before downing the rest in one go.
He had just managed to get the person loose, a freaking teenager of all things, and moving the body into hiding when an ear-splitting scream cut through the air. On instinct alone, Dean dropped the body to swing his rifle around aiming towards the source. The hand that’s not on the trigger reaching up to press the call button on the walkie.
"Lay down here," patting the pillows right against the headboard.
Castiel liked to believe this meter was a curse. Not so much a gift as it was praised when he first learned of its existence.
Dean stared down at his food, his stomach rumbling for sustenance but he couldn’t bring himself to eat.
"That's it," Dean said in a hushed voice, his hips starting up their thrusting movement. "Just a little louder,"
"Sorry about the prolonged appointment," he commented, referring to the wait time for his services.
“Watch out! It's very high up here!” A figure emerged from the darkness which made Dean’s heart thump as he took in the man before him, the voice was familiar, he wore nothing but a poorly wrapped cloth covering his nether regions.
A screeching noise woke Dean from that memory, feeling a tear slip from his eyes as he tried to move.
“I told you, from that day on I would protect you in return. I would take care of you and your family. Have I not done just that? I helped pay for your brother’s University tuition. I helped your parents get out of debt. I made sure that you were well taken care of.” He felt lips pressing just below his ear and again along his jawline, eyes closing. “I’ve taken very good care of you.” He felt lips press to his.
“Wait-what!?” Dean stuttered out, turning back to the closed door and back to the blacked-out room.
He had to breath. In through his nose and out through his mouth.
“You adjusted quickly. Besides, we’re already ten minutes in,” Castiel replied, uncapping the lube again, squirting a generous amount onto the metal plug. “And you always have trouble with this part,” he rubbed his gloved hand over it, trying to warm it the best he could.
Eyes squinted and head tilted to the side, Dean realized two things:
The creature spoke in a smoky voice, full of want and desire as it rubbed Dean through his pants. Dean trying hard to resist, willing to the blood to fly south at the sensation.
"Possibly," and Dean proceeded to tell them about the betrayal and everything else Castiel had told him.
“You know it,” Giving a wobbly grin, glancing at his brother then back.
Off to the left was a zig-zag line going into a house, a sign off to the side of the door saying "Meet Santa,"
“Y-yes, please,” green eyes looked at him, voice begging.
He pushed it back as he looked back down at his book.
“With seven wins-”
“Don’t delete the game,” the first words he was able to get out, turning his attention to look around the semi-empty restaurant.
He moaned into his pillow, moving his hand down to sweep over his length to rid the sensation.
“Pull me in!” he screamed out to the men, standing up in the boat and pulling out his sword.
The feeling continued on for the next sennight.
“I guess,” not sure how to go about this. “Just, text me when you get home and tell me how you’re feeling. You have my cell. But I’m giving you homework tonight,”
“He looks pretty lean, does he have abs? Can you shred cheese on them?”
He leaned back in his seat, staring off into the night, admiring the glow of the moon as he relished in the utter bliss of his freedom.
"This seems more Valentines than it is Christmas," he pointed out.
The room was dark when he entered. He had made sure to shut the door as quietly as possible, but the rustling of sheets behind him signaled that he wasn’t as quiet as he’d hoped.
The church before him stood tall, with one of those crosses that stood at the tippy top of the tower. Painted white with stained glass on all the windows and the large oak door separating the world outside.
“You will not,” John said, his tone harsher than Dean was anticipating. “You are to stay here. My men will suffice,” Dean watched his father rub at his face, plopping himself ungracefully into his seat as his mother reached over to rub his shoulders.
How Castiel isn't appalled by how Dean Winchester eats is amazes him.
Click. Fuck.
Coughing as he straightened himself out, he proceeded down the hallway to the library where his people waited to discuss their next plan of action.
"What exactly do you want?" Dean's firm voice asked, getting right to the point.
“Fighting out of the blue corner, weighing in at 195, all the way from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, a winning streak of 6 and 2, Bennnnnnnt Lafitte!” the man across from him raised his arms, turning around to acknowledge the crowd.
“No…” his voice sounded dejected which had Castiel raising a brow. “I was trying to cheer you up,” he continued.
"I don't blame you," Eldon spoke, the hand that was gripping his hair moved to caress the side of Castiel's cheek. "Of all my little toys, you picked a good one." Castiel shuddered at the term. This was not his choice. None of it.
Castiel made a victorious noise when he managed to clear away the stubborn mess. He climbed down off the counter, throwing the paper towels in the trash before turning, jumping slightly when he noticed Meg staring at him. She was leaning on the countertop, cheek resting in the palm of her hand, giving him an expectant look.
Past their smiles, he’s noticed something about their appearances.
The gate closed and locked behind him, spurring the adrenaline inside that this was really happening. His eyes finally landing on his opponent before him when the cheering dulled when the referee stood in the middle, the announcer holding up the microphone.
“Why don’t you lay back down?” their voice soothing as if sensing his distress.
“You alright,” Replacing the rag over his shoulder.
That and they are able to do a deep cleaning of their workspace, which meant cleaning under and above the machines.
Dean gave him a cocky smile, almost posing with his dick standing at attention with the condom on before grabbing Cas’ legs, pulling him to the edge of the bed. He pushed one Cas’ legs up to his chest while the other was wrapped loosely around Dean’s left leg.
And thank you for all the amazing comments <3 <3 <3
Castiel was glad that he didn’t run into anyone on the way out. ‘Small victories’ he thought while grabbing his bike. He flinched every now and then at the sudden pull in his leg as he peddled to the coffee shop, a trip that took twenty minutes, thirty depending on traffic. If people would let him cross at the intersection.
He truly loved the girl, but after a one night stand, they realized they were just better off as friends. With a mutual booty call every now and then of course.
I mean, he’s tough as nails. And he’s taken lumps harder than being thrown against a tree.
The next moment...he can't exactly describe it.
Dean froze.
“I’m allowed to be, I have gotten
He hadn't noticed the man had knelt in front of him, but the gaze from those blue eyes made him forget everything.
‘Why?’
‘What the hell…’ the distant thought floated in his mind, his body felt like it was weightless in the darkness surrounding him.
This song.
"Hey!" Shouting to gain their attention, aiming the gun to fire off a few rounds.
“You’re not going to die,” Dean insisted, replacing his hand over both wounds, a green glow emitting from them. His attention moved from Bobby’s face to the wound. Beneath his hands, he watched the wounds slowly heal just as the man’s eyes closed. In a panic, Dean felt around Bobby’s neck, breathing a sigh of relief when he felt a pulse.
“But I got more M&M’s down your shirt.”
Probably the safest bet, being out in the open could be a risk of getting caught.
“How can I not be?” he answered simply while watching her flick her dark hair over her shoulder. She gave him a knowing smirk. “With him by my side, I will be invincible.”
An indication Castiel kept written in the margin of his notebook, the distant look in his eyes when he had said it the first time.
“Why?”
“John didn’t know anything. It was Mary.” Confused, Dean pulled his hand from Bobby’s as he stared in disbelief. “Mary was the one to come to me. Pleading with me that I keep this a secret from not only you but the King. John thought you were human the entire time.”
Gagging from the site, he was frozen in fear. He wanted to run but his feet wouldn’t move. The wind picked up, even more, Dean noticing how it all rushed towards the spot of the broken vase.
“Dean, I rescued you. Don't be foolish!”
I mean, this guy had been staring at Dean all evening.
Castiel had never seen this look on Dean’s face, he hated it. He wanted the smile and bright eyes that Castiel had gotten used to.
Gripping Dean’s hips, he began slowly. Picking up the pace the more comfortable he felt Dean get. Revealing in the small gasps and moans he elicited, his hands moving up to Dean’s shoulders, gripping them as he picked up the pace.
“Have a good day,” The customer said with a smile, the other two people having gotten up from their seats to leave with him.
“So beautiful,” he heard Dean’s voice praise in awe when Castiel felt the toy slip in easily, taking the length deeper and deeper.
Castiel stopped in the middle of picking a flower, a  sudden bolt, his control of the dragon slipping slightly. His body feeling hot as he turned his gaze to his hand. The flowers sizzling before erupting into flames.
Usually, he loves the thrill of the fight, the struggle from his prey, but he wasn’t in the mood. Hearing their moan after sinking his fangs did irk him. Just an absent reminder of his mate upstairs.
It was his fault, of course. He let this all happen. He wanted to scream into the heaven’s, to curse the man himself about why this had to happen. He didn’t want to kill anyone. Let alone...
But throughout the tavern dwellers, there sat one man among them all who sat calmly, sipping from his chalice. His men were gathered around him, quietly whispering to one another over frivolous things as if the news didn’t bother them one bit.
the voice cooed, Dean gasping as an icy hold grasped his cock, running slowly along the length.
Dean ran a hand through his hair, thinking absently that he needed a haircut. The fear of having hair like Sam’s freaked him out.His father, after he was able to recover, had been banned from leaving the castle grounds.
Placing his hand on the back on the man’s neck.
A low moan from the man below signaled that he was getting used to it.
They moaned as Dean pressed in, easing himself inch by inch. Castiel letting his head drop to the mattress, reveling in the feel. He tried not to think about how long it’s been since he’s had a good fuck.
Nodding his hand, making the connection, he allowed Dean to tie it around his head successfully covering his eyes.
Despite the room being pitch black, Castiel was able to see him clear as day. Bed hair, sleepy eyes, but it was the lust blown pupils that had Castiel's heart stutter for a moment.
Dean had just managed to get his heart to calm down only for it to jump right back up to a heart attack.
Castiel loving the breathy sighs into the kiss as he changed his pace as he stroked the man.
One hand gripping Dean's left shoulder, the other holding onto his forearm for dear life as Dean continued the rocking motion.
“Either he got lost or was hungry enough to eat it raw,” laughed the second, removing his hood to reveal a mess of black hair and a scruffy gray beard.
He nearly jumped when a low chuckle sounded right next to his ear. Bolting upright, eyes wide open, he looked around the room.
“I fail to see how this,” pointing to his newly acquired hat. “Will change my mind.”
“I’m sorry,” he whispered regretfully, leaning forward instead to place a kiss on his forehead.
Placing the toy with the plug on the towel, he folded the cloth over them nicely before placing the bundle into his bag.
“I-I don’t understand,” Feeling the hand ghost it’s way further south, tangling themselves in the coarse happy trail.
Always punctual.
Giving the lightly tanned ass a good firm squeeze that earned him the sound he wanted, adding to high.
Eyes easily adjusting to the change in lighting, he spotted the prisoner in question.
Sure enough, neon signs in front of blacked-out windows.
“Uh, Cas, the last person who looked at me like that...I got laid,” An attempt at humor at a time like this, Dean needed to work on his timing. In response, a second finger was added, causing Dean to lose his train of thought, moaning at the intrusion.
That earned him a particularly sharp inhale.
Corny.
"Who-"
Which is what Castiel was aiming for.
“That’s true,” She started slowly as if trying to soothe the savage beast from attacking. “It might just be a setback-"
This one couple wasn’t exactly rare, though it put him in an awkward position. The women whose meter was high while the male was somewhere between middle and low.
the voice growing closer, the gooseflesh on Dean’s arms raising.
“Dean, always a pleasure,” Castiel’s back was still turned as he refocused on the matter at hand. The notebook for this session. Rifling through until he found W for Winchester, he picked it and turned towards the man.
“I told you specifically not to let him in!” Bobby all but shouted, the three of them were huddled in the main room while their unexpected guest was placed in one of the “guest” rooms.
“That’s good,” he folded his hands together in his lap, glancing down at his watch. “We’ve made quite a breakthrough today. We have thirty minutes left in your session. What would you like to talk about?”
That only seemed to encourage Cas to go faster, his hips stuttering not too long after. Feeling that dick throb in his ass would make Dean cum again if the pain from his ass wasn’t settling in.
He needn’t worry about people seeing him since the window and himself were high enough that no one would be able to tell. The village, if he could call it that, seemed to be tents. Fires pits scattered amongst them with people-no...creatures surrounding them. Walking between the rows, eating at makeshift tables, some looked to practicing with one another using swords or barehanded.
When Dean first came to him, he was attracted to him at first glance. He had to squash all those feelings down because he was, at the end of the day, a professional.
“Dean,” green eyes shifted towards the source, his head a little woozy from the hits, to find Bobby right next to him.
"D-Dean! What is this!" Castiel's eyes wide, frantically looking down at the now ring of fire and the man before him.
“How are you feeling, sweetheart,” his mother, Queen Mary asked, placing a hand on top of his with a small smile after he took his seat across from her.
“What kind of game is it?” Hannah inquired, pausing in highlighting something on the paper.
“Tough luck there. You’re gonna have to kill me then because their’s no way I’m agreeing to that,”
Unlocking the screen he found that the game was still open. The little blobby character was moving up and down slowly, the health bar in the red.
Letting out a deep breath he hadn’t realized he’d be holding, he let the man go. Watching the trainee stand up quickly, bow with a fist on his chest before walking away.
And he came.
“Put that away,” snapped the first, sitting up abruptly, his hood falling back to reveal long red hair, pointy ears peeking through the long locks.
Meanwhile, the sun was setting lower and lower into the horizon until it disappeared completely. The street lights of the parking lot illuminating the spots here and there.
"Eldon-"
Watching the small silver plug inch it's way deeper into the man, Castiel had to look away.
Dust lingering in the air.
She won’t even let him touch her.
Just before they got to the bunker, Cas remembered something while he was possessed. Not really wanting to get into details with Sam at the moment, salt kept the demons at bay. Followed by other useful things he picked up.
“Out!” Castiel commanded, watching them jump at the tone before making their way through the kitchen door.
“Duck!”
“Forget” as a soft blue light glowed softly from his palm.
He watched him move quickly to the piece of furniture without complaint, tearing the wrapper and sliding the condom on.
Veins turning to ice at the site of a Dragon appearing in the sky above.
What he wasn’t expecting was Dean’s gaze to land on him. The arrow shifting slightly higher than he’s seen it before.
“Move up,” Castiel ordered, watching Dean move farther up on the bed. Shifting out of his shoes, Castiel moved onto the bed as well, one knee between Dean’s legs and the other on the outside. Placing one hand on Dean’s lower back, he placed the instrument at the entrance.
He heard something 'clink' by his feet. Dean's heart sunk when he saw that it was the ocarina. Looking up, he was nearly blinded by fire erupting from within a small narrow passage. Dean staring in horror and sadness at the realization that it was over, a tear slid down his cheek.
The ride in the Dragon’s claws uncomfortable as Dean was carried away, the familiar tugging after each beat of its wings.
There was silence between the two, Alastair keeping to himself by the stairs as a slow smile spread across Castiel’s lips.
“You’ve had this planned out already,” watching Dean pause in his unpacking of the box, a string of lights in his hand.
With little encouragement, Cas went with it until the two met in the middle for a long kiss.
“You know you don’t have to ask to spoon afterward,” Dean teased in response after gathering up his clothes.
“If you didn’t betray me. Who then?” Gaze dragging away from the chair, green eyes met blue. Perhaps in an act of defiance or to prove a point, who knows. His mind drawing a blank from the adrenaline pumping through his veins. If he moves, he wouldn’t make it out of the doors before being dragged back in by the goons that guard the door.
“-I can’t,” his voice coming out scared, trembling as the conversation continued. His mind was a mix of emotions as he fought the internal rage that was slowly growing. Clawing its way to the surface.
Heaven by Kane Brown
The Demon's smirk grew wider, eyes nearly squinted with how wide the smile was.
The gentlemen who gave him the ‘M’ was pleasant, nice even. Handsome too wearing a business suit, clean-shaven. But something just seemed off with the guy and it made Dean shutter. The stiffness of the handshake and the intense look.
His younger brother had teased him relentlessly about this fake “Love at first sight” ordeal. But he didn’t care. He was 18 and his fiance was all he could think about. They would live happily over at Michael’s village, the trade between the two will grow stronger. The villages merging to become one over time.
He was taught by his parents from a young age that he would take over as a personal servant to the Winchester family once they were able to retire.
The guy looked down, a hand rubbing anxiously at the back of his neck.
“Did-did you know about this?” Dean asked, head tilting to the side in confusion. He had his pants on as well but his shirt hung loose in his hand as he waited for Castiel to answer.
They finished their cookies as they sipped on their hot chocolates, making their way to the entrance to the trail of lights.
The words hung in the air, Dean could feel his heart begin to race. He felt like he couldn't breathe. It’s like he could feel the tension between the voices.
“Nice ‘n easy there,” a nasally sounding voice chimed in through the quiet. Dean noticed the men around the campfire sit up at the sound. Taking a deep breath, careful not to move his neck too much, he slowly stood at the order of the man behind him with his hands raised.
“Relax,” he soothed, pushing in slowly after watching those shoulders slack. He watched as his cock slowly disappeared into Dean, groaning low in his throat after being fully sheathed.
That’s not good.
He felt something knock at him behind his knees, causing him to crash onto his knees abruptly.
“They’re real,”
At that, Sam slumped onto the cot with an exhausted sigh, not even bothering to cover himself with the paper-thin blanket they had laying across it. Smirk turning into a smile, Dean grabbed a rifle and slinging it over his shoulder before shutting the cabinet doors and tucking his 9mm into the waistband of his jeans.
“An artifact was stolen,” John spoke, cutting off his son mid tangent. “And not just any artifact,” just then, Bobby appeared by John’s side, a grim look on his face that Dean hadn’t seen since the passing of his wife.
Crap, even his voice seemed vaguely familiar. Running a hand through his hair, Dean’s gaze went everywhere but towards the man before him, even lingering on the camera in the top corner for a moment before turning his eyes to the floor.
Taking in that naturally tanned skin, freckles that covered his body, the small blush on the man’s face as he leaned over the seat.
What if Castiel didn't feel the same?
It didn't take long for the door to swing open, revealing a handsome man with nothing on but gray sweats, his lightly tanned skinned torso with freckles everywhere, sandy brown hair and the greenest eyes Castiel has ever seen.
“It doesn’t matter, I might delete it,” Pushing his phone into his bag, he pulled his textbook closer to him.
“Leave now, before it comes back,” the voice was gruff, gravelly sounding.
Now here she is, feeling the waves of negative energy spewing from the man.
“I don’t understand that reference,” he said in confusion, trying to understand what she was talking about.
“You’re bigger than I thought,” Castiel purred, taking in the sight before him.
It didn’t take long.
"I told you, this a better position," taking the distraction to tie the other arm. "What? Has no one done this to you?” Castiel questioned. “Please tell me you haven’t been doing doggy style this entire time?”
“You weren’t in a prison”
This whole thing was a load of bullshit.
“Your highness,” The voice called again, Dean turned to see a servant standing at the entrance to the library. “Your father has requested your presence,” he said with his head bowed in respect for disturbing the moment.
"Good morning, sweetheart," he cooed, lifting a hand to stroke the others cheek.
"I think you're wrong-"
He watched his brother as he finally regained his composure, slowly rising to his feet. One hand on his neck as he massaged the abuse while his other began emitting a soft orange color. Eyes narrowing when his eyes landed on Dean.
“And you’ve been my friend since I was able to walk and talk,” Balling his hands into fists, Castiel closed his eyes, wishing it was enough to block out whatever else Dean was going to say.
Today was just...another day.
Why did it feel like his shift was taking forever to start?
He glanced down at his left hand, the bandages had just been changed before he left. He still mentally scolded himself for not paying attention to what he had been doing since he was old enough to walk. Bobby was concerned, more so annoyed that Dean was gonna get blood on the shop floor.
Dean thought to himself, groaning at the feeling, trying to push back at the sensation. Two strong hands on either side of his ass kept him still, kneading the meat there just before he felt that tongue push past the ring of muscle.
Right to the point.
Then this couple.
“I haven’t been feeling all that great,” Dean commented offhandedly, leaning against the bedpost with his arms crossed as well, a brief image of his brother making things float in the library drifted into his mind. He avoided eye contact with the man to sit on the edge of the bed to put his boots on.
‘Don’t look up, don’t look up’ he chanted in his head, feeling the weight of the situation settling in his stomach.
Looking at the number that appeared, Castiel squinted at it, not making a connection to who it could be. He glanced around the restaurant, glad that it was a slow day before swiping open the screen.
“Save the games for when you go on break or after work,” Michael commented, propping the door open for Castiel to get through.
He felt...comfortable.
Castiel has been the Maître D of the local "The Corner Place" restaurant for three years now. He moved from the busy city of New York to the quiet workings of Lawrence, Kansas.
Whoever had left Cas here was in a hurry. The back door was wide open. Or a trap. Every horror movie flashed through Dean's mind as he placed both hands on his gun while he took a step inside.
All teeth, biting, Dean's hand pulling the man as close as possible. Castiel moaning into the kiss as their cocks brushed against each other.
“First, music. Gotta set the mood,” he moved away from Cas to the cassette player under the TV, turning to volume up and the sound of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” playing on the speakers. “And-” he came back, reaching inside the box. “Mistletoe,” Castiel watching him pull out what looked like a bunch of leaves with fake berries, tied together by a red ribbon and holding over the two of them.
" Castiel cocked his head toward the sound.
Right as the man had gotten home, shutting the front door, Dean was on him. Only pausing to allow Cas to put his stuff down so they could continue.
He shook his head, not quite over the fact. Last week when he met up with Gabriel it was green, all the way to the right. He shouldn’t have confided in the man because he does it on purpose now.
They bowed before turning to leave him in peace. He really did not want to deal with this right now. Just sitting here was barely keeping his head straight. He needed contact with his mate. Even just to see him might curb some of that craving.
Hearing how they’ll take revenge on the assailant and send out search parties.
Dean’s hand froze on Castiel’s crotch, blue eyes locking with green as he lapped at the digit, giving it a hard suck. Taking the momentary pause from the man, Castiel brought his hands up to curl them into the lapels of Dean’s suit, receiving a yelp in surprise when Castiel turned the man so that was pressed against the table.
"D-Dean-"
“This is not a job for a Prince to lose his life over,” John continued. Was that concern in his eyes? Dean observed, noticing his mother grip tightening on his father’s arm.
“None of your business,” Dean commented, tearing at his ceremonial robe, twisting and braiding it with the rest of the strips to become a tightly woven rope.
He felt his forearm move to his right, followed by a hissing noise coming from somewhere sending a cold chill throughout his body right as the arm dropped again.
Not to mention that ghostly chill that seemed to find itself on his body at the most inopportune time. He’d be discussing something and what felt like a hand sliding over his nipple.
