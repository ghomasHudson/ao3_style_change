Dean took a breath. He didn’t like lying to this guy. It didn’t sit right. But there was no getting past it, he certainly couldn’t say, “I’m here because someone is murdering people and we think it might be a ghost or other supernatural bad guy and we gank those things for a living.” So instead, he spun the lie he and Sam had told a dozen other shop owners earlier that day, that he and his brother needed a break from their pest control business and thought they’d get away from the rat race and hike the mountains a bit.
“That’s enough. We’re here to practice, not gossip. From the top,” Pamela said. The phrase ‘from the top’ had never sounded so freaking beautiful.
“What is it that you’re scribbling in your notebooks all the time? And remember the full truth, not just ‘stuff,’” Sarah said.
In the peaceful town of Lawrenceville, there lived an ordinary boy on an ordinary farm. He had an ordinary family and lived an ordinary life. It was all rather... ordinary. Even his name was ordinary—Dean, he was called.
“Shit!” Dean cursed loudly as one of the damned winged beasts dived for his head. At least he assumed it was a beast. The sun was down and the rain was blocking moonlight and starlight, obscuring his vision.
Charlie elbowed Castiel while Pamela flipped back to the right page in the sheet music. “Dean, huh?”
Dean had collapsed in despair the moment he’d read the article. Dad, keeping a level head, had dashed to town and requested the ship manifesto. Though Dean had already assumed the worst, it still came as a shock to the heart when Dad told him with watery eyes that Castiel had indeed been a passenger on
“What would you prefer I call you? Sir?” Dean teased. Castiel's eyes dilated and Dean knew the answer. He groaned. “Do we need a safe word?”
He let himself picture two perfectly blue eyes, let his mind recall the pressure of Castiel’s toned body pressed into his, the way his slim digits had run through his hair. He let his mind wander, imagining those fingers elsewhere, sliding further, reaching his hole. Lube and skin and heat and a careful press. A cock –Cut? Uncut?- pushing into him-
“Dude,” Dean said, cutting him off. “You’re not serious, are you?” He was hoping Castiel would laugh at his own tease, but two blue eyes blinked at him slowly. “Cas. I want
“Cas,” Dean groaned, “you never say that. Wasn't that the first thing they taught you in pirate school?”
Right now though, Castiel’s emotions weren’t a mystery. He was angry and feeling useless. Dean would feel the same way if it was him. “Look,” Dean added, “You’re helping by being here, painting wards. Just. Call, if you think of something, or someone comes in that makes your spidey senses tingle.”
They left the albino on the ground and got the Man in Black up the stairs, placing him in the wheelbarrow the albino had conveniently left for them. Sam wheeled it while Kevin walked next to him, retracing the path from which they'd just come.
Dean glanced in the mirror. Cas was smirking. Dean smiled back, fully aware it was entirely for his own benefit as Cas couldn’t see his face.
“Rhonda Hurley,” Dean said. Only it came out raspy and he had to cough to clear his throat and repeat himself.
“Every moment,” Castiel panted as Dean switched to his right hipbone, “with you, is worth remembering.”
Dean was sprawled in the seats, watching the cast make asses of themselves. Castiel looked for Dean and was surprised to find him already looking back. When he met Dean’s gaze, he blushed and looked away sharply.
He pulled his finger out and pushed it back in. Again and again, Dean relaxing more and more on each thrust. Then Cas turn his finger and pressed down, and… oh holy shit.
Castiel’s heart had been pounding in his ribcage for a while now. He knew, the second he was called, he was going to have to pick dare. After seeing Dean walk out of the bathroom with his jeans hung low enough on his hips that he could just make out the pink satin beneath, there was no way he could ever pick truth. There was too much he could reveal.
One final arrow went past Dean’s head, and the last beast, which he hadn’t even noticed at his shoulder, fell off and vanished in a poof.
Dean had been sitting in a tavern when the news first came in. Well, it was gossip, but in his line of work, that was the best way to find quests for him and his party.
“Hello, Darlings,” Crowley crooned. He pulled his sword out and raised it high. “To the death, then.” He nodded his head to the side, realizing he'd already killed Castiel once. “Again.”
Gabriel yanked the coat out of their hands when they got back, and then petted it gently and reverently. He hadn’t been too thrilled about having been left out of the process, but Dean could tell he was too happy to have Anna’s coat back to care too much. He mostly wished he could have been there to rip Marv’s balls off.
“Cas,” Dean whispered, pulling him to the side the second they were in the hallway, “These aren’t robberies. Someone is looking for something.”
Castiel’s back bowed sharply off the bed, a high-pitched whine breaking through. “Stop that.” He pushed at Dean’s shoulder. “I don’t want to come yet.” Dean hummed around his dick, eliciting another whine. “Deeean.”
The thrusts got deeper before they became faster and Dean felt like Castiel’s cock was all there was in the whole damn universe. Then the archer got creative and used a hand to push Dean’s leg up, spreading him wider and changing the angle
As Dean predicted, he could barely stomach the beer and the celebratory cheers from the tavern folk. There was little worry about what had just happened, which made Dean wonder if they were used to random attacks by strange creatures. Some towns seemed to be more susceptible than others.
Dean beat Cas to the restaurant. He wasn't anxious exactly. He'd simply showered, picked out the jeans that hugged his ass like saran wrap that even Sam didn't know he'd packed, a close fitting t-shirt without blood stains or rips, brushed his teeth, shaved, slapped on some aftershave, and headed straight out.
Sam crossed his arms and didn’t respond. Dean didn’t understand the behavior. Keeping the fact that he had met Castiel from Sam had been one of the most difficult things he’d ever done, mostly because he assumed Sam would have been ecstatic to know he wasn’t a myth.
Dean’s grin dropped. “I was teasing, Cas. I’ve known Jo since I was two. She can be terrifying, especially if you try to take her juice pack. But trust me, Cas, she’ll have your back on that stage.”
Gadreel, who was also sitting slightly outside of the larger circle, spoke up. “I wouldn’t put too much thought into it.”
A farm house on the outskirts of town came into view, along with a quaint little barn. Dean quirked his eye at Cas, Castiel glanced from the barn to Dean, and nodded.
Sam sighed, but didn’t complain. He only had one laptop and even if Dean wanted to research the old fashioned way, the bars and restaurants weren’t a bad place to learn the local gossip and secrets. Particularly after a few beers, people let things slip.
She turned and left, jogging to catch up to Charlie, leaving Castiel alone with his thoughts and Dean’s smile.
Dean stared at his phone for a moment before looking up to Sam, who was waiting patiently. “Cas says Daniel Ogle may be next. Like, tonight, next.”
It was as much as he dared say, but the uptick of the corner of Castiel's mouth told him that Cas had understood and remembered the promise Dean had made when they were first reunited. That he wouldn't forget that nothing could stop True Love.
Castiel moved behind the counter while Mr. Peters looked at Sam and Dean questionably. Their rough jeans and worn plaid layers didn’t exactly fit in the well-lit, exquisitely gilded art gallery. Castiel bent behind the counter and came back up with a medium sized landscape. Dean could make out the symbols layered in the paint. Then again, he noted, most of the paintings in the shop seemed to have them.
“What is it about you, Dean Winchester?” Castiel asked. He knelt over Dean, planting a knee on both sides of his legs, bending over to crawl carefully up Dean’s body. Dean laid back and let him. “Why am I so pulled to you?”
He left before Dean could reply. Which was perfectly fine with Dean. He had no idea what he would have said anyway.
With his hair a mess, eyes glazed over, and lips red and puffy, Castiel looked like the epitome of a sex god. Dean couldn’t resist pulling Castiel down and meeting him for a deep, quick, sloppy kiss.
Dean nodded into Cas’s neck as fingertips trailed gently down his back. “Rarely, but yeah. If I’ve been on edge for a while, and the top can last long enough.”
A hand patted his thigh gently in commiseration, and when Dean looked to Cas, he smiled weakly but said nothing. After a moment, he turned to look out the window.
“You've been a loyal dog, and as my chief enforcer, I'm going to trust you with some information,” Crowley began, from behind his desk. It was a big, intimidating desk, and he enjoyed the additional authority it imbued him with. “Assassins from Guilder have infiltrated the Thieves Forest and plan on ruining my wedding by killing my intended.”
“Hey,” Sam greeted him. He was standing next to the couch where Daniel was now sitting with a blanket wrapped tightly around himself. Catherine was standing behind the couch, a comforting hand on Daniel’s shoulder. “Catherine has something you should hear.”
Somehow, Dean felt responsible. Which was ridiculous. Castiel had auditioned of his own volition, and he took the part. Of his own volition. Sure, Dean had nudged him, but it’s not like he’d twisted the guy’s arm.
“Name?” she asked. It struck Castiel as unfriendly, but that was probably more his own perception affected by his utter terror than anything else.
“How are you not melting your balls off?” Dean asked. Castiel made a small noise of confusion, so Dean added, “Never mind, go back to sleep Cas.” He hummed contentedly and the sound of heavy breathing filled the air once more.
Castiel turned around and his gaze darted to Dean in the water, hovering briefly on the mark on Dean’s shoulder, before flittering quickly away and darting every which way around the room, as if he had no idea what to do with himself. He was flushed and awkward and palmed nervously at his neck.
Castiel’s eyes drifted over to the other wing where Dean was leaning against a table that was about to go out on stage. Kevin must have seen because he made a humming sound that sounded a bit too much like understanding.
“What did you buy those for?” he asked. Castiel was holding two long swords, both with scabbards attached.  “
He slid them on and bit back a moan as the cool, satiny material rested against his most intimate bits. His dick was a little squished and his balls weren’t quite fully contained, but the fabric was so soft he didn’t care.
“I've got it,” he said to the two goons. “Let me handle him.” He didn't wait for confirmation, just strode straight through the wrecked entrance door, and right up to Kevin. “I've got this,” he said to the three men that were still fighting him. They fled without further prompting.
“Nooo!” Castiel screamed from the other side of the grave, arm raised, palm out, as if reaching for Dean. He turned just in time to see Gatlin, behind him, bend over as if in pain.
They kissed again, and for all they knew, this one lasted for hours, they were so lost in the press of tongue and swiped kitten licks, the caress of hands and squeeze of arms.
Dean paused. “I only told you a month ago,” Dean finally responded. He met Sammy’s sympathetic stare over the car.
“Dean, I’ve been human more years than I was a seal. That life is behind me. Sure, I take cruises, sometimes I miss the sea, but I like my legs. I like this body. I like what I can do with it, with you. I am human. I just happen to have an ability you don’t have. When you told me who you were, I thought it meant you would understand the difference between a monster and what I am.”
The elderly woman from next to him coughed and spoke. “Anniversary trip?” she asked them, blotting her mouth with a napkin. At Dean's look of confusion, she clarified. “Well it's clearly not the honeymoon. If you forgive the assumption, it looks more like you're trying to rekindle the fire, not running with the flames.”
Well, Dean sure would have been intimidated by the way he growled out the command. As it was, the voice and the stance the man was adopting, confident, strong, but relaxed, was already peeking his less-than-noble interest. But apparently Mr. Bad Tan wasn’t having the same reaction and took a swing instead.
Dean nodded. Cas had heard him complain about this a few times before, ever since Kristin and her boyfriend had split. Dean had always managed to dodge Paul’s propositions just in time, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t frustrating, and Cas had always been there to listen. He’d never had much to say on the matter, which annoyed Dean more than was reasonable.
It certainly didn’t make the panic any better, so what good was it? All it did was add to the confusion. Dean had rejected him, he didn’t get to look concerned.
“I got the lead,” Castiel explained, straightening once more. Dean’s hand pulled away hesitantly this time, like he wasn’t quite sure he could trust Cas to stand on his own accord. Like he was dealing with a crazy person.
There was a bang as the headboard slammed into the wall, the two lovers rolling without a concern in the world until Castiel was on top of Dean, straddling him, pelvic bone to pelvic bone. He wasted no time sucking a nipple into his mouth while thrusting down with his cock. Dean’s own rubbed alongside the silky hard flesh, pressed between their hot bodies, and he threw back his head and howled, burying his fingers tightly in Castiel’s hair.
“I just know you, Cas. Like I know you’re more embarrassed I got it right on a guess than you are about the tie.”
Which is why it came as such a shock when he awoke the next morning and Castiel was gone. He'd left Dean nothing but a note.
Sam nodded, completely unsurprised. “That confirms it. But Dean, there’s more to this, and it’s not looking good.”
“It’s not…” Dean started. He sighed. Cas deserved an explanation. He grabbed another bucket and pulled it up to Cas, taking a seat. “It’s not anything personal, Cas. My dad hates musicals, that’s all. Thinks only girls and weak men do musicals. He’d flip if we came home and were singing La Vie Bohème together.”
“And I know how much you like destroying it,” Castiel replied with an equally wide smile. “Especially when it leads to making out on my couch,” he added with a wink. Whatever had been on his mind earlier seemed to have passed.
Castiel swallowed, looking up. “I don’t know for sure what is going on, but you are right, I haven’t been honest with you.”
The Man in Black was bound in leather cuffs to a table at the side of the room. The strange suction cups attached to his chest were attached by a tubular cord to an intimidating machine next to the table. Sam was trying hard and failing miserably to not think about what the machine did when Kevin called out to him.
They departed before the sun was up. No one had been happy about that. Everyone had grumbled and complained, everyone except Castiel, who apparently didn’t sleep that much anymore either.
He had no idea how he was going to make it. He was going to die. On stage. And then die again. He didn’t even hear or acknowledge his cast mates as he moved into place.
Dean shook his head. “Victor’s parents aren’t quite as laidback as Ash’s, and they’re watching TV in the room where the stairs are.”
There was silence for a moment, which Dean took to mean that Castiel was letting the conversation drop. Something prompted Dean to speak anyway.
“Trust me,” Dean murmured. Castiel nodded. “Okay, Cas, just a reminder. I do like it rough, I can take you to the root, but if I can’t breathe for too long, I’ll snap my fingers twice.”
They ran through the ravine, tripping over rocks and crevices, Crowley's men still trying to find a way down the cliffs that didn't have a high chance of resulting in head trauma. Thus, Dean and Castiel were far ahead by the time the ravine widened and the ground rapidly turned to mush. They were in a swamp.
It didn’t move, so he pulled again. And again, until he nearly face planted with the counter force. Behind him, Charlie, Kevin and Sam were beginning to laugh. He turned to tell Cas that he was wrong when suddenly, Cas was beside him.
This needed to be fixed, so that others may enjoy Goldman's retelling of S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure, as I once had. This is that story.
Dean was trying not to chuckle, but he was failing. Castiel was pretty badass sometimes and Dean thought he might be a little in love with him.
He sucked Cas deeper on every thrust, and he could feel Cas shaking with the effort to let Dean control the tempo. It wouldn’t be long before he could let Cas take over, but Cas was bigger than he’d thought and he had to be sure he could handle—
Castiel was sucking marks into his abdomen, causing the muscles to twitch. While his tongue worked, his right hand slid up Dean’s thigh and straight to the button on his jeans. He popped the button before Dean’s hand was regretfully stilling Castiel’s.
“That,” Dean began, but he had to swallow again. He was lost in Castiel’s eyes, having a hard time focusing on what was such an important conversation. “That sounds good.”
“I'll go with you, but only on the condition that you swear not to hurt him. Return him to his ship, unharmed, and I'm yours,” Dean said, his heart shuddering in his chest. He was lying, of course, nothing would stop him from finding Cas again, even if they didn't take him to his ship as Crowley was about to promise.
Crowley scoffed. “Who gives a toss about the loser. The prince is what matters. We must retrieve Dean from what is clearly the work of Guilder.”
Dean looked over to Cas, his lithe form leaning on the counter now, his arms crossed. Dean licked his lips before glancing back to Sam. He wanted to say he had no idea what Sam was talking about, but it wasn’t the truth. He was more emotionally invested in Castiel than made any rational sense.
The waitress arrived with their main course and place two plates in front of them. The main dish was salmon.
For a sorcerer, he was pretty skilled with a sword. It didn’t help that Dean didn’t actually have that much practice. Azazel was pushing him back, testing his limits, and he wasn’t sure he could actually win this fight.
Cas shot Dean a warning glare and he clamped his mouth shut. There was fire in his eyes though. Fire and promise.
Dean’s shirt fell away as his lips were sealed with Castiel’s. He fumbled with Cas’s blue vest, distracted by the twist of Cas’s tongue in his mouth. He eventually got it unbuttoned but paused before removing it.
He stood in the wings of the stage, a couple classmates and dusty curtains serving for company, waiting for his turn to come. He could hear other auditions going on. Almost everyone was good. Really good.
And of course Dad was in the kitchen when Dean came in for the drinks. He was standing over the stove, getting a pot of water up to a boil. Two boxes of knock off mac and cheese sat to the side. His dad. Such a chef.
As Dean was only six when this all happened, he moved on a lot easier than his parents did, until having a brother was but a distant memory.
He was, to put it bluntly, the least qualified person in the history of Sir Francis High, to ever even consider putting his name on the audition list.
For the first time, Dean cursed his baby’s interior as he slid onto the black leather. It was boiling hot and provided at least one reason Dean should leave his shirt
Dean was, however, still staring at the recently deceased. Because Dean was a beautiful man, many incorrectly assumed he lacked intelligence. And he didn't try too hard to change that impression. The misconception had served him well. But he was, indeed, both smart and intuitive.
Castiel came just as beautifully as he did everything else. His cheeks and chest were flushed, his neck also showing signs of the heat in his veins as he threw his head back, mouth dropped open, and did just what did had asked– painted his chest with streaks of come.
Dean directed Sam back inside. The door clicked behind him, and he turned to look out the glass back to Castiel.
Kevin was by the fire, telling tales. It was what he did best, and it was strange how much power he could find in words. Using language alone, he could charm a horse breeder into selling his horse in exchange for a pair of trousers. Dean had witnessed it.
This time, the man did not laugh. “PRINCE Crowley Ferguson. Of Floren.” He bristled. “The country you live in,” he added. Dean had not been paying attention however and was petting Impala by the time Crowley had finished his grandstanding. “It's like talking to a squirrel,” Crowley muttered.
Castiel stopped abruptly this time, Dean crashing into him. “Same,” Castiel said, pressing kisses to Dean's lips. “No one. I spent every waking moment thinking of you, planning my way back to you.”
The woman looked up and Dean realized she was younger than he thought, with pretty blonde hair and soft green eyes. They were Dean’s eyes, nearly identical. It was one of the strangest feelings, like he was staring into a mirror of himself, only with the delicate features and angles of a woman.
“Yeah, exactly like Catherine Ogle,” Sam said. “She married into the name, but there’s no doubt her husband goes all the way back to Thomas Ogle as well.”
Crowley had taken them from the chapel to the audience outside and presented him. Almost everyone had cheered to a deafening roar.
“Dare,” Dean responded easily, still afraid of what a truth might pull out of him. No dare could be worse.
Dean closed the small distance between them and crashed their lips together. He pulled back just long enough to look Cas in his wide but hopeful eyes and say, “I had hoped too,” before diving back in.
“I—” Dean began, breaking off with a groan when Cas found another tender spot. “I wasn’t hiding it. Why do you keep bringing that up, anyway?”
Castiel smiled. A full smile with a little bit of nose crinkling and a little bit of gums. It made Dean smile back automatically.
Castiel’s hands left Dean’s butt and he probably should not be as disappointed about that as he was.
In hindsight, Dean should have seen it coming. Given all that Omiel was telling them, it really was the logical move. He took the blade from Dean’s throat and swiftly plunged it into his chest. It sliced right through bone and sinew, blood coming up Dean’s pipeways so fast he didn’t even get to scream.
Though he was wearing a black bandanna, Sam could see his eyebrows raise. “Is that so?” the man asked, his voice keen.
Around them, Crowley's men looked utterly unconvinced but said nothing. No one ever questioned Prince Crowley. The man soon to be king took pleasure in dealing pain, and woe be to him who volunteered for the pain by speaking up.
The source of that particular malfunction was a man leaning against the railing. He was a tall man, with dark hair and his head thrown back, exposing a strong jaw bone. His skin was kissed warm by the setting sun, skin that Dean instantly wanted to taste.
“Truth,” Chuck said with a small nod, affirming his own decision. It surprised no one. Chuck was not the most adventurous in the group, and he also seemed to be the one with the least to hide.
Castiel shook his head. “I’m afraid even if your enemy lost interest in you, that mark will only draw other supernatural beasts to you in time. The only way to be rid of it is if he removes it or is killed.”
Castiel’s desk is covered in books, causing Dean to hesitate. Toss the books off? Bend over them? He settles for the latter, bending over the pile and placing his hands on the outer edges, at the only two places not covered in literature.
Dean took a breath, prepared himself, wrapped two hands around the grip, yanked for all he was worth, and the blade slid out like the stone was nothing more than butter. Dean fell on his ass and didn’t even care. He was holding
They were tasty, but Dean found all of the flavored ones far too sweet for his tastes in liquor. All except for one. The apple pie flavored one, made of green apples instead of red and with a hint of caramel, was amazing. He groaned when he tried it.  Ava smirked knowingly at him. Either she was really good at her job, or she was angling for a four-way that was never going to happen. Sam was his brother, and he kind of wanted Cas all for himself. So shoot him.
Because I spend every second of every day resisting the urge to bend you over the couch and fuck you senseless?
“Thanks for joining me,” Castiel said, finally turning his head to meet Dean's eye. “Cards are much more interesting with a beautiful man by my side.”
“Dean!” a voice called out across the parking lot. It was Castiel. He jogged over. “Hey,” he said with a big grin. Then his eyes glanced over to Sam and his grin turned softer. “Sam, right?”
The way he added on the last part sounded forced and pointed, and a part of Dean knew what Cas was trying to say, but he didn’t really want to think about it.
Dean was standing firm by his assessment that the guy was hot. And now that he’s not choking on smoke, passing out, wearing a hospital gown, or drugged out of his mind, he was even hotter. Even from the back of the room Dean could tell the guy’s blue eyes were alive and sparkling. And though Dean didn’t have a clue what he was talking about, it didn’t matter. That deep, gravelly voice could read the phone book for all Dean cared. It’s a shame it will probably pass when the smoke damage is gone.
Charlie looked like she ate something that tasted like skunk. Which she had accidentally done once, it was kind of hilarious.
Sam explained everything. He explained that Abaddon was dead, and that Kevin must have passed him while he was dumping her body. He explained that it was Crowley's wedding day, and that he'd formed the Brute Squad to make it look like Guilder was hiding in the forest.
The rain, it seemed, was picking up, and it was time to get out of it. The air was not cold enough for the rain to be snow, but it was cold enough for it to be dangerous to be out in the rain for long without a cloak.
For a tense moment, Dean applied pressure while Castiel tried to slow down his breaths, taking deeper ones and sliding them out gently. He was in pain, and Dean knew it, and he could bite his own tongue off in worry.
“I’m still not sure I understand everything you find funny,” Castiel said. “But I’m glad you’re amused.” Then he added, “We need to find another place to sleep for the night.”
He just prayed his dad would be decent. John stood up to greet Castiel when they walked through the door. Or, more likely, he stood up to size up Dean’s new friend and decide if he was a problem or not.
He briefly wonders what all he was screaming as he tried desperately hard to reach his own prostate.
Dean looked equally as shocked when he spotted Cas on the other side of the room, his eyes roaming all over his body. It was the first time Castiel felt truly revealed in his outfit.
“For the prince?” she asked tentatively. The Man in Black nodded. “To the death?” She asked eagerly, again receiving a nod. “I accept.” She sheathed her dagger and grabbed Dean's rope, hauling him to his feet. She wrapped the length of rope around the nearest tree and bound him to it. “Now be a good, pretty little prince and stand here while I outsmart this man.”
Sam turned to him. “In the myth I know, while a female selkie is playing on the sand, a man steals her sealcoat. This binds her to him, and she is stuck with him until she can get her coat back. There are variations on the tale, but that’s the main gist.”
Castiel led him into the house. The entry way was open and airy. Open to the left was a sitting area with a couch, two green armchairs, and a TV mounted above a fireplace. From there, Dean could see the dining room with an arch, and another arch to the right of that and directly across from them showed a kitchen. There was probably no wall between them, though Dean couldn’t see that yet. There was a hallway leading away on the right, and immediately next to them, also on the right, was a door, cracked open by a few inches, revealing a small room. It was filled with a ginormous desk, books stacked everywhere, a monitor’s cool glow lighting the room, and a curly haired man passed out in front of it.
Castiel hummed contentedly before shifting in Dean’s arms to stare up at him. “Those attitudes reflect how human I am,” Castiel told him, like it wasn’t a big deal. “And how human I am is tied directly to my love for you. The closer we become to each other, the more I fall. I was nearly fully human when we first parted and it took a long time for that to change.”
“Stay safe,” Castiel said, promptly cutting the call off. He could still use a little work in the social niceties department. Dude sucked at goodbyes.
He was riding Nebula. After all these years, she had never left him, and Cas had never abandoned her.
“We’re brothers,” Sam supplied, an amused grin shot in Dean’s direction. The woman merely raised an eyebrow. “Uh. Non-romantically involved brothers.” When the woman continued to stare at him, he added, “I’m straight.”
“Well they certainly did cast Angel well,” said their ‘Roger.’ His name was as weird as Castiel’s own. Gadreel. Castiel felt sorry for the person having to type up their programs and show shirts. They were probably constantly spell checking the names.
Dean forcefully shrugged himself out of his stupor and grabbed the bag off the ground. He took out the gasoline and handed the bag to Sam, who grabbed the salt while Dean began soaking the bones. Sam began salting just as Dean finished with the gas. He spared a glance to Cas, who was still out-running and out-maneuvering Gatlin.  Shrugging it off once again, he fished for the matches and lit one.
Sam sighed and sat down on Dean’s bed. Dean really wished he’d leave the freaking room already so he could scream into his pillow a few more times, but apparently that was not going to happen.
They stopped when a cheery whistle, completely incongruent with the earlier wail, came from their left, and then a white skinned, fat little man rounded a tree and came into view pushing a wheelbarrow.
He really did have the worst luck in the world. His broke-as-dirt, drunk dad can’t hold a job for more than a week, he’s forced to steal to get by, so of course he would pick an evil sorcerer to pickpocket.
Dean and Castiel shared a quick glance, suddenly serious and considerably more sober. Without sharing a word, they both moved for the door.
Castiel cracked open his eyes and looked out into the audience. The room had maybe two dozen people in it, but every single person was on their feet.
Dean got off the bed and opened his closet door. On the back of the door was a poster of Frank-N-Furter that he displayed proudly.
Or at least, that's what it looked like to Metatron. Castiel slid his mind away, and while his body was going through the torments of The Machine, Castiel was completely divorced from the pain.
He’s off the desk and positioning himself over Castiel’s cock, his back to Castiel and ready to sit down on him, in the blink of an eye.
“I...” Dean started. “Like, James Bond? The spy?” When Castiel tilted his head in confusion, Dean added, “Seriously, you had to have at least heard of Skyfall! It was one of the best Bond movies of all time.”
“Why do you always assume I did something?” Dean asked, lifting his arm off of his eyes to peer at Sam.
“You wouldn't be so desperate if you had masturbated,” Castiel told him. “I must say, I'm impressed by your control, Dean. I didn't even ask you to do that.”
By the time Castiel had added a fourth, Dean honestly didn’t know if he was going to explode or scream. “Please,” he panted, his fingers sinking into Castiel’s shoulder. “Oh god, please.”
“The condom Dean. You forgot the condom,” Castiel says. Finally, Cas sounds a little wrecked himself. But he’s right, Dean did forget about the condom.
It didn’t take long for Dean to find himself rolling in laughter, the bed rocking with him. Castiel was laughing too, joining in Dean’s mirth. They bumped shoulders a few times, and more than once Castiel flung his hand out to slap Dean’s arm when something really good was coming up.
Of course what the scared soldiers could not see behind the ginormous form that was Sam in a cloak was Kevin pushing him on a wheelbarrow with Castiel tossed across his back.
“Oh fuck,” Castiel mumbles, completely lost in sensation, his movements erratic. “Dean, Dean, oh god, Dean.”
“Claire’s post. It says that the rabbit is going to the river, but not the elephants. And they all saw the same two monkeys. It would be ridiculous to infer otherwise. Therefore, there are only two parrots, one for each monkey. The answer is five.”
Something pulsed through him, a vague feeling, but enough. The pain in his stomach lessened just enough that he was able to rise to his feet.
Then Dean’s hand was finding Castiel’s and weaving their fingers together. He gave them a squeeze. “I already am.” A shiver went down his spine when he realized that Cas had actually blushed. This… this was a very dangerous game they were playing.
Dean kept Exortium in its scabbard as he adopted a casual, unaffected stance in the middle of the road. He checked behind him, but no one from town was headed south that morning. Thank god.
A hand was placed at Dean’s back a second before he felt Castiel’s cock at his hole. He was breached slowly, too slowly, and he tried to wiggle backwards.
Dean met his eye and broke out into a grin. Castiel paused. Then stumbled as he was nudged from the side.
Cas opened the door and Dean knew he was so royally fucked. Cas was wearing blue slacks that fit him like they’d been tailor made for him, and though he couldn’t see his ass, Dean was positive it would be spectacular. The vest and tie were a matching shade of blue, off-set by his white dress shirt, and the color was just perfect to make the depth of his eyes shine. He could even make out the well-defined muscles of Cas’s arms in the cling of the fabric, highlighting just how much the guy spent working out.
It confirmed what Dean had suspected. Those were not scratches from human finger nails. They were both too wide and too deep. Ragged. Those were scratches from claws, not nails.
Dean didn’t respond right away, working the information over. It certainly explained where Castiel was coming from a bit better. But the guilt was still unfair.
As a few fingers pound in and out with a rhythm Cas had yet to give Dean, he hears a zipper being undone. Suddenly Cas is gone. Completely gone, and Dean whimpers hard.
Fortunately, Cas had just spent the past few years working on timing and surviving by the skin of his teeth. He turned the rat into the flame spurt just as it erupted from the ground. The rat unlatched then and fled in erratic movements, screeching loudly as it burned. Castiel spun away from the fire.
Five minutes later, security was in the room, taking statements, or whatever passed for that with cruise ship security, and looking for any evidence or clues. They didn't find any of the normal kind, and Dean hadn't found any of the abnormal kind. They chalked it up to some people coming back from the pool, drunk, and taking advantage of a door that hadn’t clicked shut properly to look for some riches.
After a long silence, Dean sighed and handed the sketchbook back to Sam to put away. “Let’s go,” Dean said.
John grunted and took his hand after a beat. He looked Castiel up and down but made no comment on whatever he saw or judged. “Dinner is mac and burgers. I’ll holler when it’s ready. Don’t destroy anything doing… whatever you’re doing.”
“Rock into me,” Castiel repeated. Dean gently moved his hips, pulling back just enough to create a little friction, and pushing back in just as carefully.
Dean glanced at the mark and shrugged. He started shoveling again as he answered, “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.”
Any doubt about who he was vanished when Dean’s eyes saw the big furry thing wrapped around his waist.
“So who is Mark?” Cas asked, crossing his arms and leaning against the opposite counter. Dean nearly spilled his just-opened beer on his shirt. Cas chuckled. “Sorry, I’m just curious. We’ve been here five minutes and he’s been brought up twice.”
Dean watched Castiel storm out the door and, the second his friend (ex-friend?) was gone, all strength left his body and he fell to the floor.
It was Castiel who finally suggested they retrieve the moonshine from the car, and Dean readily agreed. He didn’t smoke, but a shot sounded like the perfect chaser to what they just experienced.
Sure, being hooked up didn't often come with such enthusiasm. But Charlie had set him up with a friend of hers, and since she was one of approximately (exactly) three people that knew Dean was bisexual, she'd gone out of her way to make it a guy friend.
It was a silly game, something that everyone seemed to be doing on Facebook during the quarantine. The games kept cropping up and, bored, they’d both been participating in most of them. Dean had been trying to think of ten items for his unpopular opinion list for a day or two. Sure, he had plenty of things to bitch about, but not many he was willing to air publicly and risk looking like an insensitive ass.
Cas flung the door to their hallway open with a bang, closed the twenty feet to their apartment, pulled Dean inside, and slammed their door shut. Dean didn’t let him move another inch, however, blocking him into the door, hands pressed on both sides of his head.
It’s brutal and harsh and pounding so straight and directly into his prostate that Dean actually screams.
“Don’t fucking care,” Dean growls, forcing himself down on to Castiel’s cock hard. Cas lets out a yelp and throws his head backwards. He wasn’t expecting
Dean wiggled his eyebrows at Castiel, provoking a snort of laughter. “I know you were checking out those panties. Want to get a closer look?”
His hands wouldn’t keep still. While Castiel moved to torture his other nipple, and then lower still, Dean’s fingers wound through his hair, down his biceps, across his back, anywhere that he could physically reach to let his fingers learn Castiel’s skin.
Dorothy was a witch who lived in a small hut with her wife Charlie. They'd been around for a loooong time, but the rumor was that long before Dorothy worked for Crowley, she had traveled a lot and picked up some rather unusual skills and abilities. She'd served as Crowley's miracle worker before he fired her.
The entire group had started laughing about the time Sam had said ‘Rocky Horror,’ while Castiel and Dean both blushed.
“Cas,” Dean acknowledged, taking his hand. Dean had never thought of a hand as beautiful before, but it seemed everything about Castiel -Cas- was.
“I can handle it,” Dean replied with a wink. His view of Castiel was upside down, making it look like the man towered over him. “Hey um, Cas, you’re going to have to take your clothes off at some point.”
He didn’t look scared though. He looked like he’d seen a ghost. Well the way most people looked when they saw a ghost. Haunted. Breath held tight, Cas stared at the mark like it meant something to him.
There were three girls, and Cas recognized Charlie from auditions. A petite blonde girl Cas was pretty sure went by Jo was sitting with her, and the third girl, with curly brown hair and a stern heart shaped face that scared the shit out of him, was sitting to the side. He had no idea what her name was and suspected she had transferred to the school recently.
The guy chuckled as he flexed his fist, feeling out any damage done. Apparently satisfied it was still functional, he took Dean’s offered handshake. “Castiel,” he said. “And you’re welcome.” He squinted his eyes as he looked at Dean. “Though, I do think in all fairness, this means you owe me a beer.”
“Hopefully you won't have to,” Castiel replied from Kevin's back. “To the left, the Chapel should be that way.”
Pieces began to fall into place. Like why Castiel had locked himself away. He had said he’d failed his king. He didn’t say how it had happened. Dean was beginning to regret prying, but. Well, he needed to know.
Through the spots, he could make out Castiel, stunned and awed, flexing his fist as if he’d never felt it before. His grace was fully restored, his status as an angel once again solidified.
Charlie’s mouth was hanging open. In fact, so was Kevin’s, and even Sam had turned around and was now giving him a thoughtful, pitying look.
Okay, so maybe he was curious what would happen if they were pressed against each other again, hands clasped, dancing.
. It was filled with action, adventure, tragedy, humor, and above all else, friendship, family, and love.
He crossed the space to Cas in a few strides and plucked the glass from his hand. He set it down—hopefully on the sideboard, he wasn’t sure.
Mr. Peters nodded, commented on how wonderfully Castiel had captured the fall period of the mountains, and handed over two hundred.
Sam huffed in annoyance. “This isn’t that bad, Dean.” In defiance, Dean crossed his arms, so Sam added, “We'll barely be in here anyway.”
“I lasted long because of the first orgasm, but I will come soon. And if you haven’t come by then, then you won’t come.”
He realized perfectly well that bath water was clear, but it was less weird if he was in the water right? Groups of men go down to the creek all the time to bathe, why should this be any weirder?
“And what do you think is really going on here?” Dean asked. “Despite this revelation, my point stands. There is at least one other selkie on this ship, but they aren’t looking for you. What are they doing?”
There was much grumbling and grunting and squabbling around Kevin, which he resoundingly ignored. The bar was mostly empty by the time a Brute wrapped a hand around his arm and tried to force him out.
“Uh huh, what kind? You have to be more specific, you can’t just say, ‘stuff,’” Jo said, saving Dean the trouble. She leaned forward to hear his answer.
“I know,” Castiel murmured. He didn’t speed up though, and it seemed to be forever until he bottomed out.
And so Dean gave him more. He rocked harder and faster, dragging his cock back and forth inside Castiel. His own cock was leaking pre-come now, and the movements were getting easier, letting him rub over Castiel's prostate, making his lover moan and squeeze Dean's shoulders so tight, he was going to leave marks.
Dean hooked his foot around Cas’s ankle and with a tug—and a touch of athletics and grace—he flipped them. He bent down and sucked a nipple into his mouth, delighting in the gasp it earned him.
“Patience, my pet,” Crowley responded. Dean bristled before he stormed off. Crowley knew he didn't like the pet names, but he insisted on using them anyway. Not only for appearance's sake, but partly because Dean was cute when he was riled up.
Prince Crowley hated his mother. His mother, The Queen, was only good for one thing—dying. As soon as she kicked it, he would become King. The ruler of all the little, pathetic people that made up his land. And with her out of the way, he could finally wage war against the people of Guilder.
“So we’ll meet him outside Ice Leaf,” Castiel said. “Just like old times. How much time do we have?”
Well, he tried to light one. Only in the movies do they ever light right when you need them to. He kept pulling the match across the side of the box and only barely felt the sudden chill behind him.
It was fast and rough and messy, but it was satisfying and completing and beautiful and Dean felt nothing but wonderful things as he arched under Cas and came, his orgasm punched out of him as violently as the sex had been.
Castiel spun around. It looked like their friendship was over anyway, no point in hiding any longer.
Dean tossed his pillow after him, Castiel chuckling as he dodged it. Dean laid back and smirked to himself, waiting for Castiel to start the water. Speaking of-
But Crowley didn't have a soul. And so he rejoiced greatly in the horrendous sounds, smiling as the life was sucked from Castiel's body.
His rash thought was cut off as a young woman burst through the door, screaming, “Demons! Demons outside!”
Cas decided Sam was the safest person to pick next, and Sam chose truth this time. He admitted to a crush on Mrs. Keller, the math teacher, and then picked Jo. Jo’s dare was disgusting and revealed a new side of Sam’s evil ingeniousness, but she managed to eat the chocolate dipped broccoli with glee. Then her eyes were on Dean and Cas felt his own fingers curl reflexively into Dean’s side.
“Oh my god!” Dean said breathlessly. His fingers found themselves in Castiel's hair without him giving them conscious approval to do so, but Castiel didn't complain, so he didn't move them.
For the first time since Sam had yelped, Dean looked at Castiel closely. Castiel met his gaze and tried to convey a hundred things in the look. His eyes were pleading.
“I haven't decided yet,” Dean confessed. “You may have to feed me another bite with those fancy sticks of yours.”
“No,” Crowley said with a shake of his head. “They'll make it out. That man was too skilled, and Dean is too stubborn. Luckily, I know where they'll come out. Gather the troops, we're going around.”
“Gay, yes,” Castiel said. He took Jo’s undrunk punch from her hand and downed it. “It’s just a costume.”
“Let me,” Castiel said in his deep, gravely voice, pressing his lips to the soft skin just above the line of Dean’s jeans, “take care of you.”
Castiel jerked in surprise. “I’m not sure I can,” he said, getting off his stool anyway and nearly falling over, just to prove his point.
Cas is standing in the doorway to his room, an entirely too smug look on his face. Dean feels like a deer caught in deep blue headlights. How did he get the door open without Dean hearing anyway?
“You won't,” Castiel argued. “I've been practicing, nothing but spit to ease the way. Being relaxed is more important, and Dean, I'm definitely relaxed.” His dick gave an interested little jerk, but Dean's miraculously still functioning upper brain was not convinced yet. “Trust me. I can handle it. I want it. Dean, I want you
“Hey,” Dean said, sitting up. He placed a hand on Castiel’s thigh to stop him from leaving. He didn’t want this to end badly. He didn’t want it to end at all. “I uh, I don’t mean to sound like a total chick here, but it’s not that I’m not interested. I’ve just. I’ve never… I’m barely out of the bisexual closet here.”
“No!” Dean squawked. He cleared his throat and spoke at a more normal volume. “That’s not it. My family knows, okay? Hell, Sammy walked in on me gagging on my boyfriend’s dick in
Nodding, Castiel finally looked away from the mark and resumed tending to Dean’s wounds. They were mostly scratches from the demon beasts, and Dean thought he was being a little overly cautious and more than gratuitous in the way he rubbed salve into the marks, treating each one like a personal offense, but Dean wasn’t about to complain. Like anyone else was ever going to show him this much attention and care.
“Well crap,” Dean said, stretching his arms above his head and cracking his neck. “We should probably get going then.”
Castiel let Dean’s pelvis back down to the bed gently, but didn’t move any further for a long moment, panting into Dean’s knee. Finally, he gave it a kiss. Then he pressed his lips to Dean’s thigh, and then higher, as he worked his way up Dean’s body until he reached Dean’s hip bones, where he licked with long stripes.
Castiel frowned. The lead. To a newbie at the drama department? He wasn’t even in choir. Not that such a thing was impossible, but it was very, very unlikely. He would have had to blow the directors out of their freaking chairs. He only wanted a minor role, anyway, and he probably wouldn’t get that much. Maybe when he didn’t make the casting cut, he could still sign up for crew and work with Dean.
He crashed into Castiel, pressing their lips together and holding him close. Dean loved Castiel, and Castiel loved him. It was almost too good to be true.
Nonetheless, Dean had a mission. He fiddled his button and fly right open, dropped his pants and mooned everyone in the room with his pink panty clad bottom. The shrieks delighted him, and he was able to take his seat in front of Cas with a trace of dignity restored.
Castiel looked him up and down in a way that was entirely too unsettling. “As a matter of fact, you look exactly like a guy that secretly enjoys many things you outwardly consider too feminine.” He had taken several steps towards the main area before he added, “I wouldn’t mind seeing you in panties one day.”
Sure enough, Kevin was frowning. “Dean, I was having a good night. This hardly sounds like our kind of case.”
Raising his hands in defeat, Dean resigned himself to sharing his past, something he typically preferred to keep private. But they were right, and they would find out soon enough anyway. It had only been a matter of time before he’d have had to share the story, and he might as well do it before they get to Cas, and things go tits up.
“Fine,” he huffed. “There’s an axe murderer on the loose and you’re spending the night with a stranger.”
“Or a dominant bottom.” His finger roamed further, trailing across Castiel's navel. “A submissive bottom.” He slid his hand sideways, dying to run his finger tips over the curve of Castiel's hip bones, before following the line they cut down past the waist band of his underwear. Dean took Castiel's solid length tightly in hand, squeezing just on this side of rough, eliciting a gasp from Cas. “Or a dominant top.”
They debated about staying a night in town, but Dean didn’t want to risk missing Azazel, so they went back to the spot of the road that Dean and Cas had originally faced Azazel on and then moved perpendicularly from the road to the tree line. Camp was established just inside the woods, so that they could have a guard watching the road, and the rest would be just out of sight.
Castiel didn’t respond right away. He broke from his guard position by the wall to come sit on the bed beside Dean.
He was hoping maybe Cas hadn’t felt the same way about the silence, that it had only been uncomfortable for Dean, but that hope was dashed after he parked the car.
A customer knocked at the door. Unfortunately for Sam, as was the case with most of the complex, the wall was mostly windows and they could see everyone inside. Castiel quickly unlocked the door and let the older gentleman in.
“Well I put in some calls to my contacts and a hot zoologist from Cincinnati informed me that the hair is from a seal. Apparently it’s pretty obvious. Your marine biologist booty call should have recognized it.”
Dean stood up, his back popping as he stretched. “That’s a shame. Nudity improves everything.” He grabbed his jacket off the back of the chair.
That, finally, got Cas to look up and meet his eye. There was surprise in his eye that got some gears turning rather uncomfortably in Dean’s head, pieces falling into place.
Dean made sure the hallway was still clear and called Charlie. He explained things quickly, sending her the picture of the hair after they hung up.
“I did something incredibly stupid today.” He liked getting straight to the point. Anna quirked an eyebrow. “I signed up to try out for the musical.”
Dean tripped right over a huge root. He heard his knee pop and felt a jolt in his leg. Dean knew instantly that he was done for. Leaves and moss broke his fall, but it was of small comfort. God he hoped Sammy would be okay without him, could handle Dad on his own, find his own food–
Cas reached out and, without remorse, dug his fingertips into the socked soles of Dean’s feet. The sound of laughter mixed with yelps filled the air as Dean squirmed to get away.
“Jesus,” Dean whispered. He pressed the tip of his finger to the rim and watched in amazement as it slid inside easily. He pumped his finger a few times, Castiel sighing contentedly and relaxing even further. One finger became two, two became three, and soon Castiel was moaning into his arms, thrusting back into Dean.
She opened her mouth to reply, but the sound of the front door opening made her pause. The family room had gone silent again.
Dean gritted his teeth and stormed back outside where he paced for quite a while before he’d cooled down and finally thought things through. Castiel owed him an explanation. He’d get it at dinner. And to do that, he’d need a suit.
Castiel sat up, looking down at where his hand entered Dean’s body, raking his eyes over Dean’s softening (but not for lack of excitement) cock and his heaving chest before landing on his eyes, and staring into them as if they were actually the best part.
But his body was just a perk. Dean’s laugh, so full and carefree, had much more to do with it. His eyes, so beautiful in color and filled with life, might have played a part, too. And his freckles.
Castiel chuckled weakly. “I just… I thought maybe I’d pushed you too far at the end there. I hadn’t intended that bit. But you were so responsive, I thought maybe…”
Dean grunted, his pelvis hitting Castiel's, unsurprised to find some excitement already blooming on both sides.
Once the room was calm enough for Sam to speak, he naturally couldn’t pass on a chance to torment his older brother and called on Dean.
“Again, thank you,” the man said, collapsing onto a rock. As if the entire situation weren't odd enough, Kevin made it weirder by handing him a flask of water. The man raised his eyes in surprise, taking the flask slowly. “I suppose if you were going to poison me, you would have just dropped me off the ledge.”
No, Dean had no idea who his dulcet toned neighbor was, all he knew was that sometimes, if they ended up showering at the same time, his neighbor would pick up his tune and sing a duet. Sometimes, his neighbor started it. He was more prone to picking modern stuff, Dean classic rock, but they had the same song list, for the most part.
And more than once, when the comedy was in a slow spot, Dean was positive he could feel Castiel’s eyes on his profile. But he was too scared to turn and confirm it.
Dean spent most of his free time with the horses now. They didn't ask questions, didn't care about how much he ate, or if he was out socializing with new people. His parents worried. Horses did not. Out in the fields, he had found a modicum of peace.
Crowley pick up the thread. “And then my tongue, yaddee yadda. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I won't repeat tonight.” He stepped forward and halted again when Castiel continued.
Dean could tell that as they explained it all, Sam was thinking that this was not exactly their kind of thing. But he seemed willing to help and was ready to come with them to talk to the man Castiel had seen this morning. Dean mouthed him a thank you as they followed Castiel out of the dining hall.
“Why didn’t Catherine Ogle tell us this last night when she told us about Gatlin?” Dean further probed.
They almost missed the ding and stumbled their way out of the metal box and into the hallway. Castiel had to remove himself from Dean long enough to unlock the door to his apartment and they tumbled inside.
Blessedly, Dean stopped raging on about his girl crushes after that, which improved Castiel’s mood significantly.
It was the kind of love that didn't happen every day. It was true love that Dean held in his arms, and he knew it down to his bones.
He pulled back enough to get both hands between them and pulled Castiel’s boxers down, tucking them beneath his balls. Castiel took a shuddering breath while Dean stared down at him.
“I’m a mess, Cas,” Dean finally said after hours of not sleeping. He could just make out Castiel tilting his head in the dark, the only sign that Castiel had heard him. “My brother is going to hate me. I’m going to miss his birthday, all because I wanted to get him a pastry.”
“God you are so screwed up,” Sam said, standing up. He walked to the door and paused. He waited so long to speak that Dean tensed with the tension. Finally, he said, “You’ve let your fear of Dad’s and other’s opinions control you for long enough, don’t you think? Figure yourself out.”
“That’s ridiculous, it’s freezing. We can share,” Dean said. Castiel hesitated before nodding his agreement and sliding in beside Dean. He was stiff, and they were close, but not touching. “Sleep well, Cas.”
Dean put the hammer away and turned around to see that Castiel had shrunken into himself defensively, looking to the side instead of meeting Dean’s eye. He’d hurt his feelings. He wasn’t sure how, but he had.
They were kissing and clothing was going everywhere. Two jackets straight to the ground, a tie fell over a chair, shoes were chucked, thumping against whatever furniture they happened to hit. Dean had Castiel down to pants only in no time flat.
“I’m glad I don’t have to hide around you, Dean,” Castiel said with sincerity as the laughter died down. He had to wipe a tear away from his eye, he’d been laughing so hard.
“Shit!” Dean cried. He tried to stand but his knee painfully reminded him why that was a bad idea and he fell to the ground with a cry. He scrambled across the campsite, half pulling, half using his good leg for movement, to make his way to the weapon. He heard a few more arrows fly before he reached the knife, sitting on a makeshift work table next to the tent. He grabbed it and turned back towards the action, but with his busted knee, it was more of a defense weapon than something he could help with.
Castiel tried very, very hard not to overthink the fact that there was a ghost-audience sitting out there. A very, very large ghost-audience, cause this place was old, and there was no telling how many people once filled those seats.
“He would, apparently,” Dean explained with a shrug. “But he wouldn’t elaborate further. Believe me, I asked, but he just mumbled something about nutrition and suspected medicinal properties and bad consequences, and left it at that.”
“Oh, he was very much alive the last I saw him,” Metatron assured him. Dean believed him, but somehow, it wasn't terribly comforting.
They broke the surface with mutual gasps and sputtering breaths. They collapsed and rolled on solid ground, sputtering up sand and detritus.
Dean began with the buttons on Castiel's black tunic, popping them open one by one and kissing each newly exposed patch of skin. He worked a slow trail down Castiel's chest, Castiel's breaths coming in deep and hard, his hands opening and closing, clenching at his sides.
“That should never have happened to you,” he said. “Were I not about to be killed, I would help you find this man.”
“Nonsense!” Dean exclaimed. He placed a hand on Castiel waist, to the other in his own, and sashayed Castiel around the room like a pair of drunken baboons.
She gave a tug to Dean's new leash and began yanking him down the terrain. He went reluctantly enough, but as he didn't have much choice, he shuffled along where the woman led.
As the nausea rolled again in his tummy, Castiel thought that breaking a leg might be desirable. Then he’d get out of having to actually go on stage in front a room full of actually, breathing, living people. There was no ghost-audience tonight.
“It’ll burn out. The trees are far enough away to be safe,” Sam said. “Yeah it’s great to cover our tracks, but-“
Crowley really, really hated being a step behind. And here he was, exactly one step behind Dean. Metaphorically. Can't even enjoy the view. “Of course,” he agreed.
Dean agreed, so he tried to settle himself on the horse and resign himself to traveling like that for the rest of the day. Dean even admitted after a while that the horse wasn’t so awful, and having Castiel pressed into him made it all actually kind of nice.
Flapping his arms at his side, Castiel sighed. “I’ll hold you,” he said. That was certainly one way to sway Dean’s opinion. “This will get us to that murdering bastard a lot quicker. We may even be able to meet up with him in the next town.”
“Sorry sweetheart,” Benny drawled, “That’s not what you said.” He cuddled the dog into his lap. “Besides, I ain’t much for interspecies relationships. Moose and dog? Ain’t right.”
Dean took the shovel and made for the area closest to the tombstone, while Sam started a few feet down.
Dean stared at Cas for a long moment, gears turning, the picture starting to take form. When he’d been pulled out of hell, it was like he had a 10,000 piece puzzle and he didn’t even know what the picture was supposed to be. Uriel had put 3 corner pieces in place, and now, it was like the pieces were moving to the right areas of the board. Not quite a picture, not quite put together, but like it might be getting there.
Still, Dean was tired, hot, and hungry, so he decided the fire had gone long enough and turned to start filling the pit back in. That’s when it happened.
Terror fled quickly when Castiel swirled his tongue across the head of Dean’s dick as he hollowed his cheeks and sucked deeply. Dean was hard within seconds, deep throated in the next, and coming within minutes.
Dean nodded his understanding. That wasn’t the part he was concerned with, as he was getting used to the fact that Castiel knew things and no one knew how or why. There were more pressing questions.
“Level with me, Cas,” Dean said, his voice more steely than he’d ever wanted to use with his new lover. “You knew what this hair was, and you know what is going on. That’s why you’ve been acting so spooked. You’re not a coward, you wouldn’t care about losing a few possessions.”
“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” Dean mumbled, sitting up and reaching for his ankle. The tree was still on top of it.
He awoke again in darkness, and it didn't take very long to discover he had a blindfold over his eyes and rope binding his wrists and feet. The itchy, rough material was unmistakable, though he was usually using it for farming tasks, not being bound with it. He’d had plans that might have gone that way, had the love of his life not been a dumbass who got himself killed.
There was a shuffle from next to Dean before Castiel stood. “We should sleep,” he stated. “And tomorrow I will take you back to town.”
Finally, after what seemed like an eternity but was probably two seconds, Dean collapsed on the couch.
He was having a good time and hated knowing that something would spoil it sooner or later. Castiel was telling jokes about goats that no one got, but everyone in the bar was laughing at anyway, and Dean was telling stories about his brother and the strange things they had seen in different towns. The lady next to him refused to believe that they had really seen a goat with two heads, and honestly, some part of Dean’s brain didn’t believe it either.
Tilting Castiel’s head with his other hand, Dean leaned in and pressed their lips together gently. Castiel melted easily into the kiss. They made out softly and tenderly until Sam interrupted them with a quiet cough and an apologetic smile. Trying to sneak in some more time together, they retired back to their tent for a little longer.
Dean took the third watch. He always did. Charlie was good at staying up late, Kevin was most alert with a few hours of sleep first, then liked crashing for the rest of the night, and Sam was absolutely incapable of being up before he’d gotten nearly a full night’s sleep. So Dean took the shift no one wanted, the one that meant the most interrupted sleep.
Dean frowned and ignored the comment. It was something they’d discussed many times, but even with the discovery of the bunker and a semi-permanent home, their life didn’t suit dog ownership. Even if Dean had liked dogs, or pets of any kind.
The blob of a group slowly moved into a circle shape and everyone was crossing their arms, right over left, and taking the hands of the person next to them. Castiel found himself holding Kevin’s on his right, and Jo on the left. Dean was directly across and met his eyes.
Dean swallowed one more time before saying, “If it’ll help, sure. But that’s the only reason, you know this isn’t my thing.”
Dean thought Sam had drifted off when he spoke again. “You like him a lot,” Sam observed. Dean didn’t disagree. “Whatever happens, whatever we find out, I hope it works out this time. Anyone that can make you talk the way you were today, he’s worth keeping.”
Eventually he added a third finger, unhurriedly thrusting into Dean, not rushing, but not without passion. Castiel’s own chest was heaving now and his face was flushed. Dean could feel Castiel’s cock on his thigh, leaking pre-come.
At any other time, Dean probably would have found the offer of wearing Castiel’s suit sexy. Maybe. Whatever, the point was that with the information and resulting questions currently sitting on his brain, the gesture came across as presumptive, insulting, and manipulative.
Then he'd told Kevin the most important bit. One of the men who had come out and examined where Abaddon had been killed, one of Crowley's advisers, was a six fingered man. Even from his hiding spot, Sam could make it out.
Dean reached across the gap between them and put his hand over Castiel’s, resting gently on the arm of his chair. But instead of saying something reassuring and sweet, he said, “Totally.”
Which was troubling, so there was the third reaction. Because if Cas had figured it out, how many other people knew? Or would know soon? God he was so stupid to think that he could do theatre under the guise of being forced to because of Sam. Of course people were going to see through that. Considering Sam still didn’t even have to be at practice or construction yet, it was a pretty flimsy excuse.
Castiel nodded. “Of course everyone’s tastes are different, but I never understood anyone that would come to a place as beautiful as this and want to spend all of their time inside.”
“Smiths, right. And they are craftsmen too, or…?” Dean asked, leaving the question hanging. Sam moved to the next display case.
“The concept of the suction cup has been around for ages. This is quite the same, only instead of sucking water, I'm sucking life. You just lost one year of your life.” Metatron explained. “So again, this is for posterity. Be honest, how did The Machine make you feel?”
So it was a great relief when his mom pressed a hand into his shoulder and whispered, “The night’s winding down. Why don’t you and Cas head out?”
is that it’s, well, a tango. It’s filled with energy and chemistry and it just freaking sizzles. It’s impossible to not get into the number. At least, that was always true for Castiel, but Dean seemed incredibly reluctant to start.
“Cas,” Dean said softly. “This is nothing when I should be dead. I would be dead, if it wasn’t for you.”
They were all family now. Dean and Cas were married, Sam was making up for lost time with his family whenever and however he could, and though Kevin hesitated at first, Mary Winchester took him under her wing and declared him her own.
Castiel didn’t seem to have any of the same clothing inspired hang ups. His hands had moved from Dean’s neck to grasping at his ass.
The voice was deep, and not overly full of hurt or fear, just surprise. And Dean was about ninety percent confident it had come from Sam. He’d certainly heard that shout often enough.
But he saw Castiel’s point, so he pocketed the money, and they headed out for Nebula, whom they had left at the local inn’s stables shortly after arriving in Sleet Root. Dean grabbed a few days’ worth of trail rations, two bedrolls, and then they struck out for the forest, and the quickest path to Ice Leaf. Castiel assured him that’s all they would need.
Castiel cursed in a language Dean didn’t know before finally sitting up and rubbing his oil slicked hand on his own cock, and pressing the head gently into Dean’s well prepared body.
The plan had been to have a few drinks and then ask about “their friend.” And Dean somewhat succeeded in that plan, dropping a question or two about a friend traveling through, one dressed all in black, but he didn’t really get anywhere. Everyone was too drunk or entertained to be bothered. At some point he’d just said ‘fuck it’ and decided to join the fun. After the last 24 hours, he figured karma owed it to him.
Dean had never understood how people were able to get up at the ass crack of dawn, rising with the sun. But Castiel was clearly one of those people and it was time to head back to town.
Castiel whimpered in his sleep, wrapped a hand around Dean’s wrist, and forcefully pulled him back into a snuggling position. Dean tried to withdraw, sensing that the awkward would set in any second now, but Castiel refused to let go. He was an insistent snuggler.
“This is the Pit of Despair,” the man said with a shockingly rough and rattling voice, one straight out of a comedy act. He cleared his throat and said in a more normal tone that only further confused Castiel, “Don't even think about escaping. Those chains are thick and secure. And rescue would be impossible, as only I and Count Metatron know about this place.”
Two filled glasses of wine were soon sat upon the makeshift table, and the Man in Black took them both and turned his back to Abaddon. When he turned back around, he sat one glass in front of his foe and one in front of himself. Abaddon raised an eyebrow.
When he spoke, his voice came out as sex-fucked sounding as Castiel’s own. “What makes you think I’m a bottom?”
Castiel writhed beneath him, coming part way off the bed, biting his lip so hard Dean was sure it would bleed. His hands found Dean’s hips and gripped tight.
Dean blushed. That wasn’t something that happened often. “You’ve got a bit of a dirty talk kink, don’t you?”
“Hmm,” Castiel hummed thoughtfully. “Well then, why don’t I try something and you stop me if you’re uncomfortable? We’ll go back to what you’re okay with.”
“Dean,” Castiel said roughly, apparently in agreement. He sat up and removed his tunic, and Dean shivered at the thought of his bare chest pressed to Dean’s, but he had other ideas too. Dean reached for Castiel’s britches, undoing the ties and sliding the cloth down Castiel’s toned thighs.
There’s a playful smack to his ass. “Much better. Look at you. So beautiful. Your hole just cries for a cock in it, doesn’t it? Do you want me Dean? Do want me to pound you hard, make you scream?” Cas says, dragging the tip of his dick over Dean’s puckered flesh. “Unload into you till you’re pulsing with my come? I’ll fuck you by hand afterwards, let you come screaming on my slim, long fingers.”
Kevin struggled to keep up and it was no surprise when the Man in Black finally disarmed him and recovered the flung sword with ease.
“I am not!” she cried, offended. “You defeated Sam, so you're very strong and may rely on that to save you, but you also defeated Kevin, so you must have studied, and will understand mortality and therefore put the iocane in front of me.”
Castiel was thrusting up into him, hips twisting, his cock rubbing on Dean's belly. He was not complacent to just receive, at least not any longer, taking some control of the situation and chasing his orgasm just as much as Dean was.
“We are so going to be some huge thing's dinner,” Dean mumbled. Castiel had stopped, so Dean paused behind him, pressing a hand to the small of his back.
Castiel hobbled on his thrift store five inch heels across the family room. The heels were a challenge, but the uncomfortable bit was the fishnets. He’d had no idea they would be so scratchy. Or that corsets made you feel like you couldn’t breathe, or that mascara was a bitch to apply.
Dean groaned. “Last thing I want to do right now,” he confessed. “But if we got started now we could get the thing unearthed and burned before sun up. Can you find the plot on your fancy phone, geek boy?”
“Seriously?” Dean asks, a grin breaking out. “Wait,” he stops, his brain picking up the thread. “Hester is in charge of sales.”
Dean pulled the blade out, preparing to make another attack when one more arrow flew by Dean’s ear and imbedded itself in Azazel’s eye. Dean turned from the blood splatter, cringing at the horror, so he nearly missed it as Azazel let out a final cry before his entire being simply went poof out of existence. A disturbingly familiar display.
“Dean,” Sam interjected, taking him by the elbow and pulling him roughly two steps back. “He’s got a point. He saved our asses last night.”
Dean turned back to Gabriel. “Are you sure she needs rescuing? Maybe she can do it herself. Or maybe she left intentionally like Cas did.”
Still, Sam wasn't out yet. He thrust himself backwards and crushed the man into the rock behind them. The man let out all of the air in his lungs, but nonetheless held on tight. Again, a different rock. He tried to reach back, but it was an awkward angle and he couldn't make it work. He tried gripping the man's arms to pull them off, but nothing was succeeding. The world was growing dim along the edges, color fading, vision decreasing to a tunnel in front of him.
“I will,” Castiel assured him. “But as I need less than you, I will keep watch for most of the night.” He looked to Dean, his blue eyes dancing in the moonlight. “Get some rest, Dean.”
“I’ll have you know I waited almost 24 hours to bang the hottest marine biologist north of the equator,” Dean replied. “It was torture.”
Sure, there were bumps, and there was a patch of time Dean never, ever wanted to think about again. But all in all, it was a pretty sweet life, with a pretty incredible man.
Most of the time, he does a pretty good job of forgetting hell. The memories he has, of being sliced and diced and burned to all eternity, should have traumatized him. But he’s had years of practice shoving the memories down, pretending hell had never happened. And it works pretty well, until something triggers it, and he’s back in the pit, terrified, frozen, panicking and unable to move or breathe. A weight was crushing his chest, he was going to die. No, he was already dead, this was worse. He was going to burn, be carved, tortured-
Castiel smiled faintly. “She kept that with her at all times, and had already discussed passing it and the knowledge of her bloodline to her children. I imagine your mother would have done the same for you, but she passed away before either of you were old enough.” Castiel nodded at the sword. “Besides, there is one way to find out if I’m right.”
“Does he like you back?” Kevin asked. Castiel turned and looked at him. Kevin shrugged. “Everyone thinks he does, it’s pretty obvious.”
He didn’t regret that he and Cas had not gone further the night before, not much anyway, but it had left him feeling a little on edge. The man was hot and despite the issues of today, Dean was still insanely attracted to him, and they’d made out off and on all night without actually getting off. It was… well, kind of stupidly sweet actually, and he spent all day feeling like a 15 year old with a crush. To like a person so deeply but not sleep with them right away, it was a new experience. One Dean thought he might be enjoying.
Dean froze. There it was, he was going to fuck this all up anyway. He was ready for kissing. Was he ready for
Castiel panted above him, taking a moment before pulling out. He removed the condom, tossed it towards the bathroom, and collapsed next to Dean. Dean fell straight down, his crotch landing in a mess of his own making. For a moment, he didn’t even care.
Castiel glanced down at his cock, over at Dean’s still full and unsatisfied one, and said, “I don’t think you’ll have to wait long.” His grin turned feral, sending a shiver down Dean’s spine. “Besides, I know how we can pass the time.”
“Yes she is. She’ll train you as a salesman, not that you’ll need much help. And you’ll be paid significantly better,” Castiel says with a knowing look. “Is that a problem?”
His hands freed from their grip, he brought one up and plunged his fingers into Castiel’s hair, holding his head close as Castiel began placing gently kisses on his neck and chest, moving his finger slowly in and out.
“Wrong!” Castiel shouted. “Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why. So that every shriek of every child at seeing your hideousness will be yours to cherish. Every babe that weeps at your approach, every woman who cries out 'Dear God, what is that thing?' will echo in your perfect ears. That is what 'to the pain' means. It means I leave you in anguish, wallowing in freakish misery forever.”
“So you’ll be able to make the Halloween party, right?” Kevin asked. “Next Saturday? Ash invited the whole cast. Costume is mandatory.”
Dean stumbled on his way to the door. Cas couldn’t see his face. Oh, how he wished he could see Dean’s face. Dean wore every emotion, every thought, in the lines of his eyes and tilt of his lips.
Moonlight cascaded over Dean’s cheekbones and kissed his eyelashes as he blinked. “You can’t be serious.”
When the movie ended, Dean was still laughing. He had to wipe tears away from his eyes before he could speak.
Dean swallowed, and Sam watched as the action dug the blade in enough to bring beads of blood to the surface. The prince did not struggle further.
Dean’s mouth moved like a fish’s, trying and failing to find an answer before he grumpily turned back to his laptop. “Just finish your damn cereal.”
Dean shrugged and took a huge gulp of his beer. It was very good, a light body without being a light beer, and the cool liquid was exactly what he needed. They sat in companionable silence, Sam playing with his phone while Cas continued to people watch, until dinner arrived.
“Hmm,” Dean replied, understanding. “Well, we’ll salt and burn this mother and your town can go back to snot nosed brats running down the streets.”
“Well you were going to be waiting for awhile.” Sam handed him the cup of water. “I have news for you that you might want to be sober for. Drink up.”
Walking into the warm interior of The Singing Stag was like walking into a cozy little heaven. The place was lit with candles and the large fireplace on the side wall, bathing the wooden beams and rugged floor in a warm orange glow. A hand crafted rug set off an area near the fireplace of couches and plush chairs, while the other side of the tavern featured worn wooden tables and, Dean was pleased to note, a large bar with a larger selection, which he headed straight for.
The other man shook his head, as if shaking off the daze, and stepped forward. “I apologize,” he said, his voice just as low as before.
Shoving his libido to the side, he took off after Castiel, following him into the ship and down a hallway, where the source of the scream was easy to locate.
Only one demon thing got through Castiel’s skilled defenses. It went straight for Dean, and he raised the knife with determination and sliced it open without hesitation the second it was within range. It didn’t bleed, it simply screamed and fell to the ground at Dean’s feet. Up close, it was even more hideous and Dean shivered again.
“I know of a brewery you might be interested in,” Castiel said when the chuckles died. “We just passed it, but you can park at this church on the side street here and we’ll walk.”
The girl giggled as Castiel twirled her around, laughing. Sam shot him a glance from the other side of the room, raising his beer in a salute to another job well done. Kevin nodded at him from his usual place behind the mandolin. Something about sword fighting had translated to instrument play quite naturally for him.
“There’s only two paths to take up ahead,” Castiel explained. “One eventually tapers off to nothing, and the other heads to the capitol. I think we can cut him off, strike through the forest and stop him outside of Ice Leaf, the town just before the capitol.”
Dean looked up, surprised, but Cas as simply holding his phone in his other hand, now scrolling what looked to be Twitter, while he absently stroked through Dean’s strands.
Sam stepped forward. “I was taken away from my family when I was really young, but Castiel swears we're family,” Sam explained. “We can talk later, but for now, this should do.” He pulled his collar to the side, revealing the exact same sunburst shaped birthmark that graced Dean's right pectoral.
Castiel nodded. “Agreed,” he said. “And Dean,” he said, leaning closer, “I hate to say this, but that also means we have no idea if there are beasts nearby or not. But I swear,” Castiel added, bringing his hand up and cupping Dean’s cheek. “I will continue to protect you.”
Well yes, he is. And if this were any different situation, if the guy weren’t drugged out of his mind, Dean might play back. But the guy is drugged, and they met for like 30 seconds before this, so he should be stopping him and walking away.  But he doesn’t.
“Yo, Sammy!” Dean hollered. “I can’t see your bitchface if you won’t look at me!” Sam turned around sharply at that, face in full bitch mode. “What’s your problem?”
Dean expected him to stay there for a while, just warming his cock on Dean’s ass, but he paused only for a second before pulling out and driving back in. Dean smacked his palm against the wall to brace himself. As Castiel worked quickly into a forceful pace, he really hoped the other side was a storage room or something equally unoccupied. Otherwise they were getting an earful.
“That one.” Dean pointed a finger at the screen. It was a selfie they’d taken together at the seafood festival.
Life would progress in this ordinary way with Dean deeply in denial about his feelings for the stable boy until the day the Duke of Floren and his handsome wife visited their farm. They'd heard tales about the Winchester family and how their steeds were unparalleled and wanted to see it for themselves.
“Everyone saw that coming,” Kevin agreed. “No offense, Dean,” he said, shooting Dean an apologetic look. “But this is storytelling 101. And you clearly have a bigger history with this Castiel than just spending one night in his cabin.”
“Fine,” Castiel bit out. “I like you, Dean. A lot. But this isn’t about me. This is about you figuring out who you are before the real Dean is so far buried in Tim Curry’s fishnets, so carefully tucked away in your closet, no one can find you again.”
He watched Castiel take several deep breaths before saying, “I don’t know about that,” softly. He stood suddenly. “I think that Pepsi went right through me. Pick another movie while I go to the bathroom?” Castiel shuffled out the door.
Castiel’s head whipped up. He knew that voice. He may have made a few soliloquies to that voice in his time. Why was Dean Winchester in the audience for this?
When William Goldman was young, he fell ill and, while there was little else the boy could do, his father read him a story. That story was S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure, otherwise known as,
“That’s the second time you’ve said that to me tonight. How often have you known me to not be serious?”
He turned around to tell Sammy he could head back to the room whenever, but the kid was already gone. Sometimes, Dean could admit he had an awesome brother.
Except they hadn't stolen anything. When Dean tried to question that, he was reminded that he was no longer needed and should move along.
Gabriel glared daggers at Sam, who glared daggers back. Only Sam’s daggers were also confused daggers.
While Castiel efficiently prepared the kill, a small raccoon, the party dismounted and gathered around the warmth of the fire. They left the horses to roam, being well trained and unlikely to wander off.
An hour later, Dean strode into the casino wearing what Sam had called, “business casual.” The button down was nothing special, but the black slacks were sharp, and Dean knew his ass looked damn fine in them.
He turned the corner and his breath caught in his throat. The sky was awash in color, purple and blues and oranges and reds, and all the hues that normally soaked through the sky when the sun exploded at the horizon, plus some colors Dean had never seen before.
“You are one lucky little bastard,” Sam said, trying not to sound as awed and impressed as he felt. Kevin shrugged and ducked to begin making his way down the stairs. “I'll get the albino,” Sam called after him. “He could be useful.”
When Dean got back to his room, there was a suit laid out on his bed. He pulled at the collar and, sure enough, it was monogrammed with CJM. Castiel J-something Milton. He had no idea how Cas had gotten it in his room, but he’d guess that he’d tipped room service well.
The asshole didn’t even answer. He shook his head a few times before he pushed himself off of the other man’s support and stumbled his way out the door without turning around once.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel says, whipping a tear away. “It’s just. I don’t think this is what my dad had in mind when he told me not to sleep with the secretary.” Dean smirks. Yeah okay, he’s not exactly your typical sexy tall blonde with a perky rack, a low neckline, and a pair of heels.
He stepped out of the stables looking a mess. His hair was tousled and knotted with bits of hay, his hands were dirty, his clothes covered in stains from working with animals on a constant basis. The young man on the verge of adulthood looked how he always looked, but as the Duchess's eye combed over his frame, a funny feeling settled in Dean's stomach.
But he meant what he said, even if it was hard to wrap his mind around. Castiel was the same guy, angel grace or not. And he knew that their case was done and it was time to move on, and he desperately did not want to leave Castiel behind. Especially when he looked like a puppy lost in the woods. A scary, powerful puppy, but a puppy nonetheless.
A black kid with a strict manner about him smacked her upside the head. “Be nice,” he said after she yelped and rubbed her head. She looked for Mrs. Moseley, but she was consulting a notebook and hadn’t seen anything. She was smirking though.
He spotted Jo in the kitchen dressed up in army camouflage and went to grab a drink and hang out with his new friends.
“It happens,” Castiel said. “There are likely a few demons on Earth right now.” He turned to Kevin. “Friend of Dean, what is your name?”
Castiel shook his head. “It’s not that,” he said. “I put my hand on your shoulder and the flames caught my eye and it was like…” he trailed off, looking into the canopy. “Sense memory. I could feel fire, feel it burning parts of me that don’t exist. But the memory was muffled, not quite a memory.” He shook his head. “I’m sure it was nothing.”
“Castiel,” Castiel answered. “and we are here to put an end to your murderous ways. May I have a name to put on the obituary announcements?”
Fortunately, the topic of his crush on Dean did not come back up for the rest of practice. It did, however, come up again after practice.
The wheels crunched gravel as Dean pulled out of his parking spot on the street. He knocked a thumb on the steering wheel a few times before answering. “Same as before. No memory of how he knew that spell or incantation or-“
“Yeah, I can eat that one,” Dean admitted. “But maybe you should feed me one more, only, you know, in the traditional way.”
“I wonder if Charlie is free.” She was as gay as the day was long, but she was also the most loyal friend he could ever hope for. She would save him if he asked. He picked up his phone and began twirling it between his fingers.
Slowly, teasingly, he rubbed his cock against Dean, using his grip to guide it, smearing it through puddles of Dean’s come. Dean could barely breathe with how intensely erotic it was. Who would have guessed he had a thing for come play?
Dean could feel Castiel’s cock pulsing with release, just as much as he could feel his skin beneath Castiel’s grip pulsing with it.
It took a few tries to arrange everyone correctly, Dean tossed over a shoulder, the woman and Asian each clinging to a side, but somehow they managed to get everyone on the tall man's person. And then to Dean's complete astonishment, he began to climb.
“I’ve got the rest,” Sam said by Kevin. “I can make it look like they killed each other, just get back to a healer and I’ll see you back at the tavern.”
A quick try of the knob revealed it was locked, so Dean kicked the door in, sending wood splinters flying. Daniel Ogle bolted upright from his sleep. He took one look at the ghost coming towards him with an axe and screamed.
“Oh, I am very aware.” Castiel’s thumb glanced over Dean’s cheekbones in a way that was both commanding and gentle. Dean shuddered. “If you’d rather fuck me, I can be amenable to that. As long as one of us is pounding into the other, I’ll be happy.”
He was dreaming of Dean, of course. Of their time together in the swamp, and then of their childhood together. How Dean could be so stubborn, and yet so full of heart. He thought of Dean's brilliant mind, his deep green eyes and adorable bow legs. He could think about Dean until there was no room left in his mind for anything else.
Dean rubbed his thumb gently on the back of Castiel’s hand. “How could any decision be bad that brought you to me.”
“You know how I love watching you work,” Crowley crooned. “But I've got my wedding to arrange, my husband to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped!”
“Maybe he’ll let me know who he is,” Castiel said, cringing at himself. He sounded ridiculous. Anna’s look told him he was right.
The man smirked. “Well said.” He gestured again with his hand and Castiel's eyes fixated on the movement. While it was possible he was wrong, somehow he knew he was not. “What?” the man asked, shifting awkwardly under the stare.
“Very nice,” Jo said when he approached. She reached down and snapped a garter strap. “Where did this get-up come from?”
more times before rehearsal was over. Not only did he have to explain what he was looking for, but she wouldn’t help him until he explained why. Which led to more questions and exclamations until Cas finally bribed her into being silent and helpful by promising that on Sunday morning he’d make her pancakes and tell her everything.
Castiel stopped to rub his nose across Dean's cheek. “I would very much like to lay down with you now.”
He was ready. The panic was passing. They could at least fool around. But Castiel was shaking his head no.
Damn it, had he said that? He wasn’t exactly in the closet, but it was clear Dean didn’t know that about him, and what if… What if he had an issue with this? What if he was homophobic? What if being alone in Castiel’s bedroom was suddenly uncomfortable and disturbing? Oh god.
Sam coughed into his hand and they broke apart. “Just try to remember that there are other people here.” Sam leant forward. “We don’t need a repeat of the night Mark—”
“Yeah, should be fun,” Jo said, brushing off her hands on her jeans and standing up. “Are you though? Ready?”
One minute they were standing peacefully, the next they were dashing at a mad sprint out of the tavern. The barkeep grabbed a broom and attempted to trip them with the handle, but Dean jumped over it awkwardly while Castiel leapt like a graceful gazelle. Two guardsman were just outside the door, shocked when Dean and Castiel came barreling into them. Rather than push through the guards, Dean and Castiel turned and ran up the street. They were halfway through town by the time the guards yelled, “Stop, thieves!”
Once he was secure, mumbling about wasted silk, Castiel collapsed to the bed. “Thank god,” Castiel mumbled.
“I believe in choice and doing the right thing whenever you can,” Dean said, taking Castiel’s hand in his own and squeezing it. “And choosing free will was the right thing. You can’t blame yourself for every possible ripple that may or may not have to do with that decision.”
With that incredibly awkward goodbye, Dean turned and headed towards the cafeteria, his ears so crimson that Castiel suspected they would be hot to the touch.
It was as perfect a night as one could ever hope to have, the most perfect blending of heart and spirit and body, the perfect love for two parts of one soul finally becoming whole.
They kissed until Benny loudly called out, “Alright alright, I ain’t ready to film a porno down here.”
“I’m pretty excited about it though,” he said, risking a glance at Cas. Two brilliant blue eyes twinkled at him as Cas’s lips twitched up into a smile. They were so close they could kiss.
Anna fish lipped for something to say. Castiel got the distinct impression she still didn’t fully approve of Dean, but even Castiel could hear how dopey he sounded. She didn’t want to hurt him by being unnecessarily negative.
“Dean,” Castiel said, hand raising to brush his cheek. He kissed him deeply one more time. “I promise.”
,” he ordered, voice loud and fake sounding once more. “You've captured the prince and confused him. Surrender. Now.”
That was going to be hard to do at school, especially if Castiel was there. Hearing him sing made him feel like he was in the presence of divinity. His heart felt light, his insides warm. He’d only vaguely known who Castiel was before, from sharing classes and such, but after his audition, Dean wondered how he ever could have missed him.
“I mean,” Castiel clarified, nipping at his ear, “what do you want? Not, do you want to top or bottom.”
“I don’t know,” Dean admitted. He was worried about that. Castiel wasn’t exactly flaming, but he wasn’t Dad’s ideal image of masculine either. But so what? Cas was great and Dad could go to hell if he didn’t like him. “I don’t really care.”
Castiel was like that. Most of the time he seemed perfectly normal, a fully functioning human being. Then all of a sudden, he’d be eating wood.
Castiel’s hand slid slowly off Dean’s back as he straightened, leaving a trail of heat on Dean’s skin.
Sam’s face sobered so fast, it must have hurt. “I forbid you to ever tell me those stories,” Sam said.
There were three main threats of the fire swamps. Fire spurts, lightning sand, and ROUSs—rodents of unusual size. They'd only encountered the fire spurts thus far, and they would be easy to avoid, with the pop pop sound that preceded it. The lightning sand should be easy to spot and that left the ROUSs, which, quite frankly, neither of them were worried about. For one, they'd grown up on a farm and a few rodents were the last thing that would intimidate either of them. For another, Dean and Cas seemed to agree that they probably weren't real.
It was becoming something sexual for Dean, the competition and the physical exertion and watching Castiel move. When Castiel had declared enough practice for the day, Dean dropped his sword, pushed Castiel to the ground, freed him from his britches and there, spread out in the grass and less than 10 yards from the road, swallowed his cock.
He was tempted to touch himself. He was so aroused that he couldn’t think straight and all it would take was a few pumps and he’d be gone. But he also knew that if we waited, if he came from nothing but Cas pounding into him, it would be so incredible that nothing else would ever compare. And luckily, some part of his brain still knew that and kept his hand glued to Cas’s wrist. Barely.
It was far more than he expected, but this was his fourth night away from home, and given everything they’d been through, he wanted to splurge a little. So he paid for the bath and she promised someone would bring up the tub soon.
“I’ll start the good luck squeeze,” Victor said when the cheering had died down. “Don’t miss your turn. We’re not starting late again because someone zoned out.” He shot a look to Garth and he blushed.
“Come on,” Castiel said, retrieving his arrows. “We should clean those wounds, then we can start our journey back south.”
Castiel turned slowly, momentarily stunned as his eyes settled on Dean’s perfectly, beautiful green ones, not three feet from his own.
“Look,” the man responded, his voice deep and rough. “I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks, so I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.”
Castiel rumbled in his ear, pulled back, and suddenly Dean needed two hands to keep from going through the wall. Two hands wrapped around his hips and forced Dean back into Castiel’s thrusts. He was going to have bruises there later and his head was dizzy with it.
That, there, was the reason Sam was awesome. He loved Dean, but more importantly, he trusted him. He still looked as thoroughly unconvinced as everyone else, but they’d learned over the years that when Dean was onto something, it was best to go with it.
“Nothing!” Dean squeaked. Cas watched as he physically straightened himself and tried to get a literal grip. “She did nothing.”
His voice was even deeper than normal, gravelly with lust and need. It went straight to Dean's head.
"You really are a kinky little whore," Castiel says fondly. When he resumes thrusting, he bends Dean until he’s fucking straight down, trying to drill Dean into the mattress. Dean’s cursing on each brutal thrust down, rubbing him both right and wrong, riding the edge of painful and pleasurable. There will be hand shaped bruises on his hips tomorrow.
“We found them unattended in the stables,” Sam offered up. “Figured we could use them to get the hell out of here.”
For a brief, very wonderful moment, he thought it had worked. No splash sounded behind him and he quickly began swimming away from the boat in frantic, long reaches of his arms and kicks of his feet.
Castiel kept him up on his sword work, training him every day, but it did normally end in other, more pleasurable physical activity. Which they also got up to every night, after they’d had a filling, good meal, and after which they’d pass out and sleep heavily, wrapped up tight in each other.
