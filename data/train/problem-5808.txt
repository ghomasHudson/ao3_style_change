Tony quirks a grim smile at him, clapping him on the shoulder as a ruse to lean in and whisper a file number in his ear, a.k.a. the project folder for Tony’s magical defence research. He flicks his eyes over to Loki and Thor, arguing in hushed tones and a language Tony absolutely does not know, before briefly touching his temple to Bruce’s.
“What’re we going to the Bronx for?” Steve says, voice a little rough with his accent. It always comes out when he thinks about the old days, and he ducks his head to avoid Tony’s grin.
Thor throws up a hand and turns back to his food, brows perhaps permanently fused together given how hard he’s frowning. Tony makes a note to give him a wide berth.
“She reminded me of Peggy,” Steve says quietly, and all of them freeze and look at him. He looks at Natasha, face still flushed pink. “And also…my mother? And Bucky’s ma, and Clara the showgirl, and…you. It…” He shakes his head again, visibly rattled, and Natasha places a hand on his shoulder. She looks thoughtful.
“She’s okay,” Taesha manages, and Tony smiles. He laughs a little, relieved and giddy with it. “Just a radial fracture, if you can believe it. So I just wanted to say thank you, for saving her. For saving us all. A little privacy is truly the least I could do.”
“Because I’ve found a pretty foolproof de-escalation technique, and right now there’s an obstacle between us preventing me from enacting it.”
By Strange’s expression, this is not the desired result. Tony can tell, and any levity that had creeped into his face immediately falters, then disappears entirely as the smoke fills the whole of the room.
“Come on,” Tony says, shifting in Steve’s hands, and Steve laughs. It’s just a small one, a low chuckle, but it’s enough to send a slow roll of pleasure up Tony’s spine. “Steve, baby, you’ve got me right here-
“Steve, Loki knows exactly what our relationship is, trust me. I should talk to him, but he definitely knows the gist of it.” He takes a breath, drawing back slow enough that Steve could stop him if he wanted. Steve lets him go, watching him stopper the decanter and place it back where it belongs. He watches Tony take another sip of his drink. “You could.”
He was kidding, and both of them knew it. By morning the snow would be too high for Tony to even cross the street to the forge.
This is a different man than he’s tasted. This Tony is delightful and impish in turns. He laughs. He gives himself up to pleasure as easy as breathing, as though this is precisely what he was built for. He is shameless. He takes and takes and takes everything Steve wants to give him, opens himself up like the lushest fruit under Steve’s hands and mouth, ripe for the feasting. It’s heady, this power, Tony Stark naked and gasping and so incredibly beautiful under his hands. It makes him greedy. It makes him ravenous. It makes him ache for a body that can lift Tony up and press him into the wall, manhandle him, leave bruises imprinted into his flawless olive skin.
Loki tilts his head to the side, expression one of earnest confusion. He’s easier, so close to sleep, more open. “This surprises you.”
Pepper slides in and fixes him with a look as he crosses around the front of the convertible. "You picked me up from the airport, personally."
There’s no electric dissipation to herald his disappearance this time, no flash of golden light. Tony wonders how much of what he’s tracked so far can be attributed to what Loki wished for him to see, the way Natasha sometimes makes noise in the dark to let Tony know she’s approaching. He stares for a moment longer before looking out the windows, remembering the shatter of glass and the inspissating air roaring around him as he fell.
“You don’t know anything about the real Buck,” the voice spits, accented and sharp and all too close against his ear.
“You took a shower and you still smell like bonded sex pheromones,” Bruce deadpanned, and Steve flushed.
and it breaks something open in his chest, so deep inside of him he isn’t sure he’ll ever heal back the same way again.
“It’s best described as duck stew, Captain. The team left you a container of rice as well.” There’s a pause, and Steve rolls his eyes, knowing what’s coming. “Sir said that it was what he expected would best agree with your ‘bland American palate’.”
“Sure,” Steve said, shaking his head. He let Thor help him up, waited awkwardly while he put on some pants, socks, a heavy cable-knit sweater. They both put on their coats, and Thor grabbed a bottle of white wine and two glasses on the way out.
Steve was patient. He could wait. When he brought it up again, Tony had decried the dangers of their profession. They risked their lives every time they went on a mission. How could Steve expect them to be bonded? It would put the whole team at risk. Steve countered with criticisms of the popular studies on broken bond trauma, with the near irrefutable evidence that a stable bonded pair leading a pack strengthened a pack as a whole, that strong pack ties were linked to efficacy in battle. Steve had felt like he won that one, but Tony was a sore loser and it had only made addressing the issue more difficult the second time. Then, Tony had said he didn’t want to be bound by his biology, and Steve had countered that this was a choice that they could make, not an obligation, and Steve was choosing Tony. Tony hadn’t had anything good to say to that, self-deprecating as always, and so the last fight had ended with a bout of emotional sex that had left them both too raw to look each other in the eyes the following morning. Steve would have called that a tie, but honestly he felt like it was more accurate to say they’d both lost. Neither he nor Tony were very good with emotional vulnerability. He was trying, though. He felt like he was doing marginally better than Tony on that front.
He thinks about who he might have talked to about this when he was younger. Not his mother, certainly. But maybe…
“That’s true,” Steve allows. He tries to think of how to explain this situation. “Can I come sit with you?”
“I want to come with you,” Steve said, already knowing that speaking the words was the equivalent of loosing her chains. The smile that Natasha offered him was bloodcurdlingly cold.
“Have I overstepped?” Loki asks, and Tony is learning to read wariness as the fear of rejection now. He’s learning how to read Loki’s masks of protection for what they are.
“We can sleep on the way,” Tony says stubbornly, pulling out of Loki’s grasp, but stops short when a fleck of gold appears before him, expanding outwards until it shows an aerial view of São Paulo, of all things.
“I don’t want to make you uncomfortable in your own- Uh. Your own home,” Steve says. He’s stubborn as ever. Tony thinks that perhaps he ought to find it charming, but mostly it seems to get on his last nerve.
“You should take the job with SHIELD,” Tony tells him. He means it, too. “It’ll be good for you to have direction. All these months, and I finally figured you out. You get so restless when you’re bored. You need routine. You’re like a human golden retriever. You’re running out of things to fix in the city, and so you’ve become desperate to fix us. But I can’t…" Tony's voice breaks. He's not proud of it. He pushes on, because he has to. He has to get this out. "I can’t be your North Star, Steve. I can’t be your life raft when I’m drowning. Routine is my anathema. I’m a fucking mess. And I need to stay here and get my company and my life back on track.”
“You wanted to eat me out,” Tony says, and Steve swallows, colouring a little. Tony doesn’t understand how the man can be so damn brazen and still blush when Tony phrases things a certain way, but it’s one of the things he loves about him. “But I was really enjoying the idea of you holding me down while I was squirming, of you licking into me until I’m begging for you to fuck me. So maybe I’ll wait on that.”
Yes, that is Miss Ursula Bliss, for anyone who caught that. She's so annoying and yet so lovable. Some dialogue is obviously taken from Ultron, and that last bit is a riff off of
“Thanks for the save,” he murmurs, and Bruce sighs, body slumping towards him. He’s hot, skin fevered, fatigued. Tony tightens his fingers in Bruce’s blanket.
"Sure," Tony says, smiling a little. "But how do you feel about moving downstairs a floor? I'm setting up suites for all the Avengers. When the renovations are done you'll have your own floor, and so will Bruce."
A shorter chapter, mostly because I am a college student and classes are starting soon. My updates may, admittedly, become less prolific until December. I apologise in advance.
“I’ve eaten two whole meals today, scouts honour,” Tony says, one hand over his heart, the other raised to God. The smile Steve offers him is weak, but it’s there: soft and a little pained.
He knows it isn’t normal for people to clap after eulogies, but the deafening silence that accompanies Tony’s exit from the stage feels deeply wrong. More people are supposed to speak, and Steve might have liked to hear them, but instead he’s tugged along as Tony keeps walking: around the back of the stage, and down, into the thicket of graves and further, not even really looking where he’s going.
“Can we get a photo?” one of them asks, and Tony exchanges a glance with Rhodey, whose eyes are big and pleading. Tony rolls his eyes and waves a hand at him. He steps into the suit, and sighs with relief when the familiar metal closes around his body.
"Just a peck on the cheek, in the suit. I felt it. I flirt, it's nothing, I didn't think-" He exhales, pushing away from the worktop and spinning towards the back wall. He pushes off the stool and wipes his hands on a rag. "When he appeared here, I didn't know what to think. When I asked him why me, he said not to ask stupid questions. So I told him he'd have to convince Clint, not me."
“This is a plot, right?” he asks, and Steve’s brow furrows. “To kill me. Because, that’s definitely what’s gonna happen, if we’re doing this regularly. Death by baffling, incredible orgasms. I can actually feel the lost braincells- ouch!”
Steve shrugs. "I guess. You remember Howard, though that seems a mixed bag.” Tony snorts, and Steve flashes him a wry smile—just the barest quirk of his lip, more exhale than anything. “I barely knew my da. Even when he was alive he was barely ever around. All my memories of him are kinda blurry. Faded." He smiles bitterly. "Like an old photograph. Fitting huh?"
The sentence, in Tony’s voice, rises to the forefront of his mind like a body rising from the river. He doesn’t know where it came from. All he feels is Tony’s grief, total and all-encompassing, wiping over his mind. For a moment, they are one being, head held in their shared hands, alone, mired in grief.
Sight Bonds are rare, and hold a kind of mythical place in the gestalt. Even diehard anti-dynamic activists soften a little at the idea: someone who is perfect for you, in every single way, down to the unique cocktail of hormones in your blood. The only record of a Sight Bond going sour is the romance between Cleopatra and Marc Antony, and whether or not they were ‘soulmates’ is highly contested. No one knows if that was a fabrication to justify their political manoeuvrings or if it was real. Now, of course, there are blood tests, which is how Tony knows that the nascent bond that pulls at his chest and tells him to find Steve and cuddle up next to him and complete the bond isn’t just in his head. Bruce had confirmed it. To Steve, because of the serum’s inclination to accelerate any and all biological processes, it’s like they’re already bonded. Tony hadn’t even needed to bite him to stake his claim. To Steve, he and Tony are already tied together. All he’s waiting for is for Tony to give in.
. “If this were any other day I’d lock us up in the penthouse and cancel all my meetings for a week.” Steve lets out a small growl, just loud enough to send a skittering shiver down Tony’s spine. “But I can’t. I have this float, and I won’t really have time, and I want to take you out properly-”
“Don’t,” Tony snaps. He shoves at Steve’s chest, eyes welling with tears. “Why is this happening to me? Please stop. Stop.” Steve grabs his wrists, tries to still his thrashing. He tucks Tony into his chest. He speaks it against the skin of his neck.
“So you don’t have to worry about exposing Tony to the team,” she added, and that. That hadn’t been what he was doing.
“No, I think that was surprisingly apt of you, actually, considering your own lack of emotional acuity.” Tony blinks at that, spinning around again. Natasha’s smile is wry, pointed, and Tony smiles back, hesitant. The smile drops off her face, and Tony tenses again; he can almost hear it shatter as it hits the ground.
“Do you know how many we’ve killed?” he retorts, putting his hand on the palm scanner. “If death is how you measure heroism, then heroes we are not.”
“Turn it off,” he mutters, walking into his closet. It’s been a long week, and he’s suddenly exhausted. “Thank fucking god it’s Friday.”
There was really no other way to say it. They’d meant to quietly infiltrate the compound, but the alarm had been tripped. Both Widow and Hawkeye swore up and down it wasn’t them, which could only mean that something was happening inside. Steve, struck by an all-encompassing bolt of fear, gave up all pretence of stealth and went full-Terminator as Tony liked to call it, cutting through the swathes of Hydra soldiers with brutal efficiency. Hawkeye had clearly taken up a vantage point in the catwalks above the main ring of the silo, because all around him arrows rained down upon their enemies. The report of a gun and the flash of its firing was the only hint he got of the Widow’s location, moving in perfect accordance with her codename as she slipped and swung through bars and grates and wrapped her limbs around unsuspecting soldiers. Death was a dance to The Black Widow, a serene song of grace and inevitability, and Steve loved to watch her work.
Tony tips his head up, blinking to find Steve gripping the railing from the outside, feet caught through the rungs. The straps of his coveralls frame his broad shoulders almost like suspenders, and underneath is a faded collared shirt that might very well be Steve’s, damn his sweet old boy sensibilities. The cuffs are rolled up to his elbows, revealing the corded muscle of his forearms. That impossible blond hair’s managed to catch the morning light just so, glancing off enough under his pageboy to make a bit of a halo, and he’s so beautiful Tony could cry just looking at him. He offers Tony a cheeky grin.
Steve closed his eyes, resting his face in his hand. His palm covered his eyes to block out the light. Everything was just so much, and he was so tired, all the time. Everything had become a chore: waking, eating, sleeping without Tony in their bed. The scent of him was both torture and balm, necessary and abhorrent. Everything made Steve want to scream.
If someone cared enough to ask Steve if he thought the future would be this different, he might laugh and never stop. Because it wasn’t the cars, or the airplanes, or even Tony’s mind-shattering science that was unbelievable. It was the fact that every social interaction before he went into the ice had been clear-cut, because dynamics said more than simple, clumsy human words ever could. It had been how he led the Howling Commandos—a strong streak of empathy, enough to be able to read someone’s scent and know exactly what they needed to be effective in the field. Bucky’s acidic beta stress scent said he wasn’t sleeping well, and so Steve knew that he needed someone to sit by the fire and razz him until his cheeks ached because that was the only way to stave off the nightmares. The sweet and sour scent of Jim’s wavering fury/fear usually meant that there had been more bad news from back home about the internment camps. Steve had known that meant Jim could probably use a quiet walk around the base, with the reassurance that his captain wouldn’t let him be sent packing and locked up on a bullshit dishonourable discharge. He’d known all of his men, down to the barest fluctuation of their base scents. It was an easy intimacy as old as humanity: to know your pack, and care for them, as was the alpha’s eternal honour.
Then Tony blinks, mechanically, exactly once. It’s an expression Steve remembers from when Tony had Extremis: a visual marker of Tony’s brain saying
The elevator is approaching the penthouse now, and Tony lets out a breath, swiping a hand over his face. He’s not sure what’s waiting for him, but he can’t imagine it’s anything good. He and Steve had been in such a good place this morning.
“If you’re there, Steve, you’ve been very naughty,” Tony says, and Steve’s head snaps up to look at him. Tony, true to Steve’s predictions, is entirely naked as he roots around in his drawer for a pair of briefs. “Haunting me, huh? Why not go bug Stephen? He’s the ghost guy.”
“What do you take me for,” Natasha says, scowling in mock offence. He can barely see her face in the soft light through the windows, but he knows her enough by now. Tony grins at her and takes a tiny sip. “You’re compromised.”
Steve’s pulse falters in his throat. A quiet ringing sounds in his ears. “What?” he asks, faintly. His voice is a rasping whisper in the quiet.
He waits until the workshop door slides shut behind him to swear, softly. Then he takes off towards the kitchen.
Tony wakes to the smell of coffee, his mouth cotton dry and tasting like smoke. He’s greasy, singlet so stained with various oils and solvents that the fabric is dry and scratchy on his skin. He doesn’t move for a while, just breathing and listening to the sound of the coffee machine. When he hears a familiar clink and the sound of someone pouring, he scrubs the sand out of his eyes and stares up at the ceiling. A mug appears in his line of sight.
“Steve,” Tony says, reaching out a hand. Steve lets him brush his knuckles over one high, sharp cheekbone. He’s got stubble, something Tony’s almost never seen on his clean-cut Americana face. He can count the times he’s caught Steve with facial hair on his fingers, and Tony swallows at the thought of that stubble brushing against other places. The inside of his thighs, chiefly.
Natasha rests a hand on the nape of his neck. "Come on," she says, and takes him out of the room. Tony notices Clint doesn't protest half as much as he thought he would. There's no hardness to him, none of the quiet anger that filled the first year after New York.
Steve leans in to kiss him, and for a long few minutes they just stay like that, Steve kissing him and Tony letting himself be kissed, reaching back to tangle his fingers in Steve’s long, thick hair. He’s let it grow out so much, mostly keeping it back with product, but Tony kind of likes the way his bangs hang down when he leans in to kiss him in the mornings or after a shower. Right now, his hair hangs free, and Tony cards his fingers through it and rocks his hips back a little, slow and easy.
him. Not really. He can’t stop himself from being around Tony, so he hovers, awkward, around the periphery of any room they’re in together. His hands are always curled into fists. He’s trying so hard, but Tony knows that all he knows how to do is make Steve furious. And there’s nothing he can do about it. This is who he is, regardless of Steve’s old-fashioned ideas of what his mate ought to be. He’s not willing to change, to make himself smaller: more demure, more sweet, more accommodating. He’s stealth, for chrissakes. His dynamic is hidden on his state ID. He’s the epitome of everything Steve hates about the future.
On the screen, Maria folds her arms across her chest. She’s somewhere in the field, because the wall behind her is brick, nothing like the gleaming steel and glass of SHIELD. There’s a small cut below her right eye. She looks tired, but also cautiously optimistic. “Because he stood by you.”
, Steve remembers thinking, his chest tight in a way it hadn’t been since before the serum, asthma sitting harsh and heavy on his chest.
And then he picked Tony up and hoisted him so that his legs curled around Steve’s waist. The expression of delight on Tony’s face was dangerous. Steve would do a lot of things for that face, but for now he leaned in to kiss Tony as sweetly as he knew how.
“Omega,” Tony gasped, and then he was coming, knot swelling large enough that Steve’s lips were forced in a tight seal around his base lest his teeth begin to cut in. “Fuck.
“Steve,” Tony gasps. He’s completely shocked, wide-eyed and panting. Moisture gathers at the corners of his eyes. “Fuck, I’m going crazy. I’m- I’m really, I’m really-”
“Every day, I have strived to become the kind of man that Steve Rogers would be proud to know. I expect for the rest of my life, I’ll have him whispering in my ear. For my sins, I’m sure he’d tell me. I will treat this haunting as a gift, as I expect each and every person who knew him will as well: the gift of Steve Rogers in your life, ever urging you to be a better friend, a better citizen, a better lover, a better parent or student or soldier or athlete. A better person, striving for a better world.
“Not good for my heart rate,” Bruce had agreed. “I’ll take care of Clint’s injuries, and then we’ll make dinner.”
“For what it’s worth, I really am sorry for the whole…fake murder thing.” Tony offers him a sheepish wince. “Look, I think you’re just…immature, comparatively.” Thor raises an eyebrow at him. “I know, I know, you’re two thousand years old or whatever. But, I mean, how old are your parents? It’s not really fair to compare your wisdom or whatever to theirs. And sometimes you’re wise. In ways that surprise me, and…well, I’d say humble me, if I wasn’t me.”
Tony moves towards the doorway, but when Steve moves to the side to let Tony pass he catches the fat bruise behind his ear, dark pink and clearly mouth shaped. Steve’s head spins, and he steps back instinctively. He opens his mouth, then closes it again, but Tony hasn’t noticed. He’s walking to the elevator, still babbling.
“Don’t bring that science is magic malarkey into the Batcave,” Tony says with great affront, clutching at his chest. Thor simply smiles and offers a hand to him.
She bundles him into a helicopter and walks over to chat with the pilot. Steve hesitates for about fifteen seconds before putting his hand on the side of the helicopter. Once again, it goes right through.
“And you’re gonna rectify that, being the good town sheriff and all,” Tony observed sagely. “Can’t have a booze hound ruining this sacred day!”
“You’ll get grease on you,” he warns, perhaps meaning something else entirely, but Natasha only smiles thinly.
“The bodyguard talks,” she observes, the smile slipping off her face, and Tony’s stomach twists. Underneath the mirth she’d been projecting, her eyes are flat. The expression that she offers him is her own: a still pond, with the smallest of ripples passing over it.
according to your own stupid moral code. You’d be happy if he sacrificed his life to save some stranger when in any given day Tony creates things that advance the human race as a whole, improve quality of life, save thousands-”
The absolute farce of the situation does not elude anyone in the room. Even Tony cracks a small smile.
They’d said nasty things in the papers when the couple had first started stepping out in public: about Tony’s alpha-alpha relationship with Pepper being doomed from the start, about how the only reason he was settling down with an omega now was that Steve wasn’t even really an omega. He was tall, and broad-shouldered, Tony’s field commander. What kind of alpha let their omega order them around? To top it off, Steve’d spent years pretending to be an alpha at the behest of the military, a combination of suppressants, synthetic pheromones, and propaganda fuelling the lie until Steve had come out a year after what Tony liked to call his “defrosting.” Omega rights had come a long way, and he wanted to set a good example for all of the omegas that were now allowed to join the military. Omega enlistment rates were low, and the number of drop-outs was higher than other natures, likely because of internal pressure and ostracism. It felt important, but he never wanted to be used as fodder for the papers to try to hurt Tony. That seemed to be half of what they did most weeks, like there wasn’t enough real news to print.
“What do you think I’m here for?” Tony asked. He trudged over to Rogers’ bed, dragging it towards the stove and turning the blankets down. Rogers watched him with dark eyes, fingers packing the med-kit back up slowly, as if to give himself something to do. He was still pale as milk, wan and shaking, and the sight of the strong, strapping sheriff looking so weak made something in Tony’s chest tighten.
Steve doesn’t know how long to wait by his body. Not long, probably. It’s a shorter distance to the Sanctorum from the Triskelion than it is to the tower. Soon his crypt is empty and dark, cold he can’t feel making itself at home in the sterile space. For once he is deeply, furiously glad of it. He needs time: time to breathe, to think, to trace back over the long arc of his and Tony’s friendship and relearn its shape. He needs time to unravel the thread of Tony’s revelations. He needs time to sit down and grieve.
“Natasha thinks it’s nice that we love each other very much,” Steve said, trying to break the tension, and Tony let out a shaky laugh. “We’re just so domestic, and it makes the tower feel homey. Isn’t that sweet?”
“We can’t even manage a whole meal together,” Tony points out, and Steve closes his eyes and sucks in a sharp breath. “Steve…”
“I want this, too,” Tony repeats, fury and fear twisting nastily in his chest as the words are ripped from his throat. “You weren’t wrong.”
When Tony’s been on the phone with Hank McCoy for two and a half hours, Steve thinks he may as well leave. He hasn’t been able to figure out what they’re talking about, really. Mostly they seem to be trying to figure out why the serum isn’t healing him like it should. They’ve gone round in circles about it four times, occasionally conferencing with Hank Pym, or Xavier, or Reed, or, or, or. Steve thinks they’re barking up the wrong tree. Clearly this is magic. So he figures he’ll take a walk down to the Sanctum, and see if Strange can see him or not.
“But what?” Pepper says, folding her arms, but her eyes are bright with mirth. “You cost me twenty bucks.”
Blessed darkness takes over the room, and Tony closes his eyes, breathing in the smell of Steve’s more human musk, sweet sweat and the smell of his shampoo. Under it, the inhuman scent of Loki’s pine-and-winter smell lingers, familiar and strangely dear.
Natasha doesn’t point out that she likes him, too. Tony’s grateful for it, because it would just hurt both of them. Still, after all this time, it’s he and Natasha who always have to make the hard decisions, to move through the moral grey so the rest of the team doesn’t have to.
Tony took one look at the expression on his face and laughed, smug and avaricious. “You are so high right now.”
“I wanted to be able to give that to you, because you’re unbelievably gorgeous, and sweet, and you looked so happy just to have your hands on me. Touching me. Holding me up.” Steve swallows, throat clicking, and Tony presses an open-mouthed kiss to the shell of his ear. “Submission is a gift, and the curse cheapened that gift. But I wanted to submit to you, Steve. I lied to you, to try to protect myself. I love orders in the bedroom, giving or receiving. I love giving myself over to a lover, letting them use me as they desire. I love taking a lover apart in my hands, gifting them pleasure after pleasure until they can’t breathe with wanting-”
“Yeah, yeah, busy business man’s so important,” Clint coos, and Tony winces. He’s pretty sure Clint’s referencing his fight with Steve, which means that likely the whole team has watched the security footage. “Go play with your toys.”
“Yes,” Tony said simply, and Steve lifted him up above his head by the waist and watched him laugh and thought,
“I can,” he says. “Missives to a handful of known Nigerian and Congolese operatives match Agent Romanov’s claims.”
Tony snorted. “You don’t even wear a hat, Sheriff.” He tilted the glass towards Rogers, wincing when the liquid almost slopped out of the glass. “Care to find out?”
Tony doesn’t know what to say to that. This is Bruce in a nutshell, though. Effortlessly brutal and kind, all at once.
“Stark,” Thor says, expression twisted into something ugly Tony’s never seen from him before, but he pauses when the arm Loki has draped over Tony’s shoulder lights up with golden light.
“What did you do?” Rhodey says, walking over to the newly formed crater in the ground. He peers down into it, then turns away. Tony doesn’t bother to look closer.
Steve watches her go with cotton in his mouth, milk soothing the sting of acid and sitting in his stomach like stones. There is a part of him, a surprisingly large and vehement part of him, that wants to tell Pepper to burn the whole thing and walk away. As he’d run out, he’d seen more than just the paintings; a pack of cards that were probably used by the commandos in the trenches, one of the old show costumes, and even what he suspected was his helmet from basic. The artist in him is still in a dead faint at the idea that he now owns not one, but two Warhols in which he is the subject, let alone whatever else is in the room. Some of the pieces had looked like the old propaganda posters he’d done back in art school.
Steve gives him a flat look, and Tony sighs and gets up, walking back towards the work sink and complaining all the while. Steve pulls up a stool catty corner to Tony’s and opens the box of cookies.
Steve stares, breath shallow and silent in his chest as Pepper examines him. He has always been a little bit afraid of smart, beautiful women, and Pepper Potts is no exception.
They circle each other warily. The living room is a wreck. Broken dishware and the shattered remains of a wooden end-table line the floor. The glass top from it is spiderwebbed where the corner hit the slate tile that covers the communal floor, white lines racing up and through the square pane like lightning. Tony watches them, and winces when Clint tries to stand and puts his hand down into a pile of plate shards. He’s stoic as he attempts to lurch to his feet, pieces of glass and china still embedded in his knees.
“Thor thinks you’re lonely,” he says conversationally, “but also that you have some big plot in the works. He didn’t seem too concerned about it, though, so good job on that one.” He pulls a cotton Henley off a hanger with his free hand, the other still tousling his hair with the towel. He also grabs a pair of blue jeans.
“NIA couldn’t hold them,” Rhodey says bluntly, and Tony lets out a soft curse. “Tony, we knew that, come on. This was what was always gonna happen.”
A memory rises, then, like a pale, bloated body floating to the surface of a lake: Clint, letting out a low whistle as they toured the newly-appointed Avengers’ Tower.
Bucky’s laugh is tinny through the little phone speaker. Steve leans closer, not quite close enough to touch Tony. He isn’t sure he wants Tony to know he’s eavesdropping so brazenly. “Oh really? I thought it wasn’t a favour-”
Steve pulls off of his cock with a sound that’s going to haunt Tony until he dies, he swears to God. “If you’re still talking, I’m not as good as I want to be,” he says, voice wrecked, and Tony can’t help but whine a little bit. Steve noses at Tony’s sac, sucking at the soft skin there before he tilts Tony’s hips up a little, dipping back father. “Maybe I should kiss you here.”
“Just an R&D fiasco. Everyone is incompetent, the usual stupidity.” He picks up his gym bag and takes a long drag of water, calls out to the room: “Fight Club is fun and all, but daddy has to get back to work, kiddos! Have fun.”
“Well then,” Steve tells him. He tips Tony’s face up so that their eyes lock. “Feeling’s mutual, hm?” He kisses Tony, chaste and warm. “Just talk to me, okay?”
He doesn’t even finish the sentence. Instead he turns, disappearing back into the tower without a word. Steve watches him go, feeling helpless, but he knows better than anyone that sometimes the best thing to do is to let Tony work off his anger. Tony will disappear into the lab for a bit, and hopefully when he comes out he’ll be in a better state than he was when he went in.
“You want me to torture myself more, you mean. What the hell does it matter? He doesn’t want me. He doesn’t have to tell me why.” Tony squeezes his eyes shut as another wave of pain overtakes him. He grits his teeth through the pain. “He’s not obligated.”
“I’m a filthy social climber,” Steve declared, widening his eyes as big as he could. He looked up at Tony through his lashes. “But I promise I have other, more redeeming qualities.”
Steve can literally feel his heart breaking. His chest is wracked with horrible, aching pain as he searches Tony’s face.
“We had lion dances almost throughout the whole building,” Tony says stubbornly. “Which, hey, I don’t want bad spirits haunting my employees while they’re trying to work. I’m a big fan of multiculturalism. I live with an actual alien from another world.”
“You’re gonna regret that comment when he’s still talking about it in a year,” Rhodey explains, resigned. “I’m regretting it already.”
“I shouldn’t have pushed,” he admits. A small smile steals over his face. “I never learn, with you.”
“Come on, Nat,” Tony tries. “We know you’ve been compromised. We know you kept Barnes off the security cameras in Nigeria. We know you intentionally kept Cap in the dark about him.”
alright. Mostly. He hadn’t been lying about that. He can handle this with poise and grace. He’s Tony Stark, god damnnit. They’re just tentacles.
“A declaration! I’m touched,” Tony crows. He spreads his hands, takes that last step, lets himself fall backwards into the clouds. “Don’t wait up!”
“-of a giant Pacific octopus is a metre long,” Tony finishes, and Steve’s mouth closes with an audible click. “I’m at least twice the size of one right now.”
“Listen to me you mouthy little shit,” Tony said, and Steve let out a surprised bubble of wet laughter at the familiar fond disparagement. “I love you so fucking much, you hear me? I love having you in my life, and I love being bonded to you. Tell me you hear me.”
Steve huffs. “You could say that. It was still seen as kind of…well. Unclean, I guess, might be the nicest way to say it. People’d assume things about you, the kind of person you were, the things you liked.” He shrugs, uncomfortable, and slides down the bed until his shoulders are propped on the pillows, the camera staring up at his face from his chest. “But you know all that from the history books, I’m pretty sure.”
Amora considers this. She looks extremely put out, and Tony expects it has something to do with the fact that she’s decided it will be entirely too much trouble to kill anyone on the roof with her. “I see.”
“Oh fuck,” Tony whispers. He stumbles back, sits down heavily on the edge of his bed. And then he’s sobbing: big, great heaves of it, quiet and desperate. He’s crying like Steve hasn’t seen him since he gave up drinking, like every sob is taking something precious and necessary from him.
Tony clutches his fingers in the fabric of the pillow, taking comfort in it even as his heart races with panic.
Tony leaves Loki to deal with him, turning purposefully towards the elevator and taking off before anyone else can waylay him. He has the suit follow him, and he can hear Rhodey and the War Machine armour heading up the rear, the clank and the reliable military clip. Tony braces himself for the interrogation he knows is coming. Unlike Loki, Rhodey never promised not to use Tony’s aversion to being boxed in against him. Instead, he waits patiently until they’re inside the closed elevator to speak, eyes never leaving the closed doors of the elevator.
“Wow, you’re, like, way less uptight than I thought you’d be,” Riri had trilled at that, clearly delighted. In the back Steve could hear a low crackle, almost enough to be Tony’s warm, rumbling laugh, and the sound of it made his vision blur wildly as his instincts tried to claim him. Immediately, the static cut off. Steve didn’t know if he was disappointed or relieved.
“Last time Amora was in my head for ten seconds, I assaulted you.” Tony opens his mouth, ready to argue, but Steve isn’t having any of it. “I need to make sure-…I need to make sure. So yes. I’ll submit myself for review.”
“Don’t worry your pretty blonde head about it,” Tony says, and Steve can feel the back of his neck heating. He knows Tony says things like that all the time. He doesn’t mean anything by it; you don’t call alphas pretty. But still, even the hint that Tony might find any part of him appealing hits something deep in him. His heart kicks in his chest. “Here, come lift this for me.”
Tears well in Tony’s eyes. His eyes flicker wildly from side to side, searching the room, and so Steve takes his messy hand and puts it on Steve’s face. He sucks Tony’s thumb into his mouth and imagines the taste of him, and it’s enough to make him moan.
“People usually love me in spite of my mouth,” Tony jokes, but Steve isn’t laughing. His eyes are dark and serious as he considers Tony, and Tony closes his eyes as Steve presses another kiss to his brow, firm and unyielding.
Steve doesn’t know what he’s supposed to do in this situation, but he doesn’t think it’s just sit here. He pulls Tony towards him, instead, drawing him in until his shoulders fit comfortably in the curve of Steve’s arm. He coasts a gentle hand over Tony’s spine.
Loki smiles, sharp and delighted. "Oh, he is his father's son, I see." His image shimmers for a moment, and then he bows. "I have been called Silvertongue, and Lie-Smith, and Trick-Skin, and even mistaken for Satan. But I suppose Laufeyson would be most correct, as it seems that would be the most important factor in your considerations, Master Jarvis."
The professor studies him for a moment, a small smile playing around the corners of his mouth. He looks empathetic, but Steve feels a little like he’s being laughed at. “Alright,” he says. “Let’s return to what your friend said. Do you think you can tell me why it bothers you, now?”
“Nope,” Clint says. “Just tired and high. Nat was hungover, which, let me tell you, takes so much more
He cuts himself off as Pepper spins around abruptly in front of the rear doors of the dining hall. Her mouth is pressed into a thin line, and Steve stops short to avoid a collision and stutters to a halt. Her stare could cut glass.
“Tony’s pretty confident of his own intelligence,” Steve counters, laughing a little. “But I guess I see what you mean.” He takes a breath. “You make it sound like we’re really hard on our friends.”
Steve’s jaw works a few times, and for a moment Tony thinks he might decide to be stubborn. Then he sighs, and pushes himself up. He pulls the mail over his head and drops it to the floor with a tinkling clunk, so that he’s standing there in just the bottom of his Cap uniform and a plain white t-shirt. Half-dressed, with his hair sticking up in sweat-damp golden spikes, he looks, unfortunately, edible. Tony’s eyes travel over the slight strip of skin where the shirt has ridden up, licks his lips at the hint of cut muscle he sees there. He imagines a line of perfectly round pink bruises marching over Steve’s skin, and the image makes him shudder from the top of his head all the way to the tips of his tentacles.
“Steve,” Natasha said, and Steve turned back to catch her gaze. She looked dangerous, in the way only she knew how, silent and ready for one of the strings in her web to twang in just the right way, to signal the need for an attack. “Tell me to take the gloves off, and I will.”
“How? Could be a lot of things. Could be a magic user fucking with you. Could be someone who’s got powers like Kitty. Could be-”
“You can follow some threads to the SHIELDRA data dump,” Natasha adds. “Track his missions against mine, and you’ll see a pattern overlap.”
a break,” Tony says. “What about my trauma? Would you want to be bonded to an alpha from 1940 who thinks that Posturing and shouting down a room of mixed dynamics is acceptable? I refuse to live like a meek, witless child in the shadow of my husband. He’s everything I hate about the very existence of dynamics. We haven’t been able to be together for longer than forty seven seconds without it turning into a tasteless knot-measuring contest, and now I’m meant to spend the entire rest of my life with a stupid, hulking brute-”
There’s a slick sound, picking up in pace. Unbidden, images spring to mind. It’s like he never left. The wall is doing nothing to protect Tony’s modesty. Steve has swallowed his tongue. His mouth is dry. He shouldn’t. He shouldn’t stay here. He should go. He should leave, and come back in the morning, and forget this ever-
“I could not begin to predict, Sir,” JARVIS admits, although he has the grace to sound pitying about it. “This situation is somewhat beyond my parameters. You have never had two serious partners concurrently before.”
“You can do a lotta things with nanites, it seems. Although the brains tell me ya shouldn’t be messin’ with ‘em.
“Command?” Tony repeats, and Loki chuckles, the vibrations moving all through Tony’s torso. “I definitely wouldn’t say that.”
“Flirt later,” Widow says via comms, and Tony grins, flipping himself over and flying above the quinjet.
They’ve settled in the main library. Books upon books are crammed into every available space, piled on the floors, on tables. Some of them seem to be breathing, moving of their own accord, but like all strange things around Stephen, he ignores them as best as he’s able. It’s better for their friendship, that way. A cup of tea is clutched in Tony’s hands, even though he can’t stand tea. He spends far too much time with people who enjoy it.
“Tony,” Steve said, helplessly, and Tony pressed his forehead to Steve’s jaw, lined himself up, and pressed inside.
“You’ve been bedding the guy for a month and you haven’t managed to ply him with StarkTech?” Steve deadpans, and Tony can feel embarrassment flood his face with heat. Steve can’t see it, but his expression says he doesn’t have to. “How do you usually get in contact with him?”
Worst of all was the knowledge that there was nothing more appetising to the press than the ability to trash Tony Stark for something. He didn’t want to be weaponised against Tony, used to paint him as a corrupting influence. He didn’t want to be the reason that they trotted out the long line of photos and videos of Tony in varying compromising positions, almost always taken and posted without his consent. Tony shrugged that kind of thing off like water off a duck’s back, but Steve could see the tightness around the corners of his mouth when the paparazzi were waiting outside the tower with some salacious detail to shout about. It got tiring, after a while, even for a pro like Tony, to let them prick their claws in and take whatever they wanted.
Steve isn’t sure if that last one is really for kids, but JARVIS had said it was one of Tony’s favourite films when it came out, so they’d watched it through. It’s pathetic, probably, the two of them sitting in the living room eating Tony’s favourite comfort food and watching one of his favourite films, but Steve doesn’t mind it so much. Tony is his soulmate, and Hulk certainly isn’t going to judge him for sentimentality. He’d cried big fat green tears during
“Go ahead,” Tony says, finally, and that seems to satisfy the spell well enough. The expression that overtakes Steve’s mouth is greedy, more wicked than Tony would have expected from Cap, but he’s absolutely not upset to find out that Steve’s a little more kinky than his sweet, all-American exterior might suggest.
Loki hums thoughtfully in what sounds like agreement. The spluttering choking noise behind him implies Clint hears it, and Tony barely makes it into his quarters before breaking into hysterical laughter. He might also be crying, he isn’t sure.
He thinks of Loki and Thor, circling each other like wary animals. He thinks about spending two thousand years of his life with someone, only to have his heart broken so thoroughly that he would wage a war to spread his misery. He thinks, maybe, how he feels about Tony is strong enough to make him do something reckless and dangerous. He thinks about the rage that overtook him in the elevator, and it makes him hate himself a little.
And then he got to one knee, and the screaming grew so loud that Steve’s ears rang painfully. Pepper’s entire face drained of colour, and she turned around and pulled her phone out, dialling and putting it to her ear. She was likely already on damage control. Hundreds of employees had pulled out their phones, probably livestreaming to the internet, but Steve couldn’t care less about any of that. (Okay, maybe he was a little sorry for Pepper.) He could hear multiple people yelling “is this real?” and “oh my god,” a chorus of joyful incredulity to buoy him.
“A wise idea,” JARVIS agreed, and Steve nodded. “My scanners would suggest that your biometrics have almost returned to their normal levels.”
Still, that doesn’t mean he wants the Hulk to smash Bruce’s lab. Bruce would never really forgive him, for one. And Bruce’s version of payback was always a little too vindictive, a little too cruel to be a simple joke between friends.
“I thought you knew!” Tony snaps, waving a hand to gesture between them, at the clear evidence just presented to him. “How the hell is Barnes not in the surveillance footage?”
“I never thought we’d be back here so soon,” Tony says. Steve sucks in a slow, shaky breath. He glances around for Stephen, but he hasn’t been able to find the sorcerer yet. None of the other magic wielders seem to be able to see him.
“Tony,” Steve said, less shocked than he ought to be after knowing Tony for years. “You can’t go to a meeting smelling like-“
If he wanted to be honest with himself, he’d admit that he’s not actually that surprised. This isn’t half as bad as it could have been. He and Cap have been friends for years now, and they respect each other. Cap rarely gives Tony orders anymore, instead couching his directives as questions. Tony responds better to inquiries than imperatives, and Cap is a lauded tactician. He was being
A deep, searing heat seeps into Steve from where his hand has just touched Stark’s, like molten rock into a pool of water. His sentence turns to a wordless vocalisation, almost a shout, and before he knows what’s happening he and Stark are standing there with their foreheads pressed together, shaking, holding each other up. He can smell the top notes of Stark’s base scent even through the blockers from this close—coconut, copper, something high and sharp like the static in the air before a thunderstorm. It’s rattlingly unusual combination of scents, but Steve can’t help but take in a deep, bracing lungful of it. His hand tightens on Tony’s skin.
,” Steve Rogers says from uncomfortably close to him, and Tony blinks burning eyes open in alarm, rolling away from him instinctively only to end up in blinding pain as he falls to the floor in a heap. For two delirious beats he can’t process anything but agony and glaring white light, but then the lights dim, and he can blink his eyes open to polished black stone shot through with geometric white lines, a low blue glow shimmering from a far wall of painted glass. Bruce is kneeling in front of him, and Tony blinks at him once, twice, before throwing his arms around Bruce’s neck.
“This is a bad idea,” he says, but he can’t quite manage to sound sincere about it. He’s been outvoted, outmanoeuvred, outplayed. Still, he can’t help thinking that
“Agent Romanov is on her way. She says to tell you that she comes bearing a black eye, ‘the good stuff.’”
“Well, it might not be possible, when we first get him back,” Steve replied, voice even as he could make it. “If you care at all about me and Tony and our bond, you’ll do this one thing for us. If I’m right, you’ll understand immediately why when you see him in person for the first time. And if you don’t, then my request is moot.”
Logan moves further into the room and lets the door shut behind him. The soft snick of his claws echoes menacingly in the room, and he spreads his arms wide, wide enough that as he circles Steve’s lifeless body he almost scrapes the wall. “Thought you were smart enough to outwit Iron Man? Fat chance o’ that. How many times’ve you failed now, huh Casper?”
“That might be wise, sir.” Helpfully, JARVIS throws up a list of known magic-wielders on one of the holo-screens, listing Sersi at the top. “You could try someone else?”
“Go for it,” he says, waving a hand, and Minoru nods at him like he’s just given her a serious field order.
“He’s on the West Side Highway, sir. I would estimate he’ll be here in thirty minutes at the most, but I can ask him to hurry.”
“A pretty cage, for each of us,” Natasha says, tossing her hair out of her face. “Perfectly engineered, perfectly customised, waiting for one of us to turn to the dark side.”
“Of course there is,” he says. He takes a breath, reaching up to brush his thumb over Tony’s cheekbone. He comforts himself with the faint flutter of Tony’s eyelashes, the way his breath stutters in his throat.
. He’s picked Tony up, and is placing him in his bed as gently as Tony’s ever been handled in his life. “Tony? What’s wrong, talk to me, is it-”
He closes his eyes and lets the memory of metal under his fingertips, strong and slab-cut like human muscle, linger like chocolate on the tongue. He imagines Tony under his hands in the armour, the plates opening up like a flower. Skin. Warm, olive skin.
“You have already provided me with an invaluable gift, Captain, as you have for the past two years,” JARVIS said. “You do not need to give me anything else.”
“Being friends with Steve meant bearing witness to the kind of small, simple kindnesses that often left me breathless in their sincerity. Steve was-” Tony stumbles, then pushes through it bravely. “-an attentive, careful friend. He always had an encouraging word for someone who looked down. Especially the younger, less experienced members of the Avengers. He always knew when we weren’t taking care of ourselves, and how to help.”
Steve let out a sharp bark of laughter. “Oh my god,” he said. He fisted the fabric in his hands, incredulity still building in him, laughter tumbling out of his mouth like marbles. It felt like he hadn’t laughed in days. “Oh, god. He’s such a maniac.”
“I want you,” Steve says, trying for seductive. His hair is wild from thrashing against the pillows, eyes narrowed in frustration. He looks delicious, and not very submissive at all. Tony laughs at him.
“Hey, no, I just had no idea if Amora would know if I said anything. I figured if I could trust your brother with anything, it was his own life.”
“I have a meeting,” he says, pushing himself to standing, and Beth and Pepper are giggling at each other now, sharing knowing looks. “Goodbye, ladies.”
He leans down to suck a mark in the hollow between Tony’s left ear and the straining tendon beneath it, and Tony goes utterly limp under his mouth.
“No,” Tony mutters. A familiar bright blue dot is hurtling towards him on his HUD map. “Steve’s gonna notice.”
. There will be no petty squabbling of consequence and law when there is nothing but ash, and dust, and blood. More blood than you could ever imagine. More blood than can be borne from the rotting husks of all you have ever held dear, more blood than water is held in the rivers and the lakes of this land, enough to paint the sky red with mourning. When Death is brought to your doorstep––and She will be brought, as She is always brought and carried with Him wherever He does go––Midgard will fall, and Asgard will fall, and all the realms will fall under His hand unless there is a force great enough, united enough, clever enough to stop it. And you cannot be such a force if you are sneering and sniping about petty trifles such as which minder is best suited to manage you like the filth-ridden, squalling babes you truly are. Thus when I ask for something so small as truth and obedience, why then must I lie and trick and seduce for what should be freely given if it is to save your own-” Loki’s breath hitches, the gold flickering out until all that’s left is the green and horror, bright and gasping. His hand tightens painfully on Tony’s jaw. “Your, you-“ He chokes, tries again. “You…golden, beautiful, infuriating, I cannot understand-”
“Where do you need us?” Natasha prompted again, and Steve was so thankful that someone else was making decisions right now. He felt like he was going to faint.
Cap blinks at him, turning his face into Tony’s hand, and Tony takes this as a sign to begin unbuckling him. He starts at the bottom, undoing Steve’s ankles and knees before releasing his wrist. He walks around the table to do the other, back to the suit. The requested legionnaire has joined them, weapons trained on Amora. Cap’s fingers dig into his shirt as he undoes the last chest buckle.
“Eat,” Steve told him, and Tony stared at him a long while before sitting on the edge of the bed and doing as he was told. It was the meekest Steve had ever seen him, and he didn’t know what to do with that. He was Tony’s omega, and his alpha was upset because of something he’d done. He didn’t know how to fix it. “What’s that called?”
It is the simplest way to explain. It is the truth of this whole wretched experience, down to the ache in his breastbone when he thinks of all that they’ve been through together. Now, and last year when tentatively grafting together a superhero oversight policy stopped ending in screaming matches and started ending in awkward small talk, and then short walks to the elevator, and then, incredibly, their first coffee run. After that, it was like they’d broken open the cast that had been wrapped around their shattered friendship and found the bond still there, raw and aching and new. The year before, which Steve doesn’t like to think of at all, the end of which found them both back from the dead and terrified by a world shaped entirely by the brutal efficiency and borderline-sociopathy of Maria Hill and Reed Richards running a program that should have been built on warmth and ethics and a nurturing environment for young minds. The parts of that year that he cannot bear and yet returns to time and time again: friends and family splayed out in the street like bloody roadkill, faces made unrecognisable by wounds or twisted in anger. Tony, bleeding under his shield. Tony, above him and wreathed in light, metal that he had always trusted to catch him when he fell and be his shield and sword and eternal companion now slamming against his face, his ribs, bruising and breaking the skin.
“If you wish to make your soulmate happy, you must remember your First Corinthians. Love is patient. Love is kind. It does not envy. It does not boast. It is not proud. It does not dishonour others. It is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered. It keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.
“I just needed a second!” Steve snaps, curling one hand in his hair. It echoes, eerie, and he exhales sharply, tries to bring himself down. “I just wanted to be somewhere without the archetype falling in on me, but there’s nowhere to go, I’m just…”
Steve knows he’s being goaded. Tony can tell, by the way his expression shifts into exasperation. But he rubs a hand over his head, sucks in a breath, and asks: “Would you mind talking to me about what being intersex means to you?”
Steve cracks a smile. He pulls his last boot off, then his shirt, and Tony watches the play of muscles in his back with his tongue pressed hard against the back of his teeth. Steve’s body is magnificent, a miracle every single time.
“How is she able to hit me?” Tony asks, hissing as something digs into his upper ribs. The plating on his back is warped from the strength of her impact. “Is she just overpowering Loki’s protection spells?”
DUM-E examined him carefully, clutching gently at his shirt, before rolling away. Steve watched with a burgeoning grin as he brought back a familiar black sweatshirt, the one Tony left down here for when his body temperature inevitably started to drop after he was 24 hours or more into an engineering binge. By day three he was usually freezing in just a t-shirt, and so he kept this grease-stained, sweat-soaked, basically-a-shop-rag black hoodie down here for when he got desperate but was too absorbed to come out of his work haze. In the early days, before Tony had let anyone take care of him, Steve had seen him work until his flesh was covered in goosebumps, shoulders shaking, stomach snarling like an animal despite DUM-E’s attempts to appease his body with his sweatshirt and cups of mysterious green sludge. He was pretty sure that Tony would have died without the little bot, and Steve reached a hand up to give DUM-E a few affectionate strokes before taking the sweatshirt from its claw.
