Sam blinked, forcing his focus back on Jody who was watching him with a concerned crease between her eyebrows. “Yeah, I, just – yeah I’m okay.”
“We went to bed last night and when I woke up this morning, he was gone. Doors were still locked, windows closed and all of his stuff was there. I know Alex, he didn’t just leave.” Matt seemed desperate now and Dean felt sorry for the boy. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know who else to call,” he muttered.
who nodded in confirmation, just as a small figure with long blonde hair came into the room and Dean could only just stop himself before he would have shot her.
“What I don’t understand is, why. Why would Demons burn down the Roadhouse?” he asked, waiting for Ellen to answer.
“I said shut up!” Sam yelled and before Dean could even register what was happening, Yellow-Eyes was tensing up, his eyes growing wide in shock as he stared at Sam who was glaring back, his breath coming out in hard, violent pants, one of his hands held out and then Dean watched in stunned horror as the Demon started chocking, black smoke coming out of his mouth, his nose, his very pores and then Sam clenched his fist and –
“Name’s Dean. That’s my brother Sam.” He pointed at Sam who did his best to look as non-threatening as possible. “And those two are Benny and Lenore. We run a network that helps people like you.”
“A lot of yelling, things being thrown around. The father was drunk a lot and when he was, he beat Max. Broke his arm two times. He said there was not a day where he hadn’t seen something like that. The uncle too and the step-mother just watched and did nothing.”
When Cas came into the room a few minutes later, Dean pretended to be asleep. He didn’t want to talk, couldn’t talk. Not about this. Not now. Knowing Cas, he could probably see right through his plan but instead of saying anything, he simply climbed under the covers and snuggled up to Dean and Dean was grateful for that, at least there was one thing he hadn’t lost yet.
Dean sticks his tongue out at Cas and is rewarded with a deep chuckle that definitely doesn’t chase the cold from his skin. “Caught in the act, huh?” Dean asks once they meet up with the newlyweds.
“Would you shut up? Dean,” Sam grabs the front of Dean’s shirt, a desperate move he hasn’t pulled in years, not since their dad died and Dean had to tell him the news, “it’s me. I know you, man, and after everything, can’t you just be honest with me for once? What the hell’s going on? Why are you lying to everyone?”
Castiel’s relationship with faith has never been simple. As a child he questioned more things than not, and eventually he learned he was better off keeping his mouth shut lest his parents give him disapproving looks, and when he became a teen and learned how to research his own answers, his faith continued to wane. How, he wondered, in a church that supposedly follows the teachings of someone who instructed His disciples to love others first, could that same church openly mock and hate others?
“How do you know they’re wedding bands? Maybe I’ve finally hopped onto a fashion trend bandwagon.” Okay, not his best work, but it’s not ideal circumstances either.
.”) hunter. It’s times like these that he must remind himself Dean’s stubbornness is one of the things he loves about him. Although…
he and Cas aren’t there yet relationship-wise, but he can’t help feeling left out, like Cas is deliberately keeping something from him when they’ve never had anything at all between them.
Dean swallows and nods, and Castiel has to blink away the moisture in his eyes so he can watch the myriad of emotions flit across Dean’s face. “Are you sure?” Dean rasps. “I’m not—I’m not worth it, Cas. I’m nothing.”
Dean’s hand lands on Castiel’s knee right about the same time Chuck sits back, fake smile plastered across his face. Naomi clears her throat and refills her glass of wine. “I can’t wait for you to see the dress Michael bought for Rachel. She’ll be the most beautiful little flower girl this town has ever seen.”
“Castiel Novak. I’m here with my husband.” Dean shoots him a thumbs up as the lie trips off his tongue, and Castiel rolls his eyes.
That decided, Castiel decides to take advantage of his time and grab a quick shower before Dean finishes breakfast, but as he makes his way to the hall, he’s nearly bowled over by the younger Winchester barreling through the foyer. Sam tosses a quick apology over his shoulder, but just as quickly as he rushed in, he disappears into the kitchen at the back of the house.
He’s jerked from his thoughts by the all too familiar squeak of the Impala’s door, and he makes his way through the thinning woods to where the grass meets the road. Dean’s standing there, one elbow on the roof of the car while the fingers of his opposite hand curl tightly around her window frame, and his face, just as painfully beautiful as it was the last time he saw it, is slack, eyes wide and lips parted, and Cas cracks.
“Mm-hmm.” She pushed her dark hair back over her shoulder and revealed a nametag with PAMELA written on it in purple marker. “They’re for anal play. Would you like to see one?”
“They’re mad, Cassie,” Gabe grins. He leans forward and stage whispers his next comment. “Don’t tell them we’re working together!”
“Dean, I—I want you.” There’s a sharp inhale, and Castiel isn’t sure if it came from himself or Dean, but he plows on, fisting his hands in the front of Dean’s coat and choking on his words. “I don’t know how to do this, but I want to try. I want to try…with you.”
“Don’t you dare,” Mary warns as Castiel finds the discarded slice on the hardwood floor. He locks eyes with the woman for a split second, torn between helping his friend and the maternal fear Mary Winchester can strike in all her boys with a single look.
They laugh, and Castiel nods, tracing a finger around the rim of his cup. “I’ve run into a bit of a speedbump with the main characters.” Eileen nods, urging him on, and something in him snaps. “There’s all this tension where there shouldn’t be,” he blurts. “Romance was never a part of the story, not because I don’t think gay cowboys existed in the late 1800s, but because these particular cowboys aren’t gay. One is engaged to a lovely girl back home, and the other is a widower who’s stated several times he’ll never love again.”
Naomi sips her tea quietly before humming in agreement. Then, rising, she plasters on her best smile and reaches out to shake Father Joshua’s hand. “Thank you for coming, Father, but we shouldn’t keep you any longer. Would you like to take some tea for the road?”
A few hours later, pockets full of cash and riding a pleasant buzz, they stroll into The Equalizer. Multicolored strobe lights bounce off every available surface, highlighting the sensuous, twisting movements of the men and women on stage, and the gyrating bodies pressed against each other sparkle with glitter and what looks like neon paint. Craning his head to get a better look, Dean spots a bright orange handprint on a woman’s scantily clad ass and grins. He loves theme nights.
“I’m well, thank you.” Both women smile at him, but they’re waiting expectantly, so Castiel rubs his hands together. “I came to see if I may be of assistance. If you’ll have me, of course.”
Dean nips Cas’s jaw in defiance but brings his hands back to rest on Cas’s sides. “You’re no fun,” he grumbles.
Chuckling, Dean wraps his arms around Katie and sits up, gently kissing her hair once they’re upright, and it’s as if Castiel’s whole body relaxes as he watches them interact some more. He knows he’s staring too much, and he knows he’s got the doe-eyed look about him, but he can’t help it. The warmth blooming in his chest feels too good to be embarrassed about. Still, he feels like a spectator in the moment and doesn’t want to intrude, so while the Winchester brothers chat amicably in the hall—Katie’s now perched on Dean’s hip and playing with the pockets on his canvas jacket like it’s her job, something Dean only encourages by hiding small toys and pieces of candy there whenever they’re visiting—Castiel backs away in search of one of the women to see if he can be put to work.
Dean throws up a finger, his mouth working around an insult and coming up short. After several moments of staring into his friend’s smug face, he finally mutters, “Get in the damn car.”
Dean blinks and stares at him while his chest heaves and the flush ebbs from his cheeks. Gaze flickering down, Castiel’s breath hitches when he sees Dean’s kiss-swollen mouth, lips still shining, and it takes everything he has not to carry Dean back to the pool house and take him apart, but somehow—though the exact process remains a mystery—Castiel summons enough strength to instead drag his thumb lightly over Dean’s bottom lip.
It feels like the whole bar is cheering for them, and the heat from before makes its return in what he’s sure is a firetruck blush that reaches his hairline and ears, but all Dean can do is stare.
“Dude, you’ve met Naomi. She’s awful! She called Cas when we were down in Vegas a while back and was going on and on with her usual crap, but he was drunk, and he said something about being married to shut her up, so once word got out, I offered to be his fake husband or whatever. Then we got here, and it was so easy, Sam, like nothing had to change between us to keep up the act except the occasional kiss, and even that wasn’t too far off because when Cas drinks tequila he gets
The crowd disperses quickly, a few people lingering in the rows of folding chairs but most heading out of the cold as soon as possible, so it only takes a few moments for Castiel to make his way over to Dean. They join hands as soon as they’re within reach, and Dean pulls Castiel toward him, twisting their arms together at his side.
“Dean,” Castiel mumbles, his lips never fully leaving his best friend’s until after the name is out.
Cas just keeps wiggling his fingers into his gloves. Then, glancing Dean’s way out of the corner of his eye, he says, “Perhaps, but you’ll be eating your words when your fingers go numb.”
He suffers the process on autopilot, staring at nothing between other departing passengers’ heads and collecting his bags silently before heading into the chilly air outside. From there, he flags down a cab and rests his head against the seat as they pull away from the curb. The two hour flight from Kansas wasn’t nearly enough time to rest, and by the time the cabbie is helping him pull his suitcase out of the trunk, Castiel is
She feigns a thoughtful expression, tapping her chin with a finger. “Now that you mention it, no, you haven’t.”
Raising her own glass, Jo smiles broadly and gestures above their heads. “Because, you have to kiss under the mistletoe.”
Dean’s hands linger on either side of Castiel’s neck, and his mouth is pressed into a thin line, but Castiel can see the gears turning behind his green eyes, mind already working on any number of possible solutions. In the end, when Dean takes a breath and locks onto Castiel’s gaze, there’s only one he offers:
Her eyes narrow some, but she quickly covers by gazing up through her lashes. “Chastity,” she replies, biting her lip.
Dean cuffs him on the chin and smirks, eyes full of laughter. “Don’t wander around in there too long. Don’t want you to end up lost.”
Pamela narrowed her eyes, but she was still smiling and hadn’t reached for the phone yet, so that had to be a good sign, right? “What are you, seventeen?” she asked softly.
Castiel leans over the counter and frowns at his reflection before pinching a strand covered with hot pink…something between two fingers. He remembers going to The Equalizer but doesn’t recall having a paintball fight with anyone, but then, there were a lot of colors. He’ll have to ask Dean in the morning. “And?”
Father Joshua regards him carefully in the warm glow of the porch light, and his normally smiling eyes remain blank. Tilting his head a bit, he says, “You’ve done well for yourself, I hear. Two novels, a home, a husband…You’ve much to be proud of.”
Hands slide around his middle, and Dean closes his eyes and leans into the warmth at his back as Cas hooks his chin over his shoulder. “What’s wrong?”
“You did always tell us to be polite because it was the right thing to do and not because of someone’s gender,” Castiel agrees.
Immediately, Dean’s hands are on him, fingers wrapping tightly around his biceps and steadying him. Somehow, though Castiel can’t fathom as to where, he finds the strength to look up, and Dean is right there, his familiar features doing wonders to calm Castiel’s racing heart. “We’ll figure it out, okay? We will.”
Dean forgets for just a moment that this, all of this, is fake. He indulges himself in the idea of having a partner to share his life with, someone to come home to and curl up on the couch with, someone who supports him and who he can support in turn whenever they need it, someone to laugh with and tease, someone to make love to and know that they’ll still be there in the morning. He’s never really entertained the idea of marriage because he’s never found anyone he found a romantic connection with—as a result he’d self-identified as aromantic years ago, thank you very much—but now, with his hand locked in Cas’s, he thinks to himself that maybe pretending to be married to each other for the rest of their lives won’t be so bad.
“These two men are very firm in their morals, and they’d never go back on their commitments. To do so would drastically change their character arcs, and that’s nothing compared to how their own relationship would look to others.”
“I only ask because you don’t seem like the type to get his hands dirty. Oh, sure, you can discuss contracts and the bottom line all day, but do you know how to scrub a toilet or pack a box? Have you ever spent the day on your feet, slinging drinks and serving food or stocking shelves and mopping floors before coming home and feeling the burn in your muscles from a hard day’s work? Do you know the true value of the dollars you make?” Patrick points to Dean with his toothpick and raises his brows. “I bet he does, so tell me, who’s the real adult here?”
Gently taking the hand away from his face, Dean turns Cas around and guides him up the strip until they reach the hotel. Once there, Cas breaks from his incessant rambling to again puke, this time into a potted plant beside the elevator bank while Dean distracts the hotel staff when they look too closely. As soon as the doors slide open, Dean ushers Cas inside and repeatedly jams the button to the tenth floor so they can get the hell outta dodge before someone catches wind of their mess and adds it to their bill.
“Fine,” Castiel manages, the syllable hardly escaping his lips. He’s dreamt about this moment, about the reckoning he would surely face from his childhood friend, about the judgement those soft brown eyes would surely hold if they ever met his own again, and
Cas shakes his head and curves his spoon into his own slice, carving out a perfectly normal sized bite like the weirdo he is. He eats slowly, maintaining eye contact with Dean the whole time, and swallows before wrapping his long fingers around his cup. “Your enthusiasm never ceases to amaze, Dean.”
“Oh! Of course!” Castiel trips over his own feet in an effort to get to her quickly, and Mary laughs softly.
“Hey, uh,” Dean swallows and shifts, dropping his hand. “You took off pretty quick back there. Everything okay?”
As everyone files out, hugs and promises to swing by the Roadhouse are exchanged, and then Cas and Dean stretch Baby’s legs on the backroads around town while they wait for the Winchester house to calm down for the night.
Dr. Piccolo’s voice asked. Sam growled and pressed the thick cotton harder to his skull, but it did little to drown out actors’ voices.
Dean’s expression blanks, and he swallows hard before recovering. “Not cool,” he mutters, turning on his heel.
Ellen waves a hand and goes back to shuffling her cards. “John told me years ago that he thought you two had it bad for each other, and your mom mentioned it a time or two herself. It’s a parent’s job to know these things, Dean, and they always have. Hell,” she snorts and turns sharp eyes on him, ”most everyone around here figured it out by the time you graduated high school. When you two hit puberty, it was hormone central in here. Couldn’t keep your hands off each other.”
Cas’s face softened, and he cupped Dean’s jaw, tilting his face up to look him in the eye just as a lone tear made its way down the side of Dean’s nose. Sam took that as his cue to start easing out of the room, but if he hung around the corner to hear Cas’s reply, who could blame him?
Sam whirls around in time to see Gabriel’s silhouette tilt his head back and blow out a long stream of smoke into the air. The security light illuminates the cloud as it dissipates, and Sam frowns. “You called us out here to quote movies?”
Cas just swallows and nods, not taking his eyes off his hand. Again, in a voice so soft Dean can barely pick up on it, he thanks Dean.
“Cas!” he calls, rushing inside and looking around. The kitchen is cold and grey, and Dean’s chest heaves as his eyes bounce around the room. “Cas!”
After Castiel watches her go, his hands curl into fists, and he turns on his heel, intent on giving his older brother a piece of his mind, but he’s met with a familiar face that instantly causes his anger to fizzle out and die. “Dean.”
“Easy, angel,” Dean murmurs, placing a hand on Cas’s shoulder and squeezing gently. “We knew it wouldn’t be easy, right?”
The phone is silent long enough that Castiel wonders briefly if she’s hung up on him, but a quick glance at the screen shows the seconds still ticking slowly by, so he puts it back to his ear. After what seems like ages, Naomi sneers, “
“You have a point,” Cas says. “But I still think you’d find Denver more than welcoming. When are you going to visit? We’d love to have you.”
to be married, but unlike his own family that they’ll probably never see again outside of funerals and weddings or the occasional visit with Gabriel and Kali, they’ll see the Winchesters several times a year and have to maintain this crazy façade. What has he done, roping Dean into a lifelong commitment such as this? How is it fair to him? Castiel never should have offered up their lie as a solution to the interrogation he walked in on earlier, but Dean had looked so stricken by the onslaught, and no one would listen to him, and Castiel just blurted the first thing that came to mind.
his words, but he’s still sloshed, and it won’t be long before crying Cas makes an appearance. Pushing him onto the bed, Dean scoops Cas’s feet up and tucks the thick comforter around his body. Then he drops into a crouch and catches Cas’s wandering hand. “You’re the best man I know, Cas, and you deserve the world.”
” Dean’s grin grows impossibly wider, and he produces a twenty from his pocket. “My buddy here is a little shy. Think you can get him to loosen up a bit?”
about that now. Luckily, Sam seemed to get the hint because he stopped asking questions and instead stared out of the window in silence.
Sam cast another look back at the picture. He could see it in Ben’s eyes, the resemblance, in the line of his shoulders and shape of his legs. His eyes flitted over to the girl.
Lisa shook her head, chuckling lightly, “I don’t think I’ve ever seen him so enthusiastic about school,” she commented.
“Sammy –” Dean hesitated. He wanted to tell his brother about the deal, about everything that had happened but the words kept getting stuck in his throat, choking him.
But instead of answering, Sam just nodded towards the corridor and Dean followed his brother outside.
“Yeah, they disappeared. No one quite knows why or how but Eileen – you’ll meet in her bit – her grandad was one of ‘em. She brought us here when we met her.”
Dean flashed a quick glance to Cas who nodded almost unnotably. The phones were dead, they both knew that.
He saw that Max was holding the gun again, calmer this time. He exchanged a look with Cas, trying to tell him what he would do, before approaching Max. Except, Max had let go of the gun and now it was floating in mid-air, pointing at him. Dean’s eyes grew wide and he stopped, unsure of what to do. Dean heard the clicking of the safety, before the gun swung around towards Alice.
“They’re Angels, and they would kill you in a heartbeat if it fit their agenda.” She let out a soft sigh. “I’ve only met a few and they don’t come down here often, but we always try and stay as far away from them as possible.”
“I noticed,” Adam muttered and relaxed a little bit, “Listen, Dean, I swear I had no idea. About you and Sam. John never talked about himself or his life. Hell, I thought he was a mechanic until like a week ago.”
She looked about his age, maybe a bit younger, with long, blonde hair and a cocky smile, twirling a knife between her fingers as she sat at one of the tables, boots propped up, and for some unfathomable reason she reminded him of Dean.
“You alright, son?” Bobby’s voice sounded far, far away, but Sam could hear the concern and tried to nod his head.
His eyes had adjusted to the new brightness and he took the opportunity to have a proper look at Lenore. It was obvious now that a few years had passed since they had last met. Not because she had gotten older, she was a Vampire after all, but because those years hadn’t treated her well. Her hair was no longer long and shiny but dull and short, her skin seemed unnaturally pale and her eyes were those of a dead person. Dean wondered what had happened.
“Well, this certainly is a surprise,” she announced, not sounding surprised at all. “Come on then, Sam and Dean, I ain’t got all day.”
’, except it never came. Instead, Dean merely looked at him, calm and patient, and it was that look that made Sam cave, spilling the story of the past 15 years for the second time - the hollowness, the hurt, the pain, and every person he cared about abandoning him because "I can't be what you want to me be, Sam. I can't be anyone but me, but that's just not enough for you, is it?", because "You're so angry all the time, and it scares me" because "I feel like I'm a stand-in for something and I deserve better than that".
A few days later they got back on the road to pay a visit to Missouri Moseley. Sam seemed a little bit better now or maybe he just started hiding it better…Dean wasn’t all too sure. It was weird…they used to be so close, used to be able to read each other like open books, but somewhere during the past 7 years that had gotten lost and now, when Dean looked at his brother, all he saw was a stranger with little Sammy’s face.
“Very little,” Missouri answered, “Your father took me to the house, hoping I could sense the energy, the echo of the thing that did it.”
“Are you taking his side now?” Claire butted in from the sidelines, her vice and signs barely concealing her anger, “He tried to attack Cas –”
Cas sighed before continuing, “Apparently, Steve Wandell was an old friend of your mum. Johnny Campbell was a distant relative of her and if you just look deep enough, you’ll find that any person that has ever known your mother, is dead. Family, friends, colleagues.”
“So,” Claire spoke up once her plate was all but licked clean, “Dean’s brother Sam. Any good stories about Dean as a kid? I’m fresh outta blackmail material.” She wagged her brows at him, and paired with the anguished “Oh, hell, no,” from Dean, it startled a laugh out of Sam.
He tried his best to ignore the nagging voice in the back of his head because Cas would be fine. Cas was strong and independent and fucking badass and sure, he might be upset if something happened to Dean but he’d get over it…wouldn’t he?
He joined Dean in the garage while his brother tinkered with whatever car he was currently working on, listening carefully as Dean explained what he was doing, handing on tools and, on one memorable occasion, getting his own hands dirty under the hood of a car.
“It just doesn’t make any sense.” Sam shook his head. “Why would I have these premonitions unless there was a chance I could stop them from happening.”
Sam looked over to his brother, taking in the hard line of his mouth, the regret in his eyes, and waited.
“It wasn’t a question,” Claire snapped back from where she was almost towering over Dean, “I was just letting you know that this is happening.”
“He had no reason to leave without telling us,” Max’s mum, Kate cried out, “And he left all his things behind!”
“Unless I have to,” Sam finished the sentence. For a moment he considered asking why Dean wasn’t taking one as well, but then decided against it. It was probably better to not question him on their first job together.
” a rough voice sounded through the line, so painfully familiar it might as well have come straight out of Sam’s memories.
Dean’s eyes grew wide, he should have expected it. He should have known it. He was hardly listening when it was Sam’s turn to be put on trial
“Dean Winchester if you’re even thinking of finishing that sentence I swear, I might actually still kill you.”
Suddenly, Cas was flung across the room. Dean could see the Hunter’s head hitting the kitchen counter, and it took him everything not to cry out and run for Cas’ help.
“Assuming that I knew it was your Nest, which I didn’t,” Dean replied teasingly but neither Lenore, nor the unknown Vampire smiled. “Who’s your friend anyway?” he asked instead.
“I wasted a bullet. He wouldn’t be proud of me, he’d tear me a new one,” he explained. He knew his dad and he knew how he reacted to mistakes. Bracing himself, Dean slowly raised the Colt and pointed it at John, cocking it. “You’re not my Dad.”
?” He really hadn’t meant to put that much emphasis on that last word, but couldn’t help himself, really.
“You can by being there for him.” They separated and then it was Cas’ turn. Dean smiled faintly at the picture of his boyfriend and his as-good-as surrogate father – two of the most important people in his life. “Cas?” Bobby asked.
They didn’t talk about it, and Sam probably knew that it was wrong. People didn’t just start having dreams about the future, but whatever. They did their job and that was it. Other cases were more to Dean’s taste, like the wishing well in Washington or the Witch in Iowa; still, Dean had a bad feeling. He couldn’t even say about what exactly, just that it was there, every time he looked at Sam.
“What – what is this place?” Sam finally managed to asked, taking a seat that would allow him to watch Dean. He still wasn’t entirely convinced that this was real.
Ben nodded, seemingly satisfied, and Sam could hear a soft sigh coming from Cas, just as Dean and Clair re-entered the room, carrying plates of pancakes.
“Hi Sam,” he said cheerily, throwing a fleeting glance over his shoulder before turning back to the stove, “Sit down, dinner’s almost ready. Bobby, get the others would ya?”
It was an awkward meal. Both teenagers still watching him like hawks, Cas and Dean making stilted conversation about a potential Coven down in Wichita that someone named Donna had called in and which Bobby was apparently currently checking out with her, Eileen occasionally butting in with a one-handed sign, while Sam made sure to appear wholly engrossed in his food, not that anyone was paying attention to him, anyway, but considering how the day had gone so far, Sam found, he really didn’t mind. It wasn’t until all the pancakes were gone and Sam helped Dean clean up the kitchen that Dean acknowledged him.
It wouldn’t be, Sam knew. They were different now. Grown up and no longer living in the shadow of their father. And this wasn’t a Hunt but a rescue mission. And yet, Sam appreciated the sentiment.
Sam nodded. “Yeah.” Maybe, if he just said it often enough, it would be true. “What’s with all the people?”
“Dean?” Sam asked again. It certainly looked like his brother. He was older than Sam remembered him to be, which really shouldn’t have come as a surprise and yet it was. In Sam’s mind, Dean was still barely old enough to drink, a cheeky smirk on his lips while he practically drowned in their dad’s leather jacket. The man standing before Sam now was not that. There were deep lines etched into Dean’s forehead, crow’s feet surrounding his eyes, and the odd grey streak running through his hair.
Cas smiled faintly, his eyes were staring in the distance, narrowed ever so slightly. He was thinking.
Finally, Cas did look over at him, the softness replaced by something deep and considering, his head tilted to the side. “You seem upset.”
“Good.” That he actually meant. It was good. They might not know each other very well but Lisa was a bright, pretty woman and Dean really wished for her to be happy. For the kid to be happy.
dead! And I couldn’t – I didn’t know what to do and then Ruby showed up, telling me how she could help me and that she could keep the others safe, that they were in danger…I was protecting you!”
Cas looked up from where he was lying on the bed, “You don’t think she had anything to do with the bodies” It was a statement, not a question but Dean replied anyway.
“All good, Bobby,” Dean answered. He’d pushed himself off the car, fiddling with his phone, his eyes darting to the Impala as if he was thinking of jumping back behind the wheel and driving off.
If Benny took offence to Sam’s behavior, he didn’t show it, merely dropped his hand and got the beer without another word.
“She was an it.” Finally, Sam turned his head and Dean wished he hadn’t. Sam’s eyes were cold, empty. Dean felt his own blood freeze in his veins as he stared at his little brother, the boy he had raised, the angry man that had walked out of them all these years ago.
“So, where do we start? “ Adam asked and Dean was just about to answer when Cas held up his hand as a sign for him to wait.
Sam’s eyes remained on Dean and every bone in his body was fighting against it, talking. He had never been a fan of words, for him, actions were much more important but maybe Cas was right.
“Yes, you do.” Dean couldn’t see Cas’ face but there was a fond smile against his neck. “What is it?”
“It matters if you’re still upset about it,” Cas disagreed and even though his eyes were fixed on the road, Dean knew that Cas’ attention was on Dean, assessing him, “You think it was selfish of Sam to leave.”
Dean wasn’t sure what he had expected but it hadn’t been this and he was a bit thrown off when he started talking again, “Cas. His name’s Cas and he’s…great.” He was dimly aware that he was probably looking like a whipped high school girl but he didn’t care. Not really. Cas
“No. And you don’t have to be religious to study religion, in fact, I believe it’s much easier when you’ve got a more neutral view on things.”
The fact that the Vampire knew his name wasn’t exactly reassuring but Dean refused to give in to the creeping fear that was starting to build up inside of him; he needed a clear head.
“For fuck’s sake! We don’t have time for this,” John exclaimed, “Sam, you wanna kill this Demon, you gotta trust me.”
They worked in silence, mostly anyway, going through dusty, thick binders with faded writing, stacking possession on top of possession, witch coven on top of witch coven, deities on top of deities.
From the kitchen, Sam could hear Dean puttering around as he made breakfast, the faint smell of pancakes slowly drafting into the War Room, and wondered what he was thinking. Did Dean really want him here or was he just tolerating him out of pity? After all, Dean seemed have had it all figured out, with his perfect little family and his weird Network, while Sam was lost at sea, barely staying afloat. Maybe he should leave. Do Dean a favour. Do himself a favour. Maybe he should start over somewhere, put it all behind him. A clean slate.
Jody arched a single eyebrow at him over the rim of her cup. “I should hope so. It’s been, what, 15 years since you last saw him?”
“I do,” he confirmed and Lisa smiled. It was probably the first honest smile he had seen from her since he had shown up.
Dean nodded slowly, not quite convinced. What if he was infected? What if Sam was right and he would kill this kid?
Dean’s eyes grew wide, because for all the words Cas had said to him over the years, for all the times, he had said that he loved him, he had never, not once, said that he needed Dean. It was terrifying and encouraging at the same time.
“Most of that ain’t my story to tell,” Jody replied. She must have noticed Sam’s scowl, because she signed and asked, “How much do you know?”
Cas was still sitting at the Network Station, a question in his eyes the second he saw Dean and Sam descent the metal staircase, and Dean gave him a barely perceptible nod. Eileen, Claire and Ben were sitting at the map table, the two kids glaring at him with matching anger and distrust, while Eileen seemed more curious.
They were back in the motel, Dean sitting on his and Cas’ bed, Adam on the other, while Cas was leaning against the wall, his arms crossed in front of his chest. He didn’t answer, but rather snorted contemptuously and continued glaring daggers at Dean. “I’m sorry, okay?”
Sam’s ears were ringing while he tried to process the words, the bar around him slowly fading more and more into the background, colours and noises bleeding together into something incomprehensible.
Bobby grumbled, hanging his jacket over the back of a chair, but left to get the others, whoever that was.
“Oh mum, please let me. Please, please, please, please, please!” Ben begged and Dean thought he might actually start crying now if Lisa said no and Ben’s mum seemed to be thinking the exact same thing.
Swallowing the rising panic inside him, Dean managed to hiss, “Why? You wanna ‘talk’ to him as well?”
“I’m not gonna do anything,” Dean told her, “But Benny and Lenore over there –” he pointed at the two people in question, “—are gonna take care of you. Lenore’s got her own Nest, she will take you in. Sam and me, we’re just here to make sure Emma gets home safely.”
“Yeah, yeah, I know,” he grumbled, his eyes fixed on Sam, wary and appraising as if he wasn’t sure what to think before his face smoothed over, “Sam.”
“Thanks Cas.” Dean finished the map by marking Emma Manning’s office and stepped back, phone in hand, while Sam stepped closer, “Cas, have you talked Claire?” Cas was off speaker now, making it much easier to concentrate on the map on the table, trying and failing to find a pattern. “Alright, good, that’s good,” Dean was saying behind his back, “I’ll talk to her when we get back. Thanks. Love you.”
“What, a dude’s not allowed to change his mind?” his brother asked, toeing the line somewhere between defensive and insulted, before apparently giving up on both. He deflated with a deep sigh, rubbing the back of his neck, “Look, man, I get it. You been gone a while, things are different now, it’s a lot to take in, just –” He dropped his hand, shrugging while shaking his head, clearly looking for words. “—It ain’t just all black and white, you know?”
“Bobby hasn’t lived here in years,” she answered, crossing her arms firmly over her chest, “Why do you need him?”
As it turned out, it didn’t take half an hour for Ben to come home and when he did, Dean was a nervous wreck.
“Dammit, Cas! Pick up the fucking phone!” he swore but of course that didn’t work either. Frustrated, he threw his cell phone on the bed and ran his hand through his hair. “They’ve got dad,” he finally said.
“This is it,” John pointed at the walls. “Everything I know about the Yellow-Eyed Demon. We’ve been searching for it for years now, never finding anything. Until now. Ten months ago, I picked up a trail.”
He didn’t have to tell Adam about the fire, about how he had carried Sam out of the house. About the broken shell of a man that John had become afterwards.
“Hospital,” Dean instructed before bringing his attention back to his brother who still seemed to be mostly out of it.
“I won’t.” Dean raised his head to meet Cas’ eyes, trying to make him understand. Hunting was all he knew, all he had, and he had done so many horrible things that he just didn’t deserve an ordinary life, and even if he did; he knew what was out there, how was he supposed to ignore that?
“You really need to work on your pick-up lines,” Cas chuckled but he still laid the book aside and shifted so that he faced Dean.
Without a further word, Baker was gone and Cherry kept staring at the door, before she turned back to her screens.
“About what?” Max seemed suspicious and Dean couldn’t blame him. Not after the way they had just barged in on them.
Something passed over Dean’s face, too quick to really make out before that was gone too, and all that was left was the carefully guarded expression Sam had seen all evening.
“I was raised into it, I guess,” he began slowly, “Being a Hunter…it’s all I know. I wouldn’t know what else to do; what else to be, but you…Adam, you’ve got your whole life before you. Don’t throw that away.”
He helped Bobby man the phones by doing the research that was needed to keep the people out in the field safe.
Jo’s words were echoing in his head but it was like they were in another language. A language, Dean didn’t understand.
The third thing Sam noticed was that he, himself, didn’t really care as much as he probably should considering what dad had always told him growing up –
John was still not answering his phone and at this point, all Dean wanted was to punch his father in the face.
And it was, Sam realized. The hallways of the Bunker seemed to stretch out endlessly, winding and twisting and turning into a labyrinth almost impossible to navigate. There was a shooting range and a gym, a hidden dungeon, a fully stocked infirmary, and a rooftop garden with a beehive.
The next time, Sam had a premonition, was a few months later in early September in Guthrie, Oklahoma.
“Cas is sending the info,” Dean answered, “We’ll talk to her tomorrow. Let’s just have a look around for now.”
“Then you won’t.” It sounded so easy coming from Cas. “But I also won’t stand by and watch you destroy yourself, Dean.”
“Thanks.” The water felt incredibly good, washing away most of the disgusting taste in his mouth, and before he knew it, the glass was empty and Jo refilled it with an eyeroll.
“Yes,” Cas nodded, searching in the pile of papers on the table until he found what he had been looking for, “The real mother died 25 years ago in a house fire.”
Jo glanced at him, a strange look on her face. “I’m aware,” she said, “Word travels fast around here.” Sam nodded, he wasn’t exactly surprised. “Now, I’m gonna hit the hay, ‘cause I only just got back.”
Dean thought because no normal person would walk like that, unless they’d anticipate a threat. Dean wasn’t sure how long they waited like that, quietly waiting in the dark, listening.
Greg McQueen and his family lived just a few houses from the Serendels but when Dean rang the doorbell no one answered. With a shrug, he turned around again and made his way back to the motel. He still couldn’t get the girl out of his head. The way she had stared.
“Right.” Sam drew out the word, glancing back and forth between Charlie and Jody, hoping to get some kind of explanation. None came. “Uhm – Nice to meet you?” he said, though even to his own ears it sounded more like a question than a statement.
“Get out,” Dean growled one last time and he swore if he had to repeat himself a third time he would –
– and then take it away from him. Sam clung to him as if Dean was his last life line, the only thing keeping him from drowning, his body shaking violently as he slung his long arms around Dean, holding him close.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Sam interrupted, trying and failing to ignore the painful twinge of his heart.
Dean thought but he couldn’t bring himself to say that. It was too much. Too personal. “Don’t know,” he answered instead, standing up to get his third beer of the night. “I guess I grew up.” Which was true as well. He was by far not the man anymore he had been at 22.
“Ground control to major Tom,” Adam’s voice dragged him back into reality and Adam laughed when he saw Dean’s expression, “Where’d you go off to?” he asked jokingly, “Never mind. What do we do now?”
Some part of Sam revolted at the thought of just letting them go, some deep-seated instinct screaming at him to strike first before it was too late. His hand flexed around the handle of the machete. What if this was a trap? What if Fiona was just biding her time? But no. He shouldn’t think like that. Couldn’t think like that. Dean clearly knew what he was doing, and the tears on Fiona’s face were real. She was scared.
“Not really.” Cas shrugged. “I don’t even know why I’m so upset, I mean…Ellen’s still alive. And Jo. It’s just the Roadhouse…it was like home to me,” he admitted.
“I know that Bobby.” Dean was growing more and more frustrated. “I guess I just hoped that…nevermind. I have no idea what to do next,” he admitted. Cas was driving, while Dean sat defeated in the passenger’s seat.
“Why do you care, anyway? You left, remember? You hated him for the way he treated us. What changed?”
“Dean Winchester.” It seemed like the Vampire couldn’t decide whether to be scared or angry to see him but that was okay. At least he wouldn’t die just yet. “I didn’t think I’d see you again.”
“The doors, Dean!” Bobby yelled at him, but Dean just shook his head and pointed at Sam. A large gash ran across his forehead and when Dean cupped his face with his hands, Sam gasped and snapped his eyes wide open. There was fear and confusion in his face and in that moment, it didn’t matter what Sam had done. None of that mattered, because he was
He had a very strange feeling when he finally got into bed next to Cas, like he had lost something. A life, he had never had in the first place.
Something passed over the sheriff’s face, then, something like surprise and recognition, but it was gone before Sam could dwell too long on what it meant. “Give me a moment,” she told him, backing away to her car and getting in. Sam saw that she’d pulled out a phone, talking to someone, though her eyes were still firmly fixed on Sam. It wasn’t a long conversation. Phone still pressed to her ear, she got back out and walked towards him.
Feeling numb, Dean slowly turned around to face him fully and ran a hand over his face into his hair, tugging lightly.
Both Matt and Alex nodded. Satisfied, the two Hunters left the house and got into the, while Dean tried to reach Sam.
“He couldn’t say. But he did tell me where he was and what he saw. I already talked to Bobby and he told me the same thing I told you; we have to leave. Now.”
Dean had never set foot in an amusement park in his entire life. It hadn’t even crossed his mind, unless, of course, for a case. Like now. But this, seeing all those families and kids, running around, laughing and being happy? It did something to Dean. Something he couldn’t quite describe but he definitely didn’t like it.
It didn’t take long for everyone to finish off after that, dousing the room into the sleepy kind of silence that only existed after a particularly good meal.
“You know what? I don’t care. Fuck this shit.” He stalked off, not even knowing where it was he was going.
“Jim Miller. Saginaw, Michigan,” Sam repeated while he wrote down the name and Dean really wasn’t sure what to think of that. Foreshadowing dreams of complete strangers.
“FBI, we’d like to ask you a few questions. Were you working here last Saturday –” he glanced at the name tag on her shirt, “Kelly?”
It was already pretty late and Sam had long since fallen asleep but Dean was still awake; sitting at the table, sipping at his beer and staring into the darkness.
“All victims were in some kind of relationship,” Cas began, “But there’s no real connection between them.” He pointed at one of the pictures and continued, “Ferhad and Hayley Baitan,” he explained, “Both used to be Hunters but then Hayley got pregnant and they moved here. Ferhad worked at the local bar as a bartender, James Jayden was a lawyer, Jack Serendel was a tax accountant and Greg McQueen owned a bookshop.”
“You gonna be okay at the Bunker or do you wanna go ahead and leave, or what?” Dean asked, eyebrow cocked but barely masking the fluttering nerves in his voice and the tension in his shoulders as he awaited Sam’s answer.
Singer Salvage Yard was a sad shadow of what Sam remembered it to be. The cars still standing around were rusty and broken beyond repair, most missing wheels and windows and whole doors. The house didn’t look much better. It was clear that no one was living here anymore, that no one had lived here for quite some time – the windows were boarded up, though Sam was almost sure he saw a salt line through one of the gaps, all the doors were locked, and the whole place was eerily quiet.
“You wanna kill her, you gotta go through me first,” Dean said and he could practically hear Cas groaning internally.
“Non-humans,” Eileen supplied and Sam nodded his head, “Maybe at first,” she answered, “I was raised a Hunter, much like you, and it took some adjustment to get over that, but –” She hesitated, signing something Sam couldn’t understand, before saying out loud, “—It’s worth it.”
“Who are you?” he finally asked, hating the way his voice broke ever so slightly. This wasn’t Sam. It couldn’t be. “What happened to you?”
Dean stared at Bobby. His surrogate father. The man that supported and accepted him, no matter what and if there were tears filling Dean’s eyes, neither of them said anything.
“Where are dad and Sam?” he asked finally; the others exchanged uncomfortable looks before Ellen answered, “We don’t know.”
He could feel everyone’s eyes resting on him, he was sure that someone was talking but he didn’t hear anything except his own heartbeat and Jo’s words repeating in his head, over and over and over again.
It took them a few hours to get to the address and Dean was definitely not prepared for what he saw. There were police officers everywhere, neighbours standing around, watching, and a body bag that was being carried towards an ambulance. He didn’t even have words for it and apparently, neither had Cas or Sam. They just sat in the car and starred at the scene before them.
“He also has a choice,” Cas argues calmly, “He’s 20 years old and if he wants to Hunt, then that is what he should do. You and Sam, you’re the only family he has left and he looks up to you, Dean. He accepted you as his big brother the minute he saw you. He trusts you. At least try and give him a bit of trust in return. He’s not Sam, Dean.”
“Well then I don’t see how you’re responsible. It was just a dream Sam. You couldn’t have known it would happen. You couldn’t have.”
“No, no, you let me go!” he struggled, trying to fight his way out of Cas’ grip although he knew that it was hopeless.
“Yeah.” Sam gulped, hoping to find the right words for what he was about to say next. “Dean, I am sorry for never calling. My problem was with dad, not you. I should have never cut you off like that, I realise that now.”
“I can’t,” Sam whispered and finally turned around – except – Dean immediately wished he hadn’t. Dried blood and dirt covered Sam’s face and his clothes but that wasn’t the reason Dean nearly threw up. No, there was something in his eyes. Something dark. “I’m sorry, Dean,” he repeated before turning back to the door and sticking the gun,
Bobby was still waiting in his room, the ever-present scowl firmly in place as he instructed Sam to get dressed and meet him in the library.
” Dean could practically her the head tilt Cas probably did right now and usually he would have smiled, laughed, anything except this wasn’t usually and he more felt like crying than anything else. “
Trying not to think about Missouri’s words, the three men left the house and just when they were about to get back into the car, Dean’s phone rang.
Without a word, Sam walked past Bobby and inside the house while the older man stayed behind, his eyes falling on Dean and Cas who were still standing by the car.
While Dean was driving them back to Sioux Falls, Sam was sleeping in the back seat and Cas was silently sitting next to Dean, watching the scenery outside.
Claire huffed and grabbed the backpack she’d set down on the floor. “You can’t tell me what to do,” she snarled, “In case you’ve forgotten, you’re not actually my dad.” And then she was storming away, up the staircase and out of the Bunker, while Dean sat dumbfounded at the desk, staring after her, his face going through several emotions Sam couldn’t quite make out before it settled on deep-seated guilt and regret.
“They’re just doing their job, darling,” Lisa answered and stroked her hand over Ben’s head, before turning back to Dean, “Thanks for the offer but I think it’s best for Ben to be here. Y’know…at his home.”
“Yeah well, he’d be a lot better if I was there with him,” Dean snapped and took the bottle, almost emptying it in one swig before slamming it back onto the counter and walking out. He couldn’t breathe. Ellen was right, he
Sam gave a sharp nod to signify he understood, though he couldn’t deny his nerves growing more and more fluttery. This was different. Before, with their father, they’d aimed to kill. Always. But this was different.
“So was she.” Cas stood over the second body, a girl with brown hair, her skin torn open, bloody. Dean stared at the empty eyes and the eyes seemed to stare back at him, while he tried to ignore the lump in his throat and the constant
Dean took one last considering look at the contents of trunk before lowering the false bottom and shutting it with a decisive
“Same thing he was always after,” Dean replied, confirming Sam’s suspicion, “I went to Bobby’s for help. We found what we could, realized what we were dealing with, so he sent me to the Roadhouse. Not this one. First one. It burned down, couple years ago.”
Finding the actual entrance was easy and Dean soon found himself at the top of a flight of stairs; the air was cold and dry and Dean raised the flash light to see better. The bare stone walls were surprisingly smooth, the stairs, even. Someone had invested a lot of time in these tunnels.
“Hey, bitch!” Dean called and the mother Changeling turned around, realizing too late that Dean was holding his flamethrower.
When they were back in town, the first thing Dean noticed was how empty it was. How quiet. Something was definitely off. They drove past cars standing in the middle of the street, some engines still running; all of them empty. Smashed windows in stores and cafes, bloodstains on the pavement and –
“So,” the sheriff prompted when they’d reached the kitchen. She waved a hand at the table and Sam sat down while she opened the fridge and got out two beers, handing one to Sam, who muttered his thanks. “Bobby says he hasn’t seen you in a while.”
The second they got out of the car, Bobby enveloped Sam in his arms and for a moment it was like no time at all had passed and Dean could see his baby brother, only 18, angry and scared, standing in the arms of the man that was more of a father to them than John had ever been. Then, Sam pushed back and the illusion broke. Sam wasn’t 18 anymore. He was 25. He was a widower. He was a man that had lost everything within one night.
“Don’t be sorry. I’m sure you did good. I’m proud of you, Dean,” John smiled warmly at his son and Dean blinked confused.
Sam couldn’t remember falling asleep or even closing his eyes, but he must have done because now he was awake and his eyes were open, and he wished he could go back to five minutes ago when he’d been blissfully unconscious.
“Huh, yeah maybe. It’s worth looking into, anyway,” Dean mused before jerking his head at Cas’ other hand, “What’s that?” he asked, “Dirt?”
“Yeah, so I heard,” Sam muttered, looking down. The sheriff was still watching him, and now that the first shock had worn off, Sam thought he could hear real anger underneath Bobby’s words. “I just – I just wanted to see you, I guess.”
“I said,” Dean pronounced through gritted teeth, “Let’s go for a drive.” He pointed at the spiral staircase with an expression that left no room for argument, and Sam couldn’t help but notice that his brother had firmly placed himself in front of Cas.
“Nah, man. It’s probably a good thing you did,” Dean answered, much to Sam’s surprise, “I’d’ve just dragged you back on the road, probably. I wasn’t kidding, y’know, when I said I was jealous. Felt like you’d turned your back on me. On dad.”
Dean wanted to ask what he was talking about but the expression on Sam’s face was enough to stop him. Sam was serious about this and if there was even the faintest chance for them to stop this from happening, they would.
“That is my name.” Cas voice was dry and flat and, impossibly so, even deeper than usually. Sam ignored it.
“Ash. He found somethin’, pretty big by the sound of it. Called me, said we should come back and to get you guys as well.”
“Ellen told me. She wasn’t very pleased to see me at first but she got around, helped me and Cas out a couple o’ times, too.”
There was more, Sam could tell. Things Dean wasn’t saying. Things, Sam wasn’t even sure he wanted to know about, not right now, anyway. It was all a lot to take in as it was.
“Do you want to talk now?” Cas asked casually, eyes fixed on the road, but Dean knew that his full attention was on the Hunter next to him. For a while, Dean didn’t answer but that was okay; Cas would wait.
“Not on my watch, it isn’t.” Dean leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms, and giving the impression of a man who had made up his mind and wasn’t about to change it any time soon, if ever.
“Dude, I’m 19,” Claire protested, swiping a fry off of Dean’s plate despite having her own fair share.
“Yesterday, she came back from a Hunt. Everything was fine, she said she’d take a shower and then we wanted to have dinner. She never showed. I thought maybe, she’d got a call from you guys,” Ellen explained. She seemed calm but the half empty bottle of whisky next to her told a different story.
The motel they had checked into was actually quite decent but Dean still hated it. With a low groan, he let himself fall onto the bed.
“Dean,” a distant voice was calling his name or maybe that was only in his dream. Maybe – “Dean!” Dean opened his eyes and saw that Sam had turned on the light, stuffing things in the duffel bag.
“No, Cas.” Dean shook his head firmly. “None of this is your fault. You were trying to do the right thing, you
Sam froze in his tracks at the sound of the deep, gravelly voice, casting a glance to his left where one of the doors opened into the kitchen. Cas stood leaned against the counter, a coffee cradled in his hands, wearing a faded AC/DC shirt and sweatpants, his hair sticking up in all directions.
“You keep saying that, but what does it mean? I – I want to understand, Dean, I really do, but I can’t if you won’t tell me, alright?”
“We will. This is not going to happen again. Ever.” There was conviction in John’s voice and Dean felt himself relaxing. Maybe it wasn’t such a bad thing that their father was with them.
“What the hell?” Sam stood frozen in place, trying to take everything in at once and failing miserably as his brain short-circuited.
“That I’m not the only one with secrets. Bela Talbot? Cas? What else is there that I should know about? How many people have you killed during those eight years? How many innocent people have died because of you? How much guilt, do you really carry around?”
Dean paused and looked at his brother incredulously. “Because the Demon knows we’re in Salvation, all right? It knows we got the Colt. It’s got Dad – it’s probably coming for us next.”
“It’s alright,” Dean said, “Dad did that, lying. I mean it’s part of the job description, being a Hunter, but he…” Dean shook his head, trying to find the right words, “He was really good at it.”
“Er…I was upstairs with Sammy and dad was possessed by the Demon. I don’t know what happened after that. Where are Sam and dad, anyway?” he asked, but was only met with more blank stares and silence. “What? What is it?”
“We’re not going in at all,” Dean replied, “If we break down that door guns blazin’ they will attack and that’s not what we want. This ain’t a Hunt, Sam. We’re gonna watch them, we’re gonna see what’s going on in there, and then we’ll talk to them.”
Sam stared at his brother, wondering if he was drunk or maybe hallucinating. He had to be. There was no way Dean – the guy who’d given him a beer and an awkward slap on the back after his first real heart break at 16 – was suddenly being thoughtful and understanding and, dare he say, emotional.
It was easier said than done. Leaning in his seta, head cushioned by a jacket, Sam closed his eyes, but his mind couldn’t rest, kept going round and round in circles, through every possibility, every what if. What if he made a mistake? What if he got hurt? What if Dean got hurt? He tried to imagine it, the feeling of blood pooling over his hands, the sound of Dean’s ragged breaths as the life drained out of him, the sight of his green eyes slowly dimming until there was nothing left, and it would all be Sam’s fault. He would lose even the smallest pieces of home and family he’d found over the last few months.
John shook his head. “No Sam. I want to stop losing people we love. I want you to go to school, I want Dean to have a home. I want...I want Mary alive. It's just...I just want this to be over.”
Cas was right of course, not that Dean would admit that. In fact, his thoughts had already drifted off again and he was wondering what a Demon might possibly want with a bunch of humans.
“No idea,” Dean answered, taking a sip from his coffee and revelling in the bitter taste, “We’d just finished that case in Denver, you told Cas about the human sacrifices, and then Sammy called in the middle of the night saying that the Demon that killed mum was back and that it killed Jess. We hit rode and you know the rest…”
There was a moment. A fleeting glance, a twitching smile, the lingering tension lifting just a bit, just enough for the weight of the years to not seem as heavy, for the distance between them to not seem as wide. It was just a moment, but it was enough to make Sam think that maybe, just maybe, they could go back to how they used to be.
death – and yet Dean had been blind, had been unwilling to see just how different his brother was from the kid he had once known…and the fucked up thing was…none of that made him any less Dean’s brother and Dean would be damned if he let anything else happen to his little Sammy.
“Hello to you too, Dean,” Cas answered drily without turning around. He was standing in front of a pin board, exhibiting all the known facts about the case so far. “And no, there is nothing unusual about the house or the family. The Millers moved in five years ago, before that, there were no sudden or violent deaths. However, I did speak to an old neighbour of the family from when they were still living in the old house and he spoke of child abuse. Not sure how that is going to help us, though.”
For a second he considered joining Bobby and Jody, but the thought better of it. They looked happy enough without him third-wheeling and not for the first time he wondered what the hell he was even doing. Why had he come? It was clear that Dean didn’t care about him anymore, neither did Bobby. There was nothing here for him except painful memories and a distant might-have-been. What if Sam had reached out earlier? What if Dean had come to him to look for dad? What if Sam had never left? It was pointless, of course. Daydreams wouldn’t fix the lie that had become his life, but he also couldn’t go back. There was nothing there for him either.
Adam beamed at them and stood up to leave the diner and Cas was just about to follow him, when Dean held him back, “The fuck are you doing, man?” he asked irritated.
“Not because of something stupid like this.” Cas shook his head. His voice was still low, calm, but Dean would have preferred it if Cas had been shouting. The cold in his voice was almost unbearable. “And it’s not like this was the first time. The Ghost in Florida?”
“I get it,” Adam continued, “You don’t know me and you don’t trust me and you’ve got your own baggage at the moment with your brother but…I don’t know. Whatever. Forget I said anything.” Adam stood up, shuffling towards the sink and Dean’s head was spinning, his mind racing.
Sam hesitated, just for a second, just enough to see the flash of insecurity in Dean’s eyes. “Sure.”
“We’re not ready!” Dean argued in exasperation and put on his jacket. Apparently not seeing any other option, Sam followed him reluctantly.
“Oh right, this is Sam, my brother,” Dean introduced them and Matt nodded. “What’s up man?” he asked and sat down, the others following his example.
“Huh.” Dean glanced at Cas and saw that he had tilted his head ever so slightly, the way he always did when he didn’t understand something or when he was thinking. It was adorable. “What about your nightmare?”
When Dean woke up the next morning, the sun stood already high in the sky and Cas was still sleeping. With a smile, Dean watched his boyfriend before carefully getting out of the bed and walking downstairs to the kitchen. When he entered the room, he saw Adam sitting at the table with a cup of coffee clasped in his hands.
The knocks on the door had gotten less and less frequent, less and less insistent, Dean’s voice through the door more like distant reminder of the world beyond this room than a genuine call for dinner, almost like he didn’t even expect Sam to answer anymore. He probably didn’t.
“What the hell?” Dean exclaimed as soon as they had put some distance between them and the road blockade. No one answered. It had been a rhetorical question anyway.
They did return later that night with an arsenal, a thermos of coffee, enough food to feed an army, and Cas on speed dial, sitting in the Impala safely hidden by the shadows of the trees, watching as the cabin slowly came to life.
Could that be it? He hadn’t really payed any attention to it, until now. Too preoccupied with looking for his brother but…it made sense, didn’t it? The Demon had killed their mum, theirs and who knew how many others’ and that hadn’t just been for shits and giggles. There was a plan there, Dean just couldn’t see it yet. Something had happened that night, the Demon had done something to Sam, and Mary had interrupted, and now Sam was in danger once again and now that last meeting with Sam made sense too because Sam knew. Sam had figured it out and he had tried to protect Dean by staying away from him.
He remembered that night as if it had only been yesterday. The night his childhood had ended. The night he had become responsible for Sam; he’d had one job, Just one. Keep Sam safe. And he didn’t even seem to be able to do that.
“We didn’t call her Ellen,” Cas said softly. They were sitting at the bar, each with their own beers while Ellen empty her whisky.
“I was being chased by Hellhounds. Dean is good but he isn’t that good, so no, it wasn’t fault. He couldn’t’ve stopped it. Not forever, anyway.”
The drive back to the bunker was silent but much more relaxed, Dean absent-mindedly humming along to the radio while Sam contented himself with staring out of the window, thinking about what Dean had said. He still wasn’t sure he understood all that was going on, or how he felt about Witches and Werewolves suddenly being the good guys, but maybe he could try. Dean had trusted him with this, the least Sam could do was return the curtesy and not run off. Again.
Dean sighed, “I’m worried about Sam,” he whispered, “He seems different. I don’t think he’s coping that well.”
He woke up one morning, staring at the crack in the ceiling, and smiled. How long had it been? Two months? Three? The Bunker was silent, the clock on the wall telling him it was still too early for anyone but the night shift to be up, as good a time as any to go for a run, Sam decided as he got up and dressed.
It might have been a coincidence but Dean didn’t believe in those. Cas seemed to have noticed too, “Do you think there is a connection? Between her death and your mum’s?” he asked.
At some point, Dean must have fallen asleep because when he opened his eyes again, it was already getting dark. He stood up with a groan; Cas and Adam weren’t back yet. Dean took his phone, a bottle of beer and the pack of cigarettes and went outside to smoke.
“Of course,” the widow nodded and led Dean through the corridor. It was a nice house as far as Dean could see; the walls were covered with pictures of Hannah and Jack and a little girl, whom Dean assumed was their daughter. They looked happy.
“Go on then,” Dean broke the awkward silence that had settled over them, “I can see you dying to ask questions, so ask.”
Cas huffed, the shock in his eyes, slowly giving way to anger. “I was with you, Dean. I held you in my arms when your heart stopped beating. I sat by your side for
Dean didn’t answer immediately. He knew exactly what he was looking at, or rather who, but he couldn’t quite believe it.
“This thing goes south just...get the hell out. Don't get yourself killed all right, you're no good to us dead.”
“Well, I guess Adam and I will go over to the morgue,” he heard Cas muttering but didn’t really react to it. Suddenly there was a hand on his head, running through his hair and a pair of soft lips, ghosting over his skin. “When we come back, I want you to talk to me, okay?” Cas whispered, “I love you, Dean.”
“Yeah, pretty sure Cas already did that,” Dean mumbled, mostly because he really didn’t want to be the one to tell Ellen. The woman was an angel, but he was still a bit scared of her and he definitely felt guilty. It was his fault that Jo started Hunting in the first place after all.
Dean twisted his neck so he could see where Cas was and spotted his boyfriend still sitting in the car, observing them with an unreadable expression.
Dean stayed until he heard Lisa’s breathing even out but before he left, he wrote a note for her telling her to call him if they ever needed help.
So, Dean started with the first thing that came to his mind. The night he had met Cas. He told Sam how he had gone to that bar and ended up in Cas’ bed. It wasn’t exactly easy talking about it; he had never had to before but he realized that this was something Sam needed and, as the big brother, it was his job to give that to him.
They sat down for a quick breakfast, going over what little they had so far. Eight victims, all of different ages, genders, and colours; seemingly random.
He had left the car by now, machete in one hand, a flash light in the other because it was slowly getting dark and Gordon had said something about tunnels. Dean walked towards the line of trees, cautiously listening for any sounds but all was quiet.
After getting in the Impala, they followed John through town to a small, shady motel, the kind of motel Dean would have never picked by himself.
“Cas’s right. We need to get somewhere safe; there’s a clinic just down the road,” Sam explained and let them to a small building.
“Maybe Cas is right,” Dean broke the silence and his brother looked up in confusion. “We should get out of here, it’s too dangerous,” he specified.
“I wanna know why. Why’d you do it?” The desperation in Sam’s voice made Dean snap out of his thoughts.
“You’ve been gone quite a while, Sam,” Bobby chipped in, his voice calm and steady, “Things are different now.”
“I know that,” Sam quickly defended himself, “It’s just – it’s not fair! I tried, Bobby. I really did. I only wanted to be normal for once, but everyone just keeps leaving!” Sam let out a heavy breath, a little shaky on the tail-end, while Bobby simply looked at him for a long moment before giving Benny a gesture and the man behind the bar hurried over with another soda. Sam wondered distantly if Bobby had quit drinking as well. It seemed even more unlikely than for Dean.
He remembered the feeling he had gotten more and more often during the past months, the nagging fear...He hadn’t been sure what it was until now. The fear of losing Sam. Now it was too late, he had already lost him, had lost him the minute, the Demon had gone after Jess. He saw now that Sam was too much like John, ridden by anger, revenge. He, Dean, had spent so much time stepping into his father’s footsteps, he had never stopped to notice who Sam had become without even trying.
Something passed over Cas’ face, like a smile but infinitely sadder. “Because you were about to leave without saying goodbye.”
Dean opened his eyes. He smelled wood and dust and old coffee mixed with beer and whisky. The bed on which he lay was soft and comfortable, the air warm. With a low groan, he sat up and looked around. Undoubtfully, he was in one of Ellen’s guestrooms.
Distantly, he registered that the noise had stopped, which probably meant that Bobby and Ellen had shut the gates but that was far away and he only had eyes for his little brother.
Dean closed his eyes, a cold shudder running down his spine. He had hated Bela but she certainly hadn’t deserved that. Hell. No one did.
“After dad died, the way he died,” Dean started to explain, his eyes fixed on the lake, “I was messed up, man. I mean, you know how he was – obsessed bastard, making all the wrong choices for all the wrong reasons, dragging us down with him, but – but I still worshipped the guy, y’know, so – so when he was gone – I dunno –” He shook his head and shrugged his shoulders, his hand clenching and unclenching against his leg. Sam realized Dean was still wearing his pajamas, and no shoes. “I just wasn’t dealing, I guess,” Dean finally concluded, “Hit the road, one case after another, drinking myself to sleep every night, taking unnecessary risks, ‘cause – I mean this life, it ends young and it ends bloody, so I thought, what the hell, might as well take some fugly sons of bitches with me when I kick it, and I nearly did a couple times, and – and I didn’t care. Shit, some part o’ me kinda wanted it that way.”
On impulse, Dean closed his eyes and took one deep breath. He could feel the blood pumping through his veins, the adrenaline, the anticipation. He could hear his own heartbeat, fast and steady and for the split of a second, it all seemed to slow down.
“Sure. Would you want to keep doing this if you had an actual home to live in? Wife or husband? A kid?”
“I know. I know you were just trying help, but – but you can’t keep taking people. Or killing them.”
The man led them through a dimly lit corridor towards a heavy door with a sign saying ‘Staff only’. They went inside, six or seven screens hanging on the wall, each showing a different part of the park.
Dean stared at the remains of the Roadhouse, one of the few places he himself had ever felt at home, his eyes fell on Bobby and Ellen and Jo, his family, and on Adam who seemed helplessly overwhelmed by everything that was happening but who didn’t want to show it. He reminded Dean of himself.
“What would I do? I’d kill every last one that laid a finger on him and then I’d lock Sam up in Bobby’s panic room so they can’t get to him,” Dean answered harshly.
“Sorry,” he muttered. He knew it wasn’t enough. He knew Cas deserved better than that, better than him but this was neither the time, nor the place to talk about this. Cas shook his head, still glaring at Dean but there was also a great amount of relieve.
It had been three months since Dean had come back from the dead. Three months since John had died. They still had nothing, and Dean was getting more and more frustrated. It was like Sam had vanished from the face of the earth and there was no Demon to be found anywhere, which made Dean even more suspicious.
“You hear that, Sammy? Shut up,” Yellow-Eyes parroted mockingly, “I think your brother is slightly upset over what you did here. I can’t say I blame him…You’ve been
It was strange, this. Domestic. Off, in a way Sam couldn’t quite put into words as he watched Bobby and Eileen deeply engrossed in a conversation he couldn’t read, while the two kids mostly alternated between wolfing down their dinners and throwing bits at each other with increasingly bad aim, and Dean and Cas had a conversation that seemed to consist solely of intense eye contact and the occasional head tilt.
“If you even had a spark of reason in that thick head of yours you’d do it yourself, Dean. Have mercy on your brother, cause I sure as hell won’t once I find him. He’s hanging out with Demons, d’you know that? Fraternizes with the enemy. He’s murdered people in cold blood. He’s the Antichrist.” If it wasn’t for Gordon’s eyes, Dean would have said that he’d lost his mind, except there was no sign of madness, no insanity. Gordon truly believed every word he said; that Sam was evil, that he needed to be put down before it was too late.
“Claire calls it the Supernatural Support Network,” Dean told him with a mocking undertone, shaking his head, but Sam could also clearly see the fondness he felt for the girl, “We got a system in place and if anything pops up, we check it out, see what we’re dealing with and help where we can,” he went on to explain, more serious now, “There’s hospitals and morgues and funeral homes and stuff giving out blood and organs to whoever needs it. We got a cure for Vampires, long as they haven’t fed, yet. Actual support groups for anyone who can’t go and see a regular shrink.” He shrugged his right shoulder. “It ain’t perfect but it works.”
There were footsteps approaching from behind, slowly and haltingly. “You boys okay?” came Bobby’s gruff voice and when Sam turned around, he saw both Bobby and Jody stand not too far away, watching with clear concern in their eyes.
“It’s here. It’s found us.” John jumped to his feet and looked around. “Sam, salt lines, now,” he commanded and Sam nodded sharply while turning towards the door. Just when Sam had reached out for the door handle, it suddenly slammed shut.
“Couldn’t she help us? She’s a Psychic after all; maybe she knows a Spell of some sort,” Cas suggested.
They finished their meals in silence and when they got back into the car, Dean was still thinking about his father.
He thought and stayed silent; so did the five Vampires. From afar, Dean could hear steps carefully treading through the dark tunnels,
Talking to the police the next day and looking at the body of Michael Richardson brought about nothing new, except, perhaps, the confirmation that they were, in fact, dealing with Vampires, and that the death of Michael was no great loss for anyone.
Sam thought he could hear the sarcasm underneath the words, though he wasn’t entirely sure, but still he barked out a surprised laugh.
“Thanks man,” the guy said through a deep yawn, and both stood up, giving Sam an acknowledging nod before disappearing down the hallway that led to the bedrooms, while Cas took Krissy’s place, and Sam hovered awkwardly next to the desk.
“Er – hello.” Sam sounded unsure and glanced at Dean who mouthed a quick ‘later’. He couldn’t deal with this right now.
“Okay,” Cas said, slowly getting out of bed and walking towards Dean, “Okay. Sit down, take a few deep breaths. I’ll pack up and get dressed and then we can go.”
The next morning came and the sun seemed to shine just a little bit brighter and a little bit warmer through the curtains into their motel room. Dean lay awake in bed, listening to the steady rhythm of Adam’s and Cas’ breathing. Eventually, Dean got out of bed to get some breakfast.
“Dean?” Frowning, Cas took a tentative step forward, and another, and another, until he stood by Dean’s side, who let out a deep sigh.
Sam switched on the light in the kitchen, discarding his bag on a chair and walking over to the fridge for a beer. It was the last one. Hadn’t Jane said she’d buy groceries today?
It was pretty anti-climactic, all things considered. Benny and Lenore, led the four Vampires outside, clearly looking out for any attempts of escape or attack, but nothing happened, and the second they were out, he and Dean rushed in. The room was dark and dusty, and there, on a ratty couch, lay a woman, tied and gagged and blindfolded.
“Why don’t you introduce me to your people,” Benny suggested, the softness in his voice, strangely at odds with his gruff looks.
It was raining when they arrived at the cemetery where Jess was buried. Dean and Cas got out of the car, walking through the lines of headstones towards Jess’ grave; there was no one around but Dean immediately saw the fresh flowers on the ground.
Without giving the other man any time to react, Dean went into reverse and accelerated. He saw the men raising their guns, aiming at the car, “Down!” he yelled quickly and turned the car around. Shots went off and he was pretty sure that he ran something or someone over but he didn’t care. All that mattered was that they got away from those maniacs as soon as possible.
“She always takes the night shifts,” she told them, “But I’ve barely seen her since they found Michael’s body.”
“I had another dream,” his little brother confessed and Dean nearly groaned. He really couldn’t deal with freaky premonitions on top of this too. However, he held back and instead pressed for more information. “About what?”
“Hope ya’ll are hungry, ‘cause there’s a lot,” the older Winchester announced, not noticing, or perhaps not caring, about the tension hanging over the map table like a particularly thick cloud.
The look around took them on a ride through town, not that there was much to see. The hospital was small, its parking lot nearly swallowed by the forest stretching out behind the building. The police station down the road wasn’t much different Sam noted when they passed it on their way to the Pint Tree. The owner of the bar, one Mrs. Down, had a few choice words to say about Michael Richardson, though none of it was particularly helpful in figuring out what had happened to him.
Dean was startled by the last sentence because, yeah, maybe, he might’ve, sorta projected something there. But he still stood by what he had said, he didn’t it that Adam was so eager to step in his father’s footsteps. But Cas did have a point.
“Good,” the doctor said before throwing a question look at Sam who nodded. “Andrea, I need you to come with me.”
Through a door at the end of the room, he thought he could see rows and rows of bookshelves, but Bobby turned right, into a hallway and Sam began to understand why it was called the Bunker. The walls seemed to be concrete and there were no windows in sight. They were underground.
Dean saw Sam fighting against the force binding them, saw his lips moving and his eyes glaring daggers at the Demon but he didn’t hear the words. He felt sick and disorientated and angry. Angry with John because why the hell had he left in the first place and angry with Sam for having a chance at living a life away from all this and angry with Cas for risking his life for Dean. Again. But most of all, Dean was angry with himself. He should have known better than to let John go off to Lincoln all by himself. He should have been there.
“What were we supposed to do?” Dean questioned, “We get a text message with coordinates, you’re the only one who does that, so excuse us for thinking that maybe you decided to meet up with us,” he hissed angrily; it was all he could do, not to raise his voice because
“Well, this is it…he was upstairs and must have tripped.” Hannah made a vague gesture with a hand towards the stairs they were standing in front of and Dean nodded.
However, all the horror scenarios in the world, couldn’t have prepared Dean for what he was seeing when they reached a graveyard in the middle of nowhere. There was a crypt there, an old crypt, with heavy, wooden doors. And there was Sam, standing at the door, holding a gun in his hand.
Dean shivered lightly. He felt like shit, because Adam had just lost his family and now he was trying to figure out how to deal with that. Because Adam was a Winchester and he, Dean, and Sam where all he had left of a family. Because Dean knew what Adam felt and he still tried to push him away.
He’d never had to do this before. Never had to deal with the fallout before. Their dad had always made sure to be as far away as possible by the time the victims were found, hadn’t cared for what became of them as long as the creature responsible was dead and gone.
“You. What do you want?” she repeated and pointed the knife at Dean before noticing what she was doing and quickly putting it aside.
It was getting late and Dean had read every page of John’s Journal in the search of whatever they were Hunting, without success, when Cas called him.
“Child abuse,” Sam repeated, this time louder, “Cas, you said that the neighbour knew something about that. What exactly did he say?”
“No, you’re not,” Bobby grumbled as he strode past Dean, “Now stop whining and move your ass, princess.”
“Of course, I knew,” Yellow-Eyes exclaimed with an exasperated eye-roll, “I was the one who closed the deal. Your daddy was so eager to die, he didn’t even ask for his ten years.”
Jody nodded. “He built a gun that can kill anything. No idea how it works, though. Same with this knife they found. It gets the job done.” She shrugged and sat down on a wobbly looking chair in the corner. “There’s some spells,” she went on, “And then – then there’s Angel Blades.”
” Cas was practically begging now and there was a part inside Dean that wanted to do exactly what Cas had just said.
“Yes, in fact, that’s why we’re in town. We were looking into the accidents that happened around here,” Cas explained, his voice becoming business like in a way it always did when they talked to witnesses.
So he did. He told Cas about the darkness and the blood and the little girl. He told Cas about the feeling of power and control. About the voice in his ear.
“Talk to me, Dean,” Cas interrupted his train of thoughts, “Tell me about Sam. He went to Stanford, yes?”
Dean felt like the punchline of a bad joke, sitting at a dinner table, in the middle of a Hunt, next to his boyfriend, and his half-brother, while his ex-one-night stand was serving lasagne, her son was talking about girls and cars, and her soon to be husband was asking awkward questions.
“Right. And it’s so much better when it’s Cas who dies, is it?” Dean felt anger rushing through him. He wanted to punch something, scream, anything, that was better than this.
“Okay so we should definitely check out the vics’ families again,” Cas concluded and the other two nodded. “Now, I believe you wanted to see Lisa?”
It wasn’t fair. Sam had tried and tried and tried to lead a normal life, but it never seemed enough, and now here he was with a Hunter who wasn’t even trying and yet had it all and so much more and it wasn’t fair.
“Book on North Mythology. Bobby called, he said there might be something in Utah that looks like human sacrifices.”
It was Kate who answered, “We know. We’ve been hiding out here for months, living of rats and stray cats. It’s humiliating.”
Maybe it was five minutes, maybe half an hour, before John finally stirred. He opened his eyes and blinked lazily several times.
They sat in the SUV, Cas behind the wheel and Dean in the passenger seat, they had tried to reach Sam once again that morning and when he hadn’t answered they had moved out to find him, except, Dean wasn’t sure where to start. He had thought that he knew his brother, knew his habits and all his faults but now that he actually needed it, his mind was blank.
It was a silent drive and they switched halfway through after Sam, lost in thoughts, ran over a red light and nearly crashed with a truck. Jody didn’t comment on it, merely suggested he pull over and let her drive the rest of the way, and Sam, too keyed up to argue, agreed. The closer they got, the bigger the knot of nerves grew inside of him, but it was too late to go back now. He could already see the sign to the town entrance.
It was only then, that Dean realised how scared Cas must have been. His shoulders were still tense and his hands were shaking ever so slightly.
“There. You can have this one,” Dean proclaimed, kicking open a door and revealing a generic bedroom, “I’m just down the hall. Room 11. Shower’s thataway. Kitchen to the right.”
“All good,” answered Dean, stepping up to Cas and giving him a peck on the lips, “I’m gonna go, make breakfast.” And then he was gone, off to the kitchen, and Sam tried his hardest not to meet anyone’s eyes, acutely aware of the stares he was receiving. Was it too late to bail now?
It was an odd silence that settled over them. Not uncomfortable, exactly, but tense and wary, and Sam didn’t think he could take it much longer. Making sure to not look too much like he was fleeing, he walked into the library, still in awe at the amount of books it held, and now that Dean wasn’t breathing down his neck he actually had the time to take a closer look. Half of the books, it seemed, were in languages Sam couldn’t understand, the ones he could, however, held every piece of information anyone would ever need or want when facing down the things that went bump in the night – lore and histories on every creature imaginable, whole sectioned dedicated to Demons and Gods, extensive records of Hauntings from all over the world, and more books on different kinds of Magic than Sam ever thought he’d get to see.
Dean stayed silent, he didn’t know what to say. Despite his instinct to mistrust this kid, he believed him; if only because the others seemed to do so. He took a closer look at the boy; he was tall, with short, dark, blonde hair and his eyes had something in them. Something strangely familiar.
“You’re gonna help Eileen here sort through some of the older stuff in the archives,” Bobby told him, one hand resting on Eileen’s elbow.
Dean could see tears streaming down Lisa’s face and he really wanted to close his arms around her. But he didn’t. It wasn’t his place.
“No.” He shook his head, still pacing the room. Thinking. “But there were several dead animals around here over the last couple months, so her Nest should definitely be here.”
“Dean.” It was Cas’ hand on his arm, squeezing gently that pulled Dean back to reality. Without saying a word, Dean walked out of the door, seeing two people on the floor; John was lying on his back, his eyes closed, like he was only sleeping, next to him kneeled a boy, the same one that had been at the Roadhouse four days ago, crying.
“It's gonna take me about a days drive to get there. - That's impossible. I can't get there in time and I can't just carry a gun on the plane.”
even was. He’d driven through the night and the better half of the day, barely stopping for gas. Vaguely, he was aware that it was a weekday and he should be in the office, except what was the point? He’d gone to Stanford, gone to law school, worked his way up the company ranks, bought a house and a car and a treadmill, he’d gotten everything he’d ever wanted, and yet it still wasn’t enough. It was never enough. Inside Sam’s pocket, his phone started ringing. He ignored it. It rang again. Sam pulled it out, recognizing the number on the screen as his boss’ and dropped the damn thing out of the window.
“I’m freaking out here, Cas,” Dean whispered eventually, “I mean, come on, seriously? Death visions? That’s not right, he’s not supposed to have those, he’s supposed to be the normal one of us.”
“Whatever you have from last Saturday,” Adam said eagerly, earning himself an exasperated look from Cherry, before she slowly answered, “There are exactly 100 cameras in this park, we are open from 10 to 6, which means there are 800 hours of footage from last Saturday,” Cherry said monotonously and the three Hunters stared at her for a moment before Adam reacted.
They made a quick stop at the Roadhouse where they had Ash check the coordinates while Ellen told them about Jo.
“No.” Madison shook her head vehemently. “It’s wasn’t Dean’s fault that I had been bitten by a Werewolf. That was before we even met. It’s not his fault that there is no cure. That I couldn’t live like that.”
“I just told you, Sammy,” Dean snapped back. He was on edge and the second he saw Sam flinch, he regretted raising his voice. This wasn’t Sam’s fault. “Sorry.”
“Was there any place in particular he liked?” Dean questioned further, “A hideout he had as a kid or something?”
He took a step back, looking at his father suspiciously. Suddenly, the light began to flicker and Dean cussed.
“You never told me what you did. Back then. Always that it was ‘the family business’. Well, I guess now I know. Dean Winchester, the Monster Hunter.” There was something like awe in her eyes. “Cas is a very lucky man,” she whispered eventually.
Sam returned the phone to its owner before stuffing his hands into his pockets, feeling strangely awkward.
“Not always,” his brother answered, eyes fixed on the cabin. There was movement inside, hushed voices, the creaking of wood. “But you gotta give ‘em the benefit of the doubt.”
“You have five missed calls,” the phone told him while Dean took a deep drag from the cig, quickly follow by a mouthful of beer. Two of the five calls, were from Bobby, two from Ellen and the last one from Cas, who had also left a message.
“Alright boys, keep it civil,” Bobby grumbled but there was fondness underneath and Dean couldn’t help but smile while he pressed his forehead against Cas’. Gently, he pulled away and faced Bobby and Ellen.
Sam woke up to a splitting headache and a crick in his neck. His mouth felt like something had died in there and been left to rot. Bleary eyed, he blinked at his surroundings. He was still sat at the bar in the roadhouse, though everyone else seemed to be gone and the first sunbeams filtered through the smudged windows, a bit too bright for Sam’s liking, making him groan.
He could see Sam lying on the ground, probably unconscious and made a decision. Staying close to the ground, Dean approached the gaping hole, swallowing the fear rising inside of him, edging closer and closer to his brother. From the corner of his eye, he could see Bobby and Ellen doing the same.
“So, you’re a dad, huh?” he teased, glad that his voice actually sounded the part, and even gladder when Dean flashed him a grin that barely hid the blush on his cheeks.
Fist fights with Vampires were not exactly something he could recommend; that much Dean could say after receiving a hit against his jaw. All he needed was to get enough distance between them so he could actually use his machete. The flash light had long since shattered on the ground and the darkness wasn’t really helping; he was in disadvantage here. Vampires didn’t need light, Dean did.
Too late. They were too late. Again. And Dean was slowly freaking out. This was the second death in a row that Sam had predicted and the second one they couldn’t prevent.
“What’s weird? What happened, Matt?” Cas asked, leaning forward slightly to give the boy his full attention.
“Don’t listen to him, Sammy,” John threw in but Sam’s attention was on Dean, “How do you know?” he asked.
“You mean for Dean and me,” Sam chipped in, “You want us to stay here, and kill this Demon by ourselves?”
“Hey, get this,” Sam spoke up, “Michal Piszczek had been charged with rape and manslaughter about thirty years ago, the girl died of suffocation. Pisczcek was in prison but got out about a month ago, then two weeks later, he vanishes and then turns up again, dead in his bed.”
He fumbled with his bag, trying to get the flamethrower out but he was too slow. He gasped when the Changeling’s fist connected with his jaw and for a second he was surprised at how strong she was, that is before she grabbed Dean and picked him up again and threw him against the wall like he weighted nothing. For a short moment, he saw stars, his head hurt and he was so tired. It would be easy to just stay here.
Next to him, Dean’s entire body turned to stone. “Sure, let’s focus on that,” he grumbled, turning the car down another mud track, before adding, “You got a problem with it?” There was a challenge in his voice, daring Sam to say yes, but Sam also thought he could hear the nervous tension straining underneath. He was worried. Perhaps it was that worry, more than anything else, that shook Sam out of his stupor.
out of practice, aren’t you? I cut my arms loose like two minutes ago,” he said and held up his free hands, “Cas?”
He sparred with Claire in the gym, learning to never underestimate someone just because they were a foot smaller than him, much to Claire’s amusement after his back had hit the mat for the third time in a row.
“I – I need –” With an unsteady hand, he raised his empty glass as an explanation and pushed himself too his feet, walking over to the bar for another whiskey.
“We got dead man’s blood and Cas taught me a spell or two that’ll slow ‘em down,” Dean answered, “Try not to aim for the neck unless you have to.”
Cas smiled, it was a real smile, full emotions that Dean couldn’t even distinguish, there was sadness and happiness, relieve and adoration and so much love.
“You’re not…you’re not asking me if he’s yours, are you?” she asked incredulously and finally turned towards Dean again who quickly retreated, forcing out a chuckle.
As if on cue, in that moment, the kid came running towards his mother and Dean was shocked to see how different he was. His eyes were exclusive fixed on Lisa and there was a hunger in his eyes. “Make them go away, mummy. I don’t like them here,” He almost whined.
Dean opened his eyes, realizing he was lying on the floor. Both, Cas and Adam were looking down at him, brows furrowed and eyes full of worries.
“So,” Ben broke the tense silence that had followed, drawing out the word, “Do I have to be worried you’ll kill me in my sleep?”
“You have no idea, do you?” Gordon asked quietly, “You don’t know what they say about sweet little Sammy…” his voice was a mixture of amusement and wonder and Dean hated it. He hated the fact that Gordon had such power, hated that he had a very good idea about what people might be saying about his brother. He hated himself for not being there to protect him.
kidding me?” Dean gaped at Jo, then at the rest of them, hoping that someone might yell ‘April’s Fool’, except it wasn’t April and no one seemed to think this was a joke.
“Jo?” he asked in disbelief, relaxing slightly but still, he didn’t lower the gun. He saw that Cas slowly pulled out a flask with Holy Water, while Jo’s attention was still on Dean.
Sam accepted the cup, barely keeping himself from frowning at Cas’ words. “I don’t think that’s your decision to make.”
The thing was that Dean Winchester, for the first time in his life, felt utterly and completely useless. He had no idea what he was doing with his life. Somehow, he knew that this was connected to seeing Lisa again and of course there was Ben. His son or maybe not, who knew? Dean certainly didn’t. The possibility of a life outside all this madness.
“Sam, don’t!” someone yelled but it was already too late. They all watched in horror as the engravings on the door began to move and Dean didn’t even realize that he could move again until Bobby rushed past him and shoved Sam out of the way. The engravings snapped in place and the doors began to rattle like something was pushing against them from the other side.
“I – I can’t –” he stammered, “I can’t tell. It takes at least three to four hours for the sulfur to show in the blood and it’ll be too late by then.”
“Then you can make a new one,” the sheriff replied, as if it was the simplest thing in the world. Her words and voice were kind and understanding, but there was something underneath that Sam couldn’t quite read, something final. The matter was closed. Draining her beer, Jody pushed herself up. “When’s the last time you’ve eaten?” she asked.
“What the hell?” Dean breathed out and got of the car quickly. He took in the scene before his eyes; black, charred pieces of wood and molten metal was all that had remained of the bar. He exchanged a look with Cas, checking if he was okay, if he could deal with this because this had been the closest Cas had ever gotten to a home after his parents had died and Dean knew exactly what it felt like to lose that. The blankness of the other man’s face, the hard look in his eyes, nearly broke Dean’s heart.
“We didn’t know what it meant. It started out as nightmares and now I get them when I’m awake and the closer I get to anything involving the Demon, the stronger they get,” he explained.
They only just managed to jump behind tombstones when the doors burst open and Dean could see a massive cloud of black smoke rushing over his head. A few feet away, behind another gravestone, he could see Cas and Jo, crouching on the ground. Staring at the sky in terror.
He shouldn’t be watching this, Sam knew. Cas and Dean were doing that thing again where they stared at each other, as if the world around them didn’t even exist, and Sam, as always, got the feeling of witnessing something incredibly intimate and very much not meant for his eyes. A light touch on his arm got his attention and he looked over at Eileen.
“Do you remember this man?” he reached into his pocket and drew out a picture of Julian Jackson. Kelly took it to look at it with a frown, before shaking her head.
Dean currently stood in front of a picturesque house, slightly nervous. There was a car in the driveway, so someone was home. Dean wasn’t sure if he was glad about that or not.
, Sam thought sluggishly, though he couldn’t muster up the energy to actually do something about it.
Lately, he had found himself more and more reluctant to do much of anything. He drunk more, even smoked the occasional cigarette, something he hadn’t done in over ten years. Cas said he was depressed. Dean just said that he finally saw things as they were. A steaming pile of shit.
He did. They both did. Sorting through the archives was tedious work, stacking up files by cases, by year, by location, and yet Sam found himself almost enjoying it as he read through the seemingly never-ending well of knowledge, occasionally exchanging looks and smiles with Eileen, finding comfort in the calm of the basement, and some part of him was even a little disappointed when Bobby came down to tell them lunch was ready and they both went upstairs.
Both Sam and Dean swivelled around at the name. “Listen to me. He's got nothing to do with anything. You let him go,” he demanded. “I don’t know what you are talking about.” Dean frowned as he saw how his father’s face changed from anger to shock. “Caleb! Caleb!” he shouted and Dean shuddered. He had met Caleb only a couple of times but he was a good Hunter. Or had been, probably.
“I feel like I should know something. It’s right there but I can’t see it,” Cas said, “Dean, when we first met…I didn’t just go to Ohio for the Witches. There was something important, something I had to find. I couldn’t tell you how I knew that, I just did.”
“We’re just checking all angles,” Dean assured her smoothly, “Dotting all the is, crossing all the ts, you know how it is.”
“Meg?” Sam asked and Dean nodded, grateful that he had said Meg and not Jo because that would just sound worse. “What’d she say?”
“I didn’t meet dad until a few years ago,” the kid answered, “Mum never talked about him but I knew stuff.”
There was no place for argument in Cas’ voice, just deep understanding and love, and Dean deflated, relaxing into the touch as he nodded. Cas offered him a smile and gently led him back to the table where Adam was sitting with a shit-eating grin on his face.
“Child abuse, as in, Max? The son?” Sam asked. He sat on the edge of the bed, his eyes screwed shut.
“No!” Dean cut him off firmly, “No but. I don’t care what you think about it, or if you don’t get it, or whatever. Cas is off limits, capiche? He’s not hurting anyone.”
There was that expression on Dean’s face again, disbelieving and hurt. “You got out, man,” he pointed out, “You had a life. What? You think I’d just drag you away from that? ‘sides, you made it clear you wanted nothing to do with me.”
“Hey, don’t shoot the messenger.” Charlie raised her hands, taking a step back. “But you better drink that water. If you pass out on this bar, I’m not gonna carry you to bed.”
“Sure. See you tomorrow.” He watched as Dean walked away and disappeared into a room down the hall, leaving Sam alone with his thoughts.
The Bunker seemed a lot livelier than it had a few days ago, voices and laughter sounded through the hallways and music coming from the kitchen. Sam recognized Claire and the two kids from the nightshift together with a few others preparing food at the counter as he walked past. Benny, the bartender, was sitting at the Network Station, as were Jo and Charlie. Several people Sam thought he’d seen in the Roadhouse were lounging around the map table. In the library, Bobby was talking to Eileen. And there was Dean. And Cas. Sam stopped in his tracks, watching them. Both men were leaning over a table covered in books and documents, heads mere inches apart and exchanging soft hums and minute nods, their fingers gracing as they occasionally pointed at something, neither paying any attention to the world around them, and – and they were smiling. They were smiling like the other was the most beautiful thing in the universe, the only thing in the world that mattered, their eyes soft and bright, and for the first time since he’d gotten here, Sam thought he understood. There was something there between them that ran deep and strong, a bond spanning years of fighting and bleeding and nearly dying for each other. With each other.
Dean nodded and took another sip of his drink before Cas’ words actually sank in and he spattered, “What?” He gaped at Cas, who chuckled lightly.
“Alright,” Dean repeated, the faintest of smiles tugging on the corners of his lips, “I’ll go get packed. Cas, can you…” he trailed off, looking back at Cas and gesturing towards the computer.
“Welcome to the Bunker,” Bobby said, already descending the stairs to the room below, and Sam followed mutely.
“I’m sorry, I gotta go.” Dean knocked over the half empty bottle in his hurry to get up and leave but Cas’ voice held him back, “Dean Winchetser, don’t you dare go out that door now.” But Cas didn’t sound angry, just slightly annoyed. “I don’t care for your sexual exploits before we even met and if Ben is your son, which is clearly what you are thinking right now, then all I have to say is that you would be a great father.” Steps were coming closer and Dean could feel Cas’ breath in his neck. “Look at me, Dean.” Dean turned around and found himself staring into a pair of fond, deep blue eyes, and a pair of strong hands on his shoulders. “Calm down. You can talk to Lisa if you want but
“Alex used to do drugs, deal them too,” Matt began to explain, “A kid from his neighbourhood died, he stopped after that, went into rehab. Last night the kid that died showed up, he blamed Alex for his death. He was only 16.”
Sam was moving, he was aware of that much, but he had no control over his body as it slowly walked up the stairs and into the bedroom, as it was faced with an half-empty closet, as it randomly grabbed clothes and stuffed them into a duffel bag, as it went back down stairs and out of the house and into the car, as it started the engine and drove. He did not look back and he wondered if this was how his dad had felt all those years ago when he’d first loaded his two sons into his car to hit the road.
The Hunter ran his hand through his hair and rubbed the back of his neck, trying to come up with something, anything, that might help them. There was nothing.
They could see smoke from the distance. White, thick smoke. The road was empty so Cas drove faster, trying to get them closer to the Roadhouse except…the Roadhouse was gone. All that was left were black ruins and the smell of burned flesh.
“Hey, Sammy,” Dean said gently, crouching down in front of his brother who still hadn’t acknowledged him. Carefully, Dean laid a hand on Sam’s knee, squeezing lightly, “Sam.”
Dean sighed, rubbing his face before pinching the bridge of his nose. “His mom,” he began, “Lisa. We met on a case. We had a thing. Case was over, I left. We run into each other again on another case. She has a kid, and I – man, I was freaking out.” He let out a sardonic chuckle. “Anyway, she tells me it doesn’t matter unless I’m planning on sticking around, which I wasn’t. Then, couple years ago, Ben shows up again and I wasn’t gonna turn him away and Lisa was right. It doesn’t matter. He’s mine in all the ways that count.” It was a crude version of what Sam assumed to be a very long, very complicated story, but he also understood that Dean probably wasn’t in the mood of rehashing the details, especially not for him.
“Vampires,” Dean clarified, and Fiona flinched at the word, “We know you took those two kids from the hospital. We know you Turned them.”
“Okay,” he said into the phone, “Sammy! Sammy listen to me, I’m on my way, okay? Just…stay where you are.”
Dean ended up being the one with the task to find a gun similar to the Colt; he took the chance to check in with Cas and tell him the bad news.
“All limbs still attached?” Dean asked without even looking at them as he put together the burgers and got the fries out of the oven.
Very careful to not meet Bobby’s gaze, and pointedly ignoring Dean’s snide remark, Sam told Eileen, “I just had to get away for a bit.”
“Alright!” Dean conceded, just as they broke through the line trees into a clearing by a lake, and Dean killed the engine. “Alright,” he said again, running a hand over his face, into his hair, all the way to his neck. Sam waited patiently, allowing his brother to gather his thoughts. “Look,” Dean began, before aborting the sentence and letting out a deep breath. And Sam waited. Abruptly, Dean threw open the door of the car and stepped outside, gesturing at Sam to follow him, and together they sat down on the hood of the car, just like old times, back when they’d been just kids, waiting for their dad to finish up the latest job.
“I didn’t do anything,” Sam tried to argue, though he couldn’t deny the surge of happiness at hearing those words.
“You died, Dean. The Demon killed you and…and you were dead.” It almost physically hurt Dean to see so much pain in Cas’ eyes and he swallowed hard.
“Anyway, Ben, wanna take that ride later?” he turned to his maybe – maybe not son and his heart practically melted when he saw the happy glimmer in his eyes.
“Adam,” he started out carefully, “What you have to understand is that John…he wasn’t a good father. Teacher? Yeah. Best damn Hunter there is, but as a dad he…he wasn’t…Maybe he was different with you, maybe he wanted to make it better, but me ‘n’ Sam?” He shook his head, his eyes staring blindly into the distance. “He did the best he could to keep us save.” It suddenly hit him, that he had no idea what to say about John. He didn’t even know how he felt about him anymore.
“I’ll leave you alone for now,” Cas mumbled and left the room. It was just Sam, Dean and John now and finally, Dean allowed himself to relax. It was fine. Everything was fine.
Sam walked away, towards the car and Dean and Cas followed close by; there wasn’t anything for them to do at the moment.
Dean was absolutely and utterly speechless. Did Lisa really think that’s what he was there for? To continue something that had ended 11 years ago?
“Well, there was that one time with the cursed mirror where he fell in love with himself Narcissus style.”
Sam behind the wheel, Dean in the passenger seat, and Benny in the back, Sam started the engine and smiled.
Again, Sam could tell it was barely scraping the surface of what had actually happened, and no matter how much he wanted to know, he decided to let it go. At least for now.
“I don’t know, Dean, but it makes sense, doesn’t it? I mean he was there, the whole time. When his dad died, the apartment of the uncle. He’s angry because his family let him suffer and now he wants payback.”
Jo followed his line of sight and chuckled. “Believe me, it’s for the best,” she informed him, walking towards the door that Charlie had said led to the rooms, “Don’t burn the place down and don’t touch the drinks. I’ll know if you did.”
It wasn’t a pleasant drive from Iowa to Nebraska and when Dean finally stopped the car in front of the Roadhouse, he was glad to get away from Sam and his brooding.
“You seem upset,” Cas repeated, calmly and causally, as if it was a perfectly logical thing to say to someone you’d only just met.
“Well, that was stupid,” Dean told his little brother, “Everyone’s been looking for you for months.”
“Well, we do. We stick together. No one goes out alone. We do things differently around here. Some don’t agree with that, those people usually don’t stick around.”
“I saw you, Dean. We were here, in this building and there was this kid, a boy, he was bound to a chair, begging for his life but you just…” the end of the sentence hang in the air like a bad omen and Dean tried to wrap his head around all of this.
His brother glanced back once more, a grin on his face. “Pretty awesome, huh? It’s called the Bunker. It belonged to this group of super-secret dudes back in the day called the Men of Letters. They did all kinds of crazy stuff, mostly studying the Supernatural. You’ll love the library.”
“Okay.” Cas nodded and stopped right in front of Dean, crouching down, his hands, on Dean’s knees. “But then you have to promise me to stop what you’re doing right now. I know you’re hurting and that there is this huge, deep darkness trying to consume you and I know you’re scared...” his voice trailed off but he kept looking in Deans eyes and Dean looked right back. There was a pair of calloused, yet, soft hands grabbing his. “You have to promise that you won’t let go,” Cas finally continued, “Because you might be content with dying at this point, because you might not care, but I do, Dean. I need you.”
He wasn’t sure how long he’d been staring at the house, his mind filled with only white noise and a growing feeling of helplessness, when a car pulled up next to him.
“I don’t want her to go to New York,” Dean continued, “I mean, I get that she wants to move out. She’s 19. She wants to live her own life, but – I just wish she’d stay a little closer to home. Come over for dinner on weekends. She’s my kid. I don’t wanna lose her.”
Cas groaned, throwing his head back and banging against the wall. “Could you please take this serious?”
“No, you don’t,” Cas disagreed and stroked Dean’s hair before gently pulling away, “Your father is in the back seat. Help me?”
Jane had left, just like Chrissie and Zara and Dominique and Jess, and none of them were coming back.
Dean ended the call and while before everything had seemed too slow, now it was too fast, the room was spinning around him and Dean with it. He saw Cas’ shirt carelessly thrown on the floor, a single sock hanging from the lamp on the bedside table, a half drunken beer next to the book Cas had been reading the previous night.
They stayed like that for a long time, their hands entwined between them, silent, silent before they got out of the car and entered the motel to get a room for the night.
John stood in the middle of the motel room, staring at the walls which were covered in articles, pictures and maps.
“We don’t have much time, so I say we check every hospital for children that turn six months within the next couple o’ days,” John suggested.
It was getting dark when they arrived at Bobby’s salvage yard and they all sat down in the kitchen, a beer in one hand and a sandwich in the other. Dean caught a glimpse of the joined hands of Jo and Adam, before turning to Ellen who still hadn’t said one word.
They went inside and sat down in a small waiting area only to stand up seconds later when a big, elderly woman with dark skin stepped in front of them.
“Make that four, ya idjit,” Bobby came into the house, looking gruff as ever and if Dean hadn’t known him so well, he wouldn’t have noticed that the circles under his eyes were a little bit darker and his eyes a little bit sadder, “’nother kid lying out in the field. Just what have you boys gotten yourselves into again?”
“Look.” Dean sighed. “I don’t know what happened to you. Something obviously did. But I’m not gonna ask you to talk about it right now ‘cause it’s been 15 years and you’re your own person, but – you know where to find me. I wanna be part of your life, Sam. I wanna know who my brother is. Let me know when you’ve figured out what you want.” And then he was standing up and saying goodbye to Jody and Charlie and other people Sam didn’t know and he was walking away, leaving Sam behind at the bar, halfway through a bottle of whiskey.
“That’s why you came here? ‘Cause you saw me killing some kid?” Dean inquired and Sam nodded. “I thought you were dead.” Sam’s voice was nothing more than a hoarse whisper and Dean could see the pain in his eyes.
Without waiting for a response, Dean helped his brother stand up and lead him to the car where they both got into the back.
“If it wasn’t for him, I would have never gone to that bar that night…Dad was in pieces…fucked off to god knows where. I just wanted to get drunk and laid.”
Dean was watching him now, somewhat wary, suspicious even. “Dad was wrong, y’know,” he said, “Just because someone isn’t entirely human doesn’t mean their evil. It’s not all black and white, and – and we help people. We save lives.”
Sam rolled his eyes – why was everyone on his case for the drinking, anyway? – but did as he was told under Bobby’s watchful eyes until the older man seemed to be satisfied enough.
Dean took be book, barely daring to look at it but when he did he had to swallow hard. He’d been right, he knew the book.
Absently, he noticed that the room was empty except for Ellen, Bobby, Ash, Jo, and a boy whom Dean didn’t know and normally he would have been relieved to see that Jo was okay but right now there were other things on his mind.
Strange indeed. Sam had no idea where he stood with these people, where any of this was going, what it meant. The uncertainty put him on edge, making him wish for a drink but he thought asking maybe wouldn’t go over too well, considering what Dean had told him. Besides, the last thing he needed right now was another lecture on his drinking.
“We can’t take any risks,” big and bulky suddenly said and Dean would have very much liked to punch him. He didn’t.
“Pastor Jim Murphy from Blue Earth, Minnesota, was found dead in his church, throat slit. Traces of sulphur all over the place,” Ash explained unnecessarily gleeful.
“Hey Cas. Adam.” He grabbed himself a beer before joining them but all the way he could feel Cas’ gaze on him. “What is it?” he asked and sat down.
Silence again, as they drove on out of California, past a shabby hotel. Dean rubbed the back of his neck, “I dunno, man, it’s just…I’m worried, y’know? “
Cas and Dean watched from afar as Jessica was let down into her grave while her family and friends stood in front of it. Her family, and friends, and Sam.
“Dean?” Both Sam and Dean snapped around to look at Cas, standing in the door, clutching his mug, and looking deeply confused. “What happened?”
“Alright.” He straightened up and looked around. They all seemed exhausted, ready to fall asleep any second. “Alright,” he repeated, “I say we split up. One half makes it to the next city, while the other half stays –” his words were interrupted by a turmoil in the lab. It was chaos, the old lady that had been strangled by Andrea was holding a scalpel, blood dripping down from a cut in her hand, down on the little girl who was crying. Dean saw big and bulky, lying on the floor, dead or unconscious, he couldn’t tell, and still bound to the chair was Chris, thrashing around, yelling and baring his teeth like a wild animal.
“He’ll be okay, I promise. Kids are much stronger than we give ‘em credit for.” He was speaking from experience on that one.
“Alright that’s it,” Bobby had grumbled, “I don’t need a bunch of idjits moping around in my house. Get out, the lot of ya. There’s a case in Indiana, so go and do somethin’ useful.”
“You bastard.” By the sound of Sam’s voice, he too, had stood up. “You did this. Dean, I swear I never meant for this to happen, I –”
“He’s physically fine,” the woman went on, ignoring Dean, “But he just lost his wife and unborn child and I really recommend he sees a doctor. His burns are superficial and his lungs sound clear but still…” she trailed off, her eyes going back to the ruins of the house.
Sam couldn’t take his eyes off his brother as he followed him. There was something about him, something different. He was older, sure, but Sam realized, while Dean ordered a soda and asked after Jo with a genuine smile and a soft look in his eyes, he had also changed as a person, and Sam had no idea who this man was.
The first kiss was lazy and sloppy, while Cas practically climbed into Dean’s lap and slung his arms around the other man’s shoulders.
“What’s going on?” Adam asked from the back seat but neither Cas nor Dean bothered to answer, instead, Dean rolled down the window, “Yo, hey!” he called out and one of the men came closer, leaning down over the frame.
It was a long walk and all there was to see was flat land covered in grass but Dean wasn’t paying attention to his surroundings. His thoughts were with Sam. His little brother. The man he had raised and who had become a stranger somewhere along the way. It hurt. Up until now, Dean hadn’t even realized just how much because there had still been hope. Hope that Sam was alive and save. Now? Now Sam was out to do something stupid and probably get himself killed in the process and for what? To keep Dean safe from whatever threat was out there? To revenge their mum and Jess? To get his life back together? The changes had been obvious over the months leading up to dad’s death – to
“Looks like we’re in business,” Dean commented, leaning forward in his seat while the shadows behind the smudged windows started moving – one, two, three, four people walking around the hut, oblivious to their audience.
“Osiris. An Egyptian god and King of the Afterlife. Lore says that he can see directly into peoples’ hearts and that he judges them by the guilt they feel; which is why this is too dangerous for us.”
