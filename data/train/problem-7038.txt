"Yeah…"
"Yes, I got that part, but what does ice cream have to do with anything?"
"What?" he asked.
"I had no idea how to control my dimension jumps. I still don't. They just happen in any moment and can last an hour as well as a whole day. That's why I sometimes disappear without leaving any trace." Tony felt a big, heavy weight lifting from his stomach. The absurdity of the situation was temporarily canceled by the relief that Steve hadn't fallen in love with somebody else.
“These are some heavy topics.” Steve sat down on the top step, and pat the spot next to him. The gangly twelve-year-old plopped down next to him, never taking his eyes off of him. “There are,” Steve paused, not sure how he wanted to word things, “differences. Circumstances as well. The ones, the people, who kill just because they can, or for fun, there’s no measure of goodness in those people. I believe that there are a set of morals, and you must follow what you feel in your heart, but you also have to know the difference between right and wrong, and if the convictions you feel strongly about are enough of a reason to commit a horrible act like that.”
Tony cards his fingers through Steve's hair in bed that night, listening to his even breathing in the dark of their room. But he wasn't asleep. "You have talent," Tony said quietly. "Anyone else would think that you're asleep." Steve hummed, a low rumble spreading through his body.
"You with a little girl? We would all be doomed!" Tony straightened in the chair, watching the boys push Steve to the bathroom to get dressed. "Can you imagine, some blonde girl running around, the same spit-fire nature in her as Captain America? And I would give just about anything to see the first person who dares ask out Cap's precious little girl. Would polishing your shield be the equivalent of cleaning the rifle?"
He watched Tony's nose twitch a little, before nodding a couple times. "Bad time at work," he mumbled, and Steve nodded. They both heard a whistle being blown and Steve looked across the street at Peter's school, and saw why the man was sitting where he was. "It's the closest I can get to him right now." Steve's heart broke a little at the older man's tone. He wanted to be with his son, but he didn't want to subject him too all the backlash that Stark was facing right now with the press. "I call him of course, but...."
"J," Tony mumbled. "Turn down the AC, little chilly."
“We’re going to be watching that movie soon, aren’t we?” Tony and Peter nodded with big grins. “I would not wear the Hercules outfit though, if that’s what you’re angling towards for Halloween. I’m not that keen to show off so much leg.”
"You acted like you knew him, Steve," Tony threw in. "Which, I really don't want to think about any possible implications that you hired a hit on me. I haven't updated the Will to include you yet."
“You knew about this?” Barton growled out, looking at Steve.
"You know," Tony said casually, "you look a little hot in that suit!" Tony was already lifting the hoses, pressing down on the handles before Steve could get his shield back into his hand. He took a clean shot to the face, and one to the chest. Tony bust out laughing when Steve spit out a stream of water, then gasped when a jet of water hit his shoulder. Steve was grinning, shield in one hand, another hose in the other.
When Steve got back to his apartment he went to his study, the files on the desk. Peggy's file had been moved to the side. He had gone through her file just after Christmas, which really wasn't the best time of year, but he couldn't help himself. He had needed time to really digest what he had read, happy that she had had the chance to have a family, to live her life, but it was still hard. He hadn't been able to go through the other files yet, not sure if he could handle it. Today though, he was going to try again.
They still had Rachel in ICU, now just for monitoring before moving her to a regular floor, so Tony had to meet the others in the waiting room. Or the meeting room that was across the hallway, to give more privacy. William and Coulson were in there waiting for him.
He saw Tony turn his head to look at him, but Peter was the one who asked. "Who's coming over?" Peter then tried to sneak a couple of chocolate chips from the bag on the counter.
Tony shuffled out to the kitchen, hitting the button to start his coffee maker and pulled open the fridge. Sometimes he felt like the little old ladies who had a dozen Skitty’s, all his Eeveelutions around his feet, waiting for this own breakfast. He pulled out the tray of puffs for them, divvying them up, and finally turning back to his own caffeine savior to get him through the morning.
Steve made a noise in surprise, but put a hand on Tony's waist and tilted his head so they had a more comfortable angle, returning the kiss. Tony moaned softly before his teeth tugged at Steve's bottom lip. "Tony?" Steve breathed out, pulling away from the kiss, but not from Tony.
"Only about ten minutes," Steve told him, kissing his cheek. "She's very quiet," he said with a look down to Jamie. "Jarvis actually had to wake me up, because she just didn't cry."
“Did you know that for fun, he’ll take the elevator to the lobby, then run up the stairs, back to his floor?” Tony told them, and Steve’s cheeks turned a little red. “He lived on the Eighty-Third floor.
"Tony! Good, she got a hold of you!" Steve let out a breath of relief, but sounded uneasy.
“It’s date night material,” Steve responded with a shrug. “You kind of get sucked in, and then you have to keep watching.” Bucky grumbled, but Steve knew that he wasn’t going to say he was wrong.
"I've got scans running now, but it seems to me that this thing is growing." Tony was looking over some of the calculations that Jarvis was able to start pulling up. "It's not fast, but it's steadily increasing."
"It had to be done. Those Helicarriers you helped with, they were going to use them to kill so many people." Steve ran his hands through his hair, remembering seeing some of the names that were on the list, part of Zola's algorithm. "They were going to take out those that could have stopped them, that could have stopped Hydra. Bruce and Mary were on that list, even Wade's name, and you and Peter." He shook his head a little as he tried to calm his nerves and anger. "We had to stop that from happening, had to stop that from ever happening again."
“Our little girl is smart, she knows what I mean.” Tony smiled at Jamie. “Listen, Papa wants to take me out, and it’s kind of a special night. So, I think that our big girl can be courageous, for just one night.” Steve moved her around until he was able to lift her from his arms and move her over to Mary’s arms.
Tony put his hat and sunglasses on the little table in the entryway, and he and Peter both took off their shoes. Tony could wait a few hours before he needed anything from the Manor. "Alright, little man," Tony said as Peter put his backpack by the closet. "Why'd you want to stay here?" He picked up Peter, making him squeal, and dropped on the couch, bringing Peter into his lap.
"Guiding the future, Cap, that's what SI does." Tony neatly put Peter's clothes together, switching drawers now. "Then I had my own workshop, then a couple of floors for guests, and the like. Fifteen other floors would be available for rent for other business. Prime location space for just about anything, and with a spectacular energy incentive."
"I tailed her transport," Bucky said with a nod to the nursery door, before turning his eyes too look at the baby in Steve's arms. Steve followed his eyes, his arm bringing her a little closer to his chest. "Stark got her out of the lab."
"You're less likely to turn into a giant green rage monster," Tony said. "And I don't know how it would react with my arc reactor, so I can't take that chance." He grinned.
Bucky threw a towel to Steve over the bar of the shower curtain when the water shut off. “Don’t want to make Tony jealous?” Steve asked with a bit of a laugh in his voice when the towel came sailing over.
Tony snorted, and smiled a little. "Thank you, that all I wanted to hear." Rhodey held out his hand and Tony took it, shaking it, metal hands clanking. "They're coming in hot, any second. What the play?"
"If it weren't for Tony, I'm sure I wouldn't be doing this," Steve started to talk as he grabbed the socks and shoes. "The talking out loud," he clarified, mostly for himself. "Not the getting you dressed, or, taking you in. That's a bad phrase, 'taking you in.' Makes it sound like I'm doing you a favor." Steve gently pried the dress from her hands, and she made a grunt of protest, but nothing else. "I'm still technically young, you know, still in my Twenties, and it's kind of weird to think about. That's something I'll explain when you're older." She let out a little giggle when Steve pulled on her hands to get her into a standing position, pulling the dress down with one hand while the other was on her back.
"Why haven't they called about Granma yet?" Peter asked quietly.
Steve gently crawled into the bed next to Tony, but the motion woke the genius anyway. He looked around, eyes moving quickly as they scanned, before Tony caught sight of him. He visibly relaxed and offered an almost shy smile. "Hey, handsome," he said with a sleep laced voice.
"I was checking on the other arrangements, before I had to step in to get these three delinquents dressed," Tony defended. "I was actually on track, for once! All of the food is on schedule, and the outside seating is almost all set as well. Your officiant has her own room and getting ready herself. The guests are allowed to roam the vineyard, but the gate to the ceremony area hasn't been opened yet." Tony stretched out his arm to pull his suit jacket over his watch to glance at the time. "We still have seven minutes until those gates open." Rachel was staring at him, and Mary was smiling. "What? I usually meet all my business deadlines, and I was a fairly competent CEO of a multi-billion dollar company for several years."
"The smile on your face says otherwise."
"You didn't ask." Mary didn't sound apologetic at all, this offended Tony's ego. "Steve is perfectly happy to babysit, he doesn't mind."
"'Kay," he said as he plopped down on the ground, his notebook open on the coffee table.
"The Avengers?" Peter asked with a smile. He found the prospect of living with superheroes exciting, since his Daddy was a superhero.
Rhodey had thought that he could leave the simple snack task to Tony, the brunette diving in after he easily decimated three pieces of pizza. But after an hour and a half, and Jarvis announced that Peter was showing signs of starting to wake up, he looked over and saw that Tony's hands were coated in peanut butter, a few raisins stuck to his fingers. There were about 6 completed pieces of celery snacks, though.
Loki ran a hand over his face, face wrinkling a little in displeasure. “I’m afraid it’s not that simple. It’s not something I could do if I wanted too.”
“You sure, Mr Tony?” Wade asked him, frowning a little. “You’re hurt.”
There was a pause, as if the AI was considering on whether or not to tell the Captain. "Sir suffered from palladium poisoning from the previous reactor," Jarvis said finally. "He needed to create a new one, and Dr Banner had been helping him. Had he not finished it aboard the Hellicarrier, I am afraid that Sir would not have survived long enough to stop the missile that threatened the island of Manhattan."
“I can feel your emotions,” Tony slurred out sleepily. Steve lifted his eyes to see Tony looking at him with a lazy smile. “You’re ridiculously happy right now.”
"Tony." Steve's voice sounded vaguely distressed.
When he looked over at the couch, he saw tails wagging, ears perked, and the girls seemed to be smirking. “Oh, stop it.” He grumbled a little. He oophed when Arc’s tail thwapped against his back. He followed Steve into the kitchen, and watched him make his way around to all the ingredients that he needed. Tony caught the sight of some fresh puffs in the fridge, too. “I hope the girls weren’t too much trouble while I was gone.”
“It’ll always matter, Tony,” Mary told him. “You shouldn’t have to suffer-“
“What we thought were just nightmares, or night terrors, started getting worse. He said that he still heard things, and felt things.” Steve took a little breath. “This thing is still inside of his head, and it’s been using him for some reason. I felt it,” Steve said a little more quietly. “I don’t know what happened, but we had a shared dream. Not the point, but it is what sent him to Strange. I’m not exactly sure what happened there, but….” Steve sighed and opened the door to the bedroom, Mary following behind him.
"Trust me, I know." Steve was looking out towards the windows. "He'll talk to me when there's a mission to report on, but I can't get anything else out of him. I know Bucky's still in there-"
"Tony," Steve looked at Tony. "If you-" They both turned, startled when there was a hard smack, and a startled shout. Rachel was huffing, shaking out her hand, and George was holding his cheek. "Mrs Fitzpatrick!"
"And there's something normal about my son?" Julie grinned as she said it.
Steve looked down as Vee licked his hand, looking at him with her big brown eyes. His hand turned to scratch under her chin and he let out a soft sigh. “I may have put my foot in my mouth.” He didn’t see it, but he felt the look that Peggy was giving him. “Again.”
"Tony," Bruce said, still in his seat, but looking faintly amused. "You aren't thinking about taking him out to this song, are you?"
“You mean you’ll steal some of my pancakes,” Steve smirked at him.
"Fine, you're a den mother, happy? That makes you a wolf." Tony dropped down onto the couch, curling up against the arm.
"What is it that you have discovered?" Bruce asked, ignoring Tony's question. "What possible thing would be important enough to try and talk yourself out pursuing anything with Steve?" Tony looked over at the older man. "Please, I've known you for like, fifteen years now, Tony. I knew you before you hired Pepper. You're both attracted to each other, and only you could possibly find a reason to not pursue a relationship with him. I know this, because I did in fact talk with him yesterday, and I know he's not the one about to say no."
"Do you think that the assassin is working with the scientists?" Tony asked, taking his phone back. "Or is it just another threat on a never-ending list of enemies?"
“Did things come back?” Steve asked, stepping closer to her. He wasn’t about to lose Tony, especially not to a portal, not to one of Tony’s nightmares. He’d jump off the balcony and dive through the portal himself, if it had still been there.
Tony lifted his head a little and saw that Loki was looking at him, the back of his head still facing the others. Hazel eyes ticked over to see where Barton and Romanoff were standing, keeping their distance from Bucky, and then something clicked in his mind. Loki smirked a little, as if reading his mind.
Tony took the most direct route to what he knew would be a safe space. He didn’t need to put in the code, Jarvis was already opening the hidden door in the back of the workshop. Any other day, Tony would say that he had built a nest, but on days like this, it was the only thing that he could trust. The room was dark and cool, lots of pillows and blankets around, the floor padded with lots of cushioning, and custom made bean bag chairs. He went for the furthest corner of the room, dropping into the oversized cushion that would practically swallow him. The fabric had been painstakingly fabricated so that it wouldn’t irritate his already overstimulated sense of touch. The room was quiet, with insulation and extra noise canceling foam on the walls, and the temperature was constantly regulated.
“By yourself?” Tony raised an eyebrow. “The press is a monster, Steve, you’ve seen that with me.”
"Peter." Steve moved, tilted Peter's head up a little by his chin. "I'm going to help your Daddy, but I need to keep you safe as well." Steve moved his arm, holding the shield, to show it to Peter, watching the little boy take a second to process what he was looking at, then his eyes widened.
"We'll get that information to SHIELD, maybe they have something in their databases about an enhanced assassin." Steve sighed after a second before practically slumping down in a chair. "Yeah, you're not getting that knife back, by the way," he told the woman next to him.
“Them!” He motioned upwards with his hands. “The ones that launched an attack on us nearly two years ago.” He slumped against the couch suddenly. “It’ll be two years, since that first attack. The Battle of New York, as they call it. I hate that name,” he sighed.
"There's a car going ape-shit out here," Meg said as she hit the parking lot.
Of course he wasn't expecting the man in the middle of the track when he came around the bend. Was that electri- And then he was in the air, with the car. He tumbled int he air, unable to get out of the vehicle, his brain working in slow motion, along with the rest of time. Tony's body jerked as he landed, letting out a shout when his head, thankfully protected by the helmet, scraped against the ground.
“It was a couple weeks ago.” Tony sat back, one arm on the back of the couch. “If they don’t need all of the Avengers then one of us will usually stay back with the kids. They were going for something a little more stealthy, I think, so Cap went.”
"I do!" Steve said with a little more enthusiasm then he should have. He had just watched The Wizard of Oz with Peter last week. "I understood that reference."
"And you know that if you ever need help with it that you can come to us, right?" Tony asked, and Peter had to nod. "Well, if you don't need help with your homework, then that means that I've got time that was Peter Time, and it's an empty slot now. So while you're busy doing homework, I'll go check on Jamie to make sure that she isn't doing something silly, like crawling into the dishwasher, or eating all of the soap." He could see Peter trying not to smile at the thought. "What I'm trying to say is that, yeah, Jamie needs a bit more attention than you do, but she's tiny still. You are growing up to be an awesome young man, so you don't need as much attention. But that doesn't mean that I'm not always going to be there. I'm still going to try and help you with your homework, even if you don't want it."
"He makes you think," Mary said with a smirk. "About more than yourself, or heaven forbid, even Peter."
“Forget about me corrupting her,” Tony said, glancing at Steve. “These two are going to do it all on their own.” Steve snorted and they both smiled. Steve started to move his legs, making Wade bounce. He yelped then laughed as he tried to wrap his arms around Steve’s legs to make him stop.
"How'd that work?" Tony couldn't help but ask.
“Nah,” Sam shook his head. “Just a guy with a cool pair of wings.”
“Yeah, on the last day. It’s been a while since we’ve been there, and Steve hasn’t seen it. I figure Peter can give him the tour, and we can get a beach day in without being surrounded by several thousand people.”
“Alright, I won’t tell you that.” Tony groaned and dropped his head back against the headboard of the bed. “You were both out for blood in there.”
“Are those her first words?” Wade asked carefully, sneaking his own tuft over to Jamie. Her little hands latched onto his fingers as tried to shove the cotton candy into her mouth.
he gave him.
Steve seemed as shocked as Tony had been, but he reacted way quicker, releasing his choking hold on the other man's throat, carelessly letting him fall to the ground in a pool of limbs. He stared at the fallen man, completely unconcerned, before turning back to Tony and eagerly searching his eyes again.
So. Smoking hot reunion sex next? I vote for yes 😏
And, wow, okay, when had Steve become so understanding and practical?
Getting to hear that sound again was like diving headfirst into cold, soothing water after spending an entire day under the punishing summer sun, or taking the first sip of hot coffee on a cold morning, after a long, sleepless night. It was all of that and more, and Tony never wanted to forget that sound again.
P.S: comments make me write faster ;)
I don't know when what was supposed to be an angsty one-shot turned into a multiple chapter thingy with plot, but here we are.
. It shook Tony to his core.
had he missed that smile.
"If that's okay with you." Steve added quickly, for good measure.
His eyes held a different kind of emotion now. It was something wild, raw,
He walked towards his guest and helped him stand up, apologizing in account of his psycho
"I see." There was no sympathy or regret in those steely blue eyes, and it made Tony roll his. Steve had always been a possessive asshole, so at least
In the end, he did neither, he just stared like an idiot, but Steve, perceptive as always, seemed to understand anyways.
"Thanks." Steve smiled at him, blowing on his tea before taking a careful sip. His lips looked chapped and dry, now that Tony noticed.
. He blinked, dizzy from the sudden, almost foreign sensation after so long without feeling it.
“Hey babe, you’re home!”
Clint scrolled through some of the feed, seeing all the red hearts fly by.
“Let’s just focus on one of us at a time, huh?”
The pair lapsed into silence, both thinking about how they were too scared to put themselves out there.
“Thanks, real helpful, Barton.”
“Yeah.” Steve smiled, leaning down to capture Tony’s mouth with his own, kissing him passionately. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve, pulling him close and matching his intensity, deepening the kiss. When the finally broke away for air, Steve rested his forehead against Tony’s and chuckled softly.
Tony gave him a warm smile, feeling like Steve really understood him.
“So, not to be nosy, but you do still have to eat right?”
“Well, how have you told people in the past?”
“No, yeah, it definitely is. The thing is, I was thinking about telling him that I, you know, love him” Tony said, finishing in a rush.
“Steve, I— I love you.” He stared at the floor and Steve could feel him tensing up, no doubt waiting for the rejection he always expected.
“Yeah, yeah. C’mon Cap, why don’t we go upstairs and I’ll show you just how much.”
“Oh yeah?” Clint said, leaning over to take a look.
“What I meant was, seeing as you probably haven’t eaten in…however long, how ‘bout I take you out for some real food? You can tell me about what other crazy stuff you have around here.”
“All that matters is that you love me.”
“If you keep up this attitude, I’m not going to show you what else I bought” Steve warned, shaking a finger in Tony’s direction.
“Fine” Tony said, staring down at the wiggly little ball of fur. “We can keep her. For now.”
“I suppose rules are rules” Tony said, pulling him towards the bedroom. “So I guess I need to kiss you under the mistletoe.”
“Consider them signed off on. I believe you, and trust me, no one’s going to want to go through all that mess to challenge the claims.”
Steve was speechless, still staring into space as if J.A.R.V.I.S. would suddenly appear in a physical form.
Tony wasn’t happy, but he could see the excitement Steve was trying to downplay and knew that he’d wanted a dog for a while. Their lifestyle wasn’t ideal for a pet, which he always reminded Steve of, but if it made him happy, they could at least give it a try.
“Why am I in this rat-trap apartment?”
“Really?” Natasha said, a hint of surprise crossing her features. “Well, good for you.”
“Hang on” Tony grunted.
“Does ‘plenty of people’ include you?” Steve asked, looking at Tony and knowing the answer.
Steve rolled his eyes. “I bet it will.”
Steve shook his head little, clearing it. “No, I’m good” he said, feeling a little embarrassed. “It’s just a lot to take in, but it’s incredible. You have all this awesome stuff, why…” he trailed off, not wanting to say something insulting.
“Listen up, Barton” Tony started to say, but before he could continue his threat, the front door opened and Natasha appeared in front of them.
Steve just stared open-mouthed, at a loss for words.
“Hey” Tony called, approaching Steve and the group of officers around him. “Can we – whoa.” He cut short, seeing a little girl with her arms wrapped around Steve’s neck, her head resting on his shoulder.
“So was I the last to know?”
“Ok, I’ll go see what’s keeping him. I think you guys are probably good to go.”
“Steve” Tony said, a hint of desperation in his voice, “I don’t know anything about babies…or kids. How old is it anyway?”
Steve tore his eyes away from the incredible inventions and looked over to Tony. “Ok, well” he said with a sigh, “we still have to go over the application for reimbursement item by item.”
“Still clueless, huh?”
“You make a great dad” he whispered.
Grabbing two of the beers, Steve opened them before walking back over and handing one to Tony, who took a long drink. “Thanks.”
“Sorry, you know I can’t control it. My attitude has a life of its own” Tony joked, making Steve smile. “But I still don’t think whatever it is will get me onboard this Christmas train. The Polar Express, if you will.”
Looking up, he caught the dumbfounded look on Steve’s face before he could hide it. “Sorry, I get excited about this stuff. I know no one else really cares.” His face fell a little, the enthusiasm gone.
“Do they? I must have missed that memo” Tony said sarcastically, earning him a look from Steve.
“Yeah well, we’ll see” Tony said, the idea not seeming as awful as it had at the beginning of the day. “Maybe someday.”
“Oh Tony, that’s wonderful!” Bruce beamed, making Tony roll his eyes in response.
Steve looked at him blankly.
Clint just raised an eyebrow in response. “Uh huh, and you could tell Stark that you’re mooning over his Instagram, but here we are.”
“I’m sure” Steve laughed.
“How do I even do that? What if he doesn’t feel the same way? Maybe it’s too soon. I should wait for him to say it first. I don’t want to freak him out” Tony rambled, chewing his lip nervously.
“Maybe not, but if that’s the case, I’m not in any position to give advice” Bruce shrugged. “At least you’re in a relationship.
“Thank god I’m not” Bruce laughed. “And I’m not trying to ‘fix’ anything, I just thought that with the way you’ve nearly worn a hole in the floor, maybe there was something on your mind.”
“Where’s she going to sleep? Doesn’t she need a crib or something?”
“Don’t worry about it. Dum-E, you’re on clean-up” he called out. Steve looked around, confused. Suddenly the robot-looking thing he had spotted earlier whirred to life, rolling over to where they stood. Steve stepped back, looking at it warily.
“Anyway” Tony continued, waving off Steve’s defense of Clint, “I see you found me. I appreciate all the love.” He laughed, slapping Steve on the back. “Better watch out, some people might read into that, if you know what I mean.”
“Too bad, that would be…well, badass” Steve said with a laugh.
“I apologize in advance” Tony said, leading him over to the largest work area, situated right in the middle of what should have been the living room. “I’ve always got a lot going on.”
The pair nodded at him, glad to be able to head back and wash off the sweat and grime they were caked in.
“I guess so. Impressive.”
Bruce raised his eyebrows in surprise. “Is there something wrong with you and Steve? I thought things were going well?”
“Oh my god” Steve groaned, his head dropping back to rest against the couch. “So embarrassing.”
“It’s just, I was at the park and there was this…puppy and –”
“Why don’t we give you guys some privacy” Bruce offered, standing up and grabbing Clint by the arm.
Tony opened and closed his mouth, finding himself unusually speechless. It was such a terrible idea, he didn’t couldn’t even begin listing all the ways.
“Wow, just the greeting I was hoping for. Really warms my heart. I’ve missed you too” Natasha shot back sarcastically. “I could point out that you have your own floor you could go to.”
“I’ve heard about Instagram so much, I figured I’d see what the big deal was.”
“Hey” he called out tentatively, not wanting to startle the clearly distracted Tony. He failed however, and had to bite back a laugh when Tony nearly jumped out of his skin. It was funny, but Bruce knew he wasn’t the jumpy type; something was definitely up with him.
Tony continued eyeing Steve suspiciously as he kicked off his shoes and walked further into the room.
Bruce pushed open the door, entering the common area of Stark Tower, looking forward to a cup of tea and some quiet after his time out on the noisy streets of New York. Instead of quiet, he came upon Tony, pacing back and forth in front of the kitchen island, mumbling to himself with occasional groans and wild hand gestures. He was surprised to see Tony out of his workshop, since he had been holed up in it for the last number of days.
“What?”
“Ok, Tony” Steve said, lifting up his briefcase. He looked for somewhere to set it down so he could pull out all the paperwork, but every flat surface seemed to be covered. Stacks of papers, blueprints, tools and bits of machinery…he wasn’t sure what most of the stuff was.
As he picked her up out of the tub, Tony held open a towel, wrapping her in a securely. She yawned, rubbing her eyes with her tiny little fists and Tony realized that it was getting pretty late. It was probably close to her bedtime and he had no idea where she was going to sleep.
“Yeah, I was going to, but then I saw Stark come in and I couldn’t resist. Had to see how that was gonna play out. Not great, I have to say.” He shrugged. “Plus, anything to put off the paperwork for another few minutes.
“So, I guess we’ve hit most of the high points…”
“Yeah, you could say that” Tony said with a wry smile and roll of his eyes. He stepped back, letting Steve enter the apartment to take a look around. He could see the water stains down the walls, buckets still collecting a random drip here and there, and towels soaking up the leftover water from under couches and tables.
“What if it belongs to someone and they’re looking for it?”
“What?”
“Definitely just you” Tony laughed. “So how’s it going so far?”
“I figured I’d put up some signs and keep an eye out. I guess JARVIS can scan anything online about a missing dog…” Steve said, unenthusiastically. He picked the puppy up, lifting it so they were face to face and laughing as it licked his nose.
, Steve promised himself,
“Ok, it’s not great” Clint laughed. “But maybe he won’t even notice. God know what kind of things he has happening on that phone of his, I’m sure Instagram isn’t at the top of his priorities. How many pictures did you like?”
“Super!” Tony cried out, not turning to look. “Who now? Coulson? Welcome to my personal hell, come on down for a front row seat to the Tony Loves Steve show.”
Tony started to speak, wanting to reassure Bruce that he’d find the perfect person for him eventually, but Bruce stopped him before he could begin.
“I guess” Steve said, looking around the apartment, “maybe it would be easiest if you took me around and showed me everything that you sent in a claim for.” Everywhere he looked there seemed to be a workbench, end table, or desk set up, covered in papers and metal bits. There appeared to be a robot of some sort in one corner, a chemistry set in another, and multiple computer screens set up just off the kitchen.
“Steve?”
Just then, the door opened and Steve looked up, horrified to see Tony walking in. One look at the grin on his face and Steve knew that Clint had been wrong. So very wrong. Tony definitely knew and he thought it was hilarious.
“Yep, just thinking about some specs for the armor upgrade that I’ve been working on. Got me stumped…”
“Of course. Who doesn’t like Christmas?”
“Oh, hey” Tony answered, attempting to regain his composure. He sat down on one of the stools behind him, trying to look casual even though Bruce would never buy it.
“Ok” Clint said, getting up. “I’ll leave you to it. I’ve gotta go finish up some paperwork that may be just a little late.”
Steve just sighed, walking over and plopping the girl in Tony’s arms. He stood stiffly, unsure of what to do. Pushing them gently towards the table, Steve made sure Tony sat her safely on a chair and placed the food and a spoon on the table in front of them.
“Hang on!”
“Where’s Cap?”
“So” he started, fidgeting uncomfortably, “I suppose I could maybe use some advice.”
“Steve Rogers, from Hartford Insurance Group, nice to meet you” Steve said, shaking Tony’s hand firmly. “So, I believe you’ve experienced some water damage?”
“So where is it?”
Slowly, Tony raised his eyes, peering up at Steve from under his lashes. “Yeah?”
He started untangling the mass and pointing to various bits. “Right now, there's two settings: hours in 1 hour increments to 12, and minutes in 5 minute increments to 60. Each successful setting has a color confirmation, hour is red and minute is green. The alarm starts about 30 minutes before and goes from soft orange, to yellow, to bright white if you don't reset it in time.”
“Steve, probably.”
Steve shook his head, a bemused smile on his face. “It’s about spending time with people you love, surprising them with thoughtful gifts, enjoying the food, lights, music…you’ll see.”
“Uh, Cap, you’ve got a little…something on you” he said, gesturing to the kid.
Tony headed off to their room to get dressed, dragging his feet a bit, hoping Steve would get some food in her before he got back. Alas, when he reappeared in the kitchen, the food was still packaged and lying on the counter. He stood back watching Steve spin the little girl around, earning himself a small smile. As much as he disliked kids, it did warm his heart to see Steve so good with them.
Red and green garland looped along the doorframes and stockings were hung across the mantel above the fireplace, which was lit with a roaring fire. A Nativity scene was carefully laid out on a side table next to the couch and, as Tony sniffed the air, he could swear he smelled cookies baking.
century and enjoying all the wonders of social media.”
“Well, enjoy. Just don’t go liking all of his pictures or anything” he joked, gesturing at the phone.
Steve just shrugged his shoulders. “I thought I’d see what all the hype was about. I still think it’s strange to post everything about your life online for millions of people to see. But maybe that’s just me.”
“I used to watch some kids in the neighborhood growing up. And who doesn’t love kids?” he said, patting the girl on the head with a bright smile. “They’re so cute.”
“God damn Barton” he grumbled under his breath.
“So what are we supposed to call you?” he mused, watching her reach out hesitantly for a few pieces of the cereal, grabbing them with her chubby fingers. “You aren’t going to tell us your name, huh?”
“Hush. I’ve already got everyone’s gifts planned and we can go shopping this weekend” he said, excitedly. “We can have people over for a Christmas party, maybe decorate cookies together.”
“Why would we?”
“I’m sorry –“
“You were a kid at one point, weren’t you?”
“Not at all. You came up with these crazy wonderful ideas and then actually make them work! Sure, making money off them would probably be great, but they’re yours, you shouldn’t have to just give them up to make a living.
“Look closer.”
“Yep” Steve said, leaning in, kissing Tony slowly, tasting the coffee he had just drank. Tony moaned quietly, wrapping an arm around Steve, pulling him closer. His hand moved lower, resting on Steve’s ass, which he gave a squeeze.
Clint tried not to laugh at the panic on Steve’s face. He dropped back down on the couch, trying to be reassuring. “I mean, it’s not bad…”
He headed for the kitchen, stopping as he saw Steve bent over in front of the oven pulling out a cookie sheet.
Tony and Bruce whirled around to see Clint leaning against the doorway behind them.
“Alright, well” Steve began, pulling out Tony’s file, “The company has gone over your claims, but due to…well, the fact that no one knows what this stuff is…they sent me out to clear things up a little.”
“A lot” Steve said, wincing. “I didn’t know it’d tell him every time.”
“You can try to unlike some of them? Maybe then he won’t know. Or it could be too late, I really don’t know. Sorry man, good luck.”
“That’s amazing” Steve said admiringly, walking in a circle around Dum-E, watching it do its work.
Steve turned back to the officers who discussed it among themselves.
“In our room. I got a little pen set up with newspapers and everything, so she won’t make a mess and we can decide what to do with her…if you don’t want her to stay.”
“That’s J.A.R.V.I.S.” he said, “J.A.R.V.I.S., meet Steve Rogers.”
The door swung open and Steve blinked in surprise. He’d gone over the occupant’s list of damaged items and from the technological nonsense he’d read, he had expected some sort of mad scientist or nutty professor type. Instead it was a young guy, maybe a few years older than him. His dark hair was shaggy, hanging into his eyes, but his goatee was neatly kept. He wore jeans and a stained white tank, and appeared to have goggle imprints around his eyes. Handsome, with just a touch of the mad scientist.
“You’ll be ok” Steve said, seeing the look on his face. “It’s not hard. We just feed her, play with her, make sure she doesn’t get hurt. Simple enough.”
“Ok, try me.”
“Oh shit.”
“Yeah. Still means we have to change it though.”
“Ok, well, I may have done something today” Steve said, speaking slowly, trying to delay the inevitable. “Nothing bad, really.”
“Hey” he said, reaching out his hand. “Tony Stark, thanks for coming.”
Steve nodded.
Bruce allowed himself an amused smile before turning back around straight-faced. For someone who loved to run his mouth as much as he did, Tony sure could avoid anything of substance like the plague.
“It’s about…relationship stuff.”
Tony locked eyes with Steve, seeing how pleased he was having the puppy wriggling in his arms and how much he wanted Tony to feel the same. “Oh alright, let me see it” he said, holding out his hands. He took the puppy gently from Steve, holding it close to his body so she wouldn’t squirm right out of his arms. She yapped happily at him, trying to reach his face to lick his cheek.
“No, it’s not” Steve said, seeing the surprise on Tony’s face.
“Everything ok?” Bruce asked lightly, knowing how Tony hated talking about anything remotely meaningful.
“It’s just one of those things. It’s fine to like his pictures, of course. But if you just go through and like everything, or a picture from like, 4 years ago –“
“Not that kind of stuff. What do kids play with?”
“Just kidding, Cap, don’t take everything so seriously” Tony said, giving him a friendly shove. Throwing up a mock-salute, he moved away, heading for Coulson. “You should post something yourself” he said over his shoulder as he left.
Gesturing to a tangle of wires and lights jumbled together, he explained “This is a prototype for a sunrise alarm clock. I’m using LEDs and added a button; I'm going for minimal controls so the input isn't too far from complete.”
“No worries. I could have sold off a lot of this stuff, but everyone wants the intellectual rights and everything that goes along with that. And I don’t want to give up control of them. They’re like my babies, I guess.”
Clint just shook his head before patting Steve on the knee supportively and getting up. “One day.”
Taking Steve’s hand, Tony pulled him to the door and flung it open, impatient to get to his bedroom. A piece of paper fluttered down from where it had been hastily taped. Steve grabbed it, reading the note over before handing it to Tony with a smirk.
“Of course, sir” came of voice from out of nowhere, making Steve jump. He whirled around, looking for the source, but saw nothing. He looked over at Tony, wide-eyed.
“No, don’t worry, we don’t have any social engagements coming up. You have turned down the last however many though, so we really should go to the next one. We can talk about that later though. You want something to drink? Or are you hungry? I’ve got dinner in the oven, but we’ve still got a while before its ready.”
“Is that why, uh…” Steve asked, pointing to a small, blackened hole in the wall next to the window.
“Why?” Tony said, spinning around to look at Steve, surprised by the panic in his voice. “What? Am I going to find someone hiding in the closet?” He didn’t actually believe that, but did enjoy the outraged face Steve made.
“Oh great, you’re already showered. After you get dressed, could you watch her while I hop in real quick?” Steve asked, unpacking kid stuff all over the kitchen island.
“I don’t know, you have all kinds of stuff.”
“I didn’t even say anything!”
“My relationship is not a spectator sport, Barton, and if it was, you’d still be the last person invited.”
“Right?!”
Steve sagged back against the couch miserably, closing his eyes as the conversation began replaying itself in his head, like it always did after his interactions with Tony.
“See? I knew you’d like it.”
His stomach fluttered nervously at the small smile that played at the corner of Tony’s lips.
Tony spun around on his stool and saw Steve standing just inside the door, looking at him intently.
“Yeah well, maybe I’m trying to live vicariously through you. I’m not taking my own advice, obviously.”
“Well, the police here said that they would have to call social services, who would then find a foster family to watch over her until her guardian could be located.”
“But?”
“Perfect, let’s go then” Tony said with a nod. “Hand her over.”
With a huff, he sat up, swinging his legs out of bed. Blearily wiping the sleep from his eyes, Tony got up and slowly stumbled down the hallway. Stepping into the living room, his senses were assaulted from all sides as he realized that his previously pristine room now looked like a department store Christmas display.
"Can't break tradition, little man," Tony said softly to him, sitting up with him in his lap. He rubbed his back, and let one hand come up to cup Peter's cheek. He gave Peter a smile, touching their noses together, and he got a shy, sad, little smile in return. "There's my Petey. Go on, get some pancakes. And when you're done, I'll have a surprise for you, okay?" Peter was pretty good about noticing when Tony had a new arc reactor, and he was very interested to see what Peter said this one felt like.
"Nope," she popped the P. "Unless you count the few times that I've sand a solo in High School. And I don't, because I had to stare at the Exit signs above the heads and still try to look natural while singing. That shit is nerve wracking!"
"Hair swept up, you haven't touched your cake-"
"No," he mumbled into Tony's shirt. "I can do my homework myself."
He went to turn on his side and a sharp pain in his shoulder had him crying out. Hands were suddenly there to shift him back onto his bed, and Tony opened his eyes. Steve and Bruce were there, Steve looking worried, both looking, sad? Tony sucked in a breath as everything that happened outside suddenly rushed back to his memories.
"Yup," he nodded, little hands spinning her hospital bracelet around her wrist. "I'm eating all my food, too. Mom! I get to stay in the same house as Captain America!" He exclaimed, turning excited brown eyes up to her. "Like, the Real Captain America!"
Steve frowned, feeling that he was doing too much of that in this room, and moved out Natasha's touch. "I've gotta go talk to him."
“You can’t just walk in here with three people that the Avengers are looking for,” Steve said to Strange, but didn’t take his eyes off of the twins, or Loki. “I can’t be certain if Jarvis has alerted the others yet, or if he will soon, but I’m not going to call him off.”
"I'm two!" Peter went to jump off the bed and Tony wrapped his arms around Peter's waist and sat up. He let the toddler down on his feet and watched him scramble out of the bedroom, to no doubt wake up his mom. Now that Peter was gone from the room, Tony took a moment to run his hands through his hair, and let out a yawn, the night of no sleeping catching up to him. He wanted to watch Peter sleep, but he also knew that he would have nightmares, and he couldn't subject the little boy to that.
"Peter wanted to get a bunch of stuff for you," William said with a chuckle. He put a hand on Tony's shoulder, giving it a little squeeze. "Good to see you looking so well."
Steve glanced up, and saw the back of a man with brown hair, looking at the people behind him, ignoring the Senators who were trying to get his attention. The headline at the bottom of the screen said "Anthony Stark - Former CEO Stark Industries", and Steve could see the similarities already to Howard. That was Howards' son alright, even the cockiness that rolled off of him. Steve rolled his eyes a little, grabbed the remote and changed the channel before the man turned around. It was obvious that the man would make a circus of the hearing.
“That’s a load off of our shoulders, but be sure to come to us if you do end up reading something you’re not sure about. But, Tony has been seeing a therapist for, well, almost two years now.”
Peter pushed his lips a little, then moved to push Tony's shirt up, exposing the arc reactor. Tony took a slow breath, letting his son examine it, and touch it. It might always sound weird, but he's trusted Peter with the arc reactor since he was two.
"Then Saturday night we'd better have a fantastic goodbye," Tony mumbled with a smile, eyes slipping shut again.
"Your Daddy is downstairs, with Mr Steve." Jarvis only ever broke from his code of names with Peter, knowing it would make him more comfortable. Tony had added a couple lines of code to the AI to make sure that Peter always felt comfortable, safe, and would be taken care of. "If you will follow the light, I will take you to them." Something lit up just at Peter's bedroom door.
Steve frowned a little, sitting in a bit of suspense when Bruce got up to check on his tea, adding a bit of honey to it, and coming back to his seat with the cup cradled in his hands. "I think Howard had been giving up on finding you, it had been a long time, and there was Tony, trying to show off and get his father's attention. He was sure that the Board was going to deny his request to send another team out to search for you, and so he started to come up with a back up plan."
"Funnily enough, time is what I have the most of right now," Steve said. He glanced back at the little place, then back at the pink haired woman. He stuck his hand out to her, and she started to shake it before he even started talking. "My name's Steve."
“Oh, you bet your sweet perfect ass I am.”
Bucky reached into his pocket as Meg walked across the room to grab her tablet. He looked at the green wrapped chocolate mints. “What about the little one?” He turned his head over, taking note that Peter and Wade had noticed and were moving closer to him.
"That usually wouldn't be too bad," Steve continued like Tony hadn't tried to stop him. "Dreaming of a recent battle or mission is normal. But I'm throwing a punch, I'm turning to throw the shield, and when I turn around I'm on a train." He let out a breath and looked up, unintentionally meeting Tony's eyes, but found he couldn't look away. "I'm going for my shield, and it's Bucky who's holding it.... And then he's falling, again. I can't stop it, I can never stop it."
Steve watched Tony, then moved closer when he saw the reaction to whatever Jarvis had shown him. The headline at the bottom changed from the name of the man, George Hayes, to the segment name.
Tony was so lost in his thoughts, and the happiness that was coursing through his chest, that he missed the elevator arriving to his floor until- "Daddy!" Tony jumped when Peter came running into the living room. He took a deep breath so that he wasn't panting from the kiss, and looked over to see five people standing in the living room, looking at them. Steve still had one arm around Tony's neck, and Tony still had his arm around Steve's waist, and Steve's face was turning red.
Steve sat down on the floor after depositing the dishes from snack time in the kitchen, and look at Jamie. "How did you get your socks off so fast?" She was sitting up with her legs extended, leaning forward so she could play with her toes. Her socks were nowhere to be seen. "I was gone for less than a minute. And where did they go?" Jamie just burred her lips a little and continued pulling at her toes with her fingers.
Steve was halfway out the room before Natasha put a hand on his arm. "You should have talked to me about this one beforehand," he told her, expression halfway to disappointed.
“Tony!” Steve shouted, trying to get to them. Loki pulled back, panting, eyes wide.
"You make it sound like someone would be rifling through your mind." Both men turned, jumping back, at the voice that sounded behind Tony. There was Loki, leaning against the wall, looking at his nails. "We both know that someone else has already done that."
"Have a good nap?" Tony asked, leaning back against the pillows, letting Peter rest on his chest, still looking kind of sleepy.
"You've been asleep, Captain," Mary started. "You've been asleep for nearly sixty-five years." Steve kept her gaze before looking up, out the windows of the lobby, now really taking in the differences of what he saw. She put out her hand, palm up, a gentle gesture, and he took her hand, letting her lead him to the doors. They stepped out and Steve blinked a bit at the sunlight, but at all the technology around him. "You gonna be okay?" Mary asked after a few minutes.
"I know, and I have to meet Thor sometime. It's not every day that you find out that there is an actual personification of the Gods of your religion." Tony raised both eyebrows at her. "Steve told me not to talk to you about religion. Unless it had something to do with Supernatural."
"Someone has to be bank-rolling them," Tony continued. "These guys seem disorganized, jumping the gun from animal DNA to human DNA before they even know it'll work. Something tells me that they're not working alone."
"I know that we're not about to jump on board and defend a beater," Tony looked over at the two. He found it a little weird that he might be defending the person who had tried to kill him a couple of times, but there were more important things, people, to worry about at the moment.
"That's the problem," Hill said. "We don't know, sir." Both Mary and Fury looked at her, eyes narrowing a little as getting an answer they didn't like. They effortlessly moved past all the people moving files and different prototypes out of the building and heading downstairs.
"I just had to reconnect the Tower to the servers," Tony told him. "He never technically left the building, the power was just turned off. I got lucky actually, the Tower didn't take too much damage compared to the rest of the city. Cap helped me get the windows replaced, and we're working on the damage to the lower floors, but all living areas have been cleared to live in. Makes it easier to work there if I'm already living there." Bruce just hummed, nodding.
"You said it was flimsy," Tony looked at her as he sat up in his chair, Bruce taking back the tablet. "But, it's enough that you want to take a shot at it?" Natasha nodded.
"Tony is a professional at conferences," Pepper stopped him. "Trust me when I say that, he can handle anything. Well, unless he has another superhero alter ego to announce." Tony snorted, smirking a little. "You'll want to keep you anonymity, Captain." She clicked her tongue a little and both men fell in line behind her like a couple of trained pups.
“If you can put up with my overworking, stubborn, and arrogant ass for this long, then who am I to stop you.” Steve smiled at Tony’s words, kissing his head.
“It’s your birthday, Tony,” Mary said first. “Peter, what do we get on birthdays?”
The door opened a little and Natasha's head peeked out, her red hair pulled back. She looked at Tony and Steve, then down at Peter and Wade. "There are three handsome men out here, and then there's Tony." Tony opened his mouth a little. They could hear Mary chuckle behind the door.
Here we go though, Peter is gonna meet Jamie! I've loved seeing all your hopes and predictions. Just know that this is not the only time that Peter will voice his thoughts. As our little Tony-look-a-like grows up, he gets his own voice, and becomes a bigger part of the story. It's fun. :)
Once inside, Tony looked around the room, not turning his sunglasses off. He thought that maybe this woman was another secretary, or PA to this Cavanaugh. It wasn’t until the brunette sat down in the chair in front of the official looking desk. There were a couple of chairs and a couch in the room, and Tony took the single seat that was nearly the furthest away from the desk. The woman pulled out some papers and Tony nodded to himself a little.
"Captain Sassypants."
“What room are we staying in? Is it big enough for everyone? Does it have-“ Tony ruffled his hair and smiled as he walked up to the front desk.
Steve’s could feel his stomach twisting into knots as Tony made a beeline for him. His whole face was growing warm and he hoped he wasn’t turning beet-red.
“Uh, what the hell happened?” Tony asked, looking around. “Did Christmas throw up in here?”
“Well, this is a good start” Tony said, his interest piqued.
“Ok, ok” Bruce interrupted. “That’s enough. Tony, you can do this. Clint, shut up.” He stood, getting ready to drag Clint out with him if he had to, when they heard the front door open yet again.
“First of all, breathe. Calm down. You won’t freak him out and I’m sure he feels the same way, don’t you think?”
, he thought, knowing that this call was due to broken water pipe in the apartment above. Steve took a deep breath, preparing himself for the worst. People never wanted to deal with him or argue over what their insurance covered, not that he blamed them, but it did tend to make them unpleasant.
“You can do that? I mean, just make up a new element?”
“Great” he said with a smile, “we better get her home than. Thank you for your help” he said, shaking everyone’s hand before turning back to Tony. “Now we can go.”
Steve snatched the phone away, but not before Clint saw who the pictures had featured.
“Well now, that stung a little bit” Barton pouted, “this is what I get for trying to be a supportive friend.”
“C’mere” Steve said simply, walking to meet Tony were he had stopped in his tracks. Turning him around, he lifted Tony’s head to meet his gaze and kissed him softly. “Was there something you wanted to tell me?”
Finally he came upon apartment he’d been looking for, 7E. As he approached the door, he could feel the carpet squelch under his shoes.
“No, I thought that if we kept her, you could come up with it, or we could pick one together.”
“Yeah?” he answered, taking some tiny pink pajamas out of the same bag as the diapers and wipes. He held out his arms to take her back, carrying her into the bedroom to lie her down on the bed and get her dressed.
“Yeah, those’ll work” he said happily, taking them and showing her how to fill them up and dump them out. She played in the tub for 10 minutes before Steve decided to wash her up, carefully soaping up her hair and rinsing it with the plastic bowls. Tony watched, marveling at how gentle he was and how natural it seemed to come to him.
“One day” Steve agreed.
“Uh yeah, sure” Steve stammered, “I’ll have to do that.”
“I had some stuff to run by Coulson real quick” he said, grin still plastered across his face. “But I am glad I ran into you.”
“Like there was ever any doubt” Tony shot back, rolling his eyes. “So you’re going to bed now? It’s like, 8 o’clock.”
“How do you know all this?” Tony asked, still standing back warily.
Rolling his eyes, Tony examined the boxers more closely before snickering. “More mistletoe?”
He waved a stack of papers listing every bit of machinery that had been damaged by the flood from upstairs. “I’ve got my list, if you want to start going over them, I can point out each piece. Might take a while though, I was very…thorough.”
have to change it.”
Tony just looked at him for a moment, considering. Steve started to regret asking, wondering if he’d overstepped.
“Um, nice to meet you too.”
Tony was going to say something else, but was stopped by a whiff of something unpleasant. “Uh, please tell me she wears diapers. Otherwise you’re cleaning off the chair.”
He was relieved that this was his last stop of the day, but wished it could have been in a better neighborhood. The building was shabby and run-down, with the occasional boarded up window and broken glass. The front door lock and intercom system looked as though it hadn’t worked in a decade and the lobby smelled of mildew.
Steve left the room leaving them alone. Dropping some Cheerios onto the table in front of her, Tony sat back, giving her a closer look. She was cute, he supposed. Her hair was pretty long, for a kid, just touching her shoulder. It was dark brown with a slight curl to it and emphasized her big blue eyes. She looked as unsure about the situation as he felt, which did make him feel a certain kinship with her. It wasn’t like she had asked to be there either.
Steve just sighed, picking her up and grabbing one of the bags off the counter. “C’mon sweetie, we’ll get you cleaned up. Maybe you should get a bath while we’re at it. You’re not quite as dirty as we were, but you’re pretty close.” He turned back to Tony, “You want to help?”
“What?”
“I think I’m just going to go get changed first” he said, heading for the bedroom.
Clint smiled, purposely ignoring Tony’s outrage. “I don’t know, I was here before you came in, but you seemed distracted, so I figured I’d stay out of your way. Now I can see why. Had I known there was such juicy gossip going on, I would have come by earlier. Coffee?” he offered, making himself a cup.
Rolling over with a groan, he saw that Steve’s side of the bed was empty. Holding a pillow over his head, he attempted to fall back asleep, but the strange sounds he heard kept that from happening.
Steve stopped to lean against the wall, winded after climbing up five flights of stairs. He set his briefcase down for a moment, caught his breath, and straightened his tie. Feeling a little more put together, he headed down the corridor, peering at the apartment numbers in the dim light.
“Oh, h-hey, Steve. I wasn’t expecting you back so soon” Tony stammered.
Steve gave him a sly smile.
“You would too” Steve whispered back. He heard Tony snort quietly behind him. “You would, you just have to get over your fear of kids.”
“With what, the bed?”
“Nah, there’s no – anybody. This can be a lot for someone to put up with” he said. “Or so I’ve been told.”
He could hear the newspapers rustling as they opened the door and the dog realized they were there. Its barks came out in tiny squeaks as its tail wagged rapidly. Staring down at it, Tony did have to admit that it was pretty cute. It was a puppy, but an older one as was bigger than he expected, about calf-high. Its fur was short and fluffy, a light tan color than suggested it was at least part golden retriever.
“Well – yeah, kinda” Steve said with an apologetic shrug.
“Oh, shit! I’m so sorry” Steve apologized, looking for something to clean up the mess with.
She just stared at him, munching away. Grabbing a few Cheerios for himself, Tony popped them in his mouth. Chewing them he made a face, surprised by the quiet giggle it elicited. Trying it again, he made another face, earning himself another laugh. Just then Steve walked out, beaming at the scene in front of him.
“See? You’re a natural.”
“Absolutely right Cap” Tony agreed, kissing Steve again. Hands linked, they headed for the elevator, but not before Tony gave the note one last kick down the hallway.
When no one responded, Tony glanced at their faces. Bruce’s mouth hung open while Clint had a shit-eating grin plastered across his face. The smallest smile played at the corner of Natasha’s lips and Tony’s face went white.
“Yeah, I guess so.”
“You said plenty. You’re not my therapist you know, you don’t have to try and fix my problems.”
“B-but –”
“Aw man, c’mon, we’re gonna miss the best part” he complained as Natasha grabbed him on the other side and they dragged him toward the door.
Steve stared at the pages, knowing that it would probably take hours to get through all of it. Tony look at him ruefully. “Sorry, I know this isn’t how you want to spend your Friday night…”
“Feeling the Christmas spirit yet?” Steve laughed, following him.
Tony just shook his head, trying to resist the adorable scene in front of him. “You said it’s a girl?”
“A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Rogers” the voice said politely. Steve just stared at the ceiling.
“You want a drink?”
Clint couldn’t help smiling, it was just too cute. “It can’t be that bad, I’m sure.”
“No thanks” Bruce answered, gesturing to his cup of tea. Tony just glared.
Tony hesitated, shifting in his seat. “Actually, I never did.”
“I’ve never said it to someone before. Significant others, at least. I know, I’ve got more issues than I could even begin to count, but I haven’t said it and I don’t know how people do these things.”
“Super, let me just put on some shoes and we can hit the road.”
“Cyber stalking Stark, huh?” Clint chuckled.
“Hell froze over, apparently. They’ll probably have stories of winged pigs when they get back too.”
“Yikes” Steve said, wincing in sympathy. “That’s quite a bit of water.”
The printer next to the couch started humming, papers sliding out and fluttering to the floor. “I’m just gonna grab those, go help yourself to whatever’s in the fridge” Tony said, waving vaguely in the direction of the kitchen.
“Oh, sorry” Tony said, shoving aside some papers. He managed to clear off a small space on the kitchen counter. “You can put your stuff down here. I’d love to say it’s not always like this, but…it is.” He shot Steve a sheepish grin and shrugged.
The doors opened and Steve headed down the hallway, knocking on the workshop door. He could hear the deep bass, and guitar, of music coming from inside before the volume turned down and the door unlocked. Steve pushed the door open and stepped inside.
"Good night, Obie," Tony called, dismissing himself from the conversation, and dismissing Obie. He completely forgot about the stuffed animal, and how it would have been visible if you were heading towards the couch.
“Means, I have to change all security measures, at the very least.” Tony sounded more than annoyed. “I’m still digging into what kind of information they might have gotten, and who even did-“
"Because he was able to keep an eye on you," Steve spoke up this time. "Your routine hadn't really changed that much, I'm assuming, and maybe for a while he was content that it didn't look like you were moving on."
"Bruce is working in his lab, and he's in that super intensive mode." Tony sat up on the couch, before deciding to start moving towards his room, Jarvis making sure the call followed him. "And I'm not sure if the wonder twins managed to make it here before the snow storm hit."
Steve got up, watching Wade for a second, seeing his eyes peek out to look at Steve again, and then he was following Tony out into the hallway, quietly closing the door. Tony nodded to Todd at the end of the hall as he went for Meg and Bucky’s apartment. “It would just be crass to say anything else,” Tony said softly.
"Well, it smells good up here," Steve said as let his fingers trail across Tony's arms as he walked by, headed towards the kitchen, following his nose. Tony smiled and followed him, trying not to be as nervous as he felt.
"I couldn't tell," Tony deadpanned. "While she was, doing what she does, her brother came in. Told me all about my weapons that almost killed them.... I know what happened. Do you think that they're going to be a threat, to come after me?"
"Unfortunately, we still have a couple hours until end of shift," Coulson took a seat and put the manila folder he had been holding onto on her desk. She took it, flipping it, and opened it, looking at the paper on top. "I can pick up Peter for you from school."
It didn’t take long for them to clear up the rest of the agents, and the backup that Clint and Natasha had called in, (remnants of SHIELD), were already rolling in, cuffing them and clearing them out of the garage. Tony noted the line of citizens leaning over from the upper floors, and watching from several rows back, and he knew that there was no more privacy for him and Steve. Cell phones were still out, and Steve was still holding onto the shield.
There is a slight description of an anxiety attack below, and I wrote it while starting to experience my own. I really relate to my characters. :)
Steve looked at Tony. He was hiding a lot in his voice as he spoke. This wasn't an easy subject for the genius. "Since I can remember, Da-Howard always talked about you. When I was little, the stories I heard were the most amazing things I had ever heard. I wanted to go on adventures with the Captain, Bucky, and the Howling Commandos. Aunt Peggy-" Tony stopped and Steve looked at him with surprised eyes. Tony swallowed before continuing. "She told me a lot of stories when she would come over."
“Is this normal?” Sam asked, looking over towards Steve.
“Traitors, both of you,” Tony muttered and pressed himself against Steve’s side again.
"Tony!" Pepper practically screeched. He was already done with this. He couldn't stop thinking about Vanko's words.
“Really, I don’t think that right now is the time-“
"I'll let you know the answer to that later," Steve called out from the bathroom.
"True," he nodded. "I'd be real upset if Peter had to change schools."
Tony swore he could only see colors in that moment. Every touch, every feeling, every shift of their bodies, it sent a ripple of color, lighting up everything inside of Tony. His brain was a wonderful work of color, some spots glowing brighter from Steve's mouth, others flaring every few second from Steve's hands and fingers. Tony's own hands were a constant glow, sending pulses of bright light to travel his limbs, and he swore he could map out the internal workings of a human body from this alone.
“You’re not very subtle, Steve,” Tony said as he burrowed his face into Steve’s side.
"I don't remember hitting my head," Tony said with a frown.
Starting to touch on Iron Man 2 in this story, but only parts. Now I'm really starting to mess with things and the timeline, but it should be fun. I brushed over some parts because they would have been identical to the movie, (like Pepper becoming CEO, and Tony seeing Natalie Rushman and hiring her under Pepper's nose), so I went right to the good stuff. Next chapter might be longer, some fun stuff is going to happen!
"Well, there was the destroyed Penthouse," Tony said, adding a dramatic sniffle for effect. "I was gonna live on that floor, and below that I had a guest floor for Mary and her parents." Steve raised an eyebrow at him. "Just because Rachel doesn't like me, doesn't mean I can't be nice." And there was that warm Captain America smile. "The first thirty floors were going to be offices for SI, with another ten floors for R&D-"
"You're going to have to keep a low profile now, unless you want to announce your identity," Mary said, looking over at him. "I'll be staying here with Peter, and Phil, until I'm 100%."
"Young Master Peter?" Jarvis's voice was soft as it came from the collar of his stuffed animal.
"Thank you, Jarvis." She smiled and headed back down to her floor. She had a phone call to make, and a Super Soldier to talk too.
Tony watched him for a second, and then Peter went out to the kitchen to Help Steve with the rest of dinner. He let out a near silent sigh, wanting to keep Peter at this age, not wanting him to grow up, to keep him small, and wrap him up in his arms and hide him from the world. He watched him with Steve and felt a little tug in his chest. They worked so well together, and Steve was smiling, clearly enjoying having Peter around, and helping. Steve just looked, right, like helping with Peter was where he belonged.
"He does," Steve chuckled a little. "All the time. That's just part of who he is though." He saw the strange look Bucky was giving him. "It's a different kind of crazy, endearing sometimes. Tony usually gets manic when he's creating, or talking about science, or something to do with Peter. And he loses himself, all the time, and sometimes it's not the best timing, but again, that's just part of who he is." Steve shrugged, a smile tilting at the corner of his mouth. "It's uh, it's a bit refreshing actually."
"Hey, uh, thanks for that, back there," Tony said, motioning back down the hall. "In-laws, that aren't technically in-laws, but they kind of are, you know." He nodded down towards Steve's hand that was still holding his phone. "Is Fury trying to court-martial me, yet?"
"It's kind of an inside joke?" Steve said with a shy little smile. "Coulson helped me find some phones that looked like ones from the movie, and that would still actually work. I'm pretty shocked that I managed to pull it off, honestly." Tony watched Steve for a second. He had set-up, and pulled off, a well-timed stunt, without Tony's help. "I thought I was going to fall right on top of her trying to dance."
"Says the man that's in the workshop from the moment Peter gets to school, to the minute you go to pick him up." Steve crossed his arms, watching the genius.
“Then I want a dog,” Steve retaliated, backing up slowly towards the door.
Mary laughed and wrapped her arms around Peter. "I've got you my son!"
"Not really that big of a difference," Steve told him. "It's not a problem, I'm just curious."
"Thank you!" Peter cried out. "Thank you, Mr Steve!"
“I’m sure Rachel won’t care. Everyone can admire that sculpted chest of yours,” Tony said as he started to pull Steve towards the door. “I know times that I may have properly worshipped it.” Tony couldn’t help but grin at the dusting of pink on Steve’s cheeks. “Probably shouldn’t say stuff like when we’re about to eat in front of the family.”
"Jarvis will help me get away with your murder," Tony said as the doors closed.
"When I first met Mary, and I found out that Tony Stark was Peter's father, well, I was surprised." She stirred in some sugar and creamer in her own coffee. "At that point, all that was known was that you had just come out as Iron Man not too long before that, and you still had rumors of your party and playboy ways floating around." Tony nodded a little. "I thought Mary was crazy when she said that you were active in Peter's life, and that you actually tried to make time. I mean, the press didn't know about him, and there were no pictures of the two of you together, so I figured it was the bare minimum.
“You should have stayed in the ice, Captain,” she whispered to him, German accent thick, like so many other Hydra agents he had fought again. Steve couldn’t move his limbs, could barely think, as she heft Tony’s body over her shoulder. His body felt heavy, and cold. Another sharp tug in his chest had him looking down and he saw that a small dagger had been pushed in to the hilt. The weapon seemed to be radiating a cold aura, frost building in layers around it, and onto,
Mary stopped, looked at the people running towards the trucks, and looked around. No one else was coming, that was good. She turned around and gasped, seeing Barton inches away from her, gun drawn and pointed at her head. She stood absolutely still, letting him take the pistol from her hand, putting it in his own gun holster. The strange man with the spear approached her from the side, but Mary never took her eyes off of Barton's unnatural blue ones.
I've posted relevant pictures for visuals on my Pinterest
Steve felt the heat from the anger churning. This arrogant- "Wanna make a list? Let's compare how many times I've picked up
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer."
Tony had all but spilled out of the elevator as he made his way to his workshop. It was his safe place, his haven. The Iron Man suits were there, his bots were there, his distractions were there. "Jarvis, black out mode," Tony forced out as soon as he slipped into the work area, leaning against the doors. "Emergencies only." The AI didn't say anything, but the glass went dark. He slid down to the ground slowly, closing his eyes and trying to catch his breath.
Steve had disappeared with Mary and Coulson, and Tony assumed that he was showing them their cake in private before they would have to cut into it. That was fine by Tony, as he was currently trying to walk with Peter attached to his left leg, and Wade attached to his right leg.
"-really can't thank you enough," Wade's mom was saying to Tony. The geniuses’ hands were in his pockets, a smile on his face as he glanced back over at the boys. "Mr Rogers," she smiled at Steve as he walked over. Steve had met her a couple of times when she had brought Wade over to the apartment building. "Mr Stark said you'd be here, too. Can't help but think that this will be one of the safest places my Wade can be."
And the youtube playlist -
“And yet, here you stand,” Loki mocked. “And not out breaking down these bases.”
"You are going to be trouble."
"If you are true in your convictions, then we must call down one of the Arbiters." Tony raised both eyebrows again, directed at Thor as he spoke. Looking back over at Loki he was looking very pleased with himself and Tony bristled.
“Do it!” Bucky shouted before the door shut, and he and Steve were gone.
And it did start to make some sense. Did Tony think that he was trying to take Peter from him? Peter talked about Tony all the time, though, he adored his father. Steve didn't have much time with his father, and his mother for that matter, but these were different times.
"You're a physicist," Tony argued. "I'm an engineer. Really, I'm lucky to be alive since I've been handling this all by myself."
Loki leaned in a little, interested at the tidbit. “There are more little Starks?” Steve turned his head, snarling quietly. Loki raised an eyebrow, almost elegantly, with amusement. “You certainly have attached yourself quite nicely. Perhaps one of them is yours? Tell me, how many more are there?” Steve ground his jaw together a little, then turned his attention back to Dr Strange.
Barton was too riled up to see what was happening though. Natasha was keeping Bucky’s attention, eyes flickering over to see what had suddenly caught Steve. The archer moved with Steve, both getting closer to Tony. Loki moved to stand by Dr Strange, now watching with curiosity. “You can’t just ignore us, it doesn’t work like this.”
"Tony, alright!" Rhodey rubbed the bridge of his nose. "What do you need?"
Jamie babbled, like she was trying to reply to Tony. Steve pulled on a t-shirt and walked over to her, crouching down. She tapped her hands on the edge of the playpen and smiled at him. “Yeah, and by that he means the biggest banana split with way too much whip cream, chocolate, caramel, and strawberry sauce. And way too many cherries that he keeps trying to get Miss Meg to eat.” He reached over and pulled her up, balancing on her on his hip. “I’ve been able to derail that, so far. But, your Daddy likes to do crazy things, and one day I’m going to walk into his workshop, and there’s going to be half a dozen empty cherry jars around.” Jamie pat his arm with one hand, like she was trying to comfort him.
“Normally no, but I don’t know how else to explain this.” He took a seat in the smaller room they entered. Tony started to rub the bridge of his nose. “It’s starting to scare me.” He looked up when he saw Strange pulling a chair up across from him.
"To be fair, he stills likes the stars," Tony pointed at him. Steve held the door to the main floor open so they could leave first.
The Agent grabbed his phone, tapped out a few things before a frown crossed his features. "I don't like that look, Agent."
"You knew what AIM and Hydra were trying to do, so you went about stopping them however you could," Steve finished for him. "What about your memories?"
Silently, Wade pushed the door open the tiniest bit, slid inside, and shut the door again. His shoes were off and he kept himself as low to the ground as he could without actually crawling. Very carefully he took long steps across the carpet, and stopped at the wall that led into the living room, then peeked his head around to survey the area.
"I'm also a father," Tony said with a tiny smirk. He looked between the two boys. "Alright, you've got a deal." He put his hands out, each boy shaking one of them. Jamie let out a coo, then was finally able to reach and pat Peter's leg with both of her hands.
Tony blinked and looked at them. "You have an amazing eye for detail," Steve said to him. "Those are some of the best frosted cupcakes I've ever seen."
"Stark." Tony leaned down on his knee, raising the face plate, to get Yinsen up.
"I know you would have, Sir," Jarvis said almost sympathetically. "But, I thought that it might not be the best idea, considering at the time you were currently invested with the inside of your toilet." Tony wrinkled his nose. "And should you have some sort of virus, you would not want to give it to Young Master Peter." Tony grumbled a little, knowing that Jarvis was right. "Miss Parker has informed me that Peter is currently in the capable supervision of the neighbor." Tony refused to let Jarvis address Steve by any name, other than 'the neighbor.'
"I didn't point out the angels specifically, but I find Cas endearing, to a point," Tony admitted. "But no, I mean, what if Hunters are out there, taking care of the stuff that we don't." Steve watched Tony for a second, mulling over the thought. Tony pulled out two bottles of carbonated water. "Think about it, though. We fight supervillains, some not so super, and sometimes we fight ugly abominations that really have no rhyme or reason to exist, right?" Steve nodded, taking a glass from Tony as he filled it up. "So what's to say that there aren't others out there, like the Winchesters, or Bobby, fighting quietly behind the scenes what doesn't fall onto our scope as Avengers?"
"What's going on Jarvis?" She asked as she started to slip her jacket off. Steve recognized that name as one that Peter often talked about. It was one his Daddy's robots.
"You talk all the time, Tony. I really don't think I need to get you to try to do that."
Steve almost sobbed when he saw Arc and Brave, and he practically fell into them. He pressed his body into Arc’s, his arms wrapping around the giant dog, and he let out a soft, happy, cry when Brave’s wing wrapped around them. They were back, they were alright. Then it happened.
"For the time being," Tony said, letting him walk in first, watching the man take in the mansion. It was obviously something that the man would have never seen back in the 40's, and probably a level of opulence that he wouldn't have even seen since coming back from his ice nap. Peter was already asleep in his arms, having fallen asleep in the car that Tony had managed to get from SHIELD. Happy was with Pepper while she had been on her meetings, so he knew that his friend would be safe.
“So far,” Tony started after the elevator door closed. “This date is better than our first. We’ve actually made it to the elevator, and it isn’t an Avengers call out.”
Rhodey hurried back into the room, uncapping something. "Peter," Tony got the little boys attention back from Rhodey. "You're gonna feel a little poke, but you're going to feel better, alright?" Peter tried to nod as he wheezed in a breath. Tony held onto his hands, rubbing his knuckles. "You're doing just great, Daddy's so proud of you." The pen was pressed to Peter's leg, and the little boy winced at the feeling of the needle.
