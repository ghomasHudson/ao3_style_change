Dean took Cas’ words in, feeling a sharp pain in his gut at the thought of Cas feeling depressed, of Cas being alone.
Dean looks over at the bed next to him, to see Charlie slowly awaking from her rest. She blinks wearily, opening her eyes slowly and gazing at her surroundings.
Cas smiled before closing his eyes again, tightening his grip around Dean’s torso. He laid his head back on the pillow, deciding that he deserved a sleep-in after their busy morning the day before.
Baking was something that was always in Dean’s blood, from the moment he was born into the world. His mother was a baker and an extremely skilled one. She always found she was in her element when she was in the kitchen, around the scent of flour and sugar. So it wasn’t a surprise when Dean found he too had a curiosity and a flare for baking, even as young as two.
From what Dean knew, Cas was still undecided between what college he wanted to attended. Last Dean remembered, he was trying to decide between Yale and Harvard.
“... Need. You. To. Move. Your. Car.” The man spoke insultingly slowly, waving his hands as if he were pushing something. His neighbour looked offended, glaring at the guy in front of him and Cas couldn’t blame him. He was five seconds into this conversation and he was about ready to clock the man.
He replied, obviously curious as to how Dean knew. It was then Dean realised that Meg had never mentioned their encounter to Cas. Dean wasn’t surprised.
“Whether you told me then or now doesn’t change a thing,” he says, “for I wouldn’t love you any less. You are mine Castiel. For now and for always.”
ignored him. He didn’t want a repeat of what he sometimes experienced in the city -- angry, belligerent people who had no compassion for anyone but themselves. Far too many of the residents that lived in his building were like that and people he met on the “L” or out-and-about on the street. He had hoped things would be different here, in this idyllic college town. That was when he began to wonder if he had been too naive.
His mom passed him the pie before she went to pick up Sam who was still babbling in his downstairs crib. While she had her back turned, Dean took the opportunity to leave the house without her.
was he going to speak to him in the middle of a funeral. It was then that Cas pointed and indicated to something at the front of the church. Dean followed his friend’s gaze and instantly his stomach churned at the sight.
Dean listens as the Queen proceeds to tell him everything. How a hundred years ago, a prophecy forewarned them of the return of The Empty, an evil entity who once appeared on the island thousands of years ago. How the prophecy called for four individuals known as champions to protect the kingdom and for them to control four ancient fortresses that had weaponry that could weaken the entity. The prophecy also stated that there was a fifth champion, a knight who had a magical sword, one that could defeat evil and that he was the knight of the kingdom’s prince, who also had his own magic that could send the entity away.
Dean grins. “I love you too, and I’m looking forward to spending the rest of our lives together as old men.”
Dean shrugs. Missouri was the one that gave him his memories back, he isn’t bothered that she knows it’s working.
Dean rolled his eyes. “I’ve never exactly been a fan of peanut butter, we never had it growing up because Cas was allergic to peanuts. Plus, we never really needed to add peanut butter as baking these cookies was probably one of my favourite things to do with Cas.”
Dean was surprised when Claire walked into his store the following Wednesday afternoon, complete in a
The first guests, who happen to be Cas’ brother Jimmy and his family, arrive at ten-thirty. Dean has never met Jimmy, but he can see what Cas means when he says they’re twins. They are identical in pretty much every way possible, apart from their clothes and the way they wear their hair. Jimmy’s hair is much more chaotic than Cas’, who has his hair styled much neater. Dean knows that if the two of them were to ever wear their hair the same way and identical clothing, he’d never be able to tell the difference.
They leave their horses at the stable as Inias leads them into town. The town has the same familiarity and warmth as Vale Village, full of people bustling about, chatting and laughing, as if they are oblivious to the events of the land around them. None of them seem to recognise Dean nor Charlie, but Dean supposes that’s a good thing. He is still curious as to how Lord Inias knows him, since judging from his age, he couldn’t be older than thirty years.
They arrive at a building, two stories high. It’s right in the middle of the village and is flanked by four people, dressed in heavy armour.
Dean nods and enters the order. Before she walks off, he grabs the container and thanks her in sign language—causing her to smile in return. He then places the container under the counter, ready for him to eat during his break.
Dean was used to seeing Cas in clothes that were one size too big for him. Clothes that hung on his frame and were ill-fitting. He’d rarely seen Cas in clothes that fit him, especially ones that were actually
He wanted to argue that he was not visiting for her, but he knew it was impolite to say so. Fortunately, (or unfortunately, Castiel was not sure), Missouri seemed to know what he was thinking.
Considering Anna answered for him, Castiel didn't look inclined to say more. Dean looked down at his own PB&J, wanting to offer Cas his entire sandwich or buy him lunch from the cafeteria. However, he knew Castiel wouldn’t accept. Anna always mentioned how self-reliant her brother was -- that he was fiercely independent and stubborn. There was no way he’d take Dean’s offering if it seemed as if he was just
Claire fidgeted while Jody read, not being able to sit still. She was concerned as to how Jody would react and how she would take the news. Claire had school, assignments due, responsibilities to maintain. She knew the chances of Jody letting her go were extremely unlikely. So when Jody put the whiteboard down and turned her attention back to Claire, the teenager was prepared for the big NO.
They had a boisterous pizza dinner piled around one of the bedrooms. There was a semblance of a plan for the first time, and everyone was excited. Even the tension between Crowley and Cas was lower than usual. Everyone made stupid jokes about President Satan, and there were debates on whether Lucifer could have possessed Reagan as well.
Dean nodded. "That sounds fine to me. Sam, you don't need to move rooms, but would you mind starting to use my shower room? Then whoever else could have the one on the other side. Cas, you can use ours whenever you need a shower." He held up a hand to stop Cas's argument, "yeah, I know you don't need them, but I mean
It was a tangle of limbs before Dean managed to extract himself. He took a deep breath and looked up at the ceiling, trying to keep all his emotions in check. These voices and embraces, from people he thought he had lost forever. He wasn't sure he had ever received as many hugs as he had in the past twenty-four hours between the goodbyes the evening before and the hellos today.
"Hey," Dean squeezed the hand on Cas's shoulder, "We're going to do this together. We'll find him together."
Holidays took a lot out of me. I'm very worn out, but this chapter finally got finished and edited! Yay! Hopefully, now I'll be back on track. Sundays might be more of a posting day than Thursdays though. Oh, and I have a guestimated chapter number up for my season 12 rewrite! And I do plan to keep going, I just wanted to have like a mark that I was working towards. And a Pause if not an End.
Charlie and Cas were waiting when they got to the bunker. There was a hubbub of greetings and back-slaps. They were all tired, though, and began to wander through the map room towards the dorm rooms.
Dean forced a smile and joked, "Yeah, it uh, didn't take." He honestly would rather be in literal hell.
Sam looked up at him with surprise but continued talking about what he had found. "It's uh, not so much." He held up a typed letter, the majority of which was blacked out or covered in red stamps.
She stopped responding to them, and they left, telling a nurse that she was agitated. Back in the hallway with Crowley and Cas, Sam filled them in on the show she had mentioned.
Magda had been extremely quiet and withdrawn since her rescue. She agreed to any plan they made and rarely put an opinion out. She tended to disappear from rooms that they were all gathered in, and it would be ages before anyone noticed. Her psychic training had been going terribly because she seemed too frightened to reach out towards anyone at all since learning of the two people she had accidentally killed. She mostly sat in her room and studied quietly.
Cas grunted and almost moved anyway to tackle someone. Dean wasn't sure who. But the gun flew out of the man's hand and into Magda's. She shook a bit as she held it but smiled in victory.
God!" Charlie stepped between the two. "Hey, back up, lady. I don't know who the fuck you are, but you are not helping things here!" She turned back to Dean. "Hey, take a deep breath, ok. Mary, Sam, and Jody are all in there together. They'll take care of each other, alright!" Charlie pushed Dean to sit on the porch steps and forced his head down to his knees. "Just breathe while I talk to the scary bitch, ok?"
"I am a reaper." She said, her voice full of gravitas. "I don't like to interfere with matters. But you were meant to learn a lesson tonight, and you didn't."
Missouri agreed easily to the test, took a drink of the water, and held the coin with no problems. "I can tell you that the first time we met, you tried to put your feet on my coffee table," she told Dean as proof that she was herself.
There were bags and bags of things that needed sorting lining the hallway outside the kitchen, but they had all decided to deal with them later. Sam had brought takeout, and it covered the island.
Charlie grabbed the duffel that had never made it back to her bedroom and hurried up the stairs to catch up with Mary. The door slammed behind the girls, and Sam physically flinched from the sound.
They all settled on the map room without discussion. Mary and Charlie dumped their loads across the table, and Dean and Cas settled Sam into a chair with a bit more grace.
The swirling confusion was back. He stalked towards the kitchen. His brain had him keeping his gun ready. He waved Mary into a sheltered corner as he passed her.
He realized that Cas was standing right in front of him, a shield between him and the others. But the angel didn't touch him. He seemed to know without a word that Dean would flinch and crack completely if anyone touched him right now.
"Hey, that's what I asked," Dean protested absently. "And you're doing all this because of your accident?"
"And I saw you when I was a ghost... which I don't remember either." She shook her head. "And God's...sister brought me back to life?"
The boys all turned to look at Charlie, who waved them off unrepentantly. "She didn't tell me she was looking for a case." All eyes swung back to Mary, who ducked her head.
"Dean, you have to teach me how to work on these old cars!" Elijah said. "Cas wouldn't let me touch anything!"
"All over. I went back to Lawrence for a few days. And uh, I've been using John's journal to retrace a few things. Try to catch up on what I've missed."
"Kelly...we need your help," Sam said. "You have time to make a choice about the pregnancy, but we have to get Lucifer out of the president."
"If it is him, I will call you," Cas said stiffly. "In the meantime," he tilted his head, meaningfully, "I think you're needed here."
Dean hesitated, not sure if he should keep her talking or focus on the case. He sat back down at the table to work, but Sam had more to say.
Sam had been bandaging Mary's arm on the bed next to them, her hair still wrapped up in a damp towel from the shower she had taken. Dean got one room for the three of them and had volunteered to take the pullout cot. Hopefully, Mary wouldn't mind the close quarters, but he wasn't willing to let her out of his sight after the scare in the house.
"I am. Mostly. But I'm not getting my family captured or killed. So the plan right now is we get Lucifer locked up, and then we run, right? But that leaves an unconscious POTUS, and us suspect as both hurting him and kidnapping Kelly. Or they'll think she helped, whatever. The point is, it's back to Leviathan days, and we're front-page news and our faces splashed everywhere. We won't be able to move an inch."
He hadn't heard anything from Charlie or Mary this morning, and he was getting worried. Maybe he should text them?
Dean and Sam got Ketch bound to a chair in one of the second cabin's bedrooms while the girls got their things settled. Cas called Elijah and chatted with him quietly until Ketch woke up. They insisted Magda stay away from the man, so she and Charlie wouldn't come back until later. Missouri joined them after a few minutes, though.
"Ok, let's get all this straight. Cas, you know Charlie and vice versa. Charlie and Cas, this is Mary Winchester, my mom." Cas' eyes fixed on Dean's for a moment as that news sunk in, and Dean nodded back. "We will figure all the resurrection stuff out in a minute. Charlie..." Dean had to clear his throat, "died a couple of years ago. And at the time, I had a, uh, Mark, on me. And we got rid of it-"
"Ok," Dean said. "Just do what you have to, and I'll try to keep up with you. So far, you and Mom seem the worst affected, so we'll watch out for that."
Dean backed off as soon as Magda started crying. He made sure he'd actually closed the front doors and then went to find Cas and Sam. He pulled them into the kitchen.
Dean noticed Mary wasn't following. She held back, pulling on the wedding ring she had moved to a chain around her neck.
He started up a news video as Charlie and Magda, and Elijah came in to crowd around the small screen with the rest of them.
Sam was looking conflicted too. "I know what she means, though, Dean. It's like, she isn't in this part of the story or something."
"Well, the one downside of healing you," Dean said to the priest, "is that now you're going to be the main suspect in this murder thing." Everyone looked at him in shock, and he held his hands up. "I'm not saying we shouldn't have healed you! I'm just saying we have to plan this! Ideas?"
"Mom, you're hurt," Sam said, and Dean looked up to see a handprint freeze-burned onto Mary's arm, just like on the body they had seen at the morgue.
"You were supposed to owe me one," Billie said, seemingly put out. She came around the pyre to stand with them.
"Now, you haven't filed a report." Sam stepped up to help as Dean moved around to look at the body on the autopsy table. "Has there been any problem determining the cause of death?"
"That sounds extremely specific, Dean," Cas pointed out. "Did she offer you a deal? Let me guess, you were stuck outside and wanted to get inside the damn
"I thought stepping aside would change things, but it feels like this is what Chuck wanted." Jack mused. "One of them dead and the other given up. And you and I, we still lost our family."
"It's alright. I just wondered if you would be willing to sign as another reference for Agent Novak's foster care file since you work closely with him. His records look good, but he seems a bit... awkward." Beth hesitated at the end. "It's not too late to call their aunt if he's uncomfortable."
He turned and met Sam's eyes steadily. "Yeah. What, you don't?" He didn't know exactly what to say here. He wanted Sam to want more for himself, but not to expect more from Dean. "If you want to end different, we're going to have to make some changes, because if you haven't noticed, we're not in the 'live till you're ninety, die in you're sleep' business. This," he waved at the wall of pinned newspaper articles and maps and other detritus of hunts. "This only ends one way."
First, Dean felt like someone kicked in his ribs; the pain from Beth's words and the memories that flashed through his mind were like a physical wound
Dean leaned his head back and laughed. "Sorry, Cas, the gorilla is Chuck. Like he's this huge thing we just aren't talking about. If we're following some script it's gotta be his, right?"
"My point is," Dean said, "that there is a safe place for you. And we do want you there for our own sakes as well, I don't deny it. Sam and I miss you and really want to get the chance to actually get to know you as a person. There's purpose for you too, if you want it, in helping with Magda and Elijah because they need all the comfort they can get. And just..." he sighed, "we would like you to come home."
In a dramatic burst of light and darkness, God left the world on his sightseeing trip with his sister. The sun returned to the sky, and the world rejoiced. Amidst the chaos and drama, a thread of power reached through time and slipped a message into the hands of a barely-remembered goddess. She shared it with her sisters, and they debated for hours about possible consequences before coming to a decision.
But when there were cars around, or he had to make turns, Cas was a model driver and took things very slow. He always seemed aware that there were rather breakable humans riding in the car with him.
Sam muttered. "That's good to know." As if he weren't unfortunately and intimately familiar with every aspect of Lucifer already.
"Mom, he was a hunter," Dean said. "It changes everybody. He was just focused on hunting the monsters and avenging you, not-"
The teenagers gasped in shock, and Dean realized no one had filled them in. "They're just sleeping," Cas assured them kindly.
"Stigmata," Sam and Cas said simultaneously. Sam held up one of the woman's hands, showing the wound on her palm.
"Anyway, visions tend to be disjointed images, flashes of emotions, just a big jumbled up mess that I have to sort through to get clues out of. These have been very different, though. More like... visits, I'd say."
When Gail was brought out, she was shrieking at everyone in the vicinity, "She's the Devil! The Devil is among us! She must be cleansed! She is the Devil! Pray for us!" Over and over again. The local detectives helped her into the police car without responding. Abraham didn't put up any kind of a fight at all.
Light and energy pulsed through the room, and Dean saw Cas covering Magda to shield her from the blasts. Light bled from cracks in Lucifer's skin.
"I think we have to play it out. Ok. Elijah." He turned to look at the teenager, who still looked very confused. "You want Magda to be safe, right?" He waited for the boy to nod slowly, then continued. "Alright. I want you to drag my brother inside. Tell your mom your dad is still looking for the other two, alright? I'm going to turn one phone on and put it in Sam's pocket and one in yours so we can hear what's going on. Cas and I will be right outside. We will get you guys out safely, okay?"
"Yeah, I'm ready," Dean said quietly. "Just... stay here." Cas touched his temple, and he fell asleep.
Dean exchanged confused glances with Cas, wondering how things had gotten so charged in the short time he had been outside, but Cas looked helpless, so they just got Sam out of the house. The walk down the long driveway was quiet.
"Cas isn't even a human being? How does he have enough legal paperwork to be a legal foster parent?" Jody argued.
Cas was looking at Dean with concern, and Dean tried to brush it off but was caught there. He nodded at Cas gratefully and focused over on Beth as she retrieved the case files. The angel dropped his hand and put it into the pocket of his trench coat.
"If you think the stories about Asa are crazy," Bucky said, coming closer to Dean, "you should hear what they say about you."
The house was even more packed than the parking area had promised. It sounded like a bar, though, loud music and beer bottles and chatter. That helped soothe Dean's nerves a bit. It didn't look so fancy on the inside, either. Hunting trophies on the walls and more plaid and pockets on the mourners than his own closet held.
Also, chapter tags: #child abuse, #ptsd, #John Winchester's A+ Parenting. I'll add them to the tags. Dean has a flashback, but Cas breaks him out of it before it gets too bad.
The tiny moment of relief that Cas seemed okay disappeared when he saw the girl. Roseleen Greenfield didn't want to talk about what happened.
Dean took the elevator up. His adrenaline was racing, but honestly, he was exhausted after two days awake. He reached Magda's room, and the relief to see Cas and both teenagers alive was a bit overwhelming. He sat down hard in the chair by the door.
"Sam!" Dean yelled, reaching out to try and stabilize him. He was too far, though. Dean noticed Lucifer trying to hurt them, but nothing was happening. Lightbulbs were popping as the lights continued to pour into Lucifer. "Rowena! Now!"
The teens were loading up plates, and Dean went over to sit beside Cas. The angel was looking over the list Dean had made.
"Or to a person, or a thing!" Sam argued, which was a valid point. "Beth didn't even know the delivery boy!"
Dean followed closely. He tried the light switch, but nothing happened. Sam and he pulled out their flashlights to light the way. The first room they entered was a familiar scene, the whirlwind evidence of a struggle with detritus on the floor and overturned chairs.
"Just a little side stop," Dean assured him. Sam was staring at him, waiting for answers, so he sighed and continued. "I need to get supplies for my project."
"Unfortunately, I'm completely serious, and I need it fast. I got a teen psychic that we have to keep in our custody, and her little brother is under eighteen. So we have to make sure they don't get shipped off to their aunt in Nowheresville. And Cas gets to be Daddy Day Care because apparently, his brain is all Rainbow Connection instead of regular shitty thoughts like the rest of us mortals."
"Ok, so, it's in Iowa. The headline reads 'Priest Claims Demons Walk Among Us.' In the middle of Mass, a social worker named Olivia Sanchez walked in with holes in her feet. She was apparently 'speaking in tongues' and being whipped by something invisible. Then she dropped dead."
They divided up the team again, much to Dean's frustration. Cas went in the ambulance with Magda to the hospital to start doing tests, and Elijah got a ride there with Beth. Sam and Dean walked down the driveway to the car by themselves again.
"I hate you so much right now." Dean glared at Sam and then yelped as a wet towel smacked him in the head.
Eventually, her body was too tired to sob, and she just lay there, clutching an old picture of two small boys to her chest as the tears fell and her soul mourned for the time and the memories she would never get.
Cas and Charlie set pie plates in front of each of them, and they looked away from each other. Dean felt that fragile thing in his chest. He didn't know if this was good or bad, the way they were acting. He took his own plate, where Cas had placed two of the slices of pie, and dug a huge bite out with his fork.
Dean looked over at Cas. It was a good question. Everything felt very surreal at the moment. Sitting here in a forest, with Queen in his ears and Cas looking at him. Even the light was in that strange place between light and dark.
Charlie came in to join the group as Ketch started talking. "It's all very simple, really," he said. "Mick Davies asked you to join our effort, which we're taking international. My instructions are to strongly encourage a "yes."
"Well, no, not anymore, I don't think." Sam stammered, and Dean wanted to facepalm. "But that didn't make me the Devil." And now Dean wanted to argue semantics. "It-it just made me who I am."
Cas smiled and turned back to the car. He touched the gleaming roof rack bars that swept back along the top of the vehicle.
back? I would give anything, absolutely anything to have that. And it would scare the hell out of me."
"She just needs a little family time," Dean argued. "A bit of R&R, she'll be aces." Cas just gave him a sardonic look. Dean dropped his head and rubbed the back of his neck. He sighed heavily and nodded. "Ok, then let's go sit down; talk to Sam. We will figure out how to help her
Gail and Abraham started to shriek again, so Cas got up and put a hand to each of their foreheads, and they slumped down, chins to their chests.
Dean shrugged as he guided the group towards the entrance, "She is human, but she's a psychic. It's a bit confusing. Sam and I are the normal ones." Cas followed them, having finished the clean-up job. He touched Hugo's shirt and cleaned it as well.
They listened to rock music exclusively produced before the 80s. That was easy as most of Dean's cassettes were already in that category. Considering John Winchester had decided that time stopped in 1981, Dean was actually quite knowledgeable about 1970's pop culture and could chat softly with Mary while Sam napped.
"Uh, no, actually," Sam replied. "He caught up with us, but Dean recognized him as having hunted a member of our family a couple of months ago. So we are holding him until you can help us straighten this out."
"Quite," Ketch replied, pleased. He began to monologue again, proving his place as a villain. "Our engineers have spent years blending sorcery and technology. For instance, we don't always decapitate vampires. Inefficient, really, especially for large nests." He pulled out what looked like a sci-fi ray gun from one of the many locked cases the weapons had been stored and brought from the car in. "We irradiate them, reorder their DNA. Their own blood becomes lethal to them."
"Nobody- nobody said you can't date, right?" Dean said, slightly defensive. He laughed uncomfortably.
Dean asked the waitress for a quieter table, and they were placed in a corner booth. Waffle House didn't exactly have secluded spots. He motioned Charlie and Jody into one side of the booth and Mary and Sam into the other. Dean took a chair and sat at the end. He waited until everyone had ordered before starting his argument.
Both cars pulled over, much to Dean's annoyance. He would have preferred if Cas had just kept driving.
Magda and Dean took one room so that Cas could watch over them both since he was feeling very keyed up and Dean needed help sleeping again. Sam took the room next to theirs. Missouri and Charlie took one of the other cabin's bedrooms, and Rowena took the one next to them.
"So what is it now?" Sam asked. An occult symbol on the candle burning on the desk caught Dean's attention.
"Exactly," Sam said, "And this morning, his office canceled all further public appearances without comment."
"Yes, alright." Dean paused, "Oh, uh... since the last time we saw you?" He grinned. "I killed Hitler." Sam gave an exasperated gesture and headed for the pizza.
"Hey!" Sam finally found his voice. "I barely even remember any of that. Between the smashed wall and Cas taking the crazy away, it's sort of blurry, thank Chuck."
"So you'll text us once a week, maybe, but you-" he stopped, his throat tight. He turned. "I need a minute."
His smile was so shy. He reminded her so much of John when they first met, sweet and nervous. She looked down at her hands and the ring still in its place on her left hand. "I just have so much about you boys to catch up on. Mother stuff. You know," she stood, forcing herself to talk around the lump in her throat, "first tooth, first crush."
"Since when are exorcisms unreliable?" Crowley asked. "They always felt fucking reliable to me." He rubbed his chest in remembered discomfort, and Ketch turned to look at him in confusion.
"Yeah. And Lucifer has found the perfect safe house," Sam grumbled. "I mean, how do we even start getting close to the President?"
He had woken from the best sleep he had ever had. There had been zero nightmares either of the typical in-your-sleep type or the more physical kind that with the territory of hunting literal monsters and was the reason he kept a gun under his pillow and silver and iron knives in the nightstand. And why most of his bedroom decor could kill people.
"He's almost never joking," Dean assured her. "And when he is, he usually ruins it by immediately telling you that he just made a joke. We really do need to get moving, though. So this is Magda. Elijah is her younger brother. He's around here somewhere. He's fifteen, and Magda can take care of him if he needs anything," he met her eyes, and they nodded at each other. "Sam and Charlie and Cas and I are all going out. We don't have an extra car to leave you."
Dean looked at them incredulously. "The douchebag? Guy used to roll with purple hair down to his butt and a spiked codpiece."
Dean tried to reach through the hollow in his chest to comfort his brother. He tried to put on the fake smile. He might even have managed it if Cas wasn't staring at him, his expression softening again.
When the food was ready, Elijah and Magda carried most of it out to the war room, where they had decided to eat. Dean brought the bacon tray in one hand and the last plate with an omelet on it in the other.
Sam breathed harshly over the speakerphone, and Dean could almost hear the bitter laugh he was keeping in. "No. No, you're not. You're really not."
"Ok, we have no idea how many baddies or what they might be. We have no idea where Sam is. So we're going to go together towards the house and find a back way in. Then Cas and Charlie will clear upstairs, and Mom and I will clear the ground and basement levels. If there's a cellar entrance, Mom and I will take that. Everyone is going to get out of this mess safely. Do you all understand?"
But there had been a new addition to his bedroom decor that morning. An angel, sitting on the bed against the headboard, with his legs stretched out next to Dean. And from the sounds coming from the phone, the angel was playing Angry Birds.
The grief ripped through Mary's chest like a bullet. It felt like her lungs would cave in. She made it to the bed and pulled a pillow against herself as the sobs shook her body.
Dean had to put a hand over his mouth to muffle his laughter again. "Ok, your next alias is going to be Rick Astley. You have no choice."
"Well, they also cut the pole down, Dean," Cas said. "And the electricians would have had to reroute the lines. They should have just detached the cables from the home itself. This is vandalism." He sounded outraged, and Dean just patted his shoulder.
"This is Dean. Are you with the dickbags who kidnapped and tortured my brother? What do you even want from us? The fancy bitch said you wanted names of hunters or something?"
Driving was indeed slow and confining. Like a long hug. With these children he had helped save, who trusted him enough to sleep against his shoulder. With the soft giant in the front seat, who was his brother in all ways but blood. With Dean, who should feel like a brother but didn't.
"Dean?" Cas croaked out as he pulled the taller man into his arms. Dean relaxed into the embrace. Cas was a solid point in this insane day of miracles. Dean tried to slap him on the back casually but was worried it came off as comforting pats instead. Cas continued to question him, voice croaky with emotions. "You're alive? What about the bomb and the Darkness? What happened?" He managed to look past Dean. "Charlie?"
"Yeah, and hey, Crowley?" Sam was saying. "Uh, find out from your government mole if there's a girlfriend or a mistress or a favorite hooker. Someone we don't know about... got it. All right." He hung up the call and turned to talk to the other two. "Crowley and Rowena will meet us in Indianapolis. Do we have a plan?"
"Well, dear, I'm a witch," Rowena said with a light laugh. She waved a hand at Cas, next to her and then pointed around the group, "He's an angel, she's a psychic, another psychic, two hunters, and the one talking to you is a hunter."
All three interrupted him and then paused to look at each other. Cas gestured to Mary to lead the protest.
Now Jody sat up with interest, her eyebrows raised. "Really?" But her tone was curious, not condemning and Dean was a bit surprised. She even sat forward, seeming eager to hear more, when the television interrupted this horrible conversation.
"I'm an angel," Cas said matter-of-factly, as he always did. As if it didn't blow people's minds and change their entire view of the universe. "And I don't think it's wise to send Magda away until she has learned to control her powers. She should come to the bunker with us and train."
Sam was pushing Dean and Mary away from the rest of the party and Jody was trailing along behind. Dean was thankful someone else was figuring something out. The panic was scraping at the edges of his brain, how did he just keep everyone from fucking
Half an hour later he’s just getting home fully intending to do some yoga and read sci news for the week but he spots Baby parked down the street. It takes less than a second for the decision to form and a few minutes for Cas to be knocking on Dean’s door, the blueprint roll in hand.
The floorboards creaking takes him out of his thoughts. He drops the pencil he just now realized he’s been squeezing to the brim of breaking in his fist for some time.
“How so?” It’s a death glare. Charlie’s all but shooting daggers from her eyes. Dean’s sincere, he’s never thought twice  about Charlie dating girls, it was all cool. Yet the idea of two dudes is making him kind of jumpy.
That’s the last thing he remembers before he falls asleep. He wakes at some point of the night, the room is pitch black. Something heavy is pressing his middle. In his sleep Dean has thrown an arm over him.  He feels compelled to turn to the side to face him, the arm remains persistent on his waist. In the dark, he barely makes out Dean’s face as he snores softly.  In the back of his mind he realizes they’ve never been so close and his eyes just linger on every feature. They stop on the lips and he licks his own, suddenly dry. He is resisting an urge that is not natural and will only lead to trouble.
It’s Cas’ turn to nod silently. When she’s gone he carefully puts his rolles blueprints in the plastic tubing. Maybe he’ll finish in the morning. It’s definitely time for bed now but he feels the pressing urge to take another long look towards Dean’s completely dark house.
“Actually no,” he says, straining to control the nervous twitch in his hand, “I have some work to do.”
“Why are you like this?” he sighs, resigned. Sometimes Charlie’s innuendos are frat boy level of annoying. And she assumes everyone is like her, willing to
He’ll stay just for a bit, until Dean falls asleep with the sleep of the functioning alcoholic. Again, he probably won’t remember anything in the morning. Cas wishes he wouldn’t either. At first they stay quiet, in companionable silence then Dean gives him a look from under his lashes.
The afternoon is fresh and sunny. There’s a gentle breeze as the Impala rolls, windows down, on the smooth highway. Rush hour is still far away. Led Zeppelin are rocking as always. This is the most peaceful Dean’s been in quite a while - just him, the car and the road. The list of mundane tasks, like picking up flowers for Lisa’s party, pop in the back of his mind but he ignores it, trying to enjoy the moment.
“I still haven’t said yes,” Cas starts. He’s not willing to explore what’s stopping him but at this moment no opportunity has sounded less appealing to him.
“And a regular Pepperoni,” Cas chuckles and pauses the game, “for us, the normal people.” He turns to his wife and pulls her for a gentle chaste kiss. Hannah’s expression softens a little.
He wakes by Hannah’s hand on his shoulder. She’s in PJ, a polite but reserved look on her face. “Dean, it’s 11 p.m.” she whispers.
“Dean,” he takes the distance in a couple of long steps. As soon as he can see Dean’s breathing steadily and smells the alcohol on him, he feels relieved but lets the anger take over. The bastard is drunk. He’s passed out because he’s wasted. There is no mortal danger. “Dean,” Cas repeats more sharply and kicks Dean’s shin. There’s a muffled grunt from the pile. “Get up. I gotta get you home.”
There’s around 15 people at the dinner, wives beside their husbands, everyone muttering under their breath the mandatory grace before the food is served. There’s Raphael and Uriel, flawed copies of Bartholomew and Zachariah respectively. There’s Zachariah and his silent wife Muriel. There’s Virgil who, as always, seems a breath away from a violent outburst. And there’s Josie Sands - redhead, fiery, very single and much less conservatively dressed than the rest of the women. Despite all she somehow managed to convince the church leaders she’s the docile image of the Virgin Mary reborn. Yet Castiel has noticed the more involved Josie gets in the church life the more aggressive the sermons get.
“We’ll see,” he answers dryly. The Dean pile makes an effort to move and Cas pulls him up roughly by the arm. He’s not really able to stand on his own so he leans almost all his weight on Castiel, draped like a cooked noodle around him, an arm around his shoulder, Cas’ hand on his middle for support, face buried in the crock of Cas’ neck.
“Castiel, my boy, long time no see,” he says with a smile, that is further away from warm than an ice cube.
“I am really not that young, Barth,” Cas finally gathers the guts to remove the unwanted hand from his shoulder.
Zachariah gives them a sour look bordering on offended but schools his face back to mild. With an unconvincingly friendly shake of his head, makes his exit. He doesn’t say anything to Hannah. Despite her being a top notch employee some of the preachers talk little to her or any other woman Castiel has noticed. It leaves the uneasy feeling it’s not worth their valuable time. Castiel frowns after him.
“So where am I getting with this?” Barth slows a little, his breathing fast, “There’s the idea of what you might do about all that. It’s the oldest story in the book. Get yourself together. Transcend you suffering. See if you can be some kind of hero. That’s the way forward. That’s the only way forward as far as God can tell. That’s what’s being attacked by the godless postmodernists. Drinking. Lusting. Avoiding responsibility. That’s what turns the tragedy into hell.So look out, because they know exactly what they’re doing and why they’re doing it. Don’t let them drag you down.”
Castiel clears his throat, the collar of his shirt feeling a bit too tight. He almost begs in his head for God to put an end to all this. It’s Hannah who answers his prayers.
“It’s still great though,” Dean says a bit too quickly, then clears his throat “You deserve it, you know.” He’s trying to sound upbeat but it comes out a bit hollow. “I’ll be damned if you’re not the most hard
“As good as it gets, buddy,” Dean’s voice is thick with the bravado, but the tension is obvious. “Thank God this is the last one,” he exhales sharply, holding the large rafter as Cas puts the last couple of screws.
Behind the rim of his glass Dean spots a curvy blonde throwing looks at him. She’s a young thing in a very short, very revealing dress. To be honest she looks a little out of her place here. Dean would peg her like more of a glam club kind of gal. He gives her a smile and she smiles back then goes back to talking to her friend.
“Yeah, ok,” Dean says resigned, catching his gaze again but neither of them makes any effort to move. There’s some sadness in Dean’s bloodshot hazy eyes, everything in Cas aches.
“Sorry, honey, I wanted to do something for you, but - uh-, we got carried away,” he smiles apologetically.
The smugness rubs Cas the wrong way but he manages to bring some lightness to his voice when saying “You’re not God, Barth.”
At the back of his head he knows this audacity will cost him some discomfort and more importantly cost Hannah some vile comments but right now he really needs to get away from all this. Besides there’s the not pressing but ever present worry about Dean since the Impala wasn’t in the driveway this morning either.
“I’m looking for Leviathans,” he whispers conspiratorially, eyes glassy and anxious. “They're coming from above, leaving black goo on top of the trees and chimneys.”
He stops just in front of a laundromat with an obnoxiously vivid promo sign at the window. He spots the girl standing under a street lamp right away. She has an oversized sweater over a short shimmery dress. She’s hugging her middle and stepping from foot to foot. Castiel feels a little sorry for her. She can’t be more than 21 years old.
In the setting of mild inner conflict Dean and Cas unintentionally doing couple things without realizing it, you know the usual.
The characters here are a mess, just a mess of fear, prejudice, internalized homophobia and all that jazz. There're doing and will be doing in future chapters some unhealthy and messed up shit. I do not condone any of that!
“Women, man,” Dean smirks after a while but it doesn’t reach his eyes, “Can’t live with them, can’t live without them.”
Back at Dean’s house he’s regained more or less control over his limbs but has turned on the chatty drunk mode. He does that. Whenever the alcohol levels in his blood shift, so does his mood. Sometimes between two consecutive drinks Cas has found himself talking to a totally different Dean. Now when he’s slowly sobering up, it seems to have a similar pattern.
At some point Dean notices Cas has dozed off, lips slightly parted. It’s late already so he should go but suddenly feels exhausted. He relaxes on the opposite end of the couch, toes tucked beneath Cas’ thigh and his eyes close on their own. They have this unspoken tendency whenever no one’s around to reduce physical distance. Standing close, shoulders pressed while sitting, small shoves and arm squeezes. Dean can’t think of anyone else he does that with. If he was 12 years old and a girl he’d say that means they’re best friends. But now he shrugs it off because their friendship is just weird like that. A whirlwind of visions from the evening pass through his mind before it drifts away into slumber. He feels very comfy.
“We went home, and we-, uh-, then he-,” a pause, then a whine “He passed out, he’s breathing but- úuh, I…”
“Yeah, look at us,” Dean grunts and empties the whiskey bottle. “Grown ass adults in our 30s, pursuing success.” There’s some bitterness in the statement that is causing a stinging pain in Cas’ heart.
“Are you sure?” They’re not often physically intimate, partly because Castiel is often absent, but mostly because they never got over the awkward phase that leaves them both cold and frustrated. When they married Castiel though he’d find it in himself to desire her like a man should desire his wife. It never happened no matter how many prayers he said. Hannah’s horror in the face of any sexual act didn’t help either. Yet they tried because they were supposed to.
Noticing the empty bottle Dean stands up, going to dig out another. When he sits back down, new whiskey in hand, he sits a little bit further away and Cas can’t help but notice. Without being an inherently tactile person, Cas has to fight the urge to move closer.
For a short second all Dean sees Cas’ face lightening up as he strides towards him, pulling him in a hug. Dean’s not a hugger generally but he makes exceptions on some occasions like this. “There, there,” he pats Cas on the back and Cas’ arms tighten around his shoulders.
rambling comes to a halt, as he glances at Cas.  “What does Hannah think?” It’s like the question just surfaced in his brain.
For some reason this news feels like a punch in the face. “Oh,” Castiel’s voice is unexpectedly small, “You should do that.” And I should be happy for you, he thinks to himself. If anyone deserves a little bit of confidence boost that’s Dean. Except when it comes to women. Also getting out of his home city wouldn’t hurt either.
Dean moves closer, pressing their bodies together.  Castiel trembles, but is not letting go, not in a million years. His hands travel up and down Dean’s back, dig into his hair and he just wants, wants, wants so bad. His entire being is on fire. Dean’s erection presses against Cas’ tight, hips rocking slowly.  The friction against his own desperately hard cock draws a wave of pleasure unknown until now. He urges himself not to moan but Dean lets a barely audible sigh, mumbling something incomprehensible.
“Just passing by,” she answers, not lifting her eyes from the screen. Most of the time Charlie says in the office or is home, doing her
“Maybe if I take that promotion…” he trails off, his insides freezing with the thought of leaving Lawrance permanently.
“You’re so devoted to him. You’d do anything for him. It’s endearing, really.” Lisa’s anger is palpable but nevertheless her lip quivers and the angry tears in her eyes come dangerously close to falling.
He looks at his phone and sees it’s 6:00 a.m. The jet lag is messing with his sleep. He gets upstairs and turns on the coffee machine. It’s rather surprising when he hears soft footsteps while he sips his first of many cups of coffee. Hannah wraps her arms around him from behind and rests her chin on his shoulder.
Charlie rolls her eyes, “Am I a nerd or am I a bimbo? Make up your mind, Dean.” Dean snorts in response. Charlie is so much more fun to talk to than most women. She hits a key on her keyboard sharply and closes the laptop. “Either way, look at me go home early in the afternoon while you keep sweating around here.”
“Err.. For one, I’m not like that,” he starts, “Besides, two guys? That’s just- hm” He’s about to say ‘wrong’ but manages to keep himself from it. “Weird.”
“Hey,” Dean says quietly. He looks confused but one of his hands comes to grip Cas’ arm “What are we doing?”
WARNING! Alcohol abuse. Internalized homophobia. Borderline of consent *because we know the inner monologue of the character*.
“Sure.” Cas looks at his feet for a moment before adding, “My next gig is nearby, just in Toronto and will probably be a short one.” His tone borders on apologetic.
“We, the mortals, are thrilled to see you then,” Dean wipes his hands on a rag and sits cross legged directly on the ground.
“Look, I’m just not like that,” he forces himself to bring more sternness in his voice, eyebrows furrowed. “My dad always told me guys should be tough, you know, reliable and strong. Girls can be soft, can do whatever they want. You cannot be a real man if you open your legs for someone.”
It all happens so quickly, too quickly. The kisses are simply presses of lips, confident and not lingering. Dean pulls away slightly, but remains only a few inches away. “Sorry”, he chuckles, like he’s just told a joke no one else gets. “I’ve got to sleep this off,” he stands and walks towards the bedroom.
Dean’s windows are still dark even though it’s way past midnight. Cas is reluctant to admit he has kept an eye on the house next door more or less since after dinner. He wanted to check on Dean since he seemed way too tense this morning. After last night Cas decided to ignore the drunken kiss, as Dean seemed to not remember it either, and he has extensive experience in ignoring things that bother him.
“‘M fine, k?” he protests but doesn’t really resist when Cas pulls him up to his feet. He’s a little wobbly and Cas isn’t entirely steady himself. “Shit,” Dean curses and grips Cas’ shirt. “Damn cheap whiskey
Bartholomew’s eyes each individual face around the table. They stop on Castiel a second longer than the rest.
“You give your wives so much freedom.” Bartholomew fixes him with a stare “If I were you I’d advise her to pick her causes better.”
“Thank you,” Hannah squeezes Gabe’s hands and heads to the door, “I really have to go now. See you at lunch, right Castiel?”
“It’s fine,” she mumbles, as she takes the barstool next to him. “Didn’t want to see you early anyways.” She gives him a knowing smile and he tries to smile back. “Anyways, I just have to get to work early. There’s so much to do with the foundation’s latest fundraisers.”
It takes Dean five minutes to be engrossed by the sketches spread on the kitchen table. He’s much more awake now, looking like a kid on Christmas morning,his face shining with a peculiar light.
catching glimpses of the light in Dean’s kitchen window, but finally gave up and came here. When Dean doesn’t answer after the third ring on the bell, Cas pokes about the doormat, searching for the spare key. The Impala is parked nearby, there’s the muffled sound of music coming from the inside, so by all signs Dean is home, there’s nothing wrong in Cas letting himself in.
“No- it’s my fault” Hannah looks at him with teary eyes, her lip quivering, like she’s just now seeing him. She pulls the sheet tightly around herself. “Can you please just hold me?”
“There’s no use of trying to move him at this point,” she gestures towards Cas curled against the armrest. “He’ll be grouchy if awaken.” She pulls a blanket from the back of the couch and throws him over him. “Will Lisa be waiting for you?”
“Uhm, a week maybe,” Cas says, somehow apologetically. He consults power plants all over the world for the company AUE Global and often finds himself wherever he’s needed for however long he’s needed. Dean does not sigh. “My place?” Cas cocks his head towards the much neater house next door.  Being neighbours wherever he’s in town really helps hanging out as grown ups.
“Yes,” he answers without hesitation, “She’s kind of controlling and has so many expectations from me.”
“Companion?” Dean raises an eyebrow, “Friends are companions, women are… dunno, they’re fine for a while but then they become invasive.”
Even going through the motions requires some easing into. Castiel thinks about how Dean seduced those girls. He remembers long looks and soft touches on arms or the small of their back. He pictures Dean’s arm around a thin waist, gentle but solid. He’d kiss his lady just before they leave the bar, deep and hungry. The girl would be left breathless as Dean would move to her earlobe, whispering something in a low voice. The image stirs something in Castiel and he presses Hannah on her back, trying to replicate that magic.
“Yeah, he’s arriving a day earlier -” There’re the obnoxious slurping noises again. “Do you mind?” Dean wrinkles his nose as Charlie gives him a pointed look from behind the smoothie.
“And I forever will be grateful for that, but Dean, look at me and say you love me,” she fixes him with sorrowful eyes and Dean’s words stick in his throat. “Tell me you wouldn't rather be with Castiel right now.” She forces the words out, Dean is sure this is painful for her no matter how often they’ve done this in the past.
Castiel doubts Hannah knows what his brother is actually up to most of the time, otherwise she wouldn’t be as benevolent to him. Gabriel is the black sheep of the family much to their mother’s chagrin but since he stopped attending church a couple of years ago, she barely speaks to him. Once or twice Hannah has mentioned wanting to get him back in God’s flock. Castiel doesn’t tell her Gabriel was never part of the flock in the first place.
Bartholomew frowns for a second and he looks about to give a preach but then the lines on his forehead smooth and he simply shakes his head. “You, the youth today, are so liberal” Attempted mildness doesn’t suit him at all.
Then finally, he appears. Cas is dragging his suitcase, wearing the ugly beige trenchcoat neither Dean nor Hannah will ever admit that they are fond of. Sometimes, even though rarely, the best friend and the wife agree with each other.
He wants to explain. He wants to say there’s nowhere else he’d rather be. But he can’t. He wants to reach and comfort Dean somehow. He wonders who Lee is and why he’s never heard of him.
“I’d never- …, you know, with him if I knew he’s not single.” Cindy’s blushing and gives an apologetic look.
An avalanche of shame fills Castiel, as he backs away immediately. He knows she couldn’t have peaked at his thoughts but the guilt was bitter on his tongue. He doesn’t say anything, just watches her curl into a ball, letting out a small sob. He feels like the most pathetic excuse for a man. Unworthy. Incapable. He wants to reach for her shoulder but the gesture feels empty.
“God, no,” she snorts, shaking her head. “At least one of us has to live in this house to call it a home.”
Cas turns to see the bearded man with glasses and baseball cap strolling around with something that looks like a vintage tape camera in his hand. Frank has lived across the street since before Castiel and Hannah moved here. What Dean and the other neighbours have told about him it seems the guy has some mental health problems, often speaking nonsense but generally not doing any harm.
From this angle the gazebo-to-be seems huge but in fact it’s barely anything yet. After a moment Dean says “So, when is it?”
Gabriel sighs deeply and there’s something in his eyes that makes Castiel sad. “Right there with you, little bro,” he stands up and straightens his jacket “Don’t you have to get ready for church or something?”
“You know what?” Lisa stares at him with a sour resignation on her face “My friends are all wrong about you.”
In a few minutes the heaving has stopped and Dean leans on the bumper, pale and sweaty. He’s a sad picture. Castiel gets a bottle of water from the trunk and hands it to him.
thing. Some days, especially after a night of heavy drinking, Deans hates that he can’t do his thing from home.
Maybe it’s the sudden movement, but there’s a painful spasm in his gut and his head swims. Dean barely manages to push away from the girl, before vomiting profusely on her cheap carpet. As he tries to straighten up, black spots swim before his eyes and his limbs feel like jelly.
“Huh” Dean looks kind of surprised at the situation but comes to support his own weight on his elbows and slides to rest against the headboard. There’s something in his eyes Cas is not willing to identify.
He should get concentrated. He refocuses again, gripping Hannah’s hips and starting to grind slowly. Would Dean wrap his arms tight around those girls, holding them warm and secure? Would he be demanding or would he be gentle while exploring every inch of their skin? Would he stare into their souls with those green eyes-
“Lookie, lookie what we’ve got here,” Castiel jerks in his seat, turning in the direction of the unexpected voice.
“Of course not, Mr. Big Engineering degree,” Dean throws him a smirk. “It looks like a very stable frame but it would take some time even if it’s both of us. And with you gone I will go slowly.”
“And it was absurd. Yes, I did miss her party but I apologized,” somehow he found himself rambling, “Also she implied some crazy shit about me and Cas. The girl went completely nuts, I don’t even know anymore.”
“Lis, please,” Dean repeats but his higher brain functions are out of order right now. “You know Cas is not often here. I had to see him. But I’ll make it up to you, I promise. Just tell me what you need and I’ll do it.”
He knows the shame will catch up in a bit but now he concentrates on moving, opening the bedroom door, going down the stairs, walking out the house, going to his own room and getting to the bed where his wife sleeps. He sits on the edge but can’t bring himself to lie down next to her. He remains still for the next few hours while the sun starts to rise.
turn his eyes away. “Besides, you’re surprisingly tough for a little nerdy dude.” Cas shoves him in protest, as they both laugh. A warm fuzzy feeling fills him and for a moment the background longing to touch Dean becomes overwhelming. A squeeze on the shoulder, a friendly hug, nothing suspicious, just to show affection. The memory of the Friday night reemerges and warmth turns to ice.
She turned back to confront Billie, who seemed a bit thrown by this little redhead bossing around Dean Winchester. "Ok. Please. Can you just cut him a tiny bit of slack and tell him if you reaped his mom, brother, or Jody? Otherwise, we are just going to get panicked Dean, and that leads to cosmically bad choices."
Magda shook her head and said nervously, "I don't want you to have to move. That would make us upset, too. We've talked about it a bit while we looked around the rooms. We thought It might be nice to have rooms 18 and 20 if we aren't going to share? They share a wall, so we would feel close to each other, but they face different hallways, which is cool." She shrugged and folded back in on
"Magda, that wasn't your fault. You are not the Devil. You're not evil. And it's scary. I know it's scary. But you can learn how to control it. You don't ever have to hurt anyone ever again."
So this chapter was actually really hard to write. This episode never really connected to me and seemed weird and disjointed, so it was really hard to just focus and write. Not to mention I happen to live in America and the whole January 6 domestic terrorism kind of distracted me this week :(
so much younger than his childhood memories of her. In his memories, she was firmly an adult, with old eyes and angelic blonde hair long down her back. But this woman. She was still young, not even out of her twenties. Her hair was blonde but messy and tangled from sleep. She had the strong muscles and cautious awareness of a hunter.
!'" she quoted dramatically, and Dean snorted and glared. She had sullied his brain with her stupid cult tv shows. "Look, we've been taking it slow. She doesn't seem to notice I'm here half the time. I just stay with her, put food in front of her, and credit cards and good ID in her wallet. It's going okay, but I don't know what's going on in her head."
Their first stop in Minnesota was at the morgue. As usual. They had changed into their suits at the last rest stop, and Mary led the way into the autopsy room.
Another man sitting at the kitchen table turned to stare at him, too. "No freakin' way. Aren't you dead?" He looked for confirmation from his buddies as he continued. "Like four times?"
"Goodnight, Dean. I will be walking the kitchen and library, so please don't go looking for more whiskey. I promised Charlie. I'll bring you another beer if you want it."
Dean wasn't sure that was entirely true. Usually, time apart meant they were furious with each other, or one of them was dead. Or a demon. Or, at best, working with a demon. There weren't really any good memories of them just "taking time apart."
"Mom?" Dean called back, pulling out his crowbar to fend off any ghosts. He kicked himself for letting her go off alone.
"I'm in," Magda said firmly. "I've been fighting the devil for five years, and I'm ready to get a hit in. I've still got a lot to learn, but I've got control enough to be helpful." She looked to Missouri, who nodded.
Kelly nodded, and Missouri sat on the bed on the other side from Charlie. She reached out and touched the woman's belly. After a moment, her face turned to surprise and awe. Dean reached out to stop her, but she drew back after just a moment.
Charlie grinned, and Cas grumbled something about having lead Heaven's armies before, but Dean ignored it.
The moment he was in the stairwell, Dean paused to orient himself. He grabbed the gun from his back waistband and held it ready, scanning the levels immediately above and below. There was a crash as a door closed on the ground level, and Dean bolted down the stairs. He shoved the gun back in his waistband, not wanting to frighten civilians. But when he reached the ground floor, there was no sign of the man in the crowded hallway.
Dean couldn't. He opened his mouth, but a lifetime of smoothing things between John and others made it impossible for him to make things messy.
"You're not the boss of me," came the retort in a very familiar tone. Dean turned to see Billie, a reaper he'd met a couple of times, standing in the driveway with them.
"I'll even out the back for you, Mary. A new 'do is a great way to start a new chapter, isn't it? I've been thinking about growing mine out, actually!"
Dean sat back with a sigh. "I don't know for sure, but I have a theory. It's uh... kind of complicated though." He didn't know where to start and ended up just blurting things out in a jumble. "So, I know about hunting and stuff. We all do. Dad figured it out after you died and raised Sam and me as hunters. And then way later, we found out you were raised as a hunter when we time traveled and met you, twice, actually. And we met your ghost once, too." Wow, he was way off-topic.
"How'd you get the card?" Dean asked. He pulled at Charlie, who had fallen asleep in her chair, and pulled her along with them.
"That is a logical fallacy called a False Dichotomy," Cas interrupted. His jabs tended to be more polished than Dean's. "We are perfectly capable of knowing both God and the Devil, and unfortunately, on both points, we do."
They both stopped dead at the bottom of the stairs. Bloody streaks marred the tiled floor. The hope Dean had been feeling began to drain away.
"I'm getting there, sugar. Let me tell my story." Missouri said. "The first time she came to visit me, she said her sister hadn't liked you boys, and she wanted a second opinion before she did something big. I told her I hadn't seen you in person in a long time but that you were bright, pure souls. I told her of your auras and your childhood and your father. She nodded and left.
Dean grasped where Sam was going and plastered on a smile, "Yes, you'd be doing us a favor if you let us tag along."
"Now, you wait patiently for just a few more minutes, perhaps get me a caffeinated beverage. Then you all tell me I am your queen and we go to a concert," Charlie said happily. "I think I've found the right person; I just need to get access to their accounts."
It was hard to get everyone settled that night. With Missouri's warning in mind, they all eventually decided to let Cas put them into a deep sleep instead of trying to fight it.
He turned, and Dean grabbed his shoulder. "Hey! What the hell does that mean?" Dean asked defensively.
Cas shook his head. "There's nothing on Angel Radio," he informed them. "Also, heaven is still locked down, so it's doubtful there are any rogue angels around. Other than myself, I mean."
Sam wished he hadn’t said anything to watch his brother be really happy for the first time in so long and then take away the hope. Maybe they could change the spell or…
Dean didn’t know. He was still feeling claustrophobic. But the idea of Cas leaving again filled him with more dread.
Dean couldn’t bear to look at him now so he just nodded and walked to the car. If jack wouldn’t bring him back, He’d just find a way to go down there and get that feathery ass idiot back himself.
“I know!... And I’d do it in a heart beat.” Dean said. “I’d take him possessing me than dead any day.” Dean’s voice broke. Sam noticed him clenching the bloody jacket in his hands white knuckled.
Dean was happy. That was it. yeah Sure there were some downsides to sharing his body with Cas, like not being able to actually hold him. or that he didn’t have any walls between his thoughts and feelings and what Cas saw. And there was a lot of those that he had repressed before; which shocked Cas at first. Like how much he actually felt for the angel or how much he longed for him all the time or how much him being gone had hurt like a knife cutting in his ribs. However the fact that Cas was shocked the first time he felt what he was feeling meant that he had to know.
Sam patted his shoulder before going. Dean knew that he didn’t want to feel whatever he did. He didn’t want to feel betrayed and stabbed in the back again. Because it triggered all his hellish memories. he also knew Cas didn’t mean it but it didn’t erase the fact this must not happen ever again. This could not ever happened again if Cas wanted them to still have whatever they had these days. he couldn't spend every day every second worried about the next time Cas would deem necessary to decide for him.
“I know I think the same” Cas said. “No Dean I don’t think we should…that’s not what she said….it could be a trap”
Sam stood there while apparently cas was answering dean talking inside his mind. God this was so confusing. He had no idea how his brother could stand it.
“ I think we should go… she said she would make it worthwhile. “ Dean said. “ And I wouldn’t pass at a chance to kick her ass after that goose chase she sent us to.”
Sam was going through Rowena’s notes for the thousand’s time and Dean was done. He had the ingredients. He knew the ritual by heart. And he needed Sam out of the bunker for this he didn’t trust him to let him finish it. And what he had to say… he couldn’t say them in front of sam.
“Okay” Dean said his voice firm but low. “Cas? Castiel. Do you hear me? Castiel...You need to come back. Please....I... I'm offering you my vessel. I’m…. I’m saying yes.”
“What’s going on?” Sam asked exasperated to be left out. Suddenly cas’s eyes flashed blue and his pose changed.
“His blood.” Sam said looking at him.” We could just use the same spell nick did to bring back Lucifer.”
“Look I know it sucks being possessed…let me say this okay? But I also know what I felt about it was because of our past angel possession experiences. You know...Lucifer, Gadreel, Micheal… They screwed us up. Took control.”
“So you know why I can’t just sit on my thumbs and wait for whatever she’s talking about to go wrong.” Dean said and opened his eyes to see Sam in front of him looking frustrated.
“Calm down… this is just a dream.” Cas said pleadingly with his hand up. Like he wanted to come closer but he was physically retaining himself from doing so. “I just wanted to talk to you before leaving.”
Dean couldn’t believe this. Cas wouldn’t trap him in his own mind, would he? No this can't be happening. Panic rushed in his head. He felt helpless. like when Michael had trapped him under water.
Sam had just come back from his morning jog to see Dean smiling at himself behind his laptop. He just hoped he hadn't interrupted anything with the ridiculous look in his brother's eyes.
Dean was standing in water… waves were crashing at his ankles… he felt the sand under his toes... he thought he was stressed about something but couldn’t remember what. He decided to enjoy the moonlight on the waves instead. It was so beautiful so peaceful. Nobody was around. He decided to lie down on the sand and watch the stars for a while.
“No no no no.” The cas in his mind said while coming closer to him with his hand raised. Dean stumbled back. He couldn’t breathe… why did he even need to breathe? he needed air... he needed space.
Dean couldn’t answer he just stood up and ran to his room. The coat. He hadn’t been able to wash it. He couldn’t erase the last bit of Cas that was left for him. It was sitting there in his closet. He picked it up carefully his fingers dancing on the handprint. The bloody handprint that had gone black with age. He heard the footsteps behind and turned around to face sam.
Dean felt his mouth go sour with remembering the suffocation of micheal’s hold. his own face looking at him from the mirror but not recognizing the cold collected look.
He turned around to the voice and was shocked to see he’s in bed, Cas standing in the corner of the room. Suddenly everything came back to him and he felt the panic starting up.
Sam had woken up around five to go to the bathroom and on the way back he remembered his ipad that he’d left in the basement. When he was about to go in the already open door, he saw dean. Slouched on the floor, leaning his head against the far end wall behind the chair, bear bottles scattered around him. He seemed to be asleep. That was when sam had realized what exactly was going on and also could guess where cas had summoned the empty. Now he could make sense of the late night researches, the random biblical lore books he found out of place around the bunker. Dean hadn’t given up on bringing cas back and he wasn’t doing much well by the looks of it.
There was no good response to that. Dean felt gutted at the words, even though he thought himself long past the pain of his mother's death.
Dean left her to work and backed up. Mary came with him, looking lost. They sat down at the map table together.
"Well," said Sam. It was his practical voice. "You know, sometimes families do better after a little time apart."
"Ok, so the plane was registered to," Charlie put on a fake accent, "a Lady Toni Bevell. Super hot but also, like, stupidly posh. Anyway, I managed to dig up financial's and got a rental payment for a farm in Aldrich, Missouri."
Opening the door to a pitch-black space was never a fun prospect. Dean figured coming into the basement gave up any element of a surprise anyway and flipped on his flashlight.
"Oh, good. I'll leave you a credit card then, and you can help them get groceries if they need it?" Dean asked. Missouri nodded.
Cas sighed again and leaned back against the stair rail. Dean released him now, satisfied the angel wasn't going to run. "She doesn't seem to feel like she fits here. Like she belongs."
They met back downstairs to decide their next step. The priest introduced himself as Hugo de la Croix.
"Asa, he was just al- he was just always so stubborn." Bucky protested, but his voice was guilty and everyone turned to stare at him.`–"Look, we were in the woods. Jael, he- he was taunting him. Asa wanted to chase him, but he didn't have the Angel Blade. I said, 'Let's go back.' He called me a coward and he shoved me, so I shoved him back, and he fell... and he hit his head. I didn't mean to do it. But it was a mistake—an accident. I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do. Asa hated that damn demon so much that I just..."
Cas looked up, confused. "I have no idea if she was hot. And I didn't wear a gown. We were on a mission. I wore a sensible walking skirt and tailored overcoat. Hm. It was very much the same color as my trench coat. Anyway, it was not a pleasant mission, and I'd rather not think about it anymore," he finished crossly.
Billie took Charlie by the hand and pulled her off the car to stand. Then she walked around her, inspecting the human woman from all sides as Charlie stood awkwardly.
"But anyway, we've been dealing with this, um, entity, called the Darkness, who is basically God's sister. And I was out here alone because I was supposed to blow her up with a soul bomb. But then, she and God kind of made up, and I helped a bit. As thanks, she said she would give me something I needed, and I walked out of there and bam! There you are!"
"Okay," Dean agreed. "Then for information. We've got Father Hugo searching texts for info on getting an angel out of a vessel. Crowley has someone feeding him info on the President. Other than that, we're a bit low.
?" She stared into space, a few tears falling down her face. "I... I need a little bit. I want to know more, do you understand? But I need to process." They nodded, starting to learn that Mary couldn't talk through her feelings easily. She pulled each of them into a tight hug, her fingers clutching at their necks and shoulders as if she could hold them together years after the wounds had happened.
Billie looked at her and tilted her head in confusion. "Yes. I took you, didn't it? Why are you back here?" She turned a glare on Dean. "Winchester, what have you done now?"
"Good." He hesitated, hands shoved in his pockets. "Uh, and I wanted to say... if you ever want to talk, I know what it's like to come back and not feel like you really fit."
"Me and Sam are gonna use Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek from The Doors, so you have to be Robby Krieger or John Densmore. It just makes sense!"
They made him think of Cas, even now. It shouldn't, by all rights. He had several of his own, as did Sam. It was just another tool. Another weapon in his arsenal. But every time he saw one he thought of it materializing out of Cas's sleeve; thought of him spinning it in battle with a kind of confidence he rarely showed.
"It uses a mix of fucking punch cards and magic lightbulbs, Dean!" she cried. "I'm not fucking Katherine Johnson! And no, I can't just plug into it! "
Also, why do you think Mary HAD to go? Maybe someone's "pulling her strings?" Hint hint. Lol, you already know the story!
Lucifer sucks and LOTUS was way too cool a title to give to him, so the song reference is for Kelly.
Cas did that horrible thing he did where he stood next to Dean, quiet and gravely serious, and pulled the truth out of him just by being there.
They all ended up sitting around the Bellaqua Hotel lobby, waiting for Charlie to break through someone's email or other.
All four of them moved quietly through the untidy trees around the property. Even Charlie had picked up forestry skills in Oz. They were only a few yards from the house when Cas stopped them with a hand on Dean's shoulder.
Mary looked at him closely. She seemed to see him for the first time, coming out of her confused fog. "Oh, Dean. I spent my life running from this, from hunting. And I got out. I never wanted this for you and Sam."
"You don't really seem like a more enlightened group," Charlie commented, "what with the torturing Sam and having a personal wetwork guy."
"So, what exactly is the plan?" Charlie asked. "Do all of us go? We can't just leave Magda and Elijah here alone."
"You sure you got the swing of that thing?" Dean nodded his head at Mary's EMF reader. It was kind of a moot point since all three readers had completely lit up before the door had even closed behind them. This house was very clearly haunted.
Sam had a valid point that they probably wouldn't be well accepted as FBI agents by these people. Even social workers would probably be unwelcome, but at least the Petersons were used to that. So they stopped at a store to buy sweaters and khakis since that wasn't a disguise they typically packed.
" said Sam, which was a ridiculously naive thing for a 33-year-old hunter to say, and Dean sort of wanted to slap him on the back of the head.
Dean was able to get to the shotgun before Moriarty was back on his feet. "Don't make me," he said as he pointed it at Mary's body. But the ghost tore it out of his hands with a gesture.
"I didn't mean it." The tears were thick in her voice, even through the phone. "She was pretty, and she always smiled. And I thought that maybe she could help me. I couldn't talk to her, but I could hear her thoughts. And I thought that maybe I could make her hear mine. So I prayed. And I reached out to her... but she never came. And I did it again with the delivery boy.
Abraham and Elijah made their way out of the barn and back to the house, and Sam followed shortly after. He looked as shocked as Dean felt. He pulled out his phone, but there was no signal, and Dean came up to let him know he was already here.
They were sitting quietly on the edge of the Impala's hood, Dean's arm around Charlie's shoulder as she breathed slowly. Loud heels clipped across the cobbled stone of the drive, and Dean called for the person to leave them alone.
"Who is it? Sam?" It wasn't Sam's voice, but he called out anyway. There was an arch, and a couple of steps separated the map room from the hallway.
"Cas, you have to pick less obvious names! This is Beyoncé all over again! You and your freaking pop music."
"Yeah," Dean muttered, "I wouldn't have voted for him, even if I did have legal ID, but I'm pretty sure Satan is worse. Especially now that Satan is in a bad mood because he and God had that not-fight and God went off to explore the universe, and now Satan feels all rejected and pissy."
"Yeah, sorry about Elvis," said Flannel guy. "He's uh... Elvis. I'm Bucky Sims." He shook Dean's hand.
"NO!" Dean protested. "First, they are teenagers! Second, we legally fostered the one that's under eighteen after getting their parents arrested for beating the shit out of her and forcing them all to live on a farm with no electricity. And third, hey!
Finally, Moriarty burst out of Mary with a spark of flame. He cried out as the fire ate at his incorporeal form. The forms of six children flickered into sight around him. They stared at him, cold and sad as he burned to ash. Then, one by one, they dissolved into blue-white light and floated away.
"Okay, listen up," Dean said quickly, "we don't have much time. Missouri and Charlie. Crowley's coming back for you. Missouri, I need you to calm Cas down. Charlie, you gotta work fast on keeping our faces off the news or get them changed somehow. I'm trying to avoid another Leviathan shitstorm. Kelly, we're gonna have to tie you up, and you're going to be the poor kidnapped bait, alright? We're trying to clear your name, so you don't go down for this."
Staring at the castle, he pieces together where he is, based on the map he’d just seen in the dark place.
Dean had brought up the subject of Cas many times to his parents over the course of a year and each time, it worried them more and more. While many child psychologists convinced them that Cas was just an imaginary friend, Dean knew in his heart that Cas was
“Sorry, we’re closed.” He said. He turned around to face the person, to make sure they were leaving, only to realise that it happened to be Claire standing there. Dean wasn’t exactly surprised to see the teenager at his store, even if it wasn’t at the usual time—but he was surprised to see her there so soon. He knew Claire was stubborn, he thought she would of held a grudge for much longer.
Dean has never heard Cas mention that the story was sentimental to him. He turns so that he can face his husband.
Anna walked them through what she had learnt about the large control panel that sat beneath the window. Each button or switch correlated to some form of weaponry, the weaponry that they would use to help them destroy
Castiel approaches slowly, as if Dean is a wild animal he’s afraid he’ll scare off. He kneels down before him, his stare never wavering.
It had been half an hour since the store closed and Dean was sweeping, not concentrating in the slightest on what he was doing. It was only when the store bell rang that he snapped out of his thoughts and let out a large sigh.
“Baby…” Dean says, letting the name linger on his tongue. He determines that he likes it. “She looks like Impala, my old horse.”
Hester’s training area gave Castiel a perfect viewpoint of the fortress. The Aether fortress resided on a giant cliff that loomed behind the village. The cliff was so high up, and on its lonesome in the middle of a large chasm, that no being would be able to climb it. It was only those who had wings that were able to reach the fortress with ease. It was why the champion they chose to train had to be a faerie, as they were the only ones able to access it.
Dean first described Aaron as weird after meeting him. He remembered being alone in his dorm room with Cas, unpacking his shit while Aaron went to go get food in the cafeteria. He remembered looking around the room, pointing out the eccentric crap his new roommate had. From the books about Nazi history, the weird model statue on his desk and the bong by his bed. Cas didn’t seem fazed, but he wasn’t usually fazed by much. Dean remembered him sitting by the window as per usual, eyes closed as if he were sleeping.
“They call me Alastair,” he sings, “and my father is the one in that castle with that pretty little prince of yours. My brothers and I have commandeered these fine buildings, ready to help our father use them once he is set free.”
He places his head into his hands, trying to get his flurry of emotions and worries to stop. He digs the palms of his hands into his eyes, wishing he could be back asleep and no longer in this frightening and scary world.
“She’ll be here soon, son.” Zach says and eyes him up and down. “You know my boy,” he slaps Castiel’s back “you should stand up straight with your head up high.”
“This is amazing, man,” he says in awe, holding a giant cup of coffee “This is so detailed and it has measurements and everything.”
A/N Sorry for the agonizingly slow update. Sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes, I proofread it as much as I could. I'm still looking for beta readers if someone is up for that. You can contact me
Dean continues to stare at him for a long moment of silence. Cas is sure that if Dean asks for anything at that moment he won’t be able to say no. “Lisa broke up with me,” Dean speaks first.
“Its destruction took my life, along with many others,” Queen Naomi says gravely, “I was here in this church when it sent an army of monsters my way. Myself and the royal soldiers that stood by me, were no match for their ferocity. Thus, I have remained here this whole time, trapped in a spirit form.”
Dean blinks a few times, processing Cas’ words. He’s spent the last few years with this idea of himself and his inability to meet his soulmate. He’s felt like a failure, an outlier in society. However, what Cas says changes his view. Suddenly, he doesn’t feel alone, he doesn’t feel
Castiel smiled, “Go Dean. Meg and I will not be long. Go and do some teaching. I am sure the soldiers will be far more capable of training than I.”
It was a little past four in the morning, so early even the birds weren’t awake yet. The house and everything around him were silent, the most quiet Dean had ever experienced in the small suburban home. All he could hear was the sound of soft snores from the companion next to him, the one who had kindly let Dean stay in his bed.
It was after Castiel left to go home, his eyes swollen and his cheeks still stained from the tears, Dean knew what he had to do.
He made the resolute decision that he wasn’t going to tell Dean about the initial misunderstanding and the year of fun they could’ve had if Cas hadn’t been such a dumbass. He figured some secrets were better kept hidden.
Dean wasn’t sure why Cas had been so happy for him, considering his friend was the high achieving one. However, it was nice to be appreciated.
“But his magic has been exhausting itself for a hundred years and it is now beginning to fade. I imagine that in about a month’s time, it will be completely gone and we will have no chance at stopping The Empty. And I do not have the capabilities to help in this fight, not anymore. And with the champions gone and Castiel trapped in the castle.”
With one quick pull, he managed to yank his wallet free from his pocket, grabbing out both the rewards card and the credit card. Cas stood off to the side and waited as Dean paid, watching as the poor boy, who couldn’t have been older than twenty, apologised to Dean as overtly as possible. Dean just smiled, waving his hand as if to say: ‘it’s fine’.
With a forced smile, Michael stepped back into the house and shut the door behind him, leaving Dean standing shocked and frustrated on the front step. He now
“Your Highness,” she greeted, again curtseying, “I am sorry to bother you during your time of rest and solitude. But I would like to request, with your permission, if I would be able to speak to Dean privately for a moment.”

“I never credited him for his intelligence, the way he deserved. He made the right choice to send you there. The bath revitalised you, brought you back to life, healthy and new. However, the magic did its job well, far too well, for it also wiped your memories, and made your brain a blank slate.”
Cas was silent for a while, pausing as he took in what Dean said to him. Dean anxiously waited, the hammering in his chest getting faster and faster. For a moment, it looked like Cas was still upset with him. Then, Cas signed three words that made all the tension in Dean’s chest dissipate.
Dean did not feel concerned about her comments and ignored them most of the time. Castiel knew that what disturbed her the most was Dean’s lack of verbal communication. It was not that Dean was unable to talk to others, the conversations that they had together proved that he was perfectly able to do so. However, when Dean was first appointed Castiel’s knight and then was chosen by the sword, the pressure of his duties became too strenuous for him to handle. When they had first met, Dean had not spoken one word to Castiel for the longest time, mainly due to his desire to bottle everything up, but also Castiel’s cold and callous approach to him. When he began to open up to Castiel, he stated that he felt that he should silently bear the burdens of his fate, thus not really speaking unless necessary. In all honesty, Castiel felt proud that he had been able to chip through that layer of Dean and allowed him to feel safe and at ease to talk when they were alone together. Yet, Dean did not speak to most other people, afraid that he may let his fears and worries slip through.
“To think that about a year ago, I was sitting at that bar alone,” Dean whispers to Cas. It feels awkward dancing in front of their family and friends, when each and every one of them has their eyes trained on the two of them. However, he makes an effort to just stare straight at Cas, trying to block out the weight of all the gazes on him.
“What has to be done,” Castiel stated. “When… when he returns… will you give him a message from me?”
Mary smiled. “Well your brother did miss you. I made pumpkin doughnuts with a chocolate topping if you’re hungry. I’m also sure your brother will share his candy with you.”
Dean could tell his mom didn’t agree, but she didn’t argue with him. She just patted him on the shoulder and wandered back inside to continue getting everything ready. Dean, determined with his choice, kept blowing up the balloons and feeling excited for the day’s events. He’d hang out with Cas the next day and everything would be fine.
Cas listened and followed the countdown, beginning at twenty. He formed the numbers with his hands while their guests chanted them loudly in the living room. Cheers erupted when the clock ticked over to midnight, marking the beginning of a new year. While their family and friends wished each other a
Cas gulps, seeming almost frightened of what he is about to say. But he takes a deep breath and begins to loosen his tie. Dean watches, his mouth dry, as Cas rips his tie off and begins to undo the buttons on his shirt.
Above where they were standing was Purgatory Mountain’s fortress. The fortress was quite high up the mountain, not that far from the mountain’s summit. There was a clear path up to the fortress from the landing they were on, but the path was quite steep and required the ability to climb and scale the mountain. This was something that Castiel had no ability in whatsoever, nor something he was wearing the attire for. So Benny decided to update them from where they were standing, telling them both about the fortress’ extensive control panel and weaponry that was far beyond their imagining.
Dean thought as the heater in his office began to rattle and groan for the hundredth time that month. He looked over at it, the rusted ancient thing that had been in that office for at least the past few decades. It was worn out, tired from its many years of use and was beginning to fall apart. Dean had contacted maintenance about getting it fixed but it’d been a few weeks and still nothing. Dean was lucky that it was starting to warm up now it was spring, he had no idea how he would’ve survived without a heater during the winter months.
Dean places his duffle bag down and slowly crosses the room to replace Cas in the chair. Grace seems unfazed, still finishing the remnants of the pumpkin puree in her mouth. Dean scoops up some of it, feeling the weight of Cas’ gaze as he stands behind him. Dean realises that he’s nervous, feeling as if he’s going to fail as a father if he can’t feed his daughter right. However, he begins to do exactly what Cas just showed him. Once Grace has her attention on him, he blows a raspberry that produces another giggle from his daughter. Dean feels himself grin, especially when he hears Cas chuckle from next to him. He then brings the spoon to her and watches as she eats it up without a fuss.
“For what it’s worth, about what you said earlier,” Cas says from the doorway. “I think you being here is the best present either of us could ask for.”
serving coffees. He was serving coffees to the most impatient of people. Shop owners, teachers, parents—all people who needed their daily caffeine fix before a day of errands and work. People huffed and tapped their feet, crossed their arms and narrowed their eyes at Dean. They were an intolerant bunch of people, but they were Dean’s most loyal of customers.
He thinks of Castiel’s best friend, Meg, the one who was killed right here. He thinks about how much she cared and how much Castiel cared for her. He finds himself enraged.
“I am… Well, I was Queen Naomi, the leader and ruler of Grace Island. The last leader of this land.”
When Castiel moved away, he hadn’t even realised how much their tradition would change. Their Friday nights together were no longer held at Cas’ house and Cas was no longer there and instead over five hundred miles away in Colorado. While they still kept up the tradition, it was never
Dean’s eyes practically lit up and he nodded eagerly. Castiel smiled and together, they walked side by side towards the Aether hills.
Cas hummed in response but said nothing more and Dean picked up his pencil slowly. He pretended to keep writing to avoid suspicion, when in reality he was just drawing random scribbles. His heart and mind were racing at a mile a minute as the realisation finally dawned on him and made his blood run cold.
. After Mary had taken an assortment of photographs, she put the camera away and ushered her three boys into the car.
what we’ve had to do to achieve that. Your brother, aunt and cousin all had to sign NDAs. Where is this…
Jess smiles, “Because we would’ve threatened you until you told us anyways. Now shut up, and eat your soggy burger.”
Which is why he’s able to take a leisurely stroll from his LA apartment to his manager’s office only three blocks over. Hell, he’s even able to stop for coffee on the way. He finds it strange how a simple, but slightly different outfit makes him so unrecognisable. A Canaries cap, red ray bans, a Stanford sweatshirt (courtesy of Sam) and ripped denim jeans. Oh, and he couldn’t forget the Converse. Now? He just looks like any other LA douche. No one bats an eye at him. They most certainly don’t think of him as the “enigmatic Dean Smith”.
“I’ll drive you,” Dean says, “plus, we can hang out tomorrow night, or another time. No need to rush Cas, we’ve only got forever.”
He huffed and went back to marking, quietly seething. This had been a sore point for Dean since high school, since Dean began to grow into his own shell and had slowly started to become an independent adult. His parents began to treat him as if he was older by giving him more freedom, more leeway and more responsibility. So did his teachers and the family friends he’d known for years. Everyone accepted the fact that he was growing up, that he was no longer a kid. All except Cas that was.
As the hours ticked by, slowly the night neared its end. All that was left were the Winchesters and the Shurleys. Sam had gone off to bed while the parents sat on the porch, drinking and talking about random conversations Dean and Cas had no interest in. The two graduates instead settled by the pool, a fairly familiar situation to their elementary school graduation. However instead of three cheese muffins and sneaky conversations, they were eating red velvet cake and giggling as their parents drunkenly conversed.
Claire grinned and moved herself over so that she was side by side with Dean. She watched with interest as he showed her how to roll out the dough to the perfect consistency and use the cutters to get the best gingerbread shape. After she rolled out her own ball of dough, the two of them got to work—cutting the dough into tiny shapes: Stars, snowmen and the classic gingerbread man look.
Castiel sometimes thought about what would have happened if he had not let Dean in, if he had decided not to trust him.
“You see, the thing about these entities, about all evil in the world is, they underestimate the good. They don’t realise how intelligent, smart,
“Not exactly, but it’s pretty easy to deduce. They either died of hypothermia in the cold waters, got killed by monsters, killed by Nephilim, killed by a fall. So many reasons as to why they’re gone.” She states.
He wanted suburbia, he wanted all the things he’d read and seen. Friendly neighbours, quiet streets and being able to drive to-and-from work. Maybe taking the “L” helped prevent the increase in fossil fuels, but driving would definitely be an improvement for his overall health and hygiene.
They slowly chipped at each other’s walls. Castiel’s resentfulness and stubbornness. Dean’s fear and repression. After sometime, there came a point where Castiel realised he had never had a friend like Dean and the man was someone he trusted wholeheartedly.
Across the street on the other side of the road there was a bench, where usually the spirit of Mrs. Winnigan sat. Dean and Cas had been introduced to her on Dean’s first week at the campus as a freshman, when the elderly woman realised that Dean was the first person in a long time who was able to see her. Her and Cas started up an unlikely friendship, the two of them having conversations while Dean waited for the bus. It was a lonely life for spirits, when they were stuck on Earth with nowhere to go and no one to talk to. Dean figured it was nice to chat to someone who understood what you were going through. Despite Dean being a companion for Cas for 26 years now – he could never understand what his friend was going through. He’d never faced death.
Cas frowns at him but does as he’s asked. He puts down the book and stands up, walking over to Dean.
When college applications rolled around, Castiel wasn’t worried. He’d known from eighth grade that he wanted to be a teacher, after he had volunteered at Miss Missouri’s for community service. Dean, on the other hand, would always say he had no idea. College applications deadlines passed and Castiel still wasn’t sure if Dean had applied or not.
Cas was shaking his head violently and went to interrupt but Dean shook his hands off and kept going.
Cas watched as Dean processed his words for a few seconds, his eyes shining with so many emotions that Cas was unable to place. His lower lip trembled slightly and his eyes began to water, before he walked forward with determination and pulled Cas into a hug.
He types the code in and the doors open, revealing the same dark corridors and loud echoing distress siren. To Dean, it’s just another day on the job. For Charlie, it’s a nightmare.
The words tumbled out of Castiel’s mouth in a blur, fast-paced words of regret, fear and sadness, laced into incomprehensible sentences. Dean continued to breath harshly, staring up at Castiel, the man beginning to lose the life that once shone brightly inside of him. As Castiel brushed a matted strand of hair away from Dean’s forehead, he felt himself look towards
“How about you go wash your hands and get your aprons on? Maybe you can show me how good you are by helping me make scrambled eggs.”
“I was talking to Charlie earlier this week and… I guess I’m just… I’ve just been waiting for the other shoe to drop, y’know? I was worried we’d get into some blowout fight and you’d want me gone. Charlie didn’t think that’d happen, but I wasn’t so sure. She was obviously right… although, I’m sure you’re pretty pissed right now.”
His father had told him all about the special magic they held, especially their healing powers in particular. This meant they were quite popular among Grace Island citizens, as they were usually plucked and ground to make and sell healing potions. Due to this, the flowers were beginning to go extinct, as many people wanted to use them for their own gain. It was why Castiel never vowed to pluck one, instead hoping that he would find a way to make them grow domestically, in order to create an endless supply.
“Don’t feel as if I am pressuring you,” Dean said, “but when I had nightmares as a child, I would seek out my parents in their bed. There, my mother would wrap me in her arms and hold me close. Somehow, it made all my fears fade away. I know it may sound strange, but if you are feeling fearful, sometimes being close to someone else can help.”
He unlocked his phone and clicked on the voicemail. With a sigh, he lifted his phone to his ear, prepared to listen to Dean spouting some unintelligible nonsense, before he would call Charlie and make sure that both herself and Dean were home safe.
“And Charlie has met them all, they signed the treaties. Today we are here to celebrate a new order amongst our land, leaving the past behind and all of that.”
The cab pulls into Cas’ driveway just after seven, the sky a mixture of purple and blue. He pays his fare and waits until the cab is down the road before he even takes a look at the house. His heart is beginning to speed up in his chest as he takes in the sight of the building before him, the house a reminder that everything right now is actually happening. All of this is
Cas felt as the blood flooded his face which made Dean almost crumble in a laughing fit. He had no idea what he looked like, but he knew that his head must’ve definitely resembled a plump tomato. They stood like that for a few moments, until Cas got his face looking relatively back to normal and Dean was able to calm down. Dean then told Cas to head into the living room so that he could grab dessert.
The inside of the Winchester’s home was as warm and inviting as the outside. The house smelt of peppermint and burnt wood, the scents coming from the fireplace, where the kettle was beginning to boil.
With a relenting sigh, Dean indicated to Claire’s usual spot. She took a hesitant step forward and rested the broom against the wall, before slowly walking to the table and sitting down.
One evening, while Dean accompanied Castiel as he explored, he revealed his distaste for the desert. Castiel had been surprised, considering they had both made many trips to the region and not once had Dean complained. It made him realise at the time that Dean was better at masking than he thought, and he could not help but wonder how much Dean truly kept hidden.
The leader, the mayor, turns out to be a short man named Fergus Crowley, who seems unphased to see them. He leans in his seat, staring at the both of them with a bored state.
Every part of his store was decorated with holiday decorations, from snowman cut-outs to wreaths on all the doors. Tinsel hung off every bannister and counter and a small Christmas tree was put up in the corner of the store—the presents placed under it being gifts for the local homeless shelter Dean frequented with bakery goods. The most important part of the Christmas festivities though? The Christmas themed food.
While he read the book, Dean took small bites of the custard pie, which sat on a plate beside him. He read as he ate, causing crumbs to fall over the pages of the borrowed book.
He’d heard everything back in Chicago, from arguments, to sex, to the occasional self-muttering. His new neighbour lived alone, but Cas didn’t even hear the sound of the television. Maybe this D. Winchester could turn out to be not only a good neighbour, but a good friend.
She knocked on the front door hesitantly. Assuming both Michael and his wife were at work, Claire wasn’t expecting anyone to answer. However, it didn’t take long until she heard footsteps and the sound of the door unlocking. Claire barely had time to react before the door opened wide to reveal Michael Shurley.
Dean was the same, through the use of his combat skills. However, Dean happened to be much more restless than Castiel. He always felt the need to move, rather than stand still. Yet, Dean spent a portion of his job doing just that, in order to be on guard and protect Castiel. He was grateful for it, although he never told Dean this.
And part of him worried that Dean’s voicemail wasn’t truthful, that he drove all the way here, just for Dean to tell him that they were better off as friends, or to cut him out of his life. He knew that was the most unlikely of options, yet he couldn’t help but feel like there was still a chance it could happen.
the right choice to make Cas.” Dean murmurs, giving Castiel’s arm a squeeze. “You know it, I know it, Charlie knows it. Even
He arrived at the restaurant at 7:29 with a minute to spare. He noticed that it was surprisingly quiet for Valentine’s Day. There were no couples sitting out on the terrace… not even one person. Dean was more than confused, since he knew this place was well loved by the locals. With a sigh, he paid the driver and grabbed the flan out, closing the door behind him. Although nervous and ready for his heart to be broken, he surged forward with determination and pushed open the front door.
Cas opened his arms up and Dean fell into them, resting his head on Cas’ shoulder. They stayed like that for a while, only interrupted when Cas heard the sounds of everyone beginning the New Years countdown at the thirty second mark. He informed Dean.
The next customer clears their throat and Dean looks up at them, his customer service smile already ready on his face.
By the time they reach Kansas City, Dean has somehow managed to spill most of his life's story to Charlie. He made no mention of his secret rockstar life, knowing that Pamela would literally have his head on a plate if he were to mention it again without an NDA. However, he still tells Charlie the rest, careful not to mention the details that would expose him. He mentions Cas contacting him through letters, recently discovering that he has a daughter, and his current journey to go and find him. He talks about the weeks he spent with Cas, and vaguely talks about his career in ‘the music industry.’ He talks about his life back home, his parents’ deaths, and how his current career has helped him actually have a financially stable life. How working in music had been his dream since he was a kid.
Dean had sugar cookies his whole life, it wasn’t as if they were uncommon to eat. But that particularly night, standing in the kitchen with the milk and cookies, made one particular memory form in his mind. It may have been the familiarity of the situation, or the fact that he was constantly revisiting his past with Claire—but for some reason, a memory he had long forgotten—returned.
Cas laughed and rolled his eyes, “If I wanted to ‘score points’ with you, I’d tell you about how my dad has exclusive VIP membership to the Field Museum…”
“I am glad to see you arrived here safely, Your Highness.” Hester said, pausing just below the training pillar.
, and his life will become what it once was. A life where he was alone and burdened, with no future in sight.
Dean walks fully into the room, shutting the door behind him and locking it. He then turns and faces Cas again, fully taking the man in. Immediately, he notices the deep circles under Cas’ eyes and the way his hair looks flatter and more disheveled than normal.
Cas grins, a bright gummy smile, before he reaches down and links their hands together. Their hands mould together, warm and steady against each other. He leads Dean down the stairs and out the front door, onto campus. Then it’s Dean’s turn to lead him through the car park towards the Impala, since Cas only catches public transport to and from the university.
“They’re just going to check out one of the rides.” Dean explained. “I thought I'd just show you around, introduce you to the land of childhood fairy tales.”
So growing up, he discovered that there were three things he could count on when the world changed around him. Three consistent and simple things.
It takes him about ten minutes to make it up the path and before he knows it, he is standing in front of another fortress.
“I’m Dean,” he says, “I’m from Vale Village. I’m asking because I know a way to stop the fortress up there from continuing to blare all day and all night. I know a way to reset it back to normal.”
Thoughts upon thoughts ran through Dean’s mind about what this all meant. It meant that those daydreams he had always dreamt up, the ones that spiralled out of control into endless impossible futures… weren’t so impossible after all. That all this time, the feelings he thought were never going to be reciprocated… were.
Cas’ voice was gruff and deep. However, warm and inviting—just like Cas had always been. Dean could hear the slight lisp to it, one that formed after not being able to hear your voice most of your life. Yet, his voice was perfect. It was… perfect to Dean.
She looked down at the book, the one where she detailed each thought and dream that had appeared in her mind for the past few days. For now, the island would live in peace, just like it used to. However, this would not be the last time that Grace Island would face this evil.
Eventually, he turned away and ambled back over to where the two of them were standing. Benny was telling Dean a story about an incident at the mines and while Dean clearly looked intrigued by the story, he did not utter a word in reply. If Castiel was being honest, he knew Benny should be grateful for that. When he told Dean stories, the knight was notorious for continuously interrupting with a multitude of questions and comments.
He pulled his hand back cautiously, obviously offended by the lack of reply. Claire looked at Mary pleadingly.
He grabbed his iPod from his side drawer, chucking on his headphones and finding his Metallica playlist. He closed his eyes as the heavy riffs and drum solos played heavily in his ears, attempting to drown out the sound of his own thoughts.
They’d just finished a case in Jackson, Mississippi -- the two brothers along with Cas and Jack. Cas’ combat skills were always helpful on hunts and they figured with the three of them there, it would be good for Jack to tag along and learn on the job. As they prepared to head home, two hunters came across a wendigo case in Orlando and had frantically called the Winchesters for back up.
“Yeah, I’m good,” Dean responds absently, continuing to read the letter from the 21-year-old fan from Portugal. He listens as Pam heads out the door and towards the kitchen on the east end of the floor, leaving Dean alone with his letters.
Cas trailed after Dean, his own pizza abandoned on a napkin. He walked up to Jess who stood off to the side while the brothers had their moment.
“The Nephlims are almost ready to be put in battle and defend the castle,” the Queen continued on, “from what you and the champions have stated, the fortresses are ready and up to standard. Your knight here is well prepared to play his part. Everyone has their roles. Everyone has trained and is ready to play their roles. Everyone, except for you Castiel.”
Dean went on serving customers for the next five minutes, until the line in front of him cleared up. It was then he prepared Claire’s order, which didn’t take long. He sighed and mustered up the courage to approach the teenager, who did not look pleased to be there. Dean could relate to that as upon hearing Jody’s request, Dean had been quite reluctant to accept.
Castiel almost let out a groan, confused as to how the man in front of him could climb up the mountain with so much effervescence. However, he knew that despite Benny being a friendly and blithe man, that complaining while out on a royal duty was considered improper. He glanced back over at Dean and found he was already looking at him. His friend smirked slightly, and Castiel instantly knew that Dean had read him like a book.
“Our beloved Kevin Tran, we bring you gifts from life into death. Commune with us, Kevin Tran, and move among us.”
Dean helped his mom bake through the morning and got the snacks and the backyard ready for the afternoon. His mother came out to put trays of treats on the backyard table, before sitting down next to him.
The camps are everywhere -- every few minutes they come across one. While Dean does most of the fighting, Elizabeth and Charlie join in too. Dean watches Charlie decapitate her first vampire and the look of pure joy that lights up her face.
He forces himself to turn his attention back to Cas, who is still standing there dumbfounded. Dean feels a shaky smile form on his face, his lips wobbling as all the emotions he’s feeling suddenly bubble to the surface.
“You’re welcome Dean.” Cas replies, tilting his head back so that he can down the last of his scotch. Dean feels his throat run dry.
“But at least Gilda is nice. And beautiful. And smart. And oh my goodness, she can fly! Dean, you should’ve seen what she did while you were in the fortress, it was incredible…”
He leaves the inn the way he found it and packs all the essentials he needs into his satchel. On his way out of the town, he peaks in at Charlie, sleeping soundly in the infirmary.
He then turns away as Grace starts eating, deciding to join Cas out in the foyer. The man is scowling up the stairs as the twins begin to race from their bedroom, practically sprinting down the stairs before the man gets to three. Tamsin is first as always, standing at the bottom of the stairs right in front of her fathers with a big smile on her face. Tommy is a second behind her, almost crashing into all of them as he leaps off the last step.
“You are to take Sir Dean to the bath in the Resurrection Bunker, upon the Hill of Life. There, you are to remove him of all his clothing, excluding his undergarments. You will wash his clothes and leave them to dry nearby. Then, you are to leave him there… and not go back.”
When the doors open on Level 8, Dean hops off and takes an immediate left. The hallway is eerily silent, the only sound being the soles of Dean’s shoes on the hardwood floors. Dean isn’t surprised, considering most of the rooms on the 8th floor are primarily meeting rooms. The only office on the entire floor sits at the far west end, and it’s occupant is a silent worker. Contrary to popular belief, considering that they’re known to most as brash and eccentric.
