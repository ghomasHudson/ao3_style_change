“I can see a puncture wound just above his spine.” T’challa observed.
“Yep.”
Steve knew from the moment that he’d met the officer that she was as hard as nails, and certainly knew right from wrong. She knew that they were innocent, as did the others. It was a relief not to be chased by the people he’d been learning to trust these last few days.
“I wasn’t sure it’d work, but it has, so now I know how to do it,” he brushed away the bead of sweat that was just by his temple with his forearm casually.
There was a small pause between words that worried Steve. “Not entirely…” Tony trailed off, “like I said, I enjoy building things so I like working on myself, just off the record, between you and me since you seem like a swell guy so far. I mean by this point I woulda had at least one guy yelling at me for doing something or other.”
Steve couldn’t talk anyway, not when he was too busy trying to run from Tony, who came zooming in from around the corner relentlessly firing his repulsors. He had no choice but to fight him, his eyes performing an ever so quick sweep of the room first before dashing to one side and ensuring that his shield was in front of him, covering him as a powerful cyan beam was shot his way. Steve was playing a game of duck and dodge since he knew for a fact Tony would snap out of it inevitably.
“Sorry sir, Fury’s orders.”
Gently he tried to stun her, but her writhing in his large arms made things far more difficult than they should’ve been.
“I know, I know…” His eyes fell to his hands fiddling nervously in his lap. “I just want to do a good job.”
“Listen, pal, cyborg-thing, whatever you are…”
The huge doors opened with the loudest of creaks and the room was bathed in an emerald light, the same green that was Victor’s signature colour. At least by then Tony knew that he was on the right path.
“Yeah…” Tony’s jaw clenched, “I’d rather not talk about it.”
Tony snarled and shot his repulsor toward Steve, unable to balance after it but finding footing once he was leaned against a wall behind him.
“You know where we’re going, chums? We’re going to get as far away from here as we can. I’m glad Tony will keep you busy; I think it’ll be a bitter sweet death actually, for the both of you. While you’re here I’ve had bombs planted all over the city, including right there.” His arm swung out and gestured toward the factory. “Distractions are easy, huh. We managed to use all these guys, all these villains as our pawns to separate you all, and now you’re all going to fall one by one. Enjoy, it’s been a…
his elbow slamming down on both of Steve’s knees and how it felt for them to break under his power.
“-A dead man’s switch, correct.”
“What are you two supposed to be, the skull brothers?” Tony remarked, the bitter memories of both of them not helping their case. But it seemed now they needed him, and this was their strange way of asking for help.
The tear rolled down his cheek onto Steve’s, reaching his hand up to clutch the side of his face, shaking with emotion. His body trembled but still he didn’t move he just needed this more than anything else in the world; he needed Steve.
That permission couldn’t have come sooner, pushing him right to the edge, and with one final roll of his hips he climaxed with a long drawn moan, completely breathless and exhausted. Steve took that as his cue and once he felt his own tip go as far as it could, as deeply inside Tony as possible, he released. Tony’s body jolted forward quickly to the filling sensation and he moaned from the back of his throat, keeping his lips occupied by placing a series of butterfly kisses along Steve’s strong, square jaw. He appreciated every inch he could; caressing his skin and feeling Steve do the same to him.
“I’m goin’ after Stane. He’s the jerk that paid to get this chip in me. They said it’d prevent the damage from the gas of all those bombs but they just lied… ” Crossbones growled as Masters finished working on his chip.
Luckily the curtains weren’t drawn, which probably meant that Steve left while it was still dark outside. At least they’d managed to spend one night together, even if it meant that Steve walked off shortly after their night of passion.
Tony huffed and corrected his hat, glancing over at Steve. There was no way that Steve could blame those big blues staring back at him, sure, it was like dealing with a child so far… a child with about a dozen gadgets, but Tony was just trying to help and Steve could clearly see that.
“Handy dandy torchlight!” he replied.
“Steve!” Tony yelled. “Steve, snap out of it, what’s wrong?” He asked with a slur of fatigue. He used extremis to command his bots to start repairing the screen while he was there, knowing for well that he couldn’t risk spreading the contagion that was infecting Steve in such a dramatic way.
Hank then took a moment to reply, his nails tugging at a tuft of blue fur from his chin. “Now we find a cure, perform a couple of MRI’s and so on, so forth.”
“What’s the matter?”
Steve brushed the blood away from the cherry red lips that had lost their colour, swallowing thickly.
“If you have a problem, you’re more than welcome to protest. I’m not an evil man. In fact, I’m rather fair.” Tony shrugged.
His sight went straight to Steve the second he cracked open the door. The man sat, wearing his black turtleneck and jeans. He’d wrapped up warm and snug whilst sitting at his desk, sketching while he took a bite out of a piece of chicken. There was a pile of chicken bones on a plate off to the side, away from Steve’s artwork.
we were doing the right thing. We were
“Maybe I am.”
“Take a left!”
After the struggle to get to his feet he heard his back crack, straightening up as much as he could and brushing away a trickle of blood that was dripping from the back of his head down his neck. When he hit the ground, he hit it so hard he was sure a couple of his teeth were knocked out in the process.
“You can trust me Tony,” Steve said. “Your secret’s safe.”
Fury clenched his teeth, his voice becoming more of a stern mutter, “And I’d like to extend a formal apology to Tony Stark… Who if not for his… Smarts-- ”
Tony leaned in, flexing his shoulders back, armour shifting accordingly as a few tendrils reached up, sparling up his arm and rubbed against the surface of the mirror as though his lust was commanding him to lurch closer. “You’re a smug son of a gun.” He whispered.
The genius took that consent to analyse Steve’s arm and suit and see how the power regulation system was there, squinting at particular notches and wires but of course, he was a quick study. Crouching down over what he could, he compared it to his own system and with a lot of work had finally managed to get his reactor technology fully compatible with the new augmentations. Steve pushed himself up and watched Tony carefully, though it pained him that he had a giant gap in his memory. Whilst Tony was working on the suit he looked at his own hands, then at his legs. A pang rang through his heart, a dull ache in his chest as he felt it slump. What had he become? What had he turned into? The night before he didn’t have much time to linger within the thoughts that ran through his mind, with Tony quick to comfort him and ease his pain, but now he couldn’t help but dwell on the fact that he was missing large parts of his body. Not only that but he was now missing a huge chunk of his memory. He didn’t have time to dwell, not when he needed to know what was going on.
“Holy smokes…” Steve muttered whilst Tony rested his arm on Steve’s shoulder, clutching him for support.
“You’re Howard’s son!” Steve exclaimed.
Their pace picked up and they began to run, the helicopters gliding over but as soon as they did the two ran to a wall and sidled along it. It was an unspoken routine, and even with the memory lapse Steve knew that any form of spotlight was something to clearly avoid.
… You know that, I shouldn’t have to reiterate. It’s re-writing
She fell to the side and struggled, tussling with the white fluid with that seemed to trap her, even with her immense strength.
Tony’s evasiveness roused his curiosity only further. He moved his legs, but struggled, making a small groan while his leg arched up, knee in the air. His kneecap caught the light of a small distant ember that still remained alight, shrouded and protected by what remained of the building and he squinted.
“Right now…”
“S-steve…” Tony muttered through clenched teeth. Steve could see it on his face, the way that he tried to fight, the miniscule trembles in his face whenever he moved. It was just a case of freeing Tony again just like he had done before. Steve had faith in him.
“Captain America and you need to step away from the bank vault.” Steve said, taking cautious footsteps past the broken glass from the shattered window, hearing the tiny shards crunch underneath his bright red boot.
The car’s engine revved loudly, the tires spinning so quickly that a cloud formed behind them as it roared into life, front wheels lifting off the ground before it sped off into the distance. Steve clutched onto the dashboard while the car reared like a horse, yelping with surprise before it zoomed down the highway.
He wasn’t going to lie, he loved when Steve paid attention to him like that, and adored when Steve wanted to learn more about him. It seemed as though sometimes that he knew the ins and outs of Steve, and was far more interested in him than Steve was in him, but it was the moments like this that became more frequent as of recent that would prove to him that Steve was learning more about him too, as guarded as he saw himself as.
Nick took one last glance over his shoulder at the screens, the much happier man and his best friend, going about their day as if nothing had ever changed. He was living the world that he could have only dreamed of, and it was truly beautiful. A world at peace.
One night he walked down the hallways of the Avengers mansion, which he had grown so accustomed to over the years that he had spent there, working alongside his team and building great working relationships. Of course he spent a long time mourning the loss of his loves, particularly Peggy, how could he forget her? But he was being told to move on, for his own health and to heal his heart but nothing; nobody could replace the hole that Peggy had made. His love would go on forever, but there was no one who interested him in the slightest, all but one. There was one person who had held him in such high regard, someone who had looked after him, cared for him, hell, even fought with him ever since he had awoken. Throughout everything though, Steve couldn’t help but fall for this man as wrong as it was to even crush on another man. But the thing was, Steve had such immense respect for him, adoration beyond words or actions. But there was no way in the world his feelings would be returned. The man was a playboy, a rich guy who could have any woman with a simple click of his fingers. Besides, Steve’s pride would never let him confess he actually held a torch for this guy, not when he was so content with having him there at his side as his friend.
He suited up straight away in his anti-contamination suit, priding himself on how great it looked compared to the biohazard suits the others would enter the room in. Carefully the armour locked into place, clicking and sliding until it was all secure. The faceplate was the final piece to slip on over the shell of the helmet, making a loud clank as it firmly secured itself over Tony’s tired eyes. Within moments he could see through the tinted lenses; they added a cyan hue to everything that he could see. Stepping through the first chamber and then into the main room, he finally stepped up to Steve. This wasn’t the first time he had walked in to examine him, of course he was there with the others. Although the first attack haunted his mind he reminded himself time and time again that now that Steve was sedated he couldn’t move, he wasn’t awake, he was barely conscious – he was comatose.
“You need to stop this nonsense.” Tony said, gritting his teeth slightly as he pulled away, giving Steve a glare which hurt him, it caused his wings to fold around him even more.
Tony groaned, his body ached, but none of that mattered. All of the pain seemed to fizzle away under the sensual touches.
So there he was, walking down the street with his paper in his hand when a car zoomed by, horning loudly at a passer-by that stepped into the road. The angry pedestrian smacked the bonnet of the car; the calamity was starting to cause a row. But the loud bang on the cast-iron car made him jump, the hollow drumming ringing through his ears as he stood, staring at the near-collision with wide eyes.
The admission made Steve’s heart melt and, instinctively, he pulled Tony closer while they stepped in tandem through the empty and barren streets. “And what about those comics you risked your life for?”
Tony stared with anticipation, trying not to remain fixated on the man. “You think about it, and I’ll be just out there when you’re ready.”
Tony couldn’t help but stare at Steve’s muscular body. No one in their right mind wouldn’t take the time to appreciate such an Adonis, standing there right in front of him, bare and exposed to the world. Tony’s mind wondered deep into his fantasies, shaking his head before scooting closer to Steve after he’d put on the gym shorts and t-shirt.
“Steve?” he called out again, turning from side-to-side to see nothing but the mess of rubble that he was standing on. He took a few more paces. “Cap!”
“Now, if you’re done, boys…”
He could feel himself puffing his chest out, shutting his eyes for a second but then snapping out of it, resuming his cool demeanour.
Tony’s cyan lit gauntlet faced MODOK and shook his head. “Where is Victor?”
“What’s that?” Ben asked.
Reed tilted his head. “What do you mean?”
“You ready to pry those doors open, Cap?” Tony called as he hovered over the entrance.
ever so kindly gifted him with the ability to see once more…but the moment he’d been struck, Tony had known Matt Murdock was a lost cause.
The boy didn’t answer, he just continued playing.
“Farewell Captain America, send my regards to the cosmonauts.” He cackled maniacally.
The way he moved was something that Tony couldn’t get out of his head, the way he stared with eyes that looked so dark set. Whenever Steve snapped and chattered his teeth, making deep guttural groans from the back of his throat, Tony would back away from the screen. For a man who couldn’t get his eyes off Steve at the start, now it hurt even more to turn his head and take that passing glance at the shadow of the man.
The reactor was still working. Barely.
“No need to say it, Tony,” she growled back, flipping back her long black hair and standing in another stance as she quickly switched targets, alternating once Carol had gotten to her feet too. By this point blood streamed down both of their faces, their uniforms torn and tattered, but Tony had the utmost confidence in their ability even though he knew that they were weakened in their current state; having taken a torrent of abuse from those things and both having had an amateur surgery performed on them. But Tony was glad they were holding strong.
“Where the hell are the rest of my god damn team, Fury?!”
“Thanks, JARVIS!” Steve replied to it enthusiastically, always awed by how observant the little bot was. Tony was beaming with pride yet again that one of his creations had saved them. Carefully they tiptoed over it, and Steve turned around to pick JARVIS up so that his wheels wouldn’t trigger off the alarm.
The faster Steve’s hand moved the closer Tony felt to the brink, his palms gripping tightly on the man’s chest, his nails trailing down the cold steel to make a screech but ensuring he made marks, wanting to possess him as he’d wanted to do for so long.
“Why’s that?”
“Bucky! Just come to me, take my hand, we gotta let this go!” He pleaded, reaching his hand out to the boy, feeling his legs sliding down the metal panels, typical Hydra and their poorly built planes.
“Now that Hammer is out of the way, that’s just one less annoyance for me to deal with…”
The sheen of metal was what Steve got a glimpse of, before leaning closer to it, his second leg rising and arching just like the first. Aghast, his pupils constricted.
“This isn’t going to be easy, is it?” Tony whispered, away from the microphone.
“The two bounty hunters?” Clint asked.
“What virus?”
“Oh don’t be so old fashioned.”
Tony could hear a whisper from behind the glass, heaving himself up and staring at Steve, watching his lips move to utter those very words over and over.
“N-Natasha and Bucky’s serum..?”
“I’m totally going to help you take him down, even if it is over your turf. He’s down in Brooklyn…” Tony said. “I’ve still got a little score to settle with him.” Taskmaster once worked under Sunset, Tony’s vicious ex-girlfriend. That and Tony would never turn down the chance to work alongside Cap. Seeing him fight was like watching a professional ballet; he was so co-ordinated and always fought with so much poise and grace. Not to mention he looked pretty darn good in those tight blue pants of his that were obviously one size too small, but Tony wasn’t going to complain not when it was so easy on the eyes.
“Yeah, and your armour was easier to draw.”
should tell the Serpent Society that they need to stop, maybe they’ll politely oblige.”  Jan joked.
“Tony.” There it was, that stern voice that would make Tony clear his throat and straighten his posture in a snap, but instead of straightening himself up he just leaned closer to Steve and pouted.
He had a foul taste in his mouth. It certainly wasn’t because of the bourbon that he had uncorked when he was talking to Matt – no, this was the taste of betrayal, of wholly ungrateful mortals trying to oppose his will.  He was being hunted as though he were common vermin by the others. Steve was an old man, ever trying to be the voice of justice and reason and Tony was sick of it. It was his opinion that bitterness and a heavy grudge dictated Steve’s reasoning these days. He hated to say that when he was battling Steve and Steve’s ‘son’ (Zola’s creation), he could actually feel his heart aching. The moment he fired his repulsors at Steve and watched him fly back, even with that armour on, he could see the agony in the old man’s face. A man he’d once considered his hero was now openly opposing him, and it certainly wasn’t the first time that had happened; throughout Civil War Tony aimed to do nothing but help the world. He wanted to help his friends and create a better world for the future by writing up a legislation that he genuinely thought would help others, but in the end brought about nothing but trouble. Then there was the recent fight, where Tony had to give Stephen Strange the consenting nod, after Steve disagreed with their approach to the incursions, to wipe his mind of every single day he had spent working alongside the Illuminati. Of course the past had an awful way of creeping up on him, and sooner or later Steve’s memories returned only for Tony to suffer for his lies and ‘betrayal’ by receiving a solid wallop in the jaw from the Captain, and then a torrent of yelling and shouting. Each time they had fought it had torn at his heart even more. He just wanted them to get along, he wanted Steve (the man that he had loved for so long) to finally see that he was doing the right thing, that he was going to make the world safer and that he would do everything in his path to create the ideal world. But Steve refused to see anything from Tony’s perspective. Their constant arguments and bickering, from small scale domestics to larger quarrels that involved other team members  had broken and worn him down until he was a beaten man just goading Steve during their last fight, lying and saying that he would ‘do it again’. That was Tony’s lowest point, a point where he had become a glutton for punishment. But every phoenix had a point where they would burn out, and this, the new rebirth of the old Tony Stark with his superior armour was his comeuppance.
do the thinking, Rogers! You drive!”
The little hologram on the table showed them presenting the idea to a committee and receiving a round of applause, the image suddenly changing to a beautiful young looking girl which Tony stared ever so fondly at.
“I asked you, god dammit, and you didn’t listen!” Tony yelled his brow pinched with instant regret.
The blank eyed woman grabbed Jessica’s hand the moment she threw a punch the man intercepted and grabbed her fist in his bear claw of a hand and crushed it. She screamed in agony the moment that the metal snapped, the fizzing of circuits short-circuiting ringing through her ears.
“What’s that?”  He asked, gesturing to the monitors. There was far too much scientific jargon for even him to comprehend.
“You don’t mind if I borrow your medi-scanner do you? I’m in extreme need of preventing my hypochondriac of a wife from taking our children to the hospital whenever they get so much as a cough.” Reed spoke, though exaggerating in this case to a large degree.
There they were, outside in the rain, fighting, drenched already with Steve partially covered in mud. The weight only dragged his already fatigued moves, but currently he was completely still, completely in shock. The nerves in his leg felt raw and exposed, a huge amount of pain in his lower body as he attempted to move his legs, his elbows now digging into the ground, his shield having been knocked miles away when he and Tony were brawling on the ground. “Tony!” Steve called out pleadingly, his voice shrill from the yell he had just made, his throat still hurting but not nearly as much as the shooting sharp pain in his leg.
“Kitten?” Killgrave pulled a questioning face.
It was these hands that did this – he was the one fighting Steve, he was the one that broke his legs and because of him Steve was unable to move, and this had happened.
“No internet!” Tony gestured frantically, pointing at the symbol on his phone over and over.
“YARH!” MODOK yelled in protest, kicking and flailing before his blaster powered up and pummelled Steve back. Tony gasped loudly and used his boots, flying quickly to catch Steve in his arms, keeping him on his feet just barely.
. His body moved closer to Tony wanting to kiss the lips that passionately called out for him. His tongue licked along Tony’s now dry lips before tilting his head to lick the roof of Tony’s mouth, and the man seized the chance to lock Steve’s lips into a powerful kiss to muffle his own moans that he was extremely embarrassed of. No one had made Tony Stark scream like that.
Tony was going to reply, bundling himself tighter and closer into Steve’s arms, but instead of replying another idea popped into his head, a lightbulb dinged just above him coincidently. He peered upward- nope, that was purely a coincidence, an oddly fitting one.
“Beep- beep- We’ve got a call for help! Not too far from here—a damsel in distress! Down by the park..!” he replied. “Beep beep- send help--!”
“I’ll never get to hear your heart…” Tony whispered.
The room was clear, empty, just with that beeping from the machinery echoing, and the faint buzzing from the screens. Tony’s vision sauntered toward them to see the images of what he could only deem to be Steve’s memories. The olden setting, the peaceful atmosphere, it just seemed like a regular day in New York in the 1950’s – not the 40’s. He could get lost in it, it was like watching a TV show where everything was happy go lucky, and was half expecting canned laugher to drum out from the speakers. Snapping himself out of it, he looked around for the medical files, picking one up and skimming through the papers.
Steve blinked, “Save you from what?”
The tall blond woman swallowed thickly. “He can’t be real. Tony died, we all saw it with our own eyes.”
Carol’s heroic nature kicked in and she touched her toes to the ground, her heels following as she began to approach the man. “Sir!”
“You need to get rid of that thing, Tony!”
I’m sorry. For everything.
“Tony, please, just tell me the truth! I’m sick and tired of being lied to and being made to undergo test after test.” Steve pleaded this time, though his voice remained harsh and curt, the inflection and the slope of his eyebrows was much more begging.
“Not just a model plane, it’s the only one left of its kind!” Tony is keen to point out. “You know how much that’s worth? Probably half a grand… Worth it though, he’s my best friend. I can’t wait to see the look on his face.”
With Bucky by his side Steve seemed much better, happier even. So he resumed his routine, this time changing it ever so slightly to accommodate spending time with his friend. A feeling of gratitude befell him, feeling more attached to Bucky than he should have. The kid seemed very curious of Steve’s demeanour, but didn’t question it, which Steve found a little strange but he was just glad his friend was there and by his side again. The dazzling duo was complete again, and had survived the war and was back home, and he really couldn’t ask for more than that.
He felt guilty for having snapped, both of them did. Emotions were high, Tony felt like a ship at sea tilting on harsh tides from side to side. He needed the comfort, he needed his friends and yet he knew the closer they got to him, the more at risk they were until he could fully reclaim the suit as his own. But it always did disturb him that the suit was him, a far more corrupt version of him, be it, but still him.
“He’s become less responsive, more of a recluse. And… He tends to perform a couple of stunts.”
He’d gotten Steve’s muscular chest all to himself, only lit by the light from his reactor, casting a gentle gleam on the powerful features that were before him. Tony’s parted lips and heavy breath made Steve swallow thickly, only tempting him more as he pressed himself forward and caught those very lips with his own. His eyes closed, pressing Tony against the wall, and his own skin up against Tony’s, with no other sounds being heard asides from the muffled music from the living room, the panting of their hard, quick breaths, and the faint chime of Steve’s dog tags rattling up against Tony’s reactor.
“Get off my car!” The strong French accent shouted from the driver’s seat.
It was a usual night and Tony had decided to talk about his latest read with his companion when he heard a loud clatter from the lab, which was somewhat usual, however it was the yelp of agony that followed that caught Steve’s attention. He found himself running into the lab, wishing that the newly fitted retinal scanner would speed up, and then he saw it, Tony was slumped in a corner of the room with his tools scattered around him. Steve couldn’t run up to him quick enough, kneeling down.
Steve’s eyes remained focused, his wings set back as he tried to concentrate. His hand hovered carefully over the wound whilst Tony stared, mesmerised.
“You forget who owns this place, who owns this new world and the entirety of its secrets!”
“It will be done.” T’Challa bowed his head.
“Are you implying that I’m not responsible? You know, you should watch who you’re talking to kiddo,” he jested in return, having missed the banter. It seemed to be a better atmosphere; they seemed to be a little more light-hearted, considering that they were in a broken down hospital. The ex-billionaire gently swivelled his body to rest on the bed, turning the pillow so that it was vertical, just tilted so his cheek was resting on it and reaching up and slipping his helmet off and placing it careful on top of the machine that was next to him. His armoured arm reached around the pillow and hugged it to his body, shutting his eyes. It was a relief to be on a bed again, to get some rest whilst his arc reactor powered up with the new cells in the places that were draining the most power.
The most he could hear was the scuttling of rats, pointing his lights in their direction to confirm his suspicion, and thankfully seeing the tips of their tails as they raced by, some escaping through the newly opened door.
“I did. I don’t sleep much.” He walked a little inside, the small padding of Tony’s fluffy slippers with his initials on them catching Steve’s ear. “So I work. And it appears you don’t sleep either.” With good reason, and Tony understood that first hand. There was a reason that he always had trouble sleeping, and sometimes it was the constant threat of bad guys trying to kill him in his sleep, and others it was night terrors from when he was taken hostage and forced to build a device to keep himself alive, and the constant torture he had gone through during the interrogation and capture process.
Steve lurked around the mansion, going from room to room to establish the situation. It wasn’t laundry day, no sir. According to his internal calendar laundry day wasn’t until two day’s time, and JARVIS wouldn’t let the sheets leave the mansion, there was a strong system in place.
“Captain America… Come back… Please…” Tony whimpered, cuddling the figure.
“No… No…! NO! BUCKY!!!” Steve screamed as he hit the water, the impact shattering pain throughout his body, disbelief and utter guilt running through his mind. He plunges deeper and deeper into the blue, the salty filter stinging his eyes as they remain wide open, seeing nothing but that explosion, hearing the scream of his best friend resound over and over. He’d never felt so much pain in his entire life, and not because he’d crashed into the water and that he was sinking lower and lower into the perpetual abyss, it was because he had seen his friend scream out, reach his hand to him, but he just couldn’t touch his fingertips, he couldn’t move that inch closer to grab his arm. He couldn’t save him.
for something to come at him as he stared through the crack. It was so dark he could barely see a thing – a purple hue lit the room and doused its surroundings in the same colour. It went against the orange rust that the factory was originally painted in, the dirty colour that was all along the outside of the building until artistic graffiti had been plastered over some of the sides, bringing a strange life to the factory.
“After years of not saying it out loud… This was… Fantastic,” Tony had to whisper, his voice hoarse, the physical toll on his body finally becoming prominent, curling closer for more care. The coolness of the reactor was much appreciated, and Tony pressed his face against it, hearing the hum that was as close as he was going to get to an actual heartbeat, masking the internal drumming, just like his own.
At that moment he didn’t think of holding back, if this was a dream he’d go for it. Steve always was so perfect, and now his mind was creating this illusion that he was an angel. How stupid. But he thought to embrace it while he could, slowly letting his hands move from Steve’s wings to the back of his head, stroking the spikey tufts of hair. Internally he questioned himself, how could this man make him believe in angels in such a short period of time? Probably because he was one. Because all this time he’d done nothing but try and save him and look out for him when no one else did. It was then he realised how better his life had become once this ‘angel’ had fallen in front of him, always answering his calls. Even that very night, Tony was suffering from nightmares and in he walked, accompanied with a golden shine around him like some sort of God. There was a reason that Tony was deeply in love with Steve, and it wasn’t just because of his Greek-God-like looks. It was because he had a heart of pure gold. And there he was hurting him, disbelieving him, making his beautiful wings fade away. No. He couldn’t let that happen. He couldn’t lose this, not when they’d come so far together.
Steve looked down at the man, his head aching and the back of his neck sore, sending surges of pain through his entire body through his spine.
Again, Steve’s feathers turned a pale pink and shuddered as he smiled, observing the relaxed state of the man that lay still on the bed. The gentle rise and fall of his chest made Steve want to loom closer, he urged to feel it. He wanted to feel him. He wanted to hold him again.
“Find Stark. Take that thing down. Simple. …Well, what are you all waiting for? GO!”
He was caught off guard by the sudden spasm in his boots as the power level began to become irregular in his newly fitted boot – more specifically, the augmented leg.
“What did I say earlier about the name thing?” Tony’s eyebrow quirked and he pouted.
The haunting cackle was the last thing he heard before his hearing became fuzzy; a mass of panic began to overwhelm him, none like any other. He pulled back a little from the control pad to grab his head, attempting to stop the vivid ringing. It was the very same ringing that he’d head back when the air raid happened back in London, and to this day it haunted him.  He could remember the shattering of glass, the screams of the people outside and then moments later after that explosion he saw them, their corpses laying still, the life drained out of them. Those haunting memories were attacking him even there, in the midst of battle and crippling him into a state where his entire body fell numb just from the thought.
“Tony!” he yelled.
“You duty is not done. You must retrieve an angel for me.” The voice would bellow from above.
Zola had gotten much smarter since their last encounter and even more merciless. The last time they’d met in his own dimension, Zola had managed to surgically plant himself into Steve’s body, using a large gaping hole in his chest – but that, as Zola had said, was long ago.
“Oh, officer! How can I ever thank you?” She reached over to pluck the ball of fluff from the policeman; it meowed in protest at being tugged away from the warm bosom of the cop but eventually settled back in the safe arms of its owner. Meanwhile Steve’s attention was drawn toward Tony instead of answering the question posed to him. Tony poked his head up from the bushes; how could Steve miss that crooked antenna peeping above the greenery?
“Dinner tonight…? I don’t remember planning a di--” He cut himself off and his eyes widened. His hand scrambled around for the clock and he picked it up, clumsily positioning it in his palm before he stared at the date. “25
Steve fluttered his wings, letting them flap as they curled around Tony again, raising them so a feather brushed along Tony’s cheek – the other side of his face, not the one that he was rubbing with his own cheek.
“I thought it’d be sweet, here’s me trying to be nice.” Tony pouted at the Captain again, jutting out his lower lip until Steve was seated, extending his robotic legs. Tony knelt down, slipping on Steve’s new shoes carefully, being sure not to lodge any of the circuitry. Again, in his mind, it felt as though he were prince charming and Steve was Cinderella. Tony took his time to let his mind sink into the fantasy, eventually glancing up at Steve, who seemingly had a faint (extremely faint) blush over his cheeks, staring down at Tony with the same emotion.
“We were taking down Hammer, turns out he’s not alone. He’s got The Purple Man with him…” Tony replied solemnly. “We’re going to take them both down; they’re working on something big.”
He was thrown into a new space, still hidden and surrounded by walls as he stumbled blaringly around to try and catch his footing. One thing’s for sure, he still hadn’t grown entirely used to walking on his new leg attachment.
Obediently following the command he rushed and did the same, the figure looming closer, cackling loudly and throwing the Jack O’ lantern shaped bombs toward the two men. Tony and Steve dived either way of the bomb, with Steve’s heavier legs being much more difficult to move in.
“Steve you know I can handle this, right? It’s just a dinner, I like these things--”
“Well…” Tony mumbled with a heavy sigh accompanying his words. “It’s about time I filled you in.”
It wasn’t about him making Tony feel secure; it was about Tony making him feel secure.
“I’m getting something…” His brow furrowed, lips downturned, tapping his goatee just before he reached to the top of his hat and tapped the centre of it, before tugging out a long silver antenna, grimacing a little whilst he did. Steve stared, absolutely gobsmacked. “Go go Stark communicator…” He whispered so Steve couldn’t hear.
, but the world wasn’t ready for him either. That was at least what Fury was telling himself as justification for keeping Steve locked within the chasms of his memories.  It let him sleep better at night, as if he got a single wink – not when he had the constant threats of the world to deal with and secure, while his top notch weapon rest at bay, recharging until the day that it would be ready to save the world once again. If he ever saw fit to do so. If ever. He wasn’t being selfish in detaining him, he was protecting him.
But that could all be done as soon as they returned to the confines of the hospital; at least then he could do what he wanted with surgical equipment that was lying around rather than a shard of sharp acrylic. He wanted to do everything he could to prevent causing Steve more pain.
The mirror shimmered and a tall, statuesque version of Steve took the zombie’s place; as handsome as ever, but a cybernetic right arm and a white star enveloped with a red circle around it. Tony stared at him and the harsh expression remained on his face. He regarded the information that flashed up on the computer.  “General America… No, I prefer Captain. Besides, that arm of yours will have to go, sweetheart. My tech
“Are you telling me he doesn’t have a tribute?”
Let me join my father in hell, where I belong.
“What can I say? I’m not good with sharing.”
He tossed the boxers to one side, stripping him of his trousers.
“Sure thing Jarvis.” He said, having become acquainted with the butler from previous visits. “Hey, I do have a question for you though… Who’s this little guy?” He said, picking up the robot that was no bigger than a five year old child. It seemed to kick its legs about, unhappy with being carried.
“That’s ace, and I’m the queen of Sheba. Now back out of here ya flag covered yank.” He gestured with his boomerangs, pointing to the door.
“Yes I am.”
Every single word just went over Tony’s head, not because he misunderstood it, but because he had a single strand of hope that was just about ready to snap. The tips of his index fingers trailed and attempted to smooth out the bags under his eyes, but as soon as the tug stopped they returned, darker than ever under his dark sapphire blues. The cold desperation in his eyes was beginning to shine.
Tony narrowed his eyes, “They’ve done something to you, I know they have. The Steve I knew wouldn’t have done that, and he wouldn’t be working for some evil communist regime.”
Those were words Tony had been dying to hear for years, and he would certainly cherish them for years to come.
“I do but there’s one thing I like about it the most… Asides from your attention to detail.” He gestured to what were supposed to be the turrets.
Tony was squeamish when it came to the sight of his own blood, even after all these years; let alone damaging himself in that way. But he knew it was for his own good, so he carried on, at one point it began to get so painful that he stopped, taking a deep breath and reaching for a small stone to bite on while he continued so that his yelps would be muffled. Sweat dripped down his temple, but was quickly washed away thanks to the rain. Annoyingly the two prominent pokes of hair that would stand up were now matted down to his forehead, heavy and soaked with rain, and meant he had to keep flicking his head, but he’d managed eventually – wiring in the copper wires to his arm and then forcing it up so it slotted into his shoulder perfectly. To get it to fit, he had to remove his chest piece which was done in a press of a button. Luckily it slipped into its compact holding form which was half of a briefcase, as shoddy as that case looked due to all the damage on it, it wasn’t worth keeping when it just collapsed into a poorly formed mess. His armour was destroyed, leaving him more vulnerable than ever. Luckily he had his new arm. This would just have to do.
“What was that?!” Steve asked quickly.
Oh god, how he felt his heart race.
“Your heart is here, and I can feel it…” Steve replied in that strong, confident tone, placing his hand over Tony’s reactor and seeing a tiny spark when the metal hand touched the glowing light.
He gasped, chocolate coloured eyes sparking to life right away with a wide blink. He gasped as he inhaled fumes from the surrounding rubble and smoke and began to cough and hack, his hand reaching over his mouth and covering it. He was strewn out on the ground, on top of something but unable to move his left arm. His shoulder twitched and he tried to move it, but even with all of his strength he couldn’t raise his hand up.
“I’m sorry Tony…” He could hear in the most angelic melody.
As soon as he reached his lab his disassembly line assembled around him to try and pluck pieces of the suit off him, but it was harder than he expected. His eyes lit up, trying to use extremis to disable the suits systems completely which worked a little. The pieces were still being stubborn though, and he could feel wires trying to push up through and into his veins until they were wrenched away, causing his golden under suit to recede, clutching his wrists that still had numerous circular puncture wounds that were seeping with blood.
“Yes, Captain, I am here having rounded up the civilians from the City, we’re just offshore in numerous boats. War Machine has assisted me in evacuating citizens using jets to a nearby heliport, SHIELD are also assisting us using the carrier. What are your whereabouts?”
It was Carol’s turn – she soared out, her hands lighting up as she ploughed through the rest of the oncoming bots, and then took to the sky, zooming straight up toward the lightening rod that was positioned at the top of the building.
Steve chose to ignore his sarcasm; he could see how it must get agitating having someone snap in and out of a trance. “I just, I’m sorry for not being there, Tony, I really am.”
He laughed. Sometimes Steve would say the most naïve things, he guessed that it was all part of his upbringing and the fact that he grew up in a ‘pure era’, considering he was in the war and all. He half expected Steve to be nothing like the comic books when he first woke up. He expected him to have a potty mouth, just like the rest of the army lads. But as always, Steve proved him wrong, and was one of the most mild mannered gentlemen that he had ever met. Shy in some cases, when it came to talking about intimacy, but still a man.
“You really think so?”
“We’ll head back to the mansion, get ourselves fixed up first, and then find the others. There’s only so much we can do with these things.”
He had successfully engineered cybernetic legs – attaching them to Steve. His hands where soaked in blood. Not only had it taken hours to wire, but it took hours to pull up the conviction to cut off Steve’s legs. He had to stop numerous times to turn his head to one side and actually purge his system. He couldn’t believe he had cut Steve like that – replaced parts of him. There the soldier was in a torn uniform from the legs down, with new chrome gleaming enhancements on his legs with splatters of blood. Steve’s boots didn’t fit either – not on the soles of the bot. Tony had stolen the power source from the old drone and used it to allow Steve’s legs to function. He was sure that they would work, and praised Rhodey and Pepper for pushing him to going into military grade augmentations for veterans – having done all of his research beforehand, he was certain that they were functioning. All it involved now was for Steve to wake up.
The sun was shining, the birds were singing and the busy streets were lined with civilians heading to their workplaces on that Monday morning.  The fragrant aromas of caffeine and gasoline wafted through the air while everyone went about their daily commute like clockwork. Despite the constant honking of the horns that signified the regular heartbeat of New York City, it was the perfect day; policeman Steve Rogers couldn’t have possibly asked for a better start to his first morning working in the NYPD.
Batroc pat his chest and grinned, twirling the tips of his moustache once more. “My reputation will continue to expand as I take this to my employer!” He held up a huge emerald that he’d stolen from the bank vault.
“They’re… Really dark, damaged… they look broken.” Steve said as he delivered the sad news, genuinely looking heartbroken.
There it was again, mention of the ominous accident.
Every single calculation flashed through his mind and he wriggled and squirmed to try and find some sort of solution. His chest filled with pain as his reactor faltered and it was then he was struck with the realisation of his impending doom.
“Are you open-minded, in regards to genetic modification?”
“And so are you.” Steve shouted back.
The rage boiled in both Steve and Tony’s chests, for all they had done and for all the pain they had put them through, for their friends and for the home they had lost. They walked,
“Yours?”
“Assemble!” Tony shouted proudly and confidently, waving his cybernetic arm in the air.
Peter held the brick protectively for a moment.
“Exactly.”
There he was, gripping him tightly, arms wrapped around his back and holding him. His angel had returned and once again saved him from the decent to hell before the flames had a chance to kiss his skin.
Tony slowly opened his eyes to look up at him to see the man staring up at the ceiling, his strong square jaw tightened.
“How can I rest assured when that’s on the streets? Good day, sir!” She stomped away, even though it was hard for Steve to take her dramatic switch in gratitude so seriously when she had bits of white foam over her clothes.
“Good, make sure you do,” she instructed, giving the two strict eyes before heading off with Batroc, ready to send him straight to the slammer.
“You mean they didn’t tell you?” Tony craned his neck to get into the car, peering over at Steve who was busy with an entire box of tissues that he’d found in the car, desperately trying to clean himself and his once pristine uniform off.
Another night without sleep, as promised, this was the second day without sleep and his vision was getting a little hazier but thanks to constantly topping himself up with caffeine he was a little more alert than he would’ve been without it. He overlooked the blood formulating meticulously with his eyes returning to Steve every so often, not wanting to tear them away from the man who seemed so saddened by being placed in that room and made to sit there alone. From time to time he would try and speak to him via intercom, but Steve would reply with shortened answers which only made Tony more determined to get him out of there; he couldn’t sit there and watch the beacon of hope fizzle into a broken man.
Once his lips were free he began to speak. “Oh, look, newbie.” He pointed to Steve. “I’m Clint, Clint Barton.”
“Clearly…” Tony grimaced.
“You will, I’m sure, boyscout. There’s no reason to look like you’re next in line for the electric chair.”
“Nightmares again?” Steve asked as he approached with concern, he hated to see Tony so exhausted, but still, he was in shock, seeing the wings trail behind Tony like that.
“Where is he now?” T’challa asked.
The other man bluntly ignored him and began brutally punching the woman in front of him, something that everyone knew the Star Spangled Man would never do, not in a thousand years. For a moment they both stood there in shock as he pulverised their friend, that’s when Peter jumped in and webbed Steve’s arm, yanking it away. Tony took the time to fetch Carol, pulling her into his arms and seeing her broken and beaten, brushing away the bloodied up shrapnel from her face, cobweb cracks over the eye plates. Using his propulsion system in his boots, Tony managed to take to the air, leaping over the giant iron bars of the park and placing Carol down in it before zooming back toward Peter who was being attacked by the other man in the armour.
Steve’s fingers began to take a pace, a steady movement in and out that Tony found rather uncomfortable, his brow pinching and nose crinkling, biting tightly on his lower lip undeterred by Steve’s constant kisses of comfort.  Momentarily the sensation of the cold metal from Steve’s tags touched his chest, cooling him, just for a second.
“Let’s get going.” Steve gestured as he began walking with Tony. “The more time we waste here, the more likely Killgrave is to get the upper-hand, especially if he’s got Hammer helping him.”
“Destroyed?”
“I’ll let you go first when you stop using words like ‘Stinky-town’ as descriptions,” Tony said with a smile as he slowly climbed each inclined rung, eventually reaching the metal plate and pushing it open.
“Right away sir,” the dog replied, barking and then running over to the elevator. Steve’s brows furrowed right away, wondering how on Earth they were going to get a car down into the basement, but lo and behold, moments after querying it in his head, the ceiling above began to open, slots and panels moving out of joint with loud clunks of metal scraping against one another filling the room with noise. Slowly on a platform the smoking heap of a police car began to descend through the hole in the ceiling before the panels slid back into the places they were before and returned to a regular looking ceiling, well, somewhat regular with all the rivets now far more noticeable by Steve’s eyes.
“That’s what she said.”
“Geez, sure is different…” Steve said as he lowered the visor of his navy blue police cap to protect his eyes from the rays that beamed down from the cheerful sun above, barely breaking through the canopy of skyscrapers yet still managing to shine ever so brightly. Brooklyn wasn’t that far away from NYC; actually Steve’s journey was around 45 minutes to get to the other side of the East River via subway. It was a small journey but Manhattan seemed like a different country entirely, which was surreal to say the least; everyone had different accents, they were so preoccupied with themselves, and it just seemed so busy.
Tony shrugged and took his hat off to try and straighten the silver tiny antenna that was poking out of it, hands fiddling around with it. “Basically. You could say that.”
“You’re enjoying this..?” Steve asked, peering up through his long eyelashes, sharp features highlighted by the reactor glow.
He stood by the coffee machine, turning around when he heard the loud greeting that could only be Tony, plodding into the kitchen wearing Steve’s shirt from the night before. Instantly the Captain flushed with an uncontrollable grin.
Together they walked hand in hand, walking away as the mansion, their home, burned to ashes with every step they took away from it. But all that mattered in that moment was that they were
“What? It’s true…” She pouted back at Carol, meeting her eyes with an intense stare. “No one ever lasts more than a week with that guy.”
He heaved the stones to aside, the bigger ones taking their toll on his back. Without his armour to support it, tasks were much more difficult. He couldn’t think about the strain his body was under when Steve was in trouble. He cast his pains and grief aside for the moment while he uncovered most of Steve’s body. He worked upwards and eventually brushed away a few rocks to reveal Steve’s face – he was unconscious, head tilted to one side, resting upon a pillow of grass and mud. The rocks that were on his face had left a few bruises and cuts, but he was lucky he had been in a tiny air pocket. The initial panic subsided after Tony’s hand moved for Steve’s neck and felt a pulse – it was faint, but it still beat ever so softly. His soldier was alive.
“Fight… it!”
Steve hadn’t slept either, much to Tony’s surprise, and yet his body showed no signs of fatigue. It was alarming to say the least but then again Steve’s serum granted him with increased stamina, so that would mean in theory it would’ve taken a lot to get him tired, and keeping in mind that they didn’t have a mission the day that Tony had taken in Steve again for the second scan, perhaps it was just the lack of strain that day that allowed Steve’s body to maintain its strength without needing rest.
After all that time, reassurance was needed.
“Great, because I’m thirsty for a good pint and superhero tears.”  Boomerang snarled back, throwing his weapons to parry the shield away, throwing more toward the men.
Reeds hand stretched over, and he placed one hand on Tony’s shoulder to reassure him. He grasped lightly at the fabric of the work-top that he’d yet to change out of.
His entire body felt numb and he felt helpless, watching the man he loved get ripped from him, just as his old life was; torn away. Steve felt the warmth leave his body, snapping out of his horrible sense of painful nostalgia and scrambling around, still trembling. He got Rhodey on the line.
Steve replied with a simple smile, one that confused Tony, but most of all gave him a sense of ease he hadn’t gotten from his previous partners. It made him smile, warmer than before as he kept his head forward and let Steve take the wheel, driving to their next spot.
“I should head inside, I’m actually feeling tired for once.” Tony remarked, rubbing his red eyes.
Steve was trying hard not to place his face in his hand at Tony’s show of bravado.
Before he knew it he crashed back into Clint, then into the wall.
“So do I,” Steve agreed, pulling his gloves a bit higher up his arm so that there was not a single crease in the bright red fabric.
Tony turned his head over to look at the fallen bot that encased Zola, clicking his tongue and shaking his head. “I can carry his main CPU back home for the others to deal with. To be honest I just want to slam him into the negative zone.”
The bot laughed once more before Tony stepped in wearing one of his spare suits, it was one of his originals, golden stretched material along his arms and legs with a clunky thick looking chest plate and gloves, it certainly didn’t look like any of the other models Steve had seen him wearing or working on, he could even see his bright blue orbs under the eye slits.
The brush of their lips was electrifying; it sent shudders down Tony’s spine, and Steve felt just the same. He needed more, they both needed more.
“Pretty impressive, right?” Tony rummaged the courage to ask.
“Go ahead.” Tony said, stretching his body over Steve’s, feeling his muscles through the torn garb, his fingertips curling around the base of the fabric and looking up to get that stare of consent. With that he lifted the shirt over the man’s arms, being careful not to catch them on the metal hinges that were now in place of his knuckle.
“We need to go before we gather a crowd; last thing I want is this making the headlines. I don’t need negative press in this day and age.”
Well, that had been the case before they began to crumble from within, eroded by conspiracies formed within their ranks and by Namor’s appeal to the Cabal for assistance.  Life was just one big convoluted
“Some good it’s doin’.” Steve gestured to Tony’s neck. “
His mind drifted back to Carol momentarily, knowing that he’d have to go back to see her and tend to her wounds. But she was a fighter, she could withstand a couple of hits. Now his main concern was catching up with Peter.
Steve shut his eyes again, just resting on the man as he carried him, feeling weak and drained still. Now he was in familiar ground, Tony carried on walking, seeming as though he were trekking across a desert in his mind. It seemed like it at least. He was starving and weak, and each step was becoming more and more agonising. But it was worth it, as long as Steve was alive and well in his arms, everything was worth it.
“Steve… The computer…”
Peter’s head rang and there was a moment of distorted imagery, he tilted his head upward to hear the blades of a vastly approaching search helicopter nearing their usually unspotted corner, ripping through the air.
The sleep was absolute. A darkness fell over him as his muscles took that time to recharge.
Tony was about to pin the guy to the wall, palms facing him before the leaper grabbed Tony’s hand once it neared him and threw him into the wall behind him. Tony, with such a strong momentum powering him had no choice but to crash into the wall.
He could feel his lips part as the gentle graze of his touch moved, and willingly his body moved forward, slipping his leg between Steve’s with their powerful locked stares not broken once.
Tony was reading through the files that he had ordered everyone bring to him, skimming each word and taking everything in. This was the man from the comic books, even judging by the brain patterns that were documented, the settings and reactions. Even in his fake world in his mind that he’d been thrown into, he was still a hero, helping old ladies cross the street, paying for someone when they didn’t have enough for their morning coffees. The man had a heart of gold which was something that Tony had admired, but in some senses deemed as nativity. He understood why Fury thought that he wasn’t fit to live in this world and it was even by Tony’s regard, Steve’s ideals were outdated. The people of today wouldn’t react kindly to a lot of his traits nor would they want to be helped. Women were no longer considered damsels in distress- they were powerhouses. If someone dare call Carol a damsel she would probably punch them so hard that they would fly through the stratosphere. But that didn’t mean that Tony didn’t have faith that Steve could adapt. He thought every word on the paper about his PTSD was a horrible excuse to keep him under lock and key, keep him as a relic and restrict him from growing. Tony scowled the more he read, but his line of sight was suddenly distracted by a small movement in the distance.
