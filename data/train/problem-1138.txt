Utterly relaxed.
“Well, yes, of course.”  John was immeasurably pleased.  He had known Sherlock loved Rosie, and now everyone and the courts would as well.
), and something about that transformation woke Sherlock.
“What?”

The conclusion was this:  What they have is what they want.  Each is the other’s Most Important Person.  (Perhaps John is more Milne than he thought.)  So as not to incite competition for the Most Important Person position, John will stop dating and Sherlock won’t start.
His mouth suddenly dry, John licked his lips.  “A brat, are you?”
John drew Sherlock into his arms for a quick kiss and hug before going to get Rosie.  “The salacious parts, no.  But the ‘Sherlock agreed to be mine’ part?  Most definitely.”
“That I love you.”
John wanted to hug Sherlock ferociously.  Wanted ferociously, although hugging ferociously might be fun.  He’d have to see how Sherlock felt about it.
Not the point.
With a blink, Sherlock rebooted.  “Oh, I see.  You mean the one who left Joe for a wife and a baby.  Yes, that makes--”

From the hug, John gently asked,  “Mycroft was right?  You're a virgin?”
They finished the conversation with Jaffa Cakes and an argument over whose turn it was to clean the bathroom.
John looked over at Mike again.  Mike was standing patiently, twinkle in his eye and content smile on his face.
“I’ve only got a few more minutes, so didn’t you start this call with something about a dream?” Molly prompted.
Maybe…
The missing punctuation was very ee cummings, John thought at the time and still thinks today.
Now, Sherlock said, he’d noticed that John was quite “hungry” so he’d decided to practice making chocolate cake for them to enjoy together.  Not every day, Sherlock’s far too busy for that, and anyway, he’d likely get bored with chocolate cake on too frequent a basis, but enough that John could feel sated.
Or, no, that’s not fair, it’s still a good band name if it has the meaning Sherlock gave it.  Just not a band John would be in.  He would watch this theoretical band, sure, just wouldn’t be in it.  Not actually watch the metaphor because that would be awkward but metaphorically watch the theoretical band.  It’s a perfectly fine band!  Just not for John.
“On this, yeah.  I. Am.”  John took a deep, cleansing breath and let it out.  “Bi.”
Putting on his greatcoat, Sherlock replied, “I did. Told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult person to find a flatmate for. Now here he is just after lunch with an old friend, just home from military service in Afghanistan. Wasn’t that difficult a leap.”
“I apologise for misgendering you,” said Sherlock, with a sincerity that warmed John. “I trust this
He had no idea how he’d managed to fall asleep on these uncomfortable buggers on his stag night, except he did.  He’d been thoroughly drunk… and Sherlock had been there.  John had gone, and was prepared to go, through any number of discomforts to be where Sherlock was.
Sherlock continued in a regular voice, “This is Sherlock now.  I was communicating on behalf of young Watson because she has been engaged in activities of an indelicate nature.  Those are almost complete, by the way.  You can tell that I was speaking Watson’s words instead of my own because I never say please.”
“And you also pissed me off to try to distract me from the question of whether you're sure you want a sexual relationship.”
With his
he’d said,
“Yes.  Or we could Skype.  Come to think of it, you probably should expect a Skype call or two from Sherlock and Rosie next week to show off their latest experiments while I’m at the surgery.”
“It’s
The video on John’s laptop froze for a second.  When it started again, Lestrade was rubbing his forehead. “The dream sounds much more interesting,” he said.
“In that case.”  John shuffled to the side of the bed closest to Sherlock and swooped down on him for a quick kiss.  “William Sherlock Scott Holmes, I accept.”
W. Sherlock S. Holmes took a peeled banana out of the refrigerator and fellated it.
The peels had all been tossed into a sparkling clean rubbish bin, which Sherlock immediately whisked away, leaving John to appreciate the sudden clearing of his flat and to sink into his armchair.
Well relaxed.
anything when you’re the hostage.”
“Then I think it is lovely,” she said determinedly.  “You know I enjoy studying the dead so as to help the living, and Sherlock’s never seen a body part he didn’t want to know more about.  Why wouldn’t we be the same with tigers?”
John’s glare must have morphed in some way, because Sherlock sighed.  “Yes, I see, ‘relatively,’ paronomasia not intended.”  Waving his hand, he went on, “It’s all normal, threesomes and age differences and even incest among consenting adults.  Nothing to be concerned about.  Or are you embarrassed about the very pedestrian wish to be elevated without justification to a position of fame, riches, and power?  That’s normal too, and I must say if anyone was to be shoved abruptly into governing a small European nation, you have better skills and character for it than the majority of the populace.  Including my brother.”

Smiling, John reassured her.  “No.”
been the best thing to happen to me.”  He cleared his throat of the lump that had somehow settled there.
It was like strings being cut, like heavy-duty painkillers finally kicking in, and John staggered to the throne and collapsed on Sherlock’s legs.  He melted into position, knees on the ground, temple on Sherlock’s thigh, torso pressed against Sherlock’s calves.
“Pardon?”
The smile that spread across her face was both giddy and triumphant, lighting her up even more incandescently than she’d already been, and John didn’t even have time to breathe before she was swooping down on him, wine-red lips pressing against his.  He closed his eyes, tilted his head, began a caress across her plump lower lip… and then found himself bereft as she pulled back far too soon for his liking.
After the evidence was turned in and statements made to Lestrade and his team, after the adrenaline subsided, after that single hair-on-end breath-held heart-stopped moment when they were destined to fall off the side of a building but didn’t -- they talked.
“You also might find it interesting that he and Sherlock were both tiger keepers.  Like in that show Tiger King.  And they were supposed to collaborate, in order to save this tiger park, but they did it in the most annoying way possible, clashes and snits and some rum accusations from Sherlock.  I ended up being the one to get Sherlock to calm down and see things more reasonably, without past slights and competitions interfering.  Never you mind how I did it, but I did, and realized I need to be doing more of that in real life.
“Don’t downplay, Molly; your help was really valuable.  I didn’t thank you enough before, being rather stuck on myself, so I’m going to, ah, keep thanking you now.”
Mike shushed him.  “That can’t have been all there was to your deduction, Sherlock.  Go on.”
“If it’s not about these sodding robberies and Sherlock sodding Holmes being sodding reasonable for once, then it’s got to be more interesting.”
“You really thought Sherlock was a woman?” Mike asked, indicating the sleek stranger.  “Even picturing him in a dress and makeup, I can’t really see it.”
Turns out he’d said, “Houston,” the city astronauts report their problems to, and was being… reassuring (?) about my lapse in knowledge.  Reassuring, is that what that was?  Even odder than I’d thought!
True about the limp.  John considered his feet for a second, and, uncomfortable, shifted his weight from leg to leg.

There was still some part of him fighting; he’d worked so hard with what he had with Mary, so hard to make it all be enough. “You—”
6 - More than one potential feature of interest within an overall milieu of tedium.  Mycroft’s “crucial for the continued survival of the nation” cases tend to fall in this category.
Walking down the stairs, John was stopped by Sherlock’s hand on his shoulder.  “John!  I just realized I never said it.”
“And what’s wrong with the landline?” Mike asked.
“And so help me God, if you make me go through it again, I will dedicate my life to the art of necromancy so I can bring you back and chain you to the radiator.  There won’t be cases then, oh no, just you, me, takeaway, and horrid telly that I will make you watch constantly as punishment for dying on me twice!”
It was in a little room, just steps from the altar where John would get married to Mary, just moments before John would get married to Mary, that Sherlock Holmes blew his world apart again.
“Your impending nuptials could not in any way be more obvious; no need to say it—oh.” Sherlock dropped his gaze. “It wasn’t an opening step, John, just a question. Obviously the wrong one.  I should’ve asked, does Mary know your safeword?”
Frowning, Sherlock muttered, “There’s always something.”
“Yes?”
Rosie’s bum was in the air; she was crawling under her cot.  John waited to see if she’d get stuck, but she wiggled out of the space just fine on her own.
“Your mum being a tiger in the dream, I think means that that’s who she is to me.”

, in her own rather self-involved way, to help him get out of the doldrums he’d been in since getting back from Afghanistan.
“Ah,” John thought, “a new client.”
John gave Sherlock a stony look. “You’ve watched the show? Why didn’t you join Mrs. H and me when we asked, instead of getting on your high horse about it?”
“What?”  He stood up straight in his surprise.
John sat, and stared, and failed to organize his thoughts in any comprehensible order until finally a question occurred and he shouted across the flat to Sherlock:  “Wait, Baron Chakrabarti?  The Chancellor of the Exchequer is one of your trustees?”
Mood: none or Other
“I was wondering what you did with the rest of the fortnight after you sorted yourself out.”
He greeted her, dropped his bag onto the table to be put away later, and settled himself in his chair, pulling his notebook out to take her details.
John’s anger began to dissipate, replaced by confusion.  “Why would--?”  He took a moment to think -- a moment Sherlock spent fidgeting in the middle of the lounge -- and glowed internally when the answer came to him.  “You think I'm sexy when I'm angry.’’
.  That was the word John had been looking for.  “Thank you.”
“Yes.”

“That’s not adventure,” she scoffed.  “Being held hostage is upsetting but it’s also a bit boring.  You’re not
Which reminded John of what he wanted to say to Sherlock.
Anyway, long story short, the solution to whodunnit all revolved around racing pigeons, an Irish falconer, and a rare Dominican cigar owned by an American from Idaho, which Sherlock assures me is one of the US states, and not, as I’d previously thought, a city.  “It has fewer people than Euston, which is a city,” Sherlock noted, and I was thoroughly confused, Euston being a busy railway station or at a push referring to a village in Sussex which is not in any way, shape, or form a city.  Odd.
“But we have.”  The man looked up from John’s phone, meeting John’s gaze.  And, wow, those were a set of eyes:  pale blue and green, almost glowing.
Mike regarded each of them in turn with a chastising look.  “And?”
Sherlock pushed up, his hands to either side of John’s head, and looked down at John.  “Those are the two important phrases to the solution.”
“An arena,” Sherlock continued, “in which a trans woman would find it extremely difficult if not impossible to express her true self.”
“You were kidnapped.”
Nope, distance was the wrong idea.  John stepped to Sherlock’s chair, pulled the man up, and wrapped him in a hug that John hoped was as tender and protective as he was now feeling.
“Oh, yes!  I had a strange dream last night and you were in it.”
It was then that Sherlock stuck his head into John’s bedroom and said, “Is the intercourse over? Lestrade just texted with a halfway decent case.”
Lestrade’s eyes widened.  “The bloke with no legs?”
On the crime scene, he found Ash #157 (or whatever), and these bits of white that looked like thistledown, and boom, we were off to Peterborough to the office of BOU, tracking down the head bird person, who of course doesn’t work out of the office because she’s also CEO of the BTO NGO, ho ho ho.  Then we’re on the train to Cambridge and Sherlock’s got her on Facetime, and the signal’s going in and out, and her words hardly sound like English at all, but still the two of them seem to be understanding each other.
He couldn’t help noticing that her voice quality was now rougher, a bit of the silkiness gone, but he put that thought away in favor of assuring her that he had plenty of experience -- expertise, even -- just not with a client specifically.
Not something John had experience with, but…  Fine.  John would think about what he thought about that later.
“Oh, it was no trouble!”
John was grateful for the information but confused why it had required him to sit back down.  “That’s what you wanted to talk about?”
He decides to stop being an annoying dick for half a second and I --
“Do you need to be stopped from rooting?” Sherlock asked, but he was only kidding.  His pig would never cause problems like that.
“Ace or sex-avoidant or--”
John nodded.  He’d rather hoped that would be Sherlock’s response, as option one was only just barely fine for John.  “OK, option two.  We go on as we have been, and figure out a way to re-configure the flat to make it a three-bedroom.  I’m not quite sure how we do it, but maybe there’s attic space we don’t know about?  We’d have to talk to Mrs. Hudson and it’s going to be expensive.”
He woke to an arm wrapped round his midsection and a voice bitching about the inferiority of the sheets relative to those in Sherlock’s bedroom.
“We’ve established you’re a male soldier who’s been invalided home from Afghanistan. I also know you’re a doctor, and that you’ve got a brother who’s worried about you but you won’t go to him for help because you don’t approve of him – possibly because he’s an alcoholic; more likely because he recently walked out on his wife. And I know that your therapist thinks your limp’s psychosomatic – quite correctly, I’m afraid.”
“I suppose I was the, uh, sheriff in Florida?”
“Ah, lovely.”  Having got what he needed, he nodded and shifted back a bit.  “Ta.  Have a nice night.”
“Ah,” replied John.  “That does all point to an excellent shag.  But the feelings and commitment bit before then?”
“Meaning someone will soon die, yes.”  John rolled back and tugged Sherlock to lie on his chest.  “And I'll die if I hurt you again, so that works.”
“Ah.  To begin with, a mid-30s soldier newly invalided from a war zone walks into a lesbian bar in a suit cut for a woman, wearing inexpertly chosen shades of inexpertly applied makeup and an appallingly poorly coordinated wig.”
Rosie cooed and offered John the nurse doll that always reminded him of Mary.  He was loath to take the doll away from her intimate clinch with the Frozen princess, but Rosie moved the pirate doll over, and there was that problem solved.
snakes.  There are very, very few species of poisonous snake.  The difference?  If it bites you and you die, it’s venomous; if you bite it and you die, it’s poisonous.
John was chuffed at the compliment but otherwise still confused.  “How does being unused to wearing women’s things make me a woman, exactly?”
“And given your age and the recruiting patterns of the British military, you’d been in the Army for many years.”
5 - Overall exceptionally boring but with one feature of interest that could keep me from wanting to stab my eye out with a rusty fork.  I take these if there is nothing else I could occupy my time with other than bad telly or Mrs. Hudson talking about herself.
“That was
“Got my eye on a nice little place in central London. Together we ought to be able to afford it.”  He walked toward John and continued, “We’ll meet there tomorrow evening; seven o’clock. Sorry – gotta dash. I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.”  Putting his mobile in his coat, he walked past John toward the door.
John hushed Sherlock with a brief finger to the lips.  “We can talk about history later.  Now, we have some evidence to collect.”
Another shake of Sherlock’s head.  “Not as we have been, as the great detective and his assistant-slash-blogger.  I want us to write up a legal whatever for the work that shows us as full partners.  Equals.”
Sherlock dropped the shock blanket and climbed down from the ambulance.  “I never do anything stupid.”

“Afghanistan, yes.”
“Head— In the kebab place, the night you came back?”
Wow.  That was… interesting.  Wrong, but interesting.
John stood and wiped his hands on his jeans.  “Wish me luck with Joe Exotic.”
“Fine.”  Sherlock just about rolled his eyes and murmured, “Still going to pick option four.”
“No, that was Moriarty.  The nemesis, you see.  You were the Tiger King’s mum.”
(Don’t have to justify this being in third person point of view.  This is my private journal, written for me and me only.  If Sherlock Holmes wants to UTTERLY DISAPPOINT ME by reading these entries, it’s his lookout.)
As Sherlock looked at him, head tilted, eyes intensely focused, the tension tightened, compressing everything inside of John to the size of a single molecule.
“Option three.  We go on as we have been, figure out how to renovate the flat, and…”  This was a big one.
John was drawn up short by that.  “What?  Me?  No!”
In the room’s sudden silence, Sherlock blinked.  “Oh.”
.” The lips between his fingers twitched; John’s lips twitched; and he and Sherlock giggled themselves exhausted.
“I'm not asexual, John.”
,” John insisted, gesturing toward the man, Sherlock.  “His whole…”  Unable to think of the right word, he waved his hands in a vaguely body-shaped pattern. “His whole everything was different.”
When John asked if he should add his own (meagre) funds to the joint (joint! !!!!  !!!!) accounts, Sherlock waved a hand insouciantly and wandered off.
Leaving Sherlock sat at the kitchen table, John retreated to his room for a lie-down, stared at the wall, and eventually fell asleep.
They have had, once more, A Conversation.
“Yep.”
"Well. That. I'm not, but." John cleared his throat, wishing for a glass of water that wasn't going to appear because there was no way he was moving from this spot before they'd worked out everything.  "Have you heard that saying, ‘every straight bloke has occasional gay thoughts’?”  He didn’t wait for Sherlock to respond.  “Well, it turns out that most straight men’s definition of ‘occasional’ is a lot... less... er, frequent than mine.”
Shaking his head, John snorted.  “I’m not.”  Typical Harry, and then to dare him to kiss a woman, knowing he’d likely get kicked out on his arse…  No telling how Clara had been able to put up with her for so long.

, there was the woman John had met in the bar.
“Then don’t,” the bunny interrupted, and John thought for a moment he could hear the woman who’d sent him over here sniggering at him.  The music was too loud for that, and anyway, he was the sun, set to warm and beguile.
“I’ll also inform you that I play the violin when I’m thinking.  Flatmates should know the worst about each other.”

“The husband,” interrupted John.
“Ella.”

“Woman?”  John paused, took a breath, and waited for Molly to exit the lab.  “OK, let’s start from the beginning here.”
“Yeah, you’re right.”  John smiled.  “My genius.”
“No, no, you’re right; I should be out there and will be soon.  Rosie had a fever just under a fortnight ago, so I’ve had to quarantine here for the safety of the patients at my surgery.”
John couldn’t stop a chuckle from rising up.  “
“I had the weirdest dream last night,” John said first thing in the morning, stretching to get a few sleep kinks out.
John walked into the flat, after having been to the shops, to find a stunningly fit young woman in her mid- to late-twenties sitting on his sofa.  She greeted him with a beautiful smile and said that Sherlock had had to go out but asked her to wait here for John.
“Well, yes,” John repeated.  He kissed the rabbit’s arm and passed it back to Rosie, who gave it a great, wet, smacking kiss -- more on the shoulder than arm, right where John’s scar was, interestingly -- and then threw it aside in favor of a different doll.
John wants to tell her that, explain, but she’s never liked poetry and prose won’t suit.
“Plus it will confuse the parents on the playground to hear Rosie call me Ella, and perhaps shake them out of their cishet stupor.”
When John Watson woke in the morning, refreshed and thinking of a fry-up to celebrate the successful solving of the cigar-falcolner-pigeons case of the day before (possible titles:  “When Irish Idahos Are Smiling” or “Euston, We No Longer Have a Problem”), Sherlock Holmes had already vacated the flat.
“When it involves vigorous activity or shooting your gun off, you are exceptional.”  Sherlock grabbed John’s hand and pulled him up the stairs.
7 - The bare minimum of acceptable case.
He was to find out later in the evening that the young people were from Sherlock’s homeless network, brought in to peel the bananas in exchange for, well, the peeled bananas.  Sherlock had purchased the fruit not for consumption by himself or his flatmate, but for some kind of experiment with dozens of banana peels and, you guessed it, boric acid.

“You adopt Rosie.”
John cleared his throat.  He hadn’t meant to tell Molly that he had a plan, for two reasons.  One, it was more of a hope than a plan, and two, things had been a bit awkward on certain subjects since the forced “I love you” exchange between Molly and Sherlock.  She seemed to have taken Sherlock’s subsequent explanation and apology gracefully, and the two of them had stayed good friends, but John could easily imagine the embarrassment the incident had caused her.

Rosie made her current stuffie, a weird unnameable creature, high-five him.  John laughed; Rosie went back to playing.
Not that John’s worried.

“Kiss boo-boo,” said Rosie.
“I’m still wearing my wedding ring.  Didn’t even move it over to the other hand, like some widowers do.  I’ve been holding onto her as my one great romantic love.  But my dream reminded me of some of these things she did, not as your mum, that… weren’t the best, let’s just say.  And it’s not that I’m some angel; I’m just saying our relationship was up and down.”
“The solution to what?” asked John.
“Not ‘and’ what you are!  ‘And’ the rest of your thought!”
A silence that had an air of skepticism followed, and John laughed.  “Actually, Sherlock’s been great with Rosie.  Helps with absolutely everything.  I was a bit shocked; I thought changing nappies, at least, he’d say is reserved for the one who conceived her.  But nope.  He uses the time to teach her about the digestive system.”
“Ella.  That's what Rosie calls me and I'm quite fond of it.”
, I’m perfect whilst sleeping ha ha).
He’d never wished harder that he did like chocolate cake.
Amused, John added, “And ten seconds,” knowing full well that that wasn’t what Mike was asking about.
“Right.”  John nodded, admittedly chuffed to have a bit of a mission again.
It was, and now that he thought more, it was not quite what he meant.  He wasn’t a stalker, or a jailer, and he wanted to make that clear.  “You can leave the relationship whenever you want, Sherlock.  If I’m not all right, or even if I’m all right but you find something better, you should take it.” At Sherlock’s blink of surprise, John smiled.  “But leave because you
Small likelihood not being no likelihood, John decided at that point to check that it was indeed Sherlock curled next to him.  Visual reconnaissance.  Which meant opening one’s eyes.
Sherlock gently touched John’s chest; John pulled him into a loose hug.  Arms there, but Sherlock could go any time he wanted to.
“Got it.”  John smiled.

“No, no.  I’m in a good stopping place and could do with a breather!” Molly’s smile was apparent in her voice, and John was glad to be catching her at a break time.  Medical professionals needed all the laughs they could get, what with the coronavirus running everyone ragged, and John thought this story might do.
Right.
“In my dream,” John repeated, “I was the husband.”
“The work and I want to make it a threesome.”
“He wasn’t like
“I once thought that she was the best thing that could have possibly happened to me.  It was true, at the time.”  After a kiss to its head, John put the nurse back into the pile of dollies.  “Then not five minutes later your Uncle Sherlock came back from the dead.
“You’re not going to pull with any of the women here tonight.”  She re-crossed her legs, and John couldn’t help watching the slit in her skirt as it moved.  “They’re too involved with their dates or their friends to give a glance at a newcomer, unless she’s… ‘sex on wheels’ is the correct term, I believe.”
“We were in a
Sherlock didn’t look up from where he was inspecting a partly finished experiment as he replied crisply, “Yes.  I choose the last option.”
“Not a tiger.  I mean, she’s your mum.”
Now John was nervous.  He’d thought that would be a definite yes.  Time to save things:  “You don’t have to.  I know it’s asking a lot.  I just thought it might make things easier in--”
“You want us to call ourselves two different things?  I guess that’s fine.  Bit weird, but fine.”
Sherlock did have one requirement:  John was forbidden from trying to convince Sherlock to care about their (their! !!!!  !!!!) money.  “If we need to, what’s that phrase, tighten the belt?, then let me know and I’ll cut back.  But otherwise, our finances are now all you.”
“But you did?  Sort yourself out, I mean?”
“It was a fancy dress party,” John reminded them. He’d had nothing by way of costume pieces, having just been in the Army; Harry’s friends had come up with the idea and then lent him the makeup, wig, and suit.  “I was dressed as David Bowie.”
“Correct.”  Sherlock’s head tilted in acceptance.  “Except, of course, for those times when I don’t talk for days on end.”
Sherlock’s intense stare seemed to be incredulous, but too bloody bad.
“So poor Mrs. Hudson will have Rosie full-time?  I’d offer to help, but we really are quite slammed in the morgue.”
“That sounds lovely, not strange.”
“No, it won’t, both because I’m determined as hell and because I’ve put up a system to make sure it doesn’t happen.”
“Sherlock.”  Mrs. H’s expression was matter-of-fact as she sipped her tea.
“The twenty minutes that was left?  Put Rosie to bed and had a chat with your brother’s minions through the foyer’s camera.”  John was tempted to stand, feeling that pacing might help his nerves, but Sherlock was here, facing him, eye to eye, and this was the moment.  “Life-and-death situations, I can make decisions in a split second, but this?  You know how… difficult I find it.”
When three identical glares trained on him, the timidity of his smile went from completely feigned to partly real, but

had to listen to the bird woman -- she did sound rather hooty like an owl -- complain about the specimen Sherlock had stolen (“Borrowed! It’s going back!”).  I did my best to convey soothing, charming words in her direction, but Sherlock had started up a row with a cab driver who did not want to take us wherever it was Sherlock had us going, so my assistance was needed there.
After dinner that evening, Dr. John H. Watson, took a peeled banana out of the refrigerator and ate it, as a nutritious and tasty treat.
“We already have that as a code,”  Sherlock pointed out.
Sherlock Holmes is a fucking idiot.
John stroked Sherlock’s curls and continued, “I’ve already talked to Lestrade about it.  If I put hands on you in anger ever again, he’s agreed to arrest me, no matter what you say.  If I hurt you to the degree I did ever again, he won’t have to arrest me because Mycroft’s agreed to disappear me.”
“Well?” she asked as John was still sorting through that, and he reported on autopilot, “Three-fourteen and ten seconds.”
John shook his head and twisted his hips, trying to get more comfortable on the stairs up to his flat.  His and Sherlock’s.  And Rosie’s.
Smug git.

“Anyway,” repeated Lestrade, “you said something about a dream?”

“Rosie is going to want her own room eventually.”
“And the reason I walked and talked like a bloke was because I’d always been expected to?”
OK, stop.  Let’s tell this as a proper story.
The sparkly bouncy head boppers on the bartender’s head were completely incongruous with her scowl, but she took John’s money anyway and delivered to him a well-poured pint.  After a pleasing sip of his drink, he turned and leaned back against the bar, tapping his cane against his leg and looking over the crowd once more.

He thought, and considered, and speculated.  Unless Sherlock had let someone else into the room and then buggered off to who-knows-where (I mean, it’s Sherlock; that’s not out of the realm of possibility), then it was most likely Sherlock’s arm and knees and probably-an-erect-dick and general wafting warmth surrounding John.  Which was… not bad.
old and grey,” Sherlock replied with a kiss to John's forehead.
“You?” Sherlock asked skeptically.  “The slag?”
“And crime scene language, too,” Molly reminded him.
“Not truly angry, no.”  As John stalked toward him, Sherlock actually visibly gulped.  “A little perturbed?  Maybe.”
“Who talks a lot; I’ve also figured that out.”
Sherlock hadn’t apologized.
Shirty.  Me.  Hmph.
“Um, no?”
“Well,
“But this one time only, your mum being a tiger and not a person solidified something for me.”
Lestrade glanced to the side, probably at his mobile, and then re-settled in his chair.  “Yeah?”
She invited him to sit next to her on the sofa instead, and ok, not typical, but, well, important to make the client feel comfortable, so he went and sat.
Except the trust.  “I wanted that done today, but according to Mycroft, ‘Something something paperwork something meeting-scheduling something Her Majesty’s approval something.’  I wasn’t entirely listening.  Eventually, you’ll be installed instead of Baron Chakrabarti on the board.  Mycroft tried to claim it was a conflict of interest, but honestly who better than the secondary beneficiary to be a trustee?”
The swift ascent of Sherlock’s eyebrows would have made John giggle if this weren’t so stomach-clenchingly important.
“I believe the term in the vernacular is ‘nosy.’”
Mike finally started introductions.  “It’s an old friend of mine, John Watson.”
“Wager won,” she said; John had no idea what she was talking about.  “Your assistance was, in truth, quite valuable, so um, thank you.”  Looking away from him, across the table, she continued, “Ladies,” and then before he could even throw down his cane to clutch at her waist, set down his pint to cup her head and coax her into bringing her lips back to his, she was gone.

“Whole,” he said one more time, while lightly pinching Sherlock’s lips shut.  “Entire, complete,
“Do you remember your safeword, John?”
.  “Hi,” he repeated.  “Sorry to bother you --”
Nothing was said on the subject of Sherlock having sex, John having decided he didn’t want to know, and Sherlock… well, John doesn’t know what Sherlock was thinking on that topic, because, as mentioned, it wasn’t mentioned.
“That I don't have any.  Prowess.”
“Well, yes,” John said, alarmed.  He pulled the rabbit gently from her hands.  “But we as people should not bite.  You know that, right?  Do not bite.”
“Your what?”  John knew he sounded like a complete idiot, but this person’s sentences were making absolutely no sense.  Dysphoria and a Scottish farm; maybe this was aphasia?  And if so, did the stranger have it, or John?  “Look, we’ve never met, so --”
There followed a lot of grumbling and only a tiny, tiny bit of sniggering and eventually an agreement on both sides to never discuss again that SHERLOCK HOLMES DROOLS IN HIS SLEEP, and also that kipping in the same bed was not all that bad and might even be better on Sherlock’s sybaritically comfortable mattress and bedclothes.
“You talk in your sleep?” was Sherlock’s second attempt; John shook his head.

Nevermind, there’s no milk, because he didn’t do the shopping, he just bought bananas.
When a winged creature swooped down on me (well, fell off a rickety shelf, same thing), I was actually glad I didn’t have my gun at that moment, because the retort and bullet holes would’ve been rather tricky to explain.  Nonetheless, Sherlock found the something he was looking for even before the ornithologist got there, and we were off again.  When Sherlock’s mobile rang, he shoved it in my direction, and
“Let’s,” she said, as John was still marvelling over how soft the skin on her fingers had been, “just talk.”
“John’s appearance,” Mike reminded him.
“And that was?” Sherlock rumbled from just a few inches away, face smashed into his pillow, facing away.
Well.
“What are those?”
The redhead to John’s left was cute, and looked friendly, with a huge smile.  A smile that was now being kissed thoroughly by a woman in a cat costume.
His piece said, John glared at his fucking idiot.

“There was a trial, and a talking tiger named Moran was the judge.  I think Carole-Moriarty was the defendant, but even so, the sentence was that Sherlock was going to be eaten by Moran.  The whole courtroom was hushed in shock, but you threw one of your legs at Moran’s mouth, knocking out his teeth and choking him.  He was taken out of the courtroom on a gurney with your leg still sticking out of his mouth straight up in the air.  The Crown decided somehow that was sufficient reason for Sherlock to be set free.  At the celebration, in Mrs. Hudson’s flat, I apologized for your now-missing leg, and you just pulled a different one out of a bag and put it on.  Then we had a pint.”

“You do know you’re the only person on the planet who’s allowed to call him that, don’t you?  But I was about to tell you that your mum was a tiger too in my dream.  She had bit the arm off one of the zoo workers.”
This was all very… Sherlock, so John shoved down his feelings of chagrin about the dream, smiled at the compliment from his friend, and changed the subject.  “The dream last night was a new one.  It was about--”
After walking past the door, Sherlock leaned back into the room again.  “You also know I look gorgeous dressed as a woman.”  He clicked his tongue and winked.  “The name’s Sherlock Holmes and the address is two two one B Baker Street.”
that to me, Sherlock.  I’m getting married.”
John’s eyes snapped to Sherlock’s even as his body jerked back.  Sherlock’s hands fell away, but his eyes stayed trained on John.
Sherlock was on the edge of his seat, back straight.  “That one.  I pick that one.”
he thought.  He’d get another pint at the bar, and then he’d check the perimeter of the room for any lonely wallflowers who’d be willing to trade a kiss with a guy for the chance to meet a group of lovely, vivacious lesbians.  As Harry’s raucous bray of a laugh hit his ears over the music and chatter, followed by a snort, he amended his characterization of them to only vivacious.  He’d have to get a move on before they slid into just plain rowdy.
Sherlock’s smile lifted his cheeks, shifting the bruise forming under his left eye.  “Possessive of you.”
John stepped back, one step, two, three, as far as he could go in this suddenly stifling room.  “You can’t
“Ugh,” she sighed.  “The attention is rather unfortunate.  I’d hoped to blend in better, but there’s nothing for it.  I’ll just have to kiss you.”
“No!” Sherlock’s look of horror as he sat up was hilarious.  “You can’t do that!  I’m a grown man.  And anyway, you’ll start work again soon, so you wouldn’t be able to monitor me.”
Jaw clenched, John drew himself up to his full height.  “That’s not what it is.”
I’m keeping my own room, though.
Lestrade relaxed.  “Good.  Then tell me all about it.”
“You can’t—”
“Mm, not ‘red.'”
“You’ve only dated women,” Sherlock pointed out.

Mollified, John tucked into his beans and toast.  Mrs. H continued, “So now, before you tell me how your dream went, tell me who I am in it.  There aren’t many ladies to choose from, so I suppose I’m Carole Baskin.”
So.  It turns out sex, for Sherlock, is like chocolate cake.  Not something he typically spends any time thinking about, not something he ever feels compelled to go out and get for himself, but something he quite enjoys if he happens to be offered some at a time when he’s not busy with something else.
, Sherlock had said, but John had thought he’d meant the cases.
, and more importantly, it wasn't with someone that I cared about disappointing.”  Sherlock looked away.  “So sexual prowess is not something I can claim.”
When John looked down, Rosie was chewing on the tag inside the dress of one of her dolls.  She noticed him looking and let out a small “rawr.”  He was tempted to let it all drop, tackle his daughter in a hug, and play dollies and chase and aeroplane for the rest of the morning.
It’s not Sherlock’s fault.  No.
Anyway. Suffice it to say, the rested feeling was novel and John enjoyed wallowing in it, eyes closed, on his back, blissful, with tiny little stretches of this muscle or that from time to time, just because it felt good to wiggle a bit.  It was during one of these stretches that John made two realizations at exactly the same time:  there now was a rod of some kind pressed against the side of his thigh, and there had always been a much larger rod lying across his chest.  Well, probably not a rod, the second one, as it seemed to break apart at the end, given the pressure points.  A limb, with branches?  No, and John’s brain didn’t seem to function well when rested, which was something he’d have to think about when he finished thinking about the
Rosie handed him a book that had been lying behind her,
The woman sighed.  “Did I not mention mere moments ago that I’m attracting too much attention?  I need the information without anyone knowing I have it.  You get me that, and I’ll meet you back by your sister -- she’s the donkey-laugh woman, right? -- and give you one kiss in exchange.”
Sherlock Holmes came home after his unexplained multi-hour absence and immediately thrust a parcel into John’s hands.
John smirked.  He’d thought this one up weeks ago, saving it for a truly egregious transgression.  “All sweets will officially be ‘Rosie only’ foods.”
(Capital A, Capital C, but John isn’t Milne enough to do that twice in a row.)
“Is it time for a cuddle?” he asked.
“Poor little pig has had to do without for so long.”
Then they were standing in John’s bedroom, her hands on his shoulders, his hands toying with the lovely soft straps of her plum-colored lingerie, and he murmured, “This is the first time I’ve done this with a client,” and leaned in for another kiss…  which he did not get, as she had firmly pulled away.
John paused in the middle of sitting down in his armchair to glare at Sherlock.  “And how do you know about that?”
Sherlock’s eyes hardened, and when he spoke, his tone left no room for argument.  “I don’t do relationships, never will, but I promise you will always be mine and I will

won’t preclude us from becoming flatmates.”
Sherlock shook his head.  “Not that one.  Warmly inclusive of trans women but not fans of men of any stripe.  I’m surprised your sister didn’t tell you.”
Meaning…
He didn’t even have to fudge, because now that he could see the watch more clearly, it was a beaut.  “Smiths W10, isn’t it?”
Mrs. Hudson broke into a smile almost as big as John’s when the voice continued.  “Ahem.  Sherlock and I are hungry so please come upstairs soon.  Bring as many sweet things as you can because we like those best.”
amazing.  John would have to be on his toes to keep up.  “My sister bet me, yeah.  She and her friends dragged me here.”

“And you and Sherlock autopsied the tigers together, whenever they’d died.”
“Mycroft will consider renovation a legitimate expense, especially as it involves Rosie’s welfare, and will pay the bills from my trust fund.”
And talk they did, and laughed, and the skin of her cheek was just as soft as her fingers, and her lips even softer, and John asked if she’d like to go to dinner with him, and she whispered that she’d rather he take her to bed.
Several tables away, a tall black woman dressed in punk attire was drop-dead gorgeous, but with an approachable air.  John had taken two steps toward her when the zombie next to her started crowding her toward the small dance floor.  She had a lovely laugh, what he could hear of it through the zombie’s moans of “Daaaannnce!”
Is John telling this tale in a roundabout way, using rather long sentences, as a way to avoid getting to the heart of the matter where he will have to admit awkwardly things he’d rather not and submit to the mortifying ordeal of being known?
They have had A Conversation.
“I need punishment,” Sherlock continued, and that was John’s breaking point.  He had to get Sherlock back in his arms immediately.
Sherlock pressed firmly against John’s side.  “I--”
“Right.”
Rosie blinked again and commenced staring at him like he was an idiot.  Which, of course, reminded him of Sherlock, etc., etc., and he hurried to clarify.  “That’s who she is:  your mum.  That’s what we remember about her.  She was your mum and she loved you with all her heart, and she was a good mother to you.  I’ll keep telling you about her as a mum through your life, everything I can remember, and showing you our pictures of her being your mum.
Mrs. H tutted and went on, “Now if you said it’d been a James Bond dream, I would definitely have thought you put yourself in Mr. Bond’s role.  Guns and running and international intrigues and ladies draping themselves about you left and right -- yes, you’d be the lead there.”

“OK, what?”

thought John, and when Mike said to the man, “Sorry, it’s in my coat,” John decided to take this opportunity to be of service.
“Men are allowed in lesbian bars,” John pointed out.
John’s knees were threatening to give out; he pressed his back into the wall and clutched the chair rail for support.
“Ugh,” Sherlock groaned and flopped face-first into his pillow again.
“Hm.”  John mirrored Sherlock’s pose.  “You’d better take me through the evidence, genius.”
It was so typical for Sherlock to steal John’s thunder, John wondered why he was still surprised by it.  “Mary didn’t tell you
“You’re not going to be telling everyone about

"But you're not gay, as you have declared repeatedly."
“Dadapida,” Rosie said around her dummy.
Sherlock tugged the sheet down to show more of his chest, and inspected his arms, front and back.  “It’s not written on my skin?  I could swear I feel it written all over my skin:  John Watson loves me; together we will be.”
“Oi!”  Cheeky bastard.  “It was a series of conversations; I needed time to sort myself out.”
“No.  It would definitely have been Sherlock.”  Seeing the expression on John’s face, she patted his hand gently.  “I just mean for Tiger King, love.  The eccentric, dramatic show-off?  Definitely Sherlock.”
He was falling headlong into temptation when Sherlock’s phone beeped.  “Daddy?  Ella?”
“When did you--”
“You --”  John could only shake his head, and wrap his arms gently around his idiot. “You’ll be insisting that until you’re old and grey, won’t you?”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows, making John smile.
Weird.  The enthusiasm level was considerably lower than it had been for option four, and nervousness was higher.  John was determined not to push or coerce Sherlock into anything.  ‘Meh’ consent meant no consent, in his mind.   “Are you sure?”
“Who is…”  John almost couldn’t speak, he was so taken aback.  “David Bowie.  Space Oddity, Ziggy Stardust, Let’s Dance.  Really, you don’t know?  He’s only one of the most famous musicians of the twentieth century.”

a tone and a look, but the headbutt you gave me in return demonstrated conclusively your thoughts on re-opening the matter.”
No.  It was— no.  Sherlock could not be bringing this up now, not after two and a half years of nothing.  Two years of Sherlock being dead and six months of John convincing himself he must have just dreamed the blowjobs and cuffs and shackles and dildos and breeding stand, because Sherlock never once…
Sherlock laid down again, and pulled at John until they were both lying on their sides facing each other.  “And we need a system, so that if you ever feel angry, you can stop things.”
, that?  No.  Never.  We don’t—”  He took a breath that did absolutely nothing to quell the tension inside him.  “With Mary, it’s normal.”
“No, actually you were John.  John Reinke.”

They looked at each other for a few minutes, John with a rising sense of serenity and Sherlock with what looked like a growing case of nerves.  Fortunately, John had thought this next part through with Sherlock’s nerves specifically in mind.

“Now,” he said, “dreams are not generally symbolic.  You should know that from the outset.  A dream is just a dream; don’t spend your time looking for the meaning.  ‘A cigar is just a cigar’ and all that.
John smiled at Sherlock’s curls.  “I told you how I felt, and you actually agreed to be with me.  Then we had a rather brilliant shag.”
“You tell your boss this, eh?  Mycroft is arrogant -- tried to buy me the first time he met me -- and interfering -- witness how we’re having this discussion now -- and officious, but he has Sherlock’s best interests at heart.  I’m going to try to get Sherlock to admit that.
Rosie blinked, reminding John of Sherlock’s ‘does not compute’ expression.
John doesn’t, because he’s erased this part of the story from his mind.  Sherlock deletes off his hard-drive; John grabs a rubber larger than his hand and scrubs at the paper until the graphite’s gone or blurred beyond comprehension.
Sherlock nodded, then cleared his throat.  “And I can… propose amendments to these options?”

After gracing him with a quite beautiful full smile, Alice turned back to her friends.  “See, I told ye,” she began; John stopped listening and headed off on a circuitous route back to his sister’s table.
Molly’s gentle laughter was great to hear.  John smiled and continued, “I’m definitely going to have to warn her eventual nursery school teacher about that.”
,” Sherlock insisted with a tone just up to the line between determination and anger.  “You don’t have sex and it’s important to you and--”
They were beginning a push-pull through the lounge toward the stairs that led to Sherlock’s current bedroom.  Which starting tomorrow night would be Rosie’s bedroom.  Just Rosie’s, and John smiled at that, provoking an answering smile on Sherlock’s gorgeous mug.

Back to the case:  Sherlock was and is outstandingly perspicacious, so it’s all solved.  All that’s left is tracking down the current location of the person what done it, and we’ll be leaving that to the Met.

He grunted, still a bit perturbed at Mrs. H not seeing him in a leading role. Sherlock was the driving force behind their mystery-solving, of course, but John had been an officer in the army and a trauma surgeon.  You’d best be able to drive a team of people forward if you wanted to succeed in either of those roles, to say nothing of both at the same time.
No matter how roughly John had shoved him down and grabbed his shoulders. No matter how many times John had slammed that slender -- too slender -- torso against the floor, growling with anger and hurt and relief.

“All of us.  You, me, Sherlock, Mycroft, Mrs. Hudson, and Greg Lestrade.  It was based on Tiger King.  Have you watched that?”
Actually, solution
Mrs. H smiled at him.  “That does sound fun.  By ‘dragon clothes’ you mean…”
“Yeah, I’m not fighting off tigers, am I?”
John Watson was, to put it mildly, not terribly hopeful as Mike Stamford ushered him into one of the labs at St. Bart’s.  Mike had been a good bloke back when John knew him, seemed still to be, but good intentions aside, could he really have found anyone in this sleek, modern place that’d be a match for a life-worn veteran like John?  “Well, bit different from my day,” he noted.
“She’s not?”  Sherlock looked genuinely perplexed.
“I do have to go.  Zoom pub quiz Saturday?”
Smiling hugely, John replied, “OK then, Ella.”
“Yes,” John replied, “whole.”
Stark naked, Sherlock crawled off the bed and then dropped to one knee on the floor.  He held his fingers in what would have been the perfect position for showing a ring box, if he’d had a ring box.  “John Middle-Name-He-Hates Watson, will you do me the honor of signing a legal document -- we’ll make Mycroft figure out which one and the details and all that nonsense -- attesting to the entire world that we are business partners?”
Sherlock smiled his tiniest smile, the one John couldn’t help but think was sweet.  “Mary told me.  She thought it was funny --”  Sherlock held up his hand at John’s burgeoning protest.  “Not the dream itself but that you’d be embarrassed about something so tame.  Relatively speaking.”
Pouring tea for each of them, Mrs. Hudson gave an encouraging-sounding hum, so John went on.  “It was a sort of retelling of that Netflix show we watched together, Tiger King.  We were all of us in it, as people from the show:  me, you, Sherlock, Mycroft, Molly, and Lestrade.  And you’ll never guess who was the lead, the Tiger King.  It was --”
“So just a typical day, really.”
John was not going to do this, move in with someone he didn’t have a thing in common with.  It was mad, absolutely barmy.
“John.”  Molly sounded embarrassed, but they both knew the thanks were due her. “It was a pleasure to spend time with Rosie.”
Smiling, John swiped his left thumb across Sherlock’s cheekbone.  “That’s a sweet gesture.  But  it’s
“Yes, you do.”  John pushed the curls off Sherlock’s forehead, only to have them tumble down again.
, so deeply it might never stop, and still something was keeping him back.
“What?”
“I’ve already laid hands on you, hurt you, and it was horribly unforgivable, and I’m never doing that again.”
With the cases back in his life (the danger, the chase, the exhilaration), John’s found that he’s as shoddy a husband to Mary as he was a boyfriend to the women before her.  He loves her, but she doesn’t fit.  And she shouldn’t have to fit; she should have the man she married.  Or, rather, she should have a man for whom being like the man she married makes him whole.
“It should always be a pleasure, not something you’re, um, being pushed into.  Any time you
When John got back to the table, Harry and her friends were quieter than they’d been all evening.  In fact they were pretty much silent, staring at the woman in black John had met.

The molecule exploded.  “Because I’m yours!”

“It’s forgiven, dear,” Mrs. H said warmly.  She was so good to him.
“And what am I right about?” he asked her.
He was right about that at least.  “Army, yes.”
“No problem,” she said.  “Just give me a mo’ to re-orient my head, and then we’ll start over.”  With a slight squint, she gave him a once-over that was much more inspection-for-appraisal than passion.  “A little old to be going into this line of work, but your kissing’s not half-bad and if that package is the size I think,” -- she nodded, and he resisted the impulse to put his hands over his bits -- “yeah, that’s quite the asset.”
Sherlock Holmes is dazzlingly brilliant.
“John, I -”
“Peas!” Rosie shouted.
Maybe a little familiar... but no.  John had never met this man before.  “Sorry, we haven’t.”
Capital A, Capital C.
Sherlock scratched, none too gently, behind John’s ear.  “You don’t need a brand, John; you’re already mine.  But, yes, if you agree, I will brand you.”

“Option one.  We go on as we have been, working cases together and being best friends, and in a few years Rosie and I move out from 221B.”

“You don’t even know what it’s about.”
Since I have more formally taken over the administration of cases (record-keeping, accounting, billing, not pissing off clients who are willing to pay us), I asked Sherlock if he could provide me with a write-up of his “rating scale” for potential cases to make the intake process easier for me.  He surprised me by emailing it within seconds; it had apparently been at the ready for some time.
“You were in the military,” Sherlock stated.
“Yes, exactly.  And Uncle Sherlock was in it too.  He was a tiger keeper.”
A smile beginning to emerge, Alice turned more toward John.  “Yeah.  Was me uncle’s.”

John interrupted quietly but firmly.  “Have you ever heard the phrase, ‘It’s all over but the shouting’?  Well, here comes the shouting bit.”
Looking for his missing pants, John admonished, “We’re
He nodded once to himself as the woman leaned in closer to speak directly in his ear.  “See the large, broad-shouldered woman in a blue dress and white pinafore standing approximately twenty feet in front of us, on the right?”  John, slightly distracted by the warm breath on the side of his face, belatedly nodded again.  “I need to know the time on the face of her watch.”
John reached his hands forward to stop Lestrade before remembering they were on Skype.  “Wait!  There was one bit about the dream I didn’t tell you yet.”

“Yeah.  It really is.  Sherlock gave up the bedroom by the bath so Rosie and I could share it, and he’s stuffed himself into the smaller bedroom upstairs.  Eventually it’ll get strange, father and daughter sharing a bedroom, but I’ve got a plan for that.  Assuming Sherlock agrees.”
“Mm hm.”

And another woman taken, and another, and John was starting to wonder if he’d lost time and it was somehow Valentine’s Day already instead of mid-December.
Mrs. H began gathering a plate of all varieties of Danish pastry plus a few biscuits as John dried the last dish.

“I had the weirdest dream last night,” John said to Mrs. Hudson as they sat down for a spot of breakfast in Mrs. H’s kitchen.  Rosie and Sherlock were tucked in their beds upstairs, Rosie having not woken yet and Sherlock having gone to bed just as John had been starting his morning ablutions.

And I’m a genius, yes, but you’re the smart one.  About people who haven’t committed crimes yet, and remembering to collect payment and pay bills and all that side of things.  We both contribute; we should both be on the nameplate or whatever it’s called.”
