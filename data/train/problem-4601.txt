After ensuring they weren’t the carnivorous kind that grabbed him before, Castiel used some nearby vines to bind the boar, and they made an early trip back to their cave. Cas carried the boar while Dean collected wood again. Maybe they should gather more vines so Cas could weave something larger, to carry more in one trip. As he had expected, as soon as they reached their cave, Dean was anxious to go back to the jungle and gather more supplies. They would just have to hope that no scavengers found the boar carcass while they were foraging.
Castiel kissed his temple and rubbed his arm. “Do you want your shirt back?” He offered, realizing Dean probably felt naked and exposed, just wearing boxers for a conversation like this.
“I guess I was… hurt,” Jimmy finally admitted. “You took something private and you made it public. It felt like just one more sign that you were pulling away from me.”
By April Dean realized that he hadn’t dated anyone since Cas moved in, so he went to a party and tried to hook up. But everyone he met seemed to be somehow lacking. Dean just couldn’t put his finger on to what exactly it was he was suddenly missing. Until his friend Charlie teased him about his apparent new type - dark haired guys with blue eyes - and Dean realized who he really wanted to be with was Cas.
But he wasn’t sharing his grace, was he? Was that even possible? He frowned and burrowed deeper into the pillow that still smelled like Dean. It took him two whole minutes to realize he had slept again. And that Dean wasn’t in bed anymore. He rolled over and blinked, trying to get his bearings together. His mind felt sluggish but when he reached for his grace, it was still thrumming under his skin. So why was he feeling so… human?
“Shut up and come back here.” Castiel opened his arms and Dean took off his own boxers, throwing the lube on the cushion, and straddling Cas once again. This time their erections brushed and it was so much better already.
Dean nodded and took a sip of his coffee. That was damn good coffee. He could feel his brain functioning better. “Can I ask about an inspiration for a specific song?”
“Uhm, yes. Sorry. Detective.” Jessica frowned a little. “We didn’t do anything wrong, so if you’d just let us out at the next bus stop?”
“Sorry,” Castiel smiled at him, but it was hesitant. Dean could almost believe that Castiel would like to stay, too. But why would he? Dean was just… Dean. And Castiel was so much more.
And before Dean has time to mentally prepare, they actually enter the shop together. Charlie zeroes in on Dean immediately and drags the mystery man over. “Dean here is our resident guinea pig expert. I’m sure he’d love to answer any questions you might have.” She pats the man’s arm. “It was really nice to meet you, Castiel.” She gives Dean a meaningful look before she goes to help another customer.
Castiel narrowed his eyes. “Just stop.” He was not talking to his brother about his crush. They were definitely not back to that stage in their relationship. Not that they ever were, because fucking Jimmy himself had been his crush growing up.
“We’ll see,” Castiel acquiesced. Dean had recovered more quickly than expected. Maybe Castiel could speed up his plans for Dean as well. Yes, he wanted to wait for Dean to initiate, but… short of literally jumping him, Dean had pretty much made his interest clear.
“Why do I have to be sick again?” Dean complained. A bunch of them already hated him. That would just make it worse.
“I know,” Castiel croaked, opening his eyes again just in time to see Charlie handing him some pills.
Castiel stared after him, open-mouthed and confused at the sudden hostility. Charlie touched his shoulder after Dean stormed off. “Iron and rock salt. So grab a poker and let’s see if there’s any guns left…”
Dean buried his hands in Castiel’s hair and just let go, fucking his mouth. He wouldn’t last long. Castiel moaned encouragingly, breathing through his nose and relaxing his throat. And Dean couldn’t believe Castiel was that fucking good at sucking cock. Just behind the VIP room with a dozen people willing to suck Castiel’s cock with no reciprocation. It gave Dean a powerful rush and he pulled Castiel off of him before striping his own cock and coming all over Castiel’s face.
Castiel shrugged. “Knock yourself out.” He pulled on a hoodie on top of his tee before exiting the trailer with Dean. “But no pictures of me in sweat pants. Can’t have people thinking I’m a normal person.”
It caused Dean to get up as well and come to check for himself. Not thinking about the fact that he was naked, Castiel opened the door to see if those sandwiches were still there. “Dude,” Dean chastised him because he was just as naked and in sight of the open door, but nobody was outside and Castiel was just getting the plate on autopilot.
“He’s a stubborn bastard,” Jimmy replied. “Wouldn’t count on it.” He should let her in on his findings. She could help him actually get a deal. Her word would have more weight with their boss. But Castiel was too important to overplay his hand just yet.
He’d screwed up the last two jobs on purpose because nobody was talking to him or they didn’t have anything of value to say. He’d hoped maybe here he’d find a source willing to speak out, but it was just another failure.
He maneuvered Castiel away from the plate and hoisted him up to sit on the table, deepening the kiss and burying his hands in Castiel’s hair, messing it up a little more. Castiel wrapped his legs around Dean’s waist and pulled him closer, hands sliding underneath Dean’s shirt and tugging it up.
Dean caressed his cheek, looking at him thoughtfully, then he slapped him. “Three months. You really are an asshole, you know.” Before Castiel had time to process, Dean leaned in for a kiss. “Let’s do this one and then we’ll see about your further adventures.”
Dean perked up. “Is there a summoning spell? There is, right? It sounded like it when I browsed it.”
“Oh, sorry,” Dean chewed on his lip but stopped it when Castiel simply tapped his own lip as a reminder. “I, uhm, maybe not today?” He didn’t know how to do yoga and so far had stayed clear of any group activities involving it.
“Yeah, just like this,” Castiel encouraged, when Dean started thrusting his hips up in time with Castiel’s strokes. Castiel’s other arm was shaking from holding himself up and Dean tried to pull him down into him.
“Hey Dean, your boyfriend is here,” Charlie announces loudly and Dean flushes. There are customers in this shop. But at least the window should be thick enough that the actual man in question hasn’t heard.
“I’m sorry for hurting you,” Dean whispered. “I wanted to tell you sooner, but… I was just really afraid.”
Which turned out to be an even bigger mistake. Immediately there was a hand on his cock and he couldn’t even tell whose it was. “Can you get me a VIP pass for next time? I’ll make it worth your while, handsome.” “Still open for that threesome, but if it’s just you, also cool.” “Oh boy, finally someone I’d even do for free.”
Cas stood up and smacked the back of Jimmy’s head in reply, before walking over to join Dean on the couch. “We can still throw you out.”
“I’m sorry,” Cas repeated. “For what it’s worth, Jimmy isn’t vindictive. He’ll bring it back as soon as his forensics team is done.” And they shouldn’t be able to find anything. Castiel always created a virtual backup first and nobody working for the feds should be good enough to outwit him.
He rubbed at his temple, realizing his head really fucking hurt, probably from the impact. Or the heat. Or, on second thought, maybe the alien had drugged him? Nah, it let him go, just now, so that wasn’t very likely.
With one last squeeze to Cas’ shoulder, Dean went back behind the counter and then into the back. Castiel tried to focus on the people walking by outside. Usually that calmed him down, but… Jimmy was back. He wasn’t prepared for that.
Jack might be God now and say he wouldn’t interfere, but he was still around humans for most of his life, so he is attached. Apparently at one point he’d talked to Dean about Heaven and it had stuck with him.
“So at least some of what she said was the truth,” Dean concluded. “I’m sure she genuinely cared about you.” At some point. Probably. Dean sure didn’t have to like her. But he hoped it would make it easier for Cas to believe he hadn’t been duped for years.
Rowena arrived the next day. She took one look at them and smiled. “Well, first of all: Congratulations, boys. I hope all the pining paid off and it was a satisfying communion.”
Dean turned onto his side, facing away from Castiel. He didn’t think he could handle anything else without being tempted to accelerate this. And once they started, he had a feeling they wouldn’t be able to stop again.
Castiel pouted, tangling a hand in Dean’s hair and pulling him off. “Stay the night and I’ll help you carry your hoard.”
After Dean’s tea was done, Castiel placed it on the nightstand and added a handwritten note reading ‘drink me’, then he dressed himself and left before Dean could finish his shower. He hadn’t been lying earlier. This was hard for him, too. And he didn’t need to add a dripping wet Dean fresh out of the shower to his long list of things he had to resist this morning.
Castiel glared at him. “I hate you.” He inhaled his still too hot coffee and considered asking Balthazar for a cooling spell. But if you gave him the small finger, it would surely end in disaster. “It’s not even true.” The surface didn’t need to be flat. Castiel would also get horizontal on a lumpy bed or over a sofa or...
Dean grumbled but swung his legs over the edge of the bed. “Alright,” he sighed and passed his hands through his sleep tousled hair. Dean had probably fallen asleep again during the day. He must have looked adorable.
Dean deflates. Yeah. Billie doesn’t seem to be a ‘fool me twice’ kinda gal. “Just throw me in the Empty. Isn’t that what you always wanted to do?”
Dean felt even worse, but slinked into his office, finding his desk tidy - not the way they’d left it on Friday - and his computer already booted up, awaiting him to just enter his passcode. Shit, it would suck to lose Cas.
Eventually, they had to turn it off and Castiel handed Dean a towel before grabbing one for himself. Towels wrapped around their waists, they stumbled back into the bedroom followed by a cloud of steam and Castiel handed Dean a fresh pair of boxers and another worn band tee before dressing himself and leading him into the kitchen for breakfast.
“I pay you enough for five kinds of shower gels,” Dean replied without missing a beat and Castiel realized he really must be feeling better. The mention of their working relationship had caused him to retreat before, but now he seemed ok to joke about it.
Dean paused, then holstered his gun once again. “Oh-kay.” He drawled it out in such a way that Castiel knew he didn’t believe him.
“S‘just because I was hoping for a reward later.“ Dean tried to justify himself to not look like the complete sucker he was. It‘s just how he operated. He did things for the people he lo… Dean froze.
“So what you’re saying is, you used my computer to make the world a better place?” Dean rephrased, because that was what it sounded like to him.
Ana had jumped in the water a while back, on the opposite side of the ship from the Kraken, and Castiel could only hope she’d made it out. He wasn’t sure what her plan was, but he knew she didn’t just abandon them. She’d go down with Dean. They were both equally battle-crazy.
Castiel was taking off his pants and putting them down underneath him, arranging them in a circle. He met Dean’s eyes, distressed. “Get me more clothes. Now.”
No. What was he thinking? Anael couldn’t win. They had to find another way. Cas stayed silent, looking tiny, hunched in on himself in the backseat. Jimmy reached back to touch his knee. “Alright. Let’s re-strategize and come up with a plan.”
“Only if you bring back one of your silk PJs for me to try next time,” Castiel replied, nudging Dean’s leg under the table.
“Sorry,” Dean mumbled, nibbling at the sandwich. He eyed Castiel carefully, trying to read him. He seemed genuinely worried, but Dean wasn’t quite sure why. Dean was just his boss. Surely in light of recent events he’d find a better boss elsewhere?
Castiel rolled his eyes when Dean was out of sight. They had cameras set up to surveil the perimeter. Only him and Meg had access and he’d make sure to wipe that account tomorrow. Because of the cameras, they hadn’t really set up any other security, just at the frontgate and Dean wouldn’t pass those.
Dean wanted to believe him, but he chuckled. That sounded too good to be true. He told him as such and Castiel cupped his cheek again, stroking his fingers along his skin, indulging him.
If they piled up a few of the heavier stones, they could narrow down the entrance to create more protection, and if the weather became a problem, it would provide better shelter from the elements. Castiel looked over at Dean and realized he was thinking in terms of long-term survival. Maybe he should hold off on calling Anna until he had a better plan. Or any plan.
“I’ll do you one better,” Castiel promised. “I’ll never bug you about it again. But you gotta be honest and promise me that you’ll try.”
Odin rolled her eyes. “What? You want me to throw in a fake passport, too? Access your account and buy your own.”
Dean came to with something tugging on his leg. He groaned and tried to get it to stop because it fucking hurt—until his brain kicked back in and he realized that while he wasn’t dead, he definitely wasn’t in his fighter pod anymore. Blinking his eyes open had him reaching for his gun in the same breath, because a Tin Can, one of
“But I didn’t.” Castiel frowned. It wasn’t sneaking on if Dean apparently willingly let him come. It suddenly dawned on him that Dean had known his secret all along, and now definitely had it confirmed. Would he tell the crew? Were they feeding him to the mermaids next? Maybe he should change strategy and plead. But… no. He had done nothing wrong. He’d followed his assignment until he realized Dean was a good man, and then he’d betrayed his Navy superiors. Surely Dean knew that.
They both couldn’t wait for it to be over so they could get back to the comfort part of this whole ‘being shot at’ business.
Castiel wasn’t sure if Dean was bluffing or not, but it sure worked. Balthazar pouted. “You wouldn’t.” When Dean didn’t back down from his stare, Balthazar sighed. “Fine. You’re both no fun. What a great match.” He walked over towards a part of the store and pointed towards a stack of what seemed to be photographs. “Here’s your precious clue. I’ll be taking my leave now. Don’t do anything fun without… oh, nevermind.” He smirked again and then vanished into thin air.
He used the alone time to call his brother about arranging protective custody for Garth and Jessica. Sam was the D.A. and while this meant they sometimes didn’t see eye to eye about proper police procedure or charges slapped onto a perp, they were still on the same side. Sam promised to send someone to pick them up within the hour.
Jimmy sat back and twisted his hands. Communication. They had to get back to sharing. “Chaos,” he started and stopped himself. But Cas inclined his head, so he continued on. “I’m never gonna become Assistant Director, or hell, I’m probably not gonna become team leader either. It doesn’t matter where I sit. But I like my job. I just would like it a lot better if I could also have a private life again. Come see you. See Dean. Hang out here and drink coffee.” Jimmy shrugged.
“Will do my best,” Jimmy promised, definitely not intending to honor his word. But it was good to know they didn’t have microphones outside Castiel’s trailer.
“Dammit, Dean,” Castiel chastised him, but he didn’t sound mad. “Deep breaths.” He kissed Dean’s shoulder and rubbed soothing circles over his back until Dean could feel something give inside of him and all the tightness left his chest and consequently the rest of his body.
Jimmy waited for Castiel’s shift at the docks to end and intercepted him before he could get on the bus home. “Come on,” Jimmy tried to lure him. “I’ll drive you.”
“And it’s not over yet.” Castiel added, mostly meaning himself, but Dean’s face lit up. Castiel couldn’t help but smile back.
He cupped Castiel’s cheeks and angled his head, taking control of the kiss. They embraced for a long time until Dean pulled away to throw more wood into the fire and get the new blankets Cas had woven from some long leaves Dean had used to carry more wood. He spooned up behind Castiel and threw both blankets over them, pressing one last kiss to his neck before they drifted off to sleep.
“Are we fucking?” Dean threw in, matter-of-factly. He waited for Jimmy to nod. “That’s none of your goddamn business, Agent.”
Dean rolled his eyes. Ah great. Did he think that was what his race was called? Was Castiel not his name but his species? “Whatever.” He sulked back to the other tree and picked another sour fruit, eating it while glaring at his blue-hued companion, who had retracted his armor again.
Dean gripped one end of the net and he and Sam got as close to the Kraken as they could, avoiding the tentacles until they threw the net over him. Sam shouted another spell and the net lit up in a golden glow, falling down around the Kraken and keeping him momentarily trapped, tentacles at his side.
“Oh, no, I…” Castiel hesitates, but when Dean holds him out, he strokes the pig’s head gently before taking him out of Dean’s hands and cradling him carefully to his own body. Their fingers brush but Dean can’t even obsess about it, because the way Castiel handles the guinea pig is just so precious.
Perking up at that, Dean straightened his position a little, wiggling his ass to signal he was ready.
Dean turned around, cupping Castiel’s cheek. “I might want some other things from you instead.” His expression was open, honest. Almost enough for Castiel to lean in and kiss him again.
Dean beams. Usually when he meets guys, they mock him for having a children’s pet and not a ‘real one’. It’s an immediate red flag for him. He’s glad Castiel is not one of those morons. He pulls out his phone to show Castiel some pictures but stops when Castiel pulls his own phone out as well. Oh.
Castiel snorted and refilled his mug. “I’ll make sure you also ingest plenty of valuable nutrients that are more to your taste.”
Dean made sure to give a neutral statement, explaining how everybody he’d spoken with on the compound had listed Meg as the one in charge and Castiel as the caretaker they were looking up to, but not involved in any of the business decisions. He also mentioned how concerned Castiel had been when he’d found out some members might have gotten drugged and how he immediately complied with the investigation.
Cas shrugged, indicating it was ok. “Either way. She knows we’re on to her. And she gave me a day to flee the country before she would blow up all of our lives.”
Dean waited, but Cas didn’t elaborate. “Tell me what?” Dean snapped, imagining the worst, of course. Tell him that he was going to go back to being only with his brother? What?
“Hey,” Castiel crawled up with him, cupping his cheek and stroking his hand down Dean’s neck. “I was referring to this morning, just so you know.”
Dean rolled his eyes and mumbled something before he finished arranging the branches he had insisted on carrying. Then he went back outside and looked at the sky. “It’s not dark yet.”
He was just happy that Castiel had taken it as well as he did. Falling asleep together alleviated most of Dean’s anxiety and he’d been able to get a good night’s rest. If he wasn’t mistaken, Henriksen should be coming by for his drop-off tonight, so Dean could set things in motion and focus the attention on Meg.
Castiel looked up at his friend in gratitude. Dean was ok. He was a good person. None of this would fall back on him negatively, Castiel would make sure of that. “Yeah, ok.” His voice came out a lot more unsteady than he’d counted on and Dean’s face softened.
Looking at the door that led below deck with renewed interest, Castiel shook his head and grabbed the poker. He realized there were a lot more crewmen on deck now than back when they’d been fighting the snake. So ghosts shouldn’t be too hard, then? Besides, there was no way he was sitting this one out.
“Is that his name? We haven’t been able to ID him yet. So if you have any further information?” Dean prompted.
Dean has to laugh and puts a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. How had he found a guy this hot yet this insecure? “It’s fine. I invited you, remember? You didn’t press.” He suddenly gets an idea. “But you have a point. Let me take a picture of you to text Charlie so if I don’t show up to work the next day, the police will know who to look for.”
When he woke up again, hours later, he felt rested and his leg hurt a lot less. He experimentally moved his foot and it worked without pain. “Thank you,” he said, touching his belly again. He still didn’t want to risk standing up, but he crawled towards their small stash of fruit with a lot more ease than in the previous days.
Dean just mumbled incoherently again, this time more thanks than curses audible. With a smile, Castiel got back up and took out the plug, keeping his other hand on the beads to make sure they still stayed in. “Ok, Dean, whenever you’re ready.”
“I sorta imagine you in silk pajamas at home,” Castiel guessed, pointing his fork at him before spearing a piece of bacon. “You seem the type.”
Dean’s breath came out in tiny hitches, almost like he was muffling sobs. Gaining back some control, Castiel carefully untangled Dean’s leg, helping him set it down. He slipped out and wrapped his arms around Dean until Dean followed, burying his face in Castiel’s neck again and holding on tightly to his body.
“Oh no, Dean.” Castiel cradled Dean’s hands in his own. “Oh, look at you. That must hurt so much.” He gave Dean a look so filled with compassion that he almost believed the stories that Castiel could feel your pain as if it was his own.
Castiel sighed. “I’m sorry. It was dumb. I only told Crowley because he’d looked over my code and didn’t believe me when I said it worked.”
By the time they actually made it on deck, the ship’s crew was already ready to depart. It was a flurry of commotion, Castiel standing off to the side with Garth as they watched the crew work together without a hitch, Dean at the helm looking glorious and carefree, a natural aura of leadership about him.
“We’re ordering in because I’m a terrible host with an empty fridge,” Castiel explained while typing out his address and checking out with Apple Pay before Dean could protest. “I’ll let you pay next weekend.” Finally looking at Dean again, he added. “And you can take me out to dinner every day next week if you want.”
Castiel smiled and picked out a few calming ingredients. “I worked at an alternative store once. The owner was a witch and she taught me all about herbology.” The store had also been a front for illegal drugs, so he’d learned about a lot of blends and tinctures, too.
Castiel looked at him with wide eyes. Last night he’d finally slept, and he had just the one dream. A guy with a cross on his hand. His door being kicked in. A gun pointed at him. He’d thought it was just a nightmare related to them getting shot at just a few hours before, but…
Michael would say that sparing the parent allows the offspring to grow up so they provide more meat, but Castiel would have just generally felt bad. Dean saw him backtrack and raised an eyebrow. Castiel gestured with his hands. “Younglings.”
“Fuck, Cas!” Dean buried one hand in his hair to keep him against his chest, his own pleasure sky-rocketing. When Castiel used his teeth to worry at his right nipple before soothing it with his tongue and blowing air against the abused skin, the added stimulation was enough to push him over the edge, coming untouched. “Fuck!”
For a second, Castiel wondered if he’d had any weird porn open that Dean could have seen, but then he remembered handing Dean his phone after he’d looked up the psychologist. Instead of prompting Dean, Castiel waited patiently for him to phrase his request.
“Told you I could take it,” Dean replied, eyes narrowed in defiance for a few seconds until Castiel moved his hips and Dean’s expression changed to bliss. “Fuck, yes.”
“Ugh,” Castiel groaned. “How are you a writer? That was cheesy as fuck.” He kicked out, lightly hitting Dean in his thigh.
Balthazar shrugged with a smirk and looked him up and down. “Not a lot of marks. I’d have pegged Dean for a biter.”
Their shirts were already off and Dean was just working on Castiel’s boxers when there was a knock on the door. “Oh, for fuck’s sake,” Castiel cursed and Dean just groaned.
“Oh, that’s where we’re at now? Good to know.” Meg had lowered her voice, but she still seemed extremely pissed off. “Seriously, Clarence. He’s an FBI agent and you’re letting him into your quarters?”
With a nod, Castiel went to his closet and got out a towel and a fresh set of clothes. And just when Dean had gotten his hopes up, Castiel added, “Let me watch you walk to the bathroom though, at least.”
Did that mean he’d monetize and sell to the enemy though? Jimmy just couldn’t tell. They had been going through a rough time. Their family had just cut them off. So maybe Castiel had been trying to take care of him the way he should have taken care of Castiel. Jimmy was the older brother anyway. By a whole eight minutes.
, Dean,” Castiel replied. “My sweet, perfect boy. I am so happy I found you.” He pulled out his come covered hand and looked at it, then gave Dean an inquisitive glance.
“Oh no, Dean,” Castiel pulled back a little so he could kiss Dean’s forehead, then his nose and then both cheeks. “You’re perfect. Absolutely perfect how you are. I am sorry that I mistreated you.”
Castiel looked up at him in confusion. “Don’t you want… am I… bad?” As soon as the words left his lips, he wanted to kick himself. Castiel would not doubt himself. Castiel was a dominant bastard. He was…
With that, she finally opened the door and left, leaving Castiel behind to sack onto the floor in defeat.
He hopes Sam takes good care of Miracle. She was a good dog. Without her he probably wouldn‘t have made it as long, wouldn‘t have been able to pretend he was fine for as long as he had to not worry Sam too much. Eileen was back. Sam was happy. He‘d be happy now, too and live a long life.
“I’ll say.” Dean brought their still joined hands to his lips and kissed Cas’s, then let go to pull him down for a proper kiss.
Jo rolled her eyes. “Ok, look. If it’s about physical attraction, why not just go and bang it out of your system?”
He sighed, unpacking his fruit bowl. He’d forgotten to hand it to Castiel to put in the fridge but now that it was already here, he might as well leave it open and snack during the day and save his lunch hour for work. He’d lost too much time yesterday already.
Looking back at the small crowd and back at Ruby, Dean realized that Ruby probably knew all of this, because that‘s how she‘d gotten in as well. He wondered just what she had to do to be here - and if she would tell him if he asked.
Dean kissed him sweetly and then settled back down, pulling Castiel’s head into the crook of his neck and stroking his fingers through his hair. Dean’s other hand was awkwardly hovering next to them, as if Dean was afraid to clean it.
Jimmy bit back an ‘Yes, that’s what I warned you about days ago,’ but instead he just nodded. It was good that they were on the same page here. “I want to help you make sure that doesn’t happen.”
“Could be better,” Castiel replied honestly. “How are you? Can I offer you anything?” It felt weird to not acknowledge that she’d been waiting for him in the dark. But… what the fuck?
Dean looked disgusted for a second, but after Castiel winked at him, he glared and started coughing. “Don’t make me laugh. Ugh.” Dean half heartedly punched Castiel’s shoulder. “Everything hurts.”
, they just kissed. It was too much for his brain and it just seemed to shut off. Instead, he went on instinct and carefully helped Castiel out of the crouch he was still in and down on his knees, making sure Castiel ended up kneeling on the clothes, as well, since he was naked from the waist down.
Dean chuckles. Oh god. Castiel was adorable. “Yeah. But don’t worry about it. I’ll make sure you get a same-sex pair. Unless you want to start breeding them?”
After breaking it off with Jimmy, he barely had time to take a deep breath before Cas was in his lap, claiming his lips for himself. Cas was pulled off of him by Jimmy, who dragged Cas in by his hair for another kiss between the brothers. And just like that, they had forgotten all about the initial rules they had set and no more commands were necessary.
“I’m so sorry, Dean.” Castiel leaned in further, resting his head against Dean’s and watching the cartoon with him now. Dean put away his own salad bowl. Castiel was happy to see that he’d eaten all of it and he turned his head to kiss his cheek.
Dean pulled away long enough to take off his shirt, throwing it behind him and freeing Castiel of his shirt as well. “You’re insanely beautiful,” Dean mused, trailing kisses down Castiel’s neck and over his chest, sucking a nipple between his lips and toying with the nub. Castiel moaned, pulling him closer, one hand in Dean’s hair and the other scratching down his back.
Resting his head on Dean’s thigh so he didn’t have to look at him, Castiel groaned. “Either.” He hated that he had to even ask this, but hopefully it would help ground him. Remind him that he was definitely with Dean and nobody else.
Dean smiled. “Ok, that’s actually a cute story. Why did he drop the nickname?” Dean remembered how angry Castiel had gotten when Jimmy had called him that.
“Alright,” Castiel looked up at Dean from under his wet eyelashes. “I believe you, Dean. It… it will take a while for me to fully trust you again, but… I guess I can see why you didn’t tell me sooner.” He walked past Dean and back to his tea, preparing two mugs. “Still hurts though,” he muttered silently, watching Dean hang his head when it sunk in.
Dean rubbed his hands over his face. “What?” He’d been told official interviews were out of the question. Castiel, ever the mystery, refused to give them on principle. However Dean was a great reporter and he did indeed already have a list of questions prepared, just in case he got lucky. And it seemed that it paid off now.
When Castiel entered The Good Bean, Jimmy was already at Castiel’s usual table with a laptop open in front of him. When he glanced towards the counter, he found Dean watching him nervously, probably ready to throw Jimmy out on his ass, because he was that kind of a good friend. So he gave him an encouraging smile as he approached.
“Yeah,” Dean confirmed. And man, he really wondered how things worked on that planet of his. Was this a Superman thing? Was he only strong under a specific sun and weak under another? Two suns in this case. “Maybe I should bring you back some herbs and we can try.”
“Alright, fine,” Castiel ground out. He pulled back and without warning, thrust into Dean hard and fast, making him scream and scratch at his back, then he just as abruptly slowed down again.
“Rowena,” Dean greeted her. “To what do we owe this unexpected pleasure?” He didn’t sound pleased, at all.
“I know.” Castiel sighed, slumping against the countertop. All of his carefully laid plans. He should trust in his own abilities to implicate Meg. It was basically bullet proof. Not much longer and they’d be able to leave scot free. He just… he hadn’t expected to be put on trial. For all anyone knew, he was the innocent victim here. He shouldn’t have to prove that in court.
Castiel smiled back but then his face soured. “I’m still waiting for an apology. And an explanation.”
Jimmy was back and Dean leaned next to Jo at the counter. “Don’t stare at him,” he chastised, though he went right ahead and stared at him too.
“Nothing,” Castiel bit his lip. Damn. He should go find new clothes and a place to sleep. “I’ll leave you to it.” He nodded towards Dean, who probably wanted to talk with his brother, and made his way down below deck.
“Nah.” Dean shrugged, finally glancing at Castiel. “Didn’t stop him from trying. Or my dad. And I dunno. I just… gained weight. Didn’t go out much either. My dad was mostly drinking.” Dean turned back to the TV. “Apparently my mom had been pregnant. It kinda broke him.”
But this made their own plan easier, too. Dean was the first to emerge with Sam held in front of him as a live shield, his dagger pressed to Sam’s throat. Next came Castiel, who had trained his gun on Sam. It was hopefully more believable that they’d captured Sam if Cas seemed like a traitor. Which… by now, was actually true.
“Uh, yes,” the man, Castiel, rasps in a deep voice and Dean’s head snaps back up. “I read that you should always buy more than one guinea pig but is two a good number? Or should they be in a larger group? And how will I know if they even like each other?”
Most of his cases had been drug related and he hadn’t seen any changes. They would arrest one person and another came along, taking their place. But building something in Costa Rica with Castiel? Helping the impoverished get back on their feet and have a better future? Or simply feeding the hungry? Worthy causes.
“I’ll officially write it. It’ll have a Cyber Security watermark. They’d be fools not to hire you,” Jimmy reassured him. “Unless of course you’d want to come work for us now? I could…”
Cas slumped into the seat but eyed the cup holder with the two cups inside. Jimmy handed him his and Cas mumbled an almost inaudible thanks before taking a large gulp. “Alright,” he stated. “Talk.”
The next day, he went into the field office for his debriefing. But before he could do that, they had a nurse wait for him to get a blood and urine sample.
Castiel shrugged. “Maybe I am too trustworthy. I admit that I’ve always been glad to not have to make too many decisions around here. It frees my mind to focus on the individuals, to help where I can.”
“You’d still be half as cute as the cat,” Castiel promised and Dean slapped him with the dishtowel he had slung over his shoulder before leaving and returning with a refill. “Charlie invited us for movie night on Thursday. You in?” Castiel asked as soon as he was back.
“Yes, Cas. More,” Dean agreed. “Get me ready for your big cock.” He reached between them and wrapped his hand around Castiel’s dick, jerking him a few times. “Can’t wait to ride it.”
Dean shrugged, squirming a little. He was a red-blooded single in his thirties. There was nothing to be ashamed of. He was allowed to look at porn. And if it was animated, was it even technically porn?
“Officers, please,” Sam pleaded. “I wish to say my life alone should be worth enough, but capturing a filthy, ruthless pirate…” He pretended to struggle against Dean, who tightened his hold. “Is worth more than one life. However, I am very valuable to the intelligence and I urge you to let them pass.”
It wasn’t like Castiel wasn’t enjoying more of Dean’s pale skin, but he was confused. “What are you doing?”
Maybe he’d focus more on that kind of work. Raise awareness and not just fix all of the problems himself. He was still pondering about it when he reached the outside of Charlie’s apartment complex where Dean was already waiting for him.
Castiel appeared to hesitate. “Maybe when you’re better.” Castiel was done forging all the necessary papers, but he still needed to find a way to pin the drugs on her.
“Yeah well, case sounded important.” Sam shrugged and Dean frowned. That was definitely not all there was to it. But he’d interrogate him later. “This is my brother, the district attorney.” Dean introduced him. “Jessica, he’s going to get you somewhere safe.”
“Why would I come warn you if I had set a trap?” Castiel frowned, trying to urge them on. The rest of the men had gathered behind Dean, their weapons at the ready and aimed at Castiel.
Dean considered for a moment, then he cocked his head. “That errand this morning? So… my brother is the assistant D.A. And I put in a good word for you.”
Dean narrowed his eyes. He did. He’d worked hard so he could afford his new place and he finally had room for a tree, so of course he had one this year. But fine. He wasn’t going to stand in the way of Sam’s happiness. “Guess I’ll leave it up a little longer then so you can see it when you come for your college tour next year, huh?”
Dean hesitated. Eat the food, where Castiel could see him? He wouldn’t be able to refuse it and just pretend he was eating by picking around with his fork before he could get to his stashed protein bars in his own room.
“Of course,” Castiel exclaimed. “Dean, you’re the best thing that’s happened to me in such a long time. I would be devastated to lose you. The Farm, I can live without. I can start fresh somewhere else, be more careful, build something better. But you…” He cupped both of Dean’s cheeks. “You don’t even know how precious you are to me. How dear.”
Dean snorted and nudged his shoulder. “Thank you though. For making me feel better.” Taking a step back, Dean bowed down. “And for taking care of me,” he added once he was standing again.
“You heard him,” Ana commanded. “Set the damn sails and let’s put as much distance between us as possible.” She seemed torn to run and help, but Dean was still passed out on the floor right next to her. Biting her lip, she threw Castiel a meaningful look. Castiel just nodded and ran over to the mast, barking more orders and helping them set the sails and adjusting for the winds. He also sent a few crewmen to keep an eye out in case the lower decks of the Impala caught fire. If they knew right away, they could be put out before they reached the rum reserve. Or worse, the gunpowder.
“Oh, good grief.” Billie rolls her eyes. “Fine. Have it your way.” She slams her scythe on the ground and it suddenly opens up below him and he’s falling. And falling.
“Huh?” Dean snapped out of it and licked his lips. “Yeah. Fine.” He took a step back as well and crashed into the cabinet. “Sorry.” Before Castiel could use it as an excuse for further touching—he had to check for bruising, after all—Dean turned around and fled. Oh, well then.
Dean’s legs were laid up on his chair and when Dean moved his head, he realized something soft was placed under it. “Here I am,” he replied dumbly and smiled.
Dean’s mind went blank, unsure how to proceed. Was Castiel waiting for that blowjob now or... Wait. “Hey, offense taken. I am neither.” Too late Dean realized that he’d just admitted to his attraction. Then again. That earlier offer would have also done the trick. He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath.
“I admit this tea tastes good,” Dean concluded when he sat the mug back down. “Definitely better than your weirdo toothpaste.”
“No, but noted.” Castiel passed a hand through his hair. Yup. Definitely sending the FBI that fruit basket when they were out of here.
Dean kissed the pad of Castiel’s finger and then pulled back once more. “Are you going to be ok? To wait?”
Hidden in a cabin Anna had constructed in the woods after Castiel’s punishment—just in case anyone else in their family needed sanctuary before it was too late—Castiel, Dean and Mary hid out for a few more months, only visited by Anna. Then one day, Jack came along and Castiel had judged him right. He would be a benevolent ruler and his first priority was peace.
“Yes. A snickers isn’t bacon,” Dean defended himself before it obviously clicked for him. “Oh.” He shrugged, chagrinned. “I was hungry, ok?”
Castiel frowned. “Jealous? No. I want them off my back for a while.” He groaned. “Ugh, I can’t take it anymore. I’m over it. I just want to get well and truly fucked. You in?” He pushed Dean against the wall and started to crowd in.
Rowena just smiles at him, then she looks up. “I’d say he’s ready,” she says, in a loud voice and Dean just has time to frown before he feels himself shift once again.
So he took a detour to a small Naval supply post he knew because he’d picked up a uniform there before, back when he’d been rapidly climbing the ranks. Holding his head up high, he strolled straight in before the guard could catch up with him. “Castiel Novak, 2nd Division, Blue Squadron, reporting in from an assignment. But please don’t let me face my superiors in these filthy rags.”
When she was done explaining, Sam wanted to get started on breaking the bond right away, but Dean and Castiel looked at each other and paused. Dean knew where his brother was coming from, but Cas wasn’t Ruby and Dean wasn’t juicing up to be Lucifer’s vessel. Or maybe Michael’s, in this case.
“What does that have to do with cats?” Castiel frowned, cocking his head, and somehow that made both of the others crack up.
Castiel didn’t reply, but he nudged his thigh under the table. For the rest of their meal, he kept stealing glances as Meg and Castiel did the same. Additionally, Castiel seemed to have slowed down his eating even more so he could match Meg. Dean was too curious to be disappointed about lost time for more fun activities.
“But I like taking care of you,” Castiel pouted. But he could take a hint. Dean wanted exercise. “Do yoga with me later. Maybe you’ll like it.”
Dean sighed and looked down, shuffling his left foot. “I really want to take you up on that, but I’d probably feel shitty the whole time.”
It ended up more crooked than he’d wanted, but it had been a while. And also, he was working with vine strips and thorns, here. The shirt Castiel made looked a lot better, he had to grudgingly admit, so he was confused when Castiel insisted on switching them.
Sam sighed, looked at Castiel, and then his shoulder slumped. “I arranged the transfer papers. It should’ve been an easy in and out.”
Dean mirrored him and blew on his tea. Henriksen had been pissed about having to carry back all the water and protein bars he’d brought him. He’d been even more pissed that Dean apparently fell under the cult leader’s spell and almost insisted he at least take the water because surely Castiel was drugging him somehow.
?” Castiel prodded, then he stopped himself. Dean had a weird relationship with food. He shouldn’t push him, or at least wait until he’d eaten before Dean would retreat again. “I mean, I’m glad I met your tastes. If you ever don’t like something, tell me and maybe we can switch.”
Castiel crossed his arms in front of his chest. “First of all, hush,” his voice was strong but silent. “And I don’t have to inform you of anything.” He was the leader here. This was his compound.
Dean nodded, his posture a little more relaxed, but when Castiel turned to leave, he immediately tensed up again. “Hey, uhm, Cas…”
A few minutes later a bottle of water was pressed in his hand and Dean took a sip, watching Castiel sit down across from him and unwrapping a sandwich. “Here. It’s turkey on rye.”
Castiel narrowed his eyes. “I don’t need your…” He stopped himself and hung his head. Goddammit. “There was a time piece. I don’t think it had anything to do with the case, but maybe…” He hesitated. “I think it was left for me.”
When he landed on a cartoon, Dean let out a gleeful sound. “Oh man, I love that stupid dog.” He pointed his fork at the TV, which was showing a Scooby Doo re-run. Castiel sat down his remote and kept watching Dean out of the corner of his eye, happy to find him obviously engrossed and enjoying the program.
Dean laughed and nursed his drink, wondering if he should get one for Cas the way Ruby always got a drink for Anna. But he didn’t expect them to spend much time in the VIP area anyway.
Dean’s eyes met his, surprised. He held Castiel’s gaze until he answered in an equally soft voice, “My mom.”
,” Castiel replied, placing a kiss on Dean’s chest where his head was resting. He’d wrapped himself as much around Dean as Dean had wrapped around him, not even seeking out his own orgasm after getting Dean off. “Sorry it took me a second try.”
Eyebrow raised, he wiped his hand on his pants before fishing for his card, keeping his right hand off of it. “So, that porn of yours… Is it some cleaning fetish stuff for germaphobes?”
Apparently that was the wrong thing to say because his students exploded into a chorus of questions about the cat—how old, what breed, what color, what’s their name—and quickly turned into demands to
“See?” Castiel said. “This is what I mean. You do this for others. And if you won’t do it for yourself, you have me now to remind you how awesome you are.”
“What? No, he…” Castiel stopped, glancing towards the two-way mirror yet again. Fuck. Was he being hazed? He’d only recently transferred to the Chicago field office after a brief stint in Nebraska following his FBI training. But he’d spent years in the military before, so he was used to some posturing in front of the new guy, but he didn’t think they’d be this… childish.
Dean was squirming, clearly conflicted, and Castiel cupped his cheek. “Dean. If your allergies come back, of course we’ll rehome the cat.” He had been fine after their friend Charlie had gotten a cat. In fact, Dean had only mentioned showing allergy symptoms once, back when he was a kid. Otherwise, Castiel wouldn’t even be suggesting this. He didn’t want Dean to suffer. From allergies, anyway. He still deserved a little more suffering for the stunt he’d pulled today, but that would be administered tomorrow. And did not actually involve getting a cat and ignoring his wishes.
Dean raised an eyebrow. “Takes two, you know.” When Castiel just growled in response, Dean took pity on him and moved to the side of the bed so Cas could slide in. “Just don’t…” Dean sighed. “I don’t cuddle.”
All in all, he was happy. Happier than he’d ever been. He was on a very nice job, no fellow researchers having drama in his vicinity, he could concentrate on his work and had time for Dean. And he suddenly had something to come home to, other than just his job and the occasional hook up.
After explaining what he’d seen in the time piece, Balthazar made Castiel look up the blonde girl in one of their magic forums. She wasn’t even too hard to find. Jessica Moore ran a prominent magic shop in town, selling trinkets and offering palm readings in the front, but apparently having a vast array of real magical supplies in the back.
Dean grunted, narrowing his eyes. He had a point, but fuck if he’d admit it. “But what does it have to do with the case?”
“Listen, you’ll come stay with me,” Dean quickly reassured him. Hadn’t they already established that? “And we’ll figure out the rest. I’ll get a bail bond.” Maybe he should call Sam. They’d lost touch when Sam left for college, leaving before Dean could even consider to follow. He hadn’t even given Dean a chance, back then. He’d just… Sam hadn’t just left dad. He’d left Dean, too.
They made it to Garth’s place in record time, due to the streets being mostly empty and the Detective ignoring all the speed limits. But they were on official police business, as Dean helpfully pointed out when Castiel dared to remark on it. Castiel had leaned back then, feeling smug to be on
Ana snorted and even Dean raised an eyebrow at that. “Alright, I think you need more rum. You’re coming with me.” Dean grabbed him by the front of his shirt and dragged him along, down below deck and to his private quarters.
Dean was looking at him now and Castiel nodded for his benefit. “We can,” he promised Dean more than himself.
It was only years of training that kept Castiel from losing his calm expression. Instead he gave Dean his most stricken look. “Yes. I had just hoped…” He passed a hand through his hair. “They seemed so much happier after.” Because Castiel had made sure he was the one to soothe them and offer them water and kind words, building them back up after a horrible few days of very little hydration and a lot of occasionally hallucinogenic steam. They were loyal to him after that.
He’s not even lying. The people he killed wearing the mark. The good monsters he killed before he learned not to think in black and white.
After a last glance at his console, Castiel was ready to leave his ship behind, confident he’d gotten everything he needed. When he held out his arm, his suit briefly connected with the ship and he saw the last recorded coordinates flash on his screen. Suddenly he knew where he was:  New Eden, a planet they’d been terraforming.
“Shit, Cas,” Dean yelled, trying to pull off, but Castiel had anticipated this and followed his movements, staying firmly locked around Dean’s cock, ready to swallow his seed. “Goddammit,” Dean cursed, spilling into Castiel’s waiting mouth.
Castiel was a little surprised that Dean had stopped arguing so easily about getting a pet. Damn, he’d really hit a nerve with his suggestion, hadn’t he? Or maybe Dean was just still too much in his own space. “If you like them, sure.” He could see Jimmy open his mouth, but a sharp glare from Castiel shut him up. He would not ruin this for Dean with a bad joke. “But we’ll properly discuss this again tomorrow, when you’re not high on endorphins. Ok, sweetheart?”
“Seriously though,” Cas added when he put the plate down to grab his mug instead. “I doubt you’re doing anything illegal, so please don’t worry about it.” He drank his coffee, already looking better than when he’d come in. There were still dark circles under his eyes though and Dean wanted to rub them away.
It was Dean‘s turn to flush and drop a fry. He watched Castiel enjoy his food for a few minutes. Cas didn‘t make eye contact, fully engrossed in his burger. So he wasn‘t flirting, he really did like his burger that much. Dean chuckled fondly and picked up his own burger.
Dean put away the parchments he was perched over. “Don’t worry. You can get off at the next port so you won’t be on board when we face him.”
“Yes, much,” Dean replied honestly. Castiel was magic. No wonder people flocked around him. “Thank you.”
“I should have seen it.” Castiel sighed. “I always prided myself on being able to see auras and read people. And I wish I could have built it all up myself, but I am just not good with numbers and forms and the whole business side of things.”
Jimmy came back and knelt on the bed as instructed, eyes on Dean’s ass, where Castiel had kept playing with the first three beads, pushing them in and pulling them back out again. Now that his audience was back, Castiel worked on adding more.
Castiel nodded and folded his hands, not quite sure what kind of prayer might apply right now. But he hoped some vague wishes not to die would be sufficient. When he looked back up, Dean was wielding a sword and getting ready at the railing. Ana was also drawing her dagger and after a grim nod to Castiel, went to join Dean’s side.
Once he had found a good rhythm, Castiel turned it on to a low setting and cursed, “Fuck, that feels good.” He looked at Jimmy and he wasn’t even exaggerating for show. “This is so nice, Jimmy. Man, I wish you could feel it, too. This is almost better than having your cock stroke mine.”
Castiel stumbled back into his apartment with a sigh, feeling drained. He kicked off his shoes and threw his trenchcoat in the direction of the coat hanger, then took off his shirt and tie on his way to the bathroom, throwing them on the ground haphazardly.
Dean leaned up, stealing a kiss and scratching Castiel’s scalp. “Gonna feel better if you move faster.”
“Cas, ever since Sam got married and moved away, we only ever talk on the phone anyway. I can do that from anywhere. And sure, I’d miss Charlie, but I’m sure you two could find a way to let us have virtual movie nights.” Dean knew he was getting carried away a little and they hadn’t even actually talked about their feelings, but…
When Castiel stirred awake, Dean smiled at his grumpy look. “Morning, sunshine.” Castiel’s frown just deeped and Dean chuckled. “We should get an early start and maybe take two trips down into the jungle today. Gather more wood, maybe even find a mammal to eat.”
Dean’s eyes finally lit up. “Yeah, ok. I might like that.” He leaned back to get more comfortable. “We could do a lot of good there. More than here.”
Lastly, he surveyed the sweat lodge. If he’d left it up to Meg, they’d have thrown Dean in there by now, after making sure he was already weak and underfed from his two weeks on nothing but protein bars. But Castiel would much rather build him up than tear him down. He wasn’t a brute. He took care of people, after all. He helped all of his followers become their best selves - and let go of their earthly possessions. They didn’t deserve them.
Castiel almost ducked his head, but instead he stood a little taller. He looked good in his uniform though. He knew that much. “Listen, I’m not going back, but I am proud I made Commander. I earned this uniform.”
“Did you just fuck me to make me loyal to you?” Castiel still needed to know before they proceeded with where this was going.
When Dean returned, the door banged open and Castiel turned around in surprise. Dean seemed surprised to see him still reading, but his expression quickly changed to neutral. “Guess you’ll get a chance to leave sooner rather than later. We should be in Port Fairhaven within a day.”
Dean stirred and turned around in his arms. “Stop thinking so much,” he mumbled, placing a quick kiss on Castiel’s lips.
And he was right in his assessment. As soon as Castiel spotted him, he started running and Dean wisely placed his glass down, because next thing he knew, Castiel had jumped up in his arms. Dean quickly supported him and Castiel wrapped his legs around him, locking tight before kissing him.
Castiel sighed, softening and giving his puppy eyes again. “I know.” He turned towards Dean and reached for him, dropping his hand halfway. Dean looked crushed at the gesture. “I know you’re a good person, Dean. And… and I can only hope that what we have…” He trailed off, reaching again. This time Dean closed the gap before Castiel could pull back, taking his hand in his.
But the Farm was established now. It was a smoothly running operation. He didn’t need a partner anymore. He needed a loyal companion. Someone who showed him the respect he deserved while also being worthy of Castiel’s attention. Someone like Dean. He looked to his right and smiled just as his tea was being served.
He started Wednesday by getting up early and going to the gym again before work. By mid-morning, he was suddenly feeling really woozy. He thought it would surely pass, but by lunch time, he was just barely holding it together. It was time for his juice. He pressed the button on his intercom to call for Castiel, but a glance outside revealed he wasn’t at his desk. He’d probably gone to get his own lunch.
Or maybe he should. Come clean before this went any further. He was lying to Cas and about to spend the night again. After they’d shared that incredible kiss earlier. Dean just wanted to stay here, with Castiel, and just never return to reality. But that wouldn’t be feasible. They’d sent other agents to get Dean out, thinking he’d gotten caught, or worse.
“Oh, shit.” Dean licked his lips. “I knew you were packing, but here we have yet another concealed weapon.” He looked up at Castiel through his lashes and the whole thing was so ridiculous, it startled a laugh out of Castiel.
Not waiting for an invitation, Dean took a hold of Castiel’s wrist, pulling his hand in so he could slowly lick it clean, keeping eye contact with him the whole time and making sure to convey how much he liked it.
he might add. Dean just wanted to hide. This was embarrassing. “I know, Cas.” He covered his face and tried to bite back any follow up jokes his brain threw at him, but… “You’d have a lot more members if it was.” Dean blamed his migraine.
Dean’s breath caught in his throat. He had never seen a Tin Can without their armor on. He wasn’t sure if none ever got captured, or if there was a reason why their appearance was kept classified, so he expected a horribly disfigured monster. He’d certainly pictured them ugly, as did the rest of his battalion. It sure made killing them easier.
Now that Castiel had bandaged his wounds, Dean expected to be sent back out again. To have to find Meg and ask for another job. Or maybe go back to his own room and stay there until it was time for dinner. Instead, Castiel led him back to the large, inviting bed and gently pushed him to sit down on it by his shoulders.
Castiel let out a low whimper and kissed over the bite and then tried to move off, almost slipping out if it hadn’t been for Dean clenching hard to prevent it. Castiel hissed.
“I don’t… I don’t have anything else,” Dean admitted, his fork now clattering to the desk. He looked morose and like he was about to cry.
They didn’t go very deep into the trees this time, staying at the jungle’s edge to collect their supplies. Castiel heard something rustling behind the bushes, and when he looked, he found a family of baby boars. That might explain why the boar had charged them earlier. He briefly felt bad, but an angry growl to his left revealed another adult boar eyeing him. He raised his hands and backed away slowly, thankful when he didn’t get pursued. He’d be loath to kill both parents.
Jimmy smiled and reached over to squeeze his hand. “Me, too.” He turned the laptop back around and hit a few keys. “Together, this time.”
Dean closed his eyes, his breathing evening out to the point Castiel almost thought he’d fallen asleep. “You can ask, too, you know,” Dean finally murmured softly, keeping his eyes shut.
Dean grabbed his coffee and cursed. When he had entered the coffee shop, there were a few free tables - but the people in front of him had nabbed some and just now a group claimed the last free table, which he’d been eyeing, by having half of them sit while the others joined the queue. That wasn‘t fair. Get your coffee and
“Sure,” Dean smiled and eyed the seat across from Castiel and then the crowd in his store. He sighed and squeezed Castiel’s neck before going back to work.
“We’ll see about that,” Jimmy announced, nabbing the plate before Cas had a chance to and running off to their usual spot in the window.
Castiel strode over to him and took the cups out of his hand before he wrapped an arm around him. “Welcome back, Dean.”
Castiel leaned down to place a kiss on Dean’s forehead. “Drink your tea,” he whispered and then got up and left for the bathroom.
He turned around a second too late and was attacked by a ghost that apparently didn’t like him messing with the planks, because it let out a whistle and two more ghosts appeared, trying to drag Castiel overboard. He tried to fight them off, but one of them had a clamp on his arm, so he couldn’t raise the poker.
“Oh, shit,” Dean exclaimed, mouth suddenly dry. Jimmy seemed equally surprised, but quickly got with the program, wrapping his arms around Cas’ back to pull him closer. Dean leaned forward, watching them mesmerized. He had pictured this - of course he had - but his own imagination didn’t do the real thing any justice.
“Wait. What do you take me for? It’s three months not three years.” Dean frowned again. “Maybe I gave you the wrong impression yesterday, but I don’t actually just sleep with random people. I thought we had a connection. That we both felt it.”
Castiel didn’t seem to want an answer to that because he lowered his arms so he could claim Dean’s lips in a kiss, morning breath and all. But they had the same dinner and apparently Castiel didn’t care. And after a few more traded kisses, Dean didn’t even notice it anymore either.
“No sleep just yet,” Castiel warned, reaching over to his nightstand. Castiel fumbled out a condom and a bottle of lube and Dean was suddenly fully alert again.
Dean chuckled and got up, giving Cas a quick kiss and tangling his hands in his hair as soon as he was close enough, messing it up back to its more natural shape. “Better,” he decided.
When he looked at Dean again, silent tears were running down his face and Castiel wondered if she was able to form a connection with Dean in the same way as she could with him.
Castiel didn’t reply but looked Dean over critically, probably making sure he was uninjured and not for sexy reasons. Dean’s pout grew. This morning had started so promisingly.
‘I had you drugged for your first two weeks here, you idiot,’ Castiel thought. “So what you’re saying is, you don’t need me?” He gave Dean a wounded look.
“What?” Dean stood up, walking closer. Castiel was squatting over his pants and… Dean was still dreaming, wasn’t he?
Dean cupped his cheek and then trailed his fingers to the nape of Cas’s neck, pulling him in close. “Get some rest. I’ll call you when I have any news on the case, ok?”
With a smile, Dean trailed his fingertips over Castiel’s chin and up his cheek, admiring his handsome face. After a whole bunch of nasty operations, Dean had lucked out this time. This operation had led him to Cas, and he would forever be grateful.
“Shh,” Castiel rubbed small soothing circles over his back. “It’s ok, Dean. I’m sorry I was so forward. I didn’t mean to freak you out. Just forget what I said, ok?”
Dean nodded. “I’ll call.” He put the bean back in the bowl, appetite probably gone for now. Castiel blamed himself for telling him too early. “Thank you,” Dean added. “I’ll tell you how it went, uhm, after.”
“Ah, but it isn’t anymore, is it?” Odin tapped her fingernails on his small table. They were long and painted a dark red. He wondered how she could even properly code with those. It required fast typing.
“I need to see those before you use them,” Castiel growled, suddenly a lot closer to where Dean had been trying to hide.
Well, according to his editor he was, but Dean himself wanted to write about the whole experience. The world didn’t need another article praising the elusive Castiel’s genius.
Apparently the driver knew where Castiel wanted to go, because the tinted window was pulled up before they even spoke. “That part of the Castiel experience?” Dean asked.
? The crimes,” Dean clarified. Whatever Cas was about to say, it definitely wouldn’t be making sense to him. He was too dumb for this.
“Yeah, but...” Dean shrugged. Alright. He assumed somebody would go over Castiel’s answers afterwards and edit out what Dean wasn’t allowed to use. “Do you mind if I record this?” He pulled out his recorder, about to put it on the table.
Castiel closed his eyes and allowed himself to let go and just focus on all of the sensations Dean was literally wringing out of him. Dean, who
“Priorities,” Dean replied, reaching out and messing up Castiel’s hair. Though Castiel had a feeling it was already pretty messy before he got to it. “Though I guess all is lost on that mop of yours.”
Castiel didn’t laugh. “Dean, if you’re still making jokes to deflect, you’re obviously not ready yet.”
“Because you’re more motivated since we kissed?” Dean chuckled. If Castiel started accompanying him on supply runs again, they could kiss a lot more often.
Damn, Dean would have liked to avoid this question. “Uhm, a shake, usually. Or like… a smoothie.” Something green with added protein powder.
everyone on this compound. Part of him wanted to run as far away as possible before he ultimately got hurt, but the rest of him was happy to stay and soak it up for as long as it lasted.
Castiel sighed and passed a hand over his face, looking at Dean in consideration. “Guess I’ll have to talk eventually.” He took another sip of coffee, looking around and then adding some whiskey from a small flask to his cup. Dean didn’t comment on it. “My parents kicked me out when they caught me with another boy. Inias’ parents took me in.”
“Nonsense,” Castiel protested. “I’m here to listen to whatever you have to say.” He reached for his quilt and wrapped it around Dean. In response, Dean pulled his legs up on the couch and turned so he sat with his back to Castiel’s side. This felt unsatisfying and Castiel propped up a few pillows for himself before he laid down as well, legs around Dean but Dean back in his arms.
Anna smiled and the two of them shared a passionate kiss. Dean actually felt a little uncomfortable witnessing it because it felt really intimate. Anna placed her hand on the girl‘s cheek. “Wait for me. I‘ll be right back,“ she promised and slapped her on her ass before she went back on stage with the other two for their encore.
“Lady, if nobody comes forward, we can’t investigate.” She was definitely grating on him now. He prided himself on being impartial and seeing patterns when others wouldn’t. But there was still no databank for people with magic, so how was he supposed to know which victims were part of that community and which were normal? Before now he didn’t even realize there was such a big community. Castiel was the only not-normal guy he had contact with and he’d never mentioned…
Dean preened. “Same. Your website definitely helped keep me afloat.” Castiel’s eyes must have dimmed a little, because Dean quickly added, “And business aside, you know how much you mean to me.”
Dean snorted and went to make his coffee. Jimmy watched him work, leaning over the counter a little to get a better look. Dean caught his gaze when he turned to get his brownie. “Identical twins alright.”
Dean was speechless once again. Castiel carefully took his bandaged hand and started to lead him out of the room. Because neither of them had gotten undressed the day before, they could just go. “Thank you, Castiel,” he finally got out, just as they left his quarters.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Dude, I’m not five.” He made his way to the bathroom quickly though. “What happened to caring for me while I’m sick?” Dean mumbled before closing the door.
Castiel still worried, though. Anna would have to fly all the way from Eden, but any random soldier fighting nearby could be given orders to take a detour to kill them. Castiel looked up into the sky reflexively, but it was clear; nothing but the two suns shining down on them.
Cas raised his eyebrow, but stuck out his tongue, twirling it around Jimmy’s finger to get a small lick of the frosting, before sucking the whole finger between his lips, looking straight at Dean as he sucked it clean. And Dean’s brain just sort of short circuited.
“Don’t worry about me.” Dean took a hold of Cas’ hand and led it away from his shirt. He didn’t let go when their arms were down but kept holding on. “Tell me what happened?”
Dean came over to collect his mug for a refill just as he was laughing over a sneaky cat tormenting a poor dog. He leaned closer to watch the video with him and chuckled, the sound reverberating through his chest close to Castiel’s ear and it was the most beautiful sound.
So they mostly chatted in the one hour Castiel would’ve spent reading before going to bed with a few random chats in between. It worked out fine. And since it was late enough for Balthazar to not randomly open a video chat and check in on him, they could even progress in a more naughty way to use their video chats. - Castiel refused to ever again talk about the one time they were getting there and Balthazar did a random check-in in the first week.
“Oh,” Castiel nodded. Yeah. It made sense. He could read Latin. He was useful. But he’d probably be sleeping in his own bed again. Because Dean only fucked him to make sure he… What? Stayed loyal to him? To have leverage on him? But hadn’t it been a risky move on Dean’s part? Castiel could have pushed him away and specifically gotten him jailed for it. It didn’t make sense to him why Dean had made the first move.
“So, you don’t want us to share?” Cas asked, sounding unsure enough that Dean could tell this wasn’t about the cupcake. Dean squeezed the bridge of his nose. They’d talked about it. Multiple times. Initially they’d decided it was too early to mess around. Their relationship had only just started and they had a lot of lost time spent pining to make up for. Adding Jimmy had just seemed too messy. Besides, he could tell that Cas himself wasn’t ready yet. But it’s been months. The twins seemed to be on great terms. They should have the talk again.
Castiel barked a laugh. “Listen, you do look like you’re good at it. And it would take the edge off, but...” Castiel cocked his head. “Hm. Well, I suppose it would take the edge off.”
The girls in the kitchen were especially eager to chat and even initiated the conversation for a change. After he’d told them about hurting his hands and Castiel basically saving him from Meg, he discovered that they all hated Meg.
“I’m gonna buy you at least 30 minutes if you promise to finish that sandwich and recover. I’d also give you a Snickers, but…” Castiel trailed off when Dean recoiled. “Yeah. Call me if you need anything.” He turned to leave but then stopped and squeezed Dean’s shoulder. “I mean it, Dean. Press the button. I’m just outside.”
“Yes,” Cas reassured him, nuzzling in and kissing the side of Dean’s lips. “Anything you want, Dean.”
Castiel reached out to free Dean’s lip from his teeth like in the first few days and smiled ruefully. “It was all a lie. I failed in my mission to help, instead I… I got them scammed of their money and… and drugged.” He hung his head, trying to press out a few more tears.
Castiel was nervous. Jimmy had called Anael and told her that he’d found a very interesting piece of information on Odin and he’d rather discuss it with her privately before he turned it in. It had worked. She agreed to meet him in his hotel room that night. Neither of them mentioned the fact that Anael was supposed to be back at their field office, which was several hours away.
All too soon they reached the destination. The car was parking in the handicapped spot of a motel and a quick interview with the bored clerk manning the check-in desk revealed the room they should be staying in. They didn’t even have to flash their badges.
There was nobody else left on their floor and Castiel wouldn’t be surprised if the whole building was empty besides them and the night guard. This was getting ridiculous. Castiel got up and knocked on Dean’s office door, not waiting for a reply before marching straight in. “Mr. Winch…” he cut himself off. “Dean,” he continued, pleased to see Dean smile at him. He’d only recently asked Castiel to call him by his first name and it was still taking some getting used to.
They still needed to have a proper talk tomorrow, but for now they were definitely forgiven. After all, the whole fiasco was finally getting him a cat.
“Of course not.” Castiel followed the detective to his car, a beautiful old Chevy Impala, and he couldn’t help but stroke the hood appreciatively before he got in. A gesture not missed by Dean, who smirked in silent reply.
Dean wasn’t sure what it was, but Castiel basically commanding him to leave seemed to have given his brain permission to shut up about it and let him go home without a bad conscience at leaving work behind. Castiel had a point. It would still wait for him tomorrow. And he couldn’t even remember the last time when he’d actually finished all his tasks for the day before having to give up from sheer exhaustion, because as soon as he’d finished one task, two more seemed to pop up in a new email.
Meanwhile, they all risked getting breakfast in the diner across the street. They’d leave here soon enough and not come back. Dean got into an argument with Garth, who vehemently refused to go with anyone he didn’t know. And he didn’t trust the police in general. Dean tried to convince him and even threatened him, because as witness to a crime he wasn’t allowed to leave state lines, but Garth countered that there had been no crime and he wasn’t pressing charges and he’d deny everything.
“No,” Castiel repeated. “Do you even listen to yourself? He expects to be broken. Hell, he’s used to it. I looked him up.” Castiel still had connections from when he created his own new identity. Wasn’t too hard to find out that his last name wasn’t Smith, but Winchester. Coming from a family of cops, his mother having died in duty very early, Dean’s one rebellious act against his father had been to join the FBI academy instead of the police force.
“No, it’s a partner card. It’s linked to my account.” Dean shrugged like it was no big deal, but he started to avoid direct eye contact again.
Dean shook his head. “Probably best if Henriksen doesn’t see you. I need to break this to him gently.”
Castiel straightened his posture, somehow proud that he’d earned Dean’s trust. Finally. After at least five cases together. But usually Castiel just met him once, touched the clothes of the victim, related what he saw and then left again. “The only other person in this picture that I know is Garth.” He felt duty bound to share this now.
Ah. But there was definitely a reason. Nothing the FBI should get involved in, though. Most definitely not domestic terrorism. Castiel has never been a black hat, even if he definitely had the skills for it and could use the money. But no matter what…
With another curse on his lips, Castiel sat up and threw off his shirt and then wiggled out of his pants and socks. He could feel Dean doing the same next to him. “Didn’t realize I was that tired,” Castiel admitted.
“No.” Castiel slowly slid the evidence back in his folder to keep it safe. He left the pictures out for emphasis. It was working, because Dean kept looking at them, all his former cockiness forgotten.
When Castiel was done running through salutations three times, he faced Dean, whose expression went from serene to terrified within seconds.
“Did it work?” Castiel asked, watching Dean, who still had his eyes glued to the TV, a sad smile on his lips.
Castiel raised his eyebrow as he prepared the toothbrush, daring Dean to complain. But Dean just met his eyes through the bathroom mirror. “You gonna brush for me, too?” He snarked.
Cas snorted and closed his laptop. “Cute.” Dean looked up at him with a smirk and Castiel chuckled, shaking his head. So much trouble, the both of them. “Alright, come here,” Cas crooked his finger. “Crawl.”
Castiel had fought for years to get an honorable discharge, only to keep getting denied. In the end, it took getting shot in a way that looked too much like he’d been suicidal for the brass to release him. He hadn’t been truly suicidal; it had just been an honest accident, but he could feel himself heading that way, so he gladly accepted the easy out of a medical discharge.
“If you want, we can go to an actual island instead? Not to work, just to… spend the rest of our days on the beach?” Castiel offered. He might as well disclose his funds to Dean.
Dean nodded, stone in hand and carefully examining the suit, familiarizing himself with the structure. He hesitantly touched Castiel’s thigh again; the suit didn’t zap him so he kept investigating with his fingers until he was satisfied. Then Dean took aim—from a lot lower than Castiel had been about to—and carefully smashed the stone into a crease.
