He slowly ate his way through his plate of salty chips, a sip of his tea every now and then. He was nearing the end of his plate when a man -with ginger hair John noticed- sat right next to him.
Silence falls upon the both of them and John can't take it anymore. He buries his face into his hands and he lets out a wet sob. God, he can't believe what Sherlock did.
John clambered off Sherlock, shivering at the newfound chill in the air and put Rosie back into his arms. Sherlock folded and picked up the discarded blanket and turned on a torch; the three of them making their way out of the kitchen and into Sherlock’s bedroom, guided by the dim light.
“That’s enough to go on, don’t you think?” The other man smiles smugly and continues his saunter out the door, but pauses right before his head leaves the room, “The name’s Sherlock Holmes, and the address is 221B Baker Street. Afternoon!” And with a wink, the other man is gone.
All the furniture was gone. No chairs, no tables, no desks, no lamps, no nothing. Only pictures on the wall, a refrigerator, an unplugged telly, papers scattered around the room, and hopefully a bed.
The man had a deep American accent, and at first, it had confused John. He didn't understand why, but it felt… off.
“No.” The man flashed his empty ring finger on his left hand. The place where a red ring would be if he had met his soulmate.
Note: I just realized that I had many typos... My iPhone typing skills aren't the best, so I've moved to my laptop!
John clenches his eyes shut and squeezes his hand into fists. Sherlock's death hurts more than William’s death does. Which, in a way, makes sense. He hisses a shaky breath between his teeth and feels a sharp pain in his left hand and he looks down at it. His soulmate mark seems to be brighter.
Later that afternoon, after they both had cooked and consumed pancakes (which almost had ended up as a glop of batter on the kitchen floor if John hadn't caught the bowl), and washed up, Sherlock, John, and Rosie all bundled up into their coats and took a walk around Regents Park.
He tries to break through but finds the wood branches too heavy. He reaches into his pockets to find something sharp but groans when he can’t feel anything.
That seems to be an explanation enough for Rosie and she grabs one of the tissue paper crowns and hands it to Sherlock. Sherlock puts it on his head, “Is Daddy going to put on his tissue paper hat too?”
He shook his head. When was he ever going to get over this paranoia of his? He couldn't flip out every time someone said, 'good luck’ to him. He let out a deep breathe.
In the end, he decided on a cup of tea and a plate of chips. Cheap enough so he could afford it, but also fathoms better than the rations he had on base.
ran through his head, he still worried. He still... he still cared for John. And it drove him insane not knowing where John was. He wasn't used to not knowing, and he didn't like it. Not one bit.
Sherlock’s head snapped to Mrs. Hudson and  John cocked his head in confusion, “What do you mean you didn’t come here last night? When I woke up this morning, all the wrapping paper and the dirty mugs were gone,” he turned to Sherlock, “did you do it, Sherlock?”
The man’s low voice brought him back to the situation, “Are you going you help my arm, or are you going to stand there? I don’t got all day.”
John smiled one last time at William and tried to embed his face into his memory. He slipped the scarf over his mouth again, “Goodbye, William. If all goes well, I’ll see you next year.”
Sherlock looks down, “In saving my life, she conferred a value on it. It is a currency I do not know how to spend.”
The kitchen, like the living room, had its lights off and candles shining brightly. But in the middle of the room, there was a table (he didn’t recognize as theirs), in the middle of the room with two steaming plates of pasta. Sherlock stood in front of him leaning back against the table, wearing a tight purple button-up shirt. The buttons strained against his chest and it made John's throat go dry.
Sherlock nodded and turned swiftly away to put the kettle on, carefully selecting two mugs from the shelve. The rest was a simple process, and within ten minutes they were both sitting in their armchairs, sipping mugs of tea; Rosie cuddled on John’s lap, sleeping peacefully. The two of them sitting in comfortable silence. John didn’t seem to mind the wrapping paper, and if he did, he didn’t mention it. Sherlock supposed it was because after living with Sherlock for nearly four years, he got used to perpetual mess.
Sherlock briskly walked in front of Lestrade, "I figured it out last night. William Smith attacked John because he wanted money he couldn't obtain."
Fortunately, Rosie stopped when she noticed Sherlock. Letting go of the book, much to John’s relief, her innocent eyes widened and she giggled and hobbled her way to Sherlock, “Sh‘lock!”
“Well, we’re soulmates, we’re both only here temporarily, and we both have to leave soon. It would be nice if we could meet again, you know?”
"I have to show you in the car, Sherlock. Believe it or not, some things are meant to be confidential."
Rosie picks up the oversized tissue paper crown and places it on her head, “Daddy, Daddy, it’s you and Sher’rocks turn!”
“Oh please. Where are you getting your evidence? Conclusions based on guesses are little to never correct.”
He managed to make out that all the furniture was still gone, but the couch had been returned to its place against the wall, and all the clutter of Sherlock’s papers were gone. Stepping cautiously forward to investigate the room, he felt something soft under his feet and stopped. He looked down to see a cluster of rose petals that extended into a messy, rosy line, leading into the kitchen.
His life keeps collapsing right in front of his eyes. Just as he thinks he has a grasp on it, it slips from between his fingers, like grains of sand.
John thanked the man and took the glass willingly, drinking it slowly until the rain stopped about an hour later. He thanked the bartender again and set out back for 221B. When he was three blocks away from it, he felt his mobile buzz.
“Are you sure, you’re ok with this Mary?” John fiddles with his hands and looks down at the red mark on this left hand.
She smiled and walked out the back door as John turned his attention back to a stack of dirty glasses in his hand, debating whether he should put them in the room behind him with the sink, or wash them now.
It was three weeks after John had left 221B at 2 AM when Greg Lestrade, (who was sleeping quite peacefully he might add) got the call. He blearily reached for his mobile, mumbling about the ungodly hour, "Hello. DI Lestrade speaking."
John laughed. He didn't really understand what he liked about this man, but he couldn't deny that he didn't, “You know what mate? Against my better judgment, I like you. What's your name?”
Thank you for everyone who read this story and gave kudos! This was a great first fanfiction experience and I'll keep writing!
John giggles and watches Sherlock take off his left glove and lifts out his hand. (It's odd, as the proper handshake etiquette is with your right hand, but John doesn't mind.)
“Please what? What do you want John?” Sherlock let his finger slowly trace up John's hardening length.  John sobbed and thrust his hips into the air, desperately seeking friction,
The room is different from the last time he has seen it. The bed is rumpled (most likely because of Janine and him doing… things he doesn’t really want to think about), some of the pictures that Sherlock had are gone, and the bedsheets are a different color. But the beloved Judo certificate and Periodic Table of Elements picture are still there.
"Yeah. Shaking a gin martini just ends up bruising the gin," he huffed a laugh, "as cool as James Bond is-"
"The fridge? You mean the one with the rotting human head and human eyeballs?" John through the bag of food at Sherlock, "Put the damn things in the fridge yourself."
It's a thought that has been plaguing him for the last two days when he found Sherlock bleeding out on the ground of Magnussen's office. Only a millimeter away from death, and, oh god, what would happen if Sherlock had died? What would John do? What would-
He sees the spark of wood before he feels it. John’s eyes widen in horror as he watches the fire spread up the wood.
Sherlock snapped around and slammed the door. Lestrade sat down on the floor, his head in his hands, "'It can wait?' People's lives can wait? God, Sherlock can't think without John."
Right before he reaches the door, John speaks. In for a penny, in for a pound, “You know, Christmas can also be a time to make amends with people. People who can be… important to you.”
Rosie and Sherlock pull on each side, and John can tell that Sherlock lets Rosie get the larger half.
Twenty-five minutes later, John found himself at the bar as Mary gave him a gist of how things worked. He tried to memorize the things as she went.
while there’s still a chance because that chance doesn’t last forever. Trust me, Sherlock, it’s gone before you know it. Before you know it.” And John isn’t sure if he’s talking about Mary anymore.
John shifted the scarf that was covering his mouth and peered left, right, and made a mad dash into the entrance; making sure his hood covered most of his hair.
Why, he did not know, and frankly, didn’t have the time to figure it out. He threw the sheets off himself and hurriedly threw on a random set of clothes that laid in the bathroom and looked decent enough for his work. Unfortunately, in his frenzy of “hurry up and get to work before Sarah fires me”, he slipped on the wet tiles,
“So; Sherlock’s going to his parents for Christmas huh?” Lestrade laughs and takes a sip of his pint, “Never thought I’d see the day when the twat actually celebrated.”
Once John was stretched enough to accept Sherlock’s cock, he experimentally curved his fingers every so slightly, knowing he had brushed John’s prostate when John moaned wantonly against the sheets and let out a stream of curses. Sherlock repeated his action, eliciting louder moans out of John as John's hips twitched helplessly.
“Who you thought I was,” John’s vaguely realized that he’s started to talk to Mary, instead of Sherlock, “is the man who I
Sherlock nodded and began to scan the screen as he watched; his expression unreadable to Mycroft and Lestrade. Once the footage ended Mycroft spoke, "I have been able to identify the attacker using the footage. Like I said before, it was incredibly easy."
Lestrade nodded and exited the room, leaving only Sherlock and John. They stared at each other for a few seconds,
The next day, let’s just say, when Sherlock and John went back to 221B, Mrs. Hudson was waiting for them, asking them if they still needed two bedrooms.
"Oh shut up," John snapped, leaning on the counter, "warn a man next time before you speak to them, would you?" He grabbed his cane and stood up straight.
“And that’s how I knew the son was the one who slipped bleach into her husband’s drink, therefore killing him,” finished Sherlock.
John jumped into action, pinning the man’s uninjured arm to the nearby wall. (Murderer or not, John wasn’t a police officer, and he would not like to be sued for causing extreme damage to an already broken arm)
But then, it hit him. Sherlock hadn’t ever changed, had he? John had been living for the past few months, assuming that Sherlock was changing. Just a little by little, even. But this; this showed he really hadn’t, “Sod this. Sod this. You stay here if you want; on your
Sherlock followed Lestrade into the building, passing security until they reached a door, "William Smith is in here. Now, no matter how angry you get, Sherlock, don't injure or murder this guy, ok?"
"I assure you that now is a more desirable time. I have a case for you and I be under the impression that my brother would like to hear this as soon as possible."
They both giggle like children on a playground, and John half-heartedly chides Sherlock, “Stop! We can't giggle, it's a crime scene,” John finds himself and Sherlock giggling some more, “Stop it!”
A feminine voice rang out behind them, sliding into their conversation, "I think this man is allowed to see John Watson." Their heads snapped around to see Anthea, standing there, perfectly calm.
They’re sat across from each other in their respective (blackened) armchairs. 221B around them has crumbled walls, the floors are covered in debris, and their both waiting for the cleaning service.  Sherlock’s drinking a cup of coffee from Speedy’s, and John’s twiddling a pen in his hand.
“Yay!” Rosie opens the cracker and takes the piece of paper, “Ah, Sher’rock? Could you read this for me, please?”
Sherlock nodded and settled down to the right of John. John set Rosie to the other side of the couch and made sure to wrap Rosie with one blanket, and himself and Sherlock with another one. After the two of them had settled into the couch, John had started the conversation; Asking Sherlock about any recent cases he had. Sherlock quickly went into an elaborate explanation of a case that had involved a wife, her husband’s murder, and that the killer was really their nineteen-year-old son who had been posing as innocent.
“Bee!” She exclaimed. She grabbed the bee and held it tight to her chest. If anything that had rubbed off of Sherlock and onto Rosie, it was his love for bees.
The other man stared at him oddly for a hot second but it disappeared as he school his features, “I probably shouldn't say. People could hear me.”
John wakes up in the middle of the night, (which was probably 6 AM) groggy and sleep-addled. The air in the room is cold, and he shivers and pulls his blanket tighter. He expects to meet soft cotton, but instead, he feels something smoother, and less soft. Almost like skin.
"I was about to. Blythe was about to hand William the money until Blythe was arrested about a month ago."
It triggers an awareness in John. Everything that Sherlock had been doing, while it seemed selfish, or manipulative on the surface, it was just Sherlock trying to help him. It gave John an inner look into Sherlock’s heart. It suddenly makes John feel like an arsehole. All along Sherlock had been helping and he’d been constantly accusing him and belittling him.
"What?" The question came out, dangerously grounded, in a way that would scare any person        -criminal or not- away.
“Don’t play-” he grunted as the man manage to knee him in the gut, “-don’t play innocent with me. You have murdered three people already and have injured plenty more.”
John gave out his wrist and Sherlock adeptly put the new silver watch on John's wrist. He let go of John's wrist and watched with delight as John admired the watch.
“Would you mind not mentioning those parts of my name? There’s a reason why I tend to use ‘Sherlock Holmes’, and not, ‘William Sherlock Scott Holmes.’”
He hummed as he felt Sherlock’s nimble fingers slowly massage his tense muscles into relaxation and leaned into Sherlock sleepily as he felt Sherlock follow his fingers with little kisses that traveled past his shoulder and down his neck. He was on the edge of sleep when he felt Sherlock’s hand slowly move down to his hips and onto his thighs. His eyes popped open and his cheeks burned red while Sherlock’s hand journeyed to his inner thighs. Movie forgotten, he turned and grabbed Sherlock’s upper arms,  hungrily attacking Sherlock with his lips.
A few minutes passed in comfortable silence, whilst the two of them finished their tea. John shifting Rosie on his lap every few seconds.
The next day, he and John were back on the dock. Sherlock turned his head to John and felt a swell of happiness and love in his chest.
Sherlock holds up his hand and John scowls, “I don't want to know why else you thought it, because I’m not going to dye my hair ginger. The first time was-” Sherlock freezes.
Did he want to become flatmates with this so-called Sherlock Holmes? He seemed dangerous, mysterious, and trouble. Exactly the things Ella thought he should avoid when he moved back to London. Exactly the things anyone else would avoid.
John frowned in minute disappointment, until an idea popped into his head, “That’s alright. Just something to look forward too.”
William pocketed the bills (John frowned in confusion, but immediately forgot about it), “I will. And Thank You. I hope I find them too.”
Sherlock faintly smiled at the memory. He might’ve not understood sentiment then. And he didn’t. Sentiment is ridiculous. But he would be lying if he said he had never felt sentiment.
“Oh god. We’re a mess, Sherlock. You tried to give me the things you thought I wanted, but all I really wanted is you,” he groans, “what are we
John giggles drunkenly and he looks down at his left hand, trying to check the time. Instead of the time, he sees the red circle on his ring finger. “Sherlock?”
John looked around and crinkled his nose as a smell hit him. It smelled like old grapes, yeast, and a sewer all mixed up in a horrible concoction.
That day was great at the surgery for John. Well, there were still some difficult patients who had been protesting that they were fine. (Which was, in his opinion, was idiotic. It was their choice to come to the surgery. They came to the surgery, meaning that they weren’t feeling 'fine.')
Rosie tore open the wrapping paper and (with the help from Sherlock) opened the box. It was a stuffed bee.
That was the final thing Sherlock heard from John before John had stormed out of 221B. Sherlock presumed that John would return that night. Or the next day; but John didn't.
John raised his eyebrows and stared at him in disbelief, “What’s the point of lying about your appearance?”
The older man glared at Sherlock and silenced as Sherlock continued, “Good. Now, where was I? Right, you were incredibly drunk when you attacked Dr. Watson. The little scratch marks on his leg? They could only be done with a shard of a beer bottle; the scratches were too crooked to be anything else. If you were sober, you would've made long lacerations on his leg, but you made short shallow cuts, showing that you couldn't think straight. Not mentioning the cloddish way you hit him with a metal pole, and how you didn't even break the security cameras nearby. Both facts pointing to that you were drunk, really, the only reason you aren't dead right now was that you managed to knock Dr. Watson unconscious," Sherlock leaned against the table till their faces were nearly touching and his voice turned into a low, dangerous growl, "and honestly, I wouldn't care if you were. Because you injured a person I care about; and people who hurt the people I care about, shouldn’t get off as easy as you did."
They both stand in silence, and John tries not to think that this is the last time in a very long time that they will talk.
The walls were a simple white, and the foyer was lit with a dimmed, tremendous chandelier that must've cost thousands and thousands of pounds. The staircase that winded up on both sides was a lush coffee-colored color, and the draped windows at the top let a few rays of sunlight fill the room, giving it a calmer atmosphere. He could hear the hushed voice of a receptionist conversing with guests and the small clatter of silverware. Suddenly he felt self-conscious in his -rather cheap- suit and ran a hand through his unkempt, brown, hair.
John stared at Sherlock, "That wasn't your fault Sherlock. Really, it's my fault. I should've never left in the first place. It wasn't your fault, really."
“What do you mean?” John knew that this was a sort of invasion of privacy, but he had wanted to know what happened with Sherlock’s soulmate for years.
“What are you smiling about?” John couldn’t help asking. Sherlock didn’t smile unless something extremely exciting happened. Like a triple homicide with the doors locked from the inside and no correlation between the victims.
Sherlock took a sip of his coffee, “I might, I might not. Though I have the sneaking suspicion you wouldn’t want me to.”
“Oh god no,” the other man shook his head, “I would rather do anything than join the CIA or anything like it. When they meddle, all they do is cause chaos.”
The digital clock on the wall blinked the red digits while he collapsed into the wall, sighing with relief. He wouldn’t get told off for being late, a huge boulder he had managed to avoid. Except, that was not the case. As it turns out, being 24 seconds early is still considered late and still deserves a yelling about being on time. It also deserves a scolding on being, ’decent for work,’
It was 9 PM by the time John had finished shopping at Tesco and came back to 221B. Trudging up the stairs with his “groceries” he flung the door open to 221B, only to find that the lights were turned off. John flicked the lights and gaped at the sight.
The other man nods as if to say, ‘that’s right,’ “I’ve got my eye on a nice little place in Central London. Together, we ought to be able to afford it. We’ll meet there tomorrow evening, at 7 o’clock. Sorry, got to dash, I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.”
“You said this was a holiday.” Sherlock paused, “This was your idea, wasn’t it? I can’t imagine anyone else convincing me to go on holiday.”
Sherlock cut him off, "I think it is certainly my 'damn business'. Now, you better shut up before I break a few promises and punch you in the face right now."
Greg winced at Sherlock's messy state. His wrinkled robe was hanging loose on his gaunt frame and there were dark circles under his eyes, contrasting against his too pale skin. He had forgotten how poorly Sherlock took care of himself before John came along.
What made that day so great was the fact that Elise had apologized for yelling at him, the American GP that he had met the day before had become incredibly invested in the cases Sherlock and John had solved, the person who had permanently stained his shirt with coffee had gotten him a new shirt, and people kept passing by and smiling at him.
Sherlock gesticulated in frustration, “The case was about a baseball coach luring a group of unaware red-headed players into participating in a plot to distract from a bank robbery!”
“The ocean’s beautiful, isn’t it?” Sherlock watched as John sat down next to him, pushing his sunglasses up off his eyes.
“Forgive me, but you are doing yourself a disservice. I have known many people in this world but made few friends, and I can safely say-”
John placed the medium sized box from under the small Christmas tree in front of her. It had little candy canes on the wrapping paper and was labelled, “To: Rosie, From: Santa.” The wrapping paper was exactly 8’ by 12’. It had been under the small tree for two weeks now. Sherlock should know. He and John had chosen and wrapped Rosie’s gift from “Santa.”
Good luck, John reflected, a bit unsettled. Not the best thing you want to hear on the first day on the job. And the way Molly had said it, almost as she knew something was wrong-
He collapses against the back of the cab back seat. No, he can't think about that right now. What he has to think about is his just going back to Baker Street and getting a few of Sherlock’s things.
John wearily sat down in his chair. After a morning of treating a woman who thought she broke her ankle, (but it was just a sprain) a boy with the flu, a girl with a broken arm, and a few cases of the stomach flu (two of which weren’t very pretty), he was certainly looking forward to his lunch break. He stared at the digital clock until it hit 12:15, then closed it with relief. No dealing with any patients, angry bosses, or any angry GPs for another twenty-five minutes.
It’s a rare happening, John saying that little three-word phrase. He’s only said it once before, and he knows that Sherlock knows because he immediately stills. John is momentarily worried, but then Sherlock just smiles.
Nevertheless, the world had other plans for him. Because within two hours, his good mood was crushed; by a thirty-one-year-old male with black slicked hair cradling a broken arm and a severely injured ankle. When John had asked him how he had broken his arm, all he got as an answer of, “I tripped,” and when John asked how he tripped, he got a, “None of your fucking business.” Which John had huffed at and distracted himself with the medical history of the man.
dangerous. Trust you to fall for a sociopath.” John almost laughs at his own hypocrisy. Marrying an ex-assassin, falling for Sherlock, and all, “ but she’s… you know.“
His twenty-five-minute lunch break, in fact, was sadly not even twenty-five minutes. His lunch break was ten minutes since Sarah wanted to introduce John to a brown-haired, man; a new GP from America. It had been filled with awkward introductions and pleasant conversation between the two men. Therefore, when John had walked back to his office to see a new patient, he was in a lighter mood and ready to finish the day with a lighter tone.
The name clicked in his brain; he had seen the name in the case file Sherlock had thrust in his face only last night. (A triple homicide, Sherlock had been thrilled.) But Howard Mossle wasn’t a victim… no, he wasn’t. In fact, Sherlock had been yelling over the phone with Lestrade about how Howard Mossle was the murderer.
With a flash, Sherlock spins around and John’s back is being pressed against his chair by Sherlock’s bow on his chest, “There. Is. No. One. Else.” Each word is punctuated with a thrust of the bow again his chest, “Do. You. Understand?”
John meets a woman. She just started working at the clinic less than a month ago and is sweet, funny, witty, polite, and very respectable. She’s everything Sherlock was not. Sherlock was everything she isn’t.
Light footsteps echo through the large room and off the wooden columns. The footsteps stop right behind him. A soft hand lands on his shoulder.
"Hey, Sherlock? You know how you asked that if you told me something I couldn't tell anyone, I wouldn't?"
“But wouldn’t your…” John nods down to the man’s left ring finger, where a visible red circumcised it at the bottom. Not that he minded, or was bitter about the other man finding his soulmate (ok, maybe he was, but that was no one’s business), but he was mainly concerned that he was walking into a situation that he really didn’t want to deal with.
Faint knocks were heard at the door, summoning Sherlock to it. He hauled himself out of his chair, his thin robe swishing behind him; he placed the silver wrapped box on the bookshelf and continued his way to the door. It was presumably Mrs Hudson. No client would ever be here on Christmas Eve, especially in the freezing weather. He opened the door,
He climbed into Sherlock’s lap to get better leverage, grounding his hips onto Sherlock’s, taking advantage of the gasp that escaped Sherlock to enter his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth, their tongues’ dancing around each other; both men groaning when their tongues touched.
Who managed to accidentally splash five cups of scalding coffee all over John. Staining his clothes and burning his already hurting shoulder.
They could’ve stayed there forever, lips conjoined together, body’s connected like two pieces of a puzzle-
“Thank you-" John pauses and smiles, "thank you for making Rosie’s Christmas fun this year. I know you haven’t celebrated for a long time, but she really enjoyed it.”
"Mycroft told me to come here to meet up with you. William Smith is in this prison," Lestrade motioned to the building behind him, "currently locked up."
John reluctantly unpinned Howard and turned to Elise,“But he’s not innocent! This man has murdered three people already, and can murder more-”
Carefully, he inserted the key into the lock and stepped inside. He knows Mrs. Hudson isn’t in, as he just saw her at the hospital, so he skips his usual hello to Mrs. Hudson and and climbs up into his old flat.
Mary places a hand on John’s arm, who’s sitting on the couch, clenching his fist, “Look, there could’ve been a reason.”
“Well then, William. I really can’t say my name either, as I’m technically not supposed to be here,” William raised an eyebrow in amusement, “but it's nice to meet you.” John slipped off the glove of his right hand and extended his arm out to William to shake.
Sherlock groaned, “Fine, yes. I concede. It was creative. It was hardly scientific, nor did it illuminate the actual process, but yes, it was
John let out a rush of air in relief and turned to his cup of tea. He slipped the scarf off his mouth, and carefully, with two hands, grabbed the small cup and took a little sip. He exhaled a sigh of pleasure. It felt like it had been years since he had a proper cuppa. It most likely had been. Speaking of good food… John took a chip. Greasy, oily, thick, but hot, delicious, and reminded him of England.
“What if we try?” John suggests, and Sherlock peers up at John, “I… I want to try, Sherlock. Do you?”
Sherlock chuckled as he watched John and Rosie wrestle over the book. He made his way over to the kitchen and poured a mug coffee into a new mug. The mugs that they had used yesterday were in the sink, clean. He frowned in confusion but figured that John had cleaned them. He always did like to be tidy.
Lestrade let out a laugh, "Thanks, I think we're going to need it. I've a feeling he's not going to be that cooperative.” Lestrade waved goodbye and got in his police car while John turned to the surgery, a smile spreading across his face.
He stepped inside and set his coat in his old armchair while Sherlock closed the door behind him. He cleared his throat, “Tea?”
Hips stuttering and muscles clenching, John screamed Sherlock's name as he came all over the bedsheets and his chest, pleasure exploding in his eyelids. Sherlock followed soon after, groaning
It was a silver watch. Sherlock fidgeted in anticipation as John observed it. Sherlock must've spent hours and hours trying to pick it out. He had gone to every shop he could think of, trying to find the perfect gift. "Do you like it?"
"Please Lestrade, use your brain. William was working in the background, making sure to hide his tracks."
“The man you saw yesterday, Howard Mossle; I heard from your boss that you had pinned him to the wall, accusing him of murder.”
John gasped as he felt an -almost- electric spark run down from where their hands met, up his arm, and down to his left hand.
John smiled at him with kind eyes and a broad smile that Sherlock adored. He opened his mouth to speak, "I love-"
John woke up again alone in the bed, but unlike that day before, he woke up on time to the ringing of his alarm clock that had appeared back on the floor, surprisingly working. He would have to thank Sherlock for that…
The only man who was patient enough to stay with Sherlock every day, and the man who was brave and kind enough to save Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock opened the door to his bedroom and John set Rosie down on the bed; taking off her shoes and his while Sherlock busied himself making a makeshift pillow out of a blanket for Rosie. Once Rosie was settled in between the covers of the bed, Sherlock and John slipped in on either side of her. Sherlock looked at John with half-lidded eyes and watched while John slowly fell asleep, the rise and fall of his chest, and pressed a chaste kiss to John’s forehead. Making sure not to wake John up, he murmured,
"Ms. Morstan can be quite an excited person, yes." he could see her grit her teeth, "But that's not important now." Molly walked over to the bulletin board on the wall, "These are all your shifts. You will only be switching shifts with Ms. Morstan as she is the barmaid here. There are only about one hundred guests in the hotel at one time, so you should only need the two of you. But if more guests show up, or one of you need to take a day off, we can get another bartender to help out."
When they got entered John's room, John was awake and sitting up. John turned his head towards Sherlock and Lestrade and when his eyes set on Sherlock, he visibly tensed. There was a stifling silence that persisted for a few, long seconds before Lestrade couldn't handle it and broke it, "I heard you beat up the bloke who attacked you pretty badly."
John smiled tightly, "All in day's work." The silence set again for a moment before John cleared his throat, "Lestrade, could I speak to Sherlock in private?"
He was momentarily frightened the waiter was going to say something to their manager, but his worries were appeased when the waiter just shrugged and turned away as a way to say, ‘I don’t get paid enough for this job to really care.’
There was John. He was shivering and his teeth chattered; his green winter coat was covered in dusty snow, and he was holding a pink coat clad Rosie in his arms. Even so, a huge grin was plastered on his face, “Can I come in?”
He watched John nod, "Y-yeah. You're right," John opened his mouth, and Sherlock thought he was going to say something, but instead, John pulled out his phone and typed something. Sherlock felt his phone buzzed just a few seconds later and he opened the text.
Sherlock shook his head, “The Tube will close in five minutes, and no cabbie would take you anywhere in this weather. You’re going to have to stay over.”
“Because that's the only thing we can do! It’s not as if you haven’t faired just fine without knowing!”
His jaw immediately fell open with awe. He had expected many things; a few being an elegant stairwell, high ceilings, and velvet rugs. But nothing could've actually prepared him for what it actually looked like. It was practically a palace! His eyes went wide and he took in his surroundings.
He collapses onto the ground again and tries to think. The ceiling is thinner than the bottom, it’s made up of wood, and he can hear the chatter of people. They all sound relaxed, or even excited, even though there’s a man being captured right next to them.
Slipping out of bed, he rinsed his mouth and made his way to the living room. (Which Sherlock noted, was wrapping paper free) Rosie and John were reading an interactive children's book, that had undoubtedly been left there from one of the many visits he had from the two of them. Rosie randomly pushing one of the many buttons, each button producing a random animal sound.
John ended up asking Mycroft for a picture who, unfortunately, denied him access to any. But hey. Who said he still didn’t have a chance?
“No.” John grips the door handle tighter and he can feel his left ring finger throb, “Friends protect people.”
He doesn’t talk about what he knows about Sherlock. He also doesn’t talk about what he wished he could’ve felt for Mary. He’s not sure if he should.
Sherlock's throat went dry, and he tried to sound plenty more confident than how he truly felt, "John, I have known you for almost eight years. We have lied to each other, hit each other, and argued countless times. I refuse to let one little weird comment change anything."
But then John pauses, and takes a closer at the picture. He can tell the man is tall, ginger, with a weirdly familiar grainy face.
William raised his head and suddenly, John's eyes met his. William’s eyes, even in the dull yellow lighting, looked almost ethereal. Unreal. It was a bit silly, really, and also a bit preteen, but John felt like he could get lost in the depth of his eyes. Like if he could just-
They made a complete mess of the sheets, but he couldn't bring himself to care. All that there was, was the two of them. Together for as long as they could be.
"Oh hello, Molly!" John was startled out of his thoughts as a short-haired, blonde lady dressed in a black apron, and a white collared dress entered the room, "I thought you were supposed to be out today!"
He dropped the new shirt he had in his hand on the ground and followed the line of rose petals into the kitchen, awed at what he saw.
That morning, when Sherlock woke up, it was 10 AM and John and Rosie were gone from the bed. For a moment, he feared that they had left, until he smelt fresh-brewed coffee wafting through the air. John had made coffee then. Then that means the power’s back on.
Sherlock smiled in relief and pulled John down into another kiss. It was shorter but cleaner than the last one. Sherlock looked up at the clock, it was 3 AM already, “We should go to sleep before we fall asleep right here and now. That would be havoc for all of us. Including Rosie.”
He turned and found himself staring at a picture of John and himself on the now newspaper-cleared mantle. “Oh John,” he muttered, “what you do to me.”
John was about to ask why they had a tour guide, but he realized the silliness it and kept walking. They took a left and turned around the corner to a black door with a gold "Storage Room" sign stuck to the middle. Molly scanned her ID and let them in.
John smiled nervously as he watched William think about it. His plan made sense, but, was he being too forward?
William was the first one to speak, “I’m not quite sure if I’m right, but, maybe this is a good time to say that I’m not actually ginger. Or American.”
Disclaimer: I do not work at a bar, but I have tried my hardest to research as much as I can. If you find any mistakes or things I should add, don't hesitate to tell me in the comments!
Well, granted, he was going to be a bartender here. But still, he wasn't going to be picky about what kind of job he got, as long as he got a job. And plus, being a bartender wasn't all that bad.
At 221B, it was Christmas Eve and pitch dark (and had been for a while). Heavy snow fell down onto the streets; making the streets turn white and gleaming, hiding the ground’s cracks and blemishes. All the last minute Christmas shoppers were gone now, dashing quickly for warmth away from the freezing weather.
John stared at the other man in disbelief and broke into a giggle, albeit a little delirious, “Honestly, I guessed the second one.”
“So do I.” John waved goodbye one last time and he speed-walked out the door and into the hot winter air. He felt a stupid smile grow on his face.
Sherlock ended up telling John three more cases that he had solved before he met John. One about a chef that disappeared, another about a dead raccoon that had been stuffed with millions of dollars that had been stolen days before, and a third one (his personal favourite) a murdered clown that someone had found with a knife through his chest, and a red balloon tied around his neck. (Sherlock hadn't understood the red balloon part until John explained the movie "It" to him. Which he replied with a grumbled, "Idiotic pop-culture references.") It wasn't until 2 AM that their conversation started to dwindle, and Sherlock started to notice that John seemed to get increasingly nervous. His leg started to fidget, and his laughs became strained. Sherlock became worried. Did he do something wrong? He was just ready to ask John if something was wrong when,
Sherlock spun around, "We're going to need blankets. At this rate, the temperature within this building will drop rapidly." John shook his head and stood up, shifting Rosie in his arms, “It’s fine, I’ll just go.”
John nodded eagerly and they stumbled into Sherlock’s bedroom, clumsily closing and locking the door. Falling onto the bed, John felt Sherlock brush lightly at John’s now-hardening, clothed nipples while sucking and biting not-so-gently at his tanned neck,
“What the hell are you talking about?! You tryin’ to get me framed? Well, let me tell you, you little shit, that I’m innocent, and that you should let go of me before I call the police on you.”
Sherlock spun back around to see John, wading in the water right next to him. When did he get there? And wasn't he just floating on his back?
And John tells her. He tells Sherlock, too. And it hurts- it hurts realizing over and over again what he’s done. What he did.
Sherlock entered the room and studied, a pretty beat up William Smith who was sitting at a table in the room with a black eye, bruised cheek, and a broken leg. Sherlock had a pretty good feeling they were inflicted by John.
No attacks, no running, nothing. Just a regular first day on the job. Nothing he hadn’t done before.
John rolled his eyes playfully and took the watch out of the box carefully, taking off his old watch. Sherlock motioned towards himself, "Here, let me."
“How about next year on,” John paused to think about it, “Christmas Eve? That time is the easiest time for me to leave, but I still want to visit my sister on Christmas.”
He hadn't ever indulged in something like this, but the thought of spending his third Christmas on base while most of his comrades were back with their families, wasn't appealing in the slightest.
And later that night, after a chat-filled dinner at a small 24-hour diner; John and Sherlock were sitting by a lit fire, Rosie tucked into John’s old bed, while Mrs Hudson came up and gave them a tray of tea,
Sherlock walked over to John and pressed a chaste kiss to John’s lips, ”John,“ he rumbled in a low tone, pulling John closer.
Sherlock followed John’s eyes and saw a gold, shiny wrapped box under the tree, that hadn’t been there before, “I… don’t know.”
John immediately froze and slowly looked up at the doorway, wincing at who it was. It was Elise, another GP he had met five months ago. Another GP who was currently fuming and stalking towards John, “You are pinning an innocent, injured man to the wall!”
John glanced at Sherlock, his eyebrows raised and a smile on his face, “Oh did he?” Sherlock averted his attention to the fireplace, ignoring John’s gaze,
Mary smiles sweetly and reaches her left arm across the table to grab his left hand; revealing her own soulmate mark on her left hand, “Oh John. Of course, I don’t mind. If I did, it would be rather hypocritical of me, wouldn’t it?”
"Surprise me," the man winked, and John almost dropped -again!- the glass he had held. A blush spread across his cheeks and he turned his attention to the gin martini he had set out to make.
John thought about it for a moment. He couldn't meet with his family, but he still wanted to go somewhere familiar to him. A place that felt like home.
And John laughs from the whiplash; the words are so different than the words he wished Sherlock would say. The words he knows Sherlock would never say- could never say, even if he meant it.
“Stop it!” Sherlock sounds angry and a bit desperate as he searches the area behind John. John’s left-hand throbs.
Sherlock ran out onto the sidewalk and started running. Now that he thought about it, he should have gotten a cab. It would've taken much less time and effort. (But then again, when you're running to see your friend who had several broken bones and unconscious, you don't really think about those things)
She continued on, "As you can see, your first shift will be at 6 o'clock to 1 A.M," that was odd, he had been told his first shift would be at half-past five, "Ms. Morstan will assist you in the beginning if you need any help. Questions?"
"Well, he failed to shut down all the cameras, so I would presume he was an idiot. It really should've been a lot harder to find him. Even if it's archetypical other humans to be idiots," Lestrade shot a glare at Mycroft, "this level of idiocy is incredible."
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, "An attack? Why did he call about that? He, his minions, or even the Yard could probably solve the case. There are plenty more things already consuming my mind. The last thing I want clogging up my brain more is a pointless case right now."
Sherlock blushed and set Rosie on the floor to climb to his feet and retrieved the silver box off the bookshelf. He handed it to John and he gratefully took it. Carefully unwrapping and opening the box, his eyes widened at the site.
He stood back up, wincing, and raced out the door of the flat, passing by the dinner table to see his alarm clock crushed into little pieces with Sherlock sitting above it, studying it with scrutiny under a microscope.
John smiles awkwardly and a bit in disbelief, “We don’t know a thing about each other, I don’t know where we’re meeting, I don’t even know your name.”
John chuckled, and Sherlock cocked his head at him, “What? There are at least five inches of snow on the ground. There has got to be a reason you came. Did your car break down? Do you need help? Did something happen-”
It wasn’t until John had gotten out of the surgery and onto the sidewalk did it really hit him what he did.
He stands in front of Sherlock's coffin and skims his fingers across the top of it. The wooden lid is smooth and cold.
"I matched his face with information from the archives. The assailant was a man of the name, William Humphrey Smith. I have his records," Mycroft handed Sherlock a manilla file, "I have personally not read them, but I'm sure they will help you."
John sucked eagerly, slicking Sherlock’s long fingers with saliva. Sherlock made a sound of content and slowly entered his slick fingers into John. John arched his back in pleasure as Sherlock gently pushed his finger into John; slowly entering one more finger, scissoring and stretching John.
Maybe he should've woken Sherlock up. They were only friends and all, and friends definitely didn’t sleep in the same bed. But John’s bed had felt so cold last night and Sherlock was so warm and John was so comfortable; five more minutes couldn’t hurt…
John freezes. Even after six years, John has never forgotten that face. It’s not Sherlock, it’s William.
Sherlock hesitated, "I'm the reason this happened to you. The assailant, William Smith, had connections to Blythe Evans -the man we arrested last month- and William wanted revenge. He had figured out that you and I had a hand in arresting him, and when he saw you, well, he was drunk and he set upon attacking you."
“Hard! Rough! O-oh god, anything, just fuck me! Please!” He couldn't help the whine that left his throat and whimpered at how Sherlock moaned. He was being overwhelmed by pleasure and could almost taste his release.
John took a bite of his sandwich and a sip of his drink, “And are you going to tell him that his boyfriend is planning to propose to him tonight?”
Sherlock swallowed thickly. He would find the person who did this. And he would make that person pay. He walked out of the room, he had work to do.
Sherlock’s head lifts up and he meets John’s eyes, “The game is never over, John, but there may be some new players now. It’s okay. The East Wind takes us all in the end.”
Grabbing the thin, paper menu with his gloved hands, John debated whether or not to order any drinks or food. On one hand, someone might notice him. On the other hand, wasn't eating and drinking something warm the point of his excursion?
“Nice touch, this, the pool where little Carl died. I stopped him,” John's heart rate shoots through the roof, “I can stop John Watson, too.” He looks down as the next words are spoken, “Stop his heart.”
“Well, it seems like you boys have yourselves a free little Christmas gift,” Mrs. Hudson winked, “Well off I pop! I have some gifts I have to deliver.” And with that she left the flat, leaving Sherlock dumbstruck. (Which was not a daily occurrence)
When they exited the building, Sherlock hailed a cab for him and Lestrade to go to the A&E and visit John. Once they arrived, Sherlock walked out leaving Lestrade to pay the cab driver and entered the building. Apparently, someone, (most likely Mycroft) had informed the employees and nursed about their arrival and Sherlock and Lestrade were allowed to visit John with no implications.
“Your-,” John paused. He was sure the other man knew what he was talking about, so there had to be a reason why he seemed so defensive about it, “never mind.”
He traveled back to the living room and stood next to John and Rosie, who was still trying to (what it looked like) rip apart the book (Sherlock couldn't blame her, he would too destroy that book in complete exasperation and boredom) while John kept having to gently push her hands away from the book, only for her to grab another part of the book.
He groaned as he sipped a cup of now cold tea and looked out the window at the pouring rain; like it would help him find out where John was. Or as if John would pass by the window and come back to 221B. But alas, that didn't work.
She raised her eyebrows, "Already first name basis, are we?" she laughed, "well, in that case, John, my name is Mary. Nice to meet you."
He could feel his hand ache as he gripped his cane, and his leg twinged when he accidentally hit it against a shelf. He was sweating profusely, (even though he hadn't run or moved that much) and he had to abandon his suit jacket in order not to overheat. "Why is it so hot in here?" John grumbled under his breath to Mary.
He spent the rest of the night pounding John into the mattress as they both kissed each other sloppily while Sherlock babbled on and on. (
John used his good arm to grab Sherlock by his coat and yanked Sherlock towards him, "Shut up." He pulled Sherlock and their lips met in the middle, John's arm on the back of Sherlock's neck as Sherlock grabbed the sides of John’s face.
Sherlock swore under his breath. John looking, John sounding so undone… it made blood shoot right down to Sherlock’s groin. He tossed off John’s trousers and pants, relieving the pressure off of John’s erect cock.
They waded far into the ocean. Far away from everyone else. Where it was just the two of them. Together. And just when Sherlock couldn’t reach the seabed, he arched his back and let himself float onto his back; peering to the left to see that John had done the same thing. He breathed in the salty, warm air and let his dark curls soak into the cool water.
He turned around briskly and sat down his tea cup, collapsing in his chair with a slight pout on his face.
TUESDAY AFTERNOON- “The City at Night” has crumbled due to the combustion of multiple bombs. There have been five injured, and three known deaths. Their reported names were William Scott, Taimar Nabi, and Mahvash Abboud. As of now, not much is known on how or what happened, but city officials are looking into the bombing.
The next morning, they took a visit down to the beach and lied down on the rough sand as their bodies soaked in the hot sun for hours and hours. He could’ve stayed there forever really; if it hadn’t been for John, who had convinced him to go down to the ocean. (I didn’t bring all these towels if we weren’t going to swim, you berk.)
“Happy Christmas, Sher’rock!” Rosie runs over to Sherlock and shoves a Christmas cracker into Sherlock’s hands.
“But it was creative! I couldn’t have called it, ‘Naive Red-Headed Baseball Players’ could I? You have to give me some creativity credit!”
Sherlock shoved  Lestrade out of the way, "I can not find the attacker without knowing the wellbeing of John. I will work on it tomorrow, it can wait."
“You would think," Lestrade rubbed his face with his hand, "We sent him to the nearest prison for questioning a few hours ago when he woke up.”
“I have an international reputation,” he hears Sherlock slur, “Do you have an international reputation?”
It was a picture of the two of them, taken while Sherlock and John had been walking through the street in the snow after a rather thrilling two days before Christmas case. They both seemed to be looking at some Christmas lights. John was smiling at them while Sherlock, on the other hand, was scowling. The picture was from an old newspaper clipping that John had found while they had been repairing 221B. The newspaper clipping had been crinkled and dusty, and all the way back from 2011, but John still protested he keep it. So there it stood, on the mantle, in a cheap £1, plastic gold picture frame. Sherlock stared at the picture; reminiscing later that very night after the picture had been taken.
Once the cab arrived, he threw some money he hoped was enough and legged it to his office, pushing past people here and there. If you asked him why he had run in the middle of the hallway instead of against the wall so he could avoid hitting people, he would tell you to piss off but would take your advice. Unfortunately, you were not there to tell him this, so he did run into someone.
The other man shrugged his shoulders, "That might help," he downed his drink and set the martini glass on the counter along with two fivers, "keep the change." He slinked away from the bar and behind another customer.
After 10 minutes of endless running, pushing random people out of his way and into poles, Sherlock ran into the entrance of the A&E and to the desk.
He sighed and sat back down in his armchair. If he had known wrapping Christmas presents was going to take a ridiculous amount of wrapping paper, maybe he wouldn't have decided to wrap his Christmas presents. In fact, he did know, but he had still wanted to wrap his presents. No matter how much of a trouble it was for him. And there was only one person to blame.
Sherlock calculated it had been approximately 2:45 AM when he was interrupted from his musings by three knocks on the door.
Sherlock turns from his lying place on the couch, “Why would I dye my hair, ginger? I would never dye my hair any color, let alone
He stares at the photo of William before putting it back on the shelf, at the bottom of the stack of books. Standing up, he picks up the stack of books, grabs Sherlock’s dressing gown. and plans to walk straight out of the room. But, right before he walks out the door; he breaks. He walks back to the shelf and takes a picture with his mobile before he can rethink his decision.
"Yeah," Molly laughed, "it smells in here, I know. You'll get used to it. At least, that's what other people have said. Personally, I'm still not used to it either." John chuckled. It seemed to lighten up the mood. He looked around. The room had a large bulletin board, industrial sink, a grey door (which he assumed was a walk-in cooler), and a large shelf with rags and extra glasses.
John shakes his head, “She thought that if you put yourself in harm’s way I’d ... I’d rescue you or something. But I didn’t. Not until she told me to. And that’s how this works. That’s what you’re missing. She taught me to be the man she already thought I was. Get yourself a piece of that.”
It has barely been 24 hours since John Watson has met Sherlock Holmes, and John has come up with three things.
“Well, you were intoxicated, I admit- so you didn’t really tell me so much as you prattled on about it.”
“Oh yeah, right!” John grabbed his green crown and balanced it on his head, “do you wanna do jokes again?”
"It most definitely did." Sherlock's thought process was racing. After months, even years, of pining hopelessly after John, finally, finally, his heart was put to rest.
The waiter gave him an odd look, and John stared back before belatedly realizing that it was because of the scarf around John’s mouth. Which made him look a lot stranger, and a lot more suspicious than he wanted to be seen as.
Mycroft thought for a moment, "Alright. I can't schedule for you to meet him tomorrow evening at 7 PM at the prison,
Mary smiled, it was rather uncomfortable in John's opinion "I will be joining you so it would be less work for you. Would that be ok with you?"
Sherlock scoffed, "Then you've clearly haven't heard everything about me. If you had, you would’ve known that I am known for being an unpredictable psychopath. Now, I’ll say it again. Shut up or you're going to regret it.”
He fixes a tight smile and turns to Sherlock, “Ok. Your way. Always your way,” he turns to Mary, “Sit.”
"Sometimes I think the world would be a better place if people thought of other solutions than revenge."
So, he did what any normal person would do: ignore the other man, and continue on with his plate of chips and a cup of tea.
“My evidence is that your,” John points at Sherlock, even though he knows Sherlock can’t see him, “brother is a meddling arsehole.”
John paused; what line of work was this man -his soulmate-in. Should John be worried, “What do you for ‘work’?”
He had had a feeling that the man was the murderer. But after getting kicked out by Elise, he hadn’t thought of it as a possibility, “How did you arrest him?”
John cocked his head, "James Bond. You know. Double-0 Seven? Spy for MI6? Can't keep his equipment in one piece?" John stopped as he saw the other man was even more confused, "You don't know James Bond?"
“I doubt Mycroft would be willing to if there are any pictures, to begin with. It was an undercover,
A short woman with mousy brown hair and a white blouse came up to him, "Um, yes, that's me." He let out his hand to shake. She took it.
"You're a drug addict, an alcoholic, and you smoke, quite obvious really. Your yellow teeth show that you smoke, and your eyes are bloodshot; a common sign of drug addiction. The ring-shaped pale line on your ring finger clearly shows that you used to be married, recently divorced. Probably due to the addiction to drugs and alcohol."
When he wakes up in the morning (at 11 o’clock) Sherlock is gone from his bed, and he can hear the clatter of experiments from downstairs. He assumes it was just a dream.
"I'm sorry Sherlock," John paused, "for leaving. I-I didn't know what I was thinking. It's not your fault, I just- god -I'm so sorry."
Sherlock sighed, "Yes. He somehow found out that John and I were the reason Blythe was in prison, most likely from the news, and William wanted revenge. So one night, after William had gotten considerably drunk, he had seen John and attacked him."
“My what?” Cold blue eyes met his, a John felt a prickle at the back of his neck, and a bit more confusion.
Sherlock's irritated voice rang out and yanked him from his thoughts, "If you don't have anything to say of importance, leave."
Also, I would like to say thank you to my friend (Who does not want her name released, so I'll call her Hufflepuff Fryiend. Yes, that's how she wants it spelled.) for reading over this chapter! She's a great friend and a great beta!
“We really did get lucky with the weather,” John looked up at the sky, “there’s barely a cloud in the sky.”
When he left the surgery at the end of his shift, he left light-hearted and took a cab to Baker Street. He climbed the stairs to 221B and opened the door to find again, just like the day before, the lights were off. But candles flickered all around the room, giving off a faint, peaceful glow.
A few minutes later, John had found a new place on the couch, and Sherlock had come back with two blankets, and two torches that were lit that he had procured from his bedroom.
Sherlock blindly reached for a condom and lube that had been placed on the bedside drawer from only last week; only now unbuttoning his own trousers and pants, sighing as he felt his erection freed. Tearing open the condom, he rolled it in one smooth motion onto the head of his cock with his hands and slicked it with lube.
Sherlock studied John's eyes, finding no signs of mendaciousness, and slowly -as if in a trance- closed the space between him and John, his pulse was racing and his palms were sweaty.
John smiles. “Of course you can, Rosie.” He’s pleased that Rosie’s been avidly learning her numbers; and that Sherlock has been just as avidly teaching her.
He didn’t know when John had dipped below the surface, but the next time he looked to his left, John was gone.
Love runs over John like a wave and he beams at Sherlock. He sets down his cider down on the table, and takes Sherlock’s left hand and kisses the red soulmate mark on Sherlock’s forefinger.
William smirked, "Look here Holmes. I've heard of you, and I haven't heard of you breaking any promises."
Also, I finally got a Tumblr account and I'm posting stuff already! Come check it out! You might like it!
Lestrade sighed, "He was found unconscious and was sent to the nearest A&E about two hours ago. He has several broken bones-"
He brought himself off his back and looked about himself, “John?" Where did he go? What was he doing?
John mentally facepalmed and nodded as he remembered all those years ago when he had first met Sherlock at St. Bart’s. Now that he remembered the date of it, he could never forget it. Reaching up to peck Sherlock on the cheek, he whispered in his ear,”That’s so sweet you remembered.“
The voice was low, most likely a man, and it had been utterly relaxed. Despite that, it had been so sudden that John jumped and he fumbled with the glasses, catching them before they hit the floor.
At first, Sherlock paced around the flat, angry and annoyed. John was being absurd. What did John think he was doing, just storming off?
He sees a couple of thin bookshelves in the corner next to a lamp and he decides to take a look there.
Sherlock opened his mouth. He had so many things he wanted- no needed- to tell John. But alternatively, he responded, “No- there’s nothing. I was merely inquiring.” John didn’t say anything, but his face showed that he didn’t completely believe Sherlock.
He took a physical and mental step away from the man. Usually, he wouldn’t be nervous, he was in the army for god's sake, but he was in a room filled only with medical tools that were useless for self-protection and he had left his gun at home under his pillow,  And even with a broken arm, the man could well kill him right here and now, if he had somehow sneaked in a weapon. After all, you only really needed one arm to shoot a gun.
"Please Lestrade, you know who I am. Now, I really must get on with this. This will greatly interest my brother."
John murmurs under his breath as he reads the neon-lit sign that was attached to the outside wall of the (non-alcoholic) bar.
“Then we’ll take what comes. I know you might never really get over your old soulmate, and as long as you can understand that I might not ever get over mine,” John nods, “then who cares if we’re not ‘soulmates, soulmates?’”
John quietly sneaks down from Rosie’s room upstairs and joins Sherlock in the living room again. He sits down on his chair and takes the cup of mulled cider that Sherlock offers him from his spot in front of the window.
Sherlock turned to John and said in a matter-of-fact tone, "It's going to get colder in here John. By sharing a blanket, we'll be sharing body heat. Therefore making us all warmer."
Before Sherlock could look back up at John, his phone was yanked out of his hand and he was being pressed against the arm of the couch, John's lips pressed hard against his. It was a sloppy kiss, their noses collided and their teeth clashed together, but it took Sherlock's breath away nonetheless.
But, still, that didn't soothe the sting that having is life-long dream shot brought. And not just in a metaphorical way. His shoulder and cane proved it.
Number two, Sherlock Holmes is also simultaneously the most brilliant man he’s ever met. He has not only solved a murder in a few hours but also cured his limp.
Before John could object, Sherlock had left to stumble in the dark to find torches and blankets, leaving John to just shrug his shoulders in defeat and hold Rosie tighter.
Mary walks towards him and grabs his hand. John grabs back as if he’s hanging onto the last person who he loves. Or at least, that’s what he tells himself.
!” What was Sherlock doing? Why was Sherlock doing it? He valued Mrs. Hudson so much, but wouldn’t go to her aid when she could’ve been
"As I said yesterday John, I remember everything that you have said to me. No matter whether it carries great or little importance."
"What about Mary?" Sherlock asked abruptly. Dammit, he hadn’t thought of Mary! “I know Mary’s death was hard on you and I don’t want to push you to do anything you don’t want to.”
, (Even if it really was a Christmas film, it was still a good romance film) was playing on the telly, which was now plugged in.
He stalked to their bedroom, not bothering to eat or shower. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he knew he shouldn't have snapped at Sherlock (after all, he was used to these things by now) but after the day he had, he couldn't give less of a shit. He stripped out of his stained clothes and laid on the bed, his left shoulder screaming as he rolled to his side, irritated from that morning when he fell in the bathroom. Sighing angrily, he turned on his back and tried to ignore the pain, falling asleep into a dreamless sleep.
“I saw the photo on your bookshelf. The photo of William. For a long time, I had no idea why you had a photo of him. Until I realized. It was
Lestrade continued, “Well, Elise, another GP who said she knew you, wanted to inspect him for any excess damage you might’ve conflicted, when a gun fell out of his pant leg,” Lestrade lifted up a plastic bag with a gun inside, “she and some others who had been watching immediately seized Howard Mossle out and called the Met. Luckily, my team and I were deployed and knew what the murderer looked like. Otherwise, we never could have found him or knew he was the murderer.”
John smiles and a rush of affection runs through him. Something almost like… he doesn’t know. He frankly feels too lightheaded to care.
John laughs, “Oh my gosh. Do you have pictures? Mycroft has got to have pictures! I need to ask him for those!”
John shrugged, “I’ll take it.” He was choosing his battles, and he had a feeling he wasn't going to win this one, “and anyway, that isn't the only reason I thought of you on ginger hair. I also just simply thought it would look-”
Sherlock nodded felt a blush creeping up his cheeks at the nickname and walked quickly away to the window (The snow had indeed stopped) so to not have John notice his reddening cheeks. His efforts were futile because John, getting increasingly observant over the years, noticed.
“Alright, alright,” John says, and he grabs his own dotted green, and gives Sherlock a dotted blue one.
He can tell he’s trapped in a small enclosed area. And with what he can tell, he might be in a cell. Or something, as he can see tiny slits of light in his space.
John laughs, “Yeah neither can I. He seemed to never understand the meaning of what Christmas was; or family. I wonder if he’s always been like that.”
And Sherlock wasn’t an extremely religious person. Nor was he a person who still believed in old child tales. But all the same, he swore he could hear a faint ringing of bells, and a soft, “Ho-ho-ho!”
They swam back to shore and lied, together, back on the sand. John's head resting under Sherlock's open arm. The sun seemed to set a lot quicker than it had the day before.
"I need to meet him. See who this man is. I've got a pretty good idea now, but I need more evidence."
John nods in relief. He was sure that his soulmate mark was going to throw off Mary. It had thrown off all his other girlfriends. To be honest, he’d never thought he could ever have one date with her; let alone three. But Mary knew what it felt like to lose someone that close to you. But most of all, she was perfect for him.
“Oh,” and Sherlock gives John a shy smile that makes John’s heart swell with things he doesn’t want to think about, “ok.”
The calm wind ruffled Sherlock’s hair as he sat on the dock; his legs and bare-feet dangling off the edge. He took a deep breath of the salty air, absorbing his surroundings.
John shook his head wordlessly, not wanting to admit that he had probably come in a half hour early.
The man (who John now knew had ebony curls and pale skin) cocked an eyebrow in amusement, "Are you in need of assistance?"
’” John reads out the book titles as he pulls a few out that he thinks that Sherlock might enjoy reading. He sets the three books down and reaches blindly for another book, but pauses as he feels a flimsy surface. He frowns and looks at what he’s just grabbed. It’s a grainy photo of a man. John rejoices and he thinks he’s found a photo of a ginger Sherlock. (Hah! He knew he would find it at some point!)
His lips slammed into Sherlock's as Sherlock pulled John forward by the collar of his hospital gown.
But after one week passed, and John had not returned; after the countless calls and texts to John he had made, all ignored, he felt less irritated and more of, well, more of worry. And no matter how many times the phrase:
Sherlock’s eyes widen, but takes a sip of his coffee, “Interesting; but if you’re trying to say that my parents named half of my name after a person who might’ve not even been born, then you’re sorely mistaken.”
Sherlock ran up the stairs to level B and flung the door open to John's room. He walked to John's side. John was laid unconscious on a bed, with a cast on his arm, cuts scattered on his leg, and a bandage around his head. He felt a surge of anger in him; even if John left Sherlock, it didn't justify this. How dare anyone do this to John?
John shook his head, “We really don’t do enough for you. If you ever need help with anything, just call us. It’s the least we can do for you; with you cleaning our mugs and sweeping the floor last night.”
Mary suggested it; saying that Sherlock was going to need something to entertain him and that John needed to, ‘
They jumped apart, an awkward Lestrade standing in the doorway, “I-I, um, I couldn’t hear anything so I wanted to make sure you two were alright. It seems you two, are, so I’ll just go…” He slowly backed out and closed the door, and left John and Sherlock, blushing madly.
“So,” Sherlock started, “what brings you here? Your house is far from here, and with the snow outside, it would have been nonsensical to drive here.”
Sherlock furiously shook his head, as if that would make the thought disappear. He couldn't-wouldn't- think about it.
It was two books. One was a book that had a brown leather casing while the other had a dull, tan cover. He read the title of it,
"Yes," Molly said with a resigned tone, "yes, they really are." she let out a sigh and straightened her back, "Well, Mr. Watson, good luck today. You’re going to need it." She opened the door and let herself out.
“Mary died saving your life. It was her choice. No-one made her do it. No-one could ever make her do anything,” he pauses to smile, “but the point is; you didn’t kill her.”
Anthea walked towards the lady,"My name has no concern to you. What is a concern to you is that my boss has a major role in the British Government, and the man you are talking to, just happens to be his brother. My boss would not be happy if you didn't let his brother visit his friend. On the contrary, if you don't allow him, there may be some, unfortunate consequences at the hands of my boss."
John smiles at the gesture and for a moment he remembers a wisp of ginger hair, an American accent, a pale face, and a lanky body.
Rosie pranced through the snow, throwing little bits of white into the air, John, and Sherlock following her around, laughing and playing with her. One or two tourists that weren't adapted to London’s natural happenings around them stared at the sight of two grown men rolling in the snow with a two-year-old and laughing.
Sherlock avoids his gaze, and John can feel anger rising, like a tidal wave, “Yes, she’s a lunatic, she’s a criminal, she’s
“It’s okay.” John feels the pressure of Sherlock’s arms around him before he realizes that Sherlock is… Sherlock is hugging him. He leans into Sherlock’s chest like a lifeline.
John watches as Sherlock gives Rosie a wide smile and follows her to the couch. John pulls up a chair next to the sofa.
John nodded as he skimmed his shifts on the wall. He seemed to only be working at night / very early mornings. Which was what he requested when he applied and during the interviews. It wasn't like he slept much in the first place. Might as well be productive.
They settled into a comfortable silence, watching the film until he felt Sherlock’s fingers massage at John’s left shoulder. John turned his neck around, questioning.
Looking around, he saw a large black L-shaped couch in the middle of the room on top of a dark red carpet. There was a glass table in front of it which had a vase of flowers and available ashtrays.
Lestrade blocked Sherlock's path, "I know you want to see John, Sherlock, I do too. But what about the attacker? He needs to be arrested! We can't let him loose! What if he does something else! What then?!"
Sherlock got into the car and Mycroft handed him a tablet, "I downloaded the footage onto this tablet."
A burst of hot, white pain exploded in his left shoulder as it collided with the ground, leaving John paralyzed and gasping for air. Crap! He didn’t have time for this.
Yeah, she wasn’t William. She wasn’t Sherlock either. But they both loved each other for who they were, and who they were alone. Didn't that mean more?
“Sorry, I completely lost track of time,” John shook his head while laughing softly, “I have to go, now.” He slipped his gloves back on and stood up. Looking back down at the table, he realized he hadn't paid yet.
Sherlock’s mind raced but stayed still. All he could think, all he could feel, all he could grasp, was John. Not his best friend, not his flatmate, but John.
By L.L. Langstroth. Putting it away, he grasped the leather-cased book. It, too, had a tan cover with the title
At first, he feels a small joy at seeing his dead soulmate again. His next emotion is absolute bafflement. Why did Sherlock have a photo of his dead soulmate?
John blinked, caught a bit off guard by the statement, before wordlessly nodding in confirmation; his shoulder hadn’t quite recovered from the day before. After all, the pain of falling on, and then burning an already wounded shoulder didn’t just disappear overnight.  He had mostly ignored the pain for the day, but now as he relaxed, he actually got a chance to notice the pain.
His eyes opened comically and he looked up at John, who was staring at Sherlock intensively, trying to gauge Sherlock's reaction. He looked back down at his phone and tried to still his trembling fingers.
His fourth finger, which had remained blank for all his life; now was decorated with a thin red pattern that circulated the base of his finger. He had met his
“It's a story my brother told me when we were kids. It seeks out the unworthy and plucks them from the Earth,” Sherlock smiles humorlessly, “that was generally me.”
The not-red-head-but-red-headed man nodded with a thoughtful frown, “Yes, that would be. But when? And where?”
That night, Sherlock pressed John's back into the soft mattress as he loved every inch of John. He kissed his forehead and worked his way down John's tanned throat, shoulders (making sure John's wound got extra attention), his broad chest, stomach, and finally, the inside of his thighs. He relished in the way John's breathe caught in his throat and the moan that spilled from his throat when Sherlock gave John's cock an experimental lick. Oh, how much he earned to hear that sound again.
The other man rolled his eyes, “I’m doing something that must involve absolute secrecy, but no. Not part of those organizations. I feel as if we’ve discussed this before.”
Sherlock slowly makes his way to him and John cringes as he hears the tinny voice through his earpiece, “Gottle o’ geer, gottle o’ geer,” John chokes a bit, “gottle o’ geer.”
"The glassware has already been stocked behind the bar, and the ice has been transported to the ice wells so you don't have to worry about that..." Mary trailed off for a second and cleared her throat, "anything else?"
“No,” Sherlock slurs approvingly, “And I can’t even remember what for. Sss.. crime… something or... other.”
“Bet you never saw this coming.” His heart breaks a little at the sight of Sherlock's despair, and he opens his coat to reveal the bomb.
Sherlock laughed and they sat on other sides of the table, eating the pasta with pleasant conversation.
Sherlock timidly kissed John’s cheek, cautious not to accidentally knock Rosie off of his lap, “Thank You.... love.”
John gently took the package and cautiously began to unwrap the shiny gold wrapping off of it. Inside, there was a silver box, and they both took the lid off. Inside, there was a golden, magnificent picture frame, with a small note set on it. They read it:
She grinned again, "Alright then. I guess you're good to go!" she patted him on the back, "Remember! Smile and talk to people! Become their friends." John nodded meekly and he followed Mary out of the room and into the bar.
John giggles. He feels hysterical, high, yet also feels like the weight of worlds is on his chest. He giggles again. He doesn’t want to think about it, “His name was Scott...no… Scott William? No, no, no, no, no, it was William Scott. Wish I could meet him again, ya know,” John lets out another high-pitched giggle, “But, I’m getting married so,” He shrugs, “Guess it doesn’t matter, does it?”
At first, the other man didn't say anything, only stared at John for a few seconds before turning his back and looking at the rest of the room.
Half of him wanted to take a few minutes to ask his boyfriend why he had felt the overwhelming urge to take apart his alarm clock when he knew John had work the next day but decided against it because he did not have any minutes to spare. He ran outside glad to find a cab that had happened to drive his way. Climbing into the cab, he all but yelled at the cabbie where to go, checking his watch worriedly. His shift started at 8:30, and it was 8:25.
