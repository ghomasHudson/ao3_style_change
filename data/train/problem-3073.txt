time, and I’ll destroy everything whilst you’re up there. You won’t even know that you’ve ceased to exist.”
“I don’t know,” she gasped. Castiel reluctantly believed her.
Dean chuckled. “Yeah… using my brother was a dirty trick, Cas. I’ll get you back for it next debate.” He imagined Castiel to be smiling on the other end of the phone. “But no. I would never go public with something that you revealed to me in confidence. Especially something that puts your safety in danger.”
Castiel lifted his chin. “Well, I am a vampire.”
Chuck peered at Castiel, unimpressed. “And why not?”
Dean fist-pumped the air like a seven-year-old, enticing a begrudging smile out of his rival. When Castiel didn’t unfold his arms, Dean shook his head with a grin and tucked the Democrat into his side again, since they had both seemed to enjoy it earlier and the cold was beginning to seep into his skin. He guided them both along the river as he said, “I’m just fooling around. I know this can’t go anywhere. I just… I like you, man. I shouldn’t, but I do, and I guess I forgot I can’t have you for a moment.”
“That we are.”
,” she corrected.
“Convenient for whom, Cas?”
Dean didn’t miss the way Castiel straightened to his full height.
Cas inhaled sharply, pupils dilating with unbridled lust.
. He whirled around to glare at Jack.
Rolling his eyes as a smirk played about his lips, Dean shook his head at the low murmur of amusement that rippled through the audience even as the host signalled for them to be silent.
. Dean’s past couple of months had consisted of heavy drinking and disapproving looks from his brother. When he neared the pie festival, he was ready to keep driving, but Sam somehow convinced him to stop.
“I’ll never leave you,” Samandriel promised fiercely as he rubbed his chin over Ben’s head. “And I won’t let my uncles hurt either of us. Ever.”
"And yet, it's too late for coffee, bite me," Dean popped his bottlecap off on the side of the table and took a seat next to Castiel, who eyed his display and almost attempted to copy. Dean chuckled and handed Cas the bottle opener attached to his keys. "Okay, so where's the nearest second-hand store?" He asked, reaching across the table for his brother's laptop before getting his hand swatted away.
Dean practically fell out of the car and ran to the reception as Cas grabbed their bags. He almost asked for two queens out of habit, but his dick was very helpful in reminding him to get one king. He jogged back out to the car with the key in hand and gave Cas a giddy smile, pointing at their door.
"Nothing dude, I'm sure you'll figure it out when you're ready." He snickered and headed in the opposite direction of Cas, leaving a bewildered Dean sitting alone in the library.
Dean's face burned. He didn't think he was being obvious about it or anything. Cas was observant, though.
"Do you want to kiss me?" Castiel's voice rumbled, shaking Dean to his core. Dean searched for verbal confirmation, but couldn't find it in him to speak. He compromised with a hasty nod, and Castiel closed the distance without an ounce of hesitation. Dean admired it.
wasn't jealousy. Dean cleared his throat. "Ready to go? We can grab lunch on the road."
By the time
"Well, it wouldn't be the midwest if every decent store wasn't 3 hours away. Closest one's in Lincoln." Sam replied flipping the screen to show the maps page presenting 3 different routes.
"Yep, just grabbed you a walkman and stuff so uh, so you can listen to tapes. Let's go." Dean turned the cart around and headed to the cash.
"I uh, blew a tire," Dean mumbled. "The spare's in the trunk, I just don't think I can fix the wheel unless the rain lets up a bit." He dropped his head against the steering wheel. The second side of the tape popped out of the stereo once again.
"May I-"
Castiel tipped back the last of his beer and swayed closer, loosened up from his ridiculously low tolerance. Dean's heartbeat synced up with the patter of the rain on the window behind him.
Thunder rumbled ahead as the two men jogged to the car with the bags from their second trip to the superstore to get more essentials to Cas's daily life. They tossed them in the trunk with the rest and clamored into the front seat as the rain began to fall.
began, Dean was taking the last sip of his beer, tapping his fingers nervously on the back of the bench seat, and futilely shoving down the sense memory of his release from the previous night.
"Ah-fuck, Cas,
I'm so close," Dean gasped, jerking his hips up into Cas's grip, then back down onto his cock. "You gonna make me come, baby?"
"I don't think the kitchen is the best place for this." He rumbled into their shared space. Dean perked back up when he realized the proposition.
Cas continued to pepper Dean's shaking shoulders with wet kisses as he thrust his finger in, curling it hard against Dean's prostate and savoring the faint sound of Dean nearly wailing into his pillow. He slid in a second finger and scissored them back and forth to make way for a third. At this point, Dean had lifted his head and turned towards Cas with pleading eyes. Cas leaned forward and kissed him deeply.
"No, Dean, you've been staring at my hands
"I want you to put your hands on my knees, and you can't move them unless I say so, is that alright?" Castiel spoke when they parted.
Dean hit the wall hard, his breath punched out of him with a grunt. He scrambled to his knees and whipped his head around to see Sam in a similar position nearby. Cas was still standing though now surrounded by three, very pissed-off demons, one of which had Dean's angel blade. Dean attempted to gather himself and help out, but his vision went sideways and he steadied himself against a table, opting to call out the angel's name, stupidly.
“And I’ve picked a fight with a shapeshifting intern for attempting to murder a security guard,” Castiel growled. “It isn’t uncommon for monsters to apply for a job amongst humans for more than just the pay. Surely, you’re not that naïve?”
Biting back a laugh of disbelief, Dean decided that he was going to take his role as fake boyfriend to the next level. This family was actually beginning to wear on his nerves at their easy dismissal of Castiel’s thoughts and feelings and Dean couldn’t quite believe it, but he was starting to get angry on Cas’ behalf. Did nobody care what Castiel had to say? Did they always take advantage of him like this? They had literally showed up at his house, taken his credit cards, and started bullying him into doing as they commanded, and now they were trying to force him into an unsalvageable relationship with his ex. What kind of family were they?
Castiel dropped his gaze. “My father always thought that I stole my grandfather’s house off him. The truth is that they abandoned him when he got old and sick and I was the only one who visited him at the home. My grandfather wrote his will to include me as the major beneficiary and so, I got the house. My father is most displeased about it all and thinks I should give it to him. Thinks he’s entitled to it.
“Eventually,” agreed Gabriel sarcastically. “Most of the time.”
The betas’ eyes widened comically as they whipped around to gawk at the small golden alpha draped over Sam.
Castiel was conflicted – he didn’t want to see the nest again this evening and he was sure that his father would do more than throw a wine glass at him if he found him tampering with the hunt.
Dean licked his lips and found himself shifting closer to Castiel again; his intense gaze drawing Dean in. He couldn’t decide whether he wanted to infuriate Castiel or
“And why would you want that?” she asked, eyes narrowed.
“I thought I’d made it pretty clear what happens if you abuse any of my pack members?” Dean snarled. “Because if you think I’m kidding about ripping you to pieces, please, allow me to prove you wrong.”
Dean smiled tightly. “I guess you aren’t as stupid as you look.” He craned his neck towards his pack. “You guys go back to camp. Sam and I will escort our
“Alpha, beta, and omega are genders,
“Wait a second-”
close. If Dean just tilted his head…
Lucifer remained on the floor in a state of shock. His chest and legs ached from the wolf’s claws and he couldn’t stop the flashes of pearly white teeth in his mind’s eye.
He shook his head. The word didn’t seem to exist just yet. Perhaps it would come to him later, or maybe he would be able to recall the feelings he had felt when he had sacrificed himself. He knew that they had to be important.
“Do you promise that I can trust you?” he demanded quietly.
Castiel shouted angrily.
“How did you escape?” Castiel asked, horrified.
,” Castiel shrugged as he started on his gifted brownie. “Most people like him. He does have a tendency to accidentally set his paperwork on fire though.” Castiel scowled. “Well, I say ‘accidentally’…”
"Of course Dean, you know I always enjoy our time together," Cas replied genuinely. Sam cocked an eyebrow and Dean suddenly found himself very interested in picking at the label of his beer. "I think I'd like to sleep now, I'll see you in the morning." He said before downing the last of his beer and heading off down the stairs to what was currently the guest room.
"Anything, Angel, seriously." He pressed his lips to the heated flesh under Cas's jaw, sucking hard and nipping gently.
Dean shifted his back to lean against the door and folded one leg under himself.
"Would you like anything?" He asked over his shoulder.
The former angel swirled his tongue around the head, licking up a dribble of precum before bobbing his head rhythmically, slowly but surely driving Dean up the wall with a steady hand working over the rest. Dean was ramping up
"Dean." Cas sounded wrecked, and Dean's head snapped up to attention.
"Please what, Dean?" Castiel growled against the bolt of Dean's jaw and crooked his finger to slip his index inside, only up to the second knuckle.
As the last notes of
"I'll go get ready," Cas replied in earnest, rising from his seat and chugging the rest of his coffee.
Cas sucked in a sharp breath and dropped his forehead to Dean's shoulder, thrusting steadily into his hand before plunging a second finger in. A third followed and Dean was practically fucking himself onto Cas's nimble fingers.
Cas held the back of Dean's neck steady, tracing the fingers of his right hand down Dean's temple and across his lips. This time, Dean didn't have any reservations about darting his tongue out to meet them. Cas inhaled deeply through his nose and pushed his index and middle fingers into Dean's mouth.
"Nope, no, I'm okay, just a few scrapes. Can't have you wasting your mojo on that... I was just wondering why you didn't, uh, y'know," He tapped two fingers to his forehead and Cas's eyes turned up in a half-smile.
... It's just, well, you have nice hands, and you kinda marked me... with your very large hand." Dean still wanted to disappear, but Cas didn't seem too bothered.
"C-Cas, please..." Dean tilted Cas's face up to kiss him again. Dean keened into his mouth and pushed back, desperately trying to get Cas inside.
That is... until she popped a tire on him. On a pitch-black country road. In the middle of a torrential rainstorm. Okay, maybe it was a little his fault. He should have known that she was a little overdue for a new set of tires.
"So good, you're such a good boy for me, Dean." Cas praised. Dean thought he might pass out. The feeling of Cas inside him, even if it was just his fingers sliding along his tongue was heady. He looked down and took notice of the increasing tightness of Cas's pants. Cas slid his fingers out and leaned back on his elbows. Dean panted, his fingers gripping Cas's thighs with the effort of keeping still.
Dean looked up to see Sam boring a hole in his forehead. "What?"
"Okay, right, got it, I'll stop staring." He managed, grabbing his mug and turning to leave before Cas grabbed his arm. He glanced down at the sudden warmth around his wrist, then up to meet Cas's cobalt gaze.
"It's not over yet. Tomorrow morning I have to teach you an important life skill that isn't making out in Baby's back seat. I'll show you how to fix a tire before we leave." Dean said, gathering Cas into his arms as the former angel nodded, clearly half asleep.
The door to the bunker shut behind him with a resounding
"I never told you to stop," Cas said calmly, loosening his grip to slip his fingers into Dean's hand and pull him closer. "Dean, I researched it." His expression was earnest, and Dean shuddered involuntarily.
"Aren't you sharing it with me? Am I not 'special'?" Castiel pressed, and Dean was beginning to panic internally. Were Cas's lips always this pink? There's no way his eyes were that blue until, like, just now.
Dean watched as he strode out of the kitchen before sitting down at the table to enjoy his breakfast.
"Hello, Dean." He smiled, reaching up to tug off his tie. Dean's throat went dry again.
sounding through the speakers on either side of them.
"No, but I don't want to influence him, he's very impressionable, you know." Cas flicked the collecting ash into a labelless beer bottle that sat discarded in his chair's cupholder.
"When I raised you, it left an imprint of my grace on your soul. I didn't think I'd still be able to feel it, but I suppose it remains. We should shower." The fallen angel panted, slowly pushing himself up to roll off Dean and sit up.
Dean bumped his arm off the steering wheel as he reached for Cas's hip. Then, again when he tried for his ass. He pulled back causing Castiel to give him an incredulous look.
His eyes were drawn up when Castiel nearly screamed in ecstasy, his eyes flickering a dim blue glow, like an angel if the bulb was going out. Dean felt a weak current of divine energy pulse through his veins and bring him right up to the edge.
Cas just chuckled and beckoned him closer. Dean stood between his legs and his heart dropped out of his ass when Cas took his hands and pulled gently, signaling for Dean to kneel. He lowered himself slowly to his knees and looked up at Cas, expectant, and not at all freaking out on the inside. Cas leaned in to kiss him again. That, he could work with.
.Dean didn't know where this streak of confidence was coming from, and he certainly wasn't complaining. Castiel hadn't had this strong an effect on him since he trapped Dean against the counter in Bobby's kitchen, commanding his respect and threatening to throw him back in the pit with a growl lower than the Impala's engine.
"I wanted to tell you, I touch you when I heal because I like the excuse to," Cas murmured, raising his other hand to cup Dean's jaw. Dean's breath hitched. "I enjoy the warmth. Everything else is always so cold." Cas whispered, running his thumb lightly across Dean's bottom lip. Dean couldn't stop the noise he made as it caught on his nail.
, I have no idea what you're talking about." he deadpanned.
By the time he hauled the lantern, jack, tire iron, and currently out of use rim into the trunk, Castiel was sitting back in the passenger seat. He bounced his leg restlessly as he slipped his phone back into his pocket. Dean started the car and eased her into drive, trying to ignore the feeling of Cas boring holes in the side of his head with his heated stare.
"Well-No, not exactly it's just that, this tape's made for that purpose, maybe not necessarily sex but fooling around, y'know, like kissing, or a little heavy petting. Typically I'd only share it with someone, uh, special."
"What's wrong, Dean?" Castiel asked, looking confused, having just been chuckling at Dean's reckless antics until the abrupt stop.
"I'm sorry Dean, Sam hasn't done the laundry yet but these were hanging up. I'll return them tomorrow." He threw his empty backpack into the trunk to be filled later.
"Morning sunshine, Sam and Jack already left to go check out a case. I made pan...cakes..." Dean's sentence fell flat when his eyes met Cas entering in a half-buttoned-up shirt. His long fingers slipped buttons into place as he yawned his greeting and trudged his way to the coffee maker.
"Stuff like I dunno, a watch, and a wallet, we have no shortage of books and movies here, but humans enjoy a lot of different music, maybe we can get you an iPod or something-" Sam listed off until Dean sat up abruptly with a look of disgust.
"You're so beautiful like this, Dean... Like you were built for taking my cock... " he drew back and drove a particularly hard thrust into Dean's prostate, leaning in to suck marks into Dean's chest, now flushing red with embarrassment from the praise.
"Oh... okay." He'd already asked a weird question, probably best not to pry into why Cas always touched him to heal.  He tipped back the rest of his beer and fumbled around for an excuse of some sort to break the silence, but Cas stood first.
"I want you- I- I need you to fuck me,
"Did you wanna finish your breakfast first? I can't guarantee we'll be back in here any time soon." Dean wiggled his eyebrows at the angel.
Yeah, no. Way too long. Dean's half-convinced Cas is fucking with him, too. His suspicion stemmed from Cas's sudden love of eating every meal with them and requesting things like wings or fries.
thorough cleaning and wrapped his towel around his waist, hurrying back down the hallway to his room. Cas was sitting on the bed patiently.
"Well I tried not to, but you put it in the deck before I could say anything, Mr. Profound Bond." Dean let out a shaky chuckle. The track faded out to the slower beat of
Standard bottoms mostly, some jeans, a pair of slacks, some plaid pajamas, and sweat pants. Tops were interesting, in the endearing kind of weird so very on-brand for Cas; a wolf shirt the very staple of thrift establishments, some random high school event tees, button-up shirts in an array of colors, a few overshirts similar to the ones he owns, one black, navy, red, green, but no plaid. What caught Dean's eye was the three in the top of the cart where a kid might sit; a Green Day t-shirt, a Queen tour shirt cropped off halfway, and a soft grey wool cardigan that looked like something either a grandmother or a librarian would wear. His train of thought was cut short by the leather jacket falling into the cart as well. Dean blinked a few times before meeting his best friend's eyes.
"I want to fuck you." Cas gasped, leaning into Dean's mouth. Dean nodded and climbed to his feet to get the lube from his nightstand. Cas sat up and wrenched Dean's towel away. His eyes roved Dean's body appreciatively before pulling him down on the bed. "Lie down on your front, please." He purred, and Dean was on his elbows in an instant, handing back the lubrication.
"Y-yeah? You wanna fuck me?" Dean meant for it to come out as a tease, but it sounded more like a nervous inquiry. Cas broke into a downright predatory grin, sending shivers down Dean's spine.
"I uh, appreciate that, Cas... Um, what conclusions exactly did you draw?" Dean squeaked out because frankly he still wasn't sure what was going on here.
Cas had slashed the leg of the demon to his right and grappled the one to his left. As the first one went down, his palm met its forehead and smote it out of its meatsuit. The middle one charged him, but he spun the demon in his grip, shielding himself by launching his captive forward onto the blade, then seizing the neck of the remainder, holding him in place firmly. He turned to the bewildered hunters casually.
was that?" Dean asked airily, moments later when he remembered how to breathe again. Cas, who had buried his face in Dean's neck and practically deflated, took a moment to respond.
The aforementioned guitar solo currently happened to be giving Dean a crisis, the notes long associated with seduction. He had lied down to 'test' his tape the previous night and embarrassingly enough, hardly made it past the drumbeat before Jimmy Page launched into a masterfully curated solo.
Dean sighed and let himself go, he lapped at Cas's fingers like he was starving. He held Cas's heated gaze and felt his dick wake back up, twitching underneath his towel.
And then Dean was gone with him, arching up off the bed to knot his fingers in Cas's hair and lave his tongue into his mouth as his dick shot spurts of cum all over his stomach and chest. Dean watched as Castiel's hips slowed to a stop and he pulled out gingerly, returning to Dean after licking up the mess on Dean's skin as if it were something he was just inquisitive about. Dean felt his jaw drop open.
By early evening it was overcast in Lincoln, the impala pulled into a plaza containing both a thrift store and a superstore, so they entered the thrift store in search of clothes and whatever other gems they may find.
"No! I mean- yeah sure I guess for the variety, but c'mon Sammy, we gotta teach him music the way we learned it! Cassette is superior, everyone knows."
Castiel nodded and plopped himself into the passenger seat. Dean shut the trunk and got in beside him. He turned the key in the ignition, and the Impala roared to life as Dean maneuvered out of their underground garage and into the daylight. Castiel rolled down his window as Dean pulled out onto 36 to head west and opened up on Baby's throttle, feeling the ever-present knot of tension in his chest loosen as her V8 sang through the chassis beneath them. He pulled the first tape from his pocket and presented it to the former angel, who took it and inspected it.
"Yeah?"  He asked, breath heaving as he leaned up to his eye level.
drifted through the stereo speakers and the tape deck popped, Dean eyed the remaining fresh tape and got a spark of inspiration to make another.
"I just put my thumb in your mouth and you feel the need to ask-" Cas's snark was cut short by Dean pressing him up against the counter and slotting their lips together. Cas gripped the front of Dean's shirt and kissed him back like a man dying of thirst. This is why Dean's thought process is filled with question marks when Cas puts a hand firmly on his chest and pulls back to speak.
"Of course, Dean." He pulled out carefully and leaned away for Dean to position himself on his back. Castiel admired the flush that spread down Dean's neck and covered most of his chest. He leaned forward to suck dark hickeys into Dean's collarbone to contrast. Dean reached down to guide Cas back inside, sighing amorously when he was seated again.
Dean’s head fell against the wheel as he tried to forget the way Cas had smiled before The Empty took him. He had never seen Cas smile like that before – as though a great burden had been lifted from his shoulders; as though merely confessing those three words to Dean had brought him a sense of peace that he had never quite been able to achieve.
He’d said that Jack wasn’t family, but he’d lied. He’d had to lie – to Sam and himself. The prospect of losing Jack had shattered him enough and he wasn’t allowed to break; not with billions of lives at stake. Chuck had been willing to kill the
Had it only been four months since then?
He lay down and crossed his front paws. “Your job is to find them. Even if you don’t catch one, just try and scent one out.”
at it. In fact, we were the best in the family at making a profit, regardless of the cost to our clients. We treated everyone like shit!”
“Sleep? Kind of necessary, Cas,” Sam replies absently, wondering if he should turn the laptop off now and call it a night himself.
“Maybe I should Google this,” Castiel frets, sitting at Dean’s side on the edge of the bed. Dean is collapsed back on mountains of pillows, eyes shut and pale as Death. The urge inside of Castiel to just press a hand against Dean and take all of that aching and heat and pain away is almost too much to bear. Dean has been wounded before but now Cas feels helpless. He cannot make this go away. He has to wait. He doesn’t know if he can. After all this is Dean. He raised him from hell, brought him back to his body and Sam. There’s very little he wouldn’t do for Dean.
The rest of his torso appears to be unremarkable. He has seen Dean and Sam without their shirts many times and they both are far more impressive than he is in that department. He supposes years of training and hunting will do that to a person and he is not quite there yet. But for the first time in thousands of years, Cas feels insecure when he remembers their muscular backs, well-built shoulders and flat stomachs. They are the epitome of male beauty. And again, he doubts why Dean – the Righteous man, perfection made flesh – would choose somebody like him.
“I was surprised!” Dean says defensively. Gabriel raises one shoulder and then drops it, in a half shrug.
“I’ll say.” Gabriel seems to be deliberately taking his time to move the car, and no amount of urging from Cas will make him move any faster. He may be doing as asked, but damn it if he’s not going to make things as difficult as possible.
“Cas...” Dean starts to say, as Cas puts down his armful of dishes in a more sedate manner onto the counter. But Cas is already turning to him, eyes bright and anxious.
“Well? What is it then? Gonna make an honest man out of Cassie?”
“You believe that we will be together in the future?” Cas asks softly, tracing his fingers over Dean’s cheekbones.
The door opens and he starts. As an angel he would have heard – sensed – Dean coming a mile off. But now Dean is coming through the door, takeout in one hand, jingling the car keys in the other.
“No!” The word is ripped from Dean’s mouth before he can stop it. Cas frowns and across the room Sam grunts in his sleep, half stirring at his brother’s raised voice.
Dean allows himself to be led back to bed and slides under the covers while Cas toes off his shoes before climbing in beside Dean. He’s still wearing the trench coat but Dean doesn’t mind and wraps his fingers around it, feeling oddly safe. There are warm fingers in his hair and a pleasant spicy scent lulling him back to sleep.
Dean pulls out the chair for Cas and doesn’t miss the shy look Cas gives him or how the way his fingers slowly brush down Dean’s arm. They’re good. They’re so, so good.
“Ok, this way,” Sam says and pulls on Cas’ shirt sleeve so that the angel follows him over to the bed Dean is sleeping in. Sam yanks back the covers on the empty side of the bed and gestures at Cas several times before groaning in exasperation and yanking on his arm.
But after the first night where Cas has no idea on how to even turn on the TV, it works fairly well. Dean falls asleep comforted by the fact that his angel is in the room, only a few feet away and Cas is so intrigued by bad early morning TV that Dean can sleep all night without being poked awake by a bored angel.
“What?” Dean asks blearily, cracking open an eyelid at Cas.
“Yes, you are, Cas,” Dean had gently reminded him. “You are now. You should get used to it or it’ll eat you up.”
They stay huddled together for a while, Cas watchful, Dean dozing until there’s the purr of the Impala in the drive and Sam’s arrival announced noisily by a slammed door and a welcoming call.
“…meet us at Bobby’s,” Sam finishes lamely. He’s not that surprised even though Cas hates driving anywhere. But it’s time with Dean and for the first time Sam feels a twinge of resentment. It’s been a while since he got any real time alone with his brother. Even this evening was marred by Dean constantly checking his phone, hoping Cas would call.
“Cas, if you keep talking, I may have to withhold sex and believe me, that’s gonna hurt me just as much as it will you.”
“Her friends think it’s an unwise endeavour too. Why is her self esteem based entirely on what that young man thinks?”
“I’m going to kill you,” is what he finally snarls, snapping his gaze to Gabriel.
“What was that for?” Cas asks in a daze, when Dean is done and Cas’ mouth is slick and red.
“An inadequate one,” Cas agrees, resisting the urge to spoil the moment by checking Dean’s temperature again.
Thankfully, Cas steps in.
“Uh, sorry, Dean. He caught me by surprise a little.”
“Yeah. No one died, nothing got blown up, Gabriel didn’t spill something pink and sticky on the sofa…” Dean drawls, eyes drifting to the other sofa. Gabriel and Sam are sitting a bit close for his liking but he figures he can let it go this once.
“Why?” Gabriel asks finally.
“If you could,” he says bluntly, tightening his grip on Cas’ waist a fraction.
See? Social conventions, what social conventions? To Gabriel, they’re more like guidelines.
“Good. I believe next on the list is sustenance. The internet says soup is crucial to this kind of ailment.” This jolts Dean out of his military operation shower induced shock enough to say “What? Crucial? Cas, what have you been reading? Soup is not going to help!” But Cas is gone and Sam finds him five minutes later, standing in Bobby’s kitchen, staring at the fridge as if it might tell him something.
Lisa shook her head, smile widening.
Bewildered by the sudden departure of their attackers, Lucifer and Raphael stumbled over to Michael in hopes of guiding him away from the new threat – whoever could frighten The Fallen like that were obviously a force to be reckoned with – but as they neared their brother, they realised that running wasn’t going to be an option.
Their incredibly annoying host, in Dean’s humble opinion.
Castiel snorted and received a glare for his efforts.
A moment later, Hannah sprung from her northern position and let loose a string of vicious snarls and barks as she galloped towards the herd. The deer bellowed and bleated and raced south, oblivious to the pack lying in wait for them.
Dean’s mouth tugged downwards and he crept towards the stall. “Why’d you do it? After everything we planned?”
“At least I don’t get off on torturing people.”
Castiel shifted into him. “I liked the way things were.” A pause. “Besides, if I had said something sooner, Sam and I would have had to deal with you and your gay panic for at least two months. It would have been exhausting.”
Castiel squinted at him. "And this is, suddenly an uncomfortable topic for you?" He asked.
Castiel removed his hand from Dean's drooling dick and trailed his fingertips up the hunter's left arm hesitantly. Dean watched as his hand slotted over the fading handprint on his shoulder with what felt like an electric shock.
Then the tension in Dean's core snapped, and he was coming without so much as a moment's attention to his dick, clinging to Cas's shoulders with a fucked out whine. Cas kept going and Dean's synapses felt like they were being deep-fried as Castiel's stuttering hips drove him in deeply one, two then a final time as he emptied himself into Dean with a low groan. He then pulled out slowly and rolled off a now depleted Dean to spoon him.
"I am not a musician, nor a Rastafarian, Dean. Claire simply pointed out that I think too much, and that cannabis is known to help." He drew in a deep hit and outstretched his arm to Dean, the cigarette balanced between two fingers. Smoke twirled lazily into the air around him.
Castiel dug his fingers into Dean's thighs, and Dean absently hoped they would bruise before stars burst behind his eyelids. The new angle and speed had Cas nailing his prostate dead on, ripping noises from Dean with each thrust.
"Another mix? There's uh, this one... but- it's kinda personal-" Dean bumbled, trying to put the tape back in his pocket but missing it. Cas grabbed it from him gently.
"Dean." He ground out as the hunter ducked down to mouth at his neck, rocking steadily into Castiel. Dean pushed Cas's shirt up, appreciating the firm muscular abdomen beneath his hands.
Okay, so Claire taught him how to french inhale. Dean idly wondered if he knew what ghosting was, before passing it back and returning to his task, pretending like his lungs didn't burn from the comparative lack of practice.
His hand met a bottle tucked underneath his spare clothes. He returned to Castiel triumphantly, tossing the bottle beside the fallen angel, who was still laying there in his boxers, patiently waiting despite clearly being as hard as Dean felt.
Dean yelped, trying to meet Cas's thrusts to no avail.
"Toothbrush, razor, deodorant, et cetera, all taken care of, for starters. And beer, of course." Dean grinned, pulling three bottles from the six-pack's carton and distributing them.
"You may have a sexual preference for hands, which makes sense, given your previous statements regarding slapping." Cas hummed into his coffee and, yeah okay Dean needed to end this conversation before he melted from shame.
"I think you know that's not true." Castiel hummed, placing the fresh joint between his lips, bringing the flame of his zippo to the end, and inhaling deeply.
"Jeez, the Men of Letters really hit it home on the covert placement of their digs." Dean sighed and scrubbed a hand over his chin. Sam and Cas murmured their agreement. Lebanon didn't even have a Mcdonald's.
, arpeggiating guitar, and a slow swing on the drums.
Dean's not a creep. He's not, he swears. It's just that he's... noticing things now that he's not on high alert for monsters anymore.
After the street lights slowly stopped dotting the empty roads, Dean flicked on Baby's high beams and engaged in a little foolery, pulling the handbrake to let the back end fishtail around corners in the midwestern night, the slick road allowing the heavy car to slide easier across the pavement...
." Dean managed to get his knees under himself and Cas slicked himself up, working the head of his cock into Dean's fluttering hole. He clutched at Dean's hips and slowly rocked himself in deeper.
When Sam was gone, he was still staring at Cas in confusion.
"These lyrics are very... provocative." Castiel mused, sipping from his half-empty bottle. Dean was pulled out of his reverie by his coughing fit.
as Dean made his way down the steps and through the foyer to find his brother and their freshly human resident sitting at the table in the library with a laptop between them.
"Relax, my love." Cas moaned, rolling his hips into Dean, captivated by the catch of skin around him. "Do you want to move?" He asked, and released his iron hold on Dean's waist with a chuckle when Dean nodded eagerly. Dean thrust back against Cas with abandon. A surprised gasp was drawn from both of them as Cas sped up his thrusts to match. Dean was going to come if Cas didn't slow down, so he gathered his thoughts enough to speak up.
"Uh," Dean's brain replied dumbly. "Can I kiss you?" His dick helped with that one.
"N-No, Cas I think we're good, knock yourself out..." he rasped as Castiel tightened his grip on the demon's throat, and light burned out from under its skin. Sam and Dean had picked themselves up off the floor by now and made their way to the middle of the room.
"Yeah, well, it is, but you can't play vinyl in the car." He turned his attention to the fallen angel on his left. "So, Cas, uh, what do you say we have a mini road trip to Lincoln tomorrow and we'll get you set up?" He nudged his elbow with a lighthearted grin, which Castiel returned.
"Thanks, man, I appreciate it. I'm gonna go grab some grub, probably just pick up a pizza and some beers or something." Sam held his hand out for the impala keys. Dean tossed them to him with half a mind.
"Oh, right, yeah, let me just- uh," Dean scrambled up and back to sit on his heels and pulled Castiel into a sitting position. "I'll get us back on the road as soon as possible but we can't drive back to Lebanon on the spare. Call Sammy and tell him we'll be back tomorrow morning after I can buy a replacement in town."
"Can I help you with something too, Dean?" He quirked an eyebrow over his book. Dean cleared his throat and shook his head.
Dean was a little concerned that he noticed Cas's hands before he noticed the toned and tanned chest underneath the shirt. He ran a hand down his face and moved to pour more coffee. Cas passed over the pot and turned to the stack of pancakes, tossing two onto a plate and proceeding to destroy them with fruit and whipped cream.
He lifted the back end and wrenched off the wheel with the flat, with mild difficulty due to the rain-slick, well, everything. He placed the temp onto the wheel hub, muttering apologies to Baby while he did it, claiming she'd have a fresh set of tires tomorrow, and no later. He shed his flannel, now soaked from leaning against the car while he worked.
"I think I'm in love with you." Dean wheezed, and Castiel grinned into his hair.
"Good work, buddy," Dean panted as Cas piled up the bodies at his feet, and wiped blood away on his jeans. "Guess you hardly need us."
Dean fumbled around for the camp lantern tucked under the seat and made for the door, cheeks burning and trying to ignore the frustrating tightness in his jeans. Castiel caught him by the sleeve, causing Dean to meet his intense blue gaze before surging forward to give him a slow parting kiss.
Sam leveled Dean with a
"Well if we're fast and there's no traffic, we should be able to get home by 11." Dean checked his watch and turned the key in the ignition before flicking on the windshield wipers and putting the car in gear. Cas nodded and flipped the tape back over and letting it start over again. Dean couldn't help but grin to himself.
He followed Cas inside and tossed the keys onto the dining table. Castiel ditched the assortment of bags and rounded on Dean, crowding him up against the wall and kissing him hard. Dean couldn't prevent the moan it prompted from his chest. His hands slid the flannel from Cas's shoulders and he began to pull at the shirt he vaguely remembered was his own. Castiel pulled back and shed his top layers, pulling Dean's damp shirt off immediately afterward and attacking his mouth again.
Dean pulled it out and held it out to Castiel who placed it in the breast pocket of the borrowed flannel underneath his cardigan. Castiel checked his phone for the weather.
"Yes, Cas." He breathed, and Cas grinned and shrugged off his shirt, tossing it into Dean's desk chair.
too fast, like, horny teenager levels of speed. He tugged at Cas's hair with a whine.
Dean yanked the white cotton down his thighs, gawking at the sight he was met with. Castiel's long, thick cock caused his mouth to water and his breath to hitch nervously.
"What time would you like to leave?" Castiel asked, picking at the bowl of sliced fruit that Sam must have left. Dean disregarded it and made for the fridge, sure of leftover bacon.
It is pretty incredible because Sam was pretty sure that Dean was so screwed up he’s never be able to keep a relationship going for longer than sneaking out of the girl’s room while she’s still asleep, never mind going all dreamy and happy whenever said partner’s name is mentioned. And Dean has a habit of insisting that he doesn’t want what he wants even if what he wants will make him truly happy so that he’s doing something for himself for once is probably the first time it’s happened in Dean’s life. And it does. Dean is happy. Happy like Sam has never seen him. He laughs more and is gentler somehow and lighter. Yes, there’s the apocalypse but Dean isn’t drowning under the weight of it like he had once been.
“I heard her, Cas,” Dean says wearily.
That, Dean can do.
When Cas reappears upstairs without soup Dean stares blankly at him. “What happened to ‘the internet says soup is crucial’?”
It’s a little adorable so Dean grabs Cas before he can fluff the cushions again and pulls him into a deep kiss. Cas flounders for a second before melting into it.
“I realised that I am incapable of cooking for you. Sam went to retrieve food for you instead. Drink this.” Cas pushes a glass of water into the hunter’s hand and Dean has drained half of it before pausing to take a breath.
His eyes are quite nice, he considers, tired and old aside. A lovely shade of blue, surrounded by many eyelashes. He far prefers Dean’s bright green shade but his are pleasant as well.
“If that’s not devotion I don’t know what is,” Dean declares and pulls Cas further onto the bed with him and leans against his chest. Cas swings his feet onto the bed and wraps an arm around Dean. The crisp cotton of the angel’s shirt is rubbing into Dean’s cheek and there’s the stiff material of a tie wedged behind his ear but Dean is comfortable, the most comfortable he’s been for the last few days all because Cas is rubbing the back of his neck and warm and firm under Dean’s fingers.
“I know,” Dean replies, switching the TV off, so conditioned is he to Cas’ ‘meal time is family time.’
“Did the internet lie? Should I give Dean another flavour of soup?” Sam curses the day when Dean decided falling for an angel would be a good idea. It’s been nothing but headaches and awkwardness and brain bleach.
“So, I have places to be,” she informs him frostily.
“Enough time for what?” Dean asks suspiciously. Gabriel only waggles his eyebrows suggestively.
“Well, I do not care if other people find me attractive,” he says softly, voice hitching as Dean squeezes a little more insistently.
Gabriel – the demon, the pillock, the baby brother molesting asshole – pulls himself away from Sam, with a lazy smile. “Oh, hey guys,” he says calmly, as though his mouth hadn’t just been attached to Sam’s neck.
The first time Dean gets the flu after being raised from the pit, Castiel is at a loss of how to help him.
“She does,” Dean yawns, padding over to his boyfriend. He checks on Sam as he goes but apparently Elle Woods’ screams of frustration have not woken him. Lucky bastard. “Scoot.” Cas does, attempting to make room on the faded chair before Dean plops himself down on Cas’ lap. Cas tenses up, apparently momentarily uncomfortable, before he wraps an arm around Dean’s waist and another into Dean’s lap to hold his hand
“I love Cas. S’all there is to it,” Dean says shortly. She raises an eyebrow at him, as if to say ‘I was only asking’ but says nothing.
“Got dizzy when I tried to wash my hair,” Dean explains with a tired, ‘please don’t panic’ smile. Castiel studies the hunter for a moment, then the shower and then after a moment’s contemplation, climbs into the tub as well.
“Yeah, Dean, I’m sure. You gonna be ok with this?” he says quietly, settling his eyes on Dean’s. Dean knows they’re doing what Cas calls the Winchester mind meld but he doesn’t care. He can see all he needs to know in Sam’s eyes. Finally he gives a one shouldered shrug.
“It’s the eyes,” Dean says. “You should know Sam pulls that puppy dog eyes trick too.” Gabriel’s eyes widening a fraction is the only reaction Dean gets but it’s worth it.
“Yeah.” Sam struggles for the right words. Why isn’t Dean awake for this? It’s an unspoken rule that Dean is the one to explain all of this crap to Cas. Sam maintains that it’s the boyfriend’s duty to illuminate clueless angels and then give a demonstration. Sam is not giving a demonstration.
Sam doesn’t really mind so long as they keep it to a minimum in front of him. Hand-holding is fine. Castiel absent-mindedly stroking the underside of Dean’s wrist while they watch TV is pretty cute. Some kissing is fine. Tongues is not. Neither is Cas turning up without warning and Sam arriving back to the room and catching them yelping and doing some serious naked-scrambling for the covers. He set down some ground rules after that. If Cas is going to appear without even calling first, try and consider innocent Samuels who have only stepped out of the room briefly for more beer and don’t wish to come back to see his brother’s bare ass.
Cas doesn’t know where to look. He doesn’t want to look at the mirror or his body and he can’t bear to look at Dean either and see the emotions flicking through those deep green eyes. His hand by his side clenches and unclenches in frustration and something in the back of his throat hurts, like something is stuck and is grating along the passage. He realises belatedly that he is trying not to cry and that feeling comes from trying to hold it back.
“Alright, that’s enough!” Gabriel booms suddenly. Cas and Dean part and look over to where Gabriel is getting up and stretching.
“And cream!” Dean suddenly remembers, as he makes good on his earlier promise and pulls Castiel into the house by his belt loops.
He still isn’t sure about the word ‘cock’ however.
“I think we pulled it off,” Cas whispers in his ear and Dean shivers at the hot breath on his earlobe. He’s desperate to get their guests out of here by now so they can leave their dishes in the sink and he can pull this gorgeous man up to their bed by his belt loops.
“It’s just as well you’re a pretty good boyfriend then,” Dean murmurs, being lulled into sleep by Cas’ rhythmic stroking.
“Dean…” Cas murmurs when they pull apart. “We don’t have time for this.” But that kiss has put Dean in the mood and Cas looks so hot in his green shirt.
Cas hadn’t noticed, completely delighted to introduce him as ‘my Dean’ while Dean and the old bat had stared each other down in a show of instant dislike. She tolerates Cas but whether it’s some throwback from a more homophobic generation or it’s Dean’s attitude she dislikes, Dean can’t figure out.
“You are not to get out of bed again,” Cas says sternly. “If you need something, you will tell me.”
And then there’s the tiny voice inside Sam’s head that is shrieking in disbelief not because Dean is holding hands and giving goodbye kisses but because he is holding hands and kissing Cas. Angel of the Lord, Jimmy Novak possessing, serious and gravelly Castiel.
His jaw is strong and masculine, he has striking cheekbones and his nose is neither overly large nor strangely shaped. He concludes that his face is attractive enough, although he’s still unsure how well it pleases Dean.
“I wasn’t doing anything weird!” Dean’s voice goes up a notch with embarrassment. “Cas is in the bathroom!”
“Why do humans consider it such a luxury?” Castiel asks curiously. “You seem to enjoy sleeping more than the required amount.”
“Hell, Cas!” Sam hisses and hurriedly checks the bed. Dean hasn’t stirred.
In the bathroom Cas patiently strips Dean and pushes him gently into the shower. Dean whines and bitches and complains frequently while Cas stands at the door, watching the faint outline of Dean’s body through the curtain. When Dean goes quiet, that is when Cas pulls the curtain back and finds Dean leaning against the wall, looking pale.
“Dean, I do not see the problem,” he insists. The keys slip through Dean’s fingers and he cusses loudly and has to stoop to pick them up. The bag handles are digging into his arm and Mrs Parker is looking more scandalised by the minute. He knows exactly what she thinks of them and the funny thing is that she would probably like Cas on his own. Neat, quiet and polite Castiel who does not yell ‘fuck!’ when he drops things, play Led Zeppelin very loudly while washing the car on a Sunday afternoon or give interfering old biddies the finger when their backs are turned. Who wears a suit and goes to Church and says ‘good morning’ to the neighbours. Yep, Dean’s boy is an honest-to-God upstanding member of society.
“So, Dean,” Gabriel says casually and something about his tone makes all of the hair of the back of Dean’s neck stand on end. Nothing good can come from the glint in Gabriel’s eye like that.
Except for him.
And then the worst happens. Dean takes his hand away and steps back, leaving Castiel cold and empty.
“But that time I had to, you and Dean made it very clear that I should not discuss those kinds of things…” Cas protests and Sam holds up a hand to interrupt him.
Gabriel finally acquiesces in getting into the car but only because Cas is about to turn blue.
Attraction. It seems to be very important in human society. Relationships hinge on it. Sometimes, someone will be attracted to a member of the opposite (or the same) sex and try to initiate a proposition of some kind. Cas has seen these many times. Sometimes, they are brief and purely sexual. And sometimes they are more. Sometimes, they are everything. He knows this all too well.
Cas doesn’t quite get that sleep is not only a necessity, Dean quite enjoys it. Just because there’s an apocalypse in the works doesn’t mean that Dean can’t lie in every once in a while. Last time he checked Michael and Lucifer needed their meat suits and besides, a tired hunter is as good as a dead one. Actually, a tired hunter nearly always ends up a dead one anyway.
“Dunno. I think we bonded over difficult relatives,” Dean says with a shrug. Their neighbour has climbed into her car and is reversing out of her drive and looking at her, Dean is reminded of her and Gabriel glaring daggers at each other. “That or she found someone she dislikes more than me.”
So tired. Do all humans look this weary? Cas touches the bags under his eyes cautiously. He looks old, which is ridiculous. He is old. But he shouldn’t bloody well look it, he thinks grumpily.
“Geez, Cas,” he mumbles. “I’m not…”
Maybe twice.
“Doesn’t matter,” Dean says softly. “You’re still you. Still incredible and clever and brave. Shit, Cas, you believed in me when no one else did. Even Sam chose a demon over me. But you never lose faith or stop trying to take care of me.”
Cas knows from experience, that the waitress was attractive by Earth standards. Not by angel standards or peacock standards but for a human girl, she is very pretty. She also has many traits Dean likes: a full bottom, large bosoms, a red mouth. None of which Cas really has. So he’s started to wonder why Dean finds him attractive.
Family is very tiring.
“No, but thank you,” Cas has relaxed a little bit, letting the tension slip out of his shoulders. “Go watch TV until our brothers arrive.”
Castiel pushes aside the shower curtain and studies them carefully. He reaches out and turns one cautiously only to be drenched in ice cold water. Cas spits out a mouthful and turns it off again. He’s very tempted to use his powers for this but he’s determined to do this the human way (and vanishing those tissues did not count. Immune to human disease or not, deep and furious love for Dean or no, he’s not touching those.)
To be honest, that was not how he had hoped for his first shower with Cas to go.
“Anything I can do to help?” Dean feebly offers, although he knows Cas will never take him up on it. Don’t get him wrong, Dean is pretty capable in the kitchen but Cas can be a bit of a control freak sometimes and feels like he has to do everything himself.
“Blow jobs?” he asks hopefully. Castiel’s lips twitch and he bends down to whisper into Dean’s ear.
“I can’t believe you invited him,” Dean fumes as he attempts to juggle three shopping bags and the door keys. He’s pissed off enough as it is because a child sneezed on him in the check-out line and some ass in a Mercedes nearly clipped his baby in the parking lot. Luckily for the douchebag, he just missed because otherwise Dean wouldn’t be standing here right now with leaking ice-cream dripping on his foot and nosy Mrs Parker from next door peeking through her curtains at the sound of his raised voice. Dean forces a smile and a wave and is silently grateful that he didn’t run over the Mercedes guy, purely because she’d be so damn smug if he ended up in jail. That old bat has been a pain ever since they moved in and is particularly snide to Dean. He doesn’t want to give her the satisfaction.
Once Dean had left to fetch them some dinner and Sam was still stuck at the local library, researching, Castiel stripped off all of his clothes and stood in front of the crappy mirror in their motel room.
“That’d be nice, bro,” Gabriel says, grinning (the lollipop is gone, and they turned the cushion over until Dean can bribe Ellen into working her magic on it.) “I think a couple of months is more than enough time.” His eyes slide lasciviously over Sam, who blushes and sheepishly looks at his feet, grinning.
Castiel is not surprised. But all he has to do is listen out for the ever-present hum that is Dean’s soul and follow it to the living room where his other half is curled up in an extremely ugly yellow blanket and watching TV.
Dean never liked conservatories anyway and now he likes procedural cop shows even less than he did before.
“That’s a bit far. But you don’t suck,” Gabriel admits grudgingly. “You have some pretty decent taste with pie. And you treat Cas well. He’s happy. He has everything he wants. You can’t seem to resist making sure he has every tiny little whim fulfilled.”
Good Lord, he’s bonding with Mrs Parker. Gabriel, you fuckwit, this is all your fault.
It was a few days ago. They were in a diner, Sam on his laptop, Dean trying to teach Cas the joys of Earth food. But after Famine, Cas is eager to stay away from cheeseburgers or anything so incredibly indulgent, so it was slow-going.
Dean opens his mouth again now that Cas has removed his hand but then closes it hurriedly. Cas is using The Voice.
Because that’s what he was now. Human. And all these thoughts and insecurities were so very mortal. And he hated it. And the only reason he was worrying about it at all, was to please the person he fell for.
“I know, Dean.” Cas lifts his head a little to look Dean straight in the eyes. “I have faith in you. And I am sorry about Gabriel. He’s always very forward. He’s only trying to look out for me.” Dean sighs heavily and slides his hand from Cas’ hair to his chin so they can kiss.
Cas does not entirely understand this. Surely it is his duty as his lover to take care of Dean?
The knock on the door as Dean is chasing the last crumbs around his plate with his finger is not normal though. Dean pauses with a finger in his mouth and exchanges a look with Cas.
“So, you…like me?” Gabriel snorts derisively.
“Dean has not attempted to cuddle with me. And we have had many opportunities in bed together,” Castiel explains sulkily. Sam rubs at his eyes blearily. It’s too late for this.
Shit, Cas looks so happy. But there are lines that should never be crossed and sucking on Sam’s neck like a vampire is one of them.
“Bro!” Gabe somehow manages to drown Cas in a hug, despite his size. Cas looks delighted to have a hug from his older brother while Sam slides up to Dean.
What’s weirder is that Cas is mushy and kissy-faced right back at Dean.
Now, however, he was absently tracing its outline after a shower, staring more through the mirror than at it while recalling the events of breakfast. Jack had playfully started the comparing hand sizes game that seems to entertain kids so much.
"It says it's supposed to stop raining soon. We could wait out the storm and listen to more music?"
"What did you mean by personal items, Sam?" Cas asked before gingerly sipping at the foam that had accrued at the top of his bottle. Not that Dean was looking, or anything.
That turned out to be a bad idea, as many of Dean's ideas do. Cas was sat in a lawn chair with the tunnel doors cracked, rolling a joint. Dean had pointedly ignored him, turning to rinse the car until Cas spoke up.
"When was the last time we cleaned our firearms?" Cas asked, swirling his finger through the toppings of his breakfast before popping it in his mouth. Dean set his mug down, a little too hard. Cas gave him a look.
"We need lube. I'll be right back." He stumbled out of bed, kicking off his boxers, jeans, and boots the rest of the way, beginning to dig deep in his duffel, muttering a small
"I think I'm happy with these, Dean. Are you ready to go?" Castiel asked, tilting his head at the device in Dean's hand.
"So, you like your tape? I can always put different songs on it or-"
"I'm ready to go whenever, just let me know," Dean replied, throwing together his sandwich.
He resumed his position and Castiel sat up, placing his hands on Dean's hips as he leaned in to capture one of Dean's nipples in his mouth, sucking gently and pulling ragged breaths from the hunter's throat. He groped around for the bottle next to them, bringing his hands around Dean's back to slick his fingers up before discarding the bottle beside them.
"I liked the mix you made, do you have any more?" He rummages through the box of tapes, frowning at the album covers and lack of homemade tapes. Dean pulled out his second tape from his jacket's inner pocket and turned it over in his hands.
Castiel reached a hand down to palm Dean's erection. Dean almost protested. He wasn't ready for this to be over, except that Cas's brow was knit together with a rapt expression and he was gasping out little grunts in contrast to Dean's lewd moaning.
"Hey, sweetheart." Dean hummed, lathering the soap in his hands and spreading it over his frame, grinning when Cas began to help.
Dean clutched at Cas's biceps, only hyperventilating until Castiel bottomed out and bit back another sound. Dean pulled him close enough to share breath when Cas set a moderate rhythm.
"Did you need him for anything else?" Dean bit down on his tongue in a failed attempt to reintroduce moisture to his mouth.
"At first I thought you were just insecure about your hand size, but surely you'd have gotten over that in a day. Then I did some research and decided to... Encourage you." He continued casually as if Dean wasn't praying for the earth to swallow him whole.
Heat burst from Dean's stomach as he pushed a hand back into Castiel's hair, pulling the fallen angel closer with a content sigh. Cas wasn't half bad at kissing, but Dean knew that already, recalling the incident with Meg and- realizing... some things, in retrospect. Dean sure hadn't expected a sexuality crisis when he woke up that morning. Seems a little late to start now.
"Please, Sweetheart... I need you... Need you inside me,
"You're doing so well, Dean... Are you ready?" Cas mumbled into Dean's mouth.
Castiel picked intently through every shirt that would potentially fit, masculine or feminine. Dean's eyes nearly fell out of his head when he saw Cas considering a sheer mesh shirt and he mumbled some excuse about cassettes before wandering off to the tech area.
"Do you want to stay like this?" Castiel asked, breathless from the hot slide between Dean's grip. Dean shook his head and wobbled his way up to lay back on the pillows, letting his legs fall open, and casting Cas a lecherous gaze. Castiel turned and grabbed Dean by the thighs, yanking him from his half reclined position into a less dignified horizontal one before angling them up and scooting forward to press his straining cock into Dean's hole, sinking into his tight, wet heat.
