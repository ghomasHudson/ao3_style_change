“I can drink at least ten fold what you did and not feel a thing, you are a lightweight.” He laughs again, Dean’s ears full of his sound despite blood rushing to his head.
“No, we shouldn’t need to intubate, he’s breathing on his own.”
The last six years suddenly make sense to Dean. Every look they shared, holding more emotion than just eye contact.  Even the first time his eyes met Cas's, he knew in that barn, no matter what was coming, he'd never be the same afterwards.  Every touch; hugs that were just this side of too tight, hands brushing more and more, touching shoulders as they pass in the hallway.  One of the first things Cas told Dean: I grabbed you tight and raised you from Perdition; he never let go after, not really. Every "I need you" meaning something slightly more than the words could hold. He's been so careful these last few years, fooling himself into thinking if he didn't actually say the words then there's no way it could be true.  How wrong he was.
Dean’s emotions are plain on his face.  He wants to apologize to Cas, he wants to say that it’s okay, that he’s being stupid.  Cas knows this because he knows the hunter well enough by now.  But Dean just sighs as he continues to look at Cas.
Then he pounds his fists against the brick wall, the masonry shuddering under the force of it, his blood staining the wall.  His anger is too great for the limitations of the vessel; he can’t shake the ground with his fury, he can’t set fire fire to the earth in his despair.  He has to settle for the force his vessel can handle.
They clean up and the three of them end up side by side on the couch. A couple days before they set up six foot Christmas tree they found discarded on someone’s driveway. Cas and Sam decorated it with strings of empty shell casings and salt rounds and hung some of the coasters Sam collects from bars.  Cas perched a glass star on top that he specifically went out and bought, it hangs crookedly now. They sit in front of the tree now, Dean laughing at the ramshackle decorations but liking it none the less.
“Stop,” Dean demands quietly, kneeling on the side of the bed. Cas throws him an irritated glance before extracting his hand and fisting it in the pillowcase. His legs spread automatically when Dean crawls closer.
.  He couldn’t fucking talk to Cas and instead ended up blunty throwing
away if anything happened.
“No, you weren’t!  You think I’m short!” Dean pins Cas’s shoulder down and crouches so his mouth is next to his ear. “Don’t
Dean’s almost positive this is just a phase for Cas, who is still reeling from the battle with Metatron that was only a few months ago.  The angel still has not forgiven himself for Hannah’s death, thinking somehow he could have saved her.  He has woken more than once to find Castiel leaning over his journal or his face too close to the laptop screen as he tries to forget the pain by throwing himself into their work.  It would take fifteen minutes of talking before Cas would concede to laying back down with him.
If Dean was being honest with himself, which seems a more common occurrence these days, he’s known how he’s felt about Cas since Purgatory.  Probably longer.  But Purgatory really solidified it; like Cas said, he’d huddle up to him every night because Cas was safety far beyond anything Dean had ever known.  They were more dangerous together, as a human and angel, Benny reminded them often but Dean didn’t care.  He didn’t want to face those monsters with anyone else.
something,
Finally his grace hones in on the source of the bleeding, and he presses his palms to his chest and stomach, pulsing his power through Dean’s veins.  His hands continue to scan Dean’s body, but there’s just too many wounds.  He’s going to bleed out, he’s already lost too much blood.  Castiel can’t replenish his blood.
,” he mutters under his breath, pressing his first two fingers bluntly against Cas’s hole.
He settles on neutrality. “Did you want to eat dinner tonight?”
“I don’t know what to say…” Dean’s stomach drops, he doesn’t feel like he’s going to puke now.  He just feels empty. “Other than— I already fucking knew, jerk.” Sam lets out a laugh that sounds like he’s been holding in entirely too long.
RECORDING TWELVE
Dean’s lips are burning. “I was thinking we could fire up the grill, figuratively, kinda have a cookout, there’s a game on tonight.”  Sometimes Dean doesn’t realize how desperately he craves domesticity.
He uncaps the vial and everything is bathed in his grace’s light as his vessel reabsorbs it and his soul once again bonds with its own.  Castiel’s body suddenly feels full and weightless at the same time; the power strengthening him once again.  He can hear the Enochian passing his lips as he revels in his revived power.  The glass window above him shatters but the shards evade his vessel.
Cas yelps when Dean pinches his nipple and rolls back on top of him, pinning him in place. “Take that back!  Take that back, you bastard!” Dean pinches Cas’s nipple, eliciting another surprised sound. “Take it back!” he laughs, out of breath.
“Oh, no, buddy, I told you last time I didn’t like that.” His face contorts with queasiness as he thinks back.
“You should be able to pick them up in three to five day’s time— we’ll call you.” She’s unwrapping the journal from the bag.
Castiel deflates at this understanding.
“Call,” Dean insists, “if you need anything, hear me?”
The pot crashes into the wall as Cas throws it across the room, hollow echoes ringing as it falls to the ground.  Dean can’t remember the last time he’s seen Cas— there’s just no other word for it— livid.
, baby,” he moans, his hands never leaving Cas’s body as he helps him turn over, Cas still skeptical.
Sam looks over at him, serious now. “Dean, stop, you don’t have to explain. I understand, okay.”
.  He is grateful Cas doesn’t say them aloud because he doesn’t know how he would respond.  Of course he feels the same towards Cas, figured it out for himself when Cas said he had to go fight in the battles.  He can only let those words pass through his mouth so many times without them leading to his own destruction though.
He looks up from his reading and editing, he’s almost done anyways. “Yes?”
“Dean, I don’t understand why you would get my grace back then not take advantage of all the powers I once again possess.  You were always eager before to call upon me when convenient.” His eyes bore into the other’s, as if drilling for the answers.
“Cas, don’t ruin the moment,” Dean softly chastises, his eyes dancing.
Cas sits with his lo mein in hand as he types another keyword into the police database, looking for any other crimes that might relate to the current case even if it’s not a missing person’s.
It is the first Thursday evening in February when Sam breaks the news to his brother; when Dean throws harsh words right back at him.
Half way down the hall to the ER, Cas wills his cellphone back into his pocket.
“Anything, angel, anything…” He grabs Cas’s wrist, placing his hand back on the headboard. Pulling out his cock of Cas was the very bottom thing on the list of what Dean wanted to do, but watching as it slides out of Cas…
You’ve fought how many wars in Heaven?  But hardly any down here!  Down here, Cas, in the fucking
He sees his shadow move as it stands up and leaves, back to the kitchen to get more alcohol. The door shutting behind him is Dean’s queue to sigh loudly.
Dean wishes the kids hadn’t come back.
Cas looks over at Dean, sprawled on the motel bed, over the sheets and three layers of clothes still on.  He could do with a vacation of sorts, even if it was just a week straight of no hunting or research, with only a Netflix marathon to look forward to.
Despite the darkness of the kitchen, Dean finds a bottle of olive oil next to the fridge that Sam will just have to do without on his salads for now.
That light Dean sees in Cas burns white hot as Dean gasps out his name.
They finish up the remaining objects, planning on taking them back to the storage room at the bunker.  Sam suggests a pub across the street, since Dean doesn’t want to drive Baby anywhere right now. Once seated, Dean orders wings and whiskey and Sam settles for chowder.  Soon they’re both convinced to try the
“I say Cas takes the wheel on this one, figuratively, of course,” Sam pipes in, putting his dishes in the sink. “It’s quicker for him to get us there and back, so we could be done with this entire case by tomorrow if we’re lucky.”
“You know what I mean. This reaper is just going to move on to some other town and some other crossroads demon if we don’t stop it. So hurry up, we gotta go before it realizes its friend is missing.”
Dean’s trying not to overthink it.
He throws together some pancakes while Sam watches the coffee percolate. The three of them sit down, still in their pajamas, and joke around.  Sam starts throwing his blueberries on their plates, and in return, Cas wills his plate to the other end of the table.  When Sam walks over to get it, as he’s reaching for it, Cas wills it back to the original spot.  Dean can’t stop laughing as he watches Cas repeat this childish joke on Sam. Sam sneaks some salt into Cas’s coffee in return; Dean’s cup receives some as well just for laughing.
, Cas realizes. “No, Dean, I was not referencing your penis,” he deadpans. “I was talking about your height in general, you should know just because you’re short— ”
“Dean. This way.” Cas is looking at him funny.
Dean makes an offended sound. “I am
. He slips out of his clothes and into his bed, not even bothering to turn the lights on.
— fuck Castiel open, nice and slow, he’s not nearly as nervous or unsure about it as he thought he’d be.  Dean’s flat out excited, and not just because it’s been almost a year since he’s properly fucked anyone.  He’s so fucking thrilled to do this with
. He stands up straighter, waiting until the last moment to pull his hand away from Cas, his fingers dragging.
“I need help,” Cas breathes, still searching for wounds to heal. “I need help,” he repeats, louder this time, less shaky, as the doors to the vestibule slide open.
Dean nods, his throat too tight to speak.  She begins to ring up the total, wrapping the wax set, paper, and journal in a pieces of tissue paper before putting them in the bag.
Dean stirs awake just as the recording finishes, and Cas turns off the device, putting it down so he can turn around and look at Dean.
As soon as Dean’s breathing evens out, Cas walks out the ER doors; finding his way into an alley off the side of the ambulance bay.  He paces for a few moments, trying to reel in the overwhelming emotions.
“You act as if this is some favor I’m doing for them, as if I’m repaying a debt.  I’m doing this because I have to— because I want to.  I’m still an angel, Dean, I’m still a soldier.  I’m still able to help them, so that’s what I’m going to do.  I’ve won battles in the past, this is the same thing, I’m going to aid them in this struggle for freedom.” Cas sounds like a piece of outdated war propaganda.
Cas smile falters slightly. “Oh, I thought this is the part when we left the losers at the table and took the winnings and ran?” His eyes squint, reading Dean’s expression and realizing. “But it is not.”
Then they’re suddenly in the vestibule of an ER, nurses and doctors hurrying past as they tend to other patients.
“And what about the others?” he inquires scathingly.  Frustrated and embarrassed that not one of them has spoken yet.
He finally clicks on the last recording.

He turns to Hannah. “What is the meaning of this?”
at the end of the book.
“Cas,” he moans, unable to tear his eyes off the man’s cock. “Cas,
.  He approaches the body, intent on ripping its limbs off, but changes tactic when he sees the rit zien’s own blade glinting just feet away.
Thank you everyone for reading, seriously, y'all are amazing and wonderful and I don't even know what else, you're just that spectacular!
“If I am not wanted here even now then what are the hopes for my inclusion if I become leader?” He has been angry since the moment he was pulled here, the silence just now filling with his outrage. “I have done what I thought was right, time and time again for Heaven.” Some more murmurs at that. “Yes, I have made mistakes, but haven’t we all?  I tried to repay all of those I have wronged.  Jehoel— Kushiel— Penemue— I have saved all your lives in battle.  Hamon— you remember the debt you owe me from millennia ago?  I have not forgotten.  And yet, even after the Fall, some chose to follow me— they
And like in New Orleans, the hunter lets his body take control.
Dean sighs, rubbing the back of his neck. “Just some sandwiches.  We don’t really have all that much.” He looks down the hall before turning to lead Castiel to the kitchen. “Maybe we could run into town in the next day or two.  Or wait until we get back from the hunt?” Another apology.
By seven-thirty they are on the road, only two hundred miles separating them from the bunker.  The hole they trapped the rougarou in is probably still warm with leftover ashes.  The dashboard clock reads eleven-twenty when Dean parks the Impala in the carport.  Just after noon, and both men are sitting in the library, lunch sits between them, waiting to be finished.
Cas hooks his fingers around Dean’s waist, pulling him closer. Dean cards his fingers through Cas’s hair, loving the expression that comes over his face as his eyes flutter shut and his face turns upwards.
He scratches at his jaw, over two week’s worth of stubble taken up home there.  He can’t meet his own eyes right now, but if that bags under them are any sort of indicator, he’s dead.
“He said he knows you don’t like ‘zapping.’  Besides, you can help me leaf through these files.  There’s at least eighty I haven’t gone through yet.” The piles Sam’s already separated look to have twice as many envelopes as the ones he hasn’t.
. “We thought someone had broken in— stole stuff from The Men of Letters— but then Sam heard you in that room, Cas.” Dean finally looks at Cas.
Dean finally looks up at this; he didn’t find the answer at the end, only a blank page, with a yellowing water stain. “But…?”
There lifestyle, the knowledge they are privy to, it’s fucking annoying.  Because Dean doesn’t know every which way their lives could change, it’s an every changing number with them.  They could be gone tomorrow, it could take decades before they’re finally forever six feet under— hell, they could be sitting on a fucking decaying radioactive substance right now and slowly killing themselves just by living here.  He doesn’t know.  And it scares the shit out of him to know end.  That’s been the hardest part of this whole job since he could remember.
“So you mean to tell me you solved this case all by yourself?” Dean asks, still skeptical.
Dean looks up, he meets Cas’s soft gaze.  His hand cups Cas’s jaw, his thumb stroking across his cheek.  His breath sounds too loud in his own ears.
“Cas,” Dean murmurs between kisses to the angel’s tightened stomach, “come for me.”
It is a Sunday afternoon when Sam refuses to tell Dean where he’s going; when Dean spits anger and threats in his face.
A handwritten note next to display informs him that some fountain pens can be custom engraved.
They get back on the road but it’s slow going with all the snow.  Dean’s pissed because they have to stop for gas twice at the rate they’re going.  They make it back to the bunker just in time for Dean to make dinner by a reasonable hour.
Dean has no words for what he’s feeling and wouldn’t begin to have enough to tell Cas what he should.
He pulls away, smiling.  He rubs the back of his neck and looks out the window, taking in the snow around them. “Yeah, Sam, I think I’m fucking happy.”
Cas knows he’s being petty but he’s so exhausted at this point.
or counting salt rounds.  And you suck at covering up the smell in the car.” Sam’s laughing again, loving the chance to finally have this go at Dean.
!  You’re free to do as you want— you don’t owe them one single goddamned thing!”
They enter the kitchen and Dean hands Cas his sandwich, a replica of the one on Dean’s plate.
“Dean,” Sam laughs, “go fucking finish your game of pool, if you’re not too drunk. You sound like an asshole right now.”
. He scrambles to find the remote, turning it to the weather channel and letting that run as he’s forced to start his day.  Sam’s already out on his morning run, taking advantage of a break in the snow.
“Do you think they’ll be out of those microwave breakfast sandwiches again?” Cas asks, pulling their supply list out of his pocket.
Tonight, Dean is going to be honest even if it kills him.  Even if he won’t be able to convince Cas to stay an angel, he can at least admit to Cas why he doesn’t want him to be mortal.
Dean sighs loudly, almost growling with the anger laced through him in that moment. “Your grace is lost Castiel, this is different than Sam and you know it.”
, a high noise in the back of his throat. Dean wants to laugh but too much lust runs through him for it to be funny, instead his cock jumping at the sound. “I’ll be right back, Cas.”
and just this side of too happy compared to the hunters’ normal persona.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas now looks out the window, despite the blinds blocking it.  “You know how we suspected it was the owner of the properties, Joshua James-Patterson?” Sam and Dean wait for an answer, and Cas continues when they don’t reply, “Well, that body we found in his house last night, was actually not his.  It was another victim’s, this time a decoy though, to throw us off.  Early this morning, before you woke, I found the real Joshua, who was indeed the one committing the sacrifices and practicing voodoo. I took care of him. Thus, now all his spells are reversed and there will be no more zombies or sacrificial murders.” He gets up from the table, still not looking at either one of them.
It’s taken him well over a year to reach this point, and four days of battling with himself to finally admit it.
“We’ve got him set up behind a curtain in the ER for the time being, I can take you to him now.”
“There is a string of suicides in Denver and unexplainable miracles— if you can even call them that— happening in a town outside of Lincoln.” He almost looks proud at knowing about these cases before they do.
“Cas...you wanna come sit with me while I eat?” Dean asks from the other side of the door. “Or, you could eat too.  If you want.” He hesitates. “I made enough.”
) and that Sam might still be on the couch.
“I’m buying a Christmas present.” Dean’s surprised he’s able to say that without gritting his teeth.
Metatron’s tablets. I thought, maybe the older angels of realms before my own would know what to do. They attacked me viciously, not welcoming of outside angels. Michael once told me how the elder angels do not take kindly to us children in their realms.” Cas finally looks his friend in the eyes and Dean feel himself attempting to continue the eye contact despite seeing him continue to shatter.
“What, Dean?” Something inside Dean jerks.
grace..
Cas laughs. Suddenly Dean’s gift doesn’t seem as important.  Cas gave Dean part of his
Thankfully he’s not.
call me short again!” he threatens in mock anger.
The angel’s still squinting at Dean but his hips have a slight sway in them now.
Dean finds the strength to stand, his legs shaking.  He doesn’t bother finishing his shower before turning it off.  He wraps himself in his robe, wraps his knuckles in a towel, grabs a bottle of whiskey from the fridge, and falls onto the couch.
“There’s a baseball game on tonight— Sam’s team is playing— it’s not a big game, but it’s a reason to drink beer and eat burgers none the less.”
Dean’s painfully aware how hard he is now, and foolishly thinks,
Can you figure out what Sam could possibly be hiding in that iPod?  Hint: it's not just music
Right after the sun comes up, a soft light streaming through the windows as it slants across the floor, Dean stirs.  It’s not much movement, no conscious thought behind it, but his hands slip across the bed, grabbing at whatever.  Castiel tries to silently maneuver away without moving but Dean is relentless.  He balls his fists into the shirt Castiel is wearing and pulls him closer.  He’s obviously awake enough to know what he’s doing but he doesn’t say anything, he just pushes and pulls at Castiel until Castiel’s back is pressed firmly to his chest.  He falls back asleep like that.  The angel lets him because he knows they’ve all but finished the case, just loose ends to tie up.
RECORDING ONE
Forcefully, he grabs the skull between his heads, and despite knowing it will have no effect now, flares his grace.
This case has him wound up and frustrated, and he can’t pinpoint why.  His entire being shakes with unease as his thinks of the missing people that are probably suffering at this very moment.
of God—”
He closes his eyes and leans against the wall, it’s cool against his burning skin, his arm still draped over Cas’s shoulder. “Back pocket.” Some random front porch kissing scene runs through Dean’s muddled mind.
The smoke wafting out from under the lid of the pan brings Dean back to reality. He turns the burgers over before replacing the top.
Tearing away at the newspaper reveals a small wooden box, he slowly opens it. “Dammit, Sam,” Dean whispers, wiping his eyes as he picks up the amulet from inside.
He sets his jaw, walking towards them. “I am not as helpless as you two keep thinking.” His hands rise, to grab their shoulders, to ‘zap’ them back to the Bunker.
Dean looks up, his eyes begging Cas not to make him say whatever it is he is going to say next.  Cas doesn’t give in, his arms still crossed; he tilts his head, still waiting.
He smiles in reply, eyes flitting back to the glint of strong feathers before they disappear in the light of the shitty fluorescent when Cas turns it on.
He can’t go another four days without knowing where Cas is, if he’s okay, if he’s safe.  And if that means talking with Cas about what he actually thinks, then so be it.  This argument is no longer about making Cas stay an angel, it’s about making sure Cas stays safe.
.  One of John Winchester’s many sayings whips through Dean’s mind.
“I want to be equal then.”
“You’re not
“Just wait, maybe we can clamp and assess here, don’t get ahead of ourselves!”
. “After everything, you want to just throw it aside?”
Dean can feel Cas’s squinted eyes boring through him. “What aren’t you telling me, Dean?” he asks, his voice rough like gravel.
This is no new confession. He drops his hand and shifts his eyes, ashamed to even look at Cas right now.
Dean still won’t look back at him. “You already left me how many times?  What’s one more time?” Dean knows he’s entirely unfair in saying so, maybe even outright wrong, but he’s too scared to care right now.  He’ll apologize later when Cas decides to keep his grace.
While throwing his clothes in the washer, the tie at the bottom of his duffel stirs something in Dean’s chest that feels like what he felt the first time he and Lisa cooked dinner together.  Something light lifting him, chasing the chill that settled in him last night when Cas left. He rolls up the slip of cloth, tucking it in his back pocket, making a decision.
Dean sighs again, running a hand through Cas’s hair.
“Cas, Cas— Cas!” Dean shakes him.
“Well, Sammy, you’re making an exception tonight.” Dean pulls the burgers off the stove. “I daresay these are the best burgers even I could ask for.” He dips his head in a shallow bow.
Just as he turns around, Cas opens the door to the room, holding a box of what can only be donuts and a carrier of coffees. “I got you two breakfast. We can leave when you’re done.”
Cas steps back, looking abashed as he rubs the back of his neck. Dean takes a guess.
He ignores the way the angel’s warm body slots into his.  He can’t think about it.  The weight of Cas’s frame pulled against his is not the physical contact he’s been craving. It’s not satisfying. Listening to Cas’s breathing doesn’t calm his anxieties. It doesn’t relax him.
“No, not you, Dean. Humans. How do humans live knowing they are so powerless in this world? I can feel myself seeping out, breaking down, I can feel my powers dulling every second.”
Once Sam calms down he explains, “Dean, honestly, I think I knew before you did. When he walked into that water, and we thought he was gone forever, something in you changed. You weren’t like that when Dad died, or later when Bobby died.  You were hollow for weeks after Cas was gone, I thought I was going to have to talk to you about it then.  But he showed up, like Cas always does, and you were okay again— not back to normal but you were okay.
“You’re the one who knows what they are, “ Sam shoots back. “Also, you’re welcome.” He bites into a danish and heads for the bathroom.
Dean’s hands ball into fist, mimicking how tight his chest feels.
“Wh-what?” Dean sputters out, wiping a hand over his face.
) and aims a pointed glare at Cas until he sees navy staring back.  It looks painful for Cas to rise from the sofa, his shoulders heavy as he leads Dean out of the room.
“You can say that again,” Sam chimes in.
Somewhere in between Dean explaining their race around the lazy river and teaching Sam how to properly dive that day, speaking gets easier. His chest doesn’t feel locked. Cas’s presence next to him, his warmth, makes his stomach knot, but not uncomfortably.  While watching the sink drain the last of the suds, there are navy eyes watching Dean, he can feel them.  He barely looks up before feels the hand in the middle of his back, turning him.  His eyes fall closed, either from the heavy buzz of the alcohol or feeling the heat radiating from the hand. Dean votes the former.
Cas collapses in the chair, no longer able to hold himself up, hold himself together. “Dean,” he half sobs, hands still shaking.
Sam finds a case in upstate New York worth checking out and Dean decides it’s okay if Cas
Then Cas moans, the sound so low in the back of his throat, sounding as broken and disheveled as he looks.  He pulls hard on Dean’s hair, forcing their mouths back together.  Then Dean can feel it, the warmth of Cas’s cum as it coats his stomach, and the resulting clenching of his ass.
Dean opens his eyes and they’re back in the motel room, Cas’s hands roaming his back.
After a slow breakfast, Dean decides today he’ll finish chores around the house; his head hurting too much to focus on researching a new case. Laundry needs to be done, the kitchen needs cleaned, his room needs organized.  He can keep his mind busy this way; domestic life, he learned while at Lisa’s, can sometimes be mind numbingly dull.
“He lost a lot of blood, but we were able to get him the transfusion he needed,” she informs, then goes silent for a minute. “I’ve been working here twenty-three years and I thought I’d seen it all...but…  By some miracle, we were unable to find the source of the bleeding, as if his body healed itself from the damage.  All we needed to do before the transfusion was sew him up.  A miracle…,” she whispers to herself more than to Cas.
Dean scrubs a hand over his face.
Dean hides his face in Cas’s neck, not sure what to say.  Still, so many questions are spinning in his mind; so many points and defenses as to why he should stay human.  But he keeps his mouth shut.  In the end, this is entirely Cas’s decision, and no matter what Dean wants, it won’t change the fact that Cas has made up his mind already.
, it reads. Dean laughs as he pulls out onto the road and they’re off, headed to Nebraska.
It’s been a couple months since he came back from Heaven, with new scars carved into his grace.  The first week or so was simple enough, he’d been so exhausted and run thin that he was physically unable to think about the battle, repressing almost everything but what he let himself tell Dean.  Now though, he spends every moment awake, scared that if he succumbs to sleep he’ll have to relive the death of Hannah and the rest of his murdered brethren.
He wants to hide in a cave and never come out.
Dean gathers Cas close, cradling his head to his chest and pushing a leg between his, trying to envelop the angel, protect him.  Certainly he is trying to protect that angel from himself as well. He’s been a complete ass to Cas, especially these last six months.  The feelings of guilt and fear are still fighting against the him as he tries to push them away, but he has to keep fighting.  He thinks he might actually be able to win…
“I want— you,” he stutters outs, his voice lower than usual.  Dean almost blushes at the angel’s confession.
“So he’s your boyfriend?” Sam asks, his face as stoic as it has been.
Dean definitely does not close his eyes and stop breathing when Cas’s thumb rubs over the bruise.
.  Suddenly (after his third cup) Dean doesn’t think all mixed drinks should be counted out.  Sam doesn’t have any trouble giving over to the alcohol and ends up in a heated conversation with another customer about the best hunting knife brands.  He’s pulled away when Dean decides it time for that darts rematch; it’s surprising how good both their aims are considering the alcohol in their systems.  Dean still wins though, meaning Sam buys their fifth round.  Dean starts thinking about calling Cas once he finishes off the round and that’s when he decides it’s time for them to leave.  The brothers stumble across the street and both fall into bed fully clothed,
us there, as you say.”
(See the end of the chapter for
, punches Dean in the gut.  In the best way possible, like it’s pushing everything back into place, the way it’s meant to be.
“Then when you had to deal with coming out of Purgatory without him, how you thought you’d left him.  Dean, you thought you’d let him down entirely, and again, something inside you changed. You haven’t drunk like that since, not to the extent you were when you thought, once again, you’d lost Cas.
Cas dips his head, massaging his temples.
,” he admits.  Falling into one of the chairs surrounding the table, Dean cradles his head between his hands.  He sighs. “You can’t fucking leave me too,” he breathes.  It would’ve been too soft for Cas to hear if he were human.
He remembers back to when Zachariah threw him into that Croatoan future.  When he saw the results of Cas losing his grace for good and what he had become.  Cas had lost every ounce of self preservation, he was only making it day to day because that Dean wouldn’t let him go, wouldn’t let him succumb.  Cas was tweaked out on more drugs than Dean could probably guess, indulging in all the self destructive behaviors than even Dean had never brought himself to do.  That Cas had lost the storm in his eyes that kept Dean grounded these days.
Dean’s laying across the back seats of the Impala as Cas drives them back to the bunker.   Cas decides to listen to another one of Sam’s recordings, hoping maybe they hold the answer to the questions he doesn’t know how to ask.
“If we had two Indonesian skulls it wouldn’t be a problem, but Dean we already locked up that one, we’re on the skull from the Mayans now.” He walks over to the dresser and picks up the remote to turn the channel.
He trips over cables connecting to a stage, barely registering the sidewalk coming closer to his face.  He never hits it. Cas has his arm around his waist and slings Dean’s over his own shoulders.
“You have to tell me,” he intones, yet anger and desperation fills the car. The angel turns the music down and Dean’s startled by this almost-terroristic act.
Dean’s internal clock wakes him up at eight, which is actually seven back at the Bunker. Cas isn’t in the room but he’s not worried about it.  Sammy, on the other hand, is staring at him when he sits up. “What?” he grumbles, rubbing his face. He immediately notices Cas’s tie still in his other hand, and shoves it under the pillow.
“You know where it is, Cas,” Dean replies, it’s almost a whisper as it leaves his mouth.
AC/DC is on the radio, the air is cool as it rushes past Dean’s window, and the clouds are keeping the sun out of his eyes.  But not his thoughts about the man next to him.
Dean opens his mouth but nothing comes out, so Sam just continues.
“This way,” Cas directs, leading Dean along the back sidewalk.  He turns down another alley, walks through a store, and they exit near another stage, but this one is empty so there’s far less people around. They walk along the street for ten more minutes, a pregnant silence shared between the two.  Dean doesn’t mind it though, for some reason it’s almost comfortable.
He pushes open the door, thankful for the heated interior of the store. As he’s knocking the snow off his boots, he hears someone greet him to his left, and waves his hand in reply. Already unsure of himself for being in here, he’s not about to go asking a bunch of questions to some clerk.
“Okay, now you can pick a stain for the wood, and whether or not you want the engraving stained, colored, or left plain.” She pulls out two sheets showing the different stains and colors.
He wants so badly to hold them, push his fingers between the feathers, feel the hot-cold of the grace on his skin.  But he can’t, not right now, at least.
He can barely hear the breathy grunts as Dean struggles to keep his body working as it continues to lose blood.  Cas can’t panic, he can’t lose focus.
Dean realizes how that sounds and hurries to correct himself.
He was wrong.
Cas laughs in return, thanking him, turning the box over in his hands. Sam moves to the chair, reading the manuscript again, trying to give them as much privacy as he can while still staying in the room.
The next thing the angel knows, Dean is kneeling beside him, cupping the back of his neck as a smile stretches his face in a way Cas hasn’t seen in too long.
It’s just short of pouring rain by the they make it back out, running to the Impala and haphazardly throwing bags into the trunk, hoping they’re wedged in securely enough between the duffle bags.
“He’s not going to fucking leave,” Dean says, with a ferocity that alarms them both.
, Cas.” Dean gets up and stomps out of the room.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m comin’,” he almost slurs, pushing himself into a sitting position.  Cas reaches out a hand, ready to help Dean out of the car. “I can do this, Cas,” he says gently, “I’m not incapacitated yet.”
Sam was the one who had to transfer Cas from room to shower to room to toilet to room. Every time Dean got too close, Cas would throw himself and his obscenities (sometimes English curses slipping in between the Enochian ones) at the hunter.  He did the same to Sam, but at least the younger brother could handle the rage. Whereas Dean, would crumple under the anger even though he knew it was not personal.  So Dean sat outside the door, trying his best to protect Cas the only way he could.
The hunter has to ask, he has to make sure. “Do you seriously not remember, Cas?”
Cas find some medicine in the top drawer of the dresser, and pops a few store-brand antihistamines and decongestants into his palm and fills a cup with orange juice.  He considers seeing if Sam left any vitamin C tablets in his room, but as he’s passing the bathrooms, the humming coming from within pulls him in there instead.
There’s nothing up here.  All the rooms are untouched, no blood or guts to be seen.  Both men double-check each room to make sure, but not one thing is out of place. It doesn’t look like anyone packed in a hurry or that doors were broken down, it’s like the entire floor of tenants just disappeared.
A nurse notices. She throws the files she was holding onto an empty wheelchair and yells for a gurney. “Sir, what happened?” she asks, kneeling next to Cas, her hands coming up next to his.
Cas nods, unable to speak.
Dean hasn’t asked Cas to heal him, even though one surge of his grace through Dean’s body would mean that virus dead and gone within seconds.  A part of Cas, that seems to keep growing (has been ever since he decided to stay in the bunker), is glad that Dean is allowing Cas this small act.  Dean is letting Cas heal him in all the ways any other human would, a slow and tedious process, but it shows the depth of his affection anyways.  Cas lets Dean kiss him between coughing fits and sneezes, and if that doesn’t prove how willing he is to be here, he doesn’t know what will.  He laughs at the absurdity of his thought process, but looks over and Dean and smiles again.
RECORDING THIRTY-EIGHT
“We have to talk!” Dean yells back.  He takes Cas around the corner so it’s quiet. “Where the hell did you learn to play like that?”
“If you were to be admitted to the hospital, I have no way of proving my relation to you.” Cas tilts his head, thinking. “I have no way of proving my relation to anyone.  And the opposite is true, I suppose.  You’d have no way of proving who I am if I were to be unconscious in the ER.”
“I’ve got this, Dean.” Sam sounds like a teenage who wants to get off the phone with their parent. “It’s simple really.  If it is this witch, then I’ve got her cleaned up in no time. I’ll be back before dinner.”
Castiel so desperately wants to call Sam now, ask him how to do this.
“Dammit, I would have thought it was him, considering the connection.” He sighs. “I’m almost done here.  I’m going to head to the coroner’s office after this, she said I could stop by to grab copies of her files and go over them with her.”
Dean’s immediate reaction when Cas walks through the door is wrap him in a hug.  He can feel how stiff Cas is, his frustrations still so close to the surface.  But he won’t let go, can’t let go, terrified Cas is going to leave again.
Dean nods and starts walking to the motel.
As soon as they made it to the motel, only forty minutes later than they wanted, Dean flopped himself onto the bed and told Cas to wake him up when the Chinese food got there.
Half an hour of no speaking, of Cas soaking himself in his shame, and Dean can’t take it anymore.  He punches the stereo off again and grabs Cas’s hand, pulling it onto his thigh. This capture’s the angel’s attention instantly.
It takes them at least another two hours to sort through all the files, the sun is starting to set now and it’s definitely cooled down.
“I’ve been thinking about removing my grace since the angels called upon me to help fight Metatron,” Cas starts. “Not because I wanted no powers as an excuse to not help them, but because for the first time I did not feel the ever-binding duty to help Heaven.  Since my beginning, my one purpose was to act as a function for Heaven, to follow out orders from those above me, and eventually to direct those below me.  I was to aid Heaven in any and all ways, such as was the purpose of all angels.  Even those who have betrayed, only do so because their grace has been damaged to the point that they truly believe they are helping Heaven.
The kids confer for a minute, a couple of them turning out pockets. “Okay.” The best player of the group stands forward, laying the two hundred on the table Dean’s leaning against. “But just me and him.” He nods at Cas.
Asking the question grounds him and subdues his panicked thoughts before they start to manifest. He thinks he knows the answer but he wants to know for sure.
for breakfast?” Dean scoffs at the selection, eyeing what looks like an apple turnover.
It’s been pretty quiet between them, even considering how much of that time Dean has spent in and out of consciousness.  Every time Cas went to open his mouth in the motel room, an apology was ready to spring forth; Dean didn’t want to hear it, so he would press his mouth the Cas’s.  Neither one of them really knew what was the right thing to say in this situation.
Dean leans back, sitting on his haunches to reach for a pillow and hand it to Cas. “Hold that, I’ll be right back.” The angel clutches the pillow to his chest as he settles on his stomach.  Dean kisses the dip of Cas’s lower back before he stands up.
And all of the sudden in slots into place for Cas.  He can’t tell that to Dean yet because even if it feels right he needs to understand it better before he can even begin to explain it to Dean.
“Can you just mail it to me?  My brother and I are leaving now, we were just in Denver for business.” Sam’s gone back over to the books, catching on that Dean didn’t want to talk right now.
Dean’s not sure what makes him do it, but once he spots the stationary shop on the corner, he’s getting out and walking towards it.
“Well, actually, no one is convinced of that, except me,” she assures hurriedly.  I have asked the others to vote whether or not they think you’re able to lead once they hear what you say.” She turns to face Castiel directly now, she touches his shoulder briefly. “Please, Castiel, say you will help us.  Say you direct us in ending Metatron once and for all.”
“You don’t owe them a damn thing, Cas!” Dean affirms for the fifth time in as many minutes. “Not a damn thing!
He walks in between the tables and shelves laden with books and papers and funny little contraptions he couldn’t begin to figure the use for.  There’s an entire section of wall dedicated just to pens, and out of utter shock Dean stops in front of it.
●	Every other chapter switches POV between Dean and Cas (I might throw in a Sam chapter or two)
He’s been trying for so long to deal with this himself, to not burden Dean with the worry of his own mental health.
“How do you think you look when you do it?”
I'm really bad at writing in chronological order.  Because right now, I'm writing both of Dean's next two chapters simulaneously, and have barely put an outline of a thought together for Cas's next chapter.  So, that's another reason these aren't updated on a regular basis.
. “I mean, have you ever been in his room? He’s got like three books on his desk that he took from the library.  Only one of his dresser drawers has extra clothes— not that he needs them. His walls are completely bare.”
Sorry this took so long!  I started working at this firm in Austin and now I have a bunch of time to write again!  Yay~  Anywho, this hasn't been beta'd yet, so it's not perfect, but I will repost it once it is beta'd.  Enjoy!
The panic settles itself comfortably in Dean’s chest, relaxing more and more the longer he doesn’t say anything.
“Cas, man, you were a mess— a fucking mess.  There were sigils and wards and god knows what else carved into the walls— or drawn on with you blood. Dozens of bowls littered the hallways, each full of different concoctions for spells and summonings and, and, and— Cas, you don’t remember any of this?” Dean asks, desperate for Cas to speak.
rings in his ears, stomach continuing to gurgle.
.” That’s all it takes.
Dean tries to stay calm as his entire body ignites.  He is entirely consumed. Between his legs, his dick throbs so much it aches as he lets Cas set the pace.  He has to lean his forehead between Cas’s shoulder blades and close his eyes, so he doesn’t completely lose it right now.
“Fuck, Cas— I need— need to get
“Where the hell did I get this bug from?” he complains, his voice scratching its way out.
The feather is still glowing when he looks back down at it.
“Cas,” Dean yells excitedly across the room, “we got a game.  C’mere, man.”
The case was pretty open and close, the men were able to gather enough information from the locals and talk to the mother of the suspected “miracle maker.” After they located the bones, they found a clearing in the woods to salt and burn them.  Dean suggested the bar down the street from the motel so they could both unwind, and Dean could perhaps pretend he was
If Cas doesn’t want to be an angel, there’s so much more to it than just becoming human.
The brothers find out, once they have the reaper in a trap, that a gang of demons controlled him. Working to build an army of souls, these demons planned to rebel against Crowley and rule Hell themselves. “Yeah, right,” Dean mutters at the nonsense, “as if that would actually happen.”
The words sound harder for Dean to admit than he thought they would. “You would expect certain things of me…or things between us would change.  And now look at me!  I’m here whining because I don’t want you to do your fucking job.”
The overwhelming feeling of
“I was just...,” Dean clears his throat and tries again, “I was looking at this one.” He points to the customizable one.
“Nah, Cas, you just gotta come give me my medicine.” Dean winks suggestively then heads towards the bathrooms.
God, Dean
Cas blinks fast, his hands stopping where they are clutched in Dean’s hair. “I want to see your face.”  Dean almost laughs; Cas’s eyes have been squeezed shut for how much of this?
“I can’t do anything right now.” He hangs his head after Castiel takes another long drink from the bottle between his palms.  The angel looks up, and there it is— that look of pity he’d been dreading.
Cas tilts his head. “What game?”
Dean admits, to himself it feels like the first time.
More handwritten notes detail the making of some of the journals.  All the leathers used, the stone or wood insets, the meaning of the embroidered symbols. He looks over a couple different shelves, but comes back to the first one he walked up to.  He hesitates picking up the dark leather journal with the silver stitching on the spine.
Castiel’s heart starts racing, and he’s suddenly scared. “Where is it?” he finally chokes out, feeling the tug of his grace,
Dean pulls his hand away, grabs his cock, and presses it firmly against Cas.
Dean takes a deep breath.  He’s trying to accept this.
The little bell above the door signals another customer enter, Paige greets them as well.
●	The Sam possessed by Gadreel subplot is also thrown out the window (definitely not for the same reasons)
He sits quietly, still thinking about the feather, pressing his knee solidly against Cas’s, trying to think of something to say.  Nothing seems right, no words mean enough. Spending Christmas with Cas and Sam, no apocalypse looming over their heads, is more than Dean could have wished for.
he refuse that strangled plea dripping from Cas’s raw throat?
Cas’s fingers flex and Dean thinks he should clarify.
…,”Cas all but shouts when Dean finds his rhythm, grinding his hips in circles so his cock repeatedly catches on Cas’s.
Dean’s body tenses.
Dean’s pocket rings.
“I figured,” Sam says, picking the letter opener back up. “Who for, Charlie?”
“He’s was...he was stabbed.” As sharp as Cas’s mind is, he can’t help but give into the fuzziness that is pressing in on his memory.  The nurse pushes Cas’s hands out of the way so that she can assess the damage. “He needs a blood transfusion,” he states obviously.
fit he
At that final realization, everything comes to a head, and Dean feels it in his hands before anything else.  The way they cramp up and his wrists twist, then his toes curl, then his legs thrash, and suddenly everything is too hot to touch.  Cas is too hot to touch.  He cums, gasping as his hands burn into the angel’s hips and his lips burn across Cas’s mouth.
“I’m going to go make dinner,” he says, pushing himself off the bed. “I’ll let you know when I’m done.” He closes the door as he leaves.
“Dean?”
?” He sounds thoroughly confused.
From then on, if Castiel is in the library or a storage room or wherever, Dean will walk up behind him.  He’ll kiss his shoulder or squeeze his neck briefly, and Castiel knows.  It isn’t an often occurrence but it certainly isn’t rare either, so Castiel goes with it.  Every time, he tells himself he’ll finally sum up the courage to mention Sam to Dean, some adrenaline high taking over.  But when the time comes, when Dean is spread on top of him on the floor or when they are tracing patterns on each other’s arms next to each other bed, Castiel can’t find his voice.
He has already lost Cas more times that he’s willing to think about. How many nights did he drink himself to sleep trying to drown out the loss then?  And that was before any of
. “Oh, yeah, and what are all these?” he asks, drinking half his beer in one swallow.
Cas doesn’t want to ask why Dean doesn’t question why, in what situation, Cas would not be able to heal himself or the hunter.  He likes the comfortable pressure in his chest that tells him Dean would want to be the one in the hospital next to him if either were incapacitated.
” Cas huffs, pushing himself up against Dean’s chest.
“Be careful—” Dean burps, and stumbles in the process, “— or next time I’ll make sure you’re the drunk one.”
Sorry this took so long to post (and I'm 3 days past my self-induced deadline) but here is the next chapter.
Dean catches his bag too, trying not to think of Cas’s tie in it or that his shirt has one more button open than usual. “Dude, how were we supposed to know if something went wrong?”
“He went to check the rest of the crime scenes.  He said it’d be faster if he did it his way, since he won’t have to navigate the crowds.”
Cas looks at his hand, watches as the blood drips off and pools on the ground next to him.
Dean’s voice is raw when he speaks. “You wanna clean up?”
She goes on to ask a flurry of questions about Dean’s health and habits, making sure nothing interferes at they try to save him.  Alison, she tells him, guides him to the waiting room.  She pushes a clipboard into his hands and tells him to start filling out what information he can while they wait for an update.  Then she leaves him, promising to come check in later when she has new information.
And before Cas even realizes what might result because of that, Dean is already moving off of him.  Dean sits up and throws his legs over the side of the bed so he can pull his jeans back on.  Castiel sits up, leaning back on his elbows, experiencing thorough emotional whiplash.
He loved her, undoubtedly.  Her and Ben were two of the greatest things to ever happen to him, he would never be able to deny that.  She knew who he was, she saw him for who he truly was, and loved him anyways.  Dean couldn’t let that go.  He couldn’t not try to give her everything she had given him. He let himself feel, for the first time in a long time, when he fell apart in her arms every night for the first few weeks.  He let her see how vulnerable and absolutely broken he was.  Sure, she would never be able to bring Sam back or empathize with Dean, but she was compassionate and determined to take care of him.
Cas tries and fails to give a smile. “Dean, I should have—”
Dean wakes up early, Cas’s lips demanding as they make out, before Dean insists on getting up to make breakfast.
Dean’s hands twitch where they lay on his stomach.  There’s too many questions running rabid in his mind to talk.
He looks over the crowd, trying to find their way out, but there’s another stage set up in front of a restaurant a block the other way, and the crowd of people already seems to have grown denser in the time it’s taken to scan it. “I’m going to go ask for directions,”  Sam shouts over the noise as he fights his way through the crowd, looking out of place in a suit.
Update 12/26/15: I am really pushing to get the next chapter posted before the end of the year, so send good vibes my way, please.  Hopefully some magic will happen
“You don’t want any of it…,” Dean says slowly. “You don’t want to have any more powers?”
You can’t do the same shit anymore, Cas!”
Dean’s eyes are still closed, but even if they were open, Cas wouldn’t notice because his eyes are trained on the spot on Dean’s chest that is stuttering up and down as he continues to breathe.
“I have a confession.” Cas is still sitting at the table, suddenly interested in the pattern on the paper cup.
His phone chimes with another weather report from the town they’re headed for and he thumbs it off. “I could go on the supply run while you get stuff packed here,” he suggests, turning to face Dean as he reads the report.
Cas isn’t predictable though.
“Alright, lets go see what Sam has found.” Dean takes the quickest route possible out of the building, relishing in the fresh but humid air outside.
“There is a total of seventeen different human’s bodily remains found at the various crime scenes.  One of the detectives said at least thirty-nine different people have been confirmed missing, with another eleven possibly missing.  Nine total, but deceased, bodies accounted for.” He riddles off these facts with minimal emotion, his face just as monotonous as his voice.
Sam snorts in reply, not dignifying that with a response.
.  The thought echos in Dean’s mind for as long as he keeps staring at Cas.  He knows it’s true, even if he never thought he’d get to this point in his life.
“You said before coming that there were zombies though.”
Dean wants to give him time to think, so he pulls back, but before he can let go, Cas pulls his hands closer.
“None. I used the last of Domiel’s to get myself here.”
Dean has only ever known life on the road.  Going to shoddy bars, and the occasional club when he was younger, sated his needs as well as he thought his needs could be sated.  Being young and curious was something he figured was normal, he’d known other kids to experiment when he got the chance to befriend some for long enough.  He just thought maybe he hadn’t gotten it out of his system yet.  Small town bars and college clubs weren’t exactly the best places to test the waters.
Dean laughs. “Shit, Cas.” He smiles at Cas, relief evident in his eyes. “We can call Charlie up ASAP and get you some ID and a social and all that.  She’ll make sure that we’d be each other’s next of kin and all that, don’t worry,” he reassures, pulling into the Walmart parking lot.
“Cas, dude, what the hell happened to you?” he forces out of his clenched jaw, angry that he’s injured and didn’t tell him, didn’t try to mend himself even.
He’s been present at the birth of hundreds of stars and seen his fair share of star’s lives end as well.  Entire ecosystems and civilizations have come in and out of existence under his watch.  He has explored ancient planets, with all traces of life long forgotten from its surface, he’s been to planets that are still shaking out the creases in their surface they’re so new, and he’s been with Earth since the dawn of its time, millenias ago.  He’s fought otherworldly wars— hell, he has won those wars.  He has rebelled against angels, Heaven, and God himself even.  Yet this one human seems to be too much for Castiel to handle.
That didn’t stop him from fighting back every now and again as he was learning though.
Avoiding thinking about last night gets harder and harder the busier Dean tries to make himself.
He looks over to see a pair of hands with long fingers drying off the dishes. Following the line of his arm, Dean finds Cas’s dark eyes staring into his intently.
He takes a deep breath to gather himself, about to speak.
with Cas that he didn’t realize Cas was still pressing back.  He looks down again, his dick now buried to the hilt inside of Cas.  Dean loses it at that.  He pulls himself closer to Cas, his lips attached to his neck as he sucks a bruise there. He trails his hand from the angel’s shoulder, down his side, across his stomach, and grabs his cock. Cas all but shouts, the gasp falling from his mouth sounds painful.  He thrusts forward into Dean’s hand, pulling at Dean’s cock in him. Dean has to bite down on Cas’s neck to stop himself from screaming from the pull on his cock. Cas gasps again, pushing back into Dean now.
How long had it been since the world fell like it was falling apart?  Sam left because, for the first time in years, there wasn’t an apocalypse of some sort looming over their heads.  There is no rational reason that Cas should feel the fear her feels, not with such a quiet world ahead of them.
“Why are you so opposed to doing things the angel way?” Cas asks over his shoulder, startling Dean, who almost hits his head on the hood.
“Alright, so I have that recipe for the
Trying to avoid an argument, trying to avoid feeling any overly strong emotions towards Cas, Dean gives in, “Fine, I will try your means of spontaneous travel without a fight.” He shuts the trunk and walks back inside before Cas has a chance at responding.
He shakes his head, trying to clear it, but it only disorients him more. His hips stutter to a stop moments later.  He groans one final time. Grabbing Cas’s cheeks, he forces his tongue in his mouth, slow and filthy, trying to convey god knows what emotions he’s feeling right now.
He needs to staunch the bleeding, he needs to heal the cuts slashed deep into Dean’s body.
Dean didn’t know he was still able to feel fear like this, after everything he’s been through. Some sick part of him actually enjoys it, reminds him he is still human, after all.
At least Cas is out of the windowed room now and the hunter can seclude himself again. Sometimes it looks like Cas is about to follow him into the room but he takes a turn down another hallway right before he opens the door.  And then Dean is alone.
“I do not know if I am what you are looking for.” Castiel turns slowly, gauging whether he is able to leave or not.
Cas snaps his laptop shut. “Dean.”
Dean stops himself.
Dean wants to chuck his phone across the room; to have control over something as simple as talking or not would be nice. “Just a fucking fight, Sam.  Shit happens.”
It hits Dean all at once, like a fucking brick wall.  Everything he’s been not thinking about and refusing to let himself feel for the past months (let's be honest, years) comes bursting to the surface.
It’s been sitting in the fridge for thirty minutes as Cas listens to Dean’s snoring and coughing, his cold unrelenting.
Dean tries to continue researching the case, but Cas’s plate from lunch sits on the table distracting him.  After thirty minutes, no longer able to focus at all, he heads to shower.
A thread of worry, that Cas knows to be self-consciousness, laces Dean’s thought.
does he want to, he wants every bit of it he can get his hands on.  He wants to wrap himself in it so completely that it all becomes the defining whole of him.
They’re about half way to Lincoln when Dean has finished wrestling with himself. “Hey, Cas.”
The angel knows he should be angrier with Dean, furious that he is being used as some placeholder during his emotional turmoil.  But, taking one out of the Winchesters’ book, he ignores the obvious.  Meaning he lets himself be happy with the fact that Dean is even still willing to continue whatever it is between them.
“You good?” he murmurs, dripping some of the oil on his fingers and placing the bottle near Cas’s hip.  Cas makes an affirmative sound, pushing his ass back just a little bit. “Here, put the pillow under your hips,” Dean says, helping Cas do so. “And don’t fucking move.” Cas snorts.
.  He stares back, hoping to find the words he needs.
“We’re in New Orleans and you get drunk at a jazz festival, how predictable,” he scoffs, buttoning his shirt.
Their lips are connected again, the kiss languorous as both men smile into it.
Dean wants to— he’s not sure— comfort Cas, wrap him up until he feels better, until everything is alright.  But nothing is ever going to be alright and Dean is the one upsetting Cas.
, Dean thinks as his right hand reaches between their torsos.
“Cas, if this is about penance or whatever, trust me, you’ve made up for your wrongdoings.  How many times did you save the fucking world?  Man, you’ve saved it like fifty times by this point.  Way more than anyone else.”  Dean’s trying to find any reason for this not to be true.
He hears the door open and turns around to leave, return to the game.
, Dean thinks,
“Okay, so,” Dean says, the two still leaning over the table, faces a scant six inches from each other, “you’ve been hitting the balls pretty spot on and all, act as if you were actually drunk.”
“I want to know how long...how long you’ve been— when you realized.” Cas scrubs his hands over his face. “I don’t know what I’m trying to say.  Never mind.” He collapses onto his bed.
The angel’s eyes break from Dean’s as he glances down at the table. “To be completely honest, I’ve been thinking about it for a while now…”
“Man, don’t get all sappy on me now.” Dean laughs, nudging Sam with his shoulder.
Dean’s eyes are shut, either trying to fall asleep or trying to stay in his bubble of “don’t acknowledge this and it will be okay;” he isn’t sure. All he knows for sure is that whenever Cas has blinked the past half hour, he marvels at the angel’s eyelashes against his shoulder.  It makes everything real but not feel like a part of reality.  He can’t really explain it…
— he can’t make Dean see the double standard.
Cas doesn’t get up as quickly as Dean does, so he’s the one heading to the kitchen for their drinks.
“Please, Castiel…,” Dean murmurs into the space between their lips, his voice quavering.
“The other angels,” he breathes, sounding as if he woke up, but Dean knows he didn’t sleep. “I went higher in heaven, looking for angels who might have knowledge of how to translate
He pulls out his phone, Sam’s number lighting the screen. “What’s up, Sammy?” he asks, instantly noticing his voice is an octave higher than usual.
Dean lets out the breath he didn’t realize he was holding. “Yeah, Cas, we can talk about starting that.”
“Dean?” Sam repeats, his voice soft even in the silence of the Impala.
Dean’s knees hit the tile hard.  He holds his breath against the renewed panic swelling in his chest, not allowing it to escape.  He’s stronger than this.  He can’t fall apart because of this, nothing has even happened yet.  He’s freaking out at the mere mention of Cas giving up his grace; over Cas disappearing in his anger.  What will it be like if it actually happens?  His knuckles sting from hitting the wall so many times, over and over, only stopping just as the blood starts to spill.
Cas muffles his laugh in Dean’s shoulder. “I think I clearly want to watch a movie,” he laughs again, pressing his hips to Dean’s.
“But what about surgery?”
When they first arrived, Cas hacked his way into the local police station’s server and started researching about the missing people that originally drew them to this case.  They all disappeared from within the same few blocks of each other, in a part of town that was less than pleasant but never had any true trouble.  Until people started to spread rumors about a supposed serial killer that has taken these victims.
“Hmm,” Sam hums, holding his hands up to the vents again.
“Cas,” he states, so plainly and so quietly but with such conviction he can hear the angel stop moving. He still hasn’t sat up to face him.
Cas comes out of the room, bag in hand, face as strong as ever.  The front seat receives a rush of warm morning air as he slides into his seat next to Dean.  He doesn’t know what else to do. “Cas, fix this,” Dean mutters, not meeting Cas’s eyes as he pulls at the collar of his shirt.
Dean laughs. “You don’t know the second thing about slow traveling, man.” Dean thinks of when Sammy was four and wanted a piggy back ride down the street to the corner store.  He kept asking Dean to stop so they could look at everything.  It took an hour. “You’ve always been popping in and out.”
he looked.  He began to, not exactly embrace, but definitely not push away or ignore what was steadily growing between them.
“What crawled up your ass and died?” Sam mumbles around another yawn as Dean hurries back to Cas’s room.
“Dirty fucking witches,” Dean mutters.
see him.
Dean wants to look Cas in the eye but he can’t seem to take his eyes off the road. He coughs. “That’s part of it, yeah.”
“Holy shit. Are they sure?” the older Winchester asks, sitting forward.
“I wanted to get Charlie’s Christmas present while we were somewhere that might actually have it.”
This gift from Sam seems like something he would give to Cas if he knew how he felt.  But how can that be when Cas didn’t even come to this realization until after Sam had given him these recordings?
“You ready to go?” Dean wipes his mouth.
One day Castiel would have to answer to Heaven, he always knew it.  He just doesn’t expect it to be so soon.
Dean shakes his head and thanks her, closing the journal. As he picks up the burger, Sam’s still reading the article. Knocking on the newspaper like a door, it crumbles a bit under his force and Sam’s face appears. “Dude, we already know it’s a reaper, you don’t have to read anymore.”
Dean ends up choosing a dark stain for the wood and leaving the engraving untouched. He draws out the Enochian for Cas’s name, slow and precise so they don’t fuck it up, and then writes
Then it the physical aspect.  He already knew how to fight in hand-to-hand combat, albeit, his style was definitely more influenced by his confidence as angel rather than skill alone.  But, Dean taught him human hand-to-hand combat anyways.  Then he would set up a shooting range outside, and Castiel would practice shooting with handguns and shotguns, learning how to offset the kickback properly.
Cas’s thumb hovers over the last recording; but he’s unsure why he’s hesitating.
Then he notices the centerpiece of the bloody Pollock scene, an alligator carcass spread on a table.
,” he whispers, his voice raspy with desperation.
“He’s going to be okay.”
Dean hums along to the radio station for now, as they’re leaving Lebanon, in between his comments about how they need to be quick and methodical about this supply run if they’re going to make it in and out before the storm hits.
repeats in Dean’s head as his throat burns.
“What’s so humorous?”
Dean sits up properly. “I just get another bottle,” he sighs, trying to pass it off as a joke.
.  He’ll convince Cas to keep his grace, he will.  It only makes sense for Cas to stay an angel.  He can’t have a rational desire to be human.  No one would willingly choose the life that Dean lives.
The brothers work a couple more cases together (they even manage to make it to a Van Halen concert in Texas one weekend) before Cas finds a pair of cases, luckily both in Maine.  On the way back from the case— werewolf packs wreaking havoc— Sam asks if Dean wants to drive through Canada.  They end up in Toronto for a couple nights, spending an afternoon as generic tourists at Niagara Falls. They hit up a local concert; Sam bribes Dean into trying poutine— and later Dean ends up ordering another two plates. They even stand on the lakeshore for a while but not going in (it’s too cold and they want their first time at the beach to be a real beach, none of this lake crap).  Cas hadn’t joined them originally but he shows up at their motel room while they’re bickering about whether to see a hockey game or not because Sam would rather go to the museum.  Eventually, Cas ends up accompanying Dean to the hockey game while Sam goes to the museum.  After the game, Cas and Dean forgo food until Sam comes back and end up at the hotel soon after.  Before Dean knows it, he’s pressed against the back of the door and Cas is down on his knees. The hunter slides down the door when his knees give out after he cums; he pulls Cas into his lap, vigorously repaying the favor with hand and mouth.  Sam comes back later to find them both sitting on the closer bed watching Dr. Sexy.
