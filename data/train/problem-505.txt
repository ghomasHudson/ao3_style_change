An erection. His eyes flew open and he raised his head and lifted the sheet and stared at the outline of his penis, straining against the cotton of his pajama bottoms. He fell back against the pillow and looked at the ceiling, thinking.
“Yes, sir.” He laid the tray on the nightstand and arranged the pillows behind John’s back.
She shook her head. “Give the man a break. He’s had a rough few days.”
Sherlock didn’t know what to say. He didn’t know how to do this part. It wasn’t that he’d never had lovers in his long life. In fact, in his 50s, he had conducted an exhilarating month-long experiment in Barcelona . . . it was just that most never stayed. He preferred they slip away, lost in the darkness.
“I’m not sure what you mean.”
“You still haven’t told me the weird part.”
He handed the pictures back to her. “Well done, Inspector.”
“You’ve been tracking my wife this whole time?”
“He’s got you answering his phone now? Cheeky bastard. Put me on speaker, I don’t plan on repeating any of this.”
He felt a hand on his chest.
“Sod off. I can write my own bloody speech.”
*****
“I’m not that drunk.” John muttered. He tugged his jumper over his head and let it drop to the floor. Stepped out of his trousers. “And don’t act like this is all part of your grand plan, eh?” He slid into bed beside Sherlock. “I had a wife and baby five minutes ago.”
He slid a finger under the first one and opened it. Standard police report. Picture paper clipped to the upper corner. Victim. Young. Pretty. He hadn’t heard Sherlock talk about taking on any new cases. Then he noticed the maple leaf stamped in one corner, the RCMP insignia in the other.
But since that day, the one he could only think of as
Sherlock and Kate answered at the same time. “No.”
“Bollocks,” John says from the back seat. “Don’t act like you’re not thrilled to miss Christmas dinner with Mycroft. I’ve done you a favour.”
He trusted his father to tell the truth. He waited until after tea on Saturday to ask him.
She could see Mycroft shake his head. “Sherlock’s obsession with Charles Magnussen must be contained. Whatever incriminating information Magnussen might have about Mary –”
It was her turn not to answer.
Years ago, he wanted to say.
Kate decided to take her silence as a yes.
John was confused. “Uh, Kate, what’s wrong?”
He’d slept for almost four hours. In Sherlock’s bed. Not that Sherlock had noticed.
Sherlock threw himself into a chair. He rubbed his hands on his knees. “It will work.”
“Sherlock doesn’t miss things.”
He’s still sleeping, torqued into some improbable shape, like a body washed up on the shore, one arm thrown up over his eyes to block out the morning sun. He hasn’t moved in more than an hour.
“My fault, I suppose,” John says.
.” She pulled at her shirt self-consciously, closing the gap caused by the missing button. “Of course no one listens to me,” she added bitterly.
“If you say purview I might throw this glass at you.”
They’d finished their toast (burnt) and eggs (John had never seen scrambled eggs that colour) and bacon (perfect) and traded sections of the newspaper back and forth until Sherlock finally said what he’d been waiting to say all morning. Or at least that was John’s take on it.
“My girlfriend. Well, ex-girlfriend. Well, I’m not sure. We broke up before I came here. I think.” Kate couldn’t stop talking. Mrs. Hudson had sat back down and was nodding.
They headed back to Barts. John needed more anti-nausea medicine. Molly needed to identify what killed Bellamy. They all needed to feel like they were getting somewhere. Presumably Sherlock needed something too, but he wasn’t talking. Lestrade’s team had found no new possibilities and the last conversation with Mycroft was not what either of them wanted to hear. No chatter. No leads.
“I passed it around upstairs, and it generated some interest. The feeling is that even if it’s a bit of a fishing expedition, it’s worth looking into. No statute of limitations on these sorts of things.”
“Yes.” He looked around, people were starting to stare. He couldn’t do this to his sister. “No. Let’s go inside.” He looked back at Lauren and Harry.
“Sure there is. The fact you don’t know the answer only proves my point.”
He turns and leans against the sink, legs crossed. I stand in front of him.
“Yours? Really? I can use yours? This is dire indeed.”
“Progress, I hope.” Sherlock went to the door and John got up and went to the window.
“For Christ’s sake, Sherlock.  Your big genius brain didn’t think I might need my bloody trousers?”
(the name was redacted)
The light was still on when the cab pulled up. John climbed the stairs slowly, one hand against the wall to steady himself. The result of the whiskey or what he’d read, he wasn’t sure.
Sherlock opened the bedroom door as John was reaching for the knob.
“Who wants John dead?”
He reached out and wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s wrist. “Okay,” he said and heard Sherlock exhale. John counted out Sherlock’s pulse, steady and strong, and thought that if this was all the happiness he was ever allowed, sitting next to Sherlock, holding onto his wrist, then it would be enough.
“You said it was important,” she said in an accent she must have picked up from
John blushed. “Of course I wanted you to. That’s not the point.” He pulled his hand away, scrubbed his face. Blew out a breath.
His sympathy was fading under Sherlock’s refusal to admit he’d made a colossal mistake. “I can and I have. I am sorry.”
John grabbed the newspaper from Sherlock and tossed it to the floor. He leaned over, palms pressed flat against the table and hissed, “What are you playing at, Sherlock?”
John shot Sherlock a warning glance.
“I simply helped Lestrade distinguish his arse from his elbow. Several people were subsequently arrested, Sumeet’s father among them.”
“Apparently. I’m supposed to see her parents tomorrow. Meet my daughter. Until today, I wasn’t sure what I was going to do. But they seem happy the baby’s going to be with her father . . . with me.” John looked at Sherlock. “With us.”
“How long did I suspect?”
She yawned. Something didn’t make sense but she was too tired to try and work it out. She switched off the phone, leaned back and closed her eyes while “Don’t Get Me Wrong” played in her head.
John rubbed his palms against his trousers. “I mean it, Sherlock. I want . . . I need . . . we have to take her home.” He paused, and then added in case there was any doubt, “to Baker Street.”
Six months turned into twelve turned into eighteen. Each time he thought he was approaching the finish line, Mycroft moved it further out of reach. “New evidence,” he would say and Sherlock once again found himself on a plane to a new cover, new city, new country.
“Greg? It’s John.”
Sherlock turns to face me. He still does that, force of habit, I imagine. His hair is longer now and the scars around his eyes have faded. “I don’t know what it is,” he says. “It’s happened a few times, but I dismissed it.” He takes a breath like he doesn’t want to tell me the rest of it.  “Sometimes I think see the outlines of people too. But you would’ve told me if there was anyone else around.”
“It’s Jim. Jim from IT . . .” he began in a voice she didn’t recognize, but was stopped by a coughing fit that became progressively more violent. John circled behind Sherlock’s chair and leaned over him, one hand supporting his chest while the other rubbed circles on his back.
Sherlock stood and busied himself with tucking his shirt back in. He recognised the warning signs of a full blown anxiety attack. “Excellent idea. You go think. I need to do the washing up.”
He smoothed out the bag and read through the plastic.
John was impatient. “I’m an atheist. You’d be wasting your time.”
, John learned that it was the small things he missed most—over and over. The adrenalin rush of a new case, dark curls against a turned-up collar, a cashmere scarf dropped carelessly on the table by the door– the memories held him back, stopped him in his tracks every time he started believing that he really could begin to start over.
After a minute I can hear his low moan become more frantic and he arches his back and freezes as he yanks his cock out of my mouth and rolls to the left, coming in waves on his silk robe. I reach down and join him, three good strokes and I am over the edge again, ramming my head into his chest until the chair almost tips.
Greg scrubbed his eyebrows. This was ridiculous. “Molly, can you give me something I can actually work with?”
“Up ahead on your right. It’s a Starbucks – it’s missing its windows but nothing else.”
“Sherlock, not now,” John said. “Kate, what is it?”
“No. Not this time. I’m sick of everyone explaining why they had to lie to me.” He grabbed his coat from the hook by the door. “I can’t stay here,” John said without looking at him.
“Not high. Hungry.” He stood and stretched. “I’ll be back in a minute. He tossed John his phone. “Call Ajit Palace. I want the lamb vindaloo. Extra spicy. Extra naan.”
John snorted. “When has that ever stopped you?”
Of course it could.
I look around again. “I don’t know. Free parking forever.”
Kate walked a step into the room just as John snapped, snatching a handful of Mycroft’s well-pressed shirt and throwing him hard against the wall. He wrapped a hand around Mycroft’s throat and squeezed. “I told you, don’t talk about my wife.”
“Yeah?” he answered.
She threw up her hands. “God, how does he stand it?” She realized that Sherlock had gone very quiet. “Sherlock?”
She let the phone fall into her lap. She looked up at Sherlock, wound tightly in wires and tubes. She knew that if she had figured it out after twenty minutes, there was no way he hadn’t.
“Good.” Her features softened, and her hand went to her hair, smoothing it. “Listen to me, going on about things I’m sure I know nothing about. I best be off.”
Sherlock had miscalculated. He knew that now. He’d factored every variable into the equation – Moriarty’s threats, his criminal network (known and unknown), his own genius and ruined reputation, the safety of John, Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade, Mycroft’s access to information – and always came up with the same conclusion. Being dead was the only way out. It was also the only way in. It served everyone’s purposes.
“I beg your pardon.”
“And now?”
“Your wallet is on the dresser in my room,” Sherlock said to John. “It contains two twenties and one ten pound note – give it to her.”
“Stop thinking.” Sherlock sighed and pulled the sheet off his chest. “I need a shot.”
“I promise.”
She held up the bag. “Mrs. Hudson says the tea is coming.”
“She was smuggling stolen art across the US-Canada border. Her contact would pass a canvas to her in New York and she would simply carry it across the border mixed in with her own work. She was young and attractive and no one paid attention.  She was paid $5,000 for each delivery – a pittance compared to how much the paintings later sold for. Someone else would pick them up from her in Ottawa. She died before she was able to drop off the last one.”
“No. Look, no matter how pissed you are at him, at me, at Mary, you can’t go off like this. Are you trying to get me killed?” Melodramatic, she knew, but not totally farfetched. Sherlock had the scars to prove it.
I raise one eyebrow and he changes the subject.
Sherlock put both hands on John’s knees and leaned forward until his mouth was against John’s ear. “When this is over, you can dream up all kinds of pedestrian ways to punish me for any slight you may feel during this investigation, and I mean all kinds of ways . . .”
There are a lot of things I miss about our old life. Takeaway. Telly. Toast. And that’s just the Ts.  Don’t get me started on coffee.
There were a hundred things John wanted to say, things like
As he turns, Greg reaches out and pulls him back by his sleeve. “He loved you, you know. That was never a lie.”
Apparently the man never answered a question. “Her name was not always Mary Morstan. Since there had never been a reason to us to meet, we – I – did not make the connection until it was too late.”
Greg pulled his phone from his pocket, tapped on the screen to show her a text. “I got this during dinner.”
Jesus, one night with John and he was a bloody schoolgirl.
“Good morning, John.” Sherlock murmured into John’s ear ten minutes later. His legs were stretched across John and his fingers were laced through John’s hair.
Sherlock nodded slowly and let John lead him back to bed. He stopped, and John thought he’d changed his mind.
His hands shook as he carefully slid the envelope into the inside pocket of his coat.
But now John was gone. He sat up and for half a second hope surged through him, his eyes flying to the bathroom, begging silently for the light to be on, for the sound of running water, for John to emerge, and smile at him, crawl back into bed, and chase the cold away. But all he heard were birds, the creak from the bathroom pipes and the soft whistle of Graham’s snoring. He was back. To the future. Nothing looked changed in his room. The same furniture, the same cardigans, the same picture of the shore in Devon.
“And wife number two?” People only referred to their ex-wife as their first wife if she were followed soon after by a second. “How did you propose?”
“Course not.”
“Deleted.”
“It’s not what I know exactly – it’s more like what we saw . . . seen.” She picked up her phone, swiped the screen and held it in front of Sherlock.
Sherlock staggered back a step, but recovered quickly. He rubbed a hand along his jaw. “That bloody hurt, John. Not quite the welcome home I expected.”
Sometimes John is shocked by how far they’ve come. There were many days, weeks, even months, when he never thought they’d get through it. After Moriarty returned and everything that happened after . . .  Sherlock had been like the walking wounded, trying to find the place where he could finally understand what followed wasn’t his fault.
“What . . . who . . .” Sherlock sat up and tried to stand.
The door wasn’t locked and they let themselves in.
“Bugger off.” He turned and walked down the block toward the house. His mistake was looking back. Mycroft stood, umbrella hooked on his arm, staring at him, infuriating smile still plastered on his face. Mycroft shrugged and turned and walked back toward the car and John wanted to laugh because it felt so good to finally –
“Sorry, sir?”
“Yes, as it turns out. We didn’t believe her at first . . . but this proves it.” John handed Kate the envelope with the DNA test.
“Washburn said she’s on holiday in Portugal,” I point out. Nothing gets by me.
“We’ve stayed this long,” he whispered. “At least wait until the end.”
“I only meant . . .” He shook his head. “Your hand? Is it –” He stepped towards John, hands raised.
John scowled. “You’re like Sherlock 2.0. Like the old you, only more, I don’t know, human . . . You swear you’re not high?”
. Such an old-fashioned word out of such a young mouth. “Sherlock is dead.”  The word had jagged edges that ripped his heart.
“So this has nothing to with John and Sherlock?”
“Iraq.  Two tours in Basra.”
Sherlock’s not nearly as clever as he believes.
see the world, you see crime and murder and intricate machinations that only need to be deduced to be solved. But sometimes what you don’t see is under all those machinations are the motives. And under those motives are the true motives. Love or hate. Usually both.”
“His flat’s about forty minutes from here in decent traffic, but I’m afraid there’s been a change of plans. He can’t see you today.”
“You can’t undo what’s done.”
Sherlock bent down and kissed him. John reached up and pulled Sherlock closer, letting every remaining bit of doubt wash away in the heat of this moment, and it was about as close to perfect as either one of them was ever going to get.
“I’d like to know the answer to that question.” The voice startled them both. John stood in the doorway, half in, half out.
“John.”
“Never left.”
John peeked over the bed at the spilled jar, the liquid turning the wood floor an interesting green colour.
“Yes.”
John rolled his eyes and Sherlock was certain it was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. And he’d seen it before. Thousands of times. Thousands of situations. But not lately. Lately John preferred the old man
“Obviously.”
“Mycroft Holmes can take care of himself.” Greg leaned forward. “Listen, Kate, it’s complicated . . .” He shook his head. “Sod it, I’m trying to protect
“Hardly.” Kate sighed and tugged at Sherlock’s scarf, still around her neck. “I guess I should go and let you two have dinner. And you probably should stop at Babies “R” Us or something.” She smiled at the look of terror on both their faces. “Good luck. With everything.”
We have a lumpy couch and two armchairs in what passes for a lounge. A kitchen table and four mismatched chairs. An old tape deck and radio we run off batteries when the silence gets too loud. Sherlock fiddles with it every so often, but we’ve never found a broadcast from anywhere except London and that’s just an emergency alert that plays the same message over and over.  Sherlock was thrilled when he found a chess set in the wardrobe in the bedroom – he beats me twice a week. I won once but that was only because I cheated and switched his bishop for a pawn.
“Bollocks. The kid ended up in my operating theatre in Helmand. I removed his spleen and one of his kidneys. He lost a fucking eye. Pearce did that to him.”
John makes a decision. Mycroft makes an appearance.
“I suppose.”
“You were in bed with me.”
“Promise me.”
“I loved
He blinked. “Yes.”
“Yes, yes.”
Now he unlocked the front door, took the stairs two at a time and pushed into the kitchen. He heard Mrs. Hudson downstairs, rattling something, her radio turned to the classics, but he didn’t stop. He couldn’t talk about what he’d seen. Not yet. Not until he was sure. If there was thing he knew for certain about Mary, it was that she was a liar. Maybe what he’d seen was just another lie. He leaned against the table, trying to decide what to do next.
Sutton pointed his gun at John and Sherlock shouted and leapt toward Sutton. Sutton moved his gun back to Sherlock and he saw his finger squeeze against the trigger. Sherlock dove left, covered his head and closed his eyes.
She laughed. “I thought we were past all that, John.”
“Sherlock, let me take a look at you. “ John walked over to the fireplace. “You’re sweating. A lot.”
She pointed a finger at Kate. “Are you Bryant?”
“I’ve got to go. I’ll ring you later,” Greg says and hangs up.
John waited another five minutes, gathering his own strength.
The door flew open and John walked through the door, a cup of steaming tea in one hand, the newspaper in the other.
“John never did have any stamina. He always insisted we stop and eat at the most inopportune times.”
He set the dishes on the table and kissed her quickly on the cheek – she reminded him of his mother sometimes, the fussing, the endless pots of tea, the backbone of steel. Only his mother never once smelled like weed.
Sherlock frowned. “Less than 24 hours after Moriarty’s broadcast.”
) was perhaps more shocking to John than being shot in leg with a poison dart.
“I am serious, Sherlock. And if your brain wasn’t so addled with-“
“Half an hour ago. She said the poison is good, she said. Mad scientist good. She’s been trying all day to get in contact with her old professor – some kind of genius – wrote the textbook on anti-toxins. Other than that, she just keeps re-running tests.”
“Stop all your melodramatic posturing, John.” Sherlock stood in front of him, in a t-shirt and pants. “You’re drunk and I’m practically an invalid. We both need sleep.” He turned and slowly climbed into bed.
There were a few more clips, dating back to when Moriarty had successfully convinced London that Sherlock Holmes was a fraud. The same man stood beside him in those interviews too. She searched the Daily Mail archives and found out his name. Dr. John Watson. One Google search later, she found his blog. Bedtime reading, she thought, and bookmarked the site.
An older woman met them in the doorway. “Visitors for Sherlock? That’s lovely. I suppose you’ll be wanting tea.”
, just not easier.
“Yes, but if she did – what would you do?”
“Sorry. My ride was – “
She went looking for the washroom. It was next to the bedroom and she stood at the door, listening to John and Holmes argue.
“I’m your Achilles heel now?” John frowned.
Before John could remember one of the thousand reasons why he shouldn’t do this, before Sherlock could say no, before he could change his mind, he leaned forward and wrapped one hand around the back of Sherlock’s neck, pulled him close and pressed his mouth hard against his. Sherlock gasped and John thought that maybe he’d got it wrong after all, that maybe it was too late to get back what they’d never really had, and then decided if this was the only chance he ever got, he was going to make it the single, longest, best kiss there ever was. He slipped his tongue between Sherlock’s lips and the taste of him, the wetness of his mouth, the feel of his tongue, hit him like nothing ever had. He made a sound deep in his throat.
He understood that happiness was a piecrust promise. Easily made, easily broken. So he learned to hoard small moments of joy—John’s laugh, a puzzle solved, his bees in summer. He saved them like collateral to borrow against in hard times . . .
“Fuck.” Greg stood, trying to dispel his own disturbing thoughts. “We’re missing something.”
He shook his head at his appalling housekeeping. Why hadn’t he ever noticed? Oh yes. He heard his own voice in his head.
“Don’t be a fucking idiot. How long would you have kept this from me?” he shouted, his hand curling into a fist. For a moment, Kate thought John was getting ready to hit him. But then he paused and took a breath. When he spoke again, his voice was quieter, calmer. “You let me think you were dead for two fucking years. How long were you going to lie to me this time? Until the baby was born? Started school? Would you have let me spend my whole life believing a lie because it wasn’t your place to tell me the truth?”
She licked the gelatinous filling from her fingers and went through everything again from the beginning.
“It’s odd.  It’s as if I can see the city. No details, just lights around the shapes of things.  Tell me what you see. Exactly.”
After ten minutes, she realized that, unlike Sherlock’s, Mary’s phone was a digital filing cabinet. Hundreds of songs and pictures. Twitter, Dropbox and Facebook accounts. Forty names on her contact list. She’d completed 130 levels of Candy Crush, had downloaded every version of Angry Birds. Two episodes of
“Your explanations are tedious.” He leans down and nuzzles my neck. “And they are wildly inaccurate.”
? Sounds vague. So where does our client fit into this theory of yours?”
“Where is she now?”
She tried not to let her surprise show. She took another drink, then leaned forward across the table, “Seriously? Mycroft Holmes?”
“What you really mean is that you only have one.” He smiles but it doesn’t reach his eyes.
He raised one eyebrow. “You are a dangerous woman, Inspector Bryant.”
Two hours later, he had the beginnings of what might pass for a plan. He had two days before Moriarty scored his first direct hit – the explosion across the street. It was the opening move in a chess game he believed he still couldn’t win – even if he did know all of Moriarty’s moves in advance. He’d briefly considered simply keeping one step ahead of him, blocking him at every turn, but experience had shown him that events in this present were not set in stone. He knew Moriarty would raise the stakes, a course that would inevitably lead back to the roof.
The first clip that came up was an interview he’d done outside his house, soon after he turned out to be not quite as dead as everyone thought. He was wearing the most ridiculous hat and a self-satisfied smile. She recognized that look – it was the one worn by every clever boy who’d just shown up all his classmates.
He lay down again beside Sherlock. Sherlock was quiet but he could hear his brain analysing and calculating and planning. “Stop. Just be here. With me.”
“I can show you the documentation.”
“From America?”
“More explanation than apology. I forced his hand at Gidleigh Park. I clearly underestimated how much losing you again would affect him.”
“Consorting with my brother now?”
Sherlock tilted his head, and the light caught one side of his face and drew shadows under his eyes. He folded up the map and got it right the first time. “I went to sit in the garden before, while you were still asleep,” he said. He took a long breath. “I almost called Mycroft. I was going to tell him I was done. With all of it.”
Fucking hell, he’d been a daft prick.
She walked back to Sherlock and handed it to him. It was a photocopy of a Health Canada ID card from 2002. A small black and white staff ID picture.
“Or funerals, as I recall.” Simon said. “Yet here you are.” He laid a hand against Sherlock’s arm. Sherlock stiffened but didn’t pull away.
“My mother rang. While you were sleeping. She’s invited us for Christmas.”
“I’d be disappointed if you didn’t. While I was away –”
“Kate – please, just say Kate.”
Sherlock ignored her. “Did she know anyone in America? Friends? Family?”
“Excellent tea shop. I recommend the lemon scones.”
“So, what do you think?” Lestrade asked.
“John. You’re back,” Sherlock said. He made no move to get up.
“You never went back?”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “I’m not completely uncivilised.”
He paid the bill and drove her back to the hotel. He parked in front of the hotel and held up his warrant card when the doorman told him there was no parking there. “Sorry, sir.”
“Scissors, now.”
I cup my hand around his neck and pull him back down. “She’s someone who wants to find Fiona but doesn’t want to leave a trail.”
John nodded and carried the plates to the kitchen. His phone vibrated as he walked back to the table. He picked it up and swiped his thumb across the screen. He blinked and stared.  When he finally spoke, his voice was a low growl.
Kate twisted back out of the room and let Mycroft pass by her. She fought the urge to trip him, just for the sight of his smug face hitting the shiny linoleum, and walked back into the room. John was staring at a spot on the floor.
“Yeah, good morning to you.” John smiled and poked Sherlock’s stomach. “You’re crushing me, though.”
Sherlock arched one eyebrow at that.
“Looks very posh.”
She waited until she finished eating before retrieving the file from the bag.  The breakfast rush was over and the restaurant was nearly empty – a couple in one corner holding hands across the table, a woman in a wool coat drinking her third pot of tea.
Sherlock’s answer was to pull him closer. The laptop slipped from John’s grasp and they both reached down to steady it. Sherlock took it and set it on the coffee table and turned back to John. “Always okay, John. Always.”
Fifteen minutes later, Sherlock felt well enough to use the toilet and change his blood-stained t-shirt. He walked back from the bedroom, leaning heavily against John, and settled into his chair. John grabbed a bottle of Evian from the fridge, opened it and set it on the table beside Sherlock.
“Doesn’t seem fair to me.” John pulled the pouch of pipe tobacco from his father’s front pocket, opened it and held it to his nose. He loved that smell, a mix of wood and apples that would forever remind him of his father. “Will you get ever get too sick to fix?”
“If you know that, then you probably also know it had something to do with the private member’s bill he was planning to introduce in Parliament. The bill would have restricted mining rights in his riding. When he died, so did the bill.”
He knew how to leave Mary, he’d been doing it since the moment Sherlock returned. But how could he leave his child? Where did one learn to do that?
John shrugged. “I managed not to blubber into my mash, if that’s what you’re asking. I did wonder at the time why they seemed to be handling it so well . . .”
Thanks again to peg22 for filling in all my empty spaces, both on the page and in real life. Though she is beginning to wonder how much longer I can avoid the mess that was the last half hour of HLV.
“Oh, for crying out loud.”
“I thought you knew. Greg texted Mycroft when John stormed out.”
Mycroft sighed the sigh of a brilliant man surrounded by idiots. “Mary Morstan did not work exclusively for James Moriarty. Over the years, she accepted other freelance assignments. Usually for private contractors, and less frequently for government agencies that needed to distance themselves from actual events.”
“Ah, yes, Chloe. Salut to Chloe. Must go. John’s very hungry. Talk soon. Ta ra.”
She scanned the letter and let out a breath. “Damn . . .” She looked over to Sherlock and mouthed the word “wrong” to which he rolled his eyes.
Sherlock stopped himself short of reminding John that this was also the place where John had taken two dates on the same night. But John hadn’t told him that story yet. That story had come out the night of John’s bachelor party . . . the night when they had almost . . . when a lean too far forward would have undone everything Sherlock had tried to rebuild after . . . he remembered John splayed out in his chair, drunk, happy, beautiful . . .
He shook his head. “Does it matter? I had pasta earlier. At the cafeteria.” Sherlock looked at John. “How was your shower?”
) She closed the file, her hands shaking. Did she really want to do this? Sarah was dead.
“But you didn’t.”
When it was over, the family wiped their tears and exchanged hugs. All except one, a tall blond man, mid-thirties, dressed in a suit even more bespoke than Sherlock’s. He stood back from the rest, hands in his pockets.
John suddenly put his hands on Sherlock's chest and shoved him away, putting an arm's length of space between them. Sherlock stared at him, surprised. John gripped Sherlock’s arm and said, "Not here.” John jerked his head to left and then right, scanning down the alley. “Home,” John said and grinned brilliantly and Sherlock mirrored it back at him.
“An hour of silence and a good shot of morphine.”
She reached for the door handle and tugged it. The door was locked. “Goddamn it.” She leaned back in the leather seat. Crossed her arms. Uncrossed them when she realized she looked like a petulant teenager. Tried not to punch Mycroft in his self-satisfied pasty English face. “OK, you win. Go for it.”
The tea was followed by more beer and plates of lamb vindaloo and paneer, jasmine rice and a chicken tikka masala that put the Taj Mahal to shame.
Greg shrugged. “You said you had questions, Kate. About Sherlock.”
“Our life, John. Plural. Whether or not you choose to acknowledge it. Mary never changed that. No matter how hard you pretended otherwise. You know my feelings.”
“Knife,” Sherlock said. “Angry husband of a client.”
nutcase,” John said with a wide smile.
John leaned forward and started to give the driver the new address when Sherlock stopped him. He texted Lestrade.
John shook his head. “I haven’t spoken to Mary in months,” he said.
“Besides you two? Not that I know of.  But it’s not top secret - if anyone asked, we’d say she was away on holiday.”
“I think you’re wrong.” She reached out and rested one hand on his knee. “I think he loved you more than you knew.”
“Please, John.”
“Very well. Talk.”
“You were rather . . . distraught . . . at Mr. Holmes’ funeral.”
She wrapped her scarf around her neck and buttoned her coat. She had one hand on the door knob when she stopped and turned back. “John? You can stop worrying now. He’s fine. Everything’s going to be fine.”
Missing Chloe had made her a romantic. She’d be embarrassed to say any of that out loud. But everyone deserved a happily ever after. John and Sherlock. Even Mycroft, if Greg was the one. She planned to propose to Chloe the weekend after she flew home – they’d drive out to Montebello, stay at the bed and breakfast Chloe liked so much. She’d fill the room with candles and cover the bedspread with rose petals like she saw on
John suddenly felt like crying. He turned jerkily and headed back into the sunlight.
“No, I mean
“Yes.”
“Yeah, all right.”
“Not today.” Sherlock looked over at John, who was engrossed in the article. “We’re busy.”

“Get out of my way.”
John remembers this because he remembers everything that happened after. He wishes he didn’t, but every detail, every minute of those first weeks is still there, hovering below the surface of things, like wallpaper under paint, the pattern only showing through when the light shines on it in just the right way.
The well-dressed man (he’d yet to introduce himself) tapped the dark glass that separated them from the driver and the car pulled away smoothly from the curb.
“Then why do I have the feeling there’s something else going on – something personal between you and Magnussen.”
Sherlock leaned back as if John had hit him. “I am well aware of my actions and their tragic consequences. Tragic because the result was . . . is a motherless child and . . .” Sherlock hesitated and swallowed.
“Bollocks.” John grabbed his hand. “Can you just stop for a minute? I can’t do this like . . . this.”
. She wanted to get on a plane right then – to hell with Sherlock and John and Mary and Mycroft. But as long as someone was trying to get to her through Chloe – she had to stay put. She pulled a blanket over her, yawned and closed her eyes.
John sat in his chair opposite Sherlock. He sat on the edge so that their knees were almost touching. “I don’t . . . what are you doing, Sherlock?” he asked, his voice unsure.
“They say it’s more difficult for the one left behind,” Sherlock said.
John took a breath and tried to tease one thread loose from the tangled jumble of memories that filled his head. “He—” he forced himself to say his name—“Sherlock liked his tea with two sugars . . . unless he was forced to fetch it himself, in which case he was usually too lazy to look for it. I started buying packets of sugar since I never knew what I’d find in the sugar bowl. It drove me crazy at first.”
John moved his hands to Sherlock’s shoulders, kissing the back of Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock arched toward the touch, his hand falling from John’s hip, brushing against John’s erection. His hand stilled for a moment, and John pulled away, not sure.
“No. Looks like the camera was tampered with.”
“It’s still a bit chilly out here. There’s an empty table inside if you change your mind.”
Sherlock frowns.
“Do what? Kidnap me?”
her. Christ, Sherlock – one word, one word from you and I would have –”
John shook his head. “Fucking typical. I never knew what he was up to. He liked it that way, me tagging along at his heels like a lovesick puppy. Hoping that one day he’d finally take notice of what was right in front of him.”
choose if he doesn’t have all the facts?”
Mr. Holmes was not with him and no, he would not be joining him later. He turned down the offer of a guided tour of the grounds and afternoon tea (only £74, starting in half an hour) and the biodynamic wine lunch (£95) the next day.
She looked at her watch. 5PM. Wondered how long it took to get to the airport from here. She would need an ATM. And roses. This trip was going to bankrupt her. She made a decision, collected her purse and briefcase, and walked down the stairs and out the door.
John took a breath and looked up at Sherlock. “Something happened. You’re different. If it’s not drugs . . .”
I sleep in the afternoons. Rehearsing, I say, but he doesn’t see the humour. He draws the curtains and lies beside me, one arm wrapped tightly around my shoulder as if to anchor me in his world.
Sherlock, still bent over the microscope, looked up. “If you can’t find them, I suppose I can re-use the old ones. But really, John, you need to pay more attention to things.”
Chloe had taken the news better than she’d hoped and her superintendent was surprisingly (and suspiciously) sympathetic. And now Sherlock was being released from hospital and John had gone to fetch him home. Home. That’s what John had said to the doctor when he called to say that at this stage in his recovery, Sherlock would be more comfortable somewhere else. Kate had been around long enough to understand the code for
His phone vibrated and he answered before looking at the number. “What?”
He was halfway to the door when he turned back. “Any word from Chloe?”
“May I?”
John’s look of disbelief (also too familiar) startled Sherlock. Reminded Sherlock. This was a dream.
She should have stolen the whole bottle.
John was wearing a ring on his left hand. A simple gold band. Sherlock looked down at his own hand. He was wearing one too. He closed his eyes and the blurry images he’d seen before came into sharp focus, like a photograph in developing solution. Other images drifted away. He felt dizzy. He felt like he was dying. Maybe he was dying. Perfect.
“Don’t worry. John is quite safe. He’ll wake up with a headache and no memory of the weekend. We’ve found this particular compound to be quite effective.”
John smiled. “I’ll be very quiet. You won’t know I’m there.” He leaned in and kissed Sherlock gently on the lips.
That was two months ago.
“Where is she?”
“Goddammit,” she muttered when she saw.
“Oi, there.” John set his tea on the bedside table and took Sherlock’s chin in his hand, staring at his eyes. “What did you do last night, eh?” His other hand slid down and grasped Sherlock’s wrist. “Your heart is beating too fast.”
She knew she’d only have a few tries to come up with the correct password before it locked her out. She started with the obvious. M-A-R-Y. Nothing happened. Sherlock was too clever for that. But she guessed he was a fan of hiding in plain sight. She crossed her fingers and tried again. A-G-R-A.
I dig my phone out of my pocket and push a cup and a file off the menu for Taj Mahal. “Well, if that’s not the cherry on the top of this day. I’m now quoting Mycroft.” I shake the menu at him. “Last chance. Order or shut it.”
“It’s November. It’s not hot. Sit down.”
? Most of the time I don’t feel anything.” How could he explain it wasn’t a broken heart he suffered when Sherlock died? It was the total absence of heart and the sneaking suspicion that he wasn’t a good man because somehow he had ruined everything decent that had ever happened to him. He looked at the vicar. “I want him not to be dead anymore.” He drained the rest of his coffee. “My father told me once that I shouldn’t waste God’s time on trivial things, that I should save my prayers for something important. Guess this is what he meant. I haven’t thought about that in a long time.”
She started to ask, but he cut her off. “Don’t ask. I have no idea what he’s up to.”
He looks at me, eyes narrowed. “You’d think anyone who was close enough to worry about her would know she was on holiday. It’s all she talked about for the past couple months.” He leans in, “Now that the great Sherlock Holmes is on the case, I’m sure you’ll find her soon enough.”
“C’mon, you need to go to bed too,” John said a half hour later. They had fallen silent after Kate left. John stared at Sherlock over the rim of the glass, Sherlock stared at the mantle, lost somewhere down a dark hallway. If John closed his eyes, he could almost imagine they were back in time, back before Mary and the baby. Back before the roof at Bart’s. Back when he knew exactly what would come after this part.
“Oh, right. Hold on then.” He went to the keypad on the wall by the door and punched in a series of numbers. Sherlock pushed open the door.
“—to do. We located Fiona Miller for her. She is lolling about on a beach in Portugal sipping strawberry daiquiris and reading romance novels. Once you inform not-Charlotte of this happy news, we’re done. On to the next case.”
The clerk pointed to a hallway to the left of the main lobby. “Your room is in the back, facing the woods. Non-smoking. It’s a lovely suite.”
“Mycroft can take care of himself.” He went back to his phone. She wondered how long it would take him to find the download of
Sherlock looked up from the newspaper. “Sorry?”
“Sherlock?” John said a little while later. They were lying side by side on their backs, shoulders and fingertips touching. “One thing I still don’t understand.”
Kate squirmed under Sherlock’s stare. She felt like this was somehow all her fault. She didn’t like it. “And how’s that working out so far, eh?”
“I’ll get a chair.” She grabbed the least uncomfortable looking one from the kitchen and dragged it noisily behind her. Set it facing their chairs and sat down. “And I
John listened to the water running for a moment, and sat up, his hands gripping the bedspread, breathing hard.
He was as surprised as Harry that he made it through the first year – he had somehow survived all the holidays and birthdays and anniversaries. Something began to revive within him. “Grief,” David reminded him over drinks one evening, “is the final act of love, and recovery is the necessary betrayal on which your future depends.” He filled John’s glass. “And if you like this new nurse as much as you say you do, for God’s sake, stop talking about her and ask her out.”
Thanks again to peg22 for everything.
“Wrong question, Dr. Thompson. You should ask – did he care? And the answer to that, as all the world well knows, is that he didn’t give a flying fuck. About me. About anything.”
“By taking back whatever information Magnussen has collected.”
For a brief moment he thought that maybe he’d gotten it all wrong after all. “Holmes. Sherlock Holmes.”
“You’ll need to explain that, John.”
“Yes, dear.”
She stood and pulled the scarf tight around her neck. Sherlock was not getting it back. She would consider it a wedding gift. She wondered if she should invite him over to the house or maybe they should all meet in a neutral location – like a Starbucks.
Sherlock walked to the window. “Continue.” He stared at the flat across the street.
John woke with his mouth watering for the taste of him, the echo of his voice in his ears.
Sherlock gave the taxi driver the address of Wing Fa. He saw John’s surprise; they hadn’t been there since the night John shot the cabbie. Sherlock stared out the window, tapping his fingers against his legs, reveling in the breathing, living thing that was London, cars like blood vessels speeding towards the heart, the hum in the concrete, the beat like a pulse beneath the pavement, the warmth of the buildings.
Greg kept up a steady stream of small talk all the way to the airport. The engagement ring had made him nostalgic. He told her how he’d proposed to his first wife, who was in love with all things Scottish, on a trip to Edinburgh. How she proved it two years later when she left him for the new office manager at the insurance company where she worked. He had transferred to London from Inverness and had a brogue so thick, every time he spoke, Greg expected to see sub-titles running across his chest.
Sherlock makes a move to leave and I grab his shoulders and keep him still. “When
Sherlock groans and John smiles because he knows it will all be fine. Because they
For the first time, Sutton looked confused. “I don’t know anything about that.”
From the back seat of the town car, Mycroft watched his brother walk across the lobby. Noted the weight loss, the ridiculous cap, the way he still held his arm tightly against his side.
Sherlock spent the morning writing a detailed timeline of everything that happened between the explosion across the street and jumping from the roof. He added what he’d learned later about Moriarty’s assassins and where they were during that spring –
“My very own Mary Poppins.”
He needed a cigarette. He hadn’t smoked in nearly twenty years, but he needed one now. He looked around, thinking. Wardrobe. Top shelf. His grandfather’s old cigar box.
She looked up and saw both John and Sherlock staring at her. “Oh, sorry.”
“Come back to bed,” John said. “I’m cold.”
“Me? I’ve been watching you two – it’s so obvious . . .”
“And trifle. I don’t believe in trifle.”
“Do you come here often?” John finally asked, partly to break the silence and partly because he was curious, but it came out sounding like a cheap pickup line.
Sherlock opened the gate to the terrace and gestured Kate through. “Alpaca. From Peru.”
It was as good a way as any to make a decision.
“Almost. Canada.” She held out her hand, “Kate Bryant.” She left out the Inspector part.
When the news was over, Sherlock took his violin out of the case. He pulled up a chair in front of the window and folded himself into it, picking out short melodies, a little Saint-Saëns, a little Kreisler. His fingertips squeaked on the strings, and he closed his eyes. It had been a long time since he picked up the violin, the arthritis in his hands had made playing more painful than pleasurable.
Kate stood up and took the bag from Greg. “Detective Inspector.”
“You’re late,” Sherlock said when she entered. He was back in the leather chair. “And you brought coffee. Excellent.” He held out one hand and she reluctantly handed it over.
Kate smiled. “Canadian, Mrs. Hudson. I’m Canadian.”
It was Sherlock’s turn to frown. “Oh please. It was the night Lestrade took you out to that horrendous pub in Brixton and then left you for some, and I quote, “bird in yellow spandex with enormous tits.”
Sutton lifted the gun again. “Now you’re just mocking me. There is no figure I could name that would be worth more than the knowledge that John Watson is dead.”
“Yes, sir.”
John walked into the kitchen, washed his hands. Reached under the sink and pulled out a bottle. Splashed some quickly into two glasses, walked over and sat opposite her in his chair.
Mycroft frowned. “I know I am in no position to ask you for a favour-“
Somewhere far away, he remembered they probably shouldn’t do this. Not on Sherlock’s first night home. He resolved to lie as quietly as possible which worked until Sherlock replaced his hands with his lips and the heat of Sherlock’s mouth on his cock sent him somewhere where he couldn’t remember anything. He felt Sherlock’s hands move up his chest, fingering his nipples and when Sherlock sucked harder and faster, he heard his own ragged moans as he came with a gasp.
“Yes, well. I thought it was time you and I had a private chat.”
“Do you know where?”
John wanted to know all these stories. How Sherlock got hurt, got better and got hurt again, long before he came around.
Mycroft sighed. “Never – ”
Sherlock sat.
“Two fucking geniuses you are. Did you kill him before or after he told you what was in the dart?”
“Tommy Pearce is Ronan Pearce’s father,” Mycroft said.
Banks set John down gently so that he was sitting on the floor leaning against the door frame. He walked around them to Sutton, leaned down, felt his neck, and turned to Sherlock, shaking his head.
He’d been back at the flat since the night he’d found out the truth about Mary. He knew he’d have to make a decision eventually, but until then . . .
Sherlock frowned at John.
“Yes, and . . .”
Sherlock pulled at John’s shirt. “I think I’d feel better if you kissed me.”
Sherlock takes a long sip of tea, staring at me lecherously over the cup. The lecture won’t last long if he keeps that up and I am about to tell him so, when he sighs and puts his cup down.
Then he placed one hand on Sherlock’s chest, heaved him away and punched him square in the jaw.
“That’s not enough for you?”
“The odds that the samples are identical . . .” His voice sounded far away.
John said, “Kiss me, for fuck’s sake,” and even though you knew it was because he wanted you to stop talking about trace elements and carpet fibres and blood types, you kissed him and it was brilliant but it was all teeth and harder than it should have been and you bit John’s lip just to hear him gasp.
“And yet you did. Have you and Mary set a date yet?”
Sherlock stood up straight. He shoved his hands into his pockets to keep from hitting someone and let Mycroft do what Mycroft did best. Suggest everything, promise nothing. Soothe without substance. Speak above and around and between until there is nothing left for the opponent to do but give in.
“Still going to your brunch?”Sherlock asked.
Mycroft stood by the fireplace, talking into his phone in hushed tones.  He glanced over at Sherlock and slipped his phone back into his jacket pocket. “Shall I?” he asked.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Yes, you should.”
“And there is precious little that I won’t do to obtain that objective.”
He walked back to the desk, opened a drawer and handed Sherlock a brown padded envelope. His name and address were printed on the front.
“Your text said John was with her.”
“He’s sleeping.” He picked up a plate. “I can do the washing up.”
The hum was back. Only this time it was more than a hum – it was an electric storm that had every neuron firing.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I am concerned by your situation, John, not incapacitated. There is a panto of some sort this evening. The boy will be there with his mother.”
John came first, his head back, his hands holding tight to Sherlock’s shoulders, his breath an exploding hiss of “Sherlock . . .”
“What?” He wiped a hand over his face, and took two steps back to John.
I sit on the bed and think. Charlotte Ivan is not Fiona’s sister, she’s her girlfriend.  Why does the name sound so familiar?
“They hate all their customers?”
Two weeks later, John made an appointment with Dr. Thompson. He hadn’t been to see her since before his wedding. He couldn’t bring himself to go – not even after he found out the truth about Mary, and not during those long months after she shot Sherlock and he’d taken refuge at Baker Street. While it was still happening, talking about it was impossible. Saying the words out loud would only make them more real and more terrible than they already were.
“Thank you for meeting with me, John.”
“No, I just don’t feel like playing anymore.” John leaned against the table. “So, are we taking the case?”
Sherlock leaned in and kissed John on the cheek. “It means that my only goal here is to make you reasonably happy. With me, with us, with our life. I wouldn’t have encouraged you to take the test if I weren’t prepared to live with the consequences. You are an honourable man, John Watson, and we’re both the better for it.”
“C’est la même chose.”
He reached down and slid his pants off. Sherlock rolled away for a moment, tossed his pants to the floor and rolled back. They fell back together, as if that moment of space between them had been too much. They pushed against each other, every bit of skin touching, ragged breaths filled with a need long buried, hot and desperate kisses, the friction threatening to overtake them as they thrust against each other, slick with heat.
“I zigged when I should have zagged,” Sherlock said by way of explanation.
“Where do you keep your tea?”
John turned the corner and felt the familiar pain grip his chest. This was the place he’d hoped to find his happily ever after Sherlock. He’d been so angry with him for being dead and later, so angry with him for not staying dead. Sherlock’s return had made John’s life with Mary seem small and foolish.
Sherlock’s cigarette was half gone when he stopped in mid-drag. He turned to Greg, handed him the lit cigarette and reached for his scarf.
Sherlock doesn’t disagree.
She recognized John Watson when he opened the door. Shorter than she expected, older than he’d appeared on the YouTube clips. Dark circles under his eyes, like he hadn’t had a decent night’s sleep in weeks.
John watched him swallow the pill, took the glass and set it on the bedside table. They sat quietly for a moment, then John leaned forward and raised one hand to brush a stray curl from Sherlock’s forehead. His hand lingered against Sherlock’s cheek and she saw him lean into it. “You promise me, the minute the pain is too much –”
“Good.”
Sherlock didn’t answer, just turned and closed the door. He turned back to Greg. “It’s John.”
” folder.  He managed to delete twenty or so before he closed his laptop with a sigh and leaned back. He’d need to go a lot further than Edinburgh to get through them all.
“John, I don’t think . . .” Sherlock held up his hand.
“Magnussen was attempting to discover whether Chloe is your pressure point – your vulnerability – your Achilles heel. The one thing – or one person – that you would risk everything to keep safe.”
“That was the consensus, yes.”
“Mary is not here.” Sherlock said. “She was here. From what we can tell, she left Canada almost a month ago.”
) and he attempted to explain cricket (
“And he knows my feelings have not changed and we . . . we are working through our issues.”
“You know my methods, John.”
The newspaper was lying on the bed and he picked it up. He looked at the date again – March 28, 2010. Why return to this day? Why not yesterday or tomorrow or ten years from now?
She’d pick up Chloe at the airport, take her back to the hotel and propose to her. Get down on one fucking knee if she had to. She’d marry her and move to Toronto and make babies and live happily ever after. Leave Sherlock and John and Mary and Mycroft fucking Holmes to work out their own problems.
Kate stopped and turned. “Who?”
No shit.
Love,
Anger flares, replaced quickly by gratitude. “I’m going for a walk. Come if you like.”
"What?”
He touched his forehead. “If the blood is any indication, it appears I’ve cut my head.”
He saw Sherlock emerge through the door and lowered his window.
“It was winter. I don’t do cold well.”
“Was that Lestrade? Was he talking about Moriarty?”
He made it to the top a millisecond before she did.
John laughed. She’d not heard that sound before. “Shut up, Sherlock.” He stood, took Sherlock’s hand and pulled him up and for a brief, stupid moment Kate thought they were going to dance. Sherlock coughed and made a great show of rearranging and retying his dressing gown before limping to his chair and sitting down.
She dropped the envelope into the garbage can by the elevator.
“Vauxhall Cross is where he works – when he’s in London, I mean.” Her accent slipped. Rich girl playing street kid. “007 headquarters.” She paused and looked at Kate. “I like your accent.”
“Bloody hell,” John panted in Sherlock’s ear and ground against him again. “Wait.” John reached down between them and unzipped his jeans and lowered them past his hips. Sherlock pushed himself up on one arm and did the same. They fell back against each other, moving together, hands tangled, finding that rhythm where it all fell away and it was just the two of them. Sherlock hissed John’s name as he came and John clung to his shoulders, thrusting against him, burying his head in Sherlock’s shoulder as the wave threatened to toss him to the floor. Sherlock wrapped his arms around him and pulled his hips tight, sliding his hand down John’s cock, sending him over the edge. He came with a shout and dug his fingers hard into Sherlock’s back.
“I never saw him before yesterday. He gave me ten quid to hold up the sign. I thought it was daft, but I never had ten quid before. I don’t have to give it back, do I?””
He clears his throat and without looking up from the bowl, he says, “John?”
The car was waiting at the kerb outside the school. Banks held an umbrella over John’s head and helped him into the back seat. There was a steaming silver thermos in the mahogany cup holder. “Chamomile tea,” Banks said. “It might help.”
Back in Sherlock’s room, she pulled the case off one of the pillows and gathered up everything she could find – t-shirt, sweater, socks and slippers and stuffed them into the pillow case. When she picked up his sweat pants, a tiny piece of paper floated out of the pocket and onto the floor. She picked it up, carefully unfolded it and read the words –
John set the phone between them. “It makes no sense. Who is he? And don’t take this the wrong way, but why me and not you? I’m the

impressed.”
He raised one eyebrow. “John may embellish events on occasion, but my deductions are real.”
John leaned over and kissed him again. Slower this time. He stopped, sat up and unbuttoned his shirt and tossed it on the floor beside the bed. He stood for a minute and stepped out of his pants and jeans.
Sherlock leaned over the desk. “Tommy Pearce was your son.”
“I don’t want to talk about . . . him.”
It was now, it was forty years ago.
Mrs. Hudson. “From the beginning this time.”
As the bus turned onto King Edward Street, a man hurried out the door of Barts and sprinted to the bus stop. Molly smiled and smoothed her hair as she watched him approach. He had time for a quick kiss before they boarded the bus together.
“I’m sorry,” John said and Ronan ran back to his mother.
He stood, a little unsteady from the whiskey, took Sherlock’s outstretched hand and helped him out of his chair. He leaned in and pressed his face into Sherlock’s shoulder, breathing in fabric softener and the sharp scent of hospital-issue soap.
John reached into his pocket for his mobile. “That does it.” He held the paper out to Sherlock. “I just saw you last night. You know what the bloody date is.”
He held the screen up to Mycroft.
is incidental.”
John followed him, past the empty boxes and bags of rice, up two steps and out the door into the alley. The empty alley.
“They do happen,” Lestrade argued. “That Russian diplomat –”
Relapses happened. Some nights, he’d find a bar or nightclub far from home, sit at a table against the wall and look for someone willing to give him what he wanted. He never asked their names, never made small talk. At home, emptying his pockets, he would sometimes find a phone number scrawled across a napkin. He tossed them and never went back to the same place twice.
“Good.” Sherlock went back to staring at the fireplace.
“He’s going to be all right.”
Kate just sat, arms folded.
“Thanks for the ride. Tell Greg I can take a taxi later.”
“I know,” John said, kissing him quiet.
It was dark too soon.
“That’s amazing. You must be over the moon. I can’t believe it.”
We do our “shopping” at what used to be Tesco on South Street – we trade the Hobart sisters some magazines for petrol and six bottles of homemade beer – and get back to the cottage before dark. If Sherlock is still seeing halos – sorry, parhelions – he’s not saying.
She took her time, wanting to give Holmes time to get settled. When she returned, John had cleared away the tea and Sherlock was sitting in the leather chair wearing sweat pants and a faded white t-shirt under a blue silk bathrobe.
Now he was certain this was a dream. John had never wanted him. Not like that. John wanted many things from Sherlock over the years. He’d wanted him to be more polite. He’d wanted him to eat regularly. He’d wanted him not to be dead . . . but he’d never wanted . . . him. Preposterous. Sherlock would have known. John would have said. He wouldn’t have married Mary. Who marries someone despite . . . in spite . . . who could keep a secret like that?
happy, she wants everyone to be happy. But why did you come?”
Sherlock drummed his fingers against the table, then stood and pushed through the kitchen doors. He came back with two bottles of Cobra beer, a basket of warm naan and a plate of samosas. “We can start with these.”
“Where am I going?”
“I might as well be comfortable. The kettle’s boiling.”
“I know no such thing.” Sherlock gripped the chair and pulled himself up. “It’s precisely because I do have skin in this game that I must stop Magnussen from ruining Mary. From hurting you.”
“I could eat.” I look around the room. “Takeaway? Indian? Maybe Taj Mahal?”
He leaned his head back against the wall. There was something familiar about Ronan, but nothing he could put his finger on. Maybe he’d come into his clinic once with his mother or sat opposite him on the Tube ride home. It was one of those puzzles that your brain works out on its own and the solution comes to you days later in the middle of shaving or drinking your tea.
“No worries. It’s been five years. I can wait a bit longer.”
“I assume your brother sent you?”
Sherlock frowned. “What are you talking about?”
Greg rolled his eyes. “He can be . . . a bit dramatic.”
“Oh, I am such an idiot – yes, the baby! Anna was pregnant when she showed up. Quite far along, really.” Mrs. Ashcroft spoke softer, as if she thought someone could hear. “Apparently her husband works in counter-terrorism. He couldn’t come with her – Anna was very upset when she got here. I was quite worried. But he’ll be here soon, so it’s all going to be fine . . .”
“Look at it from his point of view. He believed, rightly or wrongly, that you’d wait for him. You didn’t. Instead you proclaimed to the world that you were in love with Mary Morstan. You married her. And if she didn’t turn out not to be who she claimed, you’d still be living with her. Choosing colours for the nursery.”
John looked at Sherlock. “You feel like eating?”
Greg picked up the bottle on the table. “Champagne? What are we celebrating?”
Sherlock sighed and moved his legs off John. He swung them around and sat on the edge of the bed. “Definitely not juice.”
Kate went into the kitchen, took plates from the cupboard and opened a bag. “I brought Indian. Hope that’s alright.”
Dinner was a disaster.
Sherlock swept the magazines off the table and picked up the Times. He found what he was looking for on the front page of the Arts & Culture section.
“Yes. The ring was not the only evidence. My investigation was quite thorough. We could go to the police, but I’m not sure what purpose it would serve.”
“Wow, you
you get shot . . .” she repeated. Greg had said Sherlock couldn’t – wouldn’t – identify the shooter. She stood and busied herself with clearing away the cups. She thought better when her hands were occupied. Sherlock’s eyes followed her.
“You paid?” I don’t know what I am more surprised at. He paid, or he went to the door, or he just snaked a samosas out of the bag and popped it whole into his mouth.
“Were you always such a complete ass, or did I never notice?”
“Sherlock,” John warned. “Don’t.”
“I know my own daughter, Inspector.”
“A name on a list of Moriarty’s associates. Nothing more – I never sussed out her connection to Goodale. Something came up and I moved on.”
Vic Bellamy lay on the crumpled sheets, face up, eyes open, arms outspread, greasy grey hair fanned out on the pillow around him. An open envelope of white powder and a bent spoon lay on the nightstand. A needle, half full with what John guessed was heroin, protruded from his left arm
“Didn’t Mycroft tell you any of this?” Greg took another drink of his beer. Looked at his phone.
*****
But even now, with the warmth of John’s hand in his as irrefutable proof that he finally made it all the way home, he presses his fingers against his veins and hopes it’s enough.
Sherlock said nothing.
“Me.”
“You reckon? Jesus, you are full of information. Who was the second victim?”
But then, for the second time in as many months, Sherlock beats the odds.
John got as far the landing before he had to stop. He waved at Sherlock to go ahead, but Sherlock paused and waited, one open hand trailing behind him. If Sherlock noticed the tremor in John’s hand, he didn’t say. The tremor was new, symptom number twelve if John were counting, which he wasn’t.
He shook his head impatiently.
He lays out the facts, finds connections, makes deductions. He’s a brilliant schoolboy in a classroom of idiots. But there are things Sherlock cannot deduce, conclusions he will never draw, murders he will never solve. These are the cases that never make it into the blog, cases like this one. I don’t write them up because they’re bad for business. At least that’s what I tell him.
She sat on the bottom step and retrieved her phone from her pocket. She typed quickly and pressed send before she could change her mind.
Mycroft had offered Sherlock the use of a car (big, black and ridiculously comfortable) and driver (big, pale and rather frightening) for the duration. Sherlock accepted quickly and appeared (almost) grateful to his brother. John’s world truly had gone mad.
“I’m still his next of kin,” Harry said, stepping forward.
“Hardly. Although I am happy my brief career in the theatre didn’t go to waste.” I’m also happy to see Sherlock’s faint smile as he sips the whiskey. But there’s something else there. Do I search for it or leave it alone? It’s a constant question.
– that would help him understand.
“Just give me my coat.” John retied the gown and slid off the bed. Stepped barefoot into his trainers. At least they had let him keep his pants.
“And how do you plan on doing that? He’s not going to give it to you because you say please.”
“So everyone keeps saying.” She scraped her plate for every last crumb of chocolate cake and finished her coffee. “Can I ask one more question?”
“No comment,” he said, smiling.
Poor sweet dumb Molly. Brilliant scientist Molly, but dumb about men Molly. She’d run the forensics lab at Barts for thirty years before finally retiring to Cardiff with her Welsh husband, who immediately left her for a tenor in the Castle choir.
“And you?” This was going as well as some of John’s first dates.
Later, they ordered lunch in the room – cold lamb sandwiches on fresh baguettes and the local ale. Only slightly less expensive than the steak dinner the night before. They sat in the two armchairs facing each other, plates balanced on their knees, bottles of beer on the floor beside them and talked – John about his new job (shite), new flat (more shite) and Sherlock talked about everything except Moriarty. There were silences, during which John thought, “How can we ever leave here?” But as long as neither dared say it out loud, he could pretend this room was the real world and everything beyond it a dream.
The woman sits, hands in her lap, worrying the zipper on her handbag and waits for him to say something. Finally, she retrieves her billfold and counts out five £50 notes. “Is this enough? I can get more.”
Sherlock looked at John. “The problem is you
“Who was their informant?” I ask but I’m sure I know the answer.
She gently pushed open the door to Sherlock’s new room.
“Whatever. Two, you were wrong that Mary was after me. And Chloe.”
moment. This was the perfect one.
“No, not a sister . . . but someone close. Not your mother. Mothers don’t usually cause this kind of devotion to their death. Mothers are supposed to die-“
“And the baby?”
In his dreams, John never once looked Sherlock in the eyes, curled his left hand into a tight fist, and punched him.
“Angelo’s. I reckon it’s time we go on a real date.” He kissed him quickly. “Think of it as a do-over.”
When he finally reappeared, his own case of PTSD etched into every new shadow on his face, he found the room empty. The fire gone cold.  The haze was a welcome relief. Consolation prize for the runner up.
“That proposal you submitted.”
“He’s asleep.” John rubbed his neck. “Finally.” He sounded like the tired father of a small child.
Sometimes John wishes Sherlock liked him more and loved him less.
He drank the whiskey quickly. Before he could get up to order a second one, a well-manicured hand set down a full glass in front of him.
The roads are slick with new snow but if Harry’s nervous, she doesn’t let on. She talks happily about the twins and Clara and the new baby (
“So I’ve heard. Speaking of associates . . .”
Sherlock held a glass under the tap. John walked behind him and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s chest. Laid his head against Sherlock’s shoulder.
She went on. “I learned she had a boyfriend. None of her friends ever met him, and only one remembered his name. Even then, it was a common enough last name. This friend recalled that he worked for the government in Ottawa. Not exactly helpful – it’s a government town. I spent two weeks going through personnel records until I found him.”
“Do you think Bellamy was murdered?” John repeated.
The phone buzzed again. “He says there are several severed hands hanging from the London Eye.”
“Oh, come on, Kate. I need a distraction.”
John leaned down and kissed Sherlock. “It’s just . . .”
We sit outside after supper and drink the homemade beer – as weak as piss – and talk about the old days. About Lestrade and Molly and Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson and everyone else we used to know. We never say it out loud but every conversation ends with us wondering if they’d made it through.
Lauren stepped between John and Sherlock.  Her voice was low and full of warning, “This is our wedding and you two are not going to fuck it up. If you need to behave badly, do it somewhere else.” She pointed a finger at John. “And yes, we invited him. It was probably mad, but we did it and we told you we did and you never said no, so you don’t get to throw a tantrum now.”
“You loved her.”
John gave up the struggle and sat on the edge of the bed, his hand still held in Sherlock’s. “What do you want, Sherlock?”
“I am getting up, John. I am not receiving visitors in my bedroom like the consumptive heroine of a Victorian romance novel.”
“She would never write 9pm. Quebec uses a twenty-four clock. 9pm is 21 hours –
When there was no answer, she leaned down and grabbed John by the arm. “You need to go upstairs and make sure he’s all right.”
“Dumplings wait for no man.”
Sherlock grabbed John’s hand again, held it to his chest. “I know.” He lifted John’s hand to his lips. Kissed his palm.
“Eight – nine years, I guess. Been with the Cold Case Unit for the last two. It’s satisfying when you solve a crime everyone gave up on years ago. Especially for the families. Frustrating as hell when you don’t. Well, you know how it is. You both did quite a bit of . . . detecting.”
Sherlock felt John’s hand through his pajamas. Warm. Real. He stared at John’s neck. Tanned, no wrinkles, a bit of brown chest hair peeking out from the top of his shirt. He sat back down.
John woke with a start. He was alone in the bed.
“Yeah, yeah, I’ll call Sherlock.” Greg resisted the urge to toss his mobile through the window. “Anything else? Don’t most poisons have antidotes?”
Sherlock hates John’s clothes (another green jumper, John, really?), his taste in books, his sister. Over the past week, he’s accused John of cheating at cribbage, using all the hot water, hiding the biscuits.
“John, I – ”
“So you know what it’s like.” He remembered reading the stories out of Basra. The heavy casualties on both sides. The withdrawal from the city that the politicians painted as a badly managed retreat. Then there were the pictures in the
“But it’s still only a theory. I was never able to find any evidence to support it.”
He smiled an anxious kind of smile. “Just not with you.”
When the worst of it was over, Sherlock stood and held out one hand. “Come to bed, John” was all he said.
.  Whatever that meant.
“Well, you’re a bit distracted.”
After fifteen minutes, she held up her fork. “Stop. Please. I will never understand.”
“Ah,” Ella said in her best therapist voice. “Marriage can be difficult in the best of circumstances.”
“Ah.”
In the cafeteria, Kate paid for the coffee and ham sandwich and carried her tray to a corner table by the window. Away from the chatting nurses and the worried mothers. She checked Sherlock’s phone for new texts – there was only one.
John got to the door just as she started pounding on it.
The 7:30 train from King’s Cross to Edinburgh was crowded but mercifully no one sat beside him. He was looking forward to five hours of silence. No crying toddler, no whinging patients, no chatter about last night’s football match or politics or any of the thousand things everyone but him seemed to care about.
Sherlock pulled John’s hips closer and moved his mouth to John’s ear. “I missed you.”
Kate watched John’s anger drain from his face and he knelt in front of Sherlock. “What is it?”
“You know there was a trace of heroin in the dart? Your dart.”
She wasn’t sure if he meant leave the hospital or leave London. Both, probably. “I will. When John gets back.”
“Inspector, didn’t your mother ever teach you that it is unwise to get into cars with strangers?”
“And say what? We have no evidence linking Moriarty to anything. All we have is a name. If it really is his name.”
"It'll pass in a minute, just try to relax—” Sherlock frantically reached for John’s hand, found it, and clutched tightly. He was obviously in considerable pain, but it appeared that the panic of not being able to breathe was overriding everything else.
He wasn’t going to last long. Sherlock stroked him faster and John’s body became one long line of tension until the first wave of orgasm hit. He leaned back, lost somewhere between coming and dying. After an eternity, John rolled over and watched as Sherlock took his own cock in his hand, rolling his fingers over the tip, looking at John, his eyes dark. Wanting.
Sutton struggled to push Sherlock away and brought his left hand above the desk. Sherlock saw the gun, a 9 mm Walther, and let go of Sutton’s collar. He stepped back from the desk.
But for some reason he didn’t mind. He found himself imagining what it would be like to tug it up over John’s head, his fingers scraping up John’s chest . . .
“We can hardly compare—”
"If I agree, will you help me to my chair? This visit is the first interesting thing that’s happened in ages. I may have been shot, but I will die of boredom if I’m forced to lie here much longer.”
While he paid Charlotte, he heard Sherlock on the phone.  “He posted a video on YouTube – called it
Five minutes later, John brushed his teeth and swallowed another fentanyl. If he took much more, he’d risk sleeping through his own death. Where was the fun in that?
“Stop.” John looked at Sherlock, his hand drifting to Sherlock’s knee.
She shook her head. “John made a wish.”
We drive into what used to be Chichester – there isn’t much left except for a few burnt out buildings and the remains of the Cathedral. Like most places these days, it’s deserted.  The whole world feels like secondary school on a Saturday afternoon.
Sherlock stilled, his hand holding the pin, John’s fingers around his wrist. “All right.”
“No, you don’t think.” Kate’s fists were held tightly to her side. “When were you planning on telling me the real reason you’re in Ottawa? Huh?” She lowered her head and when she looked back at Sherlock, her eyes were wet.  “I thought you were actually showing some human empathy, coming here to tell me about Sarah. I thought . . .” Kate swallowed hard and the anger drained from her. She bit her lip and stared at Sherlock.
Kate realized he was not talking about Sarah. “Yeah, but you came back,” she said.
“There’s never anyone else here.”
Mycroft’s expression was pained. “Nevertheless, I believe . . .”
“Sherlock, why are you so certain my wife wasn’t involved?” John said slowly.
“How much do you remember?”
“I’m not –”
Mrs. Hudson poured a bit more whiskey into her own teacup. “Well, when you’ve seen what I’ve seen . . .”
Sherlock took John’s hand and pulled it close to his chest. John struggled, but Sherlock held on. John gave a token shove and dropped his head against Sherlock’s chest.
Not my best plan, I admit.”
Kate took the glass and held it in her hands. Stared at it. Looked up at John, who was looking at Sherlock, who was looking at her. Great. “So I guess this is the part where you two genius detectives tell me the plan.”
What the hell had he been thinking?
The cathedral fills with the first notes of . . . you knew this once . . . Bach’s Toccata and Fugue in D minor. Funeral music.  Last time you heard it, you were with John. In another church. At another funeral. John was half in love with you by then, wasn’t he?  You just wanted an easy shag.  But that was before . . .
She sat back and watched him sleep, working out what excuse she could give her superintendent that would let her stay in London a few days longer. What excuse she could give Chloe.
He never heard from Pearce again. Hadn’t thought about him in months.  Didn’t know he had a wife or kid, didn’t know he was dead until tonight.
“DS Donovan. Lestrade got called away, so he told me to fetch you and take you to his lordship’s flat.”
I know this has been a long time coming...I can only blame Christmas and holidays and real life for interfering.
“Close. Magnussen. Charles Magnussen.”
“Where are we going?”
“Idiot!”
John turned to Kate and pointed a finger. “You have nothing to say about it. Why the hell are you even still here?”
Kate recognized that move. Get too close to an uncomfortable truth and Sherlock deflected. She looked at the paper. “Of course . . . I just . . .”
They ordered again from Ajit Palace. The delivery man was smiling as he handed John the bags. “You must really like curry.”
“Is there more tea?” Sherlock asked carefully.
John nudged Sherlock over and climbed into bed, turning on his side, an arm over Sherlock’s chest. “You’re an impossible child.”
Kate smiled. “We’re kind of obnoxious about him, aren’t we?”
Sherlock leaned against Kate’s shoulder. “Your way of fishing for more personal information?”
“You need to keep your strength up, dear. You can’t live on tea and biscuits.”
He coloured. “Sorry. I’ll try –”
Sherlock never took his eyes off Kate. “My main objective was, and is, to keep John safe.”
“English, yeah?” Greg ran a hand through his hair. “Anything we can use? Like a fingerprint on the dart, maybe a chemical map to the whereabouts of these arseholes? I’ve seen Sherlock pinpoint a suspect to within a block just by scraping dirt off a pair of trainers.”
Sherlock and Mycroft exchanged glances. John wasn’t sure who he wanted to punch first.
“Not the outcome you had hoped for, I expect, but you may find a certain peace in knowing the man who killed Sarah is dead.”
Sherlock avoided looking at John. “I agree with John – Mary didn’t do this.”
“Sorry, what?”
“Oh, it’s like that now, is it?” John said, running his hand slowly down Sherlock’s bare chest. He stopped when he came to the small round scar – still raised and red. It hurt to look at it, not only because of the damage it had done to Sherlock’s heart, but to his own as well.
“Don’t move.” John walked into the kitchen. He got a glass, filled it with water, and came back to Sherlock. “Take these.” He held out two pills.
At six, Sherlock was standing by the window, staring at the building across the street, while John watched the evening news on the telly. There was a brief mention of Moriarty’s murder near the end of the broadcast. Sherlock knew Lestrade would never solve this one.
He pulled back and looked at Sherlock. Wished he could just walk into that mind palace and find the room where they’d both be okay with this new . . . development. Sherlock stared back, nothing on his face. John would just have to believe what came out of his mouth.
John looked over at him. “Tell him that.”
“What time is checkout?” John asked later. “Did you notice?”
It was almost midnight when they finished eating. Steak, roasted potatoes, asparagus, apple crumble to finish. A bottle of Bordeaux – 2008 Château Lusseau. The meal cost almost an entire week’s pay.
“It’s half six. Won’t everyone be gone by now?”
I hear him come in and he stands behind me, his hands on my shoulders. Our faces are side by side in the mirror and his eyes are as blue as they have ever been. He smiles and raises one eyebrow and I am transported back to the bathroom in Baker Street and I half expect him to start grousing about the steam on the mirror or the staleness of the biscuits. Instead he massages my neck and I lean into his touch and he whispers everything that matters and he takes my hand and leads me to bed.
“Sherlock-speak? I’m flattered.”
“But children, John. There will be small children.” He sighs. The sigh of a wise man surrounded by fools.
“You’re deflecting . . . this is not . . .” John started, but Sherlock moved forward, his hand rising to find the side of John’s face, and he caught John in the middle of a word, the middle of a heartbeat and kissed him. He kissed him as long as he could, until his thoughts began to fracture and white spots burst on the backs of his eyelids.
“Bollocks,” he muttered to himself. If he were honest, he liked it here and he wanted it to be real. He liked solving Lestrade’s cases. He liked kissing John and was certain he would really like where they were headed. He closed his eyes and allowed himself to see everything that had happened – and was now to happen again. The picture grew darker the longer he imagined it.
“Famished.” If he had to wake up, he only hoped it would be after he’d finished at least two servings of Wing Fa’s pork dumplings with peanut sauce.
Sherlock smiled. He was an arrogant ass. “I am not on drugs, Mycroft. You have at best a mediocre police force that needs to be shepherded all over London on a lead. So be a good brother and go away.”
In those short months between first having Sherlock and first losing him, John had tried hard not to think too much about what was happening between them. They had never talked about it, especially not when Sherlock was hiking up John's shirt and skidding his palms along his chest. He never questioned how Sherlock knew the spot on John’s neck that would make him shiver, or the way Sherlock kissed John and it felt like the sky was falling.
Sherlock walked over to John and trailed wet kisses down his neck.
Moriarty.
Sherlock finally joined in. “Yes, and we think—”
“Indian restaurant,” he explained before John could ask.
The plant arrived two days after Sherlock jumped.
The girl didn’t answer, just shrugged and walked away.
“OK. David. I appreciate that you want to help, but there’s nothing you can do. Really.” His voice faltered. “I’m sorry but I need to shower.” He stood and carried both empty cups to the kitchen. When he came back, the vicar was gone. On the table beside Sherlock’s chair, David had left a white card with his e-mail address and phone number. John tossed it in the bin on his way to the shower.
They’d shared a flat, a bathroom, even the same plate of pasta on occasion. John had put him to bed, rousted him from bed, Christ, he’d even made his bed a few times, but until tonight, they had never
“John, it’s Molly. Do you have a minute?”
Sherlock looked at a spot just past John’s head.
Kate almost laughed. It was like being cared for by a textbook. But she did what Sherlock said and she began to feel her heart slow. Her breathing calmed. She opened her eyes. Sherlock was studying her with what looked like actual concern.
She makes a small sound like a wounded puppy and I am apologetic. “Was she depressed?” I ask, but the damage is done and the woman (now client) wipes at her eyes and shakes her head.
that Sherlock should kiss the way he lived—hard and fast and more than a little dangerous. John’s hips moved against Sherlock’s, their erections pressed together, and Sherlock’s hands reached up and around and pulled John closer to him.
Sherlock felt like he’d been hit by a lorry while doing a gram of cocaine. He didn’t quite understand where he was.
“How are you feeling?”
“Sherlock, there’s something useful in that brain of yours, I know it. Can’t you wipe the knowledge that it’s John and reboot yourself?”
He thought about borrowing Harry’s Volvo, but then he’d have to explain where he was going and why he was going, and most importantly, why he was going alone.
He wants a chance to forgive him.
“They taught us that, too.” Kate smiled. “Make the suspect feel at ease, like you’ve got all the time in the world.”
“But why would Magnussen want to fuck with
“I need a shot. I will be happy to discuss how this works but only after a shot. I can’t think.”
it will stop feeling like
“And it’s not good. At first I thought the compound was synthetic since it didn’t match anything we’d seen before – but now I’m not sure. It looks like an aflatoxin but seems faster acting than most of the published studies I can find.”
“It seemed a prudent course of action in light of recent . . .”
“Grateful?”
She was suddenly cold, and pulled her coat tight around her. “Do you have a picture of Diorio?”
“Just watching telly.” She turned back to Kate. “You’ll not be keeping our Sherlock up too late, I hope.”
Sherlock drank. He wiggled the empty bottle at John, who took it from him and set it on the desk, and moved to his chair. Sherlock sighed and looked at Kate, who sat on the couch (which she was now beginning to think of as the balcony seats), and wished for a Diet Pepsi.
Sutton shook his head. “On your knees, Mr. Holmes. Easier to explain the forensics that way.”
“He can’t know you’re alive.”
He was looking forward to the wedding. It would be a chance to spend time with his sister, escape London, and sleep undisturbed through the night. He would miss Rosie, but Molly was right, it was only three days and he planned to make the most of it. He’d even bought a new suit for the occasion. Harry had tried to convince him to wear a kilt (
“Molly? What is it? Can’t be any worse than ‘sorry mate – you got less than a day to live.’”
He took his time with the cookies. When he was done, he brushed the crumbs carefully from his t-shirt. She could almost see the wheels turning in his head. Finally he said, “I traced Moriarty to the same government job you did. It’s reasonable to assume he was contracted to kill Peter Goodale. That’s all I know.”
“Pity that,” she grumbled. She turned to Kate. “I’ll be downstairs if you need anything.”
“There is no time to rest, John. The plan is everything.”
. Her mother loved Chrissie Hynde and Kate had grown up singing along to her music. She tried to open the playlist, but it prompted her for a four character password. Why would Sherlock protect his collection of Pretenders tracks?
There were things that John thought he knew for sure, things he’d always counted on being true. He knew that that his sister was a drunk, that tea and toast could cure most anything, that he loved Sherlock beyond all reason. And that his mother didn’t know about them.
Sherlock takes it and stares at it for a moment. His shoulders drop and he wipes a hand slowly across his face. John recognizes the gesture, it’s what Sherlock always does when he can’t think of anything to say.
like was much longer). He liked Oolong tea, coffee but never at home and never from Starbucks. He liked biscuits and expensive cologne and posh shirts. Rain storms. Most of all, he liked being the clever one in the room. John would have added his own name to the list, but most days he wasn’t completely sure about that either.
They booked a small hotel near Edinburgh for the ceremony and reception. Outdoors if it was sunny. Indoors if it wasn’t. September in Scotland was likely to be sunny
“Inspector Bryant, this is beginning to feel more like an interrogation than a consultation.”
. Secondary schools should stick to Shakespeare and Andrew Lloyd Webber. The experience put me off theatre for years.
“It’s never over,” Sherlock snapped. “There must be something we’ve missed.”
I leave him there while I go make tea and take a shower. I’m getting better at this now. At leaving him alone. I’ve finally begun to believe what I’ve been telling him for weeks. That the doctors are right. That the worst is over. That time will do the rest.
“I know. I know. More fucking tea for his fucking highness.”
According to Google, the drive from London to Dartmoor was about four hours. He and Sherlock had chosen the train last time and picked up a hired car at the station.
She took a long breath. “Moriarty had a girlfriend when he lived in Ottawa. I – we – think he recruited her there and brought her back to England with him. I think she helped him kill Goodale. I suspect she went right on working for him afterwards. Her name was Anna Ashcroft.”
“Bullshit. Three, you were wrong about the baby.”
What had Mycroft said?
He called in sick the morning of October 1. He told the new nurse he had migraine – not as far from the truth as he would have liked.
John sits in his chair. He wonders when
“Sit with him until I get back. As much I hate the idea, I should call Mycroft, let him know what’s happening. He can decide whether to tell their parents.”
“. . . if you think it’s possible.”
Three shots rang out. Sherlock opened his eyes to see Sutton pitch face first into the carpeting. He turned around to see John collapse into Bank’s arms. Sherlock kicked the gun away from Sutton and crawled back toward John.
After Chloe said yes (because there wasn’t any room for
Sherlock snorted. “Oh yes, well, something about a horse and a barn door comes to mind.”
John answers that he’s quite sure it’s all going to be marvelous. Sherlock’s fingers tap out S-O-S in Morse code against the frosted window.
“Oh, for crying out loud,” she said. “You two kissed and made up, didn’t you?”
“You will wrap up this little investigation of yours and go home. Surely there must be a miscreant moose somewhere in Canada that needs your attention.”
He stared into his glass and Kate thought he wasn’t going to answer. “Magnussen.”
“Stable. They’ll know more in a few hours. CT scan showed multiple clots in his lungs. He’s also got a serious DVT—deep vein thrombosis – in his leg and it’s throwing off clots to his lungs. His leg has probably been hurting for days but the painkillers helped mask the symptoms.” He scrubbed a hand across his face. “I’m a bloody doctor. I should have seen –”
He reached for her hand. “Jean-Guy Therrien is an inmate at Archambault Prison near Montreal. Eighteen months ago, he was two years into a ten year sentence for the sexual assault of his ex-girlfriend’s daughter when a second woman came forward and accused Therrien of assaulting her. Given the overwhelming evidence against him, he knew he would be convicted if the case went to trial. So he attempted to negotiate.”
“Don’t be melodramatic, John. No doubt I will discover the identity of your attacker in sufficient time for the doctors to—”
Sherlock wrapped his arm around John. “Why?”
Mrs. Hudson leaned over John, “Are you all right, dear?”
Half an hour later, he stood outside his house, hands deep in his pockets, staring up at the bedroom window, searching for the words he would say, and a sharp pain filled his chest – as if someone had wrapped a wire tightly around his heart and was tugging it from a great distance.
John looked at Sherlock. “What?”
"Something I’m working on,” he lied.
He smiled and she relaxed a little. “Looks like you made the cut today,” he said.
On the bright side, if you can call it that, it didn’t last very long. Three months, four if you count those first few weeks when we thought there was still a chance. I don’t know why it ended when it did, it was as if the entire world was standing on the edge of a cliff ready to jump off and then suddenly lost its nerve.  I think God finally started paying attention. Sherlock suspects he got bored and walked away. He says things like that now.
“No, but the more I agree with you, the faster you will tell me what’s really going on.”
And then his mouth is on John’s, and his hand is in his hair. They move together with a rhythm they learned years before. Sherlock tells him he loves him, but he doesn’t have to, because John already knows.
John watched them, wondering again about Sherlock’s connection to Peter Lockwood. He didn’t imagine Sherlock was given to random displays of sentimentality.  He stood and reached for his coat, folded on the seat beside him. When he turned back, the blond man (he of the £1000 suit) stopped at their pew and was looking at Sherlock like he’d seen a ghost. No, not a ghost. More like a man who’s just seen a large fish walking down Kensington Street, peering into shop windows. Impossible, but happening nonetheless.
He leans down and kisses me. I try to slow my heartbeat and I put my hands on his hips, pulling him close. He wraps his arm around me and the kisses deepen, tongues collide and I feel his heart through his chest. He used to always taste like cigarettes and whiskey. Now he tastes like beer and campfires.
“I needed to ascertain if your repeated threats to confront your wife were simply that – threats.”
He leaned down and softly kissed Sherlock. Sherlock pulled John down on his chest, whispering, “See, I feel better already.”
Sherlock to find out about Mary? If he knew how Sherlock felt about John, then he also knew what lengths Sherlock would go to in order to protect him. If Magnussen owned Mary Morstan, then he owned Sherlock too. Nice theory. But why Sherlock? Brilliant as he was, in the Holmes family it was clearly Mycroft who wielded the political power, not Sherlock. If you believed Greg, he
But he just smiles and kisses me and tells me he loves me.  As if I never knew.
“What is that?” Sherlock reached for the file.
“Simon?” John closed his eyes against the late afternoon sun that was throwing shadows across the floor. “When I dream about Helmand, he’s there. Usually running. Always two steps ahead of me, shouting back at me to move my bloody arse.”
“I always wondered what it would take for you to make the tea yourself. Good to know I can cross
Sherlock nodded, still looking up the stairs. Mrs. Hudson patted Sherlock on the back.
“I swear you’re making it up.”
“How long have you been in the RCMP?” he said. She gave him ten points for trying.
Kate sat back and started scrolling through the texts. They ran the gamut from mundane –
“Yes, sir. Queen’s Yorkshire Regiment.” He sat a little straighter when he said that.
“And make it happy. No maudlin shit,” She punched him in the arm, just the way she used to.
“I wasn’t finished.”
John was speaking, but it was hard to hear what he was saying. Sherlock’s heart was hammering in his chest and he had the strange sense that he’d been cut adrift, lost between the past and the present, between the present and the future.
I stare at myself in the small mirror over the sink and trace the lines around my eyes, the grey in my beard and I wonder what Sherlock would think if he could see me now. Does he still imagine me the way I used to be?  When he holds my face between his hands, does he catalogue the wrinkles and creases?  Does he know I limp when it rains? That I only pretend to eat what he calls his special stew?
“Is there anything I can do for you, Dr. Watson? Suicide can be very difficult –”
John waited for Greg to add the word “really” at the end. It seemed everyone did that now. As if the question wasn’t sincere without it.
“None of my business.” Surprisingly, he meant it.
“Soldier,” Sherlock finished. “Yes, we all know. And it’s not.”
Read out loud like that it sounded nothing like Chloe. She leaned forward, elbows on her knees, head in her hands. “I am an idiot.”
“Do you ever dream about Sherlock?” she said. She’d clearly waited a long time to ask that. For two months they’d pretended that Sherlock’s death wasn’t the reason he was back here.
When he woke up, in the hazy light of five am, he felt Sherlock’s back against his chest, Sherlock’s foot resting on his ankle, his hair in his face. He moved his hand up Sherlock’s back, noting the scars, the raised edges of scabs not yet healed. He lightly caressed his shoulders, his neck. Sherlock stirred, his body reacting to the touch even in sleep, moving closer.
“There was nothing to investigate. Moriarty made a clean break when he left Canada. I saw no reason to return. And there were other, more pressing matters.”
John held out the phone. “This text. It’s from Mary. She’s accepted
Although he told himself he was done, a week later he found himself back in Dr. Thompson’s office.
“Water’s fine.” Kate wiped her hands across her eyes. She looked at Sherlock. “Are you going to say anything?”
Sherlock pulled back and looked at John. “But now I need you to think about everything you know about Pearce – his time in Helmand, his associates, his habits . . .”
“Any CCTV footage from the gallery?”
“It’s not my baby, is it?”
“I am not cutting you out . . .”
He shook his head. “I live here! Don’t fucking tell me to sit down in my own flat!”
Sherlock opens the door. He’s back in his blue silk dressing gown and John’s stomach does that same flip-flop it always did. “You don’t have to knock, John.”
Jim from IT.
Two months later, he found a job with regular hours at a clinic in Holborn, and two weeks after that, a small furnished flat nearby. It was newish, the walls painted a boring beige, the furniture straight out of an IKEA advert.
“Found a body this morning. Near Tottenham Court. Guess where he worked?”
“A new friend.”
“Sherlock Holmes. Of course, of course. I thought you looked familiar. I’ve seen your website – your work is fascinating. We can talk in here.” He led him into a small office opposite the lounge.
“Don’t you
That’s when he knew for sure he must be dying.
“So what’s the deal with Sherlock Holmes?”
John walked into the kitchen, holding both bracelets in his hand. He stopped just inside the doorway as a fragment of one of those dreams came hurtling at him . . .
Sherlock wasn’t going to last much longer, and then his orgasm was just rolling through him, wave after wave, until there was nothing left.
“Was this John’s idea?”
John watched Sherlock tap his fingers impatiently against the arm of the chair. When he  hung up, Sherlock said, “And?”
“He’s not my – it’s complicated.”
“Then we can safely conclude she didn’t send the text. But this is her number?”
He was bored after John moved to Sussex with Rosie. Lonely too. So he filled his time with a series of distractions. Mastered Chinese and Japanese. Wrote a book on the forensics of British soil. Composed a violin concerto. Hacked into John’s email. Wrote long letters he never sent.
“How long?” he said.
“Are you bloody kidding me? You just said you wanted to keep me safe –“
In the bedroom, he left the light off.  He felt his way in the dark, lay down on the bed, and stared at the ceiling he couldn’t quite see. He resisted the urge to check the time again.  Less than eighteen hours ago, he’d been lying here with Sherlock . . .
Sherlock put his hand over John’s. “No scars, John.”
She stopped walking
Sherlock didn’t answer.
At the nurse’s station, after waiting ten minutes for the nurse to acknowledge she was standing there, Kate was told Sherlock had been brought to his new room downstairs directly following the scan. “Didn’t anyone tell you?” she asked, barely lifting her eyes from the screen.
He shifted in the chair, forcing her to move her hand away. “You sound like Mrs. Hudson.”
Sherlock starts humming and I throw him a dirty look. He ignores me and continues to hum. I think it’s
“I don’t ask. Mycroft and I don’t do a lot of talking.” A ghost of a smile crossed his face and she saw his cheeks colour.
He wouldn’t have gone to hospital at all if Sherlock hadn’t insisted. He’d taken one look at the dart and hurried a limping, protesting John into a cab and they headed to Barts. Molly met them at the entrance and he handed off the dart to her and led John into A&E while loudly demanding a full toxicology screen. John had just wanted to go home to bed and he would have, if he hadn’t spent the next half hour hunched over the toilet like a drunken teen-ager. That was two hours ago.
“Used to. No time lately. And my knees tend to be angry with me for days after. ” He filled her glass and grinned at her. “You’re dying to ask about him, aren’t you?”
“Is that what you call it when I solve your cases and you take the credit?” Sherlock asks.
John looked down the alley and suddenly Sherlock appeared beside him, pushing him up against the wall.  John felt the press of the bricks against his back and Sherlock’s curry-tinged breath across his face.  John didn’t move. Didn’t breathe.  Then Sherlock’s lips were on John’s and he was kissing him, his tongue in his mouth and all John could think was that he didn’t know how it happened, but he was kissing Sherlock back, and it was fierce and hot and nothing, nothing like kissing anyone else.
She wondered how long it would take him to tell Mycroft she was leaving. “You’re sure?”
Sherlock looked at the name on the folder. “Tedious.”
“Sherlock.” John let go of his hand and ran his hand down Sherlock’s chest. “You in there?”
“Thought we could both use a drink.” I pour myself three fingers.
“Should I leave?” Sherlock asked. He said it lightly, but there was a hesitation there John didn’t recognise.
“Must not know about Kate – her presence in London.” Sherlock sat up a bit straighter. “The second aspect is that you, John, must move back in with Mary.”
She shook her head. “I don’t mind staying. How is he?”
There was a silence and Kate knew he was working out an answer. “Yeah, all right,” he said finally. “Give me half an hour.”
“An hour,” and then more softly, “He’ll be back soon. Knowing your brother, he’s driving John all over London, lecturing him on the foolhardiness of chasing after Mary. I bet he actually uses the word foolhardy.”
There was no answer and Kate looked at the phone, thinking she had lost the call. “Mrs. Ashcroft?”
A shadow crossed his face. “I always hoped I was reason enough. I miscalculated. ” He cleared his throat and continued. “No matter how much he protests otherwise, he is still tied to Mary. I have little experience in this area, but I’m not naïve enough to believe that he never loved her, that part of him still doesn’t love her. And John has a strong sense of duty, of responsibility. To Mary and the child.”
"What was that? It’s beautiful," John asked when he was done, coming over and leaning his hands on the back of Sherlock’s chair. Sherlock played the first part again, feeling John's knuckles against his shoulder and watching his reflection in the window.
“Yes.  His former cellmate – Paul Diorio – had boasted to Therrien that he’d killed a girl and gotten away with it.”
She threw up her hands. “Oh, for Christ’s sake – it’s already made, you might as well drink it.”
was written on the inside. How in hell did this end up here? He always kept it in his wallet. As a reminder to never, ever get as drunk as he had that weekend. The weekend he couldn’t remember with the exception of a few strange dreams.
“I don’t understand.”
She’d achieved everything she’d come to London for – she’d found enough evidence to make an arrest in Peter Goodale’s murder, solved the mystery of Anna Ashcroft’s disappearance, and even extracted a promise from Sherlock to take on Sarah’s case. Most surprising, she had a girlfriend waiting in Montreal who was not only speaking to her, but throwing around the L word. Maybe the engagement ring wouldn’t end up on Craigslist after all. All that was missing was a bright red bow to tie it all together.
Sherlock slid his hand down John’s chest, reveling in the feel, the smell, the familiar of John. His John. This life. Their life. Together.
She shook her head. “Inmates talk. Maybe he heard about it from someone else. It was all over the news.”
Outside the restaurant, Sherlock said, “I need to walk.” He started down the street, then stopped and turned. “Aren’t you coming?”
