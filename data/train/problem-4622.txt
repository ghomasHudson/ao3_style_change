"That's my line!", Castiel shouted back. Now he stood in front of the naga, guarding her. "Don't do this! She's just a girl, goddamnit."
"There's a first time for everything", Dean voiced one of his mottos. He bent down to the bucket and the sponge, his Baby still wasn't clean. A loud wet sound and a little squeak as he began to wash the windshield.
Light wormed through the curtains, now the pattern of purple and orange circles visible but Castiel didn't look. Instead his eyes fixated on the page, the words of the Liber Confidebat made his body shiver in cold. Yes, he had seen this before, had known pairs like this in the past, but never thought he'd be the subject himself. Now was too late. The Bond between a witch and a familiar wasn't to be broken.
At the same time all these thoughts and pictures, some his and some Cas's, were burying him. An earthfall of images and feelings he couldn't fight against, sometimes tearing him up in cursing or crying or laughing. He wanted to hit something, preferably this magical bond that was fucking everything up, but the vast country had nothing to offer but some trees. Which he parked his car at and tried it, fists and tree bark colliding, pain erupting. Only thing he earned were bloody splinters in his bloody knuckles, not worth it. Neither did it elevate the strain that was tearing at him, nor did the bond magically go away. A courtesy magic didn't know.
Bashful Dean looked down at the oil-stained rag in his hands, his fingers suddenly nervous fiddled with it. "Maybe you shouldn't."
Gently she stroked through his hair. "You're not happy", she continued in a soft voice, hard to understand. "You're not loved. You're not respected. You deserve better."
Dean was pacing through his shop, frustrated with the obvious right thing he should do and the very wrong thing he desperately wanted to do. "Fuck", he cursed and screwed his eyes shut, fists shaking.
A thoughtful nod. "I received your message but … I was under the impression you liked the time we spent with each other as well, so I was worried you were in some kind of distress. I am your guardian angel after all."
Good, Cas thinks. What a shame it would be for such a child to never meet his namesake. As it is, the child has enough of a shadow to grow up in. Cas wonders if Sam will ever stop thinking of his brother when he says his son’s name. He wonders if any of them— Jody and Claire, Bobby and Charlie and Garth, any of them— ever will.
“I owe you,” Kelly insists. “For raising my son. So I promise you this. Whenever you leave, for however long you’re gone, Jack will always be safe with me. I’ll keep him good.”
Cas looks around. Angels used to fill these halls, and now they’re empty. The doors are all sealed, glowing with Heaven’s light, but the longer he looks the more cracks Castiel sees in the foundations.
“And you lied to my face and stabbed me in the back,” Amara says. She holds up a hand to stop him from responding. Blue lights burst around them, and Heaven quakes once more, nearly tossing Castiel to the ground. Amara stands steady, and after a brief wobble so does Jack. Amara’s voice is measured and level. “Why didn’t you kill my brother?”
. Claire plugs it into the machine and hits play. The guitar comes in loud, making everybody turn their heads. Immigrant Song. Kaia smiles, and Claire slips away, laughing, to pull her in by the waist and plant a kiss on her cheek. They giggle into each other.
Dean thinks about that. He opens another beer for himself. Bottle caps collect like a little mountain in the middle of the table, and Dean’s head is light and floating with drink. The beer tastes like researching cases in motel rooms, Cas flitting in and out as he pleases. Days that were behind them, and behind Sam. The family business, generations of hunting Campbells and Winchesters, over.
“That’s not a good idea, Jack,” Castiel interjects, having been there himself. How odd that such horrors were in his past now. Too far away to haunt him. “Believe me.” Jack nods, and doesn’t press it.
When they leave, Amara looks glad to be back in the open air, the wind dragging at her hair like it’s trying to pull her away into the universe. Jack and Kelly wander around the Garden. They drift off from here and there, distracted by the look of the flowers in the dusk, but they always come back to each other.
Sam looks the same age as he did the last time Cas saw him, holding a brand new baby and still mourning. The reading glasses are gone, but otherwise it could have been yesterday. But he carries time in him, in the weariness of his eyes. He’s dressed in a much younger man’s clothes, layers upon layers. Castiel’s never met another human who wears as many layers as the Winchesters do.
“On Earth right now,” Cas reported. He could feel it, the same way he could feel the Earth turn on its axis and the summer begin to peel away into autumn. It was a little lifeline of a heartbeat, strung along a clothesline up to the heavens. “Somebody is thinking about us.”
“I don’t know if it was the right choice,” Jack tells Castiel as they watch the boys climb into the Impala and roll all the windows down. The Impala purrs. Cas thinks about all the times Dean talked to it like it was alive, running a hand along the car’s length and smiling.
The map table is turned off. The alcove with the strange telescope is dark. The kitchen is empty. Somebody, presumably Sam, had made sure to take all the perishable food with him. Pots are scrubbed and tucked away into their places, and every surface was swiped clean sometime before the dust arrived. There isn’t a spare crumb or empty beer can anywhere. It would be just like Sam to clean up well and leave no trace.
“You look well,” Cas offers. Amara looks at him, her gaze piercing. There’s a depth to her eyes unlike anything Cas has ever seen, and it takes everything in him not to look away.
When Sam bursts out of the house it’s sleepy-eyed with a machete in hand, old dangers more familiar than new peace. But as soon as he sees Eileen, his mouth drops. The machete slips out of his hand and clunks against the porch.
Dean stands on the porch, watching. He’s never, in his whole life and death, seen Sam so happy. Three people— ages apart and dying at different times, running into each other in Paradise the ways days span years and decades— three people that fit into each other’s lives like they’d be incomplete without them. This is what he died for, Dean thinks. For Sam to have this. So why does he feel so gutted?
“You’ve got this,” he had told Olga, going for a jovial tone. “Go get ‘em.” Cas never knows how to talk to Jack’s former-human angels. Olga just blinked at him.
Jack nods, and turns away from Castiel. Going to the edge of the Garden, he waves a hand, and before their eyes one of the trees begins to sprout great bean pods that swell until they’re bigger than fists. They drop, mottled green and red and yellow, and Jack raises his hand again. They split open, revealing the white, fleshy seeds inside.
Charlie strolls into the house like she’s lived there all her life, the same way she strolled into the bunker time and again. She looks around, then goes straight for the kitchen, and starts pulling mugs out of the cupboards. She doesn’t even ask before she flips the kettle on— it’s an electric thing. Sam likes tea now. One of the side effects of living long and dying an old man.
The river’s running fast today, stumbling over the rocks in a rush to get somewhere. If Dean followed the river for a hundred days and nights, where would it take him? Would he meet anybody along the way? Or just wander in a circle until he stumbled onto Bobby’s place, or the Roadhouse, or Charlie’s lair? “Hey, kid,” Dean offers, which is maybe not the best way to open a prayer. But he hopes Jack won’t mind. “I heard that you’re running the Matrix now.” He tosses a rock into the river. “I hear you built this whole place from scratch.”
and Dean wasn’t there to speak at the wedding. “It took a while to find, but Eileen really wanted a front porch. We bounced around awhile and ended up settling near Garth.” He looks at Dean. “His kids babysat ours.”
Paradise is new. There is no remnant of the old that came before. And in the sky, the broad noon o’clock sky, hang a couple stars— the last fragments of Heaven. One by one, they wink out. And the last one seems to wave before it goes.
Cas considers doing the same to Eileen, carving runes into her ribs to keep them all doubly safe. But he doesn’t. Aside from the panic it would cause them, it’s just different. Eileen can take care of herself, and she and Sam can take care of each other. But keeping their son safe— this is something Cas can offer them. One last thing he can do for them. One prayer he can answer.
Dean shakes his head. “The only place I really had was the bunker, but I guess it never made itself up here. I’m looking for another option.”
“We’ll run into each other sometime,” Dean assures Bobby when he asks about it. They fish together in quiet, the river ahead of them. Sometimes when they fish they never catch anything, just sit together in the quiet until the night falls and the moon’s lit up every gray hair in Bobby’s beard. Dean never gets tired of staring at Bobby, whole and shining in a glowing world. He thinks about the darkness of Earth— here even the nights glow with stars and a too-full moon and the essence of small memories, like fireworks with Sam when they were kids or a set of barn doors flying open in the black night. “He’s around, right?” Dean continues, talking about Cas. Cas, alive and walking around Heaven like a traveller. “Helping out Jack?” To that, Bobby shrugs like it’s not his business. And they go back to fishing. “He’s out there,” Dean says again. It’s a big, new world out there, he tells himself. Cas will turn up eventually. And they have time, after all.
And then Dean wants to kick himself, and tosses that thought up like a prayer as well. It’s his own fault, his own fault that he’s here alone, with nothing to show for it. His own fault that all his life nobody loved him enough not to leave him.
Jack’s carrying his power well these days. Paradise is tuned in to his every thought and need, and he moves through it like he was born to it. He gets better at judging souls, learns not to blink when he casts them down.
And the quiet breath of a response. Dean’s rumbling, unmistakable voice punctuated with the hint of a cracking. Like the breath it took to say them had gotten trapped in his throat:
It twangs and rumbles, and that love song comes through as steady as the eternal buzzing of honeybees. Not for the first time, Cas wonders what Dean was thinking when he put the mixtape together. How much did he think about the order of the songs? The way they fade into each? More of them are love songs than not. About having love. About losing love. About missing love when it’s right in front of your eyes. But the whole thing opens with Immigrant Song, so he can’t be sure. And after all, every time he thinks he understands Dean, the man proves him wrong. What luck to love such a curious man.
“Hello, Cas,” Jack offers, his hand sneaking up into its usual half-wave. He looks different, but he smiles. “How are you feeling?”
“I missed you, too,” Charlie says. She looks around. “Where’s Sam? Don’t tell me he’s hiding from me.”
“Yes, Jack,” Castiel decides. Maybe it’s true what they had said about him so many years ago. Maybe too much heart was always Castiel’s problem. He nods to his son, whose uncertainty falls away from his face. “I think so.”
Dean’s prayer is faint at first, and Cas almost doesn’t hear it. It’s Dean turning and walking and walking. It’s not even properly directed at Cas. But whenever Dean feels alone his thoughts always stray back to Cas. It’s raining in his corner of Paradise, and the wind is picking up.
There’s art on every wall, and photos. Dozens of photos— Sam and Eileen, their wedding, Eileen beaming and pregnant, Sam in sweatpants in a hospital room holding a tiny baby in his enormous hands. Then family photos, the three of them with the baby on Sam’s shoulders and in Eileen’s lap and signing to each other at the dinner table. Smiles like sunbeams. A grown kid with dark hair, grinning and holding up a diploma— it reads
“It’s mine, then,” Dean said. He turned over in their bed and the moonlight found them. They had hung up as many photographs and posters and art prints as they could think to hunt down. They had no rhyme or reason for their design, except for Dean’s love of music and Cas’s love of Dean. At just the right time of night, moonlight lit up the far wall and the silhouette of their bodies in bed together. “It’s my Paradise—”
Then Sam is there. And without needing to see or be told, Dean just knows. Cas can hear the smile blooming on his face.
“—it’s my Paradise,” Dean said. He had picked out these sheets with Cas and built the bedframe himself in this house that they shared. In the morning, he would make coffee and sit across from Cas at the kitchen table. “And I want you to be happy.”
She thumbs through a mismatched collection. Sam loves music, Cas knows, but there’s a collection of cassette tapes with familiar labels. Metallica, Black Sabbath, AC/DC, and the familiar Led Zeppelin. Dean’s tapes. Not quite to Sam’s taste, but there isn’t a speck of dust on them. And when Claire pops open the cassette player, it’s a Nazareth tape that comes out. Sam still listens to all Dean’s music.
Outside, the sun is coming up somewhere behind the heavy clouds. The world is lit up gray and white. Snow is falling on Christmas morning.
It’s morning and the dew is still clinging to every blade of grass outside Sam’s place. The cicadas are buzzing up a raucous East Coast kind of noise. It’s warm already. The day promises to get hotter. Sam’s already gone on a run along the river today, and Dean can’t believe that even in Paradise the kid runs for fun. Dean made him eggs.
“I guess I’m just always waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Cas says. It sounds like something that Dean would say.
“Yeah,” Charlie says, peering at him with her head crooked ever so slightly to the side. “I hear that was your angel’s idea.” Her eyes sparkle with something unsaid. She sprinkles powder into two mugs— they’re from Yellowstone and Yosemite, part of a National Park collection set. Looking past Charlie into the open cupboards, Dean sees Sam has a whole bunch of them from across the country. Maine to Montana to Arizona to Florida. Maybe they drove there in the Impala, he and Eileen and little Dean packed in together. Charlie continues: “And then the new God— your Jack— he built this place from the ground up.”
It’s the same kind of love song as sharks hum to each other in the depths. As vultures, clashing with talons outstretched in thin air, screech at each other. A vicious kind of love song that’s all howling wind and the taste of copper pennies and too-harsh sunshine. Castiel can’t explain why he hears it in a Zeppelin song. But it chills him like the song itself is marching down his back. He plays the cassette tape over and over. Maybe he’s coming around to Zeppelin.
“Bringing them together so soon,” Jack clarifies. “Making this feel like just an hour for Dean. I thought Dean needed Sam to be happy. But I don’t know if he should have had some time to be happy without Sam first.” He looks at his father. And he’s Jack again, all too focused on this moment and earning a furrow in his brow for the trouble of it. “What do you think?”
“She grew up well,” Sam says, nodding at it. “Dean loved her, and she stayed on our couch all the time between hunts. She must still be out there somewhere.”
.” His thoughts are interrupted with other things. Sam. A house they’re sharing, for now. Working on the Impala. How good it would be to have Jack there with them. Smiling Jack. Like a son. “
Castiel stands over the crib. There’s a baby monitor tucked in the corner, and a mobile hanging over it with a plastic solar system. There’s no way the baby could know that amulets are tucked inside each little planet. The baby is fast asleep. He looks like Sam. He’s hearing, too. But there’s Eileen in the baby’s nose and eyebrows, the shape of her lips. And for all that he’s named for his uncle, he doesn’t look like Dean at all.
Jack wants to tear down Heaven. Around them, it’s already crumbling. It’s half ruins, half autopilot— a ghost ship with less than a bare bones crew. It’s time to put it to rest, Jack explained. And even though he knows his son is right, there’s a fist-sized aching in Cas’s chest. Heaven was his home, once. Long ago, when there was nothing in his world but blind faith and an army of brothers and sisters.
“How about we just stay down here for the rest of the day. Have dinner with Beckett.” Castiel looked around Dean and smiled at his niece. “Then” He said moving close to Dean’s ear, but not lowering his voice nearly enough “we can go upstairs to bed and I’ll give you a big-”
Dean had such an odd pull towards Cas, he wanted to scent him and feel his smooth skin on his own. Dean’s body temperature stayed rather high even when his urge to mate was at bay. His heat wasn’t as bad as he had imagined it to be. Dean had about three unbearable points throughout the day but other than that he just craved Cas. Not sexually, he craved his smell and voice and contact. it was an odd need, and Dean tried to deny the feeling but he gave in and spent the nights in Castiel’s bed. It wasn’t until his temperature dropped rather low that he wasn’t just with Castiel for scenting and comfort, but warmth. It was an annoying part of heat, it was meant to be a bonding experience but Dean just felt like he wanted to bury himself as close to Castiel as possible and maybe yell at him again for doing this to him.
Dean knew this really wasn’t taking control but it was nice, he didn’t like telling Castiel what to do, he loved when Cas showed him what he liked.
"I've always wondered what in hell that was about. To train Dean, he was always so damn tired from school and all those hours. Never felt like I got the whole story behind it."
"Jesus boys settle down," Ellen rolled her eyes and followed Mary out to her old blue civic. Shopping didn't take long but they normally grab some coffee and take some quiet time together. Once they made it into the car Mary collapsed her head into the steering wheel.
After he washes himself and the shower down he douses the bathroom in air freshener and cracked both windows over his and Castiel's bed.  Hopefully ridding the room of that alpha smell also. It was odd, Dean didn't hate Cas he just didn't care to be around a Novak alpha. That lead to an awkward living situation, like sleeping with a stranger.
Castiel let out a moan as he dug deeper, his nose pressing on his perineum that made Dean yelp something beautiful.
"He didn't knot me, Cas." Relief flooded Castiel but he still pulled of Dean’s pants. Revealing a raw patch of skin on Dean's left thigh. Castiel knew what it was from, Gabriel came home a few times with them when his brothers ditched him. His brother called them rut burns, when the omega fought too hard sometimes they just rubbed them raw and then jump them to knot them when they gave in.
We need to talk is never a good thing to hear. What could Dean possibly need to tell him? He had been distant for the past few day so Cas knew something was up. Would he want to end it? Was it something Castiel did?
“You know how classy I am, next stop is Chucky Cheese if you’re really good.” Dean joked to go and take another bite of pie. There was only a short burst of silence before Castiel slid closer to Dean and stuck his finger right into the middle of his pie. “My pie!” Dean almost squeaked out. Castiel drew his finger out and with it came the sugary sweet inside of his apple pie. Small sprinkles of cinnamon clung to his finger and Dean watched his eyes like a hawk. Nearly whimpering when Castiel placed his finger onto his tongue and sucked it clean.
Dean would be lying if he said he didn't feel the slightest connection to her, but there is a line between being an omega and having ice powers. Beckett was sprawled across the floor in front of the television soaking in every word from the story. It made Dean smile, thinking about one day seeing his own pup do the same.
“Thank you.” Dean said clapping Balthazar on the back. Balth smiled rejoining his mate who was preparing the candles in the cake. Dean watched fondly as Gabe placed the candles into the white frosting. Balthazar snuck up behind him snaking his arms around his stomach and placing a kiss behind his ear. He could really get used to a family with these guys. He really could.
“That’s good to know.” Dean laughed nervously and bit the inside of his cheek as he was lead into a grand kitchen. Vaulted ceilings and a burt sunflower yellow for the walls stainless steel appliances and dark granite counters. It was a kitchen to die for and Dean had a sudden urge to cook. The rest of Castiel's family was gathered around the island chatting, it was still early but it seemed everyone here was already dressed for the day. Looking at everyone he felt uncomfortable and the voice in his head was telling him to run.
"Okay, tell me if this gets uncomfortable for you." Dean nodded and Castiel stepped forward. His shirt hung unbuttoned on Dean’s body and he had yet to pull on the t shirt. Moving in he nuzzles at Dean’s neck and rubbed his wrist over his chest marking him as 'taken'. Deans skin felt so hot against his lips and the smell was intoxicating. Small moans left Deans lips as he pushed into Castiel. Dean maneuvered himself so Castiel's thigh slotted between his legs. He pushed himself on the alpha and scented his neck and nuzzled his chest. Lightly he pressed his erection into Castiel's thigh and started to lightly rub against him. Castiel responded by nipping and licking at Dean’s throat. Guiding the scent glands on his wrist across Dean’s chest and around grabbing his ass and pushing Dean harder into his leg.
"You look nice, the doc had me terrified." Making his way quickly to his mate he placed a kiss on her cheek and looked down at his son.
“Baby, please come on talk to me, I’m right here.” Dean shook his shoulders trying to rouse him from his trance. Dean’s breathing was becoming erratic and his vision became blurred with hot tears that were streaking his face. He had to call someone, anyone, but he had no idea where he even was. He started patting down Castiel’s pockets praying he took his phone with him. Before he even had time to slide it out of his pocket sirens could be heard in the distance. Dean snapped his head up. “I will be back, don’t you fucking die on me.” His voice wavered and his throat tightened. The sirens were getting closer and Dean scrambled through the tall grass into the middle of the road. Waving his arms in the air and shouting. His voice was so horse and worn.
Dean quirked an eyebrow looking at Cas and mouthing 'Clarence?' Castiel quickly flinched from her too familiar touch and bumped shoulders with Dean, then quickly reeled away from him. Dean took notice of Castiel’s odd closed off reaction but pushed it to the back of his mind. Anna’s face was twisted into an annoyed glare at her mother and Naomi made eye contact with Castiel, like she was daring him to challenge her.
“And where is his?” The tattooed beta asked, funny how fast they made enemies. Dean was at a complete loss of words and stuttered.
“Is there anyone else here?” The beta asked approaching them, she spoke softly as to not fluster Dean who was already in a very compromised state.
Castiel would become a Winchester and join Dean’s pack. A long time ago an omega would leave to live with their alpha’s pack, now a day’s people have become a little more flexible. It was still somewhat odd for an alpha to leave their pack but it wasn’t unheard of.
Dean pulled a three point turn in their excessively large driveway and started the long wind down the road. The sound of the impala was a small comfort to Dean but the smell of distress still floated around his nose. Dean had replayed the past few days over in his head over a hundred times and he still has no idea what he did to hurt Castiel so badly.
"Yes, it will at least be a little less appealing to other alphas. Not all, but some." Dean looked at him with confused eyes his mouth hung open.
"No problem." She hung up mid laugh and Dean dropped his phone. He still felt antsy, he couldn't really talk about Cas to Jo since she couldn't know about them. Dean decided the internet was the best answer. Quickly pulling out his laptop he pushed himself up to the headboard of his- technically Cas’- bed. Pressing the on button he waited for it to start up, Dean was mindlessly clicking and tapping keys and humming a Kansas song. Once his screen lit up he heard a small chime before his desktop icon popped up. Clicking it his background changed to two woman half dressed in latex, one was a cop and the other a robber. Officer had the other woman cuffed and bent over in front of her. Dean ignored it and opened up google.
Castiel was going mad at every clench of Dean’s muscles as he rose off his cock, the look of his body moving so perfectly in a fluid motion of riding him. Dean’s cock was bobbing with every movement of grinding. The mirror in front of them made it oddly intimate as they made eye contact every few times.
"Mmm, Dean you are amazing. I could stay buried in you forever." Castiel lowered down to trail kisses across his shoulders.
"Dean, hey wake up. Please Dean open your eyes for me." Cracking his eyes open he looks up at the blue eyed alpha.
“Dean, wake up.” Again Castiel shook his shoulder hoping Dean wouldn’t react negatively to Castiel’s reappearance. Dean opened his puffy red eyes, the green in them stood bright against the irritated whites and it took him a few seconds to study Cas.
"I'm being followed." He let out quietly as if to make sure no one overheard. "Ever since the library and Crowley, I feel like someone is watching every damn step I take."
"You weren't upset I slept with someone else?" Dean raised his eyebrow surprised at Cas' words. "But, dude I said I slept with someone a few weeks ago!" Castiel tensed again
"Is this breaking the rules?" He chose his words carefully. The real question was "Is this a date?" But he didn't want to just come out and ask that. Dean thought for a second.
“Don’t talk to me like that, boy.” At that Dean hauled Castiel up from the ground and lead him inside acting as his crutch, even though Castiel could have walked on his own. "Hey alpha learn to take charge! Bitch's don't call the shots." Dean didn't respond but he felt Castiel clench in anger. What they could hear was Jo bravely mouthing off to John asking how Mary would kick his stupid ass if she heard him.
“Dean-” Dean turned to Castiel he was sitting up with his knees to his chest covering his face with his hands. Dean dropped everything and bounded back for the bed. He took Castiel’s hands from his eyes. He was crying.
“Now if the breeding is successful and an egg or eggs are fertilized then the hormonal makeup of both parents changes.” Dean’s eyes go wide.
Dean straddle Castiel’s hips and pushed their dick’s together, wraping his fingers around them he slowly dragged forward. Sliding over the crown of Castiel’s cock, he let out a low growl and captured Dean’s lips. They exchanged small whimpers and moans as Dean dragged his thumb over their heads.
“Well, I hope y’all are hungry because my special french toast is done and ready to fix all your problems. Get John’s ass in here, no one can be mad with a mouth full of these.” She smiled and placed a large plate piled high with the most delicious looking breakfast out there. Light fluffy toast with small sticky lines of syrup dripping down the pile and sprinkled with powdered sugar. She was right, no one could be mad when eating this.
“Well, Gabriel has me as he godfather even though he probably has no idea what that means. She is one of the happiest little girls out there but won't hesitate to fight. Even though a five year old can only do so much damage. She has strawberry blonde hair and curls. She likes to climb around outside and piss off her uncles. She is very attuned to everything around her and picks up on things that are far beyond her time. She likes jokes and favors omegas, I have a feeling she will be studying omega rights when she is older.”
"What wrong buddy? Can't satisfy your bitch? Heh, I wouldn't mind lending a knot." Castiel felt rage bubble under his skin, nails and teeth sharpening and eyes turning a dark gold. He bolted at the first son of a bitch he saw. Slamming them into the wall on the other side of the hall. A snarl ripped from his throat and baring his teeth he dug his nails into the other alpha.
"Oh, I like to think it's because my perky nipples." Dean laughed at his own joke and he could practically hear Cas' eyes rolling.
“Alright, get up, same rules.” Cas got up and tried collecting himself, any damaged sustained from the fight quickly healed. Minor injuries healed almost instantly, other took a little longer if severe enough, like Dean’s.
Castiel took a little longer to get back to his dorm than usual. His mind was running a thousand miles an hour and he couldn't bring his feet to move faster. He knew he couldn't push it off forever, he was leaving early tomorrow morning and if Dean was ending it he would need an escape. He just prayed that wasn't the case.
That's what he was in this position, bent over and begging. Castiel wasn't his mate, hell they weren't even supposed to be having sex out of cycle. But that rule was screwed to hell almost as fast as it was made. This sex was different, Dean didn't know if he liked it...it wasn't as good as the other kind but a part if him that was pushed deep down was singing with joy. Dean ground his teeth together, he was in an omegas body but he had the mind of an alpha and he won't be bent over.
"Damnit!" Castiel breathed. He hated leaving things off on a bad note. He had an urge to go after Dean, but he knew that would only piss him off more. Castiel was going to be smarter than that and waited, almost trying to push his alpha senses out and feel for Dean but it was useless. He had no idea what that long-distance connection was about. To him, it was a load of shit. He sometimes worried that they weren’t bonded enough to have that connection but that was silly, he was in love with Dean. They were fully mated so maybe the bond took a little longer to form for them. "God Dean, sometimes I wanna kick your ass." Knowing he would have a lot of waiting to do he grabbed his book and intentionally ignores his work in a way to spite Dean. But that was useless and would only hurt his grade in the end.
"Yeah, sure. Well, I gotta go, Sammy. Need to let Cas know I wasn't kicked out of my pack because hell if we are going back to his. Man, they are nasty sons a bitches." Sam let out a laugh.
“I can’t believe you just came saying the word groceries,” Dean laughed, securely tied to Castiel as the alpha kissed and licked over his mating mark and gave a chuckle. “Oh yeah, I also need more suppressants.”
He took the steps two at a time and shoved his key into the lock, thank the absent gods he was alone. Stripping down he turned the shower on and jumped in. Dean gasped at how the ice water bit at his skin and paralyzed his ability to breath. His skin finally cooled off enough for him to jump out after a quick rubdown with soap. He wanted to get out before Cas got back so he threw on a clean pair of pajamas and opened the window over his bed and tried some deep breathing. He decided to spend the rest of the day at home. He only got through about three ACDC songs until Castiel was back. Dean was clenching his fists and praying that the room smelt normal. Of course the look of confusion on his face meant Dean still stunk up the room with his assortment of omega smells.
Castiel pulled away from Anna and turned back to look at Dean. He was fidgeting awkwardly, the smell of multiple alpha’s was rolling out the door and it made Dean uneasy.
“Damnit, Cas this is exactly why we don’t have nice things,” Dean patted Castiel back unable to be truly mad at him since this was his Rut and Castiel didn’t complain about Dean’s heat that happens much more often. “You just end up humping everything.”
“You need to tell me what happened, why were you in the woods?” Castiel ran his hands through Dean’s hair, rubbing soothing circles on his temple. Dean sighed, like the thought of talking was too much. “I’ll clean you up as you tell me, then I’ll let you sleep.” Dean gave a slight nod as Castiel stood up to grab his first aid kit and a wet washcloth. As Castiel disappeared Dean looked at the flaking ceiling. What did happen? Alistair got the jump on him, Dean wasn’t made of glass and he knew how to take on an alpha. He was just distracted and injured, maybe it was time he brushed up on his fighting skills.
Anyway I hope you liked the chapter and comments are ALWAYS welcome. They would probably brighten up my days a lot.
"Wait so you're really coming in then? With this new man of yours?" Sam was back to excited at the thought of seeing his brother again.
"Hey, Sammy." Dean chuckled already getting off to an awkward start, but Damn he missed his brother.
"Yeah, Dean sure what do you need?" Dean took in a deep breath, say it now, say it fast it or don't say it at all.
He pushes his back flush against the wall and slowly slides down to the warm tile floor. He spreads his legs wide and starts stroking his cock, the tip is red and beads of precome are being washed away by the splash of warm water. He takes his other hand and lowers it to his slicked up ass and starts to push in with one finger. The first ring of muscle is tight but he slides in nicely. Nice enough to add a second. He starts fucking himself back on his hand. The shower is filled with his panting and the smell of sweet omega slick. Dean leans his head back and starts to whine. He adds a third finger and starts to pump his cock harder. His stomach tightens like a spring ready to snap and release his muscles into pulsing ecstasy. He can taste the orgasm on his tongue as he circles the head of his cock with an eager thumb and strokes down his shaft. It's like a countdown to a rocket blastoff and with one last pull of his cock he comes all over his stomach. His ass pulsing around his slick covered fingers. He feels more slick leak out from his mind blowing orgasm. His mind is thrumming and he can't manage to catch his breath.
“Stupid alpha, the air freshener was to hide my smell, and I was trying to be an asshole so you would switch roommates. I mean you do smell weird, not bad but you change scents all the time! It’s always honey mix with, well right now it’s...Lavender?”
"Funny story." Dean starts but bolts for the door and is followed by Cas as they slip between the two men and haul ass out of the building. Stopping once they are a good distance away.
"Castiel," John called. He didn't move for a second and looked over at Dean who looked as confused as him. "You heard me boy let's go!" Castiel waited a second more and then slowly walked over to stand next to John. The rest of the teams were chosen and Dean found himself with Bobby.
Finally, Dean saw the machine, he pulled out his dollar and stuck it in the slot. He pressed the first soda he saw and coke dropped out. Waiting to open it until he got his books and made it back to his seat.
Dean was leaning back in his desk chair chewing a piece of gum rather loudly. Castiel looked up from his book across from the room and glared daggers at the omega. Living together became a little harder now that they were somewhat mated, it was an odd feeling Castiel had. Like he was fighting a war with his instincts. Don’t touch Dean, don’t kiss him, don’t show affection unless he shows it first. He still felt guilty even though Dean seemed to forgiven him. He didn’t want his inner alpha to overstep the line again, this was all on Dean’s terms.
"You have no idea how he will present! He is four, John! He isn't a man he is a little boy who misses his father."
So Castiel was very surprised to come back to their dorm and find Dean sitting in a zip-up and basketball shorts. A deck of cards was sitting in front of him and he had a smirk on his lips.
“Well look who dragged their ass out of bed to see us?” A very familiar face looked at him from the porch with a smile, straight blonde hair and bright eyes, Jo welcomed them and she made her way down the steps. Her normal t-shirt, jean, boot attire on and Dean welcomed her into a hug.
Crowley’s scent was much stronger in these parts like he frequented this area a lot. He wondered how many poor omegas were dragged here against their will, or if Dean was just a sick fantasy of his.
"You think something else was happening?" Ellen lost her soothing voice and was going into more of a shocked undertone. "Like-"
Walking on his own down the lot, hands stuffed into a large winter overcoat even though it was clearly spring weather. As Dean drove past Crowley raised a hand and gave him a half-wave. Dean only returned a nod and pressed a little harder on the gas.
His nurse called him back quickly and her name tag read Brandi. It started off with a blood draw so the test could be run while the rest of his physical went.
"Alistair" Dean pants as he scurries to his feet. Picking his bag off the ground and slinging it over his shoulder.
“It’s called the weather channel app, smartass.” Dean walked over towards Cas. “Now let’s go.” He pulled his books he left on Castiel’s desk and they both exited the room. They walked quietly through the lounge, receiving a few looks from some of the alphas there. Dean still smelt like alpha and sex so he was attracting a little more attention from wandering eyes. Nothing threatening especially since he was clearly claimed.
“Hey boys come on over here!” An overly excited blonde waved at them, “join our little sharing circle!” Dean tensed and cursed at himself for being seen. The fake mates exchanged awkward glances at each other and slowly made their way over.
"Soon, give me five minutes." Dean groaned into the phone and Cas wondered how messed up Dean was. How could this be his first heat? He's twenty two, if it is it must be one hell of a ride.
“You hated the guy! You wanted to switch rooms with him and now you’re fucking?” Her eyes were wide with so many questions that Dean knew he would have to answer. Castiel was just a bystander and enjoyed the exchange of conversation between Dean’s dearest friend.
"Dean?" Castiel asked as if he did something wrong. And his breath halted as he thought back to what he had done, did Dean not consent to this? He could have sworn he was in good control of himself.
Dean lifted his arms behind them and tangled his hands in Castiel's hair and clung to the nap of his neck. He changed up the rhythm and started moving his body in a wave motion and worked his stomach as if he was grinding down on Castiel who let out a choked cry at the unexpected change. Cas' grip tightened on Dean's thighs and the omega hummed at the joy of the power he had over Cas who was putty in his hands. It was perfect, no one was truly dominant in this position as they shared equal pleaser due to the other.
"Mine." Castiel growled again pushing himself into Dean's neck to place the winning bite on him, his teeth were slowly going back but he was still gentle, still completely Castiel. Cas took it farther by liking up Dean's jaw line and placing a hand on his cheek. It was very intimate for someone in alpha mode, but Castiel was not like any other alpha. He was Dean's alpha...at least until the end of the year.  Dean rolled his hips forward into Castiel's and the alpha froze lifting himself above the omega. Eyes still a dark gold that searched his face frantically. It wasn't until Dean rolled his hip again with a whimper he didn't mean to make that told Castiel to continued. His teeth began to sharpen again and Dean had such an odd pull to bear his neck. Submit, beg for his alpha.
"We worry about you", Castiel said, leaning forward in his chair and reaching out to him. Hand stopping midair. "You don't need to do this." A pained look on his face.
Violently Dean shook his head. "No!", he yelled, a tone of refusal. "You're a monster!" He loved Castiel, even when he betrayed him so maliciously.
"I'm not your buddy", Cas answered, blocking the door with his body, "Neither is he. He'll hurt you."
Instead of this discovery feeling good, feeling like an invitation to cuddle and whisper in the night, perhaps to fill the room with a little more moaning and pleasure, instead Castiel felt hollow. They laid here skin to skin but not close. Heck, they had touched deeper than that, yet this shallow gesture was too much. Dean's body radiated warmth but it only raised goosebumps with Castiel, cold making his limbs twitch. A knowledge not new raised to the forefront of his mind: Dean was here for selfish reasons.
Slowly Dean opened his heavy eyes and saw his lover's sorrowful face. Did he know? Could he see, how weak Dean had been? He bit back the burning in his eyes and stood up. "What are you doing here?"
Dean downed the last of his beer, half the bottle, also eerily similar to that night. A night he had spent in a bar similar to this, had drunk a beer similar to this and a cheesy song had played in the back similar to this. To be fair, Dean spent most of his nights like this. They often ended similar as well, with him flirting his way into someone else's pants.
Dean sighed, regret formed on his lips. "I know." Otherwise this betrayal wouldn't hurt like hell. Love made everything worse.
Humming along with the song Dean knelt at the side of Baby and ran the sponge over the rim of one of the tires. He felt a little exposed and a little silly in these jeans shorts, but also a little sexy and a little whimsical. His own backyard could handle it well enough.
The trench coat and suit looked comically out of place in here. A concentrative furrow on Castiel's face while he maneuvered the cue. Shooting. The tip of the cue caught on the green and the stick broke in half. The ball jumped off the table with clamor.
Naturally Dean went up next, picking one of his favorite AC/DC songs. On a scale from 1 to 10, how stupid was this for impressing an angel?
"A joke, eh? They never turn serious, sure." Finally Dean stumbled over the doorstep again into the open.
Dean's hand ran through the brown hair he loved to feel against his skin. "How can I take the pain away? How can I save ...?" Castiel's lips closed on his, kissing him feverishly.
Castiel paced through the small motel room. How had it become this bad? Once they had been happy, or what went for happy in their lives at least. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows for them, but it didn't have to be. They had each other, that was enough.
He shook his head, her hand stayed. "I'm fine!", a sharp sound in the silent room. Cold gripped his heart. His family wanted him gone!
An intoxicating rush swept through their blood. They both sighed with relief, the soft touch tingled on the tip of their tongues, entwining around each other. Their breathing blended together.
A warm smile enveloped Castiel's face, from his lips to his eyes and every little line inbetween. "It would be my honor to kiss you, Dean, and to be a human with you."
Sheepishly Dean turned back to the car he was working on, leaning over the engine bay and his eyes were searching for a distraction. He didn't see nothing but Castiel's soft little smirk. "You must be starving walking all the way here. I left some of my lunch in the fridge, you can have it."
The angel Castiel stood at the entrance to the shop, trench coat obscuring his silhouette and blue tie slightly loose. "I now know what happened."
"Oh, it fucking is, dick." Now close enough Dean bored his index finger into Cas's chest. "You replaced me with this demonic bitch!"
"You make me feel like I'll be okay", Castiel's voice was quiet. "I want you to feel the same. With me."
Castiel lay on the ground, held is rips and his lips were bleeding. "You don't have to do this", he pleaded. "You don't need to kill anyone. You don't have to face this alone."
"Believe me, it'll blow your mind." Dean led them down the road, the strip club wasn't far away from here. "I know exactly the place to go to. I'm guessing you'd be into girls, most guys are."
Dean was only given a few looks but none were threatening. Exchanged a few nods with some betas and alphas he had gotten to know over time. And made his way onto campus with ease, it was such a nice day out. Air still crisp and cool but he had on his old leather jacket that warmed in the sun. He took his time walking, the trees were still bare but in a few weeks, they would bloom. The snow was just about melted on the grass and Dean was happy to wish it goodbye. He couldn't wait for this year to be over. Months ago he would have wanted to be free of Cas, now he wanted to start a life with the man.
"Balth, you home?" Gabriel emerged from the hallway with only a pair of sweats slung low around his waist. "Oh, hello Dean."  Gabriel had a smile on his face as he walked from the hallway into the main room. Dean sat at the base of them steps that was also dead center to the huge kitchen/living room/dining room. "Where is Cas?" Gabriel looked around the room as if his brother was hiding on him. He chose to ignore Dean’s red eyes and the fact his daughter was playing Dr.Phil.
“Douche.” Castiel snorted and kissed Dean’s temple, scenting him  quickly before they reached the mahogany door that stood out against the white outer walls of the house, up close they looked like concrete.
"Thought you could run, kitten?" he purred into Dean’s ear. His voice was sickening, like snakes curling under your skin. He turned to Cas "Back the fuck off blue eyes, I found this omega first."
"I have lots of clothes, you'll see them when we get there. We will be next to my brother Lucifer... so that should be interesting." Dean's smile faded slightly, Castiel's family still frightened him, he had no problem fighting an alpha but a family of all alphas made him nervous. He tried to think back to the pictures he had seen, the only two siblings he could place where Alfie and Anna, and Gabriel if he was in any pictures. The rest just looked like assholes wrapped in a monkey suit. Castiel noticed Dean change is disposition and walked over to him.
“Fine, go back to the dorm to change and then we go to the gym,” it’s the middle of the day and they should have a private sparring room open. A wide smile broke across Castiel’s lips.
Dean woke up with warm puffs of breath on his face and the soft sound of Castiel’s breathing. With a small chuckle, Dean looked up to see the still sleeping alpha above him. His phone was vibrating under his pillow and he let out a frustrated sigh, he didn't want to move from the bed but he knew he had to. He really couldn't miss any more classes, so with a stretch, Dean untangled himself from Castiel who let out an annoyed grunt and tugged at Dean's arm that was slipping away.
"Hey, no sleeping. Not yet, I want to check you over." Castiel rolled up the sleeves on his black button up.
Mary clenched her fists and tried to keep calm. She did not want to yell. "No John, that was not a 'mishap" she raised her hands for air quotes. "That was you being a stupid alpha. I can't tell what is wrong with you! Are you jealous?" Mary's brow knit together and John seemed to be processing something.
Castiel just laughed and walked over to Dean." You are one of the most attractive creatures I have ever met and the only place those close would look better is thrown at the foot of our bed." Dean leaned in for a kiss but he never received it. Instead, he was turned a whole one-eighty and looked at their reflection in the mirror.
“Cas, you don’t have to walk me everywhere I’m not some child and it is daylight.” Dean complained, he always said this when Cas insisted on walking him to class, he said it fell under a chick flick moment but Castiel said it was for safety.
"Cas, cool it my family isn't uptight. You have already met Jo." Dean took the two shirts from Castiel's hands that he was choosing between and tossed them back into the closet. "Can't believe I'm saying this babe, we're going shopping." Dean hated shopping, or so he told everyone.
"I don't know how I didn't smell myself beforehand, I mean I felt it but I chalked it up to stress and exhaustion."
Technically there was a way to break it, but it was normally terribly painful for all parties included. Dean was right, once a mate is claimed, even if it is just one sided both their chemical makeups change. Castiel becomes more possessive, and Dean would be more submissive. Something he is most definitely not. Castiel tried to wrap his mind around the fact he mated this man, this, well, stranger he had been living with. Castiel tried to remember back to earlier and what had gone down, Dean asked for sex and it just happened. All instincts kicked in.
“Fu-uck!” Dean yelped legs spazzing slightly. Castiel’s heightened senses picked up a very distinct buzzing sound. Castiel’s eyes widened and he looked down at the blue remote under his knee. A slight smile curled on Castiel’s lips, as badly as his cock screamed at him to bury himself in Dean he was presented with an amazing opportunity. He was not giving this up. Castiel picked up the remote and looked it over for a second, he remembered buying it for Dean all those months ago during his first heat. Castiel looked down at Dean who was biting his lip and slightly rocking back on the vibrator. With swift fingers, he switched it up higher causing Dean to spaz once again and yelped.  “Oh my god!” he whined arching his back off the mattress, “Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Go-o-od!”
“I think they might have heard you Mr. Novak.” Castiel retaliated by letting go of Dean, and watched as he scrambled and fell again. Dean used the wall as support, hoisting himself up again. Castiel did a quick lap around the rink showing off a bit by skating backwards and adding in (an extremely manly) spin.
Castiel reacted quickly and with shaking hands started to undress Dean. Pulling his wet jeans down his freckled legs and to his shins he only had to pull the black panties to the side. Dean was cold but Castiel warmed him up quickly with fast and deliberate strokes.
“Wow.” he said stating his presence in the room. Dean looked up at him quickly and gave him a small sheepish smirk.
“Sounds good to me.” Dean smiled still excited over the prank he already set up on Adam that was waiting in his dresser drawer.
"You needed me?" Alfie asked wiping a little sweat from his brow "sorry I was in the back before sorting out heavy boxes."
Scenarios on what to do ran through his mind, unmate? Not only would that psychologically scar Cas but it would also damage Dean too. They were stuck between a rock and a hard place and it seemed there is no way out. The decision was ultimately left to Dean, Castiel was the one who got them into this.
“The fact you can see the outline of my nipples, give me a few corny lines and a camera.” The shirt was at least two sizes too small and it practically outlined his chest hairs.
"I heard you listening to it before and liked it." Castiel accidentally spit out a blob of toothpaste onto the floor at his last words.
"Thank you." The nurse gave him one last smile and left. Opening the door he was happy to see Mary who was no longer sharing a room.
"Did I ask you?" Azazel's tone was cold and precise. Like those four words soul purpose was to diminish any scrap of self worth Dean had. He hates to admit it, but it was working.
"My slick is all over your face." Dean chuckled, kissing and licking at the stray drops on Castiel's nose.
"Of course not," Dean said cupping his cheek "What's gotten into you?" Dean was starting to panic, the complete fear
“Toothpaste,” Castiel added. Sliding his hand down to adjust Dean’s legs and pull him back into his lap so Dean sat on his thighs and Castiel was leaning on the balls of his feet and knees.
“This is my favorite par-” Just then Dean silenced Crowly by wrapping the rope around his throat. The guttural gargles that left his mouth as he squirmed to find traction as his legs slid out from under him. His gun clattered to the ground and Dean applied more pressure. Wanting to crush his windpipe so he could never speak again. All his rage flowing off him in waves he wanted Crowley to die he wanted to kill the man right then and there but the smell of blood was too strong. Once Crowley lost consciousness he made quick work of tying him to the deck so if he did wake up he wouldn’t be able to run.
“I love you. Dean Winchester.” Castiel whispered against Dean’s wet lips before he captured them again. Dean snaked his hand up Castiel’s shirt to run it over his smooth skin and over his hardening nipples. He groaned and pushed farther into Dean’s kiss and wound his leg around his waist.
TRIGGER WARNING: Talk of past sexual and mental abuse, painful flashbacks -not detailed- past non-con, and angry but consensual sex
“Yeah, babe I know. It’s okay.” He stood up offering Dean a hand. Dean took it, hoisting himself up.
“That is my father, really it is.” Dean snickered and waved his hand as to brush it off. Castiel pushed the rolling chair back and went to walk over to Dean. He seemed to be getting better but he was still slightly skittish in public, especially new and open places. Castiel hadn’t sensed anyone watching them but that didn’t mean he wouldn’t do anything and everything to make his mate feel safer; and if that meant drawing the shades when they slept, then he would be damned if he didn’t do it. Castiel talked him out of the odder blockers and said he didn’t need them to intimidate anyone.
"Nothing, just checking on how you're doing. What are you up to?" Dean paused, he didn't want to admit to Cas he came down here to talk to his brother about him. A little white lie wouldn't hurt.
Every mark is different, since every person has different kinds of teeth it makes every mating mark unique. Dean left an amazing mark, his teeth were rather straight. But his K9's were sharp and went deep into his skin. It would take a little while to heal, then there would be a silver scar left in its place. Every few years mates usually remark their partner to make the bite stand out more. But until then it remained red and the skin around it irritated, but it was still perfect.
"Cas, you literally only own button-ups, is there really that much of a choice?" Dean earned himself a fiery glare. "Okay, you want my help?"
Okay, sorry for such a late posting I have had a REALLY long and stressful day and I still have an essay to write and finals tomorrow!!! YAY! Now Emilie said she edited soooo....hopefully it's all good!
"No, I'm just late," Dean said taking a step back and out of the betas reach and pulled his zip-up tighter around him.
But the best part by far was the spray he picked up from the omega mart yesterday after class. It was worth a pretty penny but Dean was happy to splurge for Cas. It was a scent that mimicked an omegas heat and Dean couldn't wait for Castiel to get home. He looked over at the clock and smiled, only a few more minutes until Castiel was back. Dean sprayed his neck and inner thighs. Placing the blue glass bottle onto his nightstand he adjusted himself to the center of the bedspread his legs and waited for Castiel.
"I don't want to talk about it, Dean. Just let it go." His voice was cold like the air. Dean growled and jumped into Castiel's face.
By the time they were halfway there Castiel was making Dean uncomfortable, he was pulled to full height, and Dean could sense the irritation in his alpha, from their close proximity. He turned to look at his mate whose gaze turned immediately to him.
"My race track and-and dad said when he comes home he would play," Dean spoke with such excitement it made Mary glow with happiness. Dean was her world. Every smile he gave her made her day, he was always her number one priority and she wondered how he would feel when it wasn't just him. The flutter in her stomach made her think of the future and the two pups that would join them in only a few weeks.
“You have the right to remain silent, any moan, cry, or plead will be held against you in the court of law.” Dean let out  whimper and bit his bottom lip. Castiel slid in perfectly and took a few seconds to fully take in the amazing feeling of Dean wrapped around his cock.
"It's for reference and nostalgia, Jo." Adam snapped still upset over her rejection of the 'bloody mouth' trick.
“Well it was actually gonna be a surprise so you shouldn’t have but please don’t blow this out of proportion,” Dean begged, totally fine with his nudity.
“Anna!” Castiel hugged her back just as enthusiastically and they scented each other. Dean felt something odd in his gut, he had never seen Castiel like this, he could tell Cas loved Alfie but  they never greeted each other like this. Castiel did say he hasn't seen Anna in a very long time.
"Ha, Dean were you there earlier? Might as well burn the fucking sheets." Dean just laughed and flipped him off as he passed into the bathroom and flipped on all the lights behind him.
At six the alarm woke them up with its shrill beeps. Castiel fell off the edge of the small twin bed and crawled over to shut it off.
"We do." Ellen used to play on the team too, pretty damn good but she enjoyed her time with Mary more than old alpha musk and swearing.
Dean hated finals, then again who didn’t, it took up weeks of studying time that they could use towards learning something! But no that threw them to the sharks and tested them on the most unimportant things. That's what pushed Dean to the library at nearly eleven at night. Castiel was not a fan of the idea, but that didn’t matter because he planned on passing his tests and getting his ass out of there with Castiel behind him.
"That's good, can't imagine living down here my whole life." Castiel can feel Dean's sudden discomfort. He offered comfort to his mate with a soothing kiss to his temple.
"I've been trying to figure out the same thing. This guy at the library gave me a book and he was kinda creepy, Crowley I think his name was." Dean said trying to keep his voice low but relatively normal as to not set off alarm bells in Castiel’s mind.
"Cas, I'm going to go outside and change the tire." He placed a small kiss on his forehead and shimmied out of the back. Castiel followed behind him and Dean didn't speak up against it. Maybe Dean could even show him how to change a tire.
“Bring a jacket, it’s cold out.” Dean called over his shoulder as Cas tried to get his hair under control.
"Now Castiel why wouldn't you tell me you have this diamond as a mate? Witty and cute." Castiel stood up and walked over to Rachel.
"No, it's cool." Dean said "it's kinda cute." Cas brightened up. Cute? Dean is almost acting as affectionate as he was when he was in heat, just less touching. It made Castiel’s stomach feel warm and a small blush appear on his cheeks.
"Fuck, Dean so good, so wet, so amazing." Castiel moaned as he released one hand to wrap around Dean's bouncing cock.
Pushing his legs faster and trying to control the turmoil that boiled just below his skin he tried to focus. But nagging in his gut had him feeling disoriented, like a compass spinning in all directions.
"Yeah like I'm the most eligible bachelor in Kansas. Can’t even have sex without self-lubricating." Dean huffed obviously upset.
"You're brother's an omega? Wait, you're related to Alfie?" It was now just clicking into place what he said.
"That usually means move." She chimed in again, her boots clicking on the floor. "I mean as much as I would like to hide from them you've already been up here for two hours and no one needs a pissy mom." Castiel chuckled and pulled his head up away from the sweet smell of vanilla. Dean’s scent changed with his cycle, but he was always extremely appealing to Cas.
This was an odd chapter and it had two big events in it so I hopefully it didn't feels rushed or anything because this is the beginning of part two and I think you guys can guess what this part will be centered around... Family.
"Are you sure you’re not just staking your claim because you're addicted to sex?" Dean laughed trying to play off Castiel's very intimate comment.
It was dry, so unbearably dry and hot. For the love of God, his body was on fire as if the sun-kissed his skin every time he moved and his mouth felt like sand. Opening his eyes he saw his surroundings were not as he expected. He thought he would find himself on the beach, a desert, or maybe the surface of the sun. No, it was just a room, a horribly hot room. The bed was nearly scolding on his skin.
“No, it is used to get to know people and it’s just how it sounds. I say a fact about my life and you say one on yours.” Dean gave an approving nod and turned to Cas.
This was a calm time of Dean's heat, they could talk through this part. He still smelt so perfectly breedable but Castiel would never do that. Suddenly Castiel eyes widened and his breath caught in his throat.
"Yes, it's a long ass story on how he found out, but he did." Dean was so not going into details because he knew Jo would come storming over.
"So who have you bottomed for?" Castiel asked wondering if he wanted to know the answer. None of those men truly deserved Dean, the arch of his back before his climaxes, the bow of his lip when he sleeps. His whimpers and his smell, Cas didn't even deserve it. Dean deserved a whole alpha.
“Uh, cool.” he said backing out of the room to go brush his teeth. As he worked the toothbrush through his mouth, he listened to Dean dress. It was weird, this thing they were doing, really weird. Cas was making it weirder by suggesting they break a rule and go have dinner. Maybe Dean thinks it’s just casual, “let’s go get a burger,” but isn’t that what it was? It could never be anything more than that, could it? Cas shook his head, rinsing his mouth out, and returning to Dean.
“What did you get her by the way?" Dean looked up at his mate whose face froze in shock. Pulling himself off Cas and walked over to his dresser to pull on a t-shirt and nice worn jeans because he knew just what that face meant.
“I mean it would of been hard to keep it a secret. It’s on your neck, Dean. We can break it once school ends and never see those assholes again so they can’t report us.” Dean let out a deep breath and his shoulders slumped a bit, he looked so much smaller. Even if he had an inch or so on him.
“Well, come to me with those problems. I’m here for you.” Castiel slid his hand up Dean’s thigh until he rested it on his hip and placed a soft kiss on his lips. “School has been crazy for me too, but I always have time to help you wind down, Dean.”  Castiel dropped his forehead onto Dean’s shoulder and just held him there. Dean kissed Castiel’s temple and just took deep soothing breaths to calm himself down.
The next few days were hard on the both of them, Dean had hard time getting around and Castiel snapped at anyone who dare to look at Dean. He insisted on walking Dean to all his classes and had a problem with hovering.
Dean started up the shower but before he got in the cabinet caught his eye. Pausing Dean stepped back and looked at his completely exposed body in the mirror. He was strong, tense muscle and fast reflexes from sparring with Cas. His facial features were slightly feminine, with his thick eyelashes, full pink lips, and freckles that powder his face. His jaw could cut diamond and even if his eyes looked soft his gaze could stop you dead.
Dean has researched betas since he presented. He knows more on them than himself. He tries to act like them and completely ignore every omega instinct he has. Most importantly his heat, something Dean has never experienced himself. John had him on all types of experimental and highly illegal drugs. So he's twenty two and has never gone into heat, and if his father has any say in it then it may stay like that forever.
Again Dean was pressed back into his pillow but this time he kicked off his blanket to regulate his heated skin.
“So you must be Castiel.” His voice was happy and his body relaxed as he looked Cas over. Castiel tried to think of who knew him and came to the conclusion that this was Sam or Sasquatch as Dean put it.
“Ah yes, it’s to be expected, spread your legs a little so I can see the problem.” Dean nodded and opened up his legs for Cas. His alpha moved closer and took his hand to Dean’s inner thigh and began to rub with a firm grip. “Yes, Mr.Winchester you are very tense. Do you have someone to...relieve your problem?” At this point, they were role-playing a shitty doctor porno and it was taking so much self-control for them not to laugh. But it was fun-they both enjoyed funny sex, and how could you get in bed with someone who can’t make you laugh.
“Mate, my baby boy has a mate!” Mary was over the moon with joy as she pulled both men into a crushing hug peppered in kisses and welcomes. As it turns out everyone seemed pleased with the announcement, they purposely neglected to say how long they had really been mated but that was a minor detail.
"You were brilliant tonight." Castiel whispered as he placed a chaste kiss on Dean's mouth, he could taste the whiskey on his lips. "Now sit back and relax Dean." Castiel crawled all the way down the bed until he was back on his knees by Dean's feet. He traced his fingertips over his shins and soft kisses on his ankles. Slowly working his way up, giving every inch of skin attention. Dean let out pleasant hums as Castiel inched up. Placing a kiss in the center of his kneecap and the bend of his leg. Around the inside of his thigh and around to the outside to suck light bruises just above his hipbones. Memorizing the peppering of freckles over Dean's lightly tanned skin. Hooking his finger around his waistband he tugged it down a few inches to place a row of soft kisses that connected his protruding hip bones. The skin was taut and lighter than his stomach. Dean's erection brushed his throat.  Following the trail up to his belly button after leaving a slick trail from his tongue. Castiel was worshiping every inch of Dean's perfect body. From the hair in his legs to the soft give of his stomach and the spatter of freckles on his shoulders. Moving up to slid Dean's nipple between his teeth and moving down his side to suck and nip his ribs.
“Get the ambulance my mate has been shot.” The officer’s eyes widened as he called to his partner to call it in. The alpha nodded for Dean to lead him back. Stumbling over branches and bricks he brought the office to Castiel. He looked so small lying there, so pale in the moonlight and so fragile. He couldn’t see whose blood belong to who and it made Dean’s stomach turn. Dropping to his knees he cupped Castiel’s face in his hands.
"He isn't allowed to eat with us. Naturally he should be leaving to Balthazar's pack but that didn't happen. Only mated omegas from our pack are allowed at the table. And for all intents and purposes Gabriel is no longer in our pack." Dean's jaw dropped as he tried to absorbs all the information. Castiel placed a soft hand on Dean's leg but he didn't move.
“They plan to with my brother's upcoming matings but it is for anything but liking each other. In all honesty, I hope you never have to meet my pack.” Just by Castiel’s tone of voice, the mood changed slightly and Dean ran a soothing hand down his back. Mary, as always, came in with her words of warmth.
“Walk it off.” John grunted but Castiel didn’t move as he gasped for air. His eyes watered as a sharp pain radiated up his back. Dean was at his side in what felt like thirty minutes but was probably only thirty seconds.
"Your mom is a bitc- uh, crazy lady and you dad is just nasty." That was as far as he would go with such an impressionable little pup in his arms.
"What? No.” Dean covered quickly “Besides I wouldn't ask. I'd just do it." Castiel laughed, would he care if Dean marked him? He should, Dean can't be his real mate he's well, Castiel knows there is a reason why he just can't think of it now.
“Okay, what I got so far, tough little girl who loves her daddy.” Dean smiled, he thinks he’ll like her. “And her uncle, obviously.”
“Hey, um so how would this be called off? I’m not asking for me since my mind and body think you’re mine but.” Dean paused, he knew Dean wasn’t his mate but saying the words make his throat tighten, “What if you find a real mate?”
"We do have some time to ourselves. Raphael isn't home yet and I owe you big for coming here." Castiel crawled towards his mate and placed a kiss on his neck.
He trailed up to his sternum and collarbones. Trailing up to his ear he gave a soft nip at his lobe. Breathing over the shell of his ear he purred.
"It was terrible, I can't believe I let him go with me. Mom and dad were as awful as they are with Gabriel."
“He would rather me be an alpha, I- I don’t even know if he expected me to mate.” Dean spoke quietly almost as if he was talking to himself.
"Come on Dean!" His father called from across the track. "They would have caught you by now! Done, might as well ship you to a brothel now!"
"Has Castiel ever had close friends outside the pack?" Dean hoped Alfie had a long enough break to talk about this.
"No really how is everyone?" Dean was interested in how his pack was holding up. He really only exchanged short text with them nowadays. Sam laughed like he was going to humor his brother.
“Yeah, your family is a bunch of jackass knotheads,” he replied “but, hey, at least you’re not alone with them anymore,” blushes and mumbles really low “...now you have me”
“Fuck..” Now he felt bad about his fight with Cas, but in all fairness, he can handle himself. Maybe the storming out was dramatic but he hated being coveted and babied. So what his heat was soon, so what about anything.
"Not really, guess I'll be sitting with the pack for a little. Damn, you know those packs that stay together for generations? They have a huge territory and they just build homes for their pups when they grow. What ever happened to that?" To say Castiel wanted a big family was an understatement. His brother just shook his head.
“That was when I was in heat. Now, no cuddling.” he said firmly.  Cas bit down on his lip to stop from protesting, they were fake mates, cuddling wasn’t really appropriate.
"Alright, sure give me a minute." Dean scribbled down another point on his piece of paper, Cas, who was curious glanced over his shoulder.
“Oh Jesus Jo, figuratively ya sick fucker!”  He heard her laughing over the line and waited to talk. “As I was saying, I’ve got an alpha roommate. Like big, rugged, muscular, musky alpha, knot included.” Jo paused obviously sensing this was more serious than Dean was letting off.
"Fuck," Dean readjusted his legs and spread them farther apart. Pleased with his reaction Cas pulled his fingers from his ass and sucked hard at the little pink hole.
“Oh come on, I can do some research on the city, I mean it is the capital, I’m sure there are some jobs laying around or at least I can start with TA and subbing.” Dean was hesitant to answer but in the end, picked up his phone to call Bobby.
Castiel's phone ringing startled them both. Luckily he only had to move Dean a little to reach his phone. The ID read Gabriel. He slid his screen and pulled the phone to his ear.
“Dean, you’re a good actor. You could pass for a beta even in bed. Well except for your slick, just don’t fuck they guy. Or get awkwardly turned on by his extreme alpha musk.” Dean gave a half hearted laugh and kept picking at his pants.
He had a late class tonight so they were not planning on doing anything.  Castiel actually thought he was going to be jumped by his mate at the door.
Dean was already in the shower, it was rather warm for his already hot temperature. Sliding in next to him in the black and white tiled shower he smirked at Dean who was flushed and hard.
“How about you just sit back and let me take care of you?” Dean sat up to straddle Castiel’s hips, he could feel Castiel’s warm body heat through the paper-thin sleep pants. Cas groaned as if he wasn’t really into it but he didn’t shy away from Dean.
“Nice to see ya’, blue eyes.” She nodded at Cas, remembering how they first met. He was confused, naked, and stunk of sex.
His favorite ham and cheese with the crust cut off and a large glass of milk. Like every day she was greeted with an over-excited smile and dove into his food.
"I am truly sorry, but I can't let a bag of money just walk out the door" Dean narrows his eyes and try to study his face, but it was completely blank.
“So what do you have in mind for Beckett?” Dean broke the comfortable silence that filled the car. His eyes never averted from the road and the sun was slowly rising behind the trees that cast shadows onto the highway.
"Nice job, blue eyes," Jo said as she pats his back. Adam walked over to the side of Castiel's small shooting cubical and pressed an orange button. By the time they were done congratulating Cas and he had shaken the post-shooting tremor out of his hands the target was brought to them.
Finally, Castiel made it to his room, sliding his key in he swung the door open. He was hit with a blast of air freshener that was so potent it burned his nose. Castiel coughed a few times as he entered the room, leaving the door open behind him. He looked around the room to find Dean was gone, his bed was made and had a towel folded over his laundry bin. He looked over at the open windows and noticed the can of air freshener by Dean’s bedside, and another on the bathroom counter. Castiel felt suddenly embarrassed, was his scent really that terrible? No one else had commented on it, some actually enjoy his smell.
They entered the theater like room to see about a dozen couples, a dozen very cuddly affectionate couples. They were sitting on the floor in a circle, in front of the desks and chairs in the back, Dean looked at Cas with hairy eyes. “What have you gotten us into?”
"For the love of god please tell me you are on birth control." Dean's stomach clenched for a second and then it clicked. Suppressants.
“How is he at bearing pups?” He asked and Dean thanked god his back was turned so he didn’t see his eyes widen at his comment and his breath catch in his throat. Dean could puke at the thought of bearing that man’s pups.
"Oh god." Dean went through numbers frantically in his head three times over. "C-Cas!" Dean's voice was broken and he couldn't avert his eyes from the date. He was two weeks late for his heat. Two weeks. Two.
“Thank you, officer.” Once the gruff man walked off Cas cranked up the window and Dean fell back laughing.
“Sit up on the headboard more, Mr.Winchester.” He obeyed and was quickly rewarded with Castiel's thumb placed firmly at his wet hole. “Good, just like that, now relax and let me help you.” Castiel purred, scooting closer so he could still see himself finger fucking Dean but could still kiss him. Castiel added another digit and Dean preened with pleasure. “Fill you up so good, won’t need any other alpha.” He started to scissor open the omega and that's when Dean’s pleased hums turned more sensual.
"God damnit it, Cas I said leave me the fuck alone." Dean snarled, but with one sniff of the air he knew it was not Castiel. Turning around Dean growled, trying to conceal his injury. But the smell of his blood was already in the air and he was at a disadvantage. The long and lanky outline of an alpha walked towards him. Ducking under branches he made his way closer.
“I assure you, Mr. Alton, he is just what you ordered,” Crowley spoke, quite proud of himself. They were only a few feet away and Dean watched the older man who was referred to as Alton crack a slender smile at the sight of Dean.
"Much." Dean felt instantly better other than the slight guilt of letting his instinct take him so far, he was so relieved Castiel had such control over himself. He really wasn't expecting him to stop. This position was best. He had control over the speed and that gave Dean a ping of satisfaction.
“We didn’t take any.” It was a lie, but Dean did not care for this man one bit. He wanted to get home ASAP. He prayed Castiel wasn't mad at him and he would have a warm alpha to pamper and scent.
"No I do, so when you do get home you can find a nice spot on the sofa because I can't talk to you right now." With that, she hung up forcefully and took a deep calming breath before she faced Dean.
“Do you wanna go get a burger or something?” Dean froze. “I’m starving. If not that’s fine. Do you want me to bring you one back? You have to study. You probably don’t want to-”
"I'm Rachel." She extended a hand to him and he shook it. "So you're the famous Dean Winchester? What makes you so special out little Castiel picked you?" Rachel asked curiously.
"You really think your parents are gonna make us go to your place? I have a very clear no pack visits rule in our contract that will not be broken." Dean sipped at his coffee and looked at his feet as he walked.
His brain was in such an overwhelming panic he paused to pick out the strongest trail. The taste of blood in his mouth didn’t help. Taking a deep breath in he settled on the path that leads across the street.
"Wow, Cas didn't know bottoming was such a terrible thing for you." Castiel was processing the words through his mind that was on borderline shutdown mode.
He left to grab a few things from the bathroom and caught his reflection. He had bags under his eyes and a little stubble but his eyes were bright, his cheeks were red, and he had the most amazing mating mark on his neck.
“What the hell is going on down here?” Castiel growled silencing his mother before she could snap at Dean.
Saying Castiel’s home was jaw dropping was an understatement. It was on a three acre plot of land and half the house looked to be made of glass. It was modern like something you would see in movies or in travel commercials to tropical lands.
“I can do this.” He whispered to himself breathing out. A little self-motivation did little to calm his nerves.
With one sniff of the air Dean’s eyes widened but Castiel lunged himself at him before he could speak. Shoving Dean’s back into the bed he pressed his nose into Dean’s neck and drank in his smell. Castiel was already at full attention and grinding into Dean’s crotch.
"Hey, Samandriel you have one long ass name." The alpha chuckled and lightly shook his head. He handed off Deans coffee and sighed.
"Mmm, baby I got you." Castiel purred and he peeled off his own shirt. Dean's jeans looked as to be his greatest enemy and he couldn't get them off fast enough. Once he threw them on the floor a new wave of slick hit him full blast and he almost doubled back. The site in front of him almost made him pop a knot is his pants.
"C-Cas you're such a damn tease. I know you want it. Fuck me Cas, fuck me like your body keeps telling you to." Castiel became more forceful. Shoving his tongue deeper and gripping Dean's hips harder. "I'm presenting so perfectly for you, come on. Knot me." Maybe it was the smell of rut, or the overwhelming urge to please his mate, or Dean just accepting he was an omega and Cas was an alpha. This wasn't all Dean was good for but he was the only one who could bring Cas to his knees. If anything, Dean was the one who had the power.
The thrust became increasingly faster and harder, Dean knew he would have bruises on his body from this. And once it reached its crescendo of pushing in and pulling out Castiel collapsed. Neither of them had come and Cas weaved his hand down to warp around Dean's soft cock to work his back to attention. Castiel changed to slow shallow pulls and muffled whimpers. He stretched out his neck to capture Dean's lips and tangle his tongue into the omegas mouth.
"Since when is coffee a dinner date? I was just going to talk to Alfie. And we have a class tonight and I was thinking you might want a caffeine kick before Sex ED class."
"There's a hotel not far from here." He said quietly "I don’t want to drive in this weather, and since we're early anyway-" his voice died out. Mentioning their early leave made both of them a little uncomfortable.
"Okay hear me out on this." Castiel started, standing up from his bed. "We swap clothes and scent each other, I'll scent the doors and windows like a warning."
A stray tear fell from the corner of Castiel’s eye and he fought with the dark thought in his head that he was too late. He knew he wasn’t he couldn’t be this was Dean, he was a force to be reckoned with and he would put up the fight of his life.
"You woke me up, for sex..." Castiel answered, his words came out slowly and slightly confused. "And I thought you were awake."
“Well, now it’s time to show you a blast from the past.” Before Cas could ask him what he was talking about Dean opened a door.
Dean pulled the napkin off his lap and threw it onto the table and stood up purposely scratching the chair across the wood floor.
Dean gave a slight growl as Castiel jumped out of bed wearing only red boxers. Dean sat up and craned his neck to enjoy the view of Castiel walking.
“Much better than anticipated, I was worried that the stress of travel and meeting your pack would hinder my healing process but it doesn't seem to make a difference.” Mary still placed a soft hand on his back and rubbed him, it was subtle but she was scenting him as a sign he was accepted. Castiel felt truly touched by her immediate love towards him.
“Dear Castiel, I am calling upon you to get your fine ass down here.” Nothing, like the last four times. He couldn’t believe their bond was so weak. He couldn’t feel anything from Cas’ side and only assumed his mate felt the same nothingness. Dean had no idea how long he had been down there but it was starting to get uncomfortably cold, his arms fell asleep long ago and his wrists were rubbed raw from his futile attempts and slipping out of his restraints. He started to feel some give, but it was probably just his imagination. He knew his father had trained him for these situations, but his mind was falling blank. He decided to stop struggling and relax, his wrists were probably swollen and that would make them harder to pull out.
“Cas, it’s just my phone.” He pulled it out of his pocket and dangled it in front of Castiel. The caller ID said ‘Mary’ Dean light up at that.
