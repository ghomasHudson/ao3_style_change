“Today, we will work on making a very simple tincture, which lessens the effect on many potions and is often used in medicine. At the end of the lesson, I will check your work and if it’s alright, we will save it in the cupboard. You will need it as an ingredient for our next lesson.
The Santa makes a disapproving noise and tries to wipe away the blood, but it only distributes it all over Sherlock’s face.

“Because you are amazing, although, granted you can be a bit of a dick. You are lovely, Sherlock Holmes. And I utterly adore you.
Luckily, the game only takes a few more minutes now. Their team won, and Irene, Molly and Sherlock hug each other in celebration, while the commentators voice can finally be heard.
Later, Sherlock will beat himself up for his grand stupidity that he did not notice the foreign smell editing from his hidden cupboard sooner when he gets the wolfsbane potion out.
They haven’t progressed much further from that. Sherlock had been lying in Johns lap on Bond night (dreadful movies, but they made John laugh), John had taken his hand during breakfast (after that Sherlock spent hours categorizing Johns lovely and strong hand. There was so much to find out!), John had nuzzled his face into his curls, Sherlock had dragged John on top of him and they had a snogging session (Johns body was heavy and warm and never failed to make Sherlock feel protected and treasured), John had. Sherlock had.
They didn’t have a chance to talk yet. Their first meeting took place right at the altar, and the veil around his face was too thick to read John’s expression properly. He didn’t look thrilled, but then he had probably also harboured the delusion of marrying for love and was now being settled with the son of his biggest enemy.
She must have put in the tincture he himself taught his students on their first day at Hogwarts. The tincture that weakens a potion’s biggest effect. Intended as a safety net, now abused as a weapon.
Sherlock is exhausted from these few seconds and sacks back against John, who wraps his arms around him. John tries to understand what apparently happened (MAGIC?!), but also knows that Sherlock is too tired for a drawn-out explanation.
Then Sherlock’s fingers wandered to John’s biceps and John pressed his lips against the detectives, while still holding him as snugly as possible.
It’s not the first bed, or the second, or the third, but finally it is the fourth at the trauma station. John glimpses a set of formerly black, now grey curls and yanks the curtain open with brutality.
It is the 13th of October, first rugby game of the new school year, and Sherlock Holmes is already freezing on the cold benches. Half the school population is here, plus a few dozen fans of the opposite team, and the atmosphere is possibly cracking with anxiety. The Baker School desperately wants their team to win, and everyone is cheering and clapping for their boys.
was murdered at the Astronomy Tower 16 years ago. She had offered Sherlock the job as teacher last year, only seven years after he had initially left Hogwarts as a top grade student.
Sherlock kisses him. Their tongues play with each other, their lips are frozen, all around them is only silence.

turned to the new voice and gasped. Now he finally recognizes the young boy! It was no one other than John Watson, his clerk! He was one of the oldest children in the room, maybe 14 years old, and held himself proud and confident. He stepped around the nurse, shielding the younger boy from her view, and pulled Sherlock gently to his feet. The younger boy stood shakily next to him.
Sherlock waves his switch through the air in frustration: “There is nothing to do! I already did all the university tasks for this week, I am not allowed to play my violin too much because it disturbs Mom and Mycroft, and I cannot even get out for grocery shopping!”

The first thing he sees is a no longer pregnant Mary, standing in the right corner of the small room, a gun in her hand, pointed at Sherlock. Mary. Blond, smiling, once pregnant Mary. The world was really starting to make him crazy today.
When Sherlock suddenly hears screams, he throws the door open. One Slytherin boy is clutching the robe of a
Sherlock curled into him and hides his face in John’s shoulder. Greg was pretty sure that there are enough wheelchairs in this hospital, but Sherlock’s looked mostly at peace now, although he was still shaking from the pain.
Sherlock says. Before he knows it, he is flipped on his stomach, laying now fully in the middle of the bed.
Sherlock shrugs and John snorts into his glass. “Oh god, yes. I’m surprised you lasted a day. You’re awful at following orders, I bet. Way too stubborn.
catches one last look at Gregory and his wife, who share a brief kiss. The Ghost takes him by the arm again and guides him out, back into the street. The dark night is now more stiffening, after spending so much time in light rooms, filled with laughter, food and celebrating friends.
They step onto a small glade, and John observed Sherlock’s face closely. His eyes widened comically, his mouth fell open, and his frown turned into a big smile. John’s heart glows at his husbands reaction. Oh, Thor, nothing is better than seeing a surprised Sherlock Holmes, especially when he elicited the reaction.
The wolf gets up, baring his still humane teeth. Fresh flesh, vulnerable and defenselss, only a few steps away from him. The hungry growl starts in his stomach, and he prepares himself for the sprint.
Something catches Sherlock’s eye. It takes Sherlock a moment to recognize the frankly, not well-put together costume. An older student from
Sherlock begged him with his eyes, but John would not back down until he received a real answer. The detective opened is mouth, then closed it again. Open, close. John waited patiently.
However, through all of these pleasantries, John had not forgotten the noise. It sounded like knocking, and it drove him insane. His work at the E.R at a busy London hospital was stressful, and he needed his peaceful sleep.
John claps again, and the students are a lot more motivated this time. Sherlock wonders if he should get John a whistle for their next

, groaned the boy and rubbed his head. Sherlock had tripped and landed on his butt. He looked at the boy through his long eyelashes. His face burned like a vulcan now. Well, Molly always told him he resembled one anyway. From that weird space series. May as well look the part.
The position as potion teacher has not been very popular for decades. There is of course the whole scandal with
Sherlock had spent it in a small village in the mountains of Tibet, where they celebrate no Christmas. He had lightened a candle and hoped for a safe return. Next he had gone to Russia, then to Belarus, then to Serbia, where only hard fists and a short chain waited.

creature was neither young nor old. His long hair was white like an old man, but his hands were free of wrinkles. He had muscular arms, but his feet were so delicately formed like a child.
"Our flat is too big, and I want to change the clinic too. I can't go back there, not after... what happened. I think I found a new one, not far from here."
“I want you to look at me the whole time. You will witness everything I’m doing with you, or it will be much worse for you. Do you understand me?“
You can have some of mine, if you want it. I don’t think I ever tasted a better roast beef, my mother’s excluded.
Sherlock is neither in the living room nor in the kitchen. John stores away their groceries and starts making tea.
“She threatened me multiple times. Mary thought I was taking you away from her. She desperately wants to rekindle your relationship.
John holds his breathing but otherwise lifeless body of Sherlock in his arms and wishes for Moriarty to appear again, so he can drown him properly.
Stepping back into Mary’s light living room felt surreal. How could so much happen in less than two hours? John’s muscles shivered a bit as they warmed up, and he felt Sherlock stir in his arms. He walked them both into the bathroom and set Sherlock carefully down and propped his upper body against the bathtub. In the light, he could finally look at Sherlock properly, and this time nothing prevented him from cursing out.
Of course Sherlock would notice John’s dark mood immediately. John sighs and sits down on the sand. Sherlock doesn’t wait for permission and just crawls in his lap, his long fishtail hanging over John’s knees. The merman’s face is pressed against John’s shoulder. He can survive outside the water for approximately seven minutes before the air is becoming a problem. Usually, John just carries him into deeper water until then, so Sherlock can easily scoop his head underwater every few seconds. John uses the salt to float, and Sherlock entangles his long body with him. There are no more positions they haven’t tried out so far.
Two fingers on Sherlock’s left hand began stroking John’s hand, which startled the doctor into interrupting the discussion and stooping down into Sherlock’s eye view. The detective blinked at him, which prompted John into a smile. Greg took discreetly a step back, he didn’t want to crowd them.
The four tables are close to collapsing due to the massive amount of candy and other stuff which Sherlock believes the muggles call fast food‘. John took care of the menu. Smaller pumpkins are hanging from the ceiling, their ghostly smiles throwing shadows to the walls, while the ceiling is exploding with sparks and thunder. Later, the ghosts will perform a special play for everyone who can stand to watch that stuff without falling unconscious. The Nearly Headless Nick has been practising his famous head trick‘ for weeks.
“That’s good to hear. I can send you a few pictures tomorrow. I have been very busy working-out and with jogging.”
He feels his bed dip a bit, and seconds later, there is a hand on his shoulder. Sherlock can feel the warmth radiating from it through his thin shirt.
The man swears and slaps Sherlock so hard in the face that he sees stars for a moment. “Always looking for a nice cock,
On some days, everything goes wrong. Someone oversleeps, spill tea on your shirt, arrive late at work, miss lunch break, and more catastrophes. Even worse, teachers don’t get to hide behind their office desk, they need to be on a stage, with dozens of eyes watching their every movement.
He has only been here for one day, and already hates it. It is too cold, their kingdom is far more in the north than the Holmes’s land, the earth here is frozen here and the Watson’s are not very talkative, but like to drink and fight. For the wedding they invited dozens of guests, and the only number had only doubled for the feast. Around two hundred people sit at three long tables and shove food into their mouths. Someone is thinking in a terrible tune.
„He is not a freak!“ argued John back, sounding determined. „And my father was a doctor, he taught me a lot! I can help him sleep.“
gods, his voice. Deeper than he guessed, and it flowed down his back like honey. The moving lips looked even more delicious.
The slave tried to push against his masters, but they hold him tight and finally cuffed him to the stake. There was an iron collar around his long neck, which must be quite uncomfortable, manacles around his wrists and ankles, and the seller pushed a gag in his mouth and tied something around his head to keep him quiet. He was wearing a bit of fabric around his waist. There was a big bruise over his left eye and several others across his body. One foot was whitened with chalk, indicating he was a new one from abroad. The young man also wore a
also has a small café at the front of it. Many neighbours pop in early in the morning to get their fresh cup of coffee and a scone. That is why this part of the store is simply called Speedy’s. There is a small checkout to the left of the entrance and on the right side are six tables with two chairs each crammed into the corner. Speedy’s not only offers coffee, but also hot chocolate, ten different tea categories, muffins, cake and more. Apart from the coffee, there is also a corner with one cosy armchair and several large pillows, inviting people for a quick read before deciding on whether to buy the book or not.
Now, John knows that he should have done more to help his mother. He should have called the police, tricked her into a cab and brought her to hospital.
Together, they wrestle John out of his robe and his cuddly jumper. Sherlock allows his eyes to wander over John’s broad chest.
Slowly the realization came in. Sherlock had just done the worst thing in his life. Couldn’t he just behave like a normal human being for once? Would it have been so hard to say
John mumbles, and Sherlock listens to the clink of the closing bathroom door. Seconds later, another person is looming over him and grabbing his wrists. Only this time, it is not at all welcome.
“True. My first week as an apprentice in St. Mungo’s. A patient with nasty burns was brought in too late. He practically fell to ashes in front of us.
and his drug addiction, and the other secret is so deeply hidden that not even his own parents know.
The door opened and all the guests turned around. It was Sherlock, and for a moment John was blown away by his appearance. The detective had tried to control his curls for the special occasion, but some locks were already fluffing around his forehead again. They both were matching suits. John looked like an ordinary bloke in it, and Sherlock had the aura of a bloody supermodel. The detective was walking down the aisle to meet him, and John couldn’t keep the big, happy smile away from his face. God, it was so unfair. Not that John minded gawping at his best friend here and then.
Fifteen minutes later, all children have returned. Sherlock notices that Allen’s face is nearly purple from the exercise. Serves him right for burning a table.
Sherlock winced at the mention of his brother’s name, and John nuzzled his nose into the dark curls to console him.
, so many problems are ahead of them, but Sherlock is back in John’s arms, where he belongs, and John can’t be happier.
“You are a struggling student, I can see your student ID clipped onto your trousers. You are struggling with the money, therefore you work part-time at Starbucks, picking up extra and unpopular shifts during December to earn more money. As with the medical training, it was a lucky guess, your reaction confirmed my idea. Your hands are dry from all the washing and disinfecting at the hospital. Furthermore, you are helping me, a person the majority prefers to ignore and actually continuing to converse with me displays your caring and helpful character.

was dead. Mary had killed him, and she also apparently was the shooter who nearly killed Sherlock and John was some stranger, someone Lestrade doesn’t recognize.
Gladstone knows he is not allowed in there, because he does not like being washed in the bathtub and always tries to scratch whoever holds him, so he runs of to their bedroom and jumps on the covers. Sherlock does not mind sharing their bed with Gladstone, and the dog hopes he can make up for his mistake earlier.
Sherlock tries to skip this no doubt unpleasant conversation: “Professor, the sixth graders are waiting with a large boiler of
The words slip out of Sherlock’s mouth, and he wishes he could force them back in. People do not appreciate his unwanted deductions, which he has learned this the hard way during his time as a homeless.
“Because a little thing affects them. I must have eaten something wrong in the tavern, something that upset my stomach. Or I drank too much whiskey and am now hallucinating. Or I worked to hard and you are a symptom of my stress. These are all perfectly possible explanations.
Sherlock can not describe how much he loves this man. Under John’s touch, they stop itching, no matter how much it rains.
“Moriarty had snipers on the roof. They would have shot you, Lestrade, and Mrs. Hudson. I could never risk that, so it all had to look convincing. Molly helped me, I knew Moriarty would underestimate her. After that, months of utter hell passed, and I was so alone and the whole time I thought.” Sherlock’s voice suddenly breaks, and he sinks to his knees. John is there for him immediately, his head reeling with what Sherlock just told him.

After a successful transaction with Timmy and Tommy, Sherlock’s bag feels significantly lighter. The two boys settle down at the beach, a burning fireplace between them.
Curse would be the worst. Someone else taking your will away and forcing you to do whatever they want…
John‘s voice breaks, and Gladstone carefully climbs around Sherlock to settle between Sherlock‘s sleeping body and John‘s. The dog scratches John‘s shirt until the man finally starts petting his back.
Yes, John could be a friend. Sherlock has already more friends than he ever expected. He did not get along with about ninety percent of his school peers. He said too many deductions out loud, and he stopped too late. The next seven years, Sherlock was shoved down the stairs, kicked under the table, his pens were stolen, his books were ripped apart, and every
John doesn’t know what to say. All his doctor training is flying right out off the window in this situation.
Sherlock leans forward in his seat and puts his long hands together in a thinking pose. “Did you notice anyone behaved differently in the last days?
It can be easily overwhelming, and Sherlock is still learning how to filter less important stuff out. He is good at it when they are somewhere familiar, at school, on the rugby field (he doesn’t play, but John does, and for some reason, him being there brings luck for John), and their homes. London is always different, it constantly changes, and it’s both exhilarating and alarming all at once.
god, John will never forgive him. He told the doctor he’d buy milk from the shops, and John had barely looked up from the book he was reading.
John says curtly and turns abruptly around. Sherlock and Mary listen to the clonk of his cane disappearing.
He promises her. Sherlock protests a bit until John whispers to him that he would slip into the prince’s bed at midnight. Sherlock hates to sleep alone, and John has to admit that it keeps his own nightmare at bay too.
at the Three Broomsticks. Victor had been attentive and nice as well, until Sherlock must have done something wrong, why else would Victor have called him a freak‘ only days later?
The two finish their tea in comfortable silence. From outside, they can hear the children laughing. Maybe they were throwing each other into the Great Lake again.
He is ripped out of his growing confusion by a gentle touch to his elbow that sends immediate shocks through his back.
In retrospect, he really should have known what really happened to them. There was only one person in John’s life, who would have been bold enough to take his dog tags. And John just found that person.
Right. John took a deep breath, trying to act normally. He could hear a car rolling in front of the church and seconds later loud cheering.
was above such childish nonsense. He wore his brown hair short and always carried himself with an imposing, arrogant and confident manner, and why shouldn’t he? He had brought a considerable amount of wealth over his adoptive family.
It is a Friday in October, and possibly the last sunny day this year, so the fourth graders today are grating on his last nerves. Two
, he told her in his calm voice, that he knew sounded more terrifying than anyone's screaming ever would. John was deathly serious.
He isn’t. Sherlock is surrounded by his best friends, and yes, plural. He is finally together with the love of his life.
Sherlock shrugs: “She is one of the best British authors. We read Pride and Prejudice in school, and I surprisingly enjoyed it, although it’s certainly not a book about chemistry nor bees. I like this series. It’s calming.
“Nonsense. There is no such thing as love. It’s the only thing more laughable than Christmas. Good afternoon!

Santa shakes his head, annoyed. “It gives me headaches. I won’t insult your intelligence either, that’s why I’m more careful with you than the others.
Sherlock doesn’t know how to respond to that, although his head is turning because of these exciting news. John had developed romantic feeling for a man!
Sherlock steps out of the way so John can have the whole Mirror for himself. Feeling both nervous and eager, John stares at his opposite, that slowly turns into…
, a rehabilitated Anderson, a surprisingly nice Sally, a James from forensics and Stella Hopkins. The Greg John mentioned is apparently not coming. Maybe he has something more useful to do.
John’s hand presses Sherlock’s arse, and he arranges his legs. Sherlock enjoys it a lot, being manhandled by John like this.
Before Sherlock has a chance to respond, a new man walks into the flat. He is not much taller than Paddington, with short blond hair and blue eyes, and wears a brown jumper and jeans. This must be John Watson, the army doctor. Paddington detects a lot of problems under the jumper, a steady hand, a strong will and a few dark secrets that are buried deep. As soon as John steps in, Baker Street seems to glow, and Sherlock is much more relaxed. The two men smile at each other.
The salesman looks at him a bit strangely, but Sherlock ignores that. The customer is not always but sometimes right, and John will appreciate the cactus. Sherlock is sure of that.
Through the celebrating crowd of teenagers, John limps through, receiving praise for the decorations from all sides. With a content sigh, he falls down on his usual place next to Sherlock. It has been two months, but Sherlock can no longer imagine spending a meal without the reassuring professor at his side.
He knows John will be sick with worry, but he also knows that Mycroft never answers to blackmail. At the mere thought of how long he may be forced to stay a captive, the lasting sickness comes back, and he retches right into the toilet, his stomach rolling with fear. He hopes Mary won't come back to laugh some more at him.
Sherlock chokes out, while John takes his hands, pins them over Sherlock’s head and peppers his long pale neck with kisses.
It all started with a toy soldier. John had lost it when he was only 10 years old. John, his older sister Harry and their father had sailed right into a dark storm, and the toy soldier slipped right through John’s fingers. He mourned the lost of his favourite toy immensely, and in a fit of youthful anger, screamed at the sea one lonely night. On the next morning, the toy soldier, only missing a leg, was waiting for John on the coast. John thanked the sea, and Sherlock answered back.
In perfect health? John chuckled. The slave had bruises all over! The fact that he was from the same region as John’s parents seemed too good to be true. Rome was his home, but he had always been interested in his heritage.

teacher, is wearing a red gown and large orange wings. Sherlock has expected this costume when the shy teacher had asked him last week about a potion that makes a person spit fire. This costumes certainly has the potential to either be spectacular or burn the castle down.
Elizabeth calls out something after him, but John doesn’t listen any more. He fumbles with his own phone, nearly drops it, swears. No new messages, the display says. John goes to speed dial and calls Sherlock’s number, trying not to think about the last call that felt so similar to whatever this is now.
John scrambles over him, and with skilful movements thanks to years of healer training, the purple shirt dissolves under his fingers. John leans down and licks a stripe from Sherlock’s naval to his neck, and Sherlock’s head arches back as John pinches first his left, then his right nipple.
Sherlock asks. His voice is defeated, his shoulders drawn. Game over for Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.
“Sherlock, you probably have a concussion. The nurse will be here shortly to examine you further. Can you tell me what happened?
John spent three horrible days wandering around this way too big house, cursing everyone he saw, and hated himself most of all. What would his wife do with Sherlock? Maybe she already killed him, maybe his body was lying in the
The lie rolls easily off his tongue. Sherlock does not want to bring John into this stupid rivalry game, whatever Mary is playing.
She says and points at the two chairs in front of the desk. John and Sherlock obey. Sherlock is reminded of the many situations he has been found here before, most notably when he set the second floor underwater.
He pours a few drops of in it on his open palm. Under the curious eyes of the first graders, a small, lilac flower grows out of the thick substance. A few gasps and someone even claps. Sherlock presents the small flower to one of the girls standing around, who accepts it with a whispered thank-you.
had asked because he didn’t know if a transparent ghost - it must be a ghost — was able to sit down in a chair. But the ghost sat down on the chair opposite to him, the one where Old Marley and his wife always used to sit.
“No time like the present.” Mycroft said and got up. “Does Sherlock want to talk to your girlfriend as well?”
Sherlock blurts out and wants to press his hands in front of his mouth to stop another sound from getting blurbed out.
John was here. He had pushed the man aside and was now pushing him up for a few precious seconds to catch some much-needed air. His captor was struggling to stand again.
behind the Basilica Julia in the Roman Forum. It was an extremely popular slave market in Rome. John’s heart shuttered. Did Gregor want to buy him his own slave?
He was reluctant to wake Sherlock up from his slumber, but he couldn’t carry both Sherlock and his bag in one go. The detective grumbled a bit as John helped him step out of the car, but then suddenly paused. John panicked for a second, anticipating Sherlock to faint, but the man was still standing. Sherlock let his eyes wander over the houses, the few trees, the overflowing bins, the skyline of the financial district that was visible at the horizon.
The detective inspector was following a long corridor, hoping that the large, heavy-looking door would be his final destination. Of course the polite thing would have been to meet Greg at the house door, but after all the Holmes were never a polite family. He pushes the door open
As promised, the bell rang again and Sherlock was none the wiser. He had to do a little sprint to overtake his dad who was on the way to the door, and so he ended up a
“Of course I will meet other friends, but why would I ever forget about you, Sherlock? You are my best friend, and you’ll always will be!
Keeping their relationship secret is surprisingly easy. John’s family had accepted their son’s unusual hobby (spending time alone at the beach or with his boat) a long time ago and didn’t question him when he was gone for multiple hours nearly every day.
They stop in front of the Mirror and Sherlock throws the large blanket off it. The Mirror is taller than Sherlock, and so wide they can both stand comfortably in front of it. Some letters are caved into the wood, but neither John nor Sherlock have the patience to encipher them.
John asks, feeling grumpy. They have been walking through the castle for half an hour now, because Sherlock wanted to show him all the new knight statues they decorated for Christmas. His feet are getting cold, and surely at some time a teacher would catch them? John wouldn’t stomach more extra homework to make up for Sherlock’s many shenanigans. Not in his seventh year, when he should study all day long. Of course, the brilliant git just had to read everything once and be done with it, John isn’t so lucky.
“Who is we?” Lestrade inquired again, and Sherlock lifted his head. They had now reached the door. Lestrade stared at Sherlock’s beaten face for what felt like hours, and his intrigued face had turned into a shocked face.
John returned to the bathroom. Sherlock was stirring now quite a bit and mumbling to himself. The doctor undressed him (and he forced himself not to let his eyes wander too much). The ghastly socks made a weird sound when he dropped them to the floor, and something fell out. Something familiar.
found them, and after his near death on the battlefield he considered himself living on burrowed time.
The man says and starts the car. Mary appears on the other side and slips down on the seat next to Sherlock.
(2) Was their relationship even real, or had Mary planned for the beginning to do what, exactly. Blackmail John with her prisoner? Kill them both in dramatic fashion?
Only three years before, Sherlock would have gone to London, bought cocaine or heroin or whatever was available in the muggle underworld and shot up. His veins ache when he thinks about it. He had made a promise to his parents, Mycroft,
Sherlock stops for a second: “Maybe for you. No offence, but you look straight, and you’re also the star rugby captain and popular.
Sherlock is quick to shake his head. The last thing he wants is to be considered a stalker: “No, I deduced it.
What exactly happened between the two of them this evening? Of course, John must be the most interesting person Sherlock has ever encountered. A limping healer and
immediately pointed her small, black gun at him when he entered her hiding place, a cheap room with peeling wallpaper at a motel in the outskirts of London. Mary is sitting on an old bed, her handbag laying right next to her. There is only one window, but the curtains are drawn.
Sherlock stammers. Their hands are touching, and it feels very nice. If not for the spilled hot water, of course.
, who is telling him about the decorations he has put up. Sherlock’s attention is drawn to a specific person however, who is the last guest to appear at the entrance, smiling smugly when he notices Sherlock’s impressed face. John is wearing a blue gown which shines artfully, and he looks absolutely gorgeous.
This is how John finds himself, on the 18th of December, on the grand family room in the Buckingham Palace, holding the hand of the third heir to the throne of England.
To his credit, John pulls away and sits up again. He looks furious, and Sherlock heart beats faster at the thought that his anger is aimed at him, until John softly caresses his hair again (Sherlock loves it when he touches his curls). John is not angry at Sherlock. The blond prince will later tell him that he did figure out what happened to Sherlock in the procedure, and Sherlock will never see the doctor again.
John jokes, noticing Sherlock’s discomfort. Sherlock chokes on his hot cup of tea, and John claps his back until he stops coughing.
Sherlock is stunned in silence. John was worried about him, although Sherlock had thrown all these horrible accusations at him. John connected the dots himself and then went to rescue Sherlock from himself.
John says and carefully sets Sherlock back down. Sherlock glares at the cactus. He should have picked a different flower.

children. She is teaching them basic maths and science, but she enjoys the trips to London the most, where they are trying to pass as muggles for training. Irene loves studying the latest muggle fashion and enjoys showing off her skills in front of clueless wizards.
Sherlock decides he never had a chance. How could he not fall in love with this exceptional man, this John Watson, who stumbled into his life and all the candles suddenly burned much brighter?
Her thoughts got interrupted by a pained whisper from her captive. His bleeding lips were moving, saying JohnJohnJohn over and over again, like a prayer.
Then the tarmac happened, the near fatal overdose and the mysterious video from the criminal mastermind. One of
He marvels a bit at how normal this sounds in his head, while pretty much everyone normal would run away screaming.
John hugs him closer, feeling possessive: “Molly is still dancing with Greg, and they seem content. I still want your undivided attention for a while more.
“I know I have hurt you in the past when I didn’t tell you about the pregnancy. But if you come with me, we can try again! I can become truly pregnant this time, and we can finally be a happy family without all the burden of our old lives!
John had proposed to Sherlock last November, in his flat in Baker Street. He had cooked lasagna with enough cheese to make the prince happy and then went down to one knee.
John is kneeling in front of him. The doctor presses his hands against Sherlock’s cheeks and carefully inspects his bleeding eyebrow. The sight of lovely John, so murderous towards Sherlock’s enemies and so soothing towards Sherlock is the last thing the rapidly sobering up detective can take, and to his horror he bursts out into tears.
Their swords clanked back together. John rapidly moved his foot and managed to disarm his opponent. Anderson swore like crazy, and he took a step back to give the man some space. If the slave wasn’t prepared to work harder, Gregor would have to punish him. Gladiator schools were a bit like prisons for the fighters, they had to obey their masters, couldn’t leave without permission, punishments were regularly, and they were chained up at night, but at least there was better food here than the prisons. The schools were under a special kind of scrutiny right now after the former gladiator Spartacus with dozens of other fellow slaves.
“We are driving to Lestrade.” John explained and turned the key. The car came to life with a splutter. “From there, I will call your brother.” He noticed Sherlock’s disgruntled expression at that and snorted. “He can get you better treatment. You should really be in hospital, but we can’t exactly turn up there, with you being dead and disgraced and all that.” John didn’t try to keep the bitterness out of his voice. Let Sherlock get a taste of what he had done. Sherlock didn’t react to that and John saw that he had fallen asleep again. Well, sleeping would help with the fever, so John didn’t protest and instead focused on driving.
“John, I don’t know how you can ever forgive me, but you must know how utterly sorry I am. I did not mean a word I said to you. You are anything but useless, you are brave, smart, and kind. You risked your own life to fight a hungry werewolf. I don’t know anyone else who would do that.
The ghost wrapped the bandages around his head and picked up his lower jaw. He walked over to the window, and with every step, it opened further, so he could at last slip through. He cast one last look to
John decides to use Christmas Day to ask the Queen for permission. His mother already gave him a beautiful silver ring from his Grandpa. He knows exactly on whose fingers it belongs now.
Everyone started laughing, and Sherlock felt like eleven again, sitting in that empty train wagon, utterly alone, scared for what would happen. Until the door opened and a twelve-year old blond boy asked if he could join him.
again. John and Mary visited Sherlock for a few hours at Baker Street, but Mary wanted to attend a party at the house of one of her annoying friends. John was too washed up, a few thoughts of bitterness still left, and the giddy anticipation of finally getting everything he ever wanted (believed he should): the lovely wife and a house in the suburbs, a stable work at the clinic, but also a Sherlock Holmes, who took him on difficult cases, chases through the city, late-night take-out and violin solos. After the case was solved, John got to return to Mary’s open arms, satisfied and not bored. Sherlock ended up left alone, and John pretended not to think about it too much.
Sherlock forces himself to smile, and to control his quickly beating heart. He does have a dark secret, and after seeing that damned poster, he wants it to stay a secret from John even more.
That’s what scared him. He forced himself to move his hands out of Johns comforting grip and tried to wriggle out of his trousers.
I was "inspired" by the Q&A mockery from Moffat and Gatiss. They call the works of Arthur Conan Doyle their bible but have no problem writing a John Watson who cheats on his wife, who returns and forgives said wife after she nearly kills Sherlock, a John Watson beats Sherlock Holmes bloody, a weird redemption arc for an assassin, a baby that somehow disappears very often, a Mary Morstan who tells the boys it's not important who they are, and a stupid parody of the fandom-loved Garridebs scene. And I didn't even mention the Shutter Island and the secret sister who can do mind control like an X-Men and is apparently worthy of forgiving.
“We haven’t really kissed yet, and he would have to come here, since I’m rather tied to this chair. So, why should we do it at midnight?
"It would be only temporary, anyway. I do think I will be ready to date again, not right away, but in a while. Rosie needs a mother, after all. You will have us out of your hair soon enough."
. Sherlock wills himself not too panic, except he is absolutely panicking, because everything is too loud and too fast and John is NOT HERE.
Sherlock and John decided to drive to London in December. John wanted to see the decorations at Oxford Street and Sherlock wanted to go to the
“I thought, at least John is safe in London. Safe and happy, and he has finally the chance to build the normal life he always wanted.” Sherlock gasped in pain and clutched his stomach, as if he was trying to hold himself together.
John took one step closer to the bed, leaned down and, from what Lestrade could see, took Sherlock’s hand into his.
Their fifth Christmas, they went to visit Sherlock’s parents. John pretended to forgive Mary for her unforgivable action (
“Drugs, John. Muggle drugs, because their stuff is better. Heroin and cocaine, mostly. If you have heard of it, it pops up in their news frequently.
The Ghost of Christmas Past visits Mycroft. Together they travel through Mycroft childhood and discover a long forgotten secret.
He slips on his old seat next to Professor Flitwick, when he suddenly notices his new neighbour. How he did not notice him immediately is a mystery. The stranger must only be two or three years older than him, with blond, short hair and curious blue eyes. Sherlock nearly falls under the table from the intensity of this gaze alone.
Sherlock managed to free his shaking legs from the ground, turned around and walked away. His shoulders slumped in defeat, and he took a breath that came out as a sob. Thank god Mycroft had left Hogwarts a long time ago, he didn’t need to see his little brother brought so low.
lesson. For the last twenty minutes they get the brooms out, and the students chatter excitedly while they fight over the broomsticks.
"This is what happens when you only eat gingerbread for eight days.“ He says, feeling extremely smug.
I want you all to fly five rounds around the field, then fly a few times up and down if you want to. The last exercise will be throwing the ball to each other while flying.
Golden lamps were hanging from the ceiling, but a Christmas Tree was yet to be seen. Only Professor Binns was sitting at the breakfast table, completely engrossed in The Daily Prophet.
“If any of you ever so much as look at Sherlock or even touch him- I will rip out your skulls. Do you understand?
It’s quite cold in the dark cellar, and Sherlock deduces that he is held in an old coal cellar. How fitting, he thinks. Coal for bad children, and a coal cellar for the world’s only consulting detective.
Sherlock gulps. He walks closer to read the words written next to the painted werewolf on the poster. The werewolf
“As you can see, I have taken certain safety measures. I have studied your methods for month and prepared myself. I am confident that you won’t be able to gather anything worthwhile about this place or my person.“
They soon pass the civilization and discover the wood that makes up the biggest part of his kingdom. The many trees where John practised shooting his bow are still there, and John mourns the fact that Sherlock was never allowed out long enough (and without at least 10 guards) to play in the woods together.
Suddenly, something and very heavy settles around Sherlock’s head. An iron frame is set on his face, with two holes for him to look through. Then, another part is buckled around his mouth. Sir Walter pushes until Sherlock’s lips open with a gasp of pain, and something is slipped into his mouth, over his tongue, to hold it down and prevent him from speaking.
Sherlock had been eating gingerbread for nearly eighty hours now. So far, there had been no obvious complications, although he is starting to look a little green everytime he bits into another piece. At least there is enough room in the kitchen now, so John can make pasta. Sherlock leaves the flat whenever John starts cooking, and John guesses it’s because of the delicious smell.
He puts his right arm around Sherlock’s neck, careful not to jostle his injured arm, the left hand is used to carry Sherlock’s legs. John carefully cradles him close and pulls him up. While they make their way out of the basement, Sherlock starts sobbing uncontrollably. John’s warmth surround him, and he never thought he would have this again.
ran around and told every single student who is still at Hogwarts about their potion teacher being a dangerous animal!
Sherlock nodded quickly. Yes, he wanted this. John made him feel desirable and beautiful. Sherlock felt safe with him.
We have reached the end of this year's Whumptober. Many thanks to everyone who read, left kudos or commented, you always cheered me up and encouraged me to continue writing although my month has been exhausting.
“Lestrade please, we have to get in.” John pleaded. Although Sherlock didn’t show it, his wounds on his back must pain him immensely, and John still hadn’t had the chance to talk with Mycroft, which meant Mary was still walking around freely.
was going to be the new King one day, their wedding was way more pretentious and snobbish than John would have been able to stomach. The couple had just celebrated their sixth anniversary in April with a gigantic chocolate cake. Sherlock had made several jokes about his brothers sweet
The bell stopped running and it was replaced by the sound of a clanking noise, as if a person was dragging heavy chains behind them.
ripped out the IV tube which elicited a moan out of Sherlock. The detective began to shake in the narrow hospital bed, and John rubbed his arm and shushed him, promising him more pain killers at home. When John whispered something into Sherlock’s ear and kissed his forehead, Lestrade has to avert his eyes. The whole scene was so strangely emotional, so intimate, that he felt like a rude intruder.
The other interested buyer approached him. Up close, he looked quite sleazy, and he goggled at John’s property with obvious interest.
each other, exploring the other man. John caresses Sherlock’s curls, while Sherlock brushes his hands over John’s still well-defined muscles.
However, the Santa Claus that is now sitting in front of Sherlock Holmes, is not so friendly. He too wears the signature coat and the beard, although it’s more grey than white, but his eyes are controlled, calculating, cruel. He hasn’t come down the chimney either, and it’s not even Christmas Eve yet. Sherlock had spent days looking for exactly this dressed-up figure, and now he has found him, or worse, Santa Claus has found Sherlock. He found him, then drugged him, and when that didn’t work fast enough, he also hit him on the head. Due to that, Sherlock doesn’t know if this Santa possesses a sleight too, or just your average white kidnapper van.
threatened them with something, John didn’t want to know. No protest from both of them helped, they were to be married on the third of June 2018, in the small church at Windsor Castle.
“For Merlin’s sake, I have told you this a thousand times! For this potion to work, you must turn it left two times, then right. Repeat until it turns blue. Even a monkey could do it better.
Bank account. Helping his economically less fortunate students and stealing money from Mycroft (his brother is so rich he won’t notice) on one day. It is a treat.
John tries not to look at Sherlock’s genitals too closely, and he misses the green-blue fishtail, but overall, somehow, the boy is more beautiful than ever before. If only he would finally say something! John quickly chugs away trousers, socks and jumper.
Their marriage is supposed to hold the piece between the two kingdoms and bring their families closer together. Sherlock knows that his family is nowhere near as strong as the Watson’s and that they would have lost the war sooner or later. The Watson’s know that too, and that’s why he was sent to their kingdom to live there, and not vice versa.
One week later, he is sitting in the train and watching the sea disappear. One part aches for Sherlock, the other part is looking forward to being a medical student in London. Surely it can’t get
detergent, and Sherlock is filled with gratitude that he is in this small town with John and his family and a small garden, and not in the bustling city.
“Do you remember how I told you about my drug addiction phase, and how Wiggins died? Somebody bit me that night, though I don’t recall who it was.
Tomorrow, he will take the time to delete their accidental kisses from his mind palace. John clearly does not feel the same way, now probably even less that he knows Sherlock is a werewolf. Sherlock has more he ever dreamed off, there is no reason to endanger this.
“It is going well. I am knitting a scarf for him for Christmas. I hope it will resemble at least a bit the sign of Scotland Yard.
John sighed and scratched his head. It would have all been splendid, Mary and him, an exciting job, a lovely house. All certainly much better than John had ever expected, after everything that happened.
He sprints on quiet feet to Sherlock’s small room, isolated from the other bedrooms. Two guards are positioned in front of it, like every day, so John uses the secret tunnel to get into the room. It’s his usual method.
"I never anticipated he would mourn me that much. I thought he would move on. I never believed his moving on would hurt so much."
laughed as he watched Gregory throw a thick snowball at his younger persona, who tried to doge it, but failed. Their fight ended with
“That is… quite a brave statement, though not the strangest thing I have heard today. Do students still run into the Forbidden Forest alone? Surely, in some generation, the students will have learned better.
Mary’s taunting voice followed him into the floor, and every word she shouted after him hit like a dagger in his heart.
John presses a shy kiss on Sherlock’s throbbing hand, and it is like a demon finally leaves Sherlock’s body. Sherlock clutches John’s hand with the bleeding knuckles. John will stitch him up at home, then they will go to bed — together — and tomorrow they will finally talk about it all. And then they will kiss, properly.
Sherlock informs him. “It doesn’t show us, it shows our deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts.
Surprisingly, Mary had been good for John. She helped him see a liveable future again, and find some joy in his life as well. They worked a lot and visited Mary’s friends on the weekends. Mary went to her book club once a week and John stayed home and solved crossword riddles, which were probably the only riddles he would solve for the rest of his life. It was all terribly dull, and strangely comforting all the same.
How much time has passed since the evil Santa has cut the message into Sherlock’s skin? The detective can’t remember. The blood has long since dried on his skin, and the cuts have been disinfected by Santa. His kidnapper had ignored his painful gasps and just implied the disinfect or thoroughly.
John suddenly starts telling. “Just because that bastard shot him. A few millimetres down, and he would have never walked again.
The man finally introduces himself, and Sherlock shakes the offered hand. John’s hands are rough from the hard work, and they fit perfectly into Sherlock’s.
’s counting-house was open, so he could observe the work of his young clerk at all times. He had hired the boy, barely a man, a few months ago. John Watson may not have a Marley’s intelligence, but he was reliable and worked hard without complaining. John Watson was short, but strong, with blond hair and friendly blue eyes.
Sherlock says nonchalantly, while pouring Mrs. Hudson’s freshly baked Christmas biscuits into a fingerprinted blue bowl.
Sherlock giggles at this mental image. This whole scene feels like one of these romantic teenager comedies Molly is always forcing him to watch.
was sitting in front of a small fireplace. He looked a few years older now, and his hair has started greying. Two little girls were sitting next to his resting feet, playing with a doll and giggling happily together. The air was filled with the delicious smell of biscuits, and soon a young woman with light brown was walking in, carrying a full plate with treats.
Their gym is lovely decorated, with lots of balloons and lilac light. Their school band is talented too, especially the female singer. From what John had heard, she already has a scholarship for a drama school in London. A few more couples are dancing to the song, a few others are watching from the sideline. A gaggle of girls in long dresses have already separated themselves from their hopeless boyfriends and are now sitting in a group of chairs, pouting. The boys are standing in the other corner, tapping on their phones, waiting for the evening to be over.
John decided to show mercy and quickly beheaded the man. Some blood splashed on his armor and his face, but he ignored it. Clean and efficient, the other gladiator was probably a slave. He didn’t have to suffer more than necessary. The people loved him for his fighting skills and the ruthlessness in his aim, and he would not disappoint them. He grabs the head by the brown hair and lifts it up. Over the sound of his loud beating heart, he heard the arena explode, chanting his (made-up, Roman name).
John says, and Sherlock chokes on his hot chocolate. He starts coughing, and John leans forward and pats him on the back.
Mrs. Hudson is working at the busy counter of the small café, serving customers their teas, hot chocolates and strawberry muffins. She winks at him and drags a cup of steaming coffee into his direction. Sherlock thanks her, takes the hot cup carefully and walks with Molly to the shelves at the end of the store.
Mary had strapped him onto the table with long belts and ropes that cut into his pale flesh. She had discarded his ridiculous coat, his dark jacket and the polished shoes. The detective looked deliciously exposed without his armour. An IV bag with the precious hallucinogen was hanged on back of the chair and had carried the substance into his arm for over 50 hours now. Another one had been added to get some fluids into him. Mary didn’t want him to die too soon.
Sherlock muffles into John’s mouth. John’s tries to lift himself into a more dignified position, with his lips still pressed on Sherlock’s. John scrambles with his weak legs, while Sherlock has to figure out fast what to do with his hands or lips or is he supposed to use his tongue and oh dear, they both must smell of whiskey, and why did no one ever taught him kissing?
“You don’t have to worry about that, father. I’m actually one of the most active members of my team.
Sherlock closes his eyes to compose himself, and suddenly the events of last night come back with distant clarity.
Both Sherlock and John deserved more than that. The man was seemingly finished with it and Sherlock was a shaking and crying mess. It hurt so much. He felt ready to throw up. He felt empty and somehow too full.
At first, he thinks he has somehow hurt his hands when he fell down, because they were full of blood. Then he slowly realizes that it wasn’t his blood, and the body under him was not moving. He slowly crawls to his knees, not quite believing what his eyes see.
Ten year old Harry Watson screams while her little brother is gesticulating with a pencil in front of her.
The hunger is eating a hole in his stomach. Sherlock can feel it right under his skin, no matter how hard he curls his arms around his midst. He thought he knew hunger, but it was nothing like this. This is prolonged starvation in a closed environment. Mary has not offered him any water, so he has to drink from the toilet. Something he has to get used too, apparently.
He loved Mary. Not as much as Sherlock, never that, never the burning, all consuming, endless love, but still. It should be enough, it must be enough.
What were you thinking? Imagine how your parents and friends must have felt if something happened to you! We were all so scared!
, from where they brought new treasures home. John figured now is the perfect moment, and so he and Sherlock, a (secret) couple for two years, got married today. The Viking had worked long for this big surprise, and he cannot wait to show Sherlock!
Rumors about their friendship soon circulated and journalists began following John around London. He had long stopped talking to his parents, after they threw Harry out of the house, which the papers found about it. That were the worst headlines. Sherlock had apologized profoundly about that, but John also knew that this was the price he had to pay to be friends with this exceptional human being.
John stares at Colin Firth’s broad chest. Why is Sherlock so enthusiastic about him? The man is now over fifty, for goddess sake! Sure, he has great hair and a deep voice, but a lot of people had that.
“You would think that, but it still happens, often in the first weeks, when the older students prank the first years. At least the Forbidden Forest is no longer used for detention.
again and emptied his glass. He paced a few times around the room to clear his head and then sat down again.
It is the day after the full moon, and Sherlock has a headache. He has not slept a minute the last two nights. Instead, he scratched his skin in pain and threw up the glass of water he forced down his throat.
‘ was long before any of the characters did, but it was sweet nonetheless. Normally he only ever reads scientific books, not fiction, but Irene forced him to watch the film in cinema with her. The book was still better of course. The book was always better. Sherlock regretted it immensely that he didn’t pack The Song of Achilles (Molly called it a tearjerker) too. It would have given him something to do.
It was the morning of Christmas Day and at first it all went according to plan. Sherlock drugged all the Christmas party guests and stole Mycroft’s laptop, exactly as his brother expected. He and John had cooked up a plan months ago, while John lived at Baker Street to care for a slowly recovering Sherlock. John was to go along with Sherlock’s plan and get all the information
He would do it tonight. He would allow John to take his virginity, before John made the decision for him. John was well-built, a beautiful man. Sherlock had to believe he would not hurt him.
His dog tags. Sherlock must have taken them with him, wherever he went, and somehow, he managed to hang onto them.
Sherlock will curse himself for years after this hideous event that he was still surprised that Mary
John laughs and does another full turn. Sherlock is starting to get dizzy, but he wants to enjoy this overwhelming feeling of gratitude and happiness as long as he can.
John crosses his arms, his cane momentarily forgotten. This exact thought must have crossed his mind, and Mary hurriedly walks back her question. She suddenly opts for a very different tone.
One of the nurses was immediately upon him, pointing angrily at the dripping mess: “Look at what you have done!
Nothing in London had the power to crack open his cold armour. No rain or cold wind bothered him, no snow storm, no fresh spring breeze. When he takes one of his daily walks, no one ever enquires about his whereabouts, his health. No one ever invites him on a cup of tea. No one ever asked him for the time, or directions, or help.
Sherlock is pretty sure the whole school can hear the eruption of his heart: “For our whole lives? That is ambitious.
“You should be proud of me, I was so patient in my planning! So many fellow colleagues had tried to get their hands on you in the past, but they always ended up dead or in prison. I don’t feel too strongly about either of these options, and so I hoped than one day I would gain the perfect opportunity. And I was right! Two weeks ago I looked into the newspaper and saw a lovely obituary for your greatest protector.“
It’s the first time in days they have spent so close. The quarantine has been going on for several weeks now, and Sherlock misses his boyfriend achingly. At the beginning of the lockdown, John suggested ordering a switch and playing the new and very popular Animal Crossing: New Horizons game, and Sherlock accepted readily. The boredom has been nagging on him, and Mycroft returning home to their parents for isolation did not help either. At least Sherlock has the comfort and privacy of his own room. Mycroft’s children had been turned into an office space for their mother. Professor Elizabeth Holmes has been busy with zoom conferences in the last days, communicating with her students who are all spread around the country.
They thought he should say something. Sherlock could feel the shame pooling in his stomach. He hadn’t prepared something, hadn’t even thought about it. John had told him that everything would be fine and he believed it. Stupid! Of course everyone thought he would hold the eulogy. He was Mycrofts brother and he was there by his side when he died. Except he hadn’t been by his side. He had stood there, with weak knees and felt the powerlessness creeping in. There was nothing to comfort anyway, just a puddle of blood and a shattered brain.
"Oh John. I can't believe you really did that for me! After all the things that I have done for you, you finally paid me back."
left the office with one last wave of his arm, and a last greeting to the clerk, who returned the polite gesture.
Sherlock presses his fingers into his palm to keep himself from visibly reacting. It is just hair, it will grow back in time, except John loves to play with it while cuddling and Sherlock will look hideous for weeks.
John wishes he could shield Sherlock from all these prying hands, but for now, the door to the ambulance has to remain open.
“You could be bisexual, like Judy. Even Mr. Brown would notice immediately that you two love each other! Mrs. Bird says you need to get on with it.
When his father came home drunk, he turned violent. John and Harry would listen to their fighting, huddled together in their beds, clinging to each other under the bed cover. Their father would scream and sometimes throw plates, and their mother would cry. Every evening, rinse and repeat.
He packs a few glasses of marmalade as a payment and manages to survive the trip with the tube without any big accidents. 221 Baker Street is right next to a small cafe, and Paddington contemplates staying there for a while, but decides against it. He has more important stuff to do.
, the black is a classic choice, except Sherlock had ignored the rule and came without a tie. The teacher let it go, and John can admire his boyfriend’s neck for the whole evening. John had bought a yellow flower
John pointed at the couch and the man obeyed. The first hours were probably the most important in their relationship. He had to show his authority and lay down the rules. Fortunately due to his three years in the army he had learned how to play with the voice to give orders.
noticed immediately how different their connection was then, compared too now. Gregory had met his parents twice and obviously knew them from stories. The younger brother welcomed him into his private room without a second thought, and Gregory seemed at ease in it.
asked me if I wanted to plan the Halloween party this year. I’m afraid I’m terrible over my head with this task, so, would you be willing to help me?
to the man’s neck. He looked terrified at John, who was waiting from a signal. It was a relatively short fight, and the audience thirsted for more blood. Sure enough, the emperor gave him the sign to kill.
“I’m leaving for London. St. Bart’s offers me a scholarship, and it’s my only chance to become a doctor.
won’t be too upset — he does have a good explanation — and enters the Great Hall. Lots of students follow his way as he walks between the wall and the
“I’m going to keep you company for your last hours. I’m Santa Claus, and I’m bringing the presents on Christmas Day.
There is a loud noise and suddenly Sherlock is free. He hears John’s authoritative voice and the annoyance of the guests. They must respect his wishes though, because the crowd around Sherlock disappears, and he can finally breathe again.
Greg was forcing Mary to the ground, fingers searching for handcuffs he didn’t have on him. Mrs Hudson found a pair in her giant handbag, which John decided to ignore. Molly was standing between the groups, eyes shining with emotion.
gets up to get their drinks, and Sally, James and Anderson discuss the newest royal scandal. Sherlock does know a bit more about the wanderings of a young prince, but decides not to spoil their talk. John would not approve.
She whispers dramatically into Sherlock’s ear, and he recoils so fast that his shoulder bumps into Molly’s.
Santa settles in front of him. “I think the lack of fluids will be your end, after all, you lost some blood as well.
“I can see that. You should go freshen up, and Sherlock should go to his own room. You are both tired.
Sherlock stares at John’s angry eyes: “You have done nothing wrong. I’m just feeling a bit under the weather, that is all.
That’s all over now, he reminded himself. Time to look into the future, a future with this great, good-looking nurse. Time to be a good husband for Mary.
John lets out a heavy, painful sign. He remembers the agonizing night at the hospital, when the doctors operated on Sherlock, while John had to slurp terrible coffee and wait.
He demands shouting, and John laughs. Three more desperate thrust, and Sherlock spills all over their bellies, nearly sobbing with relief. John holds him through it.
“I can trick her. She won’t know I know until it is too late for her.” John said, his veins burning with the need for revenge.
, and a letter detailing the accident to their parents. They may attend the training, but for the next three lessons, they are not allowed to fly.
The doctor nodded, left the car and hit the door a bit too forcefully. Really, the people who think that Sherlock is only rude one have it very wrong.
Smith sneers, then puts the plastic bag over Sherlock’s head again. At the first two times, Sherlock was able to control his panic for a few seconds, but he is so tired now and immediately starts
Sherlock calls out, and a woman around their age appears. She has short, blonde hair, bright eyes and John furiously inhales when he sees her, his whole body turning into fight mode.
Their first Christmas, they threw a party at Baker Street. The whole flat was decorated, with lots of lights, cards and the skull wearing a Santa Claus hat. Sherlock played with his violin, and he seemed socially awkward, until Molly appeared, with that extravagant dress and her hopeless crush, and Sherlock absolutely destroyed her with his deductions. It all ended with an evening in the morgue, identifying Irene
“First, don’t let your house define who you are, or more importantly, who you want to be. You are still growing up, and so will your character change. Also, lumping every house member for something a few did is illogical. We can all agree on that. I will not accept any more fighting between the houses in my presence, is that understood?
Sherlock was a practical person. John treated him well, they can solve cases together. He gets food every day and a roof over his head. The gladiator hasn’t hit him so far, the horrible chains were gone. Sherlock told himself to look in the future. John could easily sell him every day, maybe to the brothel or to the mines. Sherlock would continue to make the best out of his situation. Running away was a suicide mission, and
holds the menu in front of Sherlock’s face and points at the different beverages. Sherlock can only stare at the long and detailed list. As a chemist, he is more than aware of the different clothes and taste liquids can produce. However, cocaine and morphine were always his drug of choice, and he seldom drinks alcohol.
His room is stuffed with homework to grade, plans for the upcoming lessons, notes for the Halloween party, a map for all their
John shows Sherlock the five villages that are all settled around the Watson’s castle. No light is burning, the birds are asleep, and there is only the howling wind, the sound Aidan’s hooves and their breathing.
“You sounded sad over the phone, and we are not breaking any rules right now. So I decided to come visit. I nearly got stuck climbing out of my window.”
John grabbed Sherlock, who was still lying on the ground. He sat on top of the thin detective, who barely struggled. His hands moved to the neck, forced Sherlock’s head back —
“Santa Claus thought my corpse would be a perfect Christmas gift. For you. He said I cause you pain just by existing.
Sherlock is already splashing around through the shallower part of the water. He sees John approaching and lifts his fishtail as a greeting. This always makes John smile.
Anyone would be more helpful than his parents, who talked about the weather, or his brother, who now scattered pizza crumbs all over Sherlock’s bed.
The door opens and they both get up. John offers his arm, and Sherlock gladly accepts it. The gesture is comforting and very familiar. They walk like this most of the time. Sherlock loves having John close, and vice versa. His other hand is clutching his walking stick, but he doesn’t want to poke anyone’s eye out, so he keeps it close to his body.
Everything is quiet when they leave through a small gate at the back. John waits until they are far enough before he speeds Aidan up. The black horse runs faster than the wind, and Sherlock slings his thin, long arms around John’s middle. They both enjoy the body heat. It hasn’t snowed yet this winter, but it’s still chillingly cold.
double-checked his door. The knocker had turned into a normal knocker again. He tried to pretend for a second that it was all a bad dream, but his father’s words still rang in his head. There was nothing he could do now, and he felt unbearably tired. He stumbled with weak knees to his bed and immediately fell asleep.
The wolf raises his head and breathes in her perfume and his body spray. The human inside of the wolf is gone.
Friend. Sherlock does not have many of those. There is Molly, Irene and Janine of course, with whom he spent his time at Hogwarts together. They still write regularly to each other, sending their owls back and forth. Molly is busy with being a healer, Janine has a nice position at the Daily Prophet, writing the gossip comments, and Irene, as a fellow half-blood like him, is taking care of
Sherlock sniffs and pulls the blanket tightly around himself. John decides that the call can wait for another hour. What the detective now needs is some comfort.
John explains, and Paddington is fed up with this situation. These two are very stupid men, and he doesn’t understand why Mrs. Hudson never took action.
Surely this can’t be true. John loves him, he told him today when they woke up, while Sherlock shaved, and while John fried the bacon the perfect way Sherlock prefers.
“I know you are a volunteer gladiator, so I can’t force you to do anything, and I would love to have you a little longer at my school. After all, the people love you. Just choose a slave, any slave, to warm your bed tonight.
Silence. John could only blink. Who did he bring into his insulae? Sherlock had bowed his head and played with the chain connecting his wrists.
Sherlock closed his eyes. The nerve of this man, saying these seemingly comforting words while he sexually assaulted him.
John hold his breath for a moment. He wished he could turn around to Sherlock, see his reaction. His hands were sweaty in Mary’s. She let out a small awkward giggle, and some guests joined in. No one ever expected someone actually objecting.
I always think you can no longer surprise me with your brilliance, but then you do it so effortlessly.
John had just spend all his savings from two years of fighting in the arena for a slave, who, while admittedly beautiful, may cut his throat tonight or run away.
John didn’t even spare him a glance, just stood up. He looked at Sherlock’s corpse like he was just another job done.
Except, it is not, because John can hear Mycroft’s helicopter and Sherlock is gasping breathlessly on the bed. And Britain’s most powerful media mogul is dead at his feet.
The snowflakes turn to water as soon as they touch Sherlock’s skin. He is burning up. Sherlock can feel the wolf clawing from within, trying to tear down his control over his mind.
They share a sweet kiss, and John inhales Sherlock’s special scent: salt, seaweed, whatever he uses to wash his hair and something uniquely Sherlock-y.
John cries, flings his weapon away and throws himself next to Sherlock. His hands are everywhere, tasting for his pulse, wiping the blood and the tears from his face.
When Sherlock was abducted from his homeland to an unknown destination, he knew his life was as good as over. There was nothing to return to anyway. His father had sold him to the slaver, a few months after
After — you — were — gone — I — went — to — a — witch — she — traded — my — voice — for — my — fishtail — and — I — landed — in — the — dirty — river — couldn’t — swim — got — caught — in — the — net.
John whispers to his smiling Paddington. “From bullies, or evil people like the ones on telly! And I can make sandwiches and tea, although
“I promised him I would stay with him no matter what, that I do not care about that, as long as he is with me, but I don‘t think he heard me. There was so much blood...
He was taught a different kind of agony in a dark cellar in Serbia, chained to the walls, being beaten to a pulp. Sherlock would never admit it, but he would have died in that cold room, his body forever gone, no closure for his parents, if it weren’t for his insufferable big brother.
John says reassuringly, “But did anything happened afterwards? I only remember Mary tugging me into bed, and you were gone.
He told himself that Sherlock will be fine. He still had Molly and Irene, his two mermaids friends, and after a while, the merman would move on. Hopefully, Sherlock will find a new boyfriend, although this image is enough to make John grind his teeth in anger.
Sherlock wouldn’t shut up, so she slapped him, hard. The name changed into another snivel and there were now goosebumps on his arms. Mary sighed and got up again to get a towel. She wrenched his mouth open and pushed it into his mouth, tapping him of with tape. This would shut him up, she just had to be careful if he started to choke.
The fireplace is burning, and Mrs. Hudson is bringing more crisps up the stairs, Mrs. Turner follows with more champagne. John and

could see the empty look in his eyes, like his whole world had just ended in front of him — and then John, with a fast move of his hands, snapped Sherlock’s neck.
Who ever invited plastic bags should be in prisons. These stupid bags litter the ocean, the beaches and every pavement in the city, and right now it is fashioned into a dangerous weapon
“I guess you want to know how I did it.” Sherlock said, sitting up. At last, he seemed eager to show off his brilliance.
god, it’s killing him. Normally, he would use this sensory overload as an experiment, but right now he just wants to get out of there, be back in John’s arm and breathe fresh air.
He spends most of the hours on Mrs. Hudson’s sofa with his head buried in his book. Other people his age are going to parties, travelling to distant places, Molly is meeting her friends almost every day outside of University. It is another thing Sherlock doesn’t want to admit, but making friends has never been easy for him, and as a consequence, he is lonely.
They are kissing again and walking backwards, until Sherlock’s knees hit the bed frame, and he falls on his back.
Greg swallowed, his eyes flickering over to John and Sherlock, who still haven’t moved. Mary cocked her gun.
It was supposed to be a normal meeting between the two siblings.Mycroftt had texted him to meet him at the Diogenes Club, alone, and Sherlock had grudginglyy complied. He figured that his brother probably found out another terrible lie from Mary and was this time soconsiderated to leave it to Sherlock to break the news to John. He should have questioned the text message. Shouldn’t have come alone. He wasn’t that stupid after all, but Mary always brought out the worst of him.
Sherlock mumbles and hurries out. He disappears into the crowd, and wishes he could fully disappear as well.
“Shut up, or I will force you to. Not that they would have a fighting chance against me. After all, teachers at Hogwarts are exceptional at their craft.
Sherlock says and takes John’s hand. The other man swiftly leads him down the stairs, and the two walk on tiptoes around the teacher’s lounge. The party music is clearly audible through the heavy doors.
The thief was caught by Scotland Yard, and Sherlock would have never survived the shame of that if he did not have to concentrate on getting John’s head checked out.
Sir Walter pushes him off the metal chair and wraps an arm around Sherlock’s shoulder, like the mock embrace of a lover. Sherlock tries to protest, to get Walter’s touch away from, but of course no sound emerges from his closed-off mouth.
Sherlock blushes wildly and flees out of the door. This hadn’t been the first round of teasing, and to be honest, Sherlock wouldn’t mind being John’s most important person. John is two years older than him and started primary school this year, and Sherlock is terrified at the thought that John may forget about him, now that he is one of the grown-up boys.
At the hospital, he walks right through the long queue of worrying family members and friends at the reception and continues his way through the hallway. On the stairs, he encounters a young woman, whose waitress uniform is completely grey. She is being helped by her girlfriend, who rubs her shoulder while the waitress sobs quietly.
It may be difficult to describe, but with John, right here in this bed, after making love for the first time, Sherlock has never felt more settled.
“Allen Mark's mothers will have something much more gruesome as a punishment than we can come up with.

slave tried to get away, but the inspecting man only laughed at pressed his waist back against the stack.
Sherlock dissolves into giggles, the bed vibrating under them: “I know I don’t get a say in this considering the name my parents choose for me, but
Her hands slid experimentally down his trousers. Nothing above average, but her touch clearly sickened him, and that made gleeful. She grabbed his limp cock and tugged a bit. Mary didn't want him to get hard, to receive any kind of pleasure from her. She didn't have to worry. The man jerked again and tried to throw her off, but his legs only buckled against the restraints. She slapped him, once, twice, a third time, until he stopped and sacked back. Tears were running down his face and his lips were moving. No sound came out of it. Mary laughed. Sherlock looked broken like this, with that messed up hair cut, cut lip and drugged for days. She had done this in such a short time. It was too easy.
Sherlock pushes his head between John’s neck and shoulders, listens to his slowly breathing lover and closes his eyes.
„Are you satisfied with me?“, he asked John. The gladiator chuckled and rolled his hips a bit, so the cock in Sherlock shifted to the side. Sherlock purred.
Unfortunately, the universe or at least the airline did not much care about that, because John’s flight is delayed. John told him before take-off that Sherlock could wait at home for him, but Sherlock did not accept that. They only had a precious time span of three weeks, and he would be damned if they wasted a single second of that because of a traffic jam.
At this, the spirit startled him with a loud scream and started making horrible noises with his chain.
One soldiers yells, and both Sherlock and John blush. "Sherlock Holmes, you are a lucky man!" Someone else shouts.
Their noses bump into each other as they kiss again, and John carefully pulls out. Answering Sherlock’s disappointed whine, he rolls them both on their side and hugs Sherlock closer to him.
With a sigh Sherlock turned around: “Yes, John. I have finished the difficult task of cleaning your stuff. I do am capable of simple housework.
far as weddings went. Not that he wanted to be involved in the planning process. Mary made most of the choices, while Sherlock brought dozens of options on the table for every little thing. John had always been glad when Mary left them alone.
doesn’t want him on the underground, saying it’s too dangerous for someone like him. He would have both off their heads if he could watch them right now. Thankfully, Mycroft didn't have his eyes everywhere.
shows off her high notes. When students are not present, the teachers at Hogwarts run a bit wild. Last year, Sherlock had excused himself early from the party, not really knowing his colleagues then. This time, he is determined to enjoy himself and stay until the end.
sport course in every free minute they had left. Meanwhile, the lessons have begun in earnest, and Sherlock has read through his students homework all week-long.
Why is nothing happening? Surely Mary would have figured out by now that his dear brother does not answer to blackmailing. That would be accepting defeat, something neither of the Holmes brothers is capable of.
“I don’t like the party. I have to wear a tie, there are dozens of photographers and journalists, and they will follow every step John and I take.
Sherlock notices for the first time that he shut his eyes in the chaos, and now slowly opens them. To his surprise he finds that the small bathroom is completely crowded. The nervous barkeeper is blocking the door,
She commands him. He does as he is told and hopes their destination will have a fireplace. It is October, after all.
The stairs move again (cue a bunch of screaming first years) and Sherlock concentrates back on his moving feet and not on his miserable school-days, which are long over anyway. As a teacher, he can ensure that today’s students will enjoy wonderful years at Hogwarts, and that is what counts. He wonders if John is having difficulties moving around Hogwarts with his cane. Another reason to hurry up with fixing it.
The sky is growing brighter when they reach their destination, and John lets Sherlock down. They both enjoy the amazing view for a bit.
"Because all I ever do is hurt people. So many people died in Moriarty's game because I wasn't fast or smart enough. I jumped from a roof and faked my death and let my best friend grief me almost to his own grave for two years. I killed a man, frankly, he kind of deserved it. It's my fault that Mary died. I provoked her murderer, and she shot Mary. I threw myself into the drugs, again. It's my fault that Rosie will grow up without a mother. It is my fault that John is broken. I destroyed this magnificent and strong human being with my own selfish actions."
Sherlock gladly accepts the invitation, and the nice shower washes the last reminders of his bad dream away.
There was a long moment of silence, where they both pretended not to notice the single tear rolling down Sherlock's face.
Sherlock crumbles the letter and drowns it in his orange juice. His barn owl Athena happily takes a sip from it, then flies off again.
He answers. Sherlock does not mention that he received it for his continued sobriety, and the two teachers join the students in the air.
Mary knew she needed a joker to survive in this doomed marriage between her and John Watson. Not that she doesn’t love John — she does, in her own twisted way, but she loves her chosen life more - but sooner or later one of the Holmes brothers (probably the older one) would find out about her not so distant past, and she would be in desperate need of protection.
looked closer, the ghost was constantly changing his presence. Once it had twenty arms, then three legs, then he was very tall, then he was very small. No outline of his body was ever clearly visible.
Sherlock pressed his face into John shoulder. The doctor cupped his head with his strong hands and caressed his hair.
“Ah, you see Doctor Watson, I actually want to murder Mr. Holmes. That is part of my plan, and it is going pretty well, don’t you think.
John knows that Sherlock and Mycroft were meant to meet at the café, and he wonders if what he is listening to is a world without Mycroft Holmes’s influence.
“Of course, but you have to explain everything to me.” Lestrade exclaimed cheerily, and then led them both into his flat.
“I miss you so much.” Sherlock whispers into the darkness of his bedroom. “I really want to kiss you.”
John observes every movement in Sherlock’s face. The otherwise so controlled boy stands in front of the mirror, looking absolutely wrecked. His lips open slightly, and his eyes may shine because of the light, or because of tears. He cannot seem to look away either.
Sherlock hears two quick punches being thrown, then the fan, who clearly does not quite get the dangerous situation he is in now hisses: “You must be the
god, the Mirror is right. Of course, this is his heart desire. Him at Sherlock side, not only as friends, but as boyfriends, husbands, partners. Forever.
“You really thought you could stop me, Sherlock? Look at you, crying on the ground. I do not think your brother would be very proud of you at the moment.
Sherlock lets his eyes wander over the Iron Maiden standing in the corner, the pillar and of course, the rack, right in the middle of the crowded room. There are no windows, and the air is chilling.
Sherlock groans quietly and forces himself to sit upright. His hands are still shackled in front of him, so freeing himself from that will at least keep him occupied for the next hours. Other than that, the tiles in his cell are cold and blindingly white. The only furniture in the cell is a small toilet bolted to the wall. At least there is that comfort.
Sherlock shudders at the thought of sleeping seven years with five boys together who probably hated him. Awful. The
„Oh, Sherlock. My dear sweet brother, I remember you now! I taught you how to walk, and we played in the garden together!“
Sherlock says and tries finding the flower and ripping it out of his curls, but a warm hand on his wrist stops him.
Sherlock can feel the grass under his feet and hurries up to reach the loud boys celebrating (he is assuming that they must be their rugby game), when strong arms all of a
"I’m sorry they did that to you, and I’m going to kick their asses for that. Or even better, I will tell McGonagall and she will do it. You know how much she likes you. And if you want, nothing needs to change, we can just continue being friends. There is no pressure from me at all, I just want you to know how much I treasure you.“
Maybe, but I did not really listen. I know because you cut your meat with your wand with a precision that is unusual for, let’s say, an accountant. There is of course your caring nature, with becoming a teacher and all. You used to be an
drunk, but everything is intact. The potion is still hidden, and his secret is nowhere documented. There is no way Mary will ever find out about this.
With both of them temporarily back at home and Sherlock having to isolate, this only left Animal Crossing.
Gladstone feels his fur stand up. He does not fully understand what John is saying, but it sounds scary.
Of course, slaves were a very important part of the Roman Empire. They were everywhere, working for their masters, running orders, or simply waiting for them to come to bed. They had no citizens right, could always be sold and bought again, could be branded and chained and whipped and killed without any repercussions for their owners.
He says. “Santa Claus was a dangerous lunatic who killed three people, then nearly killed you. He thought he understood our relationship from the yellow press, but that is impossible.
Thankfully, Lestrade buzzed them right in. The detective inspector was waiting for them at his door, and his eyes widened when he noticed them approach.
A sudden and LOUD bang erupted into the room, and a second later strong arms caught his shaking legs and heaved him up. Sherlock was finally able to breath again. One of his eyes was full of fluids. Blood?
John waves Sally and Stella goodbye, and they are off into the London night. Sherlock presses his side into John’s, still waiting for his quick heartbeat to calm down.
They both sit there for a while until the nurse is back. He throws an annoyed glance at John before busying himself with their patient. John can’t be bothered.
“The business! There I was, working for hours, when I should have spent these hours with you, and your mother! My family should have been my business, the city, the country, all those poor souls on the street! But all I could see was my own fortune.
“The pipes, John. I tried knocking against it, using Morse code. Mary did not like that, obviously. That is how I got this.” He pointed at his split lip. “And you never seemed to hear me.”
it is “A necessary task and only a bloody fool would allow students to work on a stained and possibly dangerous desk.
didn’t know what to believe. He let his eyes wander over the body standing before him time and time again, but Marley didn’t disappear nor did he change. His dead eyes stayed, as did the cold wavering from his body. This defied all scientific logic. Surely his dead father couldn’t really be there?
John jumped up as well: “So what? They nearly tortured and killed you too!” He screamed into Sherlock’s grey face.
He is aware that Sherlock is incredibly nervous, maybe even scared, off the wedding, the celebration and what comes after, meaning their wedding night. Sherlock was always seen as an unwilling guest, the son of the enemy, and aside from John and Mrs. Hudson, their cook, the Scottish weren’t nice to him. John is determined to change that attitude tomorrow. Nobody will treat his husband as anything less than Sherlock deserves, and Sherlock deserves everything. John will show it to him today.
Indeed, one of the flatowners who live directly next to the Tate Modern Viewing plattform, is gesticulating. His mouth is moving, but the wind is too loud to hear anything.
John could glimpse Harry, who was waving at him from the first row, where Sherlock’s family would also sit. They also invited some actors and other celebrities in the hope to make the whole event less serious and more modern.
Sherlock whispers. His shaking grows worse. “I was angry at him, because he didn’t inform us sooner about Mary and her connections with Moriarty. I was absolutely furious, and I said a few terrible things. And now it’s too late.
Maybe something happened and John had to get out of the plane last minute? Maybe Sherlock read the message wrong and John is taking a later flight?
“Yes, you see, Mom and Dad are not home often, and they can be not very nice, and I think we both need a friend.
“Hold still, or you’ll mess it up. John Watson will be so disappointed in you if you ruin his Christmas present!
His task today was copying letters, and he had to wear his thickest coat while he worked, since he was not allowed any more coal.
Only one hour beforehand, the first year students had set off on their boat ride over the Great Lake. It has been a long tradition for the school and is beloved by the first years. They would have seen Hogwarts for the first time, and Sherlock still remembers exactly how enchanting that felt for him; he experiences this feeling every time he walks up to the castle. Only now, he sits on the other side of the Great Hall, at the long teacher’s table under the ever-changing sky of the Great Hall.
Right, waiting here is useless. He just has to get himself together and find the exit on his own. With his determination back, he pushes himself of the wall and slowly but surely starts walking. Now that he is going in the same direction as the people getting off the train, it’s decidedly easier.
It makes Sherlock’s stomach flip, but the utter delight on John’s face and the feeling of John’s strong arms around him makes the trip through the cold forest entirely
