Shaking his head, never leaving Castiel’s gaze, Dean interrupts him, “No, I just want to hold you for a night. That’s all I want to do.”
“I’m happy for you,” He answers, looking over at the trailer with all of his shit in it. Feeling as if the world is completely fucking him over, Castiel turns back to Sam and lets out an impulsive and slightly anxious laugh, “I can’t believe I’m back here.”
“It could slip,” He screws the cap back on the bottle, looking over at Sam. “We could get caught. I think if someone were to catch us, Dean would take the easy way out.”
“Alright then,” Dean bites his lip, trying to distract himself from the gorgeous human being in front of him. He’s about to reach for the doorknob when the door swings open, hitting Dean in the face. He jumps back and brings a hand to his nose, feeling blood trickle over his top lip, “Fuck me.”
When the tightness in his chest overcomes him, Castiel doesn’t resist the urge to surrender. He cries until the embers reach his fingertips, and then he lights another.
They walk along the piers for an hour, until Dean says they should head home and Castiel knows the date was a bust.
Dean peeks over at Castiel and lets out a groan as he rests his head on the steering wheel. They’ve been sitting in the car for over five minutes.
There aren’t words to argue against that. Quietly, she mumbles, “C’mere,” and pulls him to her. Resting his head on her shoulder, she says, “I think you deserve to have this one thing, Dean. You give so much of yourself up to make everyone else happy. Just do this one thing for yourself.”
Dean’s eyelids suddenly become too heavy as Cas starts pumping his fist and twisting his wrist in a teasingly slow rhythm that makes Dean’s hips jerk with anticipation. Dean feels Cas wiggle his body down and take him into his mouth without hesitation or warning. The feeling is almost foreign to Dean; it’s been so long. His entire body involuntarily shudders when Cas swirls his tongue around the head and bobs his mouth down, only to come back up with hollowed cheeks, continuing with an expert rhythm.
“My editor wants me in the city by Friday,” Cas replies, his long fingers expertly navigating the keys on his laptop as he turns his head to face Dean. “We could leave on Thursday morning and come back on Sunday.”
“It’s a surprise,” Dean winks and the engine roars to life. Every few seconds Dean glances nervously at Castiel.
“I’m not gonna hurt you.” Closing his eyes, Dean kisses the corner of Cas’ mouth and mutters, “I won’t even look if you don’t want me to.”
Tipping his head back and resting it on the lockers behind him, Castiel exposes the long column of his throat, “I thought I might be able to catch you in uniform.”
Ten minutes later, the game has started and Dean’s up to bat. He skids to second safely and smiles at the second baseman cheekily. The game moves on gradually, just like all the other games this year. Baseball isn’t as much of a rush as football is, and maybe that’s why he isn’t as interested in it as he is with football. It doesn’t really matter anyways, Dean’s not getting a scholarship for baseball.
Dean had dropped the ball, and Cas wasn’t certain if he was upset or relieved by the lack of follow through. Before he had left, Dean promised Cas that he would call, but so far, his phone had been remarkably silent. Maybe it seemed quieter than usual because he had become fixated on it, looking over at its dark screen every few minutes only to find disappointment mixed with relief.
Despite Dean’s encouragement to try drinking the night before, it still takes him by surprise when Dean comes back to the motel with a little plastic bag full of marijuana. Castiel is still nursing his hangover, sipping on his third cup of coffee, and waiting for the Ibuprofen to kick in.
When he lies down beside his boyfriend, Castiel finds that he feels completely at ease. They intertwine their limbs and close their eyes. Drifting off to sleep, their breathing patterns unite, and their heart beats harmonize. If Castiel didn’t know any better, he might say that he feels whole.
Dean laughs outright, the sound racking through his body in a gust of air. It is not the same sound that Castiel has grown so fond of over the years. The timbre of it is hollow. Castiel grapples with his new limitations. When the laughter dies away, they are struck by their inability to do much of anything useful to remedy the situation. And, perhaps, that is why Castiel decides to take the lead.
He could easily get out of the car, sprint up the front steps and knock on the door. He could ask if Cas is there. Dean could ask if Cas wants to go to the beach with him. Before he can stop himself from thinking of it, the image of a seventeen-year-old Cas sobbing in the rain beside their little spot by the bay comes to mind.  Dean will never forget the way Cas ran along the side of the Impala as John Winchester drove Dean away. How utterly wrecked Cas looked, pounding his hands on the window and shouting,
Across the room, his cellphone rings, tearing Castiel away from the thoughts racing through his head. When he pulls the phone from its spot on his bedside table, his stomach flips at the sight of the Caller ID. A little too eagerly, he flips the phone open and smiles, speaking into the receiving end, “Hello?”
Once again, he inches further into Dean, biting at the flesh of Dean's shoulder to muffle his groan. He pauses again, letting Dean adjust to the intrusion. After another minute, he mumbles, "Ready?"
As Dean heads upstairs, he can hear them arguing, then a smacking noise and the angry grumble of the usual “dumb bitch” followed by a quiet whimper from his mother. At the top of the stairs Sammy stands, wearing a ratty old t-shirt that used to be Dean’s and some boxers. He glances at Dean before looking past him and down the stairs.
. By the end of it, the room is in tears, and Dean wipes a few stray droplets from his own eyes, clapping along with the rest of the crowd. When the clapping subsides, Castiel takes a deep breath and chokes out, “When I was fourteen, I didn’t think that I’d ever be happy. Hell, I didn’t think that I would live to see my eighteenth birthday. But here I am, loving my life and still breathing in every second like the very air I take in is a blessing. I’ve been through a lot but writing this book and honoring the lives of my two foster siblings, Meg and Andy, my adoptive mother, Ellen, and my partner, Dean Winchester, makes it all worth it. Thank you all for coming here to support me today. I am eternally grateful.”
“Speaking of fun,” Sam raises his eyebrows, quickly changing the subject and looking between Dean and Cas nervously. “We have an idea.”
Dean meets his gaze before turning to look over at Gabriel and Jo, "Ellen wants you guys downstairs."
“I like these two,” Jo slides two pictures across the countertop and turns her attention back to the soup cooking on the stove.
“Happy birthday dear Castiel!” The crowd choruses as Ellen walks into the room, placing a yellow birthday cake with candles sticking out of it in front of him. They continue singing as Castiel waits awkwardly for the song to finish. What else are you supposed to do when a group sings 'Happy Birthday' to you? “Happy Birthday to you!”
“Fuck, baby,” Dean slides their mouths together, swallowing a moan that slips out of Castiel’s red and puckered mouth. “Gonna make you feel so damn good, Cas.”
There are no words to describe the anticipation of a sexual encounter, one that is desired and unforced. Castiel cannot explain how haunting it is to fear that he might snap at a single touch or movement that may just be too familiar. That's what he fears most: not being able to do it when he actually wants it to happen. He's scared of being incapable of simple human contact because he is so broken by Alistair.
“S’that right?” Dean smiles dangerously. He leans into Castiel’s space, pushing him down onto the sand and looming over him. Castiel barely covers the small groan that escapes the back of his throat when Dean eases a leg between his thighs, pressing against his crotch.
“Dean, can you go to the store for me today and get everything we need to make Thanksgiving dinner?” Mary walks into Dean’s room, carrying a basket of clean laundry with her. “I’ve made a list for you and I'll give you the money.”
Apparently, the Singers have a somewhat traditional Thanksgiving dinner. Instead of cooking the turkey in the oven, they opt out to deep-fry a couple turkeys in the fryer out back. They set up tables in the kitchen for the extra guests and everyone is supposed to bring something. Not only do a lot of the Singers' previous adopted children come over for the infamous dinner, but the Winchesters always join them as well.
And he does do it again, snapping his hips at the same angle and kissing Dean deeply. He runs his tongue over Dean’s and pulls all the way out before slamming back into him. He continues at a relentless pace while exploring every inch of Dean’s mouth with his tongue.
But Castiel can’t help noticing the way John is eyeing him. He also sees the way Dean stands taller, fixing his chin upward, when his father speaks to him.
Shedding his clothes until he’s down to his boxers, Castiel climbs into bed. He listens to the shuffle of Dean’s footsteps on the other side of the wall and wonders if he still has that joint Dean gave him tucked into the folds of his wallet. Snagging his jeans off the floor, Castiel rummages through the pockets and successfully locates the joint and a spare lighter.
Stumbling out of the bathroom, Castiel laughs when he runs into the edge of the bathroom counter, body loose under the influence of god knows what was in that needle. Rhea just handed him a little brown paper bag, and, in a flash, she was gone. The fine brownish powder looked just like it always does. But he’s starting to feel like this stuff – whatever she gave him – is not the same as what they’ve been using for the last few weeks. It feels dirty, coursing through his veins. Castiel wants to crawl out of his skin.
“I want to feel you inside me,” Castiel rasps, groaning as Dean slots their hips together, rocking into the initial sensation of their cocks sliding together through the thin veil of cotton briefs. “Wanna feel you cum inside me.”
He pops a tape into the stereo and adjusts the volume. Static clears into a guitar solo that Castiel recognizes faintly. It reminds him of lazy car rides and the taste of Dean’s skin.
After Cas goes home, Sam tries to ask Dean a few questions. Receiving nothing back except a few shrugs and a grunt, he decides to just leave Dean alone.
“There are plenty of other places in the city for your kind to do that,” The woman adds, turning her nose up.
“By the end of the summer, you’re gonna break it off with that fucking faggot or I’m gonna out your faggot ass to every single person I know, including your dad.” Dean’s about to argue, but Gordon hushes him, “No, listen to me, Dean. I’m doing you a favor, alright? I’m letting you have the rest of the summer to get this gay shit outta your system, but one way or another, it’s gonna end for the two of you. As for Cas, he can’t know about any of it. Got it?”
“You seem pretty certain that I’ll be taking your last name,” Cas hums, derailing their entrance and pulling Dean off to the side of the house, beneath the shadow of the Victorian home.
, Dean!” Cas exclaims angrily, gripping Dean’s shoulders so tightly he can feel it bruise, “You can’t tell anyone.”
Castiel swallows, his body constricting with nerves. His hands tremble at his sides, unsure of where to go or what to do. He can’t tell if he wants to reach out or run for the door, booking it to his own cabin.
“Gordon,” Castiel hooks a leg over Dean’s hip, grabbing Dean’s hand and placing it on his waist. “It’s nothing.”
“We’re glad you found us too, sweetheart,” She whispers into his hair, rubbing his back calmly. “Your biological father signed away his parental rights. We should be able to adopt you within the next few weeks, but if you want to meet with him before then, we can arrange something.”
Dean works his way up to Castiel’s mouth. When their lips finally meet, Castiel is afraid his knees might give out on him. Dean kisses him with the intention to keep going until neither of them can think straight. Castiel feels dizzy again, but for an entirely different reason this time—something to do with Dean using his tongue to explore every inch of his mouth. He grips desperately to the front of Dean’s shirt, knowing that it will wrinkle if he keeps clinging to it. He forces himself to push Dean away so that he can blurt out, “Anyone could come downstairs and see us right now…”
Castiel follows Dean and Jo into a house that is roaring with activity and buzzing with music. The sound roots itself in everyone’s veins and pumps them back to life after the long school week. Everywhere Castiel turns his head he sees something happening.
A minute later, a nurse appears and smiles wearily at the group, “She’s awake and stable. We did a quick check-up and a rape kit right away. She’s asking for Dean, now, if you would like to go speak to her alone for a minute.”
Darkness floods over him, heat penetrating through the pitch-black as he leans into the sensation of giving up.
Two weeks after the wedding, her organs began to fail. It all happened so quickly. One moment she was laughing and playing penny poker with Dean and Cas in the kitchen, the next day she was being put on an oxygen tank.
He walks to the bus stop and waits alone for the first bus. It will take him where he needs to be today, and that is all that matters. Once the bus pulls up, he pays the driver, a tired middle-aged black woman who asks, “Running from something?”
Castiel likes Bobby a lot. Sure, he isn't always around when Castiel has his breakdowns or when he wants to talk about the latest book he's been reading, but he is an excellent adoptive parent. He trusts Bobby, and that says a lot all on its own.
After everything is cleared and the dishes are done, Dean heads upstairs to find Cas sitting on the love seat of his bay window, his body pressed against the glass.
Pausing at the bottom of the staircase, Castiel regrets the executive decision he made to smoke his morning bowl on the porch rather than from the windowsill of his bedroom. The sky is too pretty – too open and endless – for Castiel to admire from inside the house, but is it really worth the trouble?
“If you don’t mind, Mrs. Singer, I have a personal question for you,” Castiel sneaks a quick look at Ellen, who is stirring something in a large pot on the stove. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Jo dash through the hall and up the stairs, yelling about a missing shoe.
Castiel swallows audibly, replying, "Happy Birthday." With a hint of interest in his eyes, Dean leans forward and breathes hot across the skin of Castiel's neck. He shivers, leaning into the sensation, "I’ve been watching you, too."
“Thankfully, yes,” Cas sighs, dropping his head in his hands with a tired groan. “I woke up at 5 A.M., and I’ve been writing non-stop for the last three hours.”
His teenage bedroom has changed quite a bit since the last time he lived here. Crossing the creaky floors, Castiel gazes out of the bay window only to find the Winchester’s colonial still perched prettily across the street.
“Are your grandparents wealthy?” He shouts down the stairs, waiting for Dean to answer. Nothing follows his question, so he retreats downstairs where Dean is stocking the fridge with groceries. “Did you hear me?”
Dean’s eyes tear away from Castiel’s, searching the wallpaper, a fleeting, exhausted ache behind them.
Castiel pushes on, trying his best to focus solely on the reason he came down to the basement. Toilet paper. Right. Get it and go. He rifles through the materials, but he can’t think of anything except the feeling of Dean’s eyes on his back.
Tossing back the meager remnants of his beer, Dean doesn’t hold back, “We’ll find the Colt and I’ll kill Lucifer. Or die trying.”
“Some people say the same thing about us,” Cas winks back at him, and Dean releases another crack of his joyous laughter, and then his lips are planted on Castiel’s. The kiss rocks through Castiel like a symphony. “Hasn’t stopped us.”
Skidding across the hardwood floors with his socked feet, Castiel wipes down the coffee table and turns to fluff the pillows on the couch even though he’s already done it once this morning. He’s about to check the spare bedroom for the third time that day to make sure everything is in its correct place when Dean’s hand snags his wrist and pulls him onto the couch.
He shrugs. He can’t change the fact that he only has a few pairs of jeans, five t-shirts, and one photograph to his name. Jo stands and begins taking the clothes out of his suitcase and placing them in the dresser.
Off in the kitchen, there’s a clatter of pots and pans and the rush of footsteps as Jo runs into the room shouting, “What’s wrong? Cas?”
Half the time they don’t know where Anna is. She comes back just as quietly as she goes, and she doesn’t seem to get into trouble for it. She’s a year younger than he is, but she seems to have been through just as much as he has, maybe even more.
Ellen stands, moving across the room to place a hand on his shoulder, “Well, I think you’re damn wrong about that.”
Reality pulls him down. Dean will be here soon, and that worries Castiel very much. The worry stems from the harsh reality that Castiel is really fucked up, and to fuck, he is reliant on getting fucked up to ease the process.
“I was accepted to Penn State on early decision,” Jo announces to everyone, passing the blunt to Sam. “I’ve committed there.”
The other boy stares at Dean. His eyes are hazy with fear and alcohol, a deadly mix. “No! You have to promise me that you won’t tell anyone. They'll send me back to the hospital and I won’t see you ever again and then what will I do? I can’t go back; he'll kill me like all the others and then what will I be? I’ll be
Castiel doesn’t have to turn around to know who it is. He doesn’t bother turning around, either. It’s best to just ignore him. But Gordon is persistent. He grabs Castiel’s shoulder and spins him around.
She watches him closely for a minute, scanning his face, then his hands and legs. He knows what she’s doing; she’s looking for a sign to tell if he is lying. Therapists always think you’re lying, even if you aren’t. To be fair, Castiel does lie to his therapists quite often.
In the hall, he can hear someone stomping up the stairs and walking towards his room. It isn’t much of a surprise when Dean cracks the door open and peeks his head in, “Hey, you busy?”
But that was last night, before Dean flushed every single drug Castiel has obtained in the last few months. And now Castiel can only focus on the possibility of getting high somehow.
"Fuck...we are so fucked up," Dean admits, holding Castiel tighter against him. "My dad had never hit me like he hit me that night." Pulling back, Castiel holds Dean's head with both hands and looks into Dean's watering eyes. "And after my mom brought me over here and I got all cleaned up, I just thought that I could never let him hit you like that. I know he would if he found out. He'd skin us alive."
“Well, my boyfriend and I are staying at The Library Hotel on Madison,” Castiel fidgets in his seat, feeling Balthazar’s eyes on him, analyzing. “We fly out on Sunday morning.”
“So, what’s the new charity case’s name?” The oldest boy tips his chin at Castiel, looking to Ellen and Bobby for an answer as they all take seats around the large oak table.
“All the time.” Castiel sighs, “It’s just different over there, you know? I think I might get an apartment in San Francisco since I can afford it – that way I can live in a city but also be close to mom. Plus, most of her appointments and things are in the city anyways.”
“No promises,” He groans, sliding out of the car and slamming the door behind him. He enjoys the exasperated sigh Naomi makes as she walks away.
Everyone except Gordon and Dean head out onto the center of the field. Leaning in close, Gordon whispers, “I’m watching you, Winchester.”
"Holy fuck..." Dean moans, feeling a white wave wash over him as he comes all over the leather upholstery.
Crawling up to the headstone, he rests against it, wrapping his coat tight around himself. In the distance an old man places flowers before a grave. Castiel curses himself for forgetting to bring her flowers.
“Like two months ago,” He mutters, ashamed for having kept it to himself for the last three weeks. “I ended it, and we’re not exactly on speaking terms. She deserved better; you know?”
She winks, getting out of the car. “Any time, Winchester,” She closes the door and walks back to the house, her red hair blowing behind her.
By the third song, they are both breathing a little faster than before, sweat shining across their brows. They slow to a stop in the middle of the room, their chests brushing with every breath.
Dean doesn’t deserve this. Dean deserves someone who can give him what he wants. Castiel can’t do that; he never will be able to fully do that.
“I’ll tell him later…he has a test today and needs a clear head. This will only make it harder for him anyway.”
Dean drops his head, murmuring into the hollow curve of Castiel’s shoulder, “Tell me you want me as much as I want you.”
But Castiel still feels as dirty as the murky waste coursing through the sewer pipes; his blood is tainted, defiled, disgusting.
“I’m excited for Thanksgiving,” Cas turns onto his side, curling into Dean’s chest. “It’s been a few years since I’ve had a Thanksgiving dinner.”
“Shut up!” Dean shoves her playfully, still cupping his bleeding nose with one hand, “I’m gonna go shower and then we can leave.”
He moans into Dean’s mouth and the other man lifts him into his lap, pinning him between his warm body and the cold leather of the dashboard. Dean’s hands roam over Castiel’s long and lean body, fisting Castiel’s shirt and deepening each kiss as they grasp at each other in desperation.
, but just so happened to be put right across the street from Dean Winchester. Thanks, God, as if you didn’t make it clear enough already.
At one point a large group of high schoolers comes in. Most of them are girls, dragging their dates into the store without a choice. Among the crowd is Gordon, who immediately zones in on Castiel and makes his way to the counter to annoy him.
Pressing their aching cocks together, Castiel gasps into Dean’s ear, “Make love to me like it’s the last time you ever will.” The statement leaves Castiel feeling raw and vulnerable. “Please…”
Oof, this chapter felt like a ~filler~ chapter while I was writing it but, now that it's done, I realize that it's actually a very important chapter in the grand scheme of things. I hope you enjoy reading it, because I spent way to much time on it, writing and re-writing it until it was perfect. By the way, there is a Spotify Playlist for this story! Go to the first chapter and check out the notes section for the link. I'm always adding new music to it while I write.
Slightly shocked, Castiel searches Dean’s face for something, anything that might give away a lie or an impending punchline. Instead, he’s surprised to find Dean’s supple lips pressing against his own. His left-hand tangles in Castiel’s dark hair as his right holds firm at the small of his back. Castiel melts into the kiss, the familiar chocolate-like taste of Dean’s warm mouth, the overwhelmingly rich smell of Dean encompassing him. The kiss is not forceful or urgent; rather, it’s a moment to relearn everything forgotten in the last decade.
“My God,” Castiel chokes out, passing it back to Dean with shaky hands. The world slows down and, abruptly, he’s moving in slow motion. “I need to sit down.”
His fingers curl around Castiel’s hips possessively. Lifting his head from Castiel’s neck, Dean moves in close until their noses brush. His eyelashes catch the light radiating from the bedside lamp. Each lash flickers gold, complementing the green of his eyes.
The sun is setting. Light is here, or it could be, in the empty corners and on the dust-covered tabletops. Flickering shadows sweep across the floor in slow motion, mirroring the trees that peer at Castiel from outside his window. Their rustling leaves call to him, begging him to bring life back into this body. But there is so much pain, here, in this room. Curled tightly around himself in a sweaty heap at the center of his mattress, Castiel shakes through the nausea and thinks he’d be better off dead.
“Screw this,” Castiel grumbles, flipping onto his stomach and burying his face in a fluffy white pillow. He inhales deeply, wishing that it smelled like Dean. It doesn’t, but Dean’s viridescent pupils swim in the darkness behind his closed eyelids as he drifts back to sleep. A memory? No, something more than that. Curled in on himself, Castiel’s breathing slows as he dozes off. And there is the feeling of an embrace, of closeness and comfort, of the warm press of palms on his ribs, of safety. And there is the calming scent of sage and mint.
In the end, Castiel must slide beneath Dean to reach a blue dot. It’s a precarious situation with Dean looming over Cas and slowly losing the strength to keep himself up.
“It’s not so bad,” Dean can’t hide his own blush, so he lifts his head to kiss Cas. The other man responds with a hum of satisfaction before pulling away. “This reminds me of that night we played Twister; except, this time you’re on top.”
No one will ever touch him like this; Castiel is certain of it. It will only ever be Dean – the man who can make Castiel come undone so delicately, without a sound, but thunderous in so many other ways – and he loves him for it.
Ten minutes later, Castiel tracks Dean down in the cleaning supplies section of the incredibly large store. With a huff of feigned exhaustion, Castiel tosses the batteries and flashlights he was sent out to find into the overflowing shopping cart.
When dinner is finished, they clear the table and wash the dishes together. Dean washes while Mary dries. He remembers how it used to be the other way around a few years ago but, now that Mary lives in a different house, Dean doesn’t know where the dry dishes go. So, Mary dries and Dean washes.
"You can't hate me forever," She spits, crossing her arms defensively over her chest. "It was once. Don’t blame this all on me, Castiel! It takes two, y'know."
“Oh my god,” He laughs, calling out to Lady Laz who has been sniffing the same fucking bush for about five minutes now. “Lady! C’mon girl, let’s go inside!”
Minutes pass, all the while, the pressure continues to build until Dean is afraid that he might burst. “Cas, I’m gonna come,” Dean grits out through a clenched jaw. He tries to push Cas away before he climaxes, but he won’t budge. Cas does that thing with his teeth one last time and it forces Dean into a shuddering orgasm, “Cas…oh fuck!”
“Well, so far, this experience has been questionable, so we’ll see if I ever get to the so-called ‘hard stuff.’”
“Mhm,” He hums, attempting to sound normal, but even he doubts himself. He’s worried if he opens his mouth that he’ll puke. He does it anyways. “Just a little car sick. I suppose that I’m still acclimating to the sensations of car rides as a human.”
“Already left for work,” Castiel answers without concern, allowing his hand to graze over Dean’s clothed erection. Castiel hums in appreciation of Dean’s budding arousal and presses his half-hard cock against the crease of Dean’s ass. Using his free hand, he tweaks Dean’s nipple with a slight amount of pressure and earns himself a groan in response.
The parking lot is empty, except for a few cars belonging to students who stay late for sports. The two boys climb into the Impala and Dean releases a heavy sigh. Turning his head, he asks, "What do you want to do?"
Their lips meet again, much softer this time, as if both were just craving the feathery feel of lips on skin. Castiel wishes for it to be rougher than this, because this feels too much like love, and Castiel cannot allow himself that satisfaction. Dead people shouldn’t feel love—it’s just not natural—but Dean’s hands glide their way up Castiel’s arms to safely perch on his shoulders, where Dean’s fingers play with the tips of Castiel’s dark hair. He can feel the urge to turn himself into something carnal, as if it might make the true emotions disappear, but he forces the thought away and focuses on being what Dean deserves.
Husky and panting, Cas chokes out, “You. Inside me. I need you.” Above him, Castiel’s hands fly to the bedside table, taking out a bottle of lube from the drawer and tossing it on the bed near Dean. A guttural moan escapes Castiel when Dean lowers his mouth around Cas’ cock again, hitting the back of his throat. He could spend hours doing this – working Cas up into a desperate and begging mess. Snagging the bottle of lube from the sheets, Dean slicks up his fingers and inches two fingers into Cas’ ass, savoring the tight and pulsating thrill with each passing second.
Pulling up to the beach, Dean parks the car. Sammy gives him a reassuring glance from across the Impala’s bench.
“Fuck, Cas, you’re gonna be the death of me,” Dean drops the condom instantly and clambers up the bed, hovering over Castiel’s body, slick with sweat. Castiel lifts his legs as Dean pushes the head of his cock into Castiel’s ass, gripping the younger man’s hips in his calloused hands. Dean lowers his head to kiss him senseless, murmuring, “Jesus Christ, you’re perfect. Every inch, every freckle.”
Swallowing hard and rubbing his hands together, Cas chances a glance at Dean, “So, we can't do anything to remedy our shitty situation.”
“I’m good, but I’m still waiting on that date you promised me,” She winks at him and looks to Castiel. “So what can I get you boys today?”
“You’re everything,” Dean hums with satisfaction when he lazily sinks into Castiel, gripping tight at his hips. He drops his head and catches Castiel’s lips in a hot, open-mouthed kiss, whispering, “I love you. I love you. Love you –"
He stares at her, exhaling deeply through his nose, and says, “I think I just went on a date with Dean Winchester, and I didn’t even fucking realize it.
“You better be Cas…” Dean mumbles grumpily, his eyes still closed as he stretches out his hands to Castiel’s chest and pretends to be groping for boobs. “Oh honey, you got implants?”
Stepping out of his jeans that are now pooled at his feet, Castiel takes small steps until he is standing directly in front of Dean. Dean spreads his legs so that Cas can wedge himself in between them. He places his hand on the soft skin of Castiel’s hip and exhales with relief, rubbing his thumb over Cas’ protruding hipbone. He trails his index finger over a scar that rests just above the bone.
“I know,” He watches Cas’ hair ruffle with the gust of wind and says. “Cas, I want to help you. You don’t deserve the shit you’ve been through, and I’m trying so hard to make you happy. I didn’t think it’d get this serious. Hell, I thought it was a one-time thing, but I think I’m falling in—“
“Baby, I need you,” Dean whispers, voice low with hurt and uncertainty. “Wanna feel you. Want you to touch me, please.”
With a soft sigh that earns him a sharp side glance, Castiel flips the sign. He knows that no one is going to come in for another hour or so, but he turns on the stereo anyways. Drumming his fingers on the table, he picks up his backpack and pulls out his book.
For the next few days, Castiel avoids Dean. He leaves for school early, so Dean won't pass him on the drive to school. He takes longer routes to classes, so he won't run into Dean in the halls. In math, he gets there just before class starts and leaves immediately after it ends. Instead of eating lunch with Jo and the others, Castiel now sits in the library, alone. Sometimes Dean stops by the Singers' after school, trying to catch Castiel, but he always misses him; Castiel is smart enough to leave for a walk exactly at the time Dean arrives.
“Say that again when you’re dying of hypothermia with a side of frostbite,” Dean jokes, holding out his hand and helping Castiel out of the snow. “Let’s get our stuff inside and then we can come back out again later.”
Hissing through his teeth, Dean starts at a slow, dragging pace, taking his time finding that sweet spot within Cas that will make him squirm and beg for more. It’s not long before he angles it so that nearly every stroke hits Cas’ prostate. Beneath him, Cas meets Dean’s thrusts and grinds his hips, not even bothering to stifle the obscene noises coming from his mouth. Taking advantage of the bare skin before him, Dean ducks his head and licks his way up Cas’ neck, feeling him writhe.
He hears the tell-tale sound of a condom wrapper opening, and Castiel manages to collect himself enough to breathe out, “I’m clean – I mean, I had STD testing done a few weeks ago, and I haven’t been with anyone…”
“So, you are okay waiting?” He brushes his fingertips along Dean’s stubbly jawline, “I don’t know how soon or if I will ever be able to do the things that you want to do.”
The taller boy scoffs and looks down at his feet, crimson coloring his cheeks. Castiel smiles and looks at Pam who winks and struts away, swaying her hips obscenely.
“Nothing I can’t handle,” Castiel smiles bleakly and backs out of the room, away from her touch. Shouting after him, Ellen stands at the bottom of the stairs as he takes them two at a time.
Castiel is well aware of the wealth in the community, but what's so refreshing is that these people don't flaunt it. Ellen and Bobby are well known in town for their work with kids, and Mary organizes monthly benefits where the money is donated to a random organization. These people actually care, and that's why Castiel finds it so endearing to live here.
Oceans. Dean sees seven seas in Castiel’s eyes. Divine and everchanging, but somehow still a constant hue of blue. Dean thinks he could spend his entire life exploring their depths.
Of all the heavenly rules he could break, he didn’t expect it to be this one. Falling in love with a human seemed like a long shot but, here he is, throwing caution to the wind and defying all orders from heaven to stay by Dean’s side.
The Singers stand and Ellen shoots forward to wrap Dean in a firm hug and whispers, “Thank you, Dean.” Bobby slaps his hand on Dean’s shoulder and cocks his chin over to Cas. Lowering his voice so only Dean can hear him, Bobby mutters. “Take ‘im with ya, okay? He don’t need to be seeing this.”
"Oh, please," Dean replies. "We both know that you guys won't get customers for another 30 minutes."
“Just kiss me, okay?” Cas orders, slipping Dean out of his t-shirt and reaching for Dean’s hands to bring them down onto the soft skin of Cas’ sides. Dean lifts Castiel off him, covering his naked lap with the towel from the floor. He stands and looks down at Cas, wishing he could say that Cas has fallen so far, but he doesn’t really know where Cas even started to begin with.
Wrapping her in his leather jacket that he finds lying in the backseat, Dean carefully cradles her in his arms as they enter through the ER’s front doors. The waiting room is nearly empty, with only a few random seats taken here and there by other people who look better off than the red-headed fallen angel in Dean’s arms. It’s a quiet night in the waiting room – not like that night Dean had to get stitches on his hand. That night was wild and bloody; pain had found its way into what seemed like hundreds of bodies, and he had waited for hours before getting his stitches. He remembers that night clearly. That was the first time he ever thought he lost Cas.
"Christ..." Dean involuntarily slips. He sounds absolutely wrecked already, his voice strained and low. He's even sitting on the very edge of the bed with his body leaning towards Cas even though he is clearly out of reach.
And then Dean’s door swings open and John drags his son out of the car and tosses him on the gravel road. Castiel freezes where he sits and screams, “Dean!” It sounds like thunder as John bangs on the roof of his car with his fist and roars at Castiel, “Get out of the fucking car you goddamn faggot!”
In the distance the bell rings, signaling the end of the lunch period. Cas leans over and kisses Dean chastely, “I’ll help you. Come over tomorrow and we can start a study guide for you. Okay?” The younger boy stands, straightening his trench coat and collecting his bag.  He smiles at Dean and heads out of the dugout, leaving Dean to wonder how he ever got so lucky.
Castiel is ashamed of his handiwork. His thighs are covered in clean, tiny white lines, the perfect size of a razor’s edge, and his chest still has the sliced X above his heart from the night Dean left him. It’s faded to a lighter, bubbled pink. Every time Castiel looks in the mirror, he is reminded of all the days and nights he spent aching for Dean, wishing that he could hold him but convincing himself that he would never be given the opportunity again.
She forces herself out the door and onto the cold street, wondering which way she should go first, but it doesn’t really matter. There is no map to finding lost kids.
Dean sits limply, still and glassy-eyed. His cheeks are red, hands loose in his lap. The walkie talkie has been discarded, uselessly laying on the seat beside Dean.
“Honestly?” Cas huffs, “The first draft is almost finished and, once I write the last two chapters, then the next few months will be spent working with Balthazar on the edits before we send it off to marketing and the copyright team to get it ready for the reveal. My publicist is hoping to have the book launch party in December.”
“Sure, sure,” He exhales violently, throwing his hands to his sides in frustration. He looks to Jo, “You okay to take the rest of them home?”
“Yeah, well, I’m just crashing the party for a second.” He waves his hand in apology, “I actually gotta head back, shower, all that jazz. I just came to drop off Bobby’s truck.”
“Dean, I need to speak with you after class,” Mr. Henricksen hands Dean a graded paper and continues down the row of desks, handing back papers as he goes. Dean doesn’t want to flip it over. He already knows it’s the test from last week, and he knows that he failed it.
Castiel gracefully glides back to his seat and settles himself once more, glaring at her with utter contempt. He answers, “Do you ever become bored with weaseling your way into other people’s minds?”
Dean turns his head to find Anna standing beside him, her grin wide and her eyes glassy. He smiles down at her, “Hey buddy. What’re you doing?”
Check out the Spotify Playlist I've created for this fic. The link is in the summary. I recommend listening to two key songs this chapter: Painkillers by Rainbow Kitten Surprise and No Choir by Florence and the Machine.
“You don’t have to apologize when I’m the reason you lost your grace.” Dean takes a few tentative steps towards Castiel but stops himself before he makes contact. One step, maybe two, and Castiel could be in his arms, but Dean’s body is tense, his hands fisted by his sides. There is no room for affection in his frame; he is entirely closed off. “I’m the one who fucked up, Cas. I should’ve said yes to Michael when I had the chance. I’ve been trying for months, but the angels ain’t listening anymore. If I’d just said yes like he told me to, Lucifer might not be wearing my brother to prom and you might still be a goddamn angel.”
"What's this?" Gordon perks up, blocking his view of Cas. "Has the infamous Dean Winchester finally hit a dry spell?"
By September, the final draft of the book was sent off to his publisher which means Castiel begins the marketing process. He fucking hates the publicity that accompanies being a New York Times Bestselling Author. If his books had a smaller following and he could maintain some form of privacy, his life would be much easier, but that’s not the case. So, much to his chagrin, he’s sitting on the set of the Today Show, knees bouncing with anxiety before the cameras turn on and he’s broadcasted onto national television.
It’s all very clear now. Dean’s seen a lot of lost, lonely, depressed kids come through Ellen and Bobby’s place. Not once, out of all those kids, has Dean ever wanted to make them feel better. Not like this.
Rhea and Sonia share a glance but, inevitably, they agree to come with them. Helping the two women pack up their belongings, Castiel can’t help but notice a pile of needles in the far corner, a collection of empty pill bottles, and the glassy-eyed look of someone riding an insane high.
Dean quickly starts the car and he drives until they reach an abandoned house by the beach. He parks behind the garage, facing the water, and cuts the engine. He nervously taps his thumbs against the steering wheel. No matter how many times they do this, Dean is always so freaking nervous. It's probably the fear of fucking up and forcing Cas into a state of panic, although he would never admit that.
As they walk side by side, shuffling across the leaves and twigs littered on the sidewalk, their feet hitting the pavement in correct time, Castiel is acutely aware of their shoulders occasionally brushing. Why does he have to pinpoint every exact moment in time with Dean? All his old habits are suddenly coming back without warning, and more importantly, without Castiel’s approval.
There are reasons for that. Even if he told them what had happened it wouldn’t help anyone. It happened, but the world is still spinning and he is still living and nothing he can say will help. They would say that if he told them what happened that night it could give him closure, and give closure to the others who were involved, but how can you give closure to someone who is dead? They would say that
Dawn breaks through the trees, painting the sky in blue and pink, as Castiel exits his cabin. He rubs the sleep from his eyes and yawns, body moving painfully slow as he steps out into the cool morning air.
They get out of the car and hop up onto the curb. Castiel wraps his trench coat around him, shivering in the cold November air, but he moves to be closer to Dean, eyes wide and apologetic.
“Talk about what, exactly?” Dean sighs, “I don’t need medication or treatment. I don’t need to be fixed.”
Castiel pauses as he enters the room again, towel in hand, to clean up the mess they made. He does a quick swipe of Dean’s stomach and the sheets before tossing the towel down on the floor.
At the makeshift stage in the center of the bookstore, Balthazar grabs the microphone from it’s stand and announces, “We’ll be starting the reading in about five minutes, everyone. Please grab a few more snacks and take your seats.”
“It’s different this time,” Dean tugs at his luggage until he is beside Castiel. They begin walking up to the entrance of their hotel. “I’m leaving my hometown with you.”
Sam takes a step forward and hardens his tone. “Dean, I know that you and Cas went on a date. I know what happened the other night and I’m pretty sure mom and dad are getting a similar idea.”
They find breakfast just below the yellow arches of a McDonald’s as they near their flight’s gate. After grabbing some hash browns and coffee, they take their seats in the uncomfortable chairs that line the waiting area, looking out the window at an immense expanse of concrete and landing strips.
“It’s okay if you’re using me,” She admits, tilting her head to the side. “I’m used to being used...but we’re friends, and if you need to forget about...about Cas for a little bit, then I understand.”
“Cas…” Dean calls softly from the doorway, folding his arms across his chest and looking him over. “Are you ok—"
could still get closure and he would ask them again: how can you give closure to someone who is dead? How awful, they would think, the poor kid thinks he is dead when he is clearly still breathing. And he would wait for them to shuffle away, knowing they'll return again in a few months’ time.
Robert Novak’s eyes grow darker with anger, and he spits out, “Elisabeth and I were quite happy for a long time, but she passed away from cancer two years ago. Listen, you must forgive me, Castiel, for turning my back on you.”
The drive back is quiet and tense, the air vibrating with anxious thoughts and deep breaths. When Dean parks the car and cuts the engine, neither one musters a word as they slide out of the car and meet face to face at the walkway. Dean smiles slightly, moving his hand out to clasp Castiel’s numb fingers in his own. They go inside, where the frigid air can no longer reach them. The door clicks shut, and darkness falls over them.
Nobody says a word when he leaves the room quietly, turkey sandwich in hand, and sneaks out the back door. They’re too busy making plans to establish a real camp in a few months, something that will last them for years to come, even when the rest of the world crumbles. He isn’t worried that anyone will even notice he’s stepped outside. He has exactly ten minutes to smoke a bowl before the news program starts, and he’s not going to waste a second of this precious, mindless time.
Taking even one step away from Cas and towards the general direction of Anna feels like the end all over again, but he nods to the Singers and goes to help his friend like he knows he is supposed to.
Reaching across Bobby, Cas plucks the bowl of mashed potatoes and places it before his mom who pats his arm affectionately in response. Looking away from Ellen, Castiel makes eye contact with Mary Winchester and suddenly feels obligated to say something, but nothing comes to mind.
In all honesty, Castiel really likes Missouri. She's funny and kind but doesn't let any of her workers get away with anything stupid. He likes to tell her about the latest books he's read, and she shares all her new reads with him. Looking at the clock, he asks, "Do you have any clients today?"
a good fuck, either. It’s always been more than that. Casting his eyes down Castiel’s relaxed body, Dean reaches out his hands to push the hair from his eyes, tracing his fingers gently against the man’s skin. It is abundantly clear now. Dean can’t shake the feeling that the only person in this world he is meant to be with is currently asleep beside him, snoring lightly into his pillow.
“No,” Castiel shakes his head, scoffing in disbelief. “She died when I was eleven, you idiot. I’ve been in foster care for the last six years of my life.”
Laz stays still for a moment and Castiel turns back to Sam for a reply but just as he turns his head the stupid dog barks again, even letting out a squeal of impatience.
“How could you know? It’s not exactly something that I went around telling people about.” Castiel releases an anxious laugh that ends up turning into a muffled sob and continues, “I listened to their screams for hours until, finally, it was quiet, and I knew he was coming for me. But I had a gun. And when he opened that door and lunged at me, I shot him. I won’t ever forget the sound, the way the blood gushed out of him. He’d seen me bleed so many times, and I had begun to think that he was inhuman – that he couldn’t bleed and break like I could.”
John waves his hand in dismissal as he continues on, “You better get your ass home, but don’t expect us to come get you. Call your folks and they—”
“They do have an amazing selection of wines,” Cas agrees, reaching for the wine list and flipping through it. Cas leans into Dean, allowing him to look at the list. Underneath the table, Dean rests his hand on Cas’ bouncing knee.
Smirking up at him, Cas lifts his hand to Dean's mouth and commands, "Open." Dean opens his mouth obediently and closes it around Cas' two fingers, swirling his tongue and sucking. Cas watches him intently and releases a shaky breath. When Cas pulls his spit-slicked hand away, he maintains a firm gaze with Dean and nudges his legs open.
But Dean just glares at him and Castiel gives a sharp nod before throwing back two pills and swallowing them dry. They feel lodged in his throat, but he's paying more attention to Dean’s fingers skimming over his bare stomach. Dean pokes gently at freshly formed blue circles as well as the older fading brown ones. A gentle finger traces over a line of pale-yellow spots. He whispers, “Who gave you these older bruises?”
Sam reaches the drowning boy first; he quickly dives down and retrieves the limp body. With Dean’s help, Sam manages to lift Cas onto one of the surfboards.
Watching her carefully as she puts his clothes away into his dresser, he wonders what she knows and what she just assumes.
These are the things he wants to remember when he goes away. He wants to remember the lazy days when Cas falls asleep against his chest, the urgent press of lips and the grinding of hips when his parents leave them alone to go to the store for a few minutes, and the soft whispers and comforting words exchanged when they are least expected.
“When do you wanna talk about it? ‘Cause I want to talk about it, Cas. I want to talk about why I said the things that I said and why I left the way I did and what happened to you once I was a gone, so let’s talk.”
The Impala shudders as Dean cuts the roar of the engine in front of the Singer’s house. The sky above is covered in a dense layer of dark, stormy clouds. Off in the distance, there’s a crack of lightening. Careful not to scratch anything, he shuts the door of the car and strides up to the front door, knocking before entering the house with a smile on his face. He follows the sound of voices coming from the kitchen and stands in the doorway, watching Cas and Ellen as they speak in hushed voices at the kitchen table with a notebook spread out between them. Cas nods at something Ellen says and scribbles another note down. Dean clears his throat and they both look up from the notebook.
He lights up and inhales deeply, savoring the burn and holding it in his lungs. He bends and blows the smoke out the window; it cascades out into the open air in a thick plume before disappearing entirely against the fevered red sky as the sun rises through the trees. As it ascends, climbing higher into the heavens, Castiel comes to terms with how far he has fallen from grace, and he thinks again about how much he wants to die.
“Well, one thing’s for sure,” Dean winces again and flinches at the contact, “you ain’t exactly gentle.”
“I’m sorry, Mom,” He sighs, tracing his fingers along the etchings of her name. He struggles to keep his voice steady. “I haven’t been eating or sleeping or taking my medication. I see him everywhere. I see you everywhere,” He takes a shaky breath, the tears welling up in his eyes as the cold air pierces his lungs. The wind sends a shiver through his body. “Life is so cruel, and people are so pointless.” The cold stone presses against his cheek, “I wish I wasn’t human.”
Naomi pulls over and parks in front of a generously sized Victorian. The houses surrounding it are much smaller as it towers over the two homes on either side of its corner lot.
Castiel balances his book on the arm of the couch and stands. “Sure,” He responds without a second thought; the answers rushing out of him in quick bursts. “Let me put on my shoes.”
I have some news for you. I included a new and important tag to this story. It may cause some of you to stop reading, and that's okay! I totally understand. I've added "Major Character Death" as a tag, because it is, unfortunately, unavoidable in this story and I only just realized it recently. Obviously, I'm not going to spill any other details. Maybe some of you might be more into this story knowing that it's going to be a tragedy. Maybe not.
And it takes Castiel a second to realize that it’s not a question or a warning, but an acknowledgement. An understanding that this form of bodily contact is necessary for survival. They need it purely to sustain themselves. So, Castiel gets to work repairing a body that he knows better than the vessel he currently inhabits. It is the first time they have touched in a week, but it feels like a decade, a millennium. Castiel would know. He’s lived through eons.
Castiel wants to die. Withdrawal hits him harder these days and more frequently. If he isn’t nodding out, then he’s suffering or planning his next opportunity to take anything he can get his hands on. Castiel scans his room, looking over at the naked shape of the woman in his bed. Castiel doesn’t remember her name, but he knows that she’s new – recently found three towns over in an abandoned Walgreens – and that her body is warm. It is better than waking to an isolating chill.
The night wears on, and Dean ends up really enjoying the witty banter between Balthazar and Cas. They obviously had a thing in the past, but it’s clearly just friendship and professional interests now. Dean ends up inviting Balthazar to come visit them in California whenever he gets the chance.
By the end of the night, everyone is merry, filled with laughter and tequila, shoes in hand as they head out the side gate and off into the night. A lot of (drunk) friends and family end up crashing in the various empty bedrooms on the upper floors of the Singer home. Dean and Cas linger in the yard, drunkenly clinging to each other as they sway with the music, until they’re the only two left outside. Once Sammy and Jo left, the party dwindled and, eventually, the remaining people who were still awake took cover inside when a light mist began to come down from the pitch-black sky.
“No, I’m serious,” Dean shakes his head with a smile on his face, running his hands through Castiel’s hair. “C’mon, you’re twenty-five and living at home. Even when you do move in with me, you’ll only be a few blocks away so you can still help out with Ellen. You basically sleep at my house every other day. My bed is definitely more comfortable than that piece of shit in your old bedroom. It makes sense”
“You’re so beautiful,” He murmurs, caressing the curve of Castiel’s cheek with his knuckles. Castiel remembers similar compliments spewing from Alistair’s mouth whenever he was too close for comfort. Recognizing the pain on Castiel's face, Dean falters momentarily and smiles sadly at him, “How high are you right now?”
Nervously, Dean flicks his eyes around the room before glancing down at his feet. He really, really wishes he didn’t have to do this…
“I don’t blame you for coming back. I thought about it, for a second, but it was a short-lived dream.” Turning the corner, Castiel sees the coffee shop in the near distance, “I’m glad you’re happy here though. You definitely belong in California – it’s your birthright.”
"Stop!" Dean quickly jerks his hand away at the words, hitting on the bottom of the table, but Castiel just smiles, "I'm gonna come just hearing you talk like that."
“You’re a damn good partner, Cas.” With a slap of his hand to Castiel’s back, Dean quirks his head towards the exit, “C’mon, let’s roll.”
“Well, happy fucking New Year,” Ellen curses, lifting her glass of brandy into the air with a fake smile plastered across her face. They all follow suit, raising their glasses and begging for mercy under their breath.
For a long time Cas doesn’t say anything, then he turns his head away from Dean and sighs heavily. There must be a lot on Cas’ mind. A secret like that isn’t something you should have to carry all by yourself.
With the room illuminated, he straightens himself and backs up towards the door, preparing to make a hasty exit.
The words are cut off as Cas stumbles forward, crashing hard into Dean, and the two of them land on the floor of the roller rink in a heap. Castiel’s chest is pressed against Dean’s, and his stomach flips at the feeling of Castiel’s laugh escaping his body.
Blatantly attempting to cover his smile, Castiel tries his best to seem genuinely offended, “I’m pretty sure that I would know what my favorite kind of pizza is.”
After re-reading the fic, I've realized just how sexually pent-up and SAD I was in high school. I'm hoping that the remaining chapters will reflect the newfound maturity of Dean and Cas as adults.
This isn’t loving. Castiel is simply an attempt to fill that dark, endless space inside Dean that is all-consuming. Castiel can see it in Dean’s eyes. Hollow and searching for something to make him whole. In a twisted way, Castiel is willing to be that distraction if it means that he can be with Dean again.
“Mm, you would look awfully pretty in pink,” Dean murmurs into his ear as they set their bags down at the front of the concierge desk. “God – I love it when you call me Winchester.” He perks his head up when a woman in a neat green uniform appears behind the counter. Castiel elbows Dean in the ribs for good measure. He chuckles, but backs off immediately, raising his hands in surrender.
“Where in the world have you been? You had us worried sick… Oh my god, what happened?” She asks, cupping Castiel’s face in her hands, “I’ll kill ‘em. I will.”
“You alright?” Dean grunts as he stands, dusting off his jeans and releasing a sigh. “Fuck, I thought I was done for.”
The back door to the kitchen swings open and a red-headed girl wearing a filthy hoodie and a ratted pair of jeans stalks into the dining room.
“Hey everybody,” Dean shoots a charming grin to the crowd, but he’s really feeling like he might puke any second. “I’m Dean Winchester, and I was asked to say a few words about Cas and the book. And to be honest, I’m at a loss.”
“I’m not stupid.” Dean looks around the emptying classroom, before adding, “Come over later. It’s a Friday night. We can watch a movie.”
Seconds after he walks through the door, a nurse turns and rushes over to Dean, “What happened to her?” And then it hits him again like a ton of bricks right on his chest, making him gasp for air as two more nurses take her from Dean’s arms. Another nurse guides Dean to a chair the moment she sees his entire body is shaking with the sharp pains of grief shooting through his chest.
He hasn’t seen Dean yet, and he’s been home from the supplies run for an hour. He rests his forehead on the cool wood of the door frame before twisting the knob and stepping into the room. Dean is nowhere in sight but, on the bed, is an orange pill bottle and his flask. The ones he keeps in the upstairs bathroom.
“God, Cassie,” Gabe laughs, smacking Castiel on his exposed stomach. “Is that the only way you could possibly participate in any social event?”
And then, he is overwhelmed with pain, as if every cell in his body is bursting into tiny shards of matter. His grace, the light he could always find within himself, is suddenly ripped from his core and all that’s left is an agonizing memory of what it felt like to be infinite. There is a faint sensation of remnants left behind – celestial energies that will eventually disappear with time and human exertion – but, for the most part, he is remarkably human. The world becomes smaller, duller, and scarier in a matter of minutes.
Curiosity killed the cat, right? This is a dangerous game Cas is playing, but he’s been mulling over what Dean had told him at the vineyard. And it still feels like every time he brings it up, Dean changes the subject, skillfully navigating his way out of the conversation.
“Dad! Who is it?” Dean dives across the small space of the kitchen and fervently attempts to wrestle the phone from his father’s firm grip, pleading, “Dad, give me the phone. Is it Cas?”
“Fuck, Dean, please,” Castiel whines, embarrassingly wanton, wiggling when Dean uses his tongue to trace the prominent vein of his dick. “I need you to—I’m so close.”
The nervousness sets in all over again, sending Dean into overdrive, “I just –” He sits up straighter and focuses on keeping his voice level. “I was at this party and she was really drunk – I went to get her some water. I came back and she was gone. He had taken her…”
The bell rings fifteen minutes later and students clear out of the room, eager to get to lunch. Once everyone else has left the room, Dean reluctantly walks the few feet to the teacher’s desk, the test crumpled in his left hand.
He sets his laptop aside, closing the screen, and pulls his knees up to his chest. He finally submitted the first two chapters and the remaining outline of his memoir to his editor and publicist today. In the next few days, he should hear back from them, and their responses will ultimately determine if he should move forward with the new project. Secretly, he hopes they tell him that it’s the worst thing he’s ever written, but he
Slamming his eyes shut, Dean fights back the urge to scream, because fuck, this really can’t be happening. Not now, not when everything is finally how it should be.
Lifting his head and meeting Officer Mill’s calm complexion, Dean exhales sharply the name that he can’t stop repeating over and over in his mind, “Gordon Walker.”
The pressure becomes too much for Dean, and he comes in his jeans with a shudder, yanking Castiel down to him in an urgent kiss. He nips and licks his way into Cas’ mouth, continuing to grind his hips against Castiel’s trapped erection.
He sees stars. He sees auroras and burst of faded fireworks behind his eyelids and the only coherent sound he can understand is his blood rushing through his ears. When he opens his eyes after a few minutes, Cas has already cleaned him up and tucked him back into his jeans.
“Do you know where they went?” Lisa shakes her head and Dean shouts louder this time, “Has anyone seen where Gordon or Anna went?”
The five teenagers arrive at the deserted park just as the rain begins to fall. They all huddle beneath the jungle gym and light the joints eagerly, craving the effects it will have on their developing, vulnerable brains.
And Dean uses Castiel in a similar fashion. The sex is emotional, clearly, but there is something in the snap of Dean’s hips as he fucks Castiel into a mattress or the backseat of the Impala that tells him this is relieving some anxiety within Dean too.
The fog is a merely a momentary distraction. Seconds later, his brain is running wild with all the things he needs to do today. He needs to make phone calls, set up cots in the basement and extra rooms, catalogue their ammunition and guns, organize the supplies in the basement and create a rations schedule. Being the right-hand man of the one person who can possibly stop Satan from destroying the world is hard work with little to no credit.
“You’re so tight, Cas,” Dean moans, licking the underside of Castiel’s cock. He adds a second finger, building momentum as he pumps his hand. A slight crook of his fingers sends Castiel gasping for air again. “I wanna make this perfect for you.”
Castiel enjoys the time he spends at school. Learning is important to him; it gives him the chance to make a better future for himself, one that could be different from his past. He spends all his class time soaking up as much knowledge as possible, and sometimes during lunch, if he isn’t that hungry, he heads to the library to check out the new books.
“It was fine. I had some stuff to do,” Laying back against the stacks of pillows, Dean curls into Cas’ chest, listening to him as he continues. “I missed you.”
“You just look…” A smile sneaks its way across Castiel’s face before he can filter himself, “You look like past you. Like you’ve never left your hometown.”
Their bodies are nearly touching. Although Castiel does not perceive temperature the same way that humans do, he can feel the warmth of Dean’s body beside him. There is a pulse. A heart beating. They lay in silence for a while, lazily watching the TV screen with only mild interest. Castiel isn’t paying much attention to anything but the feeling of Dean slowly inching closer to him until their arms brush each other.
The blood drains from Dean’s face. Gordon came by the locker room when he and Cas were doing...things. It’s feels like Gordon has just punched him in the gut and forced all the air from his lungs. His hands begin to shake as he straightens up slowly, barely managing to keep his emotions in check.
His chest tightens with a mixture of anxiety and arousal. He doesn’t want Dean just for one night. He wants Dean to be his. Endlessly. No matter what.
From downstairs Mary shouts, anger evident in her tone, “Did I just hear you curse, Samuel Winchester? It is the Lord’s day!”
Dean gives him an incredulous look, as if he is shocked to find that Castiel believes he can’t be trusted. He shrugs, “Why wouldn’t I?”
She turns her body to look him in the eye, “I’m being serious here. You can like whoever you want, no matter what body parts they have. I’m not gonna judge you, it’s your life.”
He rides out Dean’s orgasm until his muscles tighten and a spasm shoots through his body, wrecking him in the process. Even after the haze of his orgasm washes away, Castiel gently shifts his hips, savoring the feel of Dean wrapped around him before he pulls out, walking to the bathroom to grab a towel.
They both blush red as an awkward silence permeates the car. A breeze rushes through the open windows, ruffling Dean’s hair and relieving the heat of the moment. Castiel slides off of Dean’s lap and sits beside him, keeping his eyes forward to watch as the sun sets on the water stretched out before them. No end in sight.
"Just give me a minute," Dean grunts, pulling Castiel down for a sloppy kiss. He slides his tongue across the roof of Castiel’s mouth and mutters, "More."
Dean looks back at Cas, who appears completely clueless about the situation at hand but somehow adorable in his obliviousness.
Shaking her head and crying hysterically, she crumbles, “I c-c-can’t do it. I have to stay. Dean, Dean knows better than to talk back. He knows better than that.”
He takes one last menacing glance at his son and stomps out of the room, slamming the back door behind him. Mary rushes to her son’s side, turning his bruised face up to hers and releasing a wrecked sob. She pulls him to her chest and cradles him, sobbing violently.
Pinned between the door and Dean, he swirls his tongue along Dean's bottom lip and whimpers when the older boy deepens the kiss. He becomes frantic, clutching onto Dean as their tongues dance and teeth clash. It’s a mess, it really is, but Castiel finds comfort in the thought that this will not be perfect. It doesn’t need to be perfect, because then it wouldn’t be real. This is real. Dean is running his hands down Castiel’s body and taking a handful of his ass in his hands and Castiel actually wants it to happen. This desire to completely open himself up to Dean is entirely his choice and Castiel never would have thought that this could become reality.
Castiel can feel Dean run his hands up his legs, rubbing small circles into his knees with his thumbs.
"God.." Glancing over at the door, Castiel notices someone crossing the street towards the store. "How long will your family be gone?"
The sound that Castiel makes is unholy. It feels as if he is drowning in the sensation of Dean’s hot mouth. He stutters out, “Ho-holy fuck!” At the unexpected exclamation, Dean hums around Castiel’s cock and hollows out his cheeks, sending another wave of unrecognizable heat through Castiel’s trembling body. He digs the blunt edge of his nails into the base of Dean’s skull, scratching at the short hair there, and Dean bobs his head back down at the encouragement. To Castiel’s frustration and Dean’s amusement, Dean takes his time working Castiel up to his breaking point, teasing him with little licks and nips until Castiel is literally begging Dean to make him come.
Dean sighs, recovering from the loss of composure, and accepts the pill and water with a blank face, lowering his eyes to the ground like he saw something he shouldn’t have. He swallows the pill and hands the cup back to Castiel. He whispers, “Thanks.”
Dean’s movements falter at the request, and Castiel instantly overanalyzes the hesitation, wondering if it’s still too soon. It doesn’t feel like it’s too soon; they’ve been touching each other in every way imaginable for the last few weeks, but nothing that required any removal of clothing. It’s been strictly PG-13, as Dean would put it.
Ellen rushes into the room and kneels down next to the couch Castiel is laying on. She presses a hand to his forehead, “Are you alright?”
The thought passes just as quickly as it came when Dean lowers his head and takes Castiel’s erection into his mouth. Digging his fingers into Dean’s shoulders, Castiel groans helplessly and relishes in the feeling of Dean’s mouth around him. Keeping on hand on the back of Dean’s head, Castiel reaches over to the nightstand and pulls out a bottle of lube and a condom. Without a word, Dean flips Castiel onto his hands and knees.
He moves on to the bookshelf where he accidentally knocks a snow globe to the floor; it shatters in a watery heap of glass at his feet. Stepping over the mess, Dean moves to the bed. He throws the blankets and comforter off, half expecting to find Cas lying there beneath the sheets. Upon seeing the empty mattress, Dean yells in rage and shoves it off the frame.
He doesn’t know why his mother insists on it. If John had his way, they wouldn’t even utter God’s name unless it was in vain.
The world isn’t hateful; he is. He hates himself. He hates his past. He despises his lack of future. He wishes for happiness, but only rewards himself with pain. He is his own enemy.
His eyes roam over Castiel’s long body, his legs stretching out underneath the table, one arm around Ellen as the other drapes carelessly across the table, twirling a pen. Cas looks so much older but, Jesus Christ, he’s still gorgeous. Twenty-five looks good on Cas. His jet-black hair is ruffled perfectly to the side. There’s a tint of pink to his cheeks that makes him positively boyish looking, but the dark stubble that lines his sharp jawline offset it.
Right now, this current moment feels permanent and everlasting, just like the horizon before them, waves crashing in a repeated and unending cycle. Pulling and pulling away, only to come back again and again, cyclical, and persistent as the tide.
Later that night, Castiel stretches out on his bed and stares at the ceiling for an hour, wishing he had something to keep his mind busy. He plays with the idea of getting out his pocketknife and carving shapes into his skin, but what he really wants is some cocaine, even though he’s been clean for months now. The urge can be so much worse than doing it. God, but the high he gets from it is phenomenal. If only he could sneak out for a few hours and—
“That’s because it is.” She has pretty eyes – sort of green, or maybe blue – that scan him before jotting down a note. “What are you writing down?”
“He said he’ll call me,” Cas lets out his breath like he’s been holding it in for hours. “This feels surreal. I don’t even know if I want him to call me, Jo! I’m still pissed about how he left things with me, and he doesn’t know about all the shit that went down after he left for college.”
It is exceptionally hot for July in Oregon, and the last vivid, fully angelic memory that Castiel has is of Dean. He watches clear beads of sweat trail down Dean’s neck after killing two vampires, mixing with the blood splattered on his shirt collar.
There is a burgeoning blush of an impending bruise on his ribs, a deep gash that curves from the bottom of Dean’s brow up to his hairline, blood as red as a handful of sun-kissed cherries dripping from his eyebrow, and a possible elbow dislocation. Dean is a complete and utter mess, but he’s alive. He’s breathing.
"When was the last time you fucked a girl?" Crossing his arms over his chest, Gordon traps Dean by blocking his path to escape. "Hm?"
Brushing his lips to Dean's ear, Castiel rasps, "Lay down with me." He slides off of Dean's lap and stretches out on the comforter, raising his arms above his head as he arches his bed in a stretch. Clumsily, Dean stands and removes his own clothes until he is just as bare as the boy before him.
Wiping at the tears aggressively, Dean lets out a low growl and abruptly punches the steering wheel with enough force to knock out a grown man.
“And what you did wasn’t selfish? You both fucking left me! For all I knew, you were dead too, and quite frankly, you are still dead to me.”
After spacing out, Dean hadn’t noticed Cas waking up. He shakes his head and kisses the top of Cas’ head.
Surging forward and crashing their lips together in a mess of sliding tongues and knocking teeth, Castiel releases Dean’s hand to grip either side of Dean’s face as he snakes his tongue into Dean’s hot mouth. Grabbing Castiel’s thigh with his free hand, Dean slings it over his hip and ruts against Castiel’s naked form, eliciting sharp moans from both of them.
I’m not active in the Supernatural fandom anymore, and I stopped watching the show around Season 10. But that doesn’t mean that I don’t love the show and this story, so I MUST finish it. I have a plan, and I’m determined to follow through this time.
“You, you, you,” Cas chants, nails biting into Dean’s shoulders. “Please, Dean, you’re the only thing I’ve ever wanted.”
Sam casts his eyes down at the ground, “He’s still in love with you, Cas. Even after all this time. I don’t think he ever stopped lovin’ you.”
“That’s not true!” Shouting from within the car, Jo pulls her head out of the trunk and begins to carry some boxes inside, “We don’t have the space for a dog right now, but we can get one once we get a bigger place. Do you honestly think that we could take care of dog, my mom, and ourselves? C’mon Sam, seriously.”
“I’ve never done anything with a guy before,” Dean whispers low against Castiel’s ear. It sounds so vulnerable coming out of the older boy’s mouth. Never in his life would Castiel have guessed he would see Dean so open in one day; it just seemed unrealistic.
And this is the moment that Castiel has dreamed about for months, but it’s not supposed to happen like this. He doesn’t want to be an easy, mindless comfort to Dean in his time of need, but Castiel is torn. He loves Dean so much that he would do anything to ease even the smallest amount of Dean’s pain.
Castiel sneaks a glance in Dean’s direction to find him fast asleep. He has spent a number of hours watching Dean sleep. To protect him, of course, but he’s never been this close. Close enough to touch. So far, Castiel and Dean only touch in passing, brief instances that leave Castiel wondering what a lingering connection would be like. But this time it’s different. And, through the night, they do touch. At some point, Dean throws his arm around Castiel’s middle and tugs him close to fit into the curve of his body. They spend the rest of the night curled around one another, and Castiel prays that their proximity will never end, that they can remain like this forever.
Slamming the metal door of his locker shut, forcing Dean to jump at the sharp sound, Gordon spins around and laughs bitterly. “Now that…” He looks Dean over once and continues after a beat, “That I don’t believe for a second. You’re not fooling me, Dean.”
Checking over his shoulder to make sure that Dean is out of earshot, Castiel realizes that this is his chance. Kneeling beside Rhea, Castiel hands her a collection of books and they lock eyes.
Thanking the stars, Castiel bites his lower lip and says, "I'll be there at 7:30, okay?" Before Dean can answer, Castiel slams the phone back down onto the receiver.
“Yes, we’re totally fine. She’s just stressed out about the wedding and Ellen, so she’s been taking it out on me. Don’t worry about us, it’ll all blow over.” He shrugs half-heartedly at the helplessness of his situation, “Life is complicated right now, but I’m happy, you know?”
Without waking Dean, Castiel climbs out of bed. He goes to the bathroom and cuts himself half of a little white pill, washing it down with a swig from a flask that’s a low on gin, and it is reward enough. It burns going down. Carefully, Castiel stows the flask and bottle in the back of the linens cupboard before brushing his teeth to rid himself of the regret that twists a knot in his stomach. The pill makes it worse but, by the time it’s noon, he’s itching for a second one.
The service goes into hymns and Dean sings along reluctantly. Finally, after an hour of pious bullshit, the service ends and Dean heads outside.
His relationship with Lisa had been a cover. Something to pass the time and to convince his dad that he was as straight as an arrow but, in the end, it didn’t change anything. Dean is still queer, and he’s still hopelessly in love with Castiel. He ended the relationship just three months before the wedding, telling her everything, including his long unrequited love for Cas. Lisa told him that she would never forgive him for it.
“No,” She replies, carefully lifting herself of the bed and finding her balance. He frail body sags at the effort of standing. “Castiel, as the sole witness to the horrors inside that house, you have a responsibility to share what you know with the world. You have an opportunity here to share a firsthand account of the foster care system. Only you can decide whether or not to write it because you’re an adult. No one can tell you what to do anymore.”
“I screwed this entire date up,” Dean mutters. “I really like you, Cas. You’re funny and hot and every time you smile my stomach does this weird flip thing. But you’re right.”
She reaches for his arm and pulls him to sit down beside her, “He talks about you a lot. When you’re around, he never stops looking at you. It’s like he’s taking mental notes on how you breathe or something. I don’t get it, but he does, Dean.” She takes a deep breath, “He doesn’t have much, or anything, but I think for once he feels like he could.”
Alright, so here is the other thing. This is going to get pretty dark. There will be explicit descriptions of opioid/other drug use. I know this subject is sensitive, and I don't want to romanticize it in any way. I want to seriously depict Castiel's drug addiction in a light that shows how devastating it can be on a person's life. I have family members who have struggled with drug/substance abuse and this is a subject that's close to my heart.
Jo moves away from the door to the living room and sits beside Castiel on the couch. Castiel watches as the light catches on her engagement ring; a rainbow reflects on the wall above the window for a second, and then it’s gone. A flash of happiness.
He doesn’t move. Hell, he tries his best not to breathe until John has thrown Dean into the passenger side of the Impala with a few fresh bruises and swollen, split lip. Through the window of the car and veil of heavy rain, Castiel meets Dean’s eyes and feels a rush of complete uselessness. In anger and desperation, he picks himself up and rushes at the Impala as John starts the car and begins driving away. Castiel runs alongside the car, pounding his fist on Dean’s window and shouting at him, “You fucking ruined me, Dean Winchester! You took everything and now I have nothing! I fucking hate you – I hate you so much, I do. I hate you. I hate you…”
Dean’s regretting that first cup of coffee this morning. He’s on high alert, completely wound up and trembling with nerves by the time Sammy drops Cas and Dean off at the San Francisco International Airport. Thankfully, the drive didn’t take long, and there was hardly any traffic. If there had been traffic, Dean would’ve lost his shit.
Bobby gives him a look that Castiel is unable to place, and says, “I doubt that, Cas.” He looks to the clock on the wall. “It’s gettin’ pretty damn late. Go on and get some shut eye.”
“I told you I’d make you scream it,” Dean smiles, resting his forehead against Cas as his release overcomes him, wracking through his body in a wave of heat. “Told you I’d make you feel good, baby.”
Lying beneath Cas in only his boxers, Dean shivers at the slightest touch of Cas grazing his fingertips over his stomach. Cas slides his hands up Dean's chest and kisses the hollow part of his neck.
“He isn’t supposed to hurt you,” She cries, running soothing fingers through Dean’s short hair and swaying them back and forth.
“It was my first night at the Singer’s,” His voice melts over Dean the way it always does. “I looked out the window, and I saw you pull up in the Impala. I remember wondering if I would see you at school.”
“Congratulations, Jo!” Gabe shouts, grabbing her and crushing her in an enormous embrace, “That’s so great.”
“No, you don’t,” Christ, he sounds defensive. This is Sammy, his kid brother who he is supposed to be able to tell every damn thing to. “You can’t.”
Croats start peeling out of alleyways and buildings, rushing towards the caravan with ferocity. They sense the fresh blood in the air.
The words take Castiel by surprise and before he can control himself, he's blushing like an idiot. Dean's smile grows wider as Castiel's cheeks become a deeper shade of pink. He giggles and covers his face with his hands to keep himself from losing it. Before he can get himself under control, he's laughing hysterically.
Without a second thought, Dean takes the hint and surges into Castiel’s space, kissing him. He’s pushing Castiel down onto the couch and wedging himself between Cas’ spread legs; the heat of their bodies pressed against each other sends a spark of heat straight through him. A moan escapes Castiel’s mouth and Dean kisses the corner of his open mouth, trailing a line of kisses down to his neck. They grind against each other, hands tangled in clothing and hair, and begin to make up for lost time.
When he finally catches his breath, he wipes at his wet cheeks and stifles another sob, catching it and forcing it down, because he doesn’t want to wake anyone else up. What time is it anyways? He glances at the clock on his nightstand. Of course, it’s 4 A.M. It’s been three weeks since he slept through the night peacefully.
"Shut up! Don’t you dare do that..." Dean glares and sneers down his nose at Castiel, “Don’t be an ass right now.”
Castiel’s voice, thick with wine and lost hope, makes Dean’s heart lurch every time. He can’t seem to forgive himself for what he did. For lying and running away rather than owning up to his choices, and just loving Cas the way he was meant to love him. But now he’s been given a second chance. He doesn’t want to mess up this time around. So, when he does tell Cas that he loves him, Dean wants it to be perfect. Beyond a reasonable doubt.
The entire drive to the hospital Dean couldn’t stop thinking about what he was going to do once he got there. Which is funny in a sick, twisted way because now that he’s here, all he can think about is how shitty it is. After pulling into the parking lot of the hospital, Dean takes one look at Anna’s limp body buckled into the passenger seat and it’s as though the world suddenly loses a dimension. Everything just appears to have gone completely still – devoid of purpose and reason. Dean’s eyes brim with tears and his perception of reality completely loses a sense of purpose. This must be what it feels like to finally toss in the goddamn towel and give up entirely. With a heavy sigh and a heart that has collapsed in on itself, Dean slowly regains composure. All he knows now is that he really needs to get it together before he takes Anna inside, because this is gonna be a living hell for her once she wakes up.
But right now, Cas really does need him. In the chaotic scene at the party, Dean hadn’t realized how goddamn drunk Cas is. He's not even sure how Cas got so drunk in the first place. There is no way in hell he could’ve taken Cas home to Ellen like this, so he drags the boy to his own room and tries to come up with a plan.
The two boys head inside, settling themselves in Castiel’s bedroom with a bottle of vodka. They pass it back and forth, neither one bothering to say much at all, just enjoying the quiet company. Eventually, the liquid loosens their limbs and tongues.
"School's good, then?" Bobby grumbles, slamming on the brakes and cursing at the driver in front of him. "Your grades are real good."
Dean watches the rain pound on the pavement, steady and sure, which is something he is not. He gazes at his house sitting perfectly across the street, blurred from the rain.
“It’s good to see you,” Her smile falters as she notices the proximity of Dean and Castiel. “I didn’t know that you were back in town.”
They have shared many kisses, but this kiss tugs at Dean’s worried heart just by the sheer desperation of it. It starts off slow – like many of their affections – but soon Castiel pours his entire soul into it and Dean swears he swallows it whole without a second thought. Bracing his hands on either side of Cas’ face, Dean pulls away to shower Cas’ face in small kisses.
“You left,” Dean says simply, not knowing what to say now that he is finally here. He spent the entire drive thinking of everything he was going to yell at Cas, but now he can’t recall a single bit of it. “You were just gone.”
Dean could ask him to go anywhere or do anything and, without a second thought, Castiel would say, “Of course.” Because his presence in Dean’s life is a guarantee. He will always come when Dean calls. This is the third signal that he is in love.
Castiel glances at Dean out of the corner of his eye, and he can see the wheels turning inside Dean’s head.
Finding a birthday present for Dean should not be this difficult, but each store is like a massive maze that Castiel has to navigate just so he can get out of it again. Nothing here is sentimental in any way and Castiel's frustration continues to build. Finally, they leave, Jo carrying a bag of various CDs Dean has been begging for since Christmas and Castiel with the same forty dollars he had when he walked in.
With that said, she leaves. He likes her. It’s been awhile since he’s liked any of them. His last foster parent, Alastair, was a cruel man with wandering hands and a twisted mind. But in the past few years, Castiel has gotten used to handsy foster parents. That doesn’t mean he likes it; it just means that he's used to it. There's no point in trying to fight something that will never change.
Walking past Dean and towards the doors, Gordon shouts, “I don’t know yet, but I’m gonna figure it out.”
Thank you all so much for your wonderful comments and support for Still Breathing. I am so grateful to you. Here's a little snippet from Roaming in the Dark.
“I’ve heard about you,” Michael leans in, letting his lips brush Castiel’s ear. “Everyone talks about this dreamy new junior who doesn’t even realize how fucking hot he is. God, what I would love to do to you.”
It’s a bold-faced lie to the man he loves, but Castiel convinces himself that he’s simply mastering the skill of self-preservation. He is human, after all.
Dean kisses him with the tenderness that a lover should have. “You aren’t allowed to say sorry.” Their lips meet again. “I screwed up, Cas. Not you.”
With COVID-19 and quarantine, I decided to dedicate time to finish this fic once and for all. Looking back at the previous chapters, I realized how many grammar errors (my spelling was and is impeccable) there are. So, I’ve revising the whole thing! I didn't change the plot, but I took out and reworded a few things for clarity and conciseness. So, if you want, I highly recommend you read this bad boy from the beginning, which will pass the time as I write new chapters.
“Wanna come to the game this Friday night?” He watches from the corner of his eye as Cas sits up a little straighter and cocks his ear towards Dean, never looking up from his book. “I mean, I understand if you’re busy or something, but it’d be kinda cool if you could come. It’s the homecoming game, so there will be a lot of—”
The teacher asks another student – someone Dean has never seen before. The boy replies instantly and Henricksen moves on to his next victim, but Dean doesn’t follow. His eyes are glued to the boy sitting exactly two seats ahead and one row over from him. He must be new; Dean would have noticed him by now if he'd been here when the year started.
“We can definitely work out an arrangement,” Dean chuckles quietly and kisses him then, lifting his hand to cup Cas’ jaw and hold him still. For a moment, Castiel thinks that this is what it feels like to have wings, and he’s soaring.
Throwing his head back in a laugh, Castiel nods happily, “It was amazing.” After a moment passes, he blurts out, “I wish you’d been my first…”
By the sight of Dean’s silently pained grimace once he’s on his feet again, Castiel knows he’s right. Their journey to the car is slow and laborious, but they make it and Dean slides into the passenger seat of the Impala with a disgruntled moan of pain and exhaustion. Castiel tenderly wipes at the dried blood on Dean’s chin, lip split from a nasty uppercut, and rushes back to snag the demon still inside.
A valiant effort, Castiel thinks, and he chastises himself for falling in love with the martyr of the story. If it were up to him, Castiel would insist on being the one to kill the devil, but it’s not up to him. Instead, he sips his beer and grimaces, trying to swallow the hollow pit in his chest. He should have gotten a brandy, something stronger, something more filling.
Dean wants to argue, but he doesn’t. He holds his tongue and swallows his words like a scared little boy rather than a man.
There’s a room off to the side of the main area; somehow the two make it inside and away from everyone else. Michael hurriedly removes Castiel’s t-shirt and jeans, muttering compliments about his body, and removes his clothes too.
Dean grabs at Cas’ hands and pulls them from his head. He squeezes them between his own and holds them still, “I’ll kill the son of a bitch. Cas, what’d he do?”
“My love,” Cas screams out, coming hot and wet between their bodies. “You’re the love of my life. My lover.”
Lying down on the bed, Castiel glares at the ceiling above him and mumbles, “What am I going to do?” He brings hand to his lips, brushing his fingertips gently across his lower lip. The faint taste of Dean is still on his tongue.
“Yeah, yeah – she gave it to me, left me some before she dipped this morning. I gave myself too much, I think. I don’t – this isn’t right, Dean – I feel like… I’m too far gone.”
Castiel watches Dean cross Bobby’s dining room in three long strides, handing the paper to Jo and patting her shoulder gently. He stalks back over to his spot at the head of the table and worries his bottom lip between his teeth. Although Castiel would never tell Dean this, he looks the part of a leader.
“Cas, man, it is so nice to have you back. It’s been too long,” Clapping his huge hand on Castiel’s shoulder, Sam’s warm smile lifts some of the weight on Castiel’s chest. “Let’s get this stuff in the house so we can start getting ready to eat.”
"No, you don’t understand... I can't keep going without him. He's like air – I need him to survive."
Cas nods and Dean tries not to stare at the boy’s long, naked body. Cas is vulnerable, he's trusting Dean, and he needs Dean to be a friend right now. So, that is exactly what he will be.
“Sorry, I just thought that maybe... Did I remind you of him? I mean, we don’t have to, I’d totally understand Cas. It is the first date and I know that Ali–“
Sam drinks demon blood, and no one understands what compels him to do it. Dean doesn’t handle it well. Nobody can forgive or forget. Whenever the brothers are together, a thick cloud of shame, guilt, and distrust hangs over them and muddies the water until they’re all swimming in the thick muck of the Winchester’s shared trauma. There is no escape from it. Dean and Sam go their separate ways, despite Castiel’s urging that that’s exactly what Lucifer and Michael want. As usual, his protests are useless. Neither of them ever listen to him. The Winchesters are unreasonably stubborn, a quality that Castiel was initially fond of, but now considers it to be their biggest human flaw.
