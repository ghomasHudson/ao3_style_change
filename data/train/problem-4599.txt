“Great,” she put her hands together. “Let’s go through it step by step. Who are they for?”
“What?”
Cas considered this. “I better tell you over breakfast. Otherwise you might just leave me and eat all the waffles yourself.”
So he said, “Hi.”
Bobby waited a moment before asking: “How did you know the French fries would lead us to her?”
“Paintball is closed on Saturdays,” he said. Dean rolled his eyes.
“Do you like it?”
“You know that’s not true.”
It was never a thing to confess over the phone, anyway. “I love you”? Maybe. “I think you might love me back”? Perhaps. “I’ve been in love with you for over seven years, have wanted to kiss you every time you touched me, and have been wishing I could see you in person one more time in the past five years while you were just thinking of us as friends”? Not so much. In fact, he hadn’t realized how creepy it would have sounded if Dean turned out not to feel the same way.
“Show me,” said Castiel, his curiosity sparked.
“Protect you from the females?” Dean grinned.
“Why is it funny?” Asked Castiel.
“What?”
“I was aiming for strange,” Dean said.
See how his teacher liked that. He wasn’t breaking any rule.
“Next time, fix the mailbox,” he said when he entered.
“Good night,” said Castiel and turned to go, playing it cool, as if Dean and him weren’t terrified of new-house anxiety resulting in a sleepless night for all of them.
“I guess our place is a dump,” said Castiel.
“Yes,” Dean choked out.
“Alright,” said Meg and crossed her arms. “Who wants to do the penis?”
"Upstate," said Dean, at the same time Claire said, "Alabama."
Now it was Dean’s turn to squint. For a moment, it seemed, they were having a stare-down. Then he said, slowly, “what do you know?”
“Guys,” Kevin put his palms in the air. “Chill.”
"Alright, alright," he said. "I believe you. C'mon, we're gonna be late."
He shrugged. “Maybe?”
“We clean up,” Dean protested. He threw the shirt towards the bed. It hit the floor.
Castiel stepped closer and put a hand on his shoulder. “Dad, get up.”
“Alright,” Dean said. He thought about putting a hand on Cas’ shoulder.
When they left, Charlie and Sam gave him a tight hug. Bobby patted his back and said “See you, kid.”
“Okay, I did not come here with two dates for them to both sit in the corner and complain,” said Dean.
“Hey.” Dean tugged on his hand, and smiled the way he did when he knew he was being sweet. Castiel didn’t usually ignore that smile so blatantly. “I just wanna be with you.”
“You’re the next best thing,” Charlie teased. “So, are you going?”
Dean shrugged, a hesitant smile on his face, testing the waters between them.
Claire pulled at his leg. “Less go,” she said. “Less go.”
“No,” Dean said. “Yes… it’s hard to explain. What you did, it was out of self defense, right?” Cas nodded. “What I did, I did to defend other people.”
Dean turned around to face him. "Accountant?" He asked "Why did you have to say accountant?"
He just didn’t get it. His brother’s obsessive search for an explanation, for a happy ending. Cas was the love of his life for a good long while, and then one day he just disappeared. Maybe he died. Maybe he had a good reason for it. Or maybe he just left. It didn’t matter; Dean’s heart turned to stone all the same, and it wasn’t planning on opening up to anyone anytime soon. And it wasn’t like he could grab a search party and go on a search –
“So,” he said after a few minutes, his tone casual. “There’s something I was wondering about.”
“Jesus.” Sam opened the car door for his brother, looking at Castiel. “Does he lie to me often?”
“Dean. Open up. Dean!”
“Aha,” said Meg. “Is he also emotionally unavailable during the winter?”
“Dean.”
“Of course grades don’t matter,” Dean said on his other side.
Castiel shook his head. “I don't think you're a nightmare. I love you. I'm here because I wouldn't rather be anywhere else.”
“This isn't so bad,” said Dean, watching the sky. Seeing Castiel’s expression, he added, “I meant the weather.
“You're being a brat!” Gabriel flicked him on the forehead.
Finally, Cas nervously twisted a loose string in his shirt and said, “The things I said were uncalled for. You know I'd stick with you no matter what happens.”
For a long moment, everyone was silent.
New house. New neighborhood. New life. Without his father, and without most of his siblings, most likely, but with a new family of his own. In two weeks Dean will turn twenty-two in this house. One week later Claire will turn three.
He paused for a moment. “You okay?”
He found it in his pocket. He tried to phrase a message to Dean.
Around them, people drained from the room like gushing water. In a moment of weakness, trying to ignore the pain that was shooting through his body – shoulder to toes – Dean's head tipped forward and his forehead came to rest on Cas’ shoulder.
“Mhm?”
“Yes,” he said, shaking his head. “What are we arguing about?”
“Beautiful,” she said with a wrinkled nose. “Maybe you should start by consuming.”
They waited hours at the hospital.
“Nothing.”
They both turned to look at her, dressed in a black leather jacket, not looking one bit bothered by the cold, even though there were specks of white snow on her jacket shoulders.
“All of us.”
“If you touch me-“ he started , but Cas cut him off.
“Come on,” he said softly. “I’m buying you coffee, and then you’re going home.”
“Nothing?” Asked Bobby. “You met the girl. She didn’t give you any clues?”
“So they’ll judge us.”
“You’re gonna buy two pairs of pink glittery socks just to do a sock slide?” Dean lifted his eyebrows lightly, ignoring the fact that this was absurd for so many other reasons.
“Cas?” He said again, lost as to what he should do next. He didn’t know what the etiquettes of a “my crush fell asleep in my bed” situation were. Does he leave him there and sleep on the couch? Does he wake him up? Does he… squeeze in?
“If you say so,” she said skeptically, and kept writing. “How was that painting called, with the two people kissing with a fabric covering their heads?”
“Principal’s office,” the teacher said with taut lips. “Now.”
“Not any of those things,” he said.
“If you have to see my garbage apartment five times a week,” Dean shook his head, “It’s only fair I’ll have to see your garbage dad once a year.”
“But... Dean is a guy’s name,” said Kevin.
“Or hoped we would,” answered Bobby. He tracked the invisible line from Dean’s elbow to the borders of the picture, and said: “Church. He’s pointing at a church.” He looked at Castiel. “Let’s go.”
“Hey, Cas,” said Charlie, leaning over the counter. “You free this weekend?”
“No one,” Dean grumbled. “Butt out.”
“Yes!” Dean was breathing heavy, and back to wishing he were buried in sand. “I meant yes. I’d love to hang out sometime. Bye now!”
“Dean!” She said, pulling him into a hug. Then she let go of him and hugged Cas.
. It goes in the box, and then out the box. That’s all there is to it.”
He tried not to think about it.
The therapist’s office was inside her house. Castiel knocked on the door when they arrived. It took a couple of minutes for it to open.
Someone yelled ‘
“I’m kind of freaking out,” Dean managed in a strained voice when she looked up.
“That he got a lead. And that it was urgent. It didn’t say anything else.” Nothing else that wasn’t for Castiel. Nothing else besides those two little words in the end in Dean's terrible handwriting.
Dean looked to his right.
“Ground rule,” Dean said. “You can’t be annoying.”
, he wanted to tell her. He placed his elbows on the counter and pretended to read the monthly sale sign again.
“Well, then, here’s me not making a big deal by taking you somewhere special – the exit to the Gymboree – and giving you a small gift, lacking proper wrapping or a card.” And indeed, he took out of his coat what appeared to be a large stick wrapped in old newspapers and handed it to Castiel. “Happy birthday.”
He sat back down, and Dean filled the kettle. He got a message.
Vest lady wouldn’t let go, and Dean could kiss her for it. She wanted to try out all the sizes from all the high shelves. Slowly, Dean’s eyes pulled towards them, watching Cas’ sanity unravel, until Cas looked up and their eyes met before Dean could look away. Cas waited for the woman to turn away before dragging a finger across his throat, and Dean broke into a smile in spite of himself.
Earlier that day, Dean was sitting on a bench.
“You’re not supposed to understand,” he muttered. “You’re not a civil engineer.” He turned back and faced the guests in hopes Cas would lose interest and go, but the turd didn’t leave.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, the job is in eight hour shifts, nine bucks an hour. How do you feel about cleaning?”
“Who!” The figure roared when it was met with silence. Castiel could tell it was a man, and that the outline of his hair was short and spiky. He squinted harder.
“Weapons.”
“Really?”
“That was quick,” he said.
about it, and except, it’s..." He gestured at the two of them. “It’s disgusting.”
“I’m not accepting judgment from someone whose outfit looks like a human crow costume.”
Castiel opened his mouth, then closed it, and then opened it again. And then he closed it.
Dean laughed tightly. “Okay. Make fun of me. But you know, I thought it could make for a cool gift to keep in your room and also, uh, take around with you.”
“I don’t want to be flicked either,” he protested. Dean gave him the ball and grabbed the rubber band bag.
Cas drank it – but nothing happened. They stared at each other, lost.
“I don’t think you should be playing with that,” he said and got up to replace the bullets with Timothy the Destroyer. An insulted crying ensued. He gave up trying to use Timothy as middleman and picked her up. She calmed down instantly. Babies were the worst form of torture.
“Thanks.”
“Yeah, I guess.”
The doctor slid his glasses on and looked through his files for a moment. Then he eyed Claire and Jack.
Whether he should keep it from Dean, just in case.
“Meaning, he’d be staying here,” said Dean.
“You were in the middle of telling me something,” Cas said.
“I think it’s a little too soon for that.”
Castiel grimaced. “I don’t think it’ll be that easy.”
“Didn't you have the thing?” Offered Dean, and they both turned to look at him.
“Dreaming about lunch.” Charlie let out a sigh. “I wish someone looked at me the way Cas looks at a chocolate soufflé.”
"Dean. It's me."
Dean thought he heard Charlie mutter, “Have you looked in a mirror lately?”
Inside, Bobby was talking to someone.
This was their way, pretending to not care about each other at all, and Cas stuck faithfully to his role. And so did he; or, at least, he tried. Sometimes – and these were the most frightening moments – he felt that Cas was seeing through him, seeing that he really did care. And he couldn't think of something more frightening than showing feeling to someone who didn't show feeling to you.
He almost felt like rolling his eyes.
“So I’m a ‘him’ now?”
“Is he alright?” He asked when they were alone.
“Hey,” he said when he saw Castiel.
Dean frowned. “Who’s calling you in the middle of...” he glanced at the clock. “Eight thirty in the evening?”
“Cas?”
“Can we not talk about this?” He asked.
“Window. Dean, listen. I know you're a spy. I was assigned to kill you.”
Two years of neither of them bringing it up, not even by a hint. Two years of stumbling around it and never addressing it except, occasionally, when a friend made a mistake and brought it up by accident when they were in the same room. And now... now this. Standing in Cas’ kitchen, making cookies, and doing their best to ignore this weight between them.
"There's way too much blood for him to be okay," Claire whispered weakly.
Shit. Sam’s mask. He had no idea where it was.
They continued washing in silence. When they finished, Castiel grabbed his backpack and headed upstairs. His room was the first door on the left, which generally meant he didn’t have to think of the half-dozen other empty ones down the hall. Chuck typically fell asleep on his armchair with some kind of book about religion on his chest, so Castiel had the second floor more or less to himself. Which meant it was neat. And quiet.
“No,” said Dean. “I don’t have any problem.”
He shook his head and picked up a journal from one of the shelves. “What’s this?”
“Listen,” he said, clearing his throat. He liked this setup: him behind the wheel, being able to avoid eye contact if he wanted to get real. “I know what I did was wrong…”
“So this was all just a trick?” He said through his teeth. His mind was already mapping out the weak spots in Dean’s body, devising a strategy against his heart’s will.
"This isn't some cute vampire case," he hissed. They were almost at the car now, and neighbors could be watching from their windows. They'd spent weeks keeping the mailbox straight and fruitless. He owed it to Cas, now, not to raise suspicion any other way. "This is the big league, and you could get seriously hurt."
“Okay,” said Dean. “Okay. On one condition. You always have the take-back option.”
“Please don’t do that,” he muttered quietly, and Dean’s eyes locked on his for a short moment. Then he leaned back and started undoing the bandage around Castiel’s arm.
“I lost my fangs,” Dean said, touching his tongue to his teeth. The whole world was quiet except for the sound of their feet on the asphalt.
“Yeah.” Dean’s voice came out a little hoarse. He cleared his throat.
“Uh…” Cas scanned their selection of sandwiches behind the display case. It gave Dean a moment to look at him freely from a short distance for the first time. His dark hair was short and still somewhat disheveled. His shoulders were squared, straight and proud, as if he made a point of not caring what anyone else thought about him – or maybe as if he were waiting for an arrow to pierce through his back.
Dean replied dryly, but anxiety simmered beneath his indifferent façade. “Checking out the view from the second floor ain’t quite the same as free-falling from the roof, Cas. And besides,” he added in a mutter, “it’s easier when I have control over the situation."
"What is it?"
Something happened that moment. Cas had given his hat up without second thought, like it was nothing at all – but that was just it. It was nothing at all to him. No one was watching them, no one was expecting him to do anything for Dean now, not even Dean himself. He wasn’t just pretending to care anymore – no, he couldn’t possibly. He couldn’t possibly be pretending. But he couldn’t possibly care, also.
“Uh…” Dean’s eyes wandered over to Charlie again. She glared back. “Yeah. Okay. I’m working Saturday, so maybe in the morning?”
Castiel was tired of pink.
And then Dean became distant, all at once.
He raised his eyebrows at Castiel, and Castiel returned him a puzzled look.
Dean wasn’t just his fiancé, and he wasn't just a love interest. He was his best friend, a person, a whole
His fingers closed around the hilt of his weapon, colder than the silver they were gripping.
There was soft jazz music coming out of the speakers that was something between spooky and sexy. Dean turned to him and said,
"Let's go," he said to Claire. Cas halted.
“Check this out,” said Dean.
At that, the crew cheered more enthusiastically, although Castiel spotted the taller man crossing his hands against his chest, sourly excluding himself from the whooping crowd.
“No, they aren’t. Now, go to sleep. You don’t want to be tired on your first day of new kindergarten.”
Castiel stared at him; he was expecting an argument.
“What?”
“You’re the one who brought it up,” Michael snapped at him. He shook his head again. “You two are unbelievable.”
“No idea.”
“How long?” Dean asked. He wasn’t asking out of interest. His voice was thin with disapproval.
“This is hardly important right now,” Dean frowned at them, stabbing a finger at Castiel’s number-map. His hand was still shaking. “We’re getting closer to the treasure.”
“It's a matter of habit." Dean grimaced. "The bed is colder without him. It's a temperature thing. You wouldn't be able to sleep either in the middle of winter if I took your heater away.”
“You do text weird,” he said.
“I’ll buy you a soda.”
“Let’s go,” Cas said suddenly, and stood up, reaching down a hand.
“Don't jinx us, man.”
“Are you in the middle of something?”
“Oh my god!” Said Dean. “A stick.” But when he pressed the button, the stick turned into a glowing sword.
“How is that strange?”
“He kind of hates me,” said Dean.
Dean sings, his voice low and rough,
Castiel let out a sigh. He made an effort to lift his head, then turned it so he could see Dean, then he plopped it on the pillow again. "If you push me off the bed, I will sit on you."
“Okay.”
“Yeah,” Dean smiled. “I’m glad we’re on the same page. Okay, break time.”
“Must’ve been pretty serious if he left in such a hurry,” Bobby muttered on the other end.
They sat for a while, Castiel praying the child won’t poop or start crying, and her not seeming to be concerned about his emotional state whatsoever.
“Consider it more of a recruitment,” said the other man.
“Yeah...” Castiel ran a hand through his hair. “Only, this one is Satan’s child.”
Waiting for Dean to open the door was a little nerve racking.
Castiel blinked rather dumbly, and shoved his hands in his pockets. “…No.” He rubbed a hand at his face tiredly. “I guess I just… needed a break.”
“It’s okay,” Dean patted his shoulder. “You can stay. I don’t want to spend the night with a guy who’d rather be with someone else.”
“So, anyway,” said Dean and turned away from the group. “I promised I’d help you study.”
Dean’s face hardened and he stared at Castiel, taken aback. “I’m not going without you.”
He walked around the bed and changed into sleepwear. “She took it alright,” he said when Dean didn’t say anything.
“I don't care about that,” Dean said, although he didn’t like the label. It wasn’t like he suddenly stopped liking girls. Or started liking guys who didn’t call him a nerd and held his hand through the trees in a remote location. He shook his head. “It's Cas. It's
“Would you mind watching over her until I come back? It’s much harder to pretend to be a nurse and hack into a computer while carrying a friendly baby.”
“Thanks for having my back, guys,” said Sam.
“Yeah, I have some things to take care of too.”
"You know what, this isn't the best time. Thanks, though."
She leaned against the counter and looked into his eyes with an intensity that made him uncomfortable. “Not even a crush?”
“You’re soulmates,” she sighed.
Dean looked up at him. “Oh.”
“You’re different,” Dean said, his eyes on the ceiling. “Dating is stressful. Friends aren’t stressful. Also, this is for free.”
“Timothy, the Destroyer.”
“What?”
“It’s got salt.”
They swapped hands. Dean read and nodded. He went and climbed the spar, doing as Castiel said. Then he slid down and spoke to Jo, who turned the wheel and started navigating out of the maze of rocks at his words.
– own way, she was. And she was so clean, Castiel could see his reflection on her.
Cas touched his hand and pulled his attention from the body. “Are you alright?” He looked genuinely concerned.
Meg’s expression softened. She looked over at Garth; he was looking at her with the same distress.
“Told ya,” the girl’s voice says. She pops her gum.
“So, eh... Who’s stronger?”
“Okay,” said Dean again, rather nervously, and swallowed. “What’s wrong?”
Crowley had said he would have to charm his way through this one, befriend the spy before he could get him alone and inflict permanent damage upon him. He deemed the mission more than possible: after spending days and weeks looking at girls, listening to girls, smelling them, tasting them on certain occasions – Castiel didn’t think spending his time wooing a guy in a considerable distance from any human female would constitute much of a challenge.
“The upside of being an adult, though, is that no one can tell you to be an adult,” Dean grinned. “So... takeout?”
He didn’t answer. Claire was soundly asleep in her crib between the bed and the window, and he watched her little chest rise and fall. He’d gotten used to doing that at nights. He was pretty sure babies didn’t work that way, but there didn’t seem to be any guarantee that she wouldn’t just stop breathing at any random moment.
“Oh.”
"Yes."
And now they were both looking different places, not knowing how to avoid the unavoidable.
“A bunch of 'em,” he said. “Why? Did I say something weird?” He tugged on Castiel’s sleeve. “Cas, what did I say?”
Dean’s tone changed whenever he found something interesting that he didn’t know before. Sometimes he stuttered at ancient Greek names he couldn't pronounce. And all the while, his smile would resurface upon random things Castiel said, which was confusing, because it wasn’t mocking or self-assured or even humorous. All he could pick up from that smile, was that it was genuine.
“She thinks it’s
Dean put the rifle down, took the dragon, and turned on his heel, grinning at Castiel. “Ten out of ten,” he said. “Consider yourself a loser.”
“Great. I’ll get him a sleeping bag or something. We don’t have an extra mattress. Lemme just give him a call.”
“Oh. That’s too bad.”
“It’ll just be an hour.” Dean put on his best pleading voice. “And then you can go back to... whatever you were on your way to do.”
“She’ll be back later.”
Speaking of thanks; “Ms. Mills gave us these today.” He pulled a paper out of his bag and gave it to Dean.
Castiel believed him.
“Post Impressionism and Expressionism?” Dean suggested, pointing left.
“So what did you do?”
“Does anyone ever believe that?” Castiel muttered at Dean. But then he recalled what his brother had said when he entered the room.
“Please don’t go,” Cas said. His eyes were pleading.
“No,” he said. “No, I’m going back home tonight.” He wasn't going to leave that place for a minute longer than he had to, if there was a chance Dean was coming back to it – hurt, or needing him, or just plain coming back home.
A car honked in the parking lot.
by Roy Lichtenstein,” he said. That was a lie. His favorite was another one by Felix Gonzalez-Torres. It was called
"Hey," Dean called after him. "Where are you going?"
He looked at Cas, working quietly beside him. He seemed to be deep in thought.
He didn’t mention how it never worked out, and Dean didn’t mention why. Though he felt like it was fairly obvious, with the way he was looking at Cas, lips dry and face hot and almost on the verge of panic.
“Hey, Sam,” she said and sat on the couch. At her feet, Charlie was gawking.
“You work at a pastry shop,” he retorted. “Do you care about pastries?”
“Yes,” Dean says, and there’s passion in his voice now; he’s making a point. “But also society’s expectations of you to keep everything inside. I can’t just come to this person and say, listen, dude, you’re my entire world. Even if I think they feel the same way, I’m still expected – especially as a man – to pretend like I don’t care as much as I do.”
“Castiel. Holy cow, where have you been?”
"It's just turbulence." Cas took his hand and rubbed his own shoulder with a wrinkled nose. "Are you okay?" he asked softly.
It also didn’t help that on Monday morning, being too sick to show up to school, he was avoiding Dean’s calls and instead distracted himself by tidying his room. There, on the floor, he found the newspaper Dean had used to wrap his present in. He picked it up, about to throw it in the trash, when he caught the headline:
“Garth wants to talk to you,” Balthazar said to the back of his neck.
“Assholes, right?” She squinted at his crestfallen face. “Hold on. You weren’t planning on...”
“Oh! Right.”
Cas’ eyebrows furrowed. “I’m pretty sure we’re related.”
Almost failed.
"I told you there's nothing going on between us." The picture of Dean right before he left the class kept floating up in his mind, like a dead fish that wouldn’t sink. He couldn't shake off the feeling that something was wrong.
The mountainous path was treacherous and slippery. Between his father and his brother, Dean took one last glance as the sea filled up the valley like water pooling up in a sink, and rode into the mountains. Beside him, John rode fast and close. He sent out his hand towards Dean, and pulled it back. With a heavy heart, he urged his horse forward and the beast picked up its pace.
“Do you think someone’s playing a prank on us?” The space was so packed that her right side was pressed against his left.
Dean wrote.
“How was your day?” Hearing Dean’s voice felt like coming home. He almost couldn’t believe they had seen each other less than twelve hours ago.
“It’s a theory,” Dean said, watching him turn around. “That the most functional material hasn’t been invented yet. See, it’s six mini models of the Aqueduct of Segovia, made out of wood, clay, stone, glass, metal and plastic. In the essay I described each of these materials’ advantages and disadvantages. Durability and practicality have improved over the years, but there is still a discussion about which is the ultimate material to use in civil engineering. If you read my essay you’ll…” He paused and squinted. Cas frowned in response.
“Right,” said Naomi, and looked right at Dean with a piercing hostility. Beneath the table, Dean’s knee pressed against his nervously.
Dean grimaced at her.
On October 31, Cas wore a Grinch costume and jump scared him. On November 10, Dean stole Cas’ rock collection and buried it in the campus park, replacing on Cas’ shelf a treasure map leading to it. It took Dean four hours to carry out his misdeed, and Cas twice that time to get a hold of his rocks again.
He hadn’t felt that way since the last time he saw Dean.
Castiel wanted to like libraries. They were quiet and full of books and on paper, that sounded ideal. But in practice all the books were so used they left his fingers black with grime, and the fluorescent lights weren’t exactly serene, and whenever there were other people in sight he felt like he was doing something wrong, standing in the wrong spot or taking someone’s chair.
Cas was pursing his lips. “I just wouldn’t want to come between anything.”
Castiel had never been choked before, and honestly, it was worse than he’d imagined. “If you think that about a punch in the face,” he croaked. “Then you’re not going to love me after this.” And he thrusted his blade into her chest.
There were two floors to the SPN High library (the acronym stood for Stark, Parker & Negasonic Teenage Warhead): one for studying, with big tables and plastic chairs (the fancy kind) and rows of shelves along the walls, filled with study books and novels the school deemed teen-appropriate. The other, below it, was a proper library with columns of high shelves and a reading corner with stiff armchairs. It was mostly for the students and parents with small kids, but occasionally there was an old person sitting about.
It was dark inside – Castiel didn’t understand how the wood of the deck blocked the sunrays so thoroughly. There were lamps – torches inside a casing of glass fixed into the wall every few feet, and inside the rooms – small, crammy spaces with cots and bags. Dean stopped at the end of a hallway and entered an oblong room, thrice the size of the sleeping rooms. He stood before a long, rectangular table, and turned to Castiel. Charlie and Sam stood at the entrance, almost at the threshold but still inside the room.
“I’m doing alright.”
And that’s when Castiel could tell this time was different.
Sometimes it was hard not to be nice to someone, even if they assumed the worst in you.
She was infuriating. She was infuriating, because she knew just what buttons to push to get her way.
“Kansas?” Castiel smiled faintly.
So Mary made a run for the supermarket to get more ice cream, and they huddled around the TV again – Dean squeezed into the corner of the couch this time, and Cas on the floor before him. He looked up at Dean every couple of minutes or so, smiling or lifting an eyebrow, but Dean always returned a blank stare. He couldn’t concentrate on the flickering pictures on the screen – his mind could only focus on Cas’ shoulder blades leaning back against his knees, and on the untouched drink in his hands which Cas had brought to him before he sat down. When the movie was over, he climbed up to his room without saying a word, only making sure that Cas followed and wasn’t about to fall asleep on the living room carpet.
“That’s disgusting.”
“The committee has spoken!” Dean exclaimed with in same dramatic outburst as before. As if that was a perfectly good answer to Castiel’s argument, or perhaps an assurance that a sensible answer will not be provided, he patted Castiel’s injured shoulder and stood up.
Lying on the floor and listening to the stones come closer and closer to shattering the glass one floor below him, he heard his phone buzz.
Dean’s eyes glinted anxiously in the dark, and it was clear that these words took great energy out of him. This was the first time he’d shown insecurity in the Claire business, and he was scared Castiel would snatch the opportunity to make the decision for them that Dean thought he’d wanted to make. The decision that he himself felt responsibility to make.
Dean shuffled out of his range effortlessly.
Naomi lowered her voice. “I know you want everyone to think you’re a tough guy, but I’ve seen how hard you work. I’ve seen how much you care. And I know you’ll do yourself a favor and write this assignment, whether you like it or not.” She said that and walked off with her chin raised.
“Uh… Person,” said Dean. “I don’t know your name.”
and walk away.
"It's just weird. We're a family."
It was a beautiful scene. John’s kingdom lay in a valley between the great mountains and the endless ocean. It was a small, peaceful, perfectly boring place, which Dean hoped to never be king of. The only thing duller than being prince, he determined, was being king.
“That’s great,” Dean said, searching in his face for that same sentiment.
There was only a ladder leading to the roof.
Castiel raised an eyebrow at him. “I thought we were coming here ironically.”
And they both looked up at him from the other side of the table, one with a smile, and one seemingly posing a challenge.
Dean’s expression lifted with apparent pride. “That’s what I do.”
“No, I’m not.”
“We need to go,” he seethed.
“’Their eyes were burned to a crisp in an unexplained attack’,” Castiel kept reading, more quietly. Dean walked over and looked at the screen behind his shoulder. “’The cause of death is still unclear’.” He scrolled down to a picture. The area around the bodies’ eyes was completely black. “What does that?”
Dean was sitting in the same chair he himself had taken earlier, next to the child. When Castiel walked out he stood up swiftly.
Maybe it wasn’t going to be a disaster at all. The only job he’d ever had was in Crowley’s eerie escape room, and he didn’t know how Dean was managing it alone, now that he was in college. Just being in that building made you feel like a demon was about to jump at you from the ceiling.
“Good news,” Dean grinned, and crashed into him. For half a second, he could only feel relieved. And then he froze, and Dean froze in his arms, too.
The actual circumstances didn't have much more to them than it seemed. They had met on a bench, and now they were here. That was, in the most extensive way of telling the story, pretty much it.
Inside the store, Dean turned on the lights and took off his coat. “Of course I’m counting.” Meg closed the doors back up and headed to the storage room to put away her things. “How else would I cultivate my grudge?”
Cas grimaced. “No need to say it like an insult.”
“What were you doing there-?”
And it was kind of sweet. How Dean always offered him a ride even though he never needed one.
The first problem was that Dean was getting attached. It was all the little things: the furrow between his eyebrows that appeared whenever the girl frowned. His unaware smile when she did things like shove a finger up her nose and dig up a piece of snot or slam a toy against her head, whine weakly and then slam it again. And his absolute devotion to all the hardest things; change diapers. Stay up for hours every night until the screaming stopped. Flu shots.
When his shift ended, Dean took his things and left without another glance at the bookstore. He stopped by a trash can and took the paper out of his pocket. He couldn’t write another one by Monday; he just didn’t have whatever it was that enabled you to be a good writer. Or any kind of writer. He could turn in this crumpled paper and deal with the consequences of his teacher seeing this far into his heart, or he could start bracing himself for his mother’s reproach when he failed the assignment.
and started typing – and then clicked back on the existing tab. It was an article from a few days back, and it read:
“Cas,” she said softly.
“And who other than a pirate would have a treasure map in his possession?”
Castiel leaned back in his chair, inhaled, exhaled.
"I love it when I can afford it," said Dean. "Now, get up, or I'll push you off the bed, because we're gonna be late."
Dean kept leaning on him. The students didn’t talk anymore, but they looked around and coughed and played with their shoelaces. Whatever this hypnotizer thing was… It didn’t turn them into zombies. He was a little ashamed of having expected that, now. He blamed Dean’s pop culture sci-fi movies.
Finally, Dean broke.
He paced back and forth in front of his table, his small audience watching him like cats watching a bouncing ball.
“He was taken to an emergency surgery,” the nurse said gently. She might have mentioned her name earlier. He couldn’t remember.
On the other side, Naomi’s hawkish glare was on him in an instant, as though she’d been waiting for this moment since Dean had walked out of the room almost two weeks ago.
"Hear that, Claire? This guy's been shopping for diapers for almost a year and now he starts to feel like a family. There's Cas for you."
The demon was silent for a few moments.
“And our anniversary trip,” Dean added.
One of those people, that when they go away, they leave the people behind them in pieces. Like a tiny, tiny hole in the universe, just because of the way they were, just because of the way they smiled.
“Yes.”
“You-“ Dean gasped, shoving Cas’ side, and locked his jaw as he looked away. Trying to suppress a smile, Cas realized.
“You looked so surprised when I kissed you back.”
“To people who aren’t trying to get you into bed,” she protested. “Or into a... public bathroom stall. You guys are so gross.”
“Shut up,” he said, elbowing Castiel’s side, smiling. “Come on.” He hopped onto his feet and reached out a hand. Castiel took it, and Dean pulled him up.
“Doesn’t sound like any teenager
Claire sniffed determinedly and looked at him as though she was about to burst out crying.
Cas barely managed the walk to the car.
“Why has no one thrown me off board yet, then?” He grumbled. It sounded almost like a complaint.
can’t stay away from,” Castiel clarified to Sam Winchester as they walked into his brother’s kitchen.
Beside her, Dean let out a nervous laughter. “Yeah, that would be crazy,” he said. Castiel eyed him. He touched the back of his neck awkwardly.
“You... what?” Asked Castiel.
“He’s hooking you.”
It hung between them. They’d known each other for almost a year, and still he never invited Dean to his house. He didn’t mean to be rude – he was just scared Dean would judge him, even if he didn’t mean to. And so, to break the tense silence, he gave in.
out of my league. So painfully, devastatingly out of my league.”
“I’m going to take a walk,” he said and left the room. Down on the gravel path, he called Dean.
“Why would I not want to hear it?” Dean shot back. “Why would I beg you to keep this up? Why would I get so hurt when you tried to back away?”
“Well, you and that guy before you were the only human beings who applied for the job, if you know what I mean,” said Crowley. Castiel really didn’t know what he meant, and he found it bizarre, but it was just another reason to leave.
“Thank you,” he told Bobby. “Really.”
“Right.”
Cas’ mouth closed. He smiled pleasantly at her. “Let me show you to the sweater vests.” He exchanged another look with Dean before pushing past him gently towards the women’s section.
No, yeah, he could definitely get used to this.
“No! Cas. You know she’s wrong.”
“Are you alright?” He asked into the phone, his voice softer now.
Waking up in Dean’s bed the next morning was surreal. Trying to get used to living somewhere he wasn’t used to calling his own was surreal.
Not that it mattered. Dean had gotten the complete opposite of his desired result, and despite the awesomeness of everything around him, the people were still gross. It was too loud to hear anything, and the floor was already sticky with spilled drinks and God knows what else.
No, they wouldn’t just leave him be.
“Why would-” he started saying, but a ringing cut him off. A phone on the table that he hadn’t noticed was there before.
“Is he, though?”
They found the last coordinates at the center of a meteor crater, drawing the constellations in the sky. The shapes that matched the numbered map led them to a big island made of caves, with a thick layer of vegetation growing atop its gray stone.
By the time Castiel crossed the room, she was already gone.
After crossing half the ocean east, they could finally see their next stop: a distant island, resembling the Sirens’ one, maybe, but much larger, much higher and surrounded by sandy shores. To Sam’s dismay, Dean took out a few bottles of whiskey to celebrate. A couple of hours later most of Dean’s crew was knocked out in their beds, and Sam was manning the wheel. Castiel found himself up on the highest branch of the mast side by side with a drunk Dean, and he didn’t quite know what to do about it.
He almost made for the exit, but the next words he overheard over locker-room chatter made his limbs freeze and his heart race.
Claire took that in with a creased forehead. "I don't think he was asking you to change."
“Meg and I aren’t...” Cas shook his head and started over. “It's not...” He pursed his lips. His hands were stuck in his pockets, Dean could see from the corner of his eye. “It’s not like it never crossed my mind.” He paused there, and Dean’s heart fluttered in confusion. It wanted to leap out of his throat at Cas’ words, but sank at his tone. “But you're leaving,” Cas finished, and Dean nodded.
Dean didn’t know how to answer that. He tried not to think about those past three months, because he knew he would smile. The new way in which Cas’ eyes rested on him lately, slightly amused, impossibly soft, and still so very intense, never failed to make his heart jump to his throat.
“Really?” Dean raised an eyebrow.
The seniors sat in the back. No one said anything in fear that a teacher might hear and make them move, but relief was in the air; it was much easier to sleep through a lecture if you sat at the back of the room.
” He gasped. “You have a George Washington poster?”
Not that Cas would care. Cas didn’t want anything to do with him, he was positive. Cas probably told him he was smart just so he wouldn’t feel bad about himself – because Cas was… something else. How could anyone not feel bad about themselves when Cas was around, was a mystery to him.
“In the punch.”
"He'll call," she said.
“Of course,” said Chuck. “Hold on.”
“Then…?”
“Just checking in,” he answered, stepping inside. “How are you doing?”
The second time he woke up, it was actually morning. Something was nudging his arm, and something else was saying: "Cas. Cas. Cas." He turned around to see Dean, still half asleep beside him, poking him. "Wake up, you butt."
Dean looked at him thoughtfully. “Would help if you were a blond girl. We could use you as bait.”
Sam shook his head disbelievingly.
“Sorry,” he cut Dean off. “I meant the
“Oh. Well, after you heroically sacrificed yourself to protect me-”
“No problem,” said Cas. He stood there, hesitant, as though he wanted to go and wanted to stay at the same time. They looked at one another. Dean’s knuckles were white around his bag. Was he taller than Cas? He was taller, wasn’t he? He straightened his back. Yeah, he was definitely taller.
It wasn’t that he was mad at Cas. Hell, this is what he’d asked Cas to do – and he was doing a damn well job – he just wished having a partner wasn’t such a big deal, like it meant that he was happy or something. What if Cas was
“Is that thing going in our house?”
“Oh my God," Dean leaned in to look at the screen. "You have to open it.”
He didn’t want to start a fight.
He felt the rhythm of his heart pick up. But Dean didn’t seem to give his answer a second thought. They both remained quiet for the rest of the game.
He turned to the person behind him – Becky from chemistry. It was time to put his theory to test.
He left his phone on the table and went back to sit on the bed. While he felt the floor for his shoes, Dean swayed behind him.
“Now? That’s…” But he was already tearing the paper carefully, looking inside. “…A dagger.” He took it out of the wrapping, confused. “It’s a dagger.”
He took a breath and considered her words. Maybe this
“No cursing in front of the baby. Now, can we start?”
Time passed, and Castiel was getting better at not letting schoolwork consume his life. It wasn’t so bad with Dean studying alongside of him, as thin as his patience was. One week before high school would officially be behind them, having only one exam to go, Dean was beyond excited.
Chuck’s words had stirred something in him, something that made his jaw tight and his heart hard. It wasn’t the romance he was grieving; lovers could be replaced, as hard as it was to admit it.
“Sure,” he said. “Don’t you have a secret weapon stash in your closet?”
For some reason, Mr. Satan decided that six thirty in the morning would be a good time to meet in the school parking lot for the school trip. Castiel did not appreciate that decision.
He knew he’d chosen it. But still.
“Pass me that gross rag over there,” Garth said and gently started taking Dean’s shoe off. Cas handed him an old piece of cloth that was lying on the floor.
Except – he didn’t have to do everything his boyfriend told him to. He could do whatever he wanted. He could eat spider noodles if he wanted to. He could mingle. He could...
“Okay.” Dr. Hanscum spread her hands in a placating gesture. “Let’s start with a set goal. You mentioned you don’t know each other well enough. What
“It’s Cas,” Dean nodded with confidence, and everyone followed his stare to the back of the room.
“Gimme what you got.”
Castiel seemed to be persuaded.
“Kinda sounds like you do.”
Cas looked at him as if no one had ever said those words to him and meant them before. Then he looked away and cleared his throat. “Your turn.”
He leaned back in his chair. “What?”
“You watched Star Wars with me,” said Dean. “You didn't watch the Stars War with no one.”
He was the luckiest guy in the world.
“Shut up.”
“You’re not throwing popcorn into my mouth.”
“Holy mother burning in hell,” he muttered, stretching his arms in front of himself and gaping at them. “Holy mother.”
Castiel shook his head at the tea. “I didn’t choose this.”
“Why is it my job to narrate?”
“Do you think Richard didn’t realize how bad the name for this store was when he came up with it,” she asked after a minute, “Or was he the trickster type who pretended he had no idea what people were talking about when they said maybe he should change the name?”
It’s just – he didn’t really feel like going home. He didn’t feel like doing anything if it meant leaving Dean’s side.
showing. And that he didn’t look like an asshole walking around the house with no shirt all the time. Cas hated when he said that sort of thing, but he didn’t have much to show for his wits.
They stayed at the hospital overnight, moving between the cafeteria and the inpatient ward when the nurses weren't looking.
“I know this wasn’t your first option,” Dean said to the cash register. “And that you just want this day to be a little more fun, or a little less... unbearable, but I just-” he looked up at Cas, and the words caught in his throat. How he wanted to say something else. How he wanted things to be different. “I just need to be alone for a little while, okay?”
“Cas, I’m not getting into bed with you,” he said through clenched teeth. Cas’ clouded eyes cleared for a moment, though his pulling at Dean’s wrist remained insistent.
“Well,” Castiel straightened his back. His intense stare, not leaving Dean’s eye for a single moment, was as intimidating as it was oddly intimate. “I happened to hear,” he said, “a few days ago, from my dear friend Charlie, that she stole someone’s sandwich. And…” he tilted his head. “That that someone might be coming after her. She told me to keep an eye.” He said the last part of the sentence while squinting, as if emphasizing the words.
“You haven’t been here before?”
Cas’ expression softened, and it took a moment before he looked away from Dean.
Cas didn’t pull away.
“What? Dean, I doubt this is the time-“
“Isn’t she going to notice I’m... not a woman?” Cas asked then.
He snatched the laptop and his keys, rushing over to the door and kicking his feet into his shoes.
“Sure we can.”
“Oh.” Dean dropped his hand. “Right. Yeah.” He leaned in again, but Cas put a hand against his chest. “What?”
He pouted. “Stop imagining it.”
was the weirdo, with a tilted head or a narrow squint.
“Demons got to him before we did.”
“You’re a nerd.”
Dean raised an eyebrow, though he wasn’t sure the gesture was visible behind the pink. “Is that a challenge?”
“What are you doing?” Dean asked. His voice was gruff from sleep.
“It will be really crowded.”
Only the fangs didn’t look so fake to him anymore.
“Wah.”
This time, his dad was there, helping him clean the blood.
But would he?
“We have nothing to lose,” he said in reply.
“Dean.”
“A soldier,” Castiel answered grudgingly. He was afraid there was no good wisdom in arguing with a man that’s holding a sharp object at your breathing canals.
“I dunno,” Dean was saying. “Somewhere she can run around. Somewhere she could actually have a room of her own. Somewhere that has a couch.”
“Are you scary?” Asked Garth.
“Not good ones," said Bobby. "I checked out the place from Dean’s security footage. There’s nothing there.”
And all Castiel could do was watch. And not get much sleep himself.
“Oh my god.” His eyes widened. “Mr. Rock Man?”
Castiel straightened up and stretched his arm. “So, I think that settles it,” he said in the most casual tone he could pull off.
The first signs of danger came at dawn. When they reached the first of the rocks, maneuvering became a real challenge. Castiel didn’t understand how Jo, at the wheel, was managing it. When the first, faint notes of a song were heard, Dean’s crew was ready – and just as bewildering as usual. The most of them were under the deck, covering their ears with their fists. Jo, her hands on the wheel, had Charlie covering her ears with a chain of crewmates behind her, each of them covering the ears of the person before them. The chain ended with Crowley, who seemed to be unexplainably immune to the sirens’ song. Castiel was covering his own ears with his fists, and beside him, the reason why all of them didn’t lose their minds to the unseen creatures within the rocks: a kid called Kevin, surely no older than eighteen, was sitting on a stool with a cello bigger than him and playing so loudly that Castiel felt he could unclench his fists and listen intently and still not fall under the influence of the creatures.
“Yeah,” said Anna.
“I'm the big spoon,” Cas said.
Meg hopped off the table and grabbed Dean’s hand. “Let’s go, lover boy.”
When he went back down, he found Dean watching the living room with his hands on his hips and a frown on his face.
“Oh,” Dean said, looking down at his clothes like he only now noticed he was underdressed.
Dean couldn’t see shit behind his mask, but he swore he felt the guy’s eyes on his face. He could almost feel Cas breathe, that’s how close he’d gotten. If they weren’t alone, surrounded only by vegetation, Dean would have wished he’d step back.
“Assbutt,” he shook his head. “I’m hanging up.”
"Alright," said Claire. "We've got two seats in the middle and two in the back. I'm-"
They moved along, plushy in hand. Dean insisted on carrying it.
“Making cookies.”
“We’re getting closer,” was all Dean said. That was what he always said.
He opened the drawer and sent Meg the pictures. Meanwhile, Dean kept browsing until he got bored and started watching dog videos. Then he fell asleep on his laptop.
He stood up, touching Dean’s shoulder, and went up the stairs.
Of course it was. He couldn’t catch a fucking break.
He didn’t look up from the tree. “Yeah.” But after a moment, he looked up. “Can I ask you something?”
Protect anyone in danger with his life (because he would be the only one able to once the aliens invaded).
“It ended,” Castiel replied. “If that counts.”
“Pretty much."
“Just- you know. Ten hour drive with me to spend the holiday with strangers versus four hours in the car with your dad and holiday with your family.”
“King Goop of the kingdom of Yeet!” Declared Mr. Man. “Cheer, humans!”
Beneath it was written:
"How you doing," he said to Jack, not really meaning it.
“No. Why?”
“It’s about school,” he replied offhandedly, and his eyes dropped again.
“I think your trip idea was good," he said to a street light they were standing by. "We should do that.”
They put on their coats and walked to the bus stop.
Really, it wasn’t weird that he didn’t turn on any lights when he came back from work late at nights and didn’t want to wake Cas up. Or that he laughed at all of Cas’ jokes even though everyone else thought they weren’t funny. No one ever seemed to look at him weird when he ordered an extra coffee for Cas in the morning, but in his head, nothing screamed
“You’ve...” Dean’s eyes skipped along his face, up and down, and he swallowed. “There’s something wrong, isn’t there? First thing you do when I walk in the door’s try to stab me, and you’ve barely said a word to me since then.”
“I don’t know,” said Castiel. Every time he said it, he felt more lost and helpless than the last.
Only Cas wasn’t just around him anymore. He was in Dean’s
He tried to concentrate.
Castiel looked around. The place was so big, he didn’t even know where to start. Already students were spreading in every direction. When Mr. Zach walked past them, Dean stopped him awkwardly.
“I know. But Cas, you shouldn’t feel bad about it. You should treasure it.”
“Cas, my project’s not a chick. You won’t get laid if you stare at it like that.”
"So the meeting happened," Dean said, half-assertion, half-question. He glanced over his shoulder. Claire was looking at him from the couch, not even pretending to not be eavesdropping.
He took a notebook out of his bag and tore a piece of paper from it. He used the side of the lockers for support and started writing.
“Writing is not an easy job." Her voice echoed. "Whether it’s a story, a letter, an article, a school assignment. Whether you’re telling a tale or reporting an event or laying down your heart on the page for everyone to see.” Charlie sighed beside him, and he glanced at her. She was listening intently, her back straight, as if anticipating something. Personally, Dean was anticipating a murderous unicorn-dragon hybrid to fall from the ceiling and rid him from this speech. “Some students are naturally good at it, some don’t try hard enough to earn the skill. But this year we witnessed something truly special.” Naomi’s eyes skidded across the crowd, searching for someone. “This year came along a student who had the talent all along, had the dedication, put in the work, but forced himself to swim against the flow instead of with it, produce the most spiteful and angry works he could. Until he didn’t.”
“Plastic,” Cas completed snarkily. “But I can give you guys a tour.”
“In general?” Dean asked, as they weren’t doing anything worth buying into in particular at the moment. Cas nodded.
Cas shrugged. “I tried to get him off me. I pushed him too hard. He fell off the balcony and hit his head. My brother Gabriel saw everything from inside. He saw the look on my face. He saw I hadn’t meant it. He told my family Michael tripped and that I had nothing to do with his death. So I moved into my brother Luci’s house instead of going into prison. It should’ve felt like a lighter sentence.” Cas swallowed. “It didn’t. Living with that particular brother was what made it clear to people that what they were hearing about me wasn’t just rumors. He’s got his own history with my siblings. His own reasons for living on his own. And I know it’s a horribly privileged thing to say, but… escaping the punishment I know I deserve isn’t the easiest thing to live with. Some nights I think about driving down to the nearest police station.”
Then he was quiet.
“I'm the dispensable one,” said Dean. “Everyone knows it. You know it. Claire knows it."
Castiel closed his eyes and rested his forehead against Dean’s, swallowing down the lump in his throat.
“It wasn’t a date,” Dean hissed, lowering his voice although there was no one around. “It was a stupid school assignment.” He looked at the paper miserably. “What do I do?”
Dean’s eyes stayed on the ground.
Dean wrinkled his nose. “You really know how to give a compliment.” But his grimace melted into a smile.
When they were finished, the captain took a step back to assess their handiwork.
“You're just gonna have to accept it eventually,” she said. “It's okay if it takes some time. But there comes a point when you're gonna have to stop looking."
“When?” Asked Charlie.
This was going well.
"I don't know," Jack mumbled. "Around here."
“Look, man, I feel you.” She leaned over the empty space between them and touched his shoulder. “I really do. But you guys dating... I mean, have you really managed to forget? It was brutal.”
“In my mind, you are blue,” Dean confirmed.
“That’s not a Cool Guy thing to say,” said Dean. “Dude, you gotta say a Cool Guy thing if you do the deep Cool Guy voice.”
"Why? Because this is my first time shooting something while you've had, how many years of practice? Two? Three?"
“Enough complaining!” The captain called. “Answer the question, or prepare to perish!”
Chuck patted his shoulder. “You alright?”
“Uh, yeah. Of course I remember,” said Castiel nervously. “I don’t have a list.”
“What’s that?” Asked the nurse who was checking him.
“Yeah, I killed one of those too back that way.” He pointed his thumb backwards.
“He said he’d be out in a minute to let me know,” he answered.
He didn’t say that. He said:
“I know. Get used to it.”
“What?”
“I’m calling about the... job counselling ad?”
"I don't need a symbol to..." he started. But then he huffed, thinking about their airborne ride home, and took it from her waiting hand. "Give me that."
He dropped his bag by the door and looked at the shelves. There was another picture – framed, between Aerosmith and Metallica records. He recognized Dean, though he was younger, with a ginger girl and an even younger boy. Standing in a park with his arms around them, smiling his genuine smile.
“Now,” Dean breathed. His jaw tensed as he looked down and tried to measure the distance they’d be falling through, or maybe their chances of survival. His dear, beautiful face was open with awe. “Now we jump.”
“Cas,” Dean stopped him. “Do you not want to go on this trip?”
“So, it would be pretty neat if we went to the same college, huh?” She said to Castiel. He tried to nod convincingly. From the corner of his eye, he could see the anger in Dean’s face wilt and become something that was more pained than it was anything else.
“And what?”
“I’m sober, Castiel,” he said. “Give me a reason to stay that way.”
“What?”
“I don’t think Dean is being unreasonable,” Dr. Hanscum offered now.
?” Castiel felt as though his eyes were about to bounce right out of their holes.
“You’ll be okay.”
Dean thought for a moment – or maybe just prepared himself. “My nightmares have been getting worse,” he said. “Not better. Okay, your turn.”
Dean urged him with a hand gesture. He stood up, his joints popping with relief at the stretch. Crewmembers were beginning to huddle up around them again.
God, he shouldn’t have entered this mess in the first place.
His thoughts were racing, but he couldn’t find any way around this. So, with some effort, he started climbing the ladder using only his two arms.
Never mind what he just thought. This was a dictatorship run by a buffoon.
“Are we a boring couple?”
“Yes,” he said finally. “It wasn’t half as fun, though.”
“Not so much.”
“Aren’t we having a hunter’s funeral?”
“What do you know about guys?”
“Aw, what? That sucks.”
“What are you doing up here?”
“Lunch,” Dean echoed. “Charlie, can I borrow your employee card?”
“I kind of gave up after I tried making you watch
Dean was waiting in the parking lot, leaning against his car. When Castiel approached he gestured at something behind him with his chin. Castiel turned to look: it was the graffiti.
“Really. Garbage.”
From the corner of his eye, he saw Meg approaching his table.
It was almost entirely silent; except, he was starting to hear footsteps. And they were walking right at him – or, at one of his reflections.
“So?” He asked.
He shoved his hands in his pockets and looked sideways at Dean. “You're the only person in the world I would go to a Valenween fair or to a Mr. Rock Man show for.”
“Where have you been?” He asked sternly, looking through the objects on the table.
“I'm not sure that's a good thing,” said Castiel.
“Fine!” Dean’s arms tightened across his chest. “We can take the bus.”
“You didn’t,” said Castiel. “I don’t care who I share a room with, Dean.”
“Your expression says there’s an and.”
"That's ridiculous," Castiel added. Then Dean said:
“Clearly, you’re not a house plant, or a soap kit,” said Castiel, and he didn't even care his voice came out bitter. “Because if you were, you wouldn’t talk as much.”
“Stop the pain,” said Sam.
“Ew.”
“Oh, fu-”
“Your eyes are so blue,” Dean mumbled. Castiel snorted.
“So what’s new with you?” It was a joke, clearly, but Castiel swayed in his chair.
Dean was standing in the middle of the room, looking at the closed door. Then he seemed to snap out of it and looked around the room.
"Seriously? Marriage problems?"
“What did you tell her?” He asked.
“Ha. You’re getting rusty,” Sam teased. Dean slumped into a chair. His hands were still quivering, if almost unnoticeably now.
“So perfect that I…” Cas looked at him, his eyes lucid as sapphires. “…That I lost my words.”
He looked at Cas – sitting across the room, reading a biology textbook.
“He keeps staring at you in this longing way,” she said. “The way you stare at burgers while standing in line at the cafeteria.” She shifted suddenly. “Oh, hey, loser.”
“My dad went through some serious crap,” he said, staring at the floor. “But he never gave up on us, no matter how real shit got. And I never gave up on him.” He was quiet for a while before he added, “We were just that kind of family, I guess.”
“Okay,” said Dean. He peeked into the living room again. “But you’re gonna have to trust me on this.”
“If you had to tell Dean something you knew would upset him... How would you go about it?”
Dean pulled backwards defensively. "Will you chill? I can't even say one sentence without you holding it against me."
“I’ll drop it,” Garth said, and Dean could hear and
“I don’t need a social mediator,” he said. Something about that rang familiar, took him back to a conversation he’d had with Dean once.
“What? Yes. Um. Since my dad died,” he nodded. For the rest of the ride, he looked Castiel in the eye.
God, this was ridiculous.
“Are we back on that?” Asked Hannah.
Sam patted on Charlie’s back reassuringly. “How do you wanna do it?” He asked.
In his socks and sweatpants, he tiptoed across the hall until he reached room number twenty-four. He turned the knob slowly, opened the door to a slit… and then, swiftly, flung the door open and shut it behind him, skipping around notebooks and stumbling on piles of clothes.
“…Shirt,” he finished faintly, his eyes skipping across the faces in the room and finally landing on his shirt. Sam and Jo stared at it, their eyes almost jumping out of their sockets.
It wasn’t quite the romance.
Chuck looked at him. “I’m not-” But someone honked in front of them, and he looked back at the road just in time to brake so abruptly it threw Castiel against his seat belt.
“Cas...” said Dean. “If we give this kid to the authorities, she's gonna spend the rest of her life in orphanages.”
“Yeah, I guess,” Cas answered. And then his head shot up, and his eyes looked like they could burn down a forest.
Dean snorted. “You really suck at making jokes, man.”
Dean walked over to stand by him, quiet, not sure whether Cas had said anything that he’d missed.
He didn’t expect that, coming from her. He almost asked:
“We can fit together.”
A heartbeat’s hesitation.
"I don't want to cause any trouble."
Only, until Dean came along, he never accounted for having to leave someone behind that he didn’t want to leave. Leaving his father – that he had expected. And he knew it wouldn’t be easy, but he was ready.
"Ugh. You are, aren't you? Because, you know, we could put a bell around your neck, or you could just meow."
“I’ll take flower arranging,” he said, and before he could regret it, he grabbed his bag and left the classroom.
He had to be at the dance. He was Anna and her date’s ride; and it was for the best, since he
“Hold on,” he said, to make the person repeat themselves, and to give himself a moment to recover. “What?”
“Enjoy,” she said through her perfectly fake smile. “And tell your friend he’s an ass.”
“Alright.” He patted Dean’s shoulder. “There you go.”
Garth sat on his bed five feet away, doing something on his computer.
“Hey.” She sounded surprised. Castiel took a moment to vaguely wonder whether she’d gotten the impression he was screening people from people he was screening. “What’s up?”
“Oh,” Dean said. “You and your dad?”
“But he wouldn’t have just left.”
They didn’t even drive off the road.
Tucked behind it was a page listing the uses and benefits of the card. Entrance to the shop, discount on meals in any of the street’s restaurants and cafés and a variety of discounts in other stores on the street, including Page Turner. He scoffed. As if he’d ever need a discount for a bookstore.
“They’ve been taking turns.”
“Not being able to admit how strong your feelings are.”
The doors close behind him, but he’s still looking into Cas’ eyes. When the train starts moving, Dean’s eyes leave his face, and Castiel can breathe again.
“Because I’m a meek and delicate woman,” she answered, slumping down into a chair and lifting her feet onto another. “Whose strength doesn’t hold a candle to your powerful man muscles.” She laid unimpressed eyes on his arms.
“I like this dump,” Castiel protested.
“None of these are interesting places,” Castiel noted.
Mary was reading a paper in the kitchen when Dean walked through the front door.
“I bet her name is Precious,” said Garth, and Meg pointed at him, to stress her point. “Or Darling, or Kitty, and she bakes cookies every Friday and has a goldfish called Mr. Fizzles.”
“It’s pretty rough, huh?” Dean slumped on a chair beside him at the cafeteria. “Landing on your ass.”
He looked at Castiel, and his smile vanished. “Let’s just go home, yeah?”
His expression went blank. “Just going to,” he said, and tried to sound like he hadn’t forgotten he should call them. “Wait,” he said when Dean started to walk away.
“Especially not my dad,” he said. “I wouldn't do anything that might make him talk about his bisexual experiences in the eighties again.”
Dean looked up at him, smiling, and once again said something that was against all reason.
But none of that mattered now.
“Really?” Cas looked him up and down. Dean wasn’t sure whether it made him uncomfortable, or insecure. He fought the urge to look down and remember what he was wearing. Whatever it was, this guy was looking better than him. Though maybe it was the way he carried himself rather than his outfit. “I got my card on the day of my first shift.”
Cas thought about it for a few moments. Then, deliberately, he said, “Uhhh,” as if he were thinking about it for a few moments.
The three of them sat in silence for a few moments. Then Cas said,
Maybe it was the rain. Maybe it was that Dean kept smiling, or that they never did this type of thing. He pulled Dean closer and kissed him and he could feel Dean’s breath when he said,
“And what is me?” Dean threw his arms in the air. Castiel shrugged defensively.
“Or not.” Dean shrugged. There was an edge to his voice. “Whatever.”
He felt a hand on his shoulder.
“Tomorrow might work out better,” said Charlie. “This is going to take a while.”
Bobby didn’t seem as resigned. He was staring at the picture of Dean and the demons, as if it could be holding the answer they were looking for. And then his eyes fixated on something, and he stilled – as if the picture
There was a pause.
This time, it’s his stomach twisting and his heart rate rising and butterflies at the base of his throat. To imagine he used to go through this torture on a daily basis…
Dean wrote back.
He spent the night with Dean squeezed up against him so that he wouldn't fall off onto the floor.
“Really? Alright?”
Saved by the Sam.
“Are you Jewish?” He asked, his lips crooked into a half smile, as if it was amusing to him that the book was
“I’ve noticed.”
At the front of the house was a sign: DO NOT MAKE BABIES HERE.
Did his hands care how uncomfortable Cas would feel knowing just how badly they wanted to touch his face?
And he felt it. He felt it in every bone of his body, in his lungs, in his fingertips, like Cas’ words were infectious. It was too much.
The aliens put them in a line and had them carry big, egg-shaped silver containers. They were light and something splooshed inside when they moved. Castiel didn’t want to know what it was. He carried egg after egg in the line of students, and watched as the aliens changed Dean into what seemed like a huge pillowcase, worn as a dress, and a crown made of rosemary leaves. He kind of looked beautiful in the Greek god kind of way, but that was beside the point.
“You’re not gonna kill the guy.”
“Rusty,” Cas grumbled. “I’ve made good dating choices.”
It was weirdly clean. The floor. He’d expected Dean to be much messier, but maybe it was the big brother in him.
Castiel nodded.
“Dean,” he says back, breathing heavy, and he can’t even hear himself over the beating of his heart. Or maybe no sound comes out of his throat at all; he can’t tell.
“Sorry, I forgot my…”
“Definitely not,” Castiel agreed.
Dean's face went blank, and he sank into a chair.
“I’ve seen you ask out a girl who was giving you her cold medicine,” said Garth.
“What is it?”
“Yet, you don’t see me take off my underwear in order to air it,” said Mr. Man.
“Um,” said Dean. “Sure. Yeah.” He patted Castiel’s shoulder. “I guess I’ll see you around.”
“You said you weren’t going to be mean!” He stretched and snatched the phone from her hands.
“Whoa. Do you have a picture?”
Ew, no. No no no. What the hell is the context of this?”
“Alright, everyone’s here. On the bus, people!” Yelled Mr. Zachariah, the pain in the ass. Dean caught Castiel’s eyes from afar and smiled at his murderous expression.
He glanced at his brother in the dark. “I’m not answering that.” He gripped his blanket. “This is starting to sound like a musical. Good night.” And he pulled the blanket over his head.
“What the hell?” Jo was standing at the threshold, her hand clenched into a fist mid-motion by the open door. Behind her stood Sam, his arms crossed against his chest.  “You’ve taken, like, four minutes to open the door.”
“What did you want, loser?”
To their right, Bobby cleared his throat. “Didn’t you start dating around that age, too?”
Castiel climbed the bed and snatched the paper from his hands. “Not anymore. And I’m this close to taking back my decision to move in with you.”
“Good.” Dean scratched his head, and his eyebrows furrowed. “Kind of weird. You’ll see. But hey, good luck.”
“You look like death,” he said gaily. The man had a weird sense of humor.
“Other people’s feelings,” Castiel corrected.
“I’d taken you for a stuck up royal airhead,” Dean continued.
“We are,” Dean smiled. “But I’ve still gotta be a good boyfriend.”
“Lilith,” he breathed, watching the frozen picture. It was just a normal street – how Dean knew to keep a Big Brother eye on this specific spot, he had no idea. But there she was, that creepy little blond girl, with a bunch of men in black shirts surrounding her, their heads covered with hoods, carrying various weapons under their jackets. Castiel could tell by the unnatural bumps in their coats. One of them held a knife in his hand. Another was facing the camera with his hand on his hip, and something small glimmered on his chest, reflecting light. “That’s her.”
“So what else are you doing today?” She asked.
“Father.”
“Couldn’t she have just stumbled upon this place like we did?” Asked Castiel.
“He’s making you trust him,” Gabriel ignored him. “Believe he’d never do that to you, and then when you’re nice and heart-eyed, he’ll be able to reach into your head and take any information he wants.”
“I don’t get sick,” said Castiel, “So, really, before
“That's her poop face,” said Dean. “She's pooping. Oh, God. Get a diaper.” He knelt down to grab the baby. “Do you think we should handle it?”
“Research,” said Bobby. “Find whatever Dean discovered, and we find Dean.” He looked around the apartment: clothes thrown on the floor with disregard, empty plates on the kitchen counter, dining table overflowing with books and newspaper cutouts. Dean’s laptop sat half-open in a corner of it, and it almost seemed to be trying to shrink in order to make room for everything else.
, I don’t wanna hear it.”
“So, anyway.” Dean cleared his throat. “Your turn.”
“I’m not the only one who can be a workaholic,” Castiel added.
“I’ll pay you back.”

“Yeah?”
“What?”
“You’re delaying dinner. You need to rest. Alright, so...” He looked around the kitchen. “What are we making?”
“The numbers are in sets of six. They’re nonsequential – there’s no way to know where to start unless you were Carver Edlund himself, or… spent years trying to figure it out.”
“Meg sure knows how to throw an awful party.”
“Alright,” he said.
“Hey,” he said nervously.
“I think they’re thinking the same thing,” said Castiel. He shoved one hand into his pocket, the other holding Dean’s, stiff from the cold.
“Save the lecture for another day,” Dean grumbled and threw his bag on the floor. He kicked off his shoes, avoiding his brother’s eyes. “I’ve had a rough one.”
“Only every time I start talking about monster stuff you haven’t seen for yourself, ever since the day I walked into your brother’s kitchen and said ‘shapeshifter’.” Dean nudged a foot at him under the table, and things almost felt normal again.
“It’s ridiculous, but it will work,” Castiel insisted, and bit his tongue, regretting his persuasion attempt immediately. Why was he still trying to help Dean get the treasure at this point? He should be running the other direction.
“Should I wear a tie?” He straightened it and examined his reflection in the mirror.
Naomi’s lips twisted.
Dean looked up then, smiling. “We’re a good match, aren’t we?”
When he went back inside, Sam was sprawled all over the floor. The kid was almost taller than him, and he was sorry now he didn’t give him the bed.
“Dean-“
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” he let out dryly.
. Also your ass. I’m...”
He kicked the clothes thrown on the floor into one pile and then grabbed a couple of knives and a gun and pulled the duffel bag from under the bed to throw them in.
Jack looked at him silently.
“What?”
“Do- Do you spend all your spare time in the kitchens?” Castiel called back. It was meant to sound insulting. It came out stingless. He watched the guy walk away – and then dump the potatoes in the very room from which Castiel had just emerged and come back to face him.
,” insisted Castiel, “But we’re in a hurry, so you need to listen. There was an invasion, and the aliens-”
Castiel was a lightning. At once, he swung his sword and knocked the stumbling man’s gun out of his hand. He threaded his shorter blade into the trigger guard of another man and yanked it into the air.
“Whoa,” said Castiel. “We aren’t quite there yet.”
“Oh. Well, someone has to be here.”
“Kids?” He asked. “I feel... indifferent about them. Except in the dark. I find them unsettling in the dark. Especially after that case we worked last summer...”
“Amazing. So we’re going to need false identities.” He smiled excitedly. “This is going to be awesome.”
Dean looked at him helplessly.
After the assembly the bullying simmered down, while the rumors soared. Everywhere around school he heard things about Cas and him that had never really happened. That they’d been dating for months. That they did it in the supply closet. That they hated one another. That they loved one another.
Cas unfurled his limbs and looked at him. His eyes were silvery blue in the moonlight.
“Ow.”
“Cas, um. Remember that pie you brought me last week?”
Dean looked at him, and smiled his genuine, quiet smile, and said, “Just that I’m lucky to have you.”
who would listen.”
When he left the counselor's office, he almost felt like he should take a shower. When Dean called, it took him a moment to recall why he was calling.
Dean shook it, and said, “I’m going to crush you.”
The librarian stood up at that. “A male, not even blue, and now this?”
“Yes?”
This, to Dean, seemed like an illogical response. (To Cas it seemed that out of the two of them, he was the one being perfectly logical.)
No, that felt more like a huge octopus grabbing him in the leg and slamming his body against the surface repeatedly like a kid flinging a toy around in a tantrum.
“Great! Well, we’re practically done here,” said the man. “Just one more question: would you be willing to… Say, accept pigs as payment? More than three, for sure,” he said at the disconcerted look on Castiel’s face. “At least five.”
The gleaming stopped then. Mr. Man carried on with his class until the bell rang, and then disappeared faster than anyone could form a comment on what happened.
“Fine!” Dean called, and left. Castiel watched him mutter to himself all the way to the supply room.
It wasn’t... It wasn’t a thing. He just needed to be somewhere quiet.
Castiel looked at her blankly.
So this was how it was going to be. People pushing him around. Testing his patience. And him letting them.
Hell, woman, keep it in your pants.”
“Because it was invaded by zombies!” Dean called. Castiel’s lips pulled down, taken aback by Dean’s outburst.
Or had he just not moved far enough away to leave this story behind him?
Dean didn’t find it within himself to argue with that. He knew there was no amount of glowering in her direction that could make Meg show up to work on time or not exhaust him into lifting the heavy boxes. He also knew that she never once turned her back on him when he needed help in the two months of his working at Dick’s, and that she would stand up for him in the face of any customer who so much as looked at him the wrong way.
“I really couldn’t be bothered to organize the shelves right now,” Dean grunted. He could tell Cas was trying to catch his eye, and looked at the register pointedly.
“I’m fine,” said Chuck. “Just hear me out, okay?”
Castiel fumed. It wasn’t a matter of a few stupid toasted snacks now; it was a matter of principle, and of him wanting to punch the guy in the face.
…But he did know what he had for lunch.
“Shut up.” He pointed at her. “I’m fine.”
Castiel examined the men surrounding him, their steady arms aimed forward, their sturdy build. A wave crashed into the ship, making it tip slightly to the left. In the slightest of motions, a foot slid a couple of inches down the deck, compelling its owner to lose balance.
“Oh, no,” said Gabriel. "Oh, no."
“Not really. Either way, I didn’t really want to do this in front of my roommate.”
Thoughts of quitting the life and becoming a normal suburban family came and went along the years and never stuck. And except, Dean used to say, what’s the point in becoming a normal suburban family if there wasn’t any soccer mom involved?
“Or equally weak,” said Meg.
Castiel plopped down on a chair. “Sure.”
Castiel shrugged. “I threw a grappling hook around the chest and pulled myself up.”
That was, until Dean started browsing for ‘Dog and owner reunited’ videos online.
He wanted to make a joke. But he looked at Dean’s face, and something there stopped him on his tracks.
His project was standing proudly in an isolated corner of the hall. People came and went, and he stood next to his creation awkwardly and smiled at stray guests, explaining his thesis when asked. This wasn’t exactly how he’d imagined this moment – for example, he didn’t feel particularly proud, and there weren’t any roses thrown at him or applause in the background – but he was happy with his share, until a voice behind him stopped his excitement short.
He sat back by the computer and read from the article. “’Amelia and Jimmy Novak, 35, were both found dead this week behind the hospital parking lot’-”
,” said Castiel, and Dean elbowed his arm hard.
And there’s something else. That
He was right. It was lame.
Gordon’s fist crashed into his face again. The impact slammed the back of his head against the lockers.
Dean leaned in. “Why should
“Easing?” Asked Castiel. Dean texted back:
“I was just putting some books away,” he said to Henry. He looked over his shoulder; where did they guy come from?
“It is. It is.”
“Does she have a big family?” Asked Garth.
"Emergency contact," said Castiel, as if this solved the issue, although his forehead was creased and he was struggling to wrap his mind around the idea of a guy he'd lived with for months being a hunter.
The thought tore a pit in his stomach.
She left.
“Well.” He pursed his lips. He tapped his fingers on the table. He puffed his cheeks with air and let it out with a funny sound. “Remember when Donna asked if we live together and you said it was too soon?”
“I already turned in my final assignment.”
“FBI,” said Dean.
“My brother invited us for Christmas,” he mentioned, tapping his fingers on the reception desk, just to take this perfectly smooth, careful expression off Dean's face.
“Because I love-“ He cut himself off, sucked in a breath. “As a friend,” he said coolly after a moment, trying to save some face. “I love him as a friend.”
Chuck glanced in his direction before speaking. “No occasion,” he said. “I just thought it would be nice to...” And his words faltered, because this was so clearly way too uncomfortable to be any kind of nice. “All have dinner together.”
“I overstepped,” said Charlie. “I talked to the guys, you know. They're worried about you. I told them you probably just wanted to be alone, but they said, he won't return our calls, he's all alone in there, feeling like he's the only person going through this. He needs someone to remind him there might be another way. So... here. There's another way, Cas, if you want it. All you gotta do is call. I'll be on the other end. We all will.”
Crowley saw his expression, and waved a hand dismissively. “Let’s move on. How good are you with bats?”
“What? I didn’t kill anyone!"
Meg tapped her fingertips on the side of her chair. “Nope.”
Dean turned to look at him, resting his head on his elbow. “Why?”
Damn it. The guy was smarter than he looked.
They crossed the stream step by step, tightened nerves unwinding with each movement.
He could understand the mistrust towards him. But it was a treacherous decision of Dean to trust the disloyal. Castiel wasn’t sure why it bothered him.
Several moments later, he reappeared in the store, pushing a high cardboard box of his own towards another mistletoe one aisle down from where Cas was, wobbling on top of his box and reaching upwards in an effort that seemed, to be honest, quite futile. Dean climbed on top of his box and reached up, squirming to get higher, pretending his effort wasn’t any more futile. He only had a foot to go. Only a foot. If he could just stretch his hand the right way, push his toes against the box, reach up an inch – or, well, a foot – higher...
She shrugged. “We went to high school together.”
“Now.” Dr. Hanscum rested her chin on her fist. “This issue you talk about isn’t necessarily as big as you guys believe it to be. I mean,” She counted on her fingers, starting from the pinkie. “You communicate openly. You’re comfortable with honesty. You even finish each other’s sentences.”
He said: “Fix the mailbox if you hit it with a cantaloupe,” and got into the car.
“You’re coming back?” He was saying, before he could stop himself, and the hope in his voice was forceful. “Where are you?”
“Prom sucks,” said Meg.
Dean grabbed his bottle from the machine and walked back to the bed.
All he remembered was Ms. Mills mouthing meaningless words while he was picturing hamburgers. And Dean beside him. Talking.
Dean yawned. “You don’t have to pretend to like me anymore. Everyone went to sleep.”
>Hold on. I’m googling the lyrics.
It was forcing-eye-contact time. And he did it like a big boy.
Cas’ eyebrows pulled together.
But later, in the car, Dean brought it up again.
“What?”
Bobby stared at the picture wordlessly.
“Hello, son,” he said when Castiel walked in. His hands were shaking.
Dean shrugged, his eyes on the table. “I guess having a family of my own was always something I wanted, kind of low-key, you know? Never thought I'd do it with a guy, though,” He said. “Never thought I'd do it with a guy who eats burgers for breakfast and can drink eight shots like it's nothing, but...”
“Sure you don’t,” Garth said.
“Bristles are itchy,” Dean excused.
She huffed. "Can we get lunch now? Or are you scared he wouldn’t be able to find you if we moved?"
“They don’t teach you about the anus,” he smiled back.
“Then it might just be getting better,” he said. “Last time it was four, now three...” His words died under Dean’s glare.
“About...” He lost his voice. He tried again. “About us.”
names.”
“No weapons,” Dean leaned towards him and whispered.
The rest of the day had a typical holiday feeling. Sweaters and socks, watching the tree, opening presents. Around lunchtime, he spotted Dean pull Bobby and Sam aside for an apology. Then Dean plopped back on the couch and rested his feet in Castiel's lap.
He was acting so odd that Castiel didn’t even think to apologize for disrupting his plans. He handed his father the keys and followed him back to the car.
“I’ll help,” Dean enlisted. He nodded slightly at Castiel, and Castiel nodded back.
“Sorry I upset you.” Dean’s thumb moved in circled over his knuckles. Fucking hell, he should have hugged his parents more.
“Oh my god, that’s right. We went to the same one, by the bagel place.”
“I fixed some things around the house,” said Castiel. “Changed some light bulbs, washed the dishes, did laundry and took the neighbors’ Christmas decorations down-“
Dean stared at him.
Castiel tapped his fingers on the side of his laptop. “I like your place better,” he said.
“But I'm not willing to let go.” He shook his head and dropped his hands to look at Castiel. “I'm not.”
Dean groaned. “It’s like you’re trying to annoy me to death.” Sitting on Castiel's bed, he grabbed a pillow and leaned his elbows on it.
Dean’s lips moved, most likely about to utter some version of “why are you being weird?” But he didn’t say a thing.
“Yeah,” Castiel let out, at a loss.
“Come on,” he said and rose suddenly.
He watched it sink in on Cas’ face. His expression shifted from blank shock to well-disguised dread and back to smooth composure. Sometimes Dean wished he could wipe the neutral colors off this face. Make him feel something too strong to be tucked away behind careful composure.
Cas hesitated, and Dean jumped in. It was weird how you could feel like a team when you were playing a fake couple and there was incredible pressure on you to not expose your deception.
So Dean quizzed him, sitting sideways on his chair, facing Castiel with his book tilted so that its contents were hidden. And it wasn’t long before Castiel raised a point he didn’t have the answer to and he turned to his phone and googled it.
The way he said it was warm. Castiel couldn’t quite relate. His family wasn’t the loving and caring kind. They were the kind that gave up on each other.
Dean laughed and elbowed his side lightly. “Hey,” he said. “Thanks, man.”
“What do you think this means?” Meg asked, and stood before Van Gogh’s The Starry Night. The actual Starry Night from 1889. Castiel could see the brushstrokes.
“Alright,” he said warily.
Castiel looked away. He didn’t even know what to say to that. Someone slumped on the chair beside Castiel’s, and they both startled.
“I don’t... know?” He offered.
Cas let out an abrupt huff, almost a snort, watching Dean’s face for a sign of sarcasm.
“Right. Um. Look.” Dean made a clearly forced effort to make eye contact. “Here goes.” He took a breath. “The school found out I lied about my past. They’re in the process of making a decision, but it’ll probably end in kicking me out.”
“What?” She looked at him, and rolled her eyes at his nervous expression. “I promise I won’t be mean to people who aren’t trying to get you into bed.” She looked at the phone. “Who’s Sam?”
He clenched his teeth.
“Check this out,” Dean pointed at a hologram of a lady in white appear and disappear in the middle of the crowd. “That’s just creepy, man.”
He was overthinking.
“When was the last time you were here?” Dean asked, looking around as they crossed the lobby. That look in his eyes – the same look he had when they’d entered the SPN High library for the first time – that wide-eyed slight-gape would make stars look pale in comparison.
Dean couldn’t argue with that.
“We’re not burning him,” said Sam quietly as he passed by her with a shovel.
He held Cas’ eyes for as long as he could. Then he looked away.
“No,” Castiel whispered.
“Ma.”
No. Focusing on his exam.
“This isn’t going great,” he whispered when they were out.
“Rackets and footballs,” Cas concluded.
"S'up," Castiel tried to imitate him, dipping his head forward a little bit.
“Sixteen year old Sam,” Castiel said, his lips pressing together. Charlie never mentioned the dude had nerves of steel when it came to keeping a poker face. “Lives here, down the hallway.”
It was the worst kind of moment, to be reminded of all the bad things that had gone wrong between the two of them that they’d spent months and years trying to forget.
They stared back for a moment. Then Charlie said,
Followed by another text: O
“Apart from your face? Nothing.”
“As long as you try!” Dean intervened. “Trying is what matters.”
In the dark, they crossed the hall running, a squad of soldiers on their trail. With one set of pajamas, a pair of boxers and two blades, they made their escape.
