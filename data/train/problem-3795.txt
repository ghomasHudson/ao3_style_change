Deans quiet for a bit before responding to Cas.
Truth be told, Castiel is confused with this case. Nothing seems to be adding up. Yes, they know it is a werewolf pack for sure now after speaking with the families of the victims. After much thought on the matter, Castiel finally realizes one single commonality with all the victims and its a far fetched one at that. The victims all went missing around the same geographical area. Just outside a nation state park and also close an abandoned cabin in the woods. That’s not creepy at all.
Oh yes, you will Angel, Dean's subconscious smirks.
Dean feels a faint sting. A feeling shoots through his arm where Cas touches him. A electricity. And then it's gone as soon as he lifts his hand. Almost like Dean had just imagined it. Dean looks at Cas' hand for a split second before eyeing him.
“Something better, but sure you can have bacon.”
Cas sent him a confused glare before turning back to his niece. “Claire, what are your plans?”
“Come on, let’s settle in. You guys are in the barn house.” Mary led them off with Castiel, Dean and John carrying luggage. “You guys can settle in until dinner. Mom’s serving meatloaf.”
“Yes, you are. Unless you think you can change my mother’s mind? No, didn’t think so.”
“Uh, well… I only meant-”
“It made you sad, as well mom.”
“Yep. Fun. ‘Ollylop.”
“Well it could be, and I for one will not be one of those people.”
“Is this where you tell me we never should have come?” Dean asked into the darkness.
“Sure, Sammy, hell it’s Christmas you can have a whole sentence,” he joked, feeling festive as the whiskey circulated through his body.
“Where’s Claire? Something about friends you said? I didn’t know she had any friends?” Dean changed the subject quickly, picking Jack up and carrying him inside. Castiel left the trike in the garage and followed them through the adjourning door and into the kitchen.
“Sure, baby. Other than this dreadful holiday.”
Claire grinned. “I thought so.”
Inside it felt a bit more like Christmas. The tree was the same, the tinsel, candles, baubles, lights and music all the same as last night but Sam’s arrival made all the difference. The smell of bacon helped, and Dean eagerly sat down with his extended family for his dad’s famous Christmas morning breakfast complete with eggnog.
“Dean, you hate your grandparents.”
“Hell no, she’s sixteen. But that’s why we have the tracker app on her phone. I just think it’s a bit extreme to use that when a text will do.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Dean asked angrily, standing up. Cas put a gentling hand on his partner’s arm but sent Samuel a foul look of his own.
“Mom, is everything okay?”
“It’s mom.”
You are cordially invited to a Campbell Christmas Gathering from the 24th-26th December.
“I know. I know! Shit, if I could get out of it I would but it’ll upset mom.”
“Yay! I’m your Grandma and I love you so much. This is Grandpa, you say Grandpa?”
“Are you okay?” Castiel asked the one question his grandparents never cared to hear the answer to.
Dean laughed, as he was meant to, and kissed his husband’s stubbled jaw. “Happy Kissmuss, Cas.”
“I’m so happy for you, baby!” Mary hugged Sam, emotion swimming in her eyes. “How far along is she?”
“We’ll lock the doors and put the baby monitor on. C’mon, Cas, when do we get a change to fuck in daylight?”
He took a deep breath. “I am now. How about you?”
“We can’t leave the dog!” Dean announced without context.
“Dea-”
“How exciting, Sam! And Mary, your first grandchild!” Deanna gushed.
“Be good,” Dean said, pretending to punch Claire in the shoulder as they said their goodbyes.
“Saw the letter,” Dean said in return.
“It means they get to insult me while you excuse them and dad take his aggression out on the car. They’ve never even met Jack and I’d rather not expose him to their hostility.”
“Mom-”
“This is the first Christmas in eight years that you’ve been away for,” Dean attempted to vocalised his feelings, something Castiel had encouraged him to do when they decided to adopt Claire.
“Family.” Samuel finished.
“At least tell me you are getting married before the baby arrives!” Samuel called after him.
“My baby would be loved even if she or he was deaf, blind, gay or transgender. My love is not conditional. But no, my deafness is because of an accident that happened when I was born and not a birth defect. Asshole,” Eileen reamed Samuel out in a way that Dean truly admired, but he could see the tears in her eyes as she flew past him and out of the lounge.
Eileen thwacked him in the abs. “I’m pregnant,” she said, signing along with her words. “We are having a baby.”
“Well, technically I only hate Samuel, but yes, I know.”
“Poppa gave you a lollypop?” Dean asked, eyebrows raised high as the man himself leaned in for a kiss.
“We have something to share with you. Eileen and I…. we’re pregnant,” Sam announced.
“Nothing, just love isn’t the same as family, is it,” Deanna said, trying to soothe the friction.
“Morning, honey!” She chirped. Normally it was Dean and Mary who were morning people, up at six to brew the coffee and enjoy the sunrise before starting on their day before Sam rolled out of bed and his dad grudgingly joined them. Except these days Dean worked two jobs, part time at Bobby’s Scarp-yard and Garage, and full time at the bar ‘Rocky’s’ that he co-owned with his good friend Pamela Barns who brought in as many customers as she chased off. Owning a bar meant late nights, and last night had been even later than normal. He wasn’t the only one who had changed though, last time Sam stayed with him, Dean had woken up at eight am to find Sam returning from a morning run with coffee and baked goods in tow. Rehab had taught him healthy body and healthy mind were interlinked, and Sam was determined to stay on the straight and narrow.
“Oh shucks, I was only aiming for ten months younger.”
“Because we never argued. Dean, we were always on the same side, our side.”
“Claire is well.”
“So we can fight now. Then we can have make up sex,” Dean suggested.
“I text your mom this morning, she said John’s doing a big breakfast for everyone at ten just after Sam arrives.
“Bacon?” Dean guessed slyly.
“Don’t start-” John did raise his voice, but Dean didn’t stick around to find out if he was going to defend his eldest son or argue just to spite the old man.
“So you’re saying that Kaia is her foster sister? Claire is dating her foster sister?” Samuel asked incredulously, with derision dripping from his tongue. Dean sent him a hard look.
“No hostility, Dean, they are just… they’re just grandparents. Old and set in their ways. My grandparents were like that too, you just have to forgive them their small mindedness and enjoy the time you have left with them.”
That night Dean and Castiel settled into the converted barn house apartment a good two hundred feet away from the large farmhouse his grandparents lived in. Most of the year round this was where his cousins bunked down for early morning shifts on the farm, however they spent Christmas in their own homes with their wives and children. However, as such, the barn house was little more than a kitchenette with microwave, coffee machine and fridge, a shower cubicle, a toilet and three small bedrooms with single beds that were cheaply made and resembled cots more than actual beds. After this ‘holiday’ Dean was sure Castiel would have a bad back again. He assumed they had been given these rooms in order to prevent them from sleeping together, however Dean hadn’t slept without Castiel in nearly ten years and wasn’t about to let a narrow bed and an even more narrow minded man stop them from being close.
“Good,” Dean said, and hugged her back close. “Because I’m not ready to lose you.”
He picked up his cell, on charge by the toaster, and clicked over his mom’s number.
And. Fucking. Guests.
“I’m pretty sure getting on a faulty plane would be safer than letting Castiel drive us,” Claire said drolly.
“Even if we do, I’ll still be here with you.”
“Jack, little man. You have fun?!”
Samuel looked attacked, he genuinely didn’t understand why everyone was getting at him. “What? I’m just asking.”
“Alright you two, let’s go inside and see our actual Grandma before she puts us on the naughty list and we get coal.”
“Dean,” Cas growled in his gravelly ‘I’m serious now’ tone, “It’s five am, and in two hours I have to get up and shower so we are going to sleep, and you are going to call your mother tomorrow. We can argue after dinner.”
“You aren’t going near it, though right? Only Grandma is cooking?” Dean checked.
Sam looked torn as he watched her leave. “I’ll go,” Dean said, he knew more than anyone how much Samuel’s comments could burn.
Dean shakes his head again and breathes.
How dare Dean and his friggin human brain, which gets plenty more sleep than he does, insult him. Cas is definitely NOT scared of the dark. That isn’t a problem.
And he breathes.
Cas locks eyes with Dean for a few moments. He hopes Dean can read his expression. How uneasy he feels.
Something clicks in Dean. A sudden realization. A memory almost. Dean has the Mark of Cain. A Mark that turned him into a killer. This isn't the real Dean. This is the Mark acting out. Making him a killer. Making him murder people. And the silhouette isn't a shadow at all. It's Cas. Castiel is standing in front of him. The one who saved him from his torturing in hell. His best friend. His lover. Trench coat and all. He blue striped tie laying loosely against his chest. It’s Cas.
“He’s okay I think. I don’t know he didn’t say much to me about it, he was very vague.” Dean admitted, popping a piece of bacon in his mouth.
"What are you thinking about?" Dean asks, eyes trained to the road, hands on the steering wheel.
Oh Cas no, Dean begs silently to himself. Please, please, please...don’t be stupid.
“Werewolves don’t even match up with the deaths. Sam, they were
"No." Cas demands. "I can't. Because I'm your friend."
Dean always waking up before Cas and making him breakfast, them drinking coffee together in the morning. Then the day passes. They sometimes shower together and put on their nightclothes but always brushing their teeth together and making funny faces at each other in the mirror until one of them laughs so hard, spewing toothpaste everywhere. And always falling asleep in each other's arms, never letting go.
No, Dean thinks to himself. Please don't you touch him. Don't you lay a damn finger on his pretty little head. Don’t you touch my angel.
Oh shit.
"I would like that yes Dean." Cas admits, getting cozier and deeper into his covers, blankets all the way up to his chin. Dean slides off the bed onto the desk chair to give him room, folding his arms onto the bed and tucking his fists under his chin.
And then it starts.
“Yeah, me either.” Dean grumbles and tosses the sack into a nearby trashcan.
Something is wrong.
"Oh, you think you have a choice," Dean smirks evilly at him.
Cas finally looks up from his bundle of books, looking even more confused.
“A little under 18 hours.” Dean groans, “You can bring a blanket and a pillow for the road if you want to rest. Maybe a few books too. It’s gonna be a long day. I want to get a little more than halfway before stopping for the night.” Dean zips up the bag and grabs the small zip-up toiletries bag that they share and places that in Cas’s lap.
“Dean. Seriously get over yourself. This is exactly what got you into this position in the first place. You’re so impulsive, thinking that you can handle situations when you really can’t. God, it’s infuriating.” Cas huffs out and crosses his arms on his chest, quite dramatically. “Please let us help you.”
A pack of werewolves is the last thing Dean wanted to hunt after their tricky vampire hunt just three days ago. He absolutely despises werewolves.
"Yes, you got any tips to share with me? I mean you were the expert in this area."
Cas looks up at Dean dropping his hands to his chest.
. I am just trying to help. Please don't bite my head off for caring." Dean speaks softly as he turns onto the busy street. Dean reaches over and taps Cas's knee affectionately. Cas needs to know that Dean and Sam are just here to help. And deep down, Cas does know that. But he can't help but think that he's causing more trouble than he is worth.
Three.
They sit in silence, listening to the cars drive past them on the busy street, watching the birds fly south for the winder, smell the fresh after rain smell.
Dean waits, blade ready. Eyes connected with Cas'. And memories flood through him at that moment. Cas the one that plunged deep into hell to save Dean Winchester. Rebuilt his whole body. Brought him back to life. Became his best friend. His lover. And he's about to kill him. Dean looks still, thinking, contemplating.
“Sure is sweetheart.” Dean smiles at him as Cas sits up against the headboard and takes the cup from his hands. He sighs a hum of contentment as he takes the first sip, the hot liquid sliding down his throat.
They both undress and change into their pajamas before making their way into the bathroom to brush their teeth together, just like every night.
It’s no doubt that Cas is still protective of Jimmy Novak's daughter after everything she’s been through. He blames himself mostly for everything he’s caused. But Sam bringing that up as bait just to get him on board with this case is a low blow.
What up, what up what up! I'm back from the dead, it has been too long since I've updated and I take full responsibility for that. After a while of soul-searching and help from my wonderful mother, I have decided to quit my job and focus completely on my school work, well, not totally completely. I have decided to dive into this story again and not only for my own joy but yours as well. I miss all the sweet comments I get from you guys. :( Anyways, this chapter kinda took a different turn than what I expected to write and something that's not even on my outline sheet sooooo I dunno how to feel about that and I contemplated posting this at all but you guys deserve it so why not leave me a comment let me know what you think about this chapter and y'all enjoy. :)
“Well, honestly, I’m not so sure, but it’s the closest guess I have,” Sam says with a shrug.
Cas huffs a frustrated breath and tears his eyes from Dean, sitting back in his chair in defeat.
“I mean, how’s your bed, Cas? Are you comfortable? Do you need more pillows? A night light?”
It's all so tedious and time sensitive. But being here, with Dean and Sam. It makes all this suffering and searching for his true purpose worth it. Dean is worth it. Dean is the reason he decided to carve out his grace and tie a balloon to it, his grace soaring thousands of feet in the air like he once would himself, never to be seen again.
No please, I don't want to hurt him. Dean begs to his subconscious.
"You're wrong."
A flashback chapter :) some Destiel fluff before they became a "couple".
Dean nods slightly and takes a swig of his beer, emptying it. He reaches across the bed and sets in on the bedside table. There is a framed picture of Dean, Cas and Sam on his nightstand, Dean studies it for a moment, expression unreadable.
He loves this.
to pieces. The Bedford Sheriff said they barely were able to identify the bodies. The werewolves we hunt are usually linked up with missing hearts, not their whole body shredded beyond recognition. Does that sound like any normal werewolf to you?” Cas states.
?” He closes the book in front of him roughly, hands rubbing at his temples.
I’m so sorry Cas, Dean thinks to himself.
Dean throws Cas on to the ground. Cas groaning as he hits the floor. Cas doesn't even move. Acting like a rag doll. He’s too still and if it weren’t for his whimpers Dean might have thought he was dead right then. Dean rolls him over. Cas' lip is busted. His nose is bleeding from both nostrils. There's blood pooling out of his mouth and multiple deep cuts across his skin. Cas chokes on the blood as Dean pulls the angel blade out of Cas' sleeve. Twirling it effortlessly in his palm.
"Oh, you are awake. Thought maybe you were already gone and dreaming on me." Dean laughs softly and shuts the door behind him.
“I don’t know.” Cas whimpers sadly, screwing his eyes shut and shaking his head. Dean's fingers paused, taken aback by the sudden emotions in front of him.
Dean throws a rough jab of the knee into Cas' stomach. Cas grunts and doubles over in pain as Dean throws his body towards the pile of books in the middle of the room, his body skidding across the wooden flooring.
Cas hums softly and slowly bats his eyes open looking around before landing on Dean with a smile.
“I’ll get the weapon bag ready for you this time Dean. You do it every time.”
“Alright, thank you again officer. Call me if you find anything.” Sam hangs up the phone behind Cas and makes his way to the table next to him. He pops open a beer as he sits down with a huff. Cas looks at him unenthusiastically, he’s really not interested in this hunt at all. “That was the police station. They said they will have to search through all their cold case files to see if they have any information on the case for us. Apparently they just stopped looking for the teenagers a few weeks ago. Kinda odd but whatever.”
The vibration of an incoming text cut the tension in the air. Dean glanced down and saw a reply from Claire;
“Good advice,” Sam said pointedly, but it went over John’s head like normal. “I’m going to find my fiancee now.”
“Funny.”
“I know. I just mean… I expected dad to disown me, you know, and when he didn’t I felt like I had to do everything I could to make them love me, including putting up with Samuel.”
Dean woke Christmas morning to the smell of coffee and an urge to hide under the bed like a scared five year old. Instead he checked his phone, messaged Claire a ‘Merry Christmas’ and got up to find his son. Jack was awake in the travel cot and from the amount of toys in with him it was obvious that Castiel had been up with Jack for a while.
“That bad?” Castiel guessed.
Dean ached at that. He couldn’t stand Castiel in pain, yet it baffled him when Cas felt the same way. The concept of someone loving him the exact same way he loved them was a lot for Dean to handle and even ten years down the line could shock Dean. So he deflected.
Dean breathed deep.
Dean peeked in the mirror to check on their son and shook his head. “No, Jodie’s done enough mothering for us. She deserves a break, not that she’ll get one with three teenage girls but at least it isn’t changing nappies and waking up in the middle of the night.”
“No?” Dean looked at Cas. “No?”
“Although we have to go to the main house for that.”
“You mean Kaia’s foster mom?” His dad butted in unhelpfully, raised eye brow and his own glass of amber liquor in his hands. Claire kept in touch with Mary and John far more than Dean did with either sets of grandparents. Her mom’s mom was in a home with dementia and called Claire ‘Amelia’ the few times they had been to see her, but it upset Claire too much to visit so they hadn’t been for over a year, and her mom’s dad was long dead. Castiel and James’ parents were alive, but they had disowned Cas a long time ago and written Claire off as a lost cause when the courts awarded Dean and Cas custody over them, mostly due to her ailing health and his alcohol addiction that didn’t stop him from going to church every Sunday.
“I do. Maybe it’s not what I imagined for him, and it’s not the easy choice but I love my son and watching Castiel stand by Dean for better and worse for ten years has shown me that the gender of your partner is immaterial, it’s the soul that’s important. Hell, look at Sam’s previous relationships!”
“Samuel!”
“What about her?” Dean asked, searching for a specific bottle of red that tasted like cherries and made him wince the one time he’d taken a sip.
“She isn’t home yet? I’ll call her.”
At about one pm he received a snapchat from Claire and Kaia wishing them a happy Christmas, with a blushing Claire and an adoring Kaia. It was the cutest thing Dean had ever seen. He immediately text Claire back to remind her to use the dental dams. She didn’t reply.
The journey was uneventful, and Dean stopped for gas and lunch at 2:30pm somewhere that had a park for Jack to run around in. When it came time for Castiel to drive them Dean suggested that Cas sit with Jack and try to keep him awake while Claire and Dean sat up front so he could talk to her about her upcoming driver’s ed. Castiel saw nothing of this and did so, with both Claire and Dean breathing a sigh of relief. They arrived at Jodie’s by six pm, with hugs and dinner waiting for them. Jack of course was asleep by this point, Cas had only had mild success with his mission, so they put him up in the travel cot Jodie had set up in Patience’s room since she was visiting her dad.
“It’s probably for the best,” Castiel agreed, and pressed a dry kiss to his husband’s lips. Dean raised his left hand to cup the back of Castiel’s neck and deepened the kiss with his tongue. A loud groan echoed in the car. “You know what Claire being gone does mean?” Cas said breathlessly when he finally broke the kiss.
“Ever.” Dean smiled big and wide. Claire glared and muttered something unintelligible under her breath before ducking into the car next to her brother.
“So,” Samuel sniffed. “Castiel, how is your niece Claire?” Dean’s jaw ticked and he took a large swallow of liquor to stop the anger form exploding from his mouth. His grandfather always did that, talked about Claire only as Castiel’s relation even though Cas and Dean had adopted her six years ago, with Claire’s own blessing, and raised her for eight years. Sure, she didn’t call them dad, but she knew they were her family.
“Promise me next year we’ll go to Sammy’s to see the baby and we’ll stick to just people who love us unconditionally.”
“What, I just want you to be safe.”
“Hey, hundreds of people did in plane crashes every year.”
Cas collapsed back down on the bed, his nose shoved into the crook of Dean’s neck and his arm pulling Dean close against his body. Snoring filled the room seconds later and Dean rolled his eyes. Yeah, he was totally going to be able to sleep through that.
“You are disgusting. I’m not going to get herpes!”
Dean smiled. “Yeah, I do.”
“I love you forever,” Dean agreed, and allowed his husband to prove his point thoroughly.
“Yes, I’m sure,” Cas said dryly, his expression carefully blank to prevent Jack from picking up on his barely bottled rage. “Perhaps you shouldn’t say anything else, unless you want to upset everyone this Christmas.”
After he had finished, now bone tired and feeling soulless, he started on his usual 3am checks, albeit much later than normal. Doors locked, windows shut, keys to his baby hidden from plane sight, freezer door properly shut, cooker definitely turned off at the mains, and then he crept upstairs for his favourite part of his pre-sleep ritual. First door on the right was the family bathroom, and he did a quick brush of his teeth before carrying on down the hallway. He opened a bedroom door with ‘Keep Out - This Means You’ poster on it and peeked inside to find Claire, his adoptive daughter, cuddled up with an ancient teddy that Castiel had gotten her one year, a smudge of eyeliner still on and a floor covered in aggressively black clothing, just as it should be. He closed the door behind him, allowing her the belief that she was too old to be looked over by her parents any more. The door opposite was already ajar, and Dean slipped inside to stared at a tiny boy in flannel sleeping peacefully the way only small children who felt safe and loved could. Jack was only two and Dean hoped he never grew up despite the fact that was an impossible prayer. Once Dean was satisfied that Jack was fine, he went to his own bedroom at the end of the hallway. He crawled into bed and immediately his partner of ten years turned over and wrapped himself around Dean.
Dean sent a quick ‘where the hell are you, you better not be smoking’ text to Claire before leaning against the counter and scrubbing a hand over his face. “She mommed me good and proper.”
Sam grinned sheepishly as everyone laughed. “Yeah, you are doing all the hard work,” he agreed.
“So closer to an hour and a half,” Castiel surmised.
“Hey, man, can I have a word?”
Christmas night and almost everyone of them went to bed angry or bitter, perhaps apart from those too drunk to do anything other than pass out, and of course Jack who was too young to really understand the words and tension flying around the room.
“Thanks, Cas,” Sam said, and Cas picked up Jack and his toys and left the room.
They hugged it out with Jodie, Alex and Kaia before getting on the road again, Dean safely in the driver seat as Castiel’s hand stayed calm and steady on his thigh.
Mother fucking… and guests?
“We’ll get take out,” Dean compromised.
“Want to have that make up sex now?”
“That’s enough,” Samuel barked. “You don’t talk to my wife that way, especially when you aren’t-”
“Oh yeah, at least one year.”
“Thanks. Think it makes me look younger?”
“And you’d be okay with that? Her poisoning her body?”
“Sammy, glad you could make it!” Dean embraced his brother with a chest smacking hug before kissing Eilene on the cheek and signing hello to her.
“More than you,” she said with a smile. Dean pulled her into a hug and then pushed her away. “See you in a week.”
“You want to talk about Christmas instead?” Dean suggested with a bright sarcastic smile.
Mary laughed. “John, do you remember when Dean used to call your dad pumpa?”
“Happy Kissmuss, Dean.”
“Well, to be fair Jodie fostered Claire while we sorted out legalities, so I guess Jodie is her foster mom too,” Dean defended their decision.
“Ditto,” she copied him, but less with the pretending.
“No, because you’ll use a dental dam. Or just don’t have sex.”
Castiel squeezed his thigh. “But I heard it anyway.”
Samuel and Deanna Campbell
“We never did have that make-up sex,” Dean reminded Cas as he undid his husband’s pants.
After Christmas dinner had been served and eaten, everyone still around the table with wine and beer in their hands and a fruit juice for Jack, Sammy and Eileen shared an obvious look and then Sam stood up, gaining everyone’s attention.
“Twenty weeks, but we are waiting to find out the gender.”
“No, but you could get herpes.”
“We’ll celebrate New Year’s Day like that,” Dean promised.
“Dragons? Really?” Claire rolled her eyes.
“No,” Claire said, and took another bite of her burger.
“She’s sixteen, not eighteen, and like you said she doesn’t have any friends that live round here so who is she meeting. I’m concerned.”
“I am a perfectly safe driver,” Cas said stiffly.
“They are my family,” Mary insisted. “By choice, if not legality and blood. And that’s more important, dad. Stop being so close minded before Dean chooses not to be your family any more, because I’m done playing mediator.” Mary said, shocking everyone.
A grin spread across Dean’s face.
“Aren’t what? Welcome? That much is obvious.”
“Daddy!” Jack exclaimed, jumping off and barrelling into Dean.
“Seriously? Mom, Grandpa will outlive the devil out of pure stubbornness.”
“Uh huh,” Cas said sleepily.
“We trust her?”
“And I love you. They are my parents and it would mean the world to me if you and Castiel were here with us for Christmas.”
“Don’t be ridiculous Dean, you know dad can’t cook.”
Cas rose up with a sudden alertness, glaring suspiciously down at his partner. He sniffed the air noisily and winced. “You’re drunk.”
“Damn, I forgot that this place didn’t have a stove.”
“I’m pretty sure that’s not true, Dean,” Sam corrected him wryly.
“No? I’m the eldest son, pretty sure it’s part of the gig.”
“Best husband ever!”
Castiel paused as if thinking it over. “Get the monitor, I’ll lock the doors.”
“Gramma!” Jack said as he slobbered around his hand.
“Ten twenty, not sure I can socialise with those people before I can smell bacon in the air,” Dean said with a grin. Cas kissed him and took Jack out of Dean’s hands and went back to Jack’s bedroom, allowing Dean some time to compose himself.
“No, it isn’t,” Samuel interrupted. “They aren’t blood. They aren’t family by marriage in most states.”
“You don’t have a dog,” his mom countered quickly.
“What? I was just asking,” Samuel insisted as his wife sent him a foul look.
“Home.” Dean said softly into the silence. Castiel was half asleep next to him and Jack was sniffling his way through a cold clogged nose as he dreamed.
Dean was tucked up with Castiel, his mind chaos. He hadn’t drank enough to pass out and wasn’t sober enough to muddle through the day. He knew his husband was long away from sleep as well from the tension in his body and the uneven breaths that brushed against Dean’s hair.
“I can’t believe you would say that, Dad!”
“No, no, Dean. I’m fine. The cancer hasn’t come back. I genuinely wanted a change. I’m fifty six years old, Dean, and my hair is gray under all this blonde dye. I want to grow old gracefully, and I’m okay with that. I’m not ill, promise.”
This was what Christmas should be, Dean thought, as he sat next to Castiel inhaling turkey, mac n cheese, gravy, and potatoes while he pushed anything green or orange to the side. Jodie, Alex, Claire, Kaia… they all laughed openly, loved just the same and fought as well. Nothing was hidden for the sake of family, as if blood was more important than love and acceptance. Dean had grown up under his dad’s imposing thumb, believing there was something wrong with him because he wanted to sleep with men just as much as women. Nothing explicit was ever said, but when John caught Dean flirting with a bag packing boy at the Piggy Wiggly his dad started asking more and more about girls and how Dean should find himself a ‘nice girlfriend’ to keep his wondering eyes busy. When Dean had fallen in love with Castiel and finally come out to his parents they’d both been shocked. Dean had felt a little betrayed; it wasn’t like on television where the mom said ‘I know, I’ve always known’ and hugged him, she looked genuinely surprised as if it had never crossed her mind. John had obviously decided that if he discouraged Dean enough then he’d tow the heterosexual line, and it worked for a while with Dean too scared of his dad’s disapproval to even smile at a guy, but when he’d moved out and met Castiel… some things were more important than fear and Cas was one of them. Besides, John and Mary had mostly accepted Castiel even if sometimes he sensed some discomfort. It was one of the reasons Dean kept his distance and rarely traversed the four hours between their towns to visit his parents, and usually only when Sammy was home.
“You can’t keep putting her over yourself. It’s not your responsibility to ensure your mom is happy.”
“Don’t, Cas.”
“I will be when Claire gets home. I just want all of our family under one roof.”
“She said she would join us for lunch.”
“Dean, I think she’s ill again.”
“Maybe, maybe not,” she said, softly as if she wasn’t talking to him. Then, louder; “Dean! C’mon, it won’t be that bad. It’s the first time in years we’ll be having Christmas with them, and I know they are old fashioned but they love you. Look, come this year and next year I promise me and your dad will do something small for just us. I’ll even throw in your favourite pie!”
“Ugh, cold,” Castiel muttered.
“Hell yes!” John said, having been uncharacteristically silent during the holiday.
By afternoon everyone was feeling cheery from the effect of alcohol. Jack was running around from relative to relative showing everyone the toys he got and enjoying tickles. He asked for a puppy from Santa and wanted every single adult to explain why Santa hadn’t gotten him a puppy, with Castiel and Dean exchanging knowing looks behind their son’s back. They’d talked about it extensively and were adopting a puppy in the New Year because dogs were not presents they were an extension of the family. Jack didn’t know about it, but Claire had helped choose the puppy and named him Miracle.
“Technically.”
Dean stopped what he was doing and turned to look at his brother’s furrowed brow. “Why? Did she say something to you?”
“Let’s get this day started. I’m taking a shower, you want to join and wake me up like you planned to?” Dean said with a lascivious once over of Cas stood in the kitchen bare footed in a navy blue dressing gown and blue and white pinstriped pyjamas that had been gifted to him by his mom last year despite the fact Cas slept naked as the day he was born.
“It’s not, Dean. Neither was it your job to look after Sammy growing up while your dad lost his mind over your mom’s health. You grew up too fast, and that burden weighs on you even now.”
“Mom, I’m sorry I just don’t want to go.”
“I packed some dental dams!” Dean yelled as he made his way to the car to dump the rest of the bags. Jack was already in his booster seat with his iPad playing Paw Patrol and Castiel was just double checking the house for anything they had left behind, like their sanity and ideals.
“Yeah. Maybe. We won’t come back next year,” Dean said, but it sounded like he was begging rather than promising.
The next morning was for goodbyes. Dean avoided Samuel by being busy with every other family member whenever Samuel was free. Sam gave him a dutiful hand shake but said very little and Eileen refused to look in his direction which made it impossible for him to even attempt to communicate with her. Eileen did give Dean a long, hard hug and promised to look after herself and the baby who was going to be Dean’s nephew, although don’t tell Sam because he wanted a surprise. Dean promised and kissed her on the cheek before moving on to his mom.
“Only way I could calm down after opening that god-damned-”
“Jack is-”
“Claire’ll be here in an hour.”
“Yeah, he probably puts them in the stew,” Dean grumbled.
“You’ll do no such thing!” Samuel said without raising his voice. “If the boy wants to act-”
“I promise.”
“Uh huh. You mean Jodie, Alex and Kaia your girlfriend? Is that where you were hoping to go?” Dean asked, eyebrows raised.
“Claire’s staying with Jodie.”
“Dad!”
“Well you can’t stay alone for Christmas. I’ve seen that movie and no way is that happening on my watch!” Dean said.
“We took a flight,” Eileen said. “And didn’t die. It’s a miracle Dean,” she joked.
“Oh yeah? Which one of us is going to cook?” He asked pointedly.
Dean swept the items off the table top in a fit of rage, bottles smashing and papers flying around him. Fucking guests? Fuck them and their ‘and guests’. Dean chugged the rest of the bottle and stuck his headphones on blasting out Led Zeppelin’s finest tunes as he struggled to calm down. He switched his iPod off after When the Levee Breaks finished and started the clean up process. He wasn’t a young man any more who could let himself be controlled by his anger, he had a home, a family and responsibilities and that included not leaving broken glass and shredded paper all over the kitchen floor.
“Good drive?” Castiel signed and spoke out loud. Castiel had once taught bible studies to deaf children and was proficient at ASL whereas Dean only knew a few phrases. Eileen had been dating Sam for nearly two years, but they mostly communicated via text and video call due to the 25 hour drive between their homes.
Cas and Dean shared a look. “I’ll call Jodie, see how she feels about it.”
John shrugged. “Admit your mistakes and grow from them, son.”
“Congratulations, man!” Dean embraced him, and then Eileen.
“You’re a better cook than Mary,” Castiel assured him dryly. “She once burned canned custard.”
“All grown up now, huh?”
“Please, like I’m letting you get on a plane. Those things are death traps. The only thing that should fly are birds and dragons.”
“Well, I like to think of it as me disowning them. Besides, I still had Jimmy, and unfortunately Gabriel.”
“So, snuggles?” Dean asked with a charming grin.
Dean didn’t say anything and instead lent forward to play the CD that Jodie had brought him, all the way to Kansas.
Sammy shook his head. “It’s just… the way she was talking about this Christmas, as if it was so important that we all get together, and her hair, man she’s never had short hair except when she’s about to have chemo.”
“I didn’t say that,” Dean protested.
“I’ll miss you too,” Claire reassured him.
“No, I mean with your health. Sam… he thinks because of your hair…”
“Yeah. I know.”
Ten twenty came and Dean met Castiel on the porch of his grandparents house. Just as they bumped shoulders the sound of a car pulling up made Dean turn around to watch his brother and Sam’s fiancee arrive.
They left most of the stuff in the car, secure in the garage, putting Jack into bed and setting up the baby monitor. Cas dialled up the heating and Dean checked the locks before falling into his husband’s embrace.
Dean leaned down and Jack jumped up into his arms. “Happy Christmas, Jack.” He hugged his son close and took a deep breath of Jack’s head, a smell that was 10% shampoo, 30% sweat and 60% unique to Jack. It eased the tension in his chest. Dean remembered a time when he hadn’t been able to hold Jack like this and feel complete, when he had thought adopting Jack was a mistake and would ruin his relationship with Castiel. Cas, however, had loved Jack from the womb, staying close to his birth mother almost to the exclusion of Dean. Dean had fallen in love with Jack, not as suddenly and organically as Cas, but he did love his son and never wanted him to know the way Dean had felt at the beginning. Whispering promises to always protect Jack and love him forever, he went to go join his husband.
“I love you,” she said, and then accepted a hug from Cas. Dean pretended he couldn’t overhear her making him promise to look after Dean while he was at his grandparents house. He liked to think she didn’t know about the stuff that had been said when she had been first adopted by Dean and Castiel following the death of her parents, but she was a clever kid and he hadn’t always been able to protect her. They were all determined to do better for Jack.
“Mary, Dean really would be better off getting some fresh air. I’m sure he’ll join us later,” Castiel, his beloved peacekeeping husband, reassured his mom and Dean slipped out on to the porch, breathing deep like a therapist he’d seen only once had told him to do. Dean had had a panic attack after kissing Castiel in front of an elderly couple who then condemned him and told them they were headed for Hell. It hadn’t been so much that people had seen them be openly affectionate that had freaked him out, more that Castiel believed in God, and been raised a good Christian boy, and Dean hated to think that by choosing Dean Castiel was sacrificing something pure like heaven or even the possibility of it. Dean had convinced himself he was unworthy. The therapist tried to help, but Dean hadn’t felt comfortable opening up to a stranger and talking about his feelings. The only thing that he had taken away from the session was the breathing exercises that he had a feeling he would be using excessively during the next forty eight hours.
Dean wasn’t a fan of the plan, however he knew Jodie would keep an eye on the girls and it wasn’t like Claire would make going to his grandparent’s easier. She was too much like him, wouldn’t shut up about her life to please others, and in that way Dean guessed he and Cas had done a good job in raising her especially considering the uber-conservative Christian background that her mom and dad had come from. Still, having a strong willed daughter was sometimes a blessing and a curse.
Cas’s eyes narrowed. “Don’t think this gets you out of our argument.”
“You don’t even like Patience. Or Alex.”
Dean rolls over onto his side, facing Cas slowly, barely able to make out his face in the shadows of their room.
"Like hell." Dean retorts.
And it's back. Just after Dean thought he might have hit a weak spot, somehow gotten through and said what he really wanted to say. What he needed Cas to understand. His Mark stained subconscious comes in and ruins the progress. Tears down all the walls that Dean is desperately trying to put up between the two. His humanity thoughts and his subconscious evil thoughts. Dean can't seem to separate the two.
"What do you want me to say Dean?"
In a split second, Dean grabs onto Cas' wrist twisting it terribly a loud crack echoing off the book covered shelves. Dean punches Cas. Cas cries out. He straightens out quickly, ignoring the pain remarkably well grabbing Dean's other arm with his uninjured hand.
me fall asleep?" Cas asks teasing.
8 MONTHS AGO
Cas breathes.
-mild panic attack
“Look, Cas, you are just overthinking it. It’s really not that difficult. You just gotta lay down and get comfortable. Maybe try some yoga? Take a hot bubble bath? You just gotta relax.” Dean says to Cas as they walk out of the CVS a few miles from the bunker. Cas carries a bag with different brands of sleeping pills, teas, and something called lavender lotion? Aromatherapy?
something wrong with him. Dean
Cas is agonizingly quiet, and he stares down at the table deep in thought, teeth chewing on the inside of his cheek nervously. Dean places a hand on his boyfriend's shoulder, shaking him out of his thoughts.
Dean has been kind enough to help Cas with this ‘midlife’ crisis he seems to be having, but Cas knows he can only take so much before Dean starts to get frustrated with him in the process. And again, while living with the Winchesters, Cas feels like a burden.
“Mrs. Peters? I am Agent Hopkins this is my partner Agent Cole, we are with the FBI and we would like to ask you a couple questions.” Dean flashes his badge in front of him and Castiel does the same right next to him, right side up of course, he’s a pro at this point.
“She’s fine,” he shook his head, denial lodging stubbornly in his head. She had to be fine, she was his mom. “She just wanted a change.”
Cas is laying on his side now facing away from the door when Dean enters the room. He’s laying with a hand under his head making his cheeks scrunch up and all chipmunk-like. His dark hair is a mess on the pillow and he is snoring softly. Dean chuckles at the sight and sits next to his feet rubbing his hand slowly up and down his waist to slowly wake him up.
“The FBI? W-what? Why?” Mrs. Peters asks.
Dean frowns at the sight, upset because Cas is upset about something. Something he hasn’t yet voiced to him, but Dean’s not gonna push.
He realizes he might of been a bit harsh to Cas but he can’t help it. Every time he knows Cas is keeping something from him it only reminds him of all the times Castiel has betrayed him in the past and it pisses him off. They
“Cas?” Dean speaks softly.
“Alright, well, I say we head out in the morning. Let’s all get a good night's sleep; we pack up and out of here by 10 tomorrow.” Sam directs to the pair across from him, standing up and shuffling down the hall, waving good night to the pair as he walks away.
You cant, Dean thinks to himself. You won't. Please.
Cas nods slowly, eyes on his lap as if that's where the answer to all his problems lie.
Back at the bunker, Cas is even more overwhelmed than he was before if that is even possible. He has the pill bottles laid out in front of him with his laptop on his lap looking at multiple websites about the different sleeping pills he purchased earlier that afternoon. He is alone now, Dean went to his room to "unwind" so he says, and Sam is probably somewhere with his head in a bucket of research.
"Your soul? Was always so light and bright. I could always pick you out the easiest in a room full of them. They all mostly look the same but yours was different. You are different Dean." Dean softly smiles at this, and sparkling slightly and Cas lets out the biggest yawn. He actually
there is something wrong with him. Cas looks at Dean expectantly, waiting.
They’re standing on Mrs. Peter’s doorstep to interview her about her daughter Alice. She was one of the victims that was taken and killed by the possible so called
"I'm the one that will have to watch you murder the world. So if there's even a small chance that we can save you, I won't let you walk out of this room." Cas, loyal as always. Always fighting side by side with Dean. Of course, he’s gonna fight to save Dean. But he could never physically fight Dean.
“To find Sam. We can’t sit around on this case any longer than we already have.”
After Cas gave up his grace to be human and moved permanently into the bunker. They spent weeks shuffling around each other in the kitchen, in the hall, in the library, everywhere, before finally, Cas was the one to grow a pair and tell Dean his feelings for him. Of course, Dean already knew to some extent but was in some sort of shock hearing himself admit that he reciprocates those feelings. They spent nights together in bed, sometimes Dean’s room and sometimes Cas’s, before agreeing that it was silly for the pair to continue to shuffle between both bedrooms, and both decided that it would be best if Cas moved into Dean's room with him.
. I mean like really unsettling to Cas since he’s been human again. He hoped this time would be easier, seeing he did have a bit of practice after the angels fell, but it’s still strange to him. How does one even get comfortable? And why does he have to count sheep?
This whole transition from angel to human has been extremely difficult for Cas. And he knew it would be, no doubt about that. The eating, the sleeping-well the lack of sleeping, the showering, the
The silhouette finally stands and faces Dean, shoulders squared defiantly. Dean staring right back.
(See the end of the chapter for
What is really creeping him out recently, is the voices in his head. Since they have left the bunker, Castiel has been struggling with a throbbing headache and faint whispering of many voices in his head that he can’t quite make out. It’s almost like a prayer but more concerned like a warning. There’s got to be a hundred voices at once and Castiel can’t make out what they are saying.
“Come to bed?” Dean asks, placing a soft kiss onto his temple, rubbing his thumb in soothing circles on his shoulder.
"Sam and I were trying to cure you! We still are." Cas says to him.
Warnings for this chapter include:
Dean sat eating his bacon and eggs thinking about everything he needed to do to get ready for the road. He needed to pack Cas and his things, they always share a bag now. He needed to make sure Baby was filled with gas and had the extra oil and essentials she needed for an extra-long road trip like this one. He needed to make sure he had any weapons they might need and then some just in case it actually isn’t a werewolf pack. You can never be too careful.
“Everyone has panic attacks at some point in their life.” Sam replies.
It took six hours to interview all the family members and now they are all three back at the hotel after a beer run and a burger run from a local diner just down the street from them. Dean is in the shower singing aloud to a Zeppelin song. Sam is on the phone across the room plugging his unoccupied ear to listen to the other person on the line. Cas is sitting at the small table in the corner, next to a window. His head is in his hands as he feels a wave of nausea and a headache coming on as he looks over the interview notes in front of him.
“Well, that’s why I don’t let Cas drive,” Dean winked at her, having managed to sign ‘no’, ‘drive’ and point as Castiel who was now frowning at his husband.
Dean signed, “my dad. If it wasn’t for him me and Sam would have starved growing up. Well, him and the Piggly Wiggly. I inherited my skills from my mom.”
“It’s not like I can get knocked up!” Claire hissed.
“Best mom ever!”
“I’m saying Claire is with people who love and accept her this holiday season,” he said with an ugly smile and a tip of his glass before he swallowed the rest of the amber liquid down.
“Well, what you are calling love isn’t exactly what the Lord would call love, is it?” Samuel responded.
“Uh, well, technically she will be there… but so will Patience!”
“Oh please, Jonathan, it’s not like you support Dean’s life choices any more than we do,” Samuel said.
“Uh…”
“Cas, we gotta get on the road!” They were taking a road trip, six hours to Sioux Falls, staying the night at Jodie’s, then just less than that to get to their grandparents farmhouse. Dean couldn’t have planned it better, he’ll be exhausted when he gets there, the perfect excuse to not be polite and graceful. Hopefully he can get away with sleeping through the most agonising parts of the day and drinking the rest. Best plan ever.
We hope to see you there.
“Sure,” he agreed, and kissed his grandson hello. “I’m your pumpa and don’t let anyone tell you different, kid.”
“Sure, me too, but it’s Lebanon not New York, she’s probably smoking weed out by the Gas n’ Sip listening to Edgar Allen Poe on audiobooks or something.”
“Why not? They are your family, Dean, that means something to me, to all of us.”
“With Kaia?”
Dean was self-sufficient with food and could grill a steak or make a few classic favourites like burgers or meatballs but he wasn’t one for extended periods of time in the kitchen, often forgetting he’d left something on and burning it or half cooking the vegetables because he wasn’t going to eat them anyway so didn’t bother taste testing them before serving. Claire had taken after Dean in her choices of food and would push a piece of broccoli around for an hour rather than put it in her mouth. They were lucky that both of them had good genes and enjoyed activities like kick-boxing, swimming and the kind of obstacle courses with inflatable boulders and eight feet rope fences. Castiel cooked the way he drove, to the letter of the law or in this case to the gram of the recipe, and it either ended in tears or success and there was no way to anticipate either outcome. Cas still didn’t understand how he could go wrong while following a recipe, but his cousin Gabriel had assured him that cooking was an art and not a science and that made all the difference. Gabriel cooked with his heart and made a damned good living out of it, however the only thing Castiel did with his heart was love Dean and their family with every beat.
“No, I did not. The children of the neighbour I was helping broke into their candy supply and ate a rather large amount of sugared treats before I discovered them.”
“What about the thousands who die in car accidents?” Eileen asked, straight faced.
“If I could fit in that shower with you I would,” Cas said. “However I’m going to get me and Jack dressed and start walking the presents over to the main house. I’ll meet you over there at ten fifteen?”
“I guess make up sex it is. Although we haven’t really got any making up to do, so the name is incorrect.”
Once he was calmer he rejoined his family, and luckily no one mentioned Claire or being gay again, so he was able to drink in peace and watch Castiel laugh at a story that Mary was telling him, something about Dean trying to change Sammy’s nappy and Sam was crawling away from him. Dean couldn’t have been more than five in the story, another remnant of a fucked up childhood but not something he wanted to forget or could resent. Mary had been ill, in and out of treatment centres for cancer. She’d been diagnosed when Sammy was still in her womb but refused early treatment because they would have had to abort. Sammy had been born, costing them both a healthy mother, but Dean hadn’t let him go without love and care even if their dad had been too busy destroying himself over their mom to do his job. Sometimes when Dean remembered that he felt less guilty for disappointing his dad by falling in love with a man, but that was rare.
“It is the morning.”
“Well, no, it isn’t,” Castiel said, looking pointedly at Jack who was playing with Legos on the floor by John’s feet.
They exchanged gifts, Jodie got him a Metallica compilation, some expensive beers, and a pair of gloves. Cas got gloves as well, a book about recycling and a basket of organic foods. Jodie would drive Claire back in time for the New Year, not put her on a plane, drive, Dean made sure that distinction was clear.
They smiled at each other before Dean turned to his dad who gave him a manly handshake and an enthusiastic pat on the back. Behind them Mary hugged Castiel before gushing over Jack.
“I…. did he say what I think he said?” Eileen asked.
“Daddy! Kissmuss!” Jack said excitedly. “Appy Kissmuss!”
“I miss her, where is she this holiday?” Deanna asked, sincerity flowing through her voice. It was why Dean avoided time with grandma even more than spending time with Samuel. His grandfather was an old fashioned ass hole made of homophobia, a little racism and a whole lot of intolerance for anyone who didn’t immediately think he was right, so it was easy to hate him and put up with him for mom’s sake. Grandma, however, was a dear woman with awful taste in men who never bothered to re-educate herself. Her ideas and values were old fashioned because she was old, not because she was being deliberately obtuse. Maybe the result was the same, but intentions mattered where Dean was concerned. He’d not exactly grown up in the most liberal minded family but he knew the difference between hate and ignorance.
- Ew. Cigarettes are gross. I’ll be home in an hour -
“Hey mom,” Dean said, getting out of the car as his mother rushed towards him. She embraced him in a big hug that he didn’t want to escape, not that he could, and when she finally released him he ruffled her surprisingly short blond locks. “Nice hair.”
“If I get one is that a good enough excuse?”
Castiel always sees the mail first by virtue of his nine-to-five at the apiary where he worked, so Dean knows there will be an argument the moment he lays eyes on the cream quilted envelope sat conspicuously atop of a pile of magazine subscriptions, bills and unsolicited credit card applications. The envelope is addressed to Mr Dean Winchester and judging by the looping elegant scrawl Deanna Campbell wrote it out. Dean had as little as possible to do with his grandparents, either set really, but it was impossible to avoid them completely since his mom was determined that they be such a close knit family. Dean parents were still married after forty years and lived together in Lawrence Kansas in the three bedroom house that Dean and his brother Sammy had been born and grown up in. Mary’s parents lived a town over on a sprawling farm that his cousins worked on, and last year John’s parents had moved to a retirement village only an hour away from Lawrence, although in the opposite redirection to the Campbell Farm. Dean himself had never escaped far from home, landing in Lebanon, Kansas, and moving into a three bed with a large lawn and a double garage called Bunker House. Sammy had travelled the furthest and ironically and managed to maintain golden boy status despite, or hell, maybe because, of it. He’d left at the tender age of eighteen for a full ride at college in Palo Alto and ended up opening up a law firm that specialised in helping families. Sam, no matter how much he screwed up, was always everyone’s favourite and Dean couldn’t even blame them when Sammy was his favourite too.
“You’re so big now!” She said as she picked him up out of his booster seat and held him close. “Do you remember me?”
“Claire, you can’t just-”
“Pumpa!” Jack announced gleefully.
Claire put her food down, a sure sign that something serious was going on with her, and bit at her lip before confessing, “I was hoping to go stay with Jodie and… and Alex, you know. Girl time.”
Dean turns slightly to the boy on the floor again and then turns back to face Castiel.
Dean slams Cas’ face into the desk. Four. Times.
“G’night Cas.”
“I’m gonna take a walk.” Sam whispers to Dean, grabbing his coat from the back of the chair and walking outside.
Cas sighs again.
“We are here in regards to your daughters, uh, accident. This will only take a few minutes of your time.” Dean smiles at the lady behind the screen door. She looks uncomfortable and like she might just shut the door on us and lock it behind her. Her eyes move between both Dean and Castiel, sizing them up. Probably questioning whether they are actually FBI agents.
“ Cas uses air quotes during his lecture and huffs against his seat defensively.
“Dean.” Cas whispers.
There is a soft knock at his door, Cas is so engrossed in his thoughts he doesn't hear it at first, only catches the movement of the door opening and Dean poking his head in.
After a few moments of Dean packing and Cas silently sipping on his coffee, Cas speaks up.
Soooo? This chapter is quite uneventful and I apologize for that. I wanted to get some extra events and details and at least part of the drive in there instead of just jumping into the actual hunt or interview parts of the story.
“No problem,” Dean says and gets up to get their shared duffle bag out of the closet. He places it on the bed beside Cas and makes his way to the dresser pulling out sets of clothes for the pair. Cas watches him and continues to sip on his coffee.
"You killed him." The silhouette says, crouched down, its hands rest on the body. The silhouette is very still, breathing deeply. Dean can see the raise of its shoulders as the shadow inhales. It seems to be contemplating what to do next.
Once Sam and Cas are back out they are out of the road again and eleven hours later and all crashing into their motel beds without even bothering to change clothes too tired after an 18-hour drive. That’s one of the longest drives they have done and Dean wonders how far they would’ve made it with just him driving before he called it quits and had to pull over into a motel.
Cas doesn’t usually want to back down from a hunt, but he doesn’t know how to describe the anxieties he feels with this particular case, and he helps they listen to him just this once.
Dean growls silently at his unconscious. Don't you touch him. He thinks.
"Dean," Cas begs. Dean brings his elbow down onto that arm then bringing his hand up to Castiel’s face. Knocking him off guard.
Castiel doesn't move. Not even an inch. He doesn't even blink. He's clearly not frightened by this Dean. Guess we'll have to take this fun up a notch, Deans subconscious says to him quietly.
It amazes Dean how fast and simple they were able to fall into routine together, him and Cas. How easy and perfect it was once Cas became human. Even when they weren’t in the bucker and stuck in some dingy motel sharing a bed with Sam just six feet away. It was always the same.
Dean is quiet for a long while, which only sets Cas's mind faltering even more than it was previously. There
Too late. His subconscious retorts back.
“Why are you so worried, Cas?” Dean questions pressing his lips onto the soft skin there, fingers trailing softly up and down his arm.
“Hey,” Dean says weakly, taking timid steps towards him. “Hey, sweetheart. Sit.”
Dean will never forget the time Cas packed their clothes bag and forgot underwear. Underwear! The most important part! Dean made fun of him the whole trip so much that Cas pouted and didn’t talk to him for a few hours. That never lasts long though. Needless to say, they had to go out of their way to find a store and buy some and ever since then Cas has been in charge of the bathroom supplies and he hasn’t forgotten anything since.
Dean finished his plate of bacon and makes his way to the coffee pot making Cas a cup before he wakes the beast.
I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter and I can’t wait to continue writing this story for you deancas fanatics (hehe) :).
Cas sucks in a deep breath at that. “Don’t even bring that possibility up.”
Dean. That won't ever change. Dean is an open book to Cas, has been from the very beginning. He stares back at Dean with the same intensity.
“Mkay. Do you need anything?” Dean says shortly, standing up.
Castiel hesitates just for a second but it’s a second long enough for Dean to realize he’s keeping something to himself. Dean tries not to show the hurt and betrayal on his face. If Castiel doesn’t want to tell him, he won’t make him.
"Please," Cas begs again, eyes soft but somehow forgiving and understanding. Cas chokes again. Blood dripping from the corner of his mouth. Dean watching, eyes hardening. Cas closes his eyes.
Sam speaks up after a while, “Is he gonna be okay?” Looking at Dean sideways.
"I think the Mark is changing you." Cas retorts easily.
“Oh, burgers! Ha, ha!” He claps his hand in front of him and walks to the table where Sam and Castiel sit. He unwraps the wrapper and takes a bite with a moan. “Oh yes. This hits the spot.” He chews with his eyes closed for a moment before looking at Sam, Sam looking at Cas with worried eyes. And of course, Cas looking blankly out the window, frozen like a statue, fingers twiddling anxiously on top of the table. Dean makes a grunt to Sam locking eyes with his brother, Sam looks at Dean and gives a small shrug.
Cas doesn’t answer and Sam pays no mind to the lack of response considering Castiel seems to be very absentminded lately. He just continues gazing at the interview notes in front of him, barely paying any attention to them. Just thinking.
Cas sighs deeply and goes to turn off the overhead light and replacing it with the bedside table light from his lamp and strides back to the bed, this time under the covers to shield himself from the vulnerability he is about to hold. He lays on his back staring at the ceiling for a long while, contemplating where to start. He can feel Deans eyes on his as he waits and wonders what he is thinking.
"What so your are just gonna
Sleep and the REM cycle is something he will never fully understand even after the hours of research and trips to the local drug store to find ‘melatonin’ Dean had called it? Cas has even tried Benadryl, and PM cough medicine, and teas and white noise and nature sounds, but those were useless even more so. The nature sounds sent him into a mental break down, crying into his pillow one night, waking the whole bunker up. Dean showed up flying into his bedroom with a gun, thinking Cas had been attacked in his sleep, Sam standing just at the door looking helpless and sad as his brother comforted the ex-angel. Cas missed his wings. He missed flying with the birds and swimming to the deepest depths of the ocean, so the nature sounds were a no go.
Just inches from Cas' face.
That’s their permanent routine, never faltering, until now as Dean observes Cas in the mirror, Cas not even bothering as toothpaste drips down his chin and onto his hand on the counter. Cas eyes deep, lost in thought.
The whole car ride here was agonizing painful for him. Listening and not understanding and not able to say anything back.
“Cas.” Dean speaks softly, voice laced with worry. Dean places a hand to Castiel back and he panics. Castiel pushes back his chair with a shriek and wide eyes, hands balled in the fabric of his trench coat. Sam stands with a start as well.
Cas thinks he can fix him. Pull him from his dark thoughts. Dean really hopes he can before he is lost forever.
“Yeah, Cas?”
"Oh, so what?" Dean stares at Cas, trying to break the spell of the Mark. He pours his whole self into those blue eyes so desperately trying to escape. Trying to fight his subconscious taking over him. "So you might find a spell that might take this crap off my arm?" Dean waits. Cas says nothing.
He downs the pills with a glass of cold water and decides to make his way to his bedroom. He stops in front of Deans door. Should he say good night? Thank him for how helpful he has been to Cas these last few weeks? Or just ignore the fact that a deep part of him is aching to crawl in bed with the hunter and curl up beside him and fall asleep there like a kitten, head against his shoulder and all? No. Cas should definitely not do that. Cas
The Mark?
Dean was especially frustrated, considering they just got back from a two-week-long vampire hunt in Colorado. A hunt that he regretfully got injured after getting a little big-headed and threatened two of the vampires at once. He admits that it was his fault and that he was a bit “reckless” as Cas had put it. But even so, he needed to rest, his back still tense and shoulders aching even after the countless hot steaming showers he’s taken, desperate for the hot water to calm the gnawing pain and muscle tears he had caused.
They had been following up on a possible case in a small town in Virginia, researching for days, still stumped on what they possibly could be hunting. Five teenagers were reportedly kidnapped during the day and found weeks later completely torn to shreds. They’ve never heard or seen anything like it.
“Maybe..” Dean replies lost in thought.
“I-I don’t really know.” Castiel replies. “I just was in my head and got spooked. It-it’s nothing really.” Castiel plays with his hands in front of him, nervous.
Cas walks away from Deans room.
“I should be fine Cas. Thank you.” Dean was grateful for his attentive boyfriend but he didn’t like it when other people dove. It was weird to him. I mean let’s be honest it’s no secret that Dean needs to work on his control issues but putting someone else behind the wheel of Baby and giving them the power to end his life in half a second is outrageous to him. It gives him the chills just thinking about it. At least if he crashes it’s his own damn fault and not someone else’s.
What-What are you looking at me for guys I don't know!
Dean tucks the comforter around Cas and sits next to him.
So maybe Dean
Dean lays on his back, staring at the ceiling, feeling very uneasy as Cas has his back to him; he can hear Cas’s soft breathing but knows he is still awake. Dean slightly panicking over his boyfriend's cold shoulder tonight.
“I don’t know man, he was pretty spooked.”
And so now Dean sits, seven hours later, pulling into a gas station to stretch his back and switch driving shifts with Sam. So, apparently, he lost that fight with Cas and now they have been trading driving turns every few hours. Dean thinks it’s ridiculous but it makes Cas feel better and that’s all that matters.
“Oh baby, we are never ready to lose our parents. Why do you think I keep coming back here even after all the years of disapproval and criticism. When I married John I thought I was losing them, and when that didn’t happen I guess I just did everything I could to hang on to them even when it made John uncomfortable, when it made Sam run, and when it made you ashamed. I’m sorry for that.”
“No, Jack ‘can’t just’, because he’s two and can’t understand homophobia or you know most of what people say. I, however, can.”
“Yeah, and it was your fault then too!” Sam groused good naturedly.
“I think we should revisit your stance on smoking,” Castiel said flatly while he chopped up a carrot and some cheese for Jack to snack on while he played on his iPad in front of the tv. It was unlikley he would nap after eating candy but they could hope he drifted off or else he would be a nightmare come four pm.
“Yeah, can’t imagine why Claire would choose to spend time with people who love and accept her rather than family,” he said with heavy sarcasm on the last word. He shook Cas’s hand off and left the room, taking the bottle with him.
Sam gave him a look. “Thanks dad!” Before Sam had made the best choice of his life to date and asked Eileen to marry him, he had been married and widowed within a week, married and divorced within a month, and spent a year in an unhealthy relationship with a drug addict named Ruby who’s gotten him hooked before Dean had carted him off to rehab to get clean. Sam’s mistakes had all been made with good intentions and pure of heart, which was why Dean always forgave him.
“I appreciate that man,” Dean says walking out of the kitchen and back towards his room without another word.
"I can't believe it. Did you just actually yawn Cas?" Dean teases him, bumping his arm into Cas.
Nice subject change Dean. Good one.
Something isn’t right.
He was getting anxious to get all this done and get on the road at a good time.
? You say you
Dean continues throwing punches at Cas. Wherever he can get too. His face, his shoulder, his chin, his mouth. Castiel bringing his arms up to dodge as much as he can but he's not hitting back. Cas was always a good fighter but not as good as Dean is. Dean being slightly bigger than Cas takes him down easily.
Yoooooooo.
Not cause he's bored oh God no, not in this conversation but because he is actually relaxed and tired.
“I-I’m sorry. I-“ Castiel sputters emotionally. “I think I need, I need to lay down.”
Into a book.
It's the worst torture. And he prays that Castiel will give up and just let him be. Dean’s locked in this trance for hours on end.  He wants Cas gone. He prays he will just let the Mark run its course. Every course has its end.
“Damn Cas. You had be worried there for a minute, thought you were going into cardiac arrest right in front of me man.” Dean laughs with a shake in his voice. “You wanna tell me what the hell that was.” Dean says forcefully with little bite to his demand.
“Guys-“ He cuts himself off, struggling to find the right words he wants to say. “This is all we got so far. I don’t think we will get much information without going out there and checking it out ourselves. We’ve done all we can from here; let’s get off our asses and go figure this out.” Sam looks between the two before turning to Cas specifically. “Cas, these are teenagers. Imagine if Claire wasn’t a hunter and this happened to her. You would want to know what the hell it was.”
"So thanks but I'm good." Dean turns away again but this time Castiel doesn't hold back. Of course not.
"I took down a monster," Dean says smoothly shifting his gun his waistband at the base of his back. "Because that's what I do. And I will continue to do that, until-" Dean shrugs nonchalantly.
