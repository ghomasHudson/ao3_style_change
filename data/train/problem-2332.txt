“Don’t ever leave me again.” John exhaled a shaky breath, staring down into the vulnerable eyes of his alpha, and hurriedly bent down to kiss Sherlock’s trembling bottom lip.
Sherlock broke their gaze and walked towards the window overlooking the lush greenery of the yard out back. The light of the full moon casting a blue hue on the forest and it made everything appear enchanted.
Sherlock treated him well enough, always inquiring if there was ever anything John required. Most times, John said there was nothing he needed, but when he did need something, Sherlock was always quick to acquire it for him.
.” Sherlock wept softly, words low, barely a whisper, embarrassment and heat causing a dizzying effect.
Sherlock laughed heartedly, his hand upon his back sliding lower and rounding at his side and tugged him against the warmth of Sherlock’s body. Sherlock’s lips glided up John’s back and higher still until his mouth rested at the nape of his neck.
“Well Sherlock, you are as spirited as ever.” Victor sighed genially, “—because I’m interested in your friend of course.” He ended his explanation by turning to dazzle John with another smile that should be patented
nice.” Sherlock answered honestly, though it was a painful truth, it was based off facts. John’s behavior as of late was something so foreign and it set Sherlock on edge. It frightened him.
The omega stared at John with disbelief and heartbreaking pain. No solid defiance left of the omega John had always known. No longer void of emotion. These eyes held a depth unmatched, so full of everything John had always wanted to know.
"Don't tell me that. Do it!" Sherlock snapped impatiently, wrapping his arms around his belly while turning enough so that his upper half faced John.
"I've decided to move to Ireland. Not too far away, close enough that at least mother and father can come visit."
Clothing was bothersome, but talking was even more so. Talking could come later, when his need for copulation wasn’t so dire. He’d spent the first day of his heat alone, suffering through a heavy fog brought on by his fever. True, with Sherlock’s presence his fever broke enough so that he could recognize and comprehend, but only enough so that his omega’s need to be bred could take over and bring about mating.
John's ring finger filled him then and set about stretching Sherlock's entrance more so than the previous digits. Sherlock felt the coolness of John's ring rub at his rim with every inward thrust and moaned at the knowledge he'd marked John as his with that ring.
The agent nodded his head in confirmation and left. Soon after his departure there was a knock on his door and Mycroft called them in.
John, though no longer needing a job, decided to go job hunting. He didn’t want the Holmes’ money. He wanted to support himself and on his third week, he landed a job at an understaffed clinic.
John's back was facing the camera's eye, so those who'd view this video couldn't see the pain and sadness in those blue eyes.
Sherlock was a consolation prize. A burden placed upon the alpha submissive for his sacrifice for his sister. That was all it was.
“Axel. He’s an American Saddlebred horse, and mum’s favorite.” Sherlock broke through the stillness. John froze for one moment in time. How long had the alpha been watching him? John met the pale gray eyes of his alpha. Sherlock’s eyes brightened as he approached.
"You're not dreaming. I love you, John. I've loved you for a long time, but I was just too stubborn to admit it to myself. It... It's terrifying, but unbelievably thrilling to say it. I know you love me, and I just wanted to confirm that I love-"
“Just a kiss.” John cautioned Sherlock, but it felt like it was more or so a reassurance to himself than anything else, not sure he had it in him to do more.
"I can't." Sherlock admitted at last, and watched as the openness of John's gaze turned guarded and resigned.
"I'll... I'll move out if... if that is what you want, but even if you don't want to live with me or see me, can I still come and see you? See our children?"
John smiled up at Sherlock and curled up close to the alpha. Sherlock raised the bed sheets over their bodies and John didn’t even feel shy about being completely naked pressed up against a completely clothed Sherlock at the moment.
Sherlock would have enjoyed spending another few hours in his alpha's arms, nose shoved against his scent gland and smelling his mate, but his mobile rang insistently. Sherlock begrudgingly answered it and then was asked for his assistance on a case by Lestrade.
Mycroft broke their gaze to stare down at his open folder, and closed it. Not believing Lestrade would look at them, but still feeling the need to conceal the classified information.
John hated feeling this way — helpless and out of control all at the same time. When in the army things were less muddled. His focus was on one objective and he had the respect of his comrades. He trusted those men with his life and would die protecting them, because his troop became his family. He lived with them, knew them as well as he knew himself, and he was driven to see them get through their tour and make it home to their families.
John watched as the blood slowly drained from Sherlock’s face and he took a step back and away from him already knowing what was to come.
Why say it now? John couldn't possibly want to hear about his feelings. He had Mary now. He was happy with his proxy alpha. But Sherlock did this mostly for himself. It hurt. The ache in his heart bled with grief, knowing it would mean nothing for John. Still, Sherlock needed to say it. He needed to know that at least John knew, because when he died, he didn't want to have any regrets.
John stared at the pale hand anxiously and he cautiously tipped his head in acceptance. His eyes fluttered shut when smooth fingers glided over the bruised healing flesh. The pads of the alpha’s fingers seemed to lick a hot tingling path over the bite mark and John let out a shuddering breath.
"Oh..." John whispered softly, bowing his head and looking at his shoes. The subconscious submissive gesture going unnoticed by the alpha, but not the always observant omega.
John looked just short of being unhinged and gave a hurried nod. "I need you too. You can take it, yes?"
“I…” Sherlock stopped himself, because he would not apologize. Why did he have to apologize for John’s mistake? John was the one who’d foolishly stopped his suppressants and thought he’d be receptive, which Sherlock could never be.
"That's it, love. So strong. You are doing beautifully." John's lips brushed against his temple as he pushed.
"Yes." Sherlock answered, his voice strangely rough. Maybe it was the weather that was affecting it.
“What is it then?” Sherlock barked, hating how he felt lightness that John wasn’t like other alphas who appreciated the looks of omegas like Victor.
John lifted one leg and pressed it at one end of Sherlock's chest, while his other dragged up and closer to the other side. Gripping the headboard with both hands, John bowed his head to look at Sherlock. Groaning deeply as he watched Sherlock reach out for his hard neglected cock and hurriedly guided it to his mouth.
John turned to watch the omega closely. Victor moved to the living room, seated himself on a couch, crossed his legs, and tossed a folder onto the coffee table before leaning back in his seat and folding his arms across his chest.
“Please… Please save my babies. I don’t care what happens to me, I don’t, just, please, save my babies. They have to live, please, don’t take them away. Don’t take my babies.” John moaned in anguish and unexpectedly Sherlock was at his other side, a large hand palming his damp forehead and a smooth voice was whispering in his ear.
“Really, John.” Sherlock sighed, wishing his husband would accept his desire willingly, yet understanding the doctor’s pause.
Mycroft had taken Sherlock’s John, and his alpha could not bear the idea of never seeing John again. He knew he could never find John now, not with Mycroft still alive and able to counter every pursuit he would make in search for the one person that meant everything to him.
“I know you’ve gone through a lot of changes in such a small amount of time. It can be difficult to make so many adjustments.”
Mycroft shut his eyes briefly and nodded with relief, though for his brother’s marriage remaining untarnished or that Lestrade wasn’t involved with John, Mycroft couldn’t tell.
Sherlock decided to push the limits of John’s comfort and began walking around the flat bare as the day he was born. The first time Sherlock walked out of their room naked and up to John who was cleaning up Sherlock’s mess of a failed experiment, Sherlock felt victorious. John’s face turned red.
John lowered his hand from his face and looked over Sherlock’s shoulder, unable to meet those beautiful blue eyes anymore, it hurt too much.
Sherlock's silver eyes lowered to the ground. Mycroft knew him well enough to know he'd never wanted his heat, never wanted children. Then again, he'd never wanted to marry, but he had. Regardless, he'd been contemplating the option with more certainty than question.
Sherlock rose to his feet and without saying another word, he left the room. John began to contemplate the alpha’s words.
John flinched when lips pressed against the fresh bond bite, soft lips grazed the tender flesh, but never did anything more than that. John couldn’t seem to relax in the alpha’s hold, even if he wanted to fight his way out of it, it would be useless, alphas were stronger than omegas. This was better than bonding, better than being bred. He just needed to stay still, allow his alpha to scent him, reassure his alpha instincts that John was his. If he did this, it bought him two more months to prepare himself for the dreaded day his heat cycle would begin.
John stared at Sherlock completely lost. His mouth parted slightly, words attempting to work their way to the surface, but struggling to get there.
Mycroft looked at the omega in long silence, before speaking, "I will be watching you, dear brother. Behave and let John care for you."
Mycroft knew that if he truly wished to accept Gregory’s affections there was nothing truly stopping him from doing so. Only, Mycroft couldn’t. Gigi was too important and he knew he couldn’t replace the place in his heart where Gigi resided with someone else.
The jet lurched and began gliding down the paved pathway, and the distant figure of Mycroft became smaller and smaller. John shut his eyes as the jet lifted off the ground and tears dampened his shut lids.
“Sherlock… isn’t the easiest person to handle and he wouldn’t like the terms of which you were matched. In the end though, how you two met isn’t as important as to how you make this bond work. Lying about how you met is a small sacrifice you’ll be making to ensure your sister lives.” Mycroft contemplated.
During his first two heats, John was unmated and had taken care to pleasure himself through it, and the heats slowly subsided. Now that John was mated, Sherlock should have bred him until his heat abated, but Sherlock had cast him aside. John’s omega was left hankering for Sherlock's presence and it had driven him to seek out his mate. Sherlock was still absent, so he’d thought by pleasuring himself he could ride his heat alone until Sherlock returned.
, but at that time I was struggling. I thought I'd remain in a loveless marriage - on your part, and that was painful. Thinking I would spend the rest of my life mated and married, but so alone, I latched onto Victor for comfort. We understood each other so well and I felt his pain as my own. I should have been more firm and less indulging, but I felt for Victor so much that I hesitated in hurting him when he confessed to me and I'm sorry for it hurting you. I never wanted to hurt you."
Sherlock didn't like cats. Never had. They were too small. They had evil eyes. They purred, which was bloody strange. They were friendly and then they weren't - or so that was how the cats in his neighborhood as a child were like.
“Kiss me.” John whispered, overcome by the feeling of Sherlock’s hips dragging as he entered him further.
John had lied to save his sister and sure in certain ways, John had done right by Harry. But in so doing, he'd started their relationship based on a lie. A lie, if Sherlock was truly being honest with himself, did not have any grounds on why they fell in love. Sherlock had fallen in love with John's character, not the lie.
"Please be nice to your mother. He's irritable and needs a good night's rest for you. Take care of him, because he's taking such good care of you. Daddy will watch over mummy, and make sure you all get to come out and see us when you're ready."
“It’s all so beautiful.” John admired Dartmoor and Sherlock merely sighed, wishing the drive was over so that they could start up on their case.
"Please..." Sherlock found the words falling off his lips before they even registered, his omega was present, ready and needing. No more inhibition, everything was coming out, no thoughts to be stifled by logic. No desires to be hindered and forced away. Sherlock, the genius, was no more. What lay beneath John now was the omega Sherlock.
John thanked her each and every time she’d done it, but always felt guilty when they arrived home and their unaware parents grounded her for ditching. Telling their parents what was happening to him wasn’t worth it. His mother would become an emotional mess and his father would be overwhelmed by the stress of it all. They’d tried, so, so, so many times to get John’s school to do something about the bullying, but it never amounted to much. John couldn’t allow his sister to continue to be disciplined by their parents and at last convinced Harry he was okay. That he could take care of himself. Harry reluctantly agreed, but only if John promised to let her know when it became too much.
John’s eyes were just shutting; hope of another dream in his heart, when there came three sharp insistent knocks on his door. Tired dark blue eyes opened and stared over his folded arm to the door ten or so feet away and he quietly contemplated ignoring it, hope that the person beyond it would leave him to his wallowing in peace, but then another three knocks followed, louder now and all the more insistent.
"I needed you and you just..." Sherlock's body trembled with his words, breaking their gaze at this sudden admission.
Sherlock looked fiercely at John, silently willing the alpha to look up, but the man’s head remained lowered.
John smiled wordlessly at Sherlock as he neared the bed and Sherlock stubbornly shut his eyes, even as his body moved to face John. The alpha slipped into the bed and Sherlock blindly reached out for the man, feeling him tense momentarily from the surprise of being touched, before the alpha relaxed and Sherlock wrapped his arms around his waist.
"See! You think I look ridiculous." Sherlock pointed an accusing finger at his mate, his eyes stinging, and he hated himself more for it.
“Oh enjoying the thrill of the chase is fine. Craving the distraction of the game, I sympathize entirely. But
John’s eyes snapped open and he gradually took in his surroundings; he was in a dimly lit hospital room. Lying on his back gave him the freedom to turn his head and observe the dark sky out the window. It had been late at night when they’d met Moriarty, John didn’t think he’d be waking so soon after… A day or so must have passed.
"You're ready." John knew -- though he'd never scented an in-heat omega before -- his instincts told him Sherlock was at full peak. The omega's body was ready to accept him.
Sherlock locked eyes with John as he took a deep inhale of nicotine. Holding his breath as he drew the fag away and leisurely dabbed the ashes over a saucer filled with used up butts of cigarettes, and resting on the arm of his chair.
John sighed deeply, but said nothing. Victor was hurting because John had foolishly led the omega on, though he'd thought he'd made himself clear to Victor that he wasn't looking for a relationship. He shouldn't have befriended Victor when concealing his personal life.
John watched understanding flicker in sea green depths and Sherlock’s tense form relax before he gifted John with a soft smile.
The dinner at Angelo’s went well enough. They’d ordered their meals and Sherlock had been obliging and open to whatever it was John wanted to talk about. John could tell the alpha was trying his best to make up for his outburst the night before, but really…compared to Sherlock’s behavior, John’s was far less reasonable.
John was hurting. Sherlock knew this. He hurt his husband in the pursuit of a case and he couldn’t understand the constant painful throbbing of his heart every time John looked at him in that way. In the way that seemed to plead with him to pull away from The Woman.
Sherlock said nothing. His tongue was immovable. He could only swallow audibly and exhale a trembling breath.
Sherlock kissed John's jawline wetly, his hands moving to splay over John's chest as they had done before, his back arching with the slow undulations his pelvis made. Gently rocking up and down. Sherlock's muscles contracting with every downward thrust and John could hardly contain himself, the bliss growing with each move of those hips, becoming unbearable.
The second push, hurt worse than the first. Each push after proved more difficult and hard to endure. Breathing was suddenly a confusing complex act; he stuttered in his breathing and stopped pushing altogether, sobbing through the pain and glaring at the doctor who encouraged him to keep pushing.
John couldn't say anything. His eyes filled with the tears he faught so hard to hold in, hating how Mary knew him better than he knew himself. Though he knew she was right.
John hesitantly dabbed at the bleeding wound and glanced up into Sherlock’s eyes. The alpha’s face was tense, but gave no more indication of feeling any pain as he cleaned the wound. John broke his gaze from the alpha to further focus on his task at hand.
Sherlock angrily knocked on the dark wooden door before him, impatiently tapping his foot on the floor, awaiting a response. The door slowly opened to reveal an exhausted Mycroft Holmes. The young man raised a hand to rub at his eyes, his dark green silk robe slipping off one shoulder as he did so.
give it to me." Sherlock felt the corners of his lips twitch in a faint smile. His sore face pulsed with the pain of the action, but it was worth it to watch John's gaze fill with fear.
“John.” Sherlock whispered the moment he was close enough to scent beyond the browning onions and discover the heady smell of his arousal.
Sherlock’s cock felt hot to the touch, it was a beautiful red, and twitched with its plea and John wanted to answer Sherlock’s needs. Laving wetly along the lengthy shaft, John craned his neck and pressed his forehead against Sherlock’s stomach all while mouthing the wet crown of his husband’s gorgeous erection.
Time passed and the alpha remained deadly still and the breathless cries John made were all the more deafening. One of Sherlock’s hands rubbed his lower back and his other carded long slender fingers through feather-light blond hair. It was consoling and over time John was able to comprehend he’d had another nightmare. It was embarrassing to know that he’d lost control and the alpha had now seen him at his weakest. It was just another stab to his pride. Another reminder why everyone always said an omega was weak.
“Go.” John spoke gently, wondering if Sherlock needed more support on his part, and willingly giving it.
Sherlock wasn't sure how many pups he was having, but he'd since learned after his first visit with the gynecologist he was having both sexes. Sherlock didn't think he could buy each pup their own dog as their home would be overflowing with children and dogs. Not unless they moved to a bigger home, which Sherlock wasn't yet ready for.
Sherlock remained voiceless for several beats, only because he’d spared those moments to press his lips along the bridge of John’s nose in a warm delicate kiss.
"Stop!" Sherlock demanded, slamming his fist against the kitchen table and glaring at his treacherous alpha.
Harry turned back in the direction they’d come from. John smiled grateful; a sense of relief filled him as he watched after her departing form.
John understood then and hated how he couldn’t stop his eyes from watering over in that moment. Sherlock really felt the same. Sherlock really did care deeply for him. He could be falling in love with him at this very moment.
John assumed the pommel was the front of the saddle as Sherlock patted it once before offering up the reins to him. John securely placed his foot in the stirrup, his left hand gripping Sherlock’s and the reins, while his other tightened around the pommel. While lifting himself over the saddle, John felt Sherlock’s hand palm the back of his leg and guide him so that he was now comfortably seated over the horse.
John knew that though their marriage wasn’t what he’d once wanted, things changed. If John never married Sherlock he would have never allowed himself to get to know the alpha and therefore, he would have never loved Sherlock. John loved Sherlock more than he ever thought he could love another person. Sherlock was it for him. He knew there would be no one else for him. He was true to his status, an omega by birth and instincts. Mated and bound to one for all his life.
Grabbing hold of the lamp at the far side of the room, Sherlock hurled it at the alpha and scarcely missed him.
He wasn't having an affair. He wasn't in love with Victor. He just wanted this kindred spirit to remain undisturbed. He knew Sherlock would hate it and demand he stop associating himself with Victor, and John didn't want to. Sherlock was emotionally cold and distant, John needed something to balance the stressors of his life of lies and this was it. So no, John wouldn't stop seeing Victor, not even for Sherlock, and so this friendship of theirs would have to remain a secret.
Sherlock took more deep breaths, his fingers trembling against his skin and John’s omega was close to whimpering in need for its alpha, for the strong Sherlock he knew and not this frightened husband that wasn’t the same husband he’d married. John’s omega couldn’t bare his alpha feeling frightened.
“Sherlock.” John whined, because if he said anything else he worried his omega would take it, yet again, in the wrong way. Apparently, John was horrible at this and should have just shut up.
John glanced over to his left and was met by the sight of a sickly pale Sherlock. Blood staining the sleeves and the un-tucked hem of his white button up shirt, his chuffs untied and rolled up partially, the first two buttons of his shirt let loose. Sherlock’s dull blue eyes had yet to notice his gaze. Sherlock’s eyes were red and puffy, dark bags hung under his eyes, evidence that he hadn’t slept. Curled tresses were frizzed in a unkempt mess, the cause of running his fingers through it a couple hundred times.
John was blissfully happy, even within their ice cold flat, he couldn't help himself. He was smiling like a loon most times and it was a wonder Sherlock hadn't insulted him for it. Sherlock...
“I told you already that I won’t hurt you! Why won’t you believe me?” Sherlock pleaded helplessly, his voice was raw. John wasn’t sure if it was because he’d strained it or was choking back emotion. Sherlock rose up from the bed and the two stared at the shadow of the other’s form.
John would enter Sherlock’s room early in the morning, wake the slumbering alpha with his mouth descending on Sherlock’s flaccid cock and love it to hardness, until Sherlock drifted away from the fog of sleep to find John greedily sucking his cock and moan for want of more.
Raising his hands up, Sherlock gripped John's ass cheeks and yanked him closer, taking more of John's cock, gagging as he adjusted to the fullness of a little more than the head, and exhaled shakily from his nose.
It wasn’t like Sherlock didn’t know how to be faithful. Sherlock hadn’t slept with anyone else since they’d started whatever it was they had between them. Or at least John didn’t think so. Sherlock spent all his nights with him for three whole years and most of their days were spent at the flat and working cases. There were the time gaps were John was at work or shopping and Sherlock was experimenting or exploring leads alone, but John never scented another on the alpha. There was also the fact that whenever someone flirted with Sherlock his face would contort to one of malicious intent or disgust. Why couldn’t Sherlock refuse an omega and remain exclusively John’s?
“Always been able to keep myself distant… divorce myself from… feelings. But look, you see…” Sherlock offered his shaking hand as proof and John winced at Sherlock’s cold words—something the old Sherlock would never tell him. Others, yes, but never to John, because sentiment was understandable when in relation to John. Not anymore. Sherlock rejected sentiment and somehow, John forgot this, and he didn’t know why he chose to ignore what was so plain now.
Sherlock swallowed audibly, tucking his arms awkwardly near his chest, and bit his tongue at the closeness that was involved with the way John now held him. This was not a time to be thinking about what John looked like naked, but the blasted footage began replaying in his mind. Now feeling those same hands that had been used to give themselves relief were now touching Sherlock, scenting Sherlock further in his husband’s scent. Sherlock’s head was so close to John’s, that if he wanted, Sherlock could easily wedge his nose against John’s scent gland and immerse himself in his alpha completely. He didn’t even think John would mind — being as John was apparently in love with him, but Sherlock wouldn’t allow his omega’s wishes to take over so completely he’d act familiar with a man he should never be familiar with.
"Mrs. Holmes," John called. His mother's glare turned to that of admiration when they'd averted their gaze to John.
“No.” John whimpered brokenly. “SHERLOCK!” John screamed and could do nothing but watch helplessly as the man he’d been arranged to marry, the man he’d sworn to hate, but now loved with all his being… his beautiful Sherlock spread his arms and leaped from the building.
“No!” Sherlock slammed his hand against a nearby table, and focused on calming his erratic breathing. “That was low, John. That… I told you no intimacy. A bite was all I would allow.”
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes, do you commit yourself to John Hamish Watson? Do you promise to love, honor, respect, communicate with each other, to look to your own emotional health so that you can relate in a healthy way, and to provide a healthy home for children if you choose to have them; to be a support and comfort for your partner in times of sickness and health, till death do you part?”
“I’ll handle this case alone then. John.” Lestrade said, and validated John’s presence as he left. The look in his eyes told him that the DI would have some questions. John moaned and palmed his face; he could just imagine the questions Lestrade would have lined up at their next meeting.
John swallowed thickly. Since that night where they… they hadn’t done anything like it again. It had been a week and a half since, but Sherlock hadn’t initiated another copulation of sorts and John had been too nervous to do so himself.
Sherlock rocked forward, pressed his forehead against John’s jaw and hummed hoarsely, mouthing the sweat drenched skin of his neck as he pummeled John’s taunt entrance, shooting load after load deep within the sweltering heat of his channel. Sherlock shuddered with his release, gritting his teeth to stifle back cries, but a helpless whimper slipped out as his cock pulsed and John felt it. At the base of Sherlock's deeply embedded cock something began to grow, pressing at the edge of his rim and further inside of him, expanding inch by inch, making it all the more difficult to breathe.
John's face pinched in a grimace and after a handful of frantic jerking of his cock, he shot out his release to the floor. Those who didn't know John as Sherlock did would assume it was from his orgasm rippling through his body, but not his omega. No, John grimace with the mention of what this was, a video that would be viewed by the world.
Sherlock’s mobile rang then, and John watched as the alpha growled with frustration before retrieving his phone and growled a furious, “What is it Lestrade?”
. It felt good. Breathing heavily into their kiss, Sherlock experimentally met John's tongue with his own.
He might not believe the validity of John's professions of love, but the actions John took could not dispute those same proclamations. So John thought Sherlock gorgeous. He thought him perfect. And looking into John's sincere, love-filled eyes, Sherlock could find no falsehood.
Sherlock's eyes widened with horror as that blasted measuring tape neared the girth of his belly. Snatching up the tape with frantic hands, Sherlock hatefully bunched it up within his hands before hurling it as far away from himself at physically possible.
"A whore like you could never be faithful to me. But let me warn you John. If I ever learn of your infidelity, I will unman you before you dare to cheat on me again."
“Forty-five minutes.” Harry answered, glancing away from the GPS to check up on John, her face a mixture of worry and anger.
The DI was a confident and compassionate man. He was a man who went out of his way to help others and could see the good in people. He sought justice. In many ways, Lestrade reminded Mycroft of Gigi. There were differences, of course there would be, where there had been gentleness in Gigi there was strength in Lestrade. This strength unsettled Mycroft.
“Will you taste me now?” John was hopeful. He wanted Sherlock’s to take him by his mouth as he’d done that one time he’d first brought John off during his heat.
“Well… firstly, you’re unbelievably perplexing. I can never seem to figure you out. You say one thing, but do the opposite. You have so many dimensions to you; different personas you project to others and all seem to contradict who you are when we’re alone.”
The alpha and his inner omega didn't want this, but to hell with his wolf. His wolf was battered down, broken and lost because of this alpha and he didn't deserve forgiveness for that. For what John had done to him with his carelessness. There was no letting that go.
"I'm damaged. I'm wrong for you. I love you, but I'm not ready. I'm not ready for this." John swallowed past the painful lump in his throat. "I'm not ready for you."
John tensed, the action pure aggression, and if anyone else but his mate had done so to him, it would be in his rights to attack the wolf. One did not flash one's canines if one did not wish to battle. Death for one of the parties usually followed the action. For a mate to do so to their counterpart, an omega to do so to their alpha, was a challenge for power. John had long ago accepted that he held no power within their relationship. He'd relinquished his rights to be any kind of alpha to his mate when he'd broken him. Sherlock did such to show that he was the one in power and it should be John's place to give, submit to Sherlock, an omega. Humiliation to the extreme for an alpha, but that was his intent, to humiliate and shame John.
Rising from his chair, John left the living area and went to his old room upstairs. They now used it for storage. Sherlock never went up there, but John did. It was the perfect place to keep things he wanted hidden from his husband. Only one thing he hid here and now he was to reveal it.
“I was right? Right about what?” John snorted with disbelief and amazement, glancing at the phone that could seemingly tell another person about himself.
John shut his eyes, inhaled a wavering breath, attempting to heal his pain with his love for Sherlock, but it only made his heart ache more.
Sherlock inhaled sharply, a hand unsteadily pressed against the small of John’s back, bringing him closer so that the alpha wrapped him in his strong arms. Then John broke the chaste kiss, landing heavily on his feet and smiled up at the godsmacked face of an utterly bewildered Sherlock.
“Leave a note when?” John’s omega whimpered within, his mind turning quickly, attempting to understand, though a part of him feared he knew. He’d once written his own note with this hospital in mind.
"So help me Gregory-" Mycroft began threatening, refusing to open his eyes still, because he might be just a fraction too shy to see Gregory after what they'd done.
“It’s not wrong.” Sherlock protested, rolling over to lay behind the omega, and pressed a hand to John’s hip. “We’re married.”
There was only one option in righting Sherlock's mind completely and that... John couldn't do that. Sherlock wouldn't allow it and John grew sick at the idea that if he couldn't find another way to right the omega, to reassure him of his feelings, that in the end he might be forced to do so. But not now. No, John couldn't even think about that. He'd die before he forced himself on the omega all so he could right the tattered mind of his mate.
Sherlock was currently setting up training pads for the dogs when John's voice rang out through the home. John had come earlier than Sherlock intended for him to. Waddling out of the hallway and into the living room, he was met by the sight of a confused John.
“For you to admit that a little knowledge of the solar system and you'd have cleared up the fake painting a lot quicker.”
"I... You're bloody frustrating." Sherlock huffed agitatedly, "I've never wanted to yell at someone more than you. Lord, not even Mycroft drives me into fits of anger like you do. I... You are kind, understanding, and patient, but beyond that you are... You have always... stayed. I... don't know how to speak... in regards to sentiment, but I... I feel the most sentimental about you... No one else... just... you."
“That wasn’t a clarification.” John answered, restlessly staring into the brightness of his husband’s eyes, trying to search them for answers. “Sounded somewhat like an insult, really.”
“Oh.” Sherlock gasped, hands gripping tightly to John’s hips, steadying him as John sat himself astride his cock.
John wasn’t sure how long he’d let the alpha scent him, but the sky steadily darkened and in that time, John’s hands uncertainly moved to grasp to the damp shoulders of the alpha.
"I don't care about that." John cut in, knowing how difficult it could be to remove something from the web once it was there.
John moved closer, until every part of him was hard-pressed against Sherlock's larger frame. Leaning on a bent elbow near Sherlock's back, so he was leaning upright, high enough to meet Sherlock's gaze without having his mate crane his neck too much to still see him.
Sherlock frowned and looked away, staring at the wall. Obviously not appreciating John's reaction. He'd thought he'd be more--
"John. John. John. John. John. John," was all John could hear, from a voice that left him feeling as if he were still in the pit of fire. That voice haunted him in his dreams and here it was again, and there was no running away from it.
Sherlock kept close to John on their way through the maze, but after several hours passed and John still hadn’t found their way out, he turned to the amused alpha.
Sherlock bit back a whine. He felt helpless. John nuzzling his neck and scenting him made Sherlock’s stomach flutter with butterflies.
As John set his groceries on the counter of the kitchen island, he dipped his head low with the bitter feeling of self-loathing making a place within. John loved Sherlock, more than anything else in this world John
Sherlock waited a good five minutes after having seen John exited the restaurant to pay for his meal and leave. He hadn't made it a block away from the Mexican restaurant before his phone rang out and he answered, knowingly.
However, John did see Victor. It was less than before Sherlock discovered their secreted friendship, but he knew it was far more than what Sherlock would have wanted. None, would be most pleasing for his omega. John always told Sherlock when he was going to meet up with Victor, and where they were meeting. He always felt guilty when Sherlock's eyes turned soft and directed their focus on anything but John's own. He didn't like it, but John was not ready to give up this friendship. He needed a friend in his life right now.
First thing was first, he would wash his feet and hands, redress himself, then he'd search the internet and catch up with the world that had been revolving while he'd been in hospital. After, he'd find himself a case, a simple hack to the NSY database would do it.
“Sherlock...” John said and breaking the seemingly never-ending silence, knowing Sherlock was still up because John still couldn’t sleep.
Sherlock was still on the case, he most likely wouldn’t come home for a long while. Rising to his feet, John began putting the food away and when the kitchen was clean, he headed to their room and readied himself for bed. He was exhausted and had to wake early for work.
"Please." Sherlock was begging for it and he didn't care. Nothing mattered, nothing else but them, their bodies tangled up in the sheets, the dampness of his skin clinging to the sheets, all while he himself clung to John, in need of everything his alpha could provide and would.
The warmth of a large hand took hold of his, stopping him, and John turned to meet soft silver-blue.
John felt embarrassed that he'd taken Victor to a small and unimportant restaurant. Victor must have been more accustomed to higher class restaurants, such as the French restaurant they'd met in.
“Now, brother, really? I would never kill John. I just… sent him far away. Somewhere you’d never be able to find him.”
“They don’t know how to express their feelings.” John led again, finding this was another way of confessing and finding out just how Sherlock felt.
John glanced down at the coffee table, weary of opening it, but feeling completely out of place. Knowing nothing, he moved closer and retrieved it.
Sherlock said nothing for a long while and John was forced to raise his head and meet those fascinating blue depths. He found warmth in those eyes, acceptance, and something else John was unable to classify.
When there came a quick rap at his bedroom door, Sherlock didn't hear it. But he did hear when John called out his name beyond the door. The omega jumped, feeling guilty and horrified when the door opened and John walked in.
Sherlock didn’t refuse John’s offer of breakfast. Seating himself across from the omega, Sherlock ate. John watched Sherlock in wonder for several minutes, before he ate himself. John smiled broadly when Sherlock finished his plate and happily took it and began cleaning up after them as Sherlock went back to his microscope.
Forking a piece of the cake, John offered his piece up to Sherlock’s pursed lips and waited for the omega to accept his offer. Sherlock stared at John stubbornly and John knew the likelihood of Sherlock refusing him was high and so he began to mentally prepare himself.
John smiled and inhaled deeply, shifting slightly and raising a hand to wipe the weariness from his eyes, forcing Sherlock's hand to slip low and cup lightly to his neck.
Sherlock wanted the latter now. He wanted to shame the alpha and destroy him. One of the many threats he'd made on the alpha flashed in his mind now, refreshed  by his anger and vengeance. He'd become volatile, and he didn't care.
"That's what you keep saying." Sherlock huffed, glaring at the wall across from them, unable to snap at the alpha's affections. His hug was tight and warm, it made Sherlock think irrationally. Things like: it was because of John's arms around him that he felt whole, and if he pulled away now, he would fall apart.
is at the flat? He… came to Baker Street?” Sherlock deduced the clarity in Mrs. Hudson’s words, but still… Sherlock found it hard to register the truth of them. John seeking him out just seemed so… beyond belief. Why John would…
“I wasn’t masturbating, Sherlock!” John raged, palming his face, mortified that his husband actually thought he’d be…
John inhaled shakily and placed his hand over Sherlock’s own resting in the space between their bodies.
Sherlock squirmed in his seat at the top of the stands, his breathing irregular, lips dry, fingers wringing at themselves.
“That’s true, isn’t it?” John smiled and Sherlock’s gaze never wavered, scanning his features for something.
"John..." Mary breathed, pained by the omega's tears, alpha pheromones filling the room and comforting John slowly but surely.
Gregory searched Mycroft’s gaze, attempting to read past the coldness and grasp onto the warmth of emotion, but there was only ice.
to ease the way for his cock. It would hurt regardless of his attempts, but if he prepped Sherlock enough, the pain would be far less so than without it.
John was surprised to find Sherlock had already set his robe at the foot of the bed and was under the covers waiting with a smug grin upon his face.
"I'm sorry." John apologized, causing Mary to raise her head and sent him a weak smile of acceptance. "I know this isn't easy for you."
John was being evasive and Sherlock hated it. He hated that John wasn’t looking him in the eyes. He hated that John wasn’t talking to him freely—only when Sherlock spoke did John reply, but he wasn’t starting up a conversation and suddenly Sherlock understood. Feeling triumphant, Sherlock smiled smugly at the alpha.
“You didn’t listen to a word I was saying, just staring out the window miserably. I’m almost offended, but look at you… You’ve become a lovesick puppy.” Harry smirked.
John arrived home later that evening with the full intent of packing some clothes and going to some hotel for the next few days. He didn't expect to find Sherlock there, pacing the living room floor and glancing at his wristwatch just as John opened the door and entered.
“We can’t… for another week, but I… could we scent, because I very much would like for us to smell of each other.”
Carefully, with thought and stealth, Sherlock slipped out of John's loosened arms and off of the bed. He stood at the side of the bed for a moment, just to be sure that in his shuffling he had not woken the alpha. John didn't move. His breathing remained the same, his features never twitched. He was still sleeping.
“I said I didn’t have to know you to know about your military background and your sister’s drinking habits.”
John rolled to face Sherlock and rested his head on the edge of Sherlock’s pillow, faces inches apart, John searched Sherlock’s eyes for some answer as to what he was thinking, but found nothing.
Sherlock broke into 221B Baker Street that night. Mycroft hadn't felt the need to leave him his keys to a home he would no longer be living in. That was what Mycroft thought. Sherlock wouldn't leave his home for the alpha's that easily.
John was pleased Sherlock was being validated for his work, but he also feared the growing fame, because the press was known to turn on those in the light. John couldn’t take Sherlock being cruelly talked about by the press. They’d already turned on John after… after Moriarty attacked him. He could only imagine what they’d say about Sherlock.
“No, no, no. I can't possibly be away from the office for any length of time. Not with the Korean elections so… Well, you don't need to know about that, do you? Besides, a case like this, it requires... legwork.”
“Normally, your registration papers would have been sent to a government official and they’d have sent someone to escort you to take your test, then they would have finished registering you into their data base, and sent out your status to registered unbound omegas. You would have been allowed to meet each and choose who would be your mate, but that is not what is happening with you.”
John lowered his hands and found Sherlock staring at him from across the room, body trembling erratically, breathing unsteady, eyes shimmering pools of need.
John smiled, tilting his head in voiceless question and Harry elaborated with a twinkle in her eyes.
Green eyes were widely staring down at Gregory, one quaking hand raised to palm his kiss-bruised lips.
"I heard you." John sighed, removing his hand from his mouth to instead run his fingers through his hair. "You are a complete nutter, but I hear you."
Gregory stumbled back, being led by Heather’s insistent pushing, until he fell back onto his couch with Heather on top of him. The woman’s hands glided over his shirt, additional warmth as she controlled their kiss.
When they arrived home, John set about to checking their blog while Sherlock went to his room early and stayed there for the remainder of the day. When John headed to bed, he lay contemplating Sherlock's behavior and was unable to come to a solid reason as to what was bothering the omega. John supposed the act had taken its toll, or perhaps Harry asking about them having pups had disturbed Sherlock so much more than John realized. John really didn't know, but he hoped it settled out in the end.
"It looks so different." John whispered to himself more than to Sherlock, but the omega heard, and a part of him grew worried.
“I’m going to kill you, Mycroft!” Sherlock shouted as the newly arrived agents helped the tiring four in removing Sherlock from Mycroft’s office.
“Do you have friends—people, you know, people you like, people you don’t like…? Girlfriends, boyfriends…”
Sherlock lurched to a sudden stop at that voice's proclamation, in the middle of the street. Cars blared their horns, but the omega couldn't hear them over the building voices.
John forced himself to eat the rest of his meal, unable to speak anymore, and still felt Sherlock’s eyes on him, staring suspiciously. John felt momentary reprieve when Sherlock’s attention refocused back out the window.
He sat heavily; sheathing Sherlock’s engorged cock fully into himself, a strained noise spilling out of him. Needing more, needing to be knotted and stuffed full of Sherlock’s seed drove John’s movements.
Mycroft hadn’t expected to find much out of the ordinary, Gregory’s life was rather predictable and he liked that - the assurance that no matter how chaotic life became at work, Gregory remained the same.
John smiled up at the sheer concentration marring the beautiful face of his Sherlock, “More, Sher… I can take it.”
John would drag Sherlock to the table and they’d eat in relative silence. They’d then plan out their day. Sometimes they’d go window shopping and John would have a grand time while Sherlock would bicker about all the more productive things he could be doing right then. When there were festive city gatherings and events he had an interest in, he would drag Sherlock along.
John started back up on therapy and went out to visit his doctor instead of staying in his home. Then John went back to work and there he tried to distract himself with his patients instead of dwelling within his grief, but never did he stop mourning or longing to join his mate.
John finally understood who he was… and yet… John couldn’t stop himself from stuttering out, “I’m… I’m nobody. I just met him.”
. We don’t need a mediator. Tell me what it is you require and I will provide it for you.” Sherlock insisted considerately, turning to lean in close.
.” John sighed pleasantly, his hands stroking over Sherlock’s back. The fabric of his shirt added another layer of a caress to his skin, and Sherlock was surprised to feel a pulsing in his lower region. His body responded so readily to John’s touch.
John watched brokenly as the omega staggered away, down a hall, before closing his bedroom door. Collasping back onto the couch, John bowed his head, fisted his hair and leaned over his knees. Trying to catch his breath, to right his shredding heart, and unable to do any of it.
It was later that evening when Mrs. Hudson came with dinner made and waiting for him in the kitchen. She knew better than to enter the room where John dwelled. An omega wasn’t territorial with most things, but they were most certainly territorial with their pups and with their alpha’s—John… had no alpha, but he still had their den and that was off limits.
Another growl rumbled deep against John’s chest, vibrating strong enough to strum through his whole body, but this one came from Sherlock. John’s brain was a fog of phenlethylamine, norepinephrine and dopamine, but he knew it was a growl of warning, only, John couldn’t pull away. Not now. Sherlock smelled so sweet, inviting.
Sherlock’s breathing intensified and John worried Sherlock was close to full-blown hyperventilating. Sherlock looked away again to press his fingertips to his temples, and groaned in anguish.
“John… What’s going on with you? One minute you’re okay, the next you’re sobbing in my arms, after you’re nice, and now… now you’re detached. Please, John, tell me what you’re thinking, because although I’m highly observant, I’m not a mind reader. I want to comfort you, I know something is bothering you, but for the life of me I can’t understand
“Blood.” Sherlock addressed Mycroft one last time before leaving the room, finally able to be where he’d wanted to be for so long - with his John.
Sherlock wasn’t a cruel, evil alpha. John knew this with certainty now. Sherlock wasn’t like what those betas said alphas were. Sherlock was just so… Sighing softly, smile broadening, John bashfully ducked his head. He couldn’t seem to remove the smile nor the fluttering in his stomach. He might just be a little insane.
“You know that’s against the rules, your omega hasn’t reached adulthood yet.” Mycroft simpered, seeming overly amused.
John didn’t interrupt; though a part of him wanted to chastise Sherlock for being so… ill-mannered to someone that was being genuinely nice. However, Victor said he was Sherlock’s friend, but from what Sherlock was projecting — they weren’t exactly friends, or maybe that was how his mate felt. Sherlock did have the tendency to bite off the heads of kind, well-meaning people… for example: people like… John.
John started working at the hospital as an intern and his days were spent interacting with patients and home alone, in solitude. John was lonely. He lived his days outside of work in stillness and longing for excitement.
Time… Everyone said all John would need was time and things would get better… easier. It didn’t. John struggled to maintain his weight, losing more than was healthy. The doctors Mycroft sent him to weekly were never pleased with his efforts - apparently they weren’t good enough. John hardly slept at night, he’d be lucky to have four hours of undisturbed sleep. Maybe it would have been easier if he hadn’t been there… hadn’t seen it with his own eyes. But he was and he did. Because of it he had nightmares, almost daily, and that horrifying sight would forever haunt him. Time… Time would not heal these wounds.
"Sherlock." John shakily spoke, his body tensing. Sherlock could hear when John gripped to the bed sheets, his eyes going weird- strange as he looked at Sherlock in a way he hadn't before. Sherlock wasn't sure what that look meant. His bottom lip disappeared under his teeth as he bit it and looked at Sherlock as if he should know what that meant, and Sherlock seriously wasn't sure what to do.
The last of the voices cooed sweetly as Sherlock readied himself and left the flat in search of a developing crime scene.
Sherlock's thrashing stopped in that moment, because the sharp heat of fangs pressed on his gland. Soft at first, but then steadily gaining in pressure, until the pointed fangs tore through skin, muscle, and burst the gland within. Alpha pheromones and hormones seeping within, mixing with Sherlock's own. Sherlock didn't have to smell the alpha to feel the moment the biological reaction was taking place. He could feel the very instant it happened; his muscles relaxed further, his head spun - fogging, and his heart rate increased.
“Sleep, son. You need your rest.” Mr. Watson added, wrapping an arm around Mrs. Watson as they left John’s room.
Sherlock raised his head up, dropped his hand to lie on the armrest and inhaled another breath. Still, there was no talking.
.” John would whisper, cradling Sherlock’s face in his hands and kissing him tenderly on his lips as they held each other, Sherlock spurting out load after load, knot sealing them together.
Sherlock pressed his lips to John’s lips and spoke, tickling him as he did, “Okay. I’m sure I can surmise what it is.”
Rocking up and down John's tightly constricting fist, Sherlock lunged forward and captured his husband's mouth in his own and whimpered when John pulled away seconds after the connection.
Sherlock laughed bitterly, recollecting that particular line in William Shakespeare's most beloved play, Romeo and Juliet. When first reading the play, he never could quite understand the pain Romeo experienced, though now, it was all too clear. Only where Romeo’s Juliet loved him, his John would never love him. Sherlock was the thing John despised most, an alpha.
“Good God.” John groaned, curling inward, hugging his pillow and rubbing his face against the comforting cushion. Sherlock’s arms tight around his waist, lanky form pressing against his back.
It was their third and last day now and come morning they’d be heading back to the city. Sherlock looked rather exhausted by the time they made it back to the inn that evening. John couldn’t really blame him. John foolishly had taken a right instead of a left in the forest and they’d lost their way back. Thankfully, Sherlock and his impeccable deducing abilities were able to help them find their way back, but by then they’d walked far more than intended.
“Mental is strictly reserved for you.” John murmured lovingly. Sighing happily, John palmed the hand Sherlock used to stroke his cheek.
Sherlock nosed his way along John’s cheek, moving closer to John’s nose and nuzzled him, before salty lips brushed against salty lips.
." John cursed, and hurriedly dragged his hand lower and tugged the panties lining Sherlock's entrance to one ass cheek.
“Hamish!” John snarled loudly, causing the two to stare back at him startled into awareness that he was there. “John Hamish Watson, just if you're looking for baby names.” John grumbled, his heart hurt because even as he lay out his joke, he knew it was a possibility. Not that they would name a child after him, but that Sherlock could very well take Irene as his second and Irene would be able to offer Sherlock many children. John’s knuckles crackled as he clenched his fists and glared at the floor.
“You... John Hamish Watson, my sweetly naive John, are so entertaining.” Sherlock chuckled kindly, sliding his hand away from John’s to palm his cheek instead.
“If it’s not too much trouble.” Mycroft’s eyes softened, knowing, though John never admitted it aloud, he loved Sherlock and was prepared to go through hell and back keeping Sherlock safe.
“Come on Sherlock. Open up! There’s been a triple homicide in broad daylight with no witnesses. You’re needed.” D.I. Lestrade shouted from behind the door.
Two weeks came and went and during that time, John couldn’t understand why, but his thoughts continuously and frustratingly drifted towards Sherlock. The pained look of those eyes that had stared at him with such want and need, and the memories of each time he shot the alpha down, pushed him away, heartlessly.
“That won’t be needed. I can do so on my own.” Sherlock cut in, because there was no way he’d allow John to touch him (removing his clothes) and allow him to see Sherlock in a way none, but his mother during his infancy had.
"You don't love him, John, right? This marriage it has only ever been an agreement made with Sherlock's brother to save your sister's life." Victor spoke desperately and John finally understood why Victor looked at him like that. Victor had hope that John might not love Sherlock and might actually have feelings for him.
John merely sent him a devilish smile and instead of kissing him, he set about devouring his small cock, taking the small thing effortlessly in his wet hot mouth and set about suckling it. Loving it in the way he wouldn't love his mouth and Sherlock whined, wanting John to continue and yet wishing his alpha would kiss him. Sherlock's imaginations wouldn't even bless him with the blessing of a kiss.
“…human being that I have ever known and no one will ever convince me that you told me a lie. And so… there... I was so alone and I owe you so much.”
He understood that Harry couldn’t stay for too long. The scent was setting her alpha instincts to mate and if she didn’t find her mate soon, she’d become feral. It was dangerous for an alpha to be this close to an omega in heat. They could lose themselves to their animal side.
"Sherlock?" John questioned, now with less curiosity and more worry when Sherlock had yet to respond.
Damp moss, rosewood, and hazelnut — who would have thought he’d have such a head rush from just one whiff of his omega.
John's face hardened, eyes warning Sherlock that this was not going to end well if the omega was only going to rehash what they'd already addressed.
“Don’t cry Johnny boy, I know you’re lonely. Just promise me you will register and find an omega that loves you.”
Sherlock was losing his mind with annoyance because everything was changing. His transport was broken. He was hungry and he'd just eaten three whole meals the day before. He should be fueled up and ready to work, but no. Instead Sherlock found himself drifting away to thoughts of food and that wasn't acceptable. Not when he stood at a crime scene trying to absorb all the information around him. Sherlock refused to be distracted by his nagging hunger and took in the scene around him, focused on remembering every detail of the crime scene.
Sherlock shook his head, trying to focus, trying to ignore his omega instincts that begged him to submit, to lower himself on all fours and raise his hips up in invitation. Sherlock would be damned if he allowed his omega side out—
John winced knowing no one could force Sherlock into doing something he didn’t want to, especially Mycroft. This wasn’t going to end well.
An omega drop was a serious matter. When an omega was in distress, when an omega was at their weakest, they’d experience a drop—a state of delirium, violence, and if they didn’t seek help immediately they’d die. These drops were usually after experiencing trauma or the death of their mate.
"I... I... I...." John gasped, trying to pull the words from his breaking heart, but something was stopping him.
“I… John… I… You…” Sherlock put great efforts to voice his thoughts, brows furrowed, breathing heavily, unable to catch his breath when speaking about such a topic.  It was so unlike Sherlock to splutter to such an extent, and it pained John. That beta must have meant the world to Sherlock if he couldn’t even bring about the words to talk about them.
“Why don’t you tell me about your first night being wed?” Mycroft suggested, sensing John’s dilemma.
John finished his tea first, smiled up at the silently brooding Sherlock, stood from his chair, set his mug in the sink and rounded the table to stand beside Sherlock.
Raising his head and staring at his reflection in the bathroom mirror, John sucked in his bottom lip and nibbled at it nervously.
John belted out a scream of horror as his heart stuttered in its beating, before pounding harshly alone and John knew Sherlock was gone. He couldn't feel his presence at all. Not even faintly.
"I'm so sorry. Sherlock." John's voice trembled, fearfully watching the omega change his clothes, worried he'd fucked everything up for them. That because of him he'd lose the man he loved.
There was a liberal amount of purely white precum glazing over the head of Sherlock’s cock and John very much wanted to taste. Never had John done so, and it was a rather strange thing that he had yet to taste his husband. One of the many sexual acts an omega was to partake in was the tasting of their alpha, but John had always felt reserved in this matter. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to do it, but that… he’d never felt confident enough to.
They lay together for long moments in time. Sherlock pet John’s hair dotingly, another hand tenderly caressed his back. John draped himself over Sherlock, catching his breath, pressing gentle kisses across the span of his chest.
John warily stared up at the door and exhaled a trembling breath. Palming his face, feeling absolutely powerless, John focused on listening on the alpha. He could hear the alpha shuffling, changing back into his clothes, and then the harsh panting breaths as the alpha paced the hall outside of the restroom.
John wanted to have omega pups. The more the merrier. Sherlock wanted alpha submissives. He hadn't said why, but John believed it was due to the rarity. They most probably would have at least one or two alpha submissives, because alpha submissives were known to sire them. Sherlock most likely wanted to prove or disprove such statistics, since there wasn't a lot of research done on alpha submissives. John should be offended that Sherlock wanted to test such theories out on him and their pups, but he could only laugh happily.
Sherlock graced John with a faint smile, his own face feeling warm and matching the shade of John's.
“Don’t tell me you never noticed. I’ve always been rather fond of you. I’m single and I don’t have to hold back anymore.”
Patting John’s knee compassionately, voicelessly seeking forgiveness, Mrs. Holmes remorsefully questioned, “Have you never wondered why Mycroft is unbound?”
“John.” Sherlock pleaded earnestly, eyeing their means of escape, the limousine, with such reverence.
“Oh.” Sherlock huffed heavily, swiping the towel across his nose, nuzzling the fabric as if it were his omega’s scent gland.
John went to visit his sister after the surgery, barely remembering to remove his wedding ring before stepping into her room. She’d thanked him, knowing that because of him she was alive. Harry thought John managed to convince the hospital to give her the liver because he had some old friends he’d called in a favor with. John allowed her to believe such. She didn’t have to learn the truth. Harry would hate herself for having John give up his only chance of happiness to ensure her life. John feared if Harry found out she’d go into a state of depression and, God forbid, start drinking again. John would introduce her to Sherlock someday, maybe. Thinking about it brought too many questions. How could he introduce Sherlock without revealing their marriage and reasons for it?
John raised his gaze to meet Sherlock's with one of amazement and seeing the question in silver blue, the alpha explained. "It's open. Since I took you that first time... I can see you aren't..."
A scent woke John the next time, a pungent variation of herbal tea, sweet and freshly baked biscuits, the crispness of mint, and something else, something musky and bitter, bitterly engaging. These scents brought John back to awareness, woke him from the restlessness of a feverish rest. These scents made his omega tremble with want and reprieve.
.” John sighed warmly, pressing his nose against Sherlock’s scent gland and inhaled deeply, “Yes, of course.”
Sherlock shook his head, unable to bear John’s words, and defiantly took both of John’s hands in his own.
“Yes.” John forced, stare hardening, challengingly. “What’s wrong with that? If it wasn’t for Lestrade you would have most likely not said anything.”
John held him close, so close Sherlock could hear the frantic pounding of his alpha's heart. It was both soothing and surprising.
John explained his reasoning, “You chose me to be with Sherlock because I was to birth him many children, now that I am unable to… you will need to find him a second.”
"Yes, I know. Your guilt is your weakness, which my brother has used more than once and this time he's done so horrendously. I've spoken with him, rather threatened him, so you don't need to worry about him requesting to make another video. As for the one that is being viewed on the web - that one is rather painful to grab a hold on. It will take some time, but it will be erased from the web."
. Seated within his childhood home, in a hideously decorated room of bright pinks and yellows, with far more balloons and glitter than a gay pride parade. If Sherlock sneezed, it would undoubtedly be confetti.
After their rather lengthy phone chat, John seated himself on his bed, pressed his hands to his knees and stared at the wall across him, accepting what he’d agreed to. He would have dinner with the Holmeses the next night, he would meet his intended bond mate (a man he was to lie to), and the day after that he’d marry him. It was all happening so fast, but John reminded himself why he was doing this. Harry. After he married Sherlock, Mycroft would pursue finding Harry a liver and save her life. For Harry’s life he could… would do this.
Possessiveness. John pinpointed it in a second, but where he once felt annoyance, he now felt comfort and wasn’t that just the sickest of thoughts.
"John, I'm not.... I could never replace him, but... but if you'll have me... I could give you all the care and love an omega could ever-"
John glared at Mycroft’s back as he left. When he disappeared beyond the entryway, John set his sights back on Sherlock and his features softened immediately.
Sherlock watched wrathfully as Moriarty turned his back on him and spoke on the phone, and exited the room, “So if you have what you say you have, I'll make you rich. If you don't, I'll make you into shoes.”
John watched the alpha move, so kindly making room for his things and felt warmth run deep through him as a soft smile spread across his face.
John stepped towards Sherlock until he stood a mere foot away, and stared up at him intensely as Sherlock assisted in removing his jumper and unbuttoning his shirt. While Sherlock unbuttoned his shirt, John unclasped his belt and undid his trousers. Spanning his arms out, Sherlock tugged John's shirt completely off before he toed his shoes off and stepped out of his jeans.
One year and Gregory hadn't stopped visiting. Nor did the phone calls cease, regardless of Mycroft ignoring each call. Normally, his agents turned down the D.I., knowing Mycroft didn't want to see him, and only relayed which days he'd come by. This new agent was not familiar with protocol.
John didn't agree. Sherlock was warped if he thought Mycroft was what he’d needed. What he’d needed was to know his husband wasn't dead. What he’d needed was to never have seen Sherlock jump in the first place and most certainly never to have seen his lifeless bloodied body.
The agony that filled Sherlock’s eyes the second after John spoke his desire… John never saw that coming. Sherlock shot out of his seat instantly and began pacing the floor.
“No, but I knew you were kind and… I purposefully was cruel because I wanted you to hurt like I was.”
John stayed in his room for several more hours after his heat, unable to move, weakened for lack of nourishment and debilitating shame. Sherlock, even after rejecting him, cared enough to bring him food—food which he’d refused, but still… Sherlock cared for his health and though it hurt, knowing the care was in the form of pity, John couldn’t stop himself from feeling warmth in his heart for it. Yet, still… It hurt… It hurt to have gained Sherlock’s care out of pity and still hold no place in his heart.
"Just penetrate me and get it over with." Sherlock's words wavered. He was trying to remain strong, clinical in their approach to this area of their marriage. John knew Sherlock well enough to know this wasn't just sex. This was a vulnerability the omega had never shared with another, and in many ways, John felt similarly. Even though John was uneasy with this new development, he wanted it, and he'd be sure Sherlock knew he'd take care of him.
Mrs. Hudson couldn’t ignore his cries and entered the room, finding John balled up in the sheets, fisting at his hair and screaming
Sherlock didn’t come in that morning or afternoon. John made his meals and ate them by himself, the empty house was eerily silent and John felt absolutely alone.
"End of Baker Street, there's a good Chinese, stays open till two. You can always tell a good Chinese by examining the bottom third of the door handle." Sherlock explained exactly as to how as they continued their path.
“He looks ancient. I can’t be seen to be wandering around with an old man.” Sherlock began pacing the room, contemplating how to reveal himself to his omega. “I think I’ll surprise John. He’ll be delighted.”
“I don’t know. I didn’t talk to him much, but…he wasn’t unpleasant.” John frowned, reluctantly admitting the last.
Lestrade tried to stop them - sometimes it worked, other times it only spurred them on the second Lestrade turned his back. John told him it was alright, that it didn't bother him, and Lestrade, wanting to believe him, took him for his word.
“Oh, God, John, I want this too!” Sherlock husked, mouthing John’s bond bite. John ridding him of any lingering doubt or hesitation lowered a hand to grab a hold of his cock and guided the head to John’s hole.
Shutting off the shower, Sherlock exited the bathroom and quickly dressed himself in a pair of comfortable gray pyjama slacks and a white t-shirt. He hardly had the energy to tend to his wounds, but he knew he should do that now.
The alpha wrapped an arm around his shoulders and leaned in to nuzzle his burning ear. "Sherlock." John murmured hotly and Sherlock's eyes squeezed shut as he worked on calming his breathing, because this was too much to handle.
The two sat facing each other, but Sherlock refused to be the first to take steps with scenting. Sighing heavily, John pressed his back into the cushion of the couch and reached out for the omega.
Torture, he'd become accustomed to. If it got to be too much he only need enter his mind palace to escape it. But none were as devastating as this. Sherlock could not escape this pain within the security of his mind palace, because John lingered there, he inhabited so much space within his mind, and was there to greet him during his escapes.
John found the will to tug his hand from under Sherlock’s. Sherlock frowned at the action, leaned back and away, but continued speaking.
John watched mutely as Sherlock exited the bathroom. John’s tea grew cold as he sat there dumbfounded, holding his tea while his toes became prune-like.
"Uh... Okay... Right." John raised his eyes back up to meet Sherlock's own and gave a jerky nod. "I'll just... I'll start doing that."
“Look at the jumper he’s wearing. Hardly worn. Clearly he’s uncomfortable in it. Maybe it’s because of the material; more likely the hideous pattern, suggesting it’s a present, probably Christmas. So he wants into his mother’s good books. Why? Almost certainly money.”
Sherlock had read the statistics on couples who did such things it bed, and apparently it was highly preformed. There had even been testimonials on how much alpha's liked to watch their omega's soil their underwear while being pleasured, and Sherlock wanted to please John.
“Such a beautiful alpha.” John hummed happily, sliding his hands out of Sherlock’s grasp and palming the sides of Sherlock's jaw, staring directly into pale blue eyes.
“You once said we didn’t need Mycroft as our mediator, that if I wanted something, I only need ask you.” John recalled.
, I have claimed you as my mate. I meant it when I said I would cherish you.” Sherlock’s words sounded close… Too close.
Sherlock continued his tirade of insults and the words dulled out, because all John could hear, feel, was the pulsing of his heart. It thrummed through him. Pulsed harshly along his neck and throbbed painfully at his temples. His eyes were shut again because he couldn't look at Sherlock right now.
John's mouth watered with the he scent of Sherlock's yeasty sweetness. He could practically taste him. It was so much and they hadn't even gotten that far. Biting the inside of his cheek, John focused on anything but the feel of it. He needed to last, long enough to give Sherlock as much pleasure.
John's hands wasted no time when he took hold of Sherlock's belt. Only did those confident hands halt their progression when Sherlock's gripped his wrists. John pulled back enough so to meet Sherlock's stare and soon noticed the open shame that blossomed upon his omega's features.
When Mrs. Holmes stood in front of him, she hurriedly yanked him against her and gave him a warm welcoming hug. John let out a noise of surprise and awkwardly patted the woman’s back, though never fully hugging her in return. It was so foreign, having someone touch him like this, and yet… it was nice. It reminded him of the hugs he’d shared with his mother. Glancing up the steps to the open door, John was met by the sight of an elderly man, smiling kindly at him and beside him was a smirking Mycroft.
John swallowed dryly, suddenly unbelievably parched. Unable to fully comprehend what had happened to his Sherlock. Of course he understood Sherlock was an exceptional actor, but that he could so easily play the kind loving mate who could so effortlessly place affection onto him... It was all so much for John to compute.
"Hurt me? You've more than hurt me, John. Don't you realize how I feel about you? I... You've broken my heart!" Victor's words shook on the edge of agony and John's heart swelled painfully, because he'd hoped it wasn't this. He knew Victor fancied him, but he'd thought... He'd thought that as their friendship had developed it had softened those feelings of Victor's heart to nought.
Sherlock smiled weakly and John knew it then. This was far more than Sherlock was comfortable with, too much would overwhelm him. John shut his eyes and nodded in conformance. Sherlock wasn’t ready for what all of this would mean, but from what Sherlock had already confessed to, he’d come far. John could wait. He could be patient for Sherlock and when he was ready, Sherlock would make it known.
“Look across the street. Taxi.” Sherlock broke the silence and reminded John what their purpose was.
All at once John went still, mid-thrust, a sharp and shaking grunt breaking free before he was pounding into Sherlock,
“I… do.” John whispered, softly, brokenly, dejectedly, sentencing himself to damnation, the rest of his life would be spent with a complete stranger who he had no wish of knowing or being close with. He was marrying an alpha that would use him, sold to the highest bidder by his own family. John was still unable to meet his intended’s—Sherlock’s, gaze all while he spoke his affirmation.
John pressed his full weight against Sherlock and for the moment Sherlock’s heat abated enough so that he could soothe his husband. Sherlock raised a hand to stroke John’s head of hair, while his other ran the expanse of his back.
“Sorry boys! I'm soooo changeable! It is a weakness with me. But to be fair to myself, it is my only weakness. You can't be allowed to continue.
John wanted to spend his nights off with Sherlock, but when John looked at Sherlock he remembered The Woman and drew back. Instead, John would mutter how he was going out with Lestrade. The DI was a rather nice man, and John felt comfortable in his presence. It was strange John felt such since Lestrade was an alpha, but, as he’d learned from Sherlock, not all alphas were bad. Most times they went out to a bar and drank, participated in bar trivia, and they always had a great time together. Still, there were times when Lestrade good-naturedly wrapped an arm around John, sat close, or when they went to Lestrade’s place that the omega within would feel unease. The omega within warning him of the dangers of being so close to an alpha other than his bond mate, but John shrugged those worries aside, because Lestrade was a friend. John trusted Lestrade.
Glancing down at his stomach, Sherlock palmed it. It wasn't so large, but the taunt muscles that had once been there were less prominent. His stomach was softer and stuck out just slightly. He could still fit into his clothes, so he wasn't over indulging, it was perfectly fine if he wanted to feed his cravings.
John stared hard at the roses, yet he was still unable to take in people standing at the center end of the altar, and although everything in him was telling him not to look. Knowing that if he looked he’d finally have to face the truth, face his future, his tormenting sentence in an unwanted marriage. Knowing all of this could not stop him, and he lowered his gaze. A priest with graying hair, sunken sad eyes and large glasses stood on a podium holding to his chest a silver bible that glistened even from where John stood. The priest looked annoyed, impatient and John could understand why. The wedding was supposed to have started thirty minutes ago, but John had spent that time fighting his mother tooth and nail on wearing his tuxedo.
John’s vision blurred as his fever rose, panting heavily. John focused on remaining aware of his surroundings, but his eyes were growing heavy. His body quaked, abdomen convulsing with painful cramps. Slick poured out in a never ending supply from his anus and John sobbed harder, hiccupping keen whines.
"Shhh. I have you." The alpha spoke and only then did Sherlock realize that the agents who'd been holding him, had released him, and that he now lay cradled in the alpha's lap. One of the alpha's strong arms was wrapped around his waist, the other he used to stroke away the omega's silent tears.
John moaned, digging his hand under the waistband of his pants, gripped his throbbing cock and gave one hard desperate squeeze, imaging it was the phantom touch of his illusive intended and came so hard his teeth chattered as spunk coated his hand.
John didn't see his life as a child, his time in the army, or anything else but of Sherlock. Every one of the many memories flashing before his eyes were of Sherlock. Pained eyes staring at him in misery as John refused to love Sherlock, show kindness or any form of affection. All the times John refused Sherlock. All the times John pushed Sherlock away. All the times Sherlock pleaded with him and he chose not to hear reason. Regret filled his heart.
Sucking in a sharp breath as John tugged his pants and slacks down and off. Leaving him only in black dressing socks. Sherlock braced himself for John's scrutiny.
John's face softened with love and Sherlock found himself helpless at the sight of it. Needing to be near his mate, Sherlock stepped over to the three members of his growing family and raised out a hand to cup his husband's cheek in his hand.
Sherlock huffed impatiently and snatched it from the other man. Slinking back into his seat, throwing his legs over one side of the chair’s handle while pressing his back against the other side, Sherlock flipped it open and read it.
John choked on spit, blanching up at the awaiting Sherlock who starred on with eagerness, a twinkle in his eyes. John had been so preoccupied with preparing their dinner he hadn’t scented the alpha’s arousal until that very moment.
Nuzzling the warm flesh, scenting the alpha's scent gland, being overwhelmed in the scent of his mate, John crumbled. Holding himself as tightly as Sherlock held him, he slipped from his chair to the floor. Sherlock followed him down. Beyond the heart wrenching sobs, John could hear the words Sherlock spoke into his ear.
John didn’t understand when or why, but he enjoyed the alpha’s scent; it was comforting and filled him with tranquility. John’s fingers twitched in Sherlock’s hold when a thumb caressed his knuckles, but even so, he remained quiet.
“Are you complaining?” John grumbled unhappily, put off by the idea that he took more enjoyment at their closeness than Sherlock.
“It means that I want something with you.” Sherlock confessed and John never would have expected that.
John's brows rose, eyes widening with surprise, but then they turned dark with lust and a feral growl rumbled from deep within the alpha's chest.
John let out an abrupt broken whine, and without delay covered it with a forced cough before standing up and turning away from Sherlock.
Sherlock began sobbing, unbidden, tears smearing across his flushed face as the pungent scent cloyed the room. John bit his bottom lip and whined when he remembered what that scent was.
Mycroft noticed the growing tension between them, mostly from John’s side and asked to speak with John privately. John didn’t want to talk with Mycroft, but when that blasted ring tone
Sherlock arched painfully against the bed, his left leg swinging out beyond his control with every pound of those solid strong hips of John's. An incoherent noise escaped his lungs, as his body fell to chaos, a swarm of sensations destroying him from the inside, setting his loins to burn with a near explosion.
“Sex education is more about how the human anatomy works and responds, whereas being educated as a general surgeon gave you little to no education on the dynamics of heat cycles between an alpha and omega. The very least you learned was the psychology and anatomy of each, just slightly more in depth than middle school sex education.” Mycroft concluded, the twinkle in his eyes a clear sign he was enjoying John’s discomfort.
Schooling his features, attempting to refrain from lunging at John and claiming those wonderful full lips, Sherlock asked, “Dinner?”
John was worried. Mycroft was worried. Hell, even Lestrade was worried. Sherlock was lashing out. John was trying to help. He scented Sherlock more. His pheromones were constantly filling the rooms they were in. Especially now that Moriarty had begun his sick game, using people's lives as sport.
"I am!" Sherlock cried out with annoyance, because no matter how John liked to sugarcoat it, he was in fact an
Everything happened so fast. Witnesses stood and clapped for the couple. His alpha and the best man standing at his side moved down the steps of the altar and swiftly left. John should have followed, but he didn’t. Instead, John staggered over to his mother who quickly embraced him.
Sherlock was still three feet away from him, but John grew nervous with how intensely the alpha stared at him and spun around. Without another word, John led the way. Sherlock followed after him, always remaining three steps behind him. The silence was killing John, though his focus was on trying to find his way out of the maze and part of him couldn’t tolerate the quiet.
“Mm.” Mycroft hummed feigning thoughtfulness, but his eyes said something else, something more threatening.
After such a long day at work, John had come home and made them a large dinner. Sherlock had been in the mood for lasagna. Not just any lasagna, but John's vegetarian lasagna he'd learned from his mother as a boy. John couldn't say no to Sherlock, not for anything and even though it meant he'd have to stop by the market to fetch a few ingredients to make it, he would, and did.
“Eat, Sherlock. Then you can go back to bed.” John palmed Sherlock’s warm cheek, stroking it fondly with his thumb.
Three cups of coffee later, Mycroft was initiating a kiss that turned passionate under Gregory's influence. After which point, Mycroft whispered against his reddening lips he was ready. That was all Gregory had been waiting to hear and his wolf howled with triumph, before he was hurriedly helping Mycroft rise from the sofa and leading him to his bedroom.
John and Sarah went out for lunch sometimes and John enjoyed their conversations. Sarah was a sweet woman and John did hope that one day she would find someone to fill the emptiness in her heart, but that could never be him.
John felt near passing out and when a doctor rolled Sherlock’s body over onto his back, John knew there was no saving what was already lost. He stared down into the lifeless eyes of Sherlock’s—so pure in their shade of blue, demonstrating the intensity of lightning and John felt a stab at his heart, because they were absent of comprehension.
” John groaned, when another spasm rocked through him more prominent than the first, painful now, piercing his lower regions with want.
When Sherlock entered the room, falling to his knees before him; an alpha overcome by their omega’s welcomingly enticing scent and began nosing his ear with care, kind hands dotingly laying affectionate touches on him, John wept. Tears dampened John’s momentarily dry face at hearing the heart-wrenching whine of his alpha.
Sherlock leaned across the table, piercing blue staring intensely at him; a hand daringly reached out and took hold of John’s, holding on firmly.
John didn't lie. He wasn't with his beta wife, or some sexual miscreant in a seedy motel. He was in a Mexican restaurant with festive cultural decorations. Loud, upbeat music filled the room along with joyous chatter.
Sherlock spurted another load within, keening and filling John up. Jolting pulses of come filled him up to the brink, and fertilizing more of his eggs.
The moment he entered their room he knew something was wrong. Sherlock’s face was ashen white, eyes wide open and wild as he frantically shuffled through the dresser drawer.
Sherlock hissed, squirming restlessly in the aftershocks of his climax, John's hips remaining solid pistons, pumping into Sherlock and electrifying his pleasure point to pain. It was discomforting and highly unwanted, but Sherlock endured it because they weren't finished, he needed John to come. He needed to be filled and so he spread his legs open farther apart.
“I love you, John.” Sherlock murmured, chin resting above his head, and stroked his back affectionately.
John's mind felt clouded, his heart full, and though he felt Sherlock go rigid against him, his alpha merely breathed out a contented rumble.
"Did you two talk about me?" Sherlock sneered, moving to the side of the living room and dragged the heavy leather chair near where the alpha stood.
God, this wasn’t what Mycroft had wanted, he’d come for John, but now Lestrade was here, pushing and annoying him to no end and all Mycroft wanted to do was curse the man to hell. Not gentleman-like, vulgar and average in behaviorism— and all so detestable.
“I know.” John cooed, raising up to press a chaste kiss on his lips and waited for Sherlock to meet his gaze.
Silver depths broke away from dark blue and focused on the kitchen table. Leaning forward, John nosed along the damp curls of Sherlock's hair and scented the omega with reverence.
Sherlock never considered John would reject him. He had wanted John for so long, fallen for him over the years of secretly spying on him. He should have known better. How could John fall for him so quickly, knowing next to nothing about him? Sherlock had thought… expected that once John realized he would care for him, John would love him in return. He’d been a fool for thinking it possible.
Sherlock inhaled a sharp breath as John bent low and smooth lips met the bridge of his right foot. Kiss after gentle kiss was laid there, until John had kissed every part of that foot and then he was moving to the next one. Laying on just as much affection as he had  with the first.
“They want me to produce kin. It’s unfair, but I’m an omega, bound. I could only run, but that would leave mum and dad open to a lawsuit.”
“Thank you, for your concern, but that is hardly necessary. I did take sex education in middle school and as you know, I am a doctor, so the lessons are unneeded.”
"Good. Come on me." John crooned, moaning the moment Sherlock's entrance gave way to spilling more clear slick.
Glaring at the ceiling, Sherlock inhaled a deep breath, held it for several long beats, before exhaling it heavily.
, there would have been a possibility that I might have been able to persuade Sherlock on holding back. It is far easier to control a young alpha than it is a fully grown and matured one.”
“You have a police force of sorts, even a marginally Secret Service. Why come to me?” Sherlock rationalized, obviously still not fully committed to taking on this case.
He was wet everywhere. His thighs slipped against each other, skin damp. His cock was hard, the slit open and dripping with pre-come. Sherlock's entrance, hot and feeling empty, wanted to be filled. John's cock was fat and long, it filled Sherlock perfectly and made him feel so complete. Sherlock needed John.
“Ignore it. He has a flare for the dramatic.” Mycroft drawled; a bored expression was his answer to John’s alarm.
Only… When John arrived a trembling mess, evidence of having cried and began sobbing uncontrollably, Sherlock couldn’t ignore it. Even if John ended up rejecting his comfort, he wouldn’t stop trying. He’d never thought John would clutch to him desperately and accept his comfort so willingly.
"Stop it!" Victor screamed, horrified by the beginnings of John's rejection, a trembling hand running through his hair and fisting painfully in his soft locks, pure sorrow creasing his features.
Sherlock released a threatening growl before he pulled back, spun on his heel and stormed out of the home.
No. John was happy again. Truly happy. He had a family he loved more than his own life, so Sherlock couldn't think about the past.
One particular night, Sherlock couldn’t seem to hold his rage any longer and began insulting John’s intelligence and cursing at him to show some alpha dominance after they’d finished a case.
"Please." Sherlock whispered brokenly, lowering where he stood to kneel on the hard ground, and dug his claws into his scalp.
John dreamt all night, soothing dreams of a man with enticing blue eyes that were ever changing and a smile that was ever contestant, and when he moaned out the man’s name in the stillness of the room, he was none the wiser, but the alpha lying awake next to him… was.
"I need this. It makes everything harder for me to talk to you. To act as if I'm just on holiday, when we both know I'm not. I... I can't. It hurts too much."
Victor's other hand moved to palm the other side of John's face, and cradling his head, he stared up at him with a silent plea to accept this. John swallowed thickly, beyond the fear of Victor's realization about why he married Sherlock, he felt sorrow for the omega. Desperate to find love and always choosing the wrong alpha.
- made it worse. His heart hurt. He felt small and insufficient. Undesired. Sherlock's stomach roiled sickeningly, his chest ached painfully, and feeling anger wind deep within himself, he shoved the alpha away from himself and angrily rose to his feet.
“I just… Goodbye, Sherlock.” John whispered and Sherlock’s eyes narrowed, sea green turning analytical, sensing something was truly off with John.
Sherlock’s eyes softened and after a moment of Sherlock briefly breaking their eye contact to stare at their interlaced hands he stared back up at John and smiled.
There was more, but Sherlock couldn't remember it. The pain of contractions was coming quickly and it was all he could think about now.
“Mm.” John hummed his reply, unable to speak; worried his voice would shake and shut his eyes, trying to find sleep.
“I made vows that I will keep.” Sherlock murmured; nuzzling the omega’s neck and John wasn’t fighting him anymore. He didn’t have the heart to.
“You know why he’s here? He’s not paid or anything. He likes it. He gets off on it. The weirder the crime, the more he gets off. And you know what? One day just showing up won’t be enough. One day we’ll be standing round a body and Sherlock Holmes will be the one that put it there.”
He’d greet Sherlock then, the genius would usually be looking through his microscope, jotting notes down, reading, playing the violin, or whatever else with a firm squeeze of the shoulder, a mumble of, ‘good morning’, then prepared them breakfast.
With his grip on Sherlock’s shoulders, John shoved the taller man against the kitchen table, the legs of the table screeching as it was pushed back several inches. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders as Sherlock hunched awkwardly, head bending low to sustain the kiss. John raised himself up, arms closing around Sherlock, hands gripping tight as he attempted to climb up the tree that was Sherlock, odd an angle as it was, it didn’t seem to detour his attempts.
"Please." John pleaded, releasing Sherlock's face to instead wrap his arms around him and bring him in close.
John didn't wait long, less than a handful of minutes, before the door opened and in walked Mycroft Holmes. The older Holmes greeted him politely as any gentleman would, offering to have his secretary bring him something to drink, but John declined.
John released a pitiful throaty keen when Sherlock laid a hand over his belly and stroked the skin that was there. He shouldn’t have responded so eagerly towards a rather basic touch, but John held so many memories of Sherlock stroking at his stomach when scenting, tenderly caressing it while their pups had grown, and laying loving kisses there, that John felt so much at the touch.
“He comes from an exceptional family. They all hold position within the government. Rather wealthy family too. They come from old money. You’ll never want for anything, son. They will care for you most eagerly, for you are an omega. Don’t forget to be proud of that son!” His father cheered with a wide grin on his face.
John said nothing, feeling no need to mention the slight tremble of Sherlock’s hands the moment he’d realized John was there and the time was upon them. Instead, John seated himself beside Sherlock and smiled up at him. The two stared at one another as the moments ticked by.
"Do it! Or else I'll keep saying naughty things, such as: Your fingers feel rough, scratching across my most sacred of places. If you go too deep you'll feel my womb and where our children- Mm!" Sherlock smiled triumphantly when John's lips sealed over his own and turned his neck enough to meet John's halfway.
John watched as the three members of his family left him to seat themselves in preparation for the wedding mere moments from the beginning. Harry paused to give him a look of sympathy. Harry was an alpha, she didn’t understand. She would never understand what it was like to be an omega. To be controlled by tradition, bought and sold for the purpose of breeding.
John glanced up from his book when he heard shuffling as Sherlock re-emerged from his bedroom, face wet with sweat and wearing a white sheet wrapped around his body. Revealing one bare shoulder, arm, and one lean leg.
John had hoped they’d spend their New Years Eve like they’d spent their Christmas, in their flat, alone in each other’s company. They hadn’t exchanged gifts, but John prepared them a nice steak salad, decorated the flat, giving it a Christmassy feel, and Sherlock played several festive pieces on his violin. They’d spent the later part of that evening sitting side by side on the couch watching, ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’.
Mycroft's eyes twinkled suspiciously and Sherlock realized it was already too late. A furious outcry of rage burst forth and Sherlock lurched forward, arms reaching out for the arrogant sod. But before he could move further than the edge of the desk, two pairs of hands hardened their hold and roughly slammed him back into his seat.
Sherlock’s omega squirmed, keening, wanting, but Sherlock refused its needs, because John wasn’t what he wanted — damn what his omega wished.
“Me? What? Oh. Yeah. Fine. Gas leak. Apparently.” Sherlock summarily answered, focus back on Mycroft.
Sherlock thought of all the things he'd love to do with John as the alpha caught his breath and knew what he really wanted to try next.
“I hope you’ve worked up an appetite.” John chuckled cheerily, shutting off the stove and opened the oven just as the timer buzzed.
John tackled a player from the opposite team, remaining on top of him for barely a moment after the initial fall, but Sherlock’s body tensed and a deep rumbling growl resonating through his bones.
Sherlock couldn’t quite place it, but John wasn’t acting the same since that evening he’d come home an emotional mess. John didn’t do emotions, not like a normal person. He was too stubborn for that. Instead, John liked to bury it all inside and deal with it alone. Never did he seek Sherlock’s comfort or support, no matter if that was all Sherlock wanted.
Sherlock’s face was pleasantly flushed and John knew though he’d handled John extremely well, sex was still a new thing for them. John wanted this though and, glancing down below and to the monstrous alpha cock pressing up firmly against Sherlock’s abdomen, John knew Sherlock wanted this just as much.
"Um, listen..." John didn't think this was right. Sherlock certainly didn't like this omega and John didn't think it was right of him to be associating himself with a man his husband wouldn't.
Harry came an hour and thirty-four minutes later. It took John thirty of those minutes to get himself out of the bed and sluggishly make the long way to the front door. When Harry arrived, he’d swung open the doors and fell into her arms. Sobbing against her neck, he nuzzled her scent gland.
"If I ever touch you..." Sherlock's anger from that hallucination was driving him to speak in such a way, but he found as the thought entered his mind he liked the idea of it. He would degrade John in the worst way possible for an alpha to be. He'd humiliate this alpha in recompense for John's infidelities. But just to be certain of how cruel and far he would go, he'd first need to know just how deep John's betrayals ran -
What was he supposed to say to that? Why was the alpha trying so hard to convince him he was a good man, when they both knew he wasn’t? He was a possessive alpha. That was all John would ever see him as, nothing more. Just as John was only an omega bitch bought to birth Sherlock’s kin.
A week and a half after his heat, Sherlock and John sat across from one another eating breakfast in comfortable silence. John was pleased that Sherlock was actually eating the eggs and bacon he’d prepared for them.
“What does Sherlock do?” John found himself asking the table of Homles’ several minutes later, his curiosity eating at him.
John was then transferred to Afghanistan and his life changed forever. He’d been shot and sent back invalid. He gained a tremor in his hand that destroyed his life as a surgeon and was left with no means of the life he’d once had. His only friend was that of his cane and limp.
“No what if’s Sherlock. I’m healthy. You’re healthy. You’ve been taking such good care of me and I’ve been careful.”
Sherlock raised his head, face flushed, his scowl hard and unforgiving. Sherlock knew just what John was implying and he most certainly was not... that, damn what those pregnancy books said.
Sherlock gave a curt nod, hands coming together, fingers pressed jointly and resting under his chin as Sherlock took on his thinking pose.
. Sherlock coughed out air and gulped it back in, eyes wide in wonder, staring up at John when the alpha pressed their foreheads together and stared into his eyes.
“Come here.” John called softly, open arms outstretched for Sherlock who willingly lowerd himself over John and slowly pressed his full weight into him, until Sherlock lay over John like another layer of flesh of warmth.
Clients kept coming and Sherlock kept declining and John was losing his patience with Sherlock’s inability to help, just because they weren’t fascinating.
. Sherlock shivered again, his body taking notice. Suppressants stopped his heats and made it more difficult to attain an erection, but it didn’t make him impotent. Sherlock wasn’t hard, or fully aroused, but his cock did twitch with interest.
