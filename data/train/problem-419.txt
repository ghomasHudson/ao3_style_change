As is really bloody typical, Sherlock appears to become aware that something’s amiss before John even hits the floor, which he does, with no insubstantial amount of wincing and grimacing against the shock of pain that spikes through him.
The way he’s sleeping too, upright, facing the hall and the stairs, almost like . . . he’s keeping watch. He is, or was, that must be what he was doing . . . And for once, John feels that he may be at an advantage in discerning the truth of the situation. Sherlock is brilliant, of course he is, but he’s also brilliantly stubborn, particularly in denial of that which he’d rather weren’t real, and that blinds him to a number of things. John, being less brilliant, particularly in denial, has a certain clarity of sight, which at times has him thankful to be of a more ordinary, less impressive stock.
Sherlock's got some feelings about what's happened, and that very fact has him bloody irritated.
It’s not like him to ask questions that redundant, or to which the answers are so evident . . .
He slides his hand away from Johnny boy’s face as if giving a caress before reaching for his hidden knife, which he’s slightly disappointed neither of them had noticed, but then, he supposes, they were a bit preoccupied. He strikes quickly and within a moment it’s sticking out of John’s leg like the thorn of some massive deadly rose; the arms around him tighten briefly in shock, but they release as the pain sweeps in on a wave, impossible to just ignore, and John Watson, sinks to the ground. It won’t kill the man, at least not anytime soon, but he is going to want to get it seen to once Moriarty has left.
“Oh come on love, let him stay for a minute. It's a special day, there's no time for being grumpy.” John tries to sooth the detective, begins to stroke Gladstone's flank, and lets his hand be licked in appreciation by the dog.
“Probably not. But maybe there are a few things going to happen that even YOU with your massive intellect can't predict. So do me a favour and play along now. I promise you, you won't regret it. And besides... it's really nice to have you at my mercy right now.” John answers the detective a little mischievously and slowly starts leading him out of the flat.
The thick blanket around him creates the perfect shelter from the outside world. He snuggles his head closer into the soft pillow under him and sighs contently.
Sherlock is wordlessly positioned into the centre of the room, a smug smile upon his face.
Johnny boy has shown his hand and Jim points out as much, relishing the little, sharp intake of breath beside his ear as a red laser sight hovers upon the pale skin of Sherlock’s forehead. He’s expecting the sudden release of those confining arms; showing the adversary the inevitability of their defeat should they resist does typically result in surrender, but he’s pleasantly surprised by a sudden constriction of the limbs surrounding him, moving from bruising to suffocating.
Forget the last stand, boys, get ready for trouble in paradise. No harm in stretching this out a little.
That decision made, John uses the cane to lever himself back up to a standing position and proceeds to the stairs, making his way carefully and painfully down the steps to the sitting room and through to the kitchen, where he seeks out a reasonably clean mug to fill with water. It’s as he’s taking his medication and washing it down with a drink that he hears a creak from the stairs and the soft sound of footsteps approaching the kitchen.
It was an unnatural silence that followed them from the moment of Moriarty’s departure and the disappearance of those dreaded red dots of laser sights mere seconds later; it clung to them even through the arrival of Lestrade and his team, and of the ambulance called to see to John’s leg, from which a knife had still protruded when the cavalry came. It clung like a parasite, like a tick, or some other clingy, unwanted thing.
“Sherlock... would you like to... walk a few steps with me? There is something I have to talk with you about.”
“I don't care what my last name is... I even would take on Mycroft's forename, as long as you become my husband as soon as possible.”
The detective looks up when he notices that someone is sitting down beside him and smiles when he notices that this someone is John.
“But not only this, you saved me by being you. That was all I needed. This ridiculous man with his cheekbones and his collar he always turns up to look cool.
Hope it wasn't too OOC.
“That's the reason why I'm not participating in ice skating”, Sherlock replies and plants a quick kiss on his partners short greyish hair, knowing full well about the sore spot that is his age.
Sherlock lets his arm wander around John's back and pulls him closer, while Rosie climbs unto her daddy's lap and snuggles against his belly.
With this words the older Holmes sibling again pats Rosie on the blonde haired head and climbs back into his posh car expecting the little family outside to follow.
to be continued.
“Puh, yeah, just a little exhausted and all of my bones seem to ache. I can't believe Rosie isn't in the least tired after skating almost an hour now.
You could have just told me where we're going.”
He nods at John and Sherlock in greeting and can't help but grin at the sight of his little brother, who is still not able to see anything and seems highly annoyed by it.
“Hello daddy!” the four year old instantly climbs off of Sherlock's body and jumps down the bed to run to her father and hug his legs tightly.
“What's all this noise that early in the morning?” the sound of a familiar voice interrupts the cheery tussle, as both Sherlock and Rosie look up at the man who just walked into the bedroom, a big wooden tray in his hands.
Without many words again, here is the final, very fluffy happy ending for the doctor and his detective.
Some modifications had to be done in order for John and Rosie to move in, as John's old room was now the child's nursery and the man himself moved into the bedroom with his partner.
He feels the warm rays of the winter sun shining onto his skin.
They pick her up and walk her over to the small bench, where Sherlock was originally seated to wait for them and manage to calm her down, while John inspects the thin arm of his little daughter.
He climbs out of his armchair and bridges the little space between them with two steps, to gingerly sink down on the detective's lap and wraps his arms around his loved one's neck.
“So, will you come to bed with me now, William Sherlock Scott Watson?”
Groaning he slowly turns his head a little so that he can open one eye and squint against the bright light of the morning sun.
“Will you marry me, Sherlock?” he repeats his question, giving the detective a confident smile.
John walking beside them, one arm casually wrapped around his partners waist, with Gladstone trotting behind the three.
He doesn't like not knowing things like that and by the third time they drive over the bump in one of the streets parallel to Baker Street, he is fairly certain that the driver of the limousine has the order to randomly drive around the blocks to confuse Sherlock and stopping him from finding out their destination.
Both man sit in silence and enjoy the company of each other, while watching their daughter dance over the ice rink.
Sherlock starts to tip something into his mobile.
“Well done!” Sherlock sits in his usual chair by the mantle, taking a sip out of the mug of tea in his hand. The fire beside him crackles and warms the air around them.
He hears a nervous cough from someone in the background. Maybe he shouldn't have done this surrounded by so many people.
Shortly after the flat got refurbished, after the bomb went up in it and everything was destroyed, they both moved in with Rosie, to Mrs Hudson's delight. The old woman loves to look after her little goddaughter and helps her two boys keeping the flat clean and appropriate for a child.
“Alright then, take me to bed now, fiancée.”
He cautiously folds it up with slightly trembling fingers and stares at the words he had written down over the last few days.
“Who would have thought that after ten long years, I'd still be around this nutter and not have lost my mind,” John continues a little more confident now and gently he squeezes Sherlock's hand.
“Yes, that's the idea. He isn't supposed to see where we're taking him. But we will take good care, so that he won't collide with a lamppost down on the street, won't we?”
He pauses at the “Awws” that sounded in the room and quickly looks up at Sherlock, who stares at him intently, seemingly not caring about the people around him, giving John his undivided attention.
After everyone's adequately dressed for going outside, they leave their little flat.
Her blue eyes begin to sparkle in excitement by the thought of Christmas presents.
What is it? Why does it seem so hard for John to talk about it? There must be a lot of sentiment involved. But is this good or a bad?
“You know, your papa and me met ten years ago today.”
Slowly he sinks down on one knee, never breaking eye contact with Sherlock.
John slowly climbs off his opponent's legs and offers him his hand to help him up, which Sherlock grabs without hesitation. The golden engagement ring on his slender finger glistens in the slowly dying light of the fireplace.
“Congratulations Sherlock. I'm so happy for you.” Molly also hugs the detective and then does the same with John, while quietly asking him, “Have you asked him, yet?” and giving him a conspiratorial look, when they part.
“So ahm... Sherlock... as - as this is our tenth anniversary and... after all this time, you know,” frustrated John let out a breath. He looks into the detective's blue-grey eyes and instantly feels calmer. He tries again, “I wanted to ask you... could you... would you like to-”
The doctor lets his head fall down onto Sherlock's shoulder, who instantly puts his arm protectively around his partner, to share his body heat with him, while continuing to read the case file on his mobile.
Mycroft carries Rosie in his arms and puts a finger on her lips to signal the little girl to be silent, which she seems to understand going by the soundless nodding she does.
Losing John and Rosie now that he finally has them, that he finally knows what a family is, is the cruelest thought his mind can possibly torture him with.
“I wouldn't say that I love Anderson that much, but to the rest of this cheesy words, I can agree,” Sherlock's deep baritone voice announces, which earns him a round of heavy laughter, especially from Greg who compassionately pats Anderson, that sits beside him, on the back.
Combined with the fact that they covered his eyes, spoke for their destination to be some place he knows the way to and have been to fairly often in the past.
Sherlock sighs in frustration. Not knowing about the content on this paper almost drives him mad. When John stood before him at the ice rink, he managed a quick glimpse at the many words, written in the doctor's own handwriting, but unfortunately not long enough to even make out one coherent word.
“Well she's roughly forty years younger than you, don't feel bad about it, you're supposed to rest after such a straining activity.”
He instantly retreats out of this dark place in his head, trying to focus on the other facts he gathered, to solve this puzzle. The place they are driving right now must be in close proximity to Baker Street, as they are going over the same bump in the road near their home for the
“Oh, come on now. No more tears. I think there have been enough emotions for one evening, don't you agree?”
They smile at each other and arm in arm the doctor and his detective leave for their bedroom, closing the door behind them.
Your mad experiments, your late night violin concerts, your sulking for days on end, your complete inability to manage your money or keeping even one room in the flat somewhat clean.” he stops again, giving the detective the time to process all that has been said.
As an answer the brown haired man slungs his arm around John's neck and deepens their kiss a little.
They continue to stroll around the ice rink, while John doesn't really seem to notice anything that's going on around him. Absently he strokes his hand through his hair and gives his partner a shy smile.
“What day?” Interested Rosie looks up from her hot chocolate, of which she just took a big sip and now licks over the small track of cocoa over her upper lip.
He leans over and strokes over Sherlock's back, “Don't you think it's time we thank our friends for the lovely evening we just had with them?”
Then he sits down in his own armchair and takes the mug Sherlock put down for him on the little coffee table by his side.
John takes a deep breath before continuing, “You saved your sister, who has stolen your childhood home and your best friend from you. You've... been so kind to my wife and have been there for me and Rosie, when she died.” He gulps and closes his eyes by the thought of Mary, lying before him, bleeding out, “I'm so... so sorry for the way I behaved around you back then. I know there is no apology for the things I did to you. It wasn't your fault. None of this was your fault.” With a serious look he looks up at Sherlock.
He lifts his hand from under the warm blanket and tentatively strokes over the dark blonde mane of the child before him.
This statement seems to have made Sherlock rather speechless, as he just blinks with slightly open mouth now.
So instead I gave you the opportunity to do what you love – deducing something – while successfully getting you to the place I wanted you to be, without all the drama and shouting.”
He huffs and digs his curly head even more into the thick pillow, trying to block out this unwelcome distraction and go back to the peaceful sleep he just had, but after a few seconds the tickling feeling continues at his right ear, followed by a faint giggle.
The other parts of his body are as perfectly clothed as ever. The detective wears a beautifully tailored black suit with a white shirt and his all time favourite Belstaff coat above them.
“Happy anniversary, Love,” he whispers softly.
“Is this really necessary?” Sherlock's annoyed deep voice sounds through their living room, where he stands right in the centre, his beloved deep blue scarf, that usually adorns his throat, now tightly wrapped around his eyes.
Reluctantly he breaks away from their kiss for a second to whisper into his lover's ear, “Maybe we should continue this at a little more comfortable place, what do you think?”
It's totally silent in the room now.
They stare at each other for a moment, until John can't hold back a giggle anymore that instantly diffuses the situation. This wasn't really a topic worth fighting for, for him.
Suddenly Sherlock feels the doctor beside him tense a little and takes a quick look at him. He seems lost in thought and nods to himself, before he looks up with a determined look on his face.
He must have already figured out where they are - so much for the little tour they've taken around London to confuse him.
“Well yeah, but would you have come without throwing a big tantrum of not wanting to celebrate this totally overrated occasion with all this socializing, when you instead could just sit down in your 221c playground and let some chemicals explode and pollute the air in the house?
“That's a clever thought, Rose, but I don't think Father Christmas has time for this right now. I believe after this busy days he's having a nice, long vacation. But I promise you we'll be celebrating something else today.”
“I don't know what you're talking about dear, but even if we don't see each other that often, I hope you still remember the name of the woman under which house you lived until you were eighteen years old.”
He locks his eyes with him.

Mrs Hudson is the first one to break the ice, by stepping forward and embracing first John, then Sherlock and kisses them both on their cheeks. “Congratulations, my boys.”
He can't hide the smile that forms on his lips, as he lays his head down against John's and feels all tension slowly leave his body.
They still live in 221b Baker Street.
“Not long now.” he hears his partner whisper and tries to relax a little by letting his head sink back into the leather seat behind him.
“I-I mean you were an arrogant prick. You were rude and strange, showing off your deductions, awkwardly trying to make me like you... And you succeeded.
Mission accomplished, John thinks, when he steps forward again and kisses his detective on the high cheekbone.
“I would say I'm a man in his best years. And you are not much younger than me either!” John replies, a little hurt in his pride.
And then the most important sentence finally is spoken, “William Sherlock Scott Holmes, will you do me the honour of becoming my husband?”
Once inside, the vehicle starts driving them through the busy streets of the city.
So this is it.
With a shaky voice he begins to speak anew, “So... I think it's time now.”
One door at the back slowly opens and out climbs the British Government himself, Mycroft Holmes.
“I hate ice skating.”
John winks at him and Sherlock can't help a grin at the perfectly plausible explanation of his partner.
“John?” comes the call again, slightly softer but no less insistent, from just the other side of John’s bedroom door.
And there John was, fretting over Sherlock, who hadn’t a scratch on him, while he himself had a brand new knife wound . . .
The door closes heavily behind him, but he doesn’t look back, doesn’t bother turning around to see Anderson and Sally’s faces, their shock and their shame. He doesn’t bother because they don’t matter, they don’t matter a bit, not their judgement, not their bad jokes, and Sherlock’s name doesn’t have the same meaning in their mouths: it’s not the same word when they speak it. On John’s lips, it means something entirely different.
Yes, that’s what’s upset him, that’s it. John’s appearance had been unforeseen, Sherlock hadn’t anticipated him being taken by Moriarty before their . . . appointment, hadn’t expected his flatmate to be thrown in as an extra element, as leverage, although perhaps, in hindsight, that had been an error in reasoning on his part. There’s nothing worse than an element of surprise being thrown into a carefully choreographed exchange; it’s unsettling, irritating.
So he falls asleep on a hard wooden floor, without blankets or pillows, sitting upright outside the room in which his injured friend lies unconscious, and he does so silently, lest he betray his own fears. John wouldn’t fault him for having fears, but it’s not about what John thinks, not really; it’s about the fragility of a persona, of self-perception and presentation constructed as a defense.
“John?” comes Sherlock’s voice, carrying up the stairs, and drugged though he still appears to be, John suddenly realizes that he’s actually quite angry at the owner of that voice.
It’s hard to tell right now if he has such a spot in Sherlock’s thoughts. Sherlock has such a great capacity for emotion, for care, John believes it … and that’s probably why the man doesn’t care, or tries not to. To know so much AND be able to feel something for every bit of it? Who could stand that?
These thoughts are all, of course, unnecessary and foolish and entirely beneath him, but all the same, it’s getting to the point where not even he can entirely deny their existence, or indeed the way they’re affecting his mood. He’s aware, logically, of what his priorities are, or what they should be, but at this particular moment, he’s not abiding by them, and failing to summon up the energy to care.  And that simply serves to complicate matters all the more.
“Oh, you absolutely should after the bloody mess you got me into,” John confirms, a bit of the anger he’s still harboring slipping into his voice, “but I’m frankly surprised at you admitting it.”
“Why not?” comes the gritted out reply an a harsh exhale, and Jim becomes suddenly much more conscious of both the sharpness and the proximity of the man’s teeth, “If we’re screwed either way.”
“John-” Sally tries to interject, but John’s not going to let that happen.
Turning around reveals to him an exhausted-looking Sherlock, swaying slightly on his feet by the dining table, hair a mess from a thorough ruffling and his dressing gown a fright of wrinkles.
He still couldn’t help wiping his mouth with his shirt sleeve though, even as he pushed all thoughts of consulting criminals aside, and he felt the cold grey eyes of a certain consulting detective following the motion, still mired in that odd silence.
A part of him says they don’t know any better, and part of him doesn’t give two shits about that.
John already seems so concerned with the “talk” about them, and though such concern for the opinions of others, largely strangers, is something that Sherlock cannot even fathom, he knows that John worries about it. And for some god-forsaken reason, Sherlock cares what John thinks … He keeps himself very busy giving an impression to the contrary, but that tiny, wriggling little thought, that stupid fear of John’s displeasure holds quietly fast. The fly in the ointment, ever present, no matter how he tries to pick it out.
Moriarty’s whole intention is to make him doubt himself, and apart from anything else, Sherlock’s pride won’t allow him to fall prey to such a feeble and transparent tactic, so why should his flesh itch and crawl beneath the skin the way it does? It shouldn’t, so he swallows the feeling down like so much unsweetened tea and dry toast, convincing himself that it’s equally as unimportant, but all that does is create a roiling weight in his stomach, discouraging him from doing much besides half-lying, half-sitting in the hallway, limbs heavier than they have any right to be.
John would say so. And John would also point out that Sherlock is appearing significantly more upset over the interaction between his flatmate and his enemy than is likely warranted or useful, particularly considering that they’d come uncomfortably close to being blown into little more than bone shrapnel and a gory spray. And Sherlock would tell him, though in somewhat more sophisticated terms, to sod off.
With a muffled groan, he pulls himself upright into a sitting position and observes the room. It’s much as he remembers leaving it, despite the vague memory in his mind of flopping about the place in a drugged stupor and being carried back to bed. Ah yes, Sherlock … John’s still angry, and his anger doesn’t exactly diminish as he looks to his bedside table and sees an empty glass, no water nor cup of tea left for him by the flatmate he spends most of his time looking after.
It’s easier to drift off to sleep here, next to John, than Sherlock would have predicted, but then, John’s always been different, hasn’t he?
“Well?” John prompts, sticking out an elbow so that Sherlock might support it.
It sounded regurgitated, like something they’d seen in some chatroom online, among the multitude of juvenile and detached evils that tend to lurk in such places, like something someone else made up. And somehow that was worse, because it wasn’t simply cruel, but lazily so, a useless, pointless cruelty. One that they hadn’t even put the effort into.
And the man in question hadn’t been able to resist appearing himself in the flesh of course, much in the way that Sherlock hadn’t been able to resist attending in person, the risk of it altogether too tempting, a siren song . . . A song that ended the moment John came into his sight.
For now, I'm back home resting up in between doctor's visits, and I intend to spend my awake time writing and drawing to be somewhat productive while I'm without employment.
A tender kiss was pressed to his forehead, and Holmes marveled to himself at the depth of his forgiveness, and how it was that John just
Watson frowned at the poor choice of words.
heart.
They stayed like that for a while, and Watson’s breaths slowed in order to match the rise and fall of his own chest. One of his hands was gently rubbing Holmes’ back, soothing out the tension there, letting the little sobs Holmes had kept in for so long bleed into his sweater.
Watson would be angry. He had been a fool to think otherwise. Once the initial elation at his return had faded, the rage had surfaced, fire that he never thought could be directed at him. He tried to imagine their situations reversed, and shuddered at the thought of how dependent he had become on his doctor.
“Well you’d better clean it up. And tell my ghost to move out. It’s got no business wallowing about here when we’re both alive and together.”
“Which is to say, not as much as one would expect, or
Sherlock forced himself to turn, to see the expression on the other man’s face at the words. The filtered slats of evening light caught utter bewilderment upon his features.
“Why come here?” Watson asked after a while.
, without him having to ask. He laughed, and they danced together for a while longer, the sounds of London the strains of music they waltzed to.
Watson misunderstood, and took his hand from his shoulder, a little flash of hurt in his eyes. Holmes didn’t know exactly what to say in a situation like this, so he simply grabbed the hand and put it back on his shoulder. Then he felt a little ridiculous, so he moved forward and gathered Watson up in a proper hug.
,” Watson continued, poking him in the ribs lightly, “Don’t think I haven’t noticed that you have somehow managed to waste away even further in the time we have been apart.”
know. He would have to be direct.
Holmes leaned in close once more and whispered, “It still carries your ghost my dear.”
"I could never leave you. Not really. Not forever. You do know that, don’t you Watson?"
“Fuck you,” Watson spits out, obviously also taken aback by this development, enough to be at a loss for words, but not enough to shake his stance or loosen his grip.
When John awakes again, his first thought is that, with relative surety, this is quite probably what gargling with cotton wool feels like, so parched is his mouth.
Pulling on a jumper and taking both the bottle of medication and cane in hand, John hobbles his way to his bedroom door with a grimace, jaw tight with a pain he’s doing his damndest to ignore, his steps more awkward than they’ve been since he and Sherlock first met. The handle turns easily in his grip however, and he takes a moment to be thankful that at least his hands are still fully operational as the door swings open into the hallway with a gentle creaking.
Lestrade too appeared to recognize the odd silence that developed and hung heavy like dank clouds around the two of them, for after ensuring that John’s leg had gotten medical attention, the man hadn’t even brought up the subject of giving their official statements, for once entirely content to let that go without even establishing a future date to come in to Scotland Yard. Instead, the man seemed to fairly flee under Sherlock’s stony gaze, appearing to take personal discomfort as well from John’s injury, as though battling some guilt on his own part. He needn’t have; John could think of a decent list of people who held some amount of responsibility for his wounded state, and Lestrade, while not completely off the list, certainly wasn’t anywhere near the top.
It’s quiet in the flat, unusually so, and the silence can only suggest that Sherlock has worn himself out and collapsed somewhere into a well-needed sleep by now, and John winces at the thought of what Sherlock might have been doing to wear himself out while he’s been entirely without John’s supervision. Still, he’s not exactly inclined to disrupt this temporary and quite rare peace, so he treads carefully upon leaving the room, avoiding the one particularly squeaky board as much as possible as he turns to close the door behind him.
He doesn’t want to . . . to touch John, and while he can easily identify from where and when the feeling sprang forth to take root inside his skull like some useless bloody weed, he’s at a loss to properly explain it, certainly to justify it.
And possessiveness is a more comfortable thing to feel than the vulnerability that accompanies simple, sincere affection.
The empty bed thought is new, but the desire for contact … It’s something he’s felt before, a thought he’s struggled on multiple occasions not to entertain.
“For all the difficulties he had with propriety and emotions, he still knew better than to do that, without even having to be told. He knew better, and you don’t,” he spits out as he takes his leave, turning his back on them and tossing out a last “What does that say about you?”
Sherlock had given a grunt of something like assent and John took it as good enough, hobbling off in search of a cab, which he would most definitely be making Sherlock pay for. They got home somehow, though John had evidently been well under the influence of medication by the time they arrived, given how little he remembers of it the next day when he wakes.
He wheezes, ribs spasming beneath crushing arms, and he’s enjoying the novelty of it, enough to forgo having the both of them shot where they stand. No one ever touches him, no one ever gets close enough to try, and he personally doesn’t prefer to get his hands dirty, so physical contact at all is an oddity, and all the more so when he can feel how much the grip wants him dead.
He wants to smooth John’s hair back from his forehead, and completely ignoring for now the inexplicable reasons for wanting to do so, how’s he to know if such a thing would be acceptable? He’s been invited into the man’s bed while he’s sleeping, a notoriously vulnerable state to be in, which shows an advanced level of trust even after recent unfortunate events, but does that trust extend to physical contact?
John listens for a moment once the door has closed, waiting for more creaking to indicate Sherlock’s retreat, and at the very noticeable lack of sound, John sighs.
“What you say, what you imply, and what you mean rarely match up, Sherlock,” John grumbles, shifting about to find a comfortable position in which to spend the next few hours in drugged slumber, “Now, whatever you’re going to do, just do it, and kindly shut up.”
Both options are fucking awful, and John is taking it personally, going by the number of times he’s had to remind himself to include all the other people they know who could’ve been hurt. He’s taking it personally, because he could’ve -would’ve- died for this man, and this man either disregarded him, or forgot about him. A man for whom he has killed before.
The “talk” would be worse, more upsetting for John, if anyone found them to have slept in the same bed, let alone while touching … But who’s to know? Only the two of them, with their respective excuses of exhaustion and painkillers, and perhaps Mycroft, if he’s gone to the trouble of installing cameras or other devices in John’s room. Sherlock’s not checked recently, not in here; he’s been far too busy with all the excitement.
Even from the perspective of an objective stranger, it hadn’t been a funny joke.
Someday it won’t hurt this much. John just has to wait.
He takes advantage of the moment of shock to run off, leaving one man stunned and the other bleeding sluggishly around Moriarty’s blade, letting the laughter that’s been bubbling up inside his chest escape, echoing around the pool along with the sound of the slamming door as he properly takes his leave. He knows suspicion and doubt and blame will begin to roil in his wake, and when he finally answers his phone, his voice is bright, a testament to a positively marvelous mood.
“Well, someone’s feeling generous today,” John remarks drily, eyebrows raised.
“John,” the man answers, with a tone that’s a bit hard for John to immediately identify, “You weren’t in bed.”
It’s enough for him to get at least a bit of a grip on himself, enough that he probably won’t do anything he could be prosecuted for, and he’s aware that had he had any more to drink tonight, before the words were spoken, that he would be throwing his barstool right now rather than sitting on it. As it is, he’s gonna be the bigger man, he’s gonna be the one with composure, because that’s what Sherlock would do whenever a taunt truly struck a chord, he’d never let it go, but neither would he give them the satisfaction of breaking down. It’s a different kind of bravery, and it’s one that John always admired.
The shiver is real, a genuine response, but no one has ever been able to accuse Jim Moriarty of not being a dramatic actor, and with Sherlock looking on, so adorably lost for all his cleverness, Jim can’t not play this up.
Turning carefully and swinging his legs off the side of the bed to let his feet rest gingerly against the floor, John congratulates his past self on the foresight he’d had to leave his cane within reach from his bed, despite the fact that he uses it so rarely these days. Taking it in hand, he uses it to heave himself up into a standing position, clenching his teeth at the agonizing tightness in his leg and cursing a variety of people and things: Sherlock, Sally, Lestrade, Anderson, his own leg, the very concept of knives … But not Moriarty, not right now. He’s not ready to think about that yet, and cursing Moriarty would involve far too much thinking about him for John’s comfort.
He wakes, quite frankly, feeling as though a gerbil has been living inside his skull, an oddly specific feeling which is difficult for him to describe in any other words, but if he has to be general, the word ‘uncomfortable’ will surely do. He feels a bit like he’s stuffed with cotton wool as the heaves himself awkwardly out of bed and wobbles his way towards the window for about two steps, before very suddenly being given an extremely pointed reminder of the fact that he’d had a knife sticking out of his leg last night, but a few hours ago.
Sherlock is cold, sitting in a chair wearing too few layers in John’s bedroom, and the warmth of John is seductive from all the way over here, making him want to be closer, closer … Awake, he can limit this impulse, but his sleeping body, he has much less control over that, that being one of the reasons that he avoids sleeping whenever possible, certainly when in company … and he’s getting exhausted enough now that resisting sleep while warm and comfortable will be quite difficult, verging on impossible.
“Funny,” John says, voice flat, and it startles Sally and Anderson from their episode of hilarity, the laughter swallowed abruptly in surprise, and Greg too looking more than a little shocked, “Not your joke, but you.”
“It’s not generosity,” Sherlock protests, ever the one to reject the accusation of exhibiting a virtue, “It’s . . . concern.”
“Yes, but not here, love, I’m shy,” Watson’s curse was loud enough for Sherlock to hear, making it the perfect set up to Jim's own response as he arches slightly against the form behind him.
Jim flicks his eyes up to take in Sherlock’s face, knowing that he should be able to just about half make out their conversation, but over the sloshing of water and the frantic pulsing of blood through his veins, the man is unlikely to make out every word. The situation is ripe for misunderstanding, and Jim has always loved a taste of the dramatic, the more fraught the better. He’s never shied from poking the beast.
Sherlock merely scoffs, the clearest sign of him being at a loss for words, but it is the wounded look that flickers in his eye that encourages John to take pity on him.
His shoulder is warm, it turns out, because Sherlock’s hand is resting upon it, or more accurately clinging to the cloth where John’s shirt stretches over his shoulder, his fingers entangled in it in a way that is no doubt going to create some dreadful wrinkles. There is a moment of mild concern for his shirt, which John knows is cheap enough that such a grasp for such a length of time will likely distort the fabric permanently, but longer lasting than that is a vague sort of concern for Sherlock. He’s never been altogether careful about physical boundaries, certainly not for the other person’s sake, but neither can he be described as the clingy type.
John can't help but chuckle at the smart reply and leans in closer against the detective.
The detective's eyebrows instantly shoot up. He looks rather scandalised, not in the least as tired as just a second before.
After this sentence, the doctor stands up on his tiptoes, to make up for their height difference, slings is arm around Sherlock's neck and tugs him into a loving kiss, which is accompanied by loud cheering and clapping of their friends.
“Thanks, Love,” John presses a delighted kiss on the curly head of the detective and leaves the room to help Rosie change and get ready himself.
Where are they taking him?
He risks a quick glance at their friends before them who observe his actions silently and then can't help but smile at the look of total confusion on Sherlock's face, as their eyes meet again. Not a sight one sees very often.
As soon as both man stand up and Rosie was silently given to Molly to sit on her godmothers lap, all eyes of the little crowd of people land on them and the whole room falls silent.
It took a while but Sherlock has manged to adapt to this new situation life. He wants to make this work.
Little Rosie was way faster and interrupted his thought by shouting, “Ten years? You're that old already?”
Part I/III
Letting out a long breath Sherlock slowly nods but lets his head fall back onto the pillow.
Obviously not satisfied with the sudden interruption of this pleasant moment and pouting his lips, Sherlock lets himself dramatically fall down onto his pillows. John strokes over Rosie's velvety hair and chuckles, while lifting the breakfast tray he brought from the kitchen onto the bed before the three of them.
A little confused Sherlock nods and gets up from the bench. A little unsure of what's to come.
Their quite, little bubble soon bursts, as a shuffling against the door was heard, followed by the loud barking of a small brown-white bulldog, that confidently enters the bedroom and comes beside the bed of its masters.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Is this for a case?” John asks curious to which his partner nods.
“Just five more minutes. Go look after your daughter and this ridiculous dog, I'll be with you when you're ready to leave.”
You gave me and Rosie a home and a family and I just want to say... thank you. Thank you, Sherlock Holmes. I-” John's next words get caught in his throat, when he feels the arms of the detective encircle his frame now into a strong hug. He inhales the sweet smell of Sherlock's soft curls, as they are pressed right under his nose and feels the shaking of the bony shoulders, that he slowly strokes with his hands, as his partner seems to have lost the battle with oncoming tears.
Sherlock wraps the blonde girl in his thick Belstaff coat. She instantly snuggles against him and clutches at his blue scarf with her little hands, already on the brink of sleeping after all the excitement.
“Can't we just take a cab?” Sherlock whines like a little child and is surprised by feeling a chaste kiss on his cheek. “Don't be such a spoilsport. I'll protect you from this bad big brother of yours. I promise.” he hears Johns voice right by his ear while he is gently dragged in the direction of the car.
He lets his eyes wander around the ice rink, spotting his daughter, who instantly waves at him and continues to graceful glide over the ice, laughing with another kid that she just met.
Sherlock notices how John nervously licks over his upper lip, seemingly lost in thought, while gently sliding over the detective's fingers with his gloves.
He huffs in frustration, very tempted to rip the annoying scarf from his face, but resists by the feeling of John's hand soothingly stroking over his left arm.
It takes his thoughts back to a few hours ago when, after their little adventure at the ice rink, Rosie and Gladstone had finally taken a little nap on the couch in the living room and Sherlock and John had lain down in their bed to having a little cuddle.
Confidently he grabs Sherlock's cold hand and wraps his gloved own around it, while holding Gladstone's leash in his other one.
“Really? Can I call you Mycroft then from now on? I always wanted to do that.” Sherlock smiles mischievously.
Stating by the date, as it is their anniversary, the probability of it being a positive occurrence is much higher than this to be something like a break up - a goodbye letter, for instance.
“Alright, I think we're ready to go now.” John announces finally, after successfully making sure, that the detective isn't able to see anything through the thick scarf, by rapidly waving his hand before his face.
He fishes a folded white paper out of his trouser pocket and grabs Sherlock's left hand determined in his, intertwining their fingers.
monsunwind
“Breakfast in bed, John? To what do I own this pleasure, is it already my birthday again?” he asks in a sarcastic voice.
“Go on, you big child. You are worse than Rosie today. Accompany us. It'll be fun.”
“It fits perfectly,” the detective announces proudly, seemingly fascinated by the tiny piece of jewellery.
All the people that accompanied them through the last ten years. Their friends.
He feels the detective's hands cupping his face.
“You okay?” John whispers, when they both sit down and Sherlock nods, a little smile forming on his lips as he lets his eyes wander over the people around them, all chatting cheerfully with each other.
“Thank you,” Sherlock replies with a proud smile and puts his mobile away.
Sherlock sniffs and nods. John notices the little wrinkles around the detective's eyes appearing now, a sign that he is really exhausted.
When she steps back all the other people slowly circle around them and hug them or pat them on their backs, congratulating them on their anniversary.
“I know. You are just supposed to be there and take care of Gladstone and I look after Rosie. Deal? And besides... I have to ask you something important later, so... please come with me.”
“Stop sulking, Love. Look, I brought something for us. Coffee for you and me, and cocoa for you Rosie and fresh toast with jam and even strawberries,” John tries to sooth his moody partner, who crossed his arms before his body like a sulking child, having been denied his favourite toy.
Nervously John looks down at the handwritten words he wants his partner to hear now. After all this years of enduring and giving and never asking for something in return. The man finally needs to hear this. So he slowly breathes in and out and begins reading.
John got a new job in a nearby surgery, where he helps out a few days a week to be able to pay for Rosie's needs, which he as her father wants to pay for alone.
There won't be a more perfect moment for this.
He takes a deep breath and begins to speak, “Sherlock, there are a few words I want you to hear. I hope you like them so... just listen...”
No - stating by the clothes John asked him to wear, before he blinded him and the doctor's and Rosie's own rather festive attire, it must be somewhere more posh.
Even Mycroft awkwardly hugs his brother and John for a few seconds and Anderson bursts into tears, while embracing Sherlock.
“Hey, it's okay. We're fine. Was it too much?”
Together they wave at Rosie and start to walk a few steps on the small pathway along the ice rink.
John carefully lifts the full mug of coffee before him, hands it to Sherlock and plants a chaste kiss at the high cheekbone of the detective, who doesn't seem that much offended about John's denial of more kisses anymore.
John winks at Rosie, while grabbing his partner's left forearm, who snorts disdainfully.
Four years later now they still are learning to adapt to their new life with a child. But they both do their best to be as good as parents as they can be and seeing the little girl being this happy as is she now, tightly grabbing John's Hand while she skates over the frozen ice rink, laughing loudly when John stumbles slightly and almost falling down on his backside, they know that they are doing it the right way.
John sees his partner's eyes rapidly getting shiny again.
“Oh dear, brother. Is that the new fashion one's wearing their scarves now?” he teases the detective, who instantly responds, “Would you just shut up! What are you even doing here, for God's sake? Wait - I don't really want to know... Just let us get this over and done with now.”
John is watching his partner who plays with laughing, little Rosie on his lap. He can't help but smile at this endearing sight.
He feels a dip in the mattress beside him and slowly the blanket is pulled down his head, so he can see the deep blue eyes of the man he loves right before him.
“Morning, love,” the doctor whispers and softly strokes over Sherlock's bare shoulder.
Again John and Sherlock have to giggle a little, while the smaller man closes the space between them and lets his head fall onto his lover's shoulder.
So it is settled that they would return home and have lunch there and Rosie can take a little afternoon nap.
He focuses on the face right before him and a warm feeling floods every fibre of his being. It's the face of the most perfect creature he has ever met in this world. The little girl with her long blonde, unruly hair and the huge, deep blue eyes, crowned with long black lashes, her small, freckled nose just inches away from his own, smiling back at him and gently brushing her soft finger over the bridge of Sherlock's nose.
Impatiently Sherlock nods, already seeming to have this worked out on his own, “Yes but why going through all this? Keeping me blind and driving for almost half an our around London, when we could have been here in less than ten minutes.
They deepen their loving kiss, lost in each other and both filled with so many emotions, not really registering the cheering that is going on around them.
A warm, fuzzy feeling of being utterly happy spreads inside Sherlocks chest, as he looks down onto his own little family.
John gives him a shy smile while unconsciously stroking his jacket pocket, where he hurriedly crammed the paper inside, when Rosie cried out for him.
“Would you stop this!” the doctor interrupts Sherlock's words immediately.
“First of all... I-I wanted to thank you all for coming and celebrating this important date with us today. It really means a lot to us and we love you all” he starts a little clumsy, reaches out his hand, blindly finds the long, elegant fingers of his partner and intertwines them with his own, while giving the crowd a grateful nod and a smile.
“No, sweetie, Christmas won't be again until next winter,” John carefully explains his little daughter, who nods and has only eyes for the sweet strawberry in her hand now, which she hastily puts into her mouth. After chewing, the four year old tentatively asks, “But couldn't we buy a Christmas tree today? Maybe Father Christmas will see it and come back a little earlier.”
“Yes,” John confirms, “a party to celebrate our anniversary together with our friends.”
“Everything's alright?” he asks after his partner, who apparently is taking a break from ice skating, stating from the exhausted look on his face, the heavy breathing and the abandoned skates he's dropped beside the bench.
John can't help the tears that come to his eyes and clears his throat a little embarrassed and unsure what to do now.
“I love you,” he can't help but breath into his partner's ear, letting memories of their first meeting flood his thoughts. How young they have been. The instant connection between them, when they first laid eyes onto each other in the small lab of St Bart's Hospital. Their first laugh about their ridiculous chase around London, their first case, their first “date” at Angelo's. What a ride the both of them had.
He feels Sherlock's hand wander from his hair down to his neck, where the detective softly strokes his skin.
So much that I moved in with you after only one day of knowing you.” A round of laughter goes through their little crowd of friends, “That was the best decision I've ever made in my life, to be honest.
Fortunately the detective lets go of the subject and follows the doctor to a pair of empty chairs where they sit down beside Rosie, who is still playing with a red balloon, that belongs to the decoration Molly and Mrs Hudson had done to the little restaurant in honour of their friends.
You are not in control.
A charitable part of himself thinks that perhaps Sherlock had thought John would be safe if he weren’t by Sherlock’s side, but that in itself comes with a genuinely infuriating quality of negligence, such a frustrating lack of forethought. John is caught, in a way, because it seems like Sherlock wandered off on his own, potentially to die, and hadn’t thought a moment about how anyone, John included, might be affected by such a thing. Either he thought it through, decided John didn’t matter that much, and went ahead, or John -and everyone else, of course- never properly crossed his mind, so engrossed was he in the game.
Sherlock doesn’t stand out there all day, in fact.
Then Jim’s phone rings. A new development, a new element has arrived.
What John doesn’t see as he drifts off, is the way that Sherlock watches him in his sleep, brows furrowed, mouth drawn into a serious line. It’s a look John has certainly seen before, though this time in a context unlike previous occasions: a look that tells of deep contemplation, of questions teetering on the razor’s edge of an answer.
It doesn’t escape John though, the way that Sherlock flinches slightly at each stifled grunt of pain that escapes John’s throat . . . If he didn’t know better, he’d say that someone is feeling just a touch guilty . . .
If John must choose between sacrificing his dignity or being in pain, dignity can very well go hang. Just so long as Sherlock doesn’t see him do it . . . he’d never hear the end of it then, and neither, he suspects, would Lestrade and his team, or anyone else they know.
Hah. “Feels” wrong. Feelings are foolish, they distract and divert from more important, more useful things. Feelings alone don’t solve anything, they simply get in the way of reasonable, realistic solutions. All this Sherlock knows, and yet here he is, fretting over wanting to stroke John’s hair back from his forehead in the midst of the man’s pained, restless sleep. Here he is, standing -or more precisely, sitting- sentinel at the door of John’s bedroom, guarding him against everything, and nothing in particular.
“Oh yes,” John sighs, mumbling as he settles back into the pillows and pulls the blanket up to cover himself, “How could I have forgotten that you alone in the world are impervious to exhaustion, my goodness, what an idiot I am . . .”
John told him that he could take the other side of the bed … It’s perfectly reasonable, after all, it is comfortably big enough for the both of them to sleep without getting much in the other’s way, and whatever discomfort that the close proximity might inspire would be sufficiently cancelled out by the anticipated depth of their unconsciousness. It’s reasonable, yet Sherlock hesitates, which is not like him. He’s never put much stock in boundaries, never been too concentrated on observing them, so why is this line harder to cross, even once given explicit permission?
“Sherlock?” John inquires over the rim on his cup, casting a deliberately blank look over to his flatmate.
wink wonk
He gets a few steps before he finds himself once again interrupted.
“Right . . . okay,” John quickly refills the cup and begins to leave the kitchen, squeezing past Sherlock’s looming figure on the way out with the full intent of going back to bed and remaining there peacefully for as long as he can stand to.
Once he’s in the room, he sighs in his put-upon way, which John has to admit he’s definitely had a hand in creating, being a frequent user of that sort of sigh himself, most often directed at Sherlock. The man was bound to pick it up and turn it back around on John; such is his way.
“Yes, obviously.”
John now firmly deposited back in the safety of his bed, he watches through increasingly bleary eyes as sleep creeps back up on him, observing Sherlock as he turns to leave John alone once more, not looking back as he opens the door, steps through, and lets it swing shut again behind him. John closes his eyes, expecting to hear the sound of footsteps upon stairs once again, this time in retreat, but the sound doesn’t come, stopping with the creak of floorboards in the hall.
He understands that while Sherlock has not, and might never say so, he is sorry for the danger to John incurred by his own actions. It’s a greater danger than he’s ever brought upon them before, and as such, the appropriate apologetic action must be elusive, with no past data to draw upon . . . Perhaps that is why he sits watch now in the hall outside John’s bedroom . . .
There’s nothing worse than arguing with someone who has a valid point.
This is now a multi-chapter fic, at the readers' request. Thanks for your feedback, folks!
“I’m perfectly capable of attaining anything of which I have need,” the man in question responds, as if on some sort of petty auto-pilot before his tone softens, “I was wondering if you did.”
They haven’t noticed the way that Greg has gone absolutely rigid at John’s side, knuckles white around the pint he’s holding and his eyes wide, stuck on John as if watching a stick of dynamite with only millimeters left to burn on the cord. John watches him freeze in an oddly detached way . . . John hasn’t gone stiff like Greg has, he’s loose and a terrible sort of calm, and it’s a feeling he recognizes in the darkest parts of himself as the most dangerous way he’s ever felt, the way he’s felt right before doing the worst things he’s ever done . . .
“That’s exactly the sort of comment that’ll get you thrown out,” John retorts, “now, there’s the chair, I’m sure that you know what to do with it, or if you’re still tired, you can take the other side of the bed. I’ll be too asleep for you to disturb me.”
“You’re sure?”
“I’ll rip your damn throat out,” the man hisses through those teeth, oh so close, and it’s not only got anger behind it, but conviction, as if perhaps he’s done it before, and the thought provokes a shiver of unexpected intrigue.
“My snipers could just shoot you in the head, you know,” he mentions casually, tossing the phrase back over his shoulder with a familiarity that makes Sherlock’s shoulders stiffen, if only for a moment, “The vest is a frill that I admit I love, and I’m reluctant to see it go unused, but a bullet to your brain will do much the same job.”
Were it an induced sleep, the location would be more understandable, but as it is, it’s quite odd. To the outsider, it might seem like it would be normal, at least Sherlock’s brand of normal, to fall asleep in odd places, and while this is in a way true, Sherlock is also a creature of habit, at least inside his own flat. The places in which he’s known to nap may sometimes be odd, but they are at least predictable: sofa, armchair, the floor in front of the armchair, a few times on top of the coffee table, when the sofa and armchair were otherwise occupied with stacks of books, lab equipment, and other odds and ends. The hall outside John’s bedroom was entirely new, and for that reason both perplexing and slightly worrying. What the hell was he doing there? He can’t have chosen it for the sake of comfort . . .
Mercifully, Sherlock actually does remain silent, and as John’s eyes flutter shut, he sees the man striding over to the chair, pulling it out, and plopping himself down into the seat with a quiet huff. He’s sitting in it backwards because of course he is; god forbid he sit like an average person, but John knows that this show of unnecessary rebellion won’t last long once he’s fallen asleep, at which point discomfort will likely win out over obstinance.
But maybe John’s still just a little bit high, he considers as he’s flopped unceremoniously back into bed and tucked in, largely without skill, but thoroughly, betraying Sherlock’s hidden capacity for care. The tucking in isn’t strictly necessary, but it’s what John always does for Sherlock when the foolish man manages to get off his head on something or another, whether intentionally or not, and Sherlock’s evidently picked that up too. It’s not just Sherlock who’s changed John’s life on so many levels, both large and small; John’s managed to leave his own mark, and the thought of that is strangely satisfying.
He hadn’t paid much attention to John Watson, viewing him as not too dissimilar to a handbag or some other accessory to Sherlock’s outfit, at least until recently, when it occurred to him how wonderful the fellow would look wrapped up in explosives, and how wonderful the expression of shock would look on Sherlock’s face. And oh, it had been satisfying, that split second where the man was forced to doubt the one person to whom he’d so unthinkingly given his trust, that split second where anyone watching could see his heart dropping like a stone to the pit of his stomach, pale eyes widening with an as-yet unknown fear. The fear of the unknown is always the worst. And it’s tremendously effective.
I hope I'm keeping people interested, because, uh ... Moriarty is coming back, and sooner rather than later. After all, John is interesting now.
The doubt behind Sherlock’s eyes isn’t just a flicker anymore; even as he rebels against it, it’s taken hold, and at this moment he has to be wondering what else has gone on between John Watson and Jim Moriarty, what else may be at play here that Sherlock hasn’t foreseen, hasn’t recognized. What was said that he didn’t hear? What happened that he didn’t see? It’s not only the doubt of a friend, it’s also self-doubt, and it’s fantastic.
“Alright,” he’d sighed, addressing Sherlock as he heaved himself to his feet with a wince, “Let’s be off home. I’ve got maybe half an hour before I’m fully off my head on pain meds, and I’d rather I be in my own bed when that happens.”
At least this time when he awakes his mind is clear enough to remember the fact that sudden movements, particularly of his leg, will hurt like an absolute bitch, and he thus takes his sweet time coming fully into consciousness, letting his eyes get used to fluttering about before any attempts to open his eyelids. Upon opening them, he takes a moment to observe a crack on the ceiling that he hadn’t paid much attention to before, letting the sight divert him from the pain that grows with each moment of wakefulness. He recognizes however, that if he doesn’t want it to become truly awful, he’d best get moving, at least enough to get his medication and a glass of something to wash it down with.
John would undoubtedly tell him that he’s experiencing some form of shock, but of course that is ridiculous; shock is something that happens to other people, people with less control. Because Sherlock is in control, of course he is, he always has been, and anyone who thinks otherwise is a fool.
Whatever is he to do about that?
“Fatalistic? Is that what you’re going with then?”
Whether Sherlock had killed Moriarty or the other way around -because they’ll never end up working together, Jesus Christ, it’s hard enough for someone as straightforward and even-tempered as John to get on with Sherlock and there’s no way that lunatic Moriarty could manage it- it would still have been awful. It would have spread, like a cold, to everyone Sherlock’s life had touched. If he’d killed the man, he’d come out of it changed, John knows that. And if he, if Sherlock had been the one to be killed … Well, there’s reason enough that John had tried to prevent that, without even going into the number of other people who’d be left to grieve.

It was the same routine, the song and dance of Sherlock not wanting to eat and then discovering after the first few bites that he was ravenous and eating anything John would put in front of him. John was happy to know that part hadn't changed. Other parts, like the grating arrogance and confidence, had drastically morphed into something more human than Sherlock had ever showed the world.
"I'm always thinking," Sherlock replied without hesitation.
"John?" Sherlock's voice cracked.
John stared at her for a moment. "He's told you this?"
"When I'm gone I know what you could become."
Sherlock looked more tense and John started to regret his choice of words. "I want to go see Molly."
"You always get up so late," John pointed out. Sherlock smiled and turned onto his back, untangling messy curls with his fingers and making them poof more.
"That's normal, for a wake and all." John thought for a moment and Sherlock was happy for the brief silence. "Are you scared of seeing his parents?"
"What's that all about?" Mrs. Hudson asked John.
John nodded once to himself. “Exactly.” He tried to sound softer, realizing that before he had a Captain Watson edge in his tone. “Now come on, there's a pull out bed that needs to be set up.”
But John was worried. There was that absence of His Sherlock. The man who only gave a kind word to those who had earned his trust, which was usually John or Molly. He hadn't asked for a case, hadn't made deductions.
"I can't help being scared, John, it's what I do. I'm scared that people will leave so I don't get attached because I functioned fine without people then you walked in and I got attached and then it's never been the same, I'll never be the same, so it's not worth it to disappoint you."
“Sherlock, come on. We can look this over later.”
Sherlock dropped a plate onto the counter, breaking it. "Dammit!" he snapped, gingeringly picking out the larger pieces. "I'm sorry, John, it must've slipped, won't happen again."
John caught up to Sherlock. "Hey, Sherl--"
"And everything with Molly?"
"I do," John agreed. "Sounds perfect."
When John did return, he saw that the consulting detective hadn't moved. "Sherlock, come on," John urged as he started unpacking the paper containers full of the Chinese take away John had ordered.
"Do you want me to take her?" Molly asked, looking to Rosie.
Sherlock focused his attention on his chore, answer nonchalantly, "Of course I know."
"Well, I figure if after seven years you finally figured out my sexuality, maybe you can deduce some other things as well."
"Um, hello, Molly."
"Well then that makes me feel even worse about the whole thing." John was starting to shout now, too.
"Yes, but I hate feeling things, therefore I don't think about them," Sherlock answered quickly as he made a point to not look directly at John.
John looked at him sadly. He didn't want John to be sad anymore. "I'll get you a T-shirt and see if I have any long pajama trousers around while you fold out the bed. Okay?"
"I'm not scared of you. I'm not, really. I..." Sherlock didn't know what to say. How did he feel? "I blame myself for the pain that you felt. I blame myself that you were hurting badly enough to hurt me."
"What were they like? Your boyfriends?"
"And I will do it again," he replied before placing a delicate kiss to Sherlock's chest. His eyes, as they tended to always do, suddenly and unpredictably landed on the bullet hole. John traced his index finger over it, thinking.
The man just smiled back at Sherlock. "I'm glad to see that you found yourself a family, William."
"Sherlock, is this because you think your brain is unreliable?"
John looked at his shoes. Sherlock realized they were his date shoes.
"I don't know, you're the consulting detective," John replied as he read the newspaper at the kitchen table.
Get ready, I'm thinking some angst is coming their way next chapter so stay tuned
“So how come you won't?” John asked. “You usually make a point of dazzling me with your brilliance, why is it so different now?”
"And I think that you're really handsome, and for some reason you being small makes you adorable too because looking at you I can't find one word that combines those two because you're so uniquely, extraordinarily you," Sherlock rambled.
Sherlock paused, mug still mid air, looking panicked before he could school his expression. "Yes?"
"Sherlock--"
"Alright, but if you're late at all I will call Mycroft, understood?"
"Yes, love?"
"No, which would be lovely to hear more often," Mrs. Hudson said accusingly with a light smack to his arm. "Go after him, he finds the little one soothing." So John buckled Rosie into the car seat and Sherlock helped wordlesslly.
"Dr. John Watson and Sherlock Holmes. My Baker Street boys."
John opened the first lab door he came to and saw Sherlock stooped over the microscope. His hair was shorter than it was that first meeting, he had a little more color to his skin, and he had definitely gotten to a healthier weight. But when John saw those blue eyes look up at him he grinned because it was the same brilliant ending as before.
Sherlock grinned, eyes bright and shining and happy, ecstatic even, for the first time in a long, long while and Sherlock felt like that look was the answer to every problem the universe could throw at them. "I get to have a family with you," Sherlock said. "And you mean it."
"I might've poked at him a bit too much," John answered, which he figured was true. He had poked at feelings that weren't meant to be processed yet and Sherlock was short circuiting.
"Alright, alright, fine." John stuffed his hands into his pockets. "Was he like me in any way?
"Sherlock, that's not--"
“Oh,” John said dumbly anyways. “You can talk, you know. To me. About whatever it is you're thinking.”
Sherlock stirred again, opening one eye to look at John, a splash of colour on the black and white canvas. Then he smiled and John smiled back. "You always wake up so early," Sherlock mumbled as he tucked his hands under the pillow and snugfled into it.
Sherlock decided that sitting in the lounger would help somewhat. He sat, leaning back into the over stuffed chair. Rosie leaned her head into his chest.
"That was a lovely story," John said. "You think I'm amazing?"
Sherlock turned to him. "A ride?"
John licked his lips. “Come on.” He tugged on Sherlock's arm, turning him around to finally walk down the steps and back out onto the street.
Sherlock knew that John was smiling. "Well, good. I worked hard to look at least semi-impressive compared to you and I'm thankful that my work hasn't gone unnoticed."
The story with our boys isn't over yet, but they're in this together.
"I broke mine."
"Just hear me out. Have you ever had any boyfriends? In the past?"
"Yes, even then."
John pressed his lips together for a moment before answering. "Then I will help you stop using."
"Home is still being reconstructed," Sherlock argued.
*******************************
Sherlock did have to admit to himself that he felt better. It was good, having John's arms around him as a memory that would anchor him to reality as rampant bits of his palace were flying at him. Because John regretted hurting him, wouldn't do it again, and it made Sherlock feel like maybe he had done something right.
Sherlock's eyes popped open as he took a breath through his mouth. "I can't... I just... I don't..."
The car ride to the funeral home was silent. Rosie talked in the back seat, put in a small black dress with a matching headband adorned with flowers and a small section of net that was supposed to look akin to a mourning veil. Mrs. Hudson had picked it out while John stayed home with Sherlock as he cried. John had one hand on the wheel, the other clapping Sherlock's cold fingers in his.
Sherlock's head bowed and he squeezed his eyes shut. "Yes."
John looked up at him. "That's a load of rubbish, you feel things."
"I got a baby monitor, you know. Can hear everything," John said. That was the moment that Sherlock decided that everything he said had been particularly embarrassing. "Little bee, huh? I like it. Every little girl deserves an adorable nickname."
"That doesn't matter," Sherlock replied calmly, almost monotone. "You still said it."
"That's not what I'm saying," John said gently. "You can come upstairs whenever you feel like you need to. I'm just saying that it's okay if you feel...insecure now."
Sherlock looked up. “Pardon?”
Sherlock Holmes blushed, for the first time in John's presence. Rosie babbled nonsensically and Sherlock directed his attention to the small baby girl as he tried to regain his composure. "Well, um, I suppose..."
John felt like absolute rubbish for it all. He hasn't been himself since Mary died, completely neglecting what had happened to Sherlock. Before he would shoot a man for him without a second thought and while playing the Saw murder games he couldn't. But John felt like the Dr. Watson in a cream coloured cable knit jumper was finally back and was ready to prove that to Sherlock.
Sherlock sat in the back. He didn't know if it was because he didn't have the energy to walk anymore or if it was because he didn't want anyone to see him cry, but he sat and John sat next to him. John put a reassuring hand on his thigh and Sherlock wishec that he could smile at him.
The stroll through the park never happened. Well, John supposed it did, but it was more like Lestrade had stumbled upon a murder victim there and John followed Sherlock about with Rosie in her stroller as he solved it with little pieces he gathered.
"Want to come with?"
"How about we go to bed, yeah?" John asked. It had only then registered that he was saying something else and Sherlock wasnt listening.
Sherlock came down the stairs, heading for the living room where his trousers and shirt were instead of into the kitchen. "Sherlock?"
Sherlock got down two mugs and put a tea bag in each. "Well, you had Mary, you were happy."
Sherlock opened his eyes, John's face blurring. "Then why do I still feel awful?"
"Rosie needs to call you something other than Sherlock," John said. "Because, well, you're raising hee now and you're practically her second dad. I was wondering what you would have in mind? I'm afraid I have already been assigned one so it would probably be helpful to pick another, but--"
Sherlock looked at his hands. "I'm sorry." It was the only phrase he felt was suitable for him to say anymore. He was sorry that he had to play with Molly like that. He was sorry that he almost shot Mycroft. He was sorry that John almost died for him again. He was sorry that Mary was dead, that Rosie had to grow up without a mother, that John had to see the state Sherlock was in at the hospital, sorry for everything.
"Sentiment," Sherlock replied.
Then he had met Sherlock Holmes. And he thought he could see an end with him. A damn good one, too.
But since thinking about it made Sherlock feel heavy again, he kept himself high on being forgiven by everyone he felt was important. Even when his doubts came knocking into his brain, wondering whether he would get it wrong just like Redbeard, he managed to keep his chin up and stroll onto the crime scene like he owned it, his trusting partner beside him and trying to keep up.

"Here, love, I got it," John said gently. So Sherlock dropped his hands by his sides and focused on watching John's hands tie the black garment underneath his collar.
"Could be dangerous," Sherlock joked as tears kept coming. He didn't expect John to do it. When hands turned him back around and short arms stretched to his shoulders Sherlock didn't know what to do. He didn't freeze, not really, he just didn't really move to do much else than slump into John.
"Because you love The Woman?"
"Sorry?"
"She's a baby, how bad could they be?" John asked as he turned his attention to the stove.
"Sherlock, I know you've learned it, he said so himself."
"What?"
"You know who she is?" Lestrade asked as Sally also kept quiet to hear Sherlock's answer.
Victor's wake :(
"You just answered your own question. I care deeply and completely, it has proven to be a fatal flaw more often than not." Clinical Sherlock had made a return and John felt like he was losing Sherlock to what he had been before, when they had first met.
"Don't worry. I've seen a lot of danger and I'm ready to see more." Sherlock caught a sob in his throat and finally held John back. "Sherlock, I am sorry that I ever hurt you. I promise that I will never again punch you or kick you or try to strangle you or anything that would put a mark on you. Okay?"
"Sherlock, please, just tell me." John's face was open, but serious, dead set on getting an answer from Sherlock. He held his breath, watching and hoping that he would see why it even mattered what Sherlock would say.
Sherlock took a deep breath. “Everything,” was the simple reply. John understood.
"I'm sorry," Sherlock said again.
Sherlock smiled at him, looking like a small part of him had finally come back from the well. “Starving.”
Sherlock's hair was windblown, ruffled in a delicate way with a few stray curls falling onto his porcelain skinned face. John wondered if it felt as smooth as it usually looked, which he realized was definitely not how best mates think about eachother. The angle of the light cast marvelous rays of shocking blue into his eyes, they glowed like lanterns as he posed perfectly to have his wondrous neck elongated as his profile shouted against dark stone walls.
"Well, you're gay, and I figure that there's nothing wrong with it and I might've been insensitive before."
"Like I said, Sherlock, It's all fine with me. It doesn't change the fact that you're my best friend."
"Looks like he's not hanging in there so much, mate," Lestrade whispered.
“Not a worry, I know you and Sherlock need to rest after all of this business,” Mrs. Hudson said as she patted John’s shoulder.
Sherlock frowned. "I'm sorry I made you feel like this."
Back to John's POV, let's play a game called "Who can see how many SIP parallels I put in the past three chapters" because even I just now saw them. John starts finally getting to root of what's up with Sherlock.
John had become interested in examining the stubs of what used to be fingers. "Well, do you want to?"
Sherlock had brought up the issue of going to see Eurus after the wake. John didn't want to hear of it, didn't want to speak of it, was revolted by the idea of his precious Sherlock going back there alone. He even called Mycroft to make sure that he wouldn't sneak there on his own. But Sherlock eventually made him listen and John eventually, stubbornly agreed that maybe it could do them both some good. But he still hated the idea.
"Yes. What Mycroft said, about you being ordinary? It's a lie. I know you're just as extraordinary as I am and so did Mary and so will Rosie."
John shifted a little. "Yeah, yeah I did. And I grieved you for a long time, too."
So they were taking the long walk back to the car, parked in front of the University of Westminster's Literature building.
Dinner passed silently. Sherlock ate as much as John would let him get away with because every time he thought about the well he felt like throwing up. John ate his whole plate. Then John looked over at Sherlock. "You're thinking again."
But he knew that just saying sorry wasn't good enough anymore. He needed to somehow do better without making worse of the situation.
"Sherlock, I know what happened while you were away. I've seen glimpses of them, while you were in hospital. I know that you have nightmares about it when you do sleep. I don't care if that changed you, that would change anyone, but I am so grateful that you're back here safe."
It must be morning.
He relishes the feeling of Johns fingers against his arm, as they continue the stroking motion.
time now.
John clears his throat, thinking about what to say now, not anticipating his partner in supporting him in this situation. He lets his eyes wander over the familiar faces before him. They all helped him and Sherlock through the many rough and many happy times that they've been through. Then he begins to speak.
Thank you for all the kudos and hits since yesterday!
You told me once, that I saved your life in many ways... well I only can say, you saved
Sure there are a few disagreements and rows here and there but after all this time Sherlock and John know now how the other one ticks and when to back down and let something be.
“Asked me what?” Sherlock instantly gets that the question has to do with him and glares at Molly, who stands before Sherlock with big eyes, like a deer caught in the floodlight.
He can make out Angelo himself, hiding in the back, grinning at them. Molly with her fiancé Andrew, Sherlock's parents, Mike Stamford, Mrs Hudson already on the brink of tears, Mycroft, still with little Rosie on his arm and standing very close to Greg and even Anderson, Donovan and Dimmock from Scotland Yard.
Slowly John puts away his gloves and puts them into his jacket, while taking a deep breath and letting it go.
Sherlock doesn't say a word. He doesn't say a word for a long time.
Maybe I will find the time to write a wedding chapter. I'd really love to wed these boys :)
He tastes the strong flavour of camomile tea, and lets it's soothing effect wash over him, while watching Sherlock turning the golden ring on his right ring finger around with his other hand.
“You really think I won't be able to make out where you take me, just because I'm not able to see?
