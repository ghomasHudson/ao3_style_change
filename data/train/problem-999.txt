“I’ve already cleared Sherlock’s room for him,” John said, running his hand through his hair. He leg started to ache. “If he wants to be here, I’ll have him.”
Harry arrived first, an hour after noon. Harry and him had always looked similar, both a bit on the shorter side with rounder features. Harry’s hair was darker and shoulder length, and she took after their mother with her full lips and curved wasit that made other girls go crazy. John greeted her and accepted a little longer than necessary hug before she pulled away and looked him up and down.
, why would they go after Oliver if it wasn’t for me being here in the first place? We have to talk to Mycroft, he must already have realized this.”
Their conversation wrapped up quickly, and John ended the call, elated to be able to see his sister again, it’d been over a year since their last face to face meeting and Harry had been sporting a bad hangover at the time. After he hung up, he sent a text to Lestrade, then after a moment of consideration, to Mycroft to see if they’d like to visit on New Year’s Eve. He knew Mrs Hudson would be delighted, and the only other person he’d like to invite was Molly.
” Oliver took a breath. “M-my hands are numb,” he murmured, taking his hand away from John’s chest to curl and uncurl it.
It was almost twenty minutes later, when Oliver had dressed in warmer clothing and John had started the fire that they sat on the floor with big mugs of tea. Oliver had his cup on the floor in front of him, his knees drawn up to his chest and chin on top of them. The boy stared intensely into the fire, his face blank, the flames flickering off his eyes and making them look brown.
John nodded. He didn’t want want happened at the hospital to be the case again. Leaving Sherlock in the waiting room. Oliver probably wouldn’t be in the emergency bay today, so it’d be fine - but in the future it’s safer to have both of them as legal parents.
Oliver lowered his hands and gently lifted the stunning black telescope from it’s packaging. He glanced between John and the telescope a few times, speechless, before finally stuttering out, “Th- thank you, thank you so much! God, this is gorgeous! Can - will you help me set it up? Right now? I want to use it as soon as it gets dark. Please? Wow, this is wonderful.”
Oliver was doing amazing in school, finally finding a way to balance the subjects he hates and the ones he likes. He grew like a weed, John noticed, when they had to go out and get him new clothes. He’d grown to almost John’s height already, and he hoped Oliver would slow down before he passed John. Knowing the Holmes’ genetics, though, it was inevitable.
Sherlock’s violin sat on top of John’s dresser, collecting dust and fading into the background. The skull found it’s home on a shelf in Oliver’s room eventually, and the boxes in the back of John’s closet became forgotten. Oliver inhabited the space around them, and often sat in the chair across from John. It was just ‘the other armchair’ now. John opened the fridge and cabinet without bracing himself for mold or body parts. He stopped seeing phantom movements of a coat or an extra pair of expensive shoes.
The second fic is only 4 chapters long and all four will be posted at the same time (I've already written them).
“He used to babble on endlessly,” she told John. “Bringing in all sorts of bugs and leaves to show me.”
Oliver stood on the couch, helping Mrs Hudson string fairy lights along the ceiling. Mrs Hudson swayed to the music, talking to Oliver about this and that. Oliver nodded along politely and stepped up onto the back of the couch to reach higher.
Summer moved slowly, the days dry and humid. The sun doesn’t always come out, but when it did John and Oliver took walks through the park. Once in awhile Oliver asked if they could go out with his telescope at night, wanting to keep up with what his club had been studying during the school year. Some days things were quiet around the flat, and they could go hours without a word spoken between them. John sat in his chair, typing or reading or watching the telly, and Oliver sat in the other armchair, drawing or twisting the rubik’s cube. On days like those, John wondered why he was ever hesitant about bringing this boy into his life. Everything seemed frozen peacefully in time, not a whisper could be heard from the outside world, only the serenity and soft movement from inside the castle they’d built around themselves. And then - John understood what Oliver meant when he said it felt like he was the only grounded person in the world, and everything else was rushing around him.
Oliver stayed in his room most of the day, which was fine. John checked on him a few times and each time he was sat in front of his closed window where snow lightly fell outside, headphones on and drawing book balanced on his legs. It was serene and John, not being able to help himself, lifted his phone and snapped a picture of him, intending on showing his grandparents to embarrass him.

John hadn’t thought much about where Sherlock will sleep when Mrs Hudson returns from her sister’s house, because they didn’t know how long she’d be gone and Sherlock couldn’t sleep on the couch forever. Oliver sure as hell won’t give up his room, and John wouldn’t even think to make him. That room belonged to Oliver now. For a moment, John considered putting a second bed in his room, but there were so many reasons that wouldn’t work and before his brain could start listing them, Sherlock interrupted.
“What are you talking about?” Oliver’s hands felt numb. This was wrong. Wrong, wrong wrong, wrong. Everything about this was wrong.
He made his decision, and let the flat. The clock on his phone read almost one in the afternoon, and he figured he’d aim to be back home by two. He crept past Mrs Hudson’s and out the flat, shutting the door softly. He didn’t know if John had told her to keep an eye on him or not.
“Great!” She says, uncrossing and crossing her legs. “Gen and I have been crazy busy because she has a huge family and all of them have been visiting, and we’re trying to book a venue early but money is pretty tight right now. So we don’t actually have a date yet, but I don’t really mind and neither does Gen.”
He said yes, but it he felt like he was doing something wrong when he did. Anna came off as friendly enough, even if she couldn’t keep her work organized and talked louder than she needed. John sat with her for lunch at a busy sandwich shop, where the friendly murmur of people somewhat settled the suspicious anxiety rising in John’s stomach.
“Shh,” John hushed. He didn’t want to let go of him, but he needed to make sure Oliver didn’t have other injuries. “I need to know how you feel. What hurts, can you breath okay?”
At the flat John told Oliver to get in the shower and take his time. Oliver nodded, kicking off his dripping shoes. He started unbuttoning his shirt as he head towards the bathroom.
Oliver shifted, sitting up straight in his chair. “For how long? Who? Were there anymore? Wait - was it one of Uncle Mycroft's?”
John sighed, tearing his eyes from Sherlock and looking down. Sherlock walked forward, and put his hand on John’s shoulder. John closed his eyes, wanting desperately to lean into him, and then Sherlock pressed his forehead against John’s and they stayed there like that. Just breathing each other in - once again, in silence.
He smiled, “How’ve you been, Har?” She grins, white teeth showing, practically bubbling over with excitement. He knows she wants to tell him all about the wedding planning and everything.
John glanced at the boy again. His feet had dropped back to the ground and he bent over the notebook, his pencil running all over the page, concentration by the set of his shoulders. Oliver still felt like a mystery yet to be solved.
He took a cab home with the bags and put everything away in their kitchen, then cleaned up a bit. He needed something to do. He did need a distraction for when Oliver went to school.
Later into the night while he was talking to a few people he knew from Bart’s, someone tugged his sleeve and he turned to see Emily, fidgeting with her hands and looking nervous.
John folded his arms and leaned on the windowsill, and listened to Oliver name as many stars as he could.
Oliver’s bedroom door was still shut, so instead of seeing if Oliver wanted to eat with them (John knew he didn’t), he made extra eggs and bacon and put the plate in the oven to keep it warm for whenever Oliver came out of his room. John handed Sherlock his own plate, and they sat across from each other at the table to eat.
John’s dreams that night twisted through his mind like spirals of shadows. He ran from a bullet and into a busy street full of cars, then stepped in a puddle and found himself sinking miles below water. Something warm pulled him out, then he was staring up at the roof of Bart’s, the sun nearly blinding him until a shadow jumped and plummet towards the ground.
“Truly, John,” Violet said. “I’m grateful to you. I think he really trusts you, and that’s a big deal for Oliver.”
John leaned his elbow on his knee and rubbed his face. Then rather dejectedly, asked, “Tell me when you have him, yeah?”
to be said, but John couldn’t find the words. One thing popped into mind, and he went with it. “Where did you stay last night?”
He saw Sherlock’s hand crinkle the paper he was holding. John sighed, then readjusted his laptop and settled into working again. After a moment, so did Sherlock. They worked in mostly silence until both of them were too frustrated to continue. John felt like they were making zero progress, no matter how much they dug.
After this crisis Sherlock became a man. Hitherto—if human beings can be estimated—he had not been worth anyone's affection, but ambivalent, confused, dissembling to others, because to himself. Now he had the highest gift to offer. He still suffered, yet a sense of triumph had come elsewhere. Pain had shown him a niche behind the world's judgements, whither he could withdraw. There was still much to learn, and years passed before he explored certain other abysses in his being—horrible enough they were. But he discovered the method and looked no more at scratches in the sand. He had awoken too late for happiness, but not for strength, and could feel an austere joy, as of a warrior who is homeless but stands fully armed.
From this to the boys, the halls crammed with their noise and smells, and Sherlock standing aloof, quite alone. "Sir, are you here for Holmes...? Sir, take me along! Sir, take me! Oh sir, did you hear that? Rush says the Headmaster’s on his way! ... I didn't! Green eye! Green eye! When you have quite finished—! Sir! Take us, sir! We haven’t had our tea yet! Oh please, sir!”
He read it through once, then got up and poured himself another drink, downing it in one. He read it again, struggling to understand.
It was not until the final week of the Trevors’ holiday that a letter finally arrived for Sherlock. In spite, he pinned it to his mantle with a letter knife and ignored it for a full day, but that night, unable to sleep, he poured himself a whisky and at last tore it open.
Sherlock Holmes swept into the experimental xenophysics wing of Diogenes Laboratories and crushed the cigarette he'd been smoking furiously under his heel.
"... will not return." Meaning coalesced from the humming sound around them, almost without the intervention of words, or of language.
"Evidently the nurse," said Sherlock thoughtfully. "I wish you had told me before.... I knew something had gone wrong and thought of several things, but not this. One oughtn't to keep secrets, or they get worse. One ought to talk, talk, talk—provided one has someone to talk to, as you and I have. If you'd have told me, you would have been right by now."
Without a moment's hesitation he set out for the boat-house at Penge. Those words had got into his blood, they were part of John, and of his own promise in that last desperate embrace. They were all he had to go by. He left Southampton as he had come to it—instinctively—and he felt that not merely things wouldn't go wrong this time but that they daren't, and that the universe had been put in its place. A little local train did its duty, a gorgeous horizon still glowed, and inflamed cloudlets which flared when the main glory faded, and there was even enough light for him to walk up from the station at Penge through quiet fields.
Sherlock had not responded to Victor’s letter, thinking to hurt him the same way he had been hurt. Victor wrote once more, advising him that he had returned to London, and asking him not to visit “until his mind was steadier about it all.” Sherlock, of course, entirely ignored this. He made for the Trevor home at the first possible opportunity.
"Well, as you like of course. Anne has almost uncanny insight, though, and she’s no shrinking violet. You can tell her nearly anything."
I have taken certain liberties with several more or less commonly accepted theories, but I assure you that those theories have not been violated altogether in ignorance. Some of them I myself believe sound, others I consider unsound, still others are out of my line, so that I am not well enough informed upon their basic mathematical foundations to have come to any definite conclusion, one way or the other. Still, it is my belief that there is no scientific impossibility to be found herein.
Sherlock didn’t break eye contact with the boy as he put his notebook on the mantle and moved across the sitting room to thump onto the couch with his arms crossed. John didn’t know what to expect, and it looked like Sherlock didn’t either but was going to accept whatever came at him.
Then he was gone. John sighed and peered through the kitchen doorway down the hall. Sherlock’s door -
Sherlock stood there for a moment, quiet, his eyes flicking all over Oliver’s face, his jaw tight. Oliver practically mickied the position, his fists clenched. John felt out of place, but he couldn’t bring himself to leave the room, desperately wanting to know what they were saying and if he should stop them.
Sherlock shut his eyes and rubbed his face. “Moriarty arranged a sniper to be on Mrs Hudson, Lestrade and you at all times. The only way to recall them was if they saw me jump. I figured Moriarty must have some kind of other recall code, just in case things went wrong, but before I could get anything from him he shot himself in the head. I
The creature's scales flared up, mineral red, and he slammed his fist into the impervious glass. Sherlock jumped.
There was a long interval: they picked at their food and discussed the motor bicycle, which had never been heard of again, until the coffee had been served and the ladies retired. As early as they could, they made their excuses and retired to Victor’s study where they could resume their conversation more freely.
Men hate to be fussed, she knew, so she only replied, "I'm frightfully sorry, I'll send some ice to your room."
"Victor's out," said the young hostess artlessly when they met. "He sends you his love or something, and will be in to dinner. Archie will valet for you if you wish? But I don't believe you want looking after."
Now Victor put other thoughts aside and prepared to sympathize, though he wished the appeal had come when he was less busy. His sense of proportion supported him. He led the way to the deserted alley behind the laurels, where evening primroses gleamed, and embossed with faint yellow the walls of night. Here they would be most solitary. Feeling for a bench, he reclined full length on it, put his hands behind his head, and said, "I'm at your service, but my advice is sleep the night here, and consult Anne in the morning."
Finally, Sherlock blinked. To Mycroft's surprise, he looked down at his hands, which were shaking. When he spoke, his voice was low. "Your experiments – they cause him pain. Agony. Have you observed? Have you--have you spoken to him, afterward? His name is John, you know. John Watson. A British citizen. And you're torturing him. It must not go on. There are other ways to learn."
Later that night, Sherlock opened his notebook to record careful notes on every observation he had made. For him, the drive to understand the unknown had always seemed as vital as his baser physical drives--
“No, no. Calm yourself,” Mycroft said, taking his arm and pulling him into an alcove between two bustling storehouses. “I am only here to speak a little with you, if you’ll listen. To be frank, I have been far from easy about you, brother. I have always tried to do my best for you: to guide and protect you, to nurture your mind, to instill healthy habits, and to allow you room to develop into your own kind of man. It is a difficult task to balance, and I fear—” here Sherlock snorted, but Mycroft continued, undisturbed, “I fear I have misjudged certain pieces of advice. Children are more impressionable than the outsider supposes. For good and for evil, they absorb their elders’ words uncritically, and those words become their own. Sherlock, I have lately been considering whether some of my words to you, spoken in earnest desire of aiding you, might in fact have had the opposite effect."
Molly came late, the roads were bad, but John hugged her and told her she looked wonderful in the simple red sweater she wore. Her niece Emily looked a little less than excited to be there, but stayed mostly quiet and stuck to Molly’s side. Molly avoided looking at Oliver, like John had in the beginning, but politely shook his hand before looking away and asking Lestrade about work. Oliver truly didn’t seem to mind. Everything ran nicely, if John ignored the slight awkward underlying tension.
No, he couldn’t fix himself and “going back to before” didn’t exist. He just didn’t know how to start a new life altogether. Maybe going back to therapy would be a good first step.
When she finished cooking, she put together plates for everyone, even Sherlock who said he wasn’t hungry, and John sat at the table with Mrs Hudson and Oliver. Oliver mostly pushed his food around with the fork, taking an occasional bite while listening to John and Mrs Hudson’s small talk.
The day of New Year’s Eve, John, Mrs Hudson and Oliver worked on reheating all the food in the oven and cooking more biscuits and bread. The flat smelt wonderful, and they lit the fire again to keep it warm.
She pat his shoulder, “You don’t look sick, though. Now show me up to the flat I’ve heard about and have yet to see.”
“I don’t have friends,” Oliver sneered at her. Emily dropped her pencil and rolled her eyes. He couldn’t stand her. Only two more tutoring sessions and he’d be able to afford those paints he wanted.
They spent the next day in the town over, going to all the cliche tourist shops and passing a bag of sweets between them the entire day. Oliver would throw pieces up in the air and catch them in his mouth, and John would find ridiculous hats to put on the boy while he wasn’t looking.
John sighed again and leaned his cheek in his hand, watching Oliver draw from across the room. Since when did John start to care so much again?
The fighting continued, Oliver shouting and Sherlock trying not to get worked up, the French moving past their lips so quick John couldn’t pick out the few words he did know, their speech overlapping and escalating until John decided he needed to stop them before they started throwing things.
John and Sherlock got up and followed her through the halls. Oliver had his own room again, probably because the staff knew from last time. The doctor opened the door, and they stepped through.
At one in the morning, John had yet to fall asleep. He stared up and counted the headlights that flashed across his ceiling and the heartbeats between them until he heard the front door open and shut. He knew it was Sherlock finally coming home, and his heart ached in his chest.
John confirmed it and said goodbye just as Oliver’s door opened. John leaned through the living room doorway to see the boy stumble out of his room, eyes lidded and skin pale. Oliver paused in the hallway and put his hand on the wall, yawning and rubbing his eyes.
“Um,” John rubbed the back of his neck. “I guess I realized I need to sort myself out. I’ve been moping around long enough and I’ve found a reason to stop.”
The situation with Molly was similar to Harry. Molly had tried calling him in the weeks preceding Sherlock’s death, but he never answered. John glanced at the clock, and figuring she’d be out of work by now, swallowed his anxiety and called her.
Oliver nodded. “The boys that were messing with me got transferred out of the school. Some of the teachers from drugs in their lockers and proof of harassment so they got moved to a correctional school.”
John sat by the window with his coffee on Saturday morning, his streak of bad nights continuing and making it extremely difficult to do anything. Oliver came out of his room a few hours before noon, his headphones over his ears. He sat down in John’s armchair again, crossing his legs beneath him on the cushion and opening the notebook he had left there.
John had work on Monday, at eight, which he didn’t mind. At least it wasn’t the opening shift. Oliver was already in the living room when John stepped out of the bathroom, hair still wet and dressed in a soft green jumper.
It took close to half an hour to calm her down (she started shouting after her initial shock faded away). They ended up standing in the living room, Mrs Hudson’s arm around Sherlock’s waist while she halfheartedly scolded him. Sherlock looked thoroughly chastised and a little embarrassed while she rambled on and John listened with amusement. She suddenly cut herself off and gasped, looking to John.
He told her about Oliver, because he saw no reason not to. She asked some questions, but listened and wrote while he talked. John asked why he felt so worried for the boy already and Ella smiled and said it’s instinct.
gone, and they are, which eased his anxiety a little bit. He’d have to face them sooner or later. He preferred later.
John curled his hands on the wooden table and closed his eyes. “Sherlock had more friends than he thought.”
He turned on the telly for background noise, then opened up the document he had been writing in for almost a year. John knew none of it would ever be posted onto his blog. That was a thing of the past, and he talked about so many personal things - his life with Oliver, those months after Sherlock’s death, thoughts he had on bad days, his confusion - all of it needed to stay private. Someday he might just delete all of it. Not any day soon, but in the future when he didn’t need to write to think.
Molly answered sounding dead tired, but delighted to hear from him. She had been working extra hours at Bart’s and John realized with a sinking feeling that she probably took Sherlock’s death just as bad as John had. He felt terrible now, for never calling her or checking in, and told her so.
“Really?” Oliver looked up, his face hopeful. He looked so much younger when his face lit up like that, and his hair was extra messy today, curls sticking up all over the place.
“Yes, I’ll help,” Mycroft said. “It’d do you well to call my parents, talk to them about it. I know they’ve wanted this for a while and were hesitant about your reaction.”
John shook his head. “We asked him, and he was concerned about it.” John started to explain that Mycroft had done some digging and found a small organization in London connected to Moriarty’s people. Of course Oliver new all about that - it had been on the news for months, and though John and him never really talked about it, Oliver knew what it meant to him and Sherlock.
There. Oliver had his back against the railing, and three taller boys were harassing him, pulling at his shirt, shoving him around and tugging at his hair. Oliver was trying to push them away, shielding his face, but they were laughing and kept him cornered.
When they were done, they cooked cinnamon buns in the kitchen together, making more of a mess than probably necessary, then attempted chess again.
A few minutes later, Sherlock came back to the flat and didn’t say anything. Oliver didn’t look up from his sketchbook. John met Sherlock’s eyes over the top of his book, as the man walked towards them and hesitantly sunk into his old arm chair, his hands in his lap and his eyes moving about the room. John continued reading his book.
“No,” John said, his voice raising with emotion. His eyes flicked to Oliver’s hair and he reached up to pull a strand of grass out of it. “God, I was so scared you were hurt, or that I’d never see you again.” John’s grip on his arms tighten and the man met his eyes again. “You can’t do that. Ever. Please, don’t ever do that again, I - I thought -”
That’s how John found himself on the phone with Sarah (he had hoped it would be anyone else) one evening, setting up an interview for his old position. He went in the next day, and Sarah sat across from him at a table, but didn’t ask all the usual questions. She didn’t mention his cane or the reasons he left, and John was grateful for that.
They laid their cheeks together and began laughing. The smash struck them as extraordinarily funny. Father’s present too! He had given it to Sherlock against his coming of age. Trevor said, "How if we left it and walked?"
They met as arranged, and packed on a picnic lunch and a bottle of wine. But as they threaded Jesus Lane they were hailed by the Dean.
That night they walked for hours, silently, animated by frenetic, unnatural energy. In the dark, they stopped only once under the bright canopy of stars, poised at the crossroads between longing and dread, desire and hopelessness. Victor clasped Sherlock’s hand and brought it to his lips. Something of exquisite beauty arose in the mind of each at last, something unforgettable and eternal, but built of the humblest scraps of speech and from the simplest emotions.
"Cleared him out quickest, didn’t it? I assume we don’t want to be caught out.” Trevor looked chagrined. “Meet me at the garage in twenty minutes. I must dress. Bring some of that cocaine, too, would you?” Sherlock was feeling reckless, almost dizzy. He’d never experienced anything quite like it. In the grip of the drug, he was powerful and unconcerned with consequences. “Where do you find it, anyway?"
"The next window of opportunity in the earth's electromagnetic fluxographic cycle will commence in approximately 12 hours," Sherlock announced suddenly.
?" He spat out the last word as if it had a bitter taste. "This situation has the potential to develop into a serious threat to national – to
"Brain problems. I was in a spin, you see; didn’t know what to think, at all. Couldn’t deduce a thing about you. I detest such blindness. I didn't come or write because I wanted to get away from you without wanting you. You won't understand. You kept dragging me back and I got awfully frightened. I felt you every time I tried to sleep. You came hard at me. I knew something was wrong but couldn't tell what, so kept pretending it was you. Kept telling myself you meant me harm. It wasn’t you, though, was it?"
Victor flushed up again, but said nothing this time. “Well,” he said, “in that case, let’s have a drink and a smoke, and a bit of this cocaine, and go out in the rain. This room is stifling me.”
"Hum. How about August? Not September, that's almost certainly the by-election. But come in August and see us through that awful Park v. Village cricket match."
Trevor was not well over vac, and came up a few days late. When his face, paler than usual, peered round the door, Sherlock had a spasm of despair, and tried to recollect where they stood last term, and to gather up the threads of the campaign. He felt himself slack, and afraid of action. The terrified part of himself rose to the surface, and urged him to solitude. “Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock,” he heard Mycroft’s voice say. And yet—
"Most grotesque," the voice echoed, "but I felt after all I owe you I ought to come and tell you. I want to be truthful, when I can."
Mycroft raised an eyebrow. "Don't be ridiculous. There's a vast difference between being 'frightened off,' as you say, and knowing when you are simply wasting effort. As you remember, I tried previously to ... engage ... on more than one occasion, and without meaningful success."
Sherlock shuddered. He clenched his teeth, and a great mass of sorrow that had overwhelmed him by rising to the surface began to sink. He could feel it going down into his heart until he was conscious of it no longer.
you, regardless of what you may believe. There are scientific inquiries we can pursue that will solve the mystery of--of
"You're so soft, Sherlock. Your skin is -- it's beautiful. I feel a little bit of stubble against my fingers, but it's soft. So, so soft... It's different from--from how everything felt before."
“Good morning!” young Mrs. Trevor trilled as he approached the breakfast room. Then she saw his face, which was greenwhite, and cried, "Oh, but you're not well."
"Assuming the creature is telling the truth, and isn't just insane or a pathological liar," Anderson smirked.
There was a pause. "There are no errors in our inter-personal data spectrometer readings; we are quite certain. But perhaps we misunderstand the term as your species uses it. We apologize. No further harm will come to your... John Watson."
Sherlock stared gloomily before him, but Victor tapped him on the shoulder. "Comedy of Errors, not Tragedy,” he said playfully. “You can apologize now."
Carefully, she resisted the urge to punch him. "For John, then." She followed him down the corridor and began the most outrageously sarcastic mimicry of flirtation Sherlock had ever seen. He sighed, inwardly. Not an actor, then, Molly.
One of the dreams started on the embankment, where Oliver fell, but the railing was missing. John looked down at the black water, then at Oliver, standing in front of him. Oliver smiled and shoved John in the chest, pushing him off the wall. John fell in slow motion, reaching up, and just as he hit the ice water, Oliver vanished in a burst of black ravens.
A beautiful charcoal drawing filled the canvas, of the two arm chairs sitting in front of the unlit fireplace. The attention to detail made it look like a black and white photograph, the crinkles in the leather of Sherlock’s chair, and the blanket hanging off the back of John looked like it might actually be a swaying piece of fabric rather than a drawing.

Time flew by, now that John had something to do during the day. The first week passed smoothly and John slept full nights (with only a few nightmares) again since work tended to tire him out. Mornings were a little chaotic since they both had to be ready and out of the flat at the same time, but it was the familiar chaos John felt used to. Familiarity was good. Safe, even. Boredom - not so much.
John smiled at him, wondering how he was only fifteen years old and already thinking like that. “Of course not. You don’t have to put yourself in a box.”
Mrs Hudson knocked on the door while he was in the middle of scrubbing the counter tops, and John called for her to come in. She had a smile and a container of biscuits.
His phone beeped and he checked to see Oliver’s message saying he made to to the park fine. John was just worried, that’s all. He knew Oliver would be safe, but he didn’t trust… other people. Especially after what happened with the dumpster.
. I know the updates are a bit weird for this story, but you're getting the chapters much faster than you normally would! :)
The door creaked open and Oliver stood in the doorway, eyes wide. The moonlight that streamed through John’s room lit up Oliver’s skin, making him even more pale, and the dark curls framing his face blend into the shadows behind him. He was taking shaking breaths, and his grip on the door handle was tight.
Oliver’s face turned beat red, and he took her hand, nodding. “Y-you too- er, nice to meet you. Too.”
“Dizzy-” Oliver gasped, shutting his eyes tight. John nodded, moved to the side, then guided Oliver until his head was tucked between his knees. Oliver crossed his arms over his head, gasping for breath while John put a steady hand on his shoulder. This wasn’t a bad one, and Oliver didn’t take long to come out of it.
At the end of their vacation, exactly a week after they arrived, John and Oliver packed up to go home, tanned and content to leave. Oliver kept smiling without realizing it, and John felt a warmth in his chest like the sun. While a little sad that they had to leave, they each were glad to get back to London.
“I wouldn’t change what I did,” Sherlock said, voice low. He looked down at the table. “But I did regret it everyday while I was out there.”
. John why those two years were harder on him more than anyone else. It was more than just losing a best friend, and John was starting to realize maybe Sherlock thought the same thing. They loved each other. He realized both of them knew it, but neither of them would say it.
So, when John came to visit on the fifth day in the hospital, Oliver was pretty relieved to hear that he’d probably be going home.
Emily’s face changed in the blink of an eye, and she scowled at him. “Your stupid hair is in the way, and I can’t see what you’re doing.”
Oliver’s door opening broke the moment, and they both looked into the hall to see Oliver scowl at Sherlock, then walk into the bathroom and shut the door with more force than necessary.
Okay so... here's the thing. I know you guy are getting a lot of "Oliver and his friends" in these past few chapters. It needs to happen though, because I'm setting up all the plot lines. Oliver has his own story in this fic, just like John and Sherlock have theirs (and everything intertwines). I hope you guys don't mind though, and thank you for bearing with me.
“I’ll get some from the café downstairs,” Oliver said, zipping up his bag. He picked up the mug and took a big gulp, apparently not minding that it had just boiled.
"Of course, John," Sherlock said helplessly. "Of course I'd help. I'll--I'll always be here for you."
"Are you going back into college?" asked Trevor without looking up: he was kneeling over a castle of pianola records on the floor.
"I want a row and I'll have it. Surely you owe me that much." He came in his oldest manner and thrust a hand into Victor's hair. "Sit down. Now why did you write me that letter?"
"Hush," cried Victor, with a glance at darkness. Reassured, he said stiffly, "What a grotesque announcement."
“Why should we be slaves to our base impulses, after all?” Victor would ask, when Sherlock occasionally expressed admiration or desire for Victor’s quite lovely physical form. “We love each other—you know we do, and that shall not change—why need we debase ourselves?”
Someone might hear him. He wept stifled in the sheets, but a terrible energy overtook him. He sprang up kicking, then struck his head against the wall and smashed the crockery. It was intolerable. Someone did come up the stairs. He grew quiet at once and did not recommence when the footsteps died away. Lighting a candle, he looked with surprise at his torn pyjama and damaged room. He continued to cry, for he could not stop, but the suicidal point had been passed, and he lay down and miraculously slept. Madness is not for everyone, but Sherlock’s first storm proved a shocking cataclysm. The storm had been working up not for three days as he supposed, but for six years. It took six full days for him to master himself even moderately again.
Sherlock coloured. "My parents insisted I learn when I was a boy. I'm sorry, I know it’s silly. I don't know what I was thinking. Never mind." Quickly, he tucked the instrument back into its case and slid it under the lab bench, out of sight.
"I suppose..." she said at last, haltingly and uncertain, "I suppose the existence of this extraordinary creature demands an extraordinary explanation."
Sherlock tutted. "I think you know me better than that.  I've got three pumps I can put on that job, in series. First, a Rodebush-Michalek super-pump; then, backing that, an ordinary mercury-vapor pump; and last, backing both the others, a Cenco-Hyvac motor-driven oil pump. In less than... let’s estimate fifty hours from now, the inoson scanner will be charged enough for efficacy. Just to make sure of eliminating the last infinitesimal traces of impurities, though, I'm going to flash a gatter charge of tantalum through it. After that, the atmosphere in the case will project an image of the energy patterns of the surrounding area onto a calibrated visi-plate. Take my word for it. It’s going to work."
"Christ," John muttered. "It's not better when you're not here." He slumped heavily on the floor, a picture of defeat.
Tea, very bitter, was awaiting them, and Mrs Trevor looked one way while she poured out the other. People stood about, all looking distinguished or there for some distinguished reason. They were doing things or causing others to do them, all perfectly at their ease. Miss Trevor booked him to canvass tomorrow for Tariff Reform. He agreed without thinking as a matter of course; but the cry with which she greeted his alliance did not please him. "Mother, Mr Holmes is sound." Major Western, a cousin also stopping in the house, would ask him about Oxford. Did Army men mind one being sent down? In all, it was worse than the restaurant, for there Victor had been out of his element too.
Mycroft Holmes drove quickly to the rear parking lot of the laboratory complex. Pulling into his reserved stall by the private rear door, he sat in stillness for a moment. He did not relish the task he had before him, but it was necessary, he reminded himself. And he had always been the man to accept the necessary but distasteful tasks – it was the secret of his expansive power and influence with his country’s government. This was no different from any of the many experiments he had carried out in the past -- for the greater good.
"My thoughts exactly. Silicone-based chemicals would be more stable than equivalent hydrocarbons in a sulfuric-acid-rich environment, as is found in some extraterrestrial locations. Silicon compounds may possibly be biologically useful under temperatures or pressures different from the surface of a terrestrial planet, either in conjunction with or in a role less directly analogous to carbon. I've argued for some time -- in several top-tier journals, mind you -- that since polysilanols are soluble in liquid nitrogen, they could play a role in very low temperature alien biochemistry."
Without a word, he spun on his heel and left the room. Within two minutes, he had returned with Molly's silver compact.
Victor looked pained. "No. I shouldn't have said that. But do leave me now. I can’t bear to have you here. I can’t—I can’t trust myself to stay right."
The creature’s flesh had so far proved impervious to all his attempts to pierce it, to learn from it, but he was certain his latest tool—a blade made of experimental wurtzite boron nitride—would be more than adequate to the task.
"I'm going to walk out with Holmes alone." There were cries of disappointment. The older boys, seeing that it was no good, called the pack off, and marshaled the younger back to class. Sherlock, with ostentatious nonchalance, slouched to Mycroft’s side. He was a slender, pretty lad, gangly and awkwardly tall. In this, too, he resembled his brother, who had passed in the procession almost ten years before, and vanished into university and then to the public service.
"We'd all enjoy that, yes," Sherlock replied absently. He'd dropped to his knees and was gazing at the creature's abdomen with rapt attention.
The hum twisted in the air, an almost palpable thing, and the sound rose and rose to a near-unbearable pitch. All the humans within range slapped their hands over their ears, writhing in pain. Mycroft, who stood in the centre of the brilliant ring of light and who had thus experienced the most direct blast of the Martian's – annoyance? – fell to his knees, gasping.
"Sherlock, it mustn't end like this—not a row," Victor implored. He rushed to insert himself between Sherlock and the study door, blocking the way. "Sit down and talk to me."
Sherlock examined Wilkes's room minutely, and then sat on the table and looked at Trevor. He was a small-boned man with facile manners and a freckled face, which had flushed when Sherlock blundered in. In the college he had a reputation for garrulousness and also for exclusive taste. Almost the only thing Sherlock had heard about him was that he "went out too much," and this meeting in Magdalen rather confirmed it.
"We want to be kind to you—naturally. When one's happy oneself one wants the same happiness for others."
"What did he say?" he asked at last. A long talk threatened, and the boy knew there would be no way to put Mycroft off.
"Very good, sir." He straightened out a pair of socks and continued meditatively: "Oh, they've moved that ladder at last, I see. About time."
"I've thought more often of you than you imagine, Sherlock my dear,” Victor ventured to say. “As I said last autumn, I care for you in the real sense, and always shall. We were young idiots, weren't we?—but one can get something even out of idiocy. Development. No, more than that, intimacy. You and I know and trust one another just because we were once idiots.” Victor clasped his hand between his own and kissed him very gently on each of his fingers.
As he played, the now-smooth surface of John’s body shimmered, shook, then slowly changed, revealing the seams of its interlocking scales. Sherlock had seen a version of this physiological response before, but as the music continued, it intensified and transformed. In slow waves that crested in time with the music, the scales pulled back, retracting, opening, and before Sherlock’s astonished eyes, began to emit something – something indescribable. Emerging from the creature’s newly textured skin were wispy tendrils of sound-made-visible: almost--but not quite – corporeal.
There was a sound like metal rubbing against stone from the creature. Sherlock had no idea what it meant. It was infuriating to be so entirely clueless. It was
"Thanks—most awfully." Sherlock felt terribly awkward. He kept thinking about that strange, swooping twist in his gut. About the way Trevor had looked at him.
Victor resumed. "By the way, can you come down to Penge next week? It's short notice, but later all will be chaos."
John snorted. "I wouldn't know enough to name a single song. Haven't had anything to do with proper music since my school days. Played clarinet in the junior orchestra for two years -- that's the extent of my musical knowledge and training."
Sherlock saw through the brassiness to the misery behind it, but what was the use of this insight? No amount of insight would prevent the Normannia from sailing. He had lost—and the worst of it was that John was right. Surely it would be better for him, for his life’s ambitions, to go to India as intended. Suffering was certain for him, though it might soon end for John; when he got out to his new life he would forget his escapade with a gentleman and in time he would marry. He was pragmatic. He was correct. Meanwhile, John had already crammed his graceful body into his hideous blue suit. His face stuck out of it pale with emotion, his hands sun-browned. He plastered his hair flat. "Well, I'm off," he said, and as if that wasn't enough said, "Pity we ever met, really, if you come to think of it."
. He could still feel his heartbeat in his throat, and he just wanted to go back to the hospital. Oliver didn’t deserve to wake up alone. John didn’t want Oliver to
About an hour later John didn’t really feel any different than he did before, but now he knew the first few things he could work on. He headed to the shop to buy some groceries. He had enough money in his bank account, the number hadn’t changed in months (probably Mycroft’s doing, as much as John didn’t want to acknowledge it). He just bought the basics so they would make it through the week, figuring he’d bring Oliver to the store with him on Saturday so the boy could pick what he liked.
They try the beach again, going around lunchtime the next day when Oliver looked a little more comfortable and there are less people. They find a place close the water, but shaded by the cliffs. John stood ankle deep in the water, breathing in the smell the ocean and digging his toes into the soft sand.
“Is Sherlock going to move into your room, then?” She asked, leaned over the sink to wash some dishes.
Sherlock obviously didn’t know what to do with himself and John didn’t know what to say. It was just… awkward. And
Heel of his palm to Oliver’s chest. One, two, three, four… until thirty. Breathe. Check for a pulse. Still nothing.
Emily jumped in, “Okay, let’s talk about this.” She pointed to Oliver’s easel, at the unfinished project propped up on it. It was supposed to be a painting of his grandparent’s garden, vibrant flowers accompanied by butterflies that often flew around during sunset. He started it before John sent him back after Sherlock’s return, and since then he couldn’t find the motivation to continue. The colors would look uneven and he wasn’t in the right mindset for the painting to flow together.
“Well,” Sarah lifted and dropped her shoulder. “We’re shorthanded right now, and could use someone with your level of experience.”
Splashing and coughing from the darkness below let John know Oliver was still somewhat above the water. “Stop thrashing, you’ll drown yourself!” John shouted, a moment too late. The thrashing stopped. Oliver was under.
Sherlock seemed to agree, and leaving all the papers where they were, they decided to search the flat once more for cameras or microphones. They search the halls top to bottom and all the rooms except Oliver’s since he was sleeping. They double checked that all the doors leading out and windows are locked, and don’t find a single thing. The mic Oliver found yesterday must have just been one they missed somehow.
Do you think I handled John's grief well? Did you like the scene with Harry? Let me know in the comments!
Monday came quickly, the weekend passing in awkward silences and forced questions (John) without answers (Oliver). John had scheduled a therapy appointment with Ella for 9:30 and Oliver had to leave for school at 8:00 to be there on time. John’s alarm clock blared to life way earlier than he had gotten used to the past few months. He didn’t get out of bed for almost half an hour. When he finally did, he made his way to the kitchen leaning heavier on his cane than he usually would. He could hear Oliver shuffling around in his room.
He slunk out of bed and got dressed, then made his way downstairs into the bathroom to wash his face and brush his teeth. Just as he was about to turn on the water heater for tea, a hesitant knock sounded on the front door. John shut his eyes and took a breath, then let Sherlock into the flat.
“Just be careful,” John said. He looked down at the glass all over the floor, glad he had shoes on. Oliver didn’t. “Did you step on any?
Molly laughed, had Emily thanked John and then left the flat, another gust of wind and snow blowing in. John sighed with relief now that everyone left and turned back to face Oliver and Mrs Hudson. Oliver’s eyes stayed glued to the door, his face still red.
John refused to push him into talking and if he tried, he’s sure Oliver wouldn’t be able to hear him through the headphones. So they sat in silence. John stared at a black search page on his laptop. He had nothing else to do, and didn’t know how to get back into his old way of life. What even was there before Sherlock? Suicidal tendencies, that’s what.
Caden turned to face him, a few steps away, and smirked at him. “Well, I ruined you and it took them this long to notice.”
Everything felt weird. As if yesterday was dream, or it happened to someone else. Truthfully, when he had woken up in the hospital this morning, a part of himself felt... disappointed, more than anything. Disappointed he woke up. Disappointed he had made it through bleeding out and through the surgery. Disappointed in himself. He didn't want to have to deal with everything. With John, or Sherlock, the physical pain, the emotional pain,
“Didn’t he stay at your aunt's house the other night?” Oliver asked. “You seemed shocked to see him.”
“How old are you anyways?” she asked him and he sighed, not intending on holding up a conversation. “You’re small. You look like a skeleton.”
And John laughed. The metaphorical glass that separated them shattered in an instant, and Sherlock choked out a laugh too. It started quiet, then blew into full blown laughs, both of them probably looking insane to poor Mrs Hudson. John could feel his chest tighten, he wanted to cry and scream but all he could do right now was laugh.
John didn’t know how long he’d be gone, but as soon as the man left the building John felt an odd pressure lift from his chest and he took a deep breath. Everything was complicated again, and he didn’t know how to fix it. He ended up walking downstairs to talk with Mrs Hudson for a bit.
Oliver eyes flicked back and forth between John’s, wide and then understanding. He swallowed and nodded. “O-okay. Okay, I’ll try.”
She waved him away. “Make sure you get Ollie home soon, he’s only going to get worked up the longer you keep him waiting.”
“I have something for you,” Oliver said. He got up from his spot on the couch and rushed through the kitchen to his room. He came back a moment later with thin rectangular canvas, about a foot tall. He sat back down cross-legged facing John on the couch and held out the canvas face down.
He’d sent a message to Oliver a little while ago and still hadn’t gotten a response. He hoped it was because Oliver was busy and not because he was upset with John. He looked towards Sherlock, who nodded, his eyes shut and head tilted back. John looked at the dark bruise still under his jaw, his exposed neck, and prominent collarbones where his shirt fell askew.
“Perfect, thank you,” John said. She insisted on a hug and told him to say goodbye to Oliver for her, then left the flat in a flurry. Oliver was still in the bathroom and John turned to the sink to wash the plates and silverware, then put them on the drying rack.
John really, really, had to resist laughing. He didn’t mean to. Oliver was obviously distressed but the amount of self control it actually took him not to laugh was insane. Oliver was still hiding his face, but the tops of his ears were bright red and John, quiet as he could, took a breath to compose himself.
John thought not to mention that working with corpses on the daily probably didn’t help as much as she’d like it to. Did Molly live with anyone? He couldn’t even recall, which made him feel worse - God, he’d been a rotten friend to her. “You’re not alone are you?”
school, though, since I got my classes changed and I like the astronomy club. I don’t want to go to a new school and have to readjust again.”
Oliver emerged from his room in his school uniform - a navy blue blazer, dark trousers and a white button up. He put his bag on the kitchen chair and unzipped it to rummage around for something.
A fond smile crossed Lestrade’s face. “Good, that’s good. I got my job back too. It’s a little weird, but it works for me.”
Sherlock’s fingers drummed the surface of the desk again. “I can sleep on the couch tonight, if - if you want me to stay -”
Sherlock had two laptops in front of him (John had no idea where they came from) and John had his, plus all the clippings and files. They spent a good hour or two scouring news sites, files, and databases they probably shouldn’t have access too, trying to connect the organization with any other crimes or the terrorist attack. It seemed to be impossible to track them.
Oliver hesitated, looking away, then pulled an envelope out from behind his back and handed it to John. “My teacher told me to give this to my guardian.”
“I got that call back from your grandmother, she said they’re out of the country the next few weeks,” John explained. “Would you like me to see about you going with your uncle for Christmas?”
“All right, but you can’t keep getting marks like this,” John said. “Tell me what you’d like to do.”
He found John’s hand, and dug his nails into John’s palm while he choked out a sob and hid his face in his knees. John didn’t wince at the pain while he kneeled on the floor next to the boy and squeezed his shoulder.
Sherlock had been sitting next to him, quiet, for the past few minutes. The bed dipped a little under their weight, and they weren’t saying anything to each other. Just sitting -
Oliver moved so he was standing next to Caden and bumped his shoulder, “Let’s just forget about it.”
As soon as he pushed the door to 221B open, Oliver scowled, his arms crossed. Sherlock still sat at the desk, but now he looked alert and watched John step into the flat behind Oliver. Nobody said anything.
"The same happiness is not possible for everyone. That's why life's this Hell. If you do a thing you're damned, and if you don't you're damned—" he paused, and continued. "Sorry. I do apologize. I’m not well—should like a little ice."
Sherlock smote him on the ribs, and for ten minutes they played up amongst the trees, too giddy for speech. Pensive again, they stood close together, although Trevor refused to allow Sherlock to kiss him in the open. Then they hid the bicycle behind dog roses, and started. Trevor took his notebook away with him, but it did not survive in any useful form, for the dyke they were following branched.
"Alright," she said finally. "You know I'm not supposed to leave you alone in the lab, but I'm exhausted and I want a coffee. I'm putting my files down here, and I'll return in 45 minutes. That's all I can do, Sherlock. You'd best not be here when I get back."
"In terms of tracking him down, I believe the task may not be as hopeless as it first seems. There are several limiting factors that we can assume to be in play, and additional scientific calculations should make it possible to estimate a likely radius, at least."
, he added to himself, remembering the wonder of John’s alien body opening to the music of his violin. He smiled to himself. John Watson: his friend.
John shuddered. "I'm so afraid," he whispered. "Promise me, Sherlock. Promise me that I'm back--that it's real."
"No consequences for what you do, though, are there?" John asked, his voice louder and stronger than it had been all night.
Sherlock, with his resolution firmly in mind, responded with cold formality. "Fine, Watson, thank you," he said, and turned away.
"Can the leopard change his spots? Victor, you're in a muddle. It's part of your general health. I'm not anxious now, because you're well otherwise, you even look happy, and the rest must follow. I see you were afraid to tell me, lest it gave me pain, but we've got past sparing each other. You ought to have told me. What else am I here for? You can't trust anyone else. You and I are outlaws. All this"—he pointed to the middle-class comfort of the room—"would be taken from us if people knew."
Sherlock rolled his eyes and turned his back on Mycroft. Making what he presumed to be eye contact with the creature, he whispered urgently, "John--listen to me. I will return. Mycroft can eject me now, but no lock in the country can keep me out.
"No, you may not ask," interrupted the other. "You belong to the past. I'll tell you everything up to this moment—not a word beyond."
Sherlock gave a cry of pain. It was so unmistakable that Trevor, who was about to close the door between them, said, "I’ll give you some of this, if you like. It helps. It … stops one from feeling quite so much.”
?" Mycroft raised a skeptical eyebrow as his brother paced manically before him. "And suddenly you are the arbiter of what is and is not ethical in the realm of scientific investigation, are you? All of your own work, for example, is strictly above board? Shall I have Brantherton conduct a facility review? He can do an ethics compliance sweep--starting with your lab, and ending with mine--and then we'll see your true attitude towards research ethics. Or perhaps it's time for another one of Lestrade's little searches, hmm?"
But an example was the one thing Sherlock could realize. "Ada?" he said, with a change of tone. “Your nurse?”
"That is not the case, I assure you. You're thinking in absolutes, which is the surest sign of an immature mind. Govern yourself at once!"
Unfortunately it was not a real bridge: it only spanned a slight depression in the ground, which the architect had tried to utilize in his effect. To stand on it was to feel in a photographic studio, and the parapet was too low to lean upon. Still, with a pipe in his mouth, Sherlock looked fairly natural, and hoped it wouldn't rain. He was more comfortable with solitary skulking than socializing in rooms with his fellows, in any case.
Seated between Victor on his right and Pippa on his left, Sherlock was cheerily ignored by the larger party of diners and left free to converse with his friend. He could feel Victor’s long leg pressed warmly against his own.
"I don't... I don't know. They give me water and food, but I don't think I need it. I don't want it. I tried, once or twice, but..." He broke off helplessly.
"Headmaster fears you have the makings of an inveterate sinner; did you know?" Sherlock felt he was meant to laugh at this, but did not take his cue. He rather thought it was the truth.
Molly looked at him in surprise, tilting her head. "It's the next logical step, Sherlock," she said thoughtfully. "Not kind, certainly, and not humane -- but a logical method for obtaining data."
"I can't, I've an engagement," said Sherlock, his heart beating violently. A formal Yarders’ dinner party awaited him of the sort that brought work to his nascent consultancy and that he couldn't possibly cut. He had almost forgotten its existence. "I have to leave you now and get changed. But look here: John, be reasonable. Meet me another evening instead—any day."
! That's the problem. I feel so many different things, strange things, and they're all--off. I can't interpret any part of what this body is telling me, it's wretched, wretched! I don't think I can take much more, Sherlock." He slid down the wall and sat slumped against it. Sherlock took a seat on the floor at the glass, as well.
At that, Lestrade eyed him sharply. He'd worked for the man long enough -- and knew him well enough -- to ignore the small insult and speak instead to its cause. "I am very much surprised at your change of mind, sir," he replied. "You're the last man I would have expected to be frightened off after one engagement."
"Well, Sherlock,” he said with bland geniality as Sherlock sat himself down in Mycroft’s snug little study. “How goes the career? Not quite as you expected, eh?"
"I keep trying," he was saying, Sherlock nodding encouragingly. "I've done nothing but wrack my brains since they brought me here, and I just don't remember. It's a blank -- a gap in my memory. Like I was unconscious. One minute I was walking up New Cavendish Street on my way to an interview at U.C.H. I remember I passed a cafe and thought I might have time for a quick coffee. Then -- nothing."
"It's a chance in a thousand we've met, we'll never have the chance again and you know it. Stay with me. We love each other."
Outside at last, Sherlock pressed his face into the wall. He was ashamed in a way. He knew he had behaved badly—and worse, stupidly. Mycroft had touched to the raw. But somehow he could not retract, could not alter. Once out of the rut, he seemed out of it for ever. He considered his offense. If a woman had been in that side-car, if then he had refused to stop at the Dean's bidding, would he have been sent down? Surely not. He could not conceive of issuing an apology, and could not believe that Mycroft—Mycroft of all people!—would expect him to do so. It was utterly untenable.
Gradually, the men became aware that the hum was, in fact, some kind of amplified voice--and that it was speaking to them.
of them. I've drawn you diagrams and shown you figures--I've told you in great detail and in single-syllable words exactly what we're up against. Now I tell you again to simply leave it alone. My way is absolutely the only way that will both mitigate potential risks and allow for the possibility of benefit to us."
The creature's condition was deteriorating rapidly, and he didn't think the steepening rate of decline could be attributed entirely to Mycroft's barbaric procedures. Every time he saw him, the creature's scales seemed duller in appearance, his movements slower, and his voice softer.
Several minutes later, he continued as if there had been no pause. "Factoring in Watson’s height and weight, that size of scanner should be able to find him anywhere up to about a thousand miles. And quite frankly, I don't believe he's left London. Where is his logical destination? It can't be far--not if he's as weakened in Jo--in Watson's body as Watson is in his. He doesn't have compatriots here, at least none that we know of – and Mycroft would know. No, logic dictates that he must be in London."
When Sherlock arrived home from his dinner with Mycroft, there was a telegram waiting on his tray. His heart gave a great leap in his chest and he seized it with no little trepidation, almost trembling as he opened it.
As he alighted his name had been called out of dreams. The violence went out of his heart, and a purity that he had never imagined dwelt there instead. His friend had called him. He stood for a moment entranced, then the new emotion found him words, and laying his hand very gently upon the pillows he answered, "Victor!"
“Molly: with me,” he ordered, handing her a clipboard list of instructions. The two gathered around the instrument-board and Sherlock explained the changes he had made--and to Molly it was soon evident that they were examining an instrumental control panel more advanced than anything she'd seen -- or even heard of -- before. It was a system which only the virtuoso mind of a Holmes could have devised. The new object-compasses were housed in arenak cases after setting, and the housings were then exhausted to the highest attainable vacuum. Oscillation was set up by means of one carefully standardized electrical impulse. The bearings, fabricated with arenak and telapian metals, were as strong as the axles of a truck yet almost perfectly frictionless.
Trevor’s eyes softened for the merest instant and then he flushed and pulled away, looking around them fearfully. "H-Holmes,” he whispered, “You cannot say such things to me. You—you're an Englishman. I'm another. You know the risks. I'm not offended, but really, we must never mention it again. You. You must never. My—my father made me promise, and I really can’t… A rotten notion really—"
He moved to put his hands on Victor, but the other pulled away convulsively. "It's not the least good—I've changed."
“Oh, Sherlock,” he said sadly. He was not surprised by the depth of Sherlock's misery, but was profoundly shocked by his honesty in revealing it. He took refuge in his usual rationality. “Let us consider the matter pragmatically. This gamekeeper—he’s an uneducated man, I assume? Few prospects? Unknown to you? Surely you see that he’s got you in his power. In court would he have a case?"
Gathering himself, he opened the door of his car and stood, removing his case and ever-present umbrella from the seat beside him and turning to lock the door.
One day in late July, a letter arrived from Victor Trevor. Mycroft handed it to Sherlock with a raised eyebrow and an almost fatherly pang. Sherlock opened it much later that night, privately, and with a sickly feeling of trepidation mixed with joy. He wasn’t sure he could bear another gentle renunciation of what he knew to be real and true between himself and Victor. There was nothing at all personal about the letter, however, just a brief, dry invitation to a weekend party at his family’s home in the country. “Don’t write—just come,” Victor had scrawled across the bottom of the note.
my parent.” Oliver snarled at him. John leaned back as if struck, and Oliver swung around and ran from the flat, the front door rattling when he slammed it behind him.
“Sorry,” mumbled Oliver, crossing his arms and sinking down on the couch so his knees touched the coffee table. John couldn’t look at his face. He actually couldn’t, fearing he would vomit seeing
John put his hand on Sherlock’s back, slid it up to his shoulder and turned Sherlock to look at him. “Sherlock, two years changes things. Being away from people you knew for so long, even for someone with your brain. It’s hard to re-adept.”
