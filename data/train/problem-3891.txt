“I’m… confused, but… grateful,” Cas said slowly. “I guess I just keep waiting for something bad to happen.”
“Yes.” Cas sighed. “I had thought she was dead, but it turns out she survived when Metatron stabbed her in the head with a needle.”
Dean frowned. “You staying in here tonight?”
Kaia’s heart began to pound. Claire was here. She pushed herself up onto her knees and crawled out of the shelter of sticks that the Other Kaia had built. Did Claire even know that the one who had killed her was just another version of her? It didn’t matter. Claire had come back. After months, sure, but she had come back.
“Missouri is dead,” he said bluntly, as soon as he was out by the car with Jody. “And you know what?” he continued before Jody could reply, “she knew it. She– I mean, we could’ve protected her.” He didn’t want to dump all his guilt on Jody, but it was spilling out of him like an overflowing rain barrel.
“I didn’t say it was up to you.” Yeah, maybe humor wasn’t the best approach here. “I said it depends on you. Word on the interdimensional street is you’ve been slipping between worlds, Dean.” Dean grimaced as he recalled the portal. “I wanna know how you did it. Now.”
Was Dean seriously trying to talk about feelings? “No, it’s not about that. It’s about….” He paused. “Well, it is in part about that.” Was now really the time to bring up his failing grace? No, better to blame it on one of the other things constantly nagging at him. “But, Dean, I promised Kelly that I would protect her son, and if Michael really is coming, then maybe I was brought in preparation.”
Cas melted into his arms. They stood there for what might have been a few seconds, and might have been years.
“Dee?” Dean’s eyes snapped open. Jack was looking at him with wide blue eyes.
“Hey, that’s not a bad car.”
“Dumah,” Cas greeted, “thank you for agreeing to meet with me. This is a matter of great urgency. I need help, with Jack.”
“Yeah, that’s, uh, that’s beautiful.” Cas could hear the archangel pacing in his cell.
He picked up on the second ring. “Hello, Dean.”
“Memorize this,” she ordered. Sam did as he was told, reading the words and reciting them under his breath. Rowena bustled around, setting up one spell bowl in a secluded spot hidden behind a pillar, and the other at the base of the throne.
Ahead of them, the monsters’ growling echoed down the hall.
“You’re heroes!” Dean concluded, “and together, we are going to take down this phantom. Are you with me?”
“Alright,” Dean said. He started filling up one side of the sink with warm water and soap. It was relieving, to be honest, to get John out of the room. Dean needed more time to process his return.
Rowena set her jaw. “Well, if anyone can make it back from the dead, it’s that stubborn little angel.”
“Yeah, okay.” Dean wished he could help ease Cas’ pain, but he had no idea how much Advil was enough for an angel, and he wasn’t about to experiment and risk overdosing him. He gently laid the back of his hand across Cas’ forehead. He was hot and feverish. Dean stood and got a wet washcloth from the bathroom and laid it across his friend’s forehead.
“Cas?” Dean called uncertainly.
A flash on the screen caught his eye. One of the patients’ eyes had flared. “Who’s that?” He asked, pointing him out.
“Stop.” Dean almost wished he could. Almost. But now that he’d uncapped the bottled up emotions in him, he couldn’t stop the flow.
“You gave her the page,” Dean said accusingly. “She got in your head, man.”
The sun had set by the time Dean pulled up to the cemetery. He was worried about Jack, but he pushed it to the back of his mind for the time being. Right now, he needed to take care of this ghoul. Nursing a sick child was not his forte– killing, though, that was.
“Hey,” said Jody, and he looked up to see Patience walking toward the both of them.
“Don’t listen to your other dad, Jack, he wants to be the favorite.”
“Just Cas is fine,” Cas added.
“Already up and at it, huh?” Cas turned in his chair to see Dean walking into the library, wearing his robe and carrying a mug of coffee in his hand. He frowned as he sat at the table. “Jack’s not up?”
Dean looked over at Rowena in shock.
“Moment of weakness, huh?”
Kaia’s killer. She needed to avenge Kaia, kill her killer.
“Well, here’s the thing, Lou,” Asmodeus drawled, walking slowly toward Cas and Lucifer. “I’m real satisfied with my current position. Hell is humming along quite nicely, thank you.” Cas adjusted his grip on his blade. “But I do hope you and your little lap angel will pay me a visit.” The demon dragged his eyes over Cas, making his skin crawl.
“Did he hurt ‘em?” Lucifer asked gleefully. “Did they suffer just a little bit?”
“It’s a tulpa,” he said, “a creature brought to life by a combination of that sigil and a whole bunch of people believing in the same story.”
Suddenly, the smell of weed filled the kitchen. Dean turned around to see Gabriel standing in the entryway.
Rewrite of episode 13x06, Tombstone.
“Yeah, but who gets to make that choice? You? What gives you that right?”
He cleared his throat. “Uh, Dad. Just…” he bit his lip. “A few, uh. A few things before we get there.”
“I know.”
“Where’s Jack?” Sam asked.
She also didn’t know how to break it to them that she was leaving.
“Pretty cool, right?” Dean said, examining the photographs on the wall while Cas set Jack’s carrier on the couch. “Dude! Check it out–” he pointed at one of the photographs “–Clay Allison, gun fighter extraordinaire, right? And, uh, Curly Bill Brocius–” he pointed at another photograph “–now, little fun fact here, he was killed by–” he pointed to yet another photograph “–Wyatt Earp himself.” He turned to Sam and grinned childishly. “Not kidding.” Sam could only stare as Dean walked along the wall, listing names and pointing.
“Oh, you Winchesters,” Rowena tutted, “I’ve changed.”
Dean had finally gotten used to being in Heaven. He’d wake up next to Cas, try to sneak out of bed without waking him up (he always failed), make breakfast, and then he and Cas would drive around all day, visiting friends, pulling over at viewpoints that always seemed to match exactly what he was in the mood to see, going fishing, drinking beer from a cooler in the backseat that never seemed to run out of ice or beverages or snacks, then return to their cabin in the woods and make dinner and watch old westerns and head to bed. Always the same, always perfect. A lot of the time, the two of them wouldn’t even talk, but just revel in each others’ company.
Sam bent over and reached as far as he could. He could almost grab it. “You don’t have to say it, Dean.”
But he wasn’t sleeping. Angels didn’t sleep.
Dean set his jaw. “Well, this one did, okay? Things aren’t as black and white as you think.” He regretted his words immediately.
Claire fell to her knees in front of Kaia’s shrine, her entire body shaking.
He wouldn’t think about that now. He couldn’t. Push it down, focus on the more pressing issue. Get Mom back. Do that, then deal with the Devil. Don’t let the fear consume him.
“Nice to meet you,” John said, regaining his composure and extending his hand.
Cas clamped a hand over Donatello’s mouth before he could complete the spell.
“Fine.” Sam sighed. “You go help Jody, and I’ll babysit the kid.”
“Hey,” Dean whispered, rushing toward her. He pulled the gag from her mouth. “You okay?”
“Donatello,” Sam said, breaking the tension, “whatever it is you’re feeling, whatever it is you’re going through, you can fight this.”
Sam clutched the pendulum in his hands. He couldn’t dwell on the people who were gone. If he started doing that, he’d never get going on this Lucifer business.
“Dead guy in Madison,” Dean explained, “police say it was a home invasion, but neighbor claims that she saw the vic’s dead wife leave the crime scene.”
He must have made a noise, because Lucifer snapped his head around, grinning a plaguish smile. He held out a clawed hand, and Sam found himself being dragged toward his tormentor.
“Yeah.” He grinned, and took another sip of his beer. “Poor kid.”
Donna pulled up closer, having seen no other monsters, and they made their way inside the large derelict ship, metal walkway clanking beneath them.
Billie looked at him for a long moment before speaking again. “You want to know something interesting?”
Fear trickled into Donatello’s features. “You– you can’t. I–I’ve absorbed too much power. Y–you’ll fry us both!”
Cas decided to ignore it. “This is very good.”
Dean shook his head. “Nah, he said he’s over trying to be normal. He’s probably with Eileen, taking out vamp nests every other day.”
“Are you talking about a resurrection spell, like last time?” Sam asked. He sure seemed to know his witchy stuff.
Dean was bustling around the kitchen, but it wasn’t the normal, lighthearted mood that he normally had when cooking. He seemed tense, worried, oddly silent instead of humming or singing or having some sort of one sided conversation with Jack.
“We’re retired,” Dean added. “But if you need help we can most certainly lend a hand.”
“Okay,” Cas said, “so what was different about Donatello?”
“Here,” Sam said, taking the bottle. Cas hadn’t heard him enter the room. “You gotta warm it up.” He stuck the bottle in the microwave, and they waited impatiently for the bottle to heat up. Cas watched as Sam tested the temperature by squirting a few drops onto the inside of his wrist, then handed it to Cas.
“Sam, do you want to put sheets on a couple of the guest beds for Dad and Eileen?” he asked. He really didn't know what to do.
The Empty was different now.
By the time she was finished with the song, Jack was fast asleep. She set him down gently, so as not to wake him, then returned to the rocking chair.
She supposed that was progress. Or fear of Patience’s vision.
“Scooby saved him from drowning in a fish pond,” Daphne supplemented.
“Okay. If you’ll follow Nurse Paguio–” he gestured to a nurse in purple scrubs and long black hair pulled back in a ponytail. Sam didn’t listen to the rest, just gestured to Cas and rushed down the hall. She took them to a room and closed the door.
“Dean, what kind of deal did you make?” John asked.
Cas smiled gently. “Hello, Dean.”
Cas spent hours examining each and every object on display, and reading every informational plaque. Dean almost got annoyed with his glacial pace (almost!), but melted every time Cas would add a tidbit of his own information, things he had learned from watching as an angel.
“You think that hate and anger, that's... That's what drives you, that's who you are. It's not.”
“How long will this warding hold?” Dean barked to Sam.
“Da!” Jack cried, hearing his name. Cas turned toward his son, then sucked in a breath.
“I love you, too, Cas.”
“Dean,” he replied curtly. The last thing he wanted right now was to talk about his feelings. They were hunting, damn it.
The room fell silent. Michael’s eyes flashed, and Adam shifted uncomfortably.
“You try Jane Does?”
Alex looked up. Of course Claire was here. “It’s a uniform. What’s your excuse?”
Gabriel grinned. “Those guys are going to get so sick of me.”
The car door creaked open. He whirled around to see Rowena exiting the car. Hoisting Jack up on his hip, he followed her.
Lucy was part of a patrol crew, out in search of supplies and survivors. They had taken Mary back to camp, where she met up with Bobby Singer. He had been a part of a different camp before, with Mary Campbell. He told her about the woman he knew, who had let her boyfriend die at the hands of a yellow eyed demon, and always regretted it.
“Yeah,” Sam said, unsure. “But then what? Once it’s gone, no EMF?” He mulled it over for a moment. “Okay, but if we go in, we can’t go in as FBI, not with doctor-patient confidentiality.”
Dean’s eyes widened in shock. “Wow. What’s it been, like, a decade?”
The new voice startled Cas. He had assumed the cell to his other side was empty. He stood from the stone bench and walked toward the bars, trying to peek around the corner without touching the bars. It wasn’t working.
She stopped. Her dad had told her to try and get rid of them, ignore them, make them go away. But it was the only way she felt connected to her grandmother, and despite the knowledge that it had been her dad’s fault that she never got to know her, she still felt guilty. “They never stopped.” She didn’t need to mention that she was actively practicing.
Sam clenched his jaw. “You think he’s going to go dark side.”
“Yeah.” He knew that Dean had just as little hope as he did, but honestly, it made him feel just a little bit better, knowing that he and his brother were in the same boat on this.
“Hey, man,” Lucifer greeted, failing to sound casual and nonchalant.
Or at least that had been the plan, anyway.
“And you know how to do that spell, right?” Dean demanded.
The confused look multiplied.
And now he was faced with both brothers staring furiously at each other with such menace it was though they were intending to fight, and Castiel was not entirely certain they weren’t.
“I assume that’s not a suggestion either.”
“We could go to bed early if you wanted,” Dean suggested, and the concern was so devoted that it was almost physically painful. “Get you tucked in, pillow behind your head, just let you rest up. We’ve got lots of time to settle in, yeah?”
“...fuck…,” Dean tried not to say anything at all but the gasp couldn’t be held back, allowing his head to dangling slightly as he tried to focus on anything other than the angel sliding his hard, thick cock deep inside him, over and over again, so hard and confidently that he was amazed his limbs could hold him. Every so often he caught that little spot of nerves inside, a flash of electrical pleasure-agony to add to his growing release, and Dean bit back a growl-howl again.
“..yes?”
Dean tried his voice, and thankfully found it still present. “No. And I don’t want anything, either.”
Her eyes widened. “Oh, I am sorry!”
“I can heal serious injuries and adjust bodily organs. Prostate manipulation is extremely minor in comparison. I find it’s more accurate than attempting a perfect angle strike.” Castiel murmured back, faintly concerned.. “I hope I did not overstep my bounds..?”
His hand gently drifted from chest, across the firm stomach and then slowly, carefully to brush against Dean’s groin. Dean’s pleasure was easy to discern. A soft gasp greeted him as Castiel’s hand stroked lovingly across a large, hard erection, hard and eager and twitching in sensation from the touch. Dean bit his lip and closed his eyes for a moment, before opening them again and fixing Castiel with a look so unholy that even Lucifer would be impressed.
The eyes narrowed further. Castiel wasn’t entirely sure what that signified, but as an answer it was certainly sub-par.
“I’m familiar with this aesthetic,” Castiel commented. Dean huffed a laugh. Yeah, that was probably right. Heaven definitely had a multi-stock supply of white paint on hand.
“They look a handful.” Annie said doubtfully.
They were a damned good fit. He felt full to bursting, pleasure mixed with pain, and Dean whined again sulkily at the distinct lack of action. Still, the view had its own benefits. Cas’ expression was just as intense as ever but there was a light tremble through his body and the clear look of someone fighting against his natural inclinations to just plough in. The lights and the weird disco ball only added to the glow, illustrating Castiel’s form so well it was like an artist had designed it, which given Balthazar’s presence it probably had been.
The angel hadn’t been aware that there had been a voice, but the level of dismay in Dean’s was evident. That was not what he had wished. Castiel added a layer of what he hoped was soothing to the mix.
“How do you feel?” Castiel attempted to address the issue with a more upbeat and positive query, despite the fact that he was certain that the answer should be a crude version of ‘not very well.’
“You okay with that?”
“And it would probably be a little public,” Sam added.
somewhere!” Little green eyes that sparkled indignation and hurt.
Dean snorted laughter at that. Yeah, take him to church. And sure, there might not be witnesses but he couldn’t do it, and he made a small shake of his head to shut down the conversation. Or at least that was the plan, but Balthazar apparently was not one to take hints well. His fingers were still on Dean’s cheek and Dean wanted nothing so much as to bite them, and bite them hard, only he wasn’t entirely sure that was true anymore, and he growl-whined in frustration and need again.
.” he didn’t care that Balthazar was just in front of them, watching, he just needed this. Needed it
“This is going to work, right?” Jody shot another look at Castiel. The angel looked solemn but nodded. Sam looked between them and then down at the t-shirt he was swimming in, tugging on the fabric nervously.
“What options?” Dean said roughly.
“Dean, you were supposed to be getting dressed.” his voice was stern and hard but the determination was not present, and Castiel suspected that Dean was equally aware of his traitorous indecision.
“I see.” Castiel replied. “Yes. Thank you, Sam.”
angel. No one should be flirting with him in any shape or form and that … okay, that was a weird thing to think, but fuck it.
“Of course he did.” he took another mouthful gingerly. If this was the fuel Dean had been feeding himself then he was amazed his brother wasn’t vibrating in his chair. He was aware of the angel watching him with the expression of someone who really wanted to say something but didn’t know the best way to start. Sam sighed.
Dean made a soft noise that represented a shrug without the effort of physical movement. “Well. Just in case this wasn’t really what you had planned.”
“One of the valves came away,” Or at least it would do in under ten minutes once Castiel had time to locate something to break. “The water pressure is a little haphazard.”
“It’s kinda hard not to, Cas. You said he was acting differently but that’s … well, that’s kinda a big difference.”
“Because.”
And yet.
“Is that behaviour or euphemism?” Castiel queried suspiciously. They had got him in the past on this before. Dean’s grin widened slightly and he deliberately and slowly tightened his laces before chuckling softly and taking hold of Castiel’s unresisting hand.
Sam raised his head defiantly. “I’m not going anywhere. Tell me why you’re not sleeping.”
, not their clothes. Mm?”
“I don’t care.” Definitely Dean 100% back to normal. There was another sleepy yawn and Cas stroked him again, mostly because he could. Who knew how long this would last for? He bit his lip and tried not to focus on that aspect. One evening was more than he’d ever thought was possible.
“Hair it is,” the witch purred, then frowned. “Keep them over there, though. I do not want small fingers ruining the spell.”
Castiel had been dubious about his intentions but finally Dean was curled in - or at least on - bed, resting on his stomach and his head buried in a pillow. His eyes were still open, poised in a scowl, but for now Castiel was happy to call this a win.
are you wearing my trenchcoat, Dean?” he lifted his hand and Dean forced himself not to jump as gentle fingers gently rested against his cheekbone, the man squinting at the injury to head. “And how is the injury? Is it any better? Can you remember what happened?”
“Agreed.” Castiel hesitated. “And thank you, Jody. I do not believe I could have looked after them well.”
“Or they’re very proud of it. Dean, stop nit-picking.”
Sam forgot his fears for a moment in his hurry to sulk at being deemed ‘tiny’. Jody could live with that though. It was significantly better than the tears that she had worried over, not even sure what she’d feel if they’d both started crying. Probably the worse temporary mother on the planet, for a start. Both of the Winchesters had fought off multiple apocalypses, it couldn’t come to them being in tears in her lounge. She’d never live it down.
“No, I haven’t been over there all night.”
For, even those that had once followed him, once believed and prayed to him, so many stopped upon his failure, and those that didn’t began to die off. One by one, the world forgot who he was. That he even existed. The God of Families that couldn’t even protect his own people.
“Oh, hell no! I’m not missing my night with him each month.”
“You’d…” Cas’s eyes widen in surprise and then he shakes his head, glaring down at the ground. “First, let’s talk about how a Sabanto man is an invited guest to the most exclusive gallery in the entire country.”
“Because… because it would change everything,” Castiel said, sadness in his voice. “You wouldn’t look at me the same.”
He abhors these laws that were put into place when people entered the dome centuries ago. Flaws are not allowed, let alone genetic disorders. Sam has been doing research into law and how the concept of the legal system has changed throughout time. There was a time in their past where all people were considered equal under the law; regardless of genetics, disease, ability, intelligence, or economic status. Sam is terribly saddened by the fact that although their civilization has advanced by gargantuan leaps, most of those leaps have come at the expense of individual freedom.
. Imagine being a hunter who never really knew what they were missing. Now imagine what it’s like when they do. That less than an hour ago the only thing they had to worry about was who got the last strawberry yogurt.”
“Give me a few minutes,” he said and promptly vanished. Dean sighed through his teeth and glared at Castiel.
good,” Sam added, crumbs still around his face and his eyes twinkling happily.
“Thanks,” he rubbed it again, most likely out of an automatic reaction, and then began to pace around the bedroom. Castiel watched him for a moment, frowning.
. Someone who could tell when he wasn’t okay despite him maintaining he was. Someone who could see through the illusions and deceptions, and just be real around. And yet their whole damned situation was fantasy, forced on his friend.
And finally,
“They’re fine.” Rowena dismissed it with a wave of her hand before she continued putting her supplies back in the bag.
Silence again but this was the type that was pleasant to share, restful and comforting. He could sense Dean’s heartbeat, slowing now as he settled, and the beautiful, faintly musky scent of their activities. Castiel had many questions, but not one of them was important enough to interrupt this moment. Besides which, he was still uncertain whether he’d want to hear the answers.
“Right.” Cas looked like a bunny in headlights. Sam shifted position, sitting and curling his legs under him like a human shaped cat, the blanket still wrapped around himself. He was also looking significantly less tired, which was probably a bad thing.
In the end they had agreed on a compromise. Cas could have a look at some of the wooden structure from underneath, having been able to squeeze through some of the decorative gaps around the edges, and that way Cas could see the ‘historical detailing of the construction’ without actually stepping onto the out of bounds platform. Crazy, sure, but Dean had already accepted the fact that his husband was a little odd.
“God knows.” Jody replied.
But that didn’t matter right at that point. He couldn’t see Dean. Where was he? The angel picked up speed, dodging around small groups, trying to spot Dean’s familiar green coat amongst the congregation and feeling the fear rise in his throat as he did so. Nothing.
“Sam?
“It’s okay, Cas.” Sam said softly. “Several years back. This isn’t going to affect the relationship that you have with Dean.”
“Mm.”
“Hey, Sam.” he said as carelessly as he could whilst being on the floor in the middle of a ritual circle. “How are you feeling?”
“You know he doesn’t normally go for full mouth kisses in the morning before breakfast.” Castiel emphasised the point. Small signs of affection were one thing. Kisses with hints of sexual behaviour were quite another.
Fuck.
Once upon a time Castiel had considered Dean saved. As time had gone on, he had a growing suspicion he had simply extended Dean’s torture into a different route.
fucked up in some way?”
Apparently the answer was unknown to Dean as well, who merely scowled and shook his head stubbornly. This was not unusual, in Castiel’s experience. There were many things that Dean disliked in the world, and having to ask for other people’s help was high up on the list. Well, unless the help revolved around pies or other such stock. Dean had his priorities firmly mapped, and many of them oozed fruit filling.
“Jody,” Sam said after a while. “Where did Cas go?”
,” Dean amended. “He’d let Sam die if it was just me.”
Even Lucifer couldn’t have designed a better torture. Castiel stared upward for a moment, as though the ceiling might in some way offer him some escape from the uncomfortably personal conversation they were having. Did he love him? His strength, his loyalty, his energy… how could he not? Castiel had fallen for his soul long before anything else.
he lets us.” Sam replied with feeling. “We were much younger when we did it before. There was another point when we tried it but that .. uh, ended up in a different way.”
And it was all hectic and mad and messy and infuriating and silly, and strangely… relaxing. She couldn’t quite explain the feeling she’d had when Sam had given her a massive hug before running to bed, nor the way that Dean smiled so trustingly at her when she took his hand. She’d kissed one on the cheek automatically after putting them to bed and stopped in shock, but the boy - Sam - had been so pleased that she no longer cared whether it was a good idea to take things that far. She’d bathed the boys several times now. A kiss on the cheek was nothing in the great scheme of things.
“..y’kay, Cas?” Dean’s voice was low, sleepy and still muffled, the vibration of his voice a tickle on the angel’s skin. Castiel gently stroked over Dean’s back with his fingertips and enjoyed the little shiver that resulted.
“Eels are pretty bad, Dean. Definitely want to avoid those,”
“As do I. And there is nothing to apologise for.”
“Or eels.”
He closed his eyes. His
Another movement on the bandstand, and Dean watched curiously as an older woman was brought on the stage. Her hair was long and loose and she too had a relaxed expression on her face, hands clasped to her chest and eyes that seemed to care for nothing other than the leader in front of her.
Dean hesitated. Sam looked enthralled already, hugging his bunny closer as he listened.
Dean took a long, confused mouthful of coffee. He was still wearing the trenchcoat, the fabric a little weird against his bare skin, and offered Cas a slightly nervous smile as the man came back bearing some clothes. Jeans, t-shirt, green light shirt. Stuff that made him feel a whole lot better.
“Yeah.” The poor love looked at the basket and then looked back at her again, still dazed. “Um. Thank you.”
“It’s okay.” Dean murmured to him. “I’ve got you.”
“If you were willing, I would recommend that I stay here with you for the evening in close proximity. This will allow me to feed you strength and to assess the current condition.” his voice was matter of fact.
“You have literally just hit your head from some type of incident. Increasing the chance of a tripping hazard seems a little foolhardy.” the words were a sharp scold although from the look on Dean’s face he wasn’t sure those words had truly landed the way he’d intended.
There was a look on Castiel’s face that spoke of unspeakable horror at that thought. Jody chuckled and took another mouthful.
“I’m not sure I feel like a nice, normal, homosexual couple.” Castiel advised.
Dean thought about that and snorted softly. “That’s probably the most boring plan I’ve heard of.”
That was not the best noise she’d ever heard. Jody frowned, and then looked back at where Castiel was finally beginning to control the situation. Or at least slightly, anyway. Dean still determined never to let Castiel out of his sight again.
“And the chocolate brown stuff,” Dean included.
“Balthazar?”
The point was taken. His hands tightened on Dean’s hips as Castiel slid into him one last time, his eyes closing briefly as he concentrated. He was rewarded by a soft, shocked yelp from Dean at the angelic stimulation deep inside him, arching his back and clenching so tightly around Castiel’s cock that the angel briefly regretted using his abilities to stimulate Dean’s prostate perfectly. Very briefly. Dean’s orgasm was hard and almost violent, back arching and muscles clamping down on him so hard that Castiel was pushed into his own climax almost immediately, shuddering his release into the still tight warmth of his lover before he slowly, slowly relaxed against Dean’s exhausted, shuddering body.
“The cookies are
“Neither of you have talked about it with each other, huh?” Sam said softly and sympathetically.
“Uh, the last one. I’m feeling better. I think, I don’t know how I felt last night, but I’m awake and that has to be good, right?” He bent down to pick up the basket and offered it a little desperately. “You sure you don’t want bacon?”
“All big happy families.”
“Wait.” There was no arguing with that voice, low but promising bad things if ignored. Rowena made an unimpressed noise but stopped, shooting a look toward the angel.
“Ah, Cas, I love it when you’re all firm.” Dean’s eyes twinkled. There was a pause.
She looked down at the page and cleared her voice.
“Did you really think that was a good idea?”
Extremely complicated discovered a new top level to ascend to.
It made it no less clear, but it sounded like it was unimportant. Essentially the answer was ‘yes, very likely’, and that gave him hope that the memories weren’t all lost.
All was good and yet he still couldn’t stop the soft hiss of sensation as Castiel slowly began to push into him; he might be pre-oiled but his body was still tight and not used to strangers. Dean made a soft noise and allowed his head to fall back gently, legs still wrapped around him but loosely to allow the angel the ability to move. Sure, Cas was pretty damned solid and his body needed adjusting but the need overcame the sensible and Dean whine-growled his opinion about rests and waiting and patience.
. And if it solved the mess, so much the better.
Dean waited but nothing else came through. “Like..? You need me to go get them?”
The witch waited a moment and then sighed.
“-that’s
And then things got more difficult, and Sam was pushed down the list of priorities.
“Balthazar. I would greatly appreciate your help in this. Sam is very important to me.” Cas spoke softly but with an intensity that Dean appreciated as the angel made a tiny step to put himself between Dean and Balthazer. The other angel eyed him carefully and clearly reluctantly before sighing softly and throwing up a hand.
Casting a look back at the bedroom, Dean swiftly headed to the door and carefully -
Dean took another look at the innocently sleeping Sam, gently moved a hair strand from his brother’s eyes and then pressed a light kiss to Sam’s forehead. Right. It would be okay. It had to be.
Castiel sighed again and stood from the sink, wiping his hands on a dishcloth briefly.
He had a brother? A brother called Sam, and a husband called Cas, and a white house on a street with a white fence and a big bed and shit he needed some bacon and pie and needed it pretty damned quick. And some vodka. Or whisky. Or alcohol in general.
“Thanks,” the grin was easy going, and Dean grabbed hold of Castiel’s hand and gave it a squeeze that dragged the angel’s attention off whatever the hell he was studying - looked like some bald guys at the top - and back onto him. “We wanted to get into shape for our wedding, right, dear?”
“That is an answer but it’s not a very good one,” Castiel commented. Dean huffed a laugh.
And there it was. Dean was asleep.
He would know. He would know a lot. Castiel dug his heels into the floor and fixed Dean with a look normally reserved for disobedient fledgling angels who were testing the boundaries. Not that this seemed to make any difference to Dean’s behaviour. In fact the grin seemed to widen, like a small child that had discovered a new game to play with priceless artefacts that hadn’t been hidden away enough.
“A bit.”
, shall we? Like you two.” Another hand gesture, this time aimed toward Castiel and Dean.
There was a longer pause and then Dean shook his head. “I have no idea what you’re going on about. This is a violent spell that is trying to kill my brother!”
The angel smiled, wrapping his arm around him and pulling him tight. Awesome was definitely right, and not just for stolen orgasms. Lying beside Dean during the case had been both exquisite and a living nightmare, a look don’t touch torment that found vulnerable areas that Castiel had not even known he possessed. The ability to stroke him, to touch him and witness his delight was magic by itself. Sure enough, Dean gave a soft little sigh of contentment, a cat next to a warm fire on a freezing day, and nuzzled him happily.
“So,” Dean said when Sam had finished, “You think….”
“May I…?” Cas started, then trailed off. He’d been gone for so long. Did he have any right to play father to Jack just yet?
“They’re gone?” Donna was talking to Jody, who looked a bit shaken. Alex shot at one of the monsters as it tried to squeeze its way around the barricade.
With one deep, shaky breath, Claire pushed herself to her feet. She had to stay strong. For Kaia. For Jody.
“I have no interest in talking to you,” Cas growled, “and if this is about your son–”
His hands trembled as he wrapped one arm under Cas’ shoulders and the other under his legs. With great effort, he lifted the lifeless angel from the ground, and carried him into the dining room, laying him gently on the table. He looked around, not daring to let his eyes rest on his friend’s corpse for any length of time. Hanging over the back of a chair was a large white sheet. He took the sheet and draped it over Cas’ body, like a curtain closing at the end of a play, like finality, like permanence.
“Well,” Cas rumbled, “Donatello said that Gog and Magog can only be killed by a weapon touched by God, so–” he held out two angel blades, and Dean selected one “–angel blades.”
“I want you to go to Buckhead, Georgia,” she instructed, “this is the address.” She handed Dean a slip of paper. “My son, James, he lives there with my granddaughter, Patience.” Fear permeated her voice, and Dean hated to hear his friend like this. “This wraith, he’ll be coming for them. That’s what I saw.”
Jody was silent for a moment. Claire could imagine her nodding sadly. “Okay. Well, good job taking the striga out, anyway.”
“Hey there, handsome,” one of the sisters said huskily. Her voice made Dean’s skin crawl. He cocked his gun in response.
“That’s the thing. She doesn’t have a name, because I made the story up. There was never a mine on that mountain.”
“No, John,” Mary said, the realization dawning on her. “Our boys aren’t safe with you around.”
“Gabriel?”
“Daddy’s not here, Jack.”
“Why are you so insistent on it?”
“I have you, darling, I’m here,” Cas said and kissed the tears from Dean’s cheeks.
“Yes, it’s okay to punch Nazis!” the band sang loudly.
Meg went out that evening and they took advantage of that fact by making out on the living room couch. Cas lay on top of Dean, blanketing him with his weight. He rocked against him, drawing a moan from Dean.
Dean slipped carefully out of bed, doing his best not to disturb Cas. He stood in the bedroom doorway for a moment, just looking at him. Cas’s face was relaxed in sleep, making him look younger and less intense than the man he’d met last night, vulnerable even. Dean felt lucky to be allowed to see Cas like this, at peace, without his guard up. It was the sort of quiet, private moment that only a lover usually had the privilege to witness, and he wanted more of them.
he could practically hear Ash saying.
“Very intimidating, Abaddon,” he agreed.
Dean doubted he was really going for a walk since he hadn’t exactly strolled out the front door. He probably just wanted to avoid Dean, which made him feel like a jerk. He realised this was the first time he’d seen Castiel use his powers since that display of wings when he’d lost his temper. Perhaps, after his reaction to the shadow wings, Cas had been trying to put him at ease by acting more human. So now, he was either sick of making an effort for an ungrateful asshole, or too upset to remember to tamp down his angelic nature, which made Dean feel like an even bigger jerk.
“What do you want?” Cas asked, giving his dick a gentle squeeze.
“Right? It’s horrific, but the idea kind of got under my skin. That people would be punished for such a thing. What kind of sadistic God would do that? Make someone suffer so much in their life that they ended it, and then what, God’s mad that they didn’t pass some test? That the pain was too much for them, and then instead of their suffering being over, being welcomed into God’s loving bosom and comforted, they’re tortured for eternity.” Cas made a small, sad sound. “There were a lot of things that made me lose my faith, but that was a big one, the sheer cruelty of God. Either God doesn’t exist or he’s a being so unfathomably inhumane that I don’t want anything to do with him.”
I’m sorry!
“You are so beautiful,” he told the angel and pulled his head back down.
“That’s what I said, but I can hardly be blamed for the erection if you will climb on top of me and start wriggling around!” The infuriating man had the nerve to sound exasperated.
It’s the best one. It has cowboys!
The problem with coming your brains out was that it was a temporary thing. The come cooled, the tingles faded, your brain reconstituted itself and instead of thinking about how much your maybe-boyfriend turned you on, you realised that he'd never actually said that he missed you too, not really. Cas saying he missed Dean’s body wasn’t quite the same as him saying he missed
He really needed to stop watching rom-coms. Why would Cas even come to the airport? It’s not like he would come to pick Dean up. He didn’t even have a car.
Dean felt overwhelmed, not just by the physical sensations that were causing his orgasm to feel like it was welling up from the base of his spine, but by the sentiments that were causing love to well up in his heart. His chest was so full that it seemed like those feelings would spill right out of his mouth. He kissed Cas again to stop himself from saying something he wasn’t ready to hear. When he came, it felt like the climax burst out of him, an explosion of all the emotions he was trying so hard to contain.
Cas looked at her with confusion.
Dean was taken aback. “Why?”
Gabriel was not doing nothing. He was, in fact, feeding Jack M&Ms, one by one.
“What in that world could possibly make you go through such a thing?”
Sam turned to Dean. “I don’t know what happened, man. We were setting up the spell and he just… snapped.”
“Hello, Castiel.”
“My dream, last night, I saw what happened before it happened. I….”
“I can leave,” Cas offered, starting to move.
He turned away as Eileen lifted herself out of the basin, water sloshing. Rowena brushed past him, a towel at the ready.
“Nothing.” Sam couldn’t say he felt exactly the same. Yes, Cas was back, and that was great, but it made him think of his mom, trapped in that other world. If Jack could bring Cas back from the Empty, could bring her back too? “I just mean, you’ve been having a rough go, so it’s… it’s good to see you smile.” He smiled tersely at his older brother, hoping that his internal turmoil wasn’t showing. They needed a moment to just sit back and be happy that Cas was back.
“Hi, Claire,” Jody replied. “It’s… it’s Sam and Dean.”
Cas paused a moment, realizing that he hadn’t come up with a cover story. “A, uh, little kid. With, uh, cancer. Healed him up so that he can grow up and become a singer.”
Dean froze. Cas bristled in anger.
“J-Jack. Jack Kline.” In a brief moment of clarity, he figured it would be safer not to use the name Winchester. “He turned six months old a few days ago.”
They were almost there. All they needed were the hearts, and they’d be able to get Mom back. Anticipation crawled up his chest, making his heart race.
“She’s good. She’s back to a healthy weight, now we’re just working on the night terrors. It’s slow going.”
“Missouri reads objects, it’s kind of her thing,” Dean explained.
She stopped in her tracks and dropped her duffel. Alex jumped up. Her eyes were glassed over. Another vision. She gasped as the vision ended, then raced down the stairs. Alex followed her. Claire and Kaia looked up from playing with Claire’s plush Grumpy Cat with Jack.
Cas smirked, and pulled his Fearless cassette tape out of the box. Dean had helped him make cassettes of all of Taylor Swift’s albums after he’d refused to put any sort of adapter in his baby.
“It’s my fault he’s gone,” Dean argued, “It’s my fault. And now he can’t….” He inhaled deeply. “I don’t know that he should, even if he weren’t….” He thought back to that day, when Cas had found them in the entryway. How despite everything, despite the things Dean had said and done, he had healed Dean’s gimped-out knee.
“I’ll check it out,” Dean said.
Dean passed a beer to Sam, and then turned to watch Jack sleep. There was something incredibly mournful in his eyes. Sam didn’t want to think about what they’d lost, though, not right now.
“You’re a demon.” Sam scoffed.
“Dean, do you need help?” Cas asked, adjusting Jack’s position on his hip.
The woman stared at them incredulously, though Sam wasn’t sure if that was due to the baby strapped to Dean’s chest or Sam’s accusation that she did not recognize her own neighbor. “I’ve lived next to Erica for six years. I watered her plants every time she and Wes took vacation. I’m certain it was her.”
Kaia sat up, looking at her with those wise, teary brown eyes. “Tell me what?”
Jody opened the door to find Patience Turner standing on her doorstep.
“He has your eyes now,” Mary marveled.
“Time to go,” Claire announced, turning and running back the way they came. The Winchesters followed closely behind.
Cas stepped toward Dean slowly, as though he weren’t sure if he were welcome back. Somewhere inside him, a levee broke. Tears suddenly welling in his eyes, he rushed forward and wrapped the angel in a hug that would have cracked his ribs if he were an ordinary human. He felt Cas sag against him as he wrapped his arms around the hunter in return. “Welcome home, pal.” He didn’t want to let him go. But he needed to get him home. Back to Sam. And Jack. He backed up, discreetly wiping away the tears that had dripped down his cheeks.
Dean nodded. He could never argue with Missouri. Besides, he couldn’t let her lose her family. Not like he had lost his. “Yes, ma’am.”
John frowned. “A deaf hunter?”
“Baby,” she shot back. Claire slapped her hand away.
“You don’t do this to anyone else.”
“You remembered!” His joy is guileless, and it makes Cas want to bring him every sweet thing under this sterile dome.
Why did he have to be so selfish?
many things?”
“Well,
from him in return. So what did this wolf want?
She simply shrugs.
The past two weeks have been excruciating for Cas and Sam. Lawyers keep them both at arm’s length, and Crowley and Naomi have abandoned the family in order to save their own reputations. Sam was finally able to see Dick Roman just the day before, and the news is not at all good. Roman is raising a public outcry against his hand-picked favorite. He is calling for charges of fraud and breach of contract to be added to the government’s already lengthy list.
Unfortunately, despite his planning, he was still too slow, as even now the sun was about to brush the horizon. He was going to be late.
Cas looks down into those big, mossy eyes. “Yes.”
He whimpered pathetically.
“When I’m around you, Dean, I want… I want to always be with you. I want you to show me the world, show me all new things. I want to take care of you. I want you to want to take care of me. I want…” he drifted off, dropping his head on his precious wolf’s shoulder, breathing his scent in. “I want to scent you. I want to touch you. I want-” he said, gasping in surprise.
“Tracing them,” Castiel said, as if that was the most normal thing in the world. “They’re so beautiful.”
Until Sunrise.
“Dean?” Castiel said, eyes fluttering open.
Inside the mansion, past the security checkpoint and metal detector, there was an ornate lobby with an adjoining waiting room - smoking and non-smoking. Several attendants stood behind counters as Alphas waited in line. At last, it was his turn.
Shaking his head, Dean says, “I’m not leaving without Sam. I know that this has ruined him by association. I can’t just run out on him.”
Shokunin: “Workers”
“You’re an absolute prodigy, Dean.”
As the snarling duo depart, Dean leans back on his hands, letting the roar of the water drown them out. This shoot isn’t his last job of the day, unfortunately. He has a concert later this evening that will be streamed throughout the country.
“But we had fish before and it didn’t look or taste anything like this.”
*****
“Oh, that’s alright,” Dean said, finally catching up with reality and fumbling with his pants. He blushed as he stepped out of them, not sure why he was embarrassed all of a sudden. He’d stripped hundreds of times before.
“You don’t understand, Cas!” he said, voice cracking. His body began to shake. “The doctor… the doctor said I only had a few viable eggs left.” He swallowed. His next words came out as little more than a thin whisper. “What if he took them?”
you. I
Dean sleeps like the dead. Cas wakes with the dawn and watches him sleep for long minutes before he sets everything up for their short stay. He pumps some clean water into his holding tank, picks over the firewood and brings in a few small logs to start a fire. He doesn’t have perishable food out here except for what he has planted. By the end of the year, he should be able to barter for some chickens and build a pen for them. The bees were easier. He’s had active hives here for over a year. They don’t take much tending, not like chickens.
The man in the skirt turns slowly, his eyes darting all over the impressive figure Dean makes in his platform boots and broad-shouldered coat. It’s all meant to intimidate, and it more than did its job with the unsuspecting Castiel.
He yelped in pain, breath slowing. The pain was fading.
“Just leave me, Castiel. I can’t run anymore, I can’t stand, I can barely think, Cas…” he said, trailing off with a needy whine.
“Interested? I’d be surprised if he wasn’t already involved.”
It was eerie.
Dean picked up the cloak, staring at it. What did it mean?
At last, he felt Dean’s warm tongue lick at the slit of his hardening cock. Cas immediately buried a hand in his Omega’s hair, grasping it and running his thumb through the prickly softness.
“I’m already a hundred positions below your status, Dean. Knowing you were there watching my failure is the only reason it actually stung. I hated that job. I’m thrilled to leave it behind. But. Having you see me humiliated in public by that-”
But the sun was going down, and the sky was turning orange.
“I cannot say. It would not be appropriate.”
Castiel had loved it.
That done, Dean stood up straight, slowly pulling his fingers out from his love.
“I’ll take 30 minutes.”
She wrinkles her nose and waves him along. She talks to him all the way to the table where she seats him, but she faces forward, so he only understands every third or fourth word. Honestly, he doesn’t care to hear her. His eyes are scanning every face in the crowd, trying to find the one he’s here to see.
“Maybe not consciously, but shit like this doesn’t come free. So, tell me. Who did this?”
Cas hesitates with his hand on the door handle. “The owner is destroying something that is a priceless work of art. It was painted before Kanpeki Basho existed, and we have so little left from that time. I couldn’t let him ruin it.”
“Dean?”
Dean took a few more deep breaths, trying his best to center himself, to gather his strength.
The electricity between them lights up Cas’s body and mind. He sees the desire in Dean’s eyes, but he doubts it means anything. Dean has never been able to be this close to another person. Of course he’s going to feel new emotions, feel interest. It’s the novelty of it, not anything to do with him.
“That I don’t know. I have a few ideas where one might be, but you’re going to have to consult someone a bit more educated than me. The Worthy are hard to find, as, being the only mortals able to pass between realms, demons will capture them and drag them to Niflhel where they drain them of their powerful blood for the rest of their lives - or, for the ones that have been gifted eternal life, the rest of forever. It’s quite lovely. So, there are only a couple Worthy mortals that I’ve heard might yet be alive in Alfheim.”
Smiling against his lips, Cas asks, “It’s nice, isn’t it?”
Dean nods, his eyes laser-focused on Cas as he sits back on his knees to untie his robe. It seems to take forever, a watched pot refusing to boil. Dean runs his hands over every bit of skin that is unwrapped.
Cas peers at the gorgeous man behind one of artfully-placed privacy walls. He’s sitting at a table in the center of the room, eating a fluffy salad full of vivid colors. People around him are trying not to stare, but they are losing the battle more often than not.
“Nothing to worry about, Fergus,” she curls her lip as if tasting something reprehensible. “We need him to dress out here because he won’t be able to walk in the tail.”
They are just a few minutes into the video, the part where the fake Dean staggers and his shirt falls off his shoulder, when Cas makes a choked sound and jumps up. “Stop!”
“Cas…” he said, voice trembling. He took a deep breath, and suddenly the world was dark again, dark save for his love’s bright hand. Dean could still feel the power rushing from it, through him. He could hardly bear it.
Castiel knew that wasn’t true. Yet he still dared to wait.
“There were several calls those two women got - several buyers. Only one would buy someone that pretty.”
Castiel’s smile fell. “I can’t.”
“Are your parents deceased?”
Dean nods and the air between them changes. A tension draws like a tightening bowstring, bringing awareness of each other to the forefront. As they quietly undress, they study each other. Cas hasn’t done this for a very long time. Despite his experience, his wild days are long behind him. He hasn’t had a fling in ages, and even when he did, he wouldn’t let them have this kind of access to his body.
It was… strange.
“Until next Black Moon.”
“You can
At last, when they arrived home, a very tired Castiel immediately set about preparing for bed. Just before climbing in, though, he looked at the small bag of tea he’d been given.
Dean. His Dean. He was right here. But there was no light in his sunken eyes - eyes that were locked on something thousands of miles away.
“Oh great. Now we can see every detail of this horror show in stunning clarity,” Cas snarks when the video begins. It is amazingly sharp and clear where it had been a little fuzzy before.
He isn’t expecting to be jostled by Dean dropping down directly next to him, but it makes him happy to feel him this close.
“I was hoping so. Would you like it to be?” Cas is standing closer than he should, basking in Dean’s heat. He can actually feel the puffs of air from his excited breath ruffling his eyelashes. Dean bites his lip and looks away for a moment, maybe to think or maybe to gather his defenses.
Castiel just hoped he’d wake up afterwards.
He couldn’t see, but he could tell by the splash of water and the rush of ice cold shooting up his legs that he’d made it to the water.
The Alphas did not respond, merely shooting several arrows in him that buried in his chest.
He started shaking.
“Am I,” Dean said, taking a breath, “am I right? Is it a curse?”
“Oh! I’m sorry! I disrupted you,” Cas said, immediately backing away. With his touch gone, the chill immediately returned, leaving Dean feeling so…
After that?
“Jimmy!” He shouted in dismay as his brother fell to his feet. He couldn’t help it. His heat and hit just that morning. It was night now, so it was a wonder he could even stand. And Castiel’s own heat would soon follow.
Suddenly, the Omega made a gentle noise.
“Yes,” Cas sighs and leans his head on Dean’s shoulder. His head knocks gently against Cas’s, always eager to find contact. Dean points out things in the sky and Cas explains them long into the night. Their eyes are getting heavy out here in the fresh air. Dean thinks that it smells sweet and fresh, like purity. He could be happy with that scent tickling his nose forever.
But he could do this. Only two more.
“Yeah, the ‘tea’ she gave me, it did this.”
The Omega keened, grabbing onto Dean’s arms so hard his knuckles turned white, breath hitching at the feeling of Dean’s knot tugging at his rim, stretching him wider and wider. He almost couldn’t bear it.
Dean’s curiosity definitely piqued, he asks several more follow up questions before exclaiming, “Cars gave them a freedom to go wherever they wanted.”
“Yes, you can. You deserve to enjoy your life, Dean.”
?“ he asked, hurt by those awful words. The words that couldn’t be true. "Why would a
He fell back, not fighting the tears that fell down his cheeks. He wanted to hold his son. His daughter. He wanted to hold them close. He ached for them.
“Mm hmm,” she said, pulling down a large tome with the words On Reversing Magic emblazoned on the spine. “What else do you know?”
“Well, it’s a little offensive since we’re married. ‘Boyfriend’ suggests a less serious commitment,” Cas said to Dean before turning to the drunk guy. “Was that your intention, to insult us by trivialising our relationship?”
Any desire to move was gone. He just wanted to lie there while Cas looked at him like that. Dean felt beautiful, powerful... loved. He licked his lips and watched as Cas’s eyes followed his tongue. Dean ran his hands up Cas’s thighs until they gripped his hips.
Dean looked toward the bedroom like that might give him some clue about Cas’s breakfast preferences.
“Yes, you are,” Ellen agreed and patted his cheek. “Night, boys.”
Dean went to the bathroom to clean himself up when Cas was finished. When he came back, Cas was lying in bed again. He climbed in beside him and Cas rolled toward him, curling up against his side sleepily. Dean was happy to accept the affectionate cuddling, whether it was an unconscious impulse or not. He sighed happily and fell into a deep sleep almost immediately.
For those who didn’t watch The Good Wife- Jason was played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, so Dean dislikes the character because he looks like his dad.
“Oh god, Cas, you made pie?”
“Of course, there's only one bed. We’re married,” Cas told him yet again. He was so sick of having to say that.
“Right, go do that then. I have everything under control,” he reiterated.
“I like that, choosing your own meaning,” Dean said and smiled at Cas.
“Nah, not remotely. You get the occasional Freddie Mercury or Rob Halford, but, historically, rock and metal are pretty hetero. Still, the phrase ‘backdoor man’ is in songs by Led Zepp and The Doors as well as AC/DC,” Dean said, lounging against the fridge and taking a long pull on his beer before adding, “I think the commonly accepted meaning is actually a guy having an affair with a married woman who has to sneak out the back when her husband comes home. But I always liked to think the guys singing it were aware of the other connotations it had.”
“I think I'm adorable.” Dean grinned at him.
“Never seen the guy before in my life, Sammy!”
“I only go by Loki professionally. A mononym gives me a certain cachet, like Lizzo or McG.” Gabriel winked before continuing, “And I used to live in LA, but I live here now. I still keep a pied-à-terre in LA since I have to go there so often for work. That’s probably why your little FBI friend found an address for me there.”
Cas broke their kiss to say, “Wanna go to the bedroom?”
“Nothing to be sorry for. This is how I like to wake up, with a big, hot, hard dick pressed against me.” He winked lasciviously.
“No answer, well, ain’t that convenient?”
“There, now you can fuck me, Cas Novak,” Dean said, grinning up at him.
John had grabbed Dean by the collar and started yelling angry insults at him, quickly graduating to physical blows when Dean didn’t react to words. Even then, Dean hadn’t done anything, too numb to fight back against the sudden violence. Sam had grabbed John’s arm, trying to protect Dean, even though that wasn’t his job. John had backhanded him across the face before going back to hitting Dean while Sam sat, stunned, on the dirty floor where he’d landed.
Heaven wasn't meant to hurt this much. Dean had begun to suspect he was actually in hell. Perhaps it had gotten an upgrade since he was last there. Now there was a hundred percent less flaying and hundred percent more pain. Purely psychological torture that cut so much deeper than Alastair's knife ever had.
Dean liked to cook breakfast on the weekends instead of just grabbing a quick slice of toast or a bowl of cereal like he did during the week. He liked it even better if he got to cook it for someone else, whether that was Sam or Charlie or the gorgeous guy currently sleeping in his bed. A smile spread across his face. Cas was definitely someone he wouldn’t mind cooking for.
The loveseat turned out to be damn uncomfortable and the cosy looking blanket was scratchy. He couldn’t pretzel his limbs up tight enough to be able to lie down properly, so he draped himself over both ends of the couch awkwardly for an hour before giving up.
“Hey!” Dean objected automatically and then made a face like he wasn't sure if he should be offended or flattered. After all, Wash and Mal were both equally awesome, but he couldn't help thinking that being a captain was just sexier. Captain Kirk, Captain America, hell, even Han Solo counted as Captain of the freaking Millennium Falcon if you wanted to be technical about it. Dean shrugged off the comment and stepped up to Charlie, poking at her dress. “Are you really wearing a hooped skirt to a club, though?”
He should probably clean up too, but moving felt like too much effort. Idly, Dean ran his fingers through the come on his stomach. He wished he was covered in Cas's come instead of his own, though an orgasm Cas had wrung out of him, even by proxy, was almost as good. Dean floated in a post-orgasm haze, his mind fuzzy.
amnesia,” Cas qualified, looking increasingly agitated.
Shaking his head, he went to prep his workstation. He could hear soft voices from the front of the shop but didn’t pay any attention to what was being said, trusting that Meg would really do her best to make it up to Alfie. He felt his phone vibrate in his pocket and dug it out.
Meg poured coffee from the French press into a mug that said ‘I Like My Coffee Black Just Like My Metal’ on the side and nudged it over to him. Cas added an ungodly amount of cream and watched as the coffee lightened. Looking down at the milky colour, he wondered if there was such a thing as beige metal, the mildest of all the metal subgenres. He stirred in a spoonful of sugar and took a grateful sip.
“You know what! Even
“This looks great,” he said, wrapping an arm round Cas’s waist as he stood next to him after placing a plate in front of Dean. He was entirely sincere since, despite his conflicted feelings about the turducken, it did look and smell amazing.
“My love, we have all the time in the world. We have forever.”
“Yes,” Dean moaned. “Please.”
“But I'm thankful for things.” Cas frowned, wrinkling his nose adorably. “There are too many turkey-based holidays. It’s confusing. I don’t see why you wouldn’t be thankful on Christmas too.”
“Yeah.” Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “Yeah, still trying to get past that one. I mean, I know I'm not, not really. Plenty of things have proven to me that, empirically at least, I'm not a complete idiot. But I still
“You do?” Cas sounded surprised.
“Different kind of wildcat, sweetheart,” Dean said, flashing him a grin. “They’re a baseball team. We’ll be at the stadium in a couple of hours.”
Cas went off and bustled around the kitchen, getting pie from the fridge, finding a plate to serve up a slice, putting coffee in an old percolator, and he didn’t stare at Dean the whole time he did it. Dean sat down at the small table and watched the angel for a change. Perhaps he should find him more homemaking stuff to do because this was almost comfortable.
“Meds were expensive,” Cas said. “But ink was cheap when your best friend was apprenticing as a tattoo artist. She saw some drawings of molecular structures and used them for a sketch. It’s honeycomb and neurotransmitters. I liked the design, so she offered to tattoo me with it—said that way I’d always have some extra serotonin if I needed it.”
“You... what... You promised me pie- in our vows? That must have been some weird ass wedding!”
Please leave kudos if you liked it because I crave your validation the way Dean craves his father's approval! I'd absolutely love to hear from you if you want to leave a comment too :)
But maybe their failure had been the real reason for the task, or at least as much of a factor in sending them out as the idea that they could attract more young people to the Church.
Cas was still looking at Dean like he wanted to fuck him into next week and Dean prayed he would, into next week, into next year, into the next decade and beyond. He was so glad to have this. To get to see the soft, silly side of this serious man. He knew Cas's willingness to joke was a sign that he was getting comfortable with him again.
Instead, he said, “I think they’re delicious, but if you want them to be even better, add the salt before they go into the pan and take them off the heat about thirty seconds sooner than you did. Also, half and half or cream will make them fluffier than two percent milk. I’ll show you how I make mine next time if you want.”
“Is it me, or does God seem like he’s really insecure? Why does he feel the need to finish his declarations with ‘I am the Lord’ all the time?” Dean said, making Cas snort. “It feels like he’s trying a bit too hard to swing his dick around, right?”
“C'mon Barbie, let's go party!” Charlie sang, oblivious to Dean’s inner musings. She grabbed his arm and hustled him out the door.
“My pleasure,” he said, standing up.
“I wish I was inside you right now, Dean, feeling your body clench around me. You're always so tight when I first get my fingers in you. It takes you a while to open up, but when you do and I finally get inside you, it's like your body doesn't want to let me go.”
“There’s no girl, Bobby!” Sam burst out.
“Good things coming out of bad experiences? I think I like that better too.” They grinned at each other and Cas continued, “I don’t always understand it, but I do enjoy Eliasson’s work. He’s done a few installations that are kind of like free-standing waterfalls. From the back or the side, you can see the scaffolding and supports but from the front, it’s almost like the water appears from nowhere, like there’s a rip in the fabric of space and water is just pouring in from a river in a parallel universe. It’s magical.”
“Oh, shush..." Dean could feel his cheeks warm. "I’m thankful for you too.”
Ellen had scowled a lot at first and it’d taken Dean a week to realise that she was frowning at his bruises and not at him. She wasn’t angry at him, but angry at what had been done to him. It had taken Dean some time to get used to that, adults being protective of him.
“You two go ahead, I think I’ll stay here and finish my beer.”
There only seemed to be three possible outcomes when Castiel offered someone a leaflet about the Church and tried to engage them in a discussion about saving their souls. The response was usually polite disinterest, vague annoyance or outright mockery. Teenagers could be cruel and Castiel and his comrades, with their stilted speech and too formal clothing, were easy targets.
Pies aside, Dean wasn’t even sure if he should get Cas a Christmas present or if it was too soon for that too. It didn’t feel too soon to him, but maybe it would to Cas. It didn't matter. He probably wouldn’t get to see Cas to give him a gift before he flew out on Tuesday, anyway. A plane ticket would definitely be an inappropriate gift at this juncture, right? Dean just wished Cas was coming with him. And not just because he was flying alone since both Sam and Charlie weren’t flying out till Thursday.
Dean thought. Cas drank the beer without complaint, even though Dean knew he would have preferred something sweeter. They chatted for a while before Dean glanced over at the crowded dancefloor.
“Oh, Cas.” Dean reached out to cup Cas’s cheek, looking like he was about to cry.
Dean wasn’t the only one with irrational fears. How did Sam like it when someone didn’t take those fears seriously?
Dean laughed. “It’s cute.”
of his room. He figured that was Sam’s way of saying, ‘I’m cool with you kissing a dude, but you’re my brother and maybe I don’t need to see you kissing that dude quite so enthusiastically’. Which was fair enough, he had no interest in seeing Sammy get that carried away with a partner either.
“I’ll have a word with her,” he promised and gave Alfie’s shoulder a comforting squeeze. The young man smiled up at him. He looked more relaxed as he got his sketchbook out of his bag and sat down on the stool behind the counter.
Cas didn’t need to do a whole lot to get him off. It was enough for him just to stand there. Standing was good because this was supposed to be for Cas and Dean didn’t think that getting the angel to blow him in a skeezy bar bathroom was something he was doing for Cas’s sake. The idea seemed blasphemous somehow, or, at the very least, obscene. Of course, that kind of turned him on more. Normally, he’d be all over Cas and blasphemous acts. He really did love getting Cas all filthy. Lately, though, he was feeling protective. The idea of leading Cas astray scared him. What if he went too far, did something that crossed the line from fun debauchery to flat out degrading? There was something about Cas that was so good and so pure. He didn’t want to soil that. He didn't want to hurt Cas again.
Dean smiled ruefully. He could relate. It seemed like every queer person had been asked that question at some stage. Or the version Dean got, which was ‘which one of you is the woman?’.
Amy Pond.”
“OK, answer me this, if you’re my loving, angel boyfriend-”
Of course, it had been Dean’s fault that Sammy wasn’t safe. Sam didn't blame him for getting hurt or them running away as a result. ‘Better that we got out sooner rather than later,’ Sam had said, which only made him feel more guilty for not getting Sam out sooner.
“What? Why?” Meg asked, glancing over her shoulder and sounding genuinely surprised.
Dean maintained—was facing away from the floor to ceiling windows that made up two of the gallery’s walls. This meant that even though the gallery was brightly lit, the mouth of the box was dim. The container got darker and darker the further they went.
“I pay attention to the things you tell me,” Cas replied, ducking his head shyly and shrugging.
“Meat man!” Dean said, jabbing his thumb towards his chest.
“Best Christmas ever,” Dean told Cas again, before falling asleep wrapped in his arms, cosy and content.
“Would you like to come back to mine?”
“Aw, come on, Bobby, we’re not teenagers anymore. You never harangue Jo like this,” Sam said.
The entrance to the box—
Dean accidentally inhaled his beer and only just managed not to spit it all over Charlie’s dress. She narrowed her eyes at the near miss, which Dean thought was rich given she was the one who’d made him asphyxiate on his damn drink.
“She called you her
“Fine,” he huffed.
Dean was distracted by the thoughts, so he was too slow to stop Cas when he plucked the magazine from Dean’s hands and started flicking through it. Dean watched in horror as Cas turned the magazine sideways to pull out the centrefold. He tilted his head to look at it thoughtfully and then leant over to Dean.
You should come over again soon. We still have to watch Back to the Future 3
“You don’t think I’m dumb ‘cause I don’t understand the art?” Dean sounded just a little vulnerable and, again, Cas wondered where Dean got the ridiculous idea that he was stupid or that Cas would ever think that about him.
