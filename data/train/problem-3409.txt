Peeking out of the living room window, Dean tried to see the tell-tale lights of Castiel’s wagon through the snow. Nothing. The road was dark. Was he okay? He was still new to driving, had he skidded on ice and gotten hurt?
Something unclenched in Dean’s chest and he let out a choked sob through gritted teeth. “I don’t wanna forget him.” He keened, trying to even his breaths when it pulled on his injuries. “I
“Eh, don’t mention it, kid.” Clapping Cas’s shoulder as he pulled away, Bobby was quick to pull Dean in as well. “Take it slow, okay? You need help, you call me.”
Humming, Jack tilted his head again as he searched for a way to begin. "It started when Lucifer possessed the body of the President, who was my mother's lover at the time. She got pregnant. You and Sam and Cas eventually showed up to tell her what was happening, so she decided she didn't want to have Satan's baby, but Lucifer attacked her, so she escaped instead. Then, she decided to keep me when I saved her life, after which some angels found her. Then,
Castiel faltered, however. "With my grace back, so are my powers, Dean. I don't want to hurt you accidentally." Last thing they needed was for him to grab on too tightly and break Dean a hip.
Dean eyed the other, clever green eyes taking him in. No doubt wondering if it was just one more empty promise, one more disappointment in the making, and suddenly Cas felt
Cas watched him with concern, letting Bobby walk past him and down the stairs first. "Are you sure? Your grace—"
Evidently, Bobby thought the same, as he let out a small, humorless chuckle out of nowhere. “We’re fucking
He’d ask the Lord for strength if he wasn’t trying to get them killed, apparently. Instead, Castiel brushed off the crumbs that landed on his shirt. “Well. Yes, I guess. In the middle of the night. Like–
Preparing, Dean reached and held on to the cord dangling out of him, waiting. When the time came to push, he
Castiel could feel himself begin to tremble, inhaling deeply and savoring Dean’s scent, citrusy and heavy with want, want,
Castiel flexed his hands again, restless. “An angel’s grace could, in simplistic terms, be compared to a human’s soul. It is unique and a part of us. I died with it. In fact, I was atomized.” He grouched, mouth a thin line. “For Gabriel to bring me back, he would have to reverse it and it would be impossible for him to do so without putting my grace back together. He doesn’t have the power.”
I was going to have this up two days ago, or part of it, but then decided I shouldn't separate any of it, so here it is, a massive chapter.
I love you, people. Every time I post a chapter, the next morning I check my inbox and light up when I read what you think, be it the usuals who have stuck with me this far and the newcomers.
Swallowing hard, the angel clenched his eyes shut. Dean– Every time, his kin mistook Dean for the source of his corruption. Of his fall. Of his
Castiel understood then, frowning at his plate. “He’s not processing his grief.” He stated, looking up for confirmation.
"Sammy?" Quickly, Dean made his way towards his brother, naked feet slapping against concrete. "Sam, can you hear me?"
Dean let out a shuddering breath as his only reply, rolling his hips again and groaning at the feeling of the hard length brushing inside of him. “Not hasty enough.” He griped. Cas was hot and thick, and he wanted nothing else than for him to move but the logical, experienced side of Dean knew better than to rush it. Not only would he risk getting hurt (and wouldn’t that be a bitch) but he would also be making sure Castiel would never lay a hand on him
Castiel huffed out a breathless chuckle. "I'm terrified." He admitted. “But— Also content? I thought I’d be sad when the time came for me to part with my grace.” Cas shook his head. “I’m not, even though I missed it so dearly before, because I know it’ll be put to good use, by people I trust. Is it odd?”
Dean fidgeted. “Yeah, okay.” He said at last. “You’re right. Just,” He scratched below his ear, clearing his throat. “Drive ahead, okay? I know the first address; we’ll meet you there. This might… take a while.”
, unable to sustain his weight, after the much needed abuse Gabriel had put them through. About to call out again, Dean paused instead, listening to the approaching sound of steps. Peeking through the frame of the mattress, the omega felt his heart skip a beat.
Sam snorted, then. “I hope it’s worth more than your beau’s reassurances.” Dean punched him in the thigh, hard enough to bruise for sure. The alpha shoved him away in retaliation. “I mean it— I’m glad you went full domestic, I am!”
He couldn't see his face, like everything in the room, but his heart skipped a beat and he knew: he was his.
butter you up.” At Castiel’s low hum of agreement, Dean kicked him lightly in the ankle with a socked foot in retaliation. “Still, it’s— It’s not a renovation. Or about the house, at all.”
“No.” Slamming his bottle down on the side table, Dean stood and glowered at Cas. “We’ve had this talk before, Cas. God— God’s an asshole, alright? He doesn’t care.” He spat. “About us, about
, man.” He grimaced, the image burned into his retinas and, quite possibly, still smeared on his clothes.
“First, we need to get the hell out of here.” Waving Bobby over, Dean flinched when Chuck tried to stop him with an energy blast, which Gabriel thankfully deflected. They heard a tree branch fall onto the roof, likely severed by the blow. “C’mon!”
Reaching out, Cas placed a hand on Dean’s left shoulder, right where his handprint had once been. “I just don’t want you to think you’re doing this alone. This is
Dean wakes early in the morning, confused. It’s not unusual for him to wake in the middle of the night, still unused to the house’s sounds and Cas’s soft snuffles beside him, but it’s different, this time.
“Will be.” Grunted Dean, shifting. Gripping the other’s hand, he guided it beneath his bump and pressed it to the skin, under the shirt and right where Jack kept grinding his little foot with a vengeance. “When you tell him to
At that, Dean frowned further, trying to draw the family tree in his head. "But you said your mother's name was Kelly."

Castiel ignored the hand and stood on his own, rigid. Dean wanted to scoff and nearly did, only swallowing it down when Cas looked back at him. As it was usual with the angel, the intensity with which Cas’ gaze pinned him left him to clench his jaw and stare right back. “Are
Dean shook his head. “No, like— A distinctive smell everyone produces.” Looking carefully, he couldn’t find any signs of glands in the other, either. “You don’t have a sub-gender.” He concluded, baffled.
Pulling his head out of the Impala’s engine, Dean glared at Sam, who was sitting on top of his workstation reading a dumb book. “Shut the
Picking up the last of the roots they would need, Gabriel shook some of the dirt off them with a grimace. "Cassie?"
, taking part of the discomfort with it. His nausea diminished, his dizziness vanished and all that mattered was the other man’s scent, soothing and calming and so friggin’
Castiel stared at it for a beat before he grabbed it and shoved it deep in the glove compartment. It shut with a sharp snap, crushing the shopping bag amidst trinkets and empty packages of granola.
“If I want—” Reaching, Dean pulled the other into a kiss, uncaring that he was crinkling the forms as he buried his fingers in Cas’s messy hair. Smiling as Castiel laughed into his mouth, Dean eventually pulled back, rejuvenated. “Hell
And he sounded so unsure, Dean had to look directly at him. “Yeah.” He reassured. “Cas— He could be knocking on our door, back from the dead, right now.” Swallowing hard, Dean still felt trepidation as he voiced his thoughts, like the ghost of John Winchester would be jumping him the moment he finished. “This, us— It wouldn’t change. Not a thing.”
.” Then Dean sighed, pulling down the coat. There were bags under his eyes, and he was a little pale. Castiel’s heart squeezed in sympathy. He knew he hadn’t been sleeping well. “I keep having to
you.” Leaning a shoulder against the wall, he watched the others. “It was a good death, mind you. Poetic, even, but you were always an

Gabriel eventually manages to break the seal on Castiel's grace with Jack's unexpected help, which returns the angel status to Cas and helps him see Jack is to be trusted.
.” And Dean sagged, relief oozing out of him in waves. “I no longer have a place in Heaven, Dean.” He’d be killed on sight, for fathering a Nephil. “And even if I did, I wouldn’t go.” Reaching, Castiel brushed the back of his hand over Dean’s mating bite. “I made a choice, Dean. I chose
“I’ll be happy to share.” Waiting for the other to lie down, Castiel made sure to tuck the sheets comfortably around them.
"But why?" Dean wondered, looking back down. Teeny tiny ten little fingers and ten little toes, he counted. Rosy. If he squinted, he could barely make out tufts of soft blond hair. Reaching, he was stopped by the gentle sound of rustling wings.
.” Dean tensed, frustrated. Just as fast, he sagged into the nest, out of steam. “I’m just— ready for this to be
While angels did not present, their vessels did. As such, they had an inimitable scent, almost like their own unique grace.
, simple is always best, right?” Spreading the notes over the lump that were Dean’s legs, Sam ran his eyes down the instructions and kept prattling information. “Ribbons made of spider silk, soaked in dill oil and licorice root extract. That’s
Then came the feelings, so many and all at once that Castiel had trouble thinking through them. Anger felt like holy fire, burning and scathing. Contentment like a soothing breeze during a hot afternoon. Sadness, like cloudy day, a missed opportunity.
Eventually, the lump of flesh eased out of him and onto the floor with a wet flop, and the omega sucked in a shaky breath, panting, legs weak.
Standing up, Dean took in the gown he was wearing and the blood coating his thighs, the scars on his body and deflated belly.
“One, he’s not the boss of me.” Spat the blond. Dude might be his mate and an alpha but that did not mean he was owned. “Two, he
“Well, it was either using blockers or avoiding you until you’re through your rut, and I didn’t want to avoid you, so.” A nonchalant shrug.
Taking pity on him, Castiel let him go. “I’m sorry. It’s the truth, nevertheless. And you deserve to hear it.” Smiling when Dean looked back at him, the angel gave him a soft look. Dean has learned to brace when the other looked at him so. “You think you’re so hard to love when it’s the easiest thing I’ve learned how to do in eons of existence.”
Then, and before they knew it, it was New Years Eve and Dean had paced circles into their wooden floors as he considered chickening out but, by the time the clock struck twelve,
Smiling, a small quirk of his mouth, Dean nodded. “Okay.” He conceded. “Tell me, then.” Dean tapped the journal.
Dean smiled gratefully at the attempt to sooth him. At once, he wished the Impala was there, and not crumpled in their garage; he craved the comfort and familiarity of his Baby but knew, unfortunately, that he would have to settle for second best, so Dean just sighed a little “Sure.”
“Tell me you doubt it.” When the other remained silent, Dean sighed. “You know it’s true. So, yeah, it’s— it
Dean clearly recognized that and beat him to the punch. "No deals." The angel tensed. "I mean it, Cas. You— Bobby will be there, we both know it, but if I don't make it, you'll be the only one Jack has. You'll be on the run, too, from angels and a bunch of other assholes. You can't
Cas laughed against him. “I’m sure you are.” He murmured, gripping Dean’s hips and pulling them flush against his, feeling the other’s erection brush against his through the thin fabric of Dean’s boxer briefs. “Very,
. Billions of years and all of them, wasted, trying to uphold the integrity and righteousness of their mission, only to be proven wrong.
Turning, resolute, Dean walked away with Billie and into nothingness, knowing it would be useless to linger.
Destruction and death flashed through his mind and Cas reopened his eyes, lips pressed into a tight line. In all of time, no nephil had shied away from violence. From murder. From
— Jokes aside, it’s fine, Cas.” Rubbing the small of the other’s back, Dean gave Cas’s backside a small pat when he pulled away. The alpha glared a little, still red up to the tips of his ears, but his eyes were mischievous. “It’s normal. Plus,” Dean grinned again, winking. “Just means we’ll have to practice, get the awkwardness out of the way.” He teased, finger gunning the other.
“As long as it ain’t meatloaf, I’m in!” Gabriel bellowed from the couch, legs throw over the back as he read a magazine upside down.
Walls up and wooden floors fixed, they bought a second-hand three-seater, two matching armchairs (all tan, to Castiel’s delight and Dean’s consternation) and some furniture, on top of which Dean demanded they place a decently sized tv so he could begin to educate Cas on pop culture.
? Knowing he had an eye on them was one thing, to have him chase their asses across the world was another completely different. Much more
Twirling on his feet, Dean stood face to face with Crowley. “Oh, just the face I wanted to see as my body cooled.” He sarcastically drawled.
"Guess we got the right place." Bobby mumbled, walking inside after the angel, only to bump into his back. "Oy."
Before Castiel could react, Dean was straightening in his lap and the bulbs in the infirmary were bursting violently, showering them with sparks. Suddenly, the room filled with the true voice of an angel, forcing Sam to his knees.
Castiel was sitting up, arms shaking as he fought to get upright. "What—" Confused, he looked around at the mess. Then, noticing his burns, he flexed his hand, but nothing happened. "My grace is gone." Cas murmured, breath hitching. His head was throbbing, pain pulsing up his neck, over his mating bite. Sam sat frozen, watching as Bobby hurried to the other's side. "Did it work? The spell?"
“Not personally.” Castiel replied, feeling the weight of Dean’s gaze on him like lead. “But I was part of such flights, yes.”
— Your father consented, Gabriel was just trying to help.” He soothed, wrapping his radiance around the child’s and all but cradling him. “Stop. It’s
Watching quietly, Bobby reached and squeezed the other’s shoulder supportively. “It’s okay to be tired.” He reassured. “And
Dean stood there, naked save for his socks and the crumpled boxer briefs around his knees, with an embarrassed grimace on his face. “I can’t bend.” He admitted, wiggling his toes.
Dean twisted in his seat, glaring. Lesser demons would have fled on sight. "Next time someone treats me like an invalid, I'm going to start throwing punches." Bobby leaned back, looking guilty. "Gabriel, tell me where to."
Stepping aside, Bobby let him see. "I haven't moved him yet." He grunted, uncharacteristically nervous, as they both laid eyes on the blubbering little form lying between Dean's thighs. "He's still attached to the cord and I dunno what to do."
, stop.” Cas begged, to no avail. At the faint sound of steps, Castiel leaned down to quickly press a farewell kiss to Dean’s forehead.
Following the ringtone to the living room, Dean quickly found the device on top of the mantle and under some cuttings of paneling. Not checking the ID, he accepted the call and balanced the phone between his ear and shoulder, cleaning a bit. “Go for Dean.”
“Fair enough.” Said Dean eventually, scent receding as he settled down. He felt Cas’s do the same before his hand left him. “Sorry.” He was all sarcasm, though.
Throat tight, Dean only nodded. Leaning in, he brushed his lips to Jack’s forehead, and smiled when the baby seemed to quieten, weeping rather than crying out loud. Then, he did the same to Cas, squeezing his eyes shut as he committed his scent to memory.
Jumping to his feet when Dean cracked the back of his head into the old car behind him in frustration, Bobby was quick to place a hand on the injury and held tight, preventing the other from doing it again. “Dean, for fuck’s sake—” Yelled Bobby, holding on to the struggling omega. Eventually, Dean ran out of steam and Bobby was successful in pulling him away from the scrap, pressing his face to his chest instead. He kept his hand on the back of Dean’s head, just above his nape and over the bruise. “Kid, listen to me.” He said carefully, but firmly, fingers buried in dirty blond hair. “Sam loved you.
Dean knocked softly at the door to Cas’s office, before poking his head inside. “Hey.” He greeted, smiling as the other looked at him over a (not) small pile of academic papers to grade. “You have a minute? I, uh. I wanted to talk to you.”
Glaring back, Dean bit the inside of his cheek and fought not to become defensive. It would help no one. “Well, I’m glad then, cos if it had been on purpose, you would have crossed
Staring, Castiel barely reacted when Bobby took Sam’s stool and they sat him on it. His eyes were fixed on the child.
Softening, Cas eyed the other with tenderness. “While I wish the circumstances were different,” He began, sparing a glance at the walls of the bunker room they were in. “I’m glad you get to experience this. You deserve good things, Dean.” Castiel smiled as the other’s scent, embarrassed but pleased, washed over him. “And regardless of any doubts you might still harbor, I
Taking the journal with him, Bobby did. As they rounded the corner, he stiffened, eyes landing on a lone figure standing on the sidewalk. “Dean—”
“Let’s make a deal, kiddo.” Dean breathed, shoes crunching on the gravel as he hauled his tired body towards the front door. “Next time you get all colicky, I’ll take you on another walk, but you gotta give me at least a
“And I am.” Dean was quick to reassure. “I mean, even with the hiding and the absolute madness my life has been these past months, it’s— It’s been good.
can go and grab groceries." Interjected the angel, leaving no room for debate. "I'll take the car and then fly back.
. Crowley smirked, as if he knew exactly that. “Why Hell?” Dean asked, turning to look at Billie. “I mean, don’t get me wrong. I’ve done some messed up shit, but I didn’t think I’d be coming back down here.”
Swallowing hard, the angel watched as Dean peppered teasing little kisses up his length, hands kneading their way up his thighs. He saw as his hands reached his groin, one moving to play with his balls and the other grabbing him firmly, lazily stroking him as Dean began to suck at his knot. Castiel let out a shaky exhale, meeting the other’s green eyes. “You were right. I do like to watch.” He had to admit, running a hand down Dean’s hair, and tugging lightly, as the omega grinned against his sensitive skin.
—" He kept muttering. There were fluids on Jack's tiny face, blocking his airways. He couldn't remove them. "
When he’d gotten up that morning, Castiel had already left for Normandale but had left him a fresh pot of coffee, still warm on the counter, as per usual. He had finally begun to assist in the classes he would soon be taking over, which left Dean to his own devices most of the day, still stuck at home in medical leave.
. A perfect mixture of the two of us. To raise them, to— grow old together.” Softening, Cas looked up, almost hesitant. “I’d like that. I’d like that, very much.”
“What?” The hunter barked, alarmed at both the sudden death and Castiel’s reaction. “What did you do to
.” Warned Cas, feeling the other tense in irritation and press up against his arm, gearing up for a fight. The angel was goading them, trying to get them to leave the wards. Dean knew, Cas was sure, but he was too hot blooded to not respond in some way.
Where Anna smelled of wildfires and dandelions, Cas smelled of rain and honey. However, and as divine creatures, they both had smelled deeply of ozone. It had nearly overwhelmed all the other scents. Now, though, Castiel smelled remarkably… ordinary.
Clapping his hands into a praying motion, Bobby shook them towards Dean. “I am not touching this subject with a ten-feet pole. You’re both grown ass men. Sure,” And Bobby softened a touch, but still looked mildly inconvenienced. “You’re my kids, ya idiot, but I can’t be answering these questions for you. You both need to talk and decide amongst
, let alone acting like parents to be. Every time Castiel looked at the omega, he imagined the nephil growing within him. A literal ticking time
Bumping into Dean’s back when the other screeched to a halt, Cas took the chance to hold on to the other’s shoulders and keep him nearby. “Stretching–
, too. Retired hunter, seen so much Shit™, family issues a mile long– and now he was going to have a kid of his own that he was
Bobby sighed, smelling the bitterness in Dean’s scent. It had changed, ever since he and Castiel had mated, but it was still uniquely him, the same Dean he knew. “Cas is just scared.” He explained. “Gave him a talk, too.”
Bobby waved it away. “Yeah, same thing, I mean— that’s leadership. You could take on supervisor jobs.”
“I guess? Probably more likely to happen when they feel something big is happening.” Gabriel pointed the blade towards the window. “Like you getting riled up by hostile angels on your doorstep.”
“I hate that you have to see me like this.” Dean whispered, wincing as he shifted and he pulled on Cas’s knot, still holding them together. “I hate that
“Hey, Sasquatch.” Dean replied, barking out a small, relieved laugh. Suddenly, he let out a small huff too, Sam’s gigantic arms wrapping around him tightly as he buried his face in his shoulder.
Cas seethed. “You’re an inhabitant of the third Heaven, Kushiel. What would you know of higher purpose?”
.” Breathed Dean, sweat beginning to collect at his temples as he rocked onto Castiel’s teasing hand. Moving his own hands up, he startled, a short moan leaving his lips as the other found the spot within him and his digits met something incredibly soft at the angel’s back. “Cas.” He panted, groping, and sliding his right hand up something thick and strong but so very warm. “Cas, I can

Larson just grinned, eyes twinkling. “People change, mate. Perhaps your winning personality got to me.” Ignoring the other’s scowl, the beta walked over and smacked Dean on the shoulder. “Lighten up—” And he paused, narrowing his eyes at the omega. Reaching, Larson laid a hand back on Dean’s shoulder and let it linger.
“Yeah.” Drawled Dean, sarcastic. “What’s trauma, anyway?” Looking away at the other’s warning glare, he glowered. “Can’t believe you let them do this.”
“It will kill you!” Castiel screamed right back. “That’s the price to pay for birthing a Nephil! The bearer always dies! Do you get it, yet?! I don’t want to lose you, not because of a mistake
. Then I shall bury it in your gut, scorch your wings onto the dirt and send you straight to the Empty, where you
He would be giving birth in a matter of one or two weeks. Dean didn’t need to see the others pretending not to be panicking to know
“You were holding my hand.” Explained Cas. “There was a direct line to me, to what we were doing. The child felt my grace waning and lent his power.” Gingerly, almost carefully, he patted Dean’s belly. “If I am still an angel, I owe it to him.”
, too, and if anything ever managed to trump weariness in Dean Winchester, it was pure, unaltered anger.
With a hidden smile, Castiel crouched and helped the other out of the garments before he began to wipe the fluids off his legs with the wet cloth. Dean’s scent, fond and content, washed over him as he worked. “Better?”
As it was, he was powerless and the man he had chosen to share his human life with might as well be dead, past the layer of metal unwilling to bend at his hands.
.” A huff. “Something floral and baked and mechanical— So many scents, all mixed up. It is unpleasant, to say the least.”
Trying to sooth him, Castiel rubbed his hands up and down his thighs. “If that’s what you’re concerned with, I was not offended.”
bare for Castiel’s hungry eyes to see. “You know,” Began Cas, touching and memorizing every dip in the other’s body, ever muscle that twitched when his fingers ghosted the spot. “I took great care when recreating you. Your heart.” Castiel pressed a kiss to skin over Dean’s left pectoral. “Your abdomen.” Teeth scrapped Dean’s stomach, right above his bellybutton. “Even…” And Cas kissed the skin right above Dean’s erection, making the other hold his breath in anticipation. “Your penis. How it leans slightly to the left, just the
Over Sam’s shaggy head, Dean looked down at Gabriel, still licking his wounds. He pursed his lips. “
There was enough light that Castiel saw Bobby soften at his words. “Yeah. Those boys, dumbasses as they are, they’re mine.” He said, thumping his chest over his heart. “Regardless of blood, relationship, whatever.

the first thing about caring for an infant. Yet, he did his very best, cupping the back of Jack’s soft head and lifting him onto his arms, cradling him against his vest. “No, no—” Bobby tutted when the baby whined, squirming in his grasp. He glanced at Castiel, still out cold in the next mattress. “Dad’s a little— busy. I’m sorry, kiddo.” And he really,
. And he tried not to be, too, but it was hard, especially when you couldn’t walk and the chair the hospital lent you was just slightly wider than the doorway to the corridor, which forced Cas to carry him around every time he needed to use the bathroom or go to the bedroom. Dean hated feeling useless and while Castiel did his best to not make him feel that way, there were only so many pee breaks Dean could take before he felt like ripping off the plaster off his limbs and crawl there himself.
Another angel, wings of a white so pure they matched the brightness of the room. Like everything else, they couldn't make out their features, just their silhouette. They looked around, seemingly confused. "Oh?" The voice was deep but gentle.
Staring, Dean was sure he was having a stroke. He rubbed his forehead with the back of his hand. "So.” He tried to summon the most important details out of the dump of information he had just received. “Lucifer is your father."
to bet everything.” He grew grim. “The only thing keeping us away from a genocidal maniac is a bunch of scribbles on the walls. We’re out of allies; no angel is talking, terrified of being next. One of these days, Daddy dearest will remember this place, get tired of waiting and
Sam simply smiled, reaching to squeeze Dean’s bicep. With his free hand, Dean squeezed the other’s wrist back. “Thanks.” He murmured, chest tight.

Turning quickly, Cas protected Dean with his own body against the door, watching Kushiel with wide eyes over his shoulder. He was—

, but you’re here now, okay? And it’s been like— four hours tops since it started but it’s already being the best heat I’ve gone through, alright?”
Gabriel was sprawled near the entrance, halfway out of the room. The door was off the hinges and had a human shaped indent, so the angel had to have been thrown. Quickly checking for a pulse, unsure if angels even had one, Bobby felt the knot in his chest uncurl a little when he found it.
a little under the bearded man’s scowl. “I meant no offense.” He was quick to state, going back to staring as Dean winced under Bobby's ministrations. “Just stating facts. As it stands, they’re all we have.” Standing and quickly crossing the room, Cas grabbed a bottle of whiskey from the minibar and handed it over to Dean. “Humans seem to use it as an analgesic, though I doubt its efficacy.” He deadpanned at the raised eyebrow he got in return.
Dean glared, not at all fazed as he stood there, in socks, Castiel’s shirt and his boxers. “Nothing else
to open up? How could you expect to know what I am feeling, Dean?” Even the name felt like a jab. They both vaguely heard Bobby’s warning to cool it. “I am
The moment Bobby laid eyes on him, there were fluffed pillows, wet cloths to the back of his neck, and constant reassurances, as if the man was suddenly an omega whisperer. Then, Sam found his footing and made it his
After what felt an eternity in the cold draft of a late Autumn day, Bobby saw Dean open his eyes. His heart leapt and he knew Dean could smell his worry, but kid was blinking back tears. Last time he’d seen that, Dean had just gone through his last growth spurt and presented, and John was drunkenly yelling at him for things he had no control over. “Dean?” He called, reaching to touch his forearm. His scent began to grow in intensity, thick with grief and anger.
? Is it because I wouldn’t say yes to Michael? Some cosmic revenge plot cos I wouldn’t play their games?”
All his pills were long gone, as his heat went way past the normal treatment given to Dean at the drug store, but the omega barely even needed them, too exhausted to stay awake long enough to feel the cramps. He was pale, bags under his eyes and constantly shaking, like he was fighting off a bad fever and not his own body trying to kill him.
Castiel was silent for a moment, observing his younger self’s body with guarded eyes. "Just because you have free will, doesn't mean you can do whatever you want with it." He eventually said, paraphrasing someone else. "But." He hesitated, now looking at Dean’s unconscious form. "It's your choice. It wouldn't be
“I can’t.” Dean finally said, blinking furiously. He cleared his throat, trying to get himself under control. “I can’t do it. Can’t
“Who knows?” Shrugging, Gabriel tapped the wall one last time before turning back to the others. “How did the saying go…?” He snapped his fingers, trying to remember. “Ah! God works in mysterious ways?” The archangel snickered at Dean’s furious glower. “Maybe he got pissed Mike got thrown into the pit while Cassie here gargled his sword.”
Castiel shrugged, completely unbothered by the other’s glower as he checked the photo on his phone. “You made me realize that we don’t have many of these, now do we?” He pondered. “It’s nice. To be able to physically preserve some memories for posterity.” For Jack. Dean only groaned in response, pulling the trench coat over his head as he tried to end the conversation. He felt Cas sit beside him and then the warm pressure of his hand on his back. “Are you alright?”
The vein in Dean’s throat started pulsing, room continuously filling with the smoky smell of a wildfire as fury threatened to choke him. “What do you mean, you were looking–
, Gabriel echoed into Castiel’s head, ignoring his surprised inhale. He probably hadn’t heard another angel’s voice in his head in so long. ‘
“Gotta look out for you kids, if no one else does.” Basking in the pleased silence Dean gave off, Bobby leaned forward on his knees. “You gotta try and see it from his perspective too, Dean. He’s old. Older than both of us combined, than dirt, even. He’s seen a lot of shit. I don’t doubt that Nephilim have the potential to be something scary, but I also know that Heaven deals in absolutes. They likely never bothered to actually nurture the lil’ shits, am I right?” Failing at dragging a smile out of the other, Bobby soldiered on. “What I mean is, you’re both at a crossroads. Now you get to decide if you want to repeat History or you want to try something new. I told Cas that. I also told him that your word would be final.” Dean looked at him, then. “You’re the one carrying the burden, Dean. Literally. Nothing happens without your consent. He understood that.”
Swallowing hard, Dean had to look away. He thought of him and Lisa, trying to make it work. He didn’t know her family, so he had no idea of how that would go: they could end up hating him, for all he knew. Just his designation alone would cause arguments, he was sure. If they ever thought of starting a family, it would open a massive can of worms. Male omegas often had a low sperm count so, if they ever wanted any biological kids of their own, they’d have to go through a lot of medical trouble to get them. Would they find a doctor even willing to help, given their designations? Would their relationship survive that kind of stress? What they had was barely built on crumbs, now.
As he brushed some strands of blond hair off the other’s forehead, Cas pressed a loving smooch to Dean’s brow. “We’ll be okay, now.”
“Charming.” Still, Cas was all gummy smiles and tender hands as he cupped Dean’s face and gave him a fleeting kiss. “I’ll be right back.”
Moving, Cas kissed Dean’s brow, trying to comfort him. “No, He can’t.” He agreed, apprehensive. “But it will be difficult. We can’t hide forever, Dean.”
Dean raised a placating hand. “Bobby told me he only asked you if you were okay with having me around. I know, it’s just— It was just a lot, too suddenly.” Shrugging a shoulder, Dean tried to explain. “Guess it felt like he was trying to get rid of me. Dunno, it was stupid, in hindsight.”
“Or maybe, the asshole is ghosting us.” Dean offered with a humorless smirk, raising his beer towards the bearded man in a mock salute. Seeing Castiel squint at him in confusion at his choice of words, he relented. “I mean that he’s probably ignoring us, Cas.”
“I’d rather call it protecting.” Retorted the angel, laying on his side and watching as the other got ready for bed. Pausing at the sight, he sat. “Dean.”
, hanging on to his every word and he asked questions unabashedly, eager to understand. Soon, he had the full grasp of their unique biology. “That’s
For an apple pie life? Not so much. Not impossible, sure, but would require a lot of hard work Dean isn’t sure he’s in the headspace to provide.
found her, and he decided to help her when he realized I wasn’t bad." The young nephil shrugged, unaware of the other's bewilderment. "Then I was born. Mom died, but is very happy in Heaven, I visit all the time!" He beamed. "Cas died too, Lucifer killed him, but I woke him up and he came back to me. You and Sam took care of me til he did."
Dean preened as usual when it came to his Baby. “Yup. I keep her up and running myself.” He boasted, patting the black roof with care. “Rebuilt her from scratch once, too.”
Cas frowned, stiffly sitting in one of the armchairs as he watched almost moodily as Bobby worked on Dean.
, but always trying so hard, weren’t you?” Sam tensed. “Well, it’s not enough. That nephil— He is a power vacuum. Guess what I’m in need of.”
Panting, little gasps escaping unprompted between thrusts, Dean leaned forward on his hands and tried another angle, letting out a sob as it threatened to overwhelm him. “Y—Yes!”
Nodding, Castiel went back to the armchair where he had been but didn’t sit. Instead, he flexed his hands, turning his back to the others. He was fidgety, trying to cope with the knowledge that he could no longer heal or do anything else divine on a whim. “I don't understand. Gabriel— It’s strange that he would resurrect me without my grace.” A dark look passed through his eyes, scent souring as he turned. “I find it very difficult that he would be able to do that, too.”
“No.” Rebuked Castiel. “Get rid of the body and get inside.” If Gabriel minded being bossed around, he didn’t show it, squatting beside the figure and vanishing with another flap of wings.
Being careful not to pull on their connection, Castiel laid them on their sides, wrapping his arms comfortingly around the other and murmuring sweet nothings into Dean’s hair. Eventually, the other stopped shaking and his breathing evened out, awareness returning slowly. “Cas?”
A car door slammed to his left, making Cas jump in his seat again. He breathed, recognizing that he was still in the parking lot of the supermarket. Dropping the bag, Castiel fumbled with his keys and turned them; the clock glowed a quarter past eight. It was snowing.
Staring at the yellow tiles unblinkingly, Dean contemplated murder. Cas, on the other hand, eyed the vial with renewed interest. “I could try and smite him.” He considered.
“Dean was a man of many flaws,” Said Sam, clenching his jaw. “But being caring was never one of them.”
“No.” Cas spoke then, lifting his head. Pained, he looked anywhere but Dean. “I was out of turn. I shouldn’t have lashed out, verbally or—”
With far more mobility than he thought he still had in him, Bobby was out of the car, gun in hand as his eyes struggled to adjust to the darkness.
, leaving Jack a sad, blubbering mess. “Right– Let’s try something else.” Purposedly, the omega reached behind the door, picking up the carrier sling. “I don’t have wheels yet,” He kept talking, in hopes it would help distract the toddler. “But walking’s gotta be nearly as good, right? A lil’ motion, some hummed soft rock–” Gently, Dean swaddled Jack in the sling and pressed a kiss to the fine blond hair on the crown of his head when the baby hiccupped in distress. “C’mon, kiddo. Let’s take a walk.”
Moaning around Castiel’s dick at the pleasurable pain, Dean felt his dick twitch against the bedsheets. Cas’s scent had gone back to being heavily overruled by ozone, but his true odor burst through as his length gradually hardened in his mouth, honey and arousal filling his nostrils. Feeling the other’s knot begin to inflate in his mouth, Dean pulled away, working his jaw as he gripped Cas’s dick in his hand and tightened his grasp around the base. “No coming yet.” He warned, hoarse, pressing a wet kiss to Castiel’s trembling navel.
“Dean.” Mumbled Castiel, wiggling beneath the other’s weight. At the other’s hum, he sighed, evading another kiss. “Dean, there’s something I think we need to talk about.”
Castiel grabbed him by the arm, stopping Dean’s retreat. “No.” Repeated the alpha, pining Dean down with a heavy stare. Sliding his hand down, he stopped at Dean’s wrist and
Like déjà vu, Dean kissed him, soft and unhurried against the kitchen counter. A familiar motion, now, enveloped in sweet honey and the scent of rain on a summer day. It was
Turning, Bobby hurried down the corridors towards the infirmary, inspecting every corner, every room for intruders. The bunker was empty.
. Humming deep in his throat, Dean began to pepper kisses down Cas’s jaw and his neck, hands sliding down the other’s backside. “Do I get presents, too?” He asked teasingly, slipping his hands inside Castiel’s jeans, and squeezing his backside.
? A quick examination of his surroundings showed him that they were alone. And his grace was still unreachable to him.
“Does it matter?” Grunted Dean, looking everywhere but at Gabriel. He decided to focus on Sam, quickly drawing sigils in blood down long strips of white ribbon. “Just do it.”
Opening it, Castiel peeked inside. He raised an eyebrow, eyes growing wide at the apparatus within. “Dean?”
.” Castiel reassured, with quiet intensity. “I have no doubt you were always meant for Heaven, Dean. Chuck was just— wicked.” Dean hummed, doubtful, but let it go, unwilling to argue. Recognizing it, Cas decided not to press. Instead, he laid back down and wrapped his arms around the other, tucking Dean’s head under his chin. “Now that we’ve established that you’re a good man, it is time for you to rest.”
Just as he was getting up and looking around for an exit he knew wouldn’t find, Dean felt a tug at his waist. “What?” Looking down, he frowned.
Ignoring Bobby’s snort of amusement, Dean huffed out a groan from where he laid belly down in his own mattress. His back and arms were killing him. “Yeah, yeah, you told us so.” He grunted, unamused. “I never expected to
Dean promised he wouldn’t make any deals or try anything to get him out of the cage, so he basically
“I’m not going to have an audience.” Dean warned, awkwardly patting the other’s back, hoping he’d let go soon.
“Cos, I didn’t think it was important.” Defended Dean. “When we first met, we had that argument, remember? About his jab at omegas in the hunting community. But that was it. No comment again, it was
“Yeah, I’m sure. You not getting sick is more important than shoving my tongue down your throat at midnight, sunshine.”
“Smartass.” Tapping the impala’s hood, Bobby addressed the other two. “Now, we gotta run by that garage; Larson will be waiting for us by now.”
By the time Dean walks out of the guest room in the morning, bleary eyed and hair sticking out in weird places, Cas has already thrown open the windows of the entire house, done the laundry in their room and was
Silently, they walked to Gabriel and helped him to his feet, fully intending on leaving Cas to grieve in peace.
“Ahh, geez, Cas.” Castiel shrugged, not understanding Dean’s consternation. “Yeah, once upon a time. She had a changeling problem a while back—”
“Was a massive thorn in my side.” Interrupted Chuck, incensed. “His brother was easy to deal with in here. All I had to do was leave him in the cage to rot.” Sam reddened with resentment. “But you two—” The entity wagged a finger. “You, Castiel, always did what you were told, but in that world, you just
“He’s a nephil, Dean. It was bound to happen, sooner or later.” Though the alpha had expected it to happen much,
Castiel nodded in understanding. “It’s way of carrying them with you, despite them not being physically present.”
Thankfully, Cas was soon running back into the room, placing the small box on the nightstand, and securing the pad around Dean’s abdomen and lower back with gentle hands. “Better?” He asked, tentative, watching Dean relish the warmth.
. I care about the waitress, who smiled when we walked in. The small family we walked past, the child who waved. I care about Bobby, who took me into his home. But Dean, I care about
Dean closed his eyes, feeling the ghost of dry lips behind his ear and bone deep weariness settle in.
“Then we go to him.” Castiel stated, before looking away and concentrating on a faraway spot on the wall. A beat passed, Bobby and Dean looking at each other before back at him. “… I forgot I can’t fly anymore.” He said finally, dismayed. He visibly reigned it in. “We’ll have to drive there.”
Exhaling loudly through his nose, Bobby leaned against a bookcase. “Which we’re basing on a whole lot of what ifs.” He argued, though without nearly as much steam as before. “Yeah, kid was outta the pit in wherever the hell this Chuck crawled out of, but that isn’t necessarily the key to winning this fight.”
, before rubbing his thumb against the gland in circular motions. The omega swallowed hard, beginning to smell his scent mingling with Cas’s. He was
. We just spent weeks of you caring for me cos I literally couldn’t walk, and you never complained. Miss me with all that self-deprecating, not nurturing crap. Even when you still had your wings, you cared more than most.” Grabbing Cas’s shoulders, he squeezed reassuringly. “Plus, you think I would know what I would be doing? Cas, parenthood is a whole lot of panicking and not knowing what to do.”
There was a moment of silence before Cas walked out from behind Dean, ignoring the omega’s protest. “What are you talking about?” He demanded, blue eyes furious. “My grace is
, whose first act would be to murder the one human who first believed in them? The human he, Castiel, former angel of the Lord, couldn’t bear to think he would likely have to live without?
was the celestial being. He had no idea what he had just said. Bobby sighed. “Ahh geez, kid.” He motioned for the other to keep eating. Castiel didn’t budge. Bobby cursed. “Some things you gotta figure out on your own, Cas. This is one of them. I can’t tell you what you’re feeling, nor do I want to.”
at this. Wouldn’t have bothered teaching ya all I knew if I didn’t think you were decent at it.” Letting the other go, he took a deep breath. “Nevertheless, I’m not
did what we had to do.” Jack soothed. Then he paused, thinking. “You said you don’t know if you’ll be there.” He realized. “Why?”
“About?” At Dean’s silence, Bobby forced down a wave of frustration. He had always known Dean had walls a mile high, but it never stopped exasperating him. It wasn’t his fault; he knew it was John’s and his outstanding lack of parenting skills. It was still hard to navigate, like juggling a live grenade. The omega either folded like a lawn chair under the care or fought back like an angry bear. Usually the later. “Dean,” Bobby started, deciding to test the waters. “How are you doin’, kid? Really?”
Feeling Cas press tighter against his back, Dean began to try and free his body from the hold. It was hard and he had to fight his own growing desire, but he owed it to Castiel to contest it. “Cas.” Called the omega, voice hoarse. “Cas, you gotta wake up, buddy.”
Picking at the chips on the other’s lap, Castiel looked around the counters and then up at Dean, finding him looking back. His lips quirked up in a small smile involuntarily. “Yes, perhaps.” He thought back to some of the books Bobby had forced on him before he left and that he most definitely did not read (he did). He sniffed again, nostrils filling with Dean’s sweet baked scent. There was something floral too, now. Cas crushed the small chip between his fingers. “Or perhaps you’re low on sodium?”
“Who ordered it?” Dean demanded, smelling both the sorrow and absolute fury in Castiel’s scent. He would march into Heaven and kick some feathery ass, if only it meant Cas would stop hurting.
The nephil shook his head. "No, it was Lucifer. He’s my angelic parent." Jack corrected. Dean gawked, brain screeching to a halt. Jack suddenly winced, straightening his back. "
Dean raised an eyebrow, patience growing so very fucking thin. He could feel the other’s hand like a brand. “You either let go of me,” He started, carefully composed. “Or you might as well fire me right now, because I will
Dean fought the instinct to roll his eyes once more. Classic Cas, there you were. “I meant, from hunting. I promised.” His heart squeezed again. “I promised Sam I’d get out. Try and have a normal life once he was gone.” Shrugging a shoulder, Dean tried to act nonchalant. “So, you don’t have to worry about me getting ganked by a ghost or worse, a vampire. I’ll be fine.”
As soon as Cas got back, they dug in and toasted with warm beer. “To surviving the night, may the ceiling not crash on our heads while we sleep.” Bobby joked, getting insulted by Dean, and watching as Castiel looked up, uneasy.
“Like I said, I ain’t got a problem with it.” Dec scoffed. “Don’t care what you are, so long as you do your job right and pull your weight around here.”
hard, to connect with Sam, but they were too similar, fighting all the time. And Dean had tried too, to be a son Dad would have been proud of, could have relied on, but that quickly turned into smoke when he presented. That day, he had walked into Bobby’s kitchen, heard his Dad take a sniff and then all hell broke loose, mugs and half-empty whiskey bottles flying at barely ten in the morning.
“No, it’s not.” Dean agreed, doing the same. “Still. Caught my attention.” He mumbled, looking around and seeing a door leading outside and to a path that he guessed took them to the backyard. Walking back to the living room, he saw a small set of stairs in the corner to the entrance’s right, leading to what he assumed was the attic he had seen outside.
what happened to Raziel! You won’t last a minute against the guy!” Gabriel protested, standing straighter.
As Gabe rolled his eyes, Castiel closed his. “We’ve been over this.” He stated, tired. “I don’t like it anymore than you do, Bobby—”
Looking up from where he was effortlessly levitating books into the newly fixed bookcase, Castiel hummed. “Yes.” Eyeing the other, sitting crisscross applesauce on the couch, he paused. “He was right.”
. No?” He gagged, under Jack’s puzzled gaze. “No, it’s— Your Dad’s Cas. He’s my mate.” He explained, unable to stop a grin when the other blinked and then
. Still, even I can admit it’s a good story.” He admitted. “The police, the board, the neighbors, even. Nobody will blink an eye at our absence if we did it to protect our pup—”
Closing the distance between them, Dean cradled the other’s face as he kissed him, exhaling softly through his nose as Cas wrapped his arms around him. “You— freaking
Watching in amusement, Dean got up in no rush. “Hey.” Catching the other’s attention, he held out a hand for his coat. “I’ll hang this. You,” He pointed towards the corridor. “Go take a shower. You’re wet from the snow. Last thing we want is for you to start the year with pneumonia.”
Hesitating, Dean slowly let go of the pad. “I guess.” He murmured, slightly confused. “So.” Dean took a moment to gather his thoughts. “Kid helped you and now you’re okay with this?” Cas winced, looking over the journal. Dean was quick to backpedal. “Not trying to call you out or anything, I swear. I just— wanted to understand. You’ve been
As it was, Larson only let up when Dean had rolled under his latest project, a beautiful Corvette Stingray, practically held together by staples. Now, Dean was mostly done with what he had intended to do down there, but took his sweet time coming out, savoring the quiet. Had it been anyone else, Dean would have already socked them in the mouth for crossing the line; as it was, this was his boss, so idling was the best he could do.
. “Sorry. I’m just—” He threw a hand up, glaring down at the tangle of metal in front of him. “This is a mess. It’s getting to me.”
. The faithless man, risking everything for the dedication he felt towards a tiny bundle of cells and grace.
.” Dean shrugged, looking for all intents and purposes innocent. Cas squinted in turn, glaring. “You set me up.”
“There’ll be no rough anything, today.” Eyeing the body spread out in front of him, Castiel felt a thrum of possessiveness deep in his chest. He had rebuilt
A sigh. “Yeah, I get it.” And that was that, water under the bridge. Dean clapped a hand down on Bobby’s shoulder. “Thanks. And uh—” He fidgeted, rubbing the back of his hand across his mouth. “I’m sorry.” And this time, Dean meant it.
in his ear before Gabriel was shouting nonsense and Castiel felt the tug of Jack’s grace on his own.
Wincing, he rolled to his stomach, away from Cas’s warm body. It was barely five in the morning, so he considered closing his eyes and try to go back to sleep, but a particularly strong twinge had him gritting his teeth and Dean quickly knew he wasn’t getting away that easily.
Cas laughed softly. “You did.” Reaching, he wrapped a hand around the back of the other’s head and pulled him into a soft kiss, melting at the familiarity of those lips. It had been so long. Why had it been so long? “You’re capable of unimaginable love, Dean.” Castiel murmured when they pulled back, foreheads resting together. “I’m sorry that it took me so long to match your faith in our child.”
Bobby raised his hands, placatingly. “No use going on a spiral, just yet.” He soothed. “We’ll wait for Cas to come back from work, then we’ll run it by him. No-one’s going to hurt the pup.”
Almost as if he read the other’s thoughts, Jack beamed. "I know! I chose Cas as my father in the womb, so I willingly assumed some of his features." He explained, tapping his cheeks.
Giving in to his instincts, Dean turned his back on the food and stretched onto Castiel’s side of the mattress, burying his face in the other’s pillow. The moment the angel’s scent filled his nostrils, something in him seemed to
. Instead, he swallowed down the angry pterodactyl rising in his chest and calmly told Castiel, again, that it was
Said angel frowned, confused, and rubbed the back of his head as he looked inside the closet. “Dean?” He called.
, Dean silently mused. “Maybe so.” The former angel conceded after a moment. “Although, nothing Gabriel has ever done has been without consequence. He would have to gain something from our resurrection, and I can’t think of what he would attain from raising an unremarkable human such as Bobby from the dead.”
, but it seemed too much. “but things have been hectic. You’re safe, though.” And Dean made sure to stress it. “You and Ben, they’re not going after you. We solved it. You’re safe.”
“And why is that a surprise?” Snorted Dean, going back to work. “I built Cas’s dumb little bird house, didn’t I? I think I can do a crib.” He mumbled, almost defensive. Sure, he wasn’t a professional, but he could make
"And we're not going to find it." Dean stated, not cruelly but realistically. "All the scriptures, all the journals we've dug up, they all only mention the Angel parent or the Nephil. No one ever cared about the bearer, and certainly not enough to find a solution to their life being the price."
“Yours is more interesting.” Chewing, the other man narrowed his eyes at Dean. “Trouble in paradise? Renovations giving you a headache?”
Dean hummed, eyeing the younger man with trepidation. Not where he expected the other to start. “And why’s that?”
“Sure, ya don’t.” Watching as Dean got to his feet, Larson studied him, hooded eyes mischievous. “So.” Dean braced himself for impact. “What are ya doing here, anyway?”
Then, Ben. He really liked Ben, but in the little time they had spent together, he had already broken some of Lisa’s private rules, by teaching him how to throw a punch towards his bullies. Dean had no doubt more of those would happen; he and Lisa came from completely different backgrounds. While he would make sure Ben would never have to shoot a gun, he would still make sure he knew how to defend himself.
Eyeing the sandpaper in the other’s hand and the worked pieces of wood scattered across the bench, Bobby frowned. “Is that gonna be a
“Yes.” Confirmed Castiel, leaning to press a kiss to the other’s forehead. “Dad and Papa. I very much like it.”
“Better get to sanitizing that slab of metal, Sam.” Offered Dean, waving the other away when he tried to help him up. His heart was in his throat. “I’ll get Cas to help.”
Immediately, Castiel materialized in the corridor, holding some baby clothing. “Dean? I was about to return— Why are you on the ground?”
On each side of the fireplace, there was a door. Curious, Dean walked to the one on the right and opened it, peering inside.
. Not– weird. Or bad. Just– Unexpected, in the sense that I never thought this would be something I’d ever get to experience, ya know?”
“Sap.” Grinned Dean, not so secretly pleased. “I just thought— I dunno. Sometimes you don’t really feel like you want to be here, since…”
"And look at how that turned out." Jack argued, hands twisting in his lap. "You stayed in Heaven and Dean died
“Yeah, well,” Dean swiped a hand over his eyes, mildly embarrassed. “Just no more surprises. Think I had my fill for today.”
It was large, open room, empty save for a few broken chairs. Light bled into it, through the threadbare curtains still on the rods. It looked like it had the potential to be an office, but he couldn’t be sure.
“Cas. Wait.” Turning, the other gave Dean a curious look. “Have you ever done this before?” Fumbled Dean. “I mean, I know what I said. I
Dean rolled his eyes and pushed the other away, downplaying it. “Sure, now go shower, buddy. You’re up to your ears in dirt.”
With a shove, Chuck sent both Sam and Castiel flying against the locked door. He would need both his hands free if he was going to tear the other apart personally. “You—” He sputtered, spitting out blood. Gripping the blade, he pulled it out of Dean’s hand and out of his throat through the front, uncaring of the extra damage he soon began to heal. Chuck turned, clearing his throat as the hole in his flesh closed. “You
“Showering.” Replied Cas. Short, curt. If he tugged harder on the other’s belt, it was a coincidence.
cared, no matter what mistakes he made. Dean swallowed hard. Slowly, he sat back down. “I don’t know what to say.” He said eventually.
Ignoring the way something in his chest cartwheeled at Cas’s sweet confession, Dean leaned to press a kiss to the other’s hair. “Well, thank you.” He said, looking down at his socked feet and trying to think of something equally romantic to say. “I, uh— I can whip out some sandwiches with them, if you wanna.” Wow, gold star, Winchester. A for effort.
Taking off his cap and smacking Dean in the arm with it, Bobby grinned, pleased. “Atta boy. C’mon then.”
Huffing out a laugh, Dean placed his hands on the other’s chest and pushed him back onto his back, startling as both their bedside lamps were knocked over to the ground by his wingspan. Cas looked sheepish as he squirted more lube onto his hand. “Should have taken this outside, maybe. Somewhere with more room.”
“Yeah well, it’s at the very least distracting.” Dean grouched back, taking the bottle, and unscrewing the cap. He paused, peering up at the other through his lashes. “—Thanks.”
?!” The omega sputtered, burying his fingers in his hair in bewilderment. “Dude– He’s months old! He can’t roll over,
Eventually, Bobby stopped glowering long enough to talk. “Earlier today,” He started, talking low. “You said you were worried about not being able to heal anymore. Right?”
to it. Castiel had nodded and put his hand back down but was as stiff as a board the rest of the night.
Sam shrugging, avoiding the other’s face. He smelled guilty, Dean noted. “I just want to help.” He said. “The spell— That’s as far as I can actually help you with any of this. I can’t—
.” And when Castiel looked so damn earnest, how could Dean say no? “I’ll watch over you.” He vowed. “
Castiel was torn. “Which is exactly why we should be looking for professional help.” He tried again. “Dean— You’re losing weight. You’re dehydrated. You have a fever.
Gabriel gave Dean’s legs a gentle nudge as Sam hurried away. “Can you place your legs in these?” He asked, patting the supports. Ignoring the other’s embarrassment, he waited until Dean was settled before disinfecting and lubing up his fingers. “Mind if I check?”
“But true.” Cas countered, serious. “Humans are fragile. They could break so easily and yet, every day, they defy their limits for—
.” Repeated the alpha. “You’ve been an amazing partner while I adjust to my new limitations and you should know so— hear me
The archangel nodded, picking himself off the floor with a grunt. “Yeah. Right before getting thrown like a frisbee.” He sulked, taking off his gloves. He’d need a new, clean set.
Right now, he was at a turning point: Dean was open to accepting happiness, be it with his former girlfriend or not.
Raising his hand, Castiel eyed it. He could see it, beyond the skin. His own grace, now free to spread across his vessel. He was an angel
“Hope so.” Dean murmured. “Sam— He would be good at it. Running a hub for hunters.” He paused. “Would make me feel better to know he wasn’t going into the field as much, too. Just hope he doesn’t see the bunker as a way for me to try and dictate what he’s doing, tho.”
Padding into the war room, bowl of stew in hand, Dean was met with three pairs of disbelieving eyes.
Dean eyed the other then, slightly unnerved at how quickly the other turned serious and almost dangerous. Still, he felt no fear. This was
Cas squinted. “Sandalphon.” He suggested. “After the protector of unborn children.” Dean stared. “What? It’s a good name. A
Older Jack didn’t reply, frowning further. Whatever was after them was getting closer, if the oppressive power threatening to choke Dean and aggravating the baby nephil was any indication. “Chuck is not who you think he is.” He eventually replied, slowly, deliberate. “Have you met The Darkness?” Dean shook his head. “Where are you right now? What state?”
Giving the other a jerky nod, Dean went back to surveying the parking lot. His back was killing him, his feet likewise, but it was as if he didn’t feel it at all, far too keyed up to care yet. He thought they had faced everything. Demons, angels, knights, fucking
“I’m not made of beef or cake.” Castiel frowned. “Your bed talk is— bizarre. This was effective for others?”
Dean chose to ignore the remark and struggled to his feet, mind still reeling. He gave the air another pointed sniff. No doubt about it, the scent was one-hundred percent
Just a small lean forward and their lips were pressed together in a firm, yet gradually softening kiss, as they leaned into each other’s bodies. Soon after, or hours later, they pulled apart, lips sticking together as they looked at each other.
. “Can’t wait for all the gross old people sex we’re gonna have.” He murmured against Cas’s lips when he pulled back, grinning. “It’s gonna be
.” He praised, humbled before the violence of what his mate was going through. “You can do it, Dean. Just once more.”
." The omega shut up, breathing rapidly. With care, Castiel helped him up, steadying him on his feet. His skin was cold, clammy, beneath his touch. "We're alright. We're safe, all of us." He waited until Dean gave him a nod of acknowledgment. “Are you alright? You—” And it was Castiel’s turn to be at a loss for words, fighting back tears as cradled the other’s face in his hands. “You were
"What about us?" Asked Dean, patting little Jack's back. There was a small burp. No puke. Small victories.
. Tho injured, Dean twisted and bared his teeth in a broken snarl, scrambling for his gun before he was hit by an achingly familiar scent: motor oil, pine and whiskey, sour with worry and apprehension.
They stayed like that for a bit, Dean’s heart in his ears and his hands in Cas’s, unsure of how to proceed. Soon, Dean’s phone answered for them, ringing from the glove compartment.
Dean softened under Bobby’s arms before he pulled back with a sharp sniff. “I know you do.” He said, slipping his bravado back on. Rubbing his face, Dean was suddenly exhausted as the anger left him. “It was just outta nowhere, Bobby.” Explained Dean. “Should have given me a heads-up, first.”
Unsurprised, Dean sighed though his nose. “And you think Sam can help? Cas,” He scoffed. “All we’ve ever been were pawns in Heaven’s little plan. What could he have to offer you?”
“And then what?” Dean shot back, scent spiking and souring, cinnamon being replaced with the sharp tang of citrus and pushing back against Castiel’s own darkening mood. “What good will it do?! Sam—” And the omega deflated, grief washing over him even as he fought to push it down and
Struggling against the hold on him, Castiel fought to regain the other’s attention. Gabriel needed to be free to flee with Jack. “You brought Dean back just so he could die the way you wanted him to, then?” He demanded, teeth bared. Chuck focused his attention back on him, loosening his hold on his brother. “So, Jack would be born?”
: his throat was tight, he couldn’t stop moving, he’d taken to biting his nails— Cas bristled at his weakness.
"It's fine." Dean grinned back. He poked his Cas again, who glared. Dean just wiggled his eyebrows back. "
“Your father didn’t, then?” As soon as he said it, Castiel knew he’d pried too far. A wave of Dean’s scent, bitter and sour with anger, hit him like a blast of hot air. “I’m sorry,” He said quickly, also standing. “I didn’t mean— I didn’t mean it.”
“But why?” Dean was beginning to grow angry, tired of the divine and their bullshit. “Who the hell is the guy,
Swallowing a sigh, Sam cautiously slid a pillow beneath his head, propping him up. With care, Bobby then lowered Jack onto Dean’s chest and nestled the baby’s head against the blond’s neck, letting him scent bond with his parent. “Is that wise?” Sam objected but it was weak, watching as the infant finally settled.
“Happy tears.” Explained Jack, sniffling. Hesitating, he eyed Dean before he scooted closer, settling snugly against his side. He smiled shakily as the other wrapped his arm around his shoulders, rubbing his arm comfortingly. “It’s just
He could also go out and search, but Cas had no idea where Dean could have gone and what if he returned and Cas wasn’t there? Worse, what if Dean had drove away and tried to disappear? Cas wouldn’t
Still staring, Sam barely noticed the other leaving. The child hiccupped, inconsolable but too tired to keep crying. The alpha's heart squeezed, before he looked around. He knew he'd seen— Locating the little blanket, Sam quickly grabbed it.
Immediately, Cas knew had made a mistake. Dean’s easy smile fell, and his walls came up, tensing his shoulders. Before he could apologize, the other had already walked past him towards the winter jackets, without a word. Castiel swallowed a sigh and walked after him, doing it slowly as to give him time to work through his anger. “We should discuss boundaries.” Said Castiel when he reached the younger man. Dean looked over his shoulder, brow furrowed. “I keep saying the wrong thing and upsetting you. I’d like to avoid that.”
Cas nodded his agreement before pausing. “What do we do about our living arrangements?” He hadn’t forgotten Dean’s arguments, which were valid.
; scent thick with his usual traces of honey and ozone but overpowered by something that could only be described as
Unable to stop a lopsided smile, Dean turned his hand a little and hooked their pinkies together. “I like it too.”
“What is this?” Castiel wondered, stepping inside the room, and closing the door behind him. He eyed the pile, unsure if he should even touch. Then, he realized, and his heart flipped and then
Dean considered it long enough that Cas began to rise. “It’s fine.” He said at last. Walking to the bed, left hand gripping his towel tightly around his waist, he offered what he had been holding in the right.
Just as he made the decision, Kushiel choked on his own breath and stumbled back, a confused spark in his eyes. “
“If you think I’m leaving you here to do something stupid, you need to think again.” Protested Dean. He studied their surroundings. The wards were holding, and this was just one angel, so it was likely they wouldn’t break. Still, they couldn’t just leave him there, for however long he pleased, to mess with the barrier and potentially break through. “Gabriel.” Dean prayed under his breath, so only he and Cas could hear. “There’s a feathered asshole at our doorstep, who could really use some smiting, if you get what I mean. So, it would be great if you could show up, after ghosting us all this time. Just saying.” He paused. “Amen. I guess?”
Reigning in his emotions, Dean looked around. Where— Seeing Gabriel on the floor, his heart cartwheeled. "
Dean felt Cas stand beside him, close enough for their shoulders to brush. Tentative fingers touched the back of his hand. “Dean?” The word was soft in the silence of the house. Outside, wind kept blowing, leaves rustling, water running.
“I know.” Ever the cheeky little bastard, Dean saluted the angel, who simply sneered. “They’re always around, never more than two.”
Kid's a Winchester and the son of the most rebellious angel in Heaven's history; what did these fools expect?!
Knowing family and friends were safe, with Castiel by his side and Jack drooling on his shirt, Dean believed it. He laughed. “To the rest of our lives.”
"You're my kid." Dean explained, frowning, still trying to understand. "But I'm not your parent in your world.” Then he sighed, closing his eyes. “Guess I should have guessed something was weird when all you've ever called was by my first name, but." A shrug.
"Hello!" Jack parroted as the other Castiel simply nodded in acknowledgment with a small smile. Reaching, the older nephil promptly squished his baby counterpart's little cheeks between his large, clumsy hands. "Cas,
Dean suppressed a snort, not wanting to call more attention to himself. He was doing enough of that just by sitting alone in front of the building, on top of a muscle car. Like a creep.
So, Dean tried to take Sam’s earnest face out of his mind and tried to imagine himself in an actual relationship with Lisa.
If anything, his words only worsened Cas’s remorse. “I’m sorry. Perhaps Gabriel should have come up with another narrative. I know you don’t like…” He trailed off.
, people develop connections to it. Like this jacket.” Dean ran his hands down the worn leather. “… Dad wore it all the time. Mom gave it to him.”
was quick to let out a groan at the sight of the other mechanic. “Slap my tits and call me Sally, not
place. It’s only a matter of time until he figures out how to break the wards and saunters in, smiting left and right.”
"Dude, so you've said plenty of times now." Dean griped much later, bending over the impala's hood as he tinkered. "And every time, I've told you: it's fine, as long as you don't freaking do it again. Or a shiner will be the least of your problems."
"I don't detect any life forms, so it should be fine, Bobby." Stated Cas, helping Dean down the last step. He immediately led him to a chair and had him sit down, ignoring the scathing glare he received in turn. "Are there rooms?"
, or you’ll rip like a wet paper towel. Plus, you’ll maybe kill your kid.” Faltering under Castiel’s downright murderous glare, he backtracked. “You can do it, okay? You’ve been a champ, so far.”
Pausing, Castiel gazed at the nephilim, slowly becoming softer. Cas scrutinized it all, marveling at the show of emotions passing through what would be his face one day. This one version of himself was filled with love and longing, none of the cold porcelain all angels seemed to be made of remaining. Cas thought back to Chuck’s words, about how Castiel had loved his Dean so profoundly it trumped destiny itself. He wondered if he could live up to that standard, but then Castiel was sighing, head titling in acknowledgement. “I guess you’re right.” He admitted.
, Cas, and he was an adult. I might never get to see him reach that age." Confessed Dean, staring at his knees. "And now I can't even remember what his face looked like."
." As the older Castiel looked around, alarmed, Jack shook his head. "It was just a manifestation of his spirit. I assimilated him."
“Was just thinking.” Dean grumbled, wiping the smear of oil that’d been left behind in his forehead.
Flipping the hammer in his hand, Dean shrugged again. “Won’t know til we rip it off.” Still, he looked between the two bedrooms and the bathroom. As much as he liked to joke around, the decision was obvious. “Okay, fine. You do the carpet. I’ll deal with the tile. Can’t have you smashing the plumbing, anyway.”
.” And he took a step back, trying to give the other some space. They should have talked about intimacy before, actually; what if Cas wasn’t even interested in sex outside of his ruts? That was a possibility and Dean didn’t even consider—
Still staring, Dean felt a wave of affection for the other. The only other person who had ever helped him get through a heat had been Bobby and it was just with a care package on his very first one, consisting of heat pads, painkillers and, to his younger self’s amusement, heaps of chocolate. Sam ate most of it. “Wow, that’s— Thank you, Cas.”
. Do you understand?" Both Cas and Dean nodded, a tad alarmed. "This grace— I created it. In your image, or as close to what it used to be before. It's
At the tomatoes. At the chicken coop Castiel had pleaded and kissed his way into getting. The small wooden swing he was slowly building for Jack. The barn, finally remodeled into a garage, where Cas's dumb truck was parked, a to-go bag filled with diapers and a baby chair in the backseat—
, this is—” Drumming his fingers against the wheel, Dean forced down the urge to turn on the radio and drown the thoughts screaming in his head. Instead, he gripped the worn leather and took a deep, calming breath. “Listen—” And Cas did, but not before he gave him his patented squinty glare. Maybe Dean wasn’t the only one feeling defensive. “Here’s the thing,” And Dean laid the cards on the table, exposing his soul. “I’ve flirted with you. Hell, I wasn’t even very subtle. And every time, you brushed it aside.”
Nodding tightly, Sam was quick to straighten one of the mattresses. “I’ll take him.” He offered, knowing Bobby probably wouldn’t be able to take on Castiel’s bulk. “You’ll need to hold Dean.”
As for Castiel, he grew busier and busier as the weeks passed, constantly locked in his little, sunny office. He worked on his classes, graded assignments and his tutor had been so impressed with the extent of his knowledge that he had already taken over a class or two, to test his teaching skill.
He wanted to mow the lawn, worry about bills, rake leaves, have stupid arguments about stupid things like dirty clothes out of the hamper— Hell, he craved a
"We've welcomed Jack into our lives." Cas pointed out, watching Dean slowly lose the scowl. "You've come back to me. And now, we get to go home. Be
Maybe Dean would decide to be his and Cas would, in turn, be Dean’s but, for the moment, Castiel contented himself with what he had, still buried inside the other and bodies pressed together, warm, and happy.
Just as Dean’s about to go down the same spiral of wishing Gabriel bodily harm, Sam cleared his throat, catching the other’s attention. He looked alert, likely having been awake for a while, now. “I keep trying to figure it out.” He began, brow furrowed in thought. “If you broke or kept your promise to me.”
Flabbergasted, he looked around, searching for the sound. When he did find it, his newly human heart stuttered to a stop.

“No.” Gabriel barked back, sleeves pulled back. “Do you feel the need to push?” Dean nodded, not trusting his voice. “Okay, so when the next one comes, you’ll push with all you’ve got, okay?” The other nodded again, almost frantic. “I mean it, give it
Dean rolled his eyes, working his jaw. “No.” If words were bullets, Larson would have a gunshot wound, already.
Growling in frustration, Dean pulled away. Turning, he kneeled on the bed and dropped to his elbows, exposing himself to the other as he spread his legs. “Just— Just knot me, Cas. Please, just
Castiel looked alarmed now. “Why would I want needles anywhere near two very sensitive bundle of nerves on my chest? Why would I want them
Also let me know if you'd rather have me drop a bigger warning or something else if you ever want to skip these scenes, so that I can plan accordingly!
Castiel had felt the first snowflakes fall, the silky texture of the very first blades of grass, untouched by the greed of men— and
.” With the second ribbon, Sam wrapped it around Dean’s ring finger and thumb, looping it around Cas’s hand and then tying it at the omega’s wrist. “
Abruptly, there was a flap of wings and the two of them turned, startled. Gabriel stood over Kushiel’s body; eyebrow raised. He then looked at Castiel, skeptical. “You broke the seal?”
There was a mid-sized body of water in the near distance, with a small dock down a pebbled path. There was even a small wooden gate at the fence, connecting with it.
.” Cas immediately said, to everyone in the room. Dean shared the sentiment. “We’re not using our child against God.”
“Free.” Said Castiel, honest. “Don’t get me wrong. Living as a human was— enlightening. Enriching, even, but— I missed
“Yeah, I don’t believe it either.” Bobby snorted humorlessly, backing away, and scratching his head beneath his old ball cap. Looking around, he glanced between the horsemen’s rings and the undisturbed ground where the entrance to the cage had just been. “One moment I’m standin’ there with that angel of yours, the next I’m pulling my ass off the ground and seeing
Sam eyed the other, gaze soft. "And I would never ask you to. Not after I demanded you to get out of the life in the first place."
did this. We both created this being. We didn’t know we were doing it, of course, but it’s no-one’s fault. It was a trap. Now, we get to choose— work with it and piss on your old man when we find a solution and live happily ever after at his expense or we throw down the towel now and bow to his plans. I say we go with the first one.”
you posed as Dean's employer, in the first place." Squinting, Castiel turned to fully face the other. "Why get involved at all? What's your endgame, Gabriel?"
Staring at the other, beer in hand, Dean looked sheepish, mentally reviewing every time he had ran a modification through Cas. The pb&j. The homemade burgers Cas loved (and so did he). Even the honey and oats cookies Dean absolutely hated but made sure to buy every time for the other to snack on. “Well.
Dean pursed his lips, feeling his chest contract as Castiel squeezed his hand, looking so damn earnest. He hadn’t expected that. That Cas might be feeling unsure about his place in the world,
“M’gonna need a hand here.” Wincing, Dean looked up at the other through his lashes. “My water broke.”
Continuing dinner, Dean allowed the other to lean on him in the meantime. He should be putting some distance between them, he knew, but after he’d arrived home and taken a shower, he’d applied some scent blockers, so they should be good for the most part. He didn’t enjoy it, feeling like he was wearing a thick layer of invisible sunblock all over, but it was a necessity. “You should go shower, Cas.” Dean said when the food was finished, and he turned off the stove.
Standing before the third, Bobby huffed beside Cas’s wagon. “Realtor’s late.” He grunted, shoving his phone in his pocket, and pushing away from the car to meet the others by the sidewalk.
Slapping his hands down on Dean’s chest, Castiel grabbed two fistfuls of the other’s flannel and slammed him hard against the fridge. Trinkets were falling and Bobby was yelling and pulling at him, but he held firm, snarling in Dean’s face. “Finding that Prophet was my last hope at getting back my grace and now, that too, is gone!”
Looking up, Castiel met Dean’s panicked eyes. He smiled, tranquil, even as the flames began to lick the other’s skin.
Blowing a raspberry, Gabriel rolled his shoulders. “No need to worry about that until I either succeed or die trying.” With a salute, he grinned, sharp and dangerous. “Wish me luck.”
, Dean.” He carefully enunciated, slowly growing angrier, as if Dean was being obtuse on purpose. “A powerful being that cannot be allowed—”
look. “But we can’t coddle him. C’mon, it’s not like we’re throwing him out tomorrow, I’m not an animal. We need to drive there anyway, find the guy somewhere to stay and introduce him to the place, alright?”
“Well, for one, I’m tired of being cooped up inside.” Snarked Dean, taking a step forward and snaking his arms around the other’s waist, pulling him to his chest. Cas came easily but frowned, feeling the cold of Dean’s body seep into his through their clothing. “And second, I wanted to give Baby a look. I didn’t touch.” He said quickly, feeling Cas gear himself up to nag him. “Just— A good
." He scoffed. He had known, of course. The things Sam — not Dean — would tell him about their time in the road were more than enough to raise red flags, but what could he do? Dean would sooner bite his tongue off than do anything that could jeopardize taking care of his kid brother, so Bobby resorted to simply watching in silence, cursing John Winchester’s existence and doing what he could when the kids were with him. "Either way," He pulled a wallet off his vest's pocket. "I'll take care of it."
“We still have time.” Soothed Cas, eyeing the small house in front of them with distrust. The wind whistled somewhere through it, making a racket. “We saved some time on the first one.”
“Don’t.” The angel pressed his lips together, obeying. “We’re going through a rough patch, okay? And that’s fine.” Dean huffed out a humorless laugh. “Story of our lives, right?” He traced the other’s stubble with his thumb, lingering on a small scar on the curve of his jaw. No way of knowing if it was Jimmy’s or Cas’s. “I don’t deserve

to me, but I didn’t take it.” Pausing, Dean rubbed a hand down his face again, pressing down on the bruises. Hoping the pain would ground him. “Then, I almost said yes to Michael.” He confessed, swallowing as Bobby’s scent spiked with protectiveness. “Things weren’t working out and I didn’t think we could stop Lucifer anymore, so I went to her place to say goodbye. Her door was still open, and then Sam made me promise.” Dean finished, tapping the phone on his knee. “Now, all I gotta do is call her.”
Unfortunately, Jack did behave, as Gabriel was left unscathed afterwards. “You’re good.” He announced, to everyone’s relief. “Once your contractions are closer together, we can proceed.”
“Then why are we even talking about this?” Countered Gabriel, glaring at his brother. “If kid can’t do it, then it doesn’t matter, now does it?”
Hiding beneath a Corvette, Dean scowled in silence at the chassis before him. Wrench in hand, he tinkered absently, eyes fixed on a set of feet shuffling to his left, instead.
.” Stressed Dean. “Looking back, I can’t tell you how many mistakes I made. How surprised I am I didn’t off that kid, somehow. Yeah, it worked out, but— I would be as lost as you if we had kids of our own. Hell—” And Dean is shrugging, looking away. “I would probably be panicking. I don’t—” A deep, fortifying breath. “I don’t want to be my Dad.” He confessed. “I don’t want to yell and leave them alone when things get tough or neglect them… And I am terrified that’s what I’ll do cos I never knew anything else.”
. The house doesn’t need much anyway, the kitchen and the bathroom are the only ones that need an overhaul. I’ll be fine.” He soothed.
So many men and women and others in the entire planet and Cas looks at him, doesn’t even look anywhere else, and decides
Bobby pointed. "Down the hall. Bunch of them, too." Looking around and then at the map table, he scratched at his beard. "This looks like it was once a hub, but for what I dunno. I thought it would be something small, when ya said it was a bunker."
Cas nodded, then. “Who goes first?” Watching as Dean exposed his neck in a clear invitation, he licked his lips and cradled the other’s face with his left hand, pulling on the collar of his shirt with the right. Pressing a kiss to Dean’s gland, Cas savored the way the skin beneath his lips reacted before he bit down on it, thumb caressing the skin of Dean’s cheek as the other hissed in pain.
“Should be over soon.” Cas reassured, peppering small kisses down the other’s temple and then to his shoulder. As the pain faded, so did the fractures, vanishing off their skin. He noticed, though, how they left reddened stripes on Dean’s skin, unlike the previous ones. It had to burn more than a little; the human body couldn’t hold that much grace without suffering consequences. “You shouldn’t have to go through this.” Cas lamented.
Blowing a breath, Dean stared at a small rip on his jeans. He had to admit he wasn’t looking forward to having to say goodbye to Cas. Guy had been a constant in their lives ever since he marched into that barn, years ago.
Castiel rolled his eyes, watching the other fondly as he snickered at his dumb little joke. “You are very lightheaded.” He mused. Shifting with a grunt, he pressed a kiss to Dean’s cheek before he reached over his body for a box of tissues on the blond’s nightstand. Afterwards, Castiel made sure to clean them both, knowing he could have just waved it away but wanting to do it personally, with his own hands.
And as Dean looked at the gooey eggs in the pan before him, listened to the sounds of Cas pouring soup into bowls, he came to the realization that he truly, with all his being, did not give a single
Before he could stew anymore, lights flooded the living room as Castiel turned into their driveway and Dean heard tires on snowy gravel. He relaxed. No crash, then. Just plain old
A special thanks to all the reviewers, you know who you are!! <3 Every time I posted a new chapter, it always made me smile to see what you guys all thought!
Dean suppressed an amused smile at Cas’s sheepish look. “I wanted to prepare you dinner but” The former angel shrugged, embarrassed. “There’s not much I can safely make.”
If he had to grow, pop out and raise the pup (should he survive, but that was a concern for another day) by himself after deciding to keep it, then for fuck's sake– he
Reaching, Castiel tried to sooth the other, but Dean was already marching away towards the backyard, searching. “He’s– flying.” He explained in a way he hoped Dean would understand. How do you explain to your agitated mate that their supernatural child was flexing his grace? “Stretching and testing his wings.”
Slamming the impala’s hood shut, Dean turned and sat on it, blowing a sigh though his nose. He patted the spot next to him, waiting until Castiel gingerly settled on it. “You realize you just made a point most people would give you shit about, right?” Asked Dean. Cas frowned. “Not that you’re wrong— screw the idea that omegas are at the bottom of the food chain, but other alphas— fuck, other
Amused, the alpha eyed the other as Dean jabbed a warning finger at him. “Very well. I’m guessing I’ll be Father, then?”
Fiddling with a chewed pencil and a small journal, he was sketching what would become a guest room in the attic, sitting against the front door, when he felt a
"Son of a bitch." He muttered, eyeing his prone body. His burns were still sizzling, and his arms were dangling off the bed as he laid there, legs spread, his upper body the only thing keeping Cas on the mattress.
While sympathetic, Castiel didn’t try and soften his blow. “Dean, Sam is locked up in the Cage. Unless someone very powerful decides to pull him out, he’s there for eternity. He might as well be.” And if looks could kill, Cas would be a very thinly grounded, crispy pile of ashes under Dean’s furious glare. Still, he pressed on. “I understand you might not want to hear it—”
"Not completely, mind you, but—" Concentrating, Gabriel tried to move a nearby roll of gauze. It remained still. "
With Bobby’s help and with his truck, they quickly rid the kitchen of the ruined furniture and covered up the broken windows with plastic bags, preventing the chilly autumn wind from getting inside until they could be fixed. Next, were the broken chairs in what was going to be the office and then—
.” Cas shut up. “What the hell is going on?” Dean demanded to know, trying to look over the other’s shoulder. Castiel moved, blocking his line of sight, which only served to make Dean angrier. “The
Not for the first time, Bobby is reminded of how lost Castiel truly is in their dumb, little world. Kid was looking at him like he had the answers to world hunger, when
Gabriel snorted. “What, you think this is a prank? Nope, buddy. Not exactly a fan of baby slip jokes, anyway. Too overdone.”
.” Crying, Dean finally nodded, giving up. Leaning forward, Castiel was careful to avoid the tube in the other’s chest and his brace as he rested his free arm comfortingly around Dean, nosing at his temple and kissing his tears away as the other wept in the dark. “Rest.” Whispered Cas when Dean finally calmed down enough, the sun beginning to peek through the blinds. “I’ll watch over you.”
Pushing himself to a sitting position, Dean looked around. He was on the floor, in the middle of a grassy plain. At a soft coo, he turned around and saw little Jack on the soft green blades, sucking on his toes. “What are ya doing there?” Pulling at the pudgy little leg, he grinned as the baby went right back to gnawing at the digits with a gurgle.
Eventually, the tremble in Castiel’s arms became too much and he collapsed as carefully as he could on top of Dean, effectively squishing the other’s arm between them. “I am sorry.” He mumbled, feeling Dean wiggle his arm free with a groan.
Trying to wrap his head around the info, Dean still had a jab to deliver. “I guess that’s valid, I mean, not like you’ve been touching me much these days for it to be a concern, right?” An exaggerated shrug. “Why should I be worried about scarring our unborn child by going down on you when it’s not happening?” If Cas could get any redder, he’d burst into flame.
“I’m trying.” Murmured Dean back, sighing as at least the pain at the base of his spine faded. “I can’t.” Pausing for a moment, he stared at where he supposed Cas’s chest was. “I keep seeing that angel— the vessel was a
“I vaguely remember having bought you underwear.” Dean stated, eyes fixed on Castiel’s fully naked form. He was secretly awed. Under the layers and that dumb,
"Doesn't explain why you stayed." Countered Cas. "Why you're doing this, all of it, for Dean and I."
The omega looked uncomfortable, then. "I have practice with the five-finger discount." He admitted, refusing to look at Bobby. "It won't be able to get much but—"
Nobody wanted to get stuck to a quick lay for a while, vulnerable and at their mercy, and most certainly not Dean. He found a partner, had his fun, and then they got each other off, as far away from knotting as possible. He just didn’t
At that, Dean sighed, humor gone. “Well,” He drawled. “My employer is gone, so. I’m unemployed, I guess?” He shrugged, titling his head to press his lips to Jack’s soft little cheek. “Might take some time off until Jack is old enough for pre-school, if you’re okay with it. Single paycheck and all.”
For a moment, Dean was torn between fondness for his father figure and his gruff displays of affection, and utter
Lightheaded, Dean allowed the other to manhandle him. As his eyes landed on Cas's neck, something cleared in him and he made a strangled sound, hands coming up to cradle the back of Castiel's head. Dean dragged his fingers up and down the ridges of the other's spine, checking for fractures. There were none. Gripping Castiel's face then, Dean gave him a jostle, choked up. "Don't you

trench coat, Cas looked— lithe. A twig of a man, sometimes, depending on posture. But naked? “Damn, Cas.” Dean whispered, sitting up and reaching reverently, pressing a hand to the other’s stomach when Cas climbed into the bed with him. “Where have you been hiding all of this?” Cas was—
Dean squeezed the other’s shoulders beneath his hands, both to comfort him and to ground himself. “Not at midnight, no. I propose something else.” Swallowing hard, he took a moment to glance at his wrist. Five to midnight. “Cas— I love you.” Dean started, sliding his hands to the other’s face, and smiling when Castiel kissed the palm of his right hand. “We’ve come really far since September. I mean, we got into this just hoping it would work out and now— I can’t imagine doing this without you.” He confessed. “Since the accident, I’ve been thinking— There’s no-one else I’d want by my side, so I’ve been looking for the right time.” Dean licked his lips, watching Cas devote his entire attention to him. “I want you to be my mate.”
Gabriel poked into Dean’s entrance, checking carefully. His fingers hit something solid. “I can feel the kid. He’s close.”
Snorting suddenly, Gabriel sat back down. “We’re dead.” He stated with false amusement, throwing his feet onto the table.
Swallowing hard, Dean rolled his hips experimentally as he rose, letting Cas partially slip out of him before moving back down, sighing as the other slid right back in. Soon, Castiel found his legs and began to meet each thrust downward with movement of his own, dragging a ragged moan out of the blond as they found an easy rhythm.
Humming deep in his throat, Cas turned them around and gave Dean a small nudge, motioning for him to lay down. “Yes. The offspring between a human and an Angel.” At Dean’s suggestive eyebrow, Castiel huffed. “I’m not going to actually push you onto the bed, Dean. People who suffered a pneumothorax are at high risk of developing another one in the next six months after the first—”
“He’s grounded, that’s what he is.” Dean grouched, burying his nose in fine blond hair. Jack smelled overwhelmingly of dirt and freshly cut grass, which he most definitely did
“I know.” Never had the cramps been so strong or the need so urgent. Even his first heat, supposedly the roughest to get through, had been easy compared to what Dean was experiencing this time around. Still, he refused to be taken to a hospital, convinced it was just a consequence of his misuse of suppressants and secretly petrified to think of an alternative. “I’m tired, Cas. So, so
Still, Cas forced himself to take a deep breath and settle his running thoughts. There was still time. Dean was okay. They could still find a way to save him. If not...
Running the calendar through his head, Cas rubbed his chin in thought. “Semester break starts next week. I have all my classes prepared and can pass them off to the head of department for review, if you’d like to work through it then.” He offered.
Sam moved to stand in front of Gabriel and his nephew, arms spread. “No one in this corridor will let you lay your hands on Jack.”
Jack and the alternate Castiel left soon after lunch, returning to their universe for a moment before they set out to scout whatever other worlds Chuck might have spared and booby trapped. Castiel whispered to Cas just as Dean squeezed the nephil, feeling the loss despite knowing it was unavoidable.
“Sure, Bobby.” Reassured Dean, patting the other on the back after a gentler squeeze. Letting go, he went back to leaning against the doorframe. Cas pressed their shoulders together. “Text me when you get home.”
“Should check just how much.” Dean urged, squirming. Cas was naked and he still had his underwear on, not to mention he was beginning to feel the frustration of the extended foreplay session. “
“Not that we even know how.” Gabriel muttered under his breath. He felt the weight of both Cas’s and Dean’s glares on him. “So, what? We lay low, bid our time? Cos—” And he snorted, waving around. “If he
Letting the grace fade, Cas bent his knees a little and set his feet, thrusting up harder into the other as his expression smoothed out with bliss. He was sure he hit the other’s prostrate when Dean moaned, a startled loud thing escaping his still reddened, abused lips. “
Smacking the door open with a fist, Dean felt satisfaction at the unadulterated panic in the others’ faces as he strode into the library, clad only in righteous anger and maternity hot dog pajamas. “You know, if you guys want to go behind my back this badly, maybe don’t have secret meetings at a time I’m fucking
"So that was true, too?" Dean asked, a little overwhelmed as he desperately tried to come up with the face of the nephil. "That was our kid, all grown up?" At Cas's lil nod, he let out a loud exhale. "Every day, there's something else, isn't there?"
"I upset you." Said Jack suddenly, looking crestfallen as he peered at the other. "I'm sorry, Dean but I don't understand why."
Snapping his fingers under the other’s nose, Dean tried to rock the baby in his other arm. “Hey, none of that— Focus. What are
, aren’t we?” He muttered, and Sam wasn’t sure it was meant to be heard. Then, suddenly, the older man was straightening his back, expression resolute. “We should move Cas.” Bobby decided, looking up at Sam. “He shouldn’t wake up— like this.”
And at the epicenter were Dean and Cas, sprawled on top of each other, and a squealing little mess, crying loudly and with enough divine power to rattle Bobby’s teeth.
Dean nodded and watched as Sam got up, regretfully leaving him on the floor. The moment his brother went into the infirmary, he sagged against the wall, swallowing hard. “Cas.” He murmured under his breath.
. Given this world’s unique biology and cultural background, there was not any pesky internalized biphobia holding Dean back. All I had to do was wait for you” And Chuck pointed at Castiel, who frowned further. “to pounce.”
“Raziel.” Replied Castiel, obviously confused. Taking a step forward, he also moved towards the front door, but Dean suddenly threw a hand out, grabbing his arm in a painful grip. “I’ll just—
He didn’t move, even when a thick jacket was dropped on his shoulders and a man sat beside him with a grunt, bones creaking under the strain.
“Been thinking about it since Christmas.” Confessed Dean. “But uh. I didn’t want to ask or do it with Bobby around. I love the man but— Some things are private.” He snorted. Two minutes.
Crowley mock frowned. “Cold.” Still, he shrugged, lifting his free hand. “But your wish is my command.” He snapped his fingers.
They weren’t strangers to the supernatural but had no idea what it entailed. They didn’t know about demons, about angels, about all the scary crap that lurked in the shadows. He was retiring, so he wouldn’t be hunting anymore, but nothing stopped the monsters from coming to
? Feeling Dean’s chest press against his own, his heart beating, feeling his abdomen twitch beneath his as he squirmed under him, skin to skin, from head to toe? Forget the gardens of Eden, forget all of God’s holy creations, this is where he wanted to be, where he wanted to spend the rest of his mortal life at.
Castiel knew of human biology like a noisy neighbor knew of everybody else's lives: by observation and no small amount of interest.
If he slipped and fell, Dean would most certainly end up in the freezing lake. Letting out a humorless snicker in the quiet of the day, Dean imagined Cas pulling his frozen ass out of the water hours later, reviving him, only to choke him right after in retaliation for being an
Cas titled his head. “I’m just asking if it is something you’d want. Or isn’t communication important in a relationship? Making sure we’re on the same page? Share goals?”
“So glad my unborn kid approves.” Dean rolled his eyes, feeling so absurdly fond of his two fools. “Jack it is, then.”
Pulling back, the blond tried to get his breathing under control. Could he even hyperventilate? He didn't remember, anymore.
Cas, the human, watched with concern as Dean slid down the wall in relief, sitting back again on the floor with their kid. As Sam hurried to check on them, the other Castiel clapped a hand on his shoulder, stopping him from following. "Give him a minute. He's in shock."
“That won’t hurt him, will it?” Bobby wondered as he walked around the bed, concern hidden behind his usual gruffness. He picked the cord gingerly, scrunching up his nose.
The moment he did, Castiel felt like screaming, panic bursting through him at the sight that greeted him.
Still, he was going to do everything he could to try and do it. Even if it took him most part of a year, between his recovery and work.
Dean, past the absurdly green irises and at that insanely bright soul. Now, with his grace gone, he was gifted with human perspective and lo and behold, they were still
.” Smiling almost smugly, Cas rewarded Dean’s patience and took the tip of his cock into his mouth, sucking. Dean
“Just cos yer sprinting past your prime, doesn’t mean ya can’t be out, having fun.” Tapping the calendar hanging on the wall, a gaudy, so very stereotypical picture of a naked female omega, Larson beamed almost predatorily. “Should be out there, raising hell! Take your nerdy alpha for a spin, hit a bar, hit the backseat of your car in a shadowy parking lot, if ya get I
Jack shook his head, eyes slowly beginning to glow gold. “I—” He paused, visibly holding himself back. Then, he deflated, radiance vanishing just as quickly. “I can’t.” He whispered, closing his eyes tightly. “I promised. I
, Bobby had agreed. Cas suppressed a huff, watching as Dean sorted through a lengthy rack of tees and sweatshirts. He
With a sigh, Dean tapped at the chair beside his. Bobby took it. "Jack— is special." The older alpha snorted. "Yeah. Understatement, but
Staring, Sam’s face twisted into one of his judgmental scowls, so familiar Dean almost laughed, despite the somber mood. “I’m being
Dean flushed in embarrassment. "I won't fit like this." He grunted, pulling the seat back at last as Cas fought a smile. "Shut
If there's anything I've always disliked in SPN!Omegaverse is how most people tend to just bulldoze over the characters' personalities so that they can better fit the roles.
Screaming, Jack wiggled in his grasp before a knickknack flew and barely missed Dean, omega ducking just in time.
And with that, Dean turned on the water and jumped into the shower, welcoming the shock of freezing cold on his back before it slowly began to warm.
“It’s not throwing it away.” Cas countered, irritated. Standing up, he walked to the other and squatted in front of him, resting his hands on Dean’s knees. “Dean— You mean too much to me. You’re willing to sacrifice your life for our child, so don’t tell me I can’t do the same with my grace.”
Ignoring the pain in his knees from the fall, the blond crawled the rest of the way to the doorway and then used the frame for support, pulling himself into a standing position once more. His legs shook, feeble, but held on, stubborn as the rest of him. Still, Dean knew: if Chuck found him as he was, he wouldn’t be able to put much of a fight.
Dean just nodded again, staring. “Had to rip off the placenta.” He said, like it was no big deal. In turn, Cas gaped at him as Jack made a confused noise, torn between curiosity and childish revulsion. Brain catching up to him, Dean looked around. His eyes met the older Castiel’s, and he stared, flabbergasted.
— peeked inside, looking around and tutting at the mess. Somehow, he missed Dean during the scrutiny, instead deciding to leave and continuing down the corridor.
Dean nodded. “Okay, so next time you feel overwhelmed, you talk to me.” He stated, giving Cas a pointed look. “Or, you know. Bobby. Someone. Anyone. Just— don’t let it consume you, ok? You’re human now.” And he said it matter-of-factly, trying not to rub salt on the wound. “You’ll be feeling things more acutely, I guess. Hell, you’re now learning how to actually feel, right?” Cas nodded. “You’ll need help to navigate all that, man. I mean, humans have their entire lives to do that and most still don’t know how.” Dean tried for a joke, jabbing a thumb towards himself. It worked, as Cas let out a small smile. “You’ve been there for us. Let us be there for you.”
Frustrated, Dean wondered how blunt he would have to be for Cas to take the final plunge. Knowing the man, he’d probably have to spell it out.
Not even half hour later, Dean was panting, covered in sweat. “I’m going to hurl.” He protested, feeling nauseous. Taking Gabriel’s words as a challenge, Jack had redoubled his efforts to come forth and soon, Dean was ready to beg for
“No.” Replied Dean easily, resting his head back against the bedpost. He stared at the ceiling, avoiding eye contact as he fell silent, trying to find the correct words to explain whatever was going on in his head. “It’s just.
By the time Castiel was back in control of his emotions, Dean was back with the rest of the food and the conversation was over.
“But that’s impossible, Rufus.” Dean interjected, seeing Cas’s mood darken and his scent sour at the jab. He raised a placating hand. Last thing they needed was Rufus on Castiel’s proverbial to-smite list, even if he
Before he could reply, Dean doubled over, gritting his teeth as a new contraction brought him to his knees. He could vaguely hear Sam talk to him, telling him to breathe through it, but all he could hear was his heartbeat in his ears as he dry-heaved.
Dean nodded, though he still looked unconvinced. “I don’t know.” He sighed at last. “He was weirder than usual, today. I mean, he’s been a downright bastard this past week—”
“Yeah, well” Dean began to walk away. “Just watch out for the traditionalists.” He said over his shoulder.
Dean pulled the collar of his shirt tighter around his neck, amusing the other further. “Seriously? This is what you decide to talk about, after all that?”
Letting the other go, Larson took a step back, still tense. All amusement had vanished, leaving behind a closed off, almost dangerous old hunter. “I said, take the day off.” He waved him off. “Get outta here.”
“Yeah. The other one, not ours.” Clarified Dean, drawing the last sigil. The runes glowed briefly before settling, and he rose to his feet, grunting with the effort. “You need to carve this in
If he came across a knife, Dean felt he might just start stabbing, so instead, he grabbed all that composed his nest and was making his way to the garage to rest in peace when both Cas and Gabriel materialized right in front of him, blocking his way. Dean downright growled before any of them could say a word. "I'm slowly growing crazy with the other two, so watch it: you're on mighty thin ice." Dean warned.
“This is your child too. Make no mistake, I ain’t trying to exempt you from responsibility, but this is, ultimately, about Dean’s bodily autonomy, too. You can’t force him to do what he doesn’t wanna do with his own body. You can’t rip it out or smite that kid in him and then expect him to just deal with it. It’s about
, Dean considered. He kept forgetting Cas was older than dirt. “What will it be, Cas?” Asked Dean, shaking the hangers still waiting on his arms.
. So, he waited with Cas, their heavy breathing the only sound in their otherwise silent bedroom as they kissed, unhurried. “Gotta admit.” Whispered Dean against Cas’s mouth as their lips parted, adjusting, and giving Castiel’s hand a squeeze, to let him know he could move. “Didn’t expect the direct approach to actually work. Would have tried it sooner if I knew.”
Suddenly, a throat was cleared. “That stew coming or not?!” Gabriel yelled from the living room, before there was an explosion of furious whispers and the sound of more than one hand smacking the archangel non too gently.
Suddenly, in the beta’s place, was a short young man, brown hair coiffed and eyes full of mischief, even as Castiel pressed the knife closer to his skin at the real sight of him. “You asked.” Gabriel shrugged, at the surprise in everyone’s face. “As for what these two did, well.” He snorted, clapping his hands as he caught Dean’s eyes, watching him from over his shoulder with a furrowed brow. “Congratulations, Dean-o.
