Had been since Billie got here and broke the news. Cas pushed a sausage around his plate and stayed silent while his family ate around him. Dean spoke up, "Hey. Cas, buddy, you okay? Been a little quiet."
"Hey. Hey!" Sam rolled his eyes, reaching out his hand, "Give us a room key before you lock us out, Romeo."
Dean passed Castiel hugging their toddler and mussed the kid's hair, "Later, squirt."
Sam chuckled as he quoted a line from a song named Tyrone, "
Jack ripped open his fruit cup as soon as it arrived. He picked out four strawberries from the mix with his fingers. He put them on top of his stack and poured strawberry syrup over it. Then he smiled over his masterpiece. Sam remembered the special breakfast Dean made last week. The strawberry pancakes were a hit. Apparently they were still on Jack's mind.
Dean raised his finger, "This is strictly on a trial basis! And I'm keeping an eye on everything you do, okay, no going rogue around open flames."
"Alright. If they say so. We got the space." She answered pleasantly, stretching a hand out. "Hattie."
Cas nodded quickly, "Yes. Yes, definitely."
Castiel tapped his forehead against Dean's for a moment. "I'm not feeling pressured, Dean."
Castiel sighed. "I don't think that's a good idea. You'd probably stop listening halfway through and start pleasuring yourself."
Amara started to laugh. "Tea? Rowena. We'd have to make a whole day of it."
Jack jumped up with a big, energetic smile on his face, "I want to help Sam with the maps and casting tonight! Maybe we can have a sleepover!"
Jack exhaled shakily, feet unsteady as he pushed the breath out of his lungs. When the last bit of oxygen left the boy, Amara pulled her hand from his chest. Her nails were pink again. The Darkness clasped her hands at her chest. She surveyed the room, eyes checking every corner of the place. "Mmm. That'll do nicely."
"How could I forget?"
Castiel chimed in, "Isn't Metatron dead? The last time we saw him, he helped rescued me from Amara's trap with Sam and Donatello. He stayed to fight her off while we escaped. She was furious about losing me and Lucifer. She'd just been betrayed by Dean-- and her brother. I can't imagine Metatron survived her wrath."
"I'm glad we're the only people seeing them act like idjits." Sam groaned as he scrubbed out a pot with his sleeves pushed up. He didn't want to ruin his new flannel.
"It's incredible." Billie tapped her nail against the table, glancing behind her at the empty bar in San Diego. She looked around the door, checking the window. "The Winchesters and Jack should have been here by now. The floors are etched, the spell is set up in the corner, the Empty is ready and waiting for our command. What's keeping them?"
Castiel answered, "I think of sex quite differently than you do, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. We just have to communicate more."
"No, you didn't."
"Wait." Castiel grabbed his hand and pulled Dean back in behind the fridge. They stood together quietly for a moment, Dean's palms on Castiel's chest as they looked into each other's eyes. Cas reached up and rubbed Dean's hand softly with a smile on his face. "I'm glad we do this now. Us."
They batted their eyelashes over their Prada sunglasses, "I go by Meta now."
Ghosting his way down long halls and cavernous rooms, he eventually found himself in the back of the basement. There was a steep dip in the floor to make space for large trucks for shipments, accessible by a ramp. There was a huge gated door for the trucks. Beside it, a human sized door.
Amara flicked her wrist at the wall, a long golden rip appearing in the white paint. The wall cracked and split open to create a large gash in the fabric of space and time. It looked just like the one Jack had made when he was born, long glistening and golden. She glanced at Billie, batting her long lashes. "Wanna get this outta the way? We can knock it out right now. I have brunch with Ms. Wintour later, and coming up with next year's Met Gala theme gonna take up most of my morning."
"Okay." Cas looked Dean gently in the eyes, "Are you upset with me? With what I did?"
"Oh, no problem. I bet my brother was an absolute jerk. He has this weird thing about interspecies relationships." Amara shook her head. "I don't understand it."
Sam started to frown, "Uh... is that it..."
Jack gazed up at the three standing. Dean, Sam, and Castiel. The nephil began to smile, "No, I am. All three of em. Thanks for helping us, Metatron."
The nephil opened the door. Sam stood with his hands in his pockets by the dumpster, Dean and Castiel chatting closely beside him. The three had changed into black tee shirts for an easy change. It was jarring to see Castiel without a coat on. The shirt fit a bit snug because it was one of Dean's. That was probably it. Jack froze the lock and let it go. He sprinted towards his parents, gaining visibility. They noticed him, straightening up and taking their shirts from the boy. Sam got a white button up with a company emblem on the collar. Dean and Castiel took moss green concierge jackets with red and gold military style embroidery. Jack changed into a black waiter's apron over his oxford. Then, they were off to their respective corners of the resort. No time to sight see.
Dean stared blankly at him, "So, you're telling me you'd sift through the pile of..."
Dean shot up, eyes wide. "B-buh-baby?"
you and Cas. I watch everybody. Sam too."
Dean snapped his head over to Cas, eyes sharp and worried, "Did you add something to the pot when I wasn't looking? Cas. Come on. This recipe is finely crafted! Forty years in the making--"
There weren't more than 500 people here. It was small, but the culture was strong. Native owned, Wamsutter (or previously Washakie) was home to the Shoshone and Ute tribes. The locals ran businesses by the road -- a few motels too. And the view was simple. Large plots of wide land, gently cared for and respected just miles from the mountains.
Dean's hand traveled up to Castiel's cute messy hair, fingers playing in the curls at the base of his neck as he kissed Cas back. Wow, he's kissing Cas back. Cas kissed him first. And, he's like... really good at it. Maybe Dean should slip him some tongue. Nah. That's too much. Right? Oop. Apparently not. Wow, Cas. Okay. Alright. Dean grabbed Cas's face and really started to give it to him.
in my life. I have no idea where to look."
"Dean Winchester would never marry me."
"Do you work here now?" the deep voice inquired.
There was a quiet knocking at the double doors at the head of the bar.
"Nice," Dean passed him a key with a big three on it. "Enjoy room three."
Dean lifted his hands, holding both of his index fingers about seven or eight inches apart. Then he looked up at his brother. "I know there's one thing you wanna know."
This is not what he had planned. Being so close to Castiel brought out all kinds of feelings. Especially now that they're back together.
Sam stuffed his hands into his pocket and paced behind the trunk for a second, "Fine."
"I know. It is practical, which is absolutely nothing like you. I don't buy it."
But forgiveness? From Dean Winchester? Not an easy accomplishment. Especially regarding the murder of his mother. Dean, Sam, and their father spent over 20 years tracking and killing the last supernatural creature that dared take Mary from them. Both of the boys' formative years centered around the notion that whatever kills their mother deserves to die.
"Dean!"
"I know. I heard them, my love." Cas kissed his forehead once before opening his arms for Dean to run off and get back to painting. "Let's get back to work."
With the Empty looming over his head, Castiel was sure he wouldn't survive last night. Dean needed him. Terrible nightmares plagued the man as his mind cracked under the weight of his pain. The things Dean tried to forget often came for him when he was at his most vulnerable. He woke in hysterics and when Cas left to check on their boys, he came back to see the poor man shaking and holding a gun in the center of the bed.
They locked eyes for a long moment, sharing that time together and breathing it in. Cas mouthed the words "thank you" to Dean from across the room.
"It means thank you for everything. And I'm sorry I say weird stuff, but please stick around."
With that, she disappeared.
"Yeah, yeah. You always threaten to throw things into the abyss. You never do." Jack took another bite, savoring the yummy sandwich, "So, Dean cooks for you because he sees you as his... brother?"
Sam walked over to Dean and patted his arm sincerely. "Don't feel weird. It's not. Whatever you wanna do you guys are gonna have me and Jack. We're not gonna laugh or make fun. We love you. Really. And we just want you to be happy."
Castiel patted Jack's wrist, "They know. Just let them have this."
Jack shifted the big bowling ball in his arms. "I don't believe you..."
The angel pressed his hand to Dean's chest, letting some grace seep in, whispering the whole time, "You're okay, Dean. I'm here. It's alright. You're okay. You'll be fine. You're safe. Everything is okay."
Dean tightened his fingers around what he was holding as he scratched nervously behind his neck.
Dean looked him up and down as if he didn't believe him. He's praying now. No words, just that feeling. That longing, tugging pull. It felt like a whispering breath against his ear, a hand running up his chest, fingers in his hair. That son of a bitch. Dean settled on Castiel's eyes, "That's what I like to hear."
"Baby, I love this side of you." Dean pushed himself away from Castiel, a bright blush coloring his neck and ears. He put the ice cream away. Shutting the freezer, he reached out a hand to his angel. "Let's check on our boys."
angel blades."
Jack ran to the little games, and his fathers watched fondly before they decided to do their own exploring. Sam inspected the books on the table while Dean went to find the kitchen. Exiting the hallway to the left was a bar top table leading right to it.
A long white feather glowed in the lamplight as Sam held it up. The edges looked as though they'd been dipped in gold, shimmering at the tip. Very similar to an angel feather, but much longer and brighter. He hasn't seen a golden dipped angel feather since... Morning Star. Oh, no.
"Exactly what I'm friggin saying! In Through The Out Door is way too underrated! It's not their best album ever, but man. People gloss right over it. Half of it's on your mixtape. I mean, what do you think?"
. You can't! You're friends and it works. Besides, you shouldn't be that sweet on him in the first place. But, you're just so close. You owe him your life. And... and you can't live without him, so maybe it's not weird... even though it definitely is. And you know what you want and you're looking right at it, but it's not... you can't..."
Dean pushed Cas's shoulder, "Smooth move."
Dean worried, breath picking up in his chest, "I just dunno how to say it. I can't... talk to him cuz I'm just... I don't even know what's gonna come out. And you know me. You know I can be a dick without meaning too. It wasn't him that did what he did. I get what it is to be out of control, Cas. But if I don't punish him for this, then I let him kill -- not only my mother -- but my dad's wife. Her death ended him! What kind of monster does that make me if I keep raising Jack?"
While on the phone with Jack, it had started to rain. A few drops weren't an issue, but it picked up. Strong winds and big, fast droplets fell hard, causing them to take immediate shelter in the car. Dean ran into the backseat, pulling the angel in with him with the wet phone to his ear. Laughing with Jack about their situation, the angel closed the door behind them. The car was dry and safe. Rain pattered loudly against the windows and roof. Dean crawled into the seat shivering, wet and a bit cold. Cas huddled in close to his human. Castiel promised to keep him warm so that they didn't have to start the car to put the heat on.
"Hm."
"No, you're a very bad boy, Dean. Always have been."
Sam replied, "I can't help but think we don't even have this moment. Chuck's waiting just outside city lines, trapping us in Amara's Barbie dream house. All of this is literally too good to be true."
The angel scoffed at that thought, almost wanting to spit it out. For years, he's loved that human more than the grace in his vessel's veins. Now that they finally have a domestic partnership and are raising a child together -- now that Castiel is within grasp of getting everything he ever wanted -- he's stuck with a primordial NDA. He just wants one day where things might not crash down around him. One day to be happy. He knew exactly where he would go, what he would do, who he would kiss, and how he'd love him.
Jack felt sick thinking about the pain he caused his parents. But Dean and Castiel had a long talk with him last night -- a real conversation -- and the two agreed they were Team Jack. Having the love of his family meant the world to him, and acceptance from Dean made his soul feel so bright and happy. Jack felt something fall down the back of his robe. That would be his feathers. Great. There are more every hour. How many would fall until he's done growing?
Castiel's eyes flashed blue for a moment, "I said I'll talk to him later."
Dean folded his arms and grumbled at them until they shut up.
As soon as the kid turned his back, Sam pulled out his phone to text his brother about the ridiculousness of the current situation. Jack is not only about to bowl for the first time with a ball way too big for him, but the nephil is 100% convinced that the floor is magic. Then he remembered why they were bowling in the first place.
Dean closed his eyes in disappointment, "I fucked it up. I knew I would--"
Sam washed the dishes with deep concentration, refusing to give Castiel eye contact. "You and Dean can enjoy your first night together without needing to... monitor your volume... or clothing..."
Sam answered, "People out of their business."
"Dean."
"Knew it." Dean smiled widely, grinning up at the angel, "It's like I just read your mind."
The Winchester family sat in silence at the breakfast table. Billie's sudden absence left an empty space in the room. Each task seemed to come with its various complications, and her newest demand was looking to be no different.
Rowena grinned over at Sam as he packed away the books and ingredients back into their satchels, storing them by the door for quick escape. "Your boy is about to save us all."
Dean tightened the cuff on Chuck's wrist and pulled his arms back, releasing them hard to knock Chuck's forehead into the table in front of them.
"I don't mind sore."
So, the angel will sit through his various human lessons. He'll sit through a hundred -- a thousand. The schooling might not take all of the time, but Cas will watch and admire and help when needed. Sometimes they even make a great team like they did this morning cooking breakfast. It took a minute to find their rhythm, but Jack and Sam sung their praises as they feasted. It worked.
"Ew." Sam lifted the glass of "juice" in front of his plate, peering into it with a green look on his face, "So... do I... chew this..."
Dean popped his head up, "No! Of course not!"
Dean gazed, "Dude, forget PAC man, I'm gonna wreck you in
Castiel looked away again, giving himself away somehow due to his human's laughter.
He turned back to Castiel to find the angel sitting at the table. His jackets were hanging on the chair behind him. In his shirtsleeves and tie, Cas ground a russet potato against the grater, little strips coming down with ease. He focused on getting the job over with.
The boys didn't mind giving Jack that room at all. Daresay it was tailored for the boy. Amara sure is intuitive. Dean walked through the room, checking the dresser beside the telescope. There were sports drinks and fruit in the fridge, books on the shelves. As the dresser drawer opened, Dean saw a neat folded row of sweaters. He opened another one. Jeans. Another drawer had underclothes and socks. Another had pajamas. Another had swim clothes for the pool downstairs, sweat clothes for the gym.
you let me take these off of you."
Dean may not know this yet, but Castiel is neurodivergent. He didn't understand he was being flirted with. He asked Dean a question and didn't get an answer. So, Cas felt (and looked) a bit harried now because Dean wouldn't choose a pastry. Cas pointed at the strawberry donuts. Then he offered a cookies and creme filled donut. Both were great options. He glanced up at Dean, prompting an answer from him with those stern inquisitive blue eyes.
Castiel nodded, "Yes! Of course. I won't let you down."
Dean passed the bottle over to Cas, their fingers brushing as the whisky exchanged hands, "No."
exhausted. He was a motionless lump of nephilim, finally escaping the confines of his pain. As the boy lay slumped and snoozing in Castiel's arms, breathing deeply and even, the door opened.
Castiel begged. "I have to be here for him. He has no one right now. This is..." He looked back to Amara, Billie, and Chuck. "What we're asking him to do... he needs his father."
Castiel shook his head, staring up at Dean with fear, "Dean. I don't want that for you."
Cas looked back blearily, "I'm too tired."
Cas wandered through the bunker from room to room like a ghost. His eyes were vacant and dusty, but he refused to sit or talk to anyone. This was nothing like the last time Jack died. Castiel was there, watching it all unfold, helpless as his child was taken from him. All he could hear was Jack crying while he burned from the inside out.
"Sorry." Jack replied, looking up at his dad, "Do you think Sam meant it? That he's safe? What if he's lying again?"
They sat in a diner in Emory, nursing coffees and chatting. Jack bounced in his seat, full of energy as he colored the back of the children's menu. He sat with one leg tucked underneath him and the other on the floor. A cheap green crayon sat pinched between his fingers as he colored a cowboy hat. He drew little pictures on the blank page with deep concentration.
Dean turned away and cleared his throat, "Oh. Well... uh,
Licking a firm line in the fabric over Dean's cock, Cas closed his eyes. He breathed deeply and did it again. His tongue wetted the cloth sucking on it, but he didn't care.
By the time Castiel and Jack got to the living room, it was full. The thunderstorm still poured outside the window, rain smacking the windows as the angel and nephil descended the black metal staircase together. Jack's sneakers hit the steps as he rushed down the steps to Sam and Dean, dragging Cas by his hand. The boy wore a black suit with dark sunglasses with a fake plastic earpiece and a big suitcase he found in Sam's room. He was beaming as he hurried down the steps with Castiel, waving broadly. "Hi, Billie! Hi, Amara! I'm ready for the secret mission!"
"I... uh..." An unintelligible string of words got caught in Dean's throat at the sound of that. Dean didn't know if it was Castiel's deep voice or the fight he just won or the fact that it's
"Yeah, I'm fine. Leave me alone." Dean groaned. He was not alright. Dean wanted to bang his best friend. Castiel is his strongest ally, his confidante, his key strategist, his fellow soldier, his guardian angel. And here Dean is getting excited after spending the night cuddling all over him in the backseat like some lovesick tween. Dean's a complete mess. He's constantly embarrassing himself in front of Castiel.
"Raincheck?"
"Yeah."
Amara answered, nodding to Sam. "The warding is complete. Just a few more sigils on the walls, and Chuck could storm this place all he wants.... there's no getting out."
Dean blushed. He brought their linked hands up to his chin and brushed his lips against Castiel's knuckle. Then he looked up, worried about what he would see in those blue eyes. The angel stared deeply at him. Dean found himself speechless as Cas untangled their fingers and cupped his hand against Dean's rough jaw.
They had to leave Jack's body behind.
"I'm god, Dean. I'll clean up that mess in an hour." Chuck gave Dean a blank stare. "Don't give me that attitude. I tried every scenario after the angels Fell. I had to plant Gadreel. It was my only play. If I didn't separate you boys, you wouldn't have lasted a week and you
Jack nodded tearfully.
Metatron started playing with their long brunette curls, twirling their manicured finger down their delicate shoulder. They smiled warmly in recollection. "Ah. Yes. That brings back memories. There was this... love nest he built for us to host a few of our workplace affairs."
Jack whined in the backseat. "Where's Dad?"
to trick me into damning my siblings. I was hunted by my family. Tortured. I killed my own kind. Committed war crimes. I struggle to look at myself in the mirror after the things I did in a futile attempt to clean up that mess. Your mess."
"Beau?"
Dean gazed up at him. "Me?"
Castiel stated, "Well, I've known him since 2008! I saw more than enough to be sure he would laugh at me if I said anything. Or worse. He'd yell. Tell everyone. I would have to leave. I'd be ruined and our friendship would be over. I do love your father, it's true. But I love him for who he is. A human with a short life. I love all of his flaws and beauty and heart and passion and pain equally. I know I don't deserve him. So does he."
"You don't tell me what to do." Amara waved it in front of him for a moment before flipping through, "This is a good read and all, but I'd like to skip to the end."
The trunk slammed shut and Castiel looked into the backseat, seeing Sam sitting in his place beside Jack.
"I'll teach you anything you want to know."
"Jack!" Castiel warned, "Do not repeat that around the Winchesters."
Those moments are so rare, but they're real to Cas. They do happen, these moments. They exist scattered along their history. Nights where emotions were running high and Dean needed to feel
Castiel answered, "It's the truth."
Dean and Castiel leaned into each other, connecting like magnets. They held each other close, rocking gently and kissing on the carpet. They'll flee in a minute.
"No." Castiel replied, "He's having a glass of whiskey in the library. He likes to talk to me while he relaxes."
Dean did call him. It was almost four in the morning. Jack answered quickly. From the sound of it, the nephil had gotten into the kitchen cupboards. The unmistakable snap-crackle-pop stuttered over the line as Dean apologized. Castiel just sat by and listened.
. I'm taking Jack by myself."
Cas huffed, "Not much better than us. He told me to tell you that Max and Alicia are here. And that they brought their mother's pie recepie. Donna's gonna figure that out in the kitchen with them if you wanted to get out of your room."
Sam chuckled, "Hey! It's cool with me. Just be safe. Use condiments."
Castiel leaned over and whispered. "Subductisupercilicarptor. It's Latin for hyper-critical."
The engine roared to life, and Castiel asked when it subsided, "Will I get to use the stove?"
Castiel watched the floors raise. Almost there. They passed the tenth floor. A couple more seconds.
Metatron rolled their eyes behind a pair of vintage black Prada shades. Their phone buzzed in their pocket. Metatron raised a manicured finger. "Wait! Don't stab me. Gimmie a second. I'm on the clock." They pulled out a bright red smart phone with #MetaMansion embossed on the back in glitter. Metatron checked the message and sighed out a disappointed, "Jesus." before putting their phone back into their leggings pocket to continue their conversation. "Why should I tell you anything? Our strained relationship isn't all my fault, you know. Yes, alright. Yeah. I admit it. I fucked you. But, to punish me for like
"Of course."
He let out a big breath, pushing out from his seat at the kitchen table. He left the soaking bowl of potatoes, the grater, and the rest of his tools where they were. Dean walked over to the angel and took him by the shoulder, steering him towards the sink, "First, hands. Wash them. Please -- don't touch the faucet, it's gonna get dirty. Just let me."
The angel lacked finesse, but picked up on things quickly. Dean gave occasional instructions as he went. "Slower", "Deeper", "Harder". Cas listened to them all, arms folded over Dean's hips as he sucked merrily. Cas reached down to his sweatpants and pushed his hand inside. He breathed out his relief, a growl of arousal bursting from his throat while he pleasured his lover. Cas looked up at the quivering hunter. Dean was a mess, his chest was red and panting, fingers buried in Cas's hair, back arching into his angel. That was exactly what he wanted to see. Castiel could easily get off watching that. Cas's hand picked up the pace in his sweatpants as he gave Dean head with the intention of sucking that human into a coma. He wanted to make that man lose his mind. Dean can shake harder, he can sweat more. Castiel isn't done with him.
Castiel's mouth went dry as he looked his hunter up and down for a moment, knowing exactly how beautiful that sight would be after spending last night with him. And now, he's going to get three months of it. Cas raised his hands up to cup Dean's face as he confessed. "I would love to meet him."
Chuck couldn't contemplate that Jack's adopted parents could possibly love him enough to make a deal with The Empty to give him another chance at life. Little did he know, that second power up came with big strings attached. His tragically saddened father Castiel can never find happiness. And if Jack used his powers -- lived as his true self -- that suddenly meant losing himself. To be Jack in the face of a crisis means an outburst of power. Those outbursts helped save his family, but unfortunately, his good deeds took more and more from him as time went on. Soon, Michael had to be dealt with. And that. Took. Everything.
"Oft, Dean! Never mind you." Rowena pushed her fingers into her hair in frustration as she began to pace
The Winchesters leaned out of the car, asking him where he was going. The nephil boy ran and ran. His little SpongeBob battle jammies flapped around his ankles as he raced to the room. As soon as he reached the door, Cas appeared holding a duffle bag. Jack stopped him.
Sam laughed, uncapping a water bottle in front of the open fridge, "Jeez. Touchy."
, I'm a warrior." Dean glared, stretching his arms and pushing himself up from where he was sitting. He pressed a hand against his forehead and groaned. "Demons fear me."
Sam joined hands with Castiel and Jack, his voice turned to the moon, commanding its attention with his sharp tongued Latin. His face lifted to the starry sky as he yelled, demanding he be given the location of the Fallen angel. His hair whipped past his brow in the wind, eyes sharp and focused on the sky above. The stones in the curse box vibrated hard, raising one by one. They spun in place, on top of the other in a line, the large red stone at the height of them.
Dean laughed, "Is it 'thrilling'?"
It's all coming back to him.
Dean smirked and pushed him playfully one more time, "You're amazing, you're the shit."
He stopped walking for a moment and cursed quietly to himself. He told himself he'd stop abandoning the man when his feelings got too strong. But this was a serious situation, Dean would understand. Jack was in pain. Their son needed him. Castiel shook his head and started walking again.
He looked to Rowena. She fell all over him when they first met. Now, here she is ruling Hell with her powers completely unleashed. Against him. Sam, Dean, and Castiel stood as a united front like they always seemed to do.
With a soft smile, Castiel squeezed a butt cheek. "As long as we make up."
"I am worried that you're active listening right now, but I need to be sure you understand. Because I gotta grab another beer if I have to explain all of this again."
Castiel scoffed at that, "It's not gross. I'm cooking. Accidents happen. I'll clean it later."
Dean pushed the pillow over his head and whined.
"Hey. You don't owe me shit and that's final. Not up for debate. Alright?" Dean cuffed the kid's chin, and smiled to himself as he did so. That strong bone structure under that baby face made him look so much like Cas sometimes. It was everything to Dean to look at his son and see his angel staring back at him. "Now, go sit down! Eat. Just try everything out, okay? We even made strawberry pancakes. Ever had those?"
Sam chuckled, "Oh, shit."
Cas didn't care about coolant or engines or gaskets. He just knows when something is broken and needs fixing. Dean cares. He loves cars and reconstructing and restoring and fine tuning. He has an eye for mechanics and engineering, a mind that can take things apart and then put them back together again piece by piece.
They should have kept track of time.
That warm, sweet, soft, fresh snacks from the oven that tasted like life. Sugary, syrupy, chocolatey. All delicious in their own right. One day, Dean made salted caramel pudding for everyone. Said it tastes like going to a spa. Jack hopes he's right.
His parents, on the other hand, felt differently. They'd gotten the next step from her: find a secret room. It was unbelievably cryptic. Completely on brand for her, but frustrating none the less.
"Oh, yeah." Dean promised, admiring the cold zucchini he'd taken from the fridge. "For sure."
Amara reached into Death's cloak and lifted Billie's chin with a gentle fingertip looking into her deep brown eyes. The two powerful creatures spoke silently for a moment. Then Amara stated simply. "You've been busy. I'm impressed."
Cas patted his shoulder warmly, rubbing his hand along Dean's back. "Thought I'd try it out. Figured now was the time."
Dean let out a little smile, pulling Cas's hand and lacing their fingers apart and together again. "Look at you, Mr. Strategy. Full of great ideas today."
"You're the one giving me space to bang your friend."
"No. I'll keep it warm." Castiel replied. "It won't take much."
. I've repaired my relationship with Heaven. Saved it several times since we last spoke. They've come to trust me again." Castiel took another step forward. "My word is bond."
Jack asked, "But, he loves you?"
Then, it was warm.
"Crowley taught me a thing or two about deals when I was a demon. He was trying to get me ready for the throne. Every day, he'd slip me a fact about the court system, laws, weapons, crossroads, spiritual transactions, you name it. Crowley had this saying: you get more when you phrase it properly. As an equal party in this deal, you have rights to whatever you want as long as long as it matches the details of your agreement. Cosmic law isn't about power, it's about about proving you followed the rules and took as much as you possibly could. That's why I was so pissed when you killed Billie after she helped get us out of prison. She could have taken either one of us for breaking the blood pact, but she became Death and saw the bigger picture." Dean said, leaning into the angel. "Now, Crowley was a piece of work, but he knew a Hell of a lot about bargaining. I learned from the best."
Castiel had set the table and was now placing four plates down in front of each respective chair. His eyes were sharply focused on the task at hand, but Dean could tell Cas had been watching the interaction between him and Jack. There was a small upturn to his mouth, and as far as Cas goes that's a full on grin. Dean's heart felt warm. Castiel was happy with him again. It was possible after all. They were becoming closer as a family. Dean just had to get over himself.
Dean stalled for a moment, "What do you wanna... do?"
Castiel sighed out. "Which one is it then?"
"Let me do the pancakes. I started it. I can finish it."
The fireplace roared to life after Castiel pressed a button. The angel jumped, pressing it again to turn it off. "No." He pressed another button, the lights brightening and then dimming. "There's a chair here that's quite comfortable if you'd like me to stay and watch over you tonight." Castiel pressed another button and a loud thumping unlocking sound clicked.
. He wasn't ready to let go of him.
Dean slammed his fist on the table, "How are we supposed to find a place that no one's ever friggin been to?"
"Oh, you'd be surprised at how quickly my brother moves." Sam said with haunted eyes.
"I said the word 'little' twice, Cas."
Castiel nodded. "Good call."
Amara answered calmly, "Chuck could have given him a new soul after reversing the effects of the truth spell, and everything would have been fine. He tends to overreact whenever anything challenges his power. It's petulant, childish, masculine -- no offense."
Sam folded his arms over the roof of the car, grinning at Dean widely. "Hey. You're my big brother. I know when you're mad. And I'll love and support you no matter what lifestyle choice you make--"
"Our family is different. Unconventional. I'm raising you with two brothers, not my spouse. And Dean... he likes women, Jack. Much more than he likes me. And that's the end of it. I'm lucky we're co-parenting together. I won't ask more of him. It wouldn't end well. He desires a wife. Not a warrior."
The Darkness glanced back to Billie, meeting Death's eye. She raised her delicate hand and snapped. A huge stack of papers fell from the ceiling and onto the booth with a satisfying thunk. After that, a bucket of multicolored crayons landed beside it. Billie chuckled. "You're giving him crayons?"
Sam folded his arms. "Dean. Let's be realistic here. I'm volunteering to take the kid out of the hotel for a little bit. I don't mind, you know that."
"No problem, Dean."
Dean stared down at him in confusion. "Okay."
Castiel patted his back, "You heard Sam. He doesn't think you're a freak. And he used to drink demon blood the way Dean drinks beer."
Blue eyes shone through a gummy smile. Dean felt so warm and glowy in his chest. It felt so good, Dean pushed him. Cas pushed him back, sending Dean's heart flying into the counter. The angel set the potatoes down on the counter and picked up the ladle, walking it to the sink and giving it soap and water. Cas washed it. Then he held it hostage and asked to make one pancake. Dammit all, Dean let him. He kept a close watch and walked Cas through every step. The angel gave it a level of concentration usually designated to bomb diffusion. The pancake turned out surprisingly well. Castiel decided to slide it onto Jack's plate under two of Dean's bigger pancakes. Cas wanted their son to have it. Judging from Jack's initial reaction at his first taste, their teamwork paid off.
Derek Sharp started to sing.
"Come on, Sammy."
And now it's awkward.
"I'm cooking tonight, so you guys can chill here for now. Take a shower, check out the rooms, whatever you wanna do. We can tour those restaurants tomorrow."
Meta grinned. "What? I'm a selfish bitch."
She put her hands on her hips, pacing around the carpet. "Here's a hint. I'm driven, I'm adorable, I'm an incredible writer. And one fine Sunday, you and I kicked all the angels out of church together. Then you broke me out of jail, so I didn't have to do time. Sound familiar?"
Castiel didn't respond.
' type thing?"
Jack promised, "You have my word. I promise. We will respect the space."
He wanted to make Lucifer do his dirty work, by swiping the nephilim off of the board, leaving Chuck the most powerful. Hence why a rip to a failed universe opened when Jack was born. Jack's very existence needed to be exterminated from Chuck's perspective. Angels and demons alike knew when Jack was conceived. One can safely assume Chuck got, at least, a Twitter notification. So, he did what he does best. He wrote his own victory.
"Jack." Amara smiled warmly as she floated toward the doors. "Not yet, child. I protected the space. You may now enter."
He stared up at his new store a week later in sunny Palo Alto. Dean blinked slowly as he checked out the building from the parking lot, noticing that this particular Pizza Hut was
"One cartoon. No candy." Sam laughed. He patted Jack proudly on the back, chest puffed out as he agreed, "But, sure. That sounds fine to me."
Amara checked her nails as Chuck walked into the room. "I wouldn't be too worried about anyone stabbing me. I mean, I would if I were you. But, I'm not you." Amara laughed. "And, I'd never be you. Ever."
"Seriously?" Sam gestured toward the angel at the table, "Cas was in trouble! I was trying to see if I could track him through Lucifer, but Amara was hiding them both. I couldn't cast. That was gonna be it, I swear. By the time Metatron got to the bunker to help us break Cas out, we had a better lead on him anyway." Sam huffed and confessed to the breakfast table before him, "But, I had all the ingredients lying around in the dungeon and the moon was still in its best phase, so I decided to hit Metatron with it instead. That way we could keep an eye on him, you know?"
Dean stopped breathing for a second as he read the cover. He didn't remember how he got it, but the book was in his hands and he was flipping through it silently with wide eyes. Dean sighed and looked up at Cas, sharing a heartfelt gaze with the angel. He glanced at the living room where Sam was on the couch watching Jack play what looked like PacMan. His palms grew sweaty and he gulped, feeling impulsive.
The booth sat large and wooden, sigils carved into it as well as the chair. The wood was fortified from the fallen angel Anna's tree. Pure creation for the creator. On the table was a big stack of papers and a bucket of crayons. Above the table a new page would float down from the ceiling and into the pile of papers every few minutes, beside it a new crayon would fall from the ceiling and into the bucket. Forcing him into the chair, Dean pressed Chuck's small shoulders down as Sam came in to tie him to the chair with ropes.
"What do you think I mean, dollface? Hot young linebacker fella, cute little thing like yourself... you two gave a pretty show from where I was sitting."  Chuck sneered. "I just
Sam grinned, lifting his hand "High five!"
"And, I love that about you." Amara waved her hand, ropes and handcuffs falling from Meta's arms as she gazed around the room, "What's this about my little brother having a hissy fit?"
Dean sighed, leaning back in his chair and taking a sip of his glass, "It's the only thing." Dean let out a soft, wistful chuckle, "Isn't it absolutely fucking bonkers... that after years of begging you to stick around when I'm going through it, the time comes where you actually do, and it's the worst? I feel..."
The four walked up to a second living room. A large TV, family sized couch, end tables, and in the corner an entire foosball setup.
Dean brushed his finger against the little dip in Cas's stubbled chin, "Yeah? You do?"
"How?"
Dean and Castiel locked eyes in fear.
"Ow! Receiving prayers gives me headaches." Jack shook his head, placing a hand on Castiel's forehead, "Does it hurt?"
Dean watched the gasket roll on the floor and started to laugh, "Yeah, that's definitely the wrong one."
"They had to tie you down before you agreed to help them save people?" Amara started to laugh, "Oh, Meta."
"No. You're with me, I'll be okay. Keep it open." Dean looked up at Castiel. "Let him watch."
Dean continued to yell. "No! I'm not mad at you, baby, just bring me the coolant! And ten of your closest guesses to what you
"Well, I dunno what were you guys doing yelling that loud when other people live with ya? Don't blame me." Sam countered, folding his arms at his brother. "I was getting a midnight snack at the worst time in the world. You think I wanted to hear that?"
Dean laughed, "You don't have to."
Dean reached out his hand. "But, can I have my bag back? I can take it to the room."
Meta started to smile back. "Yeah. Me too."
Dean walked into his space, taking Cas by the sides of his face. He pressed in and kissed him, "You have nothing to worry about. I have a thing for nerdy guys with wings... and a temper." Castiel's eyes slipped closed, passion clouding his vision in the hunter's arms. Dean kissed him again, palms sliding past Cas's stubble to bury his fingers in his thick dark hair. "I choose you, angel. I'll always choose you." Dean kissed him a third time, warm and slow. "Those girls were wild and their booze was expensive. But, you..." Castiel pulled Dean in by his waist. Dean bit Cas's lower lip before deepening the kiss. "You are so fucking sexy, Daddy."
Dean picked his head back up, "I dont mean to. It slips out of me when I'm around you. I just... I don't know why."
"Cas, I really like you. Whenever I see you, sex crosses my mind and now that we're together like this, I'm thinking about it constantly. Fuck, I'm even dreaming about it. But, you're not really a sexual guy. I don't ever want you to feel pressured by me." Dean said sincerely, as he tried to explain. "I really... it would kill me if you did something you weren't comfortable with just because you like me. I'm serious. I mean, throw me off of you whenever, and I'll listen."
"I promise I'll listen to you whenever you need to talk. I'll be cool and open minded and not an asshole like before."
Jack pushed the car door open and started to sprint.
"Maybe I can help." Jack walked up to Meta, sitting beside them on the big pink couch. The boy smiled, raising a hand in greeting, "Hello."
The angel sent Dean a stern glare.
Castiel fondly remembered the kitchen in the bunker. It's his one of his favorite spots. Dean would walk into the kitchen all sleepy and cute in his robe and slippers. His hair would be a fuzzy blonde mess, eyes still blinking awake. He'd pour himself a mug from the pot Cas brewed. Then they'd sit together and breathe in the morning. Dean would smile, pretty lips turning up as he thanks him for the coffee. Sometimes he calls Cas "sunshine", and it lights the angel up from the inside.
Mashing on the buttons and steering the joystick, Dean let out a loud battle cry.
Castiel replied quietly, "Chuck."
Billie lifted her scythe once more, banging it into the wall. "Eat gravedust, you metaphysical monster! Empty, now!"
Dean wiggled his eyebrows, "Never said it was one."
The record played on in the background as Dean stared into his angel's eyes. They stood in each other's arms, looking only at each other. Dean knocked back his glass of whiskey. He set Cas's on the bedside table and turned back to the angel, grabbing him by his elbow. Dean tugged Cas in. He wrapped his arms around his shoulders, fingers playing in Cas's dark curls as the angel took his waist. Dean said softly, "May I have this dance?"
Sam waved Jack over, "Yeah. Let's go load up the car. Come on kid."
Jack nodded, smiling tentatively as he walked into the room. He wasn't entirely comfortable yet. Dean remembered Castiel's words from last night. Jack looks to him. They may have spoken on the phone but this is the first Dean has seen of him since he ran away from the kitchen yesterday. Jack needs reassurance that everything is alright. And that's Dean's job to honor his word and provide the peace he promised.
"Did I just catch you staring at my ass?"
The box opened itself, inside was a small red stone. It was dull and dirty, surrounded by what looked to be green and blue marbles. Dean peered over it, glancing into the box, "Huh. That's it?"
Jack asked, "What does it say?"
"Gross."
"Fine?"
"Do you?" Sam started to laugh, mocking Dean in a fake flirtatious voice, "I'll beat him up just
Sam butted in, "Guys, come on. I get that you two are honeymooning or whatever, but this is the end of the world. We need to see some hustle--"
Dean glanced up, pretty green eyes flicking up toward the angel as he laughed aloud, "You're a good father."
Around the time Jack died, they were all at each other's throats. Turns out, their love could weather any storm Chuck wrote for them. Including the last three years. Look at em now. They had all patched things up and gotten closure while Jack waited in the Empty, and they finally felt like a united front again. So, Dean used their bond to guide how he moved forward. Regarding Jack, Dean let him stay because of Castiel. Cas didn't talk to Dean at all before bringing Jack home, but Dean took one look at them and gave the angel what he desired.
. I have dignity."
"Good." Castiel replied.
Including Jack.
Dean sighed dramatically, zipping his jeans back up. "About what?"
Jack started to smile as he scrubbed a plate, feathers drifting down his back, "Once again. I want the Spiderman game, Apex, Red Dead--"
Billie walked over to the group from where she had been watching them spellcast from a safe corner of the bar. As she approached, she reached into her obsidian cloak and pulled out a long shining feather from her cloak, "One of the first feathers fallen on the day of his rebirth. It's stronger than the ones they brought. And much more powerful."
Castiel rushed, "Yes! Yes, Dean. I'd like to try that."
"Dean, you on the other hand, seem like you're still the Dean Winchester I know and love. Still kicking, shooting, and making monsters eat it. Still... fighting me. Like I knew you would." Chuck winked. "It's cute. That you think you'll win. It's cute. And I hope you keep being cute. Because the second I get sick of you, I am going to flick you so hard off the game board that your body shoots through the stratosphere. Consider this a warning. Keep your hands off of that angel."
Dean made a serious face, hard eyes and firm lips speaking more than words ever could.
Several meters before the bar top table, Chuck stood frozen. He stopped walking, blinking, breathing. Chuck gritted his teeth. "Where are my powers?"
Dean ran his hand up the angel's firm chest, eyes a little hazy as he took in the look. "If you dressed like this every day, I'd never stop kissing you."
"Hell yeah." Dean took the other doorknob and they opened the pantry to reveal a hidden bedroom. Warm wooden floors, a fireplace, faux sheepskin rugs. Plants hung from the ceiling in glass pots cradled with rope. Eucalyptus, vines, succulents, ivy, and magnolia. Stacks of records were in four shelves in the corner, a classic record player at the ready. A warm, tanned velvet upholstered armchair sat across from a king sized bed with strong metal framing, black silk sheets, and cozy pillows. Mounted on the brick walls was a television and several floating wooden shelves, clothes were folded neatly on each shelf.
"Dammit, Cas, look at what you're doin' to me." Dean glanced to the living room to see Jack and Sam still distracted. They were. He tugged Cas back in for a long, warm kiss. Hands at the back of his neck, and fingers in those soft dark curls, Dean bit his lip a bit. Castiel let out this deep, quiet growl, kissing him hard. The angel's large hands wandered down his back to rest on Dean's firm ass with a light grip. Cas squeezed at the tender human body under his hands and breathed out a sigh.
Sam grinned, lifting his spell book. "We're proud of who we are. We're proud of the things you tried our whole lives to make us ashamed of. I'll admit it. I study high witchcraft! I'm a witch. A damn good one. My son is the most powerful supernatural creature in the world, and we are proud of him for who he is. Castiel is more human than any angel you've ever made. My brother is in love with the one who saved him when I couldn't -- true love that he deserves. Try as you might, none of us would give up this life. Ever."
Castiel replied, "Chuck is connected to the Book of the Damned. He wrote the spells, they draw from his power. We've basically been feeding him our location for the past day."
Chuck shook his head, "Oh, can it, Winchester. I don't care about homosexuality. I know you've been using The Book."
Dean was worried about letting him in. He approached Jack warily, if at all. Mainly talking to him through Castiel who passed on to Jack when it was time for a family meal. Dean was confident that he could at least do that. After all they'd been through together, he still wanted to make sure Jack ate well.
Sam cackled from his room.
"Bring it, geezer." Jack tilted his head, challengingly.
"I know a nice place we can park the car. There's this lake just inside a forest, it's pretty quiet. Is that cool?"
Dean whined, "In a minute."
would happen. Especially so fast.
Sam hung his head. "Oh, god."
"I'm not making fun. Here, let me fix this..." Castiel reminded, leaning over to straighten Dean's sleep wrinkled collar, "And, I can. Boil hot dogs, I mean."
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE PUSHED FOR THIS. DANGER AWAITS. DEATH IS IMMINENT.
Sam shrugged, patting his knees, "Looks like you got a promotion."
Sam glared up at Dean from his laptop. "I did hear how it went. That's kind of the problem."
"No, you didn't." Cas promised, "I'm okay with the other two. But, I'm too strong to be playing with your neck like that. I don't want to accidentally kill you."
Amara tapped her foot, biting her lip in consideration, "You're kidding. I mean, I have to cancel, right? It's the end of the world. No! No. I can't. How's Saturday?"
Dean grumbled, "Okay, Erykah Badu. How about you Erykah Ba-don't?"
are."
"I just wanna be a normal kid." Jack sniffed sorrowfully, dino head flopping over his shoulders. "But, I can't. Not really. Even though I do big things, I'm not big. I feel like I'm lying. Every day. I don't wanna be big anymore."
The door creaked open and Dean raised his gun at it.
Chuck screamed. "No!!"
The hunter took Castiel's hand as he looked down into the rainy sky. "I don't like heights much."
Castiel rubbed his temple, sighing deeply, "Jack. I'll give you your space. But, some things are too complicated... the bond between Dean and I has been tested more than you could possibly imagine. The ways in which we've hurt each other would break your heart. And when I saw the Empty yesterday, we spoke. It's watching, Jack. If for some inane reason Dean feels the same way I do, sharing my feelings with him could have consequences. We're in war. I can't afford to make that sacrifice. And we can't afford to lose a soldier."
Dean smiled brighter, striding toward him with a grin, "Whoa. You're really cool, man."
Castiel sighed, "I've never had to find a
"Oh, no no. Cas. There's no
"Yes, I did."
Cas turned to look at the door.
Dean pulled his face back to his, kissing him harder, "Uh uh. Get back here."
"Yes, sir!" The hunter scrambled to obey the order. He rushed through the bedroom, socked feet racing over the carpet until he reached the edge of the bed. He sat down on the black silk sheets and smiled to himself. They screwed all morning, but it's been a couple hours and he's had breakfast, so he's down to go again. Dean looked up at Cas with big green eyes, awaiting his next demand.
"Something. Smells. Awesome." Sam bounded into the kitchen, steps loud and big as he took up space in the room. The hunter admired the table and walked up to it with hunger in his eyes. He'd thankfully showered. He smelled nice. Dean let out a sniff. Hmm. Dean glared his patented big brother glare. Probably missed that spot behind his ears. He always does.
"Fuck."
helped Chuck turn me into the Mark! What's worse, she voted to stick me on Lucifer
"Sam." Dean said, sipping from a piping hot paper cup of coffee while leaning on the door of the Impala. It was pretty dark out still. Around 5 in the morning. He shrugged, breath puffing out air in the cold, "We appreciate you scoring Metatron for us, we really do. But, now Jack's exposed a-and Chuck is watching our asses like Joe Goldberg. It's only a matter of time before he drops from the ceiling and kills one of us because we're not following his stupid storyline."
"Years of online therapy, and I still struggle. Thanks for noticing." Sam rolled his eyes, "Know what you're making for dinner yet?"
talking about something. Cas couldn't focus. About five minutes in, Dean turned around, "Hey?"
The maid laughed, "I'm not your boss. Do what you want."
"I'm just thinking." Sam said with his big puppy eyes out. "That's all."
Castiel answered sternly, "He's not. Sam loves you very much Jack. He doesn't want you to suffer, he just wants to be your father again."
Dean chuckled, feeling Cas's arms wind tighter around his waist as he rubbed their noses together, "If twenty hunters and my brother weren't summoning Death in my living room, I'd let you do it again right now."
Chuck spat out. "Fuck you, you're not killing me. You can't. I forbid it."
Dean shrugged, "You're doing an awful lot of spell casting lately. And now we find out you've been using the Book behind our backs? For years? I'm just saying. Hogwarts is calling. You gonna answer?"
Castiel asked, "Pardon?"
"Aye. Let's get 'er started, shall we?" Rowena glaced at Sam. Sam nodded firmly, clearing his throat. An electric purple light poured from Rowena's glowing eyes and hands, while she began chanting calmly in Latin. Sam stood at a safe distance with a spell book, voice strong and steady as he joined in and matched her volume. The combined power of their joint chanting heightened the strength of the spell as the light in Rowena began to pour out of her like an aura, brightening up the room in a purple haze surrounding her. Rowena raised her hands high, vocalizing louder as Sam watched her with awe, still spellcasting. She spared a glance at him and Sam winked back, without missing a word.
Dean closed his eyes, snuggling back into the angel. "So cozy."
Dean breathed, "Fuck, man."
Castiel asked, sitting up in bed, "What do you want from us?"
Dean asked, "If we had been good at our job, he wouldn't have so many sins to cry about."
Dean, Castiel, Sam, and Jack stood outside the top floor hotel room. A large 1601 was printed on the door beside it in solid gold. Sam swiped the card at the doorknob and it unlocked. They opened the door, walking in to a short hallway and a cavernous living room. There were large windows were barely covered by soft neutral curtains, marble floors, expensive rugs, and a chandelier hanging from the ceiling. Beside the far window there was a small cluster of 80's era arcade games. A long glass table stretched out across the room, books were strewn stylishly on the left side of it. Beside the table was a fireplace, and on the other side a few large armchairs and a loveseat.
"Possible kickback from The Book of the Damned?
Dean beamed, shrugging. He didn't care. It's not really about the doughnuts anymore. It's about love. New love. Strong, hot, bursting love. Butterflies in his stomach made his heart beat like a drum. Dean gazed across the Pizza Hut counter with an arm full of bread, holding Cas's eyes like a longing touch.
"Since fuck you." Dean folded his arms. "That's when."
"Right?" Sam swiftly stepped out of the room. There was another room on the other end of the living room. Sam crossed it quickly, ripping open the door. There was a hulking bookshelf built into the wall, a bridge of books arching over the king sized bed right in the center. Soft white cotton sheets, boxes of old scrolls and texts piled up in the corner. The room had a black ceiling, a photorealistic image of the milky way floating and twinkling down at them. It was actually moving. A large wooden desk and leather chair sat against a wall with an old, dated Windows computer from the early 2000's.
by Aerosmith came on the radio and Dean cried so hard he had to pull over."
"Yeah! I wanna know what's up there!" Jack jumped, pointing up at the winding black metal staircase that lead to a dark square in the ceiling.  Dean folded his arms, "I think Amara may have done a little renovating. Let's check it out."
"Hey, dad." Jack floated over to them, sneakered feet hovering over the ground.
Chuck nodded at the screen. "All that chaos. All that rage and entitlement. You took my job. You wanted change, and you demanded your way, and started a war because you wanted the throne all to yourself. Power-hungry little twit. Then, you got in too deep. Had your back against a couple thousand walls while standing across the most powerful adversaries you've ever had." Chuck laughed, "And, just like that, sweet little heart of gold Castiel went dark. You started working with a demon! You took in more power than you could handle! You ended Raphael by simply wishing him dead! And then you went to Heaven and started killing as many angels as you could find. You were such a beautiful monster, all twisted pride and bloodlust. But, you hated yourself. I never really got why. Then you crawled back to your boy toy, and he made you give up the souls. Shame. I wanted to see a supernova. And, all I got was stupid leviathans.
Dean frowned, "Are you sure? You looked pretty broken up, bud."
Sam winced, "Ouch?"
. They wanted to pack up quickly and efficiently because Chuck had Jack's location. They had to scoot. Seriously. So, Castiel gave Dean "one last kiss" and pulled him up from the floor to get going. But every time they separated for more than a minute or so, they ended up all over each other again. Once they'd crossed that line, Dean and Castiel couldn't get enough of it. They kissed on the wall. The desk. The bed. The fridge. The kitchenette counter. The closet door, ironically.
Dean looked at him through the mirror, cheeks and neck burning as he started the car, "No, drop it. We're going home."
"Yes, they're almost done setting up their spell about a mile up the road. I double checked their room's warding too. It's secure."
"Jerk." Sam answered, turning and taking the water with him, "I'll tell Jack to let you finish breakfast. Thanks for making the food, guys. I'm gonna go take a shower."
Dean gave him a strong look, "Give. Me. The bowl. You're on potato duty now."
"Of course. It's on page 32 of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz in the upper right corner."
"Shut up, Sam. You put us in danger twice today. Is it that crazy to believe you're on thin ice with me?" Dean said harshly, pointing at Sam over the open trunk. He avoided Sam's eyes and grabbed the car door handle.
Jack looked absolutely devastated. His face fell, chin drooping as he breathed out, "But, Dad, you deserve--"
Within a few minutes, he got Jack sat up and munching on the bed. The young boy chewed merrily on Dean's BLT, crumbs sprinkled over his round cheeks. Castiel patted his head, "Don't forget your tea, little one."
Castiel patted Dean's foot over the quilt. "You're welcome, baby."
Amara winked, "Come on, Bill. It can't be all heart attacks all the time."
Cas shrugged. Their kid is right, but Jack's charges against Dean were all dismissed by Castiel's court because the man is cute.
He couldn't love this too much.
Cas was getting all the smiles he could possibly want, but their wires are crossing. It was causing him complete and utter confusion at the same time. Regardless of the situation, the Pizza Man looked
Dean yelled through his back pain, "Stop talking to him like that!"
Dean grinned, pushing Cas boyishly. "Hell yeah. There's really only two rules: foreplay and enthusiastic consent. If we're not having foreplay, we're not having sex. If both of us aren't horned up and want to do it, we're not having sex. Our minds have to be into it, our bodies have to be ready for it." Dean tugged the angel down and kissed his lips, "So, we start by touching for a bit. Testing the waters." Castiel kissed him back. Dean smiled, "We explore each other and we relax into each other. We breathe into each other and focus on what we feel." Castiel ran his hands softly up Dean's chest, kissing him once more. Dean added, "Now, if you wanna take something off, you can. If you don't, that's cool too. We just have to feed off of each other's energy. When we start to get aroused from all the angel-on-human action, we can focus on those spots a bit more. If you want to go that far."
Castiel and Dean gave Chuck a disgusted look as they sat in bed together.
Castiel replied, "I have a lot to atone for in life. And, the Empty will make sure I pay for that. Possibly sooner rather than later. And, I should have... I should have spoken up. About so many things, there's so much I kept in, and being met with the brevity of life, the death of my son, the death of this world, Dean. I keep putting things off for time we no longer have. I could lose you tomorrow, and I know I won't survive that."
Dean suggested, "So... do you want to... help us fight him?"
Meta added, "I go by Meta now."
Jack munched on an apple slice. "That was sick, dude."
"Hunky handmaidens?" Amara asked with intrigue.
Amara reached over and patted Cas's knee. "Don't you worry, angel. It'll just take a moment. The Empty's terrified of me. Actually. You know what. Billie?"
Castiel sighed, stabbing the sausage with his fork. "Considering he made my life a living Hell, stole my grace, orchestrated the Great Fall in my name, and
Castiel had just finished painting the last sigil when there was a sudden violent booming sound coming from the double doors. Someone was banging on it full force. Jack looked up at his fathers nervously. Dean placed his hand on Jack's shoulder, steadying him. He watched the boy's chin lift. The doors shuddered and creaked under the violent knocking. Jack shook with every brutal bang. Dean leaned down and whispered, "Trust yourself. You can do this, kid. We got the rest."
like home. They were sure of it, not that they could see anything yet.
The rain poured outside, fire lighting up the road with a warm orange light. Cas nuzzled his nose into Dean's neck, kissing him right there. "Goodnight, Dean."
Dean let out one of those moans Sam warned him about, body going tight under Cas's hands and then immediately relaxing. Dean gasped, "Holy shit, Cas, you spanked me!"
"So, take these and don't bother me for two days, kay?" Amara flicked her wrist casually, four key cards appearing in her gentle hands. She smiled, "1601."
"Sure, call them. Me and Rowena have dinner plans."
Amara winked and placed her pointer finger over her lips. As Dean's jaw dropped at the idea of Amara speaking to someone that iconic over fucking brunch.
Sam asked patiently, "It's still early. Do you want me to take Jack bowling? After dinner tonight?"
Cas leaned over onto his knees, "Do you want me to leave you two alone?"
Why can't he just be more like Sam?
Dean waved Jack into the kitchen, "Hey. Morning, buddy. You hungry?"
Dean asked, "Can you take my waist?"
"Good luck."
Cas folded his arms and sighed, "If I agree to your terms, will you put this to rest already?"
Cas bowed his head, "Dean--"
"The sexual situations I've had in the past have been suboptimal. I felt like I was doing it because... I should. Not because I desired sex or cared for them. My body felt nice at times, but I was ultimately detached from it. Sex is confusing. I had to do a lot of guessing. I didn't like that much. I wasn't raised with this around me. I've seen it, I understand why it exists. But suddenly having a human body after being alive for thousands of years is jarring. Sex is something I experience in a way that you won't understand, and I cannot possibly explain it." Castiel said honestly, "I don't think I'll ever be fully connected to it. And Chuck was right. Human sexuality wasn't made for me to enjoy."
Dean shook his head, "Now, you take that coat off. It's gooey and gross."
Cas let out a rare smile, lips raising just a bit at the corner, "Again. So, it's this easy. Talking. Just saying it."
"Full disclosure?" Dean panted out.
His heart pounded in his chest, palms growing sweaty as he swallowed around the lump in his throat. Dean looked at Cas again, desperately. The angel was still staring out of the window, cool, calm, collected. The sun continued to rise, lighting up Castiel's strongly angled profile. The sun always sits so nice on him, skin glowing with a warm healthy tan. Sun beams seemed to fit around his dark curls like a little halo. He's a Heavenly warrior. Jimmy Page yelled and rocked out...
There was this beautiful, peaceful softness between them since Dean's prayer in Purgatory. Cas was hurt by the events leading up to their split, more than he had let on. He must have been thinking about leaving for a very long time. Dean wasn't loving or caring or kind. Nowhere felt like home anymore. Not the Impala or the bunker. That feeling came from his family. And Cas and Jack are family. Pushing them away, knocked his whole life off balance. Hurting them felt like hell. Castiel knew how he wanted to be treated, and at the end of the day he didn't love Dean any less. He just wanted a big fat wet "I'm sorry". He deserved it and Dean owed him that. So, Dean confessed his guilt and promised to do better. He cried. He hated himself for getting so honest with Cas, so emotional. He almost said too much -- like, never go again, I'll hold you every night, I love you, Castiel. After the prayer, things between them were healing. Cas held him and forgave him and walked back into his life with no question. On some level, they need each other. Dean's sure of it.
Castiel held Dean's hand a bit tighter. "Jack could get in and out easily. He could let us into the building through a side door. Metatron's never seen him before, so he's our best choice to lead. Chuck knows Jack's alive. Now, he can use his powers as he likes. Jack could even teleport if he wanted."
A smile burned through Dean's blushing cheeks as he ruminated over it in the car. He pushed it down before it could bloom.
That worked perfectly for them. As they talked out the particulars, Dean and Castiel sat firmly beside each other as friends. They weren't ready to tell their son they were seeing each other yet. But that didn't stop them from playing footsie under the booth like a pair of teenagers. Sam growled over his coffee, rubbing his shin. There's nothing more destructive than two men over six feet tall playing footsie in work boots. They missed each other twice.
Jack called from the bunker door, hands full of rocks and shredded maps, "Why are you still holding hands? The spell's done."
Jack gasped at the sheer amount, "Holy shit!"
Billie did a thumbs up from the corner.
Jack grinned, "Thanks, Dean!"
Dean paused and gathered himself, "Look, I can't physically get breakfast done by 8 without at least a little help. Sam's been going all P90X every morning, so he's out of the question and it absolutely pains me to ask you because... you know... you're you." Dean sighed, pinching at the bridge of his nose in stress, "But, since I'm giving out second chances and lollipops today, I'm gonna need you to sous chef. You up for that?"
Dean laughed, "Rebel."
Dean scoffed, "In a place like that, who would be?"
Cas's eyes went to the door and he stated, "We should talk to him, it seems urgent."
Dean grinned, softly nodding his head with positive energy.
Dean warned, "Nononono, that's way too much--"
That's how Castiel ended up in the middle of a wheat field, on top of the Impala's hood, gazing at the stars beside the Righteous Man.
. His smile was wide and bright, and it made everything in the room feel lighter. He's clearly doing something right. So, Castiel continued showing the sweets, hoping his good customer service would yield him more face time with the handsome pizza man.
Castiel kept grating the potatoes refusing to look up from them, "You should focus on your pancakes. I'll let you know when I'm done. Wouldn't want any drool in the hash browns."
"Damn right you are. You're a genius."
Cas cocked his head to the side in confusion, still just as feathered and literal as he's ever been. Dean's heart bumped against his chest wall as he cleared his throat. His head was bowed to hide his blush as he shuffled up from the dirty ground.
Sam, Dean, Castiel, Jack, and Meta all looked to the strong, calm deity before them. Amara announced, "With the power vested in me, Amara the god of Darkness and Billie the harbinger of Death, the angel Castiel is hearby freed." Cas pressed a hand to his chest. He felt like collapsing to the floor and worshipping at her feet. Dean held tightly onto Castiel's hand. Amara continued, booming out as the rift sealed neatly into the wall. "The chains binding his grace to the metaphysical forces of the Empty have been ground into dust and are no more. So say, I."
Dean struggled out, hand on his chest below his ribs, "Chuck knows where we're going. It's that damn book, Sam. I fucking told you."
"I have six dollars and a shiny rock." Jack had reached out his hand to shake on it. "Let's make a deal."
Lunch finally came. Sam ordered a grilled shrimp salad with avocado vinagrette. Dean and Castiel both ordered cheeseburgers and fries. Jack just wanted pancakes. Sam made him order a fruit cup and some carrots. The nephil boy was enthusiastic about the fruit cup. The carrots, not so much.
Castiel squinted in confusion, "I'm. Not. A... bargaining chip? I matter."
Castiel blinked, "Um... apocalyptic."
Dean waved at the empty space in front of him. "Yeah, and my son and boyfriend!
"Oh, we'll make up alright." Dean winked, leaning in to press a soft kiss for Cas's lips. "So, about this date?"
"It is done."
"Okay, okay. I'm coming." Dean adjusted his apron. "I'm gonna be flirting with those sorority girls too though. Just so ya know."
Castiel spoke up, "We've got some powerful players on our side. Plans. Weapons. Death has agreed to help. As well as the Empty--"
Castiel is resolutely not a
Dean scoffed, "Oh, please. I'll kick his feathery ass."
He watched the angel patiently for any cues. How should he move forward with him. What does he say? They kissed a few minutes ago. Dean glanced at Castiel's lips. He wants to kiss him again. But he can't. He wished and wished for it while he felt himself zone out, looking at his angel.
"Good luck."
Jack sighed loudly. "Am I getting a PS4?"
"That makes sense. You've banned me from using the stove. For life. Quite dramatic if you ask me."
"You're kinda right."
Dean patted Chuck's shoulder. "You want to write stories all day? Fine. Write here. Forever. Just... leave us all alone."
Jack raised an eyebrow, "Seriously? He is?"
"Glad you two are set. While you and the kid get situated, me and Cas are gonna go find mine." Dean elbowed the angel out of his brother's room.
Castiel scoffed, "I don't know about that. He's seen more in the first three years of his life than anyone should in all their days. I just wish I could have protected him better."
Dean shook his head and set the glass down, "Cas, don't."
Dean took Jack's small hand in his. The boy was shivering. Dean rubbed his thumb against the back of Jack's little shaky knuckles. "It's gonna be okay. We're gonna kick it in the ass." That didn't seem to reassure the boy much, but Dean noticed a feather or two falling from his back. They'll look out for him. Cas squeezed Dean's hand on the other side, a strong and steady contrast to Jack's nerves. Dean snuck a look at him. Standing stoic in his ever-present trench, the angel's calm energy centered them all.
Dean wiggled his shoulders with excitement, "Wow. The Winchester Family Summer Vacation. Has a nice ring to it."
"Sam Winchester. The jolly green giant. I knew you wouldn't be too far away." Meta laughed, nodding at Jack. "Him, I don't know. Goodness. You look familiar. Wait a second." Meta glanced between Dean and Castiel for a moment, gasping. "Don't tell me."
Being stern was imperative. It was everything. A method of survival.
The papers added below.
Dean whistled. "I'll say."
A long golden rip appeared in the fabric of the universe right in front of the empty lot where the abandoned Del Taco was. The rift pulsed and throbbed. Dean and Sam ran over to it as Billie walked out of the rift with her scythe on her back, winking at them. "Sup?"
Castiel started to smile up at Dean again, chuckling and patting his chest knowingly.
"No, you don't." Castiel said knowingly. He looked back, asking, "Have you thought of what you want to say to Jack yet?"
"What about you? You're not his son. You don't need food, and it's not like he has to take care of you. Aren't you like a million years old or something?"
"Aye." Rowena winked. "You should see what I've done with the place. We redecorated, hired a gardener, formed a demonic army of spellcasting women. Ah! They put the Winchesters to shame. Come to think about it, so do the hunky handmaidens I just acquired."
Meta finished, "He had a tantrum, and while he's been gone he's been killing off his other universes. Now he's trying to kill our world too. They needed my expertise. For the good of the planet. For our survival and the betterment of humanity. And after a rousing speech, I was delighted to assist."
, Dean said as the rain crashed down on the car,
Jack tilted his head to the side in a way that reminded Sam of his best friend Cas. The bubbles slipped off of the nephil's nose and onto his shirt, "Oh, right. You don't like those. Sorry, Dad."
Castiel opened the thick metal drawer of the tool box. He took a few handfulls of gaskets and shoved them into each coat pocket. Closing the drawer, he reached over to the hulking wooden shelf beside the tool box. It was covered in car repair equipment. Including the coolant. He grabbed the blue Peak antifreeze and turned back to the Impala.
Noticing the sweets in Castiel's hand, Dean broke out into a reflexive grin. "Aww. You shouldn't have."
Jack rinsed the soapy pot out and placed it onto a drying rack, "Nice."
"Well, Cas, that's sweet but I'm a grown man. I think I can--"
"Partner?"
Amara spoke up, "I blessed him during the spell. He'll be able to do much more than simply handle the transfer of power. He will have the chance to wield it for change on a global scale."
"Would you like to go on a date?" Castiel asked him, "Someday? With me?"
"Our son's birthday is in ten months. You bought it for you." Castiel took a sip, mulling over the taste.
Then he looked up and saw his face. The teasing smile slipped from Dean's lips. "Oh..." Castiel's eyes were unashamed, clouded with lust and intrigue as he blinked back slowly. It was devastatingly handsome on him. With each bat of his eyelashes, Dean could feel himself getting more and more excited. Dean breathed, heart beating a racket in his chest, "Cas, you're sexier than you have any right to be. And unless you want to explain to Jack what his dads are doing back here, we've been in the kitchen too long."
Dean found more or less the same on the shelves in his room. He'd cooked dinner in a pair of jeans that were absolutely criminal on him. When Dean pulled them from the shelf, he checked the tag in disbelief. He pulled out his phone and looked them up, "These jeans are six hundred American dollars, baby, what the hell?" He wore them anyway, not able to find a pair of denim on the shelf that didn't cost more than a goddamn Macintosh.
Dean's shoulder found its way against Castiel's as they admired Orion's Belt. The angel could map out all of Cassiopeia on the freckles on Dean's forearm. So, he did. Lifting the human's arm up and pulling at the sleeve, Castiel pointed at the sky. Dean watched with this warm content smile on his face.
Then, Sam laughed at them. It was all in good fun, Dean knows. He did the same to Sam when Eileen was over. But, Cas isn't a cute girl. He's a multidimensional wavelength shoved into Claire Novak's 40-year-old dad. Sam's laugh was genuine, but not cruel. He teases because he loves them both. Every now and then, Sam whispers the theme song to "Touched By an Angel" at Dean, cackling like a hyena as his big brother slaps at him with heavy hands.
Billie strode over to the table slowly, glaring at the meal as she glared at the items. When she reached it, she scoffed at the stack of extra pancakes in the middle of the table made from Cas's excessive batch of batter. "Hmm. That's a lot of sugar."
He kissed him so hard. So
Cas continued. "But, some things we must do because society demands it. I'm an angel, but to the outside world, I walk the Earth as a man. Sam and Dean hunt, but they portray themselves a certain way to keep peace and community. You will always be our little boy, you know that. And we don't expect you to be a different person. But we do need you to wear grown up clothes around others because your duality may confuse them."
Castiel rubbed the kid's back, "We love you too."
Castiel leaned into Dean, letting the hunter wrap his arm around his shoulders as he sat up close beside him. "Mate? I thought we'd do the boyfriend thing first, but we can start there I guess."
"I will be loyal and... and
Dean started to smile, the sun rising in his face while it rained outside. "Are you sure, Cas? I'm kinda rough around the edges. Might stick out."
Dean winced, "We don't need the details, just tell us where the room is and we'll be outta your hair."
to fix. This part is written all wrong." Chuck pointed between the two of them, "Angels and humans. Mating. I mean, come on. Look at each other. Look!"
Cas rolled his eyes, "You've been praying to me for hours, but I can't hear any of your words. It's just been a loud jumble of yelling and strange noises, what do you want to tell me?"
"I didn't have sex with her husband, Dean." Castiel answered flatly.
The angel leaned into Dean's space, brushing their noses before kissing his human's forehead and lips once each. He gazed into Dean's eyes and confessed. "I adore you, Dean Winchester."
"Nothing's wrong. This just... this reminds me of something from a couple of Dr. Sexy episodes." Dean blushed, gesturing with his hands, "Two hot uniforms in a workplace setting get a moment alone in an elevator. One thing leads to another and..."
Castiel poked his shoulder knowingly. "Want to turn it into a game?"
"I have a thing for strong men with deep voices and healing hands." Dean let out a simmering sigh of arousal. "Grab whatever you want. Whenever you want. As hard as you want."
Dean let out a shy smile, taking the room cards from Amara. He cleared his throat, "Ahem. Thank you, Amara. That means a lot."
. That's all the time it took for that naive, wide eyed, horny angel to ruin everything.
"I mean, I was thinking about it -- but only to myself."
when a cougar plays with it's prey."
Castiel nodded.
Jack smiled, "Thank you!"
Rowena shrugged. "Oh, nothing, dear. Just the strongest
Castiel looked and acted more or less like he usually does, successfully playing the role of a disinterested angel. Dean on the other hand was a hopeless lovestruck buffoon. He blushed constantly. Dean stammered over his speech and touched Castiel's arm and gazed over at the angel, hanging onto his every word. Probably doesn't even know he's doing it. Sam took another sip of coffee. That's his brother.
Shoving the key into Cas's pocket, Dean looked up from under him, "That, I love you. And I'm
Dean sighed, "I know, it's just... sex with you is very hard to talk about."
"YOU'RE NOT FUCKING LEAVING ME, YOU SON OF A BITCH!" Dean screamed, summoning all of his endurance to keep running. His hand was tight and firm against Cas's, dragging the angel along until he started to run again. Dean yelled out as his legs ached from the pressure. They gripped on to each other tightly, using each other's strength to push them to the finish line.
Dean crouched by his side, shoulders hunched with grief as he wrapped an arm around Cas and patted him. They sat and watched Jack crumble. As his small hand grew smoky and black, Cas fell into Dean's chest and looked away. Dean wrapped his arms around him tighter, at a loss for words. Too much had happened. He was overwhelmed.
Sam shook his head. "Probably not a good idea to hang out in there. Let's wait here. Come on, kiddo, stop bouncing. Off the couch. And why are you wearing sunglasses inside? What's all that stuck to your ear? C'mere."
"Let's see what we got." Dean said as he turned to Castiel, looking into Castiel's hands and checking the gaskets, "Yeah, the bigger one in your left hand with the T on it. That'll be her."
Jack spoke up, "Billie said Megatron's seen it. Sounds cool. You think if we find him, we'll find some other Transformers too?" The boy gasped in realization, "Maybe there will be a monster truck Transformer. That would be awesome."
Castiel didn't answer.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Yes."
So, now, he's back. And broken. Barely alive, but tasked with killing his grandfather. And he still can't get the taste of raw hearts out of his mouth. Even now.
DIDN'T HE ALREADY KILL YOU? PUNK BITCH.
Castiel looked at his socked feet. "I won't be very good."
Castiel tilted his head, "Interesting."
"Fuck, I didn't want to tell you this so quick... didn't wanna freak you out." Dean worried, eyes still shut as he breathed out heavily. "Maybe we should keep it chill tonight."
Sam complained. "No."
Now that they have time, he's fixing the Impala. Heck, even better, he's letting Cas watch. And, boy! What a sight to behold. If any angel asked Castiel what the most beautiful image he's ever seen on Earth was, he would say: Dean Winchester, sans flannel, bent over the hood of his car.
Jack raised his fork as he chewed on his eggs, plate already half empty, "Dean?"
Dean felt the question pour out of him, "What's wrong?" The angel's chest heaved with increased breath. He's stressed out still, somehow. Dean took his face in his hands, "Hey. Hey, baby, is something going on?"
"I won't, baby."
Jack whined, shaking his head and complaining, "Ugh! Kill me."
"Where? In Diagon Alley with the rest of your witch friends?"
crackled out as the needle scratched out a steady 60's bass. Cas closed the double doors behind Dean's bedroom, carrying two tumblers with a fifth of whiskey in each. The hunter gave Castiel a look of confusion as he handed him a glass. He took a sniff and a small sip, eyes widening. "Holy shit. Is this Blue label Johnnie Walker? Melted butter isn't even this smooth."
"That implies you're a lady."
Amara lifted her chin with pride. She reached over to pinch his cheek. "Ah! What a beautiful boy. How could he hurt you? He's a monster. He ever bothers you again, call Auntie Amara. I'll straighten him out, okay?"
Dean hurried over across the burgundy carpet and ornately painted walls and furnishings in the hallway to pick up three Hermés shopping bags. He was easily holding at least $26,000 worth of shit in here and it wasn't even heavy. She leaned in and tapped him on the nose with a delicate manicured finger, "I like your hustle. Be careful with those, there's a jacket in there that costs more than your life."
Castiel blinked. "I understand that means something to you."
Castiel said, "No."
Sam started to smile, "Cas, are you kidding? He'd love it."
Castiel noted the positivity of the situation. His son is feeling a bit better. Still very broken up, but he knows he has the love of his parents now. The cracks and wounds in his soul have been healing bit by bit. When Jack grows to understand and love himself, he will realize that things will be okay. Until then, he has his fathers.
He's doing something. Oh, no. Not this. Cas hates this. Why is Dean doing this?
He felt nothing. He was nothing. Just a blank slate with memories he can't connect to and more power than anyone could handle. Any emotion was foreign to him -- a hot scalding reminder of what he lost.
It's the end of the world. Well and truly. And, Dean's the type to play that card, but when the chips are down and it's the bottom of the ninth, an 11th hour soul hook up isn't really his top priority. Tonight is no exception. But, the finality of it all. Looking Chuck in his cold, careless eyes as he cast their world aside. They have three weeks, a month tops before it's all a barren wasteland and their home becomes another dream walker's Bad Place.
Sam closed the spell book, passing it back to Rowena. "What did we all just cast?"
Jack stared flatly at his dad, "Seriously?"
Castiel pointed to blueberry cake doughnuts, lemon filled glazed doughnuts, caramel apple doughnuts, until he'd offered Dean everything they had. It took a few minutes but Dean wouldn't mind if it took all day. Cas's sleeves were rolled up, pointing to each donut in the display case with the tannest, strongest looking forearms Dean had ever seen. Dean wanted him so bad he could just rip his Pizza Hut hat off and quit on the spot. Dean's coworker noticed him standing and staring at the sweet side of the store, elbowing him for some support on the line.
. He wants them all. Right now.
"Good." Dean smiled.
for thousands of years and created a soul bomb big enough to destroy me when I resurfaced. If Lucifer hadn't spread me to Cain for shits and giggles, I wouldn't even be here right now. I don't trust her."
"Castiel." Dean stated warily. "What's wrong? What did you do?"
The hunter suddenly stammered out into the phone, "Uh, yeah! Yeah, Jack. I'm still here, buddy. Go on." Dean nodded along to the boy, still watching his angel. Castiel rubbed his thumb along the back of his hand, encouraging the communication.
"How... are you...
"Jack, Dean has a lot of stuff going on internally. Tends to keep things inside for what feels like forever. How he feels about Cas is one of those things he locks up about. Is it unhealthy? Yes. But, that's why I thought we'd have more time."
Castiel shook his head, inviting the younger Winchester into the room. Sam walked in quietly, dropping off the sandwiches and hot drink on the bedside table. Jack didn't make a sound. Castiel respected his wishes and let Sam place the food down without a fuss.
Dean swiped his hand back to push at Cas, "Oh, shut it, you. We are completely identical."
Dean grumbled quietly into the fabric of Cas's coat. "Well, it was a chick flick moment. And I don't do those, my love."
Billie started to stand, hand gripping her scythe. She gritted her teeth at the sound of the doors rattling. After a moment of fumbling with the door knob, the doors finally pushed open revealing the Winchester family armored up with tan and green canvas sacks on their backs. Jack held up his hand, grinning broadly. "Hello."
Dean stopped kissing his neck. He looked up at Cas in disbelief. "You wanna take
Billie answered. "Yes, Amara?"
Dean licked his lower lip before biting it, picturing Castiel as a girl as best he could. In his mind, of course, he made a few embellishments -- most of them vaguely pornographic. "That's hot."
"...yeah."
Chuck howled with pain. He sunk his hand into the floor, curls spilling over his face as he continued to hiss out. "I wouldn't be so sure about that. Angels, demons, monsters, humans... you cast a blank stare at all of them. No matter how hard they vie for your attention. You never call the waitress, you've never swirled grace with your kind, you don't even click the sexy links on your boyfriend's computer. Cas. Come. On. Just admit it. You're broken." Chuck glanced over at Castiel's human boyfriend and winked. "And he already getting bored with you."
"Jealous?" Dean started to smile.
Castiel hung his head, "I'm so sorry, Dean."
Dean watched Castiel and their son embrace in the center of the couch. The glass table before them was littered with bowls, books, powders, and bones from the summoning spell. It now sat cold and disregarded after serving it's purpose. Castiel was still nearly frozen solid by everything going on as Jack vibrated with joy. Dean picked himself up off of the couch with a grunt as his joints cracked. He padded over to the two in the center of the couch.
Dean tightened his grip on his disposable coffee cup. He took another long sip, gazing back at the motel room through the window. Warm yellow light was streaming in through the curtain and a trenchcoated figure hovered past it. Dean's heart knocked against his chest wall. He couldn't wait to see him again...
Castiel gave Dean a worried look, "Metatron."
Castiel stated into the wheat field, "You didn't make him cry, Dean. He was buried under the weight of his sins. I thought you'd be able to relate."
"Watch this." Dean then started playing the game with an alarming amount of intensity. Castiel turned back to the dishes, smiling a bit as he dried the plate Sam handed him with a white dish. The angel said simply, "Let them have their fun. The road ahead is sure to be long. We don't have many moments like this."
Dean blinked. "You do? Oh. Well, I dunno. How much time are we talking?"
Sam finished, "--he could be anywhere."
Castiel's eyes widened. He glanced down at the shirt, and looked up at Dean, promising. "I can get more sweaters."
"Hey."
They're going to go up to the fifteenth floor two at a time. Dean and Castiel first. Fifteen minutes later, Sam and Jack come up behind them for back up. Sam's gotta escape admin and Jack needs a moment to get out of the restaurant business. According to their texts, he just made
"Yeah, whatever." Dean said, neck and ears getting redder by the moment, "Tell the kid that breakfast is at 8."
"You're welcome, baby."
Dean noticed Cas's expression change, peering closer, wishing he knew more about him. Wishing they could talk right now.
The angel stared hard at the giant wooden barrier, feeling shut out. He wished he was behind that door, enjoying the human on the other side of it. Dean would be so warm. So soft. Oh, how he'd bury himself in years of pent up forbidden emotion -- how passionately he'd get aquatinted with that memory foam with a hot blooded human in hand. Or mouth. Or whatever else goes on in the private alphabetized archives of confusing adult media that Dean refuses to let him look at. Castiel doesn't even care what Dean would ask of him. He'll do anything, no matter the depravity. He'll act like a complete dunce with no hesitation. He just wants to feel loved by the Righteous Man.
Jack started to smile, "Then it's going to be extra good."
Castiel pushed him on the leg, with a scandalized, "Dean! Behave."
"Yeah. He is." Sam looked proudly over at Jack. The little nephil stood on his tip toes as he painted a sigil next in between Cas and Dean. "And we're all gonna help him."
Jack pushed out of the hug, bouncing with excitement on the couch with his knees. "Cas is free! Cas is free! Yeah!"
Castiel crossed the living room, taking Dean's hand and leading him to the kitchen. Dean followed the angel wordlessly as Castiel guided his hunter with ease. Their fingers laced together when they passed the kitchen island and the fridge door where they'd kissed earlier. A few moments later, they stood before the closed double doors of a pantry beside the oven. Dean blinked, "Isn't this a cabinet?"
"No!" Jack sobbed and cried, sitting on his yellow transformer bed in a large green dinosaur costume. He was folding his arms and weeping. The big plush T-Rex head sagged over his hair as the nephil boy cried. "I wanna be a dinosaur."
"Okay. Fine. I'll go." Dean poked Cas's black cashmere sweater. "But, I get to pick the outfit. Because this looks really good."
Cas leaned in and kissed him again. "That sounds wonderful. I like your human lessons."
The Winchester family stood together as Cas approached Dean's side. Cas rested his hand on Dean's lower back, tilting his forehead in to tap against his shoulder. He kissed the rough space underneath Dean's jaw. The four breathed together as a family unit. No more endless monsters, no more apocalypses, no more losing the ones they love in quick succession. No more needless pain.
Jack remembered tugging Sam by the sleeve after only hours of it. In a Dodge City motel parking lot, Jack stood by the vending machine and asked if Dean was widowed the day he was born. Sam looked nervous as he pressed. Had Jack's dead father been Dean's husband? Was Dean suffering from the pain of losing his angel all this time?
Castiel looked around Dean, refusing to meet his eyes, "Nothing. It doesn't matter. Let's go."
Jack changed the green crayon to a blue one as he drew, colors transforming on the page. He laughed loudly, scribbling and changing the color again. Red. Orange. Purple. Yellow. Jack giggled. He loves being himself. He loves doing things his way. And he loves coloring. His eyes flashed gold for a second as he drew, bouncing merrily.
She lifted a thick black notebook from Billie's library with a big Alpha and Omega on it.
Amara barely blinked when she looked up from the paper and saw the living room, her assistant tied up on the couch and the rug a wrinkled mess on the floor. She pulled out a headphone. "What are you boys doing in my hotel room?"
Sam spoke up, "That's Jack's feather. We deserve to know."
"You have to show me."
"We're all getting matching Hawaiian shirts, that's non-negotiable." Dean said, energy bright and bubbly as as continued to plan their trip out loud. "Then, we'll get some cervezas, some lawn chairs, and we'll take over the beach. I bet Jack will love running around out there. Oh, man. It'll be a blast. We'll rent a house on the water so we can stretch out. Maybe bring a few fishing rods over. I can teach you a thing or two about that. If you pay attention this time, we might even be able to catch dinner."
Dean hissed from the couch next to Sam, "What--Where did you get that? I packed those in the fridge!"
"I made a deal."
Dean breathed thickly, "Do the bad boy thing. You did earlier. It was kinda hot."
Dean lowered his gun, growling out, "Do you have to give us a heart attack every time you pop in? Couldn't you call first?"
The blood red stone jumped up and down, tapping on the same point on the map. Nevada. Nevada. Nevada.
"Yeah, me and my boss." Metatron popped back up with a wine cooler in a bottle.
"No, Dean. I have... curiosities. Thoughts. Fantasies. My sexuality is in here somewhere, and you have a key to it. When I see you, something inside me stirs up. When I kiss you..." Castiel sat up on Dean's lap, running an angelic hand along his chest. "I have things I want to try. I can't imagine ruling everything out the way I would with anyone else."
Taste.
"Yeah, it's FBI, but better."
Dean finally closed his mouth, but his eyes were ripping him apart. "Depends on what your focusing on."
"No, I... it's 'iconic'." Castiel blinked again. When did he start talking about music? Actually, the real question is how long was Cas staring at Dean's butt? That has to be a new record.
"Of course."
Castiel shrugged, "That would be genetics. Lucifer's were so big and bright and golden, that he was nicknamed the Morning Star. Whenever he entered a room, it was like the sun rose in Heaven. Yours may rival his yet. You'll learn to walk with them."
Dean gasped, "Oh, shit. I'm in trouble."
"Two and three." Dean stated as Cas and Jack followed Sam's path.
"I... I made a deal. But, Dean, listen..." Castiel started to explain. Words were leaving his lips and he was making these painful expressions, but Dean couldn't hear anything anymore. He stared back at the angel in silence as Cas confessed to him. Dean felt like he'd just been shot. He didn't know he was crying until Cas was too. The angel's thumbs wiped tears from Dean's face, his healing hands leaving his skin dry. The tears in his eyes kept replacing themselves, multiplying, falling, mimicking the rain on the window glass. Cas couldn't wipe them all away.
Another loud thunderclap hit and she yelled at the window, "You're being a child, Charles!"
Dean blushed and scratched behind his neck, nodding back wordlessly. Castiel smiled back, a soft warm thing. Dean stuffed the feather into his pocket.
Amara folded her arms, "I came around eventually."
Castiel nodded, "Yes. It's a good thing. He's still young. His angelic side has been replenished by the Grigori and his human side has been reunited with his soul. Now that he's fully intact, his wings may be growing larger to accommodate."
"I know. We can choose some of them to enhance your outfit any way you like. Grown up clothes may be 'stupid', but they don't have to be boring." Castiel ran his thumb under Jack's eye, clearing the tears from his son's cheeks. "Compromise. How does that sound to you?"
Amara asked without looking up from her nails. "What? You're gonna make me what?"
Castiel tilted his head, listening.
Castiel nodded.
Meta was at the bar top table, eating one of Dean's omelettes in a navy Chanel jumpsuit. Their hair sat piled on their head in a severe top knot, diamonds dangling from their ears. "Dean, this omelette is exquisite. You made these on your own?"
out."
The angel kissed him back, holding the human still with his strong hands on his jaw. Then he pushed Dean down with a strong hand on his chest. He said sternly. "Would you rather I ask for what I want?"
Dean came back from the sorority delivery with a $20, and he knew exactly how he was gonna spend it. He walked over to the POS system and ordered a large pepperoni pie and a large cola. As soon as it was done, his shift was over. Dean clocked out and walked over to the donut shop with the steaming pie in hand.
"Is that a pancake with strawberries?"
Jack replied, "Then why won't you download Tik Tok--"
"Hey, wait, what are you doing?" Sam called loudly. "Jack!"
"No." Dean pushed a half dressed Castiel away from him, the stone still angel barely moving an inch for his efforts. Due to that, Dean basically pushed himself off of the angel towards the floor. Before he could even begin to fall, Castiel grabbed him around the waist to keep the flustered human upright and safe against his body. Dean's hands flew to Cas's chest to stabilize himself. Whoa, those are pecs under that shirt. Thick, sturdy, hot. Now, they we're holding each other -- the best thing at the worst time. Dean blushed harder, slapping Cas's hands away from his hips. He launched himself a few large steps back, "Nothing. W-we're cooking."
Jack dropped Dean's hand to walk over to Sam, he stood beside him and looked down at the map. The red stone was still tapping over Nevada. Jack looked up at Sam, practically jumping, "That was so cool! You got the room number and everything!"
Dean nodded, "Yeah. Let's get some answers and gank this mother."
The angel opened the door and pushed his way out, wiping a bit of spit from his chin. Way at the end of the hall was an open door. A lady with a pair of blue yoga pants and designer shades stood adjusting a pile of shopping bags on a large silver cart beside an open hotel room door. Dean followed Cas out of the maintenance closet, closing the door behind himself with a chuckle. He patted Castiel on the back of his neck, rubbing his shoulder.
Castiel nodded, adding with a firm tone, "Yes. His was huge."
Castiel rubbed his human's lower back. "I've been thinking it over. And, I've decided that as soon as this Chuck mess is over and we're back in Kansas, I'm taking you to dinner. You know that French place in the city? We always drive past it on our way to the interstate and I see you looking at it. I want us to go. And I want to hold your hand the whole night."
Hand in his hair and eyes shifting back to the stars above, Dean breathed out hard, eyes wet, "That I'm sorry. I'm sorry we brought him back with that Rent-A-Seraph shit spell that burned him out. I'm sorry I dragged him along with us on cases. He was way too young to have that much pressure on him. I'm sorry I let him sacrifice himself to save us. I'm sorry I fucked him over, and put him in impossible situations, a-and then rejected him while he burned away because I was too self-absorbed to see it happening. I... I tricked him, I lied, I tried to kill him." Dean muttered out, "I'm sorry he needs me."
Dean laughed loudly, putting a fork into his pancakes.
Jack nodded, "Thank you!"
Castiel took Dean's angel blade and said calmly, "Let's chat."
"..."
Castiel smiled, "Okay."
Claire.
Castiel nodded, contrition blossoming his face, "I just keep failing you."
Death stood quietly by the glass table in leather pants, steel boots, and a long black cloak. The cloak was mammoth and obsidian, trailing behind her feet, black enough to eclipse the sun. No one in this world could pull off a cloak like that, but she did. Her hood up and obstructing her face and curls as she said calmly. "Sup."
Dean took Cas by the lapel and pulled him into the hallway, "To see the stars. Is your prayer box full? Come on."
Dean held his thumb up from the floor against a wall, "Good job, buddy. I think you're officially the first man in history to fight the creator of the universe in SpongeBob jammies."
Dean reached forward and took Cas's hand. He closed his other over it, keeping them close. "I hate putting him through this, Cas. He just has to get through tomorrow."
"Nothing. It's just... Dean and Cas are in there fixing the car. Alone." Sam said, folding his arms over his chest. "Now that you're back home safe, and we have a real shot against Chuck, and they've made up... something might happen. You know? Between them. And when it does, we'll be here. Happy for em. Supportive. From several doors down the hall, so that we don't see or hear anything that would scar us for life."
Dean groaned, "Great, Cas, now he's gonna give us a speech."
Dean nodded hard, tears falling as he wept.
"Oof, you had me at the Empty! I didn't know it was awake. We haven't talked in ages." Amara shrugged, "I can pencil in a coup. No problem. Meta, do I have time to overthrow my brother mid-day Friday?"
Sam started, "It's a bit more than a fit. Chuck vowed to end everything. And he means it. We know he told you that he killed Jack, and you disagreed with that."
Dean glared at his coworker, "He's not weird. You just suck."
The door opened and a handful of seven college-age socialites piled into the elevator with them. They were loud and laughing, passing a bottle of champagne around. Dean gave them appraising looks as he pushed himself into the corner to give the girls space to spread out.
Dean groaned, "6:42? Shit. I said I'd have breakfast done by 7:30. Why did I promise the kid?"
Dean said easily. "One of these days you're gonna pull that wand out of your ass and be honest with yourself."
Cas shrugged, "Like long sighs, hisses, a lot of sadness. Confusion. I can't make heads or tails of it."
Now, with the Empty hanging over his shoulder like a grim cloud, Castiel almost fears the possibility of Dean in his life. He'd been fighting for the concept of love, families, and free will for so long. Everything is personal now. Castiel found a family where he is loved and truly belongs. He is currently fighting the most extreme case for free will in existence. But what of love?
Dean grabbed a bag of cilantro and two tomatoes, confessing seconds later. "Fine, you're right. You happy? He did. He scared me a little. I caught a glimpse of his wings right before nirvana."
. Who was Dean to stand in his way? They planned to get topside together  and they will.
Castiel dried the dishes, stating simply, "You're taking Jack out of the hotel room so that Dean and I can have sexual intercourse as vigorously as we wish to."
, Dean thought to himself. He took a step back and allowed Castiel to continue to confront his father.
Cas feel attractive. Desired.
Chuck. Killing the Winchester's son because Dean couldn't. Jack, crying out in pain as Castiel tried to save his life. Sam shooting Chuck. Chuck pronouncing their world dead. Chuck snapping his grubby little fingers and ending it all. The raising of the souls. Castiel's pain wiping out every soul before them. Jack, burning in their arms.
Another feather gently floated off of the bed.
Dean shrugged, "Knowing Sam, probably."
Metatron smiled, "The new leader of the universe, of course. All hail Amara."
Castiel broke free from Dean's hand and shoved the duffle at Dean, eyes wild. Dean shook his head, already knowing what was about to happen. Before he could ask Cas not to, the angel said suddenly. "Dean! Go!"
That crafty son of a bitch is going to go through Dean's bags the second Dean falls asleep to figure out what all of this fuss was about. Screw that. Dean's carrying this secret to the grave. He could hide the panties in the bathroom somewhere, but Cas would check in here too because he's not a fucking idiot.
Castiel looked over at the woman in distress again. She was very pretty. Those yoga pants looked damn near painted on. Cas felt that ripping feeling again. Jealousy. That woman can figure her First World Problem out on her own. She shouldn't have overspent. "No. One should only buy what they can carry."
Sam chuckled at the absurdity of the situation.
"Yeah, you're pretty wiley, Mr. Confident. But, I'll pin you down."
The door bumped against Dean's back, toppling the kissing couple over as it opened.
Dean smirked, "So... you really wanted to kiss me, huh? Took Chuck himself ending it all for you to plant one on the Righteous Man."
"Whoa, you think he might shit it out?" Dean chuckled, taking a sip and setting down his tumbler on the bedside table, "That would suck."
Dean raised his palms up in defense, "That's understandable."
"Dude, you're not getting it."
Dean snuggled into his pillow, "Thanks, Cas."
Now that there's a couple living with them, Sam's gotta start thinking of ways to get him and the kid out of the bunker. They're going to be going on a lot of trips soon. Museums, movies, playgrounds, ice cream, camping, rock climbing. Sure, it haunts Sam that he'd be doing this so that his brother had time to both bang his boyfriend and be a dad, but to honest it sounded like fun. Sam was looking forward to spending more quality time with his son. Maybe he won't be teaching Jack magic just yet, but he's definitely teaching him how to movie hop. It's a time honored American tradition.
Castiel began to laugh.
Dean folded his arms, "Sam."
Castiel shifted uncomfortably, fork pushing food across the plate as he avoided eye contact.
Frenching Castiel. He assumed he'd have at least a week of sneaking around with his little angel boyfriend having a bunch of sex before finding the right words and coming out to his brother. Real life is not working out like that. He might not be able to hide it. Sam knows him too damn well.
The stars stretched out, glistening and bright. Castiel showed Dean how the universe cast itself across his skin. Dean listened, wide eyes. He watched as Castiel's finger traveled up and around his arm. The stars twinkled and shone in the distance as the quiet of the night wrapped them up like a blanket.
"You do."
Thirty seconds.
Castiel nodded, leaning in and kissed him again. "Yes. I don't forsee it getting boring."
"Dean."
The trees had grown in thick, blanketing the night sky in even more darkness with their looming height. Two diner stops and several tank refills later, their eyes had started to droop. They'd been on the road for about fifteen hours. Time to call it quits. They need to stretch their legs and get some sleep.
"What is it you could tell me now that I didn't already glean from your prayer?"
Dean shook his head.
Dean stopped painting the walls and peeked behind him for a moment to watch as Jack and Amara stepped up to play their part. He reached across the wall and tapped Cas's trenchcoated shoulder. Castiel met Dean's eyes, and the hunter directed his attention to their son.
Amara popped up, padding across the carpet barefoot. Her black nightgown and dramatic pink robe fluttered across the floor as she walked right over to the rift, heading in. "BRB."
"Where did you get my briefcase from..." Sam sighed.
"It's not Sam. You guys don't bother me." Jack glanced out of the window. "I wanted to check on Cas. So, I did. He's fine."
His shower stuff is out there on the bed with Castiel. With his towel and pajamas. Dean shoved the panties into his pocket and pushed open the bathroom door. He paced through the room, striding past the angel sitting on the edge of the bed. Castiel asked, "Dean--"
Dean gasped, "
. That feeling hit him, bubbling deep and hot in his belly. He knew exactly what he wanted to do. No guesswork needed. Castiel pulled, the fabric of Dean's boxers peeling back and revealing his lover's body. Cas shuffled back, pulling them off of Dean's legs and pitching them at the window, racing back. He dove in quickly, licking Dean's cock into his mouth with no warning. Dean grabbed Cas by the hair, shaking out a surprised moan.
Castiel said firmly, "No, this is different. Due to recent circumstances, I have to be a bit sad to survive. But, I will do anything to stay here. Especially now that I have a chance at a life with you. And our son. I won't give that up. I can't."
"You're right."
"Empty or not, it's in breach of contract. Jack technically died again after the deal was made, and he stayed in the Empty instead of Heaven. His death caused the exact trauma your deal was created to avoid. And when the Empty kept him from us, it fucked up, Cas. We lost our son to him, but you held up your end." Dean wiped his face as he collected himself from the emotional shock. "You can argue for your freedom."
"I'm sorry!"
Jack nodded brightly, standing in a pile of his own feathers, "Almost. I asked him if he did and he got mad and told me not to repeat it, so I'm right. Then I told Cas to go talk to Dean, and they talked and they left the house really late to watch the stars together! I thought for sure we'd have news, but they don't really seem too different. Cas is just... shy, I guess. He has his reasons, but true love always wins in the end. Right?"
Sam had laughed. Jack remembers Sam telling him that if Dean and Cas admitted to feeling anything romantic for each other in the next five years, he'd buy the kid a PlayStation.
It's true. The tape was in Jack's bag.
Dean grumbled with relief as his son jogged over to him and Sam. Jack pushed himself in between the two brothers. Sam and Dean covered him with their big arms, holding him close for a moment. Sam patted his son's shoulder. "It's over, Jack. It's finally over. We're so proud of you."
Castiel leaned into Dean, their hands still linked at their sides. They watched Sam and Jack slap hands and celebrate. Dean tugged him closer, shoulders and legs brushing the angel. Cas said quietly, "I was so glad to put Metatron to rest. Now we find he's not only alive but he's... powerful. And living in Reno. I mean, I broke him out of jail and left him with nothing. That was supposed to be the end of it. He deserved to suffer. He shouldn't... he shouldn't be..."
Dean breathed out heavily, "Oh, thank fuck. I just had the craziest feeling. Like Jack was in danger. Like something was coming for us... like something's in the room."
"I felt a little tickle. Thought I'd come check on my book. Do a little copy and line editing. After all, it's a work in progress." Chuck sighed wistfully, "It's a good thing I stopped by when I did. I mean, I simply planned to spy for a bit, but what I just walked in on... I
Dean murmured into his chest, pushing the gun under the pillow, "Thanks, Cas."
Chuck struggled against the iron binds that pinned him to the booth as Amara read aloud. She flipped through the pages and reached her perfect spot with a brilliant smile.
Sam raced toward it as soon as he saw it. He clicked and it sprang to life with a modern greeting screen. "I wrote my senior thesis on this library computer when I was at Stanford. And it's completely updated." Sam typed, dragging the mouse with wonder, "Holy shit, it has Google chrome."
Castiel glanced over at Billie to see her waving her scythe. They had to go. The next part of the plan was coming into fruition. The angel reached forward and tapped Dean's wrist. Dean stepped back to the bar with the angel and Billie. Jack continued to burn the iron as Amara floated over to Chuck's table, sitting on top of it and facing her brother. "It's all over, bruh. There's only one book I'm into this season, and I'll give you a hint... it's a New York Times bestseller."
Castiel lifted Dean with one arm, freeing his hand from his pants and slapping him on the ass with the other. His fingers dug in hard to the soft flesh, and he slapped it again. Castiel's grace buzzed under his skin as he spanked his human lover. He gets why people like doing that. It's flirty, it's fun, and he gets to touch Dean's butt with enthusiasm. "Oh, Dean. This, I can do."
"You mean, you're worried you'll lose?"
Dean didn't hold back with breakfast this morning, and Cas actually ended up being an incredible chopper and stirrer. Plus, Dean didn't need to use his phone timer with an angel around. Dean had told Cas to take things out or add things in. Five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes more. Castiel was always right on schedule. They'd whipped together scrambled eggs, hash browns, grilled sausages, blueberry yogurt with granola, and mounds of fluffy pancakes piled high with powdered sugar and strawberries.
He looked at his hand. Castiel's pinky brushed against his, attempting to squeeze underneath the human's fingers. The angel was still looking out of the window, stone faced and unflappable as always. Yet, here he is trying to hold his human's hand. Dean looked back to the road with a smile on his face. Yeah. For sure. He's glad Cas wanted to play this game.
"I. Said. Where!" Sam fixed his eyes on the moon sternly, continuing to chant. He kept casting. Sam demanded the moon give him his answer. He wanted more. Understandable. Nevada's a pretty big state. Since he's finally got demon AAA on the phone he might as well get his time's worth. Dean didn't blame him for wanting to speak to the manager.
"Dean! Dean, what are you doing?! You're gonna explode in here! Dean!"
Dean barked, "What claimed you?"
Dean has worked for Pizza Hut for the last three years.
Before they went downstairs, Castiel got him dressed so that he could blend in better with the humans. The angel pulled Jack from his arcade match with Dean. He let Jack choose part of the outfit, holding up two sweaters. Jack chose a tan one with a shawl collar. Then Cas tossed him a pair of jeans and sneakers. Jack started crying because he didn't want to be out of the dinosaur suit, but Cas comforted him and rubbed his back and told him Dean was cutting an apple for him.
Dean folded his arms, "Keep talking."
Castiel shrugged, "He did swallow it whole. It's worth millions. Be quite a shame if he flushed it."
a gasket is!"
Denial.
Jack asked if they'd ever be together.
Sam suddenly realized something. He pushed his laptop aside and leaned back in his barstool, giving Dean a long look. "Dude. I can't believe you've been hunting since you were four and this is your first interspecies relationship! Welcome to the club. How's that going? He accidentally scare the hell outta you yet? Cuz let me tell ya. One time Ruby ripped off a piece of the headboard and I damn near had a heart attack."
Jack whined, face full of tears, "It's just a stupid outfit!"
"The Empty said that it wanted me to suffer. For all the things I took from him when he woke. So, he would give me time. Wait for me to forget about this deal, and when I was truly happy, he would come for me and snatch it all away. I thought I bested him. I've never been truly happy, and its unlikely I'll start any time soon." Cas said, resting against Dean's dresser drawers as he added, "But, seeing as the world is what you would call a 'shit sandwich on rye', it's starting to be less about the Empty preying on my happiness, and more... a matter of time."
Castiel pressed soft kisses to Dean's neck, "If I'd known theft was the way to your heart, I would have started stealing things ages ago."
Two more feathers appeared under Castiel's hands as he petted the boy's back. One was caught in his fingers.
"Significant other?"
"..." Dean watched as the man stared into his eyes with unfounded belligerent intensity. So, Dean stared back. This counter guy is not like other counter guys. He had a name tag, but Dean couldn't look away from his eyes to get a read on it. "I, uh.... I am. Far from home."
Chuck laughed.
Sam caught his breath and sighed, "Thank you."
Dean scoffed, "A snag? What kind of snag? I thought Jack was in Heaven."
Turns out it took all of five minutes to close the seemingly irreparable rift between Dean and his son. Jack promised his fidelity to his family, apologizing sincerely for his wrongdoing, and swearing to stay close and honest. The boy truly missed his grandmother. That's all that Dean really wanted to hear.
Dean gestured to the duffle, "I get that you're super strong, and ripped, and hunky and all..."
Whoops, Dean might have prayed that. Was that weird? Probably not. They did their waiting. It's out now and they finally know. Castiel had Fallen in love with him and Dean fell back. Now, they're together. Dean closed his eyes and thought to himself:
Dean said to Chuck. "You can't exploit weakness that isn't there. We found our family. We found our peace. We're a strong team and we beat you already. But, if you still want to fight..." Dean flipped an angel blade in his dominant hand. "We can fight. Hard."
Instead, Dean went to the stove and cooked.
Sam patted the kid's shoulder, "No. It's built on engineering and physics. But sometimes that can look like magic, yeah. Science the closest thing humans have to it. It's like casting a spell with numbers and shapes and theories until this...." Sam picked up his ball, "Magically transports itself from one side of the room to the next without anyone having to lift a finger."
"It's not that, Cas. He's Lucifer's lovechild, the world was gunning for him before he was even born. Us included. He was never gonna have it easy." Dean shook his head, stating clearly, "It's... the way you care. I mean, even soulless and raving mad, Jack was certain that you loved him and had his back. That's how dads should be."
Dean's been in love with Cas for so long, he wasn't ready to wade through a transition stage mid-hunt. But, mid-hunt is when Castiel made his move. Chuck's little reality check clicked things into place, but not in the way the villainous creature intended. They weren't supposed to fall in love. But, they did anyway. They fell hard and deep and passionate. Castiel said the words because he needed to, and Dean made his own confessions. They were honest, raw, intimate, romantic, real with each other as soon as Chuck left. In a way, Dean was freed.
Dean leaned in, hands at Cas's face as he kissed him. "Mmm, we would. I'd make sure of it."
Castiel complained, "But, Dean--"
Sam grabbed his son by the shoulder, "Those two are a mess. Learn from their mistakes. Let's put our things away and find somewhere to cast. Sound cool, Jack?"
Sam headed to admin, Charlie was live and waiting in his ear. Jack peeled off to check the bars and restaurants. Dean headed to scan the spa and pools. Castiel took the bowling alley and gym.
Dean held Cas's face with soft hands, "Cas..."
Jack smiled up at Dean, "I'm not done yet. Wait till lunch comes! Then I'll show everyone."
The hotel room door closed behind the pretty brunette in yoga pants. She pulled the silver cart of bags down the hall, little Gucci sneakers carrying her silently over to the boys. "You're right, Castiel." She leaned down to pull an angel blade out of a Dolce & Gabbana bag. "Something is very, very wrong. You're not supposed to be here."
"Nothing. Just relaxing." Dean said, still shifting and rubbing against Cas's pants as they moved together. Cas kissed his neck again, stubble brushing Dean's skin. Dean's breath caught in his throat as the angel's large hand wandered up his shirt. His fingers sailed up past his belly and ribs and nipples. Dean panted in his arms. Castiel whispered against his neck, kissing him warmly, "I dont think you're being honest with me, Dean."
The sink turned on behind him as Jack washed his hands, and Cas glanced up at Dean as he set down the last plate. Castiel immediately noticed the feather in Dean's hand, glancing to the floor to see the pile Jack's wings made.
Sam started to complain at the sound of that, "Okay, no. Noooo. Hard pass. We're on our way to battle. I will not sit through
Dean complained, "I regret taking you out here."
Dean woke at sunrise. His eyes cracked open as he blinked with a big yawn, the rising sun hot in his eyes. There was a hand in his hair. A big hand. It was thick and manly. Familiar. Warm and healing. Strong fingers massaged his scalp gently, smoothing and twining through his dirty blond locks.
"Yeah. Sure." Sam chuckled, clearly not believing his brother. He knows when the guy is lying.
The front door of the hotel room opened, footsteps tapping slowly down the hall. Everyone in the room's heart sank. They all knew who it was. Meta started to smile, "You're in big trouble now. My queen is back. I'd untie me if I were you."
Dean pulled a sweater out to show his brother and his angel. It was yellow cashmere with red stitching at the color. Jack's size. Sam's eyes widened, he walked up, taking it in his hands. "Did Amara give us a wardrobe?"
Castiel tilted his head, "You like the sweater?"
The words cut from Chuck's throat as he choked. His eyes widened and he stopped talking.
Castiel pointed to his friend's butt, "It was there. You look so lovely while you work, I couldn't help myself. If my gaze makes you feel uncomfortable I can look elsewhere."
Dean laughed loudly, "God, you girls are a good time, huh? Happy birthday."
Good. Everything was finally becoming good. The Winchesters were a family again. They were all working together to fullfil Billie's plan. Soon, Chuck will be vanquished and finally, there will be peace. Things were looking up.
Jack kept looking out of the window, "I'm sure."
Jack gasped, "Agent Badu. That sounds so cool!"
Dean laughed again, rolling his eyes and heading for the living room with the book Cas found for him. He turned past the kitchen island and out of the room. Dean strolled into the living room. He approached Sam at the glass table.
Dean stopped in his tracks, hearing a deep voice grumble out in his direction.
Castiel looked up from the bowl, an unbothered expression on his face. "Hmm?"
Dean breathed heavily, pushing Cas's cashmere sweater around his chest. "Yeah. But could you..."
The strips of paper added a note below Metatron's location.
Dean blushed. "Yeah."
Dean nodded, "Yeah. Just... um... Cas?"
. All things he'd never really felt before. Cas could hardly believe it. It was new to him, but he doesn't think it's a bad thing. Not at all. Just different. This place has a silver lining. Whether Sam can see it or not.
"Let me find the most accurate representation." Dean turned his back to the fridge, rifling through it for a moment while Sam started to laugh behind him. "Ahhh, yes! Mmm. Here we go," Dean grinned, turning around before slamming a zucchini down on the table in front of his brother. "It's that big."
Castiel stood up as the door closed behind Sam and Jack. He walked over to Dean in the quiet. Dean hid his face in his hands, still slumped on the floor, "I can't believe that just friggin happened to us. We were doing so good. He saw Jack, Cas."
Sam spoke up, "Well, you don't have a choice. Lives are at stake. Dean and Cas have you bound, just give us a location and we'll be out of your hair."
Dean and Castiel raced through the dark forest of Purgatory, the human lagging behind more than he would like to admit. The ground was littered with leaves and branches and the mangled corpses of dead monsters. Stepping over it all swiftly, Castiel reached back with his free hand and grabbed Dean by his bicep, hoisting him along with his slightly superhuman speed. Dean could feed Cas's warm hand gripping him so tight he couldn't help but follow.
He stirred at a big bowl, it's wet contents sloshing around and splashing his coat as he concentrated on mixing. This was his first time making pancake batter. Dean could tell from halfway across the kitchen that the angel had used way too much milk. They're gonna have a lot of pancakes. Dean can tell. Too many to eat. He rolled his eyes, grating homegrown Kansas russet potatoes to make some hash browns, "Cas, throw a little more flour in there. Baking powder too. You gotta dry out that batter just a bit. Any wetter and we're gonna end up with crepes."
Meta shrugged in their ropes, "Kid, I was sitting right by the balcony when Chuck told Amara that he killed you outta fear. She knew he did. She felt it happen. The Darkness is in harmony with tragedy and disasters. When a powerful creature bites it, she gets an Amber Alert. They got into an argument about how irrationally he dealt with you. And he's just been getting worse. Attitude, tantrums, demands. He's gotten to be a bit annoying. Amara banished him from Reno a few weeks ago. He can't come anywhere near this place until he gets his act together."
"Then let's call our heavy hitter. What about Amara? She seemed excited to reconnect with it." Dean scooted closer, eyes wide. "Let's invite her tomorrow when we summon Billie. Maybe we can convince them both to go to bat for you." Dean pointed, "Those two might be able to dissolve your deal without breaking a sweat. And if you need a mouthy human with an attitude problem to fight for your freedom, I will. Always."
Jack chewed with his chipmunk cheeks stuffed, pure joy on his face.
"Oh."
All of the prep work was completed. Meta stayed behind in Reno, managing Amara's busy schedule while her boss went to the west coast to overthrow her brother. The spellwork they'd etched into the floorboards an hour ago would drain the energy of any diety that tread upon it. Including her. So, she decided not to walk.
"Right?" Sam jogged over to Jack, giving the kid a high five. The little bowling ball machine made a little clunking noise and Sam's ball came right back up beside the boy. Jack jumped. He pointed to Sam's ball and then pointed to where the pins were knocked down. But when he looked, ten pins were set right back up as if they'd never fallen.
Jack said quietly, "I'm not gonna hurt you." He leaned into Meta on the couch sincerely, "That room is important to you. I know. But here's the deal, Chuck is trying to end the universe. All of it. Chuck has killed every other world he's created. His wrath destroyed the lives of billions. And we're the last world on his list. To stop him from killing us, we need to know where that special room is. We don't plan to ruin it, or even stay. We just need to visit. For a moment. To keep everyone safe from him. You included."
"See? This is what I'm talking about." Chuck pointed at the angel. "Jeez, Cas what happened to you? You used to command armies. Now you play groupie to the Righteous Man like it's still your job. Stupid angel. He'll never love you. He
"No."
"Not if handling it for a prolonged period of time in a heated situation would take a toll on your muscles. All the motion, the thrusting, the strikes? It would tire you out and you'd soon get sore."
Speaking to Dean when he's like this is much like being approached by a large bear or an unpredictable dinosaur. If Cas just stands still and gives him nothing, Dean will eventually stop teasing him.
Sam sighed, "I hope he never figures out that contracts signed by a minor aren't legally binding."
Castiel stepped into Dean's space beside the open fridge. He had a large navy colored book in his hands, flipping it to show Dean the thin crust pizza on the cover. "I found this in a drawer. Thought you'd want to see it."
"Nothing." Dean answered sadly, hanging his head and walking over to the Pizza Hut side of the store without a doughnut or a cute boy to say "hi" to him. He knows it's something small to get hung up about, but he misses his new friend Cas already. And he definitely misses those doughnuts. They tasted sweeter coming from
The boy reminded him of Dean when he wakes up, all whining and grumpiness. Dean says he doesn't like being watched over much either, but according to Sam, he went to five garage sales to find the perfect resting chair for Castiel to sit in while he sleeps. When Cas first laid eyes on Dean's chair, the hunter was shy and a bit standoffish about it. The chair was always clean and empty unless Castiel was sitting in it. It was a strong dark mahogany wood behemoth with incredible back support, and sat in the same spot for years, turned at an angle towards Dean Winchester's bed. Every now and then, Cas takes a seat. They'd talk long into the night, and eventually the beautiful hunter would drift away, lulled into a still and quiet slumber. Castiel cringed at how warm that made him feel inside.
years ago, you keep showing up uninvited with demands like I owe you something -- which I don't. You're not paying me an hourly consulting rate, so..."
Castiel stared over at Dean fondly, "Thank you..." Then Cas lifted his free hand, raising two fingers and air quoting, "Baby."
Dean waved his hand between Sam and Rowena. "Wait, wait, wait. You and Rowena? When did this happen?"
Castiel turned to the blushing hunter, "I'm not going anywhere. Ever."
Castiel flicked the back of Jack's head playfully, "A million years ol -- rude."
"Don't short change me, I know you're here! I know you're listening! Give me his location! I won't ask again!"
Castiel nodded, "Yes."
Castiel replied simply, "I can steal it for you if you like. We don't have a credit card at the desk."
Chuck continued to seethe mercilessly. "I'm in your heads, I made your life! I'm the reason you even want the things you want. You drink because I made you hate yourself, Dean! You study monsters like a coked up Harvard student because I gave you 24/7 round-the-clock fear, Sam! You two want a son so badly because I made sure John treated you boys like shit! You can't kill me. I am you."
