to do this for me?”
He’ll never be able to voice all that.
Sighing, his brother stopped spearing veggies on a stick and turned around to face him fully. “Are you kidding? You’re amazing, Dean. In school, everyone always talked about that cool Winchester guy and it wasn’t me. You’ve always been somehow famous and you charm everyone around you. You’re smart,” Dean wanted to deny that, but before he could, Sammy raised a hand at him and continued, “don’t try to dispute that, Dean. You may not see it, but everyone around you does. You’re smart in your own way. You’re open-minded, tolerant, vibrant and so loyal. The people in your life can be glad to know someone like you. And besides the fact that you’re funny and easy on the eyes, you’re also the most loving and caring person I know and I always wanted to be like you, but it’s just impossible to reach that if your brother is Dean Winchester.”
He shook his whole body as if a cold shiver ran down his spine at the memory and Castiel frowned, asking, “You tried that once? Why?”
Dean kept them bent and open automatically and watched as Castiel grabbed another condom and the lubricant once more. He ripped open the foliage and rolled the rubber onto his stiff and throbbing cock, then opened the bottle of lube and poured some into his palm, which he used to cover his cock with. What was left of it on his palm got wiped off on his thigh and Castiel placed his hands on each of Dean’s hips and pulled him against his own body. Then Cas took himself in hand and guided his cock to Dean’s entrance, resting his tip against Dean’s hole and taking a few steadying breaths.
This made Jimmy laugh heartedly and he had to admit that he’d never truly thought about this before but now that Dean told him about it, it made perfect sense. Society may have gotten more tolerant and open and accepting when it came to things like gender roles, but people still seemed to fall back into some kind of conventional thinking as soon as the person looked ‘normal’ to them. Meaning, if a man dressed more feminine were to come into a lingerie store looking for panties, people would be faster to assume he was buying them for himself than a man wearing boots, ripped jeans, and a leather jacket, like Dean.
Dean couldn’t help but moan at the feeling of Castiel sinking so deeply into him, so completely – filling his most vulnerable and intimate part. And Castiel fully understood. Dean felt fucking amazing even with a condom and he couldn’t even entertain thoughts of how it would feel without a barrier between his pulsing flesh and Dean’s soft inner walls without shaking apart at that moment. His balls pressed against Dean’s asscheeks and the feel of his silken skin against Dean’s soft globes, not to mention his tight, hot, perfect channel sheathing him like he was created to fit inside, made Castiel try to reach even deeper and deeper.
Dean’s eyes were wide, his pupils blown wide and a beautiful flush covered his skin as he swallowed audibly and turned back around to walk into the bathroom without saying another word.
So he made up his mind and unwrapped the towel to put them on, making sure everything sat right, and grabbed his sweats, pulling them up his legs and placing them low on his hips, but not too low to give him away and ruin the fun. Dean wanted to finally have some sexy time with his boyfriends now that they weren’t over a thousand miles away, and this was his last attempt at seducing them before he would stop trying to do it subtly and just straight out say that he wanted to be fucked.
“Look at you, Dean,” Castiel demanded softly and Dean had no other option but to obey, looking at himself in the mirror as Cas brushed his big hands slowly up and down his belly and then his chest. “You’re so strong; you’ve been strong for your entire life. Stronger than anyone I’ve ever met. You’ve been through so much more than anyone ever should,” Cas rasped against the juncture of his neck, palming his pec before sliding his hand up further to pinch a nipple, making Dean gasp silently, “and yet, your soul is pure and beautiful. And outside, you’re just as stunning.”
He had to carefully roll Dean onto his back again, without the blonde noticing, and once that was done, Cas merely stroked his head, carding his fingers through his damp hair and massaging his scalp lovingly, to let Dean soak in the post-orgasmic afterglow. He was almost as if in subspace and Castiel smiled sweetly at Jimmy when his twin brought two wet cloths to clean Dean and their surroundings up. He tenderly cleaned off all the cum from his boyfriend, being mindful of his over-sensitive skin and trying not to disturb him, while Jimmy tried cleaning the sheet and himself. When Dean was washed and his hole no longer leaking, Cas exchanged places with his brother and watched as Jimmy climbed onto the table to cradle Dean’s head in his lap.
“Anything.”
Nodding slightly, Dean said, “Yes, Castiel.”
This was a sight he would forever hold in his memory. Seeing Dean easily bump four fingers into his ass had him wondering if he’d ever want to be fisted and at the mere thought, another wave of pleasure coursed through his body, adding to the heat in his stomach, and he moaned loudly. And just when he thought he might come in his pants without any kind of stimulation – which was, by the way, something he didn’t know was even possible until he met Dean – the blonde pulled out his fingers and turned back around. While his skin was flushed and his pupils dilated, he looked pretty unshaken in contrast to the heavily panting Jimmy with a rock hard dick trapped in his boxers. Swallowing loudly, Jimmy breathed out, “See what you do to me?” and watched a triumphant smile form on Dean’s plush lips.
Cas sounded genuinely concerned while he closed the door and Jimmy turned with a nervous expression. “No. It’s quite the opposite, actually.” He fiddled with the napkin before handing it to Cas, who stared at it with confusion. “I met Dean today.”
“I really didn’t want to insult you, Dean.”
With two hands on his dick now – one still locked around it like a vice, the other thumbing his slit through his pants and circling his head – Dean had a hard time keeping himself from obviously squirming in his seat. But clenching his cheeks in order to do that pushed the plug deeper into his ass to the point that it pressed against his prostate, which made him squirm and choke down moans in return. All in all, it was a fruitless fight and he ended up squirming and gasping like a boy needing to relieve his bladder after five hours of keeping it in, and the matching self-satisfied smirks on his boyfriends’ faces at seeing him struggling and trying to avoid giving himself away completely in front of the whole restaurant wasn’t helping him either. The plug kept hitting his prostate, his cheeks kept flushing to the point that he felt the heat of his own face, and his cock kept leaking pre-cum that was for sure creating a dark, wet spot at the front of his pants by now and Dean was helpless to it all.
Dean turned around with a set expression, gazing at Benny with his eyes formed into slits as he placed three glasses down on the counter in front of them with a bit more force than necessary before cocking a brow and crossing his arms. “You’ve been here for all of two minutes and already teasing me, you ass.” The words were spoken with an amused undertone and Cas saw right through Dean, knowing he was trying very hard not to show his amusement but failing after a while when his lips started to twitch at the corners.
“It’s like 3.40 pm, haven’t you had something to eat today?” It wasn’t accusatory, just teasing.
Jimmy’s cheeks blushed at having been called out like that and Cas grinned, his hands absently stroking the luxurious curve of Dean’s hips as he followed their conversation. “It’s actually neither a fetish nor a true kink,” Cas informed, matter-of-factly.
He had never hated a person more in his entire life.
Once fully buried, he leaned forward on his hands, which were propped up on each side of Jimmy’s middle and Dean’s shoulders, and draped his body over Dean’s, though not enough to truly lean down on them – he was not putting any extra weight on Jimmy since he kept himself up on his hands and knees. After giving the blonde a moment to adjust, Cas retracted his hips a fraction to pull out of him halfway, before thrusting back inside again and again.
“Why? You got that kink?”
Having Dean like this, – completely at their mercy, suspended and restrained so that everything depended on Cas and Jimmy only while showing everyone in the room that Dean was theirs – feeling him so close, and watching him lose his inhibitions and control as he visibly started to slowly slip into subspace, was enough to bring Jimmy close to climax and he placed his hand on Dean’s neck to tangle his deft fingers in his blonde hair, massaging his scalp and making him sigh and close his eyes before pulling him into a sloppy kiss and licking greedily into his mouth. Castiel removed the spreader soon after and the next time Dean was lowered onto him, his cock was engulfed by Dean’s velvety heat, and he moaned, long and drawn out, at the most perfect feeling in the world. Feeling his boyfriend like this, and only Dean, was what brought him to the edge and he slipped his hand out of Dean’s hair to wrap it around his hard cock, and when he felt it vibrate in his own palm because of the sound stuffed into his slit, Jimmy all but growled as his orgasm washed over him, electrifying his entire body for a second as he filled Dean up with his cum, coating his lovely insides with his milky sperm.
Ignoring the first question, Dean teased, “I get it, you guys are big, but I can handle it.”
Jimmy hadn’t even thought about that himself. Thinking about it, he never really did. When they were in a scene together, everything was intense and thrilling and he was always way too concentrated on Dean and his responses to even care whether he or Cas got to have sex with Dean. The only thing that mattered then was to please their boyfriend the way he pleased them – to make him feel good.
Sam’s face turned grim but Dean could see right underneath the surface and laughed, receiving a hard but playful jab at his shoulder from Sam. “You dick.”
“Cas?”
Which was what he wanted now. So he inched forward with his hips, pressing the head of his cock against Dean’s lips and widened his stance for better purchase. Since he had already had his foreplay, Dean wasted no time working over his thick erection, but he did make sure to swirl his tongue and apply flicking motions to his frenulum, knowing all the different things that turned them on and using it to make them lose their minds. Cas groaned and stroked Dean’s face where his hand was still underneath his chin as their boyfriend hollowed his cheeks and started sucking.
“Oh my God, Cas! You cheated? Innocent, sweet Cas cheated in his finals!” Dean laughed loudly and Castiel couldn’t help but join and laugh himself.
Taking a look at his surroundings, Cas thought about how he wanted to adjust the hook and answered, “Actually, get back into your previous position, head to the beam.”
familiar heat that lay beneath.
Castiel searches his memories, then nods his head.
“Yes, Castiel.”
“Already did.” He went back to the sofa and sat down, Jessica followed. “How d’you manage to live with him anyway? I mean, there’s this rabbit food all the time and the bathroom is stuffed with all those fancy hair-products…” Dean rolled his eyes at her and Jessica laughed. He could pretend all he wanted, but she knew how much Dean loved his brother.
!” as he orgasmed, his entire body going slack. Castiel could feel Dean spasming as his hot cum filled the condom. He had just rolled it onto Dean to prevent the couch from getting sticky with their activities – if they would have been in bed, Cas would’ve loved to feel it covering his skin.
Castiel threw a nervous look at the dance floor. There were a few couples and colleagues slow-dancing, hugging each other close and grinning widely. And while he’d have loved to hold Dean in his arms like that, he was hyper-aware of the fact that dancing wasn’t his strong suit. So he turned back to Dean and said, “I’m not sure. I can’t really dance and am rather bad at it.”
As soon as the door fell shut, Dean turned around and looked at the twins excitedly, grinning shyly at them and waiting for them to say something.
Cas took the sterilizer and started to prepare the sound, smiling slightly. “Yes, that is correct.” He watched him clean and sterilize the shiny metal for a while until Castiel seemed to deem it ready, and then covered it with a healthy amount of lubricant.
After having found their place and booked a viewing, they discussed that Dean would have to stay three weeks longer than them because he still had a lot to do before he could move out, with everything concerning moving out of his old apartment and quitting his job and getting rid of his old furniture – he told them that they wouldn’t have any need for them and since he was going to drive to California with his car anyway, he could only keep the important stuff.
“I fix cars.”
“It’s not where I am… I can’t leave the room knowing you’re hurting. I can’t. So I have to watch and make sure you’re fine but watching makes me feel so bad… it makes me feel…”
, I need it. Need to feel it…”
As he trailed his finger across his skin, merely savoring every sensation, he thought about all the ways they could do just that and he could happily spend the whole night or longer tracing every inch of this beautiful skin with his hands, his lips, his tongue, and he couldn't begin to express his gratitude that somehow, he had earned the chance to do so. Somewhere along the way, Dean had decided to trust them and he would give everything to keep that trust for the rest of his life.
Dean realized then that Cas wanted to fuck him in some sort of turtle sex position and he grinned slightly as he leaned forward with his chest until his ass was in the air completely with his knees digging into the mattress, hopefully giving Castiel the access he wanted, and then wrapped his arms around the backs of his legs, turning his face to the side so that it rested on the mattress as well and he was still able to see and breathe.
He knew that Dean wanted to come, Cas saw how hard he was and how much he was leaking whenever he lifted his hips to grind back, and he also knew that he wanted his cock, judging by the way he had gazed at his crotch before and how he pressed back against his tongue, trying to take it in deeper. Although, Castiel had to admit that his tongue could be pretty long if he wanted it to be.
The man’s body is rigid and blood is oozing out of several wounds; two at his sides, probably a damaged kidney, one at his shoulder, and one in the middle of his torso, right underneath his chest.
An adorable snort left Dean and he propped up his elbows on the table to be closer to Jimmy. “You know, ever since my brother met his girlfriend, all they allow themselves to eat are healthy vegetarian meals and uncooked veggies and stuff. It’s hell. I just needed some real food right now. Jess is amazing, but I just can’t live on rabbit food, I gotta have at least some nice meat on my plate.”
“Awesome,” Dean mumbled, swinging his legs over the mattress to place his feet on the floor. He had to close his eyes at the impact of the headache on his body at the motion and he managed to press out a “will do” past his clenched teeth to answer the nurse’s call to “take it easy and not forget your medication.”
“Me too, dear,” Cas answered, craning his neck to look at Dean with a soft smile.
There could’ve been many reasons for that – Dean not wanting to look at them because he was mad at them, because he was disgusted by their family, because he was still coping with what happened, because he was overcome with that voice in his head trying to suppress his voice of reason, or worse; Dean was drowning in his own thoughts and lost touch to reality… – but the last thought was enough to get Cas into action, even as his heart threatened to break out of his thorax.
He blinked away more potential tears to clear his blurry view a few times and nodded, saying, “Before you told us that you feel like this sometimes, I was thinking about my life and how everything in it revolves around you. And I thought about the dreams I sometimes have in which I lose you, and when I wake up from them, I have this ache inside of me. I feel physical pain at the thought of losing you, Dean. I only seem to be able to calm down again when I see you and when I hold you in my arms to assure you’re still with us… because I freaking love you this much.” He was barely able to hold back the sob and Dean sought out Cas’ hands with his own to twine them with his once he found them and wrap Cas’ arms around his middle so that he was holding Dean just like he said he needed to. Their eyes were locked onto each other’s and Castiel had never been more thankful that Dean was their boyfriend than now.
He was nearing the inevitable but he was determined to lay his claim – to mark Dean in the most primal of ways. Having the blonde beneath him like this, vulnerable and sex drunk and wanting him, was more than he would have ever dared to ask for.
because they had really cool stuff that Dean found felt pretty nice and he liked that they were this huge. They even had toys with knots or tongue-shaped ones, which sounded odd, but he had seen weirder shit. The absurdest he had ever seen was one shaped like the Queen… not even Thor’s hammer could trump that. Dean truly wondered who’d fuck themselves with something formed like a person, let alone a person like the Queen. He’d feel dirty and wrong knowing he was pleasuring himself with a dildo like that and he didn’t know what was alluring about that, seeing as it wasn’t even funny.
Sometimes, he laid in his bed at night and thought about things that could’ve gone differently – better. He never really forgave himself for letting it get Dean, even though the elder Winchester repeatedly explained that, if he had wanted anyone to know, he would have sought help. Sometimes, Sam wondered if Dean hadn’t told him because he didn’t trust his little brother enough, and that made him hate himself even more…
“Okay, Castiel.”
His voice quiet, almost jittery, Dean asked, “W-what do you want me to do, Castiel?”
When the two began to stir and Dean blinked open his eyes with a slight groan, stretching his legs, Castiel sat up straight and watched them reorient themselves. While the blonde couldn’t wait to get into an upright position and take a look at their new view – which Cas hadn't paid any attention to even once since he had woken up –  Jimmy seemed to be unable to let go and made a displeased noise as his arm slid down Dean’s torso, landing in his lap.
Leaning back a bit to look him in the eyes, Cas admitted, “It’s exactly what you said in the restaurant.”
“Sometimes, people just run out of things to talk about and you end up having uncomfortable small talk.”
So hearing Dean say something like that, something so little yet so huge, so important… yeah, it has Castiel at a complete loss of words.
“I guess,” he shrugged. Jimmy had never really dug that deep into his twin’s sex life. At least, not before he met Dean.
He was glad that Cas was keeping a soothing contact with him because this was something they’ve never done before; having a scene in a public place like this, however secluded it might be. If they were too loud, they could still be heard by the others and the thrill of that was already a lot for Dean, which was probably the reason for him drifting so fast.
Jimmy chuckled and watched his twin, who was trying really hard not to smile. “I sure hope you don’t during sex,” Cas managed to say after a moment, ignoring Dean’s complete lack of table manners.
“Okay, so what did she say?”
And that’s why, out of the blue, Castiel blurts: “where’s Dean?” and cuts Benny off mid-sentence. The Cajun looks at him with a puzzled expression, as if he’s grown two heads, so he explains: “you know, I’ve been here for four weeks, and I didn’t hear of him once.” At Benny’s intense gaze, Castiel looks down at his hands, folded in his lap. “At first, I thought it was because you guys were busy at the front. But now you’re here and you seem to be okay, but Dean’s still not visited and I’m starting to be very worried about him. So… have you seen him lately?”
Sam remembered a time where he had had to be more than just a brother to Dean and he suddenly felt a rush of emotions as these pictures came flooding back. He swallowed them down as they threatened to close his throat and blinked a few times to get rid of the moisture in his eyes.
was he hard. It drove him insane and his fingernails were digging into the seat to keep himself from placing his palm on the small of Dean’s back and helping him rock into his lap. Their faces were close and their breaths mingled, mouths only inches apart, and Jimmy longed to kiss Dean’s parted lips, to taste and claim him.
His breath puffed out across the skin of Dean’s cheek and he shivered again, nodding. “Yes, Castiel, I understand.”
submissive,” and Dean found himself burning even hotter from the possessive undertones to Castiel’s voice.
for him – how ironic…
For a brief moment, Dean merely fiddled with what was inside the box, biting down on his lip with his eyes focused on the contents until he seemed to have gathered enough courage to take it out, setting the box aside. In his hand were two or three leather bands, Cas wasn’t really sure because he couldn’t see, and Dean arranged them in his palm, placing one on top of the box before opening his hand to show the gift to them.
Biting his lip, Dean shook his head and said, “I guess… not,” which had Castiel grinning widely and Jimmy meeting his eyes in excitement.
And Castiel was looking forward to learning and falling in love with everything about him.
“Dean?!” He turned his head and saw that Cas was jogging towards them, his eyes big and concerned. His hands framed his face as soon as he reached them, like a parent would to examine a kid after it fell on the face, and usually, Dean would have complained that he wasn’t a baby and could damn well take care of himself. But right now, his touch was soothing and his eyes calmed the storm inside of him.
“‘s that what you’re doing right now?” Dean asked with a mischievous grin before letting his head fall back into the pillow.
Propping himself up on his elbow to get a better look at Dean’s face, Castiel said, “What did she do?”
“Like you don’t have a favorite color, movie, or band?” Dean teased, flicking his eyes up at him. “The wings are freaking amazing, but I kinda like the tree of life the most. It’s just so…  meaningful.”
“Cas, you can’t blame yourself for something you had no say in.”
“Yes. I wanna surrender to you. Take whatever you allow me to feel.” He leaned his upper body further into Castiel and smiled sweetly, fluttering his eyelashes at him seductively.
For a brief moment, Jimmy wondered why Cas always used the term ‘fucking’ when he talked about Dean’s previous partners but otherwise insisted on saying ‘having sex’ or even ‘making love’ when he was talking about them. As if he couldn’t say those terms in the same sentence as the name Michael or whoever. As if just the thought of Dean having been intimate with someone before was unbearable and using a derogatory and offensive word like ‘fucking’ was somehow making it easier for him because, with it, one didn’t associate feelings or real intimacy.
The day had been drawn out and taxing and it was long past 3 am when they were finally on their way home from the police station, Jimmy driving the car with a set but still somewhat uneasy expression while Castiel sat beside Dean in the backseat. The blonde was quiet, uncharacteristically so, and it worried him. He couldn’t stop his leg from bouncing up and down with nervousness, glancing at Dean from time to time to make sure he was still there. Castiel wanted to reach his hand out and place it on his boyfriend’s thigh to soothe him but, for some reason, he knew that he should keep his distance and give Dean some space. After all, he had just filed a report for everything Michael had done to him today and the day he’d moved away from Kansas as well as put a restraining order on him so he couldn’t come within 500 meters of Dean.
“Okay, let’s head back, I said everything that I wanted,” Sam started turning around but swung back to face them and pointed a finger at him, adding, “Don’t tell Dean that we had this conversation or he’ll rip my head off.” Then, he turned and walked back towards Dean and Jessica, who were both sleeping next to each other by now.
“Well, I was a teen and drunk, everything about that story is just wrong.” Dean followed Castiel and took a few gulps himself.
Dean’s hips came completely off the mattress even without his legs for leverage when Castiel kept pressing the pad of his thumb against the place between his anus and scrotum and groaned “
Feeling that exciting thrill and the pull of his inner Dom inside, Cas grinned and met Dean’s eyes intently, holding them. “A scene?”
From his position on the bed, Cas reached his hands out to undo his fly, zipping it open to have access to his hard cock, and pulled it out through the hole. Freeing his erection was a blessing and he sighed, watching Dean wet his lips, his green eyes zeroed in on Cas’ thick length standing proud, a stark contrast to the rest of his clothed body.
After he had Dean squirming, he moved on to his buttocks and pushed the tips of his thumbs downward while making short rotating movements to achieve a deeper penetration, his fingers splaying out at the sides of his thigh. He continued to massage his asscheek for a while until Dean started moaning slightly and then paid attention to his other buttock, giving it the same treatment.
Stuffing his hands in the pockets of his jacket, Dean said, “You, too.” And then he gave him a sweet smile and a short nod, then slowly turned around and left the studio, leaving behind a stupidly smiling Jimmy.
And there they were again – those syllables…
“Really?”
“It was okay, I guess, but it was also the most difficult thing I ever did in my life because I gave over my control completely and at first, I struggled to stop breaking up the session before it even started. I have never again used my safeword as much as I did during that time.” Cas remembered it all still perfectly clear and he felt some sort of phantom pain or fear at the mere thought of being suspended instead of doing the suspending. “That’s why I think you’re so amazing, Dean. I admire the strength that comes from a Submissive and they have, up until now, always been the strongest people I’ve known. It’s a great and very intimate honor that you’d trust us with something like this.”
Their boyfriend nodded sluggishly and got up slowly on his hands and knees before turning around and lowering himself again. Cas watched Dean’s muscles ripple underneath his skin and the way his proud cock bobbed with every move he made. It was tantalizing to look at and Castiel was fast to get up onto the huge table and sit down, cross-legged, behind Dean’s head, following Jimmy’s movements with his gaze as his twin placed himself on his hands and knees above Dean, who’s eyes were wide, head slightly lifted off the pillow to look at Jimmy. He had his hands propped next to Dean’s arms and his knees dug into the table at the sides of Dean’s calves. His cock was erected as well and its tip almost pressed into the blonde’s pelvis as Jimmy bent down to dip his tongue into Dean’s navel, peppering kisses down his abdomen but stopping before he reached his groin. Dean let out all the air he had been holding inside at the realization that he still had to wait for his sexy bits to be touched and leaned his head back, simultaneously closing his eyes and missing the look Jimmy shot him while squeezing more oil into his palm.
“Yeah?” Cas asked, smiling, “Tell me about it.” His hands moved down Dean’s sides again, his fingertips barely touching his skin as he felt gooseflesh beneath them. They stopped at the curve of Dean’s ass, gently resting his palms on each side of his wonderful butt.
A steady stream of moans and whimpers were coming from Dean as Castiel forced him to endure his tongue eating him out with the grip on his ass and enjoyed the feel of the slackened grip of Dean’s sphincter from taking him and the taste of himself coming from it. Knowing that Dean still carried his essence inside his body, that he was still marked from the inside, and that only he and Jimmy had the pleasure to enjoy Dean like this, finally satiated his possessiveness.
An almost naked Dean sat in the middle of it, a soft blanket wrapped around his hips that hid his lower part from their eyes. His back was turned to them but when Jimmy stepped inside fully and closed the door behind himself to stay next to Cas, Dean turned his head to the side and looked at them over his shoulder, his smile dazzling and wide.
I really like this one but beware of very NSFW art. 😉
Cas nodded, “Yes, he told me that.” Now his thoughts strayed towards the conversation he and Jimmy’d had that night.
With a small chuckle, Dean teased, “Is that so?”
As he moved to fuck himself on Jimmy’s cock, Dean couldn’t keep from teasing them in any way. Even as he moaned, Dean’s eyes sparkled with humor, a feral edge to the grin he sent down at Jimmy over his shoulder as he rode through his own desperate thrusts, taking Jimmy in hard, long rolls of his body. And alright, Jimmy enjoyed being in control, found out he truly liked being dominant and the way Dean submitted to them, but the way Dean fucked him like he owned him right then was really doing something to short circuit his brain and he invited it happily, letting Dean have his dirty way with him until his eyes rolled back into his skull and incoherent words left his mouth in a stream.
– Dean was. And when Castiel took off his own shirt and shifted a bit so that he had a comfortable position between Dean’s spread legs, Dean let his hands wander all over his upper body, traveling up his arms, to the center of his chest and down his stomach. His hands kept wandering then and Castiel realized that Dean liked to touch and to be touched,
“Jimmy, I…” Dean seemingly searched for words to say since his mouth opened and closed. “You and Cas… you make me feel special. This changes things…”
It was a rainy day outside, the wind turning occasionally so that the rain splattered against their floor-to-ceiling windows and caused a gentle
After that, Cas concentrated on his task again, held as much of each cheek in his hands as he could, and began moving his boyfriend’s globes in circles at which Dean let out a long moan. Grinning, Castiel spread his cheeks apart to reveal his rosy entrance and bent down enough to exhale slowly right above his hole and let his hot breath hit his rim. The green-eyed let out a shocked gasp at the feel of it and Cas circled his spread-apart cheeks again, before letting them fall back together and shielding his hole.
“I have to send it in until New Year’s Eve. So I’m finishing it now. I wanna be able to enjoy the holidays.” Dean just hummed, so Sam kept talking. “Besides, I like to finish tasks like these as soon as possible so that I have enough time to still change it should I have more ideas or want to go about it entirely different. And I still have enough time to read it over before sending it in.”
Dean’s voice was low and raspy and Jimmy grinned at his antics. Whenever the blonde wanted to start sooner as planned or had a particular wish, he would use his hot, sensuous body and most seductive voice to convince them. And it worked.
and he realized they have started a bar fight. Seconds after that, his brother received an equally hard punch to his chin and Sam watched, helpless, as Dean took another swing and put twice as much strength behind this one than he had the first time, going for the guy’s left eye.
Relaxed and happy like this, in all his naked and oily glory, Dean was more than just mesmerizing. He was drop-dead gorgeous and breathtaking.
“That’s good, yeah. I can do that. I’d love to do that,” Dean seemed to talk to himself so Jimmy merely watched him with a soft smile. “Would you want to… you know, would you like to watch it?”
After another disconcerting pause, Dean let out a sigh and asked, “What’s possibility three?”
Without knowing what led him to do it, his thumb caught on Dean’s rim as it circled it for a moment and tugged on it, the sensation sending pleasure up Dean’s spine and he gasped. The reaction was beautiful and Cas suddenly wanted to make him giddy with lust, so he let his thumb tug at his rim once more and Dean moaned, pressing his face into Jimmy’s chest and arching his spine.
With a careful hand on his chest, Castiel guides Dean back onto the bed and positions him on the mattress, making sure he’s comfortable, and then hooks his fingers underneath the elastic waistband of his shorts. Before pushing them off, he searches Dean’s face for any indication of discomfort or defiance, but as soon as Castiel sees that there is absolutely none, he takes off the last piece of cloth that stands between him and Dean and adds it to the pile of clothes near the bed.
“Nah. Couldn’t sleep. You?”
So far, he had managed to fall asleep without alcohol, even if it had taken him hours, and he wanted to keep it that way since it was only one more night before he would take the car and leave this town at six in the morning. Then he’d take a motel room for a few hours once he’d reached half the way to Cali to get some shut-eye before he’d drive the rest of the way to his brother and boyfriends to start his new life.
That was also how he’d gotten to know what she did professionally, which explained why she’d known all those things about him and had somehow gotten his phone number without asking Jimmy or Cas about information on him. Though, that didn’t make it any less creepy – knowing she searched the whole internet for his personal information and number. He still didn’t want to ask what else she had found along the way. But he trusted her enough to let it go by now and he knew he didn’t have to be someone else around her, just like one should be able to around family. And Dean was more than grateful that his family had grown by three people, making it six now, himself included.
Dean’s blush deepened and he met his eyes carefully. “You’d do that?”
Behind them, Castiel seemed to be infected by it just as much as Jimmy was and he laughed as well, turning towards them from where he stood at the kitchen island and staring at Dean with a fond expression that screamed
on Netflix while thinking about the amazing sex he had had with Jimmy and Cas the night they had visited the sex shop – of course, Cas had made him test a few of the toys they’d bought.
The blonde didn’t answer, didn’t even seem to acknowledge him, and the closer Jimmy came, the clearer it got what was happening. Dean’s breathes came harsh and fast, sounding alarmingly trembling – even though he obviously tried to tame it in – and his chest heaved dramatically, his body shaking. Seeing Dean panic like this never ceased to affect Jimmy, and he furiously blinked away the tears that were threatening to spill over at seeing his boyfriend in such a state.
He truly detested them.
Castiel swallowed thickly and his eyes glistened suspiciously now, as he sat up straight with his legs crossed and elbows propped on his knees, hands dangling. “I ruined things with Dean, Jimmy…” his voice was shaky and quiet, raw with emotion. “I-I may have ruined what we have with him and I-I…” He searched for words, his mouth opening and closing a few times, but came up with nothing.
“Do they know about each other dating you?”
Jimmy pressed his lips down on that smile to taste it and asked, “Why’d you do it, though? I mean, not that it wasn’t the best surprise in the world… I was just wondering,” as soon as they parted again.
“No more freak-outs, I swear,” Dean confirmed, laughing softly, and Cas just couldn’t believe his luck when he met those green, green eyes and felt like melting away.
Sam manages a small smile, still a sad one, and says, regretfully: “That sounds like something Dean would do. You had to be important to him as well, then.”
Then he started kissing around his crotch and groin, softly tickling his testicles with his fingertips to spur Cas on even more. Due to the water running down on them, his cock was already plenty wet, but Dean still managed to make him slam his fist against the wall next to them to steady himself as he stuck his tongue out and took a long, teasing swipe across his tip, making sure to dip his tongue into his slit and tasting him before moving to wrap his lips around his head.
Cas chuckled, lightly shaking his head and saying, “No, I think we got that covered by now,” while walking towards the door where he had put the bag next to it when he’d come in.
and Dean’s cry of agony rang in Jimmy’s head, jolting him awake from the dream with a loud gasp that left him sweating and panting, his heart going a mile a minute.
They kissed again, this time with tongue, and their noses pushed into their faces as Jimmy pressed Dean’s pelvis flush against his hips, which the blonde used to grind against. When he felt the smile on Dean’s lips, Jimmy broke the kiss and warned, “Don’t tempt me.” With a mischievous smirk, Dean pushed his crotch into Jimmy’s once more and he pulled at the ring in front of his collar with his finger to draw him close to his chest and rasp, “That’s just another reason to give you a nice spanking, Dean Winchester.”
“I didn’t want you to see me like this, so I asked Sam to help me.” Dean’s voice got even smaller, quieter, and Jimmy wished he could stop making him sound like this.
Chuckling, Jimmy said, “You’ll have to teach me that. I get the feeling that he’s into dirty talk…”
“Something on your mind, Dean?”
He leaned into Dean’s side, brushing his bottom lip against his boyfriend’s ear to make him shudder, and whispered, “Stand up, dear,” then watched with satisfaction as Dean got up off the bed and turned to stand in front of them. With a big smile, Castiel turned to Jimmy, asking, “Would you take care of him? I have an idea,” and started to loosen his dark blue tie while his eyes were laser-focused on Dean’s. The eye contact the blonde just had with Jimmy was now between them and Cas loved when he got Dean’s undivided attention.
“Yeahhh…”
He’s ripped out of his reverie and brought back to reality, when Dean suddenly flips him onto his back and straddles his legs, leaning down with a shy smile and taking Castiel in hand. He lets out a loud moan at the firm grip with which Dean lines up his cock with his mouth, parting his lips and locking eyes with Castiel to make sure that this is okay. All he does is nod his consent, trying not to lose his mind at the way Dean stares up at him through his thick, long lashes.
“G-green, Castiel,” the blonde managed to say after a beat.
“Yes,” Cas said, dead-serious, and made Dean burst out laughing and Jimmy chuckle. He was done running the lines down the backs of Dean’s thighs, his left leg already tied off and finished, and now mirrored the same on the right side by holding the rope in place and going all the way around the thigh with the end of the rope, then bringing it through the line he was holding in place and going all the way around the thigh again, this time the other way around. He did this once more, then tied it off just like he did on the other side. “Okay,” Castiel announced once he was done completely, taking a step back and looking at his handiwork, “You’re all done now, Dean, but I want you to test how it feels first.”
It didn’t take long for a waiter to come and take their order and soon after, they had their drinks served. Dean chose a soda, which Cas found surprising, and he didn’t want to be the only one drinking, so he got a non-alcoholic beer.
playing on TV – because for Dean, it was a Christmas movie, no matter what others said.
Grinning widely, Dean mused, “So thoughtful of you,” and met his brother’s eyes for a moment. Then, he started rubbing off the sand from his feet – that were certainly as ice-cold as Jimmy’s – to take on his shoes and socks again and Jimmy followed suit to prevent getting a cold. Or, well, prevent anything other from happening. It was probably already too late to hope getting out of this without the sniffles.
Smiling, Jimmy returned the greeting and grabbed his toothpaste as well as a toothbrush and watched as Cas did the same. Then, the two brushed their teeth in companionable silence until they finished and grabbed their towels to dry their faces.
“You gave me pleasure like no one else before, ‘cause I can assure you that no one ever managed to make me feel so good, that I came four times in a row. And yeah, it was taxing and it took a very long time. And yes, I said ‘yellow’ to get another break, which I did, because you’re a good and loving and caring Dom. I flinched back because my fucking mind threw me back to that one time I said yellow to Michael and he slapped me across the face for it. It wasn’t because I was scared of you or your reaction. I know that you would never hurt me and I realized that in less than a second after my reaction. Do you understand?”
With a heavy sigh, Dean met her gaze and said, “I dunno…” He even managed to shrug his shoulders enough for Jessica to catch the movement.
At first, Michael met his eyes with questioning ones, not knowing what Dean was asking, before, a moment later,  pure horror crossed his features and he assured, “No! No, God, no I didn’t!” As if he hadn’t tried and succeeded kissing Dean without permission, as if he hadn’t used Dean’s inability to fight back to open his pants and slide a hand into his underwear to touch his most private parts. As if he hadn’t been close to freaking raping Dean – someone he’d known for almost two years. “I swear I didn’t. I’m so sorry, truly.”
. It told everyone that he belonged to someone; to Jimmy and Castiel.
was the reason Cas came into his pants like a premature teen, but if that wasn’t the most arousing thing Dean had ever seen… His Dom still dressed in a white button-down shirt, dark slacks, and his fancy shoes, writhing against his bare foot as his sperm soaked his pants and tinted them even darker at his groin while Dean was sitting in only his thin, green panties and coming to the sight of it, his dick throbbing.
“Yeah. Okay.” A tiny smile graced his lips as he took the napkin and looked at him. “You have a pen?” Jimmy was surprised that Dean wanted to do this the old fashioned way instead of just typing it directly into his cell, but nodded and reached into his bag and handed him a ballpoint pen he carried around everywhere in case he needed to bring something down on paper. When Dean opened the cap and set the lead down on the napkin, Jimmy gave him his number. He watched Dean write the numbers down, the pen looking delicate in his hand, and then he scribbled Jimmy’s name underneath in neat, bold letters with a slight right slant. On the other side of the napkin, Dean wrote down another number and ripped the sides apart, handing Jimmy the pen and number.
Benny had been picked up from Sam to stay at his place for the night since he’d wanted to give them, especially Dean, some space. The younger Winchester had been understandably worried and scared for his brother when he’d arrived at the police station. But Dean had asked him to wait with his questions until he was ready to answer them and Sam had understood his wish, seeing how tired his older brother was.
“Mouth,” was all Jimmy said in return, grinning in anticipation.
Leaning in, Jimmy whispered, “It was freaking amazing, Dean. Thank you so much for it,” before pressing a quick kiss to his lips, smiling fondly.
“I never do, Cas. It’s just… it makes me feel bad, like I’m not equally there for you. I just don’t ever want any of you to feel left out, and I kinda feel like I did that to you today.”
A tiny, almost imperceptible, loving smile crossed Castiel’s features and he nodded. “Yes, that’s Dean: always thinking about the people he loves first. And I know what the problem is, Jimmy.” With the hand still resting on Jimmy’s shoulder, Cas slowly guided him back towards the bed and made him sit down on it, admitting, “I should’ve thought this through… And I apologize for not explaining this to you sooner, but you have to listen closely now.”
Thinking about it, Jimmy admitted, “Yes, that doesn’t seem so cruel. It’s more personal, you know. You take care of the Sub with your hand, control the sting and everything…”
“But that feels wrong.”
He knew that if Cas used his gravelly and deep voice just right, the raven-haired would have him on his knees in no time. And Dean was more than ready to let Castiel do anything he wanted to him. That was just how deeply involved he already was, which made Dean an emotional wreck as soon as he had time alone with his thoughts. It was the first time he had ever gotten that involved with anyone and Dean merely met Castiel twice. Though it felt like he knew him his whole life…
Dean first met Jimmy’s eyes, then Cas’, and nodded in acceptance of their words before shifting slightly. The movement reminded Castiel that they were still connected to each other and that he was still hard and aroused, even though it had been forgotten about for a while. The blonde shot him a suggestive smirk before whispering, “I love you both, too.”
This was the first time Dean had ever heard Sam say that. He always assumed that his brother had it easy, what with his smarts and talent. He always had a bunch of friends and girls wanting him and as the genius he was, he had every door opened for him to have a bright future. If anything, Dean thought he had all the reasons to feel like standing in his brother’s shadow but that was never something that he thought about. All that ever mattered was his baby brother’s happiness and Dean had always been proud of Sam, no matter how stupid and insignificant he felt next to him. He never had a reason to feel the need to compete with Sammy.
When they were done, they set the bowls down on their plates where they rested on the round coffee table in front of them and snuggled back together to watch some more TV and revel in their closeness. Jimmy wrapped his arm around Dean’s back to keep him close against his side, his head resting on his boyfriend’s shoulder so that he could nuzzle his neck if he wanted, while Cas had his left arm wrapped around Dean’s middle to hold him tight and rest his hand on his belly where his fingers splayed out across the bared skin where his shirt had tucked up and stroked it gently. Dean’s head was cocked to the side so it could rest on top of Castiel’s and in those positions, they kept sitting there and relaxed just for a while until Dean’s legs started to get fidgety, which told them that his anticipation and excitement for their scene started to get too much and he suddenly sat up straight with a wicked smile gracing his lips.
Dean took a while to answer, throwing glances at Jimmy a few times and grinning mischievously, before he leaned in so that the tip of his nose almost touched Cas’ and locked his eyes on Castiel’s very intensely. “I want it in the morning, so… let Jimmy do to sleeping me whatever his heart desires. Give me a good reason to wake up…”
The next morning, they had to be ready to be led to the front again, preparing themselves for weeks without any real sleep or rest and gunfire, death, and screams.
The next time Jimmy blinked, a tear was pressed down his cheeks and Dean grasped his face in his hands, cradling it tenderly and leaning in to put his lips on it and kiss the tracks away. He placed another kiss on Jimmy’s forehead and whispered, “I love you.”
By the time they had to stop in order to breathe, Cas was sweating slightly and his cock was almost half hard in his pants, hoping Dean couldn’t feel it yet.
Even now Dean seemed to like the way his leg was bent and maybe it was because of the prospect of deep penetration and the right angle for nailing his prostate that made him smile slightly or merely the fact that he knew just how much of an impressive ability it was. But then Jimmy got in position behind him – his ass hovering above Dean’s left thigh, his legs caging Dean’s body, knees at chest level, where they were bent for leverage – and pressed the blunt and leaking head of his cock against Dean’s entrance and put enough pressure into his hips to push inside, ridding Dean’s face of his self-satisfied smile. Even though they always prepped Dean enough to take him easily, the blonde was still unbelievably tight when they entered. It still didn’t cease to fascinate Cas every time and by the way Jimmy bit his lip and closed his eyes, he had the same opinion on it.
Maybe he was just a little afraid.
He watches as Dean tries to smile somewhat reassuringly, but it crumbles and he ends up looking more sad and tired of the world than Castiel has ever seen. It hurts too much to bear and he has to get up and put some space between them. Looking at everything but Dean, Castiel asks: “do you wish for anything else? Should I tell Benny to come here… or do you…” he loses his train of thought and lets his eyes take in Dean’s form for a second, then starts to walk towards the door.
The paramedics had immediately performed CPR on Dean on their way to the hospital and had gotten him intubated as soon as they arrived. Because Sam had had no idea what was going on with his brother, they had told him about Dean’s fatal alcohol poisoning and that his condition was bad.
When Dean smiled at him again, Castiel felt dizzy and this time, it had nothing to do with him being slightly drunk. He wasn’t even truly drunk yet, just a bit buzzed.
Before he started to pull out and thrust back in, Castiel let his gaze wander over Dean’s flushed skin again, taking in the, at once, pleasure-depraved and relaxed expression on his face. Dean met his eyes then and Cas felt his heart jump painfully at his beauty. “God, Dean… You’re beautiful. This is amazing,
The way Dean smiled at him cockily told Jimmy just how much the blonde knew what he was doing and he felt a sudden rush of heat down his body. He coughed to hide his arousal and took another sip of his coffee. Now he wished he had ordered a cold soda. Jimmy wasn’t typically like that when it came to people he felt attracted to, he would be relaxed and open and he would make sure the other caught his attraction towards them, but it was entirely different with Dean. At first, there was this storm of a man, kissing him like no one else before – and, God, he was an amazing kisser and Jimmy didn’t even get the chance to return and deepen it – and then he got all small and shy. But there was nothing of that now. The shyness and stiff posture were gone and now, there was this flirt sitting in front of him and Jimmy was just overwhelmed. He thought that this might be who Dean was. This was how Dean acted in front of everyone, who Dean chose to be in public. But, thanks to Cas, Jimmy knew better than that and realized that, while he really liked this Dean, the one he saw before all nervous and shy was actually the true Dean. Maybe not true, but closer to his submissive side, even though that was just sexual.
Jessica waited for him to continue, but nothing came, so she carefully prompted, “But?”
“Well, we didn’t want you to fall asleep before we could make you feel good as well,” Jimmy smiled and crossed the space between the door and the bed in a few strides. When he reached the end of the bed, he grabbed Dean’s legs and opened them wider so that he could fit in the space, musing, “After all… you’re still hard from the shower.” There was a smirk on Dean’s face as Jimmy placed down between his legs, his hands resting on the tops of Dean’s thighs and his thumbs stroking the tender skin there while he stared his lover into the eyes. “You wouldn’t want to sleep like that, would you?”
“Yeah?” Castiel pulled down his pants completely and took off his shirt, bending down over Dean with his now naked body to slide his arms underneath him. “What do you say, we take a bath, and afterward, you can nap for a while?” Dean nodded vigorously instead of a verbal answer and Jimmy chuckled as Cas adjusted one arm at Dean’s back and the other underneath his thighs to lift him up off the bed and pull him against his body protectively. “Okay, come on.”
Their eyes met again, this time with such intensity, that it left Castiel breathless as he stared into the endless green of Dean’s orbs, and his cock gave a twitch of interest, hardening even further in his pants and filling out against Dean’s bare foot. “You’d love that, wouldn’t you?” The blonde smiled mischievously at Cas’ aroused expression, his irises probably swallowed up completely by his dilated pupils, and teased, “You’d be so turned on, I guess you’d not even be able to finish reading one sentence before losing control and start fucking my face…” Bending his toes to graze the soft fabric of Cas’ slacks where they tented visibly, Dean mused, “Oh, imagine warming both you and Jimmy at the same time… one with my mouth and the other with my ass. You wouldn’t last three minutes.”
“I’m here,” Dean assured as he stepped into his line of sight, framing Castiel’s face with both his hands and resting his forehead against his, “I’m here, I’m good.” His breath fanned out against Cas’ lips and it was reassuring enough that he allowed himself to close his eyes for a moment, trying to calm his racing heart.
“Maybe just a little,” Castiel answered in a quiet, sleep-roughened voice. He snuggled closer to Dean and brushed a strand of hair from his forehead, smiling. In the morning light, his hair and his skin glowed goldenly and his soft smile was so dazzlingly beautiful, that Cas was glad he was laying.
When he heard the clicking of two balls colliding, Dean was pulled out of his reverie and watched as Jimmy sank one of his balls, though that didn’t change the fact that he still had more on the table than Dean. There was a smirk on Jimmy’s face when he looked at him, placing down his cue stick and saying, “I’ll go take a leak.” He met Cas’ gaze and asked, “Could you bring me another beer, please?” before turning back to Dean and pointing a finger at him teasingly, “Don’t you dare try to cheat while I’m gone.”
And just like he said, Dean was completely quiet save for the whimpering, moans, and yells leaving him whenever Cas hit home extra hard. And Castiel, he was like a force of nature behind Dean. It was like he went wild just feeling his boyfriend without any barriers and Jimmy could relate to that. Dean did feel absolutely mind-blowing without a condom.
To Jimmy’s surprise, the blonde obediently crested into his second orgasm, moaning lowly as his cock spilled hot cum onto his belly once again and his ass visibly clenched around Castiel’s moving shaft. The spasms of Dean’s body around him from his orgasm were probably what pushed Cas over the edge as well, and he stilled his hips with his cock deep inside Dean and cursed as his release was milked right out of him.
And even though he was very much aroused right at this point, he’d also learned what Dean needed in a partner and knew that he’d never be enough for him. And honestly, that was okay. Dean had found two wonderful men that cared deeply for him and loved him so much, that Benny was sure they would never break apart, no matter what the future might hold for them, and he was happy for them, genuinely. He’d always keep Dean as a dear friend, and that was enough and all that mattered to Benny, especially now that he’d found someone for himself as well.
“It’s just a job, you’ll find one here. Sam would be extremely happy if he got to have you around again. He misses you deeply. Can’t you see how happy your staying here makes him?”
Dean was very close now and when Jimmy started to grip his length with one hand to glide it up and down, his foreskin moving with Jimmy's palm, starting slow before jerking Dean fast, Cas placed his hands above his chest and slid one over to Dean’s heart. He could not only feel his chest rumbling with moans and other sounds of delight and pleasure, but also the steady and fast, hard pounding rhythm of his heart. Dean’s entire body was flushed and if it wasn’t for the massage oil, his body would have glistened with sweat all the same.
The fact that he had said ‘yellow’ had worried Cas enough, but the reaction had made him want to stop the scene altogether. But he had been alright and so had Dean and he didn’t see a reason to stop and risk upsetting Dean, though thinking about it now made Cas question if he had made the right decision.
At that moment, he’d been grateful that Cas had given him eye contact restriction with everyone but his Doms because he’d been sure that one look at their amused or judgmental faces would have had his shame written all over his own, reddened face.
They woke up with tangled limbs and cuddled up together, Dean as always in the middle, and Cas never felt so ready to face a day.
After a while, both of them had been cracking jokes like never before and laughing their asses off until their bellies hurt. And then they had discovered that their neighbors had switched off the lights and left the living room to go upstairs. Sam didn’t remember whose idea it was, but one of them had the brilliant thought to go there and watch some TV. So they had climbed into the house through the window, after they had waited a bit for them to fall asleep, and turned on the TV. And the first thing they had seen was the ‘Now I have a machine gun. Ho-ho-ho’-scene and so they had just lingered there, watching a movie in their neighbors’ house like criminals. He still remembered how exhilarating
Grinning, Jimmy stood up and reached for Dean’s hands to tug him off of the bed and help him stand as well, turning around and watching Castiel with expectant eyes, who started chuckling and left the bed, too. “You’re eager,” he noticed, raising a suspicious brow at his twin.
“Hmm,” Cas hummed, resting his chin on Dean’s shoulder to stare into the drawer. “Is this what I think it is?”
“Oh, well. Jimmy, Cas, and I have decided that it would be best if I only drink when they’re with me or when I have their permission to do so. Y’know, ‘cause of my past…” he shrugged, trying to get a read on Sam’s expression.
“Why not?” He pulled out agonizingly slow until he was halfway out, then pushed back in just as slowly as he insisted, “It’s true. I’ve been dreaming of this, imagining this since I laid eyes on you at that party. Having you spread out and bared underneath me, letting me do whatever I want to you… pleasuring you.” Castiel didn’t know why he was still capable of speech when his voice was that wrecked and low and his body shaking with pleasure as he pulled out and then pressed back inside again.
The blonde snorted in amusement and teased, “Your dirtiest fantasy was to fuck my ass with a popsicle in a public space? That’s naughty.”
“Hey,” Dean whispered when they parted to take a breath, slick lips brushing. Behind them, Jimmy leaned in and placed a few kisses to the curve of Dean’s spine, then the dips of his hips, and the blonde smiled, closing his eyes.
Meeting his eyes with disbelieving ones, Dean said, “Of course not, Sam!”
Smiling softly, Cas walked towards their boyfriend and Jimmy watched as he took Dean by the hand to guide him towards the bed where they have already spread the rope. His hair was still a bit damp and darker but he smelled fresh and Jimmy smiled as they stopped in front of him, leaning in to give him a lingering kiss.
He smiled at the cockiness that had somehow found its way back to Dean during his break, even though it was only there much too short before the Sub flopped back down on the mattress and stared up at him with open and ethereal green eyes. “Are you ready?” Jimmy asked to assure himself of Dean’s well-being and grinned when the blonde nodded and bit his lip, whispering, “Yes.”
at the sight of it. His irises were darker now, moss green rather than spring, and Castiel got so lost in them, that he didn’t notice they were dancing at first. Dean was right – it was easier – and he smiled brightly at him. “I’m dancing.”
“Tell Gabriel we owe him a favor,” Cas said, meeting first Jimmy’s, then Dean’s eyes where he lingered for a moment. There was a small, content smile on his beautiful lips and Dean wanted to kiss it.
After that, they speared a few marshmallows on their sticks to hold them into the fire and talked about their favorite snacks and meals. Time went by faster than ever and soon, they were interrupted by a loud bang as suddenly, red and green lights exploded in the sky above them and they realized with a start, that it was already midnight. They clinked their beers together as more fireworks followed, one after the other, and wished everyone a happy new year, laughing and smiling together and Jimmy was so happy, he felt tipsy.
When he reentered the bedroom, Dean was already kneeling on the floor in front of the bed, his head bowed slightly, and hands resting in his lap. He was so stunning, that Jimmy’s heart did a somersault and he had to refrain from kissing every part of his beautiful body as he closed the door, his eyes never leaving Dean. The blonde’s chest rose and fell in a slow rhythm, his breathing deep and calm as he waited for Cas, and Jimmy couldn’t stop himself from pressing a kiss on top of his head, into his hair, before taking his seat in the chair and waiting for Castiel as well.
When the first rush of arousal and adrenaline was gone, Jimmy managed to turn it down a notch and savor the way Dean’s lips slid against his in a velvety glide and how Dean held on to his bottom lip every time Jimmy’s lips threatened to pull away, trapping it between his own.
Her eyes landed on Dean’s silhouette, perched on the edge of the bed as she closed the door almost inaudibly. His elbows were propped on his knees and his face buried in his palms, looking generally hunched in on himself.
It was completely silent in the room, and Castiel didn’t know what to feel. He was sad that Dean had to experience something like that, mad at this Alastair for using him in such a twisted way, and devastated that their boyfriend thought it was all his fault.
Smiling triumphantly, Cas pulled Dean open even more with his thumbs and placed another kiss on top of it just as gently. At the following kisses, Dean’s body relaxed after having adjusted to the sensation, but Castiel didn’t want to stop there yet, no.
Then, Jimmy positioned himself in front of Dean, standing above him and shielding him from Cas’ view, who could either try and see through Jimmy’s parted legs or watch his clothed back, so he decided to just rest his head back and relax. The new angle, though, made it possible for him to see Dean’s face between Jimmy’s legs and when he turned his head to the side and looked up, he had a clear view of what was going on, so he then decided to just watch.
Next to him, Dean shifted in his hold, mumbling something incoherent, and Castiel turned his face to look at his stirring boyfriend. Jimmy was already awake and he smiled softly as he watched Dean blink his eyes open with a groan at the bright daylight coming from all around them, bringing a hand up to caress the side of Dean’s face while Cas just stared at them.
Still, after a moment, Dean’s face turned serious and he said, “You know I would
He was doing the buttons on his shirt cuffs when Jessica walked into the room and closed the door behind her. Dean’s hands caught her attention and her eyes were suddenly fixed on the wristband he was wearing. It was not the first time she noticed it and when she had gotten a better look at it last night, Jessica realized what it meant and had this sudden urge to talk about the state of his face with him.
type of person… just instead of ‘love’, it’s a ‘fuck’.
Castiel is certain that it is possible to die of heartache because he feels like that his happening to him.
“I almost ruined
To come to the idea that a man like Dean, who came in with two other men that were obviously his dates, would even want to consider hooking up with this guy was ridiculous. And of course, Cas knew that he didn’t want to be sexually harassed every time he left their place. He also didn’t want to make out with assholes like that, not in his past, not now.
And once the blonde was all warmed up, Castiel pressed the end of the crop against one spot on top of Dean’s left buttock and kept it there for several seconds, then, without a warning, gave the Sub a lightning-quick
Dean merely smiled at him lazily but mischievously at the same time and Cas pecked his lips once more before taking a step back, no matter how much his body protested the thought. “Smells nice. What is it?”
fucking hot.
Jimmy tried to defend his actions by mumbling, “It just feels too good to press up into your ass, clothed or not. If it bothers you, though, tell me. Then we’ll make sure that only Cas ever spoons you.”
“Shouldn’t the question be who doesn’t? Because there’re a lot lonely people out there.” He grinned and Cas merely rolled his eyes. They couldn’t be more different than that. Jimmy was a ‘love ‘em and leave ‘em’ type, he liked having company to make him feel good and he was very open with his sex life, whereas Cas had to have a deeper and emotional connection to his partners to even want to be intimate with them and when he had sex, it wasn’t the conventional type – he needed someone to submit to him, someone who would trust Castiel to take control.
And with that, the blonde was engulfed in a lung-crushing hug as Castiel wrapped him up into his arms and held him close, while Jimmy bombarded his face with affectionate kisses, again and again, making Dean chuckle softly.
Dean’s eyes flew open at that and he turned to look at them, even though he still avoided their gazes, hurrying to assure, “No! God, no. I don’t. Why would I? You did nothing wrong.”
his mind.
Throughout all of it, though, Dean got more fidgety from minute to minute and Sam wondered why. He was constantly looking at Cas or Jimmy before seemingly checking himself, always deep in thought. Apparently, it wasn’t anything bad, though, because Dean was still engaged in the conversation and laughing. Would it really have been anything bad, he would have zoned out on them entirely.
” Jimmy grinned wickedly at the moan that was rumbling in Dean’s chest as he clamped his hand around his lover’s right thigh, feeling the cilice through the fabric of his pants and digging his fingers further into it, though not enough to truly hurt him.
Jimmy had to smile every time he thought about those couple of minutes and remembered how painful it had been for Dean to walk with his cock still hard and left on the edge by them. His gait had been extra bow-legged and Jimmy had had a hard time keeping from wanting to be between them so desperately, that he hadn’t been able to stop himself from wishing they’d finally find a spot to make Dean take off his clothes already. All throughout those ten minutes, Jimmy had been wanting to make Dean lose every inhibition he ever had and didn’t care if any of those other people here caught him doing so.
Once they both adjusted to the feeling, Jimmy pulled his hips back again only to thrust back inside, setting a harsh pace as he fucked Dean deep and good. The force with which Jimmy was pounding into him set off fireworks behind his eyes as his head pressed back into the mattress as much as it could with his mouth falling open while silent moans and whimpers left his lips.
