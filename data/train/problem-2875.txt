Cas knows what everyone else thinks about the two of them, so he’s probably just trying to play the part, make it seem like they actually have a relationship like Dean let them believe, and save his ass from looking like an idiot.
“Leave me alone, Novak”, Dean nods towards the other end of the wall, “Go and paint that end of this stupid wall so I can suffer my punishment in peace.”
The kid waves a hand in his direction to snap him to reality,
Dean hears Cas sighing when he stops to stand next to him, “We have to go home.”
Dean smiles. “Yeah, they’re good people.”
“I left you my number”, she says, not even offended by how clearly Dean didn’t even remember her name, “I had to run, but you said you’d call.”
He’s gotten surprisingly much done in an hour.
“Let’s make a sand cake”, Dean suggests and instructs Jack to shovel the sand into the bucket he’s holding in his tiny hand. Jack gets the idea quite fast and soon they’re surrounded by sand cakes, smiling proudly at each other.
“But we—”
“Yeah, kid, it’s
Jo doesn’t seem to be too mad about it anyway. “Whatever. Where is he anyway?”
Jack is completely focused on the TV again as a new show is starting.
Before he even gets to, Dean’s already coming back with a washcloth. He hands it to Cas, who takes it and wipes the mess from his stomach before throwing the thing to the floor to be tomorrow’s problem.
“Wow”, Jody says, and then, “I’m sorry.”
“Trust me”, Cas deadpans, “I would rather sleep poorly than listen to you whining about your aching back all through Christmas”, he gets up, ”Where’s the bathroom?”
she asks, not buying it. Dean hears keyboard clattering from Charlie’s end, and inaudible sounds from her talking to someone else.
They’re both a bit out of breath after the short match, Dean can feel the fast rise and fall of Novak’s chest underneath his hand.
“Popcorn is a typical movie food”, Cas argues.
He grabs a beer from the bucket of ice she’s put them on display in, but he puts it back when Cas side eyes his choice.
Sam almost takes the picture, but lowers his phone before he does, “You’re still kinda missing the vibe Charlie mentioned.”
Castiel is not only gorgeous by the looks, but he is also funny in a way Dean thinks most people would underestimate and really clever and always getting into conversations with Dean, showing interest in everything they talk about, no matter how mundane it is, or something he know nothing about.
“Yeah”, Dean agrees without giving much thought to whatever the man has said.
“Okay”, Dean settles, “But we’re gonna have to figure out how to keep it away from your face, kid. You can’t keep running into furniture because of that hairstyle.”
“Go say bye to Cas”, Dean tries softly, but he doesn’t meet either Cas’s or Jack’s eyes.
“Fine!” Dean throws his hands in the air, “Jesus Christ, aren’t you sensitive this morning…” he mutters to himself as he leaves the room, closing the door behind himself.
“I know”, Dean says.
“Then what did you mean?” Cas asks simply, putting his cigarette off in the ashtray on the table next to him and grabbing his empty cup from there. He turns his focus back on Dean, continuing before he gets a chance to answer, “I’d rather have you not trying to sleep with my friend”, he sneers, “because from what I saw, you got that already covered for the night.”
“It seems so”, Cas says and moves to sit on the couch, “I think it’s only fair. We did interrupt something he was in the middle of, apparently.”
“Can’t believe that from our little angel”, Donna coos at Jack who has a perfect timing to smile at her. “See, look at that cute smile!”
He shows some of the covers to the kid who either reaches to grab the book from him instantly, makes an almost disgusted face paired with a firm “No!” or just ignores him.
“I’m just super tired.”
He’s about to walk over to tease her about it, but before he can, there’s someone stepping in front of him, getting his attention.
Their conversation switches to the day behind them, Cas talks about the crazy shift he had, Dean tells about the day he had with the kids, about the crying about nougat and the principal’s office, and the look on Claire’s face when she finally found the right toy.
Dean lets him wear all of them to the store, just to get out of the room quickly before Cas starts stripping again.
“That in the middle of all this mess, I managed to fuck up so bad that I fell in love with you?” Dean finishes for him, giving him a sarcastic, tight lipped smile, “Yeah, pretty much. And it
, Jack settles on two sets of hair ties.
“I thought maybe you needed the twelve hours”, he says, nonchalant as he takes the pancake from the pan.
Dean reads in a high-pitched voice that earns a giggle out of Jack, “this porridge is way too hot!”
Meg gives him a pointed look, “You forgot to mention your co-daddy is serious eye candy?”
“Wow”, Cas gets to say, when Jack takes a breath, “Those are—wow.”
They obviously want someone they know well, because neither of them wants to give Jack over to a complete stranger. The first one they think of is Sam, so Dean gives him a call.
Cas closes the blanket door carefully, and goes around the fort, lifting the blanket and crawling inside, leaving himself out from the waist down as he lays there on his stomach, propped up on his elbows.
Cas grabs the phone from the counter and turns off the screen. “Nothing.”
He walks closer to the living room window, trying to get a look at the driveway to see what kind of shitty car this dude drives. He’s sounded pretty boring in Cas’s descriptions of him, so he’s probably driving some eco-friendly sensible piece of crap.
“Stop being a horny drunk, Sammy, that’s disgusting”, he mocks, and Sam lets go of Eileen to shoot his brother a bitchface, to which Dean only answers with his best ‘annoying big brother’ smile.
His phone makes a quiet sound on the floor, vibrating against the wooden floor, and with a groan, Dean pushes himself up a bit, reaching towards the jeans he abandoned next to the bed the night before.
“Maybe we should wait at the office”, Dean states, embarrassment on his face as he glances at Bobby, muttering, “Shouldn’t bring him here.”
Yawning as well, Cas makes his way to the kitchen, hoping that the fridge has ingredients that inspire him to cook something easy and fast.
The words are out of his mouth before he even registers he’s the one speaking.
“You say that too!” she points out, quite loudly too. Dean gives an apologetic smile to some woman walking past his car before looking down at Claire again.
He figures he’s just overly tired after a few wild nights with Jack and tries to forget about it.
As if on cue, Jack wraps his hands around his leg, hugging it as he looks up at Jo from behind Dean, like she’s the scariest thing in the world.
Meg catches him when he’s trying to sneak his way back inside.
Dean laughs at that, “See you around nine tomorrow”, he chuckles before hanging up, right in time when Bobby opens the office door to nag at him to quit chatting and get back to work.
smile at that, giving him a firm, serious look. “
he can’t keep reliving his own childhood through Jack, not one bit of it.
That gets him a dirty kitchen towel thrown at him by Cas.
Jody stays with him since Owen is still enjoying his time there, and she and Dean move to sit at the edge of the sandbox for Jack to play in.
about it. “We are the parental figures for him, so it makes sense he has learned to use a word like that.”
The tension builds as they stay silent. Cas is waiting for him to give a proper answer, but eventually gives up waiting and with a disappointed sigh, turns to leave the kitchen through the back door.
“Clearly. You have a hickey”, Cas points out and Dean lifts his hand a bit to shoot him a confused look. Cas taps his own neck from the spot where Dean has a faint red mark.
Dean likes hunting. He likes the practical work, hunting down some evil sons of bitches and chopping heads, saving the day. Give him something to kill, someone to chase him, the fear for your life or whatever, he’s fine with it. What he hates are these slow cases where stupid people get their hands on stuff they don’t understand the dangerousness of, and they have to go through the trouble of stealing something and going undercover.
Cas is there to be the serious killjoy he always is.
Except it’s not a fucking home, it’s a house of his dead best friend, where he’s supposed to live and take care of her child, with a guy he’s not a fan of, who definitely doesn’t enjoy his company either.
“You’re disgusting”, Cas deadpans, holding a hand over Jack’s ear, “Don’t listen to him, Jack.”
Dean doesn’t get to enjoy the warmth of the thought for too long, when he spots a tiny amount of blood on the corner of the kitchen table, and the sick feeling in his stomach is back instantly.
Jo reads the situation somehow right, when she opens her mouth, “Cut the guys some slack, Donna”, she says and taps something on her phone, “They’re having a lunch break.”
Cas watches him drive away before he opens the front door, and quietly gets in.
Cas is still holding his hand.
Charlie holds back a grin, “I’m pretty sure Dean had a huge crush on him like years ago”, she reveals, and Cas hopes his expression isn’t as dark as he feels. “He never admitted, but I just knew”, Charlie doesn’t seem to notice anything weird in Cas, because she’s so into getting to gossip, “but nothing ever happened, and then they just became really good friends.”
But when he saw Cas lying there, unconscious, it’s like all his training and previous experience on the job was gone, and he was left with no ability to think logically. He lost his head on the job, because the short thought of possibly losing Cas got to his head.
“Now you just put the coins in and press start”, Dean says as he stares into the blue eyes.
many days.”
new chapter where cas goes on a date, and dean has issues with rebecca rabbit. jack continues being cute.
Cas gives him a guilty nod, “So much.”
“Thanks, Cas, that’s the sweetest thing you’ve ever said to me”, Dean mocks because the alternative would be too embarrassing.
She gives them a moment to think about it before she continues, “This is a situation no one can prepare for, so it’s understandable you need time to process it all.”
“So no, Cas. I don’t hate that it happened.”
She does seem quite young to have a kid that old.
Dean barks out a humorless laugh, “Yeah, me too.”
“So you’ve heard him say that before?”
Even if he’s getting quite decent at this parenting thing in general, actually going to a playground with other
It’s already dark when Dean parks the car and nudges Cas awake before opening the car door. Cas gives him a confused look like he wouldn’t remember where he is for a second.
“Jack said shit!”
He pretends to take a bite and checks his watch, “He’ll be here any minute. You should pour him a cup of coffee ready.”
“That’s when I first thought about it”, Dean elaborates, scratching the back of his neck, “That maybe— maybe I have some feelings for you.”
“Stop staring”, Sam calls them out without turning to look, and the two force themselves to sit on the kitchen table, to keep themselves from stalking.
Of course it’s not that simple, and Dean should’ve known that.
With the deepest frown on his face, he frustratedly throws the toy at Cas who happens to stand closest to the doorway, the plastic toy figure hitting him to his legs before it drops to the floor. Cas, with his everlasting patience, picks the toy up and quickly figures out what’s wrong and takes the half-removed helmet from the toy dog, handing both the helmet and the figure back to Jack, who runs away.
Or how Cas pinches the bridge of his nose when he’s frustrated, how he rolls up the sleeves of his button down when he comes home from work. He sucks at cooking but he’s a nerd when it comes to coffee or tea, and Dean can’t even begin to describe his taste in movies because it’s just so random.
Dean forces himself to
“Shut up, you’re going”, Dean argues instantly. Typical Cas to not want to cause any trouble.
Cas cut his sarcastic tone off by taking a step closer, his voice louder than it was before, “I did it because I was scared, Dean!”
Dean gets experimental in the kitchen and Jack gets more open to the idea of actually tasting the food before throwing it to the floor. It gets easier to notice the slight change in Jack’s behavior when he starts to get tired, and with that naptime gets easier. He still wakes up during the night, crying and it eats them all up inside, to the point that one night, Dean silently hands the kid to Cas, grabs the car keys and drives to his apartment.
“No, it’s not that”, he says, and Cas lays down back again, waiting for Dean to continue, “I usually sleep in the middle”, he clarifies, hoping it doesn’t sound pathetic when he adds:
“At least I didn’t fall in love with Jess while washing my dirty underwear.”
Dean is confused for a second, but the blue eyed idiot manages to make him laugh. He can’t help it; when he lets the first chuckles come out, he can’t control it, the embarrassing loud, full on head thrown back laughter is out and this messy haired, blue eyed idiot managed to get it out of him.
“What is it, Dean?”
Dean rolls his eyes, flicking his gaze at Cas, “This won’t take long!”
If Cas wants to fight, he won’t be the one to back out of it.
Dean just shrugs at his comment, not knowing what to say to that. “Too bad you missed Jack, kid got so tired of all the people Cas put him to bed earlier than usual.”
And from there, they start to talk about everything, jumping from subject to another and always continuing where they left off the last time.
dean becomes a playground parent
Dean turns to grin to Cas, “I told you it’s a costume party.”
Dean sits down on the toilet seat and guards the shitty, cut in half bracelet he gave to a three-year-old, just because the child ordered him to do so.
Dean nods, pretending to agree once again, before hooking his arm through Cas’s as they make their way towards the redhead.
“You know what I mean”, Cas says back with a sigh.
“That’s your kid?” he asks, nodding towards the picture and Cas hums an affirmative. Mick doesn’t ask about the third person in the picture, and Cas wonders if he should explain.
“I’d do what he says”, Charlie tells Cas, “He can be really stubborn if he wants to.”
“I wouldn’t want to make things weird—”
“It means I have standards”, Cas says, blue eyes cold as he squints.
“My dad—”
“Yeah.”
Dean’s ready to tell Sam to fuck off and then leave himself, but suddenly there’s a hand on the side of his face, fingertips grazing his cheek and
“I can imagine”, Cas says, filling the sink with water, rolling his sleeves up as he waits for it to fill, “You better get used to it, I have a feeling we’ll have that thing there for a long time.” His hunch is supported by Jack’s excited sounds as he plays in the living room.
Cas lifts the box and the takeaway cup in his hands, “We come bearing gifts to show our gratitude for the lunch in the fridge.”
He gives himself permission to touch Cas a bit more. They’re already really close with each other as friends, but now they touch more frequently than before. Small, brief touches come so naturally in different situations Dean almost stops thinking about it.
Cas smooths a hand down Jack’s back. “Did you have a bad dream?”
“Cas—” he starts, but doesn’t know how to continue, and Cas is gone anyway, out to the backyard before he could figure out what to say. Whatever.
Dean watches Cas as he grabs the coffee mug and takes a long chug of the drink, even though it’s probably still quite hot. He’s glad Cas keeps his eyes closed while he enjoys the drink, because it allows him to stare.
“He really thinks I can’t handle it?” Sam wonders, but it sounds like he finds it funny more than offensive.
“I don’t wanna sleep in your room”, Jack frowns, “I like my own room.”
“You, after you’ve cried in the shower”, Charlie answers Dean’s question. The man grabs a beer from the fridge and shuts the door with his hip.
“I don’t”, Cas says, not looking at him as he brings the cigarette to his lips, inhaling the smoke. He tries to blow it away from Dean, who is smiling down at him when he finally agrees to look up.
“Dean.”
Dean stares back at him for a moment, thinking about what he could say to that. Eventually he decides he doesn’t really want to say anything and turns to put the key to the lock.
“Yeah. And then just t-shirts, whatever you can find in the laundry.”
Bobby sends him on a longer lunch break when he gets snappy for the hundredth time that day, muttering something under his breath while he does. Dean takes the break as free time to sulk in the office and maybe take a nap.
“Stress at work?” Mick asks, and quickly explains his question, “Anna said you’ve had some issues with the funding for the project.”
Dean hooks the backpack to his shoulder and walks over to help the kid. He carefully opens the rusty door, and picks Jack up. “Think you could drive it all by yourself?” he asks, “I’ll wait right here.”
the frown of genuine confusion in Cas’s tone,
“Miss MacLeod, pleasure to see you here.”
“Yeah”, Dean says, lifting his head, “It’s just—you know, when I saw him there I just—I couldn’t think, I—" he runs a hand over his face, “It was a standard gig, and I just lost it. Couldn’t do my damn job.”
Kelly ignores their bickering looks, like she usually does. She places a hand on her stomach, caressing it, “You’ll see”, she smiles, “Jack will teach you.”
“No!” Cas almost shouts, now as annoyed as Dean, “Not until you leave this room.”
Dean drops the keys to the side table by the front door, explaining something on his way to the kitchen, stopping abruptly when he notices Cas is not alone.
While he’s waiting for Jack to get the first one ready, and the kid tells him he should do something too, Cas takes a piece of cardboard and absentmindedly doodles something on it.
The candy bar Jo’s about to take a bite of stops right before it reaches her mouth, “You aren’t?”
“And I told you I believed you. We also covered the fact that you weren’t crying, it was allergies.”
“What?” she shrugs, “Don’t tell me he wasn’t at least mediocre.”
“I’m not—” Dean doesn’t finish his sentence, just rolls his eyes at Sam’s grinning face before grabbing the keys from his hands and heading out.
“I’ll drive you to work.”
Charlie rubs her hands together, “Okay, let’s get to it! Who’s got a first?”
“Hi, Cas”, he mutters back with a quick, tight-lipped smile.
“That’s right”, he agrees with the kid, nodding firmly as they smile to each other, “The most important.”
Jody says, and the calmness in her tone makes Dean less self conscious about his mild panic.
He doesn’t look awful when he’s a mess, but he definitely looks good now, even if he doesn’t look like his normal self. And Dean can think like that, because he has eyes.
on it but didn’t bother learning the letters that come after the first one and just rolled with it.
“Sam’s right, we should go”, Cas agrees with him.
The shouted demand from the living room snaps them back to earth, and chuckling quietly, they let go of each other.
The thought of having sex with Dean has crossed Cas’s mind enough times to confirm his attraction towards the man is getting out of hand, but it’s not the only thing he’s jealous about when he looks at the man being busy flirting with other people.
The kid looks like he’s handed him the moon and cherishes the worn out, braided thing with love and affection. He even makes sure the long strings, that he refused to let Dean cut off, don’t dip into his soup during lunch.
Benny nods, “Only going to speak nice things about you”, he promises, mock-sincerely this time, “Tell them you’re playing hard to get.”
Cas gives an evaluating look at Jo’s work, “But it is a bit uneven.”
Dean gives another hopeless look to Cas, and Cas blames his tiredness of it, but he just shrugs. “You’d fit there”, he says.
“Honey, did you get the fish?”
“It wasn’t that expensive”, Cas says, “And it was your day off anyway.”
“Hi Bobby”, Dean smiles. It hits him right there just how long it’s been since they’ve seen each other, when Bobby pulls him in a tight hug, patting his back with a strong hand, like he always does.
Cas lets out the deepest sigh Dean’s probably ever heard, and he has no idea if it’s a good sign or not.
Dean enjoys the peace he’s found in himself as things just… Continue being good.
Dean’s eyes grow three sizes when he turns to look at Cas, and his hand on Dean’s. Cas gives his hand a squeeze. “Honey?” he repeats.
Jack’s frown deepens.
They wait there, pinned against each other, for a moment to make sure the guard has walked far away enough to not hear them anymore.
All their kids are already old and brave enough to play on their own, but as the snack break is done and Dean’s sent his thank you to the higher powers that made Jack actually eat his food, he’s happy that the kid is content to play right next to the table so he’s able to stay with the adults.
“The best kind of crazy”, Dean corrects, wiggling his eyebrows. He holds back a whimper when Cas, the pincher, pinches the skin on his wrist.
Dean’s always had a habit of forgetting his bracelets everywhere around the house where he just happens to take them off, and he’s always finding them in random places around his apartment.
“Just say yes”, Kelly laughs, and Dean realizes they never gave an answer.
Short period placements sound more expensive and complicated than someone in the family just taking a kid, so Dean sees behind this woman’s polite smile.
What the fuck was I supposed to say to that?”
“And you go away.” It’s not really a question, just a sad observation, “You always go.”
The utterly hopeless look Jack gives him is heartbreaking. Cas glances up at Sam.
When they finally arrive at the pickup point in the school yard, oil stained book in Claire’s backpack, Jack is already waiting for them.
Charlie holds her hand up, ignoring him, “Are you saying that you two slept together and just… are not going to talk about it, ever?” she asks him, like he’s stupid, “What are you, idiots? You have a kid together!”
“What?” Cas shrugs easily, “I wasn’t the one driving.”
, Cas!” he shouts, and Cas shuts his eyes like it would prevent it from being real. Dean shakes Cas’s hand off himself, “Kelly’s gone!”
“That darn girl”, Donna sighs and glances at the direction where the other kids are, too far away to hear them, “She’s a six year old teenager”, she states, “I thought I would have a few more years to prepare, but based on the emotional meltdown I had to witness this morning, oh boy.”
He hated going there, he hated the smell of the place, he hated the waiting. Dean could use the time to study, but usually he ended up watching Netflix from his phone.
Dean turns around, pressing his head down. “Turns out we’re not the only ones on the job.”
“You know what, I think I’m just gonna head home”, he announces and drinks the rest of his beer in one go.
Dean curses in his mind, closing his eyes, because there’s no way he’s singing
he chooses to be there at that time because he actually wants to see Dean as well, and it kills Dean not to know which one is it.
“Where’s Cas?” Jack asks, resting his head against Dean’s shoulder.
For the first time in a few days, Cas is sleeping on his bed alone, lying in the middle, almost asleep. He’s shaken out of it by the light from the hallway as his bedroom door is pushed open.
Cas bites down a smile, “I won’t if you give me one as well.”
“You’ll see him in the morning”, Cas assures, “Good night, Jack”, he wishes and tries to tuck the kid quickly back under the covers, holding in a groan when Jack ignores him and sits up.
The hangover definitely dampens the mood of the kiss compared to the ones last night, but that’s not the point, this kiss is perfect in a different way, with a bad morning breath and a promise of something starting.
“Besides”, Dean continues, turning it around, “Don’t act all single to me. How’s Andrea?” he asks, and as a fond smile grows on Benny’s lips at the mention of her, he has to tease just a bit more, “When’s
And then,
But naptime comes eventually, and after two books, they happily sleep on Dean’s bed together, getting the much needed rest after an hour long play with the toy animals.
“Uh, I think I’m gonna skip”, he says as he looks back into the brown eyes, “I think I’m just gonna head home.”
trust you two to make great choices”, Dean assures jokingly.
It takes a minute, but soon enough Dean’s at the door as well. He crosses the room and sits on the edge of the bed as Jack’s eyes light up and he climbs to his lap. Half asleep, Cas looks at the sleepy look Dean has with his hair pillow pressed and college pants on. His outfit looks so quickly thrown on Cas wonders if he sleeps naked, which is a thought very out of place.
“Hey, Jack, we’re leaving!” Dean calls, “Wanna say goodbye?”
He’s worried it will get awkward now that he stopped it like this, but then Cas is yawning, and it catches him too.
“Shut up”, Dean mutters, causing Cas to frown. “I was talking to the bitch in my ear”, he explains, once again ignoring Sam’s groaning.
“I didn’t know you have a—" she starts, looking at Dean, eyes hardening. She frowns to herself for a second, “Wait, we met—" her eyes flick at Jack again quickly, before she looks at Cas.
He can’t help the smile that grows on his lips as he hears the two talking about something, the voices muffled a bit by all the layers of fabric. He walks over and knocks on one of the chairs gently, prompting a small gasp out of the two inside. Dean is asking Jack who might be at the door.
“What do you want to watch?” Cas asks as he switches to Netflix with the remote, not taking his eyes off the TV.
“Good”, Dean breathes out and lets go of something he didn’t even realize he was holding inside, “Good.”
Jack climbs down and says he’ll grab some more toys from his room, running away and leaving the two alone for a moment.
works alone. He must’ve gotten help with that one, there’s no way he got the ring alone and made it out alive. Whatever, they have two, he only has one. “Show off.”
Dean looks slightly puzzled, “What do you mean?”
“I am already digging this place and we haven’t even got to the food yet”, Meg says without taking her eyes off the direction the waitress disappeared to.
”, he continues, following Cas to the kitchen, “because you can’t murder me in front of a child.”
Cas takes it off for him, holding his head in place with one hand and removing the pin with another, his movements much gentler than Jack’s had been when he’d put them there.
“You’re staying with Sam for a short moment”, he explains, “I’ll go to work, and Dean picks you up in no time.”
“In my ear”, Dean answers, ignoring Sam’s “
Cas notices Dean facing away from them at that. He clears his throat. He doesn’t have an explanation that would be understandable and satisfying for a three-year-old.
of knife”, Dean corrects, and puts it away, “I’m not gonna serve our friends fucked up food, if we can be proper about it.”
“I’ll make the call.”
Jack might’ve given Dean the perfect way out of that phone call with Sam, but it came with shitty consequences, because it’s been almost two hours, and the kid’s still not down.
Dean looks up at Cas, waiting for him to protest or say he should go to his own room or something, but Cas just shrugs. Jack gives the empty space next to him a pat, inviting Dean there.
The thing is really, Dean doesn’t want to run out of pie on Christmas, but he always makes sure he bakes too much, so that there’s enough for other families outside of his own, because if it was a thing, him baking for the event, Bobby would make him take them there himself and he doesn’t want the fuss of the thank yous and all.
He jolts to sit, and checks the time. Fortunately for him, Cas is super early with his messages, and he still has time. He’s not home but he’s pretty sure the apartment he’s in is close to the bar, based on the vague memories he has of coming in here.
“Should we get some snacks?” Dean asks while he browses through the store's selection of sweets, “We could watch a movie tonight.”
If they would’ve thrown a party like this few months ago it would’ve turned into dead bodies buried to the backyard for sure, but as things have gotten so much better in such a short period of time, Dean’s positive about tonight.
Dean glares at the muscles of Novak’s arms, where they flex when he moves his brush up and down, when he finally arrives next to him. He tries to get as much paint on the brush as he possibly can, in favor to save him from walking back and forth.
When Dean opens his eyes, there’s a bright white light on top of him, hurting his eyes so much he has to close them again for a moment. The amount of cold lighting and the steady beeping coming from a machine to his left tell him that he’s in a hospital. There's a dull pain on his stomach, radiating to his right side, and he can feel he's bandaged up, but his head feels fuzzy enough to ignore it, which is probably thanks to painkillers. He'd say he'll live.
“Yeah, maybe I should”, Cas snarls quietly, but so close he might as well brush the words against Dean’s skin, and it wouldn’t make a difference.
“Dean. If you’re the boring dad… Does that mean I’m the fun dad?” he turns to ask him, tilting his head a bit, a drunken but thoughtful look on his face.
He can’t read the expression on Cas’s face as he processes his answer, but eventually the man just nods and gives him a tight smile before rushing out.
“—Look me and Dean went to the store and there was Peppa and, and Dean got me these and there’s so many, look this has yellow and this has so many colors—”
Oh, the things you do to get laid.
He’s just angry and annoyed, because Dean gets on his nerves so often, because he’s annoying, he’s being weird about this situation with Mick, he’s an asshole, but somehow it’s—Cas doesn’t have words for it, so instead he just runs until he can’t anymore.
Phone tucked between his ear and shoulder, he stops dead on his tracks when he hears someone crying on the other end.
“Why didn’t you call me?”
Cas is already staring at him with an expression Dean can’t really name. Dean expects Cas to comment something jokingly, but he doesn’t. Instead, his lips curve slightly into a smile, but it’s not an amused one.
“What’s going on?” the younger man asks, squinting his eyes at the blushing brother.
Dean shoves him away, but Cas stubbornly grabs his shoulder again.
“I have my boyfriend I could do that with”, Dean counters as he takes the remote to channel surf. Cas lets him do that after all the suffering, and because he wasn’t really paying attention to the show that was on.
“But I wanna see him”, Jack insists weakly, eyes getting more demanding. He really got used to getting them both putting him to bed apparently.
Dean puts his own hat on and levels Cas with a look. “It’s Charlie’s birthday party”, he deadpans, “Trust me. It’s a costume party.”
Cas frowns, and his expression is shifting into the one he has when they argue, “I know that, Dean. Is it a problem that I’m going out tonight?”
Cas puts the sleeping child down on the couch and considers his options. He could wake him up and have him angry about it, or he could let him sleep and have him wake up on his own, but angry anyway because he’s too hungry, since it’s been hours from their late breakfast they had right before leaving for the library.
Cas gets himself to move. “Dean”, he says, the demanding tone of his own voice surprising even himself. He grabs Dean by the shoulder, turning him around before he reaches the magazine table.
“I’m really tired after this week”, he explains with an apologetic smile.
“Both of you!” Dean says, voice tired, “Language, please.”
Jody places a hand on his shoulder, and he looks up at her. She places a coffee mug in front of him.
Maybe it’s the early spring sun, but Dean has a faint blush on his cheeks.
“Nerd”, Dean says, but he sounds more affectionate than he aimed for, “When’s your birthday anyway?”
a bit.
“Uh, could you give us a minute?” Dean bargains, offering another smile. Cas stares at him with a frown when Dean pointedly glances down. “We were about to…” he gives the guard a knowing look. “You know?”
“Maybe I should.” Cas reaches up to meet Dean’s kiss, grabbing his arm to pull himself properly up to get a better access to his lips. When he’s sitting up, they awkwardly shift around, finally cramming themselves to lie down again with Cas half on top of Dean, one leg between his as the kisses, while still slow like they got all the time in the world, start to get more heated.
He can feel Cas’s curious eyes on him, but he keeps his focus on Jack.
He’s about to look away, but something catches his eye: Cas reaches forward, holding that guy by the arm as he pulls him into a kiss.
trying to set us up on a date, are you?”
Dean turns his gaze away from Cas like a coward.
Luckily, if they get all four of them, Sam has found a spell that can be cast on them to take the power off, but it requires all rings in the fire at the same time, hence the long and frankly boring case.
“If this is a bad time I underst—”
Cas can’t be too mad about it really, looking at the two being genuinely so happy about their little fort. Jack explains excitedly all the things they’ve done there today, Dean nodding along, confirming his stories, and prompting Jack to tell more.
“Why?”
The man shoots an annoyed look at him, raising his brows expectantly.
That one Friday of scheduling problems was only the beginning of a whole new mess of things in their life with a toddler.
, Sam chuckles, the traitor. Who chooses an annoying, weird, dorky guy who insists on working alone, over their own brother?
Dean says something that makes the kid giggle, and they talk for a short moment before Dean probably tells Jack he has to get back to work, because the kid answers with, “Okay! I miss you!”
Cas sleeps in on accident and ends up running late, nagging at Dean the whole time he runs around the house to get his things, like it’s his fault that Cas hit snooze too many times again.
Their noses are brushing, and Dean keeps his eyes closed when he breathes the same air with Cas, and it all feels so unreal that a quiet chuckle escapes his lips.
“Oh my God, Dean”, Charlie groans, dropping her head to her hands, “Are you seriously thinking that?”
“Everything okay here?” Dean asks and lands on the couch, turning on the TV.
It’s easier to blame Cas than to face his own stupidity anyway, because that’s what he really wants to ignore; not only the fact that he let his feelings creep up on him, but he let himself believe those feelings could be reciprocated.
“Yes, it’s—getting better now, hopefully”, Cas says, even if it’s not true. He hasn’t really been thinking about work, and even if he was, they’re still not in the clear with bureaucracy around the situation Mick’s referring to.
“No”, Jack says and turns his head slightly to the left, peeking at Dean, who quickly shows the carton of juice.
“Speaking of wing manning… Is Jo getting her own envelope?” Dean teases, and Charlie turns almost as red as her hair.
“Mick”, he gets out, “This is a surprise.”
“So that’s what you think I do with my free time? Hook up?”
Cas bites his lip before answering. “It’s packed”, he says, shooting an annoyed look at someone passing him close by, making him step closer to Dean so that the person won’t crash into him on his way past.
“Jack, I have to tell you something important”, he says, watching as the kid’s eyes turn curious. This won’t fix all of it, but it’s choosing different, choosing to do something no one ever did for him.
That’s the expression Jack gives to Cas when he stands on the living room doorway with his jacket on.
Dean’s literally hard in his jeans, hands on Cas’s ass, the man on top of him leaving kisses on his bare skin, but they still find the time to
“I don’t like this”, Jack states and puts the piece of steak he’s grabbed back to the plate, after taking the tiniest bite of it. He spits the piece to the plate as well, and Cas is clearly holding back a grin when he watches Dean’s heart crumble into pieces.
“Eat”, he demands, nodding towards the plate when Cas doesn’t do anything else but stare at him. “It’s pancake time”, he announces again, “We can’t leave this table until we’ve finished all of these, right, Jack?” he asks, smiling to the kid, tickling his cheek a bit and it gets a giggle out of him.
“Hey there, Jack!” she beams and Dean can feel Jack pressing more firmly against him. “Did you have fun with Dad at the sandbox?” she asks, probably just to talk about something to be friendly.
He glances next to him, and Novak looks right back at him. They are pressed close, arm to arm and the laughter slowly fades away.
Jack is happy to see Cas, and climbs to his lap.
At some point during the evening Cas has sent him a text saying he has to stay overtime because they are understaffed, and he’s the only doctor available.
Cas lets out a breath, like it’s the best thing he’s ever heard, “Really?”
“Are you suddenly not going to work or what?” Dean asks, snapping him into reality with his demanding, annoyed tone, “Because I’m not listening to you bitch about being late if you sleep in on your own.”
Last night, when he was still drunk, Cas had thought what a horrible mistake this had been, but that regret is nothing compared to the tight knot sitting heavy in his gut right now, as he looks at Dean. He wanted last night to happen, for sure, but more than that, Cas just wants to be able to lay back down and curl up beside Dean.
“And I do want to hear Dean’s funny sounds”, Cas points out.
Cas would think the situation in his boxers would've gone away with the unsexy environment and the amount of embarrassment, but somehow he’s still as hard as he was when he woke up, the ghost of dream Dean’s touch on his skin still.
“Do you think she’s single?” Charlie asks Cas, leaning against the counter with a calculating look on her face.
Cas leans away from him, all the way against the armrest of the couch, rolling his eyes as he throws his legs to Dean’s lap, “Aren’t you lucky, I’m jealous”, he deadpans, “My boyfriend’s an idiot.”
“I miss her.”
“Toys at the table?” Dean observes amusedly, raising a surprised pair of brows at the sight.
Dean gives Cas a moment to read through the invitation.
Without saying another word, Cas steps out of the room, closing the door carefully behind him.
“Okay”, Cas just says, smiling, “Today’s movie was good.”
Dean arrives in time for the bedtime, but the damage is done. Secretly Cas enjoys the fact that it lands on Dean to deal with, when he’s listening to the two of them fighting in the bedroom so loudly he can hear it all the way to the kitchen where he’s working.
Something in Dean’s head just disconnects, probably.
“Just the basic one, something quick”, he says, without looking away from Dean.
Most of the attention revolves around Jack anyway, so it’s not even that bad. There hasn’t been a proper moment that would’ve required any kind of communication between the two since the party started.
“Dean—"
Something that shifted days ago, now changes completely.
It’s just pie, not world peace.
Fortunately, Jack yawns, getting tired even if it has been quite a show so far. He falls asleep before the story is over.
Dean slips under the covers while Cas struggles with the jeans that eventually come off, and he gets under his blanket as well.
He met Lisa’s parents once half on accident, when they were visiting her, but Dean never asked her, or anyone else, to join him here.
“Seriously, guys”, Sam laughs.
When she finally finds the one though, and it’s the last one at the end of the shelf, almost hidden, Dean thinks it’s kinda cute how she wanted to get her something she really knows her best friend wants, and didn’t give up until she got it right.
him and his crap, there’s Jack who loves him but doesn’t put up with his bullshit. It doesn’t feel like it’s gonna fall apart any second.
“And I get that, it tastes like ass”, Dean agrees, “but you know what we did?”
Dean changes the channel when there’s another commercial break on the screen, “What if I didn’t want to wear a tux?” he asks, just to mess with Cas.
. It’s a good folder, and he uses it almost as much as
“You can’t be here when Jack wakes up”, Cas explains.
They’ve gone through this, they’ve done their research and are as prepared as they can be, all that’s left is actually doing it.
”, Cas starts, closing his eyes and looking like he’s counting down from ten to keep himself from strangling him. Dean knows he’s already on the edge, but that hasn’t stopped him before either, Cas is just too much fun to mess around with.
“What are you talking about?” Dean asks, but Rowena doesn’t buy into his act.
There aren’t words for how much he wants to do it, but he can’t.
Dean swallows, “Maybe we should test that.”
“I don’t know if there is a heaven, or any other place you’d possibly be to watch over us”, he starts, “but, uh, in case you can hear me, Jack’s doing well. He’s growing so fast.”
He checks the pick up time he has arranged with the customer whose car he just got ready, to see if he has time to run to the store to get something to eat. Cas left for work even earlier than him this morning, leaving him with the kids and let’s just say fighting with Claire Novak and still managing to get both kids to school on time leaves little to no time for breakfast.
“You shouldn’t give him too much sugar, because it’s already getting late—” Sam silences his brother with a hand on his shoulder.
There’s a look on Cas’s face that Dean can’t read when he glances between the carton and him.
“I’d go crazy if it wasn’t for him”, Dean admits, “You know, Jack spotted this weird bug on our backyard, asked Cas about it, and the next thing I know, they’re googling insects, trying to figure out what the fuck it is”, he tells Benny before he can stop himself, “Took them like two hours.”
Jack’s exclamations get Dean’s attention, and he pushes himself from underneath the castle, sitting up on the grass.
Jack just stares at them for a moment, picking his nose as his expression stays neutral.
This is different, but it sucks ass just as much.
“No, it’s still working perfectly”, Cas answers, giving Dean his sarcastic smile, but it breaks into a genuine one when the man grins up at him, the corners of his eyes crinkling as he squints his eyes against the sun.
she tells him,
“It’s not bad parenting to take some time for yourselves, man”, he rolls his eyes, “And I’m not just saying this because of your weird beef with Cas but in general. Might do good for all three of you to get some me time.”
So, he can’t really blame Cas about his own, embarrassing feelings, but he can’t help the bitter feeling etching his gut either.
“Hey, Mick”, he greets once he’s inside and he’s closed the door behind him.
The clock on his phone screen says 7:54 when he runs from his car to the front door of their house. He opens the door to fully dressed Cas, with Jack in his lap. Cas hands him the kid the second he steps inside.
There are more papers to read through and sign, medical stuff and the cardigan lady’s evaluation of Jack. She is a child and family psychiatrist, like Dean guessed her to be.
They’ve fallen into a comfortable silence, but as Dean fills one small bucket with sand before flipping it over, Jody breaks the silence.
love it how my chapters get longer and longer, but i refused to cut anything from this so here's 9.4k of stuff! hope you enjoy! <3
Cas is standing in front of the huge mirror on the wall, holding one dress shirt in his hand and wearing another.
Dean is mostly silent too, but not like Kelly’s father.
breakfast. The memory of last night makes Dean lean forward and press his lips against Cas’s, his hand coming up to cradle the side of his face, feeling the stubble against his fingertips like he was studying it.
Dean ignores Cas’s slightly disgusted expression and bumps his shoulder with his own, “Look at you, cold-heartedly helping me ditch the ladies”, he teases, “Thanks.”
He has to buy a thermos, but he won’t be an asshole.
“What do you think, Jack?” he asks, a proud smile playing on his lips when he walks closer, gesturing to the construction behind him.
He puts it down on the table, fiddling with the straw, and for the first time after a short moment, he’s staring down instead of Dean.
“Okay?” Dean repeats, doubtful at the level of easiness.
Cas is usually away if it’s his night off, probably at his own apartment. If he’s at the house, he takes awfully long baths or watches weird movies in the living room while Dean reads the third book in a row in an attempt to make Jack fall asleep.
“Should’ve known he’s a perfectionist like Dean”, Jo rolls his eyes and looks at the others.
Offices have a certain soundscape, something that’s common in every office in the world.
“There’s no harm in asking”, Dean counters, leaning against the door frame of the laundry room.
“Why?” Cas groans as he pushes himself past Dean.
Dean feels the terror flashing his face, because he’s an asshole who literally has no other excuses in his back pocket but the being busy one. He’s desperately putting together a new one or trying to figure out a way to let her down without fucking everything up, like he always does. He’s an ass, so he has no idea why the fuck this chick would even want to see him again.
“Thought you found yourself a better bar.”
Dean’s not avoiding her, when he sees her coming back from the kitchen and he makes a beeline to the balcony before she sees him.
Now there’s a situation where the
“Or I swear to God you won’t walk out of this room alive”, Dean growls darkly. Looking surprised, Rowena actually drops her hand, letting Cas go. Cas falls forward as much as the magic bound lets him, breathing hard.
“Cas read that it reduces the stress of the child if the asshole he’s left with is not completely dumb”, Dean explains as they walk to the living room, where Cas and Jack are playing with some toy figures.
Dean swallows, the words drying on their way out of his mouth.
She’s a complete stranger to Jack and she did in fact speak quite loudly even if she meant to be friendly, Cas wants to point out, but the woman continues before he can as much as squint at her.
Dean knows he means the space on the bed, but something still flips around in his stomach anyway.
“Yes”, he answers but checks it from the calendar just in case. “Are you going home?”
He’s done surprisingly well with getting Jack out of the car and making his way to the front door without waking the kid up. Slowly, he puts the tote bags down, so he doesn’t drop them when he opens the door.
“What?” Dean asks, unbelieving.
“Oh, you didn’t lock the door”, he says, looking completely unbothered by the fact that Cas is still standing under the water.
He takes a deep breath and turns the car around. He drives home as fast as he can and still get there safely, waits for Jack to run inside to get his piano notes and drives him to the piano lesson.
“Dean!” Cas exclaims, like a greeting.
“Of course”, Cas says, “It’s my evening anyway.”
“Cool”, Dean comments, glancing up and smiling at Jack who’s pointing at the screen he’s standing in front of.
“I know we have been stupidheads lately, me and Cas”, he says, quoting Jack from one time he threw a major temper tantrum at them, “but we both love you so much, and that will never change, no matter what.”
“Do you get anxious in crowds or something?” Dean asks.
Jack agrees to eat his breakfast in such peace that Dean decides to take his time and make breakfast pancakes, even if it’s a Monday morning and pancakes have a Saturday vibe in them. He has a day off from work and the weather is looking nice enough, they all slept quite well, so there’s many reasons for pancakes.
." Cas tilts his head enough for Dean to see him squinting his eyes at him.
“No!” The shower curtain answers forcefully, tiny feet stomping behind it.
Dean sighs as he realizes he’s chosen the wrong friends apparently, “You’re nerds, both of you”, he mocks but doesn’t get an answer, “Whatever”, he mutters to himself, playing offended and makes a point of leaving the two in the kitchen to get dressed.
Benny agrees to that, clinking his glass against Dean’s. The beers are downed fast, and soon it’s time to do shots. As they get more drunk, the bar gets more crowded and by the time Dean’s got his arm around someone pretty, it almost feels like a Friday night.
“She’s Lisa. She asked about you when you arrived”, she fills him in like a proper wingwoman does.
“Tell me about it”, Dean mutters, fiddling with the controller in his hands.
Cas takes the short moments he can get, hoping that one day they could just be normal again.
Before, all they were trying to do was to survive from one day to the next without strangling each other in the process. Now that it’s too late and everything is fucked up again, Dean’s starting to realize the family the three of them slowly had formed.
“Probably not”, Dean says and opens the car door. “You know what we can do about it, though?”
Just ask him.” She shakes her head, “The fact that Cas hasn’t said anything to you is probably just him avoiding it just as much as you.”
“Why?” Cas asks, confused.
Dean waves him off, “He’s like that with everybody. He’s not a smiler.”
With Jack, back home.
Dean says back, and Cas can hear the fake smile on his tone.
Cas knows what he means by that, so he doesn’t have to elaborate, which is good because Dean finds it hard to put words to it, still.
“Like what?”
Cas is checking if the snacks on the table need refilling when Charlie walks up to him, waving a hello to him and Jack, who is eyeing everyone from the safety of the crook of Cas’s neck.
Donna and Wendy have to leave earlier, but Jack has some energy left in him, so Dean thinks it’s best to get him tired there, and he’ll fall asleep on the way back home.
, he had also been drunk enough to need help walking, so that could easily be something he’d regret now when he’s sober.
And it’s true, but the longer they stay silent after, the more it starts to feel like a lie. And while it’s not a lie, it’s not the whole truth either.
Dean is still outside.
Dean’s not trying to avoid this Lisa chick. He had approached the group of women when Charlie kept desperately signaling him to do so and chatted with them for a while. And he spent some time with Lisa when the group left them alone and had a conversation about nothing in general. She seems friendly and nice, she’s obviously hot and, based on Charlie’s intel, very bendy.
“You think they’re gonna keep him there for long?” Dean asks Jo and Charlie, “My shift ends in a few hours, should I call someone to be back at the apartment waiting?”
Dean answers with an unintelligible muttering.
“Just that it’s almost nine and you’ve got half a beer into your system”, Benny explains, nodding towards the half drunk beer, “Figured you’d be thrilled to be out on an actual weekend, going crazy with the booze and the beautiful people.”
Dean forces a joke out of himself because that’s the only thing he’s good at, “We’re not gonna cry now, are we?” he asks with a quiet laugh but doesn’t let go of Cas yet.
Cas is renting his apartment, and Dean has no idea if he’s keeping it or not. Bobby owns the apartment Dean’s rented from him, so he keeps his contract at least for now, since Bobby keeps the rent low and isn’t keen on finding a new tenant anyway. Dean has a hard time wrapping his head around the fact that this is a permanent situation, him being a guardian for Jack, and he feels like he’ll eventually return back home somehow anyway.
When Cas presses his lips to Dean’s hair, Dean can feel him smiling.
Cas gets up, something wistful in his tone when he quietly wishes Dean good night.
The most horrible part of it all is that all they can do is wait.
“Or on the table, I don’t mind”, Cas says so casually like he was actually talking about
Dean sounds weird, his expression holding something else too, but he usually finds it irritating if Cas tries to ask about it, so he doesn’t.
“Uh, no.”
Dean lets out a long breath.
“Wow!” Jack shouts, “I wanna go there!”
“I don’t want nobody to cut my hair”, he says.
sick a day later,” he finishes his story, “And I happen to remember it was January.”
Cas’s tone gets hesitant when he continues,
“I would also like to do more of that”, Dean states when he finally wraps his head around the fact that Castiel Novak just fucking kissed him.
He’s just feeling good and safe around Cas. He loves him, he loves their kid, this family they’ve formed. And that’s not to say there aren’t any crappy days or fights or sleepless nights sometimes, because of course there is.
“You are staring at me too”, Cas says, not even blinking, blue eyes intense on Dean.
“Thank you, I appreciate it”, Cas says, his voice still rough enough that Sam gently makes fun of it. The younger Winchester briefly goes through their evening which had been a very wild but a fun one. Cas gives him a short and vague answer when he asks if they had fun last night too.
He’s been with the kid for two days, and the topic of those days has been ‘Dean is better than Cas’, at everything. It started yesterday at lunch when Cas drew the ketchup smiley face on his plate all wrong, and Jack had refused to eat any of it and kept saying he wanted Dean there.
Cas wakes up laying on his stomach with a throbbing headache, feeling the cold sweat of the beginning hangover all over his body. His face twists with the pain as he lifts his heavy head from the pillow, to glance on his side only to find the bed next to him empty.
“You two are so weird”, Charlie smiles and puts the game back on, “I’m happy for ya.”
“Andrea is joining with some friends”, he tells Dean as he looks up from his phone, a smirk growing on his lips, “What do you say we get some shots before they arrive?” he offers, “They’re single, but they’re loud.”
After lunch they switch into their party outfits before the guests come. Jack has chosen an interesting combination of socks, tights
Cas chuckles, and the old memory floods out before he even realizes it, “I remember waking up one morning when Kelly—" He stops the second her name is past his lips, looking up at Dean, who is staring right back at him, mirroring his expression.
“That’s—would be nice”, Dean admits, nodding.
“Yes?” Dean says slowly, “I’m pretty sure I’d know if we’d be together.”
This has nothing to do
“I know, but I kind of changed my plan last minute”, she says, and it’s not uncharacteristic for her, “I want his godparents to be people who are close to me, and who I love and not just because we’re related”, she explains, “and if I’m being completely honest, maybe sharing that helps you two drop this weird beef.”
“It will be”, he promises, “Especially from a disposable plate that you’ve spent five hours choosing.”
He awkwardly opens a drawer to make it look like he’s actually doing something and not just hiding, but he’s doing it too late to make it look real.
“Oh”, Cas just says, “You have never brought anyone here with you.”
“Go have a cup of coffee or something, we got this”, he waves them away, “Right Jack?”
After the first time they do, and the world ends, that is.
“You’re welcome to visit any time”, he says, because he really enjoyed her company even for the brief moment. She seems the kind of person to make friends easily, and Cas learned a lot about her even in the short time. He turns to look at Dean, “Did you have anything that you need washed?”
The sun is out, so the three of them are out in the backyard. Dean and Cas are watching Jack drive some toy cars on the grass that’s gotten so long it gets stuck around the wheels constantly. His annoyance at it gives Dean an idea.
“No, Cas”, Dean holds his hand firmly, shaking his head. “Don’t worry about it. As long as you’re okay.”
He can’t help but think about that one time when Charlie made a comment about Dean sleeping with his friends, and if Benny is one of them. He doesn’t care, but he can’t stop thinking about it either.
The driver hums and comments something at that, before asking the exact address. Dean peeks out the window and realizes they’re at their street already and points at their house further down the road to the right.
Cas makes a gesture asking if it’s okay that he takes the call inside, and Dean nods, already heading towards Jack.
Which is a big mistake, because the way Cas looks like standing there, further down the hallway, makes him not want to leave but to lock the front door and live the rest of his life in this house with Cas and Jack.
That gets an annoyed sound out of the man, and he turns his back to Dean, wrapping the blanket tighter around him,
The note isn’t signed, but Cas of course knows who’s written it even without a signature. He smiles fondly as he runs his fingers over the messy handwriting, pressed to the thin paper so hard with a barely working pen you can feel the letters on the backside of the paper.
“We should just start feeding him in the living room”, Dean says to Cas.
He can’t make out the car in the darkness and with the reflection of the window, but he spots Cas and that Mick guy standing on the front porch, talking about something. He backs away on instinct, because he doesn’t want Cas to think he’s spying on him or some weird shit.
Cas rolls his eyes but chuckles and pushes himself up from the chair to head to the shower, and the situation is settled.
He drinks half of the coffee in silence while Dean finishes up with the pancakes. Dean turns off the stove and grabs the plate of pancakes, bringing it to the table, announcing it’s pancakes time.
“Choose something without wrappers”, Cas orders before turning around, probably to grab the popcorn from the other side of the aisle, leaving Dean and the girl staring after him.
Dean swallows, preparing to say something, but Cas keeps looking at him like
“Benny! You made it”, Dean smiles and pushes past the two in front of him.
