Tony laughed again. He couldn’t believe he’d been actually worried about tonight. About Steve not wanting him. Steve, who was now lying naked in his bed, pouting, demanding, begging Tony to do things to him. How did that happen? How did
He ducked into the nearest deli and sat down.  The waitress came over with a cup and a pot of coffee.  “Good morning, Mr. Stark.”
get pictures?” Tony asked, and Steve laughed again. That lightness he’d felt while Tony was inside him was still there. Stronger. And god, it just made him feel so good. So
For a moment, Steve seemed on the verge of saying something, but then he shook his head. “I don’t really want to talk about that right now,” he said.
with no problems whatsoever. So Steve just let him take over for a while. And it worked. It worked really well right up until the Wednesday in January when everything went to complete and utter shit.
to do that.  If he wanted to continue to exist, sometimes the thinking was unnecessary.  More--it was dangerous.
She smoothed her hand over his hair once more, kissed his forehead, then left. When she was gone, Steve touched Tony’s arm, scratched his nails up Tony’s back. “Hey,” he whispered. “Hey. Tony. Wake up for me. I’ve gotta talk to you.”
--of the cruel, hurtful thoughts he had about himself.  Steve with his warm words, and calming presence, and deep eyes, and sweet, soothing,
Tony stepped closer and Steve’s finger went through his belt loop.  He wanted Steve out of this chair more than anything, but a little part of him would miss this.  Standing over Steve, looking down at him, Steve’s head tilted up, his finger through the belt loop.  It was one of the good things--the only good thing--that had come out of Steve being confined like he was.
Tony took a step backward. He had to. If he didn’t, he was going to throw up, because right now, that scent and closeness that he craved was also making him sick. And wasn’t that the way it always was? The things you loved most were the things most toxic.
Tony sat beside him on the bunk and gestured at the room.  “Nice digs, baby,” he said.  “Really embracing that whole ‘prison chic’ look, huh?”
Natasha stirred fretfully beside him, a moan escaping her lips.  Steve looked down at her, and in an instant, it was gone--the power, the visions, the righteous fear--and it was just him again.  Just plain old Steve Rogers from Brooklyn.
“I didn’t kick you out,” he protested softly, and his hand finally slid under Tony’s shirt to touch his bare skin.  “You left.  And besides, you broke in in the first place.”
And then the kid smiled. And that was bad. Bad because it was so good. Something that Steve was afraid he would think about way more often than was healthy for him--or for anyone--and he tried to look away. Tried to think about something else. Work. He had work to do. This was a
When he trusted himself to speak, Tony said, “Okay.  That’s okay, we don’t have to talk about it right now.”  He put his hand on Steve’s head, running his fingers through his hair.  Steve stiffened beneath the touch but said nothing.  “Just come to bed, huh?” Tony went on.  “Come on.”
be, yes,” he said. “But a certain someone spent the whole night shooting daggers at him across the bar.”
The sheriff steered him away.  Tony followed, walking as far as the edge of the door.  He was still barefoot.  And it was still January.
, those pecs sparkling with water were a fucking wonder to behold--and take that from him too. “You won’t even come near me right now. You’re staying clear over there, as far away as you can-”
Also, I didn't proof this very well, so sorry for any typos. I guess that's the kind of gal I am too.
After a moment, she drew him closer and put her arms around his neck. “My sweet boy,” she said, and rubbed his back with the same tender strokes he remembered from when he was a little boy, sick in his bed.
. Not any more. And for one brief, intense moment, he let himself think about Tony. Let himself remember the way he looked in the sunlight, holding his hand at the lake house, lying in Steve’s bed, curled up in the sheets, the way he raised one eyebrow to punctuate a sentence, the way his hands moved so confidently when he drove, the way he tasted, the way he smelled, the way he felt beneath him, the way he said
He hung up the phone, and took a shower. Got dressed. He took extra care with that, making sure he looked as good as he possibly could. He wanted to look good. For Steve.
He knew he would. He knew he’d feel that warm relief flow over him the second he laid eyes on him. He knew he’d feel his muscles relax, his nerves ease, his headache go away. He knew that just being near him would be enough to erase everything bad this day had thrown at him, and he wasn’t wrong. That’s why he didn’t call him earlier. Because it was getting harder. Being with him, but not really being with him. It was getting harder to not touch him, not hold his hand, not kiss him. It was getting harder to not give him everything he ever wanted, take him anywhere he ever wanted to go, show him everything he ever wanted to see. It was getting harder to not wrap him in a bear hug and assault his face with kisses. To not fall asleep listening to him breathe. To not tell him he loved him in every language in the known world. To not show him in every way known to man or beast.
Steve nodded.  He forgot about the gray hairs when Tony set a steady rhythm with his hand.  He forgot even more when Tony kissed every inch of his neck, his chest, when he sunk his teeth into Steve's right nipple, then sucked lightly.  "Yeah," Steve breathed. The situation was getting urgent again. He was glad. "Yeah, Tony, that's okay."
Tony, on the other hand, fit right in. Steve watched as he made his way from person to person, a word here, a joke there. In his tailored tuxedo and impeccably-knotted tie, it was easy to see that Tony Stark had been made for this. Where Steve was stiff and shy, Tony was fluid grace and easy banter. He had a way of drawing a person in, and when his countenance fell on someone, they lit up from the inside. Steve had seen it happen--had been lucky enough to have it happen to him. Being seen by Tony Stark, was akin to being seen by god.
They ate at the restaurant, then drove home through the frozen dark.  Steve kept his head turned, eyes staring out the window, watching the shadows of the trees stream past.  Tony had the heater on, the stereo turned to some local station that seemed to have no real format, just playing whatever they wanted with no rhyme or reason except tonight when it seemed every song was a love song.  He made it through "I Remember You" and "Wild Horses" okay, and was on edge through "These Arms of Mine", but when they got to “Everything I Own”, Tony couldn’t stand it anymore, and snapped the radio off.
He lay there for another hour, then got up--slowly, so he didn’t wake Tony up again--and drug his clothes on in the dark. He found his way to the bathroom, peed, washed, and scrubbed a little toothpaste on his teeth. He wished he had his toothbrush. He thought he’d have to get one to keep here if he was going to be spending nights...and he smiled about that while he rinsed and spit. That was an interesting experience. One that, if asked, he never would have thought he’d have, but here he was. Smiling and spitting toothpaste out in Tony’s sink at five o’clock in the morning.
Tony kissed them slowly, then ran his fingers through Steve’s damp hair.  “Yeah, it’s okay, big guy.”
Steve slid out of Tony's hand and flopped down onto his pillow.  He was still hard, but the situation certainly wasn't as urgent as it had been a minute ago.  "So what?" he snapped. He wasn't sure why he was as irritated as he was right now.
Tony drew in a breath.  He blinked.  Something was dawning in his eyes, something like realization.  Steve didn’t look away, but a battalion of butterflies were suddenly loose in his stomach, flapping their many wings, trying to get out.
He stopped. His bag slid off his shoulder and he let it thump back to the ground as he went over to the wall. “Mom,” he called. “Who’s this?”
what he said, but when I saw him, there was like this light pulsing behind my eyes, and it was like before.  When they took me away before.  I felt mixed up like I did then.  For a second, I didn’t know where I was.”
The dog dropped immediately to its stomach, but its haunches stayed in the air, tail wagging vigorously, eyes still on Morgan. It barked once, but stayed where it was even though it so obviously wanted to tackle her to the ground, and by the looks of it, Morgan wanted that to.
“We are,” Tony said, assuring him with words and a few strategic kisses. “We’re fine. Okay? Don’t worry about that. Please?” More kisses. Touches to his face and neck. Soft. Soothing. Gentle. “Steve. Baby. We’re okay. More than okay.”
Tony was a little afraid, even as he blocked him, putting his back into it, pressing against him, cupping one hand around the side of his neck, trying desperately to get Steve’s eyes on him.  “Hey, Steve, come on, big guy, look at me.  JARVIS?  Little help?  Whoever’s available.”
“I had to miss two of them,” Steve said, looking solidly into his eyes. “Sam came with her to those.”
“Sure,” he said, then scuffed one foot on the floor, the blush growing more heated. “And then what?”
--or the way the sun glinted in Nat’s hair as she hovered over him like an angel, a beautiful, terrible angel on that grassy little hill in Central Park.  How big and scared Tony’s eyes were as Steve drew the edge of the razor across his own throat, and the way the blood fell in huge red drops, the way it sheeted down his neck, his chest, and pooled beneath his body.
“For Steve,” he said simply.  “For saving him that day.  And…” he smiled again.  That little half-smile Tony knew so very well.
Tony launched into a story about Sam daring him to duck under the barrier around the T-Rex, and Steve fell asleep to the soothing sound of his voice in his ears, his last thought being how content he was. How happy to have Tony here, in his arms, in his bed, in his life.
The kid--Tony--laughed, taking the cuff link from Stane’s unresisting hand. “Whatever you say, Obie,” he said, and casually took Stane’s arm to fasten it in place himself. “You’re the boss.”
“Get outta here,” Steve said, and Tony did. Easily slipping over the rail and climbing back down the side of the building. Steve watched him go, not even thinking that he should have invited him in through the window to just go out his door. Because
Thank you for reading and for all your comments! I always love reading them and interacting with you guys. It's part of what makes this worthwhile!
He leaned heavily against the glass, holding the phone to his chest now, tears falling, body wracked with sobs, and the screaming was back, pounding in his brain in time with his pulse. It was cold. Freezing. The phone was still in his hand. If it had been his pistol, he would have used it. He would not have hesitated. Not for one single second.
“Guess you boys had better stick to hand-holding, then,” Nat quipped.  “Unless you like being watched.  Then, have at it, right, Thunderbolt?”
Sudden tears pricked the backs of his eyes, and he put the car into first.  He was only forty-five minutes from home, but that felt like a very long time right now.  He punched the gas, and shifted up through the gears, putting the ‘Cuda through her paces.  He didn’t top her out, but it was close.
Tony stood up and walked closer as if being drawn forward by a magnet.  He was at the counter paying.  In cash.  Tony felt himself smile at that bit of old-fashioned charm.
Tony dropped their hands, and now Nat did crawl onto his lap.  Bruce put his arms around her and she kissed him before settling against his chest.  “I am sorry,” she said quietly.
Steve rested his head on her shoulder. “Yeah,” he said. “I know. That’s how I got so good. Trying to learn how to beat you.”
Tony held his hand tighter, his eyes grew darker, his voice rougher. “I need you to tell me we’re your first priority. Me. Morgan. Your mom. Dodger. The
“You saw Sam?” Tony asked as Rhodey started the coffee.  “How is he?  It’s been a few months since I saw him.”
FRIDAY’s voice was stiff, a bit angry when she spoke.  “I tried.  She doesn’t want my help.”  Pause.  “She doesn’t like me.”
he would see anything like this. But here it was. Like a dream. A secret dream he had kept hidden from even himself. His father, his daughter, and the man he had loved for longer than either of them sitting comfortably together. Like they were friends. Like they were family. A real family.
“I know what people say. What they think,” Tony said, then shook his head again. “But, none of it’s true. I mean, I’ve had a lot of
--that situation could be, he was invested in the story. He was just a little shocked Howard knew about it. “Maybe. What did
"You're so good, baby," Tony whispered, curling against him and stroking his hair.  "So perfect. I love you so much."
“Fine.”  She turned back to him when she got to the door.  “Sort yourself out, Tony,” she said bitterly.  “You’re a mess.”
“I’m getting your suit all wet,” Steve said softly, and his finger began to move, subtly running across Tony’s palm.
“Are you really that selfish?” Tony asked, knowing it was harsh, knowing it was the one thing that would shake him up, and it did.
He saw his hand lift up, saw it moving toward Steve’s shoulder.  He was wearing a white t-shirt.  Tony loved it when he wore white t-shirts.  Or black t-shirts.  Or blue button-downs.  Or gray sweaters.  Or-SteveSteveSteveSteve.
He followed Sarah into the kitchen, leaving Tony looking at his baby pictures, and filled his cup from the pot. He dumped three sugars in it just the way Tony liked, and stirred it with a spoon. When he turned around, Sarah was watching him closely.
Steve turned to him, finally.  The smile was still there, playing over his lips, but his eyes were dark, almost haunted.  “Would, um,” he began, swallowed, took a deep breath, then continued, “would you kiss me first, Tony?  Please?  I-I need it.  If I’m going to talk about this, I think I need it.”
Steve tightened his grip on Tony, sunk his head into his hair.  “It’s just for a couple days.  We’ll be okay, won’t we?”
“We won’t stay all night,” Tony assured him, and when he put his hand on Steve's thigh this time, it
Steve pulled the thumb from his mouth as if just realizing it was there and gripped the arm of the chair.  When he looked at Tony it was with barely-concealed fear.  “I
Steve climbed the stairs with a little spring in his step--he couldn’t help that either--and at his door, he took his keys out of his pocket. He turned his head when the door next to his opened.
Tony hummed a little. He was still smiling. Steve thought he was special. He wasn’t sure if he’d ever be able to stop smiling again. “Can I tell you a secret?”
The police station seemed fairly quiet for a Saturday night. He’d been in a few of them over the years, and usually they were a cacophony of cat-calls, strident voices, crying, laughing, a tv playing in the corner, phones ringing. It wasn’t that loud tonight. Just a few people sitting around, and they all seemed as morose as he and Sam did. Maybe it was still too early for drunk and belligerent, he thought. It wasn’t even eleven yet. The bars were still open and the night still in full-swing. At least for most people. Not them, though. Nope. Not them.
“Yeah, well,” Tony said, straightening, regaining his composure, regaining his strength even as Steve lost his own.  “I didn’t want to have you and your boyfriend come at me in a fucking tag-team death-match either.  Dick move, Rogers.”
Steve worked as long as he could, but finally swept all the intel off the desk and back into the drawers.  There was no point in trying to do more.  If he tried, he could make a mistake, and one little mistake on his part could cost someone else their life.
The lights were off in the living room, but the television was still on, casting the room in a bluish glow. Most of the seats were empty, but Bruce was asleep in the recliner, resting comfortably with his feet up, and there was a large, indistinct shape on the couch. It wasn’t moving, but there was the sound of small, breathy snores coming from it, so Tony assumed it was friendly.
Tony narrowed his eyes. “Wait, what-” he began, then stopped. Morgan was skipping toward them, Dodger nipping playfully at her heels. She skidded to a stop next to Tony and grasped his hand, giving it a happy tug. Dodger moved to Steve’s side. He sat down and gazed up at him, tongue hanging out of the side of his mouth. He was still grinning. Steve put his hand on his head.
“Yeah.  Pulsing.  Flashing on and off.”  He rubbed his face, then tried to smile.  “It doesn’t matter, Tony.  I’m in here.  This is where they want me.  I think...this is where they’ve always wanted me.  Once I did what they needed me to do.”  He laughed a little.  It wasn’t hard or cynical.  It was just laughter.  “I’ve been put out to pasture.  You know?  I guess I’m lucky they didn’t just shoot me.  Or...you know...put me back.  In the ice.”  His face started to crack, the veneer of happiness he’d tried to put on for Tony’s benefit, slowly crumbling.  “I thought that was what they’d do.  Maybe it still is.  Maybe-maybe that’s the-the endgame.”
.” He gestured around them at the gracious, beautiful space they were standing in. “All of this? It disappears. It’s gone. Everything you’ve had your entire life. You walk away with nothing. No car, no clothes, no nothing. Maybe your little friend is fine riding the bus, but do you even know
. But there was no stopping it. Not now, while he had Steve Rogers curled up against his side, his head on his shoulder, the comforting weight and warmth of him so enveloping, so enticing, so
Tony moved higher up Steve’s body so they could be eye-to-eye. He put his hand on his cheek and turned his face toward him. “Do you still love me?” he asked. Steve tried to turn away, but Tony wouldn’t let him. He kept his hand on his cheek. “Do you? Please tell me. I need to know.”
Ross held his hand, his teeth bared in a shark’s grin.  “But you should be used to that, shouldn’t you?  You’ve never been
“He said they got it all,” Steve said, eyes searching for the bottom of his mug even through the murky coffee inside. “Chemo comes next.” He paused. Swallowed. Sighed. “She’ll lose her hair.” He ran a hand through his own. It was still thick and luxurious. Sarah’s was too--at least for now. “That’s a stupid thing to think about. I know. I mean, who the fuck cares, right? Except
He closed his eyes and was beginning to drift when Steve’s voice brought him back.  “What?” he asked, pulling up from the shallow depths of sleep.
“Please what, Steve?” he asked, dipping his head to nuzzle at Steve’s nipple. He let his tongue run across it, and Steve arched his back to give him fuller access. “Tell me what you need.”
He breathed, and soon instead of the slow, easy inhales and long, sensual exhales, his breath grew shallow. Ragged. Instead of tenderly caressing Tony’s hair, his fingers fisted in it, pulling the strands, urging Tony to go faster, harder, and he did. He did. Steve moaned in the back of his throat. Quiet but frayed. The breath catching, hitching in his chest. Eyes squeezed tightly shut. Everything--
Just ignore everything I say, guys. I thought of a couple new scenes I wanted to write, so this will be longer than "Two more to go". Not much longer, but it will be longer. I'll give you the head's-up when we're on the last one, though, don't worry. It's weird posting as I write. My first series was halfway written before I even started posting at all, so I always knew what was up. Not so with this one. Oh well. "Whatever." ;)
He wasn’t sure if he minded or not, but he thought he might as well answer truthfully. “Ovarian,” Steve answered, sipping his coffee.
Steve didn’t disappoint him. That pretty blush heated his cheeks, he closed his eyes, bit his lip, and tipped his head back against the couch again. With that sweater, those jeans, his legs spread comfortably, he looked like every wet dream Tony had ever had. And when he opened his eyes, the glimmer of humor--mischief--in them just made it worse. Or better. Or whatever. It just made it more. More...everything. And Tony felt weak. So, so weak. Weak enough to know for sure what was going to happen, what he was going to let happen. Or
Of course, Tony knew.  It had been his suggestion all along.  Sam smiled at him approvingly.  Tony’s stomach fluttered in response.
Tony looked over his shoulder at Sam and Wanda.  Steve’s family.  His brother and his daughter in all but blood.
“Uh-huh,” she agreed. She picked up another crayon. Twirled it like Steve had done. Then she looked at him. Finally looked at him. “Maybe you should sleep in Daddy’s bed some more. Then you won’t have bad dreams.”
“Suicidal,” he answered bluntly.  “We took away anything and everything that could be used as a weapon.  That’s SOP with all new patients.  We kept him under 24-hour surveillance.  I special ordered vibranium restraints from Wakanda after he tore through three sets of the standard ones and two pairs of high-grade steel handcuffs.”
Steve kissed his shoulder. “Me too,” he said, and was a little scared to discover that he was close to tears. He blinked furiously, trying to clear them. “I miss you.”
“Yes.”  Tony gripped him through his pants, and Steve sighed harshly.  His head fell back against the metal wall.  He closed his eyes.  “Go on, baby,” Tony said, and traced his finger over Steve’s growing erection.  “Talk.  I’m listening.”
Tony brushed past them and walked out of the kitchen then, but he heard Natasha’s long-suffering sigh and the sound of Steve’s voice no doubt filling her ears with the tales of Tony the Tyrant and his non-apology-giving ways.
The other end of the line grew very still. Steve waited, biting his lip, caressing his chest, his stomach. He brushed over his nipple and drew in a quiet breath at the little shiver that went through his body.
She turned to Clint next and he held her with an intensity that bordered possession.  He whispered words in her ear in a rapid jumble that even Steve, who was standing so close, couldn’t hear.
Steve was quiet for a moment, his face lost in thought. Tony bit his lip, waiting. He didn't even dare to fathom a guess as to what Steve would ask of him. He was as enigmatic as the ocean depths sometimes. Even now, as close as they were getting, Tony rarely knew what Steve was thinking. What he might say...
Tony closed his eyes. His entire body seemed to have seized up, including his heart. He fought down the urge to pound on his chest to get it to lurch back to life.
“Really,” he said, pitching his voice low, and smiling. He hoped it was reassuring. It didn’t feel like it. It felt like a Halloween mask covering his face, but he hoped it looked better than it felt. “I’m okay. I’ve just got to study. And then I’ve got work this weekend. I’m fine. I just really do have a lot on my mind.”
"Oh, hell, yeah.  You should see this guy."  Tony blinked, squeezed his eyes shut, then opened them again.   "You're not so bad yourself. Who are you again?"
her,” Tony corrected, and pulled out of Steve’s arms. He took a few steps down the counter, away from Steve. It left Steve feeling cold. For the first time all day, he felt cold. “We’ve talked about
He brushed his fingers over her cheek, then turned to Dodger. He hugged him. Told him he was a good boy. Told him to take care of everybody while he was gone. Steve said it in his ear, and just trusted Dodger understood. He knew he did. He could read his mind, after all.
It still took a long time to get there, but it was time well spent. Steve sat beside him, looking out the window, holding his hand. He ran his thumb across Tony’s knuckles ceaselessly, and when they stopped at a market for a drink, he held his hand the whole time they were inside.
Tony thought with zero attitude and a sickly respect for her.  Because he was using her.  The same thoughts he used to get hard for her at night were the reason he shouldn’t be here with her at all.  They were what he was using her to
“I don’t care about Mrs. Perkins,” Tony said, giving his hand a tug. “Come on. I want to go to your house.”
Tony ran lightly to the side of the building, jumped up and grabbed the ladder. Steve leaned over to watch him pull himself up and start climbing.
As usual, the last place he looked was where he found him.  Tony went through the glass walkway, enjoying that heat as he went, and came out in the garage.  Steve was there, standing by the far wall where Tony worked.  He had his hands in his pockets, an old flannel shirt billowed around his thin frame.
They held each other for a while, standing pressed up against the door, Tony shuddering within the safety of Steve’s arms. When he finally got himself under control, he un-self-consciously wiped his face on the front of Steve’s shirt. Steve huffed out a soft laugh.
He stumbled down the stairs and back out to his car, a crappy little Chevelle, and Christ, Tony wanted to get his hands on
“Steve,” she said, taking his hand. “You’ve heard as many of his MIT stories as I have. You know he’s open to it.”
“Well,” Howard said and raised his eyebrows. “There’s always the New York office.” He nudged Tony with his elbow. “It would be nice to have Stark Industries’ brightest mind just an elevator ride away.”
After Happy got his revenge, Tony climbed out of the pool and fell, dripping and exhausted, onto a lounge chair. It was starting to get calmer, everybody either pairing off or sitting in groups chatting quietly. The sun had gone down and the party lanterns cast multi-hued lights onto the mirror surface of the water. It was beautiful. Like looking at a candle through a crystal or existing inside a prism.
.  Steve had toured the cabin, wheeling easily through the lower level, looking at the stone fireplace, the rough-hewn mantle, the butcher-block counters in the kitchen.  He’d smiled at the avocado green appliances--old but still in pristine condition--with Tony’s stainless-steel espresso maker cozied up next to them.  It should have felt anachronistic, but somehow it didn’t.  Somehow, it felt just right.
Tony and Sam exchanged a look, as if they’d been doing it for years. Part of Steve was thrilled to see it, but another part of him groaned internally. They were ganging up on him. He could see it in their eyes.
Tony used the hand on his cheek to pull him down to meet him. He kissed him high on one cheekbone. Very lightly. Very softly. But unhurried. Steve didn’t pull away. He just closed his eyes. “Well, we’ll just have to keep you here then, won’t we?”
I decided to do one more short sappy chapter before the finish. I'm having a mood lately, and I might be a couple hours late, but it WAS Steve Rogers' birthday on the 4th, so I feel like I'm justified.
regrets, Steve.”  He ran his fingers over the sandy beard covering Steve’s cheek.  “Except this.  You should regret this.”
There was a beat of silence, then her voice, as low as a con in a prison yard.  “You’re welcome, Captain Rogers.”
Tony looked at Howard, then at his watch again. Expensive. Flashy. Stupid, really, now that he thought of it. His eyes went to the door. Where was Steve? “Um. Yeah. Yeah. I’m-” He stopped talking.
--wasn’t something he could do. He couldn’t stay here, having Steve’s eyes on him while his guts were roiling, his heart shredding. He couldn’t do it. He didn’t have to do it.
Steve grabbed him roughly and pulled him onto his lap.  “If you’re gonna kiss me, just kiss me,” he said.
don’t you own a cell-phone again? Phone sex has gotten way more effective since the dawn of the video-age.”
Through Tony’s eyes, Steve didn’t see the super-soldier Dr. Erskine and Howard had imagined then birthed out of a metal womb.  He didn’t see the man who commanded armies and took down Hydra.  He didn’t even see that kid who had jumped on a grenade during training to save the other guys from the blast.  That kid had been skinny and lonely, but he had been good.  A good man.
Tony watched him swim. Watched the way he moved. He wasn’t completely nude this time--Tony could see a flash of black fabric--but his back was bare, and Tony watched the flex of his muscles as he executed both butterfly and breast strokes with Olympic-style precision. Tony wanted him to stop. Stop trying to avoid the conversation. It was time. They’d been dancing--or swimming--around it long enough.
They were sitting outside, the sun shining down on their backs while they studied in the school quad. The cold had finally broken, and now, in mid-April, the trees were starting to turn green and spring flowers were blooming. Steve drew in a deep breath. He felt good, in spite of the news Sam had just told him. He’d been starting to go a little stir-crazy, staying inside all winter long--not to mention his worries over money, and what he was going to do about Howard Stark--and sitting outside in the fresh air with his best friend, smelling the salt from the ocean and the apple blossoms from the trees filled him with renewed hope. Howard couldn’t stay mad at him forever. And even if he did, Tony would be graduating in a month and moving to Massachusetts to go to school, and then it wouldn’t matter anyway. Steve still wanted to make it right with him, to find a way to make it so they could at least be in the same room together, but that could come later if it had to, he supposed. He’d give in eventually. Tony was sure of it. Steve just tried to trust him and be sure of it too.
“I thought you might like that,” Tony said, and beared down on Steve’s shoulder with his teeth. He was still wearing his shirt and the serum was extremely good at its job, but Steve loved the idea of Tony’s teeth leaving an impression on him, even if it only lasted a second or two. “But I don’t think that’s what I want tonight.”
“FRIDAY, lock down the training room, ‘kay?” Tony said, then gave Steve a little squeeze.  “None of this is your fault, Steve.  You know, I
“It’s too hard,” he’d said. “You come here maybe twice a month, we go to the movies, we fuck, and you leave again. It’s like you’re married to the army, and I’m just your side-piece. That’s not enough for me, Steve.”
Then Natasha was by his side. She plucked the sleeve of his jacket. “Come on, Tony. Steve’s waiting.”
last. It couldn’t. There were too many other things. Too much of the other stuff. The outside stuff. Stuff that had little to do with
He held the receiver to his ear. It was eleven o’clock here, which meant nine o’clock in California. That seemed like a perfect time to pour his heart out.
Also, this is actually more like Chapter 5: Part 1.  Even though I'll call it Chapter 6, the next one will really be Chapter 5: Part 2.   I wanted to do it all together, but I was afraid it would be way too long, and I was struggling with where, or if, I should cut it.  This seemed like the place.
Tony sighed. “I know he is.” He kept touching Steve. Kept drawing unconscious comfort just from the feel of him. “But he’s not the only one. Bruce and I went to lunch today, and there was a couple at the restaurant.” He rolled his eyes at the memory of his own reaction. “I...I kind of said some of the same things about them that Clint said to us, and-”
“Are you okay?” he asked, the confusion/amusement still paramount, but concern edging into the equation.
Steve sat up, and Tony slipped out from under him and dropped to his knees, his fingers already working the buckle on Steve’s belt, then the button on his jeans. “Tony-” Steve began, and then stopped talking as the sensation of Tony’s mouth on him overwhelmed any and all words he could have possibly spoken. He moaned instead, and put his hand in Tony’s hair, running it gently through his fingers. His head fell back against the couch cushions. His breath came in short, hard gasps as Tony ran his lips and tongue over the hardness of his cock, his hand grasping wherever his mouth wouldn’t reach.
Tony should have seen this coming from a mile away. He has two superspies under his roof-- even his carefully crafted poker face can’t get him out of this one.

It sits dead center in his heart, spreading thin, curving limbs along his chest, nestling against the arc reactor. He doesn’t think he can feel them, not really-- but if he inhales wrong, turns at just the right angle-- he
“Alright kids, I think we’ve had enough fun gardening today,” he says, backing up beside them as he fires off the repulsors once more, “you’re both a bit more flammable than I am. I’ll finish clearing you a path, and then I’ll deal with the Wicked Witch myself.”
He can hear the yells of the others distantly in his ear piece, but the blaring of the warnings on the HUD drowns them out entirely. She’s crushing him with far more force than the suit can sustain, and soon it will be enough to crush

you on this team, Stark. Because we’re all…” She trails off, but he can put the pieces together himself.
It’s only a matter of moments before Steve appears in the doorway, an alarming number of emotions flitting across his face as he catches sight of Tony. He’s pretty sure he catches the trademarked kicked puppy look, and something that looks close to volatile anger, but there’s a good chance he’s just seeing things. He’s dying, after all. He can use that excuse.
it,” he mutters, but finds himself pressing closer to Steve anyway. “Last chance, soldier. You sure about this?”
“You always know how to sweep a guy off his feet, Stark,” he replies, humor still coloring his voice as he steps back to the ledge. “Jumping in three, two--
it?” His voice isn’t demanding, intrusive; it’s careful, comforting. It makes Tony want to rip his hair out.
“The Earth will reclaim what we have lost,” she says, dragging a hand over the chestplate of the armor. “It is you, and your kind-- your greed that pulls life from the soil as if it were nothing. You will reap what you have sown, Stark. The avarice in your heart will strangle the very life out of you.”
convince Steve to leave his bedside for two seconds. He was always such a worrywart when one of them was hurt. There’s a soft, concerned frown on his face, something that makes him unfairly attractive and endearing all at once.
“Gallows humor, of course,” Strange mutters, though he doesn’t seem inclined to play along. “I would give you a few months at most, if it continues growing at its current rate. Though from what I read, it is common for the growth rate to increase when in close proximity to the… individual you have feelings for.”
then I’m sure he feels the same way I do. He wouldn’t want you to go through this without telling him the truth. Even if it hurts.”
had been a blowout fight, even if Tony knew that Steve was right to keep him grounded.) The Mark VII stands in the Hall of Armor, encased beside all its predecessors. He knows it’s dangerous to keep them all together, much less operational-- but he knows that Jarvis will keep them safe. The Avengers-- his
Cap,” Clint’s joke is met with a resounding chorus of distaste from the others, but it doesn’t seem to deter him in the slightest.

“This is your chance to turn yourself in!” he yells, “Go quietly, and we douse the fires. This is your last shot, Arna. Make it count!”
“Don’t think you ever could, Jarvis,” Tony says, an irrefutable honesty to his words. He knows that Jarvis will do what he can for the team, and that’s all he can ask of him. The AI was an extension of himself, after all-- meant to do what he couldn’t, meant to process and extrapolate all of the data Tony couldn’t hope to memorize. Jarvis is the best sidekick he could have ever asked for, really. He just hopes it’s enough to leave behind.
“Hey. you’re going to be okay, Tony,” there’s an all too familiar stubbornness to his voice, comforting and grounding all at once. “We’re gonna make sure of it. Every time you get hurt, you say always you’ve gotten through worse, right?” Tony chokes out a quiet laugh at that. “See? You know I’m right.”
“Excuse me!” he yells out over the suit’s intercoms, “I understand that you’re upset about uh-- global warming, or something, but I really don’t think you’re going about protesting this the right way.”
“You have a hell of a number of contusions, dislocated shoulder that’s already been reset, no broken or fractured bones, thankfully,” Steve speaks before Bruce can, absentmindedly erasing something on his sketchpad. “He needs to check you for a concussion, now that you’re awake. He said that your heart rate is good, but he wants to check your lungs and the arc reactor. Your respiratory rate is higher than it usually is, but we’ve seen that before after you’ve taken hits like this.”
“You’re right. Maybe you should keep that in mind the next time you think about jumping directly into the line of fire,” Steve replies dryly. He glances Tony over, clearly taking stock of his injuries. “How’re you feeling?”
“If someone could apply to be Prince Charming, Rogers, you’d be the man for the job,” he says, shaking his head, “You’re polite, you’re kind, you’re selfless-- you called Pepper

“They are sunflower petals, Sir. They often mean loyalty and admiration. The others I believe to be rose petals, though they are not naturally found in shades of blue. Roses are often associated with immense love; the blue shade is a symbol of the unattainable, or a dream that cannot be claimed.” The AI seems apologetic, if anything. “Shall I contact one of the others, Sir?”
“...He told me about the cure,” Steve says at last, turning to face him again. “He didn’t… he didn’t tell me who it was, but-- I know now, what it would take to save you.” There’s a flicker of a grief Tony can’t name across his face, and for a brief moment he would swear it looks like
“Pot calling kettle,” Tony muses, “Jarvis, what’s the fastest way I can get these two out of here?” The HUD lights up in answer, the necessary weaponry enabled just as quickly. If he can keep their focus on him, and cause enough chaos to keep them scattered-- Steve and Nat can make it out safe. The two break for their escape, and Tony rockets up to draw Arna’s attention once more.
She drags him forward until he’s face to face with her, before digging her near talon-like fingers under the edge of the faceplate. She rips it from the suit like it’s
know,” Steve says in bemusement, “you’ve made that very clear over the past few years. But if she did anything, then you know we can call in Strange to help.”
There’s a moment of hesitation where he simply hangs in the air, considering his options at lightspeed. If he leaves Steve and Natasha behind, they have no other defenses; if one of them goes down, the other will be overwhelmed. But Clint isn’t enough to help keep the perimeter if she’s focusing her attacks on him and the Hulk. He has to make his decision,
pulling in on itself. He inhales deeply, and waits a few moments. The pain dissipates, as though it wasn’t even there to begin with.
Steve doesn’t have a chance to properly reply before a new voice is echoing harshly over the comms, a cacophony of screeches from the flower beasts rising up to greet it.
“Thanks. I think.” he replies, trying to maintain a casual tone and just narrowly missing the mark. If Clint notices, he doesn’t acknowledge it. He just nods and turns back to the movie.
for god’s sake; he can only imagine what he would do if he knew he was the only one who could save him.
“One of the on-call doctors has already been in to check on you,” Bruce carries on smoothly, though Tony can easily pinpoint the softer lines of his amused smile. There’s always
he bites back, rising to his feet before he even realizes it. “But thanks for the vote of confidence, Rogers. I really appreciate it. It’s actually pretty great to know that my teammates think I have a goddamn
so that’s probably in working order too. He also can’t feel the numb effect of heavy pain killers, so it must not be
He spends plenty of time with him down in the workshop, either sketching or tapping away at something on the tablet Tony had given him, or talking to the bots. Tony doesn’t mind it, even if the tightness in his chest gets worse every time he gets close. It’s worth it, just to see Steve smile at something ridiculous DUM-E is doing, or laugh at a dumb joke Tony made.
He’s taken refuge in the lounge at this point, making himself a permanent nest on the couch. He hasn’t stopped working, by any means-- he has his tablet on his lap, and plenty of holoscreens surrounding him to work from. He can’t seem to stay focused on one area; there’s still so much he needs to complete for them, and not enough time. There’s never enough time. He should have been better prepared for this.
Whatever spell they’re under has turned the plants into enlarged, gnarled creatures. The teeth that have grown out of their flower petal mouths are more than a little unsettling, especially with the chittering, clicking screeches they keep making. Clint seems rather unphased by it, at the very least. Tony, on the other hand, has no intention of getting anywhere
The relieved laughter bubbles out of him not a second later, unshed tears springing to his eyes. He’s going to live; he’s going to live, and Steve
said life-- but he really would like to know which action in particular warranted this sort of torture.
Strange pulls back as soon as he voices his discomfort, a grim set to his features. Tony’s chest resettles itself, releasing the hold on his lungs as he takes in a shaky breath.
A shudder wracks through him so harshly it threatens to bring him down entirely. The coughs are ripped out of him not a moment later, hacking up more of the lilies into his hand. It takes him a moment to realize that they’re accompanied by smaller, blood-splattered yellow petals--
“Right, businessman against a hippie. This probably won’t work out too well,” he muses to himself. Then, to the others, “Hey, do you think she knows about the green energy efforts we’re making with the arc reactor technology?”
Jarvis attempts to warn him, but it’s already too late. The rogue vines snake around his waist, his legs, and
“Only about five hours,” Bruce pipes in, drawing Tony’s attention away from Steve to realize that-- oh, right, Bruce is here too. Oh god, how long has he been standing there? Tony’s look of guilt must translate pretty easily to Bruce, considering the wry smile he gives him before he taps away at the nearby holoscreen, checking his vitals.
Steve blurts out before he can even finishing speaking. Tony snaps his mouth shut so quickly he teeth nearly rattle with it. A thousand different responses run through his head, though half are far less than kind.
“Nah, I’m alright here, I think. Thank you for coming with me,” he says. “I know it’s not really your preferred way to spend the day, but I appreciate the company.”
moving from piece to piece, admiring and pointing out any detail he sees fit to share with Tony. Tony doesn’t understand most of it, granted, but Steve’s passion still bleeds through, and it leaves a kindled warmth in his belly that he isn’t sure what to do with.
“Rock and a hard place, Nat,” he tries for a shrug, but winces at it tugs at the soreness in his chest.
consideration for the proper order of the universe, and he definitely doesn’t have the time to put up with whatever nonsense they will into existence.
for him. He wants to reassure him, wants to tell him he’ll make it out of this one alive, just like always-- but Arna’s hand is suddenly around his neck, and speaking is no longer an option.
“...You’re still hurting him, no matter what you do.” Strange replies quietly, his gaze sharp. “Hasn’t he already lost enough?”
of being bedridden is worse than the pain itself. Speaking of which-- there doesn’t seem to be too many points of pain, other than the expected scrapes and bruises. The weight of the arc reactor is familiar against his chest, and he’s
“Tony,” Natasha says, her voice far softer than usual, “Do you remember when you were dying of palladium poisoning?”
“You don’t get to judge me for this, Strange,” Tony bites back, “and you don’t get to make the decision
“I’m gonna miss you too, J,” Tony replies quietly, voice thick. “...You’re going to take care of them for me, right?” He knows he doesn’t need to elaborate any further, but there’s still a biting anxiety that needs addressed.
Your metals are mined from the earth, and you leave nothing but devastation and decay in your wake!”
pick up-- none of them can figure it out. That probably warrants a panic attack, doesn’t it? His weakest point is the arc reactor, and he’s got a magical parasite trying to dig its way around it. Realistically, he should be full tilt panicking right now.
He’s holed himself up in the penthouse, figuring it’ll be better to go here than anywhere else. The other Avengers have been flitting in and out, hesitant to leave him alone for any extended period of time. He knows that Jarvis
It’s the gentlest kiss anyone has ever given him, just the soft press of Steve’s mouth against his, but he can feel the warmth of it down to his very toes. He wants to press in and deepen the kiss, wants to tangle his fingers in his hair and
about this. I just…” he exhales harshly, tugging his fingers through the tangled strands of his hair. Tony is struck by just how
“Always just on time, aren’t you, Stark?” Natasha gives a weak laugh, clearly already taken a few hits herself. There’s blood dripping from a gash on her cheek, her uniform ripped in some places and a baton missing. Steve seems to be in the same condition-- he’s got blood matted in his hair, fighting with only his fists; the shield lies yards away, with plenty of chittering creatures in between.
“Right. Pretty much all of that.” Bruce nods in agreement. “Like Steve said, he’s going to want to check you over again, probably take some x-rays of your chest. I’ll…” he glances quickly between Steve and Tony, considering his options. “...I’ll go grab him. Keep an eye on him for me, Steve?”
he looks; there’s a haggard weariness to his frame, something Tony hadn’t been sharp enough to catch before. But
This dying thing is really starting to get old. Natasha leans back beside him, seemingly content to stay on the floor with him. Maybe she’s just giving him time to recover.
There’s an idle thought in the back of his head that maybe he should stop here, stop and consider the consequences of spilling his heart out for Steve to see. But something tells him he’s not lying, and if he is… well. This is Tony’s last chance to say
“But if you didn’t-- if you didn’t tell him, how do you already know?” Steve continues to question. Certainly not for the first time, Tony wonders if it is humanly possible to be more stubborn than Steve Rogers. He hates that it’s one of the things he loves most about him.
“It’s based upon unrequited love,” Strange shrugs, “if you confess, and he returns your feelings, then the spell will dissipate on its own.”
“I don’t think you confess your love to someone by insulting them first, Rogers,” Tony breathes out, the words light on his tongue.
“Great. So let’s reverse the spell and turn me back into a real boy, Doc. I’ve got important things to get back to.”
The mood in the tower for the next few weeks is more than sombre. The others take the news as well as he expects them to-- which is to say, all of them react very differently.
“...Tell me-- tell me again.” Tony asks of him. Steve smiles, a small upturn at the corner of his mouth.

The first time he chokes up flower petals, it’s after a long day with Steve at the museum. Tony’s never been particularly fond of art exhibits, but-- he’s made an exception for Steve, every single time. (Pepper doesn’t seem to appreciate that in the slightest, but he’s also pretty sure she
Strange shakes his head, leaning against the table, “I don’t think it’s going to be that easy, Stark. Magic like this has stipulations, and it’s not always easy to overcome them.”
Almost as if on cue, he can feel the vines in his chest shift and squeeze, stealing the breath from his lungs and pulling at his ribcage. Black spots dance across his vision as he tries to inhale, a harsh shudder running through him as the pain spreads. It radiates from his chest like a wildfire, burning beneath his skin. God, it
“The issue with certain strands of magic is that it’s nearly impossible for other magic users to reverse a spell that has been placed,” Strange finally continues. “At least, in this case, not without grave consequences.”
“What did he tell you, Steve?” Tony asks again, quieter, yet somehow just as cold.Steve doesn’t respond at first, just drops his hand to the back of his neck and breathes deeply. It aches just to
him. “You have to know the answer, don’t you? Please, Steve-- please don’t make me say it out loud. I can’t
“Hey,” Clint stage whispers to Tony, tossing a piece of popcorn at him and pulling him out of his half doze.
He grabs the gauntlets from the concrete, tossing them onto the table without the care they deserve. He sits, and he works, and he breathes, while he still can.
Not in the reckless way he once had, mind you, because Monaco was a mistake no matter how he looks at it-- and maybe he should have

will keep them safe. They’re meant to go to Rhodey anyway, should anything ever happen to the War Machine armor. Even if he refuses to take the title, Tony knows that Rhodey will be a better Iron Man than the world could ever deserve.
“Yes.” It almost hurts to say aloud. Tony doesn’t understand how a single word can feel like a lead weight on his chest.
the words are out of his mouth before he can stop them. A few beats, and Strange’s statement catches up to him. “Wait--
Tony runs his fingers through his hair as he speaks, as if the motion will stop the sudden tremors in his hands. The more time he spends with Steve, with his
“I assure you I came as soon as I could!” he laughs. He calls down a lightning strike that wipes out another wave of flowers as though they’re not even a threat. Tony feels absolute regret at ever doubting Thor’s status as a god.
“We’re not doing enough to hurt her,” Clint is the first to reply, notching his arrows and letting them fly, “Everything we take out, she replaces twice as fast. But she’s all plant, right? I’ve got incendiary arrows-- a couple of explosives, if we want to make the most of it. we’d have to keep the fire contained, unless we wanna do as much damage to everything
Tony sighed. He’d expected it. He’d known. But it still hurt. He’d thought...maybe. But he’d been wrong before.
Steve laughed back in his throat.  It wasn’t his bedroom-laugh, but it wasn’t his regular out-in-public laugh either.  It was a combination of both, and Tony wanted to drag him away.  Just take him somewhere, anywhere, and have his way with him.  The angle would be different now that he was on his feet.  He’d only kissed him a couple of times while he was standing, and those had been so long ago, so
Natasha laughed.  Right out loud.  The couple in the next booth looked at her, annoyed.  They were wearing black arm-bands.  People on a pilgrimage.  There were a lot of them in town for the vigil and the reception.
fucked him. They had been working their way up to it, but time--and nerves--were always too big a factor, but Steve had slipped his fingers gently inside him a few times. Turned him over and licked his way in. He still remembered the sounds Tony made when he did that. The low moans, the way he’d muffled his cries against his forearm or Steve’s pillow. He wouldn’t have to stifle himself now with Josh. No Mrs. Perkins in the apartment below, listening to the illicit affair of two teenage boys just discovering the pleasures of being with someone they loved.
fucking long--and he had missed them. Missed this. This sweetness and comfort. This feeling of home and family. He’d missed it. A lot.
He took his keys out of his pocket, and before the door was even open, he could hear a scuffling on the other side, a wild scratching on the wood, and he hurried to throw it open. Dodger was on him the second he was through, and Steve dropped to his knees to hug him. Dodger wiggled with excitement, letting out little yipping barks. “Shh, Dodge,” Steve said, but he didn’t really mean it. Even if Dodger was being loud, Steve didn’t care. He held him and petted him and laughed quietly while the dog tried to crawl up into his lap.
Tony turned his attention back to Josh. He pulled him closer, slid his hand into the back pocket of his jeans, and kissed him hungrily. Josh kissed him back. “What were you saying about sucking me off, earlier?” Tony whispered in his ear. Josh smiled at him, and slapped at his chest a little, calling him a “bad boy”, then went back to sucking tiny bruises all along Tony’s neck, littering his skin with them like badges of honor.
Steve turned on his side, grabbed his shirt from the foot of the bed. “Things have just been kind of, you know, tense lately.”
“Really? Looked pretty serious when I came up,” he said, and looked at Sam. Sam, not Steve, as if knowing who would tell him something closer to the truth in this situation. “Really. What’s going on?”
“I’m sure, kiddo,” he said. “Not sad. Just grumpy about the rain.” He stood up and swung her onto her feet. “So let’s go face it head-on, ‘kay? No more moping for us, right?”
“You miss them, don’t you?” he asked, and hopped onto the counter, his feet dangling, bumping against the cupboards with soft thuds of his heels.
. It had been a long time since he’d felt that way. Even with Pietro, he’d never felt quite so good.
“But I tried to tell you earlier, Tony, that’s not me now.”  He looked up at last.  His eyes were sad and terribly empty.  “I’m not worth your time.”  Tony winced and Steve nodded like he had agreed with him.  “I don’t have anything to offer you.  Not anymore.”
“He’s okay,” he said. “I’m gonna go talk to him, alright? I’m gonna go get him, but I need you to stay out here. Can you do that for me?”
Tony cocked an eyebrow.  “Scared?  You should be flattered.  It’s hot.  You’re hot.” He shrugged.  “Makes sense.”
Steve glanced down at his feet, nodding. “I know,” he murmured. “But you were working, and-” He stopped as the phone in his pocket started to ring. He took it out, glanced at it, and shoved it back into his pocket without answering. “That’s Nick,” he said. “I gotta go.”
“I trust you,” he said, and was relieved to discover just how true it was. Because Tony would keep him safe. No matter what. He knew that down to the very marrow in his bones. He knew that if he knew nothing else. Tony would keep him safe. He was always safe with Tony. He might lose his heart, but that was a sacrifice he would eagerly make. In fact, he’d already made it. Months ago. The thought settled him even further. He wasn't losing anything while he was here with Tony. He was giving it to him.
Steve stood up.  He couldn't sit still anymore.  It was too hot in here, too crowded.  Tony knew so many people. So many people loved him.  He'd touched so many lives.
“The night we had dinner with Rhodey and Carol, Tony,” she hissed.  Her color was high, her hazel eyes flashed.  Steve’s eyes were blue.  They were like ice chips when he was mad.  “You said I’d met most of your family and maybe you should meet mine.  Remember?”
Steve looked at them.  The serum was helping, and they’d heal soon enough, but they still looked bruised and swollen.  Blood had crusted in an ugly gash across the left one.  The right just looked mangled.  “Oh,” he said.  “I forgot to wrap them before my workout.”
He came almost immediately. Tony always gave him that. They had never talked about it, but after their first time together, Tony had picked up on the fact that Steve could go multiple times before being truly satisfied, and Tony liked to give him the first one fast. It was just one of the things Steve adored about him. That he would always be so selfless. Giving Steve pleasure before ever even thinking of himself. Of course, it was always mutually beneficial in the end. Steve could hold out longer the second time around, and that was a gift
She put her arms abruptly around him, stretching to reach around his neck, and hugged him extra-tight. “He’s great,” she whispered in his ear, and Steve could hear the smile in her voice.
Also, quick shout-out to my Shakespeare professor for the questions on Steve's final.  I lifted them directly from one of my own exams.  And, yes, I am a huge nerd who kept a lot of my old schoolwork.  And yes, I sometimes look at them when I'm feeling insecure about myself to remember that I can be smart sometimes.  Like I said...huge nerd over here.
Steve closed the door to the second bedroom where his work station was set up, then went to the door and looked out the peephole. Not that he needed to. He’d known who it would be. He ran a hand through his hair again. It was wet, but this time it was from the shower and not sweat, and it felt smooth and silky between his fingers. He took a breath, and opened the door.
“I don’t know, Sam,” he said.  “But, you’re right.  He’s been weird.  I’ve been trying to talk to him, but you know how he can be sometimes.  If I push too hard, he’ll shut down.”  Tony spun a pen on top of his desk, his fingers searching for something to do to keep themselves occupied.  “I don’t want him to shut down.  That’s never a good thing.”
“What did you say?” Tony asked, and Steve leaned back against his chest, letting Tony take some of his weight. Giving that to him too. Giving him everything he wanted. Everything he would take.
It was. Tony knew it was. Theoretically, it was perfect, but for his purposes it just wasn’t quite right.
He sighed now, into the phone.  “Yeah,” he answered.  “In a roundabout way, I guess it is about Steve.”
“That’s it,” he murmured, pressing Steve’s prostate with his finger. “Talk to me, baby. I wanna hear it. I wanna hear you. Let me know how good you feel.”
Steve pressed the cut-off button and stuck the phone in his pocket just as Tony climbed over the railing. Even though he had just climbed up eight flights of ladder, he was not out of breath at all. He just ran a hand through his hair, and smiled that little smile Steve had spent the whole day thinking of.
Tony laughed, sliding down Steve’s body to kneel at his feet, caressing every inch of exposed skin as he went. “Mmm. That’s okay,” he murmured. He leaned over to kiss Steve’s flat stomach. His tongue danced across the muscles there as he touched the waistband of his swim-shorts. “You don’t have to spout poetry. But I do need you to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’, okay?” He kissed his stomach again, his hip. “Can I take these off?”
Steve swiped a quick hand over his face, tearing his eyes from Jonathon’s ruined body, and when he did he finally saw him, and it was Steve, not Sergeant Rogers, that ran--fucking
. Sergeant Rogers was in charge. And when Steve thought of it that way, it worked. It put the burden onto somebody else. Even if that “somebody else” was still
upset. For some reason, this space, thinking of how Steve had been living here for months in this plain, spartan,
Steve pulled him closer again.  Put his head on his chest.  Tony ran his fingers through his hair, knowing he’d never be able to get enough of it.  Never be able to get enough of Steve’s warmth, his softness, his sweetness, his stubbornness, his anger, his passion, his calm, his brooding, his love.  He could fill his every second with Steve for the rest of his life, the rest of his eternity, and it would still never be enough.
He glanced at Tony again, but he wasn’t looking this way anymore. He was looking at his boyfriend. Talking to him. Steve looked away. He didn’t want to see it happening with Tony and this other guy.
Bucky nodded.  He took another step closer, but Tony didn’t feel threatened.  “There’s one other thing I wanted to say to you.”
“You better not be handling another genius,” Tony said, getting the smile he’d hoped for.  “Seriously, though, baby, he’ll be fine.”
He took it out of the box and slid it over his thumb. He ran his finger across the face of it, the polished metal, the smooth wood. God, how he’d wanted to put it on Steve’s finger tonight.
And there it was.  She knew he’d get her there.  She took both of his hands in hers and leveled him with a gaze that was kind yet stern.  God, she loved him.  It was not the untouchable secret love she kept locked in her heart for Clint, or the beginnings of romance she’d felt for Bruce.  It was clear and fierce, almost maternal.  It had been born when he’d saved her life in Zola’s lab in New Jersey, and had strengthened while they, along with Sam and Wanda, had gone on the run together.  She held onto it now and let it pour from her into him through her hands and her eyes, and hopefully, her words.
He didn’t know how he did it. Considering the trouble he’d had getting into the bathtub, Tony was almost shocked to discover that he was suddenly on his knees. Suddenly able to pull Steve into an awkward, uncomfortable, but undeniably
Tony looked at him, eyes shining. Sparkling. “You can do it again. In the morning. Right?” he asked, and Steve knew he wouldn’t say no. How could he say no? How had he

When he got back to the apartment, he showered, shaved, checked his e-mails and messages again, then ate breakfast. Eggs and whole-grain toast Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays. Hot cereal and fruit Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. He changed it up on Sundays. Sometimes he had toaster waffles. Sometimes Pop-Tarts. Sometimes, he’d throw caution completely to the wind and have a bowl of Apple Jacks or Cocoa Pebbles. Once, a couple weeks in, he poked around in the freezer and found a Red Baron pizza and cooked that. It was weird. Eating pizza for breakfast was
Tony closed the distance between them then reached down and touched his hair.  Steve hummed a little.  “I wondered where you’d gotten off to.”
Steve looked back over his shoulder at the house.  The fairy lights twinkled in the dark between the fluttering leaves of the trees.  It was beautiful.  Magical.  It cast its spell even here.  “That,” he said.  “
“You got it.” He was still holding the tie in his hand. He didn’t really want to let it go. “And you’re coming to movie night tonight, aren’t you?” he asked. “You’ve missed the last couple.”
“You feel good too, Tony,” he said quietly, then frowned, pouting like he’d done this morning, making Tony’s cock twitch again. Steve pressed closer, but at the same time, grasped the ends of Tony’s tie, tugging it a little. “Except…”
“I don’t want to forget.  It’s good.  If you hadn’t said it, we probably wouldn’t have ended up here.”
Bucky looked at him hard for a minute, then threw a checker at him and smiled again. “You ain’t her, Rogers.”
“Of course, it was.  Nat told me the night before that I should tell you how I was feeling, but I couldn’t.  Not while you were with her.  It wouldn’t have been right.  And it wouldn’t have been right to kiss you either.”  He swallowed again, and even in the moonlight, Tony could see a blush coloring his cheeks.  “I held your hand, though.”
Steve rolled his eyes and hugged him again. Wrapped his arms around his neck and squeezed him very tight. As tight as he could without hurting him. “Well, stop it. I don’t like it.”
He gripped Tony painfully tight, but Tony didn’t move. Didn’t even try to get away, and when Steve spoke, it was with a dark urgency that made Tony’s heart beat dangerously fast. “I can be the man you need now, Tony. I know I can. If you let me try, I can-”
Tony had watched him use that shield in combat hundreds of times, had watched him wield a god’s weapon in Stormbreaker, and had always been in awe of his confidence with it.  It was only now, watching the way he handled the razor, that Tony realized it had been more than mere confidence--it was almost arrogance.  As if he were willingly tempting the devil himself and didn’t give a fuck if he fought back.  Was
Steve dragged himself up from sleep one more time.  “No, no, no,” he said, putting one large hand over Tony’s so he couldn’t type.  “Tony, I was kidding.  No more.”
“I’ve got good scenery,” Tony said. “The lady who sold me the place called it a ‘million-dollar-view’.”
Tony barely slept.  He was terrified that as soon as he drifted off, Steve would leave.  It wouldn’t be for six months this time, or a year, or even two.  No, this time, he’d leave for good and Tony would never see him again.
A tight smile flitted over Howard’s features. “Mr. Barker’s chairs aren’t very comfortable,” he said. “I don’t blame you.”
“We’re still friends, right?” Tony asked, and Steve felt him place a kiss on his chest. Right over his heart.
Tony nodded.  He had.  Eventually.  Although, there hadn’t been much to it.  Just a plea for a meeting.  They were both succinct men, Ross and Steve.  They had that in common.
Onetwothreefourfive.  “Yes, I did.  But I thought if we worked together, we’d balance each other out.”
“Good,” Tony said, and sat down. He gestured at the chair across from him, and John sat down too. “First names are good. Makes things a little more personal. A little more human. Don’t you think?”
Tony reached out again--slowly, so Steve could see his empty hand--and touched his arm. “Did something happen?” he asked.
Steve took a sip of his coffee. It was hot and sweet. Milk or cream. He always drank his coffee straight up, but this tasted good. Better than it probably should. And he was glad he had it in his hands right now. Sometimes he didn’t know what to do with his hands. At least in situations considered “social”. Put a Beretta or a Sig Sauer in his hands and he was golden, but take that away, and he was suddenly a fumbling idiot. The coffee was a decent compromise. Or at least one he could work with.
Steve opened his mouth to tell him he was fine again, but then closed it. He wasn’t really fine. He’d had a bad night. Long. Plagued with nightmares. Hearing Bucky screaming on the ground, seeing poor Jonathon’s ruined body on the roadside. He had shaken it off throughout the day, and he hadn’t needed a drink that badly, but he couldn’t resist the comfort of a cigarette, and had bummed two off the dishwasher at the diner. He had smoked them in the alley outside, leaning against the brick. It was only when Tony called and he heard his voice, that he finally felt better. Easier in his brain somehow.
Steve pulled closer, draping one arm heavily over Tony’s hip.  There was no hesitation, no deliberation, just that smooth movement to close the distance between them, then the warmth of him, the smell of him--aftershave, soap, the more subtle scent of the outdoors, all clean and healthy--and the weight of him enveloping Tony.  He’d only been waiting for permission, it seemed, waiting to see if Tony was ready or willing to share that more intimate space again.  Tony was both.
Steve turned his phone off and shoved it carelessly into his pocket.  He laid one hand on Tony’s knee and scratched it lightly with his short nails.  “No,” he answered.  “July’s soon enough.”
“Easy there, Thad,” Tony said.  “Don’t do anything stupid, ‘kay?  I don’t want to fry you, but I will.”
The sun was sitting low on the horizon when Steve stepped out of the prison.  He was carrying the same old ruck-sack.  He was wearing the same old leather jacket.  At least, the weather was more appropriate for it this time.  It was June now.  Just barely, but June, all the same.
Strange stood over them, his face watchful.  “Did you see something, Wanda?  Did you see what happened?”
Steve chuckled, and finally--finally--the last of the tension ran out of his body. That warm feeling of love and home rushed in to take its place. He put his arms around Tony and pulled him tight against his chest, hugging him. “I know I do,” he said. “Sorry. Like I said, long day.”
Unable to help himself, Tony let his hand trail up the middle of Steve’s back, then up into his hair. It toyed with the curve of his ear, then smoothed the soft hair at the back of his neck. He knew he shouldn’t be doing it. He knew this was just inviting danger, but he couldn’t stop. He couldn’t, and he really didn’t want to. He knew it was wrong. He knew. He
But he told him everything else.  The things they’d said earlier in the day, as well as the fight they’d had in the evening.  He even told him about Steve’s frustration-fueled violence, although he tried to keep the reason vague out of respect for Steve’s privacy.  Tony was pretty sure Rhodey understood anyway.
He scooped her up in his arms and held her tight. “I love you,” he said in her ear, and she squeezed him.
They lay like that together for a while, breathing in each other’s scent and existing inside the heat they made together, the afterglow only marred by the fact that Tony was not technically free, and Steve was keeping something from him.
Steve pressed closer, throwing his arm over Tony’s middle to tug him nearer.  He nuzzled into the crook of Tony’s neck.  “‘Kay,” he said, and slept.
Tony clenched his fist, rolling his eyes in helpless frustration.  “Throw me a bone, Steve, please.  If you’re going to smack-talk me, at least do it in English.”
Steve’s mouth softened. He nodded. “Sure, Morgan,” he said, and squatted down to ruffle the dog’s fur. It’s tongue lolled out and it grinned at him in that way happy dogs had. Morgan knelt beside him and he immediately swiped her face with his tongue. “Dodger,” Steve admonished fondly, but Morgan just giggled and put all her energy into petting the dog with both hands. When Dodger licked her face again, she threw her arms around his neck and hugged him.
“You have, Tony,” Steve said softly. “Just looking at her, looking at this place-” he gestured around the kitchen, but meaning the environment as a whole. “She’s happy. She’s sweet, and gentle, and-” he reached out and touched one of Tony’s hands where it rested on the counter, “-she’s a lot like you. Like when we were kids.
“Hello, son,” Howard said when Tony opened the door. He barely glanced up from the paperwork on the coffee table in front of him. “How was the rest of your weekend?”
School was about to start. He had a paper to turn in to his English teacher, one he’d stayed up writing half the night. He was supposed to meet Sam for lunch. But the school stuff didn’t seem very important right now, and Sam would forgive him. He nodded. “Yeah,” he whispered. “I do.”
Steve stood up, laughing in that way he had. That way that made the whole world a little bit warmer. A little bit brighter. “Okay, okay. Have it your way.”
Tony wriggled closer and tossed his arm across Steve’s waist.  “Put your arm around me or something,” he complained.  “Let’s pretend that we like each other.”
Tony nuzzled into Steve’s chest. He didn’t say anything, but Steve didn’t seem to mind. He ran a hand over Tony’s back, and asked, “You sure you’re okay?”
Tony flipped the dish towel he was holding over his shoulder and came around the kitchen island.  Steve sat down onto a stool and hooked his finger through the belt loop of Tony’s jeans.
Tony closed his eyes wearily, then opened them again, rolled them slightly, just so Steve could see, then said, “Okay, Dad.”
When the elevator door opened, he shoved his shaking hands deep into his pockets and left. The doorman opened the outer door and wished him a good night. Steve nodded without thinking, and stepped out into the night. The wind coming in off the lake was cold and sharp, feeling like a blade against his skin. Steve turned his face into it. It helped. It brought him back to where he was, dimmed the screaming in his head, and that was good. He didn’t want to hear that anymore. He knew he deserved to hear it. That he should hear it in his head for the rest of his entire life, but he didn’t want to.
It took an hour to get there.  If Steve had been feigning sleep when they first started out, he wasn’t pretending anymore.  Despite his nap on the plane, Steve was once again deeply asleep as Tony pulled into the driveway.  He hadn’t been able to help himself, and on one particularly lonely stretch of the road, had let her run just a little.  He punched the gas, Steve sleeping peacefully beside him, and let her out until the red needle stood at 100 MPH.  She didn’t even shudder.  Tony brought her back down.  He didn’t know the road, it was dark, and Captain Stubborn wasn’t buckled in.  But the exilheration stayed.  He adored flying in the suit, but there really was nothing like driving a beautiful car.  You could get drunk off that.  He looked at Steve, the way his head was tipped to the side, exposing his neck.  You could get drunk off
capable--but, it still felt good to have a sleepy, barely-coherent Tony reassuring him. He felt very good about that.
?” he said, and Steve was relieved to hear the laughter half-hidden in his gruff tone. “All it takes is fifteen years and a fit of hysterics to get you to promise me? That’s fucked up, baby.”
He kept in touch with the guys--Jeff and Ray and Billy and some of the other locals, but he couldn’t go up there.  It was too much.  He knew he’d have to eventually, even if it was just to clear it out and mark everything for storage, but he couldn’t yet.  It was still too raw, the wound still open.
Tony's hand went to his hair again and used it to tug him closer. Steve came willingly, gratefully, and kissed him with a raw hunger that made his nerve endings sing with want. He could sense that quiet space, that place of peace and mercy
, he thought.  And that was true.  He deserved to be lying here alone, riled up, lonely, frustrated.  Because that was exactly what Tony had done to Steve.  He broke into that hospital, woke Steve up from his slumber, got him excited, got him anxious, then ran away without a backward glance.
“Yeah.  Last night?  I told you you could use cuddling lessons, remember?”  He barked a short, hard laugh that sounded nothing like his usual one.  “Who knew you were such a quick study?”
He drew him a picture at lunch of a red car that would go really, really fast because Tony liked cars that went fast and red was his favorite color.
that Steve exuded. He had his arm around a woman with Steve’s smile--his mother. “You look like him,” Tony said.
“Nothing out of the ordinary,” he told Sam.  “Just our usual stuff.  Nothing serious.  Why?  What did he say?”
Natasha came in from the kitchen.  She handed Tony a chipped mug of tea and put another on the coffee table in front of Bruce.  She curled up next to him with her own mug.  She sat close, but not touching him.  Tony supposed if he had not been there, she would have curled up in his lap.  He appreciated the restraint.  It was hard being single.  Not that he was single.  Not in his mind, at least.  He was just alone.
It was nothing like war.  Nothing like a fight or a mission, but watching him use the razor, Tony was reminded forcibly of how he used the shield, not like it was a separate thing, but like it was a part of him, an extension of his own body.  There was an easy confidence to the way he used one hand to pull his skin taut before gliding the blade down it in smooth, unhurried strokes, his hands knowing exactly how much pressure to apply, exactly how to angle that shiny, deadly blade to the vulnerable skin of his throat.  And that was like the shield, too.  It was a peculiar magic, the way he used it, always taking its return as a matter of fact, always just knowing it would be in his hands when he wanted it.
“So, finally, I told her to open the door just to shut her up.  But I ignored you.  I wasn’t mad at you, I just wanted to see how long you’d stand there with those goddamn puppy-dog eyes before you said anything.”
Steve blinked as if Tony had slapped him across the face , but there was a hardness in his eye that darkened the ocean blue.  “I’ve tried telling you,” he said, his voice low, “but you won’t listen.  It’d be better--”
Tony to love him forever. Even if it was just a little bit. He wanted to go to bed every night knowing that Tony might be thinking about him. Might be sitting at his desk, listening to a professor drone on, and think about studying together in the self-help section of the library. He wanted to know that Tony might be out on a date somewhere, or driving in his car, and when The Eagles came on the radio, he’d remember their first time--a lazy afternoon a million years ago in Steve’s tiny twin bed that still seemed to be big enough to hold them both. Every time. Every time they were together.
They were sitting at the table, his mother, still in her scrubs, and Tony, wearing Sam’s endearingly still-too-big t-shirt. They both had cups of coffee by their hands. A large book, Steve recognized with a deep internal groan as one of his mother’s scrapbooks, sat between them on the table. He shook his head and came into the room.
He pulled the boot from Tony’s foot and tossed it aside, then reached for the fly of his jeans. Working with the methodical hands of one well-versed in his task, Steve pulled the zipper down, then slid the denim down Tony’s thighs. Before he could throw them away, Tony was able to find enough mental ability to say, “Wait. In the pocket. My wallet. There’s-”
“No way,” he objected.  “Nobody said this was for Iron Man.  It’s on the house, dude.  My boss would kill me if he knew I charged
“I shouldn’t’ve talked to Rhodey behind your back,” he said quietly.  “I’m sorry.  I didn’t think of it as a...betrayal.  I don’t-I don’t know what I thought.”
“Yes, it does,” Tony said, and his voice sounded sharp in his own ears. Much sharper than he had ever wanted. Steve shifted, but didn’t move from where he was pressed against the door. Watching him. Just watching with those blue eyes. “Sorry,” Tony muttered. “I’m sorry, Steve.”
Tony slid his hand down Steve’s body and then hooked his finger into his belt loop. “I know it’s private,” he said haltingly, not looking Steve in the eye, “but, if you ever want me to go with you…” he shrugged. “Howard said they had open meetings sometimes.”
But just as he was beginning to analyze Bruce’s strange behavior, he heard the front door open, and the familiar
Tony laughed bitterly.  “I don’t even think you realize how fucking crazy you sound, do you?  It’s okay for you to die, but not us?  I can’t even begin to fathom how that makes sense in your mind.”
? And what would that mean for their future? What would that mean for any little additions that might come along? Would he be able to handle that? Would Steve be able to handle him
He slipped out of Steve’s hand and left the house without looking at Howard, just shrugged past him and out the door, grabbing his jacket from the hook on his way out. Howard stood there for another moment, glancing around the small apartment. Steve saw his eyes light on the photos on the wall, the handmade curtains, the worn-in furniture. He looked at Sarah and nodded. “Mrs. Rogers,” he said.
Words trembled on his lips, those three little words that he’d held in his heart for so long, but he held them back.  If he said them, he’d come undone and nothing would be able to stop him from taking Tony away, not just from this dim stairway, but out of the building and down the street.  To where?  It didn’t matter.  As long as the two of them were together, it would not matter where.  And if Thanos did come and the rest of the world turned to ash, it would almost be worth it if he could die in Tony’s arms.
Steve unlocked his door, still trying not to watch--and watching anyway--as Tony gave Obadiah a little salute and said, “Yes, sir.”
, and Tony responded in kind, kissing back with a fervor that, for all the times he’d kissed Gina, he hadn’t felt in months.
. So tall, so broad, his arms strong, his chest a solid mass of muscle. Tony had been with a lot of people, but never someone as overwhelmingly
Tony took a deep breath, pressed against the wall outside the bedroom.  He’d lain in there with Steve just this afternoon.  Holding him, kissing him, talking, laughing, professing his love--again.
Tony stretched his hand down to touch his cheek, ran his fingers over his beard. “Baby,” he whispered. “Please.” He put his finger on Steve’s plush bottom lip. “Put your mouth on me, okay?” he said. “That’s what I want right now. First. Okay? Please?”
Bucky laughed for real this time.  Tony couldn’t help grinning back.  Above them, a few birds began to chirp.  “
Sam chuckled a little in his ear, and Tony felt his thundering heart slow a bit. If Sam could laugh--even just a little--then Steve was probably okay. Mostly okay, anyway. “The apartment below Sarah’s. Mrs. Perkins’s old place.”
Steve closed his eyes. He'd known. How the fuck had he known this would happen? His hands clenched into fists, as he took a deep breath then let it out.
Strange sighed.  Tony could hear the annoyance loud and clear as a bell.  “He’s getting better.  Getting stronger.”
My boss is the most sweet-tempered man in the world, but I think even HE would have to fire me if I started saying "Fuck you!" to customers trying to get my attention, no matter how nicely I said it.
“He started screaming,” Steve said hollowly. “I don’t know why. He was talking normal at first. I heard him. I heard him say something about bananas, and then his dad said something--I don’t know what. I couldn’t hear--and then he was just...just
” Steve insisted. “I don’t. I’m fine. It’s fine. Sam’s just-” he delivered a sharp kick to Sam’s ankle under the table, making him wince, “-being the way he is.”
“He’s right,” Strange said.  “Let’s go.  We should take a breather.  We need to process this, it won’t do any good to go off half-cocked.”
Tony sighed and looked up at Steve. He was still pouting, but Steve could see something else in his eyes. Something that was warm and soft and tender. Steve wanted to believe it was love. He hoped it was. God, he
“Hey,” he said, “no strings, okay?  Just like the plane ride home: no strings, no agendas, no expectations.”
Tony was nodding before Sam even finished speaking. “Yeah,” he said, “Yeah, I do. I’m coming, okay? I’ll be right there.” He paused. “Wait,
Tony kissed him hard, still holding his hand clenched in his own. Steve kissed him back. He held his hand, gripped his hip, and kissed him with everything he had. Everything he would ever have.
Tony grabbed his hand and shook it wildly, like he couldn’t contain his excitement. “No,” he said, “baby, you don’t understand. It’s
“Are you sure you don’t want a cheeseburger or something?” Tony asked, arching an eyebrow at Bruce’s plate. “You’re making me sad. Lunch should not be a sad-time endeavor.”
on his bed, when he had very clearly stated that no dogs should be on the bed just made the dream theory that much more plausible.
Tony shook his head. “I thought about it,” he said in his new slow voice. “London or Berlin. But they’re too far away. Staying here isn’t really an option right now, but I can’t be that far away from Morgan either. We’re doing joint-custody, and when she’s with Pepper, I need her to know I can be with her within a few hours if she needs me. And when she’s with me, that she can be with her mom if she needs
“There’s people around all the time, but there’s nobody really to talk to.  It’s like when I was a kid.  I’m kind of the odd man out.”
Actually, they’d stripped, sanded, and revarnished the floor, but Tony just said,  “No.  They were okay.”
“Yeah,” he said faintly, and squeezed her hand. “It has. But, I think that might be okay now. At least, that’s what Sam said. He thinks she might not hate me quite as much anymore.”
Steve inclined his head just enough to plant a kiss to Tony’s neck. “Don’t, okay? Don’t worry about this.”
It had been a month since Tony came back to school. They were sitting in the cafeteria. Steve and Sam were on one side of the room, Tony and his entourage were on the other. It hadn’t taken long for Tony to gather up a large crowd of devoted friends. Steve knew it wouldn’t. They took up two tables. They were loud, exuberant, beautiful, filled with the giddy hilarity of youth. They laughed a lot. Threw things at each other. Clint and Natasha spent the entire lunch hour in a passionate lip-lock that no one could seem to break up, and after a few tries, they gave up and let them be.
Tony pressed his forehead against the hard muscle of Steve’s chest.  How was this his life now?  After all the mistakes he’d made, the ridiculous, selfish choices, after all the people he’d hurt, how did he possibly deserve to have this?  He belonged in some whore’s bed, doing it dirty and fast, money already on the nightstand, stale cigarette smoke in his nose, a dog barking outside the window of an anonymous, concrete motel room.  Not this.  Not this beauty.  Not this sweetness.  Not this person laid out before him, wanting him, needing him, trusting him to know what was right, trusting him to make it good, begging him with blue eyes in a warm, gentle darkness that held no pain, no fear, only promise.  How could he possibly get to have this after the life he had lived?
Steve slipped gently out of him, but when he tried to roll away, Tony said, “No, don’t go.  Stay here.”
“I’m tired of saying it,” Steve complained, rinsing off his toothbrush and putting it back into the holder on his side of the vanity.  He folded his towel neatly and laid it down next to it.  Tony’s side was a jumble of products, face cream, hair gel, cologne.  His razor sat precariously close to the edge, the charger unplugged and useless, in the corner.  Steve restrained himself from tidying it.  They’d come to an uneasy compromise:  Steve wouldn’t touch Tony’s stuff, and Tony wouldn’t encroach on Steve’s side.  They’d come to this arrangement after a fight over an improperly-capped tube of toothpaste and it had held up so far.
Steve scrubbed a hand over his face then back through his hair.  It was a rough gesture, heavy and exhausted, and when he moved his hand away, Tony could see the faint network of fine lines at the corners of his eyes like fissures in fine bone china.  It shook Tony to see those lines.  Steve may not have thought he was immortal, but Tony wondered if maybe he, himself, had thought he was, even after Thanos.  He’d faced his own mortality many times--there was certainly a lot more salt in his hair than there had been five years ago--but the thought of it happening to Steve felt like blasphemy.  Again, he felt that need to protect him, that need to keep him safe.  And this wasn’t helping.
Tony sauntered toward him, hands in his pockets.  He wasn’t wearing a jacket, just a long-sleeved thermal under a concert tee.  Alice in Chains, this time.  Steve remembered Tony playing him an album once, going into raptures about “grunge” and the Seattle music scene of the nineties.  “Alice in Chains stands apart, though,” he’d said.  “Christ, Steve, listen to the melody.  Isn’t it beautiful?”
Rhodey shook Steve’s hand then hugged Tony long and hard.  Tony planted a gruff kiss on his cheek.  Rhodey pulled back and held him at arm’s length.  That motherly look was back on his face.  “You remember what I said, Tony.”
The casual touches and easy, friendly looks he’d grown accustomed to over the past month did not disappear when their friends showed up.  Tony had been half-afraid Steve would retreat from him a little with the others there and had mentally prepared himself for that.  But that didn’t happen at all.  Steve treated him exactly the same as he had since they’d gotten over their initial coldness.  He held his hand, casually ran his fingers through his hair, and even went so far as to pick a fight with him over the grilling of the steaks.  Crazily, it had been that even more than the lingering touches he gave him that made Tony feel the most confident in what they were building here together.  Any couple could put their best face forward for company.  Only the strongest ones would give them a glimpse behind the curtain.
No, instead he laid there with his friends around him, laughing and talking, and after a while, he stood up, said goodnight, and headed back down the stairs. He didn’t go to the lab this time. He didn’t detour to walk past Steve’s rooms like he’d done every night for the last couple weeks either, he just went straight to his own.
He dropped extravagantly, suddenly into Steve’s lap and lifted his feet into Natasha’s, sprawling across them both.
, though...well, Steve actually had no fucking clue what he did. All he knew was that he had been positive he would never see him again.
“It’s hard,” Tony said, then twisted the bread up again. This time, he opened the cupboard and shoved it inside. He closed the cupboard again with a little more force than necessary. “You know? ‘Cause she depends on me. On me and Pepper. For everything.” He ran a hand through his hair in a distracted way. “And I want her to. I want to give her everything. Everything that I never had.”
