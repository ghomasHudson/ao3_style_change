Gonna be real hard for you to find something I’ll object to
Cas opens his arm and says, “Lay down then.”
Dean shakes the sleepwebs from his brain and reads two more times to make sure he’s not misunderstanding. He’s not, and he’s definitely wide awake now.
After giving his own cock a loose stroke, Dean squeezes Cas’s ass again before spreading his cheeks to reveal his hole. He likes the way Cas tenses in anticipation just before Dean licks, soft and light, just a taste.
They take advantage of the mini-bar and then somehow the night becomes a teenage sleepover where they talk in the dark until way too late. Post-shower, Cas smells like a thunderstorm rolling in, like the way the air goes still right before a tornado forms, and Dean has to resist the urge to bury himself in it. He wants to tell Cas that there’s nothing in his scent that says
“Am I being punished?” Dean says, still smiling because he knows he’s not. He saw the look in Cas’s eyes when he first kneeled for him, like he was both thrilled and satisfied by Dean on his knees.
With Cas nice and relaxed, Dean eases him open a bit with his thumbs to get deeper. Dean’s cock throbs and he can feel a trickle of slick between his own legs as Cas starts to ride back on his tongue, greedily taking what Dean is giving.
- "You're late."
“My turn,” Dean says.
being punished when it’s deserved.
“So I said, ‘What was I supposed to do with that cat, Samantha?!’”
“Cas—”
This guy doesn’t seem concerned about the unspoken rules he’s breaking, and Dean tries to keep his eyes out the window, not weirdly inspecting the cute guy way inside his bubble. Still, on one of his glances over, Dean catches a glimpse of his phone case.
Dean nods and Cas’s eyes narrow, head tilted as he considers what to do with him. Dean will take anything. “I hurt you earlier,” Cas says, “I should make up for that.”
Cas laughs, and Dean can’t take his eyes off him as he prowls into bed, cock hard and pretty as he fits into the V between Dean’s thighs. He’s quick to rip open the condom and slick himself up, and then he’s filling Dean with the slow, shallow thrusts that make Dean insane, going just a bit deeper every time.
“So you haven’t been propositioning guys all over town.”

It’s been a long day running from the dead and hiding from the living, not sure which is worse. The living are greedy and the dead are hungry, and Dean just wants to keep him and Cas alive.
Rhythm or not, Cas moans and purrs and thrusts his hips back and forth between Dean’s mouth and his hand, chasing that high, a sheen of sweat across his lower back. “There you go, sweet omega,” Dean murmurs, stroking tighter and slipping his thumb in a little deeper at the same time.
It may be somewhat of a joke deflection, but he says anyway, “I bet if we hold hands, we could call this our first date.”

“I understand if you’d prefer I find somewhere else to stay. I should have told you before.”

“Fine, I’ll stop fucking around.” Dean looks down at the pillow — it’s charcoal grey and softer then you’d expect — and chews on his lip for a moment. “I — I’ve never told you this. But.” He winces and sneaks a look at Cas, who is just waiting. “I’m asexual.”

Cas watches Dean’s face as he fucks him through it and Dean watches back, eyelashes fluttering as his cock gives a final jerk. Cas’s fingers come out with a wet sound that is less sexy now that the haze of pleasure has mostly abated, but Dean still feels uncomfortably empty without him.

After three hits that will be welts by morning, Cas pauses and runs his fingers through Dean’s hair. “Color?”
“This…?” Dean says, even though he knows. Even though his belly is suddenly a boulder of dread.
Cas tugs at Dean’s hand, pulls him close for a long, sweet kiss. “You deserve more than I could give. I can’t tell you how grateful I am to call you mine.” Dean blushes and tries to duck his head down, but Cas holds him still with a gentle touch to his chin. “Repeat that, please.”
“Ah,” Dean says. “Well, point stands. It doesn’t matter to me.”
“Dude,” Sam says while Dean and Jimmy stare. “That was a UFO.”
Cas circles the island to stand behind Dean, a hand light on his lower back. “We have a few minutes?”

“I’m not sure I should,” Cas says, because he’s started imagining the pounding of Dean’s heart, how his blood would feel thick on his tongue, as soon as he heard Dean’s voice.
“I’m not,” Cas says, tilting his head in that adorable quizzical way of his. “Are you?”
Dean shouldn’t be surprised that Charlie facetimes him instead of responding. Her hair is in disarray, a smear of paint on cheek and chin.
“Not a tequila fan?” Dean says, grinning.
Dean suddenly smells unavailable. Not mated, not exactly, but claimed, and Cas is expected to act like he’s not gutted by it.

Cas sits at the kitchen island while Dean starts pulling out ingredients. A weird silence descends for a few minutes—Dean half-wonders if Cas is the kind of Dom that prefers his subs silent—but then Cas says, “Charlie mentioned the two of you were LARPing last weekend.”

Dean really hit the jackpot when it comes to being Cas’s roommate. He doesn’t make Dean listen to him fucking people all the time; he can’t cook for shit but always offers to clean up after dinner; he doesn’t wake Dean up at crazy hours or make the whole place smell like popcorn day and night.
“We broke up,” Cas says. “It appears I interrupted something.”

But for days, when Dean closes his eyes, he can still feel the dripping heat of it on his skin. He blushes almost every time he looks at Cas, enough that Sam raises eyebrows at him so Dean has to kick him under the table of another no-name diner.
Sam knows. One time they came up with this hare-brained plan for him to morph a fucking Yeerk (Meg, actually) and take control of Cas in order to get them through new Pool security. Neither of them had realized that Sam would, of course, be privy to Cas’s consciousness the same way a regular Yeerk invader would.
“That ain’t nothin’,” Dean says, wiggling his hips to help Cas pull off his jeans and boxers.
Dean stares, mouth open. Padlocks click open, one after another.
Cas gives him an unreadable look. “I am.”
“You can,” Cas whispers, like he can sense that specific wanting on the air.
“Hello,” Cas says, giving her a little wave, but something isn’t right. Something makes Dean tell Charlie
“I can do that,” Dean says, sliding a hand around Cas’s hip to grip his cock, hard and leaking. Dean gives himself a moment to feel a little smug before he gets back to work with his mouth, licking and sucking, making a vague attempt to stroke Cas’s cock in the same rhythm.

Cas gives him a final lingering kiss, then pulls back to dispose of the condom before draping himself over Dean’s chest, uncaring of the mess. He kisses just over Dean’s pulsepoint, and he must be able to hear the thunder of Dean’s heart, even when he tucks into the crook of Dean’s neck.
Dean grins when Cas bursts into laughter again. Cas’s laugh is so goddamn good, rough but melodious, and Dean feels particularly pleased to make him laugh now, when so many other Doms would one-eighty into punishment mode.
“I think I will,” Cas says. The next hit is a little harder, just barely, and the next one barely harder than that. Dean squirms and Cas flicks the cane across his ass, just another tease. “Is there something you want?”

Their boots pound across the hardwood floors, and in the bedroom, Cas grabs Dean and spins him around to shove him into the bed. Cas climbs on top of him, both of them breathing hard and laughing.

“Mmhmm. You’re never catsitting again.” The cane comes down hard across the back of Dean’s thighs, and suddenly he’s aware of his cock starting to harden between his stomach and the comforter. Like Cas can tell, he asks, “Is that better for you, honey?”
Cas gives Dean his best adorable dork smile and offers his hand.
“I’ll get the beers,” Cas says. “Take off your boots and meet me at the couch.”

“I finally took your advice,” Cas says. “I told him.”
“Just my scent?” Dean teases. Cas’s stomach is firm under Dean’s arm and he imagines putting his mouth over it and then lower, finding out what Cas tastes like under his clothes.
Cas presses a kiss to his cheek, and then the corner of his mouth, and then they’re kissing for real, and the languid touch of Cas’s tongue sends Dean over the edge, painting his own chest and stomach white with his release.
“But you, uh, can’t.”
“If I were your Dom, I might punish you.”
Cas gives him the smile he saves for Dean, the one Dean now knows means
And because Dean is drunk, he leans further forward and brushes his lips over the place his hand just touched, just a barely-there caress of Cas’s cheek.
And the difference between them.

Cas reaches down, not to stoke but to hide himself from Dean’s eyes. Dean squeezes his knee, hoping it’s reassuring, and says, “Ok, then I suggest you flip over.”
“We’ve watched fifteen seasons of Dr. Sexy together twice and you never guessed? I think that’s on you.”
“Here?” Dean says, then widens his eyes at the look on Cas’s face. “Ok, here. Just a sec.”
“Drowning,” Dean agrees. “But in a really good way.”

Dean grabs Cas’s hand and leads him inside to the bedroom. Cas doesn’t believe in making his bed, but the blankets and sheets are more chaotic than usual, mostly just a tangle at the bottom of the bed. Dean squeezes Cas’s hand reflexively and asks, “Rough night?”
Dean’s bored with all the bus posturing. All the men who stand instead of having to sit directly next to other men, but feel free to take reign of multiple seats with their spread legs when the seats are occupied by women. All the humans sneering at the sight of tentacles or horns or cloven feet. The elves who sneer at everyone as if the entire bus experience is below them.
“Green,” Dean exhales.
He carries that hope up with him so high that he doesn’t notice at first when Cas does stop. Dean’s hardly able to participate as Cas shuffles him back to his bed. Bruises start to bloom on Dean’s backside, ass to knees, and he glows in it.

“I have a great idea,” Dean says.
Dean takes his seat silently and doesn’t touch the menu while Cas orders their drinks. Once they’re left alone at the table, Cas bumps his knee against Dean’s and says, “I know you said you haven’t liked sushi in the past, but you also said you’ve only eaten shitty sushi. If you end up hating everything, we’ll grab a burger after, ok?”

Cas smiles and gives Dean another smoke-filled kiss, this time lingering through the exhale. “So what’s on the agenda for tonight?”
Cas brings Dean’s hand up to his mouth and runs his tongue slowly over the salt. He lingers, tilting his head almost like he wants to rub his cheek over Dean’s knuckles to leave a scentmark, but in the end he lets go of Dean’s hand to take his gulp of tequila. He doesn’t bother with the lime.
“I’ve never been with a guy.”
Dean is so angry they don’t speak for weeks.
They’re much more interesting — and cuter — than I am.
“Thank you,” Dean whispers into the sheets, blushing.
“Sometimes a single free seat on a standing-room bus is empty for a reason. Such as the presence of bodily fluids.”
Cas waits all the way through his next hit before saying anything. “Do you really want to know? We don’t talk about this.”

Dean kisses the back of Cas’s neck before moving his touch lower, working until Cas is a puddle underneath him. Dean hums a Jackson Browne song he knows Cas loves for unknown reasons—
Dean rolls his eyes. “Bobby’s not going to fire me.”
“Did you come?” Cas says, just tapping the cane across Dean’s ass a few more times.
Dean follows the commands without the conscious decision to. If it were anyone but Cas, it would scare him how quickly he is to respond, how deep he can go. But he knows he can trust Cas to ease him back to the surface.
up a fight, my eyes already flashing
In the morning, Dean texts Cas a tweet screenshot that says:
“Yeah?”
Cas looks away. “I’ve tried to be subtle. I thought it might be a violation of boundaries.”
There’s an angel waiting for him. Castiel, with bright blue eyes and mahogany hair and huge black wings. He’s a warrior, he tells Dean, but all angels pay their dues introducing new people to Heaven.
“I think I would enjoy that,” Castiel says. He pulls out his phone and Dean recites his number. A moment later, his own phone buzzes with an incoming text. Castiel really is a dork, because all it says is,
“Dean,” Cas says, taking Dean’s face between both of his hands. “None of this bothers me. If you’re aroused by things I do to you, I’ll consider that a compliment. Now go.”

The Monday after their getaway, it’s past midnight and Dean is staring at Cas’s painting. He thinks it might be finished. Or maybe not. Maybe he needs another few weeks to try to correct some of the mistakes. It was dumb of him to take on something that feels so important, but in the end, he decides he’s done it: the angel has been chiseled free and stands defiant in dark paint, a warrior hiding a gentle soul behind razor-edged feathers.
🙄 Incorrigible
“No,” Cas says, and now he sounds almost incredulous. Giddy, too, huffing out a laugh. “I haven’t been with anyone since I realized — well, not for a really long time.” He uncovers his face, smiling up at Dean. “Is that what it’s like? Being an omega?”

Is there a night we can hang out this week?
Cas doesn’t touch him again — it’s just the cane, until Dean’s sobbing with knuckles clenched-white into the sheets. Cas knows how much he can take, and rides just along that line until Dean is striped with welts and bruises.

Dean’s face burns hotter but he gets up, back into the chair, staring at the food so he doesn’t have to look at Cas.
“It’ll save us from having to tell anyone ourselves,” Cas says.
Dean rushes to change into his hot-date underwear and kneel next to the couch in the time it takes Cas to walk from next door. Cas lets himself in as always, but he pauses when he sees Dean waiting on his knees.
Cas looks momentarily startled, as if he hadn’t really imagined
“Cas, why is there porn on the tv?”
“I want you to decide for yourself, because there’s no expectation,” Cas says. “If you wanted, I would take you to bed. Otherwise, I would be perfectly happy with a beer and Dr. Sexy.”
“Fine. Send the text,” Dean says.
“Did you have a productive afternoon?”
, his thoughts repeat. Just scratching itches, nothing personal. The glow Dean had been basking in dims.
“Because you’re ace or because you like to wear women’s underwear? I appreciate both of those things.”
Cas is gone before Dean makes it to his feet, which is for the best considering how much his over-eager fingers struggle with his bootlaces. Finally he makes it to the couch and goes down on his knees again.
“Get up so I can kiss you,” Cas says.
Cas rolls onto his side to pull Dean close and starts to run fingers through his hair. Dean’s a little surprised by it—he’s not sure why he needs aftercare over a massage—but isn’t going to ruin it by pointing that out.
Dean blushes, looks down. “I’m glad you like it. I was worried you’d hate it and, you know, put it in the back of your closet with the Simon Says one.”
“I’m sorry.” Dean sounds broken even to his own ears. “I should have known better.”
“You are such a good boy,” Cas says, warm against Dean’s ear. “And so beautiful.”
Cas arches an eyebrow in his
“By the way, that was way better than when I was a kid, cuz I actually get to suck your cock later.”
“I’d like to use my belt, if that’s ok with you.” His voice is calm, but Dean spots a slight tremor in his hand as he reaches out to cup Dean’s jaw in one of his warm palms. “And I’d like you to look at me.”
swallows nested under the carport.
Dean turns around so he can face Cas. There’s barely any space between them, so close Dean thinks if he really concentrated, he might be able to feel the heat from Cas’s skin. “All of my clothes?”
Despite the ruffled hair and pink cheeks, Cas is much smoother as he climbs in after Dean, straddling his hips. Dean tugs at Cas’s shirt and then sits up enough to pull off his own, so the next kiss is bare skin to bare skin. Cas’s mouth is insistent and so is the roll of his hips, hardening cocks pressed together in a slow grind, and then he leaves Dean’s lips to kiss a line straight to his scent gland, hesitating only a moment before he rubs his cheek against Dean’s neck.
“Ah,” Cas says.

In the end, he goes six days, just because Cas smiles and says
Cas grabs Dean’s hair and jerks his head back. “Do you think you have a choice?”
“None of your other friends are as cool as me.”

Cas is dying. His heart is pounding a galloping staccato, or maybe it’s not beating at all, and his lungs have closed like a vise. He hiccups around an attempt at breathing, thoughts spinning and spinning and spinning —

“Something happened with Cas,” Dean says, trying to sound sad. Like maybe he told Cas about his feelings and was rejected just like he’s always feared.
There’s only one seat left on the bus when Dean gets on. Plenty of times he would choose to stand, for no other reason than his tentacles can take up a lot of space, but it’s been a goddamn long day and he no longer cares about the indignity of squeezing in next to strangers. Except, of course, the girl on Dean’s left side keeps glancing at his tentacles, her lip pulled back. He does his best to ignore her and let the movement of the bus under him and the sound of a good-enough podcast in his ears lull him, but he keeps catching sight of her out of the corner of his eye and he thinks he sees her lips form the word
Dean rolls his eyes. “I didn’t touch my phone.”
Long before eternity, I caught a glimpse
But slowly, things start to turn. The group of Yeerks quietly supporting the human rebels — they’ve managed to keep it on the DL that Cas is an Andalite, stranded and stuck as he is — grows. Dean’s natural diplomacy serves them well when he’s not drowning himself in drink.
“Yeah, you’re – you’re asexual. Right? That’s what you said when…” He can’t finish the sentence, flushing red in embarrassment even in the silence of his own apartment, nothing but heartbeats.
Dean hesitates for a moment, not sure if he should push, but ends up dropping it. “Take off some clothes.”
I don’t remember his last
“Yes,” Cas says, laying back on the bed, shoulder-to-shoulder with Dean. “In a little bit.”
“A picnic,” Cas says.
When Dean wakes, it’s to paramedics surrounding him, the worst pain he’s ever felt, and loss itching at the back of his mind.
Like always after they scene, Cas draws Dean into his arms and touches him carefully, mindful of the marks he’s left. He rubs Dean’s back, he pets his hair, he slips his fingers underneath Dean’s sleeve to squeeze his arm. Dean usually tucks underneath his chin, warm and safe and glowing, but now he resists a little. He tilts his chin upwards, lips parting, eyes on Cas’s mouth.
Dean laughs and squeezes Cas’s thigh. “Sounds awesome.”
“Cas, do you even – you don’t like guys. You don’t like
The bus slows to a halt, but Dean hesitates before standing. “I’m serious about hanging out sometime. If you want.”
“You know I’ll survive if we don’t spend every Friday together, Dean,” Cas says.
Cas snorts and kneels to untie and tug off Dean’s shoes. Dean’s no help at all, just staring at Cas below him. Cas, submissive on his knees. No—Cas, on his knees but still all Dom, because Cas doesn’t have to put on some performance of Domination, like all it takes is macho posturing to be good for a submissive. Even if it weren’t for the tell-tale grey eye, he just radiates it. He’s nerdy and loves cats and cries when the love of Dr. Steamy’s life dies on Dr. Sexy and bends at Dean’s knees to help him take off his shoes, but he’s still the most
“That’s cool as fuck,” he finds himself saying. “Where’d you get it? My friend needs one.”
“I suppose I’ll just have to deal with it, because I would like to make love to you now.”
“I’ve seen you in various states of undress,” Cas says. “Should I care that it’s different? I like this better than your tacky boxers.”
“I’m not sure you can scrub the sink any cleaner.” Cas presses a kiss on the back of Dean’s neck, just above the collar of his t-shirt. “Go to the bedroom and take off your clothes. Face down on the bed.”
Dean laughs. On the inside, he’s glowing. This is the opposite of

Dean laughs. Looks at the cabin, looks at Cas. “Race ya,” he says, and drops Cas’s hand to run.
Dean grins down at the pan of greens, feeling more like himself than he has since—well, last time he and Cas scened together. The tingling joy of submission and prickle of arousal are coursing through him at the same time and he almost feels weak at the knees, like some part of him knows he should be kneeling for his Dom.

The pain is an awful—wonderful—thud mixed with a whistling-sharp smack. By the third hit, Dean knows his ass is going to be polka-dotted from the holes drilled in the wooden paddle.
Without meaning to, Dean’s hand slides under Cas’s t-shirt to feel the warm, smooth skin of his lower back. Belatedly, he asks, “This ok?”
Cas gives him a long look, then pushes his mug across the glass table. “I would like a refill, please.”
I was going to ask your advice for young writers, but I think you just answered that. Is there any advice you would give to yourself when you were a young writer?

Dean can’t tell if he’s mocking or not so he goes with honesty. “I want more.”

“Cool.” Dean stands, tosses his backpack over his shoulder. He has a feeling Castiel might shake things up a little, brush off the dusty shelves of boredom. “Talk to you soon, Cas.”
“Do you like wood?” Cas asks, the paddle dropped to the side for him to squeeze and knead at Dean’s already tender flesh.
“What?” Dean says, stepping back for Cas to come through the door on impulse. “Why?”
“Uh,” Dean says, not entirely comprehending the question. By the time he collects his thoughts, Cas has forged on ahead.
Cas keeps all hours, which is to say he hardly sleeps, so it’s not a surprise for Dean to wake in the middle of the night and see a notification from Cas on his phone. Dean goes on DND for the night, but he still checks to see if there’s something from Cas any time he wakes. Usually it’s nothing out of the ordinary—picture of Greebo, line of poetry, nerdy meme—but this time Dean double-takes.

Dean grins and pulls out his phone to pull it up. “She’s going to freak out. I’m Dean, by the way.”
Dean wakes up with an omega tucked under his chin, bare in his arms. Their scents have merged on the air, Cas’s spinning clouds and Dean’s meadow at dusk, and Dean takes a moment to revel in it, a purr starting to rumble in his chest. It’s been a long time since Dean has marked, and been marked in turn, like this.

Cas was worried, but agreed easily enough to a drive into the Hill Country. They don’t talk at first, just humming idly along to Bad Company, Cas watching the traffic pass out the passenger window. When they’re finally clear of the city limits, Cas lets out a long sigh like he’s been holding his breath for days.
This is the best day ever! I’m telling everyone right now.”
Dean whines, digging his nails into Cas’s back to try to pull him closer for a long kiss, and then several more, as Cas buries himself deep. “You feel so good, sweetheart,” Cas murmurs, and Dean nods in agreement, then tilts his chin so he can kiss Cas again.
Dean’s eyes snap over to him. “She

Meg is a Yeerk but has kinda started to see how fucked up the whole thing is. Her and her human start working together to resist from within the Yeerk power structure.
Dean startles. “Shit, wear a bell.”
Dean tilts his chin to bare his throat further, a purr starting up in his chest again as Cas kisses across his shoulder. He distantly wonders if Cas wishes he had a purr to share, too, or if his soft growls are as good a replacement for him as they are for Dean, luxurious under an omega’s pleasure.
Cas’s mouth opens, then shuts again. Dean flushes pink but doesn’t take it back, and finally Cas says, “You like me?”
“You are so beautiful,” Cas says, and then, with a smile that lights up Dean’s heart, “And now you’re mine.”

The crop comes down hard across Dean’s ass. “Are you sure about that?”
Cas’s eyes narrow. “Are you the boss now?”

“Really?” Dean asks, breathy as a second finger pushes in.
“So, uh…” Dean holds up the lipstick and eyeliner Cas chose for him, giving them a quick questioning shake.

Dean fumbles for his phone and ignores all the notifications except the message from Cas. The message from this afternoon said,

“Good,” Dean says, which is an understatement. He feels incredible, better than he has in a long, long time. “You?”
Dean uses his hand to finish Cas off, and this time most of it manages his cheek and lips, sliding down his chin, and Dean greedily laps up what his tongue can reach. Cas stares down at him, reverent, and swipes a thumb through the mess before pressing his finger into Dean’s mouth.
Dean touches the collar and says, “Me too. Come to bed with me. I just want to — hold you, or something.”
“Nah,” Dean says. “It really is stupid.” He does something he’s never done on the bus before, holding out his hand in the human custom. “I’m Dean.”
“I understand,” Cas says. “It’s instinctual.”
It doesn’t always work. He’d spend a weekend working on Charlie’s car because she’s one of his best friends and shouldn’t have to overpay some asshole that’s going to try to take advantage of her just because she’s a woman, but no way in hell would he spend a weekend on his knees in the dirt, digging a row of holes for Charlie to fill with flowers. Still, every damn spring he’s out there with Cas, planting the beds on both sides of their shared yard.

Cas looks over at him. Just a regular look, at Dean’s face, not a leer at the lace on his chest. “What’s it?”
“Careless.”
You use Twitter regularly, and social media can be pretty brutal. Do you search yourself to see what people are saying? Do you read all of the reviews of your books?

Dean’s excuse for not keeping Charlie’s beer of choice in his fridge is that she has terrible taste, but the truth is that he’d buy any kind of trash Cas liked. It’s just a stroke of luck that he and Cas mostly like the same stuff.
he’s teasing, his heart falls and lands crooked. He’s not an idiot around other Doms like he is with Cas,
“Oh,” Dean says, hoping his voice doesn’t sound too faint.
[laughing] Hell no — I know better than that. I try to stay out of the drama the best I can; that’s the job of whatever marketing lackey that runs my official social media accounts. Apologies to whoever I just referred to as a lackey.
Cas drops the remote and takes two predatory steps towards Dean—Dean’s heart stutters then gallops ahead—before halting abruptly, the surprise flashing across his face morphing into something grimmer. “I need to go.”
“You’re so beautiful,” Cas is saying, “and so good. I hope I’ll be able to have you again.”

“Dammit, Dean,” Cas sighs. “You’re doing my laundry.”
Despite the wings and the grace and the almost-invincibility, Dean is endearingly, infuriatingly human. Even at that first moment, with Cas’s knife sticking out of his chest, Dean grinned like he was greeting an old friend and said, “Heya, Cas.” They were both lost—or found—after that.
Dean tilts his head up. Their mouths are close, enough that Dean can see the faintest white line of a scar just over Cas’s top lip. Just as Cas starts to close the distance between them, Dean’s alarm begins its morning shrieking.

After that, Cas doesn’t apologize. He doesn’t even ask, just jerks Dean off his cock by the hair and paints him white. Sometimes when he’s fucking Dean, he’ll pull out and come all over his lower back, dripping down his hole, somehow more obscene than if he had actually come inside Dean. Sometimes he jerks Dean off and then makes Dean suck his fingers clean, taste his own bitter pleasure.

an act all along.
Dean’s hands are stained navy and leave a streak of it across Cas’s shirt when they curl together in bed, but Cas doesn’t seem to mind. He just traces his fingertips along the edge of the collar, over and over again, a soothing habit he never gives up, no matter how many years pass.
“It’s ok,” Dean says. It is. No one has done this to him since back when he got picked up on streetcorners for a couple bucks, but being marked by Cas feels… right. It’s like the handprint never left.
Reveal your secrets
“Can I ask why?”
The doorbell rings and Dean jumps up to get the food. They talk with the seamless code of longtime friends, stories retold and disagreements rehashed, like Cas saying he had a “James Joyce kind of day,” which means he wrote about six words but doesn’t know what order they go in. Dean really was productive without the distraction of his phone but refuses to admit it.
They sit next to each other on the couch, knees bumping. “I meant to give this to you over the weekend,” Cas says. “But I was — a coward, basically, afraid that you wouldn’t want it. But I.” His hands are unsteady as he picks up the box and he fiddles with the latch. “You can say no. I understand if it’s too soon, or if you don’t want —”
“I guess that one time I—” The next hit bites off the end of the sentence and turns it into a whimper spilling out of Dean’s mouth.
“The scenic route. Got some food in the trunk, maybe we can find somewhere to stop and eat.”
Cas gave up on holding back his laughter two beers ago, and now he can’t stop, especially with the way Dean seems to glow under Cas’s joy. His smile grows wider, his impressions more exaggerated, the fish get bigger in his stories.
“Then what?” Dean asks quietly. “You met someone?”

Dean pauses outside the door to Cas’s closet. As familiar as Cas’s home is, Dean’s never been rummaging in his closet, and it feels like both a thrill and a violation. In the end there’s not much rummaging anyway—Dean spots the cane right away, and then he’s rushing out the back door with it and back across the lawn.
You, I mean
Can’t believe I had to find out from OUR WEED DEALER that you and Cas finally got it together!!!!!! Omg I hate you I’m so happy for you
Slowly like the ebbing tide, Dean comes back to himself. His pillow is cool under his cheek. Cas is sitting on the bed next to him, stroking his hair and murmuring.
Cas snorts, and then it turns into a full-blown laugh, hiding his face with a hand. “Now

“It’s for ace pride.”
It doesn’t help that Jimmy makes him feel similarly. Andalites are monogamous to a fault so it must be something about human physiology that is making him so confused.
Just as careful, Dean says, “You weren’t before now?”
That loneliness appeared on earth as this body.

Dean would’ve met a woman. Married her, built a white-picket fence, never felt shame. A woman who is soft and sweet and doesn’t hurt him for fun or put him in a collar like she has the right to own him. A woman who would never refer to him as a possession.

“I understand if not, that’s probably more than you wanted or expected and I shouldn’t have even—”
He doesn’t expect Cas to respond, but he sits there in silence for awhile anyway, just staring at the wall above Cas’s inert body.

There’s a cabin outside the city, right on the Guadalupe River and nearly as old as Texas. Standing by the river after dumping their bags inside, Dean says, “This is amazing. We got the weekend here?”

“Sue me for liking a little routine in my life,” Dean says.

“I still have your jacket,” Dean says in a rush, immediately feeling like a fucking moron. It’s not the only thing he still has of Cas’s — on their sixth date, Cas brought him flowers, and no one has ever brought Dean flowers before, so he kept one even after it became brittle and delicate, and it’s still carefully tucked in a box in his closet. It’s not like he pulls it out to look at it, but he doesn’t forget it’s there, even though it’s been months since Cas left. Like it helps, Dean says, “I know it was your favorite.”
“I made out with guys in the closet, too,” Dean says, giving Cas a cheeky smile and then stepping closer. “Turn out the light.”
“Anything you want,” Dean says, meaning it.
Every day since Cas went under, Dean has been coming to the room to talk to him. He’s not actually sure if he hopes Cas can hear or not, because he’s been saying the kind of shit he would never say if Cas were conscious, speaking quietly between them like the walls have ears. (They might; Sam is always lurking around waiting for Dean to have a moment of Feelings that he can take advantage of.)
Cas kisses the round of Dean’s shoulder. Dean’s purrs intensify and he gives Cas a smile, weirdly shy considering what they were just doing. To cover it up, Dean says, “I can’t believe I ended up in the wet spot.”
“I would like to offer you a proposal,” Castiel says. After a beat of silence: “Though, to be honest, it didn’t go very well the last time I did this.”
“Unlocked.” Cas gives a soft squeeze to Dean’s flank. “Quickly, please.”

They cuddle together until Dean’s stomach gives an enormous rumble. They eat, and they watch bad tv, and Dean goes home to sleep alone.
“Guess that ship has sailed,” Dean says. It barely hurts, because he locked away whatever feelings for Cas he started to have months ago. A Russian doll of locked treasure chests, ensuring they never escape.
Castiel looks at his phone for the six hundredth time that hour.

Charlie has her own place and lets Cas crash there after Cas became tragically human. Dean spends more and more time at Charlie’s, teaching Cas the intricacies of humanity, and though things are actually better with Jimmy’s uncle since he became a Controller, Jimmy is usually hanging around, too.
Cas takes a deep, shuddering breath, then slowly lays on his back, throwing his arm over his eyes. “Just — just a second.”
“Yes,” Cas says, rolling his eyes and straightening Dean’s shirt, just because he can’t stop touching.
Dean opens the bottom drawer, one he rarely ventures into with clients, and pulls out a thin black cane, the rubber smooth under his hand.
Despite the smile, dread starts to trickle in.

“Good boy,” Cas says, and Dean makes that small noise he often does, like it’s both a surprise and delight to hear it.
That pleased little hum again, then he straddles Dean’s thighs, taking a long moment just to look him over. Dean blushes all the way down his chest under his Dom’s appreciation. It’s even better knowing that Cas loves him.
“What are friends for, if not to help with withdrawal?”

Approximately 68 minutes ago, this happened: Castiel texted a man that had been flirting with him – he was pretty sure – for weeks. There was a lot of texting and goofy smiles and ventures outside Castiel’s Safe Zone for group outings. Castiel felt brave to text:

They can’t figure out this fucking curse. Cas is still as a corpse but still breathing, heart still beating, limbs still warm to the touch, but he won’t wake up no matter what they do.

“Yeah,” Dean says, smiling. “It’s just like that.”
Dean rolls his eyes, and Cas realizes with a sinking feeling in his gut that Dean is doing his best to escape him. Cas says, “If I’ve done something to offend —”
“Or what? He’s going to waltz in with the key you gave him to get some tea because he’s out? The tea you don’t drink but keep buying? Because you’re in love with him?”
Dean snorts and peels the soiled shirt over his head. “No, baby. I’ll do better.”
Dean spends a long time working his way across the right shoulder and all the way down to Cas’s fingers, then just as long on the other side. Cas is plenty vocal in his appreciation, and Dean grins to himself, pleased to please his Dom.
Cas takes a careful breath. “I’ve become attracted to you.”
“No, dude, of course. You need weed again or…?”
“What the fuck,” Dean whispers. He’d almost been sure Cas was going to—
it. And he’s wearing Thor boxers, easily Cas’s least favorite Avenger and likely to spark an argument that would distract from whatever Cas’s current plan is.
When Dean comes out of the bathroom in a pair of sweats and worn-soft t-shirt, hair still damp, Cas is sitting awkwardly on the edge of the bed. His nostrils flare to take in Dean’s scent, then he blushes and looks away.
It doesn’t take long—it never does when he thinks about Cas—and then he’s drying and dressing and heading across the yard, lush spring grass tickling his feet and ankles. Cas is waiting at the table, taking a hit off his purple tentacle pipe. He gestures at Dean to come closer, and Dean bends down for an almost-kiss, smoke drifting from Cas’s mouth to his.
They don’t kiss that often, even though there are a lot of moments, both during their clearly delineated scenes and outside of them, where Dean thinks Cas might want to. Dean certainly wants to, constantly and mostly inappropriately, because he wants to know what all of Cas’s kisses feel like. He wants to know what an

“Good choice,” Cas murmurs, suddenly right behind Dean. He reaches around to take the cane out of Dean’s hand, flicks it in the air. “You’re going to like this.”
“You don’t run unless there are zombies!” Cas says, and Dean yells — breathless already, dammit — over his shoulder: “Pretend to be a zombie then!”
Dean flashes Cas a smile and tries not to blush under Cas’s watchful eyes as he dresses in a pair of purple lace panties and his civvies. “Where to, sir?” Dean says, shoving his feet in his boots.

Dean nods, then manages a rough, “I’m here.”
Dean tugs Cas down for another kiss as Cas’s hand drifts down Dean’s body, mapping the hard of his sternum and soft of his belly and velvet of his cock. Dean spreads his legs, tossing one knee over Cas’s hip, wanton and shameless.
Instead of offering up his hand, Cas tilts his head to bare his throat, holding Dean’s gaze as he does it. Dean wants to play it cool, but he knows that the rush of his pleased and

“Ash said, and I quote, that ‘Cas is definitely the “D” to Dean’s “s.”’” Dean’s going to protest, but Charlie sees the truth—a version of it, at least—on his face and crows with delight. “Oh my god, this is the best. You’re so happy, right?”

Dean and Cas both laugh, and surely Charlie heard it, so Dean gestures Cas over until they’re both in the frame.
They eat tacos sitting on the floor of their hotel room, sharing chips and guac and bickering over which Discworld books are best. Cas loves Tiffany Aching —
Dean nudges Cas’s hip with his foot. “I guess I’m still the cis unicorn in my friend group.”
Maybe Dean’s just bored in general. Every day feels like a repeat of the last; he feels like he can’t escape Tuesdays and never quite got the hang of Thursdays. He spends 105 hours praying for the weekend and then 55 hours not knowing what to do with himself. He feels like he’s seen everything there is to see on tv, even his favorites stale. It feels like there are no good books left. Thanks to some bacterial infestation, the lake isn’t swimmable.
Before Dean can beg, Cas gives him a third finger and leans down to rub his cheek on Dean’s chest, just over where his purring originates, murmuring something sweet and worshipful into his skin.
The pause lasts forever and Dean chugs beer, hoping the alcohol will clear the cobwebs in his brain. He wants to ask Cas to say it again, just so he can savor it, just so he can jerk off thinking about it.
Cas’s face softens. “I’m sorry. I was just teasing.”
Dean takes off his headphones and shrugs. “It’s a free bus, man.”
The first one wasn’t even a question. “It must be difficult to work in a technology field when omegas are empirically proven to be worse in STEM subjects. I’m sure it’s discouraging to know your options for advancement are limited by your gender.”

Still kneeling, Cas tugs down Dean’s boxers so he can leave them in a puddle on the floor along with his jeans. Dean’s steadier than he lets on, selfishly enjoying Cas’s arm around him as they make their way to the master bathroom.
“No, wait,” Dean says. “Of course I — Jesus, Cas, of course. I just didn’t expect — no one has ever asked before.” Dean takes a deep breath, and before Cas can respond, he slides off the couch to the floor, on his knees in front of Cas. “Please.”

The break means the next hit hurts worse than even the first one with a galaxy of bruises already mottling his ass, and Dean muffles a moan against his arm.
“How do you feel?” Cas asks, climbing into bed and pulling Dean into his arms.

“Disappointing.”
Dean reaches out and touches Cas’s hand, his slender fingers. This vessel never gets gun and shovel callouses like the one covering Dean’s hands. And because Dean is drunk, he does something he’s only done in life-or-death situations before, touching Cas’s face, just the back of his knuckles brushing down Cas’s cheek. He kind of expects the skin to be clammy, but it’s not; it’s rough with stubble that’s not any longer than it was the day Cas went under but soft and warm underneath. “Cas,” Dean says quietly, voice breaking. “Need you, man.”
Cas takes a moment to roll Dean’s balls in his hand, then reaches lower to where he’s wet and desperate. Cas slides his middle finger in, all at once, and Dean sighs into it as his body opens easily. He’s not going to admit how many times he’s fucked himself with a dildo lately, pretending it was Cas’s fingers or cock.
Cas’s eyes widen. “Neither do I. I assure you, that wasn’t my intention. In fact, I’m — I’m asexual.”
“Color?”
Dean swallows and nods, but his entire focus is on Cas’s other hand, sliding from the small of his back up to his hair. Cas kisses the back of Dean’s neck, softly, then drags him to the bed and shoves him chest-down over it, ass canted into the air.

Dean catches sight of Cas’s blush before he turns over onto his hands and knees, presenting himself to Dean. Dean drapes himself over Cas’s back, pressing a kiss to the nape of his neck and then nuzzling at his scent gland. “Hey there, omega,” Dean murmurs, and Cas shudders underneath him.

“You look lovely like that,” Cas says, approaching but not touching.
“We’ll need to add a second room,” Cas says, pulling out his wallet.
“Oh, is that so?” Cas says. “Turn over.”
Dean takes a deep, slow breath, humming in contentment, before he fully realizes where he is and who he’s wrapped around.
“I don’t?” Nerd says, head tilting like he’s looking down at himself.
Dean grumbles. “Yeah, that’s what I told her. Her fault for scheduling during our movie night.”
“Mm?” Cas hums, rubbing his cheek and nose and chin on the ball of Dean’s shoulder.

Cas grinning is a beautiful sight, both the grey and the blue of his eyes equally stunning in the bright light of the kitchen. “Aside from all of that, you did lie to me.”
“Green,” Dean says without hesitation.
“Is that a yes?”
Dean has to physically bite his tongue to keep from protesting, but he can feel himself blushing red down to his chest.
The instant, visceral image of a paddle in Cas’s hands makes Dean flush. He nods, not trusting himself to speak.
dear john,
Dean closes his eyes, the buzz fading into a glow.
Dean settles on the floor on the pillow that is always waiting for him there and accepts the pipe when Cas hands it over. He takes a long hit, holds it until his lungs start to protest. Things are always a little soft around the edges when he’s at Cas’s feet, but the weed hits him hard and fast and he sinks deeper.

“Just so you know, the cat was dead at the time,” Dean says.
“It was an accident!”
Dean doesn’t want it to stop. He wants to go down, under, blackout, bruises around his neck, but Cas lets him breathe as the final spurt of come coats his fingers.
“It’s better for you,” Cas repeats. “You have to leave.”

Cas responds with the eye-roll emoji a few minutes later, and Dean grins the whole time he’s pouring two mugs of coffee and walking through their yard. Cas is waiting at the table on his deck, and he calls out, “We’re not making a cat castle!”
i’d never felt powerful you needed me before
“Cas, I know. Seriously.” Dean flushes a little and says, “You’re the best Dom I’ve ever had.”
Tentatively, Dean settles back down with his head on Cas’s shoulder, Cas’s arm curling around his middle. Cas presses his face back into Dean’s hair and says, “I like your scent.”
“Ok,” Dean rasps. He shifts his hips so Cas can reach hands between him and the counter, working his button open and zipper down, but otherwise is still.
out of your ash streets. i needed you, too.
The guy looks startled, like the idea hadn’t even occurred to him. Dean feels an absurd affection towards him for it. “That’s ridiculous,” he says, and then, with a slight grimace, “I hope that doesn’t sound flippant.”

“If you’re comfortable with that.”
“I — have a store on Redbubble. Aces and Spades.”
Dean’s not sure if he should feel bad for thinking about Cas when he jerks off. Cas clearly doesn’t mind Dean getting off on some of their scenes, but sometimes it still feels like it might be a violation to imagine Cas’s participation in a wild variety of fantasies.

“Well, you know. Omegas are over-emotional.” Dean turns his head so Cas can see his grin. “I like when you get feisty.”
The angel has been chiseled free and stands defiant in dark paint, a warrior hiding a gentle soul behind razor-edged feathers.
The soft kisses pressed into each of the dimples at the base of Dean’s spine may be the most intimate thing they’ve done, and he goes a little weak in the knees, glad for the counter to hold him up. Before he can think too much about it, the paddle comes down across his ass again. The impact shudders down into his thighs.
Dean pours more massage oil and rubs deep circles into Cas’s lower back. The moment is hushed, something about it more intimate than anything else they’ve done. Maybe because Dean doesn’t get the opportunity to touch Cas like this very often, thorough and worshipful.
Silence.
“What the hell? No, I’m just trying to — what you saw — it was magic. Like, real magic.”

Dean wonders if Cas is thinking about the first time they kissed, if it feels the same on purpose. The burn of welts against the bedding, the way Cas takes him slow but sure, sharing soft gasps and moans against each other’s mouths.
“People are assholes,” Dean says, tossing him a grin. “You’ve been holding out on me, though.”

The second time, Dean is back on the bicycle of deepthroating, taking all of Cas with practiced ease, no gagging even when Cas puts his hands in Dean’s hair and holds him there until Dean goes a little dizzy with need for air. Despite Cas’s iron grip on the back of his head, Dean manages to pull off and says, chin tilted up, “Come on my face, Cas.”
Cas laughs and swipes at his eyes. “That’s a fantastic idea.”
I’ve noticed a very clear difference between the majority of your social media accounts and the ‘roguecjmilton’ Twitter. Namely, there’s significantly less of your husband and kitten on the others.

Cas turns his face away, jaw clenched. “Apparently not.”

“I know. You’re always good.” Dean flushes and ducks his head down, but Cas urges him to look back up with a gentle finger on Dean’s chin. “Say it.”
Dean told Cas just last week that they should make a cardboard palace for Greebo, and this is just more evidence for the genius of the idea.

“Will you shut up?” Dean says. “Yes.”
“Dean Winchester,” Cas says, solemnly. “You should know by now that you’re the best thing to ever happen to me. I love you more than I knew was possible, and I can’t imagine my life without you.” He fumbles in his pocket and pulls out a simple silver ring, glinting in the sunlight. “Will you let me be your husband?”
“Yeah, I’m pretty damn lucky,” Dean says. It was supposed to come out mostly sarcastic, but he’s not sure he succeeded.
I assume you’re being melodramatic. Hangover?

“Enough for what?” Dean says. “We’re having fun, right?”
“I one hundred percent know that’s off the table. I’m not an idiot.”
“I hate to admit it,” Cas says, “but you might be right.”
Dean grins and says, “There’s come on your shirt.”
“Our friendship is—different,” Cas says. He hurries to fill the moment of silence after that with, “But you’re right. We could.”
This is enough, Dean tells himself. This is more than he could’ve dreamed, so it has to be enough.
Is there anything you hope to teach people with your writing? Whether about queer people or in general?
Cas presses closer, a soft growl matching Dean’s purr, and Dean presses a kiss into his hair. “G’morning,” Cas mumbles.
Cas leans down to kiss Dean, tongue tracing the same path as the crop across Dean’s mouth. When they part, he stares into Dean’s eyes for a long moment before he asks, “Choking?”
Dean takes a gulp of coffee. “Is that something you’d be into?” When Cas’s eyes widen a bit, he rushes to add, “It’s not like we’re seeing anyone right now. And I—I miss it.”
Cas doesn’t make him wait long. He looks over Dean as he approaches, the cane light in his hands, but it’s not the kind of look Dean is used to when he’s laid out bare for the taking. Cas is still devouring him, but in a subtly different way than previous Doms—it’s something about the way his eyes don’t pause at Dean’s ass, like each inch of him is equally delectable, not just the parts that lead to orgasms.

specifically. They’re just scratching each other’s itches.
You have no idea what kind of weird shit I’m into.
Cas smiles, but only with his mouth. “Right.”
It sounds like he’s kidding, but Dean still says, “Really, or joking? Because I don’t have to say stupid shit like that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel isn’t used to appearing human and he doesn’t know how to control his vessel, doesn’t know how to hide the affection in his gaze or the way he hugs Dean, openly, when they meet after a long time away. One day, Dean reaches across the seat and puts his hand in Castiel’s and they drive all day like that, just a comfort-touch between them.
Dean squeezes his eyes shut tight with shame and whispers, “I’m sorry.”
See you then
“I’m going to kiss you, if that’s ok.”
“What? Why?” Dean wiggles the beers in his hand. “I bought that kind you like, asshole.”
The bus stops. Cas gives Dean another smile and gets off.
“The pleasure is mine,” Dean says, flashing a grin. “So, Castiel, what’s with all the books?”
“All of you,” Cas says, soft like a confession.
“I forgot about homophobia.”
The message from ten minutes ago is a picture of Cas and Greebo, Cas’s face only half in the frame to center the ever-growing kitten. Dean can admit that Greebo is pretty cute for a cat, but it’s Cas he’s looking at, his grey eye glinting in the sun from the picture window in his office, his hair unruly, his mouth tilted up into a small smile.
When Cas’s breath hitches just right, Dean says, “C’mon, Cas, c’mon,” clenching around him and squeezing his arms tighter around his shoulders, and Cas comes with a sharp bite to Dean’s bottom lip.
Cas doesn’t even appear to read the text before he goes to night mode and drops his phone back on the coffee table. Dean does the same, then shifts closer to Cas, laying his head on his shoulder. “Ravish me, huh?”
Cas takes the hint and they’re kissing, the brush of lips turning into the slide of tongues, the kind of long, languid makeout Dean hasn’t had in forever. They kiss all the way until Dean is back on land again, shaking sky or sea out of his hair.
There’s something in Cas’s voice Dean’s not sure he likes, and he reaches out tentatively to touch his thigh. “Did I do something wrong?”
“I want it to be like that,” Cas says, and Dean laughs before leaning down for a sweet, lingering kiss. Softly running his thumb across Dean’s cheek, Cas says, “Now, how do I make you feel good?”
Cas can’t see Dean roll his eyes, so Dean pokes him in the ribs and is rewarded with what sounds suspiciously like a giggle, then Cas coughs it away and says, “Let’s proceed with the massage part of this evening. We’re not getting any younger.”
Their panel runs long — after a long day attending talks themselves — and they walk back to the hotel in rigid silence, Dean’s jaw clenched. Cas is tense next to him, too, and Dean feels like an asshole for telling him it will be fun.
“Is he ok?” Charlie asks, and then she squints at the screen. “You are full of shit, Dean Winchester.”
Cas has never said no to spending time with Dean before — can’t get enough of him, actually — so it’s a fair question. Cas isn’t sure how to lie, so he says, “I’m experiencing a different kind of hunger.”
Dean runs his nose up Cas’s throat and to the scent gland tucked under his jaw, salt spilled and forgotten on the carpet. Dean barely stops himself from rubbing his cheek there, leaving his own scent behind, if only briefly.
“Not quite yet,” Cas agrees.

“That promotion was pure nepotism.”
A smile flickers across Cas’s face before he tamps it down. “Very good.” He holds out his hand and Dean takes it, letting Cas help him stand. Dean’s too old to be excited over hand-holding, but he still can’t think about anything other than Cas’s hand in his as he’s led to the kitchen.
It’s great to chat with you today, CJ.
Says. Everything you do, you must ask permission first.”
Dean hates this. He’s not a sub who likes humiliation, and this feels almost as bad. “I’m always good.”
“Nah, we’ve got time.”
Dean is on his feet before Cas finishes speaking. He can feel Cas’s eyes on his back as he crosses the yard, and Cas watches him with the same intense gaze as he returns.

“I don’t,” Dean repeats. “Where is this coming from? Am I doing something wrong?”
“Apparently.” Cas sits up and stretches his arms over his head. Dean’s mouth goes dry at the enticing flex of his upper arms and shoulders, but he turns away quickly, dragging himself to the en suite.
Cas took a deep breath and said, “Your assertion that omegas are ‘empirically proven’ to be worse than alphas at anything is blatantly false. The glass ceiling stopping omegas and women of all secondary genders from advancing in STEM fields is not based on our biology but on misomegy and misogyny. Your bigotry is showing.”

Cas takes a deep, shaking breath, then gathers resolve and says, “I can’t do this anymore.”
“We’ll find it,” Sam says, turning pages quickly as he scans for more options.
“That sounds like a good thing,” Cas says.
“Do you know how hard it was for me to not tell you guys? Like, I did everything I could, and both of you were both still so—wait, OMG. I’m just now processing. You took my advice!”
“Why not?” Dean says, shrugging like it’s nothing. Like his heart isn’t ready to pound out of his chest.
“Yeah, that’s cool,” Dean says. “To both.”
“Shit,” Dean says. “We should go on DND.”
“Sorry about…” Dean gestures vaguely between them as he pulls away.
“Hey, sweetheart,” Dean murmurs back.
Dean cries out and clenches his fingers in the bedding. “Jesus, Cas!”
“Unless you have other plans,” Cas says, reaching to take Dean’s hand and squeezing.
Dean takes a deep, careful breath, then rubs the seven-o’-clock rough of his cheek against Cas’s neck. A low rumble rolls through Cas’s chest, a growl that sounds almost like a purr. Dean answers with a purr of his own that lasts only a few heartbeats, and then he’s nosing along Cas’s jawline towards his mouth. He can feel Cas stop breathing.
Cas lets himself be pulled into the bed. There’s an awkward moment where they just stare at each other with a pillow’s distance between them, then Dean rolls his eyes and shuffles until he can tuck his head under Cas’s chin. Cas arm wraps around him to hold him close but gentle, mindful of Dean’s bruises.
i swear i'm working on stories and not just poems! i wrote this one for a work friend. :)
“Like I said,” Dean forces himself to say, “what are friends for?”
unless you wanted them to. but we’ve left that behind.
Dean pours salt on his hand for another shot, but Cas grabs his wrist before he can lick it away. “Can I?”
Cas’s smile is morning-slow. “We don’t have to get up yet, do we?”

The first time they visit a Yeerk Pool, Dean goes home and cries. Fucking sobs. Because knowing intellectually what was happening was one thing, but actually hearing the screams was another, and they didn’t manage to save a single one of them. They came back with casualties, in fact — Cas is stuck in human morph, Jimmy’s clone, forever.

“I asked, didn’t I?”
“Hands and knees,” Cas says. Dean shuffles to get unresponsive limbs underneath him, but he manages. The new position makes his skin pull in different ways, pain flaring from the welts and bruises down his backside. “Touch yourself. I want you to come.”
“Sorry,” Dean says, but he can’t really stop the smile on his face. Cas makes him a lovesick idiot.

His fingers itch to type something petty into the quiet, but he forces himself away.
“Relationships aren’t transactional,” Dean says, parroting something Cas has told him more than once.
He’s staring, but he manages to say, “Lay down on your stomach?”
“In a little bit.”
“Baby, I’m sorry, but a client —”
Cas has been off all week—all his responses to Dean’s texts delayed and clipped, no sharing of joke tweets or funny cats, claiming he’s working every time Dean pops over—but when he skips out on game night at Charlie’s, Dean knows something’s really up. It’s probably ruining the sanctity of the I-need-you-but-won’t-ever-say-it-outright codeword, but Dean sends the text to Cas anyway.
Cas tosses the cane onto the bed and bends over Dean, blanketing him. Even his softest jeans are rough against Dean’s burning ass and thighs. “Don’t apologize,” Cas says, nuzzling into Dean’s hair. “You’re perfect. I knew you would like it.”
“Good boy,” Cas says, dropping the cane on the bed. Dean’s head has fallen low, forehead nearly pressed to the bed, but Cas jerks it back by the hair until they can look at each other. Dean’s mouth goes dry and he licks his lips, tasting the salt of tears he didn’t realize were falling. “You’re close, aren’t you?”

Charlie grins, her eyes practically twinkling, even across the phone. “Oh, I’m tweeting this shit. I’ll make you assholes go viral.”
The sun is warm and they lay perpendicular on the dock, Cas’s head pillowed on Dean’s stomach and Dean’s on a foam float. Everything feels still and calm, surrounded by the sound of birdsong, the occasional splash of a fish in the lake, leaves rustling together. Dean’s stomach rises and falls with his breath and he pets Cas’s hair absently.
and bites Dean’s neck again, harder, the way that makes Dean’s breath catch for a different reason. Another quick bite, then Cas sits up, one knee between Dean’s legs. “How does your ass feel?”

Dean fell a little more in love with him in that moment, and was too busy staring at Cas to even hear the next question. Luckily it was a softball from another omega and Dean caught up by the time he was expected to speak.
I KNOW I’M BEATING A DEAD HORSE BUT YOU SHOULD TALK TO HIM
Cas is really good at hurting Dean like this, and Dean is really good at taking—loving—it. Dean wears the bruises with pleasure, a secret between him and his Dom, and he knows these will be deep purple by morning. It doesn’t take long to get him drifting into the atmosphere, fingers clenched around the edge of the wood slab countertop on instinct to keep him from collapsing to the floor. He knows Cas asks his color again, and he knows he answers
“Perhaps you haven’t been paying attention.”
you brought me here, pulled me like
Cas growl-purrs and Dean smiles through the second lick, giving Cas the full flat of his tongue. By the fifth lick, Cas goes down on his elbows, face buried in the crook of his arm where his moans are muffled. Dean licks him wet and sloppy, until spit starts to drip like slick down the inside of Cas’s thighs.
“Ok,” Cas says, staring down at the counter.
“Mine is memory foam.”
“It’s not,” Cas interrupts.
“I wasn’t sure if you’d want to.”
Castiel shushes him, tells him he won’t remember anyway. This seems to upset Dean even more: he doesn’t want to forget. “I love you,” he whispers. He’s never said it to Castiel before.
I never imagined they’d rear
Cas pauses for them to catch their breath, but the reprieve is short before he starts to hit Dean again, working in a couple lashes across his shoulder blades that make him moan, too far gone to be self-conscious.
It seems like it takes a long time before Cas joins him, but Dean would wait forever, no matter how much the hard floor makes his knees ache. Dean keeps his gaze down as Cas finally approaches, but he can
“Always?”
“Hey there, hot stuff,” Dean says with a wink before he sits on the cushion next to Cas’s chair. He takes the pipe and lights up while Cas starts to stroke his hair. Cas is touchy when he’s high, but so is Dean, and he plans to take full advantage of it.
“Don’t stop,” Cas says, and leans forward to close his hand around Dean’s throat.
“Good. It would be kinda fucked up to be friends as long as we have and still not even know what my job is.”
we all see hauntings and none of us
“Dude, I’m so sorry. But — in my defense, you shouldn’t have snuck up on me. You weren’t even supposed to be home until tomorrow!”
“Oh,” Cas says, like he’d completely forgotten. “This may be an inopportune time to say this, but she thought I liked you a little too much to be seeing her. She’s right, and I walked in here ready to tell you.”
not everyone does.

That sounds like solid advice for all of us. Do you think your earlier books would be different if you took that advice?
It is.

Dean turns his head to nip at the pad of Cas’s thumb. “I would kill for you to finger me.”

The water pressure is so-so and Dean scrubs off the day quickly, suddenly exhausted in the way only air travel makes him. He didn’t mention to Cas how much he hates planes, but Cas kept giving him reassuring smiles and attempted to distract him with blasphemous opinions about sci-fi, so it must have been pretty obvious. As obvious as Cas’s discomfort is now, Dean figures.
Cas kisses him. His mouth is soft and tastes of woodsmoke and he raises his hand to cradle Dean’s face. There’s a brief pause before the second kiss where Dean can see the small smile on Cas’s face, and then they’re kissing again. Dean parts his lips to welcome Cas’s tongue, and the wet slide sends a shiver down his spine and a flicker of heat in his groin.
“I’m the shittiest guy,” Dean says to Cas. “I’m the shittiest fucking friend you could ever have, Cas. We’re gonna figure this out, and then you gotta leave, ok? You think you love me, but it’s just cuz you don’t know anyone else. Someone else will be better for you. Wouldn’t let this happen in the first place.”
Cas shakes his head. “I’ll talk to you later.” He brushes past Dean on the way to the back door, oddly careful not to touch him, and then he’s gone.
you still my Dom, or…?”
- “This is the part where you’re supposed to tell me everything will be ok.”
Cas hums again, different this time, and Dean can feel it as he melts into the sheets. It prickles a little to delay following an order from his Dom, but Dean holds off on
Cas is awake but sluggish by the time Dean finishes his head-to-toe massage, and he gives Dean a goofy-soft smile as Dean lays down next to him. “Good?” Dean asks.
The last four hours of Dean’s shift are blocked off for a new client. That’s either awesome or shitty, no inbetween. After reviewing the client’s profile again, he decides it’s going to be pretty shitty. It’s going to be rough and exhausting and Dean might end up popping ibuprofen like candy the next couple of days, when all he really wants is to make Cas dinner and make him smile.
“Hold up. Are you an omega or not?”
“Thank you.” Cas presses a kiss to each of Dean’s cheeks, then says, “I’d like to go back to the house and try out the bed.”
But sometimes Dean is so sad, even in Heaven, thinking about the people he left behind. Castiel had no idea how much it would hurt to watch his charge ache this way, for his comfort to not be enough. One day, he speaks up and says, “I can send you back.”

Cas is standing by the couch with the remote in his hand. Dean pauses in the threshold between kitchen and living room but Cas glances over before Dean gets to stare at him too long: hair breeze-swept from an afternoon by the pool, grey eye glowing in the light from the tv, mouth pink and plush.
“I’m Cas.” Like a nerd, he holds his hand out for Dean to shake, and smiles tentatively back at Dean.
In the distance, a roar that makes Cas’s heart stop, then beat double time. “What you failed to say,” he continues in a whisper, “is that the dinosaurs are
“Bed,” Cas says.
Cas pulls off Dean’s socks and sharply smacks the bottom of one of his feet. Dean squeaks and jerks and Cas laughs. “See what happens when you’re a brat?”
That’s an excellent point.
“No dice. We’ve got that thing at nine.”
“True love’s kiss,” Cas says, “is the only way to disable the curse.”

It’s late when they make it back to Dean’s, but Cas still agrees to come in for one more beer. Cas is laughing at some old story as they walk into the house, but it cuts off abruptly when Dean goes to his knees right in the entryway. Looking up at Cas, he asks softly, “How can I help?”
This probably isn’t the best moment to practice saying it, but Cas has been working on getting past the prickling fear that someone will jump out and tell him he’s wrong, and this situation can’t get much more awkward anyway.

He fumbles for a pillow and manages to cover the pink satin and lace on his crotch, but that doesn’t do much for the bra thing on top. He tries to cross one of his arms across his chest, but that’s not helping either.

A moment later, he adds a smiley and hopes he doesn’t worry Cas too much.
“Lead me on?” Cas has never been good at people, but he feels even more lost at sea than usual. Like they’re having two separate conversations.

“Holy shit,” Dean says. “Is that what I have to look forward to all weekend?”
I appreciate you taking the time to speak to me. As a final question: as a writer, what would you choose as your mascot/avatar/spirit animal?

Dean rolls his eyes. “Dude, not everything is biology. Sometimes people just like each other.”
Dean nearly chokes. He’s not sure he’ll ever be used to hearing it, especially from someone like
(*sort of)
“I know it’s a dick move to do this without even talking to you but — it just —” Cas is staring at the kitten. “It just happened,” Dean says lamely, gesturing at the cat.
“Really,” Cas says, and then it’s just the sound of their mouths meeting and Cas’s fingers working in and out of him, the sound of his wetness obscene. Dean’s keyed up enough that just that alone tugs him closer to orgasm.
Cas relaxes by the time their food arrives, back to his usual quiet smiles and dry jokes and complete obliviousness to Dean’s attempts at flirting. Which is probably for the best, because Dean is clumsy and stupid around good-looking men, even more so with Cas, who is so gorgeous it hurts. Dean is desperate to know what his scent is like underneath the heavy spray of blockers he covers himself in. Dean is a creep because he thinks he might get to find out when they settle in for bed.
“Yes. Yes, I hope so.”
Dean pulls his headphones off and faces her. “Whatsa matter?” he says, wiggling several of his tentacles at her. “They’re not going to hurt you.”
by all-or-nothing-baby
“Yes,” Cas says on a shaky exhale.
“I hope you’re ok in there,” Dean says, leaning forward in the chair, elbows on his knees. “I, um. We miss having you around.”
Cas tilts his head as he looks down at Dean, thumb idly caressing along his cheekbone. “I’d like you to make us dinner first, and I’ll decide from there.”
Dean stares at him, like waiting for a punchline, and then says, “Yeah, I guess so. I live pretty close if you want…?”
“Dean. You couldn’t have known,” Cas says. “I have feelings for you, and last night was—it was intimate, wasn’t it? I can’t compartmentalize that.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, too busy focusing on the burn of the cane marks starting to collect across his ass to figure out if
Dean turns his phone over on the table, and then again, like a nervous tic. “Like I said, I didn’t mean to lead you on. "I'm uh. Also ace.”
alone again.
“Good.”
Out of all the rolls Cas ordered, Dean only hates one and finds it in himself to admit he more-than-likes some of them. Cas is ridiculously smug about it as they head back to Dean’s place. “You need to pack for the weekend,” Cas says, but again, refuses to say anything else.
“You’re unbearable,” Cas says.
“I know you’re gonna make me drink water and everything,” Dean says, “but not quite yet, ok?”
Dean lowers the knife. His biology is going a bit haywire, not sure if he should respond like a good sub or like a closest friend. He settles with a neutral, “Yeah.”
“Jesus, you’re not going to
“Good morning,” Cas says, even rougher than usual.
- “I know, it hurts. I’m so sorry, but we have to get this out.”
“It’s a Sleeping Beauty curse, Dean,” Cas says.
“You’re into me,” Cas echoes. “Please clarify.”
Dean flips, belly to the soft quilt, legs dangling over the edge of the bed. The air is cool across his still-throbbing skin. Cas
“Dude,” Sam says while Dean and Jimmy stare. “That was a UFO.”
Castiel looks down at the books in his lap and sighs again. “Research for my doctorate. I’m interested in the way literature is translated across the languages and cultural traditions of different species. This particular book was published in multiple human languages, as well as Iikti, Jinny, Tsaran, and Zlovo.” Dean stares at Castiel for a moment and Castiel’s cheeks flush under the scrutiny. “Sounds very boring, I’m sure.”
“Then I guess we’ll stay in
Peering close at the canvas, biting his lip in concentration, Dean remembers that Cas used to be a client. It seems fucking ridiculous that Cas used to pay Dean for what he gives eagerly, and now he’s staying up too late to work on a painting so every intricate detail is as perfect as possible with Dean’s level of skill. Which he’s suddenly wishing he had more of, just for this one stupid painting for a dom that used to be a client.
“Dude, I’ve heard you give a speech a thousand times about how it’s ‘imperative’ to be friends with romo partners and subs,” Dean says. “It’s not like you don’t know how to be friends with your subs.”

“Good. Meal plans sound boring.”
[laughing] That would be impossible. Writers are fickle, but readers moreso. I never know which books will land well, but to be frank, I don’t care. The worst thing an artist can do is create to impress other people.
“You’re — uh, grateful,” Dean says. “That I’m yours.”
“Skip the lime then.”

Cas leans down and bites up Dean’s neck, nips at his jaw, whispers in Dean’s ear,

”Nah. He’s just not like me.”
By the time Dean is stroking his hard cock, spit easing the way, Cas is back with a crop in his hands. Dean’s eyes widen and he’s not sure whether to shield himself or display himself further, so he ends up doing neither, the hand on his cock slowing as he watches Cas approach.

Cas smacks Dean on the arm and they walk back to the sitting room with Dean’s hand on Cas’s lower back. The entire party looks up when they come back into the room. “You and me against the world, baby,” Dean murmurs, and then grins like no one thinks they were just fucking in Michael’s house. He’s shameless, and Cas is really starting to love him for it.

Sometimes Cas sees Dean and forgets how to breathe. That’s certainly the case when he walks into their bedroom and sees Dean kneeling on a pillow next to the bed, hands clasped behind his back.
Dean’s Heaven is all endless stretches of highway, mountains up ahead but never reached, diners with amazing pie and dingy hotel rooms on the side of the road.

Cas’s inhale is sharp enough to be heard over the night bugs. “No,” he says, not very convincingly.
not everyone does.
Cas pauses the video, trying not to look guilty or embarrassed. “I was trying to understand the appeal.”
After a moment, Cas says, “I’ll think about it.”
“What is it you do for Bobby, anyway?”
“So use your fingers,” Cas says with a shrug. “Or let me show you how to use them correctly.”

Cas looks out over the field where the shadows of cactuses can barely be made out. The moon makes both of his eyes look grey instead of just the one. “It’s difficult to find a casual submissive when you’re not interested in sex.”

"I, uh. Made you some hot chocolate. I know you’re a coffee guy but this is a house recipe I’ve been playing with and I just thought you might like it so —” Dean realizes he’s rambling like an idiot and cuts himself off, just holding the mug out to Cas.
Dean sits back on his heels, giving himself a few strokes while admiring the way Cas is so wet and soft that he could probably take a cock with hardly any effort. Not for the first time, Dean wonders if this is what it feels like to be an alpha — powerful in the way his omega presents to him, the way his omega pants and shivers after he’s accepted pleasure. Dean could sit and stare at him all night.
After his second hit, Dean says, “So, what’s been up with you lately?”
body remade.
“Your friendship means everything to me, but I can’t keep lying to you. I’m sorry.”
The Andalite is half dead, bleeding from deep gashes in his sides. Jimmy is the first to rush to his side, immediately drenched in blue blood as he presses his hands to the wounds.
“I was going to make salmon for you this week anyway,” Dean says.
“You were amazing,” Dean says, quietly. “If I wasn’t already in love with you, I would be now.”
Cas starts to get tense again as they head back to the hotel with aching feet and sun-pink cheeks. Dean doesn’t ask, even as Cas’s jaw clenches on the elevator ride up to their hotel room.
Dean says. “You know I’m the Queen’s Champion now.”
“Dude, you have to tell Cas. If you don’t, I’m going to kill you. Seriously.”
Dean goes. He’s naked in record time, tossing his clothes haphazardly towards the hamper, and he straightens the comforter before he lays in bed, stomach-down with his head turned towards the door.
Dean whines, curls his toes, clenches his fists. He shifts his hips, too, grinding his cock against the bed as he starts to float.

you’ve known from the beginning that he’s too good for you. but dad always said not to look gift horses in the mouth, so you stopped waiting for the other shoe to drop. you got complacent, maybe. you drank the last of the orange juice and snapped at him when you were tired and waited too long to take the dog out and slammed a couple doors. there was too much whiskey and you were too bad with your words.
“You need to take better care of yourself,” Cas says. “Should we make a meal plan?”
and all my cheerleaders. <3
“Is there a reason we can’t share?” Dean says, though he knows very well there is one: he’ll lay awake aching to touch all night. His crush on Cas is so big Charlie doesn’t even tease him about it anymore. “Afraid to catch the queer?”
“You ok?” Dean asks, standing to meet him as he passes through the kitchen.
Dean’s alarm sings and he groans, a mix of stress because there’s more work to be done and relief that the day is over and he gets to talk to Cas again.
Jimmy is kind and funny and flamboyant after a couple of beers or a joint, and Cas is serious and literal and accidentally hilarious pretty much all the time, and they wear their identical bodies completely differently and Dean thinks he should probably make a choice and stop flirting so hard with aliens who don’t grok his innuendo and boys who flush so pretty when they do, but he’s never been particularly good at denying himself things he wants so he just… enjoys what he has, and ignores Sam’s disgusted eye rolls every time he references his dick in front of Jimmy or Cas.
Dean feels it the moment before Cas’s magic explodes. He manages to raise his hands before the house — the entire goddamn
“Mmhmm.”
“Yes, I think so,” Cas says, smile turning soft.
“Are you asexual?” The guy blushes as soon as it leaves his mouth. “I’m sorry, that was rude.”
Dean likes kissing, and Cas is a good kisser, so he’s more than content to just make out against the side of the bed for awhile, Cas’s shoulder and neck and cheek warm under Dean’s palm. Cas is the one who slides his hand under Dean’s t-shirt, huge and rough — Dean wants to know all his stories, how an algorithm guy earned his callouses — and leaving shivers in its wake. Dean can smell his own arousal on the air as much as Cas’s and it’s a thrill just like always, someone blooming for him. It’s even better with another omega, though Dean doesn’t generally admit to being anything but a three on both axes of the Kinsey scale.
It’s a beautiful day, so Dean lets the dog outside to lay in the sun while he goes through his Saturday morning cleaning routine. Once he finishes the kitchen, he glances out the back door to see how Indy is doing, and — she’s gone.
quite live up.
nervous, so he’s trying to play it cool. “It’s not a big deal,” Dean’s saying as they walk into the hotel, blissfully cool in comparison to the heat outside. “People ask questions and we answer. All you gotta know is your life.” Pause. “Though maybe don’t name that last company you worked for since you don’t have a lot of nice stuff to say.”
When you're not here, I can't go to sleep.
Cas hums in agreement, but Dean’s already distracted, thinking about all the things Cas does to him when he’s the one spread out underneath. One of the best is when Cas pauses a beating to kiss his neck or his temple or the base of his spine. On impulse, Dean leans down and nuzzles into the soft spot behind Cas’s ear, leaving a barely-kiss there. Cas’s shampoo smells like a windswept day at the beach, hot sun and cool water.
“Let me set the scene for you,” she says instead of

It takes more than one waiter to bring out the plates of sushi rolls, and Dean stares at each of the rolls suspiciously as the plates are set down, but he makes the mistake of glancing up when Cas says
