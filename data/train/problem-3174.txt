When they finish, Dean gathers their plates onto the pizza stone and takes everything to the kitchen sink. He’s stopped protesting Dean’s help with such chores and remains silent. Instead, he walks to the coffee table where a green folder sits, it’s the one he made up for Dean for their first interview. It’s grown thick over the months they’ve known one another. Castiel stares at the passages he’s highlighted on the page, summoning the courage to go through with the evening. He doesn’t know if he wants his suspicious to be true but knows he’s come to a boiling point. He wants something with Dean, something more, but not without knowing the whole truth of what’s in front of them.
Dean jogs up a flight of stairs of the stone building and opens a side door that takes him directly to his brother's office. The door is open and Dean strides in, knowing that if there were any students, Sam would have closed the door. His brother shares the office with three other TAs on a rotating schedule, so there isn't much personality to the room's decor. There's a solid wood desk in the center, a few filing cases behind it, and two guest chairs. The window at the far side of the room looks out over the campus and is adorned with vertical slat blinds whose pull chain taps against the plastic, motivated by the air conditioning. Sam looks up from his laptop and opens the desk drawers, coming away with their lunch.
He rounds the corner to the kitchen and barrels into Dean, who grunts, stammering, eyes drifting above the doorway.  A blush spreads across his cheeks. Castiel kisses him quick and sweet. Dean tastes whipped cream and pumpkin pie, and Cas can't help but tease, "We don't need mistletoe to kiss, Dean. But on the other hand, it is rather festive."
“What are you, exactly?”
“No, she and Dad died in a car accident. Ten years now.”
“Castiel, angel of my heart, did you get me a
After the hunters had retired to their rooms, Dean found himself alone in the bunker’s kitchen, rinsing beer bottles; not quite ready to call it quits. He was full of pent-up energy and he knew that if the housework kept till morning, the bunker would never be clean again. He made two laps of the trafficked areas and came back, arms laden in dishware to his favorite angel, elbow-deep in soap suds, his trench coat slung neatly over a nearby chair. Dean set the dishes next to the basin and grabbed a towel, happy to save his fingers from pruning.
“You think Cas would bring us bacon?”
Dean’s lips tip up into a wolfish grin when they lock eyes over the table, “I think we’ve been on plenty of dates since your project started. Don’t you?”
Maggie Zeddmore storms over to her adopted brother and grabs him by the arm, hauling him back from Castiel and Dean. She’s the only woman in Ghostfacers, and Dean has informed him she’s the only true bard in the group as well.
“And the bardic inspiration…is that some sort of…magic?”
Dean’s response is quick:
“Yes! That sounds a-mazing,” the young woman swoons, and Castiel hands over the sandwich, snickerdoodle balanced on top. Claire rips the cellophane from the cookie and eats it in two large bites, cheeks bulging. Dean snags his own bag from Castiel and has taken a similar-sized bite of his own food, leaving Castiel to witness their chipmunk impressions alone. He recovers quickly though, and opens the vegetarian sandwich for himself, taking a more controlled bite. They eat in silence, save for the sound of the musicians’ smacking lips and contented sighs and Castiel is thankful for the opportunity to feed them both. Once they’ve finished their lunch, Dean gets right down to business.
“Charlie, I don’t think-”
“So get this: Garth invited us to Secret Santa again,” Sam announced, waving the gaudy invitation and setting the rest of the junk mail on the map table.
Dean grinned and followed Castiel back to their bedroom, fully intending to make the most of the few hours they had before his own cold set in.
While they wait for their food, Dean asks, "Have you had any luck tracking down other buskers?"
“Thanks, Sammy,” he says, emotion clouding his vision.
Castiel ran his fingers through Dean’s hair, tugging a little at the ends, “I jinxed you over dinner, didn’t I?”
” He heard Gilda shout from somewhere in their apartment.
“That and Palo Alto seems to be a Bard hub,” Dean laughs at his own implication, but Castiel is at a loss.
The statuesque woman looks momentarily taken by surprise but quickly recovers, a genuine smile turning up the corners of her mouth.
Dean makes his way to the front of the audience and pulls the guitar strap over his shoulder. He sets his fingers to the strings and begins to strum. He watches Castiel’s shoulders relax and all faces trained on him with their warm smiles, encouraging. Cas explains the nature of his part of the project, names each artist who has pledged their time to the exhibit, and thanks Dean for his role in making the entire endeavor a success. They share a warm smile.
He and Castiel share a warm grin.
The bus slows in its approach and Castiel draws a deep breath before gets up, “You’re more than welcome to come back with me if you want to.”
Sam eyed Dean from across the library as a mug of eggnog was handed to him. Sam watched him take a sip – then lost it as Dean sputtered the rum-soaked beverage all over Jody.
Castiel comes back with their drinks and sets them on coasters on the coffee table before walking past his usual spot, taking a seat next to him on the couch. It’s closer than they usually sit: Castiel favors the short side of the L-shaped couch, where he can lay down against the pillows piled in the corner where the two sections meet, while Dean prefers the opposite arm where he can prop his feet on the tufted ottoman Cas keeps there.
“Heya, Cas. How’s your morning?’
Dean rubs his hands together at the sight, gleeful, and snakes past him to grab plates and frosty mugs from the freezer, setting them on the table that separates the kitchen from the living room. The table is sized down for the two of them, but there’s a leaf hiding inside that allows for seating for six. Dean goes back for two beers, uncapping them with the bottle opener on his keys and pouring them into the glasses. He has Dean spoiled on frozen mugs. The first time he pulled them from the freezer, Dean’s eyes lit up like a Christmas tree. Dean places the empty bottles into the recycling bin under the sink, and they walk together to the table, Castiel with the sliced pizza in his hands. Dean pulls the towel from Castiel’s pocket and lays it in the center of the table, so the pizza stone doesn’t scorch the wood, and they each take a seat across from one another.
Castiel feels lighter than he can ever remember on the short walk to the museum. Anael perks up when he gets down to the basement, eager to hear about the interview. He isn’t quite ready to divulge his feelings though and makes a polite excuse of needing to type up Dean’s answers while they’re still fresh in his mind. She gives him his space, threading a needle and making precise stitches along the loose hemline of the quilt.
They part ways at the transit station. Dean sets up his guitar in his usual spot, and Cas kisses him on the cheek before he boards his bus. He misses Cas already, which is ridiculous, but he can’t help the way he feels. The amulet is a warm weight around his neck, and the guitar strings seem to hum under his fingers before he’s played a single chord. He feels himself grinning like an idiot, and when he looks up, he sees the little girl bounding toward him and his heart fills up again.
Dean’s eyes widen and his lips part, leaving him looking stunned. It’s over in a flash, his expression smoothing to something carefully blank, but hopeful as he asks, “What is it you want, Cas?”
“You good for now? Blink once for ‘yes,’” Dean smiled and let his hand rest against Cas’s shoulder, a light comfort. Castiel gave the requisite blink and Dean stole one more kiss before easing himself into the armchair.
Castiel dashes from the bathroom to his messenger bag hanging from the coat rack next to the front door, and pulls a notebook from its depths. He opens to the middle of the book where he keeps his exhibit ideas and finds the blank page for Charlie's. It's mocked him relentlessly for more than two weeks, so it feels fantastic when he finally pens something there for the first time:
to read their take on bards.
,” she breathes out, making her way to the bag and peering inside it. He thinks her face could best be described as Indiana Jones looking at the Holy Grail.
“That’s an excellent idea,” he supposes, dreading the thought of interacting with other people. He’s so much more comfortable keeping to himself. The only time he interacts with the public for any stretch of time is through the museum’s social media sites. Often those people are fellow museum professionals or students with a direct interest in whatever collection piece he’s posted.
is haunted, but also can’t be sure. He shoves the box back onto its shelf and jogs up the stairs to find Dean already halfway through
"Guilty much?"
“I’m adorable,” he replies through his mouthful while Sam grimaces.
“Sam, my brother,” Dean answers the unspoken question. “He doesn’t play anymore. Quit the band to join Stanford...Law.”
“That’s a great idea, Charlie. I’ll give them a call on Monday.”
Castiel takes a deep breath and starts at the beginning.
“Hello, Charlie,” Castiel says once the bag is back in place. Dean looks like he might combust.
When he finishes, and Cas wipes his eyes and the applause finally dies down, Cas turns his microphone back on and turns to Charlie, who stands at one of the tables with Gilda, their heads tilted toward one another in adoration.
The bunker is permeated with the smell of Christmas cookies. Baby’s leather seats smell like sprinkles. The Winchesters have baked and decorated approximately twenty-two dozen cookies. The ingredients keep showing up in the cupboards each time they’re opened for a new batch. Sam and Dean are covered in sweat and smiling with macabre grins. It’s terrifying. Dean prays to Castiel in desperation and the angel appears, the wind from his wings displacing the Nutcracker, and splintering it on the concrete below. The Winchesters jolt, the curse finally broken. Castiel burns the Nutcracker while Dean shoves three cookies in his mouth.
Claire has moved since he last saw her, though she’s still on the same block. She’s set up on a bench showcasing a real estate agent’s smiling face and is seated on the backrest, feet planted on the seat. Her small case is open next to her feet and the leather jacket she’d worn the day before is draped over the back of the bench. She’s wearing a tank top and dark-wash jeans with holes in the knees. She’s playing with her eyes closed, her hair pulled into a side ponytail, and when they get within shouting distance, she opens her eyes and spots them, even though both Castiel and Dean are silent. She stops her strumming as they approach.
On the bus ride over, they discussed the buskers they’ve already met with and the few still left to see. In the two weeks since their interview with Claire, Dean has become invaluable. Castiel tried to bring him on as a consultant; he doesn’t like the idea of Dean working without pay, but when he brought up the idea during one of their lunch meetings, Dean quickly shot it down.
“I’m glad to hear he’s playing again,” he says, quiet and genuine and it’s worth it to see Dean’s entire face radiating happiness.
Castiel doesn’t consider himself ‘influential’ or ‘wealthy’ but he has been happily and silently supporting Dean Winchester for the better part of the last two weeks. The unspoken contract. It’s a puerile thought, he knows, but Castiel wants to believe, just for a little while, that Dean’s music holds some magic, magnetic pull.
“How did you get into music?”
“I need to help Tessa with getting everyone back, but you boys have fun!” Becky gestures to the other woman in scrubs, helping a woman with a walker get the tennis balls stuck to the legs over the threshold and into the air conditioning. The bubbly blonde pecks Chuck on the cheek and bounces toward an elderly man with a cannula running to the oxygen tank on the back of his chair.
Castiel steps out of the bus doors and waits on the platform as the bus carries him away, he lifts his hand to wave and Castiel returns the gesture, the distance growing until the bus turns and Castiel disappears from sight. He fingers the amulet around his neck with renewed fondness until the bus pulls into the stop near Sam’s apartment. He pulls the guitar case strap over his head and feels the weight of the instrument ground him.
“Jesus, Dean. I could have been with a student, jerk.”
Squaring his shoulders, he returns to the archway and watches Dean run the dish wand under the tap until it suds, scrubbing down the first plate and starting to rinse the soap away before he finally finds his voice.
Dean dedicates each day to their memory, thumbing the horned amulet he wears around his neck. The station is markedly quiet when he arrives each morning, few commuters brave the pre-dawn light.  He’s certain that no one around here starts the workday before nine in the morning. His usual audience is the handful of homeless folks who couldn't get a spot in the shelter the night before, so he makes sure his tune-up runs are gentle lullabies and soothing sonnets until the sun makes its way over the horizon. He hums in his father's baritone and watches the people around him relax visibly deeper as his music envelopes them.
“More or less, yeah. You’ve got the basics here,” Dean murmurs, indicating the pages before him.
He flicks on the remote to Castiel’s modest television set and selects a streaming service.  All the “pick up where you left off” shows are documentary series, so he selects a nature show, and figures they can ease into this new turn of their relationship. An episode on big cats plays as Castiel walks back to the kitchen to refill their beers in the spare set of frozen mugs and in most ways, it feels like any other time he’s stayed to decompress after a long day before heading back to Sam’s apartment.
“A bard, Cas. Yeah, you got it in one,” Dean sets the pages down on the table and meets his eyes. Their features are mirrored: open, honest and ready to lay it all out there.
Sam trudged through the door, freshly showered and eager to collapse into bed, maybe sleep for eight to ten years. The banshee they killed in Iowa had put up a helluva fight.
"Nah, just trying to figure out what we might play when you got home."
They each sit, and Dean wipes his hands down his thighs as Castiel flips the corner of the papers up to a dog-eared point, then smooths it down again. Neither have made eye contact. The silence stretches between them. The air conditioner in the living room rattles.
“So, we’ve had such good luck with the exhibit because of my patronage?”
“You look nice,” he grins, taking in the spiffed-up version Dean has presented: a dark green flannel, buttoned and tucked into camel-colored chinos cuffed over his nicer pair of laced brown boots. The shirt makes his eyes pop, and the amulet rests in the center of his chest, on full display. He takes it into the palm of his hand and it warms instantly to his touch. Dean gives a little shudder and stands up to follow Castiel back to the bedroom.
“Like I’d ever say no to your cooking,” Dean teases swallowing his mouthful of pizza.
“I know Chuck! He’s down by Jack Lyle Park. Oh! Cas, you could ask the Allied Arts Guild if they want to help with the exhibit!” Charlie lets out an unrestrained squeal of delight that has Anson clapping and laughing along with her. In the face of her elation, Castiel lets go of his discomfort and decides to embrace the turn of conversation.
"Very cute," Sam grins, handing back the paper and watching Dean fold it neatly into his pocket.
It's perfect.
“That sounds great, Dean. Please lead the way. Lunch is my treat.”
By the end, the brothers are giddy, the rush of the performance warming them. They never play together, haven't since Sam left the family band, and Dean feels a sudden pang of longing. When he looks at Sam, he sees his emotions reflected back to him. Neither are willing to break the spell though, and Dean packs his dirty dishes, Sam reaching to place everything back in his desk drawer. Dean moves out of the guest chair, bends to pick up his guitar and the stool, and turns away from his brother.
On the way to work, Castiel lets his mind wander to the surprises he’s managed to keep under wraps from the two most important people in his life. Dean’s surprise has been the perfect distraction for Charlie, keeping her off his case about the Ghostfacers with the added bonus of having someone speak to the museum board for funding and support. He’s been working with Chuck also, trying to get all the pieces in place before tonight. He had just received an email from the board a few days before, signing off on his proposal.
Anael sets about examining the quilt, making notes in pencil in a leather-bound notebook. Her expensive necklaces jangle as she bends to inspect where the threads have begun pulling along the hem. Castiel is grateful for the background noise. Since Charlie left, he has taken to listening to art history podcasts just to hear another voice. He already misses her clacking keyboard and exclamations of success. Most of the staff works on the first floor in administrative offices. Anael is the only other person who ventures into the basement, and even she has a second office above ground.
“Claire?”
…but…
Dean spends all his free time over the next few months running down leads on local musicians and meeting with Cas for morning cups of coffee, afternoon lunches, and weekend evenings with Charlie and Gilda for game nights and babysitting Anson. He replaces Sam’s couch with a queen-size hide-a-bed and makes himself comfortable, starts pitching in on rent, and Sam stops asking him over for lunch at Stanford. It seems he’s met a woman named Madison, another legal TA, who occupies his office hours these days.
He takes the first step down to the bus station platform and slips, reaching for the sticky handrail to keep himself from careening into the woman in front of him. He’s still feeling flustered from his near-fall when the sound of a guitar cuts through the general din of the station.  It's a genuinely beautiful melody and the cadence reminds him of a field of wildflowers, watching bees flit here and there. Castiel breaks out in a wide grin that wrinkles the corners of his eyes as he makes his way to the source of the strumming. The man, with his short beard, is effortlessly charming, shirt sleeves rolled just below his elbows so the fabric doesn't impede his playing. Castiel has noticed him before and has made an effort to drop his change into the man's case each morning over the past week.
“Is he what brought you to the west coast?”
“Could there ever be something…more?” He can’t look Dean in the eye and settles for staring into the kitchen over Dean’s shoulder.
When Dean was old enough to ask Bobby why their dad hadn’t come to get him and Sammy, the bearded man had adjusted his grimy ballcap and sat the boy down; told him the truth about his old man. He had a vendetta, a word Dean figured meant that his dad would kill the man who killed Dean’s mother. The thought kept Dean up for months, until John finally dragged his ass back to South Dakota for Christmas. Dean gave him a box of ammo for the Colt he’d stolen from a bait shop. It was a terrible, thoughtful gift.
With everything set for Charlie’s exhibit and the woman herself back in action, Castiel goes back to his regular routine. He highlights items in the collection on the museum’s social media sites and tries to throw in an instrument every now and then to keep the public’s interest in the upcoming exhibit. He meets with local researchers and students, showing them textiles and pottery and providing reading resources and support for their own projects.
They finished dinner and Dean took the rest of his beer into the living room after Cas dragged himself from the barstool. Sat heavily on one side of the couch, Cas made room for Dean and turned on the TV, volume at its lowest bearable tenor. “Nurse Piccolo was trapped in the elevator with Nurse Ballesteros if I remember correctly.”
“I gave this to your mother, Mary Winchester. I - I knew your parents before they had you. Back in the early seventies. We used to play together before they were married,” he conveys with quiet wonder. The amulet is warm, buzzing when Chuck replaces it under Dean’s shirt.
Charlie and Gilda’s home is a nerd haven. Any space that isn’t taken up by overstuffed chairs and other furniture, holds bookcases full of collectibles, books, and figurines. The walls are littered with framed movie posters and puzzles and the whole place is equal parts overwhelming and fun. Castiel is certain he’s still hasn’t seen everything, despite coming over weekly since his and Charlie’s best friendship was declared.
Sam groans.
“Merry Christmas, Angel.”
“Everyone’s triple confirmed they’ll be there,” Dean assures with a huff, sprawling across the bed to watch him pick out a shirt. “I like that sweater you’ve got hiding back there, by the way.”
The place is packed. When Dean’s been by to meet Cas for lunch or to head home, there’s usually a handful of people walking through the place, families and older folks. Tonight though, it’s standing room only, and he feels Cas tense beside him immediately. He wraps an arm around the other man’s waist and pulls Cas closer, kissing his hair and humming into his ear. He always feels energized from a crowd, so he passes along a little bit of it to Cas and is pleased to feel him relax after a brief moment.
He eyes the corner of his napkin the waitress left behind and lifts the salt shaker on the table, tapping it a few times before answering, “Dunno, man. Kinda knockin’ around the idea of this time being long-term.”
"Mhm," Sam grunts and finds himself a beer in the kitchen. He returns with a bottle for Dean and says, "Who's the lucky sap that's got you acting all squirrely?"
They sit on the bench for several hours, reminiscing, trading stories, laughing and crying in equal measure. Castiel is silent, save for polite laughter and never stops touching Dean. When the sun begins to set, Becky joins them, slightly subdued once she catches the nature of their conversation. She and Castiel make plans for the exhibit opening; he invites the seniors who can make the trip to opening night, and she exchanges contact information with him.
Five minutes later, the living room was reset and Castiel hadn’t moved a single inch but for his eyes which kept careful watch over Dean’s every movement. Dean left to return the trashcan and came back a few minutes later with cold-damp hands and a mug of steaming tea - also from the fancy grocery store. The mug was sat on the coffee table and the coffee table was carefully moved several inches closer to the couch, so Cas didn’t have to overreach when he wanted a sip. Dean spared a glance at Cas, caught the way his eyes softened at their edges, and leaned over to place a gentle kiss on dark ruffled hair, made heavy with sedentary sickness.
Dean leaves the museum and when Castiel turns back to the elevator bank to return to his office, he sees Anael there with a small smile on her face, shaking her head at him. He has no idea what she means because when he asks what the matter is, she supplies, “Nothing at all,” and joins him in the workroom without another word.
“What did you find in Charlie’s notes, Cas?” Dean asks, indicating the papers he’s now clutching.
Once they’ve both settled, he spots the Bradburys in the eclectic mix of people. The deeper they venture into the museum, the more faces he’s able to pick out: several of his students have made it, along with Chuck, Becky, Tessa, and Joshua. There’s a space cleared near the entrance to the exhibit hall with a few amplifiers and microphones and he drops off his guitar, eager to mingle with his friends and loved ones. Castiel peels off a few minutes later to join Charlie and a few other museum staff to begin the evening. He snags a program from one of the cocktail tables.
Dean pulls his phone from his pocket and opens the latest email from Castiel. The list is a few names and the locations where each musician plays. Charlie grabs the phone from Dean and scrolls through the list, eyes alighting on one of the names.
Then, Sam's eyes light up and he points to him from across his desk, a piece of lettuce falling back into its biodegradable container, “You didn’t sleep at home last night!”  His brother’s eyes are dancing with mirth now, and Dean groans half-heartedly, but can’t keep the smile off his face.
“Charlie, Dean and I have a surprise for you,” he begins, and an excited murmur runs through the crowd. “If you’d please direct your attention to the back of the room? Anael, please get the doors.” Cas is beaming by the time he’s finished, and Dean watches Charlie’s face as the main entrance swings open, admitting the Ghostfacers crew.
Chuck leads them to a stone bench in the garden. There’s a skinny tree trying its best to shade them, and Dean drags the guitar case off his back to sit with Chuck. The older man makes room, so he can balance the case on his lap, flicking open the latches to raise the lid. Castiel stands a short distance from them, and Dean is so grateful he’s here, that they came together on this errand-turned-trip-down-memory-lane. He huffs out a sigh and tips the case toward Chuck showing him Mary’s guitar and the family photos tucked inside.
“Could we sit?”
Just before noon, Castiel spots him, looking both ways before crossing at the light to the museum. Dean can’t see Castiel, and he gets a moment to watch the man as he looks up at the building, draped in banners displaying their current exhibits and mouthing the titles to himself. Anael appears at his side, startling a little at her presence. She has a sly look on her face, red lips tipped up on one side.
There’s a good amount of foot traffic on the street: students heading to and from classes, folks dressed in casual suits and skirts going for drinks after work, parents with their kiddos on their way to the museums and parks nearby. Each group slows as they pass Dean and Claire, an odd couple for sure, but no one passes without a smile or dropping their change in Claire’s case.
Castiel isn't great with social cues if he’s honest with himself, and he isn't entirely sure if Anael expects him to explain the intricacies of the gameplay to her. People tend to baffle him. The few coworkers he interacts with directly know to keep conversations work-related. Charlie is the only person he has ever opened up to and he wonders if he should try to get to know Anael better. She'll be working on the quilt for at least a month and making no attempt at all would surely be noticed.
"I'd say something now, but I'll wait till the morning when you'll regret it more."
“Yes, I believe so. We’re going to see Claire tomorrow over lunch.”
Illness brought a sort of calm serenity to their home that was rarely seen. There was usually background noise running until bedtime: Dean’s classic rock station while he banged around making dinner, or Castiel’s podcast while he pieced together the puzzle laid out across most of the dining room table. In the evenings, it was the nightly news followed by four episodes of
”  He clicks through to the next tab, “
He’s got it.
“Anael, one of my co-workers, sent me a list of local artists this morning. It seems there’s much to be done all of a sudden.” Castiel grabs the bags with their food from Alfie since Dean carries his guitar on his back and the pair make for Claire’s usual spot.
“Dude, you’ve been playing the same song for hours. It sounds great, but let it go.”
Under their “About Us” section, Castiel reads their biography.  They’re self-proclaimed nerds who play Dungeons and Dragons when they aren’t playing shows in the dive bars around the Stanford campus. There’s an embedded link in the text that takes him to a
“Beginning in June, the American Folk Art Museum will be host to several music workshops for various ages and experience levels. Admission will be free to the public. At the end of the summer, there will be a voluntary recital where participants can show off what they’ve learned to family and friends. There are brochures for the program at the doors on your way out.  Please take a handful and help us spread the word. We hope to see you all again soon. Thanks again for joining us and drive safe everyone. Goodnight!”
He all but blurts out the accusation.  It’s not the phrasing he wants to use, not the direction he wants to steer the conversation. Dean finishes rinsing the plate and shuts off the tap, turning slowly to face him, eyes searching his face. He’s flushed, can feel his cheeks burning under Dean’s gaze until his eyes dart down to the pages he holds in his hands.  Dean pulls the towel from beneath the pizza stone and wipes his hands carefully. Dean looks to be stalling. He wonders if Dean somehow knows what's on the page.
The north star used to be a waypoint for Dean, but ever since Chuck went and fucked everything, Dean thinks the star might be mocking him instead.
of you!” She’s already moved on from him, to caress all the leaves of every single plant they have, cooing at them and calling them by name as she did every morning before her leave. She whirls around to the work table and her eyes alight on the goodie bag he’s left for her.
He shifts his weight, so he can get a hand between them, running his palm along the planes of Castiel's side and stomach. He's close to his goal when Castiel grabs for his wrist and drags their hands away. Cas breaks their kiss to breathe out, "Just this, ok?"
“Hello, Dean,” he says, squinting into the afternoon sun and smiles at the musician who has just taken the first of the steps up to the museum.
At eleven o’clock, Castiel’s phone vibrates from inside his messenger bag, and he opens the lock screen, thumbing into his messenger app to read his text:
Becky motions for them to come over to the garden and he holds the white picket gate open for Cas so they can step inside.
On first impression, Chuck seems exactly as Charlie described. He has curly greying hair and a short beard. He’s wearing a white baseball tee trimmed in black under a green canvas jacket, jeans, and grey Chuck Taylor sneakers. He has wide blue eyes and smiles when they approach. Castiel gets to him first and shakes his hand, exchanging pleasantries. When Chuck glances over Cas’s shoulder to Dean, a flash of recognition runs across his features and he closes the distance between them quickly, dropping Castiel’s hand in the process, to envelope Dean in a tight hug. Dean freezes, then pats awkwardly at the smaller man’s back until he lets go, bracing Dean’s shoulders in each hand. There are tears in his eyes, tracking down to his beard, and Dean realizes that his shirt is damp where Chuck buried his face in his shoulder.
“Dean!” he hollered, gripping large fistfuls of tinsel.
He sends the text before he’s even considered what he’s typed:
She gives him a lopsided grin as he jogs back across the street, head down to thumb through her feed. It’s mostly one-minute clips of her playing to small groups of people. The locations are all over California and he wonders how long she’s been traveling on her own. Shaking his head clear, he checks the time on his phone and opens the door to the café. He finds a table in the back, secluded from the main dining area. A waitress takes his order and he makes himself comfortable, trying to keep the butterflies in his stomach at bay.
In addition to his regular group of friends, Dean also has a dozen students in Palo Alto who meet him at Robles Park after school to learn the guitar. Castiel helped him set up the ad on the local community board, and Sam has been nothing but encouraging.  It is by far the most rewarding thing he’s ever done, and it’s helped bring some much-needed stability to his life. He has a feeling his parents would be proud of him.
Dean stacked the last mug on its tray near the coffee pot and turned back to Castiel. He held out the angel’s coat, but Castiel didn’t move to take it. Instead, he passed by Dean and down the hall. Dean heard the snores and whispers of his fellow hunters and felt a smile on his lips for the first time in months. Castiel made the turn into Dean’s room and closed the door behind the hunter, taking his coat and slipping it on the hook behind the door. They undressed in silence, and finally slipped into bed.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Dean. Please feel free to text or call with details. Anywhere you’d like is fine. I work at the Museum of American Folk Art on Centennial. It’s, ah, on the card,” he feels like a bit of an idiot, rambling on, but he’s nervous now that he has a name for the man whose songs have become the most delightful earworms.
Dean rolled his eyes, “I came 90 your supposed to come ten. I can’t go the whole hundred.”
“Hey,” Dean said cautiously. Only now processing that blue eyes was a boy. That made him halt only for a moment. Just cause he was drawn to this guy didn’t mean he was attracted to him. Right?
Cas smiled, “They are.” Dean and Cas looked at each other for a while. Neither of them wanted to look away, analyzing each other's subtle eye movements.
“I’m sorry Dean,” Sam said as his eyes were fluttering shut. Dean didn’t bother to ask what for, they both knew. Sam was safe in his bed, while Dean had to go face their Dad.
They went through most of the school day, but second to last period Dean met Anna in the parking lot. They took the Impala back to Bobby’s and stole a mostly broken car with an age-old license plate. The Impala would be too easy to track.
John scoffed, shaking his head, “Really? You wanna use that move? You can't use her as a shield for the rest of your goddamn life Dean. She’s dead!” His voice strangled up to a shout, before reigning back in. Dean didn’t even wince.
The first day back in school was awkward, but nothing changed. Cas and Dean ate lunch together, and since it was a Monday, Cas nodded goodbye to Dean across the gym while Dean was warming up for wrestling.
“Our father cared about him. We should care about them too. They are our brothers and sisters.” Michael stated calmly.
They only planned on staying like that for a bit, but in the end, they stayed for almost the entirety of practice. When Dean heard people leaving the gym, he roused her and walked her to her car.
Cas felt a strange sense of fear as Sam unraveled his present, sure he would hate it. But Sam grinned brightly at the book, “Well, Dean told me you like that kind of thing. I know Christmas presents are supposed to be more fun but-” Sam interrupted Cas with a tight hug.
Bobby leaned against the counter, “You’re making some friends?”
Dean raised his eyebrows, “You got a problem with him?”
Dean frowned, “I thought your dad was dead?”
As it turned out, Cas had never played Mario Kart, which Dean found devastating. The two of them played for a while, and when Sam finished his homework he joined them.
Jody sighed, “I’m sure Dean wouldn’t have punched him unless he had a reason, whether it was a good reason or not, I’m mainly worried that this kid will go to the school and get you in trouble.”
“Oh no.” Jody took the bag from Sam “Dean!” She held up a copy of something called Busty Asian Beauties. “Wow. You got him a gift that sexualizes women and Asians. Nice.”
“You wanna stay for dinner?” Dean asked.
“Sammy, if you're not in the car in ten seconds I will leave your ass.” Dean leaned on the hood of the Impala. Waving to his Uncle Bobby who was working on a 2004 BMW Roadster. It had nothing on Baby, but it was still a pretty cool car. Some guy going through a midlife crisis asked Bobby to fix it up a few days back. Dean wanted to do it himself, but he was told to focus on getting ready for school.
“I passed all my finals!” Dean said, jumping through the house. Cas was at his home, so essentially unreachable, but Jody Sam and Bobby were all ecstatic for him.
“Hello, Naomi. I am calling to ask if I can stay at the Singer’s for the night.”
“That’s ok, you don’t have to,” Dean responded. So they just sat on the blacktop leaning against Baby in silence.
Anna kissed him on the cheek, whispering thank you. Dean noticed Cas frown slightly at the gesture but said nothing. Anna and Cas then hugged for a long minute, before she got in the car and drove back to Kansas.
“If I don’t give you kids a room, you’re just gonna spend the night on the street aren’t ya?” It was a depressing motel in Salina.
“Now wait for a minute son.” Bobby stood up straight looking serious, “I know you had a tough last few years. I know Mary dying just made things worse,” Dean rolled his eyes for perhaps the hundredth time that day and broke eye contact with Bobby. “Nu-uh you look at me boy.” Dean forced his gaze back with his most intense bitch face, “I don’t care what your Daddy says. You’re a smart kid. You don’t have to go to grad school, hell you don’t even have to go to college. But if you want to go to college, you’re gonna fucking go to college. If you want to be a damn good auto mechanic, hell you’re halfway there already. But I’ll be damned if I let you lead a life without options.” Bobby stopped to take a breath and let Dean process what he said.
“You’re a guest. Guests sit in the front.” Dean said, waving him off. Castiel nodded and watched Sam run across the lot to their car, waving goodbye to a blonde girl who was playing with the other kids.
“Nice to meet ya Deano. Heard a lot about you.”
“Watch how you talk to her,” Gabriel growled.
Dean thought for a moment, recalling the names of the boys Sam was playing wall ball with. “Balth and Uriel?”
“I’m not sure how I feel about this,” Cas mumbles around his popcorn.
Dean nodded. He could understand that, “So why would he help you?”
“Why?” Anna asked. Gabriel just shook his head and threw in another stone.
“How long is this assignment?”
“Yes, that alright.” Dean stuttered.
“Do you want to call your parents and ask if it’s ok for you to stay the night?” Jody asked as Dean and Sam did the dishes. She somewhat planned a situation where she could integrate Cas with minimum interruption from Dean. He could still hear them but what would he do about it?
“No, but in spirit. And that’s what matters.”
Naomi stood up instantly when Michael gave her a pleading look. “Anna, would you help me?” She said softly. Anna was assisting Castiel and Hester with their homework. But they had all stopped to observe the affair. She nodded and gave Cas a kiss on the head before following the elder girl.
Anna nodded in understanding. Castiel wasn’t so sure.
Dean honestly didn’t even know why he was going to school. He was gonna be a mechanic. He was good at it and Bobby would give him a job. But Jody said that if he wanted a job at their shop, he had to at least get a high school diploma.
Castiel smiled and nodded, “You have a lovely home.”
“Hey, Cas!” Jody greeted them. “What’s up?”
Gabriel looked down at his feet, “I have to believe some part of him still cares about all those kids. He wouldn’t have wanted this.”
Her eyes grew wide, “No! Actually, he’s really sweet. Some of his siblings aren’t great though.”
“Alright, kiddos put your pens down that’s time.” Dean didn’t get to the conclusion of his final paragraph. He’d lose points for that and not restarting his thesis, but he did his best. He studied and everything. And a small part of him enjoyed it.
Dean nodded, blushing, taking the key, and dragging Cas upstairs.
Dean huffed, “Yeah thanks for that Cas.”
“Ok. Here’s the plan.” Anna said after school. They were standing in her apartment, she was pacing and Gabriel was slouching, exhausted in a chair. Dean stood, running his hand over his chin patiently.
Sam blushed, “That’s Jess.” Dean smiled knowingly at Cas.
They slept on opposite sides of the bed. Which was painful after getting to be so close last night. But Cas was right. He didn’t need Dean to feel the same way, to love him romantically. They were family, and that would have to be enough.
Castiel didn’t bother to pick out a different book. If they wanted him to read to them, they’d have to read what he was reading.
Gabriel left a few months after that. He had applied to a local college without telling Michael or Raphael. And he left, giving Cas and Anna nothing but sad looks.
“Algebra II,” Cas said.
“Was it difficult to get your brothers to let you come?” Dean asked quietly. Cas’s eyes opened and met Dean’s. Cas nodded slightly. It was barely visible but Dean saw, “I’m sorry.” He whispered.
“Good?” Cas titled his head. “Dean beat him?”
Dean collapsed back into his chair, running his hands through his hair, “You said that Cas had been through this before?”
Dean smiled at his little brother, “You know you’re smarter than you look.”
“I’m sorry Bobby. Really.”
“Goodbye, Dean.” Cas closed the door gently before walking away.
While the family had their eyes closed, Cas looked at Dean. Trailing the pattern of his freckles while thinking about the fact that from this point on, all things would be compared to Dean Winchester and his family.
“Yeah, that sounds good.” She grinned at him, pulling and walking onto the dance floor. She didn’t give him bedroom eyes, or smile shyly over her shoulder. She didn’t even take his hand. She just marched into the center of the room and started dancing, letting Dean do his part to keep up with her.
“I don’t have a phone,” Cas responded.
Chuck nodded, “Well you should learn.”
“Why do you have to be such a bitch?”
He sighed, “Well. And you?” Strange overly formal weirdos. Was this a Lebanon thing?
Dean laughed humorlessly, sagging back to his side of the bed. Cas followed him, “Yeah that’s uh- that’s a good point.” So they continued kissing for a few minutes until finally, Cas let up.
Dean sighed, “Grief. Substance abuse. Depression, paranoia.”
“I’m just- I can’t Bobby.”
“We have a plan for them,” Anna reassured, squeezing Cas’s hand. “It’s ok. Please come with us.” Anna pressed their foreheads together, and Dean suddenly felt like he was intruding on a moment. But Cas nodded after a minute, trusting his big sister like he always had.
Dean was the one to break the contact and he found himself missing it instantly, “Alright get outta here.”
“Present time!!!!” Sam yelled jumping around the tree. Cas could count eighteen of them under the tree. Sam had tried to buy presents but quickly realized he didn’t have money. Cas insisted he shouldn’t worry about it, but Jody and Bobby took him to the store to pick something out for Cas and Dean anyway.
“Why can’t you take custody of them?”
“Actually it’s Milton,” Anna said from behind the man.
Stark white settles over the Montana hunting cabin. The weather had turned several hours before, and now the Winchesters find themselves a little stir-crazy, waiting for the moment they can dig themselves out of the winter wonderland. Dean wonders for the nth time why there isn’t some snow-blowing spell they can use but realizes any spell ingredients are buried in Baby’s trunk. At least he threw a tarp over her before all this started. Small blessings.
, who shares a last name with one of Charlie’s aliases on the show.
They linger for several long, joyous minutes until Castiel pulls away and insists they need to leave. Dean straps his guitar across his back and gathers Castiel into a tight hug before they turn on the outside light and make their way to the transit station.
“It’s just me ‘n my brother, Sammy, now. He’s gonna be a big-shot lawyer when he’s done at Stanford. Quit the band before we lost our parents though.”
“Yeah, lemme pull it up on my phone.”
He takes the Tupperware container from Sam and opens the lid, revealing a thick roast beef sandwich with a side of horseradish and a little cheese wheel. He claps his hands and rubs them together excitedly like some greedy banker in a B-movie. Lifting the sandwich, he takes a too-big bite that puffs his cheeks like a chipmunk. Sam rolls his eyes.
I borrowed heavily from Dungeons and Dragons when crafting the concepts of bards and bardic inspiration, and I found many excellent resources online to explain the mythology for this story. Please check out
Dean laughed, “No. I mean, I wouldn’t be opposed to that, she’s amazing. I just don’t think she’s really big into the whole idea of dating. Especially not as a freshman. And you know what? I don’t think that’s such a bad thing. I’m glad she was my first date, first kiss. But I don’t need to marry her now?”
Gabriel nodded, “Michaels right. They’re our responsibility now.”
She was staring at him, unapologetically, but patiently. It was a clear act; she wanted to kiss him, but he didn’t half. He could just smile and they could go back and nothing had to change.
“Dean set the table. Not you Cas you’re our guest.”
“I don’t-” Dean covered whatever confusing emotion he was having with annoyance, “I don’t want to ruin today for you so just drop it ok?”
“Lucifer?” Chuck asked through a fog.
“Language! It’s Christmas!” A gruff voice yelled in front of the kitchen.
The man traded a look with Anna, before stepping aside to let Dean in.
“Where will you go?” Michael asked as Gabriel made his way to the door. By now several other children were with Castiel and Anna to listen in on the conversation.
“That’s a cool name.”
“Alternatively,” Anna’s eyes narrowed on Dean, “We can let Cas rot in there until if and when we manage to gain custody of him.”
Dean was surprised that Cas willingly continued the conversation, and was happy to explain his thought process, “You talk the same. But you act like you haven’t seen each other in a while.”
Dean came back to school the Monday after homecoming practically glowing. Happiness looked good on him, so Cas barely minded.
Cas raised his eyebrows, “Nothing you could say to me could ruin how absolutely perfect today has been. But I don’t want to go to bed with something hanging over me.”
Dean’s blood ran cold, “What are you talking about?”
Dean buried his face in his arms as he watched their reactions. Quietly, Jody spoke up, “Thank you, Dean.” And in a second Dean was hugging both of them. Sam and Cas both smiled at the three of them and had their moment before Sam joined the group hug.
“Ok.”
“Cause you’re my baby brother. Also, you don’t need to turn your body that much, it doesn’t actually help you.”
Dean processed this for several minutes. Once it sunk in, waves of fear, fury, and despair flooded him. He stood up.
To Cas, the phone symbolized freedom, humanity, inclusion, and individuality. It made him part of the family. All he felt was love.
Cas frowned at this, “Dean?” Dean looked back up at him, seeming almost fearful.
Things got bad.
“Anna?” A small voice came from behind them. Dean and Anna both spun around to find an eight year old boy standing behind them.
Dean ran back up to his room.
“Hello, Castiel. Should I give the phone to Naomi?”
Dean raised his eyebrows as he ripped it apart, “This must've been expensive.” Sam had gifted him an array of seasoning powder. “Taco, Barbeque, Smoked paprika, chili- The list goes on.” Dean was grinning. “Thank you, Sammy.” He pulled his brother into a hug.
“Alright, that’s enough.” Jody held her hand up giving Bobby a look. He shrugged but looked apologetic.
“I figure she’s your car now. John doesn’t seem to want any part of her. He got that car for Mary.” Bobby looked at Baby sadly, before helping Sam into the car with his books.
Cas shook his head, but smiled fondly at his sister, “I found it quite enjoyable. I think we’ll have some excellent teachers this year.”
“Milton. Right.”
Two weeks into school, kids had started pairing up for homecoming. Dean hadn’t even been thinking about it when Lisa asked him. She was in his Bio class. She was the type of girl who wasn’t afraid to ask for what she wanted and stand up for herself, but she was still soft and warm. Dean said yes, happily.
Dean’s B-day class schedule was hell. He hated this school. He missed his old friends and getting to do whatever he wanted. They were so much stricter here.
“Shut up Bobby.”
“Cassie.” Anna pulled her little brother close, “They’re hurting you.”
“That's not my fault!’ Dean yelled back without missing a beat. John looked up at Dean like he had been slapped.
“No, he left.”
“Thank you for loving my brother.” She said once they had parted. If he wasn’t taken so off guard he would have denied his love for Cas. Love was for girls and girly things. But at that moment he was too vulnerable to lie.
“What did you just say?” A voice growled from behind them. Anna’s hand protectively clenched around Cas, but couldn’t stop Michael from pulling him from her.
But he and Cas weren’t dating and that was his decision.
“Do you think for yourself Castiel?” Chuck asked, staring at the ceiling.
“Why the hell are you rotting Sam’s brain with that shitty game?”
Hester said it was because he refused to make any attempt to adjust to social norms. He acted as the child of a drunk, suicidal, philosopher. That didn’t sit well with most of the school. He spoke formally, with large vocab words. And often was too blunt, or made comments that were uncomfortable. Hester was in the same class, but she hardly ever did anything about the extreme bullying he faced. But he didn’t blame her. She had her own life to live.
Cas shook his head, “Nothing.”
On Friday Castiel simply didn’t meet his brothers at the bus stop. Naomi said it was fine as long as he found his own way home. Cas figured Dean could drop him off.
Dean huffed, Murder me. “Yeah maybe.”
“Sam! C’mon, I’m not afraid to leave without you.”
“Yeah. They’re pretty great.”
“No one should be this excited for sixth grade. It’s… unnatural.”
“Twelve through forty even and then you can do 42 or 43 for extra credit.”
Dean groaned, hitting his book with his head a few times. “This is torture.”
“Alright guys we have two more months of wrestling and then that’s it for this year. So let’s make it count ok? We have a competition in a few-”
“But Dumah and Samandriel and-”
And that was how it was when he met Dean Winchester.
“Now you can listen to it the way it was intended to be listened to.” Dean grinned and said thanks. Cas could see emotion being pushed down but didn’t mention it.
The other boy shook his head, “I mean, I’m pretty good at studying and am in a stable place since everyone's just studying for finals and no one assigning homework.”
Cas receded into his pillow, “Dean we need to talk about this,” Dean rested their foreheads together, catching his breath.
“It's swelling,” Cas mumbled. “I don’t have an ice pack. But I’ll drive you back to your house.”
“Ha! You even gave Cas a tie!” Jody laughed
“Ok,” Cas mumbled, his brain shutting down, feeling waves of rejection.
Castiel sighed, “Fine.”
Castiel was just about to fetch the two of them when a voice called out.
Dean looked away. “We can talk about it tomorrow.”
Cas smiled, “You only have to get to the end of this unit Friday, and then we have finals the next week and then it’s winter break.”
Downstairs the house was bustling with life. Bobby was watching TV with Sam, Dean and Jody were making plates of something that smelt absolutely wonderful. Light Christmas music was playing in the background.
The next week he got a Cas a bumblebee plush.
“You wanna dance?” Lisa suggested, putting her cup down on one of the tables, using a sharpie to write her name on it. God, he even liked the way she wrote her name. Block, readable letters. Without any stupid frills or hearts over the I. That was a weird thing to get caught up on because he for some reason found it really attractive. Simply how practical and down to earth she was.
“You know my necklace? I uh... I can’t find it.”
“Is what dad said for real?” Sam asked from his bed.
Sam laughed, “Yeah, the world is pretty fucked up.”
“Alright everyone we’re gonna pray,” Jody said, taking Sam and Bobby’s hands. Bobby was holding Jody’s, smiling at her. Dean was holding Bobby’s and made fake gagging noises at the eye sex his surrogate parents were having at the table. Sam took Cas’s hand without a pause. Dean eyed where their hands were resting next to each other at the table.
“I’ll stay here, you get him,” Anna said, looking around. Dean nodded, carefully walking up the steps. He didn’t bother picking the lock. It was a wooden door. He just kicked it open.
Dean yanked his hand back, “I’m fine.” But Cas was persistent, getting into the driver's seat of the impala, “Hey! No one drives Baby but me!” Cas simply rolled his eyes and started her up.
What-”
“Hello Cassie. I am Castiel.”
When Cas woke up the bed was cold. Dean didn’t keep a clock in his room so he couldn’t tell the time. Cas stumbled to his feet, the full wave of what happened last night hit him like a tidal wave. Knocking him over engulfing him, filling his lungs until he couldn’t breathe, pumping him with adrenaline. Cas sat down, taking a moment.
“Ouch.”
“We have to have a sooner option than that.”
“And when would that be,” Dean asked, getting impatient.
“And you think-” He took a moment to steady himself, “You think they’re doing that to Cas?”
Dean laughed into Cas’s hair, “Not exactly.”
“Just tell him.” Gabriel groaned.
Bobby and Jody both smile at Cas, who nods.
“Would you like to do something this weekend?” Cas asked looking up from his book.
Sam jumped up, “Gimme Gimme!” He said, holding out his hands.
“I can’t think of a sooner time. Michael Raphael and Zach and Naomi all go to those for the younger kids. Makes them seem less neglectful.” Anna explained.
Cas shrugged, “Probably what we do every year. Help out at the farm.”
Dean rolled his eyes, “The blonde girl giving you doe eyes.”
Dean was nearly to his car when he heard footsteps behind him. Anna had jogged outside after him. He turned around and she placed a kiss right against his mouth.
“You should just stay the night,” Sam commented. Dean threw him a look.
Dean wasn’t happy about it but agreed. He stayed with them for dinner, enjoying their strange little family. But he had difficulty taking his mind off Cas.
Dean instantly felt horrible. That must have been weighing on her forever. He probably just made her feel worse.
Dean smiled after a moment, “You wanna play the switch?”
Castiel nodded, “My father was a strange man.”
On the first day of school, Dean sat alone, not even bothering to make a friend. The second day Anna walked up and sat directly across from him.
But he pulled Dean’s head into the crook of his neck and wrapped his arms securely around the other boy. Dean was practically vibrating with warmth, gently kissing Cas’s neck until he fell asleep.
“That should be fine. But you must be home tomorrow.”
Anna’s head sunk into her hands, “I- I didn’t want to leave him. I did everything I could to get him to come with me. But Gabe and I had already made plans and he said no. It was a now or never sort of deal. By the time I got out, they put him on 24 7 watch. He was more of a flight risk than I was. I never got an opportunity to get him out. And he hated me so much that past that point he refused to leave.”
“He’s not living his own life!” Dean suddenly yelled, “He’s living with his brothers!”
When the door closed behind them, Dean dropped his backpack and scratched his head nervously.
Anna was his only friend after that. She looked out for him all through school. She protected him from Raphael and Michael’s bad days. She taught him how to watch his mouth around Michael, and even their other siblings who quickly learned their lessons. Michael had ears in every Shurley except Anna. Castiel didn’t know how to survive without her. Unfortunately, four years later she was about to begin high school and realized just how miserable she was. Gabriel had just graduated and had a small apartment downtown. Without even telling Castiel, she went home on a different bus. There was a custody battle between Gabe and Michael. Gabe won. And Anna didn’t come home.
“Charlie’s gonna flip.”
Chuck gasps beside him at the sight and murmurs, “May I?” Quiet as a church mouse. Dean nods and tries not to let his fear show at someone besides him touching this last connection to his parents. Castiel has stepped closer to them, and places a gentle hand on Dean’s right shoulder, calming his frayed nerves.
“Patron.”
“I did,” Cas affirms into the microphone as Ed and Harry join Dean on stage. “Please welcome to the stage, Ghostfacers.”
Castiel shares all his research with Dean, running ideas and themes by him for their grand exhibit. Dean supports him through everything. It still makes him nervous any time the man mentions the word bard or the phrase bardic inspiration. He’s pretty sure Cas is onto him, maybe even as early as their conversation with Chuck, but always seems reluctant to admit his suspicions. Sam certainly thinks Cas knows everything. His baby brother likes to point out all the boxes Castiel checks in the Patron column. He even calls Cas his O.T.P. (One True Patron), then laughs and dodges Dean’s brotherly punch to the shoulder.
When Bobby called with a salt-n-burn in Snowflake, Arizona, Sam and Dean hadn’t given it much thought, just packed extra rock salt shells for the shotgun and gassed up. Now though, crowbar held aloft, Dean wished he’d asked more questions. He flicked his lighter into the pile of robes and chains, breathing hard and focused on his task. Sam limped into the room crowbar ready, just as the flames started to engulf their vengeful spirit. It may have been comical under different circumstances, killing the literal Ghost of Christmas Future, but right then, they were just happy to be alive.
“You know that never happens.”
He admits to himself, alone in this shrine, surrounded by his creations, that perhaps Becky was right about his ending…
A legacy.
“Music through time, with a section on local community involvement. It’s still in the planning stages, but I’d like to know how you got started as a musician and what goes into your performances.” There. Back on track.
“C’mon doofus, help me get these chords right,” she bickers, picking up her lyre and strumming a soothing melody that has everyone in the parking lot feeling warm and cozy. She winks at Dean and an unspoken agreement passes between them on sharing the burden of bardic inspiration during the day’s events.
“Claire and Chuck are Bards. Chuck’s got Becky keeping him tied down and I think Claire’s gonna stay, too. Unless Kaia moves away.”
He sees a shift in himself.  He’s not so anxious around people. The musicians he met during interviews for Charlie’s exhibit helped him see that finding common ground with folks helps ease his stress.  He still needs plenty of quiet time to get back to himself after interactions with the public, but he no longer panics in the days leading up to a meeting. Dean has been an integral part of the shift, booking lessons in the evenings when he knows Cas has been social and playing him lullabies when he does get home, serenading Castiel as he decompresses with a book or playing a mindless game on his phone.
“Well, you don’t want to keep him waiting,” she drawls and walks to the front desk. He’s puzzled that she doesn’t want to say hello, but he nevertheless strides to the doors and opens them, stepping out into the sunshine and thankful for his rolled sleeves.
"It's no trouble, man. Happy to help," Dean confides, returning to his seat and clasping his hands in front of him on the table. Castiel moves to open the folder and pulls a piece of paper from it, then a thin notebook. Leaning against the table with one arm, he reaches into his back pocket to produce a blue pen, clicking it open.
“Me, too, Cas.”
Then, they go to bed and whisper, “I love you,” and drift into dreamless sleep.
“I’m back! Oh! You kept all our babies alive! Cas, I’m
“Yes, I can see where Dean makes a valid point: the need for that apple pie life, his love of a warm beverage and pecan pie. Even his foil is the love interest’s brother, Gabriel. A case of life imitating art, right dear?”
“I’m very sorry to hear that. Are you close?”
Sam has listened to Dean play the same song for over three hours and he’s a little past his breaking point. He wants to tell his brother to go to his room, but the living room
“Nah, I’m good,” Dean hummed, denying the truth. He reached for Castiel’s discarded mug and finished the tea at the bottom, letting the honeyed dregs soothe his sore throat. Castiel harrumphed, and let his fingers scratch tiny circles along Dean’s scalp until his eyes closed and he drifted through the episode. At some point, he realized he was sleeping more than paying attention to the sexy nurses and nudged Dean awake. "Bedtime, c'mon, my foot's asleep."
"You're mean."
He meets Castiel outside the Arts Guild where he’s just finished meeting with a man named Cain. They walk together to the park from there, and Dean tries not to be jealous of the older man while Castiel gushes over their shared love of honey bees and how the man invited Castiel to his home to see his apiary. It’s hard to be upset though when Castiel beams up at him with his bright blue eyes. He is such a goner.
“If you say so.”
It gives him the strength he needs to find the words to say, “Yeah, Cas. It’d be an honor.”
"What did she draw for you?"
Us. Dean can’t keep the grin from his face if he tried.
“A guy can dream,” Dean sighed, letting himself slide down Castiel’s side to rest his head in his husband’s lap.
“Are you alright, man?” Dean is starting to worry, he can tell and it’s throwing him from the speech he had prepared before texting the musician to stop by.
The pair find Chuck, not at the park, but set up in the little memorial garden behind the Rosen House, surrounded by senior citizens and two nurses in bright pink scrubs. A few folks are dozing in their motorized wheelchairs, but those who are awake smile and clap off-beat to the man playing his acoustic guitar for them. One of the nurses, a petite woman with mousy blonde hair and overly large eyes spots Dean and Castiel and moves away from the group to approach them. Dean feels a little caught out and wants to turn away from the group, but he sees Castiel shifting nervously beside him and stands his ground.
“Fair,” Dean agreed with a smirk. He didn’t let on that his throat had started to feel a little tingly in the last twenty minutes.
He doesn't stop playing as he murmurs a quiet, heartfelt, “Thanks, man,” in a rich voice that has Castiel instantly smitten - the way you fall in love with the next person in line at the grocery store for as long as it takes them to bag their items and be on their way. He parts with a smile and a small wave and loads into the cramped bus, thoughts of Charlie's exhibition forgotten in favor of wildflowers and green eyes.
He swallows the lump in his throat. God, Chuck looks so hopeful.
Today, when he spots her yellow windbreaker on the platform, he's ready, strumming sneaky chords as she snakes her way to him and sliding into a fully-fledged pop song once she gets to the case, each note punctuated by her footsteps. The look on her face is priceless, and Dean glances up and realizes he's gotten a two-for when the girl's mother graces him with a kind smile and a crisp bill on their way to the open-air platform.
The first time Dean meets Castiel at Milton’s Cafe, he finds Joshua there, holding two cups of coffee.  When he turns to find Dean in line behind him, his face breaks into a warm smile and he hands one of the travel cups to Dean. Introductions are made and Joshua and Castiel become fast friends, each man bonding over a love of community outreach. It seems only natural for Dean to invite Chuck to coffee the next week. The older men get along famously, and Chuck and Becky hire Joshua on at the adult care center to tend to the garden there and even set him up in the granny flat behind Becky’s home.
“Thank you.  I hope Charlie likes the surprise.”
Sam isn't expecting anything so personal from Dean and it shows clearly on his face. Dean picks up his guitar and plays a chord. "Whaddaya say to
“Yeah, try and make a stop every few months. Mostly, I travel around though. Been just about everywhere in the U.S. Mom homeschooled us growing up, so I didn’t have the traditional upbringing. But, man, I wouldn’t trade it for nothing. That rush, when you know you’ve hit the right notes, that you’re really getting your message across, touching lives. Nothing beats it,” he’s feeling wistful now, lost in thought, a little high on remembered performances.
Plastic flurries ricochet around the glass sphere, falling, gently suspended in glycerin, onto the tiny replica Roadhouse. The snow finally settles only to be tipped again into tumult as Chuck winds the music box mechanism built into the base of the snow globe. He hums along to the familiar tune, placing it gently next to Becky’s floral-backed laptop and hovers over the keyboard for a few moments, letting the tinkling notes of Kansas envelope the room.
“Sure.”
Just before Dean has to leave for a lesson, Kaia, a cognitive science major at Stanford, joins the small crowd of people gathered around them. He watches Claire feel the girl’s presence, opening her eyes and homing in on her. Kaia beams back, a smile radiant on her face. Dean tries to keep up as the ukulele’s notes change into something dream-like and a little haunting, a testament to Claire’s musicality. Dean lets his guitar fade out on the next eight counts and lets Claire play on for Kaia.
“I thought we had an agreement: you get to keep your stupid holiday tradition of the Elf on the Shelf, as long as there’s more guts and gore,” Dean explains from across the room, where his elves were engaged in combat with Elf Santa.  “Besides, this looks frickin’ awesome!” He adds, stepping back from his scene.
“That’s awesome. I was going to stop by tomorrow to hear her play again, maybe we can meet back up here for lunch.”
The Ghostfacers finally relinquish the stage to Chuck, who brings the atmosphere back down in an easy transition and the crowd disperses to walk the halls and reap the rewards of their hard work. Castiel tucks himself into Dean’s side and watches everyone interact with different instruments they’ve set up for public use. There are photos of each of the local buskers, taken while they perform with placards of information. One wall displays a large map of Palo Alto, pins carefully placed, marking all the places the musicians can be found.
“I’ve only been in Palo Alto a week,” the man trails off, dropping his eyes to the case in front of him. “Dunno if I’m really your guy.”
“Now, tell me about the exhibit.”
He sets a bright teal bag on the work table, adjusting it a bit so as not to disturb the contents inside. He boots up his desktop computer, and jiggles the mouse to wake up the monitors, then picks up the watering can to give all the plants a quick drink.  He’s thinking about how beautiful Dean’s freckles look in the early morning light, and how the bard has moved in with him a few weeks after they made things official.
Dean can't get rid of the butterflies swarming around in his stomach. He's been riding high since the blue-eyed man spoke to him. He spends the rest of the morning wearing out his fingers on variations of the wildflower tune, in an attempt to perfect it, the amulet a warm weight around his neck.  His phone vibrates in his back pocket and he silences the alarm. He packs up his guitar, pocketing the money he's collected and tucking his folding stool into its pouch. He slings the strap over his shoulder and carries the guitar case to the edge of the platform, pleased when he realizes that it's the same one his not-favorite boarded that morning.
“Do you not have a coffee pot, or did I just not see it?” Dean grumbles, walking down the hall in only his boxer briefs.
?!” The last part of her sentence tips up in borderline hysteria and he’s certain a lesser mortal’s eardrums would have ruptured.
Charlie speaks first, welcoming everyone to the show and personally thanking Castiel at great length for his assistance with the special exhibition. Anson breaks away from Gilda mid-speech and launches himself at Charlie's legs. She scoops him up while the crowd laughs and applauds, and she introduces them all to her son. Just as he starts to squirm, she passes the microphone to Castiel to introduce their first act.
Castiel remembers feeling entirely out of his depth once the music started and begged off Charlie’s pleas for him to join her in a celebratory dance. Instead, he had sat and watched the people twirling with one another while the band played late into the evening. There had been five musicians dressed in bright tunics with elaborate hats, two sang while the others played lute, lyre, and harmonica.
"I assure you they're all softballs," Castiel tells him with a grin. "To start, the idea for the exhibit belongs to my good friend, Charlie. She's the curator for the museum and wants to showcase some of the more exotic instruments we have in our collection. Part of our mission is to tie in all exhibits to the community in a significant way, and Charlie left that part of the planning for last. I recently inherited her project, and our interaction yesterday inspired me to delve into the idea of street performers, like yourself, as a sort of modern-day bard."
He warmed the from-scratch chicken noodle soup on the stove, anchored the bowls on two plates and split a sleeve of saltines between them. He grabbed a beer for himself and poured Cas a glass of orange juice and turned with the plates to find his husband propped on a stool at their breakfast bar, the afghan from the couch draped over his shoulders and hair in utter disarray. Dean sat the plate in front of him and placed his own on the counter, so they could face each other to eat. Dean dipped a cracker into his broth, and Cas picked up his bowl to sip its contents. A moment later, he set the bowl back on to the plate and proceeded to crush every single one of his crackers into the bowl, making the soup into more of a slurry.
“Do you have a list? Can I see the list? Please, please?”
Becky opens her mouth for another run-on sentence when the small group of seniors break into polite applause.  Becky takes the card and bounces off to meet Chuck. Dean huffs out a sigh and Castiel turns to him with a bemused look on his face.
“I suspect Sam will, too.”
Castiel beams at him, unable to contain himself, “I’d like that very much.”
is a favorite of his in the early mornings, but he's been working on something special for a man named Joshua who has been waking to his guitar each morning for the past week. Once he's up, the elderly man disappears down the road and always returns with two steaming cups of coffee and a warm smile. They share stories - Dean often speaks of his parents and the places they used to play, and Joshua reminisces about the Cincinnati Botanical Gardens he tended before the city cut funding and he was forced to the streets. Dean tries to craft something for him akin to a flower unfurling its petals, punctuated with staccato bluegrass picking to mimic hedge clippers gently removing deadened leaves, making way for new life.
“Whatever, bitch. Look, I got you your favorite salad,” he breezes in and dumps the bags on Sam’s desk, and despite his careless entry, he makes sure to avoid setting the food anywhere near the papers Sam’s been grading. Sam rolls his eyes but still digs into his meal while Dean gets his things situated so he can eat.
They laze around in bed for nearly a half-hour, touching and kissing one another until Cas’s phone alarm chimes in gentle tones and they each roll out of bed to get ready for the day. They trade off in the bathroom and Cas goes first, leaving a spare toothbrush on the sink for Dean to use. He comes out to the kitchen to a bed-rumpled Dean holding a steaming mug of herbal tea which he accepts with a kiss.
Castiel lifts the messenger bag from around his shoulders and hangs it on the hook inside the workroom door. The large table is covered with the instruments that will go up for installation next month. There’s already an empty space where the first set has been carted away, up to the exhibit hall on the main floor. It’s been blocked off to the public with a banner displaying the upcoming exhibit. The guitars, flutes, and drums will be displayed adjacent to the quilt Anael restored, the exhibition space rather limited given the niche subject of their collection.
“What’s going on, Dean? You haven’t been this obsessive since Lisa Braeden,” Sam puts froth with genuine concern in his voice. Dean scoffs at the reminder.
"Big tipper?" Sam asks with thinly veiled amusement. Dean scoffs, then coughs when he inhales a bite of bread.
They chat for another half hour or so, Castiel taking down copious notes, and Dean regaling him with a few notable performances. He doesn’t mention that meeting Castiel has been the best so far. He does mention the little girl and Joshua, and as they’re wrapping things up, Dean’s face breaks out in a wide smile.
Castiel feels a pang of disappointment, but carries on, “I would still very much like your input. Even if it’s just a jumping-off point. My cell number is on the card.  If you’d still be interested in lunch, let me know.” Castiel wonders if that last bit sounds like a flirtation and is once again mortified.
He remembers being lost in wintery woods, on a wendigo hunt, and using the star to guide him back to Baby’s obstructed parking spot on the highway roadside. The star’s light had brought him a sense of comfort –
“Mornin’,” Dean whispers and he feels a chill racing up and down his spine. Dean rolls onto his back and Cas follows the movement, turning to face Dean fully before kissing him soundly again, without a care for their morning breath.
"I love you."
A collective groan rings out across the bar as the opening notes of
was a bitch to get out of flannel!”
On the way to campus, Dean listens to the music blasting in tinny notes from the headphones of the lanky man seated in front of him. It's some old R&B song, and Dean tries to make out the lyrics but settles for tapping the beat on his knees until the man gets off five stops later and his seat is filled by a woman and her stroller. Dean spends the rest of the trip making goofy faces at the baby and enamoring the little old lady seated to his right.
On a break, he texts Sam, insisting they have lunch. It feels like forever since they shared a meal, and he’s keyed-up with the need to share all their good news.  Sam texts back that he’s free and Dean counts the seconds until noon by the beat of his songs.
Dean wants to ask if there was something between this man and his mother but doesn’t know if he really wants the answer. It seems Chuck can read his mind though, for he offers, unprompted, “There was nothing but deep friendship between us. I introduced her to your father, you know? Our friend Missouri Moseley married them back behind Bobby’s old salvage yard. Doesn’t sound romantic, but Karen decorated the place beautifully. Had the ceremony on the wraparound porch. Karen had it draped with fabric and flowers. Killed John’s allergies. I remember he sneezed right before the ‘I do’s’. It was perfect.”
“Hey, I exist,” Dean exclaims, laughing.
He’s reading an article on Parisian troubadours and recalls the handful of times he’s attended Moondoor events at Charlie’s behest. He had spent most of the day in the queen’s royal tent set-up near the tree line of the local community park. She had led a fierce battle with thirty soldiers against the villainous Shadow King and arose victorious once more. The occasion had been marked by a great feast where turkey legs and veggie burgers were grilled over parks and recreation-approved fire pits.
Charlie pursed her lips at him knowing he was lying. They had known each other for two years now and she had this way of just reading him. " What do you say we have dinner at the Roadhouse tonight? We can get our drink on, I can blab to you about the new video game I am playing and you can blab to me about the book you are reading."
Angel-of-Thursday: mmm Think of my mouth on you.
"You would be correct. I like punctuality."
Angel-of-Thursday: I see... for how long?
Angel-of-Thursday: Hello Pup... Its been a while.
" You never know... I am sure he would just LOVE being pushed down-"
" And you already know Castiel by nick name. hmm, you move faster than The Enterprise at Hyper-speed."
" What has you all sunshine and rainbows?" she asked
Cas smiled. " Good choice."
" Ooh Man, you and my Brother Sam would hit it off so well! He is a super nerd for that fantasy stuff."
" It is." The stranger replied with a hint of pride.
Pup99: I want to eat him out master... I want to nuzzle his balls and swallow that cock down until I choke on it.
" Castiel." He rolled the name on his tongue as if tasting it then rose a brow. " Interesting. Well Cas, You will be seeing more of me. Name's Dean by the way..."
Dean took the book out of Sam’s hands eyeing it skeptically. He looked like he was going to make some comment on Sam and Cas being nerds, but instead, he looked Cas dead in the eye and said, “This was really thoughtful Cas.” And handed the book back to Sam. Cas blushed but said nothing.
“CASTIEL!” The two screamed, running through the crops. They could hear a tractor a few leagues ahead and reached it just as they were running out of breath.
“Hey, Sammy. You’re gonna have to take a bus home today. I gotta thing. Love ya Bitch.”
“Can I go to Jody?” He asked after a while.
Raphael cleared his throat, “Do not be a fool brother. He’s probably long gone. More likely dead.”
Castiel had no right to feel jealous. He barely spoke to Dean, and Lisa was a wonderful girl. He wouldn’t be going to homecoming anyway. But it caused a strange pit in his stomach when he thought about it. He was fairly aware of his attraction to men, but that was no excuse to be so hung up over one person who was basically a stranger.
“It’s complicated. I didn’t- I didn’t want… Can you come back to my place after school?”
“He’s working. He’s harvesting the soybeans.”
“There isn’t anything wrong with it. As long as you gave consent.”
“Alright. Double or single?”
“I can’t. I can’t abandon my family.” Anna frowned, frustrated, “But it doesn't make sense. All I want is to go to college. If I went to college I could make more money for the family. But they won’t let me.”
“Yeah, Benny’s nice. That’s why he deals with freshmen. But like 95% of the jocks are still assholes.”
Cas nodded, “Alright.”
Dean nodded. “Do you want some company?”
“Family cares about you, not what you can do for them the family's there; for the good, bad, all of it. They got your back, even when it hurts. This,” Dean gestured across the field and towards the house. “This isn’t family, Cas.”
Lisa shrugged, “I think their dad was a weird guy. He fudged something to get them all. Different people have different theories… I think he was just cripplingly lonely.” Lisa cut off, staring off into space for a minute. She then shook herself back to reality and looked up at Dean, “Hey, can we not talk about this anymore? I don’t have all the facts and this kinda feels like gossip. You should ask Castiel about this stuff.”
“There’s nothing we can do now.” Anna reminded him gently. “We need to plan first.”
“You ok?” Dean asked uncertain, noticing the look on Cas’s face.
“I’ll pick you up after. Make some friends ok?” Sam nodded, smiling. Dean and Sam had two very opposing views on School. The Lawrence Middle school was overrun with kids who couldn’t care less. But Lebanon was somehow even smaller, which meant more individual attention. More uptight teachers and dutiful students. It wasn’t Dean’s vibe. But Sam seemed excited to get all the attention.
“Castiel! Hey, man! Wait up.”
The door snicked open, near-silent, as Dean let himself into the apartment. The low groan coming from the living room made him cringe as he let the door close on silent hinges. Toeing off his work boots, he placed his wallet and keys on the entryway table. Steeling himself, he let his shoulders sag in sympathetic remorse and turned left into the living room, to greet his couch-ridden husband with a warm smile.
“He’s a boy in my class,” Uriel explained bouncing the rubber ball more. “He and his brother moved here from Lawrence this year.” Castiel nodded watching the car disappear.
“Yes.”
But the summer had to end. He half expected John to show up and drag them back to their old high school. But no, August came and Bobby enrolled them in the local public schools.
“I think father may have been evil,” Castiel said one day. Anna and Gabriel had been skipping stones with him at the creek.
Balthazar laughed, “You haven’t got your period yet?”
“No one told?” Cas was mildly suprised. That sort of gossip usually reached newcomers quickly. “My father left us.”
“Speak for yourself. He abandoned us with these jerks.” Cas and Anna both threw her a look. “Not you.” Anael clarified, “Michael and Raphael.”
“So that means that angle m is 40!”
Sam looked up excitedly, “Yeah.”
Hey Sammy. I’m not gonna be gone too long I hope. But Cas wasn’t doing so good and I had to help him. I know it’s hard to understand and I can’t really explain it all. It’s really complicated and I barely understand it myself. But stay away from the Shurley’s ok? They’re not good people. I promise I’ll be home soon and I’ll stay safe. But I gotta do this for Cas. You were right, we do anything for family.
“Samandriel! We can-”
“Long,” Hester responded with a sigh.
“Castiel?”
“No, he’s not.” Sam interrupted. Jody and Dean both gave Sam a strange look. Sam simply shrugged, “This is his home too.” Jody and Dean both smiled, and Cas bowed his head, but a faint blush could be seen on his cheeks.
Dean turned to look at Cas, “So what’re you doing for break?”
Cas met Dean’s eyes for a moment before they were ripped away from him. He and Dean could talk later, right now it was his first Christmas morning.
Castiel tried to swallow the knot that had formed in his stomach.
“I can skip.” He said. She nodded gratefully, following him outside.
“I agree.” Michael emerged from his room, sitting down at the head of the table. Everyone fell silent, even the youngest kids who were having their own conversation at their end of the table. “Ishim, we haven’t prayed yet.” Even though he wasn’t the one who did the wrong thing, Cas still felt his face heat up.
Cas shared a bed with his brother, so he didn’t understand why he felt so strange sharing with Dean. Not bad, strange, just strange. But Dean fell asleep quickly and Cas was left to ponder this in silence.
Gabriel laughed, “I sure as hell don’t have the means to support twenty wayward orphans.”
“I could never,” Anna said.
C’mon Winchester, not the time.
Cassie stopped, looking at Dean with uncertainty. “No.”
Cas wrapped an arm around Dean’s shoulder, “I’m not sure you understand how much this means to me.” Cas then looked up at the rest of them, “You guys are my family and I love you. All of you.”
Dean’s eyes shot up, seeing Cas’s reaction, “No! No- Buddy wait don’t do that.” Dean was out of his chair and next to Cas, wrapping the shorter boy into a hug. “I swear it’s not anything wrong with you. I’m just- I’m not gay…”
Dean laughed, “I can’t but Cas can teach!”
“Yes,” Dean said before Anna could come up with something.
The apartment was about the same size as Megs but cleaner, and brighter. They had drawn curtains and painted walls.
The elder boy grinned at Sam, ruffling his hair and getting into the driver's seat of an extremely old but well-maintained car. Sam hopped into the passenger's side and the two drove off.
“Unless you want to storm in there and try to pry Cas from Michael’s grip, it’s the best option.”
“I can tell him, Anna.” Gabriel interrupted. She nodded, relieved, “He needs to keep the family together. No matter how long Dad stays gone, he stays loyal to every little thing dad ever said, digesting them and exaggerating them and using them as his weapons. And the most important thing… was that we were a family. And that the world was an evil place and that keeping everyone in our little closed-off space was the only way to keep them safe.”
“I wouldn’t recommend my house. I don’t think I’m allowed to bring friends home.”
“Well, they aren’t treating this woman very respectfully. I mean, I haven’t seen many movies, but I was raised believing that things like sexual orientation, gender, and race were not relevant in the eyes of God. My older sister would be furious if she saw this kind of representation of women. She seems to only exist to provide motivation for the male hero.”
This is what religion should be.
“I’m sorry,” Ishim said, looking down at his plate.
The next day Chuck was gone. He had left in the night. He didn’t come back the next day or the day after that. The fourth night he was gone, Cas was woken to the sound of breaking glass.
Dean sighed, “Ok then. That’s not happening.”
They didn’t even bother to ask why he was helping them, Anna just grabbed Dean’s hand and ran to the SoyBean Field.
They were matching mugs that said, Best Bonus Mom/Dad Ever.
“Ah.” Chuck leaned his head back onto his pillow.
“Hello, Anna.” He said, meeting her eyes. The two had a short and extremely strange staring contest.
“Sounds like love to me,” Cas responded with a far-off look. Dean thought that that was a messed-up idea of love, but he understood. Bees were cute.
“Hey Sammy,” Dean muttered through a haze.
“Yeah he’s not really a talkative guy,” Lisa muttered.
The bell rang. And Cas stood up, packing his food away. He was about to walk to his next class when Dean asked him to wait.
Lisa nodded, “Yeah. I don’t know exactly how many. I wanna say at least ten. They’re not related though. They’re foster siblings.”
They went slow, more nuzzling each other than actually kissing. But after a while, Dean licked his way into Castiel's mouth, eliciting a soft sigh. He ran his hand from where it was on Cas’s waist to under his shirt rubbing soothing circles into Cas’s skin with his thumb.
“They don’t leave the farm often. It’d be best to plan for a time when as many are away as possible.”
“Parent-teacher conferences are in a few weeks,” Gabriel mumbled.
“When we’re old enough we’ll leave too,” Cas said. He said it too loudly. At the wrong moment. Michael had found where the group had been hiding.
“Look Cas, that guy doesn’t- he was just messing around. I mean we used to share a bed all the time this doesn’t mean we have to, you know- Cas?” Cas was standing at the door, tears falling from his eyes. Dean had never seen Cas cry before, so it was shocking at first, but then he sprung into action.
“You’re wrong Raphael.” Castiel and Anna were both surprised to hear Gabriel defending their father. “He brought us together. All of us.”
“They’ve done it to him before. And they’ve done it to me.” Anna admitted.
After he was gone Cas turned to Dean, “Why would we have a pillow fight in our underwear?” Dean raised his eyebrows at Cas, trying not to let the image of Cas in his boxers seep into his mind.
“No internalized homophobia or quoting memes at the table,” Bobby grumbled. Sam smirked as Dean shot daggers at him. Dean then placed his hand in Cas, and Cas tried not to take notice of how perfectly they fit together.
Jody gave Cas an iPhone case, charger, and earbuds. That confused Cas, since he didn’t have a phone. But he accepted them graciously without saying anything. And then he opened Dean’s gift.
Cas shook his head with a shrug, “The animated ones are good, but this is the classic. But never watch the live-action. It gave me nightmares for years.” Sam gave a shudder for effect. Cas appreciated how quickly Sam moved on from his shut-in childhood and didn’t make him feel like even more of an outsider by obsessing over it, as many other children have.
“Who was that?” Cas asked his younger brothers.
An arm wrapped around Dean’s neck, Cas’s hand running through his hair, pulling Dean closer. Dean put an arm by Cas’s waist to steady himself, Nearly completely resting his chest on Cas’s.
“No matter what.”
Castiel shared a room with his four older brothers, Gadreel, Joshua, Zachariah, and Ishim. He shared a bathroom with them, and five of his younger siblings, Hael, Samandriel, Duma, Uriel, and Balthazar. And across the hall his sisters, Naomi, Hester, Anael, and Hannah slept. Downstairs his caregivers Michael and Raphael resided. In a house filled with so many children, he was shockingly used to being alone. Castiel was prepared for high school to be more of the same.
Bobby nodded in approval, “You should bring a few over some time.” The idea of another person spending time with them, connecting with their family the way Cas had, sleeping in Deans bed. It put a bad taste in his mouth. It almost made him sick.
He was almost asleep when he heard the door creak open.
Dean made quick work of tucking Sam back into his bed before shutting the lights off again and closing the door softly.
“Let go. Of me.”
“How was your first day of high school?” Naomi asked as she passed around the bowl of peas and macaroni.
Dean nodded, “Yes Sir.”
Cas looked at the ceiling thoughtfully, as if considering God, “No. We acknowledge it, but we don’t buy any excess food or gifts. We’re not exactly Christian, we’re like a strange solemn mixture of Judaism Christianity, and Islam. My brothers don’t believe in using a religious day as an excuse to celebrate.”
“Thank you, Cas.”
“Mom bought us that game.” Dean bit his cheek as soon as the mention of mom slipped out. He should’ve known better.
Dean looked startled, but nodded, “What sorta thing were you thinking?” Dean asked.
Dean hung up the voice message and got out of the car, eyeing the small house up and down. It wasn’t so far away from Meg’s place. But to be fair, there wasn’t much in the way of a city in Lebanon. Maybe 200 something people in town, another hundred in the suburbs and fifty spread out in the country.
Jody nodded looking like she wanted to ask him a question, but refrained, “Alright you guys can go do whatever you guys do.
“She’s trying to develop an eating disorder before she gets her first period.” Hannah filled in.
Dean looked up at his little brother. He thought for a moment, looking around at his stuff. He was trying to assess his feelings about the situation. If Mom was dead did he care about leaving this house? About leaving John? As long as he had Sammy, what else did he really need?
“Now you can make me even better burgers,” Sam said sitting down again. Dean laughed and nodded.
Cas glanced at Dean with uncertainty. Dean cleared his throat, averting his eyes, “Yeah you can- you can stay as long as you like.”
Cassie smirked, “You should be our health ed teacher.” Dean laughed softly and let her continue. “Anyway afterward he told a bunch of people and I became the sophomore skank.” Dean cringed. He didn’t know about any of this. “Yeah, you’re too busy being besties with Shurley number 40 to really gossip here.” She explained his confusion.
“You have no faith.”
“I’ve heard of this one,” Cas said, sitting criss-cross applesauce next to Sam.
This was ridiculous, Cas knew that. He barely knew Dean. Apart from that, he had a little brother he was amazing with, and that he willingly sat with Castiel at lunch every day despite Castiel being perhaps the least popular person in the grade. And the fact that he made out with Lisa Braedon and isn’t using that to increase his status. Maybe he should give Dean more attention. Even if the other boy wasn’t capable of feeling for Cas what Cas felt for him, at least they would be close, and Cas would be able to properly sort out his feelings.
“Hey. Um.” Dean looked towards the ground feeling his face heat up. “Thanks for letting me talk to you. New schools are tough y’know?”
“Uh hi? I’m looking for Anna Shurley?”
“Hopefully you’ll be able to focus on school better and then you can spend more time researching stuff yourself. And you can join some clubs. Even make your own. There are benefits to being in a small school, even if the teachers are weird.” Jody reasoned.
