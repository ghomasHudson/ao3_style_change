and wait what would happen. He knew he probably stared at John, but he couldn’t stop drinking in his sight. He marvelled at the sheer incredibility of John’s presence. Here. With him. Studying John’s features asked all of his attention, there was no space to deduce, to presume, to plan, to know what came next. Never before had Sherlock been comfortable with not knowing.
“Nope,” John croaked, not able to master his voice. “Just wondering if you’re really sure you want to… wax it?”
That elicited a warm smile on Sherlock’s face and John saw something like relief soften the look in Sherlock’s vampire eyes.
“Well, you know, both nights he’s slept on the sofa and he didn’t even change his clothes. Stupid boy. Why didn’t he even take a shower? He has everything he needs right here.” Mrs Hudson chattered on while retreating to the kitchen and starting to clean the table of Sherlock’s dishes. She huffed a little laugh, shaking her head.
“Uhm… yeah… hi.” Sherlock’s voice was a bit off, too. Had he been drinking, as well? And… ‘hi’? Did he just say ‘hi’?
In the darkness he could still make out his gorgeous Pirate, a gown thrown over the costume, still wearing makeup, no heels any more. But nonetheless they were hovering high above John in this standing position.
“You want to become Miss Pirate?” Sherlock asked, raising his eyebrows, mischief twinkling in his eyes.
Briefly he wondered what had happened to the dizziness from earlier, where the sudden clearness had come from.
That's exactly the point!" he got angry. Why was John playing games with him? "You've seen me. You've been there. I know that. You know that I know that. So, why this ruse, John?" he nearly yelled, just yet contained.
damn hot, you have to give me that! You can’t judge me…” John said defensively, winking at Sherlock.
After nearly a whole day of consideration he felt really awful. He hadn't heard anything from Sherlock yet. Even if he couldn't expect anything he had still sort of hoped. Maybe he should just regard this as a clean cut. Only it didn't feel like it. He shouldn't have left without talking to Sherlock first, John mused. Maybe it was all just a huge misunderstanding? But in that case wouldn't Sherlock have contacted him? Had John overreacted? Had he ruined it?
“That’s why we’re here…” John hummed, pulling back from Sherlock to take his hand and tug him away from the door into the bathroom.
much longer than anyone ever dared to expect. Don't even know how you got through it without strangling him on a regular basis…”
that’s fantastic. But for this, why are you so scared to make use of…” He paused; thought. “Wait, that makes me think…”
They hadn’t talked about the night after their first visit to a club, even though a simmering tension kept lingering during their nights out. In a wordless agreement, their shared bath and John cleaning off Miss Pirate’s make-up became their daily—or rather nightly—ritual; as if it would wash away all the insecurity and confusion the case entailed and draw a line in between club-them and home-them.
“Do it, John.” Sherlock said and John was certain that the roughness in his voice hadn’t been intentional.
@captain_dr_smarterthanhelooks You two are so sweet! This is like a community dream coming alive! I’m SOOO happy to be of service, even if only by accident LOL!!! I wish you guys all the best and I reeeaaallly hope things work out between the two of you! You must have that tumblr-date now, it’s unavoidable (see what I did there? LOL). I hope it will result in a “fun night” together!!! OMG, I can’t wait for an update, my friend. Only if you like of course! You know the rules: only share what you’re comfortable with (BUT TELL US EVERYTHING!!!! LOLOLOL)
He saw that Molly kept eyeing Greg who waited in the background. She blushed a bit and brushed a non-existing loose hair strand behind her ear.
John must think he had gone insane. Or… or… that he was… using. Or any other kind of mind meddling anything. John needed to know!
Well, that wasn’t exactly what John had expected, let alone hoped for. It was neither of the two options he had considered. He was left on the no-mans-land anywhere in between. That was also the reason why his tension hadn’t faded in the slightest yet. Everything was still open, nothing certain, John still left in the dark. He felt a shimmer of annoyance, even anger, rising at the horizon of his emotions. Why would Sherlock leave them in the same place they had been in before? Why leave them in the same vagueness of everything and nothing? What had all of this been for then?
John turned to look at whose presence had delighted her so much, but startled when he heard the same dark voice practically purr next to him.
Sherlock walked over to where John was still hovering. His legs already decorated up until right above his knee with the laces of his insanely high heels, which made him sway his hips with every step he took. John got a bit lightheaded just watching him walk. That was very promising for when he would see him on stage again. Probably he’d just go up in flames, problem solved. Jeez…
way. A devoted housewife joining a book club doesn’t go exactly well with the boisterous life of a drug lord.” Sherlock’s voice was mocking.
Baffled, John ripped his phone from his ear and stared at it. What...? Where had that come from? Had he been recognised by that guy? No, impossible, at no point had John mentioned his name. Completely anonymous. Who was this man with that baritone voice? No one John knew came to mind. He’d
When after a short moment in companionable silence the man on the line picked up the conversation again, there was nothing left of the cold and apprehensive voice John had been greeted with in the beginning.
Drawing one more breath he started to gather his few things, rummage the shelves and cupboards. Searching through the books and magazines. Everything he found he threw carelessly on the living room floor.
Shit, this wasn’t helping. And sure as hell it wasn’t helping that she still held his gaze, fluttering her lashes from time to time, seductively lowered her head, lips a little pouted and wearing a wicked little smirk.
,” The last few minutes left behind, the burdens not gone but at least laid to rest, John felt now free as never before to look at Sherlock—really look at him without anything holding him back—and let the truly miraculous wonder of the moment sink in. How was he so lucky that his more than bumpy path had let him
John hissed. He wasn’t confident enough to reveal what was hidden under his shirt yet. But what could he do? Stand up, run away, lie down in a corner and cry? Ridiculous!
Wavering between anger and guilt and disappointment and melancholy John punched the mattress with his fist, the one holding the phone even though the phone wasn’t the one he’d like to punch. But who was it he wanted to punch? Sherlock? Himself? Fate? Life in general? He heard the unspoken ‘punch me in the face’ quite often, but sometimes he would really like it not to be subtext.
John cursed. Fucking hell, she couldn’t be serious. This couldn’t be real. He pushed himself through the whooping and cheering mass of visitors of the club, bumping against them in the dark, not caring for the enraged muttering he caused on his way. This absolutely stupid silly insane foolish moron of a Pirate. What was she thinking. Jesus Fucking Christ on a Cracker. Dammit!
,” he slid his hands around Sherlock’s slim but muscular waist. On their way he let his fingers dip under the waistband of Sherlock's bespoke black trousers, pulling the man closer to press his mouth against Sherlock’s chest; not quite a kiss, more of a connection, a junction to exchange warmth, closeness of body and soul, love. Closing his eyes, he took in a shuddering breath, deeply inhaling every single molecule of Sherlock’s scent he could gather. There were goosebumps forming on Sherlock’s skin under John’s hands and a faint tremble ran through the man’s body. John opened his eyes and looked up at him.
With pointed fingers John pulled item after item out of the box, eyed them, appraising them. Sherlock let him, an expression mixed of anxiety and stubbornness in his face.
“I have no idea, John. It’s not as if I have a plan or made a spread sheet or something.” Sherlock said and John had to hold back a cough, almost choking. He blushed and was grateful that he could hide his face pretending to see to the coffee.
At least not the one he’d want to. Not now that Sherlock was gone. John had had his chance. And he had wasted it. Anyway, would Sherlock have wanted it at all? John seriously doubted it. Greg was of the opinion that that song was a love declaration. But how could he be sure about that? Sherlock had never said a word. And not a single time the word love was mentioned. What if Greg was wrong? What if he interpreted Sherlock’s song choice out of the same appropriate-friendship-feeling-confusion? Maybe John massively exaggerated it all and just heard what he wanted to hear… hoped to hear... Plus, there was the minor fact that Sherlock wanted John out of his life. And the more than clear message, that he thought John wouldn’t be good for him. That Sherlock was looking for something else. Even worse, some-
Apparently it was quite easy. Support them in their interests, answer their questions, try to help them recover their identity. Give them support if they ask for it and let them be independent in times they want to be.
It was more than convenient and admittedly not unintended that, while chit-chatting here and there, John got the chance to discreetly check out the view on the stage from all different angles. He was more relieved than he would ever admit that most places didn’t allow free sight under the belt so to speak. Now he could only hope that Miss Pirate’s performance wouldn’t be too enthusiastic tonight. But then… actually… enthusiastic pole dancing wouldn’t be the most awful thing there was. However, considering the circumstances… John growled. God, this was all so fucked up.
initiate anything, even given the more than obvious opportunity, to make John finally step back and let him go. God, that man had already been thrown by a simple handshake. How could Sherlock presume that John would ever be willing to pursue anything more… physical? Ridiculous!
John was being silly. Sherlock wasn't the one losing his abilities to deduce. It really wasn't a nice move of John to mock him. Sherlock was a bit annoyed. He only wanted to help here. Apparently, John didn't take this seriously enough.
last have contact with him?” he said coolly and emphasised the ’you’ in his well trained frosty voice.
Sherlock just hoped John had understood his letter. How could Sherlock balance to say 'No' when all he wanted was 'Yes'? How could he avoid hurting John when he had to reject him? He had had his chance to make a clean cut. They mostly heal better than wounds torn open over and over again. John was a doctor. He should know that.
the hair. Bum means crease means perineum… holy shit! Well, better get done with it then. Taking hold of Sherlock’s slim hips he stopped him in his turn.
He knew exactly what this link contained. It was the entry called 'The Empty Hearse'. He didn’t need to open it. He had read it countless times after he had to watch his John walk away side by side with a petite blond woman. Someone who had taken his place, Sherlock’s place. After he had almost lost John in a bonfire, after he had tried to win John back, stopped the bomb, made John laugh, made him say that he forgave Sherlock. After John had gone back to a life outside of Baker Street anyway. After realising that Sherlock had been powerless to change a single thing about the situation. Even though he knew this article by heart and wasn't keen on revisiting this place of the past, his fingers betrayed him and clicked on the link nonetheless. He found himself staring. His eyes immediately locked on the one thing he had never understood, he wasn't able to place. He still couldn’t fit it into the picture… #sherlocklives means #johnwatsonlives.
With a little sigh, which John hoped wouldn’t be heard by Sherlock, he finally made his way to the bathroom, closing the door behind him and leaning against it.
John all but tumbled off the bed and scuttled over to the bathroom. Quickly he snatched everything he needed and rushed back to their bedroom to find Sherlock in the same position, legs splayed wide, displaying himself, but his eyes closed and taking steadying breaths. John could relate all too much.
“Oh, Sherlock, no…” John felt a ball of tightly knotted sympathy replace the former anger. He reached forward to run a hand over Sherlock’s thigh. They were both crouching now facing each other, sitting on their heels, knees bumping together. A bit like the stereotypical figures on those awfully gaudy paintings found at almost every asian restaurant they were frequenting, thought John amused. The mental picture helped him a bit to ease the misery he felt at listening to Sherlock.
“Good,” John nodded. “That’s… good.” he said, copying Sherlock's own earlier reaction to show that he had understood, too. He looked down for a moment and up again, smiled to himself. “Yeah, really good actually…”
His hair unwashed and plastered to his head, his shirt hanging loosely, collar buttons open, exposing his throat and top of his chest, one shoulder bared with his movements.
Sherlock had been reserved lately, always seemed anxious to be dressed impeccably, curls styled artfully. Of course he had patched Sherlock up regularly in their early days and Sherlock hadn’t particularly cared about decency, but not since he had come back. John had never really understood why.
John swallowed and didn't answer, still holding Mycroft's gaze. Mycroft had a point but John had never been someone to back down. Mycroft only nodded at him and turned towards the screens again. Pointing at one screen in particular he said: “Look.” Nothing more.
His worst fear crept up on him and made him shiver. John turning his back on him, mistrusting him… the one person who had said 'I know you're real' when everyone else had fallen for Moriarty's mind games… the one person who had said 'You could' when Sherlock had convinced everyone else that he was fake… the one person who mattered. He couldn’t allow this to happen!
This girl, she had a friend, her only friend. He was a street cleaner. He was very wise even if he appeared to be unremarkable - entirely unjustified in Sherlock's opinion.  One time, she took a walk with this friend, who was sweeping the street with his broom. She asked him how he managed not to get hopeless in the face of the long street ahead. How could he keep going and not give up? ‘Sometimes’ he had said, ‘sometimes there's a long road ahead and if you only ever focus on the end of the road, on the end of your path, you will think you'll never be able to do it. You get exhausted and anxious, you'll hesitate and doubt and in the end you are not a single step closer to your goal. But if you take one step at a time, just one step, one sweep with your broom, in the end you'll see that you did the whole street without even noticing. And you'll be happy. And that's important.’
“A friend…” Scott said sceptically. Even downright disbelieving. Jeez, what was up with that guy today. “You don’t have friends.” He almost spat that word out.
John looked up at the man behind the bar, now aware that he hadn't even wasted one glance on him until now.
"Had to prick you several times. And I only had that right arm of yours. The left crook was… nevermind. I don't even know how often I had to put damned catheters back in. You ripped them out in your sleep… God knows how you did that…" chuckle, "couldn't leave you alone for one minute…" laugh, "nothing new there, yeah?" He sounded fond. Fond?
He sighed in relief when he heard Greg enter the boat, even though he wondered if everything was alright. But the moment he heard Greg's whistling he knew the date had gone well. He was torn by the contradictory feelings barreling in his chest. He was happy for his friend. Of course he was. Greg deserved some happiness and company and… love? And so did Molly. He wished them all the best and hoped that this would develop into something serious. But at the same time he felt heartsick with all the missed opportunities, with all lost chances. With everything that wasn't possible any more, no longer an option.
taken him to hospital and they would have run tests too, wouldn’t they? What would have happened then? He would have been furious. Mycroft wouldn't have thought twice about  sending him back to… but who am I kidding… he would have known anyway. And…," here John lowered his voice, nervously keeping an eye on Greg in the corner of his view. "And cases, Molly… he wouldn't have been allowed on cases anymore. And that's his everything, Molly. You know that. I couldn't do that to him. It would have been hell for him, it would have killed him. Well, and… you know… Mycroft knew and he didn't force me to bring him anywhere but … home.”
Sitting in the cold, in the dark, breath coming in puffs, John slowly, slowly calmed down. After a while he started to shiver. He let himself fall back on the deck chair, wanted to tug his vest down and his pants up, but his hands were sticky and he realised that he came unprepared. He closed his eyes and huffed a laugh at the unintended pun. He lay there for a moment, the buzz still lingering, his body still humming from the intensity of the sensations.
John's eyes followed the direction of his pointing finger and the moment he realised what he was seeing he inhaled sharply.
“I'll get us a refill, yeah?” He asked without waiting for an answer. He made his way up to the bar and dumped the empty glasses on the counter.
"I thought more of a… night owl," John said, seductively, voice low now himself in revenge for Sherlock's earlier obvious manipulation. "
Nearing the shiny black door, John caught the faint sound of a violin carrying through the air. It made his heart beat faster. He had missed hearing it so much for far too long. Even before their massive argument, their separation, Sherlock hadn't played much anymore. He hadn't picked up his beloved instrument like in the early days, randomly playing tunes he loved or John loved just to indulge them. Before the fall it had inextricably belonged to their life together. It had been part of their connection, had added to their closeness
He looked at the mess he'd made. He quickly got up and picked a wet flannel to clean his partner from the half dried sticky foam. He took special care of his cock, pulling back the foreskin, exposing the sensitive glans to wipe it carefully clean of the remains of the foam. This goo bursting from unknown chemicals and uncountable perfumes really shouldn't be used as lube…
“Well shit.” Greg said again as if to confirm it. “Who would have thought…,” he took a sip of his whisky.
Only back then, all the way back in 2003, he had packed his bags with fatigues and combat boots, had taken on his new gained rank expressing a certainty he hadn’t felt at all and had left his life behind in the belief of adding his part to the salvation of the world. How wrong he’d been!
“Do you mean… is it…” He had the browser open and was about to start typing, when a big hand closed around his and stopped him in his efforts.
Turning the corner that would lead him to the dreaded place he was heading to, he could feel his nails cut into the tender flesh of the palms of his hands. He welcomed the pain. It grounded him, made him aware that this wasn't a surreal alternative universe or one of his nightmares, which had changed shape after… the fall. No more gunfire, dust and heat. Although the screams, the screams stayed. Other voices, other words, no less horrifying. Now his dreams were covered in London dust and haunted by the muffled thump of a body hitting a solid pavement.
I’d love to know though how you found me and my blog if you’re not (yet) part of the community? Not that I mind! I’m rather flattered! I’m just curious…
"Later I tried to tell myself that I was jealous of him,” John soldiered on, voice small but determined, while Sherlock let his gaze wander over John’s torso. “A much nastier feeling, you know? Would have explained the ache…" If the sharp scornful edge that had snuck into his voice hadn't gone unnoticed, at least Sherlock didn't show. The slight trembling of his fingers however wasn't lost on John before Sherlock's hands steadily splayed on John's abdomen, in firm and unhurried strokes mapping out the landscape of John's skin. The unsteady breath he took pulled John out of the cocoon of sensations he had been lost in and he realised that he needed to go on. Check off that chapter. He wanted his full focus to be completely back on Sherlock again, but this had to be said. Now. He couldn’t just stop and let it hang in the air. He longed for more lightness. He was sure though that at some point they would have it. But only if they got rid of the burdens weighing them down.That was what had gone wrong in the past. He would not make that mistake again.
"I love you so fucking much… I want you so much..." John panted, holding their faces close, pressing their foreheads together. "Christ, what you're doing to me. And I've barely even touched you yet…"
"The first time I loudly proclaimed not to be gay, was like slapping her in the face. And I knew what I was doing to her. And did it anyway."
He had never craved to watch someone wake. But the image of John slowly blinking his eyes open, messed up hair, pillow creases on his cheek, filled him with a kind of warmth he had only ever experienced in his imagination. His heart spilled over with tiny bubbles of joy and happiness, dancing and spinning through his body, getting caught between his ribs making them tingle; in his stomach making it twist; in his feet making them fidgety. He knew he wouldn’t be able to hold back to lean over and kiss him. John would probably complain about morning breath, but Sherlock wouldn’t mind.
John blushed. He felt caught out, which shouldn’t have surprised him, facing the most observant man on the planet.
John looked closer, initially trying to figure out the item in Sherlock's hands, but the moment Sherlock stepped into the light, John winced in self pity. From one moment to the other Sherlock was… for the lack of a better word… illuminated. The fascinating play of light over shifting muscles and tendons on Sherlock's forearms and hands caught his attention first. That was where his gaze had lingered after all. But soon his eyes drifted over the lean figure walking onwards unaware of the mind-blowing sight it provided. The bright and vivid light of an early morning pouring over Sherlock got tangled in the fine tips of the man’s messy curls pointing out in all directions, like ruffled feathers, shine-through enough to create a glowing rim framing his serious face. The white shirt seemed to become even whiter in the light, all the shifting folds and creases hugging Sherlock’s upper body, sinfully pronouncing his shape and outlines. The seam reaching his hips delivered a stark contrast to deeply black pants the material of which, pitily, absorbed all the light, making it difficult to distinguish any other details than the curving of an delectable butt. John was astonished how light and fairly sparse the hairs on Sherlock’s legs were in contrast to the nearly untameable mop of ebony curls on his head. Of course, he had seen Sherlock’s legs before, goddamn… he had even completely undressed the man not so very long ago… but never like this. Never able to really look, to observe, to admire, to… cherish, without the fear to be caught or deduced. And surely never under the same circumstances. The still timid sunbeams being caught like tiny sparks reflected by the little ginger hairs, sparkling in the shifting movements of Sherlock finding his way through the room, creating shadows on his inner thighs where the hair emerging from under his pants was a bit thicker.
He wasn’t aware of the knowing grins of his friends and his blushed face that gave him away. To be fair he wasn’t the only one flustered and agitated.
"Sherlock," Mycroft tried again sternly. "Setting up an entirely new and, by request if I might remind you, untraceable identity takes time."
"I know, John." Sherlock pulled him into a hug again, "I never wanted to hurt you either. And still, we did. Over and over again." he paused, sighed. "I have this terrible feeling from time to time that we might all just be human."
“You've had a lot of relationships, John. They never lasted. You always ended them.” He raised his eyes to look at the sky. It was still blue, just some feathery clouds sprinkled over it; the sun still high although on its way back to the horizon already. “You’ve loved other people before, why would this relationship be different? What if I do something that will make you end it?”
“You can easily restart it,” he said with a thick voice and John couldn’t shake the impression that it was about much more than just the song.
Holding her weight with her one hand she curled the fingers of the other one, now damp from her mouth, around the pole, slowly sliding it up and down adding tiny twisting motions of her wrist; relishing the solid material of the pole.
Narrowing his eyes he took in the pile of sofa cushions. He himself was prone to piling them up when he needed to go to his mind palace, picking all the cushions he could find, nestling into them and lying there for hours.
“Oh my god,'' he whispered even though he wanted to scream it out loud, for the whole world to witness the miracle that just happened to him. “Oh my god”, just a breath, barely words at all.
“Not enough for my taste,” Scott rumbled, which sent a wave like hot liquid into John’s lower regions. He sat up straighter and crossed his legs. Just in case.
Without any shift in her tone—at least not to the friendlier side of the spectrum—she had gone on giving him a wigging.
He left immediately and when arriving at the location someone was already waiting for him and steered him through the hallways. It wasn't Mycroft's usual office though he was led to but some sort of monitoring main office. Dozens of screens showing the streets of London, some insides of buildings, following some person's ways. John was astonished and disgusted at the same time. So, privacy was an illusion after all. He should have known, being familiar with Mycroft and his techniques, but only now he realised the extent of it. John stared in disbelief until Mycroft raised to speak and John remembered what he was here for.
“How am I supposed to know?” John gestured, nearly sloshing his beer on Greg’s face. “That’s what he said. And the way he said it, it sounded more like a some
John first raised an eyebrow in confusion—what was Sherlock on about? No idea, they were mostly well educated and an essential part in their health care system, also irreplaceable and valuable co-workers. Then, realising the context the question was asked in, he blushed furiously.
“In that case, I’ll ask Mycroft to better replace me with a gorilla. More surface.” John mused while nuzzling Sherlock’s neck.
When John came back from the much needed toilet break, he stopped short when he re-entered the main room.
"How did you find us? What do you want?" John clenched his fists. The psychopathic smile on the fishy face of the cold sleek man he had encountered on their first night, didn't do anything to ease his rattled mood.
"Uhm...okay then," the other man cleared his throat as well. "Are you sitting comfortably? Or lying down? Or whatever one does in this sort of situation?"
?" he said to one of the faceless dancers he didn't care one speck about and pushed without waiting for a response past her.
After a moment he heard some shuffling from inside and a faint shimmer appeared in the headlight. The lock clicked, the door opened and Mrs Hudson appeared half hiding, clutching her dressing gown shut in front of her chest.
He had underestimated what an impact a single word message would have on him. He hadn’t fallen asleep, working himself more and more into a state the longer the night lasted. Picturing all kinds of worst and best case scenarios without coming to any conclusion about what the best way to approach Sherlock could be. It was true, he had initiated the meeting, the talking. The fact that he found it necessary and rendered it the only solution to all their misery hadn’t changed. Nonetheless, that didn’t mean that the nerves didn’t get to him.
The song continued as John hadn’t reached the button to turn it off in time. He wasn’t even aware of his hand still hovering mid-air. His mind going blank. '
When they had settled back into their tangle of arms and legs and hands and hearts, John explained, "I might have started a poll."
John slammed the door shut behind him—at least he tried, but that damned thing just slowly and silently slid shut and snapped into its lock. He scowled at it as if the stupid door would care. For good measure he also punched it with his fist, which he regretted immediately.
The room was tidied up. Same as the kitchen, nothing of the clutter he had left behind was left where it had been. His music stand where it should be, books and papers stockpiled in the bookshelves disguising the gaps left behind where John's books had been. Suddenly Sherlock remembered the box, the John box, and he frantically searched the room with his eyes but it was nowhere to be seen. Where could it be? Upstairs? In John's room…
During his day brooding inside the boat, John hadn't noticed how bad the weather had become. The rain poured down like an impassable curtain. Of course, John had neither a hood nor an umbrella and so it wasn't long before he was soaking wet. The water ran in small streams down his face and his neck as he rushed from boat to underground and from underground to… Baker Street. No, it wasn't home anymore. It was Baker Street.
"I didn't tell anyone. But Harry and I… she knew. We both knew. I would have denied it if she'd ever asked though. But we knew.” He paused for a moment, actively taking in the moment. Reminding himself that he wasn’t just recalling his past, but telling about it. Telling Sherlock. For a reason. “There was this guy…"
“I’m fully capable of showering, John. I’m not that exhausted. I’ve had worse and managed.” Sherlock said calmly, cautiously.
I'm so proud of you all and very grateful that you are still here reading and suffering through this with me and my idiot boys. Fear not, the end (of their and your misery) is nigh. Hold on just a bit more and you'll see the light at the end of the tunnel. And for everyone who misses Battersea-Sherlock (like me): he'll be back soon, despite his own undertakings.
The buff security guy guarding what seemed to be the back entrance of a club just nodded at Sherlock in apparent recognition and let him pass unhindered, but crossed his arms and looked down at John when he followed in obvious warning not to cause trouble. Jeez, what had he gotten himself into.
Changing his movement in a sudden he let his upper body fall to one side, letting one leg carry all his weight, stretching the other one high into the air before suddenly he snapped it back, turned, slumped down in a crouch before rolling his body back up again in one fluid motion.
"At my service?" was what came out in a high pitched voice after John had found it back after being stunned into silence. "That sounds like you're serving the queen." he huffed incredulously.
3.) Due to the current Corona-madness I'll probably have to stretch the posting schedule. I'm aiming for the next chapter to be posted within two weeks. Although I can't make promises right now! I'll make an update post on tumblr as usual and hope that Ao3 will have its emails sorted any time soon! What I
“Or — of course, you can also go back to Tottenham Court and take the Northern Line as initially planned. Although, that would mean to admit a failure and therefore some kind of weakness, so you won’t do that. Also, the route suggested by me is much better as it probably spares you several minutes of walk without taking any longer in total.” Scott rattled on, quite bored.
"I don't care about traditions, you have a peculiar definition of fun and there're stores where I can buy my biscuits."
“I have to make some calls first, arrange some things. I have to get a spot in the schedule for the performances. Not everyone will be equally pleased to see me back." Sherlock said.
“After… what?” John sat back on his heels and innocently looked up at Sherlock. Although his own tenting trousers undermined the effect of innocence decidedly.
John huffed, pleased, and went looking for the song. Once he found it, he placed the phone on top of their joined knees.
Almost immediately, Sherlock shouted out, unable to keep his eyes open, his head thrown back, his body tensed before his hot release spilled into John's hand, into the black lace of his tightly strained panties. Through the force of his orgasm his semen stained the suspenders and straps, painted wet blotches on John's shirt and trousers.
“Or do you just want to listen, hmmm? Oh, you’re a kinky one, aren’t you?” Scott’s voice continued, even though John still couldn’t fathom that the voice belonged to the same man. Could voices be lent out or something? The saucy teasing grin seeping into it made it almost unbearable.
When the morning came creeping in, pale and dreary, forcing it's vile fingers of smudgy grey light through the crack between the curtains, Sherlock hadn't slept at all. He forced himself to get up, put on his dressing gown and shuffle downstairs into the kitchen. He was lucky that nobody was around, although he was certain that the house was run as incessantly as an anthill. The coffee in the coffeemaker, ready and waiting, was proof enough as Sherlock was convinced Mycroft hadn't fixed his own coffee or tea since adulthood.
"And… you now have a closet full of sugar daddy worthy Posh Pimp attires.” Sherlock seamlessly returned to his masterful teasing. He bit his lip and wiggled his eyebrows. John huffed a laugh but then frowned.
“Wow, seriously? Where did you learn that?” John chuckled and almost choked on his own spit when the man calmly and smoothly said, “Self-exploration.”
But he didn’t notice and he didn’t care, because that exact moment, the catlike woman sat and swung her legs smoothly over the edge of the stage.
"Okay," Sherlock nodded, contemplating, then inhaled deeply and fixed John with his gaze. "No, it's not drag in particular what I'm doing there, even though that's where my roots are." He stopped John when he wanted to interrupt. "That's where I started, back in the days when I wasn't in the best of places. When I didn't have a John yet…" he added softly, pressing a quick kiss on John's lips. "I was bored, I was trying to remain occupied  while staying out of prison, hospital or rehab. I had a strong bond with my uncle Rudy back then, who was a cross-dresser. I loved him dearly; he was the only one who didn't ask questions or had any expectations of me. With him I could just be… myself," Sherlock shrugged one shoulder and John took his hand, running his thumb over Sherlock's knuckles. "That's how I came in contact with those costumes, fabrics, make-up and so on. When he passed…" Sherlock swallowed, "the drag scene was the first thing I thought of to seek comfort. However, quickly I realised that it wasn't what I wanted. You have to know, John, drag is not only about the dresses and the appearance… it's a lot of drama, competition, humour—the witty kind, although sometimes pretty rude—and most of all about showing off."
And that was exactly what Miss Pirate was giving to full extent; just not on the rod John would have liked. Slowly licking broad stripes and flicking tiny licks, Miss Pirate made her way up the pole—holding and caressing it with her hands she slowly straightened, caving in her back to present her plush arse, suggestively hidden under a bouncing skirt. By the time that her body was pressed flush against the metal, John could make out more than one man in the audience, discreetly rearranging their private parts; he only barely withstood himself. He did have to keep up a cover after all, he just wasn’t sure how much lusting after your own… uhm… commodities was acceptable.
How much easier this was with Sherlock, John thought. They had never even discussed where to go. They just did, falling into step with each other, walking in sync and heading for one restaurant or another in unison.
When he peeled himself out of bed not much later, he wondered how he would be able to even survive this day without falling asleep on his feet. When he then padded to the bathroom his back and neck and all joints actually reminded him painfully that he wasn't the youngest of all 'confirmed bachelors' anymore. The mirror above the sink confirmed this cruelly, showing him pillow creases on his cheeks, the ever growing bags under his eyes, the rings accentuating them tinted in an even darker shade of blue-ish grey than usual, although the rest of his face was pale in a way that he could compete with Sherlock and win. To make it all worse he hadn't been to the hairdresser the last couple of weeks as his mind was occupied with more urgent topics. Now he had to pay for it; his hair didn't want to be tamed, he looked like a scarecrow.
Just when John was close enough and wanted to speak up, Sherlock’s laser eyes snapped up and pinned their focus on John’s. John’s brain immediately booted down, mesmerised, hypnotised, by sapphire eyes swimming in night dark ink. John swallowed, unable to say a word. Not fair, he wanted to be angry, he wanted to give Sherlock a piece of his mind. What did he even think? Running off without John, apparently knowing about the Moriarty-creep. And he really couldn’t tell John his lovey-dovey-lap-encounter with that Moran fellow was coincidal… Jeez, at least a bit of background information would have been n…
Just as Miss Pirate had predicted, he didn’t have to make any effort—people were practically competing for his attention. It was a rather heady feeling, although the things they wanted his attention for were a pretty cold shower. More like an ice bucket actually.
“So, if after any of those countless tedious dates there was the intention and mutual agreement to have sexual intercourse, you invited your — 'casual affairs' seems to be the term eluding you,
He threw Greg a glance who nodded and John tapped the screen. He dropped the phone on the kitchen counter between them with a hollow thump which echoed back in John's chest, picked up by his heartbeat, echoed endlessly until it faded into nothingness like a terrified cry for help from the bottom of a rift.
. John had been left confused, disappointed, and yes… now he could admit it… heartbroken. Now though he wondered, had Sherlock told him how he had felt after all? Had John heard the music, had he been told but he hadn’t listened?
“He was a dancer, you know?” John said, panting, still out of breath from the kiss. He didn’t know why it seemed important for Sherlock to know.
He was pulled toward the open space at the heart of the building like a moth to the fire, not even knowing what he’d find there, not even sure if Sherlock would be there at all and what he’d be up to. But he sure as hell knew what he wished to find and he startled himself with the intensity of this thought. Why would his heart start beating faster, why would he feel this little flutter in his stomach? Was it the nervousness about the situation? Was it the insecurity about where all this was leading to?
In a futile desperation to do something, anything, and not just sit back and accept, he had asked Greg for the camera he knew they had used for the video Sherlock had taken for his birthday back then. Greg hadn’t asked, had seen on John’s face that he wouldn’t get an answer anyway. Probably, he didn’t need any answer. Greg knew. Still, John had waited until Greg was out of the house… well… boat… and had set it up. He had recorded the video only once. Didn't watch it back again. Didn't retry. This wasn't a play, this was no game. This was just him. And Sherlock. If John had learned anything, then it was that words once said couldn’t be erased, written over, re-taken. Life was no stage, love was no drama. No rehearsal, no glamorous premiere, no fans to cheer you on. No chance to see it from afar. And most of all, there was no happy ending guaranteed.
“Thank you,” came the quiet and timid response. Not a second later though, “I merely wanted to apply my new gained skills of colloquial language to gather information about it’s benefits in contrast to a more sophisticated approach of interpersonal interaction.”
The moment Sherlock stopped typing and hummed happily behind his laptop, John looked up to discover a wicked smirk on the detective's face. His eyes twinkled mischievously and John knew, this meant trouble.
He had purchased it after the one time they had ended up surrounded by trees, no street and no civilisation in sight in a goddamn place in the wilderness behind the boundaries of urban life. They'd had no fucking idea where they were. It had happened after chasing one or another criminal by foot. And of course, both their phones had run out of battery and there had been no way to contact anyone. It had been nerve wracking, especially with a sulking Consulting Detective at his heels.
John’s heart clenched, ached with the regret of all the lost opportunities. They’d wasted so much time. They could have avoided so much pain, so much hurt. John understood, he could feel Sherlock’s suffering, the tight tangle of contradictory emotions, of regret and gratitude. That they had been allowed to find each other. That they had missed the chance to be more.
Apparently done with defending her crew, she twirled her weapons in her hands, stretching her arms while doing so and turning to face the audience—propped up on her spread knees, center stage right in front of the catwalk, stilling her weapons by placing her hands still holding them against her hips. The thrill of the ready to fight weapons held by big but delicate hands, long slender fingers with dark purple painted nails splayed around a slim waist clad in a tight corset of purple velvet, decorated with metal chains and fine embroidery, sent a collective approving hum through the audience.
He kept his head held high and his gaze defensive even if on the inside he didn't feel as confident at all. He felt dissatisfied and defeated, but under no circumstances he'd reveal this to Mycroft! Proudly he continued his path.
It had definitely been a big part of what had caused Sherlock’s restraint. However, it appeared there was more that held him back to fully trust and give in to the new them.
He had always known that he needed John, he had known that John kept him alive. That he had to live for John.
"Eleven." Sherlock didn't even know why he had answered. It wasn't Mycroft's business. Only, in a way it was.
“I’d say so, yeah.” Greg confirmed. “I just hope that silly idiot detective of yours has listened in, too! And if he has, I really hope for his own good that he’ll get up off his arse and finally does the right thing. Bloody git that he is!” Molly nudged him with her elbow in his side.
. Although it wasn’t any better without the man's physical presence, when the John Sherlock was playing about and playing for existed only in his imagination. Too easily the lines got blurred where imagination ended and music began, where Sherlock's body melted into sentiment, where the instrument became John.
He didn't know what to think. What to make of it. John didn't make sense. Was it the alcohol talking? Perhaps the whole call was only encouraged by the drinks...
Only… he couldn’t say it. Of course not. Sherlock had made it clear that John wasn’t the person he wanted. He wanted distance. John could give him that. His mission now was, rescuing the last remaining shreds of their friendship so that he wouldn’t have to live a life without Sherlock. Hopefully, ever again. They had to find new grounds, find a new balance. They had tried to go back and that hadn’t worked out well, so forward was the only direction to go now. Better get used to it.
He stopped and grabbed Sherlock’s coat sleeve. The detective turned immediately and studied John, frowning.
Even John himself felt the tension rising each time Miss Pirate was about to leave the stage again—balancing herself on her heels as if it took no effort whatsoever, her hips swaying broadly while she was strutting over the narrow extensions spreading from the stage in all directions.
He held Sherlock in his arms; he felt so small like this. Sherlock was trembling and a bit unsteady on his legs so John let them just slide down against the cupboard doors until they sat on the kitchen floor, never letting go of the man in his arms. Sherlock didn't resist, just leaned on John for support. John pulled him even closer and Sherlock let him. He ran one hand up over his back and cradled Sherlock’s neck, with the fingertips of the other hand he traced a loop between Sherlock’s shoulder blades, an endless loop of lying eights. The infinity symbol, he realised.
He brushed his nose against Sherlock’s, marvelling at the ease with which he did so. No hesitation, no doubts or restraints. As if it has never been different, as if this was their natural state of being. And still, the excitement at the novelty of it all sizzled through his system and sent sparks flying into the thin layer of air between them.
She moved her fingers to the top button of his shirt and flipped the first button through the hole. John shivered, even though he could burst from the heat rising to his face, fully aware of the small patch of skin revealed by his open collar. When no rejection came, Miss Pirate seemed to be encouraged and made work of the other buttons, cherishing each new bit of skin laid free by running her short but well-manicured nails, painted in the same deep purple shade as her lipstick, across his skin, causing shivers all over his body.
Carefully yet focused he made his way up the stairs. Intentionally not avoiding the one creaking step. The sound filled him with the tender feeling of coming home and the excitement of a new beginning.
Some memories of last night- had it been last night? - worked their way through the mud of his mind. People slapping him on his back in recognition; ‘Hey, you back man? Thought you'd got off!’... suspicious glances his way of eyes unknown... glazed eyes not seeing anything in the faces that were familiar to him. Offerings and bargains for dope in exchange for money, or sexual favours, or both. What he couldn't remember was if he had accepted.
"Oh, but I already have." The hateful sleek voice of the just as much sleek and hateful man it belonged to sounded from somewhere within the dark.
“Oh,” whispered Scott, then started hesitantly, gaining confidence with each of John’s approving hums, “you already know the upper part, so… there are my feet to begin with. They’re quite big, but sinewy and slim; same as my hands.” ...appreciative, enticed hum… “directing my gaze upwards, following my legs, which are long, as everything on me I guess…”
indulged in the profanity of common radio. Until now he hadn't even been sure whether his brother even knew how to turn on such an ordinary device… but honestly, radio? Now?
"I don’t get it, Sherlock," a trace of anger again. A forced deep breath, then calmer, "if it is what I want and what you want, what's keeping you?"
"No Greg, seriously. I texted, I called. He doesn't pick up, he doesn't answer. Uhg… this is driving me nuts." John moaned.
However, at some point the fragile lines had begun to blur. It had all started with some crumpled banknotes in a tea tin. John had found them one morning, sleepily reaching into the cupboard and fishing out the wrong tin. His not yet completely awakened brain hadn't been able to make any sense of it and hadn't deemed it important. So, he had just switched the tins, because brewing a tea out of 50 pound notes would be a shame.
“Camden…” John grunted. Had he gone insane? Why would he tell this guy where he lived? One shouldn’t trust strangers; that’s what his mum already used to tell him. For all he knew Scott could be a serial killer. He definitely was crazy enough for it.
"You!" John spoke again, cupping Sherlock's face with both hands; holding him; steadying him. "I choose you, Sherlock. You're the One. You are my One! And I've never been happier."
for himself. To live with him. In his quarters. As some sick sort of treasure, just to sit behind glass like some breakable China. That matches what I deduced. At least as far as him wanting me alive, or rather something in that range. That's also why I was certain he wouldn't harm me. At least not seriously. As he said, he just likes to ‘watch me dance’…”
He had stared eyes wide, not able to tear his gaze away from this unfamiliar creature taking over the whole space. This ethereal being, whom he could in no way align with his flatmate, whom he thought to know better than anyone. But apparently not.
Suddenly Sherlock started turning. Like a whirlwind. He turned and turned and turned. John didn't know such a thing was even possible. Sherlock was moving faster and faster still. To John it felt as if Sherlock was spiraling somewhere he couldn't follow. Out of control was what came to his mind, but it was exactly the opposite that was happening. It was as if Sherlock was rising higher and higher, growing and taking more and more solid shape before John's eyes, while blurring into an unrecognisable reflection of his former self. He was drifting more and more out of John's reach although hardly even moving from the spot.
“Don’t need biscuits anyway,” he smirked at Sherlock, who smiled coyly back and looked slightly embarrassed about having been that transparent. “Or do you have a raging need for food right now?” John winked at him and Sherlock only huffed but couldn’t hide his smile, because they both knew that food would be the absolutely last thing on Sherlock's mind right now. With that the tense atmosphere in the room got a bit lighter, breathing was a bit easier.
“You should have been more careful and more precise in your announcement, then.” John smirked, immensely enjoying the direction the events were taking. He ran a finger over the smooth skin of Sherlock’s jaw. “If I’m not mistaken then
“Of course… of course, we are, John! I told you that. In my text. Don’t you remember?? You’ll always be my friend. No matter what.” He even looked a bit desperate now, panicked, John thought. He couldn’t wrap his head around what was happening here. He was losing track of Sherlock’s train of thought, of his change of mind. He felt fuzzy. They spoke with each other, but did they talk?
“How can you be sure?” Sherlock shouted, but reigned his temper in immediately. “You can’t know,” he said, in a lower voice, calming himself down. “John, be honest. How often have you been in danger because of me? How often have I hurt you?” When John stayed silent, Sherlock only nodded. “It would have been too much eventually. At some point it would have been the last straw, it was
John lost his temper for a moment. Sherlock could feel through the phone how John got himself back under control. He was trying, Sherlock realised. He was trying really hard. Sherlock's heart sped up a notch. After a while, calm, gentle, "You could, Sherlock. If anyone is that clever, it's you. And… we're not 'people', Sherlock. We never were. We've always been just Sherlock and John. When has anything
Home. Home was a scruffy flat. Home was no milk in the fridge. Home was two chairs in front of a hearth. Home was a boiling kettle. Home was socked feet coming down the stairs. Home was hideous jumpers. Home was grumpy swearing. Home was greying hair and bright blue eyes.
"Sherlock, listen." She cleared her throat and seemed to prepare herself for what she had to say. "Greg phoned me and told me that you're back at the flat."
His thoughts came to a screeching halt when he saw Sherlock shrugging to himself, then reaching for his belt and starting to unbuckle it. John swallowed hard when Sherlock continued to pop open the button of his trousers and lowered the zip. The swish of the little metal teeth being forced to let go of each other seemed to roar in John's ears, echoing through his skull, causing all strings of nerves to resonate, to vibrate, to pulsate, to quiver. He blushed furiously. What was Sherlock doing? Why was he doing it? And even more important… What was John supposed to do? He felt split in two, fighting with himself. The one part was already running as fast as he was capable of, almost reached the exit, almost got away because… under no circumstances was it okay to stay and watch. Sherlock was obviously not aware of John's presence so he felt safe and alone and… well… unwatched. This was violating his privacy in the extreme! This was intruding, this was voyeurism, this was creepy, this was… not okay! He should leave! Most definitely! But the other part of him couldn't move as much as his pinkie. He couldn't leave. He just couldn't. He couldn't turn his eyes away, he couldn't stop staring. Nobody could ask that of him, could they? After all… this was Sherlock. And he couldn't leave now he had finally found him. Maybe not so much found… but… but he was there! In the flesh! And that was part of John's problem. Because what in the name of God was he doing there?
He knew it was silly, but he couldn’t avoid the feeling that this was solely sung for him. If Sherlock wanted to tell him something, he would listen. And if Sherlock wanted him to listen, he would try to understand. That was the least he could do right now.
Searching Sherlock’s eyes he found them closed, almost squeezed shut. A shiver ran through Sherlock’s body and a sudden heat flared up low in John’s belly. It pulsed in waves through his abdomen, his pelvis, throbbing in his cock. Without much thinking he reached for Sherlock’s balls with one hand, cupping them, then pressing his flat palm against Sherlock’s straining erection. He groaned when he felt Sherlock bucking his hips, pushing his groin even firmer against John’s hand.
Then there was a text again. Sherlock's heart didn't jump in silly relief, absolutely unreasonable because relief from what would that be? And for whom? After that, silence again. Waiting again. Counting again. Just because there was nothing else to do he kept counting, adding to each second the matching chemical element sorted by astronomical number on repeat. Because he knew this by heart he also marked the prime numbers in his mind. When this was getting boring, he additionally pinpointed each element's anatomical weight in binaries.
"Scott?" he shouted, frantically turning his head this way and that, searching for his phone. He was lying helplessly on his bed — on his back, legs dangling over the mattress, one hand still holding his spent cock the other trying to prevent a handful of ejaculate from dripping all over the place.
“Fantastic.” This urge-to-praise thing was becoming a tiny bit embarrassing though. “So,” he cleared his throat and tried to do the same with his thoughts. To no avail. “Your pants…”
And finally his feet started to move. Slowly first, hesitantly, little step to his side. This felt better, his footing much more stable. Okay, he could work from here, good position to continue...
Big squishy cuddles for everyone who's reading and following "my" idiots on their journey, for leaving kudos and/or comments, for bookmarking. It means a lot to me and makes my little writer's heart jump for joy!!! 💜
He stretched his arms to his sides and let the palms of his hands smooth out the freshly inflicted creases. The sheets were even more luxurious than his own. Still, they didn't feel nearly as good. It felt empty this bed, too big, although it was as empty as any bed Sherlock had slept and will ever sleep in. He tried not to think of his own bed at Baker Street. Of his own empty bed. He tried not to understand now, that the raging fury he had felt when he had heard the squeaking bed springs and muffled moans from the upstairs bedroom when John had brought over one of his tedious girlfriends, had actually been uproaring jealousy. He tried not to understand now, that the simmering tension he had felt when he heard the same noises and knew John was alone, had actually been desolate longing. He tried not to understand that the emptiness he sensed in this bed was actually the emptiness in his heart. And he very much tried not to think about all the nights ahead he would have to spend in such an empty bed. He very much tried not to think of anything.
kind of prick he'd definitely like to awaken… His own was more than awake already. Hyperactive, so to speak.
Ignoring it, was most definitely no long term option. It was standing between them like the proverbial elephant in the room. Only this specimen was more the size of a mammoth. Standing in their way, leaving them no possibility to move. This way they were not able to take any step forward, but there was no way back either. He couldn’t believe this was a state Sherlock would be willing to live in. Staying. Just staying… boring. So something had to be done about it and John was determined to do so.
Baffled, in a mix of disbelief and disgust, John watched the heretofore fierce and combative Moran lower his eyes and blush. He complied with the order and released Sherlock's curls, even patted him on his head. Sherlock responded with a hiss and a jerk of his head, but instead of the curls the man took hold of the vest and in no time his gun and Sherlock's temple were back in contact.
Well, he didn’t want to talk anyway. What he needed was a shower, bedroom, doors closed, world locked out, mind-palace. As always. It was only to hope that John would keep it at least a bit quiet. Sherlock wasn’t able to stand any more input today.
Her hands came up from her hips after slowly tracing his pulse with her fingertips and folded behind his neck.
"No." Sherlock murmured into John's hair before pressing a kiss on top of John's head. "Even you, John Watson. You're the bravest man and the most human human being I've ever known."
that emerged from the mass of ballast falling off their shoulders. They had talked, finally talked, in depth like they never had before. How, John wondered, how was he still not able to make sense of everything he and Sherlock had said.
Silently he added: “We should stop fighting the inevitable. Spare us all the troubles. It’s not worth it.”
“Oh god… John…” Sherlock breathed out, his knees buckling, his feet almost slipping on the wet surface.
“It’s not only your father though,” Sherlock tried to reign in his elation. “That’s what the world is like out there. Outside of a safe community. We still are the ‘fucking abominations’.” He watched John from the corner of his eye. “Are you willing to face that? Able to withstand it? It’s not one man to fight, but millions…”
“It’s just…” Sherlock started, apparently still hesitant. “Well, you’ve not been particularly… sympathetic towards my past. I wasn’t sure you’d be willing to broach that subject again.” Sherlock cleared his throat, tensing up in John’s arms.
would have been something to most likely destroy Sherlock’s life. So he had made his first and last vow to himself – he would never touch any drug ever again if that could cause John to disappear from his life entirely! After a while he had learned to cope.
ship never sinks, Miss Pirate." John whispered against Sherlock's lips before he sealed them with a kiss.
John was afraid to reach out only to touch a massive and cold surface. So he felt his heart hammering in his chest, cautious of every of his movements, hesitant of what to do next.
But the moment he was about to voice his thoughts, as if he sensed it, Sherlock picked up to play again. As if to stop him.
“Well, I have to disappoint you, but it is truly and legally certified my given name. Can’t be helped. Blame my parents.” he huffed.
"Oh no, not that bullshit!" John spat, annoyed. Disappointed? "Sherlock, you're really above that nonsense!! You don't really…"
"That night you told me it had been for a case." John frowned and studied Sherlock, who was looking back at him as open and trusting as John had ever seen him. "I still don't know… What case was that?"
“I will do it again. You know how I am; caught up in a case, bored, annoyed or whatever. I’ll insult you, I’ll ignore you, I’ll criticise you….”
Steadying himself on the walls on his way to the kitchen his fingertips made out the soothing feeling of the pattern of the wallpaper. Grounding, no imagination, in touch with reality.
"Huh?" John, eloquent as always when he was out of his depth. A rueful smile quirked Sherlock's lips. He had loved that puzzled look on John's face. He still loved it, even just the thought of it. His heart writhed in pain, twisted in agony. He wanted to see that look on John's face again, among a million other things John's face had to offer. Yet, he was afraid of his own reaction if he would have to face John again. Would he be strong enough? He knew he wouldn't. He had to keep John at arm's length. But wasn't arm's length still close enough to reach out, to touch, to pull close, to hold…?
He totally ignored the object falling into his lap that the elastic had held in place and started reading.
“Undercover…,” Sherlock squeaked, swallowed, cleared his throat. “You’ve been on an undercover mission?”
“Mrs H was an excotic dancer in one of the clubs he owned. Therefore she was excellently suited to help me set up a routine.” Sherlock stated matter of fact, as if that wasn’t something that left John baffled and doubting everything he thought he knew about that woman, his life, the universe and existence in general.
Staring at these eyes he realised that they were staring back, with a piercing gaze. An amused look crinkled the corners of her eyes lightly and a smirk twitched on her lips. But being all professional she turned away, focusing her attention on another guest.
“I have a complaint though,” he rumbled, sultrily. Dark and sweet, in his best molten-chocolate-y voice. John swallowed. He couldn’t imagine any complaint that warranted such a level of flirtation. “I thought you were a man of honour,
John looked at the screen, eyebrows slightly lifted as if searching for confirmation. Sherlock groaned and let his head drop forwards, a hand rubbing over his face. He didn’t dare look any more, but John, unaware of Sherlock on the other side of the screen of course, kept on talking.
His roaming gaze came to a halt when he spotted his phone, still lying on the floor where it had landed after having been wiped from the kitchen table. He looked at it in wonder as if it had just magically appeared from a parallel universe. It was a bit true though. That moment felt like ages ago. The picture of Sherlock, distraught, lost for words, miserable. Like from a different life. And it kind of was. That was 'then', this was now.
Worse. John didn't want to imagine 'worse' compared to the current situation. He stayed quiet, waited, didn't know what to say.
Miss Pirate threw him one last look then lowered her eyes to the man sitting in front of her, who was invitingly holding out his hand. She took it without hesitation and John’s mouth dropped open when she guided that hand to her waist, running her other hand through the man’s blond hair and slung her flag around his neck to pull him closer. Or herself closer? John didn’t trust his senses anymore. Because… she wouldn’t, would she? No, she can’t… she didn’t… Shit... she did…
Faster than John realised what he was doing he had pushed a yelping Sherlock onto his back, straddling him and pinning him down on the sofa. Sherlock stared at him with wide eyes still framed in their stunning pirate-y vampirish adornment. John’s heart swell and swell and he was certain that it stood a good chance to be considered a medical sensation judged by its size.
"Ah, okay. Yeah, I get that." John nodded, suddenly strangely soothed about the redheaded woman. "So that's not drag then what you're doing there? Or is it?" John was confused.
and he strode angrily to Sherlock’s side with the intent to stay there for the duration of the entire evening. Or longer. Or possibly, forever!
When Greg ducked in again, John followed. Frozen to the core he now welcomed the warmth of the room. Greg hung his jacket, still glowing from the apparently good evening he'd had. John watched him, his heart aching.
'It feels so good to reunite' … Sherlock could only huff thinking of this. Yes, that’s what he had hoped for when he came back to London and tried to find a way to face John for the first time after two years of misery! And what did he get instead? A John Watson who had ‘moved on’! Could it have been any worse? Could John have made it any more obvious how 'good' it felt for him to 'reunite'? He had made it pretty clear what he had thought of Sherlock’s return! Sherlock could still vividly remember the ache of his sore back the moment John Watson had pushed him on the ground in the middle of the Landmark’s.
“Oh, isn’t he sweet? The knight in shining armour coming to rescue his damsel in distress after all…” The pompous arse cooed, completely indifferent to the threat John’s gun and John’s anger formed. “John… So cute. An ordinary name for an ordinary man. You’ve almost tricked me, little soldier. Almost…” he grinned over his shoulder at John, while snapping his fingers and more men emerged from the sidelines.
"Nothing, love. It's just…" he tried to regain some composure, but it didn't help. Especially not, when Sherlock attempted to glare at him in annoyance. "It's just… have you seen yourself in the mirror?" he chuckled some more and pressed a quick kiss on the pursed lips of his partner.
Was this also how he had gotten back here? But how would John have known where to find him? Why would he even bother? Had it been John bringing him here?
“No, no. Stay.” Sherlock rushed to say. “It just looks rather…. delicate.” He cleared his throat and looked away. John frowned upon the light blush on Sherlock’s cheeks. Not that he explicitly observed these cheeks – no way – but he was fairly sure he had seen a touch of pink just before Sherlock turned away. And what a weird thing to say about just ordinary sausage. They were everything but delicious… no wait… delicate it was. Delicate? John looked down into his cup and turned it a bit to look from Sherlock’s angle and took it all in with a new sight. And suddenly “delicate” became a whole new meaning…
Even the neon figures of the digital clock in the laundrette refused to change shape more quickly, when he stared at them while last night’s ‘well-decorated’ bed sheets were swirled and tumbled back into their pure and innocent white state, and the young lady from the washing machine next to his tried to engage him in a futile discussion about the newest royal gossip.
“Yeah, okay…” John laughed, and realised they had indeed reached the next stop. “At your command!” He said joyfully and followed Scott’s instructions.
"I will not deny it, my superiors rather waited for such an opportunity for quite a while, which you are aware of, of course."
“Yes. The lovely doctor who used to live here. Remember him?” she had responded, unflinching, which had been even worse than her anger. Sherlock had lowered his cup and used it as an excuse to lower his gaze as well.
“I’m just surprised, I guess.” John tried to get a grip on himself and calm down. Although he couldn’t suppress the chuckles welling up, from time to time. “Last time we spoke you didn’t even have a remotely sexy word for how to call my...genitals.” John snickered at the memory alone.
"You." John said plainly. Greg barked a laughter, came closer and slapped a hand affectionately on his shoulder.
Sherlock ruffled his hair while pacing grooves into the living room floor. Occasionally he took a detour to the window to check the street. However, nobody had the decency to be a male of 5ft 6 height with sandy-greyish hair, dark ocean blue-green-hazel eyes and a specifically endearing nose.
But the only thing Sherlock could concentrate on was ‘two nights’. Two nights, so probably two days in total.
Sulking, throwing his arms into the air, curls bouncing around his angrily shaking head, he gestured for anyone who'd like to appreciate his dramatics. But it was wasted on his empty bedroom and actually he was happy that there was no-one around!
"Okay, clap it with me then. And go… 1...2...3...O-Christmas-Tree-O-Christmas-Tree… versus 1...2...3...4...Ohhh-Christmas-Tree-eeee-Ohhh-Christmas-Tree-eeee… See?"
“Now listen to me. There’s nothing that needs your attention nor is there anywhere you need to be right now. Except home. Back to Baker Street, little brother.”
“If you stop being ridiculous now, you might manage not to miss your next stop, which is Bond Street, and switch to the Jubilee Line. Then get off at Swiss Cottage and take the bus, that’d be line 31, which will bring you to Camden Town. There you can choose the stop of your liking. However, considering your most likely address, taking all information I have gathered into account, I’d suggest you go to Hawley Road which would mean a walk of approximately three to five minutes to reach your destination.”
"I told myself that I admired him, wanted to be like him—the epitome of a womaniser, the tough underdog, the rebel, who in the end got the girl after all." He huffed.
“Why?” Sherlock asked, just as quiet, squinting his eyes although without the scrutiny the gesture normally held. Honestly curious, empathetic, gentle.
“You have?” Sherlock’s eyes widened, although not in shock or surprise John realised. No, it was something akin to wonder. Recognition even?
Cursing out loud and bonking the back of his head against the window earned him some disapproving looks of the other passangers, but fuck them all — they didn’t know the tragedy that was about to happen.
"You did that for me that… bouncy-thing?" John blushed, which was absurd considering the extent of their physical… uhm… activities.
“Is it not?” Sherlock questioned in surprise. “If you think I’m so brilliant wouldn't I be correct about that? Of course I would but you wouldn't admit to it because you try so hard to maintain your image as the perfect student and friend.”
Obviously new, and completely terrified. "The rest of you, if I see any movement before we are out of eyeshot, Watson dies. Understood?"
“Of course. An unfamiliar home, with an unfamiliar sound coming from down the hall. That is bound to wake anyone up with a history of PTSD.”
, I think to myself, but John has proven time and time again that he is different from the average idiot so it shouldn't be much of a surprise.
John was stunned. He was never denied an ambulance ride. If he wasn't so shocked he would've protested, thrown a fit until they let him on. But the shock is starting to make itself known on Johns body and actions. He has been stunned into silence, and frozen in place, forced to watch the ambulance fade into the distance.
I flop onto the deck with John falling beside me. The rain has eased up and the clouds have thinned, but only just.
Sherlock looked up and glared at the teacher, clearly about to speak some snide remark but John cut in before he had the chance.
Far to the left, past the fireplace is a corridor that they are led through, John only glanced at the other two passages breaking off from the room to wonder where they lead. John considered what it would be like just to wander the mansion, but also concluded that he would get lost.Thinking on it further, he wouldn't be surprised if he wandered into a library and pulled out a book that revealed a secret door that could very possibly trap him inside. Another reason why the Manor feels eerie.
There was a beep and the gates rattled open. Sherlock led the way up the large driveway. It looked like walking through a path in a forest. Large oak trees lined the drive all the way up, and stopped once they reached the clearing where the driveway circled around a median of grass and grand water fountain. Beyond that they reached the steps of the extravagant white mansion.
It took John all of ten seconds after she was gone for him to actually process what had just happened.
“YES!” Harry exclaimed, giggling. “How’s Saturday night? Clara found this great restaurant just in the heart of the city. Dress nicely, we will be here at seven.” Harry ran down the stairs but stopped halfway. “Maybe you shouldn’t ignore my calls so often John, then I wouldn’t have to show up so abruptly. Though I’m glad I did, otherwise I wouldn’t have met your boyfriend.” And then she was gone.
The cab pulled up to Baker Street and the two climbed the stairs silently. Sherlock went and laid down on the couch while John went and made tea, it was a habit the two of them picked up on almost every time they got back to the flat. This time though, it feels different. Both John and Sherlock feel utterly defeated in their own thoughts.
“Oh?” John states. He can’t help but feel how incredibly awkward this entire table is, and he fears it is only going to get worse.
When he finally reaches them, Sherlock surprises John by throwing his arms around him, “John,” he half-yells into his ear, “So glad you came.”
Jack Worthing, a professional dancer, joins Sherlock and Dorian. “Be careful with them, though, they’re deadly,” he comments, eyeing Dorian with what looks like amusement as the boy pulls a bartender over to make an order. He leans over the counter to speak to the bartender then turns back around. He says, smiling mischievously, “Don’t listen to Jack. He’s no head for the happy juice.”
John looks up at the stairs. “Well. Here goes,” he says, and climbs upstairs to knock on the door of 221B.
Sherlock returns John’s kiss with equal enthusiasm, nipping and sucking on John’s lips in a repeat of last night, but this time Sherlock is surer. This time, he’s more confident. This time, Sherlock rubs his arms over John’s shoulders and brings them down over the expanse of his chest, feeling the wetness of his skin and following the trail of his hair down to John’s abdomen, then bringing his arms back up to skim his palms over John’s peaking nipples.
Henry seems to have followed her gaze as he says beside her, “How fascinating. Dorian will be inconsolable about that. Who is he, I wonder, that Mr. Sherlock Holmes should choose such an older man over the exceptionally good looks of young Dorian? “
John felt himself getting calmer and calmer as he walked with purpose towards Mary, already planning his approach. He was going to grab her, kiss her senseless and tell her exactly how in love with her he was.
John grimaces. He doesn’t like leaving Rosie on her own at such a young age. “You can’t stay for five minutes?” He asks tentatively.
“I struggled with it for years, my addiction, and I couldn’t be where I am today if not for the faith and support of my good friends. I always thought sentiment was some kind of chemical defect found on the losing side… but it appears I was quite wrong. The love and care I have received from those around me has saved me more times than I could ever count.” Sherlock’s voice cracks and the video ends. John feels a lump in his throat as he swallows at Sherlock’s admission. He’d never said something like that in John’s presence, and it feels wrong to hear him say it on live television like that. He looks so open and so vulnerable.
I split this chapter into three to torture you guys. But also because I haven’t had time to write the rest.
he thinks, and images of Sherlock’s hands moving sensually in Irene’s body during that first dance come rushing back to him, followed by the images of Sherlock at the dance club with his shirt half-way open and that other woman. John tries to will the images away but finds himself blurting out, “Can I ask about the dancing?”
At first, Sherlock ignores it and they continue to move against each other, the heat of the moment over powering them. The phone doesn’t stop ringing, however, and eventually Sherlock pats his partner’s thigh in irritation as he reaches towards his phone, “Hang on.” He growls. Sherlock picks up the obnoxious little machine and focuses on the name displayed on the screen. He flops forward on the desk and sighs in defeat as he answers the call while his partner behind him rolls his eyes in annoyance.
“Because that’s how we talk to each other. She flirts and I aggressively turn her down, but we keep tabs on each other and make sure that our friend is okay, and when our friend needs help or support, we offer it, because that’s what
“Okay, but John, in all seriousness, how much time do you spend doing all these things for other people? What about yourself? Don't you have needs?”
“-I know” John interrupted, “I just- I feel like I should have seen it coming, and I'm really so sorry.”
