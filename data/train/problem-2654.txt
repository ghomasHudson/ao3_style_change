“So what, these kids broke into your tower?” Lestrade asks, looking dubious and John shrugs.
“Are those fireworks?” He asks, a little breathless because who the hell even lights fireworks in a forest? “That’s not legal!”
This time when Sherlock laughs, it sounds truer. “Sure thing, John. Go ahead and guess my deepest and darkest secrets.”
"Your old woman?" John had asked when he'd first said it and Mike shook his head.
“Someone’s broken in, my typewriters been chucked out of one of the windows!” He hisses and launches himself up the stairs, ignoring Sherlock’s frantic call and instead focusing on the large hole in one of his windows and the mess on the floor. “They’ve completely fucked everything up! They stole my fucking sheets, Sherlock? Who steals fucking sheets?”
Not John shrugs. “No, I’m not. But I am all you have left.” Sherlock concedes it. “If you’re going to admit that you’re in love with me, don’t do it to a ghost. Find him, find the real me and let him know how you feel.”
Sherlock has absolutely no idea what is going on.
“Tell me now, and tell me straight Sherlock. Am I making a mistake?”
“I understand.” Sherlock whispers, more to himself than to John, but the other man stills hears it anyway and turns to Sherlock with raised eyebrows.
“Well, you hardly gave me a moment to…” He breaks off and stares at his tower in horror. “Sherlock, someone broke in.”
“I don’t need looking after.” Sherlock mutters, because somewhere in his brain he thinks he does. That’s why his brain suggested John, that’s why it suggested a Doctor.
“No, no, no! Jesus, no!” Sherlock cries and John wonders if he actually thought he was being serious. “Just make sure they don’t do it again. Take their stuff.”
“That would be helpful, yes.”
“You're not real.” Says Sherlock, then he braces his arms against the window, and stubs out the cigarette.
“Sorry, I just…” Sherlock can’t find the right word, so he simply shrugs but John seems to understand, his face softening, if that is even possible, until Sherlock wonders if he might cry. There is nothing said, but the timer ticks down to two minutes and for once in his life, Sherlock fills the need to fill the silence. “I am not going to pretend that I won’t miss you, John.” The doctor gasps quietly and Sherlock stores the sound in what his brain has labelled ‘John #2’ so that he can remember it for the rest of his life. “You have been a dear friend to me, John. You saw in me what others did not and you have saved my life.” When Sherlock looks down at him, he does so with as much raw emotion as he can handle. “And I am very glad that I met you. I hope that you find your unimaginable happiness.” He holds out his hand, the pale skin poking out at the end of the black leather glove. It shakes between them, gentle at first but steadily increasing when the doctor simply stares.
“You’re good at working with people but you’re working as a fire watch who spends months at a time holed up in a tiny little tower in the middle of nowhere? Yeah,” John says as he flips over his bed. “That makes loads of sense.”
“Oh it very much does.” There is beat, and then Not John is squinting at him. “Jesus, you look terrible.”
“You use this to spot; you guessed it, fi- what the fuck?” John whirls around stares out of the window in shock.
Lestrade nods for a moment then shoots thumbs up to the Ranger who has just finished putting in John’s window. “Alright then, it was a pleasure John. I’ll let you know if we find anything towards this but, just to warn you, things like this don’t normally get figured out. They’re too complex and there isn’t enough evidence. Hell, for all we know those girls could be out of the state by now. There really isn’t much that we can do.” They shake hands and Lestrade reminds him to contact him as soon as he gets out of here.
In the past few months, something has changed between them. Sherlock can’t look at John without remembering that he left John, not the other way around, and that he is lucky to have what he gets. That doesn’t stop the flare of jealously and well disguised hatred every time he sees Mary; Sherlock doesn’t know if that feeling will ever fade. But the change means something more than that, and Sherlock wonders if it has anything to do with the marriage or whether something had happened to John that he just hasn’t deduced yet. The answer doesn’t come, not even when Sherlock tries to summon it with every last ounce of strength in his body, no deduction pops up around John’s head. There is no loud exclamation from the speakers, no proclamation of truth. Just John sighing loudly when he realises that Sherlock hasn’t been listening, and then scolding him for something that Sherlock doesn’t hear. One thing that he is sure of though, and what he has been sure of since John announced that he was moving out, if that he doesn’t want him to go.
“You’ve got a front row seat for what might be the biggest fire of the year,” Sherlock says and he sounds tired to John, though he can’t argue. He’s been exhausted, what with the hike that he had to do up to the Aspen Grove that took much too long in his opinion. “Beautiful, isn’t it?”
“So, what about you? I already know why you’re here, you’ve got major PTSD and can’t go back home, but you’ve barely told me anything about yourself.” Sherlock says as John’s tower slips over the hill and John lets out a laugh.
“I’m fond of people who do their job. The rangers are idiots, excluding Lestrade who has at least the intelligence to phone me when something comes up.”
“What do you want me to say? The whole place is open, it’s crazy and members of the public are scattered all around it like malignant growths. You’re going to have to face more than one creepy guy around the forest, John. Better get used to it.” Sherlock says and quickly goes onto talking about how many people visit the park each year. John talks to Sherlock a lot about almost nothing, the park and its secrets and almost everything that Sherlock knows about it he tells him. He’s also told about the ranger, Lestrade, who pops down every now and again who has a raging crush on Molly and that he’ll probably see him at the next supply drop. He finds out about Mrs Hudson, a woman who had taken one look at the skinny, disproportionate boy that Sherlock had been and trained him in the art of knowing fire, and being capable of destroying it. He also finds out, from a slip of Sherlock’s tongue, that he is very gay and very proud of it. John’s cheeks flare up when Sherlock says. “Yeah of course. My parents weren’t very supportive when I told them at dinner one night that I liked having cocks shoved down my throat, but it led me here so I don’t think that it is completely terrible.” And John chokes, earning a laugh from Sherlock that makes goose bumps break out all over his arms. It’s a lot to take in but the hike back to Gladstone is long enough for him to become readily acquainted with Sherlock, although he says hardly a thing during the man’s monologue.
“But you are my London, John!” Sherlock groans, because John really is being an idiot. “You’re every street, ever house. You’re the lights and the sounds and the smell after rain. You are the inscription on the third lion that talks about love and you’re the Latin I have burned into my mind from St Pauls. You are every language, every detail. I love knowing you and knowing that I know you,” John’s chin has hit his neck but Sherlock keeps on. “Knowing you is what I want and London is where I need to be, where I want you to be too. A rare thing, I know, but sometimes, just sometimes I-“ Sherlock cuts himself off and slams his fist deep into the pocket of his coat. The plane that he is watching crosses the sky.
“You have a tally?”
He has to remind himself to breathe.
John finds Carl Power’s body three days after the Redbeard Fire starts. It’s early in the morning and they’ve just been told that the helicopters will be making rounds soon, that they need to be back at their towers but the afternoon if they want to be hauled out in time. He’s gone down into the cave where he saw that creepy guy and he notices a shoe almost immediately. It doesn’t take long to climb down the rock face and drop into an open cavern.
Before he gets back, at a cave he recognises from the map, John sees a figure. They have a torch and they flash it at him for a moment before sprinting backwards, ignoring John when he calls out for them. “There’s some guy out here giving me the creeps.”
But John is standing there, freshly shaved with a meagre suitcase of possessions until they can organise for a van to bring the rest. John had asked Sherlock if he wanted to keep the chair, to which Sherlock went off in a strop and didn’t come out until John ordered Thai. They both decided it should stay at Baker Street without broaching the subject a second time. Sherlock can remember the disappointed yet vaguely hopeful look on John’s face when he tells Sherlock over dinner that he will truly miss him. And the adventures, of course, because that was what made his life worth living again. Sherlock had blushed, he remembers, but had brushed the comment to one side and hoped to whatever god there may be that the lie wasn’t as obvious to John as it was to himself. Apparently not, as John had settled back down and hadn’t spoken a word for the rest of the meal.
The air is crisper somehow when he taxis into the small runway- partially hidden by forest- so much brighter than just minutes ago when it felt like he could barely breathe. It might be something to do with the lack of civilisation or the trees or that great big lake he had seen on his flight over that he was definitely going to have to investigate very soon. But all the same it is like filling his lungs with pure oxygen and John just can't get enough of it.
“Actually, I just really like trees and really don’t like forest fires.” He mutters and John thinks that he must have hit the nail right on the head if he’s acting like this.
It takes Sherlock a moment to realise how utterly terrifying that is before he hits his head with the heel of his hand over and over until both his forehead and his palm go numb. “Stupid,” He hisses, head falling back to thump painfully on the wooden leg of the table. “For God’s sakes Holmes, you might as well have admitted that you loved him, for all the good it did you.” Sherlock stares miserably off through the kitchen. “He’s still gone.” The silence that answers him is too loud for his ears. There isn’t anything, no soft humming of John changing upstairs, no toilet flushing, no tell-tale clatter of keys in the lock. Just Mrs Hudson and the radio downstairs. Sherlock absolutely hates it.
“Yeah, I am.” And he is, he’s watching the smoke bloom across the sky, how it partially hides Sherlock’s tower from view.
Sherlock snorts, or makes a noise like it, John can’t really make out through the static. “Your job is whatever I say it is. The closest ranger is a day away. Go down there and stop them.”
“Sherlock, please,” John’s eyes are wide and sad, something soft and pleading in them that tugs at Sherlock’s heart. “We don’t have a lot of time and…” John breaks off, the tell-tale clenching and unclenching of his fists between his thighs screaming at Sherlock. So the detective just nods at John and kicks at the floor beneath his oxfords. “I’d rather spend this time with all of your attention, not just a bit of it.” He mutters and Sherlock does his best not to scoff. Impossible, he thinks, you always have my attention, John. But John doesn’t know that his door is locked and Sherlock doesn’t really want to tell him so he remains silent.
Sherlock goes quiet for a moment and then makes an unhappy noise. “That’s what I meant, John. Something isn’t right.”
Nine minutes to say goodbye, it seems. Sherlock has bid farewell to many in less, obviously, but this is John. And for the life of him, he can't work out how to summarise John Watson in nine minutes.
Sherlock ignores him and instead says, “I’ll have Lestrade and the other rangers keep an eye out for them over the next few days.” Sherlock coughs and he mutters something under his breathe that John has to strain to catch. “If you can even call them that.”
“You’re having an affair, correct? That makes sense seeing as-“
Inside, he meets Molly Hooper, a girl not that much older than him who's lived in Shoshone for most of her life and who knows the park better than anyone.
“Alright, Soldier Boy, settle down. We all know that you’re big and scary, no need to threaten my life.” Sherlock sounds really much too happy with his reply and Joh wants to kick him in the face.
Sherlock doesn’t get to finish because John starts shaking his head and mumbling. “That isn’t what I mean Sherlock and you know it.” But Sherlock doesn’t know it.
There is a body, in shorts and a red shirt lying beside some broken climbing equipment. “Are you… Oh God.” John mutters and inches over slowly. “You’re Carl Powers.” The body is rotten, clearly it’s been down here for ages and John has to pull his shirt up to cover his noise from the stench. “You poor kid. You fell, your stuff gave out. You poor fucking kid.”
“Sherlock?” John asks and when Sherlock nods, John throws himself at him and kisses him fiercely. Somewhere, in the back of his mind, he realises that Sherlock is laughing but ignores him instead. Because they are safe, the helicopters are coming and Sherlock is alive, not dead at the bottom of a cavern like Carl Powers. “I thought that you might have left already.” John whispers as Sherlock wipes the tears away from his eyes.
“Jesus, there you are. I’ve been worrying my arse off.” Sherlock mutters and John feels ill.
John gapes for a second before crossing his arms. “Na, course not. They had fireworks and they’d lit a campfire.” He looks back to the tower and shakes his head, trying to calm his frustration. "And in fucking fire season no less.”
He’s barely set his pack down by the time something squawks in the corner and it takes John much too long to figure out that it’s the radio.
In the end, the girls are gone and John walks back to the tower in the dark.
“I’m glad you’re here.” John says the second that images of IEDs slip into his head and he hears a soft sigh from Sherlock.
John rolls his eyes because he can, and Sherlock can’t see him. “It’s a map. Although I assume it has another purpose?”
“Shut up.” John mutters and he hears Sherlock laugh from over the line, flipping off the other tower as he hops down the staircase.
And even though he’s teasing, John isn’t in the mood and he tries to keep his voice in check with the next message. “Look, I just hiked for two days so I really don’t follow whatever it is you’re doing right now.”
“As always, Lestrade is wrong.”
“What is?” John peers at the tower in the distance and the figure that he can see hunched up beside the window.
“Either there are bears out here or someone has an axe and an anger problem. You find that as disconcerting as I do?” He asks.
“Of course it isn’t!” Sherlock calls. “You need to get down there right now and stop them. Fire danger is through the fucking roof!”
Sherlock makes another noise but doesn’t say anything more on the subject. “That’s a great idea, go ahead.”
“Ex-lover, then?” John asks finally because that is really what he has been asking from the beginning.
“So a twenty five year old who’s been out here since he’s nineteen, who came all the way out here. As you said, everyone comes out here to run from something.” John leans his arms against the table and watches the tower in the distance carefully. “Let’s see, you’re probably a recovering drug addict who left because your home reminds you too much of your teenage years and you’re parents are so disappointed in you that you can’t face them.” In truth, John means it as a joke but there is silence from the other end of the line for a very long time until finally, the lines clicks again.
John is wearing his black jacket with the patches on the shoulders and elbows today. It's a particular favourite of Sherlock's because it was what he was wearing when the first met and he hopes that he's memorised every stitch of that jacket because he can't do it now, not in nine minutes an definitely not when he still can't get into John's room. So instead, Sherlock works out the temperature of his mouth by the small puffs of his breath in the cold February air. Every exhalation fogs the air with a drifting, ephemeral white cloud that barely dissipates before the next warm breath condenses into another misty plume. Sherlock doesn’t need to memorise John’s breathing pattern because that is tucked neatly away in his room as well but Sherlock watches just in case, because a moments worth of data is better than none at all.
He comes across beer cans next and sighs before he reports them. “They left their beer cans down here,” John’s eyes trail upwards and he rolls his eyes. “And their packs.” He sees a thin plume of smoke and lets out the longest and deepest sigh that he can manage. “And a campfire.”
Sherlock lets out a startled breath. “Huh. Wow.”
He hates the thought of John not being there when he returns from a case; he hates the idea of someone else touching his John. His wonderful, brave, oblivious John who can’t be half as clever as Sherlock thinks he is if he can’t see the detective tearing himself apart. Or maybe he can and just chooses not to care, like Sherlock chooses not to notice if John and Mary have had intercourse after John comes back to the flat late at night. That, he thinks, is something he will definitely not miss. The absence of that will be bliss.
“John,” Sherlock starts, sounding much too fed up already. “There are five hundred pound bears out there. They sharpen their claws on trees. Don’t you know this?” He shuffles something in the background and John hears a can hiss. “What the hell do they teach you in military training?”
John laughs to himself and crosses his arms, closing his eyes against the light. “It’s going to burn for a long time.” He says.
“Don’t give me that Sherlock, you know me better than anyone.” John’s eyes are sincere, and warm and pleading for Sherlock’s help. So he gives it.
“Is it one of the teens?” Sherlock asks.
Sherlock laughs again and John warms a little. “That is the Osborne Fire Fighter, invented in 1914 by W.B.…?”
John lets out a long suffering sigh and rubs at his forehead. “Okay, you’re probably out here because no one back home can stand you.” He says, and doesn’t turn off the radio when he mutters. “Which, after this brief introduction, isn’t a big shock.”
“What?”
The Pilot echoes his instruments into the comms and John listens out for what he knows which is, in truth, very little whilst he waits to leave. The tinny radio had been turned on almost as soon as they had left the airport and it is blaring something by the Rolling Stones that he isn't particularly fond of, but it is enough to distract him from the sinking feeling that he gets as the Pilot adjusts his rank tabs.
“You do?”
John has to laugh. “Like kick the shit out of them?”
Sherlock glares. “That doesn’t count.”
“Redbeard. Had him when I was a kid; grew up in a lonely household and he was pretty much my only friend as a kid. He died when I was young.” Sherlock coughs and John doesn’t know what to say. “Listen, there’s a thing in the middle of your room with a round map on it, do you see it?” And John radios back an affirmation. “If you’re really the military man Molly claims you are, I’m sure you’ll be able to tell me what that it.”
He is cut off by John barking out a laugh, a loud one that fills his ears and makes him feel dizzy. He waits a moment for John to finish and opens his mouth when John straightens again, only for him to double over, wheezing against the doorframe.
Sherlock jumps the second a taxi door slams outside of Baker Street. He nearly falls out of his small perch on the windowsill and looks down in time to see an umbrella disappear under the door. He dismisses the idea of Mycroft because there is no way in hell that his brother will ever take a cab, and his brain flits through hundreds of options until whoever it is begins up the stairs and Sherlock worries that he’ll faint.
“Sherlock!” John cries and hears him groan.
John smiles and tips the glass of whisky in his hand back. “I thought that you didn’t like fires.”
Sherlock sounds like he’s blushing. “We could do stuff. And watch this fire.”
And how can Sherlock lie to John Watson? “As you know, John, I am not familiar with the fair sex or even romantic entanglement in general…” He doesn’t make it past that sentence, because John grips at his arm so tight that it hurts.
“Don’t you ‘honestly John’ me!” Not John glares at him and Sherlock rolls his eyes so that they sink back into his skull.
It doesn’t take him long to find his cigarettes, but finding a lighter is harder, so Sherlock uses the stove instead, switching it off by slamming the palm of his hand into the knob. Then he settles down inside of the window, crouching up so that his knees are pulled into his chest and his toes are pushing into the opposite side of the frame.
“Don’t be so vulgar.” The look that John sends back is from beneath raised eyebrows.
“Then don’t be such a spoilt twat.” Sherlock doesn’t know how to respond to that because he is, indeed, a spoilt twat. When John sees this he smirks and looks back to the tracks. “You know, Sherlock, for a genius you are remarkably dim at times.” Sherlock pretends not to scoff. “I lost you once, Sherlock. If you think that I’m going to let you go again then you’re an idiot.”
His coat lands beside the door, sagging in its own weight as he stumbles past it, crashing over the table and scrabbling out until two palms hit the wood head on. He is shaking so hard the he can barely breathe and it only takes a few moments for his knees to give out, sending him tumbling to the ground.
“Carl hated climbing, his dad or guardian, this scary bloke called James Moriarty brought him out here in the summer to get him away from home; I think he was having a messy divorce with his newest wife or something. Anyway, his dad used to be in the military until he was discharged for a non-fatal injury. He was missing four of his fingers.” Sherlock says and John has to wince, he’s seen injuries like that on a man before and they never end well. “I used to talk to Carl all the time because his dad was in the tower most days but Carl loved to hike so I used to walk him around the trails.” And it sounds to John as if he is smiling. “He used to get into trouble with the Rangers a lot for going out without his parents and I vouched for him. Got me in even more trouble but he could come and go as he pleased which seemed more important.” Sherlock says.
“I’m leaving her.” He says it quietly but Sherlock hears it anyway.
John smiles towards Baker Tower and watches a silhouette flash across the windows for a moment before disappearing. “Goodnight, Baker Tower.”
Sherlock makes an affirmative sort of noise. “They almost always contact me about some sort of problem in the park. I’m good at my job and I’m good at people, there’s a reason that I’m working here, John.”
The realisation hits Sherlock like a brick. He stumbles back from the door and onto the arm of John’s chair, eyes wide whilst he thinks. John chuckles lightly and follows him across the room from the door. “John-“ Sherlock whispers and he thinks that he might be crying, but he can’t really tell. John stands in front of him and takes his face into his warm hands, rubbing his thumbs across Sherlock’s cheeks.
“The Redbeard fire. I like it.” He sounds husky as if he’s trying to stop himself from crying. “Are you looking at the fire?”
“You’ll need to remember to sleep, of course, I’ll have Mrs Hudson drug your tea if you don’t, and god knows you’re incapable of doing it yourself.” Sherlock zones out once again as John rubs grime from the door of the taxi off of his fingers, spouting some sort of boring nonsense that Sherlock is deleting as soon as he hears it.
John had raised his eyebrow and stared. "So she's going to be my radio pal for the next six months?" And Mike had sent him the most apologetic look possible.
Now that Sherlock thinks about it, that black jacket isn’t his favourite anymore. It has started to rain. A plane creeps over the edge of the station roof and Sherlock can’t be bothered to figure out the make.
“It’s just odd.” Sherlock says, just before John falls asleep.
Sherlock frowns. “Your natural instincts as both a doctor and a soldier led you to save me; your help was invaluable that night.”
There is music blaring in the distance and John reaches past his embarrassment for a second to roll his eyes and remember to be angry for a moment before he rounds a bush and finds two bras and pants.
John furrows his eyebrows and stares out at the small explosions in the sky. “Is that really my job?”
John cuts him off then, because it’s way too close to the truth for comfort. “What’s wrong with you?”
"I'm sorry?" He asks. "Holmes?"
John grabs the radio and holds it up to his face. “Hello?” And he barely gets the words out before he is cut off.
“Climbing, I think. He must have been exploring the cave and maybe his rope gave out. His dad probably didn’t even know how he died; he just went missing one day.” John says and heaves himself up onto a small rock ledge.
Nine minutes.
Sherlock nods. “I do.” John looks down at the ground, mouth tipped up at the sides, and nods to himself. There is something inside of Sherlock that forces his lips apart, and he speaks without realising it. “I kept an eye on you. Not all of the time, but once a month, if I could, I would make sure that you were alright. Sometimes I sat in the waiting room at the surgery, I watched whilst you visited my grave and a couple of times I was just across from you on the tube.” Sherlock’s face falls without him realising it. “You never noticed. But that was alright, it was better that way.”
“Oh bloody hell, Sherlock,” John stumbles out between puffs of laughter, wiping at his eyes. “I’m not having an affair, Sherlock.” It takes a second for him to gather himself, and then he stares Sherlock straight in the eye and nods. “You remember, the day after we met when I shot the cabbie for you?” Sherlock nods silently. “Why do you think that was?”
“Goodbye, John.” Sherlock murmurs, tugging his hand out of his glove then holding it in front of him. John flinches minutely, the words dragging back something dark from inside of him, and then he takes Sherlock’s hand and shakes it.
John rubs his hand over his eyes and sighs. “I don’t know, Sherlock. I don’t know.” The smoke is almost unbearable now and it hurts his eyes just to keep them open. He’s going to have to get out of here soon otherwise he’ll die from carbon monoxide poisoning.
And because John doesn’t know anything else, he says it back.
This John is absolutely terrifying. Sherlock wonders, for a moment, if his eyes are really that dark or if it’s just his head and when they shift, he shivers.  “I feel as if I have made a mistake, John. Letting you go. I’ve given away my unimaginable happiness.”
“Actually, I’ve been up since about six. I’ve been catching up on what I need to know and didn’t think I needed to contact you.” He replies and places the radio next to him to continue working. In the back of his mind he remembers his typewriter in the back of his bag and promises himself he’ll get at least one page written today.
“I’m sorry John,” The smaller man looks up at him and Sherlock sighs. “I fear that I have made the last few days difficult for you, if that is the case…”
“Let’s worry about this in the morning. I’ve patched a call through to Lestrade who said he’ll be out here in a couple of days and I’ve asked him to bring through a new window for you or at least something to completely cover it up with.” Sherlock sounded just as shocked as John and somehow apologetic.
John’s response is a light chuckle and a shake of his head, though Sherlock can tell that he definitely isn’t rejecting him. The movement is more fond than anything else and it sooths Sherlock’s nerves a little. “Sherlock, you’re entire life is in London, I’m not going to ask you to leave this all behind.”
“Who is it?” Sherlock asks, and John snorts until he sees his eyes. Then his smile falls and he just blinks.
“I assume so. There’s hardly anyone else here and no way would someone just break in for fun. This has to have been revenge or something; they think that I was spying on them or something. “
“Congratulations. In future, contact me when you wake up. That way I can give you all the jobs that you’re being paid to do.” Sherlock says and the happiness from earlier melts away on his tongue. “Anyway, there’s still a few hours of daylight left to get some work in and you’re up much earlier than everyone else so you can count that as a tally in your favour. I can see you’re at your desk.” He says and the line cuts off and John silently curses the fact that the window has no blinds.
"Not like that. She's this lovely lady who runs all of the fire watchers in Shoshone; you'll probably hear her on the radio a couple of times. She's up at the main camp so you might not see her."
“What do you want?” Sherlock asks, because he isn’t high and he isn’t being tortured so John being there makes no sense.
“Hang on; what do you think I’m on about?” John looks concerned which only adds to Sherlock’s confusion.
“Carl Powers is dead.” John says. “He’s in there, the cave.” And he falls silent as Sherlock breathes in.
John tries not to roll his eyes. “Do most people oversleep their first day here?” John asks.
“Osborne?”
“Is that okay?” John asks, and of course it is. Everything is okay. Because John is here, standing in front of Sherlock, and Sherlock wonders if this is the closest he’ll ever get to complete understanding.
"Mike Stamford. It's a pleasure." He grins, John can see that much through his visor and John grins back.
The Pilot is kind enough to pull his luggage out of the back for him and he's carted off of the runway by a tired looking man in a jumpsuit who claps the Pilot on the back and tells him that his readings were good the entire time. Eventually, when they've reached a smaller out building, the pilot turns to John and holds out a hand but doesn't bother with taking his gloves off.
Sherlock stills for a moment because none of it makes sense. John being here when he is supposed to be on the other side of London and the fact that he is here to see Sherlock. He is here to tell Sherlock that he is leaving his wife. “Why on earth would you do something like that?” Sherlock sounds more affronted than he means to, but John just rolls his eyes.
“Okay then. How about the Redbeard fire?” John finally says and it takes Sherlock a very long time to answer but John doesn’t rush him.
“We could go somewhere.” Sherlock splutters out and John smiles. The time ticks down to one. “We could move into the country somewhere and keep bees.”
“Okay.” Sherlock patches through and says nothing else.
“Ugh, well, what about Blackwater 2.0?” John asks and he hears Sherlock snort.
Lestrade raises his eyebrow and looks at John, hands on his hips as one of the other rangers slipped the new window into its frame. “And were you?”
How did he not notice? Sherlock spent every moment with John and he honestly did not notice that he had been having an affair. When Sherlock met John’s eyes again, they shimmered in the darker colour before the air cleared and Sherlock let out a long breath. “Oh.”
He comes across a tree about halfway to the lake, all ripped up with half of the bark missing and deep gouges out of the wood. He doesn’t even realise that he’s calling Sherlock before he hears the kssh beep of his radio.
The Doctor steps through the door and sniffs loudly in his direction, cringing. “Christ, Sherlock, you smoke a whole pack or something?” Then he shakes off the umbrella and ruffles a hand through his hair.
“No, it looks like it was lost a long time ago. I’m flush with ropes and now have a camera to take pictures of the average views and my gorgeous face. Thank you, Carl Powers.”
“Don’t feed anyone a knuckle sandwich, big burly soldier boy.” Sherlock says and John rolls his eyes again, even though the words make him uncomfortable.
“Good deduction, that.” The voice comes from the kitchen. John appears around the corner, cup of tea in his hand, dressed in jeans and that burgundy cardigan that has always been a secret favourite of Sherlock’s. Sherlock doesn’t move.
Sherlock had played the violin. He had played everything that John had loved, every piece that John had listened to and praised, which was admittedly a very large list, and he had played it with emotion that made his fingers sting. He only stopped when a very tired looking John stepped out from the kitchen and, in a very tight voice, asked Sherlock if he could just quieten down a little bit. Sherlock nodded dutifully, and John padded upstairs again, the usual sounds of John getting ready no comfort in this situation. So Sherlock had sank onto the sofa and pretended to think whilst he tried not to cry. And when John came back down to brush his teeth; Sherlock closed his eyes until John was gone.
"Well almost anyone," she stammers and John can't help but quirk up an eyebrow at that. "Mrs Hudson knows it like the back of her hand and then you've got Holmes, of course." And that's a name that John hasn't heard so far so of course he has to investigate.
“Lookout?”
So when Sherlock nods and John kisses him, Sherlock’s mind flashes with one final thought.
Not John nods into his cup. “Precisely.”
Sherlock can’t deny it. The plan is fool proof. Apart from John’s inevitable realisation that Sherlock is in fact gay, that John is in fact not, and the disgust that will ensue. Sherlock never wants to see that look on John Watson’s face ever again. “I know I’ve no right to feel it, but that doesn’t mean I don’t.”
“God, they’re idiots. I would like to retract my statement about knuckle sandwiches. Feed away.” Sherlock mutters darkly and John laughs but moments later, he stops.
John glowers at the radio and feigns nonchalance with his next call. “Oh, lots of things like how to do pushups, how to read maps. And how to fire a gun.” He hisses the last words out and has to pull the radio away from his face when Sherlock barks out a laugh.
Sherlock barks out this sharp sort of laugh that warms John a little. “Oh yeah, it was hot and heavy. Of course, Carl Powers was twelve years old so our love could never really be understood.” It takes John a moment to understand the teasing in his voice and when he does he groans loudly.
And so, fortunately, is Sherlock. He’s sat on a rock, covered in ash and dirt and his face has smudges all over it but he looks at John and when he smiles it’s blinding. “John!” He cries and stands. He looks nothing like John imagined, a tall, wiry man with bright blue eyes and curly black hair that sticks up from under his cap.
John rolls his eyes. “Yes Mary.”
“It couldn’t have been the girls.” And Sherlock sounds much too happy with himself so John rolls his eyes.
John blinks and suddenly Sherlock’s noise fills with the smell of smoke and blood. John is lying on the grass, red on his skin and fire on his clothes. Sherlock is screaming for him, but he can’t hear. “Sherlock?” He barely hears it, and the words aren’t coming from John’s mouth. But it is John, he can hear John. He’s right there. The small taps at his face are what bring him out of it, of whatever that was. A memory, Sherlock supposes, of when John was in that bonfire. That was only a few months ago, yet so much has changed. “You there, Sherlock? Lost you for a moment.” John stands in front of him, and there isn’t any blood in his hair or ash on his jacket. He is safe, standing on the platform with a suitcase in his hand.
“Why don’t we do something else instead, but just as satisfying,” I suggested quietly.
This was a dangerous area to be with Sherlock as I had discovered previously so I didn’t spend too much time there, moving further down instead to graze my teeth along his pale thighs, purposefully avoiding the one area which wanted attention. His beautiful cock was straining against his belly and started leaking little beads of pre-come as I rolled his testicles between my fingers.
I sighed and nodded, feeling drained, “Yeah, I know, Mycroft. I’m doing everything I can. He needs to overcome this extreme trauma he’s suffered and I don’t know how long that will take but we’ll get through it.”
“Which he didn’t think to cover his tracks on,” said Mycroft. “We have his current location and just under ten minutes to surprise him. My people are on the way as we speak.”
Sherlock sighed, closing his eyes and leaning his forehead against mine. I could tell how upset he was that he had gone too far. I wanted to do something for him, something that wouldn’t be too much for them. And I had the perfect thing.
He nodded his thanks meekly, before curling into a ball protectively and switching through the channels without really seeing anything. I went over to my chair as he did so and got out my phone. It was only about eleven o’clock so I decided to text Harry and see if she could meet me for lunch. I sent of a short, polite text before sitting in my armchair and nervously waiting for a reply.
He shook his head uncertainly. I was incredulous, “Not even when you were a teenager?”
“I’m glad he’s got you to watch out for him.”
Looking back now, I think it was because I was so happy to know he was there, safe and sound from the horrors he experienced, and that I was there to protect him. But at the time, my happiness confounded me; I couldn’t understand why having Sherlock’s long legs resting in my lap would make me smile. I then remembered my talk with Mrs Hudson and tried my hardest not to pay attention to the consulting detective, who continued fidgeting and sighing very loudly, inevitably drawing my attention back to him no matter how hard I tried.
“Sherlock, it’s okay, what happened?”
I turned towards him, folding my arms across my chest. Sherlock was staring at the table sadly as I said, “I told you before, you don’t have any reason to be sorry.”
We took a minute to compose ourselves after the heartfelt moment we shared in the bathroom. I’m sure Mycroft could deduce everything that happened, but I wanted to be ready to face the music. I hoped they had come up with a decent plan.
“I’m glad to see he’s getting some rest, he hasn’t been sleeping well lately, poor dear,” she said.
“Did you find what you were looking for?” I asked nonchalantly, trying not to wonder what he had found upon Google-ing kissing.
“Sherlock,” I said quietly, trying to ignore the glorious feeling of Sherlock's hot member in my hand, “what’s gotten into you? Are you okay?”
At the sound of Sherlock’s defiant voice, Moran turned slowly, “What did you say to me?”
It wasn’t a question that much was obvious but I couldn’t quite get a read on why he was wearing that expression on his perfectly sculpted face; it was bitter and angry… and dark. He took a step towards us.
I rolled my hips against him and sucked at a nipple. Sherlock arched off the bed, stopping him from speaking. I shuffled down slightly for better access to his navel, his cock rubbing against my stomach. I nuzzled the fine hair that trailed down tantalisingly below his boxers.
“Okay,” I managed, nodding empathetically. A lone tear rolled down Sherlock’s pale cheek, and I swept it away with my thumb, unable to bear seeing him in pain. Sherlock cautiously kissed me on the forehead before turning away and disappearing into the bathroom.
Groaning, I pressed my thumb over the slit at the end, spreading pre-come over my cock and continued fisting myself under Sherlock’s hungry gaze. The way he watched me, like I was something to be devoured, made me thrust harder and moan louder.
Sherlock waved a hand distractedly, “None taken, we can’t risk Moran suspecting anything and acting out. We’re both compromised at the moment.”
“Here you are dear,” she said kindly as she offered the beverage to me as I sat on the edge of the bed. I noticed it was in my Royal Army Medical Corps mug and felt the corner of my mouth twitch upwards.
Sherlock averted his eyes from the screen to look down at my shoes, “We have no other choice. It’s either sit here and wait for him to attack us in the street or we confront him now and be done with it.”
He looked down at our hands, catching a glimpse of his watch. He pulled his hands back and moved away from me, “Lestrade’s late. Where is he?”
“That’s great!” I cried. We wouldn’t have to confront him, and Mycroft’s people could wrap everything up without us needing to leave the flat.
He took a breath and caressed my cheek, “I trust you. I want more. Give me that.”
I breathed a mental sigh of relief but the next words came out anyway, “Are you sure you can manage on your own?”
“Ugh, tact is tedious!” Sherlock exclaimed. “But yes, do continue.”
He sighed, playing distractedly with the hem of my undershirt, “It’s just, I don’t know it’s hard to describe. I feel so out of control. I want to help with finding Him, but my brain won’t let me. I keep telling myself it’s just another case but when I start thinking about ways to solve it I just, freeze or something.”
I could feel slight bumps on the bones of his wrists and could tell that they had been fractured at some point, then healed in a haphazard manner leaving slight lumps where the injury had been located.
“Eight weeks and you never thought to ask what this was all about,” Sherlock asked with incredulity before turning to me with a roll of his eyes, “You see? Normal people are so terribly stupid.”
“It’s okay,” Sherlock interrupted gently, a small cheeky smile on his lips. “I do want that. Especially if it’ll help with your healing…”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock said sombrely, “I didn’t mean to upset you.”
Over the last few weeks, Sherlock had been acting very out of character. I saw him in the kitchen trying to pour himself some tea but his hands were shaking so badly that he spilt hot water all over the counter.
Mrs. Hudson smiled as she noticed my reaction, “Sherlock said this was your favourite mug and insisted I use it. He’s a good boy… only when it suits him of course!”
“You’re so perfect…” he muttered, drinking in the sight of me as though I was a vision.
I shook my head and placed my other hand on his chest, “No don’t do that. It’s not about that. You know I would die for you, and you have died for me!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Only now had it really sunk in how different that was for him, and how it meant bad news. I thought to myself that I should get in touch with Mycroft to ask him about Sherlock’s behaviour when he had first come out of that hell hole with Moran, as I handed him the remote.
Sherlock rested his head against mine and we stayed silently like that until I felt his muscles, which had tensed upon my touch, relax. I was about to say something else but my phone buzzed from the other side of the room. I placed another chaste kiss to Sherlock’s hand before crossing to pick up my phone, readjusting Sherlock’s dressing gown over the developing hickey on my shoulder.
“You’re going to be alright, Dr. Watson,” said the calm voice again. “It’s just a graze and no major arteries were punctured, but you’ve lost a fair amount of blood.”
“Yes, if you listened carefully, the pavement under which they were digging sounded different to the neighbouring slabs, elementary really.”
“Well, um, since Sherlock got back, I’ve noticed something… about me,” I started uncertainly. She nodded supportively and I continued, “I’ve, uh, realised something that I’m having a hard time dealing with and I think you’re the only one who will really understand.”
Sherlock’s hips stilled but he shook his head, licking a wet stripe up my neck to my ear, “Just need this. Need you. Make me stop thinking.”
“And how did that work out, huh? Tell me… Is he still out there?”
Greg slapped me carefully on the back a few times, “You’re right. Get out of here you two, get some well-earned rest.”
“I do, yes. Do you… want this?”
Sherlock stepped away from me, tea in hand, moving to the other side of the kitchen into the furthermost corner away from me and Greg. The inspector stepped forwards and accepted tea from me before regarding Sherlock’s scars warily and asking carefully, “I know something was wrong last night. Should I be worried?”
“Um, Mrs Hudson…” I said quietly.
He looked up at me with a fondness in his eyes, “I can cope without you for a few hours three days a week, John. I’m not an invalid.”
“Hey,” I said, trying to contain my uncertainty at hearing Sherlock stutter. “You don’t have to apologise for anything. Ever. Okay?”
'Yeah, whatever u need 
‘I think not my pet. In half an hour, I’ll send you the address of a place that I think is better suited to our needs… I would say come alone but I know that the little tin soldier won’t let you out of his sight, so you may as well bring him along. Just make sure he doesn’t bring his toy gun so that we can get to know each other properly. I’m so excited to see you again…’
I heard footsteps on the stairs and Mrs Hudson appeared, slightly befuddled looking, “John, dear, I’m sorry to interrupt but Sherlock’s asking for you.”
I hummed appreciatively as he took his shirt off slowly, facing me now and undoing each button excruciatingly slowly. I licked my lips and wolf whistled as he let the shirt fall to the floor provocatively.
I was surprised at the taste but found it bearable in all its bitter, Sherlockness as I let his softening member drop from my lips. Some of the come that I didn’t manage to swallow trickled down my chin but I could find it in me to care, I just needed to attend to my painfully throbbing cock. I collapsed on my back, letting my head flop against Sherlock’s sweaty chest as I gripped my erection desperately, searching for release.
Sherlock was like a son to Mrs Hudson and I could see the intense worry on her face, so I decided that she needed to know what was going on. I wasn't going to tell her the details of Sherlock's ordeal, not without his permission. I gestured for her to follow me downstairs and when we got to her little kitchen we sat down. I told her that he had been held captive for a period of time while he was away and that he was suffering from PTSD. I didn't mention anything that Sherlock had told me about what exactly had happened to him, but Mrs. Hudson knew Sherlock well. And judging from the moisture in her eyes, she could guess the kinds of things that would make a man like Sherlock Holmes so vulnerable.
With one final twist of my wrist Sherlock was crying out in pleasure and I was not far behind, riding it out with Sherlock’s name like a prayer on my lips. I collapsed onto Sherlock in a hazy state of sheer contentedness. We lay like that for a while as we caught our breath, a sticky mess gluing us together.
Running my hands up his arms, over his shoulders and down to rest on his pecks, I crooned quietly, “Hmm, you’re so perfect…” I placed open-mouthed kisses across his chest, occasionally leaving little love bites where no one would see but him.
“No, I was just wondering how Sherlock is. You know, just wondering what’s going on… I worry about him…”
He looked at me over his shoulder and said cheekily, “Come to see the show?”
"Is that what you realised when you met Clara?" I asked gently.
His breath hitched as he pushed my hand down over the contours of his chest, down towards his abdomen. Sherlock roughly placed my hand over his cock and rocked forwards into it awkwardly. As he leaned into my touch, he whispered in a breathy voice, “Make me feel something…”
“But is it great?” I asked, feeling lost again.
“I could explain why but you would lose interest and probably scold me because of where it came from,” Sherlock replied.
“I didn't tell her anything specific about what happened, I promise. I would never do that, but she's worried about you,” I said. Damn, I should have phrased my previous statement differently.
I pressed a finger to my lips and gestured to where Sherlock was sleeping. Mrs Hudson crept to peek around the corner of the kitchen into the lounge room before returning with a smile on her face. She spoke this time in a more hushed tone.
Sherlock looked at the table and nodded ever so slightly, “Yes. I just don’t want to upset you.”
Harry sat silently for a minute, digesting what I just told her. She looked surprised, but not completely shocked or repulsed like a traitorous part of my brain had feared. She nodded slowly, “Okay, I wasn’t expecting that, but I’m glad you’ve come to me instead of running and hiding like you sometimes do!”
Sherlock had eventually decided he wanted to go on the internet and try to discern the motive for kissing as it kept bugging him while we had been making out on the sofa. I was now sitting in my armchair and pretending to read the newspaper when in actual fact I was replaying the last hour in my head.
I suppressed my laughter and clapped Greg on the shoulder, “But you wouldn’t have it any other way.”
Sherlock watched me examine his hands with a mixture of fascination and enrapture. He seemed to be spellbound by my nimble doctor’s fingers ghosting over his flesh. He seemed calmer whilst watching my fingers so I decided to take the plunge.
Thanks for reading! More coming as soon as possible! :)
“John, just tell me; what’s on your mind?” she asked kindly yet concernedly.
I took a deep breath and decided to just get it out, “I think I have feelings for Sherlock. Romantically, I mean, and now I don’t know what to do.”
I itched to be a part of the planning, the idea of not knowing was already making me antsy, but they were right. I’m not the greatest liar at the best of times and even I didn’t quite know what I might do once Moran was in front of me. The cold rage I feel whenever Sherlock is in danger, rage that I first felt that night when I shot the cabbie for him, was bubbling under the surface. I was suppressing it for now, cultivating it until that bastard was withing my reach…
When I caught his eye he quickly looked back to the TV with pinkish tinges crawling into his cheeks. Now it was my turn to look at the other curiously. Was he blushing? No, he couldn’t be…
My heart stopped. Oh god, had I actually said that to him? What the hell was I going to say to get out of this?
As I reached the kitchen, I turned back and announced in a calm, steely voice, “Alright, here’s what’s going to happen. I’m going to talk to Sherlock and in the meantime, you two had better figure out a plan that ends with that sick bastard dead at our feet.”
“What exactly happened?” Greg asked quietly, looking warily at Sherlock.
I dropped my head to my chest in relief, “Thank God.”
One morning in particular I woke to Sherlock’s sweet music floating through to our shared room. I got up with a smile and padded into the kitchen in my boxers and one of Sherlock’s far too large dressing gowns, leaning against the doorway into the living room with a smile.
“Yeah! That was, that was really good!” I reassured him with a goofy smile on my face I’m sure.
I smiled at him, “Yeah, I’m back. Are you okay?”
Sherlock trailed off and a slight shiver went through his body. Well, now I felt like a gigantic, insensitive arse for thinking with my dick rather than my brain. I scrubbed a hand over my face and groaned, frustrated with myself for acting the way I had.
“Listen to me,” I said, gently but firmly, “we are going to get through this together, all right? No matter what the news is, we’ll deal with it. Okay?”
I went back to the crime scene as Greg was inside once more and told him what I had discovered.
I sighed, thinking rapidly for another solution. He wasn’t ready for this, “Okay, how about you stay here and Harry and I can talk down in Mrs Hudson’s kitchen. That way if you need me you can just yell and I’ll be right there.”
I was going to have to help Sherlock out of his trousers as he was nowhere near steady enough to do it alone. Then I would have to help him into the bath, naked! I felt so awful in those brief seconds of realisation, because my stomach did backflips at the thought of Sherlock naked in front of me.
He nodded back, “Yes, it’s just I’ve um, never actually, well, you know… I’m not sure I know what to do.”
I was glad that Sherlock was finally back at work outside the confines of Baker Street as we entered Scotland Yard. Sherlock’s mind needed occupying and he walked with confidence through the office despite the looks that were thrown our way. He waltzed into Greg’s office with a swish of his coat, just like he used to which brought a smile to my face.
“I was being moved from the basement that I was in when I escaped,” Sherlock said quietly.
I hit the send button and looked up to find Sherlock gazing at me curiously. I could practically see the cogs in his brain working away; trying to deduce what was going on. If Sherlock had been in full health, I would have worried about being discovered but in his current state, there was little to fear, as the consulting detective was not in his best state of mental health.
He was in this state for about a minute, and once Greg had cleared the scene, he stood over us, looking extremely concerned. I was trying to remain calm but my own anxiety levels where threatening to skyrocket out of control.
Sherlock nodded slowly, continuing to run his leg against mine, “Is this a romantic thing again?”
“Oh,” he said with a tired sigh, “I tried to… well; I tried to… get it off.”
“Get it off… I’m dirty… get him out… please… I’ll never be clean… oh god… get him out… I can still feel him… get him out…” Sherlock cried as he tore at his body.
“John…” Sherlock started. He closed his mouth and thought for a moment before saying hesitantly, a glint of worry in his eyes. “I’m sorry, did I wake you?”
I chuckled again, “I think that’s a great idea.” We started walking down the street, past the City Bank as I said, “So I assume you’ve solved the case already?”
Sherlock soon followed, spilling fluid into his pants with a cry. I slumped on the bed, looking heatedly over at Sherlock, “That was... incredible!”
Mrs. Hudson hummed in agreement, “I savour every hug and kiss he condescends to give me!”
“Yes,” Sherlock agreed, nuzzling closer to me, “What he said.”
“Not really,” Sherlock replied, looking down at our locked hands, “I’ve just never really understood the point of it is all. I thought it was strange to want to put your mouth against someone else’s…”
I blinked, eyes watery at his sentiment, clearing my throat before I spoke, “I’ll talk to Sarah at the clinic, see if I can get you in to see a surgeon who can remove it.”
He stepped back and smirked, “I’m so glad you followed my instructions, and how very good you were too.”
“You are so stunning,” Sherlock said breathlessly.
I gazed at him lovingly, taking in every inch of his sleeping form. He stirred slightly and I couldn’t resist kissing his face reverently, everywhere I could reach.
Sherlock pulled away and cleared his throat, “Yes, thank you for everything.” He looked as though he was debating with himself for a moment, before Sherlock pulled his brother in for the fastest, most uncomfortable looking hug I’ve ever witnessed.
Sherlock looked at me and said, “I’m fine it’s just, I can’t concentrate on anything… I keep trying to read but it makes my head hurt…”
He whirled around and stopped playing. The look in his eyes was akin to one of a child caught in the act of doing something they weren’t supposed to. He was only wearing his pyjama bottoms underneath his dressing gown and I could vaguely see the white scar on his flesh poking through the loose material.
I followed Sherlock out with glee as I saw how happy he was to back in the field, no matter how simple he found this strange problem.
“John… John it’s okay. It’s over now.”
“Mycroft,” I said wearily, it was only ten in the morning and I already felt exhausted, “Do you need something?”
“No! It... it was beautiful,” Harry said quietly as she went over and handed the glass to Sherlock, who looked at her with surprise but nodded his thanks as he took the glass. She gave him the painkillers and he smiled tightly as he accepted them. He looked at the little white tablets, but he didn’t move to take them.
“Is this better?” I asked quietly, rubbing my erection against Sherlock’s thigh for some kind of relief. Going slowly was seriously testing my restraint.
“I know. I’m usually always right…”
Moran chuckled again, the sound was like nails on a chalkboard and grated on my tightly stung nerves, “Maybe there is a bit of fire in him after all! It’s always the normal looking ones that are hiding the dirtiest secrets. I did tell you not to bring any weapons, but I think I should check anyway.”
I was surprised that he agreed with me on his state of health, which usually he is extremely stubborn about, “Why don’t you have a bath instead?” I suggested, helping him to sit on the closed lid of the toilet.
Sherlock sighed, gazing at me pleadingly, “Please, John. Can we talk tomorrow? I just want to sleep. I don’t feel… normal… I just want you to hold me so I can get some sleep…”
“You’re welcome. After everything you’ve done for me, I’m going to make sure you are looked after so that leg heals properly,” Sherlock crooned.
The snapping of the laptop lid made me jump and come back to my senses a little. In the moments that we stood frozen around the closed computer, I realised that the sounds of retching from the bathroom had ceased. I hauled myself to my feet and locked my shaky knees. I forced myself to march towards the bathroom.
I raised my eyebrows incredulously.
“I’m alright, Sherlock, I promise,” I gasped, sitting up had made my head spin from the blood loss but I felt better thanks to the painkillers. “Just help me down.”
By the time the car pulled up, the atmosphere in the cab had become so oppressive that even the driver was starting to shift nervously. To be fair, dropping us off at a shady looking warehouse in the middle of the night looked pretty suspicious. I decided to give him a hefty tip before getting out of the car to join Sherlock, who was already out on the pavement observing the building.
He’d been having nightmares for weeks, I knew he had. I could sometimes hear him yelling in his sleep but every time I’d go to his door to check on him, the room would fall quiet.
“Hey,” I croaked, voice thick with sleep.
I looked in and could see his tall shape behind the shower curtain; he was leaning against the wall and letting the jets of water shoot directly onto his head. I said his name once more but before I could say anything else, Sherlock spoke up, “I’m fine John! Just leave me alone!”
Sherlock swallowed his mouthful of tea, “Yes you do. It’s something in between a snore and a sigh…”
Sherlock nodded and strode off, leaving me at the bottom of the stairs. I sighed and shook my head, following him to a cab.
Before long, dark had fallen and I was trying desperately to coax Sherlock into eating something, anything. Sure enough though, I got him to eat a few pieces of toast. While I was eating my take-out Chinese that Sherlock was avoiding making eye contact with, I got a text from Mycroft telling me to go downstairs as there was a parcel for me. I did as instructed and found a bag of tablets with directions to give them to Sherlock.
As I moved my kisses down to his jaw, licking the skin and tasting him, a thrill shivered down my spine. I nipped at the pulse point on his beautiful neck, making Sherlock gasp softly. While licking, nipping and kissing his neck and shoulders, I ran my hands over his torso, getting him used to the feel of me, and I him.
Sherlock scoffed, wrapping his arms loosely around my waist, “Hardly. I’m scarred and abused and broken. Even before Moran I was by no means perfect, even less so now…”
I smiled and nodded; of course Sherlock would want as much data as possible, “Yeah okay, as long as you do it restfully!”
Sherlock smiled in relief and he reached out to gasp my hand, “Good. I enjoyed that. More than I thought I would…”
I knew that Harry was still in the clear with the drinking, so that was a good sign, but she had never been a fan of my flatmate. She had always thought he was a danger to himself and to those around him but she knew what I was going through. After all, she had done it herself, maybe she had some insights she could impart to me.
“Yeah, yeah okay. Just um, let me get a book and I’ll be back,” I said. Sherlock nodded and released my sleeve. I let out a shaky breath and went over to my armchair to collect my book.
“I will see if I can find out anything from the message. In the meantime, I will coordinate with the Yard in order to place 221B under surveillance and protection.”
“Besides,” Sherlock went on. “You start to make this little snuffling sound when you begin to wake up. It’s quite adorable.”
The repetition of my words to him from before made me smile thinly as Sherlock moved his hand from my elbow to take my hand. I drew in a fortifying breath and nodded decisively at Sherlock.
Mycroft nodded gravely. He opened his mouth to say something but Sherlock’s voice echoed from the bathroom, “John… John, I don’t feel well…”
Sherlock’s eyes flew open and he sat upright in bed so fast that I nearly jumped out of my skin.
“Don’t you ever think that Sherlock Holmes! You are the most important thing in the universe and you will never, never not be wanted! Not by Greg, or Molly, or Mrs Hudson and most importantly, you will always be wanted by me!”
“Sherlock…” I interrupted quietly, “What happened? Please! Tell me! I can’t stand seeing you like this…”
Sherlock nodded, “I thought it would help to straighten my thoughts out.”
Thanks for your patience :)
After I had said that I realised how it sounded and felt a burning in my cheeks. But Sherlock didn’t notice, instead, his lips curved into a tiny smile. He didn’t look totally convinced but it seemed that I had reassured him a little.
“Sshh,” I kissed his forehead lightly. “I understand, it’s okay.”
These feelings made me feel so terrible, like I was taking advantage of him or something, but I knew I had to assist him for his own safety. So I grasped Sherlock’s forearm and led him to the edge of the bath. Swallowing hard and trying to push all emotions away, I moved my hands to the waistline of his pyjama bottoms.
Sherlock nodded and although the look didn’t leave his eyes, his breathing became less laboured and sporadic, “Sorry… I j-just… Oh god, I’m sorry…”
“Well, you’re breath seems to hitch whenever I’m near you, you tense up when I touch you and sometimes your pupils dilate a fraction…”
“Thank you,” Sherlock said, letting me pull him down by his curls a plant a wet morning kiss upon his Cupid’s bow that I love so much.
“There was nothing else it could be!” I cried. I then had a thought, “You know, I grabbed him by the wrist the other day and he winced as if he was in pain.” I shrugged my shoulders as if that was evidence enough.
This was all far too confusing to me. We were talking in riddles and dancing around the issue which was making my head spin. I got to my feet and decided to try and make this simple.
Upon re-entering the sitting room, we found Greg bent low over Sherlock’s laptop while Mycroft stood at his shoulder typing furiously on his phone. As I moved through the kitchen, I checked my watch. About 15 minutes had passed since we messaged Moran, which didn’t leave us much time to make a plan.
Harry smiled at me, “Wow, you’ve got it bad Johnny!”
“Yep. Nothing drastic or dangerous, and don’t worry, Lestrade will be there so we won’t be in any peril.”
Sherlock’s head drooped and he trailed off. Confessing all this to me must have exhausted him so I decided to let him sleep. Carefully I extracted myself from Sherlock and laid him down on the couch.
“And I don’t want you to get worse,” I said firmly. "This is going to be tricky for both of us, and I might make mistakes when it comes to helping you. But I know we can do it."
I looked away from her, “What do I do Harry? I’m not gay, at least I thought I waasn't…”
Moran advanced on me and I tensed, but the sound of cocking firearms stilled any movements I may have made. Moran slid his disgusting hands over my body as he frisked me, his touch lingering and sickening as he searched me slowly and deliberately. I refused to squirm under his repulsive hands and clenched my jaw against the slew of vulgar insults threatening to slip from my mouth.
I got to my feet went to sit next to him on the couch, “Just for a little bit. I’ll get Mrs Hudson to come and sit with you and if you need me just send her down to get me and I’ll come straight back up. Is that okay?”
Sherlock nodded hesitantly before disappearing into his room, before emerging with a dressing gown wrapped tightly around him. He quickly crossed the kitchen to the living room and picked up his violin. As he began to play hesitantly, I beckoned Lestrade over.
Some time later, I started to drift into wakefulness, and I could feel Sherlock’s gaze on me. I could also feel the dried evidence of our exploits on my stomach and inside my mouth, which was a far less enticing sensation than the slow dance of Sherlock’s long fingers over my hip. I groaned in displeasure at the dried substance on my belly.
He was trying to conceal it by clasping is hands in his lap but I knew. I could see it.
“It’s just, um… I’ve never actually, properly, um…”
I smiled, it was so Sherlock. His orgasm was so intense last time that it nearly made him black out so he thought it would reboot his brain or something this time. I was completely in the mood for trying something new with Sherlock, but I was worried that this was all just stress, that maybe he wasn’t ready.
“Oh, Sherlock,” I sighed. I didn’t know what to say to him. What could I say that wouldn’t sound lame or insincere? So I did the only thing that I could think of. I shifted my position so I was on his other side and I draped an arm around him, pulling him closer to me.
Wilson looked put out but continued, “Well, then I received another email, just before I was going in to the League’s office, saying that the League had been disbanded.”
“Simple really,” Sherlock replied, passing me the mug of tea. “Based on your regular sleep patterns after we’ve come home late from a case, you usually sleep a bit longer than you normally would. Factoring in the painkillers wearing off and making you uncomfortable, I was able to approximate the time that you would wake.”
“What was that?” I asked softly. He exhaled a shaky breath and lifted his face towards me, scrubbing a hand over his watery eyes quickly.
“Because it’s gorgeous,” I replied plainly, tucking stray locks behind his ear. As my fingers brushed the shell of his ear, I got distracted by the feel of the flesh covered cartilage beneath my digits. I began to pull on his earlobe while I bent to kiss the shell.
I returned and handed the plate to Sherlock before sitting next to him on the couch. He started to nibble at one piece under my watchful gaze. We sat like that in silence for a while until my gaze wandered to the piece of Sherlock’s bare chest that I could see from between the material of his dressing gown.
I nuzzled at the crook under his collarbone, “How? Tell me. Tell me what you feel.”
Sherlock cleared his throat and said shakily, "Yes, he should know. He's been there for me when I was... um, you know, using... by this point he's seen me at my worst anyway. Just don't tell him anything specific. It's bad enough that Mycroft knows everything..."
After moving through dingy corridors that smelled like something died in them (which, let’s face it, something definitely had at some point) and passing even dingier rooms, Sherlock and I arrived in a large cavernous factory space. It was made up of dark grey concrete floors and pillars with a rusty metal mezzanine suspended around the perimeter.
I was just settling back into a light doze when I heard pattering footsteps and then a light, tittering knock on our bedroom door. I looked down to make sure Sherlock and I were both decently covered up, enough to not scare our elderly landlady anyway, before telling Mrs Hudson to come in.
Sherlock ducked his head and continued to gulp down his meal while I averted my eyes, trying to think clearly. Butterflies were making my stomach flutter at the thought that Sherlock found me attractive. I never thought he would ever find another person, male or female, attractive, so this was a complete shock.
I sent her back the address of Speedy’s Sandwich Bar downstairs so that I would still be close at hand if Sherlock needed me and put away my phone. I sat for a minute or two, gazing at the TV and trying to figure out a way I could break this to Sherlock. I decided a direct approach was necessary.
Sherlock smiled grimly, surveying the armed men, “Hello boys. Is that you, Banes? How’s the face?”
Sherlock smirked at me, but I could see hesitance in his eyes. He dropped his gaze to the bandage on my thigh as he began to unwrap it, “Maybe after we’ve showered.” He cleared his throat and continued quietly, “I can still feel his hands all over me…”
I turned towards him with a crooked smile on my face, one that he matched. I nuzzled my face into the skin of his shoulder that was exposed to me, inhaling deeply, “Alright, good. Are you feeling a bit better than before?”
We sat in comfortable silence until I realised something. I leant closer to Sherlock and said quietly, “Sherlock?”
Now it was my turn to blink in surprise, “Right… So, um, what do you want to discuss exactly?”
He nodded and said apologetically, “Okay.”
Sherlock nodded, “What did you do for a living, Mr Wilson, before the League contacted you.”
Sherlock nodded solemnly, “As much as possible in the circumstances I believe.”
There was a pause before he said quietly, “Not really. I had a nightmare.”
“Hmm, like that do you?” Sherlock teased, walking towards me and stepping out of his trousers. By the time he was right in front of me, he was in nothing but his boxers. I looked him up and down shamelessly with appreciative eyes.
“How long…” I wasn’t even sure I wanted an answer to my question.
Sherlock guided the bow we both held over the strings and assisted me in playing the first few notes of ‘London Bridge Is Falling Down’.
Mrs Hudson picked up the pillow that had landed at her feet, chucking it back to Sherlock, “Alright, don’t be too long.”
I nodded, fighting the lump in my throat. I turned away in an attempt to give Sherlock his space when he spoke again, “I don’t think it counts though.”
His eyes fluttered shut as he started rocking in my lap, but it was slower this time, less confidant. Soon he started thrusting a bit harder in my lap, feeling bolder and sneaking his hands up under my shirt. I lifted my arms up so he could divest me of the garment as we dry humped like teenagers.
“Sherlock,” I whispered. It was supposed to be a warning but it came out like a desperate whimper.
instead, and that is not an exchange I am willing to make,’ he pauses, then adds petulantly, ‘And also, what I said was the literal opposite of funeral arrangements. I’ve made my wishes exceedingly clear about that.’
Sherlock smiles, and it’s a terrifying thing. ‘I think you would find that between other members of the cabinet, not to mention the information I currently possess and might just have to publish if I don't get exactly what I want, I have enough support to supersede your approval,
Mycroft leaves after a few more awkward exchanges, and Sherlock’s promise to ring in the morning so they can plan their next move. Sherlock gathers up the files and photos, and arranges them in a neat stack before busying himself with putting the kettle on, and rummaging in the cupboards for biscuits. John remains in the same position he was in when Sherlock confirmed his suspicion (
John takes it.
‘John,’ Sherlock replies in the same way he always regards him, though this time is truly a struggle. That has been his lifeline for years —
‘It’s quiet uptown,’ he says mildly, ‘I quite miss the hustle and bustle of the city. You’ll return to London, and I’ll go with you. As a team this time, Sherlock, you can’t go off and make these big decisions on your own. We’ll go, and we’ll stop Moriarty and Moran, we’ll avenge our boy. Together.’
John wakes a few hours later to a flat so still that he knows Sherlock has run off somewhere in a hurry. The bed is cold. He sighs, finds his clothes, and checks his mobile, hoping that Sherlock might have left some sort of clue for where he took off to so quickly, but only the time flashes up at him. He frowns.
‘Not now, Sherlock,’ John whispers, his voice croaky and tight, ‘I just can’t right now. I’m sorry.’ He looks absolutely devastated by this confession.
‘He was the one who found young Hamish,’ the cashier at the grocery store whispers one day  across the aisle to a pair of old women doing their shopping, ‘Held the boy in his arms as he bled out on the pavement. My cousin Billy lives in London, and was there that night. Says he’s never heard a more wretched animal cry than what came outta Dr Watson that night, the poor bloke.’
‘To the very best of times, brother mine,’ he says, and then he is gone.
Well, it’s not going to happen, that’s all there is to it. Sherlock has died three times now for John; he’s sure as hell going to make sure it wasn’t in vain.
‘If he wanted Dr Watson dead or hurt, Sherlock, he would be,’ Mycroft replies, almost gently ‘That he was able to bypass our security team is more a credit to his motivation than anything else. He is sending you a message; nothing more.’
Sherlock sighs and John imagines him leaning back, like John is, against the side of his tower whilst his feet hang over the walkway. It’s oddly peaceful to watch the fire grow; even as he knows what it will do John can’t help but stare in wonder at it. “Doesn’t mean that you can’t appreciate it.” Sherlock says and John catches the heavy meaning in his words. The fire hasn’t grown much since he had been sat here but there is no doubt in his mind that it will be huge in the next couple of days. “She doesn’t have a name yet. I usually think of something funny or something practical or a little risqué when coming up with them. But why don’t you do the honours?” Sherlock asks and John chuckles a little at his words.
John really isn't surprised at this; half of the people he had worked with over the years were strangers, hermits that live in the back end of a creek surviving on crackers and cheap beer. He doubts that this Holmes will be any different. "I think I'll be fine, Molly." He says and she smiles wide enough that he pretends not to see her blush. “He can’t be that bad, can he?”
Sherlock grins a lopsided grin at him and kisses him soundly again. “I would never leave you, Soldier Boy. We’re nearly there.” And whatever else he says, John doesn’t catch it over the sound of helicopter blades but he thinks it something like: “I love you.”
“Yeah, I just haven’t heard that name in ages.” Sherlock replies and John quirks up his eyebrow at nothing.
John sighs, making sure that Sherlock can hear him when he does and grabs his pack, heaving it onto his back alongside his map and compass. “Fine.”
“Sherlock.” Is all he can bring himself to say.
John tightens his grip on the umbrella and makes a noise. “And you remember, at your graveside, you remember when I told you that I owed you everything?” If Sherlock remembers correctly, he had said something else entirely by John clearly has a point and Sherlock doesn’t want to dance around it any longer. “Do you know why that is, Sherlock?”
“I was supposed to remember details?” I feigned ignorance.
Watson set the knife down before accepting the book. The implied Of course went unsaid.
“I...” John started and felt his face flush red. He started again. “I didn’t find you for a shag.”
Watson continued as he planned and tried to ignore Holmes’ offer, but his curiosity got the better of him. He organized his notes, donned his light weatherproof jacket, and went out. Holmes was not visible from the door and Watson hugged his jacket tighter before walking down the path by the vegetable garden beds. He quickly inspected the first, which was growing wonderfully, and moved to stand by the radish bed.
The cottage was rich with the smell of roasting beef, onions and, what, Watson presumed, was thyme. Watson checked on the meat pie that their housekeeper had brought over to make sure that it was cooking properly.
“It is late,” said Holmes, “and you are tired. Get some sleep. I am perfectly capable of tending to my hand.”
“I think that goes without saying that I do.”
“I am a doctor. I can take care of myself,” snapped Watson.
“Fifteen across is Sophism,” Sherlock blurted.
"If I weren't doing what I'm doing today... I'd be traveling around the world on the back of a motorcycle." Donna Karan
“Of course,” said Watson and moved to search for his nightshirt. “We are, after all, obstinate old men who are firmly settled in our patterns and habits.”
John woke when Sherlock asking him about his dreams.
Not wanting the letters to get damp, Watson tucked them under his jacket and into his waistcoat as he walked back through the drizzling rain. He took another path around the other side of the cottage and jumped into a defensive position when a brown streak sprang down the path before freezing in front of a bush. Watson and the rabbit stood motionless, staring eachother down. The rabbit kept its ears pointed at Watson; its body coiled and ready to leap away if the human drew too close. Watson breathed out slowly and flexed his hands, reminding himself that it was only rabbit.
*****
Today he found himself by a lazy river sitting in the grass along the banks smoking the last cigarette in his pack. The silly Sherlock ran his fingers through the grass and pulled. Some blades came away from the ground and he wiped them off. Packing up was quick, and he retraced his steps up the dirt path.
“Splendid.” He clapped his hands together, “And I will leave you to your readings.”
Watson left the cottage carrying seed packets in one hand and the garden diary in the other. In the garden diary, Watson had copied their plans for the plot. The detailed plan was perhaps a little excessive considering it was just for radishes, but he would still follow it.
He brushed that thought aside and gathered enough physical bullheadedness to push through. The bottoms of his trousers became wet as he trudged through the damp grass. At the first garden bed, he noted that the gate was properly fastened, and no damage had occurred. His garden was safe. He moved to the next bed where Holmes’ Least Awful Radish Experiment was growing nicely. The radish leaves were barely the width of his hand and a drop of moisture decorated each point of their leaves. Thankful that there were still radishes to admire, Watson turned his attention to inspect the gate and found that this too was fastened as it should be. This garden was also safe.
He gingerly scooted out from under the bike. He sat undignified in the dirt and took stock of his body. His elbow smarted where it landed. There were dirty scratches on his wrist where the jacked and gloves parted to give the road access to his skin. He moved his leg and a jolt of pain welcomed his movement. His jeans were torn slightly. But, he was ok.
Harvest: m
“You’ll work it out,” Watson said taking his hand. “You’re a very capable inspector.”
He hit the deck.
Rating: PG
Watson settling in to start reviewing patient paperwork when a loud “Wach wach” from the window startled him. He saw a huge green frog crawling up the outside of the window. The last thing he needed was some frog croaking away fraying the nerves of him and his sick patients. He reached through the window to dislodge the frog, but it attached to his arm and held fast.
The walk to the cottage was a blur. In the cottage, Watson gently deposited Holmes on the couch and gave him strict instructions not to move. He immediately retrieved his bag from upstairs, followed by a blanket and pillow from another room. Before descending, he reminded himself to keep calm. He breathed in and out slowly and repeated the breaths before tending to Holmes again.
In the changing room, John strips off his jeans, leaving on the skin-tight leotard and shirt. This somehow feels wrong. The lady he called from the academy suggested that he should wear this to his first lesion. Purchasing the leggings (and dance belt), even with the anonymity of online, still felt awkward. He feels exposed and the urge to cover himself is overwhelming.
“Hmm, are we?” said Holmes.
Watson smiled as it confirmed his theory. “Is there any other vegetable that should join the radishes?”
“OK, ok, I won’t harvest extra radishes for you. I’ll also check the fence, hopefully it will continue to deter the rabbits.”
“Dreams?”
Startled, Sherlock quickly sucked in a breath. “I thought I deleted it.  Well, most of it. I miss filed... this bike. It was a distraction. A big sticking it to Mycroft.” With a sudden movement, Sherlock dropped the canvas and twirled in place. “It should be here.”
“They get people talking.”
On delivery day, Sherlock leaned against the shed towing the gravel in the driveway and smoking. The bike was to be delivered sometime during a four-hour window today. They were already an hour and a half late. Sherlock scowled at his watch as if it was the watches' fault for the late delivery. The watch continued its cheery ticking. Sherlock considered tossing it across the lawn.
“Good heavens, no!” said Holmes looking appalled. “Each time she comes over she keeps sighing and making significant looks at you. She does not need any more encouragement.”
He did not expect after sending off Rosie with Sherlock’s parents for impromptu trip to get ice cream to see
“Good.”
With trembling hands, I gently pulled the black leather at each of his fingertips and the tingling began again in my fingertips. I was becoming addicted to the feeling and wanted more.
He had noticed the small weeds in the garden beds during his check this morning, much to his dismay. The weeds were starting to pop up quicker now that it was warming up. Watson took pride in his nearly weed-less garden, and knew he needed to remove them quickly.
“Perhaps they will strike after the hottest part of the day? Maybe in cool night?”
The creak of a door slowly permeated his blissful cloud. Then came a familiar tapping sound. Mycroft. Unless another one walked with that gait with the accompanying tap from an umbrella, it could be no other. A shadow settled over him and its owner sat next to him.
“Will that be returning to the kitchen or will I find it tucked in by the radish leaves?”
“You can’t.” Watson’s talent was forming bridges from the visible to the spirit world. Thoughts could be exchanged between worlds, but beings shouldn’t - one could easily lose their way and never come back.
Watson considered this as stood by the doorway and watched Holmes smooth out the soil with a hoe. Knocking his gloves against his trousers, Watson chuckled as his realization fell into place. He slowly moved from the doorway and walked down to join Holmes.
Oh, if she knew what he had planned.
John hugged Sherlock’s waist tight as they took a sharp turn. The tug in his belly made the adrenaline spike and flow through his veins. Every smell and sound was more. More vivid. More intense. More encompassing. He craved more. It was addicting. It was the same feeling he got when chasing Sherlock through the London streets after some criminal. John felt alive. He felt close to Sherlock in a way that was rare after cohabitating and co-parenting changed most of their lives. Maybe they could have this.
Holmes smirked and added playfully, “I wouldn’t want to distract myself.” Holmes shifted to a more academic mien and took a bite of the radish and immediately grimaced. He slowly chewed and swallowed. “Well, that one is dreadful and tastes of dirt.”
Watson lowered his glass and turned it around in his hands. “I did. I also mentioned that we could acquire fruit trees-”
“I see you have been in the shed,” said Holmes carefully.
Watson snorted, “that is an understatement-“
Of course, the real reason why Mycroft had come home today.

“Such as?”
“That is no matter as I can leave the message with you. Tell Mr Holmes to discontinue his investigation.”
“You did. Completely with a wobbly re-enactment with a spoon standing in for the dagger.”
He turned to face the rest of the store and the other motorcycles in perfect rows. He walked down the row and hoped to escape the shop assistant. The annoying man busied himself by chatting with another customer who just entered the shop.
Holmes swallowed and then shook his head. “My dear Watson, you are mistaken. My plan was to find a radish that I liked, not turn you off to a vegetable you clearly enjoy.”
“How did you not eat it? I grew two crops of them last year and added the few that survived with the other pitiful greens.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Mrs Lloyd scrunched her eyebrows together. “Besides just putting them on salads?”
Holmes shyly said, “I’m back.”
John rubs the back of his neck, even more uncomfortable now that he has been called out as a newbie. “Yah, that obvious?”
“Well, better safe than sorry,” said Watson to the gate. He stepped forward to pat the gate and paused with his hand extended. He spied a hand trowel laying near a row of immature radishes covered in the morning dew. That was rather forgetful of him, but he reasoned that he was distracted yesterday and maybe that was what bothering him enough to pull him away from his breakfast. He unlocked the gate and retrieved the hand trowel. In the process, he dislodged the droplets thus getting his hands wet. He frowned at the moisture and wiped it off on the leg of his trousers as they were already wet.
Germination: n
I glared at him over my yesterday’s newsprint fan. Warm was an understatement. It was shaping up to be the hottest day of the hottest week of the year. I was convinced his excited movements were adding to the oppressive heat in our rooms. I am not unaccustomed to warm temperatures, but today was testing my limits. I slept poorly due to constantly overheating in my stuffy room. When exhaustion had finally overcome me, Basil had scratched on his violin.
“Quite.”
Holmes rolled back, releasing Watson’s hand. “And sometimes they do not. You still dislike my brand of tobacco and prefer your own.”
She sat down beside him, tucking his blanket closer around him. “Sure, Johnny. This one ok?”
"No," he said with a twinkle in his eyes. "I have been reliably told that I am to keep to my bees."
A thud came from the library, followed by the flip of pages, a grumble, and another thud. Watson looked up from his desk and saw the shadow of Holmes picking up another book. Holmes had been at it for most of the morning. He seemed determined to make up for the day he lost resting due to his encounter with the jellyfish and his fit of energy centred in on the library. At first, Watson was happy that Holmes would most likely be inactive and reading in a chair which would let him recover further. As time dragged on, he realized that Holmes was not resting but getting more energetic as he searched through the library.
“Yes, thank you.” Watson took the letters out of his pocket and began sorting them. “Most of these are bills. Oh, you have a letter from your bee friend.” He set the letters aside and walked over to Holmes who passed a loaf of bread to him before Holmes continued searching the cabinets for what would probably be plates. “I saw that rabbit.”
He tried to delete the bike.
Holmes shook his head. “I am fine.”
“Didn’t really decide,” says John, tucking his hands behind his back not knowing what else to do with them. “I won free classes from a trivia night.”
Holmes glanced down before setting off for the garden bed.
5. Flight
A knock turned Holmes’ attention to the door. After the second knock, Holmes warmly welcomed Stackhurst into their cottage.
John ignored the little voice in his head reminding him the crash statistics of motorcycle riders. He was a doctor; he knew the facts. Yet, he wanted his own bike. The thought of his own bike made him giddy. Yes, they should have this.
“No. This place will be fine,” Holmes had said slowly. “As a place to retire to.”
He dropped to his knees and cried, “Holmes!”
Watson tossed Holmes’ nightshirt at him. “I will make tea, but it will stay on the table. After planting the radish seeds for your experiment, I am going to head down to the shore and see what has been washed up. I should have time before the plant sale. You are welcome join if you would like.“
After another round of whatever card game they were playing, Stackhurst tried to point his finger at Watson. “Mrs Lloyd, that is her name, has sights and they are good ones. Her sights on you, lucky man.” Stackhurst paused and stared longingly into his cup before continuing. “And whatever she has her beautiful sights on, she gets. She’s a fine, persistent woman.  Oh, the lucky Doctor will be married off this Tuesday.” Stackhurst lifted his glass towards Watson in some sort of solute. He turned to Holmes and tried to sober up a bit. “As for you, you’d best be looking for a new roommate soon, Mr Holmes. One of the professors I was telling you about would be an excellent companion for you. Let me tell you more about him.”
“It was your complicated design if I recall,” Watson mumbled against the finger on his lips.
“Wonderful, your class will start soon.” She shows him where to place his belongings and where to wait for his class to begin.
He smiled.
“I remember bringing in the jars but not taking out the glass.”
Watson tried to suppress a smile. Holmes
With that he took his tea cup and went over to the chair by the fire to warm up leaving Watson with the plans.
Sherlock looked at her blankly before his brain jumpstarted: the internship.
John’s other hand roamed down Sherlock’s side, caressing the sensitive area drawing out a shiver from Sherlock. He tugged at the shirt to release the tails from the trousers seeking the skin below. Sherlock moaned appreciatively as John found skin and roamed up his back. John lost himself in sensations of the warmth of his partners body and the heady smells of Sherlock combined with the dusty odours of the shed.
“And?”
Watson pulled up one of the radishes. Clumps of dirt held on to the bright red globe and he gently brushed it off. He offered the radish to Holmes, who began inspecting the vegetable.
7. Sophism
This time I chanced a look at Holmes. He kept his focus on some distant point and remained silent.
Next, Watson considered the side of the plot. He bit the inside of is cheek and tapped the end of the pencil against his lip. He thought that it seemed a waste to devote all of it to a radish experiment. If the fence did keep away the rabbits, then he would be eating radishes for weeks at every meal. Their housekeeper would be here tomorrow, maybe she knew other ways to prepare radishes other than on a salad. Watson added a note to his list of things to mention to the housekeeper, Mrs Glydon. Then again, maybe he could use some of the plot for another vegetable.
“The test of the machine is the satisfaction it gives you. There isn't any other test. If the machine produces tranquillity, it's right.”
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock glared up at the red-headed rider. “It’s fine.”
He said yes and went to his room. His favorite car was on his bed and he sat down to play with it when he heard her approach. ”Mummy, can you read me a story?”
"Go yourself." Sherlock finished his cigarette and tossed it in a flower pot.
“The act or process of gathering in a crop.”
Watson drank the water. After attending to his other needs, he slowly got dressed and decided against shaving that morning. He descended the stairs to the kitchen area.
“While it is ultimately up to him, I am sure that we’d be delighted to,” answered Watson quickly.
Holmes was a heavy weight against his side and was getting heavier as they slowly walked up the rocky trail. Watson knew that it was taking effort for Holmes to keep from crying out with pain and his breathing became more laboured as they slowly picked their way around the more trecherous rocks. Watson’s body was aching, but he pushed through it. He could see the top of the cliffs, and he knew, not to the exact step, how long it would take to get home.
To anyone else, Holmes would have looked as he always had; his face the cold mask he held up to the world, but polite in the company of others. To Watson, he saw the tension increase in his face and the subtle tightening of his expression that shouted his agitation.
“Do you remember when we got them?”
“Finished?”
"Twenty-one," Sherlock lied smoothly.
“I wish you to read the story first to weigh its literary merit before I bias you towards the original mystery.”
Holmes kept silent and returned to his attention to the area of untilled earth.
Watson gave his companion a reassuring smile. “We could give them away. I’m sure a neighbour would appreciate them. Maybe Mrs Lloyd might like some.”
Another thump further disturbed Watson. He placed the pen down and rose from his chair. The library was in a separate room across from the sitting room and the door was wide open. He leaned against the doorframe taking in the disorganization of the library. Books, dislodged from their respective places on the shelves, lay in piles near an arm chair. Loose papers were scattered around the arm chair and desk.
Verse: ACD
Mycroft's face soured. Sherlock smirked. It was a low blow, but he was unconcerned.
“I can.” Holmes bent and set the glass at the edge of the radish bed to be forever lost among the leaves.
“Seven. No, there are more. I will need to count when we go inside.” Watson started rolling the radish leaf in the opposite direction and paused. “I have now realized the true purpose of this experiment.”
Holmes paid the driver as I fumbled for the key with numb fingers. We stumbled through the door and I could feel his eyes on me as we climbed the seventeen steps. Seventeen steps and one door before we were safely hidden away. We carefully removed our great coats and hung them on the pegs in the hall, all the while the tension built filling the minimal space between us and causing me to forget how to breathe. The warmth of our sitting rooms was a welcome embrace, and I had other ideas of how to rid us of the evening’s chill.
“We will not have a housekeeper when we return home,” said Watson. He stepped around a pothole in the road and took his place back at Holmes’ side. “She is not nearly as fond of you as Mrs Hudson.”
Watson brought the frog inside and sighed. “I do not treat frogs, little one. Off you go.”
“What?” Holmes crinkled his forehead briefly before immediately waving his hand to dismiss it. “No, nothing of that sort. Here.” He thrust the book in Watson’s hand tapping on page filled with illustrations of jellyfish. Their orange and brown tentacles swirled around the page and the illustrator had taken great care to depict the delicate nature of these creatures - they looked disarmingly beautiful.
John’s attention snaps back to the present. He nods and then tries to make his way off the hoop.
“You do realize that we are retired and can slow the pace a bit?” said Watson taking one of the sets from Holmes.
Watson thought the precise arrangement of each radish variety on the plate was rather pretty. Pure white cylindrical radishes were arranged in neat rows and were a striking contrast to an arranged cluster of black globes. The smooth red orbs were organized by descending size above tapered cylinders with bright pink tops and white bottoms. The small turnip shaped were aligned next to one of the longest varieties they had planted. The other varieties with their different hues of reds and whites filled in the rest of the space. In his opinion, it was one of the prettier displays of channelled procrastination to avoid the task at hand.
The light from the shed reminded him of the colloid solutions he made in his chemistry lab. Sherlock opened the shed door wide noting the dampness on the cool metal handle. He was greeted by that ubiquitous damp shed smell and the scent of petrol. That smell he associated with freedom and adrenaline was enough of an anchor he could grasp to pull him out of his mind.
1. Dreams
He returned a sad smile. “That is good to hear.”
John found the bike.
“Long enough.”
“My plan? My plan is to retire here.” Holmes stood by Watson and lifted his face. Watson yielded and brought his face up to Holmes’ searching gaze. Holmes then adding softly, “With you, if you will continue to have me.”
“Holmes?” Watson touched his shoulder. Holmes looked as if he just realized Watson was there.
“I’ve already informed the housekeeper that we are expecting company.”
Holmes took notice of something outside the window and suddenly got up. “Ah, the postman has arrived. I’ll retrieve our mail and we can continue the romanization of my works when I return.”
"When did you -"
“Holmes, that is, she is... concerned over the level of detail in your instructions. Is it necessary to cut each piece to exactly the same length? To time within the second for how long something is in the oven? To accurately weigh each ingredient?”
“Are you ready?” came his mother’s voice from down stairs.
“Most likely. It might alter the results. Reproducibility is one of the central foundations in scientific testing.”

“You bloody idiot!” Watson said turning Holmes over. Light from the lamppost illuminated the growing pool of blood.
Prompt: Include some meteorological elements.
“That is fine, I will still read it.”
Watson chuckled and twisted to his side to rub his hand over Holmes’ back.
Realizing this was not something he would win, Watson asked about the results of his other, less destructive experiments with honey. Holmes enthusiastically described his results of analysing the different sugars in his honey samples. One of his errands today was to send a letter to a contact in America to request another protocol and sample of their honey.
. That possessive thought repeated in his head in time with his heartbeat. Mine. Mine. Mine.
Watson snaked his arms around Holmes’ waist and moved them slowly over the warm, softened flesh of his belly. There are some things that are inevitable with age. Holmes laced his fingers with Watson. They were cool compared to Watson’s bed-warmed skin. He wondered how long Holmes had been awake for his fingers to get so cold. Watson pressed in close to share his warmth. He switched their positions to warm Holmes’ hand in the cocoon of warmth between his palm and Holmes’ middle. Satisfied with their new position, Watson peered over the white nightshirt clad shoulder.

“They are award winning,” she said and gave Watson a wink. “How did you manage to not try them? You were at the plant sale last year.”
The frog shook his head and… smiled? Was it possible for a frog to smile? It lifted its froggy leg to its mouth and gently cleared his throat. “Good morning, Watson. Would you throw an old friend out the window so soon after reacquainting?”
The bright light from the shop startled him and he looked up. In the window was a brilliant yellow sports bike. Sherlock smirked and turned to the nearest CCTV camera that had been tracking his progress down the street. He took one last drag of his cigarette, tossed it and ground it into the brick with his heel. He flipped off the camera and entered the shop.
The wardrobe appeared to be perfect normally. The sort that was found in almost all old houses. Mrs Hudson explained that it had been in 221B Baker Street long before she arrived.
“Off you go. There is plenty for you eat away from my garden. No need to be here.” The rabbit’s nose twitched. Watson stepped forward and flapped his arms. “Go on, shoo.” The rabbit reached the end of its bravery and dashed into the bush. Watson returned his arms to his side. A letter had fallen on the ground and he bent to retrieve it before continuing his walk around the house.
He sat up and lit a cigarette. Holmes handed it to me and I took a draw before handing it back. I settled on my side and slowly traced concentric circles on his chest. He smoked in silence, then flicked the cigarette into the grate.
The wound required stitching, and I needed to retrieve my supplies from my bag. The sensation decreased when I moved away from Holmes to prepare the needle and thread. I wondered if what I felt was real.
“Good job,” John said, and kissed her forehead.
“Ah, Mr Holmes, you are up to your tricks again.” He wagged a finger at Holmes as he took off his hat and coat. Holmes took them and his walking stick. Stackhurst, who kept his bag, greeted Watson with a smile and a firm handshake.
I groaned and rolled over. If that were the case, I would need to apologize for my actions for it is reprehensible to bond without consent.
Removal of seedlings or plant tissue.
“I grew it last year.”
“Ok, next one.”
A familiar voice cut through his confusion and fog. “I’m sorry, my boy, I did not mean to disturb you. I only shut the window as I was getting cold.”
Holmes re-opened the package and took out one radish. He turned the vegetable in his fingers, inspecting it at every angle before putting it in his mouth. He chewed, stopped, and chewed again. Watson half expected the offending root to be spat upon the ground, instead he sat in shock as the root was swallowed. “I like this one.”
Holmes propped himself up on his elbows and laughed. “You have me have disadvantaged in dress, my good man.”
John knew it wasn’t, that it was in the past. Maybe one day he could leave that guilt behind.
“I could have told you that before you spent days toiling on it. He only acted strangely before seeing a doctor about his fear of monkeys - hardly an interesting tale.”
1. pour or sprinkle water over (a plant or an area of ground), typically to encourage plant growth.
He smiled, more like smirked, and I moved to reclaim his mouth. I shifted my position and put thigh between his leg which allowed me greater freedom to press into him. My efforts were rewarded with a groan when I felt that his state was similar to mine.
John’s arms begin to burn and his wounded shoulder protests a little more, but this feeling is familiar and good. He listens to the breathing and grunts from the other students.
“Wrecked, debauched,” said Holmes into my skin as he slowly kissed his way up my torso and hovered just above my face.
John nodded, and Sherlock continued. “I like ships - pirate ships - and the phenomenon intrigued me.”
“Now to business. As of now your holiday is officially over. You will return and dress appropriately. You will start the internship in London that your new employers were gracious enough to hold for you.”
“Oh, none of that. Now,” Holmes playfully scolded before returned to the mock professorial tone he used before, “what have you observed about the glasses?”
To someone who did not know Holmes well, he would have appeared perfectly personable and charming. But, Watson knew Holmes was still upset and hiding it with the expected politeness of an English gentleman. During their lively conversations, they ate their fill of the meal and drank the bottle Watson had opened. That bottle was soon finished and another was opened.
After turning us around, I nudged him towards the bed, and he fell backwards into it.
The other motorcycle slowed and came to a stop just short of where he was sitting on the ground feeling sorry for himself. The rider got off his huge touring bike and took of his helmet to reveal shocking red hair. He lumbered over, clearly, he had been on his bike for a while. He stood over Sherlock.
He was about to leave the shop, confident that he had accomplished his mission of annoying his brother when he saw it. At the end of the row, separate from the others, the black and chrome called him; pulled him towards it.
Done! I’ll be celebrating with cake later.
Watson blinked and waiting for ‘except’ that never came. “You what?”
He considered eating the breakfast set before him, but his already queasy stomach from his over indulgence the night before had clenched into a knot further diminishing the desire to eat. Yet, he hated the idea of wasting food. He picked up his spoon and slowly scooped the congealed egg away from its shell. His stomach chose that moment to clench; instead, he tried a cold piece of toast. He begrudgingly ate it as his stomach complained with every bite. He washed the toast down with lukewarm tea.

“It would have, but then we would have been deprived of this invigorating walk on a rather pleasant day. I much prefer this type of exercise to the running around thinking our house was burning down type.
I fetched my medical bag relieved that he was willing. He watched as I exchanged my black leather gloves for thin rubber gloves. It was standard procedure to wear surgical gloves during an examination to reduce the chance of initiating a bond. A doctor’s purpose in that moment was to heal, not to find a new soul bond.
“But the fish was stuffed with radishes,” said Watson. “Each meal had radishes. Raw radishes plain, raw radishes with cheese or bread or an herb.”
“I will plant another in the fall.” Watson pulled out a pencil and paper, which he had gotten in the habit of carrying around and never stopped. “Why don’t we sketch out a plan together?”
“Lunch?” Watson asked extending the crook of his arm. The tension in Holmes’ body released a little and his expression softened a bit. Holmes gave a brief smile at his friend before he took the offered arm.
“The murders are localized, but the timing is erratic.”
What’s your favorite meteorological phenomenon?

Holmes placed another book, which had been sitting on the top of a pile, face up, and tapped on a paragraph. “This naturalist writes of a little over seven foot one washing up in America. I encountered a small one by comparison.”
Those lips - that deliver deductions that never cease to amaze me, that show his mirth, that I can kiss with mine - were wrapped around my prick. His tongue swirled and teased across the head as I moaned and fought the desire to thrust into the wet heat of his mouth. He bobbed his head and brought his other hand to my work my shaft. I gripped his hair tight to tether myself as pleasure built.
Dr Watson had acted strangely during that meeting.  His normally careful dress was less so. He seemed more distracted than usual, often not hearing questions directly asked of him. He accidentally spilled tea down his outfit and over her perfectly embroidered table cloth. He grimaced after tasting her strawberry scones. Who could grimace at the perfection of her strawberry scones? They are, well, perfection and award winning and the best he’d ever tasted. That grimace had changed the mood to stiff over-politeness which continued until Dr Watson took his early leave.
“No, not entirely exact. Fuckable might be more exact.” There is something about vulgarity falling from his lips that fills me with heat. I rolled us over and reluctantly got out of bed to retrieve the pot on the makeup table before returning to Holmes.
He opened the letter and began mumbling selections aloud to no one in particular. “Sorry for not seeing you at the plant sale… Very busy… Could not get away. We sold out of everything, which is rather wonderful.” Watson stopped reading aloud as he quickly skimmed the rest of the letter, seeing that she had sent him multiple radish recipes and promises of more. The end of the letter should not have surprised him, but he swore anyway - Mrs Lloyd had invited him over for tea.
Before convincing himself not to, Watson fished out another from the bowl and took a bite. He happily chewed and said, “still tastes good to me.”
Holmes is not practicing modern laboratory safety techniques. It makes me twitchy writing it this way, but these were standard for the time and chemists died or were maimed in horrible ways. Nowadays, ventilation is essential and mouth pipetting, eating/drinking, and smoking in the labs are banned. So, don’t do it! Also, wear those closed toed shoes, for Pete’s sake!

“Well Watson, as I am unlikely to convince you otherwise when your mind is set upon an action, I will submit to your experienced care.”
Watson had smiled up at Holmes. Holmes smiled down at Watson and extended a hand. He accepted it. “Your garden is fighting back, my old boy.”

“That’s not the point. These are ice breaking questions.”
Something inside him unwound and he relaxed; the little nagging anxiety silenced till next season. Life had chosen to express its dramatic nature and the nagging thought of checking the garden was a small voice he had mostly ignored. There was a certain faith you had to take when planting a seed, as Watson was well aware. The plants would grow, and no amount of worrying or fretting on his part would make them grow faster. It was a simple matter of patience and waiting. He gave the little seedlings a smile before heading down the path to look for Holmes.
“I was thinking, given the success of our current signal, that perhaps additional signals would be appropriate.”
Holmes slid further down the door and groaned.
“We have had other cases where an animal was the killer, but I wouldn’t consider some of those animals mundane. Which case did you alter?”
“Watson,” Holmes said in a whisper.
“Off,” John panted and tugged at the belt. “These off now.”
I lay in my bed unable to sleep. I was convinced the sensation was real and I had begun to form a soul bond with Holmes. The bond must be strong for us to initiate bonding in an unconventional way.
“The society that Mrs Lloyd belongs to made us baskets when we first arrived. House warming gifts is what they called it, or a chance to snoop on their new famous neighbours. The glasses were from Mrs Lloyd. At that time, she did not perfume her letters to you.”

Prompt: Add a non-English phrase.
Sherlock growled out through clenched teeth, “I do not need to be retrieved like some lost trinket.”
“— and subduing the garden hose, it would be discourteous of me not see this through to the conclusion.” Pleased with his decision, Holmes removed his finger and hooked his thumb in a pocket of his waistcoat.
Some of the tension eases when Greg pulls away, and John starts feeling more relaxed in his new surroundings. The class begins with warming up and stretching. John tries not to smile as Greg groans when trying to stretch.
“Perhaps,” said Watson heading back to the door. “But, perhaps you might find that you enjoy them.”
Holmes stirred. He slowly opened his eyes, taking time reorienting himself.
Lestrade is frustrated with his case.
Sherlock’s hand skitters trying to find purchase on the smooth surface of the gas tank. John flattens the hand against the tank feeling the contrast of the hot flesh against the cool metal. Sherlock’s hips continued to squirm under John’s other hand. John pulled back and looked up to find Sherlock panting and a red flush across his cheeks. John loved the sight and taking Sherlock apart.
“I will leave either way. It is your choice if I have the appropriate supplies.”
Holmes harrumphed. “Give then to Stackhurst. He can present them to her as a bouquet of his undying affection.”
Once the motorcycle was safely off the trailer, the driver handed him the keys from his pocket. Sherlock clutched the warm keys in his hand and gazed in wonder at the bike. It was here.
The rest of her conversation died away as he bounded upstairs and into the bathroom. He felt grimy from roasting in his leathers and wanted to clean up. He took a minimal shower and did not linger - he had work to do.
“I’d like you to rest for a little while. We should… We should move you upstairs. It will be more comfortable.”
Holmes glared at him. “These things have a process.”
What had he gotten himself into? John wonders as he averts his gaze from the floor to ceiling mirror covering the opposite wall. Instead, he focuses on the dozen or so black hoops attached to the ceiling. They remind John of an adult sized hula hoop, but much thicker. One hoop sways gently as a female student moves it absentmindedly while taking to another student. In another room attached to the one he is in, he is mesmerized by blue fabric hanging from the ceiling. He is not entirely sure of their purpose or why that room is much taller than the one he is in.
The sun had set and Watson settled in on the settee with a novel. He heard scratching of a chair against floorboard and the distinct creaking of another occupant moving about upstairs. Holmes hummed an upbeat tune, that Watson did not recognize, as he quickly descended. He was radiating with energy and excitement. Holmes traversed the room in a few steps, stood by Watson, and smiled before bending down and kissing him. The excess energy radiating from Holmes seemed to be transferred through the kiss and left Watson a little breathless.
Watson digested this bit of information as they walked. A car drove pass and they waved while the driver honked at them as he passed.
“Holmes,” Watson said quietly. Holmes was hunched over his table and did not respond. “There is dinner downstairs if you would like it. I covered your plate with a cloth.” Holmes remained motionless. “Goodnight, Holmes. And, I’m sorry for this morning.”
I heard a knock on my door and roused myself to answer it. Holmes was there. Fate had made my decision for me.
Watson sipped his ale and remembered he needed to update Holmes about the garden plans. “About the radish garden, I am going to replace one of the varieties you selected. I purchased a new one today which I haven’t tried yet.”
“Did I miss a telegram or letter? I did not know you were still taking cases.”
Smiling up at Holmes, Watson said, “I say, things must be going well?”
Leaning on the garden hoe, Holmes met Watson’s gaze. “I wasn’t planning on building that one.”
We sealed our agreement with a heated kiss.
They sat there breathing a bit before they made eye contact. John giggled and Sherlock followed. They stood up and began righting themselves.
After frigid afternoon, I settled by the fire in our rooms in Baker Street to let the warmth drive the chill from my bones. I had just picked up my novel when Holmes tossed his book in disgust.
Holmes returned and pressed a glass of water in Watson’s hand and stood surveying their work. The sun was suddenly covered by a cloud and a cool breeze caused Watson to shiver briefly.
Hanging upside down with the hoop tucked behind his knees, John notices a man warming up by the silks. His dark curls are pooled across his leg as he folds himself in half for a stretch. John’s mind goes blank and he blames it on hanging upside down for the first time in over a decade.
It was not to say that I was unattracted to Holmes. No, the very opposite was true. I felt drawn to his every action. Holmes often went about the house without gloves, where I religiously wore mine. I was mesmerized by the skilful use of his hands when he played his violin or delicately held a test tube. Watching his uncovered hands was shockingly intimate. It was usually saved for when you were with your soul bond partner.
“Wonderful! I have just come from a planning meeting and I am reminding all I know to come to the sale. The Plant Society is donating a portion of the proceeds to the veteran fund.”
“And it should be now. Taste it.”
“Would you permit me the same liberty?”
“Ok, fine. Yes. I’ll start. Mine is tornadoes. Not the little ones we have here, but the massive ones they get in the US. I’d watch specials of them on TV.”
Watson produced a small packet of parchment paper and gave it to Holmes. He opened it and pulled out a red and white radish. The miniature radish that was thinner than his pinky finger.
“An admirer of Mr Holmes.” The stranger sat down. He had dark hair and a well-tended moustache. His sharp eyes studied Watson and he refused to squirm.
The wounds from the jellyfish did not react further and healed quickly over the next few days. To Watson’s relief, life slipped back into the comfortable normalcy of errands, gardening, and apiary work. Although Holmes spent more time at his desk writing something that Watson assumed was related to his honey experiments.

“Yes, she did help out nicely. Those were almost palatable, but I wouldn’t make a habit of eating them.”
Watson opened his mouth to protest, but Holmes gently pressed his finger to Watson’s lips and continued, “But knowing how much you have toiled in over-complicating my simple bed design—“

“Yah, but their raw power is mind boggling.” John said. He sipped his tea and gestured to Sherlock.
Seeds, of many things, are planted.
“-Shepherds delight, or so the saying goes.”
Johns mind immediately flashed a sight of a skin-tight leather trousers clad Sherlock straddling that gorgeous machine. He knew he was smiling like an idiot.
“But you took the manuscript and left without a word.”
Watson suppressed a giggle.
Verse: BBC
“That will have to wait until I finish analysing the data and write it up.” Watson tried to stifle his disappointment, but Holmes caught it anyway. “You are quite mistaken about the honey manuscript, this one is… more to your taste.”
