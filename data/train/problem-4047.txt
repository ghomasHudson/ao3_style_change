Cas starts to think. Maybe he put it on the table unbalance. Maybe that's why it has fallen. He let out a little laugh.
"Oh no, not at all" Castiel quickly answered ignoring Dean's puppy eyes. God Castiel can't stop blushing around Dean.
Fuck, how domestic is that? With that thought, Dean Choked his bite full of pie and started to coughing, starlet everyone.
“Hold on babe, I’m gonna give it to you” Dean lifts Cas’s legs and settles between his legs. Cas wraps his legs around Dean. Then quickly Dean applies some lube on his own cock and stork it few times before lines himself up and rubs his cock over Cas’s well-opened hole.
"I'm'nt drunken you fucker, just come with me Nd tell Coach what've U'done for last few weeks and clear ma'name" He groaned.
"Dean, man c'mon that's not what I mean, you know about the whole situation, I mean Cas wouldn't be..." Sam started but cut off by his very angry big brother.
"Sam..... It's okay baby just let it go. You are here now, and I'm also getting better, and you know Dean was not okay in that time, he was so upset Sam. That's why he forgot about you. So now please stop fighting boys, it's been three days now, okay?" Mary stated.
"God Dean please don't say stuff like that" Castiel wanted to hide right now because he felt so much shy but also he felt happy. Dean couldn't take his eyes from this beautiful man in front of him. The man who took his whole heart.
"Um, yeah she must have forgotten that, but she mentioned that how he slapped your ass like he is ready to mount you just right there," Gabe said smirking and Cas's whole face goes completely red.
Sam was reading the text message loud to hear Dean because Dean was impatient. But Next second he interrupted Sam.
Castiel groaned when Dean found that is too cute and almost snorted, but he didn't want to make him more upset or angry so he shut his lips to a thin line as hold his laughter.
"Yeah? Is that so? Then how about your super rudeness that you show me earlier? Oh, what did you say? Oh right. You said, "you took that Eggnog for a huge vegan, nerd who suppose to stay in his home alone, without giving that much of trouble to you" Right? That's how you talked about me. Remember, so obviously, you hated me for coming over. But you know what, I also didn't want to come, I never wanted that. But I came because of my brother and because of the kindness of Sam, otherwise, I will be in my apartment just like you said, ALONE"
Dean was impatient to know about Castiel. He knew he will not get from Castiel, so Dean tried his best shot.
"Yo assholes W'dare you huh?" Dean groaned at the boys who were shivering with fear and begging for forgiveness. His voice was tipsy but he didn't gave a damn about it for a bit.
"Cas I'm not angry that you punch me, but please don't say we are not true mates. Just tell me, don't you feel that we are soul mates? We are true mates?, Cas your scent, it's everything to me, it's remembering me home, my favorite flower, it remembering all of my favorite things, you are everything, you make me feel happy all the time Cas. That because I'm your Alpha Cas" Dean's voice came like a pleading but Cas was seeing red when he pushes Dean to the wall again.
"Dude, you said that you are going to that girl's house," Sam said shoving his hands in the air like a complaint.
“Soon love. I will give you what you want, but I’m not gonna hurt you babe. it's been a while we did this so I'm gonna open you nice and loose first"
"Okay I'm not going away, now please leave my hands" Castiel murmured and Dean gave him a genuine smile this time. And slowly gave a squeeze to his hands before letting go of them. Castiel quickly pulled them into him and put them on his lap afraid Dean will catch them again. Dean chuckled at that action.
Sam rolled his eye "Okay mom when did you start the detective job, mom I think you have hit your head that day, and now you think that you are the Sherlock Holmes, aren't you?" Sam said chuckling at his Mom.
"Cas I'm really sorry, let me tell you what happened. I drank all of your vegan eggnogs which Sam had brought yesterday and he was pissed. So I had to go out to bring some more. And you also know that it's snowing heavily outside since morning. So I just pissed off because of that, I didn't upset with you or hated you Cas, I swear. And all are my faults. I'm really sorry for hurting your feelings"
Finally, Alfie said bye to him when he was going to his own class and Cas opened his locker to grab his books. The door of his locker was on his left side. And suddenly a knock came out of it as Cas almost jumped catching his chest. He felt angry as he closed the locker door.
Dean said still not turning, giving his back to Cas. It's like he knows how much Cas would be uncomfortable if he turned around.
"And this, all of these you planned and did for me, it's... It's a kinda romantic dream and you are so talented Dean, never knew you can sing and play the guitar like this" Castiel's
Castiel felt a trace of bitterness in his heart and he didn't know why. but he felt very upset. He wanted to call Gabriel and tell him to not come today because he wanted to crash on his bed and cry. But cry over what? He never liked the guy. So why his heart falling like this to the news he discovered right now.
Meg glared at Kevin this time "You know what, if you don't stop that right now I'm going to kick your ass, we have said thousands of times that it's not your fault and Castiel is alright so stop that right now"
His hand eventually touches his belly soothing there closing his eyes again. slowly he let his fingers going down towards his thighs. A little moan escapes from him as his fingers slowly touch his bushes between his legs. He normally removes his bush before his heat coming and it reminds him that he should do it again soon as his heat is due on next week.
Dean chuckled when he understood that. Cas directly looked at Dean's face the next moment, making sure not to let his gaze trail down below.
"I just messed with ya Cas" His voice was soft and Cas get some strength to lift his head by that. But he didn't say anything or didn't look at Dean's face.
"Yes Dean I understand, I don't know what to say. But I want you to know that, yes I care about you. Kinda... Lot" He said softy Dean's face lit with a beautiful smile. Both of them didn't talk for few seconds as they were in their own world.
Anyhow, actually it's sad that this year Valentine's Day came exactly the day Dean couldn't come to see him. But who cares, Castiel always thinks this Valentine's Day is a kinda stupid thing. It's good for 15 years old girls though. Not to a grown man like him. And besides, there's is no such thing as wanting a specific day for love. Love is forever, so it doesn't need a specific one Day. So Cas would always laugh and throw this concept out of the window. But God knows just like every human being Cas is also a goner for LOVE. He also craving for love, so underneath in his heart, he secretly wished if he could celebrate it with someone who is madly in love with him. Anyhow it seems like today also he can't fulfill that wish, even though finally there's a perfect man came into his life.
But right now those words Dean saying! God, why'd he even saying stuff like that, even he listen himself? wasn't that seems like almost flirting? but everyone knew that Dean Winchester will never flirt with a Gay nerd, never ever, but why'd he acting like this then?
Castiel didn't wait for Dean's reply as he grabbed his backpack with his books and then stormed off the study area without even glancing at Dean.
"Okay Mom, but please take a good rest while I'm going, I don't want you to be worried about anything right now, okay, I will come soon with that giant moose" Dean chuckled and gave a kiss on his mom's forehead.
Castiel said suddenly and when he turned around to see Dean, he found Dean had stopped his work and staring at him.
Sam chuckled a bit before waved his hand at Cas. But Dean was so upset about what happened. Cas kept rejecting him. No one reject him before. Noone dares to reject Dean Winchester. How come Cas still rejecting him like this even he openly shows his affection for him. Okay not really openly, but hey, he already held him in his arms. Cas was melted into his arms like a kitten last night. So isn't it an improvement? Even it's not happened on Dean's account, still it can be counted as a win. Dean smiled at his thoughts before Sam shoots him weird-looking glances.
"When the Doctor visit me after the surgery, I thanked him for rescuing me, but then he said I should not have to thank them, but to the boy who rescued me"
But Castiel was already decided to put a step further to see where it drives them. And he knew he really wants Dean too and he wants to believe him. He was on the edge and after what Dean did today Castiel can't help but fall for him more than before. And he guessed Dean really deserves more. But Castiel isn't fully ready yet, but he can tell Dean what he wants.
"So Dean, how did you do this all? I thought you were in your meeting. I even texted you few times" Castiel asked as he wanted to know about it.
"Son, these days The Kindness and Braveness is a very rare thing, people are so cruel. But the thing you did that day, I will never forget that son, and remember, me and my family will be there for anything for you, you can contact me anytime for anything, please remember that, okay?" She asked and Castiel just nodded. Because he knew if he talks right now he will cry.
Dean looked at him with something mix of adoration and lust. He slowly moved near to Castiel looking into his eyes. Castiel slowly put a step back and Dean didn't stop and kept moving into Castiel's personal space.
" Yeah... fuck my tight cunt! Uh, Make me scream with that big dick of yours!" Cas said and lined his clenching hole on Dean's cock, he slowly sank down as he whimpered with the feeling of the sweet ache he felt.
"Well, to be honest, this is my favorite table Cas, and this is my favorite chair," Dean said without a hesitation taping on his chair.
Lisa was giving hints to him for weeks now, flirting and bending over tables and pretending to pick up something she dropped when Dean passing by her. Yeah, she is into Dean, so be it. As soon as the last lecture end Dean walked out and started to search Lisa and her gang. It wasn't hard to find her.
"Baby your tight warmth is everything. Look how perfectly fitting we are, mmmmm fucking tightly fit. My cock never feels like this baby, this pleasure, this feeling and the warmth inside you, I can cum right now baby, shit" Dean curses and he did everything not to move his hips to push his cock further.
"Yes, Dean. You too. you look amazing and never changed besides became better" He answered but felt his cheeks getting burn a little bit, which he didn't care of course. God Dean has become so Handsome. his Beautiful green eyes which Castiel couldn't able to forget ever, are so perfect there. And the millions of beautiful freckles around his face Castiel just stared at those, barely control his freaking hand from touching those.
Dean puts him on the mattress slowly. But Cas tries to get out of bed but Dean pushes him back to bed.
"Dean, I'm not shoving you away, just give me a second, you are not gonna sleep on an empty stomach, not on my watch," Castiel said as Dean lift his head until he can see Castiel's face clearly.
Cas's heart starts to beat fast for no reason as he slowly walks downstairs. Everywhere is in the dark as there are no lights on. He sees a shadow near the window of the living room and Cas nearly jumps out but then he recognizes that It’s Dean and he sighs.
"Okay, okay Gabe, I will make it quick, but you know I don't want to put Sam in trouble. it's hard to find vegan eggnogs and it's my responsibility to bring what I want when it's come to rare than the normal tradition," He said before going out of the car and ran towards the shop.
"Hey Son, Clarence good afternoon" Mary greeted smiling with a huge happy face and Sam gave him a surprised smile and nod. Castiel was just staring at them wordlessly and surprise. Then he realized he must say something.
"I had your number from the first day I saw you Cas, but I didn't want to make you uncomfortable or push you further"
He doesn't want any other pleasure to cum right now, he was all on the edge. He gives few lazy strokes and he is ready to cum, but not inside Cas's glory, he can't do that. so he waits another few seconds and slowly pulls out his cock causing Cas to gasps.
Dean found any kind of reason to visit Sam's office at least four days a week, every time Sam gave him a shit-eating grin and teased him by calling him a lovesick puppy. But Sam never gave any sign to Castiel that he knows his brother is in love with him.
"One time on the table, the second time I'm gonna fuck you behind when you do your office paperwork" Dean demands.
“So it’s deal then okay?” Cas moved his lips to Dean’s and barely touching it but pulls out quickly, Dean’s eyes filling with love as he slowly leans to Cas but Cas put his finger on Dean’s lips.
"fuck baby, feel so good mmmm so hot, you are so gorgeous like this, all wet and tight and so hot for me.
"Castiel, will you go out with me, please? I really like you. And you are a really great guy, you are so nice and very kind hearted person, I really really like you and I really like to get to know about you more, and I want to spend some time with you with all the respects, please say yes and god please take this, this flowers for you, something beautiful for someone Beautiful" Dean smiled with him. Castiel's face got colored with a beautiful shade of red.
"No, Cas it's completely fine. we can see you guys having a brotherly moment there" Dean said smiling at him kindly.
Cas cries out but Dean doesn't care about him as suddenly Dean bent him over the couch and yanks Cas's sweatpants with one hard pull. Now Cas's bare ass is showing as Cas cries and tries to move away from Dean, tries to break through his grip. But Dean is so strong even more than before as he can't get rid of him.
Suddenly Sam's frustrated voice came as a yell, breaking the spell. And making both Dean and Cas shocked again as they looked over at door.
"God, Dean don't touch it, baby, it's too much risk, we can't go further" Even Cas wants Dean's fingers inside his pussy he can't let it happens, so he pleads.
Cas removes his rob and lets it fell down and slowly get down to the tub, but just like he guess it's cold now as he hisses at the coldness. He quickly goes under the milk once, makes sure to wash his whole body, and then the second time he goes down and comes. But before he wipes his face Suddenly there is huge water splashing sound and boom...
"Really? Well now everything is fine and we are here. Soo.." Castiel didn't complete but wait to see Dean's reaction teasingly.
"I'm going home, Mr. Winchester. And what did you mean by start this conversation?" Castiel asked tilting his head.
This is the worst thing Castiel can think about. he never wanted Mary to think about him like that no, no, no, please. He felt very sick and he wanted to throw up. And then Castiel was going to say that he wasn't a liar. But then it happened, he felt like the room spinning, and then he was on the floor. then everything went blur.
"Aww, how thoughtful of you my dear, now stop dancing around and tell me what you want this time," She said in a firm voice but smiling with Dean a bit now.
"Aww that's a really nice ring Becky I'm so happy for you," Castiel said with a genuinely happy smile. And then he had to listen to her nonstop story about her and his lover's story for almost 10 minutes before she ran out to show her ring to her next victim. Castiel signed and started his work again.
Early days, Dean only bullied him when he spotted Cas around, or when they met face to face. but now, he is following him all around and offering his help, and acting like he is a good friend. And that's the worst thing ever for Cas. So yes he is so done with Dean's new routine.
"I will tell you about that, but first of all let me tell you one thing I should have correct a long time ago Mary," Castiel said like a beg his voice is so small.
"Sam, can you put two milk cartons into the cart?" Mary asked while checking her list. She made sure to not touching anything as Sam kept asking to tell him what to pick then he will do it for her and she must not touch anything.
"See you can't even stand to say a word against the guy, you like him too Cassie, besides I guess that even your Handsome boss never pushed you to his brother, right? No pressure from him right?" Gabriel asked.
"It's totally fine Sam, don't worry, I'm totally fine" Cas barely speak through his laugh as both Mary and Sam felt relief. But the next moment all of them started to laugh and Cas explain how it happened and how he fell and how funny was that. Cas had never felt like this before, to laugh freely like this, so he feels it as much as he wanted.
"Oh my god Cas, are you okay?" Mary asked quickly coming to help him. But Sam quickly started to babble like a crazy man.
"Well, nothing special, we all working our ass off for the coming tests," Adam said ignoring his twin sister Jo's cry.
"What? Are you kidding me, Mr. Winchester? What kind of anniversary you are talking about? and why in the world you giving me this huge Red Rose bouquet, I think you are trying to prank me" Castiel huffed annoyingly.
"You welcome Dean. Happy to hear that. And how you feel now?" Castiel asked softly, still cares his hair.
"And Sammy believe me all my tension, the panic, the anger, the bitterness about myself all washed over with his first smile at me, and I swear Sam he fixed me, he made me feel like Me, Home, and I felt I'm complete with him" Dean confessed without a bit hesitation.
Castiel's whole face became red as he's crying and his bottom lip swollen as the ball hit there, Castiel's lips were bloody red but luckily it's not wounded or bleeding but filled with blood inside and swollen as hell. Also, Castiel was crying and didn't stop for a bit, crying and looking at his best friend's face with his big blue eyes which are now soaked with tears. It would be a few seconds for all of this to happen and Dean stared at his hurting crying best friend with huge pain and fear in his face because he didn't know how to erase the pain from Cas. Next second he carefully touched Castiel's face and kissed his lips. Kissed and licked the bottom lip to make sure Castiel's hurting lip Will heal with that, and keep kissing him.
On the one hand, it was just a day. A significant day, yes, but realistically, it was just a signal that the Earth had completed one full rotation around the sun. Jack probably wasn’t gonna hit any significant development milestones today, unless you counted showing off his newfound walking skills to Sammy and Eileen.
reason he would have for bringing in a cake instead is how vehemently I defended my position when Kevin tried to argue the point.”
He knew it was somewhat rare, for hunters to have this easy affection. Too many of them pushed any real connections away. Were scared of leaving loved ones behind to mourn, when they inevitably died on the job.
had a decent day today, chatted w a nice person online and got a fair bit of school work done which was a vibe. however the plans w my best friend are a lil shaky as we both indecisive as fuck and she needs to check w her mum that the suggested plan will work and part of me is worried that if it

wouldn’t want the bond, but Cas, if you’re not interested in this meaning anything more, then that totally fine as well. I can’t imagine being soul-bonded to my fuck-up of a self was high on your list of wants from humanity. I can… I can forget I ever saw your mark, if that’s what you want.”
— the crackle they heard when they camped out on cold winter nights, the force that had ultimately pulled Dean back together with his family and towards Cas in the first place.
i am absolutely feral atm and idk if its as a result of watching hannibal or if i decided i needed to watch hannibal bc I'm feral. truly a chickon or the egg scenario for the ages dfksjhzxnm,
have not been as on top of all of today's drama as I have some of the other major s16 events (does this even count as s16 still???) but what I
today was,,,, actually good. i'm probably still at risk of spiralling again if my best friend has to cancel us hanging out again, but when I consider how i was feeling this time last week (or even just 3 days ago) it's like night and day. i wish i had a solid idea of what catalysed this breakdown so i could avoid it in the future but I'm pretty sure it was just the accumulation of multiple stressors sending me into overload.
facts would never change, no matter how long they’d been married, so Dean knew a part of him would always light up like a Christmas tree at the reminder that he and Cas were husbands.
around the subject hasn’t achieved anything but stress on both of our parts. It’s been years, I highly doubt things are going to change for us, emotionally at least.”
Ellen had sworn that Cas was legit, was the only reason she’d gotten Jo back all those years ago, and no one who put themselves through so much trouble to help a grieving and worried mother would change
There’s a reason Jack hadn’t been able to pull Cas back out of the empty in the same way he’d reverse-Thanos-snapped all the other people Chuck had killed off before their final showdown, and it wasn’t his decision to be more ‘hands-off’ than his predecessor had been.
that welled up, disappointment that he couldn’t even do this small thing for Dean anymore— it wasn’t exactly something he could control.
“I am sorry if I have come across that way at any point,” he apologised. “As I said, I’m not used to behaving any differently.”
“Woah, hey, Cas, I was talking about you just then,” Dean said. “I meant the folks that look down on anyone and anything they deem below their station. You’ve always just come across as adorably awkward.”
ok most of these i only vaguely care abt feedback for (like i like knowing that people enjoy my writing but idm if i do/don't get much constructive crit or comments in general) but like. any allos or other folks who enjoy kissing, tell me if this seems not gross? Or even just people who can tell that sorta shit even if they personally do not like kissing. i will not b editing this but i will try to apply it to my future writing. this was an interesting exercise that i probably won't be repeating often but i can't always fade to back and i'd like to feel at least semi-confident when i try to write kissing that has more detail. writing this i was like "he... sucked on it gently? that's a thing people do while frenching, right???????"
, but the mixed thoughts that followed were not. The clench of his heart when Dean sent a similar grin to pretty waitresses and ladies in bars had probably existed back when he was still in denial about how ‘profound’ their bond was, but he’d pushed it down in favour of enjoying the good spirits Dean was usually in after coming back from a one-night-stand.
When he starts coughing, he almost feels vindicated— it seems like a clear sign that he was right to be mostly unconcerned, no matter what the voice in the back of his head is saying. He buys himself some cough syrup the next time they come across a pharmacy, then tries a different brand when it has no effect.  It almost feels like there’s something lodged at the opening of his airway, a foreign object that his body is trying to expel, but he squashes that idea down.
He’d walk down the street hand in hand with Cas, not even sparing a passing thought to the opinions of the strangers he walked past. What did he care if they judged him for his relationship? Cas was the best thing that had ever happened to him, and everyone that he cared about were very in favour of the fact that they’d finally pulled their heads out of their asses. Less happy about how obnoxiously in love they tended to act these days, but some sacrifices had to be made. And Sammy had no issues with telling them to get a room, at least.
On the harder days — days where Dean wakes up, the remnants of a nightmare flashing across their mind, days where he feels like he’s floundering beneath the weight of his past and the expectations for his future — Dean and Cas have a ritual.
“I am not willing to give up on both of our futures so easily, but giving in to his coercion isn’t a viable option either. But I don’t know what other options we have, and as you have already pointed out, he was very careful not to implicate himself while propositioning us.”
if anyone wants to l o o k a t h e. i'm not much of an artist but sometimes im possessed by an uncontrollable urge to draw something and that happened today.
, but who’d you think they’re gonna believe? The two students being accused of cheating who ‘submitted’ identical essays, or the tenured professor who
They’re all during formal affairs, both their times being taken up way too much by the wedding preparations, and dinners with their assorted families are the closest they get to any real privacy.
didn’t love waking up early in the mornings, especially when compared to Dean. When the early morning light hit his face, he was a helluva lot more likely to grumble and roll over in his sleep than to relish in it like Dean tended to. Mornings just... weren’t his thing, and hadn’t been ever since his body started relying on sleep.
But even then, there are expectations. Despite the small amount of familiarity they had formed with each other on their walk, they both knew their mothers would be watching them and that they couldn’t relax in each other’s company the way that Dean so sorely wished they could. He didn’t know Castiel yet, couldn’t tell if he even
Cas, despite Sam’s insistence that he was being an idiot, avoided bringing the topic of soulmarks up with Dean for as long as humanly possible.
permanent in a way their motels and houses growing up had never been, but decorating a house was different. For one thing, no one ever really saw the inside of the bunker other than them.
John Winchester, of course, had had no time for giving him or Sammy stupid nicknames. Dean had done his best, though, and although he doubted he succeeded for
necessary for him to stake his claim. He’d spent about 20 minutes separated from his husband due to his shower, after all, and that was just

was supposed to be the one with self-esteem issues. Were you ever gonna tell me of your own volition, or were you gonna just stick around watching me having one-night-stands regularly while convinced that this is something that I don’t want?”
this jumps ahead quite a bit lol but this is what my brain wanted to contribute to this verse today lol
“It’s interesting to think of how differently we’ve seemed to be raised, despite both belonging to royal families. It’s understandable, given how different our kingdoms are, but either way. I hope it’s not been too much of a culture shock for you.”
He’d known it was coming, had for a while now— Cas had sat him down a month or two ago to go through all the changes that would likely occur again now that he was losing his grace for good. Dean had found it a little ridiculous, at the time, as a) it’s not like this is their first rodeo with the whole ‘Cas falling’ thing, and b) he was just, well, turning human. And Dean was, unsurprisingly, very well versed in what it meant to be human, given
depressing and the fic had a hopeful ending, but it just hit me strongly due to family stuff + chronic illness stuff).
“We’re expected to conduct ourselves with propriety as well, don’t get me wrong, but it does seem like our families have different opinions on what that means. I hope that you find living here freeing, if nothing else.”
also I'm probably gonna rewatch yuri on ice tonight/tomorrow bc I just ahhhh its so good. yuuri & victor's relationship is just! my favourite thing!! like, I know some people didn't love that technically their relationship is never actually confirmed in the show, but its so fucking blatant lmao and also implicit relationships/subtextual relationships ≠ queerbaiting lol (like obvs in some cases it Is queerbaiting but not Always, you know?)
They’d both spent so much time denying themselves the things they both obviously wanted that being freely allowed to indulge in their mutual affection for each other was taking some getting used to, and he wasn’t sure how best to remedy that fact.
“Look, you can continue fucking around with the machine if you really want, but I’m gonna make myself a cup using the French press. If you’re really nice, I might even give you a sip.”
even if it sometimes feels like things are inevitable. Humanity may be struggling, but individuals are trying to correct the mistakes we’ve made in the past and are working towards a better future. You aren’t part of the 1 percent, you aren’t actively making the future worse for everyone else— saving the world we live in from the issues that humanity itself has caused isn’t the responsibility of any one individual, even though there are certainly individuals in positions to enact far more serious change than the likes of you and I could manage. It’s important to remember that.”
Oh, sure, if he’d had a particularly wild night he’d struggle a little, especially if that wild night included copious amounts of alcohol, but outside of that? He’d rise with the sun, happy as a clam, and prepare himself for whatever they were doing that day, maybe head to the kitchen if they were staying somewhere with a stovetop for once or at home in the bunker.
Cas continued, louder now, and sent Meg a glare that dared her to interrupt again. When she opened her mouth to do just that, he barrelled forwards with his sharing of his misery. “So, I told him it was cool, and he
Cas, who until this point had continued projecting his disgruntled vibes out at the world, set his coffee down gently before holding his arms out at Dean with a small smile on his face.
For one thing, they didn’t know if Cas would be happy as a human, and neither of them wanted to take that choice away from him. That issue was fairly easily solved by directly asking Jack if he would be willing to restore Cas’ angelic status if needed — he was — but Dean felt slightly guilting about asking Jack to do them favours like that even if he
“Yeah, the weirdness mostly came after, so I’m not sure where we land on front. And I know, I felt bad about asking almost immediately, but it was too late.”
“That you tried to bond with Claire in a variety of ways?” Cas raised his eyebrow as he replied, and Dean knocked their shoulders together with a cocky grin.
“Care for me in what sense? Because, well, I care for Sam greatly, but I wouldn’t sit holding his hand while he was unconscious.”
The things they did when spending time together didn’t change— They still went out to bars with each other and curled up on the living room couch to continue Cas’ education in the world of pop culture. Now, though, they proudly showed off their matching marks as a clear signal to the other bargoers, or would curl up
The idea that his form would dictate his interests, and clothing, and pretty much everything about him and his life.
sorry is this bad i wrote this while vaguely in a vc (by which i mean we were mostly vibing together and not talking but i was actively in th vc while writing
per se. As a hunter, you got pretty used to waking up at the most random of times, and that was only compounded by the presence of a baby in your life.
“Come on, I can see you’ve got a bad scrape on one of your arms. I’m gonna need to at least clean the wound, even if you don’t think it warrants stitches.”
He started off gently, just combing his fingers through in an attempt to shift them all into alignment. Cas’ wings were tense under his hands, some part of the angel’s mind obviously protesting the idea of him exposing his vulnerabilities in such a way, and Dean gentled his strokes even more in response.
So she’s not surprised when Dean drags her to his house after school telling her he’d already set up the blow-up mattress on his floor for a mostly impromptu sleepover and she’s even
we had our first open for inspection today!! strangers were just like. in my house while i wasn't home. whack.
But in that moment, with Sam wearing a vague look of concern in response to whatever Dean’s face was currently doing, there’s only one thing he wants to say.
But they hadn’t actually done much outside of that, and the dozens of pamphlets that the resort had on ‘local attractions’ seemed to be judging the newlyweds from their places pinned to a cork board.
i did not intend for this to be dialogue only but then i only included one action line so I decided to remove it and make it a stylistic choice dhshdj
Cas’ room even if the angel wasn’t around to live in it) and wallow in his misery for a while, alternating between cursing out anyone and everything and desperately trying to hold back the tears that he’d pushed aside while they were working to defeat Chuck. He’s not remotely successful on that front.
A few hours later, Cas found himself sitting up from his position lying on Meg’s couch with a start.
Cas blinked at him, not quite picking up what he was putting down, and Dean had to hold back his groan at Cas’ reply.
Cas’ arms tightened even more as Dean whispered, but they loosened a moment later, presumably after Dean’s words finished processing. He made another noise that seemed to convey ‘come back to bed soon’, and Dean chuckled before dropping a gentle kiss on Cas’ forehead.
“I feel like I saw it at some point today, but I can’t remember where. Could you find a recipe online instead?”
knew exactly who had called Dean, given her status in his life as his ‘incredibly cheeky niece’, and she
way, that letting them out in the open finally was a shock. And while they may have been ignoring their feelings for each other for years, those feelings had still
“We buy honey from a local bee farm for people to use in their tea if they buy some, but we don’t really go through it. I’m happy making you one and just billing you at the specials price each day, no one will ever know the difference. Unless Benny rats us out, at least.”
had an issue with it! I assumed you’d, well, tell me when you felt comfortable. And I’m glad you do now, although I wish it hadn’t taken so long.”
“Fuck, I completely forgot that Chuck’s not in control anymore. God, I’ve been so consumed by the fact that I have you back that I haven’t even told you half the shit that went down in between the Empty taking you and me coming in after you.”
“Yeah, Cas. I— Kinda figured you knew? I just assumed my bond was broken, as I asked you about angels and soulmate bonds once, and you said that you guys didn’t need them so you didn’t get them. I just figured that God or whoever it is that assigns matches had decided I was undeserving of a soulmate bond, or that it would distract me from being Michael’s vessel somehow.”
listen to it, part of him felt like the voice in the back of his head was right. He wasn’t like Bobby or Sam, he wasn’t patient enough to be a resource for other, newer hunters to come to and ask for advice. He was handy with cars, but didn’t have any actual qualifications to work on them and didn’t exactly know how he’d go getting hired to work as a mechanic. (Also, part of him couldn’t help but feel he would be a disappointment, if he went from literally saving the world to fixing Joe from down the road’s car so that he could get to his mundane office job every day. Castiel had assured him he wouldn’t be, that all he needed to consider was whether or not a job like that would make him happy, but that didn’t stop Dean from thinking it.)
this is purely because i've been thinking abt the adventure zone today,,,,,, i know in canon there's something w metatron where cas like,, downloads the knowledge of a bunch of shit into his brain or something (i really have the weirdest mix of spoilers for this show) but I'm ignoring whatever the fuck that is for this because something about cas being absolutely delighted at the mcelroys shenanigans brings me great joy (also idk when that is timeline-wise so might b b4 taz existed anyway)
we watched more today! 4 eps, the rugaru which is notable bc dean refers to cas as 'cas', the black and white episode which is notable because fucking dracula, the ghost sickness ep which is notable for the lip sync at the end and also deans characterisation throughout the entire ep being amusing as hell, and the Halloween ep which is notable because cas (like specifically the fact that he's starting to show his personality & love for humanity & doubts abt heavens plans) but also just. his existence
You see, there’s this funny thing about mythology and beliefs. Although some myths were almost certainly complete bullshit — although the existence of angels had certainly stopped him from
“Dean, you’ve been having takeout for dinner every Sunday night since you first moved out of home, and I know you don’t order for another thirty minutes most weeks. You doing something different would be like me missing a Moondoor meetup.”
this convo is really going in a completely different direction than I first planned for lmaooooo but the end result should be pretty much the same ✨
?” He whined, well aware he sounded somewhat like a petulant child, and Cas chuckled before continuing his ministrations.
“Dean, I wasn’t in here when you started to stir. They were only letting in one visitor at a time, it’s hospital policy over lunchtime for some reason.”
reorganised my room a bit today— we decided my bed needed to be against a different corner, and it was a good decision. also, now my nightstand is on the side I'm used to having it on
I also started a second reddie soulmate fic this morning bc I was struck with inspiration so I don't feel guilty abt only just hitting 100 words for this (like i shouldn't anyway, that's the whole point of this 100 words is the Goal™, but I feel pride in so consistently going over the word count)
though, Cas. Public or otherwise, I don’t know how to get my brain to accept that sorta affection as okay.”
Cas can't understand the sudden change of Alfie. Cas only got two friends in here as he didn't want to lose them, Meg and Alfie. Kevin also a friend of his but he is a freshman and a huge book nerd, so he is not joining them all the time. But for few days, he noticed that Alfie always choose the times that Meg Can't join with them and then he will acting so weird. But he can't understand why is that? Today is a day like that as he can't wait to finish his food and got back to his next class.
Dean swallowed. Shit. That's the ugly truth. Yes, Cas isn't stupid. He might be half right. But right now Dean's feelings are not fake. He really wanted Cas's friendship. But he never thought about what will happen to their friendship after he wins that bet. Actually, he was afraid to even think about it.
"Um okay, thank you and welcome, I guess" Mary looked at both of them suspiciously and made a mental note to talk with Dean about their problem soon.
Castiel came home as quickly as he can. He was holding back his cry until now and he is now home so he started to cry with all the pain he has stopped from coming out. He didn't know what is wrong with him and why people hate him so much especially Dean Winchester. However, Castiel was fed up with asking that same question from himself which always ended up with no answer. He just kept crying and fell asleep on the couch.
The four of them ate peacefully. Mary forced Castiel to eat more and Sam also tried to serve him more. Dean didn't say anything much, he ate silently because he was busy staring at Castiel's lips. Castiel was getting very uncomfortable when Dean sat down in the chair opposite him.
Cas searched his notebook for his next class but he couldn't find it anywhere, not in his bag or in the locker. Then he remembered Alfie borrowed it yesterday from him. He knew Alfie was going to the washroom before his class, so Cas started to run to catch him before he going to his class.
"So, seriously Cassie, tell me the whole story" Gabe claps his hands together as he is ready to listen to the story as Cas sighs again. Cas knows that he can't get rid of his brother until he telling him everything. so he starts to explain what happens yesterday morning, with the demon army. Also, he determines to not mention about the kiss but unfortunately, it slips out of his mouth and Gabriel didn't stop laughing for a long time.
“of course Castiel, the school nurse brought you to here, they said you got some kind of this bulling trouble and they keep searching about it, and they didn’t like the way you passed out and you seems not good, so they brought you here ” nurse said grabbing his clipboard.
Suddenly there are lots of small voices around them as students started to talk about what they heard. Castiel stopped walking as he also heard that. What's going on? Oh god is that Dean? Holly fuck am I in trouble? Have I screwed up it? Why is Azazel asking that in front of all this students here? Castiel gulped heavily and just stood among other students not able to walk or think anymore.
you know The Wizard of Oz! Or was that not included in the pop-culture catch up Metatron forced on you?”
It was sunny and bright as they all headed down to the beach, and Dean felt inexplicably grateful for that fact.
She made an obvious huffing noise, and he found himself flushing as he dragged his eyes from the messy hair he would just
The awkward air surrounding them ramped up at the reminder of just why they were here right now, and silence fell over them again. A few moments passed, then Dean straightened up as an idea came to him.
the trip organisation for this new version of the trip is progressing and im really excited, also I've been trying to interact with the wider group again and one of my friends said that she's missed me and literally i almost cried. idk its whack, sometimes our brains are our own worst enemies.
so I was planning on today’s drabble bein crack because I didn’t wanna post another wing fic segment but then my brain remembered trans!dean last night and I was like well fuck now I wanna write it
“I dunno, man, guess he just wants different things out of a relationship? We’ve been through a lot together, so that complicates feelings as well. If I were braver, maybe I’d give it a shot, but…”
Bobby’s voice startled him, which was unsurprising given how many years it had been since the last time he heard it in person.
“Alright, guys, I’m gonna step out into the hallway to take this, just in case it’s important. I’ll be watching through the windows, so no funny business while I’m out there, ok?”
I've left it ~vague~ what the magical bs is bc idk, suspense, but sky knows and the rest of y'all can almost certainly guess xfjkdzsncz.
Because that’s the thing they don’t tell you about fairy-tales, isn’t it? They talk about the romance, the glory, the joy that follows once everything’s said and done. And then they sanitise out all the gory details that don’t fit that pretty picture.
Ok, that was a lie. He knew exactly-fuckin-why he was so nervous, and while he was pretty sure his worries were completely unfounded, he didn’t think anyone would begrudge him for having them.
🤷🤷🤷 I’m tired today yall (although I saw my best hs friend today and we went op-shopping/out to lunch so it’s a Good tired)
“You seem to have worn him out,” she said with a wink, and Cas chuckled again as Dean made a feeble protest.
When we entered into this relationship, I did so fully aware of your history and the issues you still struggle with. Those issues were never going to disappear overnight. But I love you, as you love me, and nothing brings me greater joy than getting to be with you in this way, even on the hard days.”
prolly gonna cave and watch an ep of hannibal tonight/tomorrow,,,,, I'm honestly curious to know how many iconic lines from season 1 i Already Know from reading so many gd aus vfdshj
They both wore matching grins at this point, and from there it was quick work to swap numbers before sitting down and organising the last of their things as their professor entered the room, both glancing non-subtly at each other as the class progressed. This weekend was going to be good.
“Because of this, even if we pursue a formal romantic relationship, we would need to keep our interactions as platonic as possible during the time periods where Jimmy is awake. I know this is a lot to ask of you, so if you wish to postpone things until we have found a solution for me having my own body, then that is understandable, and I will not resent you for the actions that you undertake in the meantime.”
Bobby sent him a look that suggested the older man knew exactly what was going through his head either way, but he left it alone.
“Here it is! If you have any issues, just let me know. Normally I have another receptionist working with me, she’s been handling my training, but she’s on her lunch break right now and I’m far enough along that I’m trusted to handle things on my own. She’ll be back in around 20 minutes, if you’d prefer the help of someone more experienced.”
“If they’re looking for a kitten and don’t find one at the first shelter they visit, they’ll go to more. Kittens aren’t exactly in short supply.”
“What the fuck,” he said, feeling like that expressed his emotions at the moment very clearly. “Things aren’t that easy for us. Things are
“I’ll just book you into some random resort near the beach, I guess, if neither of you are gonna give me guidance on what you’re actually looking for. But you
She blinked, obviously surprised. She’d been trying to convince him Dean had been staring at him as much as he’d been staring at Dean over the course of the semester, but he hadn’t quite believed it. Today’s incident just further cemented the idea that she was delusional in his mind.
talking about pulling you out of literal Hell— for one thing, how do they have the power to do rescue you?
“Do you know a lot about the angels in your universe?” He asked, and Dean smirked before gesturing in Cas’ direction.
“You seemed really excited about trying out this diner, I didn’t want to stop you. I know we could have come tomorrow instead, but their opening week special ends today.”
It was with this thought in mind that he found himself watching the storm, an immovable presence next to Miracle’s side. He’d intended to only sit for a minute or so, long enough to assure Miracle that he knew of whatever potential danger they could be facing before encouraging him away from the windows and the storm, but he became caught up in the natural wonder. It’d been a long time since he’d indulged in a moment of peace like this, especially considering recent events, and as it washed over him he found it impossible not to think of Cas.
“It’s just, the honey latte I bought last time was a daily special, and I’m not very familiar with the varieties of drinks on offer here.”
When Dean and Cas stumbled out of the Empty hand in hand, it took them both a second to realise something was wrong.
It only took them a few minutes to reach the door to the garden they’d walked through together the week prior, Dean using his familiarity with the castle hallways to his advantage while Cas remained hot on his heels. They froze — almost colliding with both each other and the wall — when they saw a uniformed guard standing watch by the door, and Dean was mentally cursing his lack of foresight (of
It didn’t take long for Professor Azazel to call them both inside his office, meaning Dean only had to cast around for one small talk topic to take advantage of this admittedly bizarre opportunity to actually talk to Cas. He figures the meeting will be quick, something he and Cas can easily and honestly explain as a complete coincidence, given they’ve never actually talked before, but the slimy grin that Azazel sends their way isn’t exactly promising.
Cas’ status as an angel. Sure, Cas had said that whole thing about them being God’s gift to humanity, but Dean wasn’t exactly
get a sleep-in,” he explained, then relaxed his grip slightly. “Besides, we can just get room service.”
As he continued down the path to humanity, Cas found himself... wanting, in ways he never had before. He’d catch Dean’s eyes on a hunt, see him grin in a self-satisfied way, and it opened up a yearning in his slowly forming soul that he didn’t quite know what to do with.
Rather than answering, Dean held the packet up for Cas’ perusal, and was somewhat surprised to find that the ex-angel’s face brightened in recognition.
Cas’ eyes really were impossibly wide and blue in moments like these, and Dean found himself scrambling to reassure the ex-angel that nothing was wrong.
felt this deeply for. I’m tired of pretending that’s not true, that I’m not completely crazy for you. I don’t even know what’s stopping me, at this point, other than the fear of somehow fucking us up. It’s not like it’s exactly a secret these days, despite us both doing our best to pretend it is, and Dad’s not around to disapprove of my sexuality anymore. So… screw it. Screw fear. I— I love you too, Cas.”
“Look, we should definitely look into it more first, and it doesn’t solve all our issues, but uh. From an initial look, it seems good. It’s something I flagged in our initial research as worth investigating further, but I didn’t think it would be any use until you mentioned your idea.”
reminder i have not interacted with babies on any significant basis since I was too young to have any real conception of like, developmental milestones, bc although I was the 12 year old tasked with looking after cousins and shit the ones that I interacted with regularly ranged from 6-8 and also my parents separated when I was 14 so I have pretty much not seen any younger children on a significant basis since then

, I’m not gonna take a break or whatever the fuck else you think I should be doing with my time. Because I’m not gonna stop until we’ve pulled Cas back out of that godforsaken place he’s trapped in so I can tell him what a fucking

Chaps 46-52, 73, 75— the last night (not the last honeymoon drabble though lmaoo i have Not covered all the days which was my plan, this was just vibing)
Yeah like a mistake when you keep hitting and bulling me? Cas wanted to ask that, but he took a long breath to keep himself cool.
Dean's face changed with anger, but quickly he chuckled at Benny, which anyone can say, was a fake one.
"Yeah? is that so? And how about now?" He asked and suddenly he was leaned toward Castiel as there were few inches between their lips to touch. and Castiel gasped when Dean smirked and show above them.
If Castiel wanted to go to his class he must go between the bullies, there is no other way around. And he is afraid to face those assholes but on other hand, he was not a coward at all. But right now he is so weak and he can't go through another trouble. But he had no other choice. As he quickened his steps and stepped towards the class, without even looking at the bullies.
"Oh, you want me to dirty talk to you babe. Aaah fuck... Mmm. yeah I'm fucking your tight juicy pussy, look at that needy pussy hole of yours. how eagerly swallow my huge 9-inch, thick cock. Oh fuck babe see how your pussy hole took all my monster cock inside it"
"Dean this? This is unbelievable, how do you even?" Castiel started but not completed as Dean saw the shock register on his face. And also there is a small smile played on Castiel's lips.
He said but last part with a very low voice but Castiel heard it and he couldn't control himself so gave him a little frown.
"What the hell Dean" Both Cas and Dean turned. Sam was standing there gritting his teeth and holding a bowl of popcorn.
Castiel quickly opened the Dean's gift. His heart started to beat a bit fast. He really wanted to know what is Dean's gift. Finally, he opened the gift box and he gasped when he see it.
"Then Gabriel got pissed. He shouted at me. He questioned me why I always ended up not listening to him and then got into trouble. Then he yelled that no one came to help us when we needed help, and every time I tried to help someone or close to someone I got into trouble or hurt. Even I was having social phobia so Gabriel was angry and he threatened me that he will leave me if I'm not listening to him anymore."
"I'm feeling good now, um, mam can you please tell me what happened? I mean who bring me to the hospital? Because I don’t remember much”
"Yeah, that's what I'm also telling you. I saw you were out of the world so I added that part to my story to check you, then I caught you, so tell me, Dean, seriously what's going on with you?" Charlie asked in a very concerned way.
He hugged the bouquet softly and hummed to the soft feeling of the softest petals and the unbelievably beautiful aroma coming from the roses. Castiel got a bunch of photos of it. And took some selfies too. And made a mental note to take some more photos of the roses and selfies from the morning too.
Dean starts to fuck Cas's slit with his tongue again, spreading that big pussy lips. Suddenly he puts a finger on it and touches the clitoris and Cas's whole body shaking.
Okay, this is getting ridiculous. Cas was done with this as he shook his head, finally looking at Dean.
Dean also moaned with the pleasure and he was fighting the urge to thrust up into Castiel's hole. But Castiel didn't waste his time and started to move on Dean's cock and Dean also started to eagerly thrust into him.
"Now please stop crying Dean, you are very ugly when you are crying" Mary chuckled and Dean also chuckled wiping his tears.
"Just kidding again, and that's how we ended up ourselves, um, you know, um like that half-naked and... On the floor" Dean said and stopped there nervously rubbing his back of the neck.
"Oh thank you, Clarence. Oh, I mean Castiel. Sorry, hey what's it?" She asked laughing at her mistake.
"Oh it's fine Clarence you don't need to bother we are fine," Mary said waving her hand towards Castiel.
The remedy barely went through his pale and numb lips but some spill out. But it looks like Ellen is satisfied with the amount consumed. Then she put some medicine on the wound on Dean's neck quickly.
Dean licked his lips and gulped staring at Castiel's rose and plump lips. He just wanted to lick and kiss those kissable lips slowly for eternity. He was kinda hungry for those gorgeous lips.
King John, also standing beside the bed where Dean laying unconsciously. Sam is sitting on the floor near the bed ready to help Ellen with anything she asks while she doing treatments for Dean.
"You know Sammy, I suppose to be in that comfy and warm coach cuddling with my comforter and drinking my morning beer, and now look at me, I can't believe you chose your "to be brother in law" Over your own brother " Dean yelled trying to sound more powerful than the wind.
Castiel was sitting in the study area when Dean roaming all over the college searching for him. When Dean finally found him the first thing he did was scan the area like an eagle to check whether was it secure to talk with Castiel. To his relief, there were no many students in there but only two nerd girls and three more nerds boys were there minding their own business. Dean was sure that they will never notice even Dean dance here because they just attached to their books like glue.
"I know you have lots of questions Omega. And I will give you answers to all, but first I'm going to give you some privacy to get on some clothes. You are already shaking and milk is getting cold. Here, I'm turning around, so you can get out of the tub and get some clothes on, then we can talk, okay?" Says the Alpha and quickly turns around. Cas grits his teeth.
"Collin and Bradley, Steve and Bucky, Kabir and Khalid, c'mon stand up and change your seats, kids, I gotta mark this list correctly" Mrs.Pamela instructed them as students started to cry and happy yellings over name paring. Castiel's heart slowly started beating fast. On the other side, Dean was too excited and was smirking like a wolf.
"The only thing I can do is just asking Rufus to give some chance.but the decision is up to him, and I think you still got chance to stay in the team if you keep going to practice, and boy, stays away from that kid and don't involve to any bullies, coz if I catch anyone cold-blooded I'm gonna kick them out of the college in next second, even if that is you, no more warning" Bobby warned and Dean nodded.
"Okay, you don't trust me, right? Not a wonder though when looking back on my past" Dean said smiling at his hands.
"And hey, I swear I just messed with you earlier okay? No, any seducing idea, I'm sorry if I made you angry"
"What? Dude, you don't remember him? Don't remember the kid who's your cousin's favorite victim? Man, he is bulling him forever like the kid is his personal toy" Benny said and laughed loudly as Dean's memory ran to the last time he talked to Cas. That's exactly what Cas said and it felt like a slap on his face.
"Actually what's going on with Winchester? Do you think he already fucked that nerd? And also he is started to play with full concentration. And again, that fucking coach warned me about my captaincy already and I'm pretty sure he would love to pass it to Winchester" Michael groaned.
"C'mon Mom, it's an Apple pie and you both already make sure and told him to feel it like home, so he is not a guest. oh and besides I already brought Ice cream and Cheesecake for him" Dean grinned at them before showing another giant piece of pie into his mouth. Then started to moan.
Castiel was only in his boxer briefs and no t-shirt. He was trying to putting on the given fresh pants, but never able to finish as the door opened before that. and now Dean freaking Winchester is starting at his naked body. Awe-freaking-some.
What if Cas already got a decision after I went to his home? What if Cas decided that he don't want me at all? What if anyone already flirting with him in his office right now? Dean's mind started to give him question by question as Dean slowly rubbed his forehead unable to control himself.
Hospital wanted to inform anyone of his family members or a friend but Castiel had to convince them that he can take care of it and his family is too busy and didn't want to interrupt them.
"Babe, I said I'm so sorry about that, but you are aware that they can't get some decisions without me" Cas tries to convince Dean for the hundredth time now.
Actually, his idea was seems like a pretty good one. it's kinda killing two birds with one stone. He can do his studies in the library which was the greatest hiding place of Cas. On the other hand, no one will suspect about the fact that Dean hanging out in the library, because the exams are coming soon so Dean can put on an act like he is studying and for the plus point he can actually do studies too. And he can catch Cas for few minutes to explain everything and put another step closer to him. Maybe they can study together if he played this right. So it's a deal and Dean confirmed the idea in his mind when others dragged him to get their lunches.
"It's okay sweetheart, it's okay. You don't have to say anything. I promise. You can get your time. I'm here for you until you come around one day. Just remember what I said. That's all" Dean's voice was soft and lovely.
Gabriel was touching the flowers with awe when he saw the cute card which was attached to the bouquet.
"And besides if you want more proofs, my girlfriend Lilith is not a Lesbian as of course you know we are dating, and not even a Bi. But we make a bet and she fucked this random lesbian girl from the bar, and she even got photos to prove it. So she won" He said again.
They opened their gifts and Castiel slowly leaned toward Dean's side with a serious face. Dean was already opened all Sam's and Gabe's gifts first. Then he was about to open Cas's now.
"Actually after I knew that you are Gabe's brother I just tried to get to know you, but you kept me away from you" Dean chuckled.
"You know Cas, this is not the way I dreamed to take you here at the first time," Dean said looking at him who now smiling at him kindly.
"Cas, look I'm sorry, I just.." Dean started but before he says anything else cold hands wrapped around him messily and he heard a soft sob near his ear.
"4th, I really want to fix everything and to make a new friendship, 5th I owed you one for my mom and I can't tell you how much I'm grateful for that, 6th I just want to make it up to you, so I'm begg..." And suddenly Dean got interrupted by Cas at that point.
"Yes, and please don't think that I'm overstepping it, but I already told you that I have a friend who knows about ballet a lot. Actually, he is a great dancing instructor and he has a dancing academy. When I asked him how to choose those shoes and stuff he asked me to whom I got those gifts. So I told him about you. Then he told me if you want, you can join his new class which starting in January. Then I thought its a nice idea and you will be surprised. After that I made registration for you" Dean said and see Castiel's face change to a huge smile but with a bit shyness.
"And now I can see who's that your friends are" Dean added chuckling again. Cas gave him a fake glare rubbing the dirt in his back.
"babe you are so wet for me, look at that hole. Mmmm made just for me" he said before nibbling over the hole. And lick around the pink hole and suck it. Quickly he started to tongue fuck the lube and split soaked hole as Cas felt it's his call.
Dean collapses on Cas and both of them panting together. Dean pulls his softening cock from Cas and looks the way his cum came out from Cas’s used pink hole. Dean tries to collect some leaking cum and put it inside the well-fucked hole again, making Cas gasps.
"Good, because if he did something else like that, I don't know how should I trust my brother anymore," Sam said looking at Dean and stormed off to the kitchen.
"No, no please don't. I'm sorry for everything Cas. I don't know how to fix my past but I really want to make it up to you, but dunno how to.."
He knows this is not going to end well, this is like cotton and fire put together. It's ending catching fire and burn. But he also wants this, wants Dean. So he finally let it go.
But before he put another step further, he was pulled by his arm as Dean grabbed him, stopping him from going away.
They didn't talk much but eat silently. Even though Cas can still feel Dean's eyes on him all the time. Cas remembered everything that happened last night, but there were some blur memories too. Like his mom holding him, because the warmth that he felt last night was so good. But also he can remember the way Dean caught him before he falls down on the floor. So it's horrifying to know that Dean freaking Winchester took care of him through a panic attack. And didn't run away from him this time. But why? Normally Dean is not kind to him this much. Something is terribly wrong and whatever it is, still Cas has to thank him, right?
Dean closed his eyes and nuzzled into Castiel's palm trying to hold the urge to turn his head and press a kiss into his palm.
After Dean satisfying with the scent and taste he wraps those long thick fingers which were now glistening with his saliva, around his shaft and starts to pressure himself rutting forward into his fist. He imagines all the ways he wants to take his boyfriend, all the dirty things he wants to do to his sweet omega, soon as after he came back home. But until then he releases his seeds into his hand screaming his mate's name.
Dean froze for a moment. He had to wait for a minute to gather his thoughts before the answer to Azazel. He gulped and turned toward Azazel collecting his books and put them inside his bag.
"Fucking hell so hot Cas, so damn hot" He groans and he can feel his climax is so close and his knot starts to catch Cas's hole. It takes about a few fast, hard, and long full ,thrusts and Dean's cock jerks and throbs. next second his hot cum spills into Cas as warm pleasure rushes through him.
"Hey it's fine okay?, and remember I'm here for anything for any time. Okay? That's what friends are for" Dean smiled at him.
through the ambulance ride, paramedics worked quickly and after quick tests, they able to start the blood transfusions and Castiel faced it bravely. He completely forgot about the exam and college while he was a volunteer to the donate, but who cares about the exam while he can save a life, he thought like that through the ride.
"I can't fucking believe that you turned down the sex, hell turned down the morning SEX for your goddamn office emergency" Dean groans as Castiel coming out of the bathroom hurriedly.
But turned out that impossible. because Dean started to bring things that no one knew Castiel liked them. Obviously only he and his family knew. That's made Castiel shocked how Dean gets to know about that. but afraid to ask how Dean got to know that, he likes the things Dean brought for Castiel.
“Dean, why are you doing this to me? I never ever betray you Dean, why I’m doing that, I love you, I don’t need another man Dean, I don’t know what you talking about or why you hurting me like this, please Dean leave me and let me talk, what happening to you, you never hurt me before.” Cas cry and sobbing with pain.
"Oh god no, no. see. It's not something like that. Don't be afraid. I just didn't want you to go away if I keep going to talk to you when you asked me to go, that's why, look Castiel I'm so sorry man, I was being so rude to you. In different ways. I'm really sorry, I didn't mean any of those" Dean said in a pleading way.
"Ouch aren't you? So then I will ask it politely. Castiel Novak will you please be my boyfriend?" Dean asked looking at Castiel's beautiful blues.
Mrs.Pamela asked giving him a kind smile. She always be kind to Castiel because he got the top marks every time. He is the only student who's not giving any troubles. And to plus point how much smart and bright, he is, still never be a big-headed asshole but a very silent, polite, and innocent one.
"It's a white gold ringggggg, see? isn't it beautiful Castiel?, oh my god isn't he the best boyfriend ever? God, I love him soooo much" Becky almost screamed with her happy tone as Castiel stand up and came around to see her ring, which she was holding out to show.
"Hey gorgeous" Dean's honey voice came out and Cas snapped his head within seconds. Cas just heard it and then he saw Dean, but even before he thought about a response, Dean just walked bypassing him even not glancing at Cas once. Dean completely ignored him and he was just walked past by him like he has no idea that Cas is there.
"Wait, just text him no one is home, no mom, no me. Say all are out today" Dean said quickly, practically losing his cool. Sam give him a suspicious look before typing as he said.
"Dean you used your name and power to help my brother and bring the best Doctor for him, I don't know how to thank you, Dean, I owe you a big-time" Castiel rumbled. Voice small and soft.
"Castielll.." He suddenly stopped walking and stuck on his heel as he heard that. Cas snipped his head fast and then whips around quickly. What? Is that Dean's voice? But how come? And where? And why? Thread of questions flew into his head as he ran back to the other side of the big window, the balcony area which you can see the outside of the building.
At this point, Dean and Sam both came back from their rooms and were hiding back behind a wall and listening to Castiel. They knew it's not nice but they really wanted to know what's bothering this kid that much. They both glared at each other when they saw each other after sneaking out of the rooms. But then Dean signed and put a finger on his mouth as not to say a word. Then Sam gave him another glare before concentration on the speech. They heard Castiel beginning again.
See, Castiel was right. Dean is a real gentleman. He never tried to even remember his dating proposals today. Wow if he wanted he could pull out his teasing, flirting mode. But he never acted like that. He is a real nice guy. Cas thought staring at him. when he spoke up again, his voice was so soft.
And then he walked out to his backyard which he used as his flower garden. But there were not only flowers but also all kinds of vegetables and few fruit trees too. He really loved gardening. Besides running, gardening was his favorite hobby. So he slowly walked through all the trees and plants touching the leaves and flower petals. Sniffing the sweet smells of flowers, It's a different kind of medication and Cas loved it.
He came out of the lift typing a message to Gabriel, letting him know that he is on the way. and didn't give much attention to anything else around him. So that's why he didn't notice the man standing in front of him, few steps ahead in the guest's area.
Dean knew he gotta act too. So he cursed a bit loudly, but be careful to not hear to Mrs.Pamela and Castiel.
And then Dean realized that he was supposed to get off of Cas and right now he is crushing Cas. Shit, his body parts are seriously pressed into Cas's body parts and that's not supposed to happen.
Castiel's eyes got wide as he glanced over the clock. It's 11.45 pm. And normally even Sam didn't wait in the office after 7.00 pm. Castiel knew Dean also never stayed office this much late. He found his voice started to unsteady when he speaking again.
"No, I really want to, and the first thing I want you to know is I missed you so much" Castiel said looking into Dean's heart eyes. Today he is not going to be afraid to express his feelings.
"I'm just messing with ya Cas, I'm sorry if I'm scared you again" Dean chuckled and gave a warm squeeze to his hand before releasing it.
"Come let's sleep, you gonna get a nice and warm sleep then in the morning I'm gonna make your favorite breakfast for my baby, okay?" Cas says in a lovely voice as he trying to make Dean feels good. To make relieve his stresses a bit.
"What? No, Are you crazy Gabe? I'm not. we are not, it just, I had to take Miracle okay? I didn't want to see him again in a cage of that pet center. So I just adopted him from Dean, and you know how much I love dogs and puppies Gabe" Castiel gave an explanation of what actually happened.
"Jees Dean, see how much worse it is? You should have called me earlier. Or call Sam or anyone. Look at you, I'm really mad at you right now" Castiel babbled as he helped Dean to stand up very carefully. Dean just chuckled a bit.
"Get some sleep, my love, you need it after all" Dean whispers and takes off his soften cock from Cas as Cas hisses at the miss of fullness. Dean smiles and goes down and presses a kiss into Cas's well-used and well fucked pussy.
Now Castiel was crying and stared at Dean as Dean kept shouting hateful comments at Castiel. Within seconds they heard one of a teacher shouting and came to them. Without looking back all the gang ran to their class leaving Castiel along standing there with sobs.
"Please let me Cas," With that Dean opened the car door for him. Dean's face was a few inches away from Castiel's.
"yes, I promise you, Dean. We can have fun as soon as I come back home" Cas says quickly pulling in his suit and pants before it getting more late.
Dean isn't going to go home tonight? Even after the practice? Is that because of me? Does that mean he got changed his mind again and hating me again? Is that why he ignored me and pretend like didn't see me in front of that Lisa girl? And then again he ignored me and released Alfie in the washroom. What're all these about? Cas can't understand anything. But right now he can relax because he is sure that Dean would not be in the game night today. Cas sighed before walking away.
Dean knew probably Cas must be blushing right now as he chuckled softly and then earned another nudging from Charlie.
"I don't remember exactly when, but after one time, this word kinda disappear from our use. I mean, I would never ever understand it, if you wouldn't bring this right now. But when you said as 'true mates' it kicked my brain. I don't know why that happens or when. I mean it's just a word, right? But now my curious mind tries to eat me alive completely until I find out what happened to this word" And then he starts to think more.
But then suddenly someone put his hand on Cas's waist and yank him to their side from behind. Cas would think it's Dean if he wasn't in front of him. But besides Dean, there is only one person who would do that.
"How you know about that Dean, Gabriel is not doing okay, but they.. They only doing simple treatments, they just not doing anything else about it..just postponing his surgery saying the Doctor is not coming yet, Dean I'm so scared. What I should do Dean" Castiel started a heavy crying with a large volume of tears flowing steadily.
"Oh god, now where is my manners, I'm so sorry Mary, would you like to come inside?" He barely asked smiling at them. But inside him, he was so scared. He knew Gabriel hate to see Castiel dealing with strangers and Castiel also not familiar with many people. He was getting panicked every time when there is something happened not normal for his simple and boring life. So he had to very careful to be nice to his guests and also keep it quick meeting and make sure they go quickly. and never come back. But how he going to do that, this women's smile made his heart full of peace. Her voice made him feel like he is in safe hands.so how he gonna do that
Castiel tried his best to stop Gabriel. Because he knew how hard his brother working and he didn't want him to use his only free hours for driving home.
Today is also a day like that. After finished his food he slowly started to clean up the kitchen, then he took time for cleaning inside the house. Castiel is a very clean and a neat boy. After that he gathered his backpack and do some studies. Then he decided it’s time to bed. And didn't want any dinner because he was not in a mood to eat but he got some tablets to have, so he just made a warm glass of milk and got his all tablets. After the drinking milk, he felt kinda warmth in his heart. Suddenly he remembered Mary. She was such a nice woman. She always reminds his mom to him. But when she asked to meet his parents he was scared a lot. His only left parent was his father who abounded him and his brother. and who hated Castiel for bringing the unluck for his family. Castiel didn’t remember the last day he saw his father. He was in grade 5 then. He terrifies to even remember his father.
"Dean, actually I'm sorry. When I went to get gifts, I didn't know about you very well, and we were never met before at that time. so I just got some very common gift. I'm sorry it's not a much" Castiel admitted worriedly.
"Okay fine now can you please tell me about this Deano?" Gabriel pleaded and Castiel sighed touching another rose.
"And you know, please call me Dean, when you call me Mr. Winchester it sounds like I'm a very old man"
"Oh is that okay? Wait, I.. Um, it's not a big deal though. I just you know.." Dean babbled opening the back door of impala quickly and getting out a cute little gift bag carefully.
Castiel slowly put those on his car which he was parked a few steps behind them. Then he stands face to face with Dean.
"I really doubt that Dean, I don't want to make people uncomfortable like my brother," Castiel said and Gabriel rolled his eyes.
"Okay guys, we probably go now, Castiel please remember we are here for you if you want anything okay, and please be careful, see you around bitches" Charlie gave a quick squeeze on Castiel's shoulders, and then both girls are gone.
"Well, I know stuff" Dean shrugged. Castiel gave him a suspicious look but didn't try to go along with that.
"So by the way, if it's not too much for tonight I would ask about both of your deals" Mary Scowled.
They cooked a huge smoking bowl of Spaghetti And Meatballs, and for side, Creamy Garlic Mashed Potatoes, and grated Cheese, baked vegetables.
"He is no one and of course not a fucking delicate little flower, I just bumped into him, c'mon let's find others" With that Dean turned on his heel. He never cared to even glance at Castiel, like he completely forgot about Castiel, Dean walked away with that friend of him.
Dean gets his hand not sitting on the bed, but sits on the floor near Cas’s thighs. Dean kissing one of Cas’s beautiful, soft, creamy bare thighs which are open with Cas’s light blue lace panties.
"Thanks, Cas, but you know after Gabe said that you were practicing ballet awhile I really wanted to show you this" Dean said while taking his phone and sliding it then he gave it to Castiel who's taken with wondering what's going on.
"What? I was just going my way, you are the one who came into me" Alfie isn't a stupid kid but he said it in a calm voice because he didn't want to pull a fight with Dean Winchester right now.
"Dean, Sam I'm going, please don't destroy the kitchen. Maybe order some pizzas okay?. I put money in the kitchen. And call me anytime if you want me okay? take care kids" She waves and left when Dean and Sam said bye to her.
"Kevin just can you please stop your bubbling at least for a while, how many times do I have to tell you that Clarence is okay" Meg rolled his eyes at Kevin who worried and talking about Castiel nonstop.
"It's very nice to finally meet you Castiel, you are the Executive Assistant. I have heard about you a lot from my brother, and I'm totally sorry for scaring you like that, I really should have talked to you before you turn and get shocked but" Dean's very professional mood Swang into a laugh a bit, remembering the scene.
Dean lost on words again. Shit, he was what? Damn.. Now I can imagine very Naked, wet Cas laying on his bathing tub, great, just like Rose lay on that sofa when jack portrait her in the Titanic. Fuck Dean cursed his brain for being poetics right now.
Suddenly Dean cleared his throat and looked everywhere but Cas. With that Cas also understood that he was staring back at Dean without even knowing what he was doing. Sandwich, yeah Dean was offering him a Damn Sandwich with all suspicious reasons in the world.
It’s time for my semi-regular ‘I’ve joined a new fandom that I may end up writing for’ warning but with a twist— as y’all may have noticed from my ans this past week or so, my mental health and motivation have been a lot iffy again. Thing is, even despite that, I’ve had some ideas for shadowhunter fics/scenes/drabbles while still often having no clue what to write for spn (like, even on the days that i did do alright, i was doing things like listening to war of hearts and unintentionally/intentionally drawing on sh vibes). When I started this fic, I never intended for it to be all one fandom— it just so happened that supernatural was what I was hyper invested in at the start of this year, and has been something I kept coming back to/was able to write for fairly effectively even when it wasn’t my main fandom at any given moment. Then I hit a point where I felt like, guilty abt the idea of not sticking to just spn given that’s what the people following this came for?? So I turned it into a challenge to see if i could write even when all my brain cells were invested in another set of chars, which has been mostly successful. But for this past week, writings felt a lil like a chore, and that’s the
They move forwards more slowly than Dean had ever seen Cas move on a broom, the wind not even ruffling their hair, and he hooks his chin over Cas’ shoulder as he considers how
pang of regret he felt at that fact was well and truly forgotten 15 minutes later, when they were snuggled together on the sand, coffees in hand, and he got to see the joy in his husband’s face as brilliant colours filled the sky.)
Immediately after Dean first got pulled to Hell, Sam ramped up the research. He'd made contact with as many other hunters as he could, asked Bobby if he was
sometimes u come out to a group of people who mostly already know and still have a fuckin anxiety attack in the process lmaoooooooooo. also i had my first class of uni today and it was for gender & sexuality studies and it was cool and iconic and I'm very excited for this unit however i found it amusing bc at the end the lecturer reassured us that all the topics introduced would b expanded on in more detail etc so if we felt lost it was fine and me, a queer, was sitting there like: oh this is supposed to b confusing??? (like i know many people don't consider shit like this on a day to day basis and are taking the class to gain better understanding and be a better ally/because they know parts of it but not all, which is iconic and good as well but also it's obvs covering stuff that has touched me personally so its strange to imagine Not having that experience lol)
may or may not have left the house for like, the first time since moving today LMAOOOOO I’ve not been good at taking care of myself oops
In the wake of Cas’ accidental reveal and Dean’s subsequent confession, not much changed. Not as much as Dean expected, anyway.
for Christ’s sake, but he found himself drowning in the familiar blue of Cas’ eyes. He’d just watch the video back later.
He’d just spent too many years waking up to find Cas standing vigil, waiting patiently for either brother to rouse and join him. And after they got together, he’d usually find himself wrapped in the angel’s arms come morning, blue eyes staring fondly down at his sleeping form.
religious man, and the idea that his body is going to be used to further science is an idea I greatly enjoy.”
it started as a joke idea (and would obviously be very cracky lol) when my best friend made a joke about a superwholockibal dinner party and i just. cannot get it out of my head. if i was coordinating(/writing it all) like i am in my mind i'd probably ditch the dr who just given I've never actually been in the fandom (like, I've seen all of tennants seasons but never read/written for it) and probably stick in teen wolf instead (the interplay with spn could be funny) but also there would be references to other fandoms/tropes that kinda span that vibe, eg james bond (have a q is a holmes reference), but i genuinely have no clue how i would even Begin to organise this 😔😔😔
I don't actually know how academic integrity meetings work given I've obviously never been part of one and also given everything is digital I don't quite know how they would get framed realistically but ill work it out dshkgf
Not always. Not enough to regret the choices he’d made, the ones that lead to him ultimately giving up the last of his grace and embracing humanity, for all its inherent flaws and weaknesses.
legitimately i'm planning on posting 7 honeymoon drabbles, theoretically culminating in me posting a complete honeymoon fic comprised of said drabbles with a few added connecting scenes because i am filled w fluff vibes and desire others who donot like drabble comps to also b filled with these vibes
me now regularly starting the drabble past 9:30 at night be like 💀 (although today I actually wrote this early! i just didn't get to editing it properly for ages as I wrote it on my phone)
When Castiel first starts falling, he thinks he knows what to expect. He may not have personal experience on the matter, but he’s been observing humans since the day they were created, and has spent the last little while in the close company of two of them. Things might be weird for a little bit, but he’d adjust.
today we've hit T W O arbitrary achievements in this fic! number one is we're o f f i a l l y a third of the way through the year (it's like 121.6 or something overly specific like that but i rounded up), which is fucking wild to think about. the second is that with today's drabble (presuming i didn't fuck up somewhere), this fic is at exactly wordcount it would be completed at if i stuck to the strict definition of what a drabble is rather than using it loosely (aka 36500 words)! we love being a wordy motherfucker sdfmxncmz,bn
Idk what happened off screen but I imagine it’s something to do w cas. Fill in whatever scenario u want.
“I am perfectly capable of working effectively while remaining a source of entertainment for Dean,” he stated, and Sam snorted.
Benny stared them both down for a minute, and Dean felt Castiel shift nervously beside him before Benny’s face broke out into an exasperated grin.
“Look, Dean, I like you a lot, but it’s been obvious you were holding me at an arm’s length on all our dates. I was gonna see how tonight went and maybe ask you about it if things didn’t change, but I don’t think I need to anymore.”
“Cas, you can do whatever the fuck you want now, remember? That comes with the whole free-will deal.”
It was somewhat strange, the first morning Dean rolled over to find Cas asleep next to him, rather than doing his usual Edward Cullen stare routine.
As he worked and talked, he kept an eye on Cas. The guy seemed anxious, but it wasn’t clear if that was entirely the fault of the crowded atmosphere he’d been unprepared to enter or if there was something else at play. He seemed to have relaxed some as Dean talked, which he was
also I'm realising i should probably research American colleges given this fic is like, more focused on that shit than the enemies to lovers au is so i should like, actually work out more info abt everything, but i don't know if i can be fucked
“I won’t go out of my way to tell anyone, brother, but you know that I’ll have to do my job if there’s trouble.”
Today was kinda just a day lol nothing rly happened that I can talk abt here, I hope y’all are going well <3
Cas didn’t have a birthday, they realised the first summer After. It’d never seemed important before, the steady march of time being ultimately irrelevant to his angelic nature even as he watched and celebrated as Dean and Sam grew older each year. But he was human now, as fragile and vulnerable as the rest of them, and age was no longer an unimportant factor in his life.
A part of him thought he should try anyway— he didn’t think he’d be able to hide the petal from Sam once he coughed it out, and he didn’t know if he could convince Sam to keep his condition hidden from Dean. Sam knowing would be bad enough— he didn’t want
seriously this fic is a blessing and a curse because on one hand it encourages me to put pen to paper for the random ideas that flit through my head on a daily basis but on the other i have not worked consistently on a single one of them past that initial 'oh vibe?' moment. maybe one day I'll finish something xdfljfglsdjhf
spoilers: it almost certainly won't work the fact that i've managed this fuckin fic as well as i have is literally a miracle.
Cas rolled his eyes and pulled the other man in for a gentle kiss, before pulling back with a considering look on his face.
“You’re the one who forgot to silence it before class, sir, so I don’t know if you’re as on top of things as you claim. I can confidently say that
too many comments about how he’d been ‘dealing with a decade of UST’ and how it was ‘about time they dealt with their shit’ since Dean had admitted just what had happened when Cas sacrificed himself and how he planned on responding.
“First, you’ll need to comb through my feathers, make sure they all align and aren’t dirty. There’s, uh, a water spray bottle to help with this, it helps with brushing out the dust.”
“If you need a starting point for whatever reason, just. Chop off an ear or something. It’s basically the same principle.”
“There was a stage where that was me to Sammy,” he admitted, more sheepish about that fact than he ever had been previously.
“Yeah! Her name's Eileen, she’s also a hunter. Honestly, if you ask me, she’s way too good for his dorky self, but there’s no accounting for taste.”
also, idk why I keep making references to the wizard of oz in this. it just happened. it's not my fault that its a popular story about someone winding up in a strange new world and trying to find their way home.
if you were asking him. He dropped into the booth beside Cas and slung an arm around his shoulders before pressing a soft kiss to his cheek.
"My name is Dean Winchester. I'm an Aquarius, I enjoy sunsets, long walks on the beach but of course right now I'm so very much single and no one to take with those walks. and I'm working as an automobile engineer, I have my own home, half an hour far from here if you go by car, and I'm Bi, and prefer.."
"Actually I'm feeling better Sweetheart, all thanks to you, normally it's not ending this much soon. It normally stays for a whole day, but somehow because of you, it's getting controlled quickly" He said like a little kid.
"Oh, I forget about it. Huh, right, right, This is all about him, isn't it?" Dean said laughing but Sam is sure he was so pissed.
"Um, Cas, how are you feeling now? You okay?" Dean asked. there was a sincere and caring look on his face. But Cas didn't meet his eyes when he answered him.
Dean groans when he feels Cas sneaking his hand back and take his hard, throbbing cock out, touching the angry mushroom head.
"You can hit me as much as you want Omega, but I want you to know that I Love You" Dean says it barely and Cas hits on Dean's mouth as he collapses on the floor.
"Actually then you came to my life and THAT happened around us, you made me laugh, and here we are talking. and believe it or not, you had fixed me and I really feel better now. Maybe more than, if I talked with Sammy, please don't tell him that though" Dean chuckled.
Meanwhile, Dean tries to pull down his pants too, struggling with his waistband But Cas's brain starts to works again just in time as he pushes Dean as much as he can because Dean doesn't see that coming. because he is concentrating on his pants. So Dean throws back a few steps with that. Cas takes that chance as he starts to running away from Dean towards their bedroom as much as speed he can. His face is hurting, his neck is hurting, hell his whole heart is hurting like a bitch. But he doesn't want Dean to do something they can't get back from the regret or they can't forget ever. So he runs, he runs as fast as he can. But Dean is seeing red as he also runs chasing Cas like a wild dog.
"Castiel, what's the matter, we just here to check on you, coz we saw you are not ok, you like you are not okay, just as Charlie said here"
The voice came in very low and small as Castiel almost didn't recognize the voice. On other hand, this is the first time he heard that said voice through a phone call.
"Shit" Sam cursed and quickly go to bring the mop to clean the floor. But Destiny is always has strange plans. So this is a moment like that as Castiel came with the huge bowl of leftover gravy. And he actually didn't see the big dollop of source on the floor as he put his foot on the slippery, wet surface and suddenly an unexpected yell came from him and with that he slipped and fell on the floor with a huge thud. Unfortunately, the gravy bowl completely spilled all over him in the next second making everything worse.
"Damn baby don't do that, you don't know what you doing this to me when you blushes like that, I'm gonna eat you alive" Dean groaned.
"Woah, Woah easy there tiger, I didn't do anything to him, ask him if you want" Dean burst out angrily pointing at Cas. Sam glared at Dean before giving his full attention to Cas with an apologizing face.
Dean Winchester is a mean cook. But he wasn't normally cooking or bake because he didn't want to drag old dark memories back. And also he was the owner of a company so obviously, he was too busy cooking. but to be honest he loved cooking and baking. And he knew it's a good way to express love to someone. So after thinking for hours, finally he decided to bake a little thing for Castiel. For saying sorry and also asking him out.
"Well, when I came to this library today, I caught up this loverboy here, staring at Castiel, he was kinda stalking him" Azazel gave an evil smile at Dean. His mouth was swollen by Dean's punch and already have a purple and swollen eye.
"And I made it myself" Dean kept dragging old memories and Cas felt it's starting to trigger some unwanted memories. He started to breathe heavily wishing Dean will stop talking.
Dean started to unwrap the brown paper quickly and Cas can see now a plastic-wrapped something. Something like a sandwich.
Cas was ready to end his work when he finally checks his phone. happiness glowed inside him as soon as he saw a text from Dean's number. Even he was thinking about Dean at the same moment. So he started to text with Dean the next second.
"I will leave your hands if you promise that you are going to stay in this table," Dean said like a child. Why in the hell Dean making this so hard. What kind of game he is going to play now.
Cas decided to get some lunch from the cafeteria today as he slowly walked into the cafeteria. He was deciding what will he got, when he felt someone blew air into his neck, causing him to jump out with a gasp.
"So is that how you got separated right? Now I remember" He said checking his face carefully to try to get any information from him.
Cas turns redder as he mewls into Dean's dirty words. Dean fucks and fucks Cas's beautiful but now well-used and redded tits as he feels his orgasm keep rising again. Cas's pussy keeps leaking with juice as the whole room fills with the sweet smell of his slick. Dean's mouth-watering and he stops fucking. He eagerly kisses Cas's waiting lips then slowly lets go of Cas's lips and presses his sweaty forehead against Castiel’s. Both are still closing their eyes.
Suddenly Cas cries and whales as Dean feels a hot warm slick pouring from inside Cas's pussy, hot juice fills in and dripping out of Cas's pussy even Dean repeatedly fucks into it, now with Cas's hot cum, it's coming as a wet and sloppy sound of every thrust.
"You little shit, you are such pain of ass, do you know your presence can destroy an anything? Huh? you are a useless, weak, broken, empty, not wanting, not cared, fucking piece of shit. you are nothing"
"Of course Mr. Winchester, normally people give this much of red roses for their loved ones, that's obvious" Castiel's heart was very itchy, but why?.
“ oh, ok, and mam can I go home now please, I think I’m feeling good now" Castiel asked trying to sit up. He had to go home, he didn't want to drag Gabriel to this. Hell didn't want to Gabriel get into these things.
“okkkk… I promise we will wait and watch 3  days, happy? Now can I kiss you? Dean says with a fake angry voice.
Dean was also awakened by that deep, sexy voice. And oh yes his anger started to rice again over that damn vegan eggnog.
"Dean, finally you are home, listen Clarence had called mom a few minutes ago" Sam beamed as a child and Dean rolled his eyes.
The call connected and started to ring on other side. Castiel waited and waited and his heart was hurting now, then he released a breathe he never knew he was holding until now. With that call go to the voice mail. Castiel didn't want to put a message as he ended the call with a disappointed face. He was thinking about whether call back or not when his phone started to ringing making him jump.
"No, it's fine Sam.. I'm fine" Cas interrupted him but not looking at him. Finally.. This isn't a trap or Sam isn't broken his trust. Cas feels his panic is shading away quickly. He thanks god as Sam came to him at just the right time.
Dean was top of the Castiel but didn't put his weight on him as his elbows were bracketed Cas protectively. Dean didn't pull out from Cas yet and Both lovers started to laugh their ass off as Cas wiped tears out of his eyes.
Cas smiles shyly before putting a hand on Dean's chest stopping him to walk into his personal space.
“Hurting you? Fuck. Then what you think you did to me when you sleep with another man behind me, huh? Maybe… maybe that asshole fucked you here… on my own room… my own bed. I trusted you, you whore, tell me who the fuck Benny is? I’m gonna give him a real treat, then I’m gonna kick your Ass too, coz I don’t need you anymore, you slut”
"Oh god, yes Dean, yes there, there.. Oh god oh godddd,, please harder oh my god" Cas mewls and whines licking his lips unconsciously.
In the evening Cas came home early but Dean messages him to inform him that he will be late because he got a meeting in the office.
"Aww sweetie, that's so sweet of you, I'm sure Cas would be fine with that then," Mary said as Sam also nodded at that.
Cas took a sip from the hot coffee, it's really warm and tasty. It's made Cas's whole body warm in second and it's felt really wonderful.
Castiel seems like he has no problem with that and he also always agree with anything his best friend saying.
And for Dean's wonder, this is the first time he saw Castiel when he is drunk or tipsy. Because Castiel never going to any party and of course he has never been even near to a drinking person or a place so no wonder about that. But here now that's happening as Dean can't take his eyes away from Castiel.
"Klaus and Caroline, Castiel and Oliver" Dean almost jerked up with the shock but he barely hold himself giving shocked eyes to his teacher.
"Oh, he is Coming," Gabriel said and he saw Dean and his face brighten quickly. Gabriel went and hugged Dean.
"Wha.. Jeez No. Man are you serious right now? No, I'm not planning to kill you I was trying to apologize here, okay? " Dean burst out immediately.
"Yeah of course you do, you have your pathetic excuse to cover your sad dumb ass. Cassie, look I'm worrying about you okay? I know you like Dean, but I don't know why you keep pushing him away, I mean give the man a chance" Castiel tried to say something but Gabriel held his hand sign to wait.
"Yeah... Ok, ok, so then in the morning, the kid made us breakfast too. And it was delicious Mom, you should have been here I'm telling you, god it was good" Dean said acting dramatically as Mary stopped her work and turned to face Dean with a questioning look.
"Then why is he not waking up yet? And he is so weak, look at his chest, he is breathing very hardly" King John questions with his angry voice.
"Oh Castiel, we know that because of this stupid boy here didn't know that, me and Sam both aware that who you. you told us. that you are Castiel, as soon as you came here. and we never think that you are a liar or a cheater" Mary assured and Castiel nodded at Mary.
"Dean, finally. I searched for you everywhere hey you wanna join with me?" Castiel asked showing his empty table.
Castiel hang up and then quickly went home. Since he confirmed the dinner plan, his heart was filled with different, different feelings. But mostly he felt happy and he liked it. He wanted to feel often that happy feeling. He sighed and quickened his steps.
"You know little bro you are a number one idiot. man, seriously? People broke up, they leave, they come back, it's human nature. people change, but that's not the fact, the real game is to find the best one who really wants to be with us whatever happened. and to find the matching person. If they match they will stay or not they will leave, but the thing is you have to try, then you can figure out. but you can't just hold on your life because of what happened to your family member's love life or your friend's love life, they are absolutely different from each other" Gabriel explained.
"Whatever, can't you find any other table to sit at?" He asked even he knew it's not a fair thing to ask from another student. But in this case, they should not sit at the same table, when there are a lot more empty and long tables were there.
"Okay, then have some drink. please help yourself, there are Coke, beer, and some soda are in the fridge, oh and some lemonade too. it's your first day in my home and please at least have some drink please, because unfortunately, I'm not in a situation to serve you any other way" Dean said sadly, but a mouth full of food.
Cas just ducked his head because he didn't want to say anything or try to give him an explanation of what really happened last night because he already said everything last night.
"Ahhhhhh, Dean... Mmmmm you are so unsatisfying, what if we caught up when your lips around my nipples, they will kill you right here Dean"
"What? Nothing. You are so ridiculous. It's not sad face Dean, just you know" Castiel said looking everywhere but Dean. Because he afraid if Dean read his mind.
"No Dean, I was never been your friend, I'm sorry I lied," Castiel's voice came very weakly and bit his already heavily damaged lips to hold his cry and failed as he started sobbing.
"Um, we were cleaning the table and accidentally I slipped and this gravy bowl spilled on me, then Mary said to get a shower because I was stinking so much, but when I was going to Sam's bathroom when he screamed and told me it was broken. Then he asked me to come here, but believe me, I didn't want to, I really didn't want to, please don't be angry, I'm so sorry, Sam said you are at your friend's house, that's why finally I agreed to use your bathroom. But please don't angry with Sam. He was just helping me, fault is mine, please don't scold him" Cas was a babbling mess as Dean staring at him without blinking.
They said goodbye to Castiel and Dean didn't even look at them. only waited outside with a huge scowl on his face. Mary gave Castiel a sweet kiss on his cheek and hugged him dearly. Sam also pulled him into a bear hug and promise to visit him soon again.
"Hey handsome, finally remember me?" Lisa said in a sexy way and Dean laughed at that. Dean didn't waste a second before wrap his hand around Lisa's tiny waist and Lisa gasped dramatically leaning towards Dean.
Soon after they cleaned the dinner table together and the dishes are done, Gabe and Sam were layed in couch having a food coma. That made Dean and Castiel alone in the kitchen.
"Okay, we know you are not a kid but Mom.." Dean didn't complete what he was gonna say as he saw his mom keep glaring at him.
"Because I know you are very much single right now and you don't have any boyfriend for a while now. and I noticed that Mr.Winchester also ignored you, he also left you right? I'm really sorry about that hun" Anna said poutine a bit.
"No seriously Dean, what's the problem? You know you can talk to me about anything right?" Sam asked this time seriously as Dean released a heavy breath.
"No Mary actually this one boy from College who's used to bullying me, just drove over a huge mud puddle over me" Castiel just said everything because he was angry.
Okay, now Castiel's alarm went ring and Castiel couldn't think what to say to this weird man in front of him. But he hated himself for beaming inside, for knowing this bouquet was for him. Dean hasn't any girlfriend. This is for him. Wow. But why I'm happy about that. He is supposed to act like he is pissed. Gather yourself, Novak. Acting like you are not interested.
"Hi, bathroom stealer" Cas gasped and turned as the voice came from very near to his face. Of course, it's Dean and Cas was speechless for a second because Dean was in his personal space already.
"No Mary that's the truth, and, and I'm so sorry Mary. And Dean.. I'm sorry for every, for using your room, for taking your clothes, and for making your mom slaps you, I'm so sorry please don't hate me more, please" Dean was just staring at the poor kid, just opened and closed his mouth few times but words didn't come out.
The way they became friends. Dean is a lovesick puppy and Castiel has trust issues. But however Cas got to know Dean is not that bad.
So now Dean was in the super market finding the vegan eggnog. And right now Dean was glaring at sales assistance, because he wasn't vegan, never will be. So he didn't know where the vegan stuff was and he got lost good 15 minutes walking around the aisles and still didn't found that fucking vegan eggnog.
"Will you be my Valentine? He burst out and then he understood that he popped a wrong question. As Castiel started to giggle.
Castiel shivers with that memory. What if Dean tried to say the truth. No, no way, he is just a cunning alpha. I will find the truth soon. He determines quietly as Gabriel continues his answer.
"hmm No Dean, I didn't, after we discussed that day about a idea of having a little baby girl, I stopped it Dean and I really have a hope about today. Cas said and Dean couldn't stop him as he Smiled hugely and Kissed his lovely, sweet Husband passionately.
As he spoke, Dean started to dig through the first aid kit to pull out the supplies he needed, and Cas found it easier to unbutton his sleeve and pull it up as far as he needed when there was little risk of Dean immediately noticing. Maybe he could retain a
“You’d think he’d walked in on us enough times to know better than to enter a room without knocking now.”
i'm planning on writing (and thus likely posting) tomorrow morning instead of tomorrow evening so I can dedicate the entire day/arvo/evening to my school work, so don't be surprised if it seems like there's been two updates in one day for some of y'all, timezones be whacky
To the surprise of approximately no-one, Dean had only been in the kitchen for about 10 minutes when he felt a familiar pair of arms wrap around his waist and a chin hook over his shoulder.
oh also me and mum just watched the s3 coven ep today (and also the dreams ep) and I'm so mad that people got angry abt ruby as she is a Vibe and i don't like that the writers had to make her evil. although lbr she probably would've died anyway because she's ~female~
stealing a quick kiss). They rearranged themselves so that Dean’s head was resting on Cas’ shoulder, and he immediately spotted the women Cas had been talking about.
“It took you several years to realise I held romantic feelings for you, even though I felt they were fairly clear. Am I not obvious enough in my affections?”
“Look, it won’t be as bad as you’re thinking. You can sit on the back of my broom, and I won’t take you very far off the ground.”
(Ultimately, all his planning ends up being useless. Turns out, carefully constructed love confessions fly out the window when your hindbrain takes over and you end up jumping the intended target of said confessions in the kitchen one morning.)
The portrait was extremely flattering, but Dean hadn’t expected anything less. Portraits of nobility usually where, the best attributes of the subject brought into the limelight while any less desirable ones were ignored. He’d have no way of knowing how much artistic license had been taken with Castiel’s visage until they formally met, in however many months it took for the wedding arrangements and negotiations to be fully completed. He expected there had to have been
i've been traipsing erratically from fandom to fandom over the past few days so i might end up fully back in spn before we even start watching again lmao, we'll have to see.
read an a/n in a fic today that essentially said 'i've decided whether or not to give this character a redemption arc in this fic, and I'm sorry in advance. btw if I brutally kill someone off do you think I need to up the rating?' just in slightly different words (their words had the Same Vibe tho there were just more of them) and I'm still not recovered
The man turned, key still unturned in his lock, and his look of confusion was swapped for a blinding grin when their eyes met.
“I also have trouble navigating the formalities expected in situations such as this, and small talk can be difficult at times. At least we have… A lot of time to get to know each other in the future.”
I had baby feels today. obviously. but I also had no thought head empty feels tonight. so this doesn't feel quite complete
Dean thought, but he left the words unsaid. They seemed too fragile and fraught with emotion to be heard out loud.
They weren’t alone on the beach, and noises from the various other resort guests filtered across to them, but a bubble of peace enveloped them anyway.
“That seems sensible,” he agreed, before glancing down at the clothes he was wearing. “However, I should probably change into a more appropriate outfit first. May we meet in 10 or so minutes?"
“Uh— I’m guessing you don’t wanna talk about how the project was today?” Sam asked hesitantly, eying Dean as he huffed into their shared kitchen.
Chaps 167, 168, 169, 178, 192, 198, 205, 215, 221, 237— sometimes people b flirting with cas or dean even when the other is standing Right There
When Castiel first started having the dreams, the primary emotion he felt was probably best labelled as confusion.
It wasn’t all a struggle, though. Jimmy was okay with checking out for the evening to let them have dates, even if he couldn’t guarantee he’d sleep the whole way through them, and Cas was a lot freer with his affection on those nights, which spilled over to Dean.
“Benny! Me and Castiel were hoping to get some fresh air tonight, will you keep it quiet that we’ve both come out here if anyone asks?”
i havent been nice to my hair lately and I've had to comb it this evening,,,, not fun kdfhjdlhg its all one big knot lol
gonna worry, Cas, you should know that by now. And it’ll be much more difficult for you to treat the cut yourself than it would be for me to check it out for you.”
we got the photos of the house done and i again did not get enough work done on my assignments (why can't i fucking w o r k this week)
Jack had tried calling Cas back a couple of times, but he wouldn’t come. He obviously knew Dean wouldn’t be there, and wasn’t ready to face him yet. Which was fine! Dean understood how hard it must’ve been for Cas to tell him everything, and his speech and sacrifice were both probably more recent to Cas than they were to Dean due to time fuckery.
“That didn’t seem to stop the Inquisitor from giving Jace the position when his true heritage was revealed, so
so theres a lot more to this but I'm nervous finishing it will take longer than I think (although unlikely, i defs expect to get it posted tonight) so I'm posting the start here lol
It didn’t help that Dean couldn’t be the one to pull him out, that the ritual they had used had needed Sammy to be the one who actually physically went and got Cas— it had meant Dean lost that chance to reciprocate those feelings in a situation where Cas couldn’t avoid him, was instead forced to try and corner the angel as best he could in the bunker.
' (disclaimer u can absolutely cuddle a best friend in bed in the mornings etc and have it b platonic but when that thought is accompanied by Pining and Yearning its a hm mayb not just platonic thing)
“I just caught a stomach bug at work,” he started, and Dean nodded in understanding. Before he could continue, though, Dean’s phone lit up with a call, and he grimaced in apology when he saw it was Sammy.
“And I thought you might’ve been another resurrectionist planning on selling his body, and used it as a cover so that I didn’t think you were moving in on my ground, or whatever.”
anyway there was something else i wanted to say today but i cannot remember currently, so rip. it probably wasn't important lol
realised my friend update yesterday was very vague but basically she wants to take some time to "think about what [she] actually want[s]" which is like. fuck I sure have been investing more emotional energy into this friendship than she has huh.
“Look, we can’t change how I found out, and I’m gonna stay mad at you over it for a little while. This
dean is like hmst im bi but my dad sucks. mainly musing about elephants in the room. don't question me im babey and tired
“Well that’s good— Isn’t it? You seem. Stressed. Did— well. Did Castiel do something again? You could’ve asked about swapping groups at the start of the project, you know.”
The third time Dean sees Prince Castiel Novak, it is a week before their wedding. The Novak family and a few select nobles had travelled to the Winchester’s palace in advance, in order to ensure the wedding was being held in a manner that was favourable to both kingdoms, and Dean had found himself pushed to the wayside by his family. Because apparently having
also. me, who updated my bnha chat fic for the first time in a year and a half using ideas that I came up with in the middle of last year, after having had the doc open again for almost a week on my computer, and having written the entire chapter in one day despite that: oh I could like, consider weekly or fortnightly updates for this probably?? That’d work yeah???
“I’m not saying we should give up! God knows we have far too many more books to look through for that to be something we should consider yet. Just— a small break for something other than sleeping or cooking. I don’t think dedicating yourself with the intensity that you have been is healthy. Go to the bar for a few hours, or watch something on Netflix.”
Even after getting Cas out, after they’ve had their fairy-tale reunion and embarked on their happily ever after, Dean feels constantly on edge. It’s like he’s waiting for things to go to shit again, for Chuck to come out of the shadows and reveal he’s
wrote my best friend a message explaining I've been struggling w our friendship this year so I'm a lil panicky right now,,,,, they're online on discord but have not responded as of me starting this update and I'm not gonna check for another 30ish mins sooooooo ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
He’d been fairly clear with the whole ‘no need for connections’ thing, after all, and there wasn’t really any other explanation for Dean’s soulmate situation. He’d been dreaming about a blue-eyed man for about a year, he met said man in a barn, he then mentally acknowledged that said man was his soulmate, and the dreams stopped. It was a textbook example of a soulmate meeting, provided you ignored the whole ‘angel of the lord’ thing.
Considering the amount of time he and Sammy had been confused as a couple over the years, he’d thought things would be…
update a couple of my neglected aus (and I'm planning on updating more after today) + this isn't the coffee shop au or in any way connected to being a college au.
Chaps 46-52, 73, 75, 107, 141, 177, 181, 195, 213, 233— dean is like damn can’t believe I have a husband and he loves me (not a cont of the mini-golf date lol)
“I feel like you are approaching this from the wrong end of things, in some ways. Rather than focusing on why you struggle with PDA specifically, you should instead try to overcome the general barriers towards affection you put up in your mind even when you are in private. Once you are more comfortable with non-sexual intimacy as a whole, it will be easier for you to engage in those acts while in public.”
got one of those earphone jack adaptors for iphones yesterday, finally being able to use my wired earphones with my phone again is so nice sfhadjba
Dean’s eyes widened, and his pulse quickened even though their Dad was dead and gone and the incident was years old now.
Dean didn’t know why he was so nervous to bring up the idea of looking into their adoption options to Cas. They’d
a revelation was how deeply he’d found himself falling for the ridiculous man, even knowing that Cas would likely never care for him in the same way. How could he
Some days, he felt like he was living with the ghost of his father peering over his shoulder, judging his every move. Some days, he’d notice any disdainful looks they got while walking through a town, and his first instinct would be to drop Cas’ hand and move to put some distance between them. Some days, Cas would look at him with that gummy smile, and Dean would send him a forced grin back while fighting the clench of his heart that said there was something wrong with the love he felt for the ex-angel.
As he spoke, Cas brought his hand up to rub at his eyes in an incredibly human gesture, forgetting his forearm was uncovered in his frustration at his own inability to explain things with any modicum of ease. It wasn’t until he heard the clatter of the antiseptic hitting the floor that he realised what he’d just done.
“We’ve been looking this whole time for ways to like, physically pull Cas out of the empty, right? To get him out of the deal, or trick the Empty, or just summon him back to this earthly plane, you know the deal.”
Which is why, when he first realised that all those assumptions he’d spent bracing for and denying with Sammy
“Why would we, Dean? We don’t exactly have souls, and we do not have a need for fulfilling connections the way humans do.”
And though he’d been right about the exhibits themselves not being interesting to him, watching Cas’ expression as they wandered through became a form of entertainment in and of itself— the particular frown that meant historians had gotten a key detail wrong, the smile that crossed his face when he recognised an artifact or story from his time as an angel.
There were a few things they needed to double-check, still, but if all went well... then Cas would be home within the fortnight.
They hadn’t had a very taxing week, not in the slightest. These days, their lives were filled with mundane things. Grocery shopping and home improvement efforts and beekeeping, with maybe the occasional call from someone who thought a couple of erstwhile hunters would have the advice needed to get them out of a tight spot. Things were good,
Dean had known this day was to come for years now, even if he hadn’t known the exact details. Love matches were uncommon in royalty, and he’d never harboured any illusions that he would be able to form his own. He just wished he’d gotten to meet the guy he was to spend the rest of his life with in-person, before all the stress and formality that would come with their ceremony surrounding their nuptials. But he didn’t exactly get a choice in these things.
"Hey Winchester, how you doing man?" Suddenly Dean heard Azazel's demonic voice as he started gritting his teeth.
"Dean, you did it again, you ate the desert alone, which was supposed to eaten by all of us, obviously AFTER the dinner, and of course after the service first our special guest" Mary said with a glare.
Next second Dean's shoulder grabbed and pulled by a strong hand and both of the kids parted suddenly and they got scared with that.
"What No, eww, it's been years and I don't want to even remember his name, and I don't name that as love, I didn't love him, never. actually, I didn't love anyone in my life if I being honest. just a few datings that's it" Castiel shrugged.
Dean asks as Cas quickly holds his tits together just like Dean asks to because he is so curious to see what will it feels like.
"Hey baby, I'm so sorry for the late" Gabe said and Sam leaned and pressed a peck on Gabriel's lips then hugged him.
Castiel helped Gabriel to ready to the bed before settled him for the night. Then he poured him some wine and leaned on his couch. The couch is kinda very comfy and he didn't want to go to bed yet even it's almost late at night. He sipped his wine glass slowly. it's felt very nice and Castiel just laid there with his very comfortable bees pajamas. Okay, but the truth was he just needed some peace okay? But his heart was stubborn and forced him to think about the absence of the Dean more and more.
"Okay, great. so you want to make it up to me, right? Okay, cool. Then if you really want that, I will tell you how you should do that, okay? You only have to do a simple thing. Just pretend like I'm invisible" Cas's pissed-off voice came out like a fire as Dean just staring at Cas with a sad face.
"Winchester, afternoon, I was just having fun here," Azazel said with a calm and teasing voice with a smirk on his face making Dean angrier.
"Sweetheart, are you kidding me right now? I was always dying to eat something made by your hands, just give it to me please?" Dean burst out and Castiel felt a relief. He nodded enthusiastically as Dean pulled out from their long hug a bit hesitantly.
"Yeah um you know was a bit busy with stuff," Dean said awkwardly but inside his brain, something felt not okay. He didn't know what was that.
"What can I say Cas, even I didn't know I can flirt like this until I see you, and I hope when we meet next time you will call me Dean"
"Now, how about we all have our little dinner because I want you to eat something soon Castiel," Mary said cupping his teary cheeks smiling at him.
Dean glance over the boy who was on the floor eyes full of fear. Castiel cursed himself for his stupidity. Why in the hell I'm always ended up with these douchebags. God help me. Castiel prayed as he didn't even try to stand up as he was prepared for anything Winchester going to throw at him.
"Cas, jeez. I'm... I'm not.. God, I don't hate you, well, not anymore if I say, and why are you so hard to convince something? why can't you just listen to someone when he is trying his ass off to talk to you about something?" Dean forget about where they were as his voice went high without even knowing. Few students glanced over them and Dean ignored those nerds but understand he was yelling now. And Castiel's eyes were big and filled with unsecured and shock. Shit shit shit.. Dean cursed himself for making Castiel upset again. He knew he screwed again but he wanted to try again so he took a huge breath.
"U'motherfucker" Dean tried to punch him again but Michael and Uriel grabbed Dean and tried to keep him away from Raphael, who suddenly go few steps back from him and make sure not to talk anymore.
Fine. Dean wanted to forget everything for a bit. He got four months, he can figure out what and how to do this later. But now he really wanted to get laid.
Dean pinches Cas's one nipple, sucking on his bottom lips. Cas mewls into Dean's lips softly wrapping his hands around his lover's neck.
Castiel barely smiled back staring at Dean's kind and beautiful green eyes. And when Castiel's eyes ran down to the huge wet patch on Dean's shirt near his shoulder, Castiel gasped. It didn't take much time for him to understand what was that. There was a gentle area that got wet and half of it becomes dry but the mark was still there.
"I don't know Gabe and I don't want to think about that, maybe it would be a bet, or maybe he just lost a bet so he had to sleep with me or some nerd guy as the bet. so I'm his brother's Executive Assistant and a nerd too, so who knows he chose me as the easiest victim"
Then next second, "Not yet" He burst out, smirking at Dean who's eyes rolled back and head tipped backward to follow them.
"Okay, okay I will stop making you blush, otherwise I couldn't able to hold myself anymore," Dean said smoothly.
"Dean, but how in the world you get to know that Gabe is a sweet tooth? I can't understand that. I mean you both officially introduced to each other yesterday. So it's kind of impossible" Castiel asked before getting a bit from his burger.
"Shut the fucking mouth of yours, tell me how someone prove that he is not gay boy, by fucking another gay boy" He yelled.
"Get off me Dean, or I would kiss you right here, right now, so be careful and get off," Castiel said.
Castiel started his day promising himself that he wouldn't act like a child or lovesick teenager but screwing his plan Donna drop the first bomb as she goes.
"I'm not a smartass Winchester, and you don't need to act stupid too. Obviously, you can go somewhere else and go home later as you drop me my home as Mary asked you to. That's not magic" Castiel answered and Dean glared at him for a second. This stubborn nerd is something else. Isn't he? Dean groaned before answering him.
First, Castiel thought he just heard a guitar sound, and he just didn't care about that thinking it must be some phone ringing tone. But then he heard chords of a guitar, in somewhere really close. Then he heard a few girl's screams as he rolled his eyes.
"Okay, then at least let me take you to your home. Because you can't stay like this Dean. This is very uncomfortable to you" Castiel begged to lean into his eyes again. Dean just staring at him more.
"Dean, what are you doing, please don't say things like that, you can't say those things in here, you know that," Cas says like a helpless bunny, and his beautiful, innocent face already turns red.
Okay, this is getting weird. Cas lost the count of how many times Dean offered lifts for this month. And it does not seem fine.
"Castiel was lost in Dean for a second as he was staring at Dean's beautiful eyes but suddenly very excited puppy jumped to Dean's face and started lick his whole left eye earning a surprised yelp from Dean.
"None taken Sam. and yes I agree. Castiel, this is the best pie I have ever had too, you have gifted hands son, really" Mary said without hesitation and smiling at him genuinely.
"Babe, I'm really sorry but just give me a second, it's from the office and it must be an emergency, I will end it soon" Cas begs after checking the caller ID.
Castiel was stunned by his own voice as he never ever thought to say it loud. He was just thinking about it and then it slips out of his mouth.
They worked together Castiel got to know that Dean is a good cook and Dean understand Castiel is very good at cooking too. They mingled easily, helping each other handing stuff and it was quite very comfortable with dealing with each other. Finally, Castiel decided Dean is not an assbutt like he thought earlier.
"Leave my hand Winchester, I already apologize but on the other hand I can say you the same because you even didn't see me coming, so are you blind too?" With that Castiel yanked his hand away from Dean's death grip. And next second he started to run. He heard Dean cursed and other's laugh. Castiel felt he is getting a panic but he started to whisper it's okay, it's okay, you are okay, nothing happens to you, like a mantra while he  was running.
"Cas please take it, baby," Dean said with puppy eyes, and Cas sighed looking at him for seconds, and then he took the bag from Dean.
"poor nerd he must be thinking he is better than Winchester " "Show who's the man Dean" "Yeah kick his ass man"
Cas screams while trying to untangle Dean's death grip on his neck as he felt his breath hitches. His face turns pale within a second like the paper-white make-up of his face because of the sudden fear. his heart hammers in his chest as that fear paralyzes him for a minute.
"Look, I got to practice today, and after that can I crash into your place? Just like the old days? Can we have a sleepover, I mean I'm okay with your parent's guest room" Dean said quietly ducking his head.
"No, you are not going along. Dean, do you mind giving a lift Castiel here?" Suddenly Mary asked Dean.
"Dude I never ever see you babbling like this about any human being in your life, are you in love or something like that?" He snorted. But never expected something like Dean gave him as the answer.
"Hey Winchester what's happening around you, you just ran out like a crazy dog last day, and even after you came back, then you have gone without hanging out" Alastair shouted at Dean when the football team saw Dean came near to the his locker.
"NO. Winchester... what.. What are you.. NO, NO.. stop" Castiel tried to stop him patting his hands. And Dean stopped smirking at him.
the whole class started to vibrate with "boo's" as Mrs.Pamela gave a sharp look all around the class
"Yeah but however, still you should have informed me about this earlier Sam, even.." Suddenly Dean cutoff by Sam.
Dean said goodbye to Gabriel before he leaves. Cas felt a different kind of feeling right after Dean left his home like he is already missing Dean. But at the same time, he questioned himself that is he ready to date this wonderful man, without getting terrified. And surprising him his heart didn't against him. Okay, it's a great update so Cas felt happy. Maybe Dean will keep his promise. He will really take care of him. Maybe this is his destiny and he deserves to be happy after all. And what about all of his heartbroken siblings, cousins, and friends? Yeah, maybe Cas had to talk with them again about what happened. And where their problems are and how should he not getting those problems into his personal life. Yeah, he should definitely do that if he wants to, not lose this wonderful man. So Cas determined to call them to have a little talk with them as he signed happily.
With that they were going to go to the hospital, Castiel's mind worked quickly and next second he found himself taking to the lady paramedic.
"I will bring them" Castiel went outside to bring the bag full of leftovers and locked the door behind him.
"Can't promise on anything right now baby" Dean murmurs while pressing his tongue more deeply into his slit as Cas screams loudly.
After the first day of reunion with Castiel, Dean couldn't stop thinking about him. Dean sure Castiel also very happy to see him again. But the problem was Dean knew in deep down he can't be more visible about how much he is happy to see Castiel or to be with him. Because he knew he can't control himself when he saw Castiel.
Cas also got shocked, because he knew that, normally Dean does care for Sam so much. He never shouts at his little brother like this. So Cas really got shocked and he didn't like, Dean and Sam start any fight over him. He should leave soon as possible. But then again he heard Dean's surprised voice.
"Stop talking about him, you will never say his name on this house again and he is not your best friend. See now you lost your school your football team and all other your friends, why? All because of that stupid boy, right? He is the reason for your bad behavior and because of that even you are now grounded, no playing no going to the park, no camping trip with me, no fishing lessons nothing, all of your favorite things lost because of that boy. So is he still your best friend? " John stated and poor Dean's little mind had to accept that is true. He was in deep thinking, his mind twisted by John and Dean only saw what John had shown him. And he believed his daddy.
Dean smirked and waited until they go and close the door.he went to his room thinking about a warm bath. He had football practice in the afternoon so he got more time to kill. He can play a video game or maybe watch some movies until then.
"Okay then, that's enough for today, you go and get some rest, and don't forget to inform me if something bothers you okay?" Michael says and Raphael jovially ruffles Cas's hair.
"Thank you, for finally giving me a chance," He said as Castiel opened his eyes. He pulled out slowly and Dean started to miss the warmth of his body already.
So here we go, please be kind enough to say something to me about the chapter. It's okay to tell anything you want. You can even tell me if there are any errors 😇😊
"Now Mr. Winchester if you don't mind can you please move away then I can cook again," Castiel said teasingly.
It's being a month since Castiel started taking care of his injured brother as Gabriel also living in Castiel's home. And also it's being a month since Castiel asked for more time from Dean, and Dean accepted it from his whole heart. But even how many times Castiel asked to stop, Dean didn't stop wooing him or Courting him as he brought different types of gifts for the whole month as usual way.
"Okay, okay then it's okay, we can stay like this as much as you want after we will eat okay, I want you to eat something as soon as possible"
"Tell me now you fucker, did I kissed you? Huh, say it? Say it you motherfucker? Or you want more?" Dean hit another deadly punch on Castiel's head and Castiel just fell on the floor unconsciously. He can't open his eyes they are soaked with tears and blood. He tried and slowly opened his eyes. Dean's face was still angry. His best friends, his ex-best friend's handsome face, who was supposed to hugging now tightly and soothing him saying he is gonna be okay, Dean... Yes, Dean was just standing there ready to hit him more.
"Oh Dean thank you, thank you very much, you are a great man, a great friend. I don't know how to thank you Dean" Castiel said pressing his lips tightly over Dean's shoulder. Dean was holding him to his chest tightly. Dean's hand repeatedly stroking Castiel's hair in a soothing manner.
And then Cas slowly started to get up from Dean's body and soon he understood his towel was broken. If he stands up or getup a bit more like this, Dean will see him without any cloth, fully naked. Shit, that can't happen. No, No, no way.
"Okay, okay I'm gonna go before you call the security just like you was going to do in the morning, and Cas I really want you to know something"
"Heyya Cas, how was your day sweetheart?" He gave his best innocent smile while standing up and walking toward him hugging a precious little bundle of cuteness to his chest.
“Wow, it’s over, Yes! It's already morning. I knew it, thank God now I don’t want to meet a psychiatrist” Dean is beaming and he buries his face in his lover’s neck and nuzzles there.
Dean's inner Alpha groans at that and starts to nibble and lick on Cas's mating gland more, rubbing it with his thumb meanwhile grinding his large and hard cock between Cas's ass cheeks.
Dean's cock is huge and thick and right now it is so hungry for Cas's hole as he slowly bottoms up. Dean gives Cas a moment, but he can't hold on anymore as slowly starts to pumps into Cas's wet heats.
"Yeah of course never thought we both meet at the same college after years. So, Dean how are you, I did wonder sometimes where would you live and how you doing, coz I didn't see you after the elementary school"
"GET OUT DEAN" with that Dean understand what he was doing and he jumped back and closed the door the next second.
Dran brought some coffee and a water bottle for Cas. But Cas didn't drink coffee only drank a little bit of water.
"Let me see, ah I saw this one on this rack, wait Sam I'll check," Mary said and turned to the other side to find what she wants to get, Sam also came behind her pushing the grocery cart with him, but Suddenly Mary stopped and signed Sam to stop too. Her surprised face aimed towards the few racks ahead.
"Okay okay man just let me finish okay? I know he must be so upset, but I was just tried to tell you that he is the one who not facing the problem. Jeez, I wanted to calm you down. And definitely, I also care about him a lot. He is my friend too okay?" Sam said very calmly. And then he started again.
They stayed another half hour there and then Doctor came with a happy smile on his face. All of them ran toward him and Dean was holding Castiel tightly even he knew Doctor is going to say good news.
"Cas please, stop saying that, you are lying, yes, yes, you are lying" Dean's voice starts to get like babble and tears starts to flow through his face, surprising himself.
After few minutes Dean stops his crying and screams, he is holding on to his lover tightly, and close his eyes tight. he just wants to calm himself down, always Cas is his cue, so Dean stays still there.
"Aw Cassie, "Nothing happened to my face Gabe, just a bit tired", huh? I knew something going on with you the second I saw your face Lil bro, you can't hide anything from me. And holy shit man this is the hugest and beautiful red rose bundle I have ever seen. now shoot me, who's the guy? Who's the secret admirer?" Gabriel asked wiggling his eyebrows.
"I.. I just wanted to hear your voice Cas. And yes I'm now feeling better Angel. Thank you. Good night Cas" Dean said his voice came completely sad and small. Like he is gonna cry anytime. Shit, shit, shit Dean is not okay. He is sick. It's clicked to Castiel's head like a flash. He is having that panic or something he is having sometimes.
After their first meeting, Dean did everything to find a reason to visit his little brother's office even how much he was busy with his business.
All the football team was laughing and cheering the two nasty boys who trying to throw him. Also, Dean was laughing.
"God Cas, I know what you want and I'm gonna give everything that my omega wants. Mmm so good, my beautiful omega, I'm gonna fill you up so good and I'm gonna fuck that your tight, little pussy so hard..." Dean growlers lowly sucking a mark into Cas's neck, then licking it flat with his tongue.
“Yes you have told that babe, but I, I can’t get over with that Cas, I can’t get over with the thing I did here, I have hurt you even without my knowledge. And I ruined your precious skin. I'm sure it must be hurt like a bitch” he says in a very sad voice and kisses all over Cas’s hip, very softly, smoothly like feather touches. Cas closes his eyes and starts to caresses his lover’s hair.
"Um, hi again" Dean's voice came pleasantly. Cas sighed as he has no option but to reply to him. Dean is trying fully hard to be civil with him for some reason. And right now Cas didn't have reason to yell at him or ignore him, besides after the way he treated Cas last night, he didn't want to be rude to Dean. Instead, he decides to go easy on him a bit. But never going to trust him, but only being civil just as Dean trying to prove.
"Okay" That's the only thing Cas could say at that and Dean quickly look into his eyes. Still kinda nervous.
"Okay that's not true, right? You are kidding right Charlie?" He was dying to ask whom the one, she thinks that he is starting at. But he was also scared to know the answer.
"What are you doing here? I mean how?" Cas was finding a suitable question to ask because his mind was filled with questions and surprise.
"Hey brother, what's wrong? You seem like you want to kill someone" Benny asked soon as Dean sat with them.
"Where are these coming from? Is that about your ex Dick Roman?" Gabriel raised his eyebrows with suspensions.
Dean can see the way Cas's face all flushed with that gorgeous blush. Fuck, what is he thinking? Cas isn't a girl, he can't be gorgeous. But hell, that the only word he can think about to describe Cas right now. Dean spent the lunch with his old grumpy grandpa mood.
Okay, strange. His room was closed. But He remembers very well that he never closed it when he goes out earlier. Ok, whatever. He put his hand on the door nob and opened it.
"What? How you even..." Cas starts giving a death glare to Dean but suddenly he reminds him that he is fully naked. even his whole body is covering with thick milk, He is still fully naked in front of this powerful Alpha who was flirting with him yesterday morning.
"You are welcome Dean, and I'm gonna bring this yummy looking and smelling like heaven pie, home with me"
They played some trivia questions rounds and it turned out so well. Mary and Sam laughed a lot throughout the whole time and surprisingly Cas also joined them. He didn't laugh much in his life but today he felt kinda free and he could enjoy the time. After the trivia round, they played some card games too. But quickly Cas understood he has zero knowledge about card games as Sam volunteers to teach him how to play. So the whole game night was successful and full of fun when they called it a night, finally.
Like that it's confirmed and Dean mentality fist bumped to the air. Finally, one of his plans is started to working and now he can have a decent talk with Cas while making sure their misunderstandings will be gone after that. Also, his weird feelings towards Cas will disappear after that for sure.
"And even he holds that Angel pup" Charlie, the redhead, female alpha who's Dean's bestie, also adds.
And today for the first time he didn't come to see Castiel in his office. And it's a no big deal, yeah sure Castiel wasn't a kid, right? And He didn't act like half pissed in the home at all.
"Oh yeah? I will show you your "You will see" Right now" Dean groaned and shoved Castiel to the bed on his back who was laughing and yelping with surprise. And he pushed his lips towards Castiel's waiting lips. That was it. Dean closed his eyes and Castiel was already closed his and started kissing him back eagerly. They kissed very lovingly tasting each other as much as they wanted, losing in each others.
Castiel never saw him after the elementary school neither Dean. Castiel was walking towards the main Hall finding Meg when someone bumped into him and he is almost falling his back. Next second a very strong hand grab his arm and helped him to get on his feet again.
Dean did everything to get rid of his friends without getting suspect. But Charlie gave him a pointed look when he said them that he is going to mess with some girl, who he plans to ask out. But Charlie, Dean's best friend, knew that Dean was absolutely lying. But for Dean's relief, she didn't say anything other than that look.
"You fucking slut, I knew you were fucking with Benny from the beginning. Tell me why did you do this to me? Doesn't your fucking pussy get satisfied with a huge cock like mine? Huh? did you want more cocks bitch? Do you want to give your sluty hole to another man like a fucking whore? Tell me you whore?"
"You can keep him. I know you will. it's not like you are allergic to puppies just like kittens" Castiel kept petting the puppy as he felt Dean's piercing eyes on him.
One day all the kids were playing outside waiting for their parents to come take them as the kindergarten is over.
Castiel gave him a nice smile before opens the bag and leaning into it. Then Castiel's face lit up, and his lips curled into a huge smile.
"No Cas, please. Don't even think about the office. I just want you not to worry about anything right now, by the way how is he now?" Sam interrupted Castiel's apology.
Dean didn't say anything as his anger started to boil. Great. again that nerd, he must be finally got a gut and came directly to bobby and complain him. awesome. Dean felt anger boiling about Castiel inside him.
He should be thankful for Cas, should apologize for everything he did, and should be good for Cas. And also at the same time, he should seduce Cas, should get his v card. Fuck, how he gonna do that? How he gonna get his V card and make him feel better at the same time? And of course, in the meantime, Dean didn't want other people to know that what's going on between them. Dean is too chicken for being a friend with a nerd and a gay boy. A fucking gorgeous and handsome gay boy though. Yeah, Dean was fucked up big time.
"Hey, take it, easy man, I laughed because Charlie said that you are acting like a grumpy old grandpa since yesterday afternoon," Sam said while chuckling again.
"For the record I brought that Pie for Mary. And that day when you kicked my sandwich and "My lips" There wasn't a fight, you are the one only hit me, I didn't hit you so it's not a fight Winchester it's a bulling" Cas said because Dean nicely covered those points. Probably Cas will have to go through the consequences for mouthing with Dean at any point now. Maybe his gang will pop up any second and all will hit the shit out of him. But he didn't care. He didn't gonna be silent right now.
"It's kinda strange. The two questions you asked me now, it's strange. First the word, 'true mates' it's kinda related to you even you think it's a joke, in present. And then Demons. You are a great warrior but you have never deal with them even once. Very strange Cassie, but right now let me tell you the answers what I can think about your questions"
Gabe grabbed Sam's hands and blinked his eye's signing him that, `not to worry, let them handle it` Face.
So when Sam came to the kitchen he just saw both Dean and Castiel was fighting with all colored icing and they were covered with icing.
"Oh c'mon Mrs.Pamela you know that's not true and you are a family friend, so I just thought to visit you, that's it"
"About, I'm asking for your friendship and forgiveness?" Dean said finally. Cas laughed bitterly at that.
"Because famous Dean Winchester is in love with my brother so I don't want to steal my brother's boyfriend," Gabriel said smirking back.
"Hey, No, please don't do that, I can do it tomorrow Cas, please. Don't even think about it," Dean said in a warning tone. But Castiel turned around to rolled his eyes for him.
one day I'll write a story centring around Australians and I just won't have to think about any of this ever. I'll use slang in all the dialogue and not spend 20 mins trying to work out what Americans call doonas and all of my non-australian readers will be confused as fuck but it'll be so nice.
“He told me a lotta things, Sammy. He told me I changed him. He told me I am the most caring man on Earth. He told me he loved me. And he started his whole friggin’ speech off by saying that he
Dean's smile widened, inwardly pleased that the other prince hadn't shot down his suggestion that they should make an effort to socialise prior to the wedding, and dipped his head in a respectful nod.
I'll make this into a full work, but u never know. officially being enrolled in uni has made me emo reflecting back on school and shit, and this was prompted by me reminiscing over the teacher i had for both grade 5 & 6. he truly is the type of teacher i could imagine Dean being,,,,, i aged up what year level he teaches though to Generic HS Class because i don't wanna have to research how middle school works and part of Mr A's charm was he treated us all as though we were a little older than we were and said shit u could get away with to 11&12-year-olds but not rly any younger than that sdkjhzg
hadn’t stopped giving them shit about how Disney-esque it could be seen as, as though he’d been saved by the power of ‘true love’s kiss’ rather than Cas’ angelic powers. Although threatening to demonstrate what a
but boy howdy i sure have been writing every day. and honestly a part of me thinks if I've managed that this week i can probably manage it in almost any circumstances.
don’t wanna get up,” Dean said, as he pressed a soft kiss to Castiel’s brow. “I appreciate the attempt almost as much as the actual action.”
No, Jack had no power over the Empty. It wasn’t his domain to control. Sam and Dean were on their own for this, no deus ex machina was gonna swoop in to solve their problems.
Things had been planned out to a T, every possible interruption he could think of planned for, from traffic delays to an unexpected hunt, and Sammy had smiled at him encouragingly before heading to his room in the bunker to give Dean and Cas some privacy for the evening.
its just me w that one but if it is i read a fic a few years ago that majorly overused it, lol, and that might b why) but idk how successful i was as some sections of this made me screw up my nose slightly as i read back lol. i'd say i'd challenge myself to write smut next but i project myself onto the chars i write too much and that's just. no. although i could my immortals it and just. 'he put his thingy in deans thigny and they had SEXX. then sam walked in and screamed WAT U DOIN???/?//?
In some ways, Dean figured he could be forgiven for that fact. He’d just managed to score the angel he’d been in love with for almost ten years as his
. You’re basically playing a game of hot potato except you’re all on brooms and also the ball fucking
cas is slightly ooc in this but there's actual mental lore for that. i don't really have a full plot for this (i kinda just. woke up and had fae vibes on my mind for w/e reason) bUT i have a couple ideas and I'm very excited by this
But instead, he found himself staring down at his right forearm with a feeling that he registered vaguely as shock.
The fact that said convenient time happened to be a perfect beach day was the cherry on top of the joy Dean felt at being able to grant one of Cas’ wishes.
How long they stayed like this, Dean couldn’t tell you. Normally he had an internal counter in his mind, one that he couldn’t ignore, making him painfully aware of every moment he spent wrapped up in Cas’ casual affection. But something about
Dean grinned fondly across at Cas, who was sitting at the kitchen table looking grumpy (and adorably sleep ruffled, in Dean’s eyes) despite the sun shining outside.
“Well, it’s a mutually beneficial arrangement. You get my body heat, I get to subtly grope you at a moments notice.”
“Dean, I know you grew up as a no-maj so some things about the wizarding world took adjustment, but it’s not like only wizards fly! I
“I’d say he does his best to ignore your nightly condition in general,” Cas pointed out, dropping a gentle kiss behind Dean’s ear. “And I think we’re all better off because of it.”
i was so tempted to add a photo of will graham looking unhinged that i took yesterday while watching hannibal but figure y'all don't need that in ur life the same way i do sflzdkhj
Dean loved his borther sammy more than ANYTHING (ew not like that u sickos) and I knew he wouldnt wannna put Sam in an weird position.
Reminder that due to Life™ and having to wait for my mother to watch eps I’m still on like, season 4 of this show, but I love how chars like Charlie and Meg are portrayed in fic so I’m just. Using them and not worrying so much abt getting the characterisations perfect, as I know I don’t manage that for Dean and Cas anyway.
"Oh, my god Son. I'm so sorry sweetie, I don't know what to tell, I'm so, so sorry honey" Mary put her hand over his mouth and said holding her tears.
Then he saw the ten missed calls on his phone from an unknown number. That made him surprise because who have been calling him, and how did he even didn’t saw one of the calls. Shit, he was kinda busy with the gang making fun of kids since morning. Also, the phone was in a silent mood. No, any texts only calls. He frowned his forehead for a while before he quickly dialed the number back thinking like, all right let see who is in the hurry. He glanced at the team and sighed them to wait. The call contact and a lady greeted to the call.
"No, no it's fine, I... Um, I can take the bus and it's easy. Okay Sam, please give my Greetings to Mary. And thank you again, I will text you later" Cas said hurriedly, and before anyone says anything else Cas opened the door and walked out not giving a single glance at Dean.
"Checked," Sam said quickly while open the fridge and grabbing the ice cream tub and looking for the cheesecake.
"No actually it's a big story, kinda half of my life story, so I would like to tell you everything when we meet on Saturday, is that alright?" Castiel asked not wanting to hurt Dean's feelings, because Castiel didn't want Dean to think he is hiding things from Dean.
As per Dean's football practice timetable, he got an early morning practicing today. So he was determined to go today to the practice without even a one-second delay. He felt proud of himself as he thought Alastair and the gang should be thinking he will get the bait again. But he was already one step ahead of them. Because he paid another two football players for giving Dean all the practice-changing details when the team planing for ditching him. So he won't miss practice again. He smirked and got on to his baby to go to college. He played the eye of the tiger and sang along with it. He wanted to forget a things behind. He drew slowly because he loved the early morning wind. The road is not more crowded yet and vehicles are also not much there yet. that's why Dean noticed him. He saw a runner coming in front of him.
"Oh it is Clarence, and now, Dean you go back and pick Sam from the school and bring him here, I don't want him to be scared and worried just like you did before, okay? Now go safely" Mary said with a lovely smile at her Son.
"Oh no, no, no, no, no what have you done Castiel, stupid, sooo stupid. What if he thought that you are reminded him that you want fucking gifts for Valentine's Day. Oh shit. Why'd you always do so stupid things, why? Whyyy?" He muttered when his door opened without even a knock.
"It's so amazing. Did you bake this pie too?" Castiel asked while checking all the way out of the pie, spinning it slowly around to see the whole Apple Pie.
Dean's hands roam all over Cas's soft body, his gorgeous breast is getting bigger and harder as Dean smirks into the kiss. Cas finally pulls out from the kiss when he is lost of air.
"Look Dean, you know I'm your best friend but you still keep hiding secrets from me, I know that and it's okay because I know when it's time to say it you will eventually tell it to me, but I'm kind of know what's going on but I'm not gonna push it because that's not true friends doing, okay? But I want you to know that whatever happens I'm here for you man, okay?" Charlie said in a very lovely voice to make Dean feel better.
Finally, it was Christmas Eve and they all were in the living room. The whole house was beautifully decorated. The fireplace was firing slowly, making a beautiful and warmth around the house. And the huge Christmas tree was beautifully shining with lights. All four people were beaming with happiness.
2 The man (Unbelievably handsome) who was covering his mouth with his both hands stood within a flash and tried to come near to Castiel, like a helping gesture, but still laughing.
Dean knew he was screwed up since the start. Now he just has to face all those consequences. He closed his eyes tightly thinking about why he just can't see the truth in front of him and accept that. It's all about Cas. He wanted to think about Cas more. To remind those Blue gems of him. Those pinkish, plump lips. But also he knew that he is afraid to do that.
He was beaten by Cas without any mercy. But when considered the battles Dean was fighting before, the Omega's punches were like butterfly kisses. There is no way Dean got weak like this by that. Something strange thing is happening and Dean could feel some strange bitter feeling growing inside him. Like anything he felt never before. His whole body starts to shut down when his wolf starts to wailing dangerously.
"Yes ma.. I mean Mary, um I was aa um bit in a hurry, so I had to go, but before I go I made sure that you getting better, by asking the nurse" Castiel said with a genuine smile.
"Yeah, that's right, that's what I also have to tell you, just LOOK AT THEM, they aren't dating, isn't it obvious?" Dean huffed annoyingly.
Dean smirked and started to write on the paper. He make sure to write whatever he was writing, to be neat as much as he can. Finally, he lift his head and pushed the paper into Castiel's side, who's shooting daggers at him.
Dean suddenly changed his hitting angle and rubbed his wet throbbing, huge cock head over Castiel's Prostrate hardly.
"Good morning Cassie darling, Happy Valentine's Day" Donna greeted him very enthusiastically, showing him all of her teeth with a gummy smile. Cas knew that she is always a good co- friend in the office and she silently supports Dean for his crazy daily routine over Cas. However, it's the first time Cas understood that today is Valentine's Day.
"Mmm and baby my huge cock is more talent than my tongue" Dean smirks into Cas's slit. Dean bit on pussy lips a bit harder. Then grabs pussy lips with his fingers and spread them like flower petals.
"And Sam you know, when I came to meet you here I was a mess okay? I wanted to talk to you before I do something stupid myself. There was a problem in the office and however, it triggered to the old man" Dean said looking at his hands on his lap.
"Sweetheart you are holding your breath don't do that, just let it go, you can laugh okay? And I know you like it when I flirt with you" Dean smirked.
"Don't touch me Winchester" Castiel said and tried to walk away from Dean. But before even he thinks what happened Dean grabbed Castiel's both hands and pinned it above his head to the locker. Castiel's eyes went wide.
"Happy now? No poison, no pranks, I swear" Dean said and this time he didn't put it on Cas's lap but just held out it for Cas. For a second Dean thought that Cas will kick his hand and the sandwich like he did on his last day. But No. Cas didn't kick his hand but glaring him with a suspicious look on his face. For some reason that made Dean's heart shuttered.
"And of course I tried to call him a few times but all goes to the voice mail, so I didn't disturb him. But left a message asking about the situation and is he okay. right now I'm waiting for his reply and I was going to call you when I get to know about what's going on. Because right now I don't have anything to say you what is happening" Sam finished.
"Actually I'm a lucky girl to have that kind of relationship. He is perfect he gave me a red rose and some make-up sets, oh Cassie, believe me, the date was amazing, I love Valentine's Day so much" Anna said almost jumping.
After that day Dean always loved to kiss his best friend. Same as Castiel. They didn't care where were they, if they feel like they want a kiss or want to give a kiss they just go for that, being cute kids from others' eyes. But definitely not for John. He was always acting like a stick up in his back. Very straight and a huge homophobic. So he wanted to his elder son to be a man just like him, he wanted to raise Dean as a very Man type person. For him to be proud one day.
Castiel was looking at the entire seen and quickly get his eyes on his books soon as Dean rushed out before Azazel make any drama here. He saw the look on Dean's eye, they were not angry eyes, but he was staring, Castiel shivered for a moment with that thought. Never mind, you know what ever. Because everytime everything about Dean, ending up with a disaster on Castiel's life. So he left that scene from his mind. He just want to live in peace for few minutes. That's it. Then he noticed Azazel is still checking out him.
The call connected and within the first ring, Michael answered the phone. As soon as he answered Dean recognized that he is on the loudspeaker as he can hear the other voices coming from the background.
"But why? I mean you never do that, saying sorry or admit that you are wrong? This is the third time you said sorry and that's dangerous for me" Castiel said.
"What? No, Cas I can't do that, please, let me show you that I really really regret my actions and past, you are a good kid and I did so bad to you, you did the biggest favor to me saving my mom, and I'm just want to make it up to you, please give me a chance Cas" Dean said like a beg and he was going to touch Castiel's hands again but Castiel pulled them quickly before Dean reaches for them.
"And then Mary, my very brave brother, did everything to find a better job for us, that time he was stopped his school too. Finally, after one month, he found a job in a bakery and he found a little but clean apartment room for us. Then we lived there without anything fancy but happy because we both had each other" Castiel said softly but still tears coming from his eyes. Mary was crying and Sam also was crying like a baby.
"C'mon man don't be scared. He is not gonna come home today. He is already in Charlie's home. They should be playing some stupid game right now, so don't worry I promise you, he will never get to know about this, c'mon.... let's go" Sam said while tugging at Cas's hand.
"Um son me and my two sons want to invite you to a dinner over my house, and I would be very happy if you will come," Mary said very patiently not wanting to panic Castiel.
All of them shouted cheering Dean as Castiel's heart get speed, he was very weak, he just wanted to sit for his exam after all things happened to him since in the morning. This is the last thing he wanted to happen now and not with Fucking Winchester, not at all.
"What are you saying man, I'm just.. C'mon. I said I didn't do anything, or I will never do anything like that again. just don't bring it back okay?" Dean felt like someone slapped him when Sam brought that up.
Before Castiel even know what's happening Azazel ran to him and grabbed a hold of Cas and slams him into one of the garbage bin. Castiel closed his eyes and cried with the sudden pain he felt.
Then Cas notice that something is poking through between his legs as he tries to look between them because Dean is on his body bracketing and hovering over him.
They don't know how many hours Dean sucks, licks, and kisses those tits, but finally, they look well used and nailed by Dean's mouth. They are ruined by Dean. Dean looks at the tits and smirks giving them a final lick alone with two kisses on both nipples.
He inhaled on every rose flower in the bouquet and it was a pure nice aroma. He was feeling the roses as much as he wanted because that was the nicest gift he ever had. Finally, Castiel kissed some flowers and giggled at his own childish behavior. Castiel couldn't help and started to count the flowers and his eyes widen when it passed 700. And there were 1000 rose flowers and Castiel felt his eyes getting wet again. Castiel softly touched flowers again before he went to the bed finally. His sleep was very peaceful and smells very nice that night.
"Mh huh, your lips. I thought about how would those lips taste like if I kiss those beautiful, and gorgeous lips of yours" Dean said without a tiny hesitation and Castiel's eyes went wide with that comment. His cheeks immediately turned into bright red and he ducked his face smiling that his signature smile.
