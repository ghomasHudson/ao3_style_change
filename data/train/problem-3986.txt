His cheeks are so red they’ve droned out his freckles, and Cas can’t stop himself from reaching to run his knuckles over the flushed skin. “I don’t remember a lot of it,” he murmurs. “Some of that is Naomi, I’m sure, but—some is also just being human, I think. I’ve been writing it all down, so I don’t forget.”
Dean laughs, quickly moving to the put the other ring on Cas’s finger. He presses a kiss to the base of it, moving down to Cas’s palm as he looks guides the hand up and into his hair, trailing kisses down Castiel’s sternum and tickling his ribs and nipping down his treasure trail. “
Cas is looking up directions to another dive when Dean puts a hand on his wrist. “Why the hell are we looking at shitty motels?” he asks, holding up Charlie’s magic card. “I wanna stay someplace I can take my shoes off. You think if we tell ‘em we’re married they’ll give us free champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries?”
“Jerk,” Sam grunts. He pretends to struggle for a minute before settling down against Dean’s shoulder, wrapping an arm around his waist.
. He’s still a little flushed from the shower—shared earlier, with water pressure to die for—and freshly shaven. His damp hair curls against his forehead.
Now, Cas has known heartbreak and elation. He has known despair and joy. And he understands that all of that—the good, the bad, the ugly—all of it is love. That love is not steadfast in itself, but a riot of emotion, and it is the ability to remain steadfast in
It’s Sam’s, so neither of them touch it, and it’s shoved so far back into the cupboard that Dean has to climb onto the counter to reach it. Between the stupid ring stuff and the virus, he’s been living on the knife’s edge of anxiety for so long that he almost hopes the motherfucker finds it.
Castiel slides their palms together, threading their fingers. The way Dean holds his hand brings a helpless, hopeless smile to his face. Cas kisses him once and only once; the kind of familiar, dry press of lips suited to spouses. “Sleep well, husband.”
, over bitter coffee and burnt toast, cheek resting on his palm as Cas methodically slathered the two black slices in his plate with honey. He’d seemed surprised by it, too, like sleep had dampened the ever-present iron grip on his own heart.
His palms skate up to Cas’s ribs until they brush the ring. Cas’s breath hitches. He’s staring; sweet and steady, waiting for Dean’s next move. Always waiting. For the hundredth time, Dean wonders what he did to earn that kind of trust. Carefully, he pulls the chain over Cas’s head and removes the ring. Trails his fingertips along the insides of Cas’s forearms until he’s at his hands. Lifts his left.
, Cas had said, repeatedly, in the hopes that Dean would not take it as a slight. That he wouldn’t look at him like a challenge to overcome or something to be conquered.
Dean sees them, four dark smudges in the dim of early morning, before Tracy does. Before she can grasp his knee and say
Cas has learned that the newlywed excuse goes a long way anywhere, but works especially well when paying outrageous amounts of money in a fancy hotel. He expects they’ll also leave the champagne bottle.
Finishing off his fruit, Castiel checks the time and begins to make his way back towards the ship, eyes lowered. He has no intention of claiming the throne of this place, and no interest in finding out if his mere presence would still be considered an act of war. Normally, he’d stay in the ship, but… after eighteen years, it’s nice to be truly back, if only for a little while. Eden was not home, but it meant a great deal to him for much of his life.
Dean reaches for his glass and fumbles his grip, frowning at the cheap, fingerprinted thing. He isn’t sure how many he’s had, but the number’s high enough to keep him looking at the guy sitting at the other end of the bar. He’s got dark hair and darker eyes and long, brown fingers reach out to curl around his beer. Dean forces himself to frown at the grain of the bar top. This is bad. It was a bad fuckin’ idea to come here anyway, and Mister McHotFingers over there’s only makin’ things worse.
Dean swallows thickly. “Y’know… I—I don’t need a speech. I mean, I love that you wrote one, and I want to hear it, but I don’t—I don’t need a big show in front of our friends and family. I like this being just us.”
In defiance of the willowy, pale vision he had been forced to become, Castiel’s flesh has browned from the light of one thousand stars and suns, his hands calloused and cheeks perpetually space-burned. Dean may be the captain, the mechanic… but Cas is the flyer. The pilot. He has lived on a planet with a suffering people and argues that no war zone is too dangerous. They call him the nebula—untouchable, uncatchable. He might not understand the inner-workings of the machine but he knows her abilities, guides her out of impossible corners and tight spots as surely as if she were his own wings.
Dad’s gonna kill him. Dean deserves it, too—but it ain’t like Sam ever goes out, so when the kid had told him he was going to a house party Dean had pretty much been powerless to refuse. Of course, if god exists he’s a cruel, twisted fuckface, because Dad blows in at 11:50 covered in ghoul guts.
Dean’s running back from it when the door slams open and Dad—a big shadow in his leather jacket—shoulders his way inside, bringing the snow and cold with him. He takes one look at Dean and yells something about sleeping.
The alarm on his phone barely has the opportunity to buzz before he’s turning it off, carefully sliding out from between the covers. It’s dim, and Cas allows himself a moment to run his hand through the mess of his hair and dig his toes into the soft carpet. A breeze is coming off the water.
It was not a burden, to love the Universe his Father created. Castiel walked along the sulphurous, scorched shores of the primordial beach and loved the creature of flesh that hauled itself onto the coarse black sand. He leaned over the very edge of heaven and watched pterodactyls fly and felt his own wings twitch. When God sent a meteor for the dinosaurs, Castiel reassured himself that the subsequent genocide must have been borne of love, too.
They’re close enough for their lips to catch should they speak, though Castiel isn’t certain when that happened. Dean brushes fingertips along his stubbled jaw and Cas presses into the contact. “I was distracted,” he rasps.
“Yeah,” Dean says, eyeing the camera warily. She gives him an encouraging look, and he sighs. Fuck reality TV. “Ah… I’m a pretty big dude to carry, though. Um. ’Specially when half the team was in danger of hypothermia, too. Benny and Sam couldn’t drag me; everyone was too weak. Jo weighs like ninety pounds soaking wet—”
Dean reaches forward and plucks the box from Cas’s hands, holding it protectively behind himself. Forget a deer in headlights; Castiel looks like he’s been run over by a fucking Mack truck. That’s fine, as far as Dean’s concerned; no way in hell is Cas giving his ring first. He didn’t put in the
Then, Dean figured: the bathroom. So many hiding spots in the bathroom. But that was also a bust; Dean shoved the thing in between the emergency pads Charlie kept under the sink… and then Cas made up a basket for the women’s shelter. A couple minutes later and Dean woulda been out an entire paycheck.
It’d taken months, Dean remembers. Months of slow, hard friendship: of arguments and blowouts and unbearable wanting, until on one totally regular, run-of-the-mill Tuesday, Cas had kissed him in the middle of Doctor Sexy. Things had been a little less slow-going, after that.
The team erupts into cheers but Dean barely hears any of it. He doesn’t feel himself getting sprayed with champagne, though he definitely tastes it on Cas’s mouth when he plants one on him, right in front of the cameras. Jo whoops and tackles them both, and it becomes a dog pile, all of them on the floor and yelling and laughing.
They arrive at the front desk with duffles in hand, dressed in worn jeans and flannel and rumpled from spending the night parked by the beach. “Double’s seventy-two a night,” the teenaged clerk says, barely looking up from his phone.
Cas follows as he always does, though after going beyond the ends of the earth Dean figures the scant space between them is child’s play. He brings Cas in until he’s close enough to kiss and then keeps going, until their mouths press and Dean can hold the ring in his fist. Cas clings to the thin material of his t-shirt. Leans forward, hands out and chin tilting up as if in supplication, as if kneeling in this filthy motel bathroom is comparable to receiving Revelation.
Dean’s palm has migrated down, the pad of his thumb resting on the flesh of Castiel’s bottom lip. Cas kisses him there. Looks up through his lashes. Dean is flushed from head to toe, now, and he nods vigorously. “Yeah,” he breathes. “Yeah, I can—I mean, if you want—”
Castiel reaches up to clutch at the glowing light blue stone underneath his shirt. Those credits would be the first of many things he gave Dean. With time, Cas would give him his hands, his mind… his heart, first a thing borne of admiration and loyalty, then turned soft and sweet with affection. Castiel’s heart—his friendship, his love—is the most precious thing he thinks he has ever owned. He thinks, maybe, that it is the most precious thing any person owns, and so to receive it is an honour beyond honours. He thinks, too, that for all its importance, a heart is laughably easy to give away.
It’s a thought that barely registers, Cas too preoccupied with holding and being held. His gasps in the aftermath, slowly coming back to himself as Dean lays kisses on his half-bared shoulder. “…
Dean forces himself to pull back and Cas’s hand is immediately at his cheek and jaw, the ring cool and smooth and wonderful. He can’t stop himself from leaning into the touch. “But you know, right? That—that you never have to find another home if you don’t want to. And that the thing you wanted, you can have it and then some but it’s
He’s got a crooked, boyish smile despite the fact that there’s the suggestion of silver at his temples, and Dean swallows thickly. Takes a large pull of his drink. Almost chokes when the dude sildes onto the stool bedside him and offers his hand, grin softening into something a little more hesitant, a little sweeter. “I’m Des.”
Dean shakes his head and kisses him again, pulling vainly at Cas’s shirt. Between the two of them, they manage to wrestle it off, working on Dean’s until it too falls crumples against the tile. It’s weird, Dean thinks faintly, how much he wants to live in this other person. He helps Cas off his knees and to his feet, until they’re pressed up against the counter kissingkissing
They get herded into another boat soon after, when their exit interviews are done and there’s no more sensationalized bullshit to squeeze out of them. Cas takes the longest, but he climbs onto the boat with a small smile on his face, the thing living up around his eyes as he tiredly clutches at his medal.
Jo laughs and Sam pushes at her shoulder. Benny snorts at the both of them. Cas, the nerd, as pretty much fallen asleep against his side.
Privately, he wondered at this; his insatiable curiosity to know all God’s creatures, to fly to the farthest reaches of the Universe—just to see, to know. His passion outmatched that of his siblings, and among the closest of his kin, he became known for it. Though Castiel was not a Watcher, Uriel joked that he may as well have been—but to be teased by his brother was a privilege, and Castiel loved him, too.
It’s an embarrassingly short affair. One, two strokes and the warmth at the base of Cas’s spine sends a tinging up to the base of his skull and down to his fingertips. He crushes Dean to his chest as he spills over his fist, crying out into the juncture of his neck.
The mattress dips, and Dean holds a steaming mug by Castiel’s elbow, smiling sweetly. A damp washcloth is draped over his right shoulder and Cas forces himself to breathe deeply. Dean only wants to help. Dean wants to take care of him, and even if Cas doesn’t want to be touched right now, it’s worse if he isn’t. He nods, clipped and embarrassed, and reaches out for the tea, opening up so Dean can slot in right beside him. Their legs tangle and Dean nuzzles at the side of his head, pressing kisses to his hair. “Hey,” he murmurs. “…Love you.”
They pick their way down the lee of the hill, where moonlight illuminates the bank of a small stream. Dean pulls him to a patch of grass among the rocks and grasps his hands tightly. “How —” He clears his throat. “How d’you wanna do this?”
Dean smirks against his mouth, giving a loud, exaggerated moan as he buries his hands in Cas’s baggy tee. He’s laying it on thick, stumbling back to block Jo’s path to the coolbox and Castiel can’t help laughing as he’s pulled along. They bump up against the counter and Cas pulls away, playfully pushing Dean’s face away when he draws near. “Don’t you have a ship to captain?”
Cas frowns against Dean’s left pec, eyes looking up at him from where he’s laying his head on Dean’s chest. He feels a hand card through his hair and rub at the base of his skull. He hums into the contact like a cat, closing his eyes in contentment as he feels Dean’s unabashed stare. He rolls off of his chest so they’re nose-to-nose, fingers brushing in the space between them as they lay on their sides.
“You just—” Dean shakes his head. “You say all this epic crap about me like you didn’t change me, too.” He looks down at their joined hands, frowning as he brushes a thumb over Cas’s knuckles. “I didn’t really have any friends before you. Or not like you, at least. Hunting… you kinda gotta keep people at an arm’s length. And you—y’know, you helped me be myself. Made me brave. So, uh. Thanks. I guess.”
“Depends. If they were making good time, no nav fuckups, everybody’s healthy… yeah, they should be done the hardest part of this thing.” Dean bites his lip. “But you don’t know, right? They could be lost or hurt o-or hypothermic, or whatever, and we just… don’t know.”
They’re almost at the door when Dean feels himself shoved up against it and kissed. He faintly hears the cheering of people ringing in the new year, and Sam grumbling beside him, but all he can see are the hot girl’s big, brown eyes and taste her sweet, tacky lipgloss. “Happy new year,” she says, like it doesn’t matter. Dean swallows thickly. Nods.
Sam gets to him first, because of course he does; almost bowling Dean over as he gives him a huge hug and big kiss on the cheek. He smells like ass and wet dog, but Dean holds him fiercely, grinning big and wide as he gets tackled from three more sides. “Jesus, okay, I get it!” Dean says, quickly wiping away the tears at the corners of his eyes. “Y’all stink, c’mon.”
Cas toys with the end of the thin white cloth, looking at Dean intently as the other man stares back. Carefully, freckled fingers pull at Castiel’s own handfasting cloth. Dean groans to see it. “Fuck.” He bites a fervent kiss into the corner of Cas’s mouth. “Um. The stables at half-ten. In the little alcove.”
“Here.” Dean appears to be just as moved, his own eyes bright and face open and awed as he tries to coordinate their free hands to wrap and tie the strips around their held ones. It takes a few failed attempts before they manage to be successful, heads touching and turned down to the scant space between them. Castiel cannot stop staring.
Dean sighs and gets to his feet, shoving the bills in his back pocket. He makes his way towards the Gas n’ Sip and asks for the bathroom key. The door sticks as he shoulders his way in.
Castiel is by no means an expert at sucking cock, but it is something he enjoys very much. He likes burying his face in Dean’s groin and letting him ride his face, enjoys licking and kissing along his length and taking him into his mouth. He knows Dean’s noises and his movements; how to tell when he’s close, when he enjoys something immensely and when he doesn’t care for it at all. He likes the act of swallowing, likes the way his jaw aches after. Likes the way Dean looks at him. Kisses him.
before kissing him again. And again. And again. He pulls away and moves back when Cas chases, a crooked, goofy smile tugging at his mouth. Cas feels himself start to grin in response. “What?” he asks.
He lifts his gaze from Dean’s cock, shiny with his own spit, to find him looking down with wide eyes. Gorgeous. Cas licks a stripe up the inside of Dean’s thigh and dips his middle finger into his mouth, tracing a line with the wetted tip from across his perineum to his hole. His own prick is hard enough to crumble stone, but besides the aborted thrusts of his hips he ignores it. He wants — he
It feels like they stay like that for an hour, but Des eventually steps forward and kisses the corner of his mouth. “Happy new year, Dean.” He sounds sad.
It used to cause tension, his love for flying. Back when Dean wasn’t sure Cas wouldn’t commandeer his ship and leave them all for dead on some miserable rock or another. Castiel remembers that the thought had crossed his mind often in those early days. To have a ship all his own and travel had seemed the ultimate freedom.
. He wondered if perhaps both sides weren’t wrong, in that neither cared about the creatures on Earth and the happenings of their little lives; that two brothers were fighting there, too. That one killed the other and was doomed to a life of wandering.
Cas stares at him for a moment before scooting closer. He wraps an arm around Dean and tugs, relaxing when over six feet of freckled hunter is suddenly plastered to his side. “Okay,” Cas breathes. “Good. This is good. I love you.”
for me,” he echoes. “Christ.”  Dean takes Cas’s bottom lip between his teeth, splays his hand over the small of his back. They stumble towards the boulder and Castiel presses him up against it, grinning wide and wolfish as the man starts to fumble with his shirt. Dean’s right leg hitches around Cas’s waist even as his clever fingers grasp and pull in handfuls, until Cas’s shirt is half-hanging over his kilt. He toys with the woolen material and Castiel groans, ripping himself away. He pants clouds of humidity into the cold air and grins as Dean follows him until he’s too far away to kiss. Dean's hair is a mess from Castiel’s fingers, and the sash of his kilt is caught in the crook of his elbow. Cas’s left palm slides further up his thigh, under his kilt, and breathes out shaky into the crook of his neck. “
“Gabriel kept me at table far longer than I wanted, and then I — I had to bathe and dress and pack.” Dean frowns, but Cas doesn’t let him interrupt, barreling on with his own flushed cheeks. “Of course, that was all in vain because the horse was unsaddled and I forgot my shoes, but… I wanted to look pleasing for you.” He shrugs, toeing the ground. “I only plan on being married the once.”
Cas had barely paused before nodding—like Dean’s heart wasn’t pounding double-time. Like this wasn’t a
His eye’s gonna bruise and he’s pretty sure he has a cut on the apple of his cheek—his nose is definitely bleeding. It’s nothing more than he deserves, though. Maybe.
Cas is staring at him as he slides back into the booth, and Dean reminds himself that he has nothing to feel guilty about.
Three weeks after that morning in the kitchen, Dean nuts up and leaves a ring on Cas’s nightstand. At breakfast the next morning, before Sammy is back from his run, Cas gingerly places his own right next to Dean’s elbow. He gives Dean a long, meaningful look, and then turns back to his Froot Loops.
it feels—he’ll lose it. Castiel squeezes his eyes shut and groans, the thing turning into a gasp as Dean moves to tug at his hair.
Cas looks at him, freckles already gathering on his shoulders and the bridge of his nose, ring on his finger, bowed legs and Scooby-Doo boxer-briefs. He reaches out a hand. Wriggles his fingers.
Cas smiles, though he knows the thing doesn’t reach his eyes. Truthfully, he doesn’t even know why he’s disappointed; they can’t leave Scotland. Moreover, Cas doesn’t want to — he’d be asking Dean to leave Sam and Ellen and Bobby and Jo, not to mention Castiel’s own family. And with the ever-worsening relations between the Scots and the English? He and Dean have a duty to protect their loved ones. To keep their traditions alive. To fight for their country, should it come to that.
Des squeezes his hand and finds a darkened corner in the small hallway, and he slides his long fingers over Dean’s hips and pulls him close and steps forward, but instead of being devoured suddenly Dean’s being kissed, soft and sweet and exploratory, like they’re dating or like each other or some shit, and it’s so goddamn nice Dean is pretty sure his nails are biting red half-moons into his own palms.
Cas sighs into the contact, wrapping himself around Dean’s body with a smile that has Dean pulling away to look. He gazes down at Castiel with a smile of his own, tracing the line of his stubbled jaw. “See? I’m like… the Cas whisperer. I can play you like a vio-whatever. That Earth instrument with the strings.”
Cas isn’t sure if Dean yelps at the sudden height change, or the cold water now in direct contact with his sex. Perhaps both.
Dean is herded onto a boat with the race MC. The finish line is already lined with torches, the wooden platform and sign behind it something closer to Survivor than any race Dean’s ever done. It’ll take another twenty minutes for his rag-tag little team to make land, and Dean spends every second of that poised like a prairie dog, his eyes trained on the slowly brightening horizon.
It’s a new fuckin’ millennium. Or it’s gonna be, in—two hours. Dean snorts into his whiskey: the year 2000. Shouldn’t there be… flying cars by now, or something? A chip that downloads all knowledge directly into your brain? A robot that follows you around and feeds you snacks?
Dean blurts it out as if the words were pressing against the backs of his teeth, chest heaving like they were plucked directly from his heart. His blushes profusely, squeezing his eyes shut. “I-I mean — fuck. That’s not — Castiel Milton, I —”
Dean hums thoughtfully. He moves so they’re sitting back to chest, his chin resting on Cas’s shoulder and hand moving to rest over his chest. “I don’t think you ruined it,” he says quietly.
Dean wraps his tartan around Cas’s shoulders and offers him whiskey and slices of hard cheese. They sit in the lee of the hill, swaddled and half atop one another, and eat and drink and kiss until their lips are sore and their bellies are full. Castiel doesn’t think he’s ever been so in love.
There is no moment of thinking about what he wants to do—what he’s allowed; Cas moves without conscious thought, peppering kisses from Dean’s ass all the way to the nape of his neck and then lavishing his attention on his particularly freckled shoulders. “Mmm… smells good.”
It’s a blessing to have to wait until the horse paddock before saying their goodnights. Dean watches raptly as Cas sorts out the mare, cutting new ropes to re-tie her in the stall, giving her food and water, another apple. Thanking her. He barely has time to jump the fence before Dean presses him back into it with a series of joyful little kisses.
An angel. Cas feels his heart seize and his wingless back ache, but forces a playful smile to his lips. “You want to hear about dinosaurs and meteors and great cataclysms,” he teases. “I suppose… the beginning was violent, like breaking a bone again and again until it sets right—”
“I’m older than most types of dirt,” Cas says. “It’s a lot to remember.” He pauses, tracing the line of Dean’s clavicle. “I… wasn’t lying when I said you changed me. And everything that came before, all of it, walking along the primordial beach, pushing mountains from the ground, spending time with all things that swam in the sea and walked upon the earth—it’s like they’re half-memories; empty, but given meaning now that I know to appreciate them. That I know how to put feelings to them.”
Outside, nebulas smear themselves across space-time, but their colour pales in comparison to the riotous blush of Dean’s cheeks. Even after all this time, the colour reaches his ears. Cas smirks as he pulls away, starting to divest himself of his own clothing. The smirk turns into a grin as Dean does the same, and soon enough Cas is hooking a freckled leg over his shoulder, turning to leave a line of wet, biting kisses all the way to Dean’s groin. He rakes his fingers through the reddish, wiry hair there.
that Dean is the most relaxed friggin’ guy on the planet by the time the dude’s slipping on a rubber and pushing in. He’s slow; reaching down to jerk Dean’s dick, to press kisses up his spine—to whisper
Putting the ring directly into the cereal is too risky, so Dean figures the safest bet is to shove it between the cardboard and the waxy plastic container thing full of horse food.
Despite the time crunch, Dean parks Baby like the queen she is before bolting from the driver’s seat like a friggin’ rocket. Sam’s not hard to spot: he’s got an overgrown head of hair and is more bean pole than teenager. He’s awkwardly standing beside some equally awkward girl and Dean physically resists the urge to smirk. Across the room, a different girl in a crop top catches his eye. She’s not a dumb kid and she’s too young to own this house, so she must be the sibling chaperone. Dean winks. She raises an unimpressed brow.
Castiel rolls his eyes. “I know that, too.” His voice cracks, blinking back tears despite his smile. He bites his lip. “And I don’t know why I keep—why I’m so—”
“No,” Dean cuts him off, fingertips pressed to his mouth. Cas looks at him curiously. “I mean, that’s cool—the beginning,” he says. “And I want to hear about all of that another time, but… you. I—I wanna know about you.”
Dean moans because it’s what the john wants to hear, doubles down and sucks harder. Looks up with heavy eyes. Hums. He wants to get back to Sam by midnight.
Cas hums, one hand working himself while the other braces himself against the ground. Dean looks like what he imagines one of th old gods to be, bare and flushed and sated in the grass. Like some kind of radiant thing worthy of ballads and poetry. Lost in his own pleasure, Cas doesn’t realize Dean has moved until he’s touching him; hitching up his thigh as he captures his mouth in a messy kiss. He bats Cas’s hand to the side and wraps fingers around his slick prick.
Cas wakes to the image of Dean shirtless and half-hanging into the footwell. He presses a kiss to Cas’s mouth and pushes a hand through his hair. It’s cold, maybe; hard to tell with the way they’re pressed together, but sun is streaming in through the trees and the cracked windows bring the smell of salt and seaweed and the odd cry of a gull.
They come together more softly than usual, tentative in a way they haven’t been in a long time as they kiss. Eventually, Dean gets pulled onto Cas’s lap and shrugs out of the top of half of his robe. “Gonna need to work up an appetite to finish all that food,” he murmurs. He ducks down to suck and bite at the spot on Cas’s neck that makes him weak in the knees.
. He’s starting to get restless, and from there it’s a sidestep to antsy and anxious and overstimulated. Between one moment and then next, pleasure turns to
Tanner’s tongue is long and wet and he presses slurpy, sucking kisses to his hole and perineum and it’s good, it’s so good, it’s so insanely motherfucking
It did, eventually. When Dean was on Death’s friggin doorstep, sandwiched between two teammates who weren’t far behind. Team Novak managed to overtake them on a gravel road at 6 a.m. and about a mile from the checkpoint. Dean barely remembers seeing them; Sam was the one who filled him in. Told him that Cas made it about 100 feet and then turned around and came running back. That his team didn’t notice he was gone until they reached the warming tent. That they yelled at him in English and Russian and Cas just stood there with a blanket and a hot chocolate and stared at Dean, through the chest pains and the cramps and the cardiac arrest, until the helicopter came.
Cas traces over the bridge of a freckled nose and the ridge of his cheekbones. He grins and leans in for a kiss. Dean enthusiastically accommodates him. “So, um… that tasting menu really only lets you taste, huh? You still hungry?”
. Before she can turn on her camera. But Dean would recognize Sam’s dumb, loping stride anywhere, so he’s off like a fucking rocket, turning on the camp stove, starting coffee in the camp stove. All their gear is laid out ready to go, but Dean checks it once, twice, three times anyway. Makes sure their snacks are out and there’s enough room for them to sit and rest for as long as they need.
Castiel was one of three called upon to slay every Egyptian first born. He was told to take a vessel and protect a boy named David. He’d heard rumours of the Father’s son—born to a human woman named Mary—and grief and joy echoed across Heaven upon Christ’s death at the hands of the Romans. Castiel remained steadfast throughout—dutiful, loyal, with a love for all things humming a baseline in the depths of his heart. He was devotion incarnate; the Father’s will was good and righteous, and he wielded his first children as instruments of love and light. If he couldn’t see the plan right now, it was because he merely did not understand it. Besides, understanding was beyond his purview. Castiel’s only purpose was love of the highest order. Steadfast. Absolute.
Stuffing the oil into his sporran, he hastily wraps his tartan around himself, carefully slipping through the castle and down to the stables. He’s halfway there before he’s realized he’s forgotten his shoes, but a look at the moon pushes him forward. Dean will hopefully appreciate his efforts to bathe, even if his feet will be a mess when he arrives.
They touch and tease and half-run to the bedroom, and despite Cas vowing aloud that he has to give Dean his gift because they always forget, they’re always distracted by one another and so exchange them the morning after but this time,
They have time to re-hash all this stuff again tomorrow. They can go over race stories, talk about what was good, what went wrong… but for now, Dean’s happy to hear the highlights, speeding towards a hot shower and a good meal.
—were the first time I truly felt splendour. I had never seen a soul shine through a face, like that. And we had been taught obedience above all, but God had surely
Dean turns and kisses him, and it’s weirdly sweet. When they pull away, Tanner laughs and nods towards the clock. It’s kinda fucked up, feeling him laugh and huff while the guy’s inside him, but Dean looks at the bedside table anyway.
They lost precious time in the single moment of that act—one that lasted a second, an hour, a lifetime. Castiel had no need for breath, and yet he felt breathless in touching this human, this person whose warmth and light, palpable from a distance, was blinding so close. God had lied. Beautiful words about angels as the bringers of love and light—all falsehoods at the feet of his one human being, this righteous man, whose love was so… so steadfast, so
Dean eyes the set-up outside, turn around and… blushes. Is blushing, down his chest and all the way to the tips of his ears. “So this is, uh—you got up and did all this?”
It’s a process. It always is—like trying to jumpstart a dying engine. Despite the fact that Cas wants to chase, he’s balanced on the knife’s edge of pleasure and frustration. If he thinks at all—about his physical response, about how normal it is, about anything other than Dean and how
Castiel clings more tightly, squeezing his eyes shut. They’re married, now; two souls bound in a forbidden act, the words said aloud in the forbidden tongue. “
Dean pulls away and looks up at Cas, narrowing his eyes. Cas smiles down at him beatifically, running a hand through his hair and tracing the shell of his in the way he knows turns him to putty.
Cas kisses him like they’re the last two people on Earth—or he would’ve, if he weren’t smiling so big. Flax cereal crunching underfoot, he presses Dean up against the counter before heaving him onto the thing, hands running up and down his thighs, to his ass, up his torso before their fingers tangle and he starts the circuit all over again. “Dean,” he breathes. “You—I—”
He moves close enough for their noses to brush, smiling crookedly at Cas’s unimpressed stare. Puts their food on the floor and gathers Castiel in his arms, continuing to nuzzle and kiss and work at his neck and jaw and ears until Cas is a puddle of a human being, pressing them together and moving sluggishly in his attempts to obtain a real kiss.
By the time they reach the boulder, Cas is sure he’s less than presentable, but there’s no time; he dismounts, hastily pawing at his hair, pulling at his clothes and —
After doing this for almost a year, Dean’s figured out the basics: pay up front, mouth and hands only, extra no rubber, extra to swallow. He still doesn’t know what it is about him that gives him away, though. His mouth? His face? The way he walks? Holds himself?
,” Dean repeats, thumbing at the back of Cas’s neck. He traces the column of his spine — up-down up-down — reaching forward to gingerly untangle the ties at the large collar of Cas’s shirt. Touching lightly, he presses fingers then a palm to the revealed skin, sliding to his bicep. Untied, the garment falls off his shoulder. “Y’know,” Dean murmurs. “I’d been a little upset we didn’t manage to get your shirt off —” Carefully, he lifts the fabric up and over Cas’s head. Tosses it aside. He traces a line down Castiel’s spine and over his belly, then up along the impression of his ribs, thumb swiping over his nipple until he stops, palm flat, over Castiel’s wildly beating heart. “But this is good, too.”
The kiss Cas gives him is not so much suited to a fuck on the kitchen floor as it is to someone’s wedding night. He pulls away with his crooked half-smile, the one that lives mostly in his eyes as he leans in to nudge their noses. “Always,” he breathes.
The Impala is not a fine ship. She used to be; before the days of lightweight polymers, all machines were made like her; pure steel and alloys… a sharp paint job and a spacious interior, designed for long-distances and harsh conditions while sacrificing little in the way of comfort. Her galley is sizeable, her rooms decent, and despite other ships her age oft finding themselves in scrap yards across the twelve systems, Dean keeps Baby in the best metals money can buy.
Their bowls of chili have been abandoned next to the bed, which has no night table or box spring or frame because Castiel likes feeling the hum through Baby’s floor. He likes the big window that allows them to look out into the vast darkness, broken up by coloured gases, blinding stars and unexplored galaxies. He likes the in-between, when they’re not risking their lives, and they’re fed and warm, and Dean’s draped over him—resting between Cas’s spread legs, hand tracing up-and-down his side, eyes trained on
The concrete is hard under his knees and it smells like gasoline and fries—and, more immediately, the funk of unwashed crotch. The john shoves forward and Dean chokes around his mouthful, swallowing and making an attempt to better open his throat. He’s drooling and there are tears in his eyes, but there’s an edge to the biting humiliation that’s not so bad. It makes him feel kinda—good. Powerful.
By the time Westley and Buttercup have reached the Fire Swamp, Dean and Cas have drifted from making out to aimless touching and holding. It’s skin on skin, and it’s friggin’ glorious. Dean runs a hand through Cas’s hair and Cas leans into it like a cat. “Love you,” Dean breathes, because it’s still hard to say. Cas catches his mouth in a lazy kiss.
Dean snorts, continuing to drag his fingertips down Cas’s ribs to his hip, over his ass and thigh. “Yeah,” he mutters. “Totally unresponsive. You’re not blissed out
. They stuck it to Cas’s ungrateful, shitty fucking family. They beat the unbeatable team. Them; Dean’s broken little family.
Dean’s reaching for him before he realizes what he’s doing, his poorly washed fingers curling around the chain that’s fallen out of his shirt and the ring threaded through it. Cas looks up, startled; his eyes are big and blue against the dirt stubbornly clinging to the right side of his face.
He savours the moment his fingers card through Dean’s pubic hair and wrap his around the base of his cock. Dean’s arms tighten around him, body arching in an attempt to bring them closer even as he breathes too heavily for kisses. “Fuck,” he mumbles, “Fuck, Cas, I —”
“...Nope,” Dean says, suddenly and emphatically. He turns on his heel and walks out of the lobby in two long strides, muttering to himself. Cas watches him leave with a raised brow. “Apologies,” he adds, and nods at the clerk before following. “We had the... wrong address.”
They get settled with coffee, for the first time maintaining a respectful distance between them. It’s oddly hurtful, and the longer they remain apart the more awkward Cas feels. He’s practically shaking out of his own skin when he suggests they go back inside. “You’re tired,” he says. “We should just go back to sleep.”
Blowing Cas on the kitchen floor isn’t the most comfortable way they’ve ever done this, but the rings more than make up for the ache in Dean’s knees. He relaxes his throat and breathes through his nose and feels the band biting into his scalp as Cas guides his head, humming when the same hand moves to brush over his cheek. “Fuck. Dean…”
They stumble out of the car and towards the sandy path to the water, playfully shoving at each other until the beach stretches out before them. It’s empty but for a handful of runners and walkers, and Dean digs his toes into the sand and takes a deep breath. “Y’know, I’ve never done this before,” he says, staring at the water. “The whole beach vacation thing. Me n’ Sammy snuck out a coupla times but...”
And when Cas finally looks up, they’re the only ones in the room. “Maybe we should…?” he says quietly.
“…I also just wanted to say, uh—and I know you know this, you were the one who taught me all this crap but—y’know, sexuality and stuff, it’s variable. And weird. And it doesn’t, like, determine your worth
Dean continues to grumble to himself as he slides out of bed and towards his duffle, frowning when Cas catches his hand. “No need to get dressed.”
There’s a beep, and a quick look to the right reveals the camera coming down off of Tracy’s shoulder. It isn’t until the damn thing is off that Dean realizes how tense he was during his little impromptu interview, but now that the pressure is gone, all that’s left is the pure, unadulterated anxiety of not knowing if his little rag-tag family is okay. Carefully, Tracy moves to squeeze his shoulder. Dean takes a big, shaking breath.
Dean tugs on dark hair and Cas shakes his head, moving to press a kiss to the inside of his wrist. He breathes poetry into the skin enough to make Dean blush, smiling when a calloused palm moves to cup his cheek. “I want you to come in my mouth,” he murmurs. “And then I want your hand.”
Cas traces his finger gingerly around Dean’s hole before carefully pressing inside. He kisses at Dean’s cock and watches the way his knees draw up and part, the way his body bows; his hand, buried in Cas’s hair, pushes him into his groin and Castiel
Cas nods. “But first.” He reaches back, feeling around until he finds the cereal box and digs inside it. Moving up on his elbows he accepts Dean’s kiss with a filthy hum, offering up the two rings and a palm full of stray flax seeds. Dean bites his lip, moving back as Cas sits up and takes his left hand, slipping the ring onto his fourth finger. He kisses Dean’s knuckle and shrugs like they both aren’t on the cusp of crying again. “I’m a big believer in vena amoris,” he says.
They don’t feel married until they’re in some run-down motel in Boise. Covered in grave dirt and ghoul guts, Dean sits on the closed lid of the toilet as Cas sews neat stitches across his bicep. He’s got a little furrow in his brow and he’s squinting at Dean’s mess of an arm like it holds the secrets to the universe, bloody bottom lip pulled between his teeth. The orange light over the mirror makes a halo in his hair, and Dean is very suddenly aware of how much he loves this asshole, putting neat little lines of floss into his skin; this man who is not a man, who has seen the beginning and stopped the end, fragile now and kneeling for him on grimy tile.
They don’t make it to the bedroom—laid out on a bed of flax cereal, Dean pulls Cas on top of him and pretends Sam’s rabbit food isn’t digging into his ass cheeks. They sixty-nine like they’re in high school, hot and hard and fast. Cas drools enough to get spit all over his fingers and then ventures down Dean’s balls to tease his hole, which is just—impossible to deal with when Dean’s trying to deepthroat him. He moans. “Cas. Cas, I’m—”
Castiel laughs as Kevin reaches for the bread disks, hand darting out to claim one for himself before they get passed around again. Spiced to perfection, buttery and soft and just—delicious. He narrows his eyes as Dean plucks the bread from his hand with a wolfish grin, reaching to pick another two and quickly depositing them on his own plate. Immediately following, a booted foot toes up Cas’s calf. Dean’s grin has turned crooked and shy, and there’s a flush to his cheeks as he shoves the disk in his mouth. He chews with his mouth open.
“You can’t tell me you’re never disappointed. It’s been eighteen years! Eighteen years of—of failed orgasms and this unresponsive body and you’ve never once wished—”
Dean pulls Cas to his feet and they jog up to the platform, beaming, shifting in place, totally wigging out because not only did they finish, not only did they
The stall on the farthest left is already empty, and Cas’s heart races to see it, sneaking past and into the hole in the wall that needs repairing. Sprinting to the paddock, he vaults over the fence and makes for the single stable at the end. Just broken, the mare rears back, and Castiel becomes, suddenly — painfully — aware of the lack of tack adorning her stall. Thoroughly out of options, Cas offers an apple to buy her allegiance and throws himself atop her back, unsaddled and every inch the
Dean hums. “I’ve heard that’s an easy thing, to be distracted in a marriage bed.” His voice has gone soft and sweet. It sounds like it comes from very far away.
Dean shrugs. “Doesn’t really matter. We did. And we haven’t killed each other yet, so… seems to be going pretty well.”
to look at the sun rising, a thing that happens and has happened every single day since the Earth started turning. He did this knowing that neither of them get to sleep like this, or be alone like this, or touch like this—this much and this openly. He doesn’t even know if Dean
But the people of Eden never needed a ruler, and Castiel didn’t need Eden. He has a family made up of wild things, now. One who appreciates his curiosity and concern—one who is curious and concerned about him in return. He has travelled the far flung reaches of the Universe the way he used to lead solo expeditions into the deep, dark corners of the palace library, clamoring for knowledge at its edges.
Castiel hums around Dean’s cock, dragging a finger through the spit dripping from his balls and tracing down his perineum to press lightly against his hole. Dean keens. “Fuck, I—Cas, I’m gonna—”
It’s a little much, sometimes—Dean doesn’t need a twink to bring him towels, thank you very much—but it’s nice. It’s nice to have hear the ocean through the open windows and eat breakfast on the balcony and walk on the beach and fuck at all hours of the day and night. Hell, his barring the beach, his wardrobe has pretty much consisted of a clean and dirty hotel-provided robe. Dean took a
, Dean spreads his legs as he pulls Cas’s hand down. It’s easier for Dean to wrap his legs around him this way, easy to ride the crease of his thigh. Not slippery enough, though. “My mouth?” Cas bites the question into Dean’s lips, soothing the hurt with flicks of his tongue as Dean groans. He pushes at his shoulders and gets a smirk in return.
Dean nods against the mattress, hands turning to fists in the sheets. They’re nice—soft, the kind you get from a real department store, made of Egyptian cotton or whatever-the-fuck. Dean feels a finger against his hole and tenses.
Another step, and Dean curses as he’s forced further into the cold water. “Cas, if you come any closer, I swear —
It’s nothing for Cas to step forward and kiss him again, deep and wet and slow. He moves back only far enough for their lips to cling as he speaks. “Here,” he says. “I have no preference beyond that.”
s before they manage to settle, Dean draped over Cas as if shielding him. It’s more fun to kiss this way, to have a surface to be pressed into and to use as leverage. Castiel pushes off the shoulder of Dean’s tartan as his left hand slips between the man’s kilt and shirt, guiding him in a lazy thrust. Undoing the kilt is easy, as are the hose and garters, and soon Dean is pulling the white shirt up and over his head to be tossed aside with the rest, handfasting cloth falling between them, dutifully ignored in favour of other things.
Castiel laves kisses up to the soft flesh under Dean’s navel and nips, marveling at the way Dean squirms. There are no shortage of miraculous things in the universe, but this—the knowing—puts them all to shame. It’s a privilege and an honour, Cas thinks, to be able to feel such things with another person. To hold them at all, but especially at their most vulnerable.
—of course, in the end, it had been the eyes that gave him away. It’s always the eyes: a bright clear blue framed with long, dark lashes. His lineage had been the ships’ open secret until the war of succession—when the people were taxed over years to finance the search for an heir who seemed to care little and less for them. When it became dangerous to know Cas, and to shelter him. When doing so was called
They polish off two extra-large pies and a couple of beers on the balcony before going down to the beach with the last two bottles.
The people are reception had taken Charlie’s magic card and charged the most expensive room in the joint for a whole week. They’d even sincerely congratulated them on getting hitched when Cas had mentioned it. Dean had been… quiet; something about all the wealth made him nervous.
Dean splashes water on his face and rinses out his mouth; makes quick work of brushing his teeth with the travel-sized brush and paste.
“No.” Dean can feel embarrassed, drunk tears welling in his eyes and he bites his lip, blinking in an attempt to get rid of them. “M’fine, promise. I want to—I have to—I—”
“Like…” Dean’s fingers move to play with Cas’s own, his cheeks ruddy and red. “Where did you go? What did you see?” He bites his lip, brow furrowed as he forces his gaze up. Cas meets his eyes earnestly. “You pulled me from hell, man, but… I don’t know anything about you before that.”
Dean stares down the entrance posts of Camp 4, unblinking as the moon crawls higher and higher in the sky. He thinks he’s been in the same spot for hours, but it’s hard to tell with panic squeezing at his windpipe. They should be back by now. Shouldn’t they be back by now? God, running support was a mistake. Everything single fucking part of coming back here was a
Cas’s fingers reach out to brush against the line of Dean’s tartan, slung from shoulder to hip in the perfect mirror of his own. “You look beautiful,” he says.
. “You’re such a dick,” he huffs, drawing him up and rolling them over. Cas goes willingly, throwing a leg over Dean’s hip and grinding sweet and slow. Dean smirks.
Dean shrugs and loops his arms around Cas’s waist, pressing their mouths together with more intent. With a sigh, Castiel drapes his arms around Dean’s shoulders. He likes this; there are many things he likes, where Dean is concerned, but the way he sighs against Cas’s mouth, and wraps his arms tight around his waist, and—
. So I’m gonna work hard, because—because I’ve never found a home inside a person like the one I found in you and that is a goddamn gift. I
—their appreciation for beauty, their seriousness in all things—that Castiel saw reflected in his own self.
Dean likes romantic gestures; not all of them—he isn’t the type of man who likes receiving flowers or chocolates or candlelit dinners. But picking up his favourite beer when Cas notices they’re running low, or staying up late to watch a movie despite being exhausted—kissing him, washing his hair, holding his hand, sitting with him while he works on the Impala… wearing women’s lingerie: these are all things Dean appreciates. Small things. Quiet things.
Cas, though? Cas looks in his element. The stubble makes his jaw look sharper, the dirt brings out his eyes. He helps haul the boat onto land and Dean can see the play of his muscles under his shirt. He’s flushed and filthy and
“Yeah, it’s better.” He’s kissing just above Cas’s groin now, at that place that makes him shivery and unstable. “When you’re into it, I can keep you here for hours. No refractory time. Hell, I can get you here in the friggin’ Batcave, because when I do this…” He moves to tease at Cas’s hair, brushes his mouth along stubble until he’s at his ear. “You’re fried.”
She’s not meant for racing or war, but she’s great at supply running. Some of this is Dean’s expertise, but most of it is owed to Baby’s lineage; a failed line of family transport vehicles that guzzled space dust but excelled in reliability. Cas thinks they could probably take her to the edge of the Universe and she’d keep going. This feature of hers is useful for times like this; barreling towards the next pickup, Baby can be left on autopilot for family meal.
—until they’re pressed up against the door. Dean’s got a leg hitched around Cas’s waist and they’re grinding sweet and slow, sharing sporadic kisses until something slick on one of their torsos slides down.
It takes only a moment to pull his hand back and give it an obscene lick, but it’s enough for Dean to catch his wrist mid-air, pressing his mouth to his knuckles as he paws at Cas’s clothes. The shoulder of his tartan drops to his waist, his belt and kilt undone in short order. Dean smirks against the back of Cas’s hand and threads their fingers together, climbing off his lap and guiding Castiel overtop him. “Like this.”
Laughable. Castiel pulls away so he can jump onto their sagging mattress and squirms up until he’s lounging amidst the pillows, crooking his finger in a perfect imitation of Dean’s god-awful antique porn. And Dean… Dean gives him that crooked grin again and chases, catching him in a breathless, smiley kiss. He’s lazy with love, the stuff softening his eyes and gentling his hands, rounding out his shoulders until they’re pressed together head to toe, kissing, kissing until they’re sore.
and packs a bowl, Dean enters the kitchen blessedly alone and under the pretence of getting snacks. He grabs the snacks—and he grabs Sam’s nasty-ass box of flax-whatever.
“I would marry you in a bog during a thunderstorm,” Cas teases. “But… this will do nicely, too. I’m sorry I’m late.”
On their eighteenth anniversary, they retrace their steps. It’s little more than a fluke, Castiel knows; Eden is one of the biggest trade hubs this side of the Empyreanic belt—but it’s nice, all the same. To feel the spongey dirt under his shoes, smell the greenery… Cas thinks he can consider himself well-travelled at this point—thirteen systems and two galaxies are nothing to sneeze at—and the colours in Eden are still some of the most beautiful he’s ever seen.
Dean’s never had a hookup stick around after getting sick, but Des helps him to the bathroom and doesn’t question the toothpaste he pulls from his jacket pocket. He’s quiet and nice, and he touches Dean’s back and shoulders and arm, but when Dean turns around and kisses him, he barely reciprocates.
The kid—Jason, his name tag says—almost breaks his neck with how fast he looks up, staring at the two of them. Dean not-so-subtly wraps an arm around Cas’s waist. Cas rolls his eyes.
The dude’s name is Tanner, and he’s the all-American, boy next door type of handsome. He also, apparently, likes eating ass. Dean feels his toes curl and he arches his back, swallowing the noises pushing at his teeth as he moves his hands to bury his face in them. He feels hot all over and bites his fist.
of that that makes it sacred and glorious. That hope and love are irrevocably entwined, and it is in this intersection that humans find true strength. True dignity. That they become something greater than themselves when they are
Sarah inches closer to him, perched delicately on the edge of the mattress while she, Dean and Sam stare at the motel’s shitty TV. Fingers brush Dean’s own and he feels his cheeks get hot. Sweat gathers at the back of his neck and under his arms and he swallows thickly.
. He turns back to the fridge to get a bottle of bubbly and starts filling glasses, handing three to Dean. Dean, with a lopsided tissue paper crown on his head and a face flushed from good beer, doesn’t spill a drop as he makes his way to the Dean Cave.
“Further north,” Cas continues. “We’d go as far as the ocean, up where people don’t care about who you are or where you came from as long as you keep to yourself. We could live in a cottage on a cliff, and sleep in the same bed, a-and…” he trails off. “Or we could get on a ship. Travel past England and to Rome, or Greece — Balthazar said men laying together is more common, there. And that the water is warmer.” He shakes his head. “Imagine bathing in a loch that isn’t cold?”
gorgeous, and he was made for this; being out here, racing: a wild thing in the wild, finally. Free.
They’re grinning too widely to do anything but touch and breathe against each other, hands skating and skimming and trailing—pants, boxers, socks and shoes in a heap on the floor—stumbling against the counter, grabbing onto the shower curtain—
Castiel steps backward, their fingers clinging until the last possible moment, reaching out even once they’re forced to let go. Their gaze is unwavering from one another, and Cas holds it until he can’t anymore, until he’s forced to turn and run towards the castle, because if he walks he’ll end up back in Dean’s arms.
But Dean only brushes his fingers over the root of his cock before pulling away. “Yeah,” he says, tugging at Castiel’s bottom lip with his teeth. He guides Cas into a seated position as he licks his palm and touches his prick.
He hears her re-adjusting—shift the camera on her shoulder, get a little comfier. Dean rolls his eyes. He’s not an idiot; he knows that their team has a helluva story: the rivalry between them and the Russians, his untimely med-evac, the love story that followed… they’re the favourites and they’ve been first to every camp so far, but Dean knows that means fuck all. One nav error and you’ve lost time, one misstep and you twisted your ankle. People are tired; they get hurt, make dumb fuckin’ decisions, and all it takes is one mistake to get heli’d out to the nearest hospital.
“I hate feeling like this,” Castiel mumbles. “I hate wanting to be… normal. There is no normal! Human sexuality is complicated, and complex, and I’ve spent
He pants into his bicep, arm covering his eyes as if the fact that he can’t see his partner makes him invisible. Despite the fact that this is just how he is, it never seems to get any easier. Especially on nights like tonight, where he’d been so excited by the prospect of—of being normal.
, Dean is gonna mcfreaking lose it. The thing came in a discrete little box eight hours before they were forced inside for who knows how long, and he’s lost count of the amount of times he’s had to relocate it since.
He likes lying in bed until he’s sore with it, stretching out on the memory foam like a king languishing among his pillows. He likes rolling over onto on a cool patch of sheet, and cuddling into the covers, and hooking his toes over the end of the mattress. Castiel likes holding Dean. Being held by him; tucked up against his chest or with a palm half-sunk into his boxer-briefs. Pressing kisses to neck and shoulders and the line of his hair.
. Because he is certain. Because he—a being known for its sameness—has been forever changed by one imperfect, loving human. Because Dean Winchester is love incarnate.
“Mostly,” Cas says. “I just… Well, I wrote about how thankful I am. To know you. To love you. Doing so has been a gift, Dean. Really.”
He presses a fuckin’ embarrassing little kiss to the tip of Dean’s cock, head pillowed on his freckled thigh as he grins and presses a kiss there, too. Still heaving from his orgasm, Dean throws an arm over his face amid a stuttered breath. “Jesus,” he mumbles.
“You’re—welcome,” Cas says haltingly. He can’t stop staring, but he thinks maybe that’s okay. That this instance of overwhelming love and appreciation is the only one where unabashed looking is not a social faux pas. Hesitantly, he leans in. Dean meets him halfway.
—under wraps. It just sorta… happened that way. ’Sides, it ain’t like they’ve actually talked about what getting married even means; Cas technically doesn’t exist, and Dean is somehow both wanted and legally dead—that shit isn’t really conducive to any kind of legal arrangement. As for the spiritual stuff, well—Dean’s pretty sure he and Cas have had enough god-talk to last two lifetimes.
has ferried supplies from system to system. Their suppliers were kept anonymous, their clients even more so; the whole thing had been shrouded in such secrecy that by the time it had been revealed, he’d had trouble understanding. All this time, and Dean Winchester was in the business of compassion. Of kindness.
Whether or not they’re supposed to kiss at this juncture seems irrelevant; their mouths press in a kind of affection that is almost painful in its sweetness. Fingers curl more tightly around each other’s wrists, and when they pull apart, Cas is too much for his body, the grin on his face so big it’ll split it in two.
, he should be living in a palace made of greenery, in a forest leagues from here, dressed in finery and with a circlet adorning his brow. They would call him
He follows when tugged up, kissing Dean proud and sloppy, his own heart racing. “God,” Dean mumbles, returning his affections sluggishly. “I think you sucked my brain out through my dick.” He grins so wide their kisses are made impossible. “Can I…?”
Dean taped it under a kitchen chair only to have the thing come unstuck and nearly give him a heart attack. He hid it on top of the laundry machine, in a pair of his socks, between the pages of one of his cookbooks—no matter where Dean put the stupid ring, Castiel somehow managed to almost find it.
They kiss for a good long while, until Dean is pressed back into the mattress and Cas is a useless, warm lump on top of him. What they’re doing can definitely be characterized as swapping spit; their every movement lazy and deep, hands wandering, bodies tangled and moving together as if in a prelude to sex despite the fact that neither of them seem particularly inclined to get there.
books. The angel and the older brother. You ever read those?” He’s holding out a hand, presumably for a credit card. Cas has this funny, weird little smile on his face and Dean is pretty sure he looks like he’s... y’know, that little pinwheel of death. The buffering. “Uh, sir?” the kid asks. “I need a card.”
Dean snorts but obliges, mumbling about finding a spot in town. Cas nods and shoves a hand down the back of his boxers. Hums. Squeezes. The ring sits heavy on his finger and he can’t stop himself from grinning.
“I mean, all that really matters is what feels good, right? As long as there are ways to make you feel good, shouldn’t matter how that happens; if it’s not sex, then it’s not sex. If it’s making me feel good, or getting your hair played with or keeping a collection of cheeses, then… what-the-fuck-ever. If it’s not good for you, then why the hell would it ever be good for me? Plus, I mean, eighteen years with the same person is—it’s work. Like, it’s great, and losing my bad boy rep was totally worth it, but… I wouldna done it if I wasn’t just embarrassingly in love with you.” He pushes around his food with a shrug, his cheeks glowing with a blush that colours the tips of his ears. “So, uh. Yeah.”
Tracy narrows her eyes at this, but lets it go. “And what about when he told you he wanted to do Eco-Challenge again? Must’ve been a shock.”
Dean stares at the bathroom door until some asshole walks through it, immediately whirling around to frown at the mirror. His eyes start to prickle and he squeezes them shut.
Dean hums, hands gently cupping Cas’s jaw. Cas’s fingers clutch tight to Dean’s wrists, blue eyes wide and wet as Dean pulls away to rub a thumb over his cheek. “Baby…” he breathes. His own vision is blurring. “I love you.” A beat. “Can—I wanna—”
“Obviously,” Dean echoes. He shoves his hands in his pockets. “So, uh, take me on a date, stud.” He looks nervous, Cas thinks, which is ridiculous and relatable all at once. Outside, the rising sun paints swathes of pink and orange across the horizon.
“Good looking guy like you? You’ll get another chance.” Des gives him a small smile. “But I think I should get you home tonight.”
Dean smoothes down his flannel and bites his lip. Fuck. They lost the reservation. There’s no record of them. They're not wearing the right clothes and the card was flagged and they know and they’re gonna—
Cas’s mouth is half open and they knock teeth, but they’re old pros by now, and for a second the cheering and the Dollar Tree poppers and noisemakers drown out the sounds of their family and it’s… a kiss. A good kiss. A
“Dean?” Cas murmurs into the crook of his neck, shifting to press his chest more firmly to Dean’s back. He wriggles his toes into the cool sand.
Dean grins. “Yeah?” he asks, looking up through his lashes because he’s a dick. “Was it about how hot I am?”
“Bathroom,” Cas supplies, depositing a kiss to the corner of his mouth. Dean’s reciprocation lags with exhaustion.
Dean nods through the sense-memory of it; getting to the top of the falls ready to swim across the pools on top, the water leeching the cold from him until he was blue and purple and stopped shivering. He’d been so cold for so long he didn’t notice anything but the fact that he wanted to fucking lie on the riverbank and sleep. “Uh, yeah,” Dean mutters turning back to the camp entrance. “Whole team was straddling the line of cold and hypothermic for like half the swim, but I just… I didn’t notice how cold I was. Didn’t realize until we got out, but we couldn’t stop to get a rescue or nothin’—”
, because… because even twisted and conflicted as you were, you radiated love in all the ways I didn’t know I craved to feel. How was I supposed to pledge myself to an absent father when you were right there? When my own doubts were later echoed in your hands and the steady beat of your heart a hundredfold?
The angels laid siege to Hell for forty years. It was by happenstance that Castiel was the one to find the Righteous Man; twisted and smirking in front of his rack, his soul still shone with the power of a thousand suns.
Dean shoves Sam’s pint glass into his chest. The stuff sloshes over the sides and wets his shirt and jeans and shoes. Something in Dean quiets a little. “Shut up about the Mark, okay? I’m good. Happy new year.”
It’s more about the way their hands move and tangle and squeeze, their mouths matching the lazy, exploratory pace of their fingers; these hands that bare the marks of violent toil, now made soft in the light of a motel bathroom. When they drift apart, Dean buries his face in Cas’s neck, breathing him in under the muck and the dirt. Cas’s hand drifts up to rest in his hair.
Castiel toys with the edge of his shemagh, exposing his mouth just enough to take a bite of the spiced, juicy fruit. He had always been told he was a wild thing; too curious, too engaged, too concerned. The Edenish—the true Edenish, who trace their lineage back to the Seraphim—they see through the paltry physical realm into what’s beyond. They are calm and of steady disposition. Unbiased in their opinions and unerringly fair in their judgements. They are above the weakness of the nephil—the commoner, the peasant, tainted by their ancestors’ desire to lay with those from other realms. Half-bloods.
