“Right now, there is not much you can do,” The doctor said. Upon seeing the stricken expressions on their faces, he added on, “But you can go inside and talk to him. He is awake.”
Detention was interesting to say the least. When Dean walked in, there was no one else there besides the school gym teacher, Mr. Jefferson, who instructed him to sign in and to go sit at one of the desks. He was then told to get a paper out and write an essay on what he did wrong.
“Okay, this is his husband. I can take a message for him,” Dean said, swallowing down the lump that had formed in his throat.
Sam appeared to contemplate this for a few seconds as he scanned over the delivery menus that were sprawled out on the kitchen table. Apparently, he wasn’t too hungry because he then said, “Yeah, I guess we can wait until dad comes home to order some food.”
“Shit, I think I need to sleep for another decade.” Ash said and rubbed his forehead and then ran his fingers through his hair.
Once he was near the stairs that lead to the front porch of his house, he heard Castiel call his name. He turned around and saw Castiel walking to him.
And Dean definitely did not like seeing the look back on his dad’s face, especially when he was proven right when his dad sat down at one of the kitchen stools and said, “I’ve got bad news.”
"Oh thank god." John said as he saw Dean sitting on the couch. He thanked Naomi and took Dean into his other arm. When John was done, he put Dean down and let him say good-bye to Castiel. Then they went home.
a wonderful start. Now Cas wished that he had taken the car. That way he wouldn’t have been early and he wouldn’t have run into Zack and his posse.
mention her." John had balled his hands into fists and his eyes held a wrath that Dean had never seen before.
Dean was sleeping on the couch when he heard a buzzing noise. It took him a few minutes before he was fully awake and realized that it was his phone that was buzzing.
Surprisingly, the day had begun as any normal day could. Dean woke up around 7:30, took a shower, and got dressed. Then he went to wake up Sam and after fifteen minutes of arguing with his brother and finally getting through with him, Dean went downstairs to eat some cereal.
"Cas, bad things happen to everyone. And I understand what you're going through. Believe me, I know what it feels like to lose a mother. And I still miss her, I do. But you can't stop living just because your mother isn't anymore." Dean said.
The threats had started right after they had gotten back from school about an hour ago. Trust Inias Milton to know when his kids were supposed to come back from school but never actually pick them up.
“That annoying thing with the stupid cuff. I can't watch my show because of your obsessive behavior.” Sam said slamming his hand down on the cushion. “It’s no wonder you were named after grandma, what with all fussing over that mirror for the past thirty minutes.”
Castiel looked out the window. It was raining and a droplet of rain had just rolled down the window. “He’s my father, Dean.”
After grabbing the mail, he walked up the stairs, fished out his key and opened the door. He was about to get his shirt and sweatpants from the futon when he saw it was occupied.
“So…” Castiel retorted back. Apparently, Dean wasn’t the only one who was having trouble with words.
Summer was coming to an end and though Dean felt like it was ending too quickly, he knew that that was not quite true. In actuality, it had been a very eventful summer. While some events were tragic (such as the death of aunt Karen whom Dean still missed to this day), others were pretty sweet. Dean had gotten his first job and so did Castiel. Castiel had gotten a job as a lifeguard and Dean sure did love visiting his boyfriend at the pool whenever he could since he enjoyed watching Castiel working in his uniform.
"What are you doing here?" As he said that, he shifted his gaze and raised his eyebrows when he noticed Anna was there as well.
Once he realized that he had to head out soon, Dean changed and sprayed on as much cologne as he could. Maybe it was his smell that had bothered Cas the night before;
Later after they had eaten lunch, they were in Sam’s room researching for their project and Dean, who had been surfing the Internet on his laptop to search for ideas for their project had looked up and noticed that the boy was yet again twiddling with the string of his necklace as he stared at his laptop screen.
“I don’t know, Anna.” Castiel shook his head. “I don’t know, I don’t know. Why does this keep- ” He let out a shaky breath.
“Oh don’t huff, I’ll ask Alfie and Theo to come with us.” Asher said. “Plus I don’t really know about you but I really need to get some.”
Inias opened his mouth to say something but before he could, Anna interrupted him and said, “And to answer your question, we are leaving, good luck trying to find a family that actually cares about you. C'mon, Cas, let's go. ”
At exactly seven p.m., John called and told Naomi that Dean now had a little brother. Dean being his usual sneaky self, was actually listening in on the phone conversation and had momentarily forgotten that no one knew and said, "What's his name, daddy?"
“That ain’t no way to raise kids-” Bobby shook his head and added, “I mean god knows how torn up I was after Karen died-” Dean watched Ellen squeeze Bobby’s hand gently “-But that’s no way to raise your kids.”
People came to his house every day with food and condolences and Cas let them in but he barely talked to them.
“Oh I think you’ll like who I bring to the party.” Meg snickered. “Remember that blue-eyed friend of yours? You guys used to be so inseparable back in the days.” She giggled.
, I know it’s fucked up, but I still love him and he doesn’t have a lot of time left here and I want him to enjoy it while he can. And believe me, I know what he did was wrong but it’s too late to get into that and I know that if you were in a similar situation with Jess, you’d do the same.”
Cas blushed, hid his face in his hands and groaned. Dean pried Cas’s hands off his face. “Don’t be embarrassed, it was cute.”
Sam exchanged glances with Gabe. The kid shrugged. Then Sam looked back at Dean and said, “Um.. no one.”
“Oh look, who is that drunk stranger in our house? Do you recognize him, Anna? I think we should call the cops on him.” Castiel replied back.
“On one condition, Dean.” Chuck smiled slyly. Dean was beginning to think the guy never stopped smiling.
Cas, who had already changed and was sitting on Dean’s bed smiled up at Dean and replied, “Yeah we did.”
Ellen, of course didn’t believe the story, not one bit. She called the next morning and warned Dean that Asher better be back home by 12:00 O’clock sharp or else there would be serious consequences. No one dared to mess with Ellen, as everyone knew how serious she was about rules. So the result was that Dean helped Asher pack all of his things as quickly as possible and then they took turns using the bathroom to make themselves look as acceptable as possible after a long night of drinking and partying.
, I miss her so much.” It had been years since his mother had passed away but that didn’t change the fact that he still missed her to this day.
Jo twirled the saltshaker in her hand, swaying it from one side to another, making sure it did not fall. “So.. you want to tell me what that whole thing was about?”
“I don’t necessarily think-” Jo kicked Dean’s leg under the table and he winced. “Um, yeah, Ellen, it’s nice and all, but kind of gross.” Dean pulled a face, only half hoping he was being convincing.
“If you want to talk about history, can we do it later? Because I was kinda trying to sleep.” Cas could’ve sworn he could see Dean roll his eyes, even in the dark.
“Ellen talked with us and she said that if everything goes as planned, most likely a foster family is going to adopt us.”
“You heard me.” Dean sighed. “Now what I’d like to know why you were getting an MRI and why in the hell you didn’t fucking tell me.” Dean’s voice rose with every word.
Dean tried to say something back but the darkness overtook him. The next thing he knew he was that he was lying in a bed at Saint Luke's Hospital.
You see, a few months ago he had asked Cas where he had gotten the pair of fangs when he saw them to which Cas said, “They’re real. I’m a vampire.” Dean in return snorted like it was the funniest thing he had heard and said, “Sure, you are, and I’m Bigfoot.” Cas then tilted his head in confusion and for a minute there, Dean thought that Cas was actually considering that Dean was really Bigfoot. But only for a minute because it was a crazy idea to even think about. So he ruffled Cas’s hair and asked him how his day was.
So to him, it didn’t make sense that the man was saying that someone had taken his wife. Maybe he meant it figuratively.
Castiel wasn't sure what to expect but he definitely didn't expect Dean laughing so much that he fell on the floor and wouldn't get up for a few minutes.
He slammed his laptop shut, gathered his stuff and got up. He started walking to the door when he heard Sam yelling back after him. “Where are you going?
And if Dean hadn’t been used to the quiet way Castiel talked, he probably wouldn’t have heard him. Oh but he heard him. He heard him loud and clear. And hadn’t this been his plan all along? Hadn’t he been waiting for this conversation to take place these past few weeks?
“And if something is really wrong with me, I need you to promise me that you won't tell Cas about it.”
When they got back to Dean’s and Sam’s house, Sam immediately went to sleep. Cas and Dean retired to Dean’s room. And while Dean went to the bathroom and changed, Cas had texted Anna telling her that there he would be staying at the Winchesters and after reassuring his sister that he was okay, he changed into the pajamas Dean had lent him.
A few months had gone by and Dean and Cas had gotten closer again. They joked and had conversations like new friends would and most of the time it was easy to forget the shared history they had.
Cas wanted to hold him until the pain was gone, kiss his body all over and tell him that everything would be okay. He wanted to press Dean into the mattress and kiss him till he remembered nothing but the precious moments shared between them in this bed. But he knew he can’t do that.
Sam’s house was interesting, to say the least. Rather than there being family photos, the walls were decorated with portraits of weird symbols, symbols that quite honestly looked like witchcraft.
“Don’t talk back, smartass.” Inias bared his teeth and raised his fist. Castiel recoiled. Thankfully, Anna came in at that moment.
Sam, who had been watching in TV in the living room amusingly glanced at his older brother before looking back to the screen.
Jo pointed her fork at him with narrowed eyes and said, “Don’t call me that. What are you, my mother?”
Apparently that was the wrong thing to say. Something dark and unreadable clouded over Castiel’s face. The smile was gone. “You think it’s that easy?”
Despite living across from each other nearly their whole lives, neither boy had been to the other’s house. If Dean was being quite honest, he was actually quite scared to find out what he was going to find in the house. He knew logically that it would just be a regular house, just like any other house he had been to so far.
On Thursday, Dean discovered that his boyfriend, Cas was indeed a vampire. Thinking back, Dean should have known it all along. All the signs had pointed to it. He just ignored them because actually believing that Cas could be anything other than human was just too preposterous and frankly insane.
Over the few months after he began his treatment and more people became aware of his illness, Dean had gotten some visitors. Besides Sam and Bobby, Jo came every week, usually on Sundays though sometimes she liked to come on Fridays. Once, Dean teased her that she had nothing better to do than hang out with a sick guy on Friday but then Jo burst out in tears and Dean stopped saying shit like that.
“Fine.” Dean huffed and hung up the phone. He knew that Cas would come to pick him up anyway. This was where they had met after all.
“You alright?” Dean asked and Cas could only nod in response. Just as Dean was about to hand him the books that Michael had thrown on the floor, everything fell silent and a stern voice rang out. “What is going on here?”
“So any ideas for the project?” Dean said as he hung up his coat and then took Castiel’s to do the same thing.
Even so many years later, Dean was still hiding his feelings behind jokes but Cas knew him well enough to see that Dean was just scared as he was, probably even more than Cas. So, Cas made no comment and snuggled up to Dean while they watched the movie.
“Dad just died,” Sam said again. “And I don’t even remember mom.” Sam’s lip trembled. “How is that fair? How is that fucking fair?” He shouted and then tears started to roll down his cheeks.
As Dean mumbled, “Shit,” and turned to turn the faucet off, Ruby sauntered away, back into the dining room.
Dean threw his hands up in the air (he had never been one for dramatics but this moment definitely called for the dramatic hands) and said, “No, don’t. I just- I need some space" before going to his bedroom and slamming the door close.
No one came that night when Dean prayed. He shouted at the skies and yet his prayers were not answered because a few days later Cas took his final breath.
"Dean, let's be honest. I haven't been a great dad in a while." John sighed and then added, "But that ends today. What do you say, you, me and Sammy go to the park tomorrow?"
“Jo, I can be wrong about a lot of things but one thing I can tell you is that older siblings never stop caring for their younger siblings.” Dean gave a small smile. “Trust me, I know.”
Ruby laughed. “Yeah but he’s genuinely nice and I like him. He actually told me he had a conversation with you and told me about Dean so we decided to drive here right away to pay our respects.”
“I’m going to do my homework, father.” Castiel said, tapping his fingers anxiously against his pant leg.
Dean shot up out of his bed. He coughed and swiped his hair from his sweaty forehead. He felt his cheeks and found them damp.
“Of course, of course,” Dean said. “Are there any other things that you’ve been keeping from me for the past two years that I should know about?”
It had been several hours since the ceremony had begun and quite honestly, Dean couldn’t wait to get the hell out of the auditorium. It was very humid and his gown and cap were itchy and he just wanted to get the hell out of there. He wished that they would call his name already because this was getting ridiculous.
Once they left, John patted the spot on the bed just like he had done moments before with Sam. Dean contemplated it.
But it wasn’t his business so he just nodded and said, “Yeah, I know your brother. He’s on the basketball team, right?”
“Do tell your current boyfriend why Meg was such a great girlfriend.” He probably shouldn’t have mentioned the word boyfriend since they were only together for a few hours now and Dean didn’t even know what Castiel thought they were. But Castiel chose to ignore that part.
Castiel cracked a smile. “Don’t worry, I know what we have to do. I can tell you after lunch.” Dean was about to tell him where the kitchen was but then he realized as he saw Castiel walk there that Castiel remembered.
“Home? As in heav-” Dean started off but couldn’t finish because Chuck interrupted him, “No, he’s at your home, you know the bunker.”
like he had helped save the world. He just got into a fight with an asshole that thought he was better than everyone else. His brow furrowed as he registered the other half of what Meg had said.
After months and months of meetings and negotiations Cas had gotten a book deal. Now, he sat at his desk, staring at his computer for a long time, not sure where he would begin. He glanced over and saw the picture of Dean smiling back at him. He had put it up there when he moved out of the house and into this apartment. There were too many memories at that place and staying there had been out of the question.
It wasn't very late so he hoped that the Miltons weren't sleeping. He sighed in relief when he saw the lights were still on and rang the doorbell. Anna, Cas's older sister, opened the door.
A few seconds passed in silence. Then Sam said, “Hey, I don’t care who you date and I’m sure dad won’t have a bad reaction either.”
Dean was four years old when he found out that he was going to be a big brother. After a few curious questions, his parents decided to sit down and explain to him why his mommy's belly was getting big. When they finished talking, they smiled at Dean expectantly.
They all went out to a diner. Dean, Ash, Alfie, Castiel, Sam, John, and even Anna. John allowed them to order whatever they wanted. For the first time in months, Castiel felt truly happy. In the coming months, he would wish that the feeling had stayed with him.
As he recounted what happened, he was looking at Cas, who was listening to him intently,  nodding along in all the right places, and looking so earnestly at Dean when it hit him.
Despite his detention earlier in the week, Ellen and his dad still let Dean go to the party with Jo. Ellen, however, warned both her daughter and Dean that if she could smell even the tiniest bit of alcohol on them after they got home, they would not be allowed to leave the house for the next month. Dean and Jo rolled their eyes at Ellen, behind her back of course, but nonetheless abided by her rule.
Dean and Cas were at the park hanging out and Dean was telling the story of Ruby being over to tutor Sam and how worried he was that Ruby would try something.
"Let's not pretend that you haven't heard worse." She gave him a pointed look. Castiel wondered how his sister could still be so logical even when she was half-drunk.
Jo rolled her eyes and said, “We get it mom but if you don’t remember, I can take care of myself as I do have a black belt.”
“The sanctuary was our sacred place. It was the place where we would gather to teach and learn magic and discuss witch business. And
Castiel parked the car in their garage. To say the commute was uncomfortable was an understatement.  Castiel had turned on the radio hoping to maybe get Dean to comment on his music choice. But Dean stared out the window the whole time.
Dean rolled his eyes but found he couldn’t answer her question. Who was Cas to him? His best friend. His soulmate. His everything. If he was being honest. Even now, after a year of not talking, Cas still meant everything to him. He didn’t say any of that though to Charlie.
“You get it, huh?” Meg looked up from her essay and saw Dean fidgeting with the strand on his hoodie. “Okay, now do you get how to read the silence sign in the library because sometimes I swear, Winchester, it amazes me how you’ve managed to do well in your classes when you don't even pay half the attention you need to.”
"Anyway, back to what you asked, I did see the bruises and I tried to talk him but that friend of yours is just too stubborn for his own good." Dean laughed a bit but then grew silent.
He wasn’t that great at Chemistry- no that was Ash, who Dean was pretty sure liked the subject so much partly because of his obsession with the show,
He glanced back and forth from his computer and the picture. He still missed his husband terribly but the grief had become a little easier to handle.
The elevator had just arrived and Cas stepped into it. Before the doors closed, Cas said, “I’m sorry Sam but I have to go.”
“Yeah and what’s worse is that he constantly forgets he has another son, honestly I don’t even know what his name is,” Ellen said, a frown forming on her face.
Then Dean got up and locked the room. When he came back to his bed, he kissed Cas again and then pushed him down gently onto the bed. The world outside was soon forgotten.
“Yep, going to KU. Haven’t decided on what I’ll major in it yet though,” Dean said and swallowed, hoping Cas wouldn’t pick up on the tone of his voice changing. Cas didn’t know about him having cancer and that he was going in for chemotherapy in a week and Dean was going to keep it that way, no matter what Sam had said.
Before Castiel could say anything, John came back bearing several blankets and pillows. "I hope you're okay with these.. they're a bit old but you know I couldn't really find it in me to throw them – " John turned his head to see what Castiel was looking at.
After Chuck grabbed a teabag and placed it in the mug, he turned back to Dean and smiled that creepy smile of his again. “I told you, don’t worry, he’s safe and he’ll be fine.”
Honestly, she didn’t know him. Not really. Sure, they ran in the same circles and saw each other at these parties, but they had never really interacted before that. And seeing as their senior year was almost over, Dean didn’t feel like making any more friends, but he didn’t say that. Instead he said, “Yeah, I think so. Meg, right?”
He wondered if it was awful of him to be relieved that for once, nothing was wrong with his dad or his brother. Of course, he felt bad for Bobby and he had always loved Karen, over the years, she had been like an aunt to him. But for a second, Dean was relieved. Then of course, he sobered up and said, “Okay, so when’s the funeral?”
It turned out that Castiel was going to start his first day as well and was putting up the same fight. After conversing for a while, both mothers came up with a plan. Naomi asked Castiel to get on the phone and Mary then handed the phone over to Dean. Once he talked to Castiel, Dean relaxed and let Mary put his coat on.
“You know I was going to-” John coughed, then cleared his throat. “I was going tell you before, it wasn’t right what I said.”
“Dean, before you go, I want to ask you something,” Ellen interrupted as she took a bite of her toast, scrunching up her nose and adding more jam on it. Dean tried not to laugh, knowing that if Ellen was stopping him to talk to him about something, it was probably important.
"Yes?" She turned back and quirked an eyebrow. Dean didn't know much about make-up but he had known Mrs. Milton long enough to notice that her face seemed to be painted in more colors than it usually was. And when he leaned closer, he thought that he could see the outlines of a bruise around her right eye but he decided to put it off. He had more important matters to discuss.
“Yeah I know. I just feel bad for Ash.” Castiel sighed, “Well, I have to go to first my class.” After he gave Dean a short kiss, Cas ran off to his first period.
"None of us are happy-"She whispered. "-That doesn't mean that suicide is the solution, you know that, right?" She looked up at him.
And where did Cas get off crossing his arms and saying things like that. Dean wasn’t even sure if Cas was safe here. All he knew about cancer was from soap operas that he swore he never watched.

“It’s fine.” Dean said. What? He was going to yell at this motherfucker. He was going to curse him to the moon and back and he goes with, ‘
Chuck smiled thinly, “Dean let’s cut the act, I know why you’re here. They don’t call me the almighty for nothing.”
“That girl is either on drugs or so delusional, it’s not even funny.” Ruby whispered under her breath.
Summer went by quickly. Neither Dean nor Cas had noticed, for they were too engrossed in their daily activities and plans. They took turns coming over to each other’s houses. Most days, Sam would tag along and, though Dean complained, Cas knew it was just for show. Other times, Ash and Alfie would come over and they would all head to the park.
“Michael.” Oh yes, Michael. Dean knew exactly who Michael was. The senior who every guy wanted to be and every girl wanted to be with; too bad he was gay. Although it was only rumored, Dean could confirm the rumor as he was one of the few people who Vic trusted and confided in and Dean knew that they were together. Dean wondered if Michael's little brother knew.
Dean said nothing back as he knew there wasn’t much he could say to comfort his friend. Instead, he changed the subject of conversation to something else and soon talk of Alfie was forgotten.
Dean call him. Apparently being a chef freed you of having to pick up your phone, even when it was your freaking lunch break. And Dean knew that it couldn’t be Sam because he was most likely at school.
The trial was set to take place a few days before Christmas. Dean hoped it would be a fast one and that the scumbag that was Inias Milton got what he deserved. Actually, Dean hoped he got a lot more than what he deserved. As the days dragged on, Dean couldn’t help feel more anxious. If he was feeling this way, he couldn’t even begin to imagine how Castiel was feeling.
And see if this was a TV show, something life-altering would have happened right then but since this isn’t a TV show, Dean and Cas just get up and start packing stuff to take with them on the adventure that awaits them. And neither of them mention what just transpired between them.
As he walked to the exit, he noticed that there weren’t many people in the café. He was pretty sure he was the last one there. It had been a busy night but the customers that had come in had all mysteriously disappeared. Well, that’s the way it seemed to Dean, who was too enthralled in his latest article assignment to notice.
Upon hearing his father's voice, Castiel shut the book faster than lighting speed and looked up. Anna stood next to their father, her arms crossed, wearing a sour expression. Then again, she always looked annoyed. Naomi had deemed it, "the rebellious teenage stage." Castiel hoped that becoming a teenager wouldn't cause him to dye his hair a different color. He often wondered what had so strongly influenced his sister's choice.
Dean gave a giggle. Mary's heart almost exploded right there. Even though she had heard that sound many times before and was
“Well your pupils are dilated, you're blushing like crazy and you didn’t make eye contact when I asked you to prove your point.”
“Crap?” Dean muttered, still looking around the house and not really paying attention to what Sam had been saying. Even something about the house seemed familiar. It felt like
While Castiel took a shower, Dean told John about their day and what they had done. He especially made sure to mention that Castiel ate nutella and peanut butter together with such deep awe that John couldn't help but laugh.
Sam noticed the weird expression on Dean’s face as the older boy looked around the house and said, “My dad’s really into the supernatural stuff.” He laughed, “He believes in all that crap.”
Dean had been packing his backpack and when he noticed that someone was standing in front of his desk, he turned around and scowled. “What?”
“Now I don’t know what was going on and I don’t really care. We already have more problems than we should. Whatever it is that you guys were fighting over, I’ll let you figure it out on your own. I’m just warning you that this better be the last time I see either one of you awake past curfew hours and fighting with each other in my house. And don’t forget that you could have woken up Sammy.”
He was a bit nervous. They hadn’t shared a bed before. In the past, there was always two beds and they hadn’t been dating back then. And sure, they had made out on this bed several times and had done some other stuff but they had never slept in it together. This was
“No buts, Mr. Singer, fighting another student is unacceptable behavior, no matter what the reason may be and you will serve detention.” Finally, he turned to Cas. “Mr. Novak, I presume that you were not involved in the fight, correct?”
“Oh shut up.” Sam said in retort and shoved Dean away causing Dean to trip over his shoes, which in turn made Sam laugh. And Dean was glad that Sam was laughing, even if it was at his expense.
When he got home, Dean stepped out of the car before his dad parked the car in the driveway. He hoped Ellen wouldn’t be as angry with him for getting another detention if he entered the house with his dad as back up.
He had a calculating expression on, planning on how to conquer and win over his next victims. They of course weren't aware of it.
“Fine,” Sam retorted. “But just know I don’t think it’s a good idea that you’ve decided not to tell him.”
Luckily Cas didn’t live far from Dean in this reality and Dean was able to find his house fairly quickly.
A/n: Please review. I am very sorry for the late update and for the short chapter. I hope that you will enjoy this chapter and I will try to write and update the next one as soon as possible.
“Yeah okay, I guess I like it. The sun will never set on our relationship.” Dean leaned forward and placed a kiss on Castiel’s lips. “No matter where we are.”
sorry, his schooling career. At first they were buddies. They helped each other with homework and hung out during recess with the other boys. Plus, they would switch lunch bags once in a while (not because they didn’t like what their parents had packed them but because they loved the element of surprise). Weirdos, right?
“Now help me with this, Winchester or I’ll tell your dearest Cas about that field trip accident you had during freshman year.” Jo smiled cruelley.
"Promise." His voice was drifting, which was a sign of his tiredness. Within minutes, they arrived at their home and Dean was soon put to bed.
“Recently, me and Cas, we talked and he said that after graduation, he’s going to go back to visit his foster family,” Dean swallowed past the lump in his throat and bit his lip.
Cas came up to him and wrapped him in a hug. “Dean, it’s ok, it’s only me, you don’t have to pretend. Shh, it’s okay, it’s okay.”
Dean glared but composed himself quickly. “Fine, Castiel, I’m sorry about what I said. It was wrong and stupid of me.”
Apparently Dean hadn’t been as stealthy as he thought he was because, within seconds, blue eyes made eye contact with his eyes and he almost fell out of his chair a second time. For an athlete, he sure was very coordinated.
This brought on a mixed chorus of cheering and groaning, and if Dean was being honest, he was a bit disappointed, as he had already started studying for the exam. Everyone fell quiet when there was a firm knock on the door.
After they finished planning out their road trip, Dean decided to stop by at Sam and Jess’s apartment before they went on their trip. Jess was away at work but Sam was at home and boy, did he not like Dean's idea.
." For a six-year old, Castiel sure did have a strong gaze. Dean would've been a bit scared had he not known him all his life.
“I know,” Dean said simply. John had explained to Dean and Sam that if everything was to go as planned, the foster family wanted to pick up Castiel and Anna before Christmas so that they could celebrate the holiday as a family and get used to one another. That meant that they only had a few days left together.
They ate lunch and watched T.V. When, they were done with their food, Dean decided to ask the question that had been plaguing his mind since the beginning of the semester.
Dean decided to wait for his friends on the couch and took his phone out of his pocket, hoping to avoid awkward conversation with Jo’s friends, but within seconds, the couch squeaked as someone sat down next to him.
Dean heard some rustling before Sam had grabbed the phone back. “Hey sorry about that. She’s um a little-
“They’re giving me a full scholarship,” Sam whispered and if it was anyone else, they probably wouldn’t have heard him but Dean managed to hear him anyway.
Later, when Dean was settled in his bed and Cas was in his inflatable bed, Dean turned over the edge of his bed and turned on the radio.
“I know I should be mad with him and I am, I’m so angry.” Castiel said and then looked back at Dean.
“Yeah well now you know.” Cas retorted. “Plus I don’t think I’m the one to whom you should be apologizing.”
"Hello, it was nice of you to invite us," Naomi Milton said as she smiled and reached out her hand expectantly.
The music blasting from the house could be heard a few blocks away. That didn’t seem to matter to Victor Henricksen, who was the party host. He was walking around his house, laughing as he greeted the guests.
After making sure that today’s work was saved, he turned off the computer, paid the bill and walked out of the café.
“That is precisely what we are going to discuss today.” John said as he walked back into the room, followed by Sam, who sleepily mumbled, a “Morning” and went about finding a bowl for himself.
John rubbed his hands over his face and in that moment, Dean didn't see his father; he saw a man who was shaped by the grief and loss that had forced him to age quickly.
Something about Sam speaking about his brother felt wrong, but Dean shook it off. It was probably nothing.
“Nothing.” Both boys muttered. Then they glared at each other for saying the same thing at the same time.
"What would you know what's good for me? Maybe I want to end up an alcoholic like dad." She laughed again and narrowed her eyes. "Better yet, maybe I want to end up like mom. Suicide is just the way to go, isn't it, Cas?"
“Why not? You don’t like the rules? Or you don’t like Sammy? Or what, you don’t like me?” Dean whispered-shout. “What did we do wrong?”
Dean snickered, nodding in agreement as he walked over to shove all of his notebooks and books into his backpack.
He stared up at the ceiling and did his best to hold his tears at bay. He, however, failed miserably. And when Sam came back into the room, noticed him crying, didn’t say anything about it and instead just sat in the armchair next to him, he was eternally grateful.
Dean was ready for his second semester of college. He couldn’t believe time had flown by so fast. It felt like he had just started college.
Both boys were always happy to see each other. They loved to play with each other; it didn't matter what game it was as long as they were together. When the time came for Castiel to leave, neither wanted to part. Their protests would sometimes lead both mothers to exasperation.
But it was. Castiel kept avoiding him like the plague. He made sure to wake up earlier so he could eat when Dean and the others were still sleeping. And whenever John was able to drop them off at school before going to work, Castiel would sit on the far end of the car and stare out the window the whole way there.
Jo sighed as she pulled out the chair and sat on the edge of it. She opened her Chemistry textbook and started listing through the pages until she got to the one she needed. Once she took her notebook and pens out and pulled her chair up, only then did she look up and smiled thinly. “Is it that obvious?”
“Dean, you and I both know that I won’t stop asking.” Jo stopped fiddling with the sugar packets. “You can just tell me.”
“Well, if you do decide to go, at least you’ll know someone there.” Dean smiled reassuringly. For some reason, Dean had the strong urge to be there for this boy and to protect him at all costs. Maybe they had been brothers in another life, who knew.
While that was going on, Dean was still holding Sam. He looked down at Sam's face and said, "So you're my little brother, Sammy." Sam's stare intensified.
“Because Dean, he listens to anything you say.” Chuck said as if it was the simplest explanation. “Now are you ready to go back to your own world?”
“About the party…?” Dean scratched the back of his head, stalling for time as he tried to remember. It wasn’t much of a surprise when he drew a blank. “Eh, see it would help if I knew what party you were talking about.”
“It’s a requirement for AP Bio and if I want to get in a good pre-med program, I have to take this class.” Jo sighed.
He rested his forehead on his sister’s shoulder and closed his eyes like he used to do when he was little and she was the only one in the world who could understand him.
And though he was just a seventeen year old and knew he definitely did not qualify for the job, Bobby and John kept insisting that he help out so eventually Dean caved and agreed to help Bobby out at the mechanic shop.
After Dean let go of his little brother, Sam smiled up at him, “Yeah, you too. After the darkness got us, I wasn’t sure where you had disappeared to so I called Cas and he wasn’t answering so I’ve been doing research for the past week to see if I could find you.”
Dean fiddled with the cuff of the sleeve of his dress shirt for what felt like the hundredth time. Dean adjusted his tie and sighed as he looked at himself in the mirror.
“Hello Dean” he said before Dean even entered the room. Then he sat up and sprang into action, “Did it work? Did he agree to fight it?”
"Move out of the way, meanie." He tried to move past her but she didn't let him. Dean had to admit that for an eight year-old girl, she was quite strong.
At that moment, someone in the show laughed and Sam groaned again and this time said, “How can you watch this? I fucking hate Ross.”
Chuck rubbed his jaw, as if that had hurt him, that fucking bastard! One pro tip Dean just learned: don’t try to punch god in the face.
“Dude, that’s not even physically possible.” Dean said, disgust evident in his voice. He really needed new friends.
He ran up to the stage, shook his principal’s hand and took the fake diploma that was thrust into his hand.
Following his gaze, Dean saw that he had been looking at Sam, who was sitting way back in the classroom and was rolling the chain of the necklace he had on between his fingers while frowning down upon it. Dean wondered what that was about but nonetheless turned back in his seat, only to see that Mr.Shurley had already left.
John took Sam to take a bath and then changed him into his pajamas, even though Sam kept insisting that he could do it himself. After putting on Sam's bathrobe, John picked him up and carried him back to the living room.
"All the time." Asher said, then shook his head. "But stop changing the subject. Meg's not the devil."
“Sammy!” Dean exclaimed as he got up from the couch and went to hug his brother. “You’ve missed a lot.”
From where he stood, he could hear Sam’s dad yell at Sam and his brother. From what he gathered, the man had been saying that both Sam and his brother were a waste of space and that they were wasting his time in finding the answer to who had taken their mother away.
Later, when Ms. Milton had given them a break (it was a two hour class) and most of the kids scattered out of the room, Cas stayed behind claiming that he was too engrossed in the book to go anywhere. Meg and Balt rolled their eyes and of course called him a drama queen but said they would bring him something back and then left.
When Dean said nothing in response, Chuck continued, “Why do you think I had you punch Zack? I wanted you to be reminded of what you did, back in the bunker. I wanted you to realize you weren’t mad at Zack or really, at Cas but that you were mad at yourself. I wanted you to see that because maybe if you saw that, you would understand and you would take the right step in direction in talking to Cas about this. Maybe I’m overstepping right now but I haven’t been around in a while and I’ll admit, Cas is one of my favorite ones and I want him to be happy.”
Castiel had been giving Dean the cold shoulder for more than a week and with the trial being this close, Dean was starting to get worried. Castiel hadn’t been mad at him for so long. He usually forgot about the silent treatment after a few minutes, sometimes even minutes. But this time, nothing happened; Castiel was still ignoring him.
Cas, who had been sitting quietly by Dean’s side flipping through a magazine, tossed it to the side and said, “I agree with your brother, Sam. You need to relax and have faith.”
After Cas left, John tentatively sat on Dean’s bed. Dean was lying on the bed and had turned away from his dad.
Instead of answering Mrs. Day’s question, he faced the class and said, “Just wanted to tell you seniors that the finish line isn’t for a few more weeks and to remind
“Right.” He says quietly looking down into his cup. He’s starting to think that maybe coming here wasn’t a good idea. Maybe he should’ve stayed home. He could’ve hung out with his friends another time.
Cas swiveled around so fast that he almost dropped the cups of coffee he was holding and if he wasn’t so nervous, Dean would have laughed.
“Real funny, Dean.” Sam said as he walked to the kitchen. Then he hollered, “Do you want to eat or have you eaten already?”
Shortly after Dean said goodnight, John pulled out the couch for Castiel and Anna and helped them settle in for the night.
They finished the experiment and filled out their worksheets on time. Except then at the end of the lab, their professor decided that that hadn’t been enough torture and said that in addition to the weekly labs they were doing, they’d have to do a mini project outside of class every week with their lab partners. The professor mentioned something about making sure that his students were capturing what they were learning or some crap like that. Dean’s not really sure what it was exactly that he had said because he was more focused on the fact that he would have to spend extra time with Cas. And now he found himself standing in front of Cas’s dorm room, waiting to start working on the project.
After he opened the door, he was met with identical frightened expressions on both of the Milton children, each holding a duffel bag in hand.
Dean sighed. “I’m not joking. I want you to be happy and I know you’ve wanted a kid for quite some time now. So, I want you to promise me this. And listen, it’ll be okay if you break your promise because I learned from an early age that promises do get broken. But for now,
After breakfast, Dean drove Asher back to his house. While in the car, Asher turned to Dean and said, “Hey, you wont tell anyone about the um…”
Disclaimer 2: The title is from the song, Chasing Cars and I am not making money by using it as the title of my fanfic.
“Dean,” Cas said softly. “You know when you’re in a car and your favorite song starts to play but then it turns out that you’re almost home but you want to listen to it over and over and you never want it to end?”
Chuck smiled slightly, “Don’t worry, Dean. He’ll be fine.” He turned and walked up the stairs leading up to his house.
John noticed Anna and Castiel sitting next to Dean. “Can I please have a talk with my son in private for a few minutes?”
Sam also had a pretty eventful summer. He had gotten a girlfriend but eventually had broken up with that girl. When Dean noticed how his brother had been moping around the house for a few days and asked him what had happened, Sam explained that he had broken up with Madison and when Dean asked why he had done that, Sam just shook his head and said, “She was way too into werewolves, Dean. It was kinda weird.”
“Want to know so you can screw another guy?” Dean was happy to see Castiel flinch at that. “Don’t worry, I’m just going for a walk.” Dean took off his ring and threw it at Cas. Then, he stormed out and made sure to slam the door as loudly as he could.
“I dunno, he doesn’t seem the type,” Dean replied with an equally strange look. Honestly, Cas seemed like the type of guy that wouldn’t do much of anything. From what Dean knew, he was quiet and mostly kept to himself.
"Shut up." Castiel said but didn't waste time by shoving Dean aside and walking into the house triumphantly.
Dean glared at Sam. “You know what Sam, shut the fuck up. You don’t have to try to convince me. I know the risks, okay, I’m not a fucking idiot. I just came here to tell you where we were going so you wouldn’t worry.” Then he shoved past Sam and went to the door.
When Naomi said nothing, Castiel added, "Please, it won't be for long. Please, mom." He gave her puppy-eyes.
Sam closed his notebook and pushed it to the side as he accepted the plate. “No reason.” But his reddened ears and neck told a different story.
And once Metatron dug up the key and Cas grabbed from him, they got to the sanctuary and called the Elders. And thank fuck, they put the handcuffs on Metatron because he definitely tried to put up a fight. And as the Elders put Metatron into a police car, the douchebag yelled, “We had a deal, you betrayed me” at Cas, who simply said, “Yes, well you betrayed all of us.”
Afterwards, when Sam was tucked away to sleep, Dean and John were sitting at the kitchen table silently. Dean wouldn't let himself look up at his dad.
As he lay there, he brought the phone up to his ear and swiped to answer. “Hello,” He said, before he yawned.
Dean was caught off guard about his dad speaking about his mom so calmly. Usually, Mary was a forbidden subject and whenever the conversation was necessary, it was always very cautious.
Dean nodded, “Yeah I don’t think we need to rush into things. We should definitely wait as we need to work on our communication.”
But he didn’t. He didn’t shout or yell or cry out. He didn’t shed a tear. He didn’t even move from the spot he was standing on. He was frozen to the spot, the one that was next to his brother.
“Someone will see,” Cas said and tried to push Dean off him. They were in the backseat of Cas’s car.
“Dean.” Castiel said, a light warning clearly audible in his tone. But Dean didn’t care, he needed to know why Castiel thought Meg was such a
Dean didn't regret punching Zack nor did he regret the detention. It was all worth it. Because a few days after the fight, Zack and his goons stayed out of his way and if they even tried to mess with Castiel, they knew that Dean wouldn't let them. And it turned out that Zack and his parents were moving away anyway.

"Gotta keep up the family tradition," Inias said and put his arm around Naomi's neck. If anybody noticed that his grip was a bit too tight, they didn't mention it.
“Mr. Winchester, so nice of you to join us,” Mr. Jefferson said and then passed the boy the attendance sheet.
A few seconds of silence passed before Dean burst out laughing. Cas wondered whether to take that offensively or not.
Dean peeked over the boy’s shoulder to see what he had been drawing. All he saw was a weird star with many different symbols and squiggly lines.
When they did get out, Dean slammed the car door and went up the porch stairs to open the front door. He didn’t wait for Castiel to walk in before shutting the door.
After making sure the door was locked (although what was he doing that for, he lived with a freaking vampire), he put his jacket on a hanger and was about to go to his room when he saw Cas sitting on the couch.
He was going to make the mac & cheese while he could still do anything. He knew that it was going to get him within months and soon he wouldn’t be able to do much of anything.
“Yeah, Sammy, believe it or not, your brother’s got game.” Dean said cockily. Nobody needed to know how awkward he had been with Jo while asking her out. “Besides, who else would I go with?”
Anyway, he hated the winter. But he didn’t mind it as much when he got to spend it with his friends, especially Cas.
“Aww, you like her.” Dean said teasingly, reaching to pinch Sam’s ear. Sam waved Dean away and piled some lasagna onto his plate.
They made themselves sandwiches and sat down at the table. They talked about what was new in school. Dean seemed to be very impressed with the new kid, Asher who, in Dean's words, "was a smarter genius than Matilda" and kept going on and on about him and when he was finished, Castiel took the opportunity to complain about his sister, Anna and how she managed to get him in trouble even when he hadn't done anything.
He let himself cry again while she held him. In that moment, he realized what had made Dean befriend her all those years ago. Underneath all the snark and the sarcasm, laid loyalty and a fierceness to protect.
Dean shook his head but smiled nonetheless, he had expected nothing less from Meg. “Right back at you.”
"I don't know." Castiel blurted out rather quickly and then said, "Why don't you ask her, if you're so curious."
When Castiel stood in front of his house, he rang the doorbell. He was surprised when no one opened it. He knew that his mother was home. He sighed as he dug through his bag, trying to find his key.
“I’ll be right there,” Dean said before he turned his phone off and started to pull on his clothes. He grabbed his keys and was about to leave when he heard a noise. He looked around and saw Cas standing in the hallway.
When they got to the party, it was pretty early so there weren’t many people there yet. Jo saw some of her friends from cheerleading so she went to greet them, leaving Dean behind.
After a few minutes, Castiel calmed down and wiped at the tears that had formed from the laughter. "I'm sorry, Dean. I just can't tell you yet."
It was also the happiest memory that both of them held on to after everything that occurred in the following years.
After listening to many names and almost falling asleep, he finally heard Dean being called up. He heard John, Sam and even Anna cheer loudly and joined them.
Mrs. Day was a great teacher. Despite history being a quite boring subject for many, she managed to make it quite interesting. Learning about ancient civilizations had never been interesting before he took Day’s class.
“You do know what that means?” Castiel asked cautiously shifting his gaze so he could make eye contact with Dean.
Castiel and Anna sat in silence for a few minutes before they heard a squeaking noise coming from the stairs. Castiel turned his head toward the noise source and was met with green eyes staring back at him.
What he did find, though was Sam at the end of the classroom, who had turned around in his chair to chat with his friends. And that surprised Dean quite a lot. That was because Dean was a senior and Sam was a freshman. Plus, this class was an honors section.
“I am assuming Inias was not too happy with either of you for running away.” Both Anna and Castiel nodded. “So I think it’s best for you to treat this as a regular day and after school, we will discuss options. Both of you should go and get dressed for school.”
Disclaimer 2: The title is from the song, Chasing Cars and I am not making money by using it as the title of my fanfic.
Right as he finished copying down the notes, the bell rang, and just as Dean expected, Charlie and Jo strolled into the classroom, both holding a cup of coffee and giggling. They made a beeline for their desks, and once they were seated, Mrs. Day began her lesson.
Though Dean couldn't see his brother, he was sure he was giving him his infamous bitch-face and rolling his eyes. "Shut up, Dean."
Since Dean had stopped in the middle of the street, Charlie almost walked into him and when she saw him making eye contact with the guy, she blurted out, “Ooh, I smell discomfort, drama and excitement all wrapped into one. Who is he?”
And then when one day Cas couldn’t bring himself to do anything and couldn’t move, Dean couldn’t stand it anymore so he took Cas and drove as quickly as he could back to Kansas, where he eventually brought him to a hospital.
Ash’s aunt, Ellen strolled into the Winchester house in a matching dress shirt and skirt. She had the same rollers in her hair the day she had picked up Ash. Dean wondered if it really took women that long to curl their hair.
As the days went by, Dean got worse. He got visitors all the time but he rarely wanted to see them. He was too tired and too fragile to want to see them. Cas could understand that but at the same time, he felt bad for their friends and for their family (especially for Sam) who wanted to see Dean.
Unfortunately, he wasn't sitting next to Dean, due to alphabetical order and was sandwiched between the two twins, Raphael and Michael. He tried not to think of what the name meant to him. It mostly worked for him. However, that didn't mean he could stop the arguing between the twins. The no-talking rule
Then he scurried off to his class and the last thing he heard was Charlie yelling after him, “Don’t you worry, your secret’s safe with me.” Then he heard Ash and Charlie burst out laughing.
Then when Sam looked up and saw what show Dean was watching, he said, “Ugh Dean, why do you watch this show?” And then to make matters worse, he went and grabbed Dean’s bowl of popcorn without even asking and started shoving as much popcorn as he could into his mouth.
“Yeah, I guess,” Sam said and even though his brother was miles away, Dean could hear the uncertainty in Sam’s voice.
The boy’s eyes widened. Dean couldn’t tell if he was surprised that Dean heard him, or that someone had responded to him.
As they walked with Mr.Shurley to his office, Cas wondered where Michael had gone. He figured that the scrawny boy had quickly crawled away from the scene when he saw Dean laying into Zack and reckoned that he didn’t stand a chance. The rat.
Dean had to bite his cheek to stifle a laugh. He knew that he should really get back to writing his essay if he wanted to get out of here early, but it was quite entertaining to watch the boy and his gym teacher argue.
Dean opened the bedroom door and then walked downstairs. He saw Castiel sleeping peacefully on the couch. His mouth was open and he looked like he was about to kiss the pillow. Dean laughed.
“I’m home.” Dean yelled as he entered his house, took off his coat and hung it up. As he kicked off his boots, he heard giggling. Besides the fact that his dad was working late, Dean was also sure that his father would never be caught giggling like that.
"Your parents sure do like those angel names. You guys can start a family band called, 'The Angels.' Too bad Anna isn't named after an angel."
The teacher’s nostrils flared. “Now listen, here you little-” Whatever he was about to say Dean would never know because at that moment, Mr. Jefferson’s cell began to ring and he snatched it out of his bag. Upon reading the caller id, he excused himself and told both boys to not go anywhere.
Speaking of his kids, Dean strolled into the kitchen in his pajamas, hair tousled and feet bare. As he went to get some milk out of the refrigerator, he did not even glance up from the floor to check his surroundings.
Time went by quickly in Lawrence, Kansas. Or maybe it just seemed that way to the Winchesters. Before they had a chance to blink, Sam started talking non-stop. He had a persuasive way of talking that got him out of all kinds of trouble. John joked that no one would want to argue with Sam if he ever became a lawyer.
All thoughts of happiness suddenly escaped his mind when someone ran into him and caused him to spill his coffee on his handwritten article.
It also turned out that they had some classes together. And as they was walking toward their calculus class, before he turned a corner, Dean saw a guy with the blackest hair and the bluest eyes and he thought his stomach had dropped to the floor. Because he knew. He knew who it was.
Once they had taken a seat inside the office, Mr.Shurley closed the door before sitting down himself.
Then he reached over to Dean and pushed him down onto the bed. All thoughts of meeting up with Meg soon diminished.
He took a peek into Sam's room to make sure that his son was sleeping and that he hadn't stayed up reading as he tended to do. He smiled as he saw his son was sleeping contentedly.
Most kids were upset when the holiday break ended. It meant that they had to go back to school, wake up at the ungodly hours of the days, and endure the oh-so nauseating work they were forced to do. Castiel, however was so excited to get back to school that he stood apart like a bright star among all the other students.
Dean didn't say anything. Instead he grabbed Castiel and pulled him into a hug. Castiel, not knowing how to react, hugged him back. He didn't need to question Dean, he was quite used to Dean's abrupt hugs.
They didn’t say anything for a while until Dean decided to break the silence. “So how was your first day of high school?”
And so their trip began. They travelled for a week. They went to the Grand Canyon and then to Niagara Falls and in between, they stopped at different places. And they talked to each other and learned more about themselves and each other. They found their way back to each other.
Eventually their relationship became serious and they moved in together. And two years later, they welcomed a kid into their life, who they named Dean.
"I don't know. He hasn't been home in a few days. He had a fight with mom and then left." Castiel rushed his words.
Within seconds, when he opened his eyes, he was standing in the war room of the bunker where Sam was sitting at a table with a thick ass book in front of him and notepads strewn all over the table.
Luckily, Bobby and Ellen didn’t seem to notice as they had decided to walk toward their front door, discussing how their day had gone.
While they were talking, Dean heard a girl’s voice ring in the background before she came closer to the phone and said, “Hey, Sam, you done talking to your brother? We’ve got an acceptance to celebrate.”
During the funeral, John didn't say anything but Dean could tell that his father was hurting inside. He knew that he couldn't do anything to make it better though. So he just held Sam tighter, kissed his forehead and promised that he would always be there for him, no matter what happened.
A knock at the door woke John out of his dream. He rubbed his eyes and glanced at the clock. It read 10:45 PM. He sighed as he got up from his bed. As he walked down the hallway, he wondered who it was that came knocking so late in the evening.
?” Dean rolled his eyes. He knew his behavior was childish but he didn’t care. God, he was so tired. He was just so tired of everything.
As he walked up the stage, he knew that it was not supposed to hurt but somehow it still did. Having at least one parent (albeit a half-drunk one) is better than no parent at his graduation.
“This is Castiel’s doctor. We received the results from his MRI.” MRI? Dean didn’t even know that Castiel was getting an MRI.
Ignoring, the warmth spreading to her cheeks following that wink, Jo walked through the school’s front doors. She had more important things to worry about, one of which was her AP Chemistry exam and she couldn’t let anything distract her before the exam.
Dean shook his head and laughed. The kid’s eyes widened; apparently he hadn’t realized that Dean was messing around.
Though Castiel felt like it was the longest drive he had experienced, the ambulance arrived at the hospital within minutes. The paramedics worked quickly, getting Naomi into the emergency room and receiving medical attention immediately. All the while, Castiel stood like a bystander who was frozen in time and unable to move.
They sat in silence for a few minutes as Dean continued to write his essay and Sam kept drawing. When Dean couldn’t take the quiet anymore, he asked,
The rest of the evening passed in peace. They worked on their project. They outlined how they were going to split it up and by when they would have it complete.
Sam sighed, looked quite annoyed and Dean thought he wouldn’t answer but then the younger boy surprised him. “Well after my mother died, he was driven by so much grief that he sort of got the idea that something supernatural had caused her death.”
“You’ll probably need surgery,” Dean said. “They are going to run some tests and then take you in to surgery.”
Sitting between Dean and Anna calmed Castiel for a while, right up until they heard the sirens outside of the house.
Alfie laughed. “Whatever works.” He looked up and seemed to notice something because the next minute, he jumped off the bench and said, “Gotta go, there’s Mel.”
Dean sighed. “It’ll be alright, we can write letters and emails and I’m pretty sure I can get my dad to cave and get me a cell-might be one of those old ones but still.”

John gave a smile small to his youngest son. “I’m alright, I can’t imagine what Bobby’s going through, probably the same thing I went through when I lost your mom, maybe even worse.” John shook his head and blinked, trying to keep his tears at bay. John added, “Karen was a strong one but the Alzheimer’s was stronger.”
Disclaimer 2: The title is from the song, Chasing Cars and I am not making money by using it as the title of my fanfic.
Later after they’ve talked about the treatment plan, which Dean and his doctor agreed to start after graduation, Dean again asked Sam not to tell Cas.
"Your parents love you very much and they wouldn't want to leave you," Castiel said and then added, "And you'll be a great brother, Dean."
After Dean took a shower, he went to make breakfast. As he was finishing making the scrambled eggs, Asher wandered in and sat down at the kitchen table.
“Well I'll tell where he is,” Cas said sharply. “He's six feet under.” Then he hung up and threw his cell phone at the wall. He glared at one of the picture frames of Dean hanging on the wall and yelled, “You had no
Ruby’s coy smile faltered. She sighed and placed an arm on Dean’s shoulder placating. “Dean, relax, I was just joking,” She said. “Your kid brother’s adorable,” She added on, smiling. “But as you said, he’s four years younger than me and that would unacceptable, not to mention gross,” She pulled a face. “I do have standards, you know.”
And before she left, Dean uttered, “Cruella,” to which she responded, “Wilma.” Then she smiled and before he knew it, she was gone.
“Sit wherever you want, just be careful with Teddy’s toys,” Anna called from the kitchen. “I don’t really care and Dave’s at work right now but if the little munchkin sees a mess when she gets home from school, she’ll go nuts.”
He didn't care though what sudden irrational thing had made him be brave because he was kissing Castiel. It didn't matter that it only lasted seconds because he was finally kissing Castiel.
When he rung the doorbell, he expected Castiel or Anna to answer. However, as the door opened, he was met with Naomi's equally shocked face.
“My dad gave it to me.” Sam said, then paused and after a few seconds added, “Wait did you just call me Sammy?”
“Fuck off,” Cas said before he jumped off the ledge and added on, “You have no right to ask me about my life. If you’ve forgotten, you’re the one who told me to leave.”
"'orry, guys." John swallowed and then took a sip of his drink. He glanced over to his son and noticed that Dean still had a frown on his face. He exchanged a concerned look with his wife.
"Oh, kid had some trouble at home. He had to leave and was homeschooled before coming back this year." Dean explained.
“Dean, I realize that you’re probably the only fifteen-year old boy with a mechanic for a dad who still hasn’t taught him to drive-” John looked up to make sure Dean was listening and when Dean gave a small nod, John added, “So if you want to.. maybe I could teach you how to drive this weekend?” John ended in a hopeful tone.
Cas walked up to Dean and grabbed his chin so that he was looking directly in his eyes. "Dean, you have to listen to me," Cas said firmly. “I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to drive.”
“Sam, you have to relax,” Dean said told his brother, who had been pacing back and forth down the hospital’s corridor.
Castiel rubbed his eyes and padded across the living room to the kitchen. He was still wearing pajamas and he bit back a yawn when he saw a frown on his mother’s face.
"Yes, after Mary's mother, Deanna. She had a heart attack... it was a tragic accident." John's eyes turned soft.
But now that he saw Cas actually drinking blood, he couldn’t think of anything to say except for “Um.” Way to be
“But-” Castiel hesitated. “- at the same time, I still can’t forget about him being my father.” A few tears welled up in his eyes but he managed to blink them back, hoping Dean hadn’t seen.
Jason, who had originally planted the idea in Cas's head and who now also had to deal with the sickeningly sweet couple.
Meanwhile, Dean glanced back at Castiel and Meg. She was whispering something into his ear and smiling and within seconds, Castiel was smiling as well. That didn't make Dean angry.
Mary Winchester shook her hand and said, "Sure, we're always looking to make new friends. Where's little Annie?"
“You have to go to that party.” Asher said that as if it was a necessity and if Dean wouldn’t go, then the only plausible explanation would be that Dean was preparing for the Apocalypse. And knowing Asher’s plans and all of their crazy adventures (which didn't always end so well), sometimes Dean wished he was preparing for the Apocalypse instead.
He smiled at the waitress, Lisa. He remembered that not so long ago he had considered having a fling with her but then Castiel had come along. Castiel, with his bright blue eyes, a kind heart and the ability to always make Dean laugh and Dean forgot all about her.
Dean put his arms around Cas’s waist, pulling him in for the first time in weeks. He threaded his fingers through Cas’s dark locks, hoping against hope that everything would be okay.
"Okay, Cas, I know I shouldn't tell you this, but you have to stay calm. The police will be there soon, okay."
Sam and Jess came over with the twins and he smiled at the kids but he felt like he was putting on a show for them. Sam also called in to check in on him daily but Cas barely responded, just giving one-word answers.
When Dean was out of earshot, John turned to Castiel and said, "Cas, I've known you for a while. You know that you can tell me anything, right?"
" belted through the speakers and Dean was about to turn the knob to the next station when Castiel whispered-yelled, "No, leave it." Castiel looked at him pleadingly.
He wished he hadn't done that. The room was a mess. Clothes littered the floor. There was no space in between them. On one side of the room, the clothes were shredded whereas the clothes on the other side lay in anticipation of their doom. Anna stood in the middle of the room; her own dress ripped on the side.
Dean had been taking out his Science textbook and was about to leave but when he shut his locker door, he came face to face with a very concerned-looking Castiel.
The three of them clinked their cups and then drank from them. Following that, they sat in a silence.
“Thanks,” Dean said. “But he’s not going away for a long time and anyway, that’s not what I wanted to tell you.”
“Okay,” John said and then sighed. He ran his fingers through his hair. “Dean, I need you to know that I’ll need some time to get used to this.”
Before they knew it, winter had faded and spring had taken over. Its bright colors brought warmth and joy to many people, including the Winchesters.
"Okay, Okay, I'm sorry, I'll stop." Dean wiped at the tears that had formed and got up after a few minutes.
It was odd. They had never been close friends like he had been with Jo, or with Ash or Alfie but in a strange way, he’d miss her.
Dean smiled. He knew Meg was never going to talk feelings and he was okay with that. Honestly, it was Meg’s life and if she wanted to share her story and talk about it, he would listen. But if she didn’t, he wouldn’t push her. They weren’t really friends but they weren’t really enemies anymore either. He sat down across from Meg and took out his history textbook. At the loud thunk the textbook made, Meg rolled her eyes but Dean knew what that meant.
Another month had passed and Thanksgiving was right around the corner. Cas and Dean couldn’t wait for the holiday to come so that they could sleep in and blow off homework until the last second.
"Welcome back." John greeted him as he came through the door. Sam ran to hug him and Castiel couldn't help but smile.
“Nah, don’t think so. What am I going to do? Dress up as a turkey?” Asher said and then yanked the worksheet farther away from Alfie and said, “And stop copying my answers, you wanker.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “Yes, Dean I think she does remember as you have reminded everyone in school about us more than a couple hundred times. Anyway, she’s texted to say that’s she moving.”
“Don’t worry about it,” John answered his son. “I’ll be fine. Now go home and get some rest. I’ll see you tomorrow.” He motioned to Sam to come in for a hug as he himself couldn’t quite get up and then motioned to Dean to join them.
"Taking a bath." She said. Noticing the sour look Dean was sporting, she softened her eyes and added, "Why? What's wrong?"
Cas untwined their fingers. “My father would probably say something worse if he knew,” He said before averting his gaze.
. Dean hadn’t prepared himself for this. See, a few days back, Dean had his second lab class. He had come in to it earlier to set up the equipment and prepare himself for his interactions with Cas. As this lab only met once per week, he hadn’t see the guy since the first lab meeting. And he thought everything would go fine. Which, surprisingly it did.
Then Cas grabbed his face with both his hands, gently petting his face as he said, “Dean Winchester, that is complete bullshit. You are smart and you will do great on this test.” Then he pushed Dean against the building and kissed him, roughly and deep, not letting the taste of nicotine bother him. He hoped he was getting his message across.
Apparently he was successful because Dean now had a grin on his face and as he rested his forehead against Dean’s, Dean said, “okay, let’s go take that test, babe.”
Cas sat there for a several minutes as he mulled it over when he finally answered Dean and said, “Sounds like a plan.”
Jo gave him a strange look, a look that most people gave others when they were out of the loop but expected them to know everything anyway. “Didn’t you hear?”
As Ellen opened the door, Dean glanced back at the Winchester house. He watched John and his sons walk through their own front door and he again felt a sense of déjà vu. Dean couldn’t place it, but Sam and Adam’s father looked so familiar that it was eerie.
“You know, maybe you should be in there with your wife, rather than out in the corridor, here with us,” Dean said. “I mean, it’s
Apparently Dean had overstepped boundaries. Yet again. “Sorry,” He apologized as he turned back to his seat.
“They told me they found a tumor.” Castiel said as he dug out the remaining mac and cheese from the fridge and placed it into the microwave.
Then he looked into the audience and when he located Cas, Bobby and Sam, he smiled and waved at them.

A few days later he called Sam to check in. His brother had started high school and so Dean wanted to see how things were going for his brother. He hated not being there but he knew this was for the best. As Bobby and Sam had said, he deserved a real college experience. And Sam would be fine without Dean there. He would definitely be fine. Dean was hoping if he kept trying to convince himself that, he would believe that.
"No, I don't think so. Let's just shake hands." Castiel got out of his bed and sat next to Dean. They shook hands and then Castiel leaned in to kiss Dean's cheek. Dean wiped at his cheek and said, "Eww, Cas!" Castiel giggled in response.
Dean looked up from his phone and saw that it was the head cheerleader, Meg Masters. She smiled slyly at him and said, “I know you, don’t I?”
God, that dork was adorable. Dean thought but then shook his head clear of these thoughts. He and Cas needed to have a serious conversation.
“You met me at a restaurant five years ago. We’re married, don’t you remember?” For the first time, Dean cursed at himself for taking that goddamn ring off.
Although Castiel had heard worse words before, he still flinched. He did not have time to answer back though because at the same time, they heard Inias shout, “It doesn’t matter how long you hide in there. I'm going to find you and when I do, you're both going to be dead.”
The words tumbled out of his mouth, perfectly, as if he’s said them a million times before. But he hasn’t though. Dean’s never said those words to Jaime’s twin brother before.
Castiel highly doubted that only men were capable of making funeral arrangements but he remained quietly at his father's side, nonetheless.
Ruby giggled. Jo look mildly offended but snickered as well. Dean and Cas unanimously said, “Shut up, Ash,” and then smiled at each other.
"Guys, if you’re trying to look even more idiotic, it won’t work, trust me.” Victor says teasingly. He followed their line of sight and said, “Oh, that’s the Milton kid, the one who went away with his sister a few years back, right?”

?” Dean questioned, “You can’t just decide, you guys are still kids, you can’t leave your house.” He couldn't imagine where he would go if he decided to leave his house. For one thing, Dean was certain that John would kill him or Sam if they ever decided to run away. He remembered how angry his father had been when he had run away to the Miltons a few years ago. Dean couldn't believe that he now considered those to be happier times. He pushed that thought away.
She smiled again, “Yep, that’s me. And you’re Dean, the hero who beat up Zack for annoying that weirdo rebel.”
"Your dad is probably feeling it worse. He did know your mom from a very young age." Castiel pointed out.
Dean unclenched the fist he hadn’t realized he had been clenching. No matter how many years had passed, he wanted to find that piece of shit and give him a piece of his mind. Then he breathed out.
Dean thought that once upon a time that could have been him and Cas but he shut that thought off quickly. He didn’t want to think about what could’ve been.
Once they reached Dean's house, Dean said good-bye and then raced up the stairs to open the door. He waved through the window to Castiel and then disappeared, probably off to his room.
“Bitch.” Dean retorted, grinning. He was about to go upstairs, he really wasn't joking before, he did have a lot homework when Sam called his name.
“Hey, you going to that party Friday night?” The boy with the long blonde hair said as he slid into the seat next to his friend.
“Uh, Jaime Milton, ring a bell, Dean? The girl you’ve been obsessing over since kindergarten?” Jo quipped, staring at him like he was an idiot.
“Nothing’s wrong, I just wish -” Cas scratched at the back of his head, “I just hope they’ll be alright. I mean I know I don’t really know Meg’s mom or Luke that well but I think everyone deserves a chance at happiness.”
Bobby walked up to them. “I agree,” he said, “That’s bullshit what’s John’s spouting. It’s like he expects his sons to be soldiers or something.”
"John, that's gross. Can you please not talk while eating?" Mary asked but gave a small smile indicating that she wasn't as disgusted as she was concerned.
Once Dean saw that Zack could no longer hurt Cas, he held out his hand and helped pull him to his feet.
Castiel wasted no waste time as he pushed Dean back against the door and took Dean’s mouth into his. Dean tangled his hands into Castiel’s hair and pulled him close at the same time as he picked up his legs to wrap them around Castiel’s waist.
“You know-” Dean began and Castiel had looked up so quickly that made it seem like he hadn’t even known that Dean was in the room to begin with. But Dean knew his best friend better than.
Twenty minutes later, both of the Milton children were packed and ready to leave their house. Once they were downstairs, Inias turned and looked at them questioningly.
Later that night, when Cas got home, he reused to sleep in his bed and slept on the couch. He would need to get a new bed.
Later, after the Elders made sure that Cas and all the other witches were going to get their essence back and Metatron would be put on trial for his sentence, Cas pulled Dean into his arms and said, “let’s go home.” Dean smiled at that and said, “Okay.”
And when Cas entered the apartment, Dean stood up, crossed his arms and said, “Where have you been?” And really, the way he said that he could have given Molly Weasley a run for her money.
The rest of the evening went by smoothly. No other beverages were spilled and Dean had shared a meal with Castiel.  They got along so well that Dean hadn’t noticed that time had gone by.
"I know. But you can't just drop everything, Cas. We're supposed to graduate in a month and if you don't get back on track, you're going to have to go to summer school. And
Also, Sam’s friend, Gabe and Dean’s old swim team captain, Victor came to see him. When he arrived with Michael, Dean was surprised. Not because he was surprised that Victor was with a man but because he truly didn’t think that they would last. He remembered that Victor had been quite a player back when he was in high school and he and Mike had had an on-off-on again thing for quite some time. He guessed they had finally grown up and managed to work their shit out.
“I heard you,” Dean interjected. “The first time.” Then he snorted. Clearly, his dad didn't understand.
After the most awkward dinner of all time was over, they said goodbye and promised to call each other. And then Dean went home.
Dean smirked at him, “Yeah a night of heavy drinking will do that for you.” He placed the plates on the table and then sat down with Asher to eat.
Dean had just gotten home from another doctor’s appointment and for the past half hour, he had been sitting on the couch, not saying a thing.
"NO!" At the pointed look Dean gave him, Castiel looked down at the table and whispered, "Yeah." His voice cracked a bit at that but he tried not to show how upset he really was.
didn't apply to them. He could've sworn that he saw his friend, Alfred, who was sitting on the other side of Michael mouth, 'help me.'
Dean hated the winter. He hated the cold and he hated how he had to wear layers upon layers upon layers. Two layers were fine with him but more than that and he couldn’t stand it. He hated having chapped lips and he hated the catch-22 situation that occurred when he had to choose between wearing gloves and being able to use his phone outside. He hated winter and it was ironic seeing as he was born during it, compared to Sam, who was born in the spring and who unlike Dean, actually loved winter.
The only thing that brought his attention back was when Mrs.Robinson called on him to answer the question.
"Hey Cas, this is Ash." Dean's eyes sparkled brightly. Castiel squinted his eyes in deep concentration as he racked his brain thinking up why the name sounded so familiar.
weird.” Anna had punched the girl (well bitch in her words) and Dean couldn’t have agreed more with her action.
An affair with Lisa sounded like a great idea now. He could give Cas a taste of his own medicine. But deep down, Dean knew he was above that.
John sighed as he sat at the kitchen table. “There’s no easy way to say it so I guess I’ll spit it out. Your uncle bobby, he got bad news today, Karen passed away while he was at work.”
“I get it, you didn’t want to, it’s fine.” Dean looked down and rubbed his thumb along the side of his coffee cup.
Later, when they stepped outside to say goodbye, Meg said  "See you around, Clarence" after she hugged Cas goodbye. Regarding this, Dean questioningly mouthed “Clarence” to Cas, to which Cas responded with “I’ll explain later.”
On top of that, he hadn't seen Dean either. Sure, they hung out at school during lunch. But that was it. They didn't hung out after school or on weekends as often as they had. He wondered if Dean was avoiding him because of his mother or because of
Cas sighed. “I’m not sure yet. I was thinking of deferring like I told you but Anna might kill me if I don’t go to college right away. Plus, I don’t really know what I would do if I didn’t go to college right away. How about you? Going to KU in the fall?”
Almost like she was reading his mind, Jo honked the car horn out front. “Guess that’s my cue to go,” Dean mumbled, mostly to himself.
A few papers almost fell out of the folder. Dean was sure that Asher used the folder for all of his subjects and he sometimes wondered how his friend managed to stay so on top of his classes.
One day, Dean seemed fine and his mind was as clear as ever. He sat up and took Cas’s hand into his.
After excusing himself from the conversation with Meg, he went to the bathroom and splashed some water on his face.
After taking many pictures and having some lunch, Naomi left with Dean and Castiel. John promised that they would come back that night. Dean didn't want to leave but he knew he had to. He knew that his parents would eventually come home and he couldn't wait until then because it meant that Sam would be coming home with them.
"It wasn't Dean!" Castiel shouted and looked back at a bewildered John. When he realized that he had raised his voice, he ashamedly shifted his gaze back to the window.
Towards the end of his messages, he revealed that he checked up on Dean by calling Sam during the year he and Dean weren’t talking, that he didn’t want to be a burden and that he still loved Dean.
“I said, ‘chemistry’s such a bitch.’” Jo rolled her eyes- “Honestly, Winchester, where is your attent- ” Jo didn’t get to finish because Dean interrupted her and said, “No, I mean why is Cas going to be there?”
“So today, I was hanging out with her and I asked her if she would want to go on a date and she said yes!” Sam looked like he was ready to burst any second.
"All right, I'm listening. What did the genius manage to find out this holiday break?" Dean asked leaning against his locker.
With the help of their friends, Dean had tried cheering up Castiel but to no avail. Neither boy could ignore the rumors, the whispers, and the curious looks that Castiel often received in the school hallways.
Once he was finished drinking the water, he wiped his mouth with the sleeve of his shirt and laughed. Then he coughed. His throat was still a bit sore from throwing up so he drank some more water.
“Do you really think dad would notice? He’s drunk most of the time.” Cas said as he folded up his sweatpants. “And don’t call me, Cassie.”
Cas stood there in sweatpants and hoodie. “Hey,” He said and opened the door inviting Dean to come inside. He went over to the mini fridge, pulling out a water and said, “You want anything?”
Anna tried to talk about the topic more but Castiel made it clear that he didn't want to talk anymore. So they cleaned up their parents' bedroom and after twenty minutes of rummaging through her mother's closet, Anna found her mother's black dress and jacket. She found the matching shoes at the bottom.
“And another car hit him!” Dean could hear blubbering across the phone. But Sam kept talking through his sniffles. “The hospital called me like fifteen minutes ago and I didn’t know what to do so I said I’d call you and call them back.”
"How? He just keeps singing about chasing cars. Between me and you, he sounds a bit crazy." Dean snorted.
Castiel was sure that he had gained at least ten pounds today. He didn’t remember eating so much ice cream and pizza in one day ever.
Dean followed them inside, trying to piece together why this day just kept getting weirder and weirder.
Right when he looked up at the mirror, he felt like there was someone standing behind him and for some unknown reason he had the need to say,
“He’s at Bobby. He shouldn’t –” John hesitated and there was a long pause before he continued. “He shouldn’t hear this. He’s too small.”
“C’mon, Cas, he’s obviously lying.” Sam said. “I love my brother but sometimes he can be such a stupid martyr. You have to know that this whole ‘I don’t need you here’ is just a bunch of bullshit to get you to leave so he doesn’t feel guilty about keeping you here.”
Castiel laughed again and Dean cherished the sound. Growing up with Castiel, Dean didn’t always get to hear the sound of Castiel’s laugh. But from now on, he promised himself that he would always make sure to make Castiel laugh so he could hear that sound.
The last thing Dean heard before he shut the door was, “And remember you can always come to me if you want to talk.”
Then he began to cry. As sobs wracked his body, he thought he would never again be the same. Losing Dean (
John went to sit down on Dean’s bed but before he could, he had to mov Dean's pile of clothes to the side. And good thing, he had noticed the open bag of chips before sitting down. After this mess, he was going to have to talk with his boys about cleaning after their messes.
Cas gave him a confused look. “Weren’t you listening? We’re paired up for the next semester as lab partners.”
"Sure, Mr. Winchester, I'll go first." Castiel jumped off the couch, grabbed his bag and went upstairs to take a shower.
The Winchesters and the Miltons were neighbors so whenever Naomi had some free time, she came over with Castiel.
“I see you’re making mac and cheese. You normally make mac and cheese before telling bad news. You’ve got something to tell me, don’t you?”  Dean gave Cas an accusing look. “Maybe you’re having an affair,
Dean shook his head and said, "No, daddy, you could never fail me. And you've been a great dad to Sam."
Dean then put a hand around Sam’s shoulder, pulling his little brother in for a hug and as he ruffled Sam’s hair, he gave him a wide smile, “Don’t you worry Sammy, there’s going to be plenty of fishes out there.”
They settled on going to Castiel’s house and as they talked and walked, Dean grabbed Castiel’s hand and intertwined their fingers.
Then Cas got up from the floor, grabbed a pack of smokes and opened the window. He lit a cigarette as he stared out the window.
Before they had a chance to even blink, winter turned into spring, which of course in turn brought on the anxiety and stress of upcoming final exams. And though Dean and Cas tried to hang out and go on dates as much as they could do, things kept coming up.
Dean blushed slightly. He hated being the only one of his friends who had such an over-protective parent.
He didn’t want to talk to anyone, let alone Castiel. He wanted to just go back to sleep and to just forget about what a mess his life had become.
Apparently, Alfie had heard them.  Sparing them a murderous glare, he said, “Oh shut up” and then ran off to greet his girlfriend.
Dean wondered what kind of magical powers this person contained that they managed to convince his father that it was possible to take down Inias Milton.
From his peripheral vision, Dean could see Cas smiling and so he smiled too and neither said a word after that; they just walked along in comfortable silence.
Dean shifted his gaze around nervously. Then he dug in his pocket and took out the bracelet that he had made. He shoved it onto Castiel’s arm.
One day when Mary Winchester was out on a walk with her baby, she had an epiphany as she kept catching Dean smile whenever he stared up at the clear sky.
John arrived shortly after the policemen had arrested Inias for disturbing the peace. Thankfully, the group of people who were previously hanging around his house had cleared up and he could safely walk into his house.
As they were about to walk in, the doctor cleared his throat again. They turned to him. “I should warn you though, it may be upsetting to see your father in this state.”
suicidal idiot." Anna took a swig out of her flask. Castiel hadn't even noticed it was in her hand beforehand.
And Dean really shouldn’t be surprised that Victor knows this even though Victor didn’t even go to the same school as them. But then again, they live in a small town that gossip would eventually reach him.
For the next thirty minutes, he watched his two best friends argue over how they had gotten together, neither one of them agreeing on the details and laughed along with them as they tried to come up with a coherent story.
“Wasn’t going to say that,” Dean replied, although he had had an inkling to say something exactly like that.
“Pretty sure, I mean I could be wrong but she probably likes you too, you should find out on Monday. I think I know a thing or two about the ladies.”
“Alright, I’ll go wake him up. You guys finish your breakfast.” It seemed that at the word, “guys,” Dean finally woke up and realized he was not the only one at the kitchen table.
The real misfortune of his life, though was that he was forced to sit next to Dean Winchester. See, any person with eyes and ears could tell that Winchester was someone you wanted to sit next to. According to the school rumors, Winchester was pretty smart (Cas still had some doubts about that) and combined with his looks (he had deep green eyes and a smooth complexion (with only a few freckles, five per each side of his nose,
The first message started out fine. Nothing unusual about it. Just Cas checking in and asking what was up.
“I guess it just really scared me to admit that,” Dean said. Then he smiled sheepishly. “Probably should’ve picked a better time to tell you.”
Suddenly he was pulled in for a hug.  Within seconds, he was hugging back. Then, Castiel was pulling back.
"Castiel, the Winchesters called. They said that they can't find-" Naomi trailed off when she entered the living room, "- Dean. Your parents are very worried, young man!" She said sternly, narrowing her eyes.
He had noticed that whenever Sam was near, John smiled a lot more often than he did around Dean. Naturally, as a curious child, Dean wanted to know why his father tried to avoid him whenever it was possible. So one day when John was watching T.V. and Sam was sleeping in his room, Dean decided to confront his dad.
He glanced at the clock hanging above the wall. It was twelve in the morning and so he wondered who could be calling him so late.
“Dean, this is Gabe. Gabe, this is Dean, my annoying older brother.” Sam said and went back to writing.
Asher didn’t say anything back and Dean would never know if it was because he had actually managed to shut up his friend for a few seconds (a previously impossible task) or if it was because at that moment, the door opened and their math teacher, Mrs.Robinson walked in and a student trudged after her.
Dean walked hesitantly toward John and when he stood right next to his dad, the baby's eyes flew open and his little fingers flailed, as if searching for something, or rather someone. Dean linked his fingers with Sam's and said, "He's so small."
. No, Dean started annoying Cas by doing little things like stealing and hiding Cas’s pens under his chair or kicking his leg chair while no one was looking. And Cas was pretty sure, there had been no alternative motive (well any alternative motive Cas could come up with, maybe Dean was a secret agent and his mission was to annoy Cas). Hey, he had a big imagination, okay!
“You bet it was,” Castiel said and Dean could see the beginnings of a smile forming. Dean knew that he wasn’t forgiven. Not yet but it was a good start.
Cas and Dean sat apart quickly and pretended to be engrossed in their books. But it was pointless. Their faces were flushed, their hair was crumpled and the notebook Cas was holding up was upside down.
Naomi looked between them and said, "Oh alright." She called Mary and John and asked them if it was alright that their son would stay over for supper. They agreed as long as he would be back within a few hours. After hanging up the phone, Naomi went to the kitchen to prepare supper.
The next day, they ate breakfast together as a family and then went to the park. They spent the whole day there. Dean noticed that his father was trying to smile a lot more often and actually participate.
“Yes, I’d like to know why I’m going to be harboring a fugitive teenager,” Anna added on after she came into the living room.
Asher said bye to Jo and then turned back to his conversation with Dean. When Jo looked up, Charlie winked at her before joining the conversation as well.
“It was good. Gabe and I are in some of the same classes and I met this girl, Amelia. She’s pretty cool.” Sam babbled on and on about high school and his teachers and all of his classes and Dean couldn’t help but smile. His little brother was growing up.
The others woke up a bit later. When they were done getting ready, they all went downstairs to eat breakfast. All but one.
The way Sam had turned caused his necklace to pop out over the top of his collar and the strange brass charm dangling from it caught Dean’s eye. Dean had just opened his mouth to ask him about it when Mr. Jefferson came back through the door.
As his brother surfed the channels, Dean thought about his dad finding about him and Cas. He knew that he should talk to Cas about being more careful because he could never be sure what his dad's reaction would be to his son dating another guy.
Later, as he was working on his essay, a skinny young boy, whom Dean reckoned was a freshman wandered in. Dean couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something familiar about him.
The bell rang at that moment and Dean rushed off to his next class, not noticing the hurt look that flashed across Castiel's face.
A few days after Sam turned six months old, a fire broke out. John handed Sam to Dean and told him to run outside and to never look back. Dean tried to protest, wanted to go back and save his mom but John hushed him and went back into the house by himself.
“Yeah,” He said, his voice cracking. “It was just weird. I didn’t know that he was at KU. Thought maybe he was still doing his gap year or something.”
Disclaimer 2: The title is from the song, Chasing Cars and I am not making money by using it as the title of my fanfic.
“I’m not going to leave you Sammy,” Dean said when he had calmed and saw that his brother was still crying.
"Yes, our tough little Dean can't wait to get out." A tall man with the most dazzling brown eyes appeared and wrapped his arms around Mary's waist.
“Nice to meet you, Gabriel.” Dean said and the kid’s face fell but he seemed to recover within seconds when he said, “Back at you, Deanna.”
But Alfie and Ash were here and he told himself he wouldn’t get upset in front of them. So, he pushed the bag aside, pointed to the linked hands and said, “So spill. How did that happen?”
Ellen just laughed and ruffled Dean’s hair. “You’re a sweet kid. Now excuse me, I have to go take a shower.”
Dean glared again at his brother and then glanced at Cas. “Can we talk in private?” He darted his eyes at Sam, who got the hint and walked out of the hospital room.
Dean wasn’t sure about Sam but he was definitely excited when their dad texted them to say that he was coming home because that meant that they could finally order the pizza they had been patiently awaiting.
Dean couldn’t even think about it, forget saying it aloud. He knew what the doctor had told him but he didn’t think he would ever be able to wrap his head around it.
Jo scoffed, “Eugh, mom, we’re glad that you and Bobby got married and all, but that’s just too much info. Dean agrees with me, right Dean?”
As he pulled off his sweaty shirt and the pants and quickly changed into a new set of pajamas, he thought about what he was going to do. This was the third night in a row that he had woken up in a cold sweat.
“Fuck no,” Sam said as he got up and the legs of the chair he was sitting on scraped against the floor, making an awful squeaking sound.
"Uncle Bobby and his wife Karen!" His eyes widened and he gave a hearty laugh that made Dean smile in return.
The ambulance arrived shortly. The paramedics placed Naomi on a stretcher and Castiel held her hand the whole time. Castiel did not stop talking the whole way to the hospital.
"You just had to have your stupid macaroni and cheese, didn't you? Couldn't deal with what she made? Well guess what, now she's dead and no one's here to make you your favorite food." John kept shouting.
When everyone had gone out and Cas looked back and saw that Dean still hadn’t left, he smiled and went over to Dean.
“What’s the matter with you, Sammy? Never steal another man’s popcorn.” Dean said and reached for his bowl back but to no avail. Sam had a pretty tight grip on the bowl and wasn’t letting go.
Jason held up his hands (though there was no reason to do so as Cas couldn’t see him). “Hey, I’m just saying. You never know what goes on in that pretty boy’s head.” Then he went back to reading his book and left Cas to his thoughts.
Dean ended up falling asleep before the movie was halfway done. Cas scooped him up into his arms and carried him to their bedroom and if Dean scooted a bit closer and tightened his grip, Cas didn’t mention it.
"I-" Dean didn't have time to say anything because his father interrupted him again and yelled, "It's your fault! Your goddamn fault."
“Well that’s me.” He said and he put on his coat. Just as he was opening the door, his father called out his name.
"Hey dork. What do you want?" She had an annoyed expression on her face. She never had been nice to him. Dean wondered if all girls were like that or if that was yet another phase Anna was going through.
Cas barked a laugh. He hated his old man and he hoped the guy got everything he had deserved.  “Just for that, you can stay as long as you want.”
Sam didn't really understand what was happening but he hugged Castiel anyway, right after Dean had. It made Castiel feel better, even if it was only for a small period of time.
The whole event went by quickly; Inias made a few speeches (seeing as the priest refused to come due to religious beliefs), prayers were said and nothing out of the ordinary occurred.
“Father? You’re still calling that scumbag asshole a father?” Anna said as she crossed her arms. “He is nothing but a fucking loser.”
Dean waited to make sure Meg was out of earshot and when he saw her sitting down at a table with some group of girls on the farthest end of the library, he blurted out, “Are you really going to go to the party?”
“Are you implying that I am interested in Castiel Milton, socially awkward twin brother of Jaime’s? Because if so, that is so
Dean sauntered over and sat on Castiel’s bed. As he sat, he wondered where to begin, He didn’t even know what to say.
“I know, I know, it’s really hard for you to imagine that she’s a normal person and that me and her got along well.”
Like one time during eight grade, while Cas was working on an essay, Dean tore it out of his hands and started running around the classroom (during the break, of course,
"You guys were put in different classes? But you can still see each other during recess, can't you?" John asked, hoping to lighten the mood.
“Dean, I-” Cas swallowed past the lump in his throat and tried to blink away his tears. “I don’t want to do it without you.”
Dean shook his head at his weird thoughts as he got up from the chair, walked inside his house and then slammed the door closed.
As Ash walked to the car, he yelled, "Nice to meet you, Cas." He waved at them as he got into the car. They drove off before Castiel could respond.
As Dean turned right, he glanced at Castiel out of the corner of his eye and gave him a small smile, to which Castiel responded with his own smile.
Cas had a smile on for the remainder of the test even if most of the students and the proctor were confused by his happiness.
“What?” Cas said gently. He took a seat next to Dean and intertwined their fingers. “What did he say?”
Dean decided to go to the party that Jo had told him about after all. It had been quite an eventful week and he thought it would help loosen him up.
Bobby opened his beer and then scratched his beard before taking a sip. “Dean, a buddy of mine, Rufus- he uh- he said that got a place for you two boys.”
"Mom, I'm home." Castiel called from the hallway as he hung his coat and took off his shoes. He placed everything neatly inside the closet and stepped out into the living room.
Dean saw the door being open and straightened his posture. Even if this was an alternate reality, he didn’t want to make a bad impression on Cas’s family, as he really needed to talk to him. And what good would it do if Cas’s parents took one look at his crazed expression and shut the door in his face? He would never get out of here.
Sure Jaime might have been mad at him, which probably would’ve resulted in her pulling a prank but he could have lived with that. Better than dealing with the jerks at this school.
Dean sat down. He looked around the room. There was nothing special about it really. White curtains, white walls, and a white floor. The only thing that stood out was a small flower in a pot sitting on the windowsill. Dean looked away from it.
want?” Dean tried to comfortingly place a hand on her shoulder but she pushed him away and said, “Don’t touch me.”
“You’re in luck, friend, I did finish my homework and you can take a look at it but only if -”Asher took the folder out of Dean’s reach and said, “- you agree to go to that party.”
“At us,” Dean said and before Cas could interject, Dean put his hand up and said, “Hear me out. I like you and you like me, I know you do after all of the messages you left me. We can try to date again. But this time take things slowly and see where they go. What do you say?”
She told him that there would still be a forty percent chance of him getting the cancer back later on in his life even if he beat it now. But Dean thought that a sixty percent chance of never getting the cancer again was good so he agreed to try out the pill.
After putting Sam to sleep, John walked down the stairs and sat in his chair. "Why doesn't one of you go shower first and you can tell me all about your day later?"
They had been eating dinner when the song came on the radio. Dean, being ever the enthusiast jumped off his stool and had dragged Cas to the living room.
It turned out that Asher did have good deductive skills. Maybe not Sherlockian level deductive skills, but definitely some deductive skills as he had found out who the new student was. Or maybe he had found out who she was because the teacher had asked the new girl to introduce herself but no one had to know that. Either way, he had found out the new girl’s name and had invited her to lunch with his friends.
When he got there and told her what had happened, Anna took him in his arms and led him into the living room while she went into the kitchen to make some tea.
He started rapidly knocking on the door when Castiel yelled, "I told you to stop that, Anna. I'm going to tell mom."
“Mr. Singer and -” Dean perked up at this name as the teacher scanned the sheet she was holding and called out another name, which unfortunately for him was neither Charlie’s last name nor Jo’s but was in fact Sam’s.
Although the class hadn’t started yet, Dean started copying down the notes. As he glanced up briefly at the blackboard and back at his notebook, he couldn’t help but smile.
John smirked when he looked at them and saw that both Castiel and Anna frowning at their breakfast. He knew it wasn’t the time to laugh but he couldn’t help smile at the one good thing he had witnessed since the whole mess had begun the night before.
Dean‘s too engrossed by his thoughts that he hasn’t even realized that half of the class has gone by. He only notices when he sees that when he sees that Asher isn’t sitting next to him and that Castiel has taken his place.
Dean turned away and tried to pay attention to the ramblings of his teacher but after seeing Castiel, his brain had gone into overdrive. His thoughts went from ‘
Once he heard that annoying sound of fabric yet again, Sam muted his show and exclaimed, “That’s it. Stop it!”
Later that day, when the Winchesters were eating dinner, Mary noticed that Dean was frowning. Actually, he seemed gloomy ever since he got back from school. At first, she put it off as tiredness but on the other hand, how tired could pre-schoolers really be?
“Me too. Not a day goes by without me wishing that she hadn’t taken her life and that she was still here.” Anna sighed and added, “But I just remind myself that that bastard is going to be paying for the rest of his life for what he did and what he drove her to do and it helps. It helps to
Cas figured that every person in this universe got stuck with some kind of misfortune. He wasn't a pessimist or anything but he was sure that every person (even the one who smiled the most in a 7 am morning class) had something they would rather change in their life. And Cas himself wasn’t immune to that as he did have some physical qualities he wanted to change about himself. Like for example, he really didn’t like his crooked nose or the fact that his hands were pretty small (or delicate as his brother, Gabe had teasingly called them) even though he was a boy. He also knew that sometimes he could get way too dramatic as he’s been called a drama queen lots of times before by his best friend, Balthazar (which is quite ironic as Balt was considered the drama queen of drama queens by their other friend, Meg.) Really, the more Cas thought about it, he came to the eminent conclusion that he might need to find new friends soon, friends that didn’t take every opportunity they could get to call each other drama queens.
As Dean heated up the remains of the pizza, he couldn’t help but glance over at Castiel. He almost gasped when he looked back. Castiel had rolled up his sleeves and holy shit. His arms looked great. There were no hints of bruises or scars that had been put there on often occasion.
One time, Bobby had invited John for a hunting trip and Dean had begged and begged his father to let him come and his father eventually caved in. And since John took Dean, he had no choice but to take Sam and Cas as well.
Ellen glanced down at the plaid pajamas that had reindeer drawn all over them. “Your father got them for me, and it was a sweet gift, god knows he’s the sweetest out of all of you.” Ellen narrowed her eyes.
Once they had gotten through the doors and asked for their fathers’ room number, they took the elevator and were met by a doctor who was standing outside their fathers’ room.
Castiel was usually a quiet kid and that didn't really bother Dean. He liked that they weren't similar in that sense; it was nice having friends who were different from you. But today, he seemed quieter than usual and Dean wanted to know why.
The only thing he clearly remembered from those early moments was the safety and contentment he had never felt anywhere else.
This is what made Cas special; he genuinely cared and believed that should get a chance at being happy.
“Just remember, if you ever do anything to hurt her-” Ash didn’t get to finish because Jo walked up to them.
After Mary's death, Dean noticed that his father had changed a lot. John was more distant and almost never smiled. Dean was worried that his father's sadness had something to do with him.
“Dunno, probably not much,” Castiel said as he sat down and placed one bowl for Dean and another for himself.
"I'm not Anna." Dean yelled back. Within seconds, the door opened and Castiel let Dean come into his room.
“That’s a nice story you got there, Dean but I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Cas said and then he shifted his gaze to look past Dean. And suddenly, Dean was brought four years back when he watched Cas stand in front of him and lie through his teeth, feeding bullshit to Dean and Sam and Bobby and expecting them to believe it. And with one glance at Cas’s face, Dean had known that that Cas was lying. Just like he knew now.
“Whatever I don’t care.” Sam said and rolled over onto his stomach, letting the popcorn bowl fall, spilling the contents. Dad was going to kill them if he came back from Bobby’s and found this mess. But Dean filed that away for later. Right now, he had to find out what was going on with his brother.
She came to tell him that she had gotten into FIT in New York and was leaving soon. She said that he hoped he would get better and if he ever needed anything, she definitely wouldn’t be there. But then she winked.
Several hours later when Dean had had enough drinks to almost forgot that he has been living with a vampire, a creature of the night, a supernatural creature (he could have gone on forever with the synonyms but he won’t because this story has to go on), he stumbled back into his place.
Cas laughed and Dean hated him for that. Cas was supposed to be annoyed with him at the joke, not laughing at it.
It wasn’t really true what they said about time healing a wound or making the grief easier. In fact, Dean would say that sometimes the grief could be even worse after a long period of time. It wasn’t that a person stopped feeling the pain of losing a loved one; it was more so that the person learned how to live despite the pain. And sometimes, while they grieved, people would do stupid things.
Ellen nodded but there was a strange look in her eyes that Dean didn’t quite like. “Okay, honey, I guess if there’s nothing to talk about, then you can go to school. I just-” Ellen wiped her mouth and then added, “- I know it was tough after Karen died and I know I’m not your mother but I hope you know that you can always come to me if you want to talk.”
After the whole stranger-danger fiasco went down, Cas decided to take a nap and Dean was using the time to work on a new article. He had called Bobby and told him that he wouldn’t be able to come in to work for the next week or so.
“We can’t stay in here forever.” Castiel whispered. They were sitting on the floor of Dean's bedroom.
The next day Dean woke up and went to take a shower like he had done every other day. But he knew that something had changed when he came out of the bathroom and Cas said “Who are you?” while holding a baseball bat in his hand.
Dean waved his hand at Chuck, “Yeah, yeah all that destiny bullshit, yada yada yada. It must run in the family to throw people in alternate dimensions when your children have tried doing that once or twice already.”
Within minutes, John then returned to the table, and placed three plastic cups, each filled with a bit of beer. He pushed one cup to Sam and one to Dean and said, “I’ll allow it just this once.” Then he winked at Dean and Dean knew that his dad most likely suspected that he had drunk beer before but Dean didn’t say anything and grabbed the cup, bringing it to his lips. Sam meanwhile took the cup as well but was looking at it as if drinking the beer in it would somehow turn him into a toad.
Dean smiled slyly. “You especially told us your ever-growing love for Alfie, which honestly I’m not surprised about, you guys did have that weird vibe going on.”
“What? What is it, Sammy?” Dean couldn’t contain his patience for even a second when his brother, who usually didn’t curse a lot, was cursing like a sailor.
Sam practically jumped out of his father's arms and ran to Dean. He jumped on Dean's lap and said, "Guess who I saw today."
Dean swallowed past the lump in his throat again and blinked several times. He refused to cry. “Okay, dad.”
John noticed Dean's glance and smiled softly. "The firefighters managed to save it, said they had a feeling that it would've meant a lot to me."
All he could do is keep looking at Castiel pushing Meg against the wall and them making out and touching everywhere- and really Dean should look away but he simply
The honeymoon of their relationship lasted a total grand of ten minutes. They had been making out on the bench, when a lady who was walking a dog nearby started yelling obscenities and threatened to call the cops on them if they didn’t stop their behavior immediately.
“Holy shit, I’m really sorry.” It took a few seconds for Dean to register that Blue Eyes had spoken.
“Are you seriously calling me the girl version of my name when the last thirty minutes have just proven that you’re the girl.”
For the first time since he started drawing, Sam put his pen down and turned around to face Dean. “What party?”
At first, Cas had felt that the song was a bit too depressing for his liking but Dean had confessed that it was secretly one of his favorite songs and Cas decided that he liked it too.
Asher shook his head. “No but I have great detective skills, I’m sure I’ll find out her name by lunch.” And then he scattered off to his first class.
Anna pushed past Castiel and went to sit down on the couch. Castiel seemed to be dazed for a few seconds but then followed suit and sat next to his sister.
John nodded or at least what seemed to be a nod. “Listen, Dean, take Sam and Cas home. You guys don’t have to be here-”
Castiel sighed as he walked up the stairs and fetched out his key. He opened the door again and went to hang his coat. He walked into the living room and grabbed one of his shirts that was lying on the couch. Ever since
One weekend, Bobby came to visit them and after he came through the door and hugged both boys, he said to Dean, “Son, you been eating? Looks like you lost some weight.”
And after he met Dean, he found out that mac & cheese was his favorite food as well. So, he thought if he made it today, maybe, maybe they could have an actual conversation.
At the mention of Dean, Cas started yelling at Chuck. “He had not right to do that, no fucking right!”
Dean rolled his eyes as he compared their answers. He sighed as he noticed that a lot of his answers didn’t match with Asher’s and he knew whose answers were right. He really hated Trigonometry. He hated himself more for pushing himself so much last year that he did so well in his previous class that his teacher recommended him for the accelerated math program.
Anna banged her fist against the T.V. screen and everyone turned their attention to her. “That is enough. I am tired of all of this,
School was over and Dean couldn’t be happier. He was done with all of his exams and classes and now all he had to do was wait for Cas to finish up his exam and then they could start off their first summer together as a couple.
night with Cas and then frowned, putting the comic books back in the bag. He didn’t need a reminder of the shit he had done to Cas. God, he missed that assbutt so much.
“He cheated on you,” Sam said accusingly after Dean finished telling him their plan while Cas sat in the car waiting for him.
“You’re starting to sound like my dad, what’s wrong, Cas?” Dean said putting his hand on Castiel’s arm comfortingly.
“She’s Mary and he’s Bobby John,” Sam said softly as he smiled down at them and then gently placed Mary into Dean’s arms while giving Bobby John to Cas.
“Cas,” Dean said, turning away from Cas so he wouldn’t see Dean wiping his eyes. “What am I supposed to say to that?”
He cleared his throat before he began to speak. “Listen Cas, I don’t know if you can hear me but I want you to know that with us, the sun never set, not even in the end. And I uh- I hope you take care of yourself up there. Maybe you’ll see your parents and maybe you can say hi to mine if you see them. I just hope you’re happy and at peace and I love you."
Dean shook his head; he did not want to get into this conversation right now. “Never mind. I have to go to class.”
night, Castiel had taken the couch and Dean had stayed in their bedroom. Castiel supposed it wasn’t his bedroom anymore.
Years later, his little brother would tease him about how he could never shut his mouth even from the start. But he would just roll his eyes and lightly punch Sam in the arm.
Dean shot out of his seat quickly and said, “Thanks, Ellen but there’s really nothing to talk about.” Then he ran out the door and to the car, as he knew Jo was not one to joke around and that if he didn’t get out of the house in the next few seconds, he would end up walking to school.
“Hmm, let me think,” Dean put his fingers onto his chin as if he was contemplating on how to answer the question. Then he spat out, “Maybe never.”
One day when Cas was out really late, Dean had gotten sick with worry. Look, he still knew that Cas was a vampire and that guy could take care of himself. Okay, that knowledge hadn’t flown out of his head. But he did still worry about Cas. So, he stayed up late waiting for him to come home.
Ash nodded right when Castiel blurted, "You're Asher." Castiel remembered Dean mentioning him before.
And that’s exactly what happened with Bobby after he lost his wife, Karen. Well, maybe it was only Dean who considered it stupid. See, after Karen died, Bobby needed extra help with clerical work at the mechanic shop, as it was Karen who had always taken care of that part of the business and though Dean quite disagreed with him, Bobby apparently thought that Dean would be a great fit for it. Plus his dad kept throwing in how it could be a great experience and how he could write about it in his college applications.
Once he had the route memorized, he sped out of the house and jumped into his car as quickly he could.
Two months had gone by since his treatment had begun and Dean was getting better. He felt like shit of course, because of the chemo. But at the same time, he felt like he would actually get better. Like he had a chance of beating this.
Asher shook his head at his friend's stubbornness. "Fine, have it your way. We're all just tired of your fights."
So by the end of senior year, as they sat in their morning honors English class (Yes, Dean was smart, weren’t you paying attention at the beginning?) and Dean had found yet another way to annoy Cas, Cas decided that enough was enough and he exploded. He started yelling and then Dean started yelling back and soon enough they were both red in the face with their nostrils flaring and both of them had their fists out (not that they would know how to use them as neither of them had been in a real fight before but hey it was their pride dictating their actions) and the teacher, Ms. Milton (god bless her soul for putting up with Cas and Dean for such a long time) had to separate them.
A/N: Hello. First of all, I would like to apologize for not updating this story regularly. Finals are finally over and I should be able to update this story on a regular basis. Secondly, I have not abandoned this story. I do have it planned out and will continue writing and updating it. Also, please review. Feedback motivates me to write more.
Unfortunately, Cas had only been twelve at that time and didn’t know that when a boy pulls a girl’s (well in this case, boy’s) pigtail, he liked them. So he thought the habit would stop but it only got worse.
thing he could think of: he started picking on Dean back. Whatever Dean did, he did back to him. They were quite the pair, weren't they? The answer is yes, they were
Dean decided to leave the party early. He lied to Jo and told her that he wasn’t feeling well, not completely untrue, and that he wanted to go home. Jo wanted to stay a bit longer, which he understood so he ended up walking home alone.
Later that night, after Cas had come back from his sister’s place and Dean and Cas were eating dinner, Cas said he wanted to talk about everything that had been going on but Dean did not. Even when Cas told him that it would be a good thing for them to talk, Dean wouldn’t relent.
Then he remembered that Meg had moved to New York a few years back and he wondered if Ruby would run into Meg there. He laughed as he imagined their conversation. Those two would make quite the pair.
A pile of magazines was stacked on a nearby table. He noticed a coloring book on top of the pile. A few crayons lay near it and Castiel decided to take it.
Ellen snorted. “That’s true, but don’t let my daughter hear you talking about her driving skills. You’ll never hear the end of it.”
Sam stopped jumping, which Dean was pretty grateful for because his head was starting to get dizzy. “Remember how I wasn’t sure if Madison liked me?”
Disclaimer 2: The title is from the song, Chasing Cars and I am not making money by using it as the title of my fanfic.
Dean locked the door and went to sit next to Anna and Castiel. He got as close as he could to Castiel and laid a comforting hand on his arm.
experience of calling his dad and letting him know that he was going to have stay late at school because he had detention. Bobby in turn didn’t wait a second in telling Dean that he’s a damn idjit for getting another detention. Dean explained the circumstances surrounding the detention, which did make his dad lighten up a little, though he knew he was still in some trouble. Bobby promised to pick him up once he was done serving his detention.
Several days later, once they were safe and sound in their apartment and Cas had his essence back (which meant no more fangs, which also meant that Dean could no longer make ‘bite’ jokes), Cas was showing off his magical powers (which were
"Isn't that a good thing? We'll have another friend." Either Castiel couldn't hear Dean's disdain or maybe he wasn't listening, Dean wasn't sure. But Dean had to make sure his friend understood his worrying.
Suddenly, a middle-aged man dressed in shabby clothing stepped out of the hut and upon noticing Cas, he cackled.
After Dean started working there, he had to admit that it wasn’t that bad. It also helped that he was being paid. Plus when it was a slow day and there weren’t many customers around, Bobby or John (whoever wasn’t busy at the time) allowed him to get under a car and would show him the ins and outs of fixing a car. Overall, Dean thought that it had turned out to be a pretty great first job.
"Okay, honey. Just remember, we'll love you no matter who you decide to marry," She said and gave John a pointed look.
The next day, after Cas had left and they had said their goodbyes, he, Bobby and Sam had gone to a nearby diner for lunch.  It was more of a brunch but Bobby had previously said that as long as he was living, he was never going to utter the word, “brunch.” So Dean and Sam decided to just call it a lunch and then called up Bobby to see if he would be able to come.
like her." John kept yelling and suddenly, Sam started to cry. John left to check on Sam, leaving Dean alone in the room.
So it was no surprise that one Friday night when Cas and his debate team had to prep for their upcoming debate, and Dean's friends were busy with studying (as if Ash needed to study), Dean was home, sitting on the couch in his sweatpants watching reruns of
. Now Cas was ashamed and that made Dean feel guilty as hell. “Cas, it’s okay. Something like this was bound to happen.”
Dean complained the whole way downstairs and kept saying how great of a player was when Castiel told him that his usual adversary was a seven-year old, to which Sam yelled, "Hey!" Dean laughed and tried to ruffle Sam's hair but Sam waved his hand away.
"Okay, you have to listen to me carefully." Dean waited for a reply and only when Castiel realized that did he answer, "Okay."
Castiel sighed and thought back to the day his mother had agreed to teach him how to make mac and cheese for the first time.
Before she took her last breath, one thing occurred to Mary: she would never hear her baby's beautiful laugh again. Sam's laugh had always made her happy but it didn't have quite the same effect as Dean's did, once upon a time. She knew that she should have felt guilty but it wasn't like she loved either of her sons more than the other.
“Drive safe and have a good day at school. Bobby will pick you up from school.” Ellen yelled after him as Dean opened the passenger door.
“Well I was thinking-”Dean paused looking up at Castiel. Castiel nodded and Dean continued, “Do you want to go on a road trip with me?”
“Okay,” John answered. “Well then, I’m going to go make dinner.” And then John got up and left Dean’s bedroom.
“That’s no excuse!” God, Dean needed to get out of here. He couldn’t stand to be in this room any longer. He really needed to leave.
He walked down the hallway and then opened his parent's bedroom door. He did not see anything strange but could still hear the noise. He realized that the noise was coming from the bathroom. Arriving in front of the bathroom, he turned the doorknob; not knowing that what was on the other side would change him forever.
A few days later, Zack had tried to get under Castiel's skin again. Dean punched him in the face and said, "I told you I'd be watching you. Oh and since you didn't understand me the first time, I'm going to tell you something else. My dad's an ex-marine, just in case you ever try that again." He made sure to stress every syllable.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah," Dean called back and entered his room. As Dean sat down on his bed and grabbed the TV remote, someone suddenly attacked him.
For the next hour, Dean chatted with his friends about school and about their recent meet, especially about how coach had been really crazy the day before, making them swim the extra laps. Everything was fine until Dean looked up and saw something that made his jaw drop.
After they were seated in their booth and ordered their meals, Bobby bombarded Dean with all types of questions. At first, he asked Dean how was he doing and how he was feeling.
At the end of the school day, Castiel went to their usual meeting spot and stood there waiting for Dean. After a few minutes of waiting, Castiel thought about walking home alone but then he spotted Dean.
It had been hard for them to part with Bobby but they knew it was for the best. They, especially Dean, needed to learn how to live independently. Dean had some money saved up from his past summer jobs and both he and his brother had some money saved from the holidays so that would help them pay off the bills for now. And after school ended in a month, they would both get jobs.
Sam responded that he liked most of his teachers, even the tough ones. He also told Dean that his friend, Gabriel from middle school was in some of the same classes as him, which he was glad about and that he made friends with another kid named Sully.
“Well the family was great. But once Anna turned eighteen, she became my guardian and she thought we should go back, she wanted to see some of her old friends and her boyfriend lives nearby plus she thought I might do well with a few familiar faces, which I guess she was right.” Cas smiled softly, to which Dean had to smile back.
Eventually after twenty hours of driving, they found Metatron. It was in the middle of nowhere. Literally. Some forest off the I-78 highway.
Also, Ash and Alfie came to visit him. They came with a bag of goodies for Dean. Dean was grateful for that bag but also wondered how they had managed to get it past the security guard and all the doctors on his floor.
When he got there, he spotted Cas sitting on the bench near the swings, sipping on an iced coffee and holding another cup in his hand. Dean had to smile at this, Cas was always so considerate.
Dean rubbed his face and ran his fingers through his hair. He felt like ripping his hair out. He decided being blunt was the best tactic at the moment. “Fine, I’ll tell you. You’re an angel.”
"Son, I've been around long enough to know evidence of bruises. And I do know that even during play-fighting, Dean can sometimes be a little too-"
The constant buzzing of the phone woke Dean out of his memories. Dean wished he hadn’t been thinking of them. They were just memories now, nothing more.
“You’re going to clean up, put on a tough face on and get back to your man. Dean needs you now more than ever, you understand?” Anna looked at him expectantly.
Dean and Castiel spent their summer nights either hanging out with their friends or going on dates by themselves. And though Dean, Cas and their friends dreaded it, all of them spent weekends together studying for the upcoming SATs.
John was about to say something else when he noticed the fearful look in Castiel's eyes. "Alright, I'll stop asking. But if you ever want to talk, I'm here, okay?" John looked at Castiel for confirmation and Castiel nodded.
P.S. Thanks to the help of my beta, jmcarthy, I have gone back and revised the chapters. Due to my summer job, I am busy and cannot work on this story everyday. I will try my best to post a new chapter every Friday.
“Meg, I really don’t care about your boyfriend of the day.” Dean glanced at his watch. “Nor do I have the time for this.”
After he received his diploma, he went back to his seat and waited for the rest of the names to be called. Why couldn't Dean's last name start with something other than W?
“Yeah, I know but I can’t - I can’t just let him die, Sammy,” Dean said and swallowed past the lump in his throat.
“As you can see, I’ve written the final project assignment on the board, which you will work on in pairs that I’ve already chosen-” Everyone groaned at this, earning a patient, but tired smile from their teacher before she continued. “As I was saying, the final project assignment is on the board and it will be in lieu of the final exam.”
“You really shouldn’t be smoking.” Cas said. When Dean didn’t react, he stepped closer to his boyfriend, pulled on Dean’s sleeve and spat out with as much venom as he could, “Why the fuck are you smoking?”
Dean hadn’t realized this but he had actually been frozen in place since his dad had told them he got bad news, awaiting whatever awful news his dad was going to tell him. And when he heard it, he breathed out a sigh of relief and then immediately regretted it.
Dean had gotten his cancer back. For the past year, they had been planning to adopt a kid and were going to start working on the paperwork when he had started feeling worse. At first, it had not been so bad; just a few headaches here and there and he thought nothing of it. That is until he started coughing up blood which was when Cas made him go see a doctor. And there at the doctor’s office, he had been told that he had cancer. Of course, it was just his luck. Just when he thought he could have something good in his life, he got shit thrown at his face. As if that wasn’t bad enough, the doctor told him that because he had gotten it a second time, he had a lower chance of survival.
Plus, Castiel would always make sure to talk to each person in the car, except for Dean. He would even avoid looking at him.
The music could be heard miles away from Meg’s house and Dean wondered if she had gotten her pointers on how to throw a crazy party from Victor. As they walked, some guys who were already on their fourth drink (of whatever it was that was in the cup because Dean really could not tell as he was sure Meg’s punch was a mixture of everything possible) smirked in Jo’s direction. She, however, scrunched up her nose in disgust and walked past them. Dean waved back at them and winked in their general direction. In his opinion, it was hilarious to see the drunken boys in their confusion.
Dean died quietly on a Sunday evening. He went peacefully in his sleep. He thought about his mother making pie on a rainy day. He thought about his father teaching him to drive for the first time and how surprisingly patient John was that day. He thought about the movie nights he used to have with Sam before he went off to Stanford. And he thought about Sam and Jess’s wedding, the day so many things had gone wrong but was still one of the days he had always cherished. He thought about his niece and nephew and how he wished he could stay so that he'd see them grow up. He thought about his friends and how he was going to miss them. And then he thought about Cas, Cas who had known him since birth, Cas who had been with him through the best and the worst and the ugly and the beautiful and the last thing he thought before he let go was:
“That night, I was so angry, God, I was so fucking angry and I just wanted you to feel at least half of what I felt.” It spilled out before Dean could think of what he was going to say. Cas always had that effect on him.
"I-" Naomi looked at Dean's big hopeful eyes and said, "Oh alright." She let him in and he ran up the stairs to Castiel's room.
After Cas had left, Dean looked out the small window and saw a couple walking by holding hands with their toddler.
"Dean, your dad loved your mom very much. How would you like it if someone you wanted to be with forever suddenly died?" Castiel said.
Castiel did the only thing that came to his mind and hugged his sister. He hoped it would make her feel better. It certainly made him feel better when his mother used to hug him; he swallowed down the memory and hugged Anna back.
Since Dean was a senior and didn’t have many classes but his brother was a freshman and had a much longer schedule, Dean was stuck waiting in the library for his brother’s school day to finish.
“Well I’ve already gotten a reputation, haven’t I?” Ellen laughed. After a few second of silence, “I saw you looking at my slippers, they help me think.”
They sat in silence for a few minutes before Jo got up, extended her hand and said, “Hey want to go dance?
“Probably still sleeping.” Dean said, as he made sure the cereal was soggy before he ate it. “Little dork likes to read, wouldn’t be surprised if he stayed up again.”
Dean held his gaze. “Yeah, it was cute.” After a few moments of silence, Dean said, “I think we should try at it again.”
“Yeah, well your father can kiss my ass,” Dean said. “He’s probably kissing someone else’s ass in prison.”
“Hey, man, glad you could make it.” Victor said as he made his way through the tight crowd that had gathered.
"Yeah, Dean." Castiel said assuredly. He didn't think he could do it, though. But he didn't want to tell Dean. He didn't want to look like a failure in front of another person.
Mr. Jefferson huffed a mocking laugh. “No matter what you may think, Mr. Winchester, your sarcasm will get you nowhere.”
Later, as both boys walked out of the classroom after detention, Dean asked Sam if he needed a ride home. It was the least he could do seeing as they lived right across the street from each other.
“So,” He cleared his throat and added, “would either of you like to tell me what was going on there?”
They had had a quiet wedding at city hall. Only Sam, Bobby and Cas’s sister, Anna were invited to the ceremony.
“Though I cannot fathom why, Ash insisted that I give you these myself.” She dropped two small envelopes on the table.
After he had washed up, Dean returned from the bathroom bearing a grin that he hoped was convincing but the looks on Sam and Bobby’s faces told him that there was no use in pretending.
“Nah, he was upstairs watching some old war documentary, you know how he likes those movies.” Sam chuckled and Dean smiled back weakly.
“Nothing, I just wanted to talk to you.” Dean said as he sat on Castiel’s roll-up bed. Anna had gotten the inflatable bed and since she was the oldest and the only girl, she got to stay in the basement. Dean had to resist rolling his eyes when she had said that; she wasn’t any more a girl than he or Cas or Sam was. If anything, she was even more boyish than the three of them combined.
After a few minutes of conversation, Dean decided that having a brother wouldn't be so bad. He was actually getting excited when Naomi came in and called them to eat. Anna turned the T.V. off and the three of them raced to the kitchen.
On March 5th, 2010, Castiel woke up at the time he usually did. He got out of bed, brushed his teeth, and put on his clothes. He went downstairs and ate breakfast with his sister while his mother made some coffee. His father was nowhere to be seen but Castiel didn't care much about his missing presence. He suspected his father was at the office.
Following that, he got dressed and got into the car. He didn’t want to do this but he knew he had to.
After Cas had apologized to Chuck about his earlier outburst and promised to eventually call the publishing company back, Ruby and Chuck left.
And then at that moment Dean guessed that fate wasn’t on his side because Ruby decided to lift her head up from her textbook and caught his stare. “Aww, is someone in love?” said Ruby smirking.
As planned, with the help of Bobby and Ellen, Dean managed to sell the house and after that, Dean and Sam packed up their things and moved in with Bobby. Time went by and little by little, things started to fall into place.
“You know I heard that the sooner you start the treatment, the higher your chances are. Of course, that’s not always the case but I’m sure you’ll beat this.” Bobby said and then kept on rambling on about all the different treatments.
Dean shook his hand off of his arm and said, “I’m fine.” Asher nodded and then went back in to join the conversation.
Once they pulled up to the building, Ellen however did not allow them to get out of the car and decided to give another speech.
“Mmm.” Cas sighed. There was no way of getting Dean to agree with him when he got like this. Cas decided it was best to relent and let Dean win this time.
At that moment, Dean was thankful that they were in the dark and that Castiel could not see him blush.
“Don’t worry sweet cheeks.” Anna went to pinch his cheek like she had done all those years ago but he waved her arm away in time.
The funeral was a quiet and short affair. Besides Dean and Sam, Bobby and some of John’s army friends had also come to show their support and give their respects.
All of a sudden, Dean remembered the conversation that he had with Castiel almost a year ago. He hadn’t even thought of it being important. Dean remembered feeling embarrassed that Castiel was still hugging him in school but he didn’t think that it had actually impacted Castiel.
Chuck rolled his eyes, “Dean, they don’t call me the All Knowing for nothing. Please don’t be embarrassed, quite frankly I am finding it kind of unnerving.”
Once both Anna and Castiel were out of earshot, Dean whispered hoarsely, “Options? Why do we have to discuss options?”
Time went by. The cold wind turned into a chilly breeze and flowers blossomed. And though cold had turned into warmth, Castiel could not feel the warmth. He felt his mother everywhere he went. He was so goddamn tired of always feeling this way. He wondered if there ever would be a time when he would feel like a normal eleven year old and not like an eighty- year old soul stuck in the body of a kid.
Dean stood in front of his dorm building. KU’s freshman dorm looked even bigger than he had imagined. He couldn’t believe that he was finally going to college.
"You'd better be prepared, Dean. I have such an evil plan in mind," Castiel said as he walked down the hallway to Dean's room.
“Shit.” Dean said, rubbing his hand over his face but then he looked back at Chuck and glared at him again, “But just because I wished that, doesn’t mean I made myself come to this universe.”
At that, Cas’s eyes softened. “Oh Dean, I’ll miss you too. But we’ll text and Skype and before you know it’ll be the end of August.”
With his hand still shaped in a fist, Inias turned around and was about to strike her when Castiel stepped in between them.
“Where are you going?” Anna asked him calmly. That was why he loved his sister. She never thought any of his plans or ideas were crazy or out of reach and she always listened, no matter what.
“Yes?” Cas tilted his head in the adorable way that made Dean want to press him against the bench and kiss him senseless but he had to remind himself that he couldn’t do that.
Dean narrowed his eyes at Cas. “No, I didn’t,” Dean said. “I didn’t think you needed to know that.” He hoped Cas couldn’t read through his lies. He didn’t want Cas to stay. Cas shouldn't be here. He needed to be spending time with his foster family and then getting ready for college or his gap year, whichever he had decided. He needed to live his own life and Dean wouldn't ruin that for him, no matter how much he wanted Cas to stay.
“Here you, go it’s a bit hot.” Dean said as he placed the plate before Castiel. Castiel, probably not noticing that Dean was still holding the plate, reached for the slice and accidentally touched Dean’s hand.
He had known logically that Cas was dying but seeing him sleep in that hospital bed, looking so small and near death, Dean walked out to the parking lot where he sobbed until he felt like he couldn’t breathe. He wished that his mom was still around so that she could hug him and tell him everything would be okay.
After making sure that Jo got home safely, Dean walked back home and decided that as dances went, this one didn't turn out to be so terrible.
The boy sighed. “Fine, my name’s Sam and before you make the stupid joke, it’s not short for Samantha.”
“Fuck, I can’t have a detention again, my dad’s going to kill me,”Dean ranted, when they were out of earshot, glancing at Cas when he remained quiet. “Hey, are you alright?”
Once he had gotten out of Sam’s house, he ran across the street back to his house and now he was pacing back and forth in his bedroom (correction: fake Dean’s bedroom) and contemplating on what he was going to do.
Once the boy had left, Mr.Shurley turned his attention to the other two. “Now, Dean and Castiel, please follow me to my office.”
"Shut up," Dean said and went to ruffle his friend's hair. Castiel swatted at his hand but Dean knew that he wasn't really upset; Castiel's smile was the best indicator.
When they entered the house, Dean wasn’t surprised to see where Asher was. Apparently Jo wasn’t the only one aware of Asher’s reputation of being a fun drunk as Asher was already entertaining people with his table dancing. When he spotted Dean, he broke out into a huge grin and jumped on the floor.
Dean got a detention for the fight and a speech from his father. "Threatening that boy with my veteran status wasn't really smart. You know the crap I had to go through while talking to his parents?" John had asked. And Dean told him that the kid had been picking on Castiel nonstop and that Castiel didn't deserve it, on top of the home abuse Dean knew he was forced to endure. John just sighed and sent Dean to his room.
Anna got up from her seat near the closet and went to sit next to Castiel. She wrapped her arms around him, pulling him in. “Hey, it’s okay.”
They sat on opposite sides of the bed, frowning. Suddenly, Castiel giggled and Dean followed shortly. Soon, they couldn't stop laughing. They were rolling on the bed with laughter, holding their stomachs.
While his father was discussing business, Castiel managed to slip out of the room. He tiptoed up the elegant staircase, making sure not to make any noise.
“Hello,” He said in a gravelly voice while cracking his joints. He hadn’t gotten up from the couch in several days.
His cell phone was ringing and Cas didn’t want to pick it up. He couldn’t care less who it was that was calling him. He had taken a leave of absence from work so he knew it wouldn’t be the school and he really didn’t want to talk to his family or his friends. However, the phone wouldn’t stop ringing so he got up from the couch and answered the call.

After finishing his drink and putting the glass into the dishwasher, he walked back into the living room.
John was sitting in bed and had the TV on low volume. When Dean entered the room, John quickly muted the TV and alarmingly said, "What's wrong, Dean? Why aren't you sleeping?"
At that moment, Mary woke up and smiled upon seeing her family. When she was fully alert, John went outside to see Naomi and Castiel, who weren't allowed to come because they weren't family. John noticed that Castiel seemed to be very upset about this so he decided to try to pull a few strings.
Cas ran his fingers through his hair. “I guess I just wanted stability. What with the way my life has gone, from my mother’s suicide to my father’s shittiness to moving away with Anna and then back to home, I thought maybe if I majored in something to do with science, for once, I would be able to find stability.”
After a few minutes, Castiel emerged in the room and upon seeing the baby in Dean's arms, he exclaimed, "He's so small!"
Then he decided to do what he hadn't done in two years: run away to the Miltons. Seeing Castiel would help him. He knew it would. He was down the street before John even had the chance to notice he was gone.
May rolled around and it grew hotter. Castiel still didn't know why Dean wouldn't hang out with him after school. He decided to handle it in a mature way.
Dean groaned, “Ugh, fine, I’ll go. But I gotta say, they need to work on their catch phrases a little bit.”
“Well seeing as-” Dean mocked, “we’re still married, you are still obligated to tell me everything.”
“We are not girls, Cas,” Dean said and added on, “Can we just watch this fucking movie without discussing feelings and braiding our hair?”
But that wasn't the most exciting thing that had occurred over the holiday break. The day before, Castiel had found out that he was going to have a younger sibling and he couldn't wait to share this news with Dean.
Dean slung his backpack over his shoulder, starting when a hand grabbed his arm. He spun around, “Wha-?”
It seemed look a good plan when they first thought of it. Now, now well Dean was freaking out that Cas had vanished into thin air.
As he went to wash up, he thought about what he was going to make for dinner. As he walked out of the bathroom, he saw Dean emerging out of the bedroom. He had his favorite ACDC shirt on. It fit nicely on Dean and showed off his muscles. Oh how Castiel had missed those arms.
Dean was pretty sure that it was the first time he had heard Bobby curse in his presence but decided not to mention it.
Looking up, he noticed that it was their principal. He had a scowl on his face and his arms were crossed. Dean knew right away that there was no way he was getting out of this particular conundrum.
Castiel and Anna had special permission to be off from school for testifying at court. Since Dean was to be a witness and Sam didn’t want to be the only kid in the household to go to school, John decided to bend the rules and let Sam stay home.
had it wrong. There was no way Dean liked him, he just liked to annoy Cas, for one reason or another. But as Cas thought over their interactions, he realized that despite Dean’s tactics to annoy him, he never actually did anything that could be considered
"Do you think we'll be okay?" Anna whispered a few seconds after John had bid them a good night and retired to his bedroom.
“Dean, I’ve told you before, we’ve been through a lot. And I love you and you love me but-” Cas paused, choosing his words carefully, “- Maybe we should talk things through before we start something?”
Bobby sighed again. “Listen, son, I’m not saying you have something, you might not be ill at all but we’ve lost a lot of people these past few years and I don’t want to add you to the list.”
"Truce." Dean shook his hand. They propped the pillows up against the wall and settled back down while watching T.V.
Sam glanced at him and smirked. “Are you just going to stand there all night or did you need something?”
“I know, I was there.”  Dean rolled his eyes but didn’t even bother getting up. Castiel wondered how much his friend had eaten. He knew Dean had a knack for eating a lot of junk food.
"Pleasure to meet you, Mrs...?" He said and placed a kiss upon Mary's hand. Naomi rolled her eyes; it was astounding to her how her husband still didn't know the names of their neighbors. It was all
. There was nothing there and honestly, Dean would have driven past it but Cas said he felt something off about the place and so they took the nearest exit and went into the forest.
“Okay, dokey.” Charlie looked like she wanted to say something else because she had opened her mouth as if to add on something but then seemed to change her mind because she said, “If he’s no one, then let’s go to class. We can’t stand around here or we’ll be late and I heard the professor’s a real witch.”
He was getting out of the shower when he received the call. It was his day off so he had decided to sleep in and he wondered who could be calling him. He knew Castiel was at work and he rarely called Dean during work hours.
Dean laughed at that and Cas smiled back at him. Then they switched subjects and Dean put it out of his mind. Everything was fine until he made eye contact with Cas That’s when Dean felt something funny in his stomach.
Asher followed his gaze and when he recognized Castiel, he said, “Holy shit… didn’t he and sister leave like almost four years ago?”
wants,” Sam parroted back. “Okay, you know what, I’m done trying to change your mind and getting you to see that this is definitely not a good idea.”
The hug surprised Dean and it was a few seconds before Dean could tear away. "Cas, you have to stop doing that. We're grown boys. It's weird if you keep hugging me in school."
Dean looked at Cas, who still seemed to be in a state of shock and knew that he would have to be the one to explain.. “Nothing, it was nothing, sir,” Dean mumbled, not meeting the expectant eyes of the principal. Maybe if he denied anything had happen, he could escape without a punishment.
He and Cas were definitely going to work on their communication skills before they jumped into a relationship.
And then he thought back to that moment. Him and Sam had just exited the bar and then they were in the car. And right then as the darkness was taking over, he had one thought:he had wished Sam hadn’t been his brother and then he wished he hadn’t known Cas. If he didn’t know them, he wouldn’t have been in this mess. Charlie wouldn’t have died. He would’ve lived a normal life and he wouldn’t have ever been wrapped up in this hunter lifestyle.
He could take the cold shoulder, the silent treatment; anything but he could never live with Castiel forgetting him. He didn’t want to live in a world where Castiel didn’t remember him.
“I’m sorry, okay.” Sam threw his hands in the air. “But I knew you would need him and I couldn’t stand to see you in pain.”
Dean smiled at his husband and Cas smiled back while Sam almost gagged. Sometimes, they were so adorable, it was sickening.
So since Dean wasn’t going with them, Dean pulled Castiel over to the side before Castiel managed to get into the car.
Time went on eventually and the flock disappeared (Cas still doesn’t know where all of the girls went, he swears he didn’t see them afterward, which is kind of weird considering they live in a pretty small town). And then Dean and Cas went back to being friends.
“They were probably trying to show off.” Chuck laughed. “My children always did like to compete for my attention.”
"Yes that would be me. But my full name's Castiel. I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't call me that though."
Deep down, Dean knew that what he had said was wrong. He knew that he had hurt Castiel in more ways than one. But sometimes, Dean didn’t think and he spoke or acted before thinking through the consequences. He had just been really worried about Castiel and wanted answers. Sue him, he was only a kid. A kid, who of course knew too much and acted quite often like an adult.
But he knew that couldn't happen. So he did the one thing he swore he would never do. He prayed to a God that he didn’t really believe in.
Sam rolled his eyes but Jess just gave him a small smile and then laid back down. As she watched Sam, Dean, and Cas fuss over her children, she fell into a gentle sleep.
Cas put his arm around Dean and pulled him in close, “Shh, shh Dean, it’s okay. I already forgave you and you know why? - ” Cas felt Dean shake his head, “-Because I know your soul and when you had the mark, it was not you, not really.” Cas planted a kiss on Dean’s forehead and rubbed Dean’s shoulder gently.
"Okay, my dad's home today. He's going to call the police and they're going to arrive at your house. So if someone rings, it's probably them." Dean paused again and then said, "And uh, keep talking to your mom. It might help for her to hear your voice. Can you do that?"
Later, when Dean got home after dropping Cas off, he walked into his house and the first thing that greeted him was Sam as he jumped right in front of Dean and chanted excitedly, “She said yes, she said yes.”
One night, Dean snuck into Sam and Cas’s room. He shook Castiel several times before Castiel finally woke up.
“Guess they came back..” Dean answered him before returning his attention upfront. However, Castiel wasn't in the front anymore. Dean concluded that he had missed Castiel’s introduction because Castiel was already walking to the back of the classroom and sitting down next to a black-haired girl.
When Cas ran out of the school and into Dean’s waiting room, they smiled at each other and shared a short kiss. Then they walked side by side to Dean’s car (well his dad’s car, really) and talked about their exams and what they were going to do over the summer.
"Don't worry, he'll be big in no time." John laughed. Then his face grew serious and he said, "You're a big brother now, Dean. You'll have to always be there for him."
“I don’t actually require sleep,” Cas said solemnly. “And no, Dean, you might have forgotten but I do have a bed, a bed we share. The coffin thing isn’t actually accurate.”
“Oh, honey.” His mother got up and hugged him. She smelled like lilies and since that moment, the smell of lilies had always managed to keep him calm.
Before Dean fell asleep, he thought about Castiel's home life and the unfairness of the situation and how he wished that there was something, anything he could do to help Castiel and ease his pain.
He looked at Jo, who sat on the other side of him and noticed that she was biting her lower lip while shaking from laughter. He couldn’t believe that he had lost her to the evil duo.
So far, everything had been going well. That was until he bumped into someone as he was reaching his locker. When Cas met eyes with them, he cursed his luck. Of course, he just
“If you speak one more time, you’ll find out the marvelous limit to my patience,” Cas said to Metatron before turning to Dean and gently saying, “Are you alright? I know how much you hate flying.”
“Dean, this is Ellen, she’s Bobby friend. She’s here to help us.” Ellen moved her hand forward and it was a few seconds before Dean realized that she was waiting for him to shake it.
Also, his doctor had told him about the new drug that had just been created. It was called Nyxveneter* and it was supposed to stop the cancer from growing and eventually eradicate all of the cancer cells. It was still in the experimental stage but because Dean qualified to receive it as a treatment, his doctor had recommended it to him and asked him if he wanted to try it out.
Dean glared at Chuck, who had taken to sit at the kitchen table. “I don’t care who you are. I don’t have any respect for you. How could you fucking leave the world? All of us? Did you think that we weren’t good enough for you to stay and you just decided you would just up and leave?”
"Goodnight, Sammy." Dean said and then shut the door quietly. He soon arrived at his room and took great care not to disturb Cas as he tiptoed back to his bed.
"Well with half a bottle of this- " She lifted the left side of her jacket to reveal a flask in the inside pocket. "-Calmness is my middle name."
In the dark of his dorm room, Dean grinned at his phone. Yep, it was definitely the right decision to break it off with Lisa.
A few seconds passed and then Dean said, “Well have a good trip.” He patted Castiel’s arm and started to walk away.
As he got up from the living room floor and got ready to chase Sam (who was already out in the backyard) and give him the biggest wedgie that dork deserved, Dean thought about how the summer had had its ups and downs but how overall it had been a pretty good one and how he couldn’t wait for the school year. He was sure it was going to be a great one.
Dean nodded. He felt more at ease now. But he still wanted to know why Ruby was here.  “Then what are you doing here?”
Anyway, a lot of people came to see him during those months. Even Becky came to see him. He was grateful to everyone who had come to see him and shown him their support. Though Becky wanting to sing and do some weird spiritual song/dance had freaked him out a bit, he still appreciated her coming to see him.
“Nice going, Singer, didn’t even tell me that you left the car.” Jo called as she neared the school’s front yard.
“You know, ghosts, witches, demons, all that crap.” Sam shook his head as if to show how ridiculous he believed his father to be.
Dean was leaning against the school building and though the crunch of the leaves nearby alerted him of the person, he didn’t have time to hide the evidence so he decided not to.
And that’s when he realized he should’ve listened to Sam and brought a laptop. The nerd had a point, not that Dean would ever admit that to his brother.
Inias Milton seemed to notice his wife's gaze because within seconds, he appeared mere inches away from her.
“Uhh..okay-” Dean scratched his head for inspiration. “Oh I got one. Your mom- she used to make you mac & cheese whenever you were upset. That started after your father missed your 10
“Look, it’s fine, you don’t have to make shit up, I get it, I can handle the rejection.” Dean averted his eyes.
He followed her but before he did, he turned and stared at the place where Cas had been standing. But there was no one there now.
“I was just paying my respects. I may have been bitchy and teased him a lot back in the day,” She smiled but after a few seconds, her smile grew sad and she added, “But he was a
“Well, one time we had this fight and Dean was really mad at me and said he wasn’t going to talk to me. But then a few minutes later, he started talking again.”
Inias Milton was guilty. Inias Milton was guilty. Inias Milton was- Castiel could still not believe it as he looked out the window of the impala as they drove away from the courthouse. He could still hear the judge’s decision loud and clear in his head.
As Dean began to protest, John added on, “-And I don’t want Sam to keep seeing me like this. He doesn't need to worry.”
“Are you kidding me?” Dean exclaimed, “I just got myself such an awesome guy, who’s hot and smart and funny, and then I had to start a stupid argument mere minutes after. Of course I have to apologize.”
." It sounded more like a question. Apparently he was now home by himself. He had made the mistake of thinking he was alone before though.
“But really, tell me, Castiel, what happened to your dream of becoming a writer? I thought you were going to major in English or something like that.” Dean said and before Cas could say anything else, Dean said, “If you don't want to tell me, you don't have to.  I won’t ask again. I’m just curious.”
At Dean’s raised eyebrow for a further explanation, Cas explained as they took off their shoes. “You remember how we went to live with a foster family after all that shit with my dad?”
"Okay." Castiel mumbled. He hung up and took his mother's hand. He told her different stories; he recounted the adventures that he had participated in. He told her everything, from his fights with Anna to the Friday lunch specials they served at his school.
The rest of the night went by quickly. Dean chatted with his friends. He kept drinking. By the time he was on his fifth drink, he felt up for anything so he danced with a few girls, even some guys.
Winter break had come and gone and soon Dean’s birthday had arrived. Dean didn’t really want to throw a big party so he had a small gathering of family and friends at his house. And it had gone quite smoothly, just as he’d hoped.
Later when he was getting ready for his date with Lisa, he kept pacing across the floor of his dorm. He wasn’t sure if this was a good idea. Sure, he had fun with her. She was nice and funny and smart. And let’s not forget really pretty. But fuck, he didn’t know any more if he should be with her. Cas had gotten into his head.
“I love you,” Cas blurted out and then widened his eyes, as if he was scandalized by his own confession.
Then the others rolled in. First Cas started to talk about goats and sheep. Then he talked about cats and how female cats were not consulted about a male cat’s penis being sharply barbed along its shaft.* The more messages there were, the drunker Cas sounded.
me. I don’t want to move in with Bobby. Not after- not-” Sam swallowed past the lump in his throat. “Dean, dad just- he
From there on, John started paying equal attention both of his sons. He tried to be more attentive and caring and Dean was really happy about it. He was happy that he finally had his dad back.
