He does feel a bit affronted at that. Does John think he can't make sandwiches? Because he can. He surely can. He never does, that's the thing. He's never been in need for a sandwich. Mostly because he doesn't eat a thing for days apart from tea, but also Mrs Hudson is always quick to bring a plate of something she cooked fresh and handmade. So, no need to prepare a sandwich.
«I could tell you, but this is not about trusting. This is about your need to satisfy your curiosity.» stay composed. Alert. His eyes must not leave the table, his facial muscles must remain impassible.
Sleepy laugh, foggy mind. John's standing above him, watching his face and waiting for a sarcastic come back. «That happened once, John. Once.»
«It is a problem, Sherlock. Normal people do not keep human parts in the fridge. I got over the normal part, but at least clean the damn fridge when they start decomposing!» he's not looking at John, but he can see behind his eyelids the tendons tensing in his neck, the small vein popping up on his left temple. He's probably gesticulating a lot too.
Mycroft's words are too alive, too pulsing and bleeding for him to cope. Bleeding, it's what he did for days. John doesn't need to know. «You don't need to know.» it's a whisper
«You do think I am incapable of making food.» John shrugs a little, small bites, eyes preceding every single one of them.
The smell lingers in the air, his body is faster than his mind reaching for the window's handle and opening it wide open. The wind makes its way in the flat, moving papers and curtains and air and that
Sherlock fights him, tries to break the grip and escape the embrace. Mycroft looks like he might cry.
The water is hot. Which is an extraordinarily stupid observation. Water is hot, water is wet, god is not real, beauty is a social construct. John is beautiful.
. He didn't know what scared them. He was the one who should have been afraid. But he wasn't, was he?
«Good lad, see? That's good.» His thumb's tip is burning. John's heart is loudly telling him to calm down a bit, not quite relaxed on its own, but still slower that Sherlock's wilding one.
Just dust. Dust covering everything, small ovals of fingerprints left here and there, rings of dirty mugs left on the table or on the desk to dry out.
«Because you can tell me if-if it makes you uncomfortable I could-I could...I don't know but you know... »
«But you are talking nonsense just like she would! Thank you for the food, Mrs Hudson but i need to work.» he dips his head in the uninteresting clients' mail. So many love affairs, so many husbands cheating and wives cheating and everybody is cheating and he feels a bit like John is cheating too.
She saw him growing paler day by day, shirts crumpled and tucked in his trousers. He was still trying hard to be decent, to have a shower every night and put something in his stomach at least once a day. Something solid.
There is no answer to that. They all stand in silence, John and Mycroft exchanging looks of understanding. Sherlock is stone cold, eyes studying the pattern of John's shoes, squeezing now and then with question that are bombarding his brain.
New jumper? «Why a new jumper?» he doesn't like new. What's going on? He can feel his brain answering but he can't catch up.
. Fork stops mid air. The last bite he took is resting in the back of his mouth, not quite ready to be swallowed. «Is this the result of your nice little chat with Lestrade? I am surprised.»
Mycroft knew and knows. He knew how hard it was for his little brother to cope with changes so drastic they brought him on the verge of a crisis. He knows how hard it is to cope with the changing routine now that he's back, the emptiness of the flat closing around his neglected body. He sees the stiffness of his brother's movements, the way his whole faces scrunches up in pain whenever his back touches the backrest of his chair, the never ending trembling of his long ruined fingers. He sees, he observes.
«And is there a reason you need a drink every two hours, or is it just bad habits taking my place?» and at that Mycroft just leaves, because he knows where this is going to end. He stands up without a word, umbrella tapping against the floor and towards the door.
But what comes next is scarier, because John not knowing was somehow comforting. If he doesn't know the details, he will miss the biggest one.
They never understood how much pain it brings him. It hurts, it stings his skin and his clothes are covered in pins and he can't get rid of them. Mycroft always held him tight and crushed his bones to the very core of them and his body felt like made of ash.
«Honestly, your brain might be the smartest of this planet, but you are incredibily dense.» he pinches the bridge og his nose, breathing deep and a bit too hard for it to have a calming effect. «It never occurred your brilliant mind that
«Out of it?» a gentle phrasing, eyes waiting for Sherlock to look at him and not just to him. «I think so.»
But he won't. He won't when Sherlock comes back in the room nor when they head back to Baker Street and the taller man asks him if he wants to come upstairs for a cuppa. And he'd really like to stay and drink tea like old times but he promised Mary he'd stay home to help her for the rest of the day and he just can't be late. «I'll just head back home, yeah? My lady needs me.» he attempts a laugh, to bright up the mode. As soon as he lift his eyes, the smile slides off of his face.
John was moaning constantly now, his eyes closed, he began frantically working his own cock until Sherlock batted his hand away.
“I mean it!” Sherlock’s tentacle’s slowly pushed out of his back and stretched to the sides, filling John’s vision once again. Sherlock nodded at them, signaling John to take a closer look at them.
He begun to thrust in shallow movements up into Sherlock, relishing the tight heat he had never experienced before. He let his head fall back and savored the feeling of Sherlock around him, with closed eyes.
It was 1 am when John came home. He felt exhausted and empty. The night with Greg had taken all his acting skills and the stairs seemed to feel a personal grudge towards him trying to be as hard to climb as possible. The dizziness John felt was suddenly replaced by pure wonder when he stepped through the living room door.
Just when he decided that he was apparently more inclined to take Sherlock to bed than he’d earlier thought, the doorbell rudely interrupted them.
Sherlock was already nibbling on a piece of toast and watching the cheerful landlady prepare an indulgent breakfast with a fond smile on his face.
“Alright.” He said gazing down at the point of their connection. He couldn’t see much but just knowing that Sherlock was inside of him, made his cock twitch. Slowly, he bottomed out, feeling Sherlock’s thighs against his bare arse.
“Come one. We should go in and change.” John suggested as casual as possible, while he held his hand out for Sherlock to take. After a few agonizing seconds, Sherlock quietly took his hand and followed him inside. John didn’t even attempt to wipe the grin off his face.
“I was just…What are you telling me?” John narrowed his eyes, trying to determine if this was some kind of sick joke. He felt anger surge through him and, clenching his hands in agitation, got up to put the food away. He was still hungry but the conversation had destroyed his appetite.
“Loo. Hydration. Nutrition. Understood?”John’s voice was firm but laced with worry as Sherlock stared unseeing into his face. “Come on.” The doctor said before he walked his taller patient carefully towards their bathroom.
?” There was mischief written in the corners of John’s eyes. Sherlock tried to gather as much data from his expression as possible.
John was extremely amused. For the great actor he was, Sherlock had never been able to hide his frustration, much less in the last two weeks. John had to admit that it was a bit cruel of him to interrupt every time they were close to coming, but that just wasn’t the way he wanted their first time to happen. He would regret it if they would come into their pants like teenagers and if he was honest to himself, he had needed some time to wrap his head around the idea of sleeping with a man.
Unhurriedly, John got up from his chair and walked towards the examination table. With forced casualty, he chucked his clothes and lay down.
Japan might have been an interesting place to spend a holiday at but, as it was, Sherlock and John didn’t see anything else than Shikoku Airport and a close by water reservoir where the detective assumed he'd find a corpse.  Sherlock had insisted that they'd stay there for a few hours and, again, he did turn out to be right. What he hadn’t accounted for were the old rotten steps by the lake side that, if John hadn’t grabbed his wrist and held him in an iron grip, probably would have cost his life. Dangling between the fourth and fifth step, a thick darkness beneath him, the detective managed to be rather annoyed than actually worried. As the initial shock wore down, John thought he saw a glimpse of something… shapeless moving in the darkness but before he could think about it Sherlock demanded to be pulled out of the hole and John did what he always did. He followed his order and waited for the next one to come.
“Ok.” John commented, not knowing what to make of the earlier intermission. Following Sherlock’s lead (as usual), he leaned down and pressed a teasing kiss on the tip of the detectives length.
“I don’t understand. That’s a nice speech you’ve just given but I don’t give a bloody fuck about your
“I wanted you for so long!” Sherlock stated with all the emotions he'd had to suppress for so long. It was all the confirmation John needed. He ran his hands over Sherlock's chest, savoring the feel of that pale soft skin under his fingers. Goosebumps, affecting John almost as much as Sherlock’s ragged breathing, spread over the milky torso.
“Not a rare name. Are you looking for a specific John or do you just happen to like the name?” Sherlock tried to be annoyed by the inane answer but he couldn’t help feeling a little amused.
Hearing Sherlock destroyed John’s last bit of will power. Hard and fast, he pushed all the way in. He slung his arms around Sherlock’s torso and pressed them close together, resting his forehead against the Consulting Detectives chest.
The feeling of utter fullness was almost entirely pleasant but when the first long thrusts began to graze his prostate, Sherlock was flooded with relief. He relished John’s strong certain motions and cobalt blue eyes that seemed designed to please him. Gradually, the sensation increased. John was upping the pace but it was obvious that he held back. His sighs were just as controlled as his movements.
“Yes, there is….” He entered the room to talk to Sherlock but John quickly put himself in his way, blocking his line of sight. Furrowing his brows, Lestrade took a step backwards.
“Listen! We both know why you are here. I thought, taking you away from your home and family would be enough to make you cry but apparently I was wrong. You are much more resilient than I thought but, believe me, it won’t take me long to break you. Soon you’ll be crying like a baby!” He was shaking his fist in front of Sherlock’s face, leaving no doubt as to how far he was willing to go. But Sherlock, as he had done since leaving his kingdom, refused to talk. There was no need to waste his intellect on this inferior being.
He stumbled into the narrow corridor leading to the toilets where he stopped dead, leaning against the dirty wall and taking a deep breath to sort his thoughts. He could feel warmth on his face and an extremely foreign feeling of…..happiness?
He watched the muscles in Sherlock’s thighs tense and relax in an increasing frequency as the Consulting Detective rode every push and pull of John’s body. Sherlock’s leaking arousal slid through the blue limb, aided by copious amounts of pre-come.
“Right.” He said, beginning to resume his explorations when he saw the hint of something dark blue in the middle of one of the openings. The pointed end wound itself out of Sherlock’s back. John let his thumb brush over it. It felt smooth, so smooth that it was  glistening. At first he thought it was wet but there was no trace of liquid on his thumb.
“Hey! Back off!” The man made to push him backwards but Sherlock caught his wrist with the right and in one fast motion batted forward with the heel of his left hand. There was a loud crack as he hit the minions chin before all tension left his opponents body and he had to catch the weight to avoid the thud-noise which would have been too telling for his taste.
Sherlock had to admit that he didn’t really know what to look for. He didn’t know anything but a name to go after and if no one actually greeted his target with a loud exclamation of it’s name it would be almost impossible to know who of those people might be John. Quietly, he regarded the man sharing a table with him. Mid-thirties, used to being outside, clearly a regular guest judging by the way people kept nodding at him as a greeting. Not a talkative one though. No one tried to approach him for a casual chat or asked him about his well-being. Even though the man’s beer seemed to magically refill itself every now and then.
For the last four hours the Consulting Detective had been walking back and forth between the automatic door and the common room. The countdown on the ridiculously vast display had just hit the 12 minute mark and John's own excitement could barely be contained.
Impatiently, John listened to the sound of running water and tried to not follow Sherlock into the bathroom. Not for the remaining 4 minutes anyway. But if he’d take only one minute longer…. John didn’t even have a clock but he was fairly sure that Sherlock was back sooner than promised.
Forgiveness was something that John rarely achieved. And in some cases he never did. It was just unbearable to play the loving husband while you fought the urge to run away and never look back. Or worse…. If you are  accustomed to violence, not using it can be hard. Especially if you are very, very angry.
The sun was already going down when John awoke the next day and was greeted by an epic hangover and the sticky sensation of being fully clothed. His head felt several sizes too big and every movement caused dizziness followed by the urgent feeling of sickness. It took him an estimated  20 minutes to sit up and when he managed to do so he was rewarded with memories of the last evening. Shit.
Sherlock stretched languorously when John returned to the bed. Gently, the doctor crawled over him and rubbed the towel over Sherlock’s chest and down between his legs. Already having himself cleaned in the bathroom he discarded the wet cloth and leant down to brush a feather light kiss right below the detective’s bellybutton. Sherlock opened his eyes lazily, watching with interest how John positioned himself on his thighs. He had often imagined such a domestic situation. While he was actually interested in sex in general, especially if it included one short, blonde army doctor, it had never been of uttermost importance to him. Moments like this, quiet intimate ones, held a strong appeal to him because they had always been so very hard to achieve for him. Not with John though, never with John.
The parlour got dark around them as John’s face and clothing changed and a glass materialised in Sherlock’s right hand. Distantly, he was aware of a slight dizziness in the back of his head. John’s posture changed with his appearance, turning into pliant lounging rather than attentive observation.
When he began to mouth down the shaft he heard an unsated whine that made his hands leave the mattress and grip John’s thighs hard. This close, he could smell fresh sweat and soap. Apparently, John had showered while he was gone. Without a conscious decision, Sherlock pulled on the fabric under his hands and observed the way the movement raised John’s cock before it slipped free of it’s confines. No underwear. Interesting.
“Erm… sure.” John’s voice sounds even more ragged now but Sherlock can easily identify the reason as pure nervousness.
Without looking at him, Sherlock made an annoyed sound. “What, John? Did you really think that I don’t get affected by our close proximity?”
John’s heart was racing, his own pulse loud in his ears. His feet felt glued to the ground where he stood and there was a prickling sensation in his fingertips. It took him a whole minute to respond.
Though, John was cuddled up against him, Sherlock pulled him even closer. He was already starting to get restless but he knew that it was generally expected to remain in bed with ones partner after sex. He was determined to wait until John fell asleep. He had nothing else to do than lying around so it didn’t bother him all that much. John sighed against his chest.
Apparently, he has lost the ability for speech so he pulls Sherlock up and kisses him forcefully before he attempts to position him upright on his lap. Sherlock chuckles above him before he produces a bottle of lube from under one of the pillows. He spills a small amount of the lube into his right hand before he moves it behind his back and shivers. John watches with rapt attention when Sherlock starts to speak again. His voice his hoarse and he is slightly panting.
Grabbing the crackers from the work disc, John walked back into the bedroom, taking Sherlock’s hand to drag him along without a word.
“I am glad how things turned out.” He whispered confidentially. “I am so fucking glad that it's just us, again.”
Hurried, John tried to rub the tears off his face. “You shouldn't have brought me here.” He whispered when he felt Sherlock's presence at his side. “Will you tell me what really happened on the tarmac?”
“Sherlock! Oh, god. You are so tight. So fucking hot. I want to feel you come around me. Sherlock. Please!” The detective surrenders. He held on tight to his control but now he is finally allowed to let go. He rocks down hard on John’s cock, fucking himself on it while John strokes his prick.
He had to wait two additional days. That meant 6 days in total of Sherlock being tied to the wall and getting “tortured”. Prince James always came alone, a manic grin plastered all over his face and a glint of evilness in his eyes. At first, Sherlock had expected to get hit and punched but that had been the exact opposite of the Prince’s plan.
John’s pace quickened and with it, his respiration. All of a sudden, John stopped dead. His eyes shot open. In shock, he looked down at his rapidly deflating erection. His thumb was resting on a small unevenness right at the root of his penis. John could clearly see and feel it. His heart was thumping wildly in his chest and his brain was working frantically. The bump was clearly getting smaller while his erection died down. John’s hand fell to his side, resting on the blanket unmoving. John stared blankly, searching his brain for some medical explanation. He found none.
Hamlet. He should have thought of that! What he didn’t expect was the end of the sentence. Well, he expected that there was more because of the way it trailed off, but he really didn’t expect
Well... This is it. As we all know, it took ages to finish. Not gonna lie...Porn is so much easier to write.
Sherlock felt the tentacles being pulled from beneath his skin, pressing through the little slits on either side of his spine. It made him groan in anticipation while he kicked off his shoes and socks to the other end of the room.
But he had done a good job accomplishing that. Luckily, he found himself ready now and just at the right time, for Sherlock seemed to have reached his breaking point. In the last three days Sherlock grew more and more agitated and his huffs of frustration weren’t as amusing to John as they had been in the beginning. Still, John couldn’t get over the fact that Sherlock hadn’t even once tried to talk to him. Surely, that nutter would rule out the most obvious solution. Instead he had tried to make John unbearably horny, trap him under his weight on the couch and on one occasion he had actually begged John to let him come. The last one had been the hardest test for John’s self control and left them both achingly hard and frustrated.
“He is a beta. Normal, if you want.” Sherlock answered narrowing his eyes before he flung himself backwards on the couch he’d been sitting on.
House was too big of a word for where they were headed. John could clearly see the sky through the first floor windows of the halfway intact facade. The ground level was pitch black from the outside. He raised his hand to signal a stop and knelt down.
It doesn’t happen often but Sherlock is at a loss for ideas. He has no reason to refuse, though. He takes a picture of his mouth and only his mouth. He edits it on his phone especially to cut it down on this one feature. He has a feeling that this is what John wants.
“John, I …. Can I do it again?” Sherlock couldn’t keep the pleading tone out of his voice but John didn’t seem to notice.
“Yes, Captain Watson, Sir.” Sherlock answered, his smug voice implying that he'd already decided that they were on different missions, then.
“Oh, John. Stop thinking. I know exactly what to do to make this pleasurable for both of us!” His breath tingles John’s ear with every word, causing goose bumps on his neck.
Past couple of days have been a ridiculous attempt to avoid John's gaze. His eyes are always busying one something too important to look at John.
«You should rest, John. I need my blogger well rested.» disinterested look, play with the pages of the newspaper. Look casual.
A phone rings, sudden and loud and it makes the detective jumps out of his skin. John's eyes pity him, sadness washing over his face as he reaches for his pocket. He eyes the caller, lets out a deep sigh. Again. «It's Mary. Just-wait a second.» and he's out of the kitchen, a weird new pitched voice answering the phone, sweet words of nothing trying to calm the woman down.
In the cell there was nothing but the piping screeching of blades being sharpened. It would make the hairs of his nape stand on end.
«It was not my plan, John.» Mycroft voice is small. Why is it so small? When has Mycroft's voice ever been this small?
«No, just-» his eyebrows are furrowed, lips tense and tongue sticks out rapidly for a moment. «I am going out, just wanted to let you know or you'd wake up to an empty flat and would alert you brother that someone kidnapped me.»
This conversation is empty. This is tirying. He needs to recollect and elaborate his thoguhts because his brain is storming. His mind is overloaded with informations and odours and noises and
«I believe he is, Mrs Hudson.» the brother pokes his head over Sherlock's shoulder and listen to the breathing pattern, slow and
morphine and cocaine? Are you insane?!» voice raising, his fist hits the table causing Sherlock to wince. His thin fingers are shaking as he tries to hide his quivering lips.
«No, you're right. I had therapy, which didn't do much on its own. But therapy didn't cure my limp, did it?» and he smiles so softly, eyes rimmed pink.
Is he going on a date? Is that Sarah woman from the surgery? Why would he care anyway. Phone not buzzing, no answer. Wasn't he funny? He tried to be funny. Whatever. He doesn't care. Does he? Shut up. His brain is foggy again.
The dark mop of dirty curls hangs low, chin against the chest, hands finally losing their fight against Mycroft.
His own right fist keeps hitting the temple, a raw bruise starting to darken. The walls of his bedroom are made of sand and they are crumbling down on him. His chest hurts.
«Going!» styled hair, that awfully cheap deodorant smell so familiar to his nose, bag under deep deep blue eyes.
John wasn't really attentive the past two days. Didn't pay attention to Sherlock, by the way. So he's hungry. But his stomach is twisting in a not-hungry way. He did got the milk on his was back home. Wasn't John happy? But why did he care? Since when did he care about John's opinion?
«What th-Are you serious?» he doesn't wait for Sherlock's answer, his ice cold eyes already setting him on fire with hatred. «Alright! God help me, you're unreal.»
Sherlock's been sleeping for the past hour. John sits quietly next to him on the bed, laptop on his knees. Mycroft brought a chair in the room and is sitting in a corner.
«Job, yes i know how poorly you do it. I'll try and explain, please take notes. I'm in hurry.» He never explained something faster than that.
Mycroft is standing still, back to John, his head hungs low. «I need you to understand that it was extremely difficult for me. I don't need to make sure you are aware of war's dynamics. You know war, Doctor Watson. I could not-»
The repetition of his name is stabbing the detective in his eardrums, the final “'ock” sounding like billiard balls hitting each other. He wants to block out the sound, he needs silence. But his hands are pressing on his ears so hard and it's only trapping the sounds inside his head.
Like a square-in-the-jaw punch in the middle of the crowded room of an elite restaurant. And like a bloody nose in a dirty pizza place.
Not only he calms down, but something lights up inside his brain and he does look up at John. Not only at, but inside him. He sees the gears running in John's head, the questions and the diagnosis and the confusion.
To John's disbelief, Mycroft does not respond. He groans as his arm lets out an alarming snapping sound and Sherlock lets go of him to turn to John. He points a finger to his chest, eyes sharp and redand
This time it was well after dark when his captor entered the chamber. Sherlock had always been amazed that common decency applied to domestic abuse, too, considering that most people waited for the night to hit their victim. Who would want to disturb their community with such unkind things, right?
Apparently equally dumbfounded, the older Holmes just nodded as he gripped the gun tighter in his right hand.
“Maybe.” John stated awkwardly. Nothing around the strange creature was corrupted in any way and it wasn't about to melt through the floor either.
He leaves the shower in a hurry, and John stands there for a few seconds, dumbstruck by the sudden loss of body contact. He can see the outline of Sherlock through the curtain and realizes that he hasn’t seen anything yet, so he pulls the curtain out of the way to stare unashamed at his about-to-be-lover. And stare he does. Sherlock dries his thighs off with a towel, looking oblivious to the fact that he is being thoroughly examined by his flat mate. Until he directs his gaze at John, that is. He continues to dry himself, his eyes remain fixed on John, who licks his lips while letting his gaze travel over Sherlock's pale, slender body. His pupils are blown wide and his cheeks flushed, apparently not only because of the hot shower.
For a second or two, John felt thrown back in time as they stood at the craters edge. The light they were following had more and more similarities with the gas lanterns he'd seen in old pictures. The ruins and lack of artificial light just served to strengthen the impression. Sherlock had already taken off his night vision and made to cross the 10 meters separating them from the light's source when John saw something move between the piles of gravel to their left. Silently, he grabbed Sherlock's arm and pulled him down into a kneeling position.
Mrs Hudson smiles in that motherly way, her eyebrows knitting together in worry. «You know what, dear. I know i am not your mother but-»
«So,» Sherlock's eyes leave John's, the direct contact agonizingly wearisome. «Is it true? I am not judging you. It's fine.»
he knows ashes, doesn't he? He studied ashes. Ashes are the results of material burning. But his skin never turns to ashes, not matter how many lit cigarettes he estinguishes on his arms. It's never ashes. Never never
«Why the hell the neighbor, Sherlock? Would you try explain? I have to report facts you know, it's supposed to be my-»
This is going to be bad. Bad bad bad. Count, count the dishes Mrs Hudson is washing downstairs. Count the many shades of red of the carpet. Count the smells from the kitchen. Find ten objects of many uses all standing in the same spot of the flat. Single out the mud stains on the shoes left by the door.
John says nothing, he's still standing in front of him with both hands resting on his hips and tounge licking the bottom lip absently. He shifts his weight one leg to the other. He's trying hard not to look surprised or give away the fact that yes, he knew, but hearing him say it out loud makes it harder. Harder to think Sherlock has undergone torture knowing
«And is it a problem?» why is he doing this. The icy shards are starting to sting his brain over and over. His skin is warming up and his right hand tighten around the fragile instrument.
One glass in memory of the DVD Greg bought him with that poor excuse Sherlock recited so well, the reasons he was not going to attend his birthday dinner that night.
Does John know then? Is he angry? Is he going to try and talk to him about it? «What. Are. You. Talking. About.» fake boredom, deep sigh «Eggs are becoming maggots, please go away.» He returns to the lying corpse on the slab, examines once more the petechial bleeding and the burnt fingertips as if he needs to be more sure.
He used to be a messy kid until he suddendly was not. It got worse and worse and lines and schemes and patterns and colours and emotions just mess things up! Anger doesn't goo with red, sadness doesn't match with blue! It doesn't it doesn't
Sorry for the late update. Sad events kept me away from writing and I hope I'll be able to update more frequently. Please leave comments to let me know your opinion on this story!
«Why the jumper, John? WHY THE JUMPER? ANSWER!» he is pacing like a maniac, hair wild and eyes wet and hungry.
The flat is silent. There is no clattering of glass recipients coming from the kitchen, it's been few weeks since she last heard that. There is no violin, no noises coming from the tv, no smoke of cigarette lingering in the air.
He always hear John, even when he's in his Mind Palace. It sounds a bit like speakers are in every corner of the building, trasmitting loudly every word the man says. It's like his brain
He pushes them under his bed with a swift movement and then turns to open the door. «You do lost your temper quite easily to be a both a soldier and a doctor, don't you? Mrs Hudson, I'm going to take that shower you were blabbering about eben though i find slightly offending the way you suggested that I do, in fact, stink. I'd really appreciate a cup of tea when i come back, if you don't mind.» don't look at John, don't look at John.
He refrained from taking something to remind him of Sherlock. He almost took that creepy skull off the fireplace. He considered taking one of those weird petri dishes with some kind of hair or dust or
And Sherlock tried to talk to him, get him in the game as he used to. Just like those two years never passed and it was just another boring case after a relaxing chinese leftovers night. And John felt so
And at some point Sherlock gave up. He saw John's fists balling up, the thin layer of sweat covering his upper lip. The little head tilt.
He heads to the bathroom. The kitchen doesn't smell. There are few plates on the clean side of the table and in the sink. Too many plates and too many forks to be used by one person. Too many meals to be meant for one.
«Asperger's.» his palm feels rough on his face as he wipes the sweat off the skin. «Stop wondering, John. Your brain can't possibly take it.»
He's keeping up a cold facade, red rimmed eyes giving away the mess going on behind his lids. But he's successfully shutting up, tongue tied and brain silent. He can do this for John, he can calm down. It's alright. He's fine.
«Sherlock! What's going on? Not agai-Mycroft?» John glares alarmed at the man and then back on his panicking friend. «Sherlock, look at m-»
Brows raised, mouth surprided. Sherlock hands rips away from his, hides behind the wooden desk and forms a fist.
«What the hell was that about? Time for spring cleaning in that Mind Palace of yours? » voice is thick, a bit salty. Grip loosens. Body hesitates, worry is probably making its way through the blue eyes- he won't look at them. Deep blue. Deep deep blue. Deep as water. Deep as a
He is not fine. He doesn't want to die, he is not trying to kill himself and he wants John to know that but
She kind of tried for a whole two months now. But the answer is always the same, an ashamed «Yeah, you're
It's been hours and they are all in the sitting room, cups of tea have been drank, biscuits have been baked from a stressed Mrs Hudson. Sherlock is sleeping, or that's what the silence in the flat suggests.
«The car outside is still warm, it's not the victim's car and the body is wet from the shower.» he starts putting his gloves back. Lestrade is staring at him with an open mouth. «Really, you can't..? Oh, Jesus. Must be so relaxing living with your brain.»
The raw sound of knuckles hitting on bones becomes unbearable for John, his own teeth gritting against each other.
John's shoulders seem blocked in the middle of a deep breath. Straight posture, tight fists, head held up in his military trained way. He bets he is pursing his lips right now.
maybe he misunderstood. And he knew he couldn't trust his own feelings, because he lacked experience. He could not get himself to look John in the eyes, fearing details
«Yeah, yeah! I'm-I'm fine. I'm great. Just- late for work! Work. I have to take a shower.» he turns his head towards the bathroom door, the collar of his shirt revealing more skin of John's neck.
He feels like crawling out of his own skin, breaking the flesh involucre like a newborn butterfly. His fingers are spasming against his biceps, the dirt is accumulating under his nails and he's nowhere close to being a butterfly, he feels like a worm grovelling in a mix of mud and blood and loud noises are making him deaf and smells are burning his nose and he can't help the trashing of his own body
«Sherlock, it's becoming a bit scary now. Will you look at me? Did you take anything?» trained hands make their way to his left wrist, skilled fingers press on his pulse.
He can't stop feeling like this. What is this? He's ashamed. What is this? What is he doing what is he doing
«Sherlock, I know why you're hurting and to be honest I am not sure I want to know further. But I want to help you. Please let me help you.»
Sherlock slowly removes his hand, lifts his head to look at John. He makes to talk, but John's finger is fast to shut him up. «Don't you da-don't you dare contradict me.»
A whimper escapes her thin lips, hand trying to muffle the many sobs threatening to explode. Her hears register the whimpering and loud shaken breathes coming from inside. Her chest hurts.
New jumper, raw fabric. Not his style, the colours clearly don't celebrate his complexion or his hair so
«What's yours?» it's almost a yell. John is standing up, pushing the chair distant from the table and grabbing its edge with shaky hands and white knuckles.
He remembers tortured companions, days and nights spent stitching up friends' arms and lips and broken fingers and ribs and legs and
The muscles in his back loosen a little, a sudden lump melts in his sore throat and a become hot tingling feeling in his burning eyes.
«Hey, look it's just-another time, alright? Tomorrow! Tomorrow I'll stay and we can have a cuppa and a chat, yeah?» he tries, he tries hard to sound as positive as possible.
Mycroft laugh is humorless. He's shaking his head, walking next to John and pointing his umbrella in his brother's face. «You would never tell our mother about your
«Was he alone?» so he'd been at home. He just didn't bother to change clothes. So he didn't need to impress. Dress to impress he says. No date shoes. Is she someone he is comfortable with? Sarah? Sister? Business? Mycroft. He hopes it was Mycroft.
But Sherlock is rolling frantically in his sheets, fingernails scratching at his neck, red marks angry and frantic movements making the detective all but peacefully sleeping. His eyes are closed, shut but are moving convulsively under the thin lids.
«Look, whatever it's going on-No! Shut up a second, as hard as it must be for you.» the policeman is holding up his index, pointing at Sherlock's face. Is he going to say he looks sad? «It's not working, this...this
But Sherlock is here, quite alive- as in breathing and beating- and he still looks like death. His skin is almost transparent, purple bags under his spent eyes, lips tinted in a pale blue. He looks more dead now than laying on the concrete pavement of the walkway under Bart's.
«Sherlock! Jesus Christ, stop. I'm sorry, I know you're not stupid. Calm down.» he grips steadly one of his agitated hands, guides his point finger and middle finger to his own pulse. «See? You're here, I'm here, we're fine. You're fine.» and this time it takes mere seconds for Sherlock to stop his brain from cracking his skull open and run out of the front door.
«You do realise this is not that simple, right? You can't choose who is going to hurt and how your actions will affect everybody's life, Sherlock! It's not how it works. You cann- » deep breath, eyes shut. A low growl scratch the back of his throat.
«I know it's fine.» he knows. He already told him once, at Angelo's. They talked. Why is this necessary? This feels so bad, like a stomach ache. It's nagging, pesky and definitely irritating.
Deep deep blue eyes glare at him in that way he knows he's not in trouble. It's John's way of saying "i hate you but I won't punch you in the face" which is the closest thing to an affection demonstration they share.
But how could he speak if his mouth feels full of chalk? How can he stop moving if his skin feels like stung by a thousands ants crawling underneath.
His hands are furiously shaking in the air, raising to cover his mouth and nose and block whatever is bothering his olfaction.
The crooks of his elbows are tinted in deep blue, purple marks. Half of his forearm is covered with the same kind of bruises, alterning with small circular ones of an angry red tone and yellowish spots. He didn't smoke anymore, but he did throw a full ashtray at the door. Ashes everywhere.
There's a moment of silence. He can almost see the gears in John's head weighing the idea of Sherlock touching food he would put in his mouth and body. He never trusts Sherlock near food. He says he has a weird conception of hygiene. Not true, though. Sherlock is quite obsessed by personal hygiene.
Their steps are temptative, John's shoes soft enough not to make too much noise. In the kitchen there is not a single fresh experiment. There are no eyes, no thumbs, no heads, nothing on the table. There are no dishes in the sink.
«Mycroft what is going on?» his voice trembles. He feels like a moron and the scowling look the Holmes gives him does not help.
Mycroft lets out a tired sigh. It's an unfamiliar sight, the man refusing to directly look at John. His eyes are running along the wood grain of the floor; they're looking for answer in the scattered papers on the ground.
«Sure.» the muscles in his abdomen relax a bit. Is he supposed to react like this? Why is he relieved? Lestrade thinks John's cheating? Was he joking? Why can't Sherlock understand if he's joking?
John is definitely angry. But it's not anger making his hands shake like a balled up napkin thrown over a fireplace. The man can't stand still, fists clenching and unclenching and fingers tapping tapping
Cold green eyes lift from the violin and work their way through the small room to find John's deep deep deep blue eyes. He lowers his gaze after half a second. John frowns. «Please?»
John's heart clench tightly in his chest, his own pulse clear in his ear, drumming loudly. «Sherlock... » he can see droplets of blood and spit landing on the detective's feet. Bile is reaching the back of is throat.
Because it stings a bit, the way John is vomiting his last words on him, balling up his fists with anger. «You haven't talked to me for the whole week, you are not even looking at m-LOOK AT ME SHERLOCK!»
He closes his eyes again, lids heavy and mind dizzy. The sofa isn't even comfortable but he looks so tired. John smiles. «See you later.»
«And what? Stating the truth? Please, John. You are shaking, your hands can't stand still for a moment. Your body is betraying you.» he spits it out like an insult, but his chest hurts because
There's a lifeless body on the concrete right in front of his eyes -blue deep blue blue blue blue- and his brain just can't focus. Man in his forties, sleep deprived, marriage, a sad one if you asked his ring finger. Nails bitten but only on one of his hand, nervous habit and a job that kept his working hand -left, just like john- John
He is listening. Face hidden in the sheets, hands clutching one another and held tight to his aching sternum. They've been talking for the past twenty-seven minutes. Mycroft's been taking long pauses, John's leg hurts.
Of course this is not the first time Sherlock's been out of tits on drugs. But it's confusing and frustrating and infuriating now. Because the reality of things hits him hard in the face and he realises.
«I am not going to tell you how cold it is outside, as i fear you might not give a fuck. I am going to make some tea, if you want some feel free to ask.» and he's turning back and into the kitchen, jumper clutched in one hand.
«I am not asking if you're fine, I am asking what is hurting right now. If you didn't notice, you just threw up blood. You lack a degree, but I am sure you get that it's not a good thing.»
«Sherlock, do you want me to go? I know it's hard, just let me know. Just signs is fine, you don't need to talk.»
His trained hands lay on both sides of Sherlock's face, hot palms over the thin layer of cold sweat.
me, John!» he's trying to make sense, why can't John understand? He is trying so hard, the words just come out wrong. «It protects you!»
but he looks on the side, avoids the detective's face. But Sherlock sees the redness of his eyes, the quivering of his bottom lip. The way he sucks it in and bites down with the front teeth. John doesn't cry. He never cries.
“I SAID, END IT!” She screamed now. Sherlock moved to one side behind her, nearing the front door cautiously as if to cut her off before she could step through the open door but she obviously didn’t plan on leaving soon. John watched him raising his hand and holding it up in the direction of the hallway and he understood. Mrs. Hudson must have heard the screaming young woman and had wanted to see what the fuss was about. He imagined he could actually feel her retreat after being stopped with just one hint by the Consulting Detective. Sherlock’s finger pointed downwards in a repeated motion. Whatever it was he was trying to tell their landlady, John hoped imploringly that she understood.
But Sherlock didn’t bother answering, he just stepped forward towering over the suspect and staring at him intensely.
When the doorbell rang, John barely managed to stop Sherlock from opening the door in his birthday suit. He actually forbade him to leave his room until John would have closed the door again. Surprisingly, Sherlock only said “Yes, John.” and patiently waited until John called him back into the living room. He even had the modesty to wear boxer shorts while they ate.
“Well…” John cleared his throat to buy some time. “The last couple of times I…masturbated…there was this small, round swelling at the root of my…penis. It seemed to grow or deflate in proportion to my…erection.”
The calling of his name was constant and demanding. John braced himself for an awkward conversation when he descended the stairs to face Sherlock’s decline.
“Right.” John awkwardly agreed. He felt as if something was pressing against his skull from the inside as he squeezed Sherlock’s hand for reassurance.
“Stop thinking. Your back is all tense.” The nimble fingers started to manipulate a painful spot right below his pulse point, making John hiss through gritted teeth.
John was watching him with rapt attention, not bothering to hide his obvious enthusiasm. To Sherlock, it was a sight to behold. He had been waiting for John to just finally
“I belong to those 90 per cent but I wouldn’t want a child, anyway. Extinction is our destiny, it seems.” Sherlock said coolly.
Greg had grabbed Sean's right elbow but without Sherlock holding the man by the shoulder's he would have had a hard time supporting the mutants heavy body. John hit him painfully pushing into the small gap to help them place the body on the stretcher. “Oh no! Oh....No!” Mrs. Hudson shrieked behind them.
“I…” The thumb sliding lightly over the bow of the letter J was a welcome distraction to Sherlock but John still held his gaze in expectation of an answer.
Walking into the room with stray droplets of water on his chest and stomach, Sherlock indicated for John to sit up at the foot of the bed.
Sherlock immediately understood. Sitting up, he pulled one hand from John's loose grip and positioned the doctor's cock against his already relaxed opening. Biting his lower lip he sank down trying to handle the abundant sensory influx.
“Alone.” Sherlock mumbled, not actually sure he would be able to stay upright but completely certain that he didn’t want John to help him. Cautiously he forced his spine to stiffen and his knees to tense while he pushed past John. Stumbling, he entered the bathroom and fell back against its door.
birthday she took a walk through the Yellow Fields, daydreaming about the fest she would have liked to have had her father not decided to invite the royalty of the adjacent kingdoms.
That morning, Sherlock had woken up feeling tense and hot. He claimed to be very close to his heat and demanded that John would fetch a weeks’ worth of food and beverage. John had read that it was unlikely that they would leave the flat during Sherlock’s heat. They would be too occupied, so to say.
“No.” Sherlock shook his head weakly and pressed back into the touch. John noticed the other openings on his back beginning to widen slightly and that the one tentacle he had been fiddling with had grown in length and thickness. It made a faint sensation of arousal crawl up his spine. “So, are they mine or yours?” He whispered taking the single step it took to erase the little space left between them.
The living room was deserted when John came down in the evening. With clean clothes and a towel in his arms, he went to the shower. He still felt on edge and the feeling that he had crossed an important border made his movements uncertain and hesitant.
The Yard was as crowded as ever.  People hurried from one office to another while browsing through a stack of paper. Others just watching the fuzz from a comfortable distance. Sherlock and John were probably more familiar with the office than some of the newbies that were so very easy to detect. Panic in their eyes, sweat on their brows and always a coffee in hand that they certainly never drank themselves but had to bring some superior.
And not trying to stop Sherlock from leaving him again. At least as far as he knew. He suspected that he had probably been trying to convince the consulting detective to stay but he couldn't remember what he'd planned to whisper. He didn't have the slightest idea, especially because he could distinctly remember being at an absolute loss when they were shaking hands.
“This is not the end of the world, you know?” He stated dryly, observing the state of their fridge from his usual position on the chair. “Humanity, though.” He added thoughtfully.
Sherlock thrust up again, harder this time, and a satisfied groan forced its way up his throat. He couldn’t resist doing it again. And again.
“Don’t worry. I wouldn’t just do THAT without asking you first.” John said smiling. He came to kneel over Sherlock again where he caught the detective’s attention by generously covering both their cocks with lube. Pulling Sherlock’s arm up from where it lay beside his thigh, John indicated for him to take hold of them. Entwining the fingers around hot flesh, Sherlock marveled at the cosmic fortune that had placed their dominant hands opposite each other.
The widening of Sherlock’s eyes. The surprised huff of breath. A pale, long finger worrying two plush lips. It all told John that Sherlock had recognized the small bulge.
“If you ask so nicely, on the bottom step in front of the door. I only wanted to look if the shop was already open but then I saw the box and brought it in.”
“OK. Assuming that it’s the same what has been going on with you it is probably just a strong flu going around.” Sherlock didn’t even try to hide his irritation this time.
When John crossed the living room to get some clothes from his room, Sherlock lay motionless and stark naked on the couch. The doctor couldn’t stop himself from taking a blanket and placing it over him. Less out of worry for his health then for Mrs. Hudson’s.
look like office workers nowadays. And yes, the wife was killed while he was in a pub with some friends. And yes, she had an affair.
His eyes touches John's figure for half a second and something starts to squeeze tightly his respiratory tract.
When he finally speaks, another mood swing bursts in the conversation with a low, caring tone of voice. «Did you?»
One angry step. He can imagine the soldier's hands balling into fists. A deep breath. «Just- will you clean it? Please, Sherlock. You're not 5 anymore. Clean your mess, you're not the only one to live here.»
It was like life before he met John. A bit less romantically, like life before it stopped being boring.
And when Sherlock appeared with a pricy bottle of champagne in his hands at his table while the biggest mistake of John's life looked at them speechless, he felt like a half-empty saggy old bag carrying socks and dust.
«I believe I miscalculated. He's been so good at keeping this kind of episode at bay for the last years, I didn't think it would be necessary to inform you of their existence.» he is careful in lowering Sherlock in a fetal position on the bed, holding his head with one palm until it rests on the pillow.
«Sherlock, stop. It's all fine.» But it's not fine, is it? There's so much that demands to be studied and touched and tastes and listened to and he just can't
He needs to repeat it quite few times before he's able to say it out loud. «Have you tried to kill yourself?» and Sherlock looks at him baffled, mouth open and shocked.
him; John notices. « but I assure I will not claim my actions as my own if you don't leave this room right now.» but then there it is. His chin trembles slightly, lips pouting for a fraction of a second.
When did he start hitting himself again? He feels warm liquid slowly pervading the crinkles by his left eye, burning slighty the slimy meat of his ocular bulb.
“That I rescheduled your physiotherapy doesn't mean we should skip the massage, as well.” John's brain needed a moment to catch up before he nodded enthusiastically.
A red puddle was forming beneath the strangers left claw while the color was draining rapidly from his face. Just when Greg readied himself to catch him the moment he'd faint, he heard the wheels of a stretcher echoing up the hallway.
John was out there. John, who had had the shock of his live just now with the small glimpse of Sherlock’s mind he’d gotten.
As he entered the room, Sherlock was sitting in his usual chair, Mrs. Phillips opposite him. Her hair was a mess. Her beige jacket creased and worn. John had a hard time imagining her as the strong young woman he’d first seen in her. Now her appearance reminded him of some of the Bakerstreet irregulars. The ones that did almost everything for Sherlock only to feel useful again.
John was staring at the expensive black marble that had become the symbol of everything that was sad and dark in his life.
“Oh no, you won't.” John said. “It might not be aggressive but I will not let you go there and risk your life before we have a general idea what else is in these ruins. This is a not a scientific expedition, it is a reconnaissance mission.”
When Sherlock awoke, he estimated that it had to be 2 am, according to the light that fell through the window and the time of the year. That meant he’d had around 3 hours of sleep. Definitely enough. He felt strangely warm and relaxed during the first few seconds of consciousness but as soon as he noticed an arm around his waist he started to remember the events of the day before and his stress-free state vanished immediately. Tension pooled in his limbs and he felt the need to move. He considered getting dressed and taking a walk through the dubious corners of London. The only thing that held him back was John’s arm resting on his body. Getting up would almost certainly mean that John would wake up and deem it important to “have a talk”. A talk that Sherlock wasn’t prepared to have, at the moment. So, getting up was no possibility and sleep wasn’t even on the agenda in his wound-up condition. Sherlock’s solution was rather obvious, not very creative and much less brave but he was convinced that it was the logical one. He held as still as possible and started to evaluate the data he had gathered the day before.
Suddenly the press of his knot against the Omega’s entrance got more insistent. Sherlock was moving in waves upon him and John watched the muscles in his back flex and tighten. He let his tongue wander over the crook where neck and shoulder met. Gently nibbling he thrust upwards, getting bolder step by step.
“Yeah, right. OK, Martha.” He emphasized uncertainly. Sherlock rolled his eyes but smiled at him nonetheless.
“You know Prince Sebastian, he’s been a guest at our annual ball for 4 years in a row and I found the occasional conversations with him pleasant and intriguing.” Sherlock rolled his eyes at the blatant lie.”However, he came here today to ask for your hand in marriage.”
Soon, he settled into a comfortable rhythm, making small movements to soothe the itch inside of him.
Unsure on how to proceed he fidgeted awkwardly with his hands. “So, um, that’s settled then.” He stated uncomfortably. John lay his head to the side, a thoughtful expression on his face.
Greg sighed and started to walk back to the bunker, his tension palpable. John put his hand on Sherlock's arm to stop him from following.
During the following days, John's mind was blissfully occupied. Not that he didn’t have an immediate idea who the author of this note was, but every time he thought about this new puzzle he felt … alive. He tried to push the last part aside for his sanity’s sake and concentrated on the things he should doubt. There were at least 7 possibilities who the author was but only one he truly believed in. That one option. It gave him hope but scared him, too. John tried to concentrate on the other six options although he didn't have much conviction in any of them. He knew that that small glimmer of hope would destroy him if it was disappointed in the end.
He hadn't wanted a baby. Hadn't wanted a pregnant wife that shot his best friend without batting an eye. And he had been right. Right to leave her and go back to Baker Street. And what had he done? He had taken her back even after going through that damned USB stick only to have her shoot at Sherlock yet again.
head and I can’t enter yours, and that you didn’t know that I had these additional limbs in the first place, they should be mine.” He admitted, bending lower still, ending up almost flush with the table top.
Mrs. Hudson's expressions changed minutely. Her initial shock at seeing what was left of London had been obvious by the tears gathering in her eyes. It made John's guts clench in a way he had rarely encountered. Occasionally he looked at Sherlock, who was sitting opposite her at the small dining table with a face of utter concentration. John didn't know if it was energy-sapping for Sherlock or if he just tried to make her see every detail. Or maybe he was filtering his own impressions to spare her some pain even though John thought that to be unlikely.
Mrs. Hudson, Molly, that Adler woman, Janine… they all had had a different effect on Sherlock. Not to forget the horrid Mary-business.
“You’ve risked both our lives many times without knowing if you’re right.” There was no anger or accusation in John’s voice so Sherlock only held his gaze. “You know him better than anybody else, right?” Sherlock nodded cautiously. “Well…?” The expectant expression was familiar on the Doctor’s face.
“John, I can’t….It’s so hot! My skin feels too tight and…and... The other symptoms are showing, too.”
Behind the counter, Martha was still caring for Sean who was true to Sherlock’s prognosis, much calmer already but still somewhat shaky. With a soft voice she made him eat most of his share after hastily downing her own portion.
He had spent long minutes in his room, dwelling on his mistakes, when he decided to accept his new (old) place in life and went downstairs.
The loud bang from the bathroom prompted John to hurry up the stairs, carefully balancing the tray with sandwiches he had begged Mrs. Hudson to prepare. Of course, there hadn’t been much begging necessary. It had been particularly difficult to convince her of staying downstairs for the rest of the evening, though.
"At least that makes things a bit easier." Greg stated pragmatically and made to free the exit from stones and dirt. The others joined him without hesitation, the prospect of daylight making them fast to react.
“Sherlock! Let me finish! There are a few other questions I want to discuss.” John had raised his voice but there was no rage in it, he just wanted to be heard over Sherlock’s screaming insecurity.
He'd already forgotten about eating in general when the surprisingly affectionate man above him stopped his assault to look into his eyes.
‘A monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose face is a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind.’
“You think?” John arched an eyebrow at that. A gesture closer to Sherlock’s usual demeanor than John’s. It made the consulting detective squirm uncomfortably.
Doctor Rosen bent over his middle and stared intensely before he examined it closer with hands that were far too cold. John looked at the ceiling, counting the small cracks and few spider webs to distract himself.
“Why wouldn’t I be?” He said, turning towards the counter to pack food and supplies. Everybody was staring at him with faces conveying a mixture of worry and concern.
“Here, your laptop.” The Consulting Detective ignored the attempt at humour, handing John what he'd come down for.
“Non, jamais!” Sherlock’s mind was racing to drown out the booming that seemed to be coming from the scaffolding beside him. He didn’t want to know. Didn’t need anyone's pity. Wouldn’t be able to bear pity if it came from John.
Sherlock was out of it for half an hour but, while John was tempted to take a nap, it was just too early for the doctor to rest again so he entertained himself by letting his fingers wander over Sherlock’s back and arse. He made the tentacle retract fully to have more room for his explorations. Now, the mark he had left on Sherlock’s shoulder was standing out harshly against the detective’s pale skin. It made him feel ridiculously proud of himself for claiming the genius that was loudly snoring upon him. He pressed his nose into dark curls and reveled in their softness and smell. With great care, he closed his arms around Sherlock and rolled them over so he was on top of the sleeping man. Sitting back, he regarded the sweaty and sticky body before he decided to get a wet towel to clean them both up.
John felt glued to the sofa. The sound of the TV was a constant presence in their parlor while he attempted to take his mind off of the fact that he had nowhere to go and nowhere to be.
John limped through the seemingly endless rows of tombstones trying to be as fast as possible. He wanted to be done with this. Sooner rather than later.
His plan was simple. He went over to her, seemingly nervous and fidgeting with his coffee. She looked up at him questioningly before she indicated with a short nod that he was invited to sit at her table. He knew what to do. He would tell her about his flat mate. What had happened the other night and why. (Sherlock would tell her that they had been robbed in a dark alley.  He’d leave out that consulting detective bit. Too risky.) Furthermore, he’d say that he was straight but strongly attached to his flat mate. He’d call himself John.
“I am willing to agree.” Sherlock said, smugly. “But next time, we will reverse the roles. I know what you meant to tell me with it. I understood. And you should know that I share the sentiment.”
For some reason, John chose his best jeans and least hideous jumper for their shared breakfast. He knew why, when he saw Sherlock smile at him.
“John. I don’t want to pressure you but….There is only one possibility that would make me want to stay in a shared flat with you and it would only require one bedroom.” John tensed against his chest, his pulse starting to pound against his neck while he tried to pretend that he had not heard Sherlock.
“Of course not!” John assured her. Sherlock had the tendency to state all other possibilities just for the sake of giving the client hope, even though he knew they were a) not true and b) often worse than the truth.
. She didn’t seem to mind his assassination attempts and he admittedly didn’t try very hard. All he wanted was to make her screech again. But it had only worked once, when he had accidentally set her hair on fire while experimenting on a very interesting powder from china.
He failed one and it is written between his shoulder blades. Sorry, John. He tried to apologise to the voice but John got angry, so angry! Sherlock thought he was going to die there, in fucking Serbia, alone if even his Mind Palace's John left him.
«You-Honestly, i thought you were geniuses or something. But the more i know you two the more i doubt it.» he pinches the bridge of his nose, shuts his eyes for few seconds. He looks at the detective's bloody temple. «I need...I need to cure that cut.» and he rushes out of the room leaving a trembling Mrs Hudson behind.
«But there is!» as soon as John's tone raises Sherlock flinches slightly, straightening his back against the back of the chair, pushing himself far from him. «Sherlock, don't shut me off again. You can't just-» he sighs and plops back in his chair.
john's head snaps up towards the door, Mycroft standing there a bit pale, apologetic smile and sad eyes and all of those things he never usually wear on his poker face.
but of course Mycroft knew he'd finish them in 30 minutes round. 30 minutes for a week worth of homeworks, 6 hours of pretending to be studying.
Oh how he wishes John knew. His tongue feels heavy between his teeth, eyes shut so close his whole face hurts from muscle contraction. His hands can't leave the hair, they are gripping hard as if it's the only safe way to stay anchored to reality. Sanity. His hands are holding together his mind, his mental health and the walls of his Mind Palace.
. You never did, it's always been me, the bad brother that has to tell his parents their son's recovered
He needs to stop thinking about the marks on John's body. That's it. Or the way he massaged his aching legs. Or how tired he looked.
«I have not. I now would really appreciate if you'd leave me to my work.» and he really tries to lift the laptop open again, but John's hands are pushing down hard enough to probably ruin the screen.
Cups, spoons cluttering in the sink, ungraceful words escaping thin tense lips. «Shit, fuck...Oh, Sherlock! Hi, hello!» nervous.
«Yeah, but just to remind you I actually have a job. I am a doctor, people need me. I can't just skip a day.» Slightly hurried tone, he'd love to stay home. Previous night performance tired him out.
«Jesus Christ...» a deep sigh. Mommy often said that when he gets like this. When he used to, anyway. But this is not his mother voice nor his mother hands and there's something reassuring yet alarmingly controlling in the way his hair is being lightly stroked.
So, turns out he isn't supposed to feel relieved if someone thinks him and John are in a relationship. Internet says so. Mycroft too.
His wrong conclusions hurt John the most. Hurt him with the weight of a gun pressed coldly between the doctor's tongue and the soft roof of his mouth. Like an empty bottle crushed on the floor and drunk steps walking over the sharp glass.
«I am going to touch your hands, alright?» and he feels rough hands gently grasping his lightly wet ones.
Sherlock hears the blood pumping in his temples. «John. I know your life was taking another turn but-no, please let me talk. He won't let anyone in. I am begging you to be the friend he needs.»
A pause. He scratches his forehead, misures the weight of his words. He wants to rip his scalp apart and leave the room permanently, bleeding all over the kitchen floor.
» and he feels like his palm will burn if he doesn't remove it from over John's hand but somehow he can't because
«Right...» chair's legs grinds against the floor, he sits. «Listen, I just want to get this off my chest, »
am i supposed to behave in a situation like this?» he manages to keep his voice low, but the anger linger between the words.
«Don't try to stop his hands like that, you'll end up beaten again. He can't control it, you want to block his arms completely next time.» the doctor's words, when they brought young Mycroft to the E&A with a black eye.
He searches John's gaze but he can't quite hold it, his own eyes running away furiously every time they meet deep blue. All that comes out of his mouth is a srangled noise.
Mycroft is holding him, fingers digging in his skin like burning sticks between his ribs. He sees the corner of the kitchen table, rest of the room dipped in black. Things clink knocking over each other, recipients rolling off the table and shattering on the floor. He tries to reach out, but his movements are slow and delayed and his hands reaches for a glass that's already shards.
locked room. There's a small windows on the door now, glass dirty with dust he can't clean. He can't look inside. It's driving him crazy.
John eyes carefully Sherlock standing few metres from the two of them, crouching over the dead body of a man, hands flying swiftly over damp clothes and bloody cuts.
Maybe now he is a bit sad. A lot is wrong with him, Mycroft never fails to remind him. He's not actually sure if he cares or not, but it's not the main problem right now.
Restless. His limbs can't stop trashing. Eyes shut, crinkles between his brows and around his eyes. Fingers tugging curls, hair pulling to the point of popping vessesl under the thick skin of his skull.
If both eyes and ears are closed, something is for sure going to tickle his nostrils, maybe the same perfume on two different persons or the strong scents of deodorant or the way Anderson and Donovan too often smell alike.
«Why, I want to know why on heart you left him getting in trouble like that. » his hands shakes, he fists them up to refrain from hitting something. Someone. Anger is something he still finds hard to manage. «Tell me Mycroft, for the love of god,
«Thank you for telling me. I am sorry, you're fine now.» He misses John pained face, but clearly detects the hurt in his voice. He feels the hands starting to ache from the spasm, a thin coat of something -blood?- cracking with every gesture. «What did I do» he's slurring out words, tongue tired.
he was trying to avoid. And his steps grew faster to keep distance between them, observations became silent and private and suddenly
But he knew what Sherlock wanted and this want flooded him through their shared bond in a way that soon made him forget whose need was more urgent. He steered the spine tentacle outwards and made sure that it dragged excruciatingly slow down between Sherlock's cheeks and over his entrance. It was slick. It always was right after leaving his lover's back.
He watched him getting on the bed and coming to kneel between his legs. Distractedly, John let his clothes fall beside the bed. Sherlock let his hands slide up and down his thighs, getting closer to John’s cock with every upwards move. Slowly, John felt himself harden at the prospect of Sherlock’s action. When the man between his legs leant forward, never breaking their eye contact and biting his lips out of insecurity, John felt his cock twitch at the sight.
The other found it's way around the lean back while John was filled with relief and elation. And pride. So much pride at finally having found the strength to be true to himself and the world.
“But I controlled them.” John established while winding his left arm around Sherlock’s torso and pulling him up. Slowly, he turned him around to look up into his eyes.
“John, I can’t stop. If I stop it feels like… I tried but it… it hurts. I need you. Please, help me!” The Omega looked pleading into his eyes. John grabbed his wrist and pulled the hand away from Sherlock’s cock.
he was unable to get in a bad mood. He was too busy reveling in the feelings towards one mad consulting detective. Strangely, he wasn’t afraid or anxious; he only felt relief, having finally found out what it was that always drew him back to 221 b even after the worst fight.
“Forget him. You’ll never see him again, anyway.” The maniac answered with an evil and too wide smile.
Sherlock watched him as he positioned himself and pressed the tip of his cock against the widened entrance.
“I… It’s no use denying it, right?” John said, somehow managing to sound defeated and annoyed at the same time.
Sherlock observed the doctor’s dilated pupils and flushed face before he rested his hands on his hips. He felt John’s touch on his ribcage, the elated pulse being transferred onto his skin.
“Never. It was an accident.” Sherlock said in a soft tone. The doctor resumed his explorations on Sherlock’s back with gentle pressure against the mouth-like openings.
She pulled a crumpled pack of tissues from her leather purse in a vain attempt to wipe them away. Her wedding ring sparkled in the evening light that fell through the closest window.
“Brilliant, John!” Sherlock murmured into John’s ear as he crowded close and began to suck a bruise into the doctor’s pulse point.
His senses were alight with the knowledge of semi-erect flesh slightly pressing against his backside.
When Sherlock opened his eyes they had come to a halt. The carriage had stopped in a thick forest, in front of a small hut that was even more chipped than their transport. Sherlock looked around himself, scanning the area but seeing nothing except for trees and heavy brushwood. Prince James’ men immediately began to laugh upon seeing his wandering glance. Their voices sounded rough and nasty. James still refused to say what he meant to do with Sherlock, now that he had tricked him into following him. He turned an evil grin at Sherlock.
A loud scream prompted him to hurry. Sherlock reached the edge simultaneously to join him as he stared into the darkness. Even with the night-vision on, John couldn't see anything. They listened intensely but it still took them a few seconds to realize that there was a third accelerated respiration somewhere beneath them and that it was quickly coming closer.
Pulling Sherlock by his arm, John drew the man in a tight embrace while beginning to rock up into the tight heat.
The meandering limbs on Sherlock's back were extracting fully now, moving into different directions to press against walls, ceiling and the concrete floor. Carefully, John took hold of Sherlock's wrists bringing them together in one hand before he held them above his head. Not for the first time he felt amazement at the sight of the incomprehensibly long tentacles.
“Now.” Sherlock stated loudly while putting his shirt back on. The next thing John knew was that Lestrade had the woman in handcuffs. While he was marveling at the fact that it had been  the DI on the stairs all along, he remembered that he should probably pull his jumper back on to hide the apparently invisible gun that was pressing distinctly into his back from the coppa's eyes.
“Come in.” Sherlock was still fully clothed and felt a bit awkward now that John opened the door and peeked in, cautiously. He watched as John, wearing pajama pants and an old shirt, took in his appearance and stepped in front of the bed.
“SHERLOCK? WHAT THE BLOODY HELL IS THAT?” John yelled, at the top of his voice. The high-pitched sound filling his head was deafening and bordering on painful. It made his eyes water as he rolled out of bed and dressed hurriedly, Sherlock following his example.
“Not with somebody else.” Sherlock answered between moans. His head was resting on the cushion now as he tried not to look at John pressing his finger in and out in a steady rhythm. When the doctor carefully added a second finger, he pressed back against the moving digits. He knew the burn the stretch caused. He welcomed it. When he indulged on his own like that, he rarely had the patience to let his body get used to it.
It was ridiculously easy to determine the origin of the man who’d helped him flee. Judging by the mud under his shoes and the Nodding Suns that were stuck in it, a rare kind of flower that moved its blossoms towards any available source of light and therefore looked as if it vehemently agreed to bright sunshine, the man had walked through the Yellow Fields at the border to the Watson Territory.
Calming down, Sherlock sat on his bed and contemplated the possible outcome of their situation. Of course, there were several but only one he hoped for and one he was horribly afraid of. It was unusual how hard it was to chose the next course of action. He couldn’t discern between a logical result of a hypothetical act or plain wishful thinking. The only thing he could do was to wait for John to present new data.
Not as long as you don’t tell me a bit more about it. Don’t you think I might have a say if you just move out leaving me pay the full rent?” John wasn’t interested in that damn rent but he needed a valid argument to get Sherlock to talk to him or at least stay a bit longer if not forever.
“Safe?” The man grimaced fiercely. “ I haven't been...” He tried to finish when his eyes rolled upwards and his body collapsed as if every single muscle suddenly refused to cooperate.
He stood in the middle of the dark parlour staring ahead without seeing anything. His mind replaying their conversation again and again. It took him 12 minutes to admit to himself that the results weren’t conclusive. He was fairly sure that it would have been acceptable to follow John upstairs but the small doubt in the back of his mind, that hadn’t anything to do with insecurity, held him back.
“Don’t move.” Sherlock whispered. He still felt nervous and out of his depth. This was very much not his area so the only thing he could possibly do was to improvise. And maybe try out one or two of his rarely indulged fantasies.
Watching himself in the mirror, he undressed unhurriedly. When he was down to his pants he observed the way John’s initials peeked out between his legs and were partially hidden by his underwear. They still made him feel a sense of rightness. Somehow more complete than a week ago. More… just more.
Mindful of the sensitive and irritated skin on Sherlock’s hip, John helplessly held on to the taller man’s waist whose lips had just parted and moved against his. Cautiously, the doctor pulled the lithe body closer, wanting to feel all of it at once and deepening the kiss by adding just small touches of his tongue to a full lower lip. When a shudder ran down Sherlock’s spine, John felt it in his fingertips, hands and arms, as if his body was trying to drink in responses and make them it’s own.
«Doctor Watson, I am afraid you're missing an important part of my little brother's life. He didn't go on a vacation.» his voice hints a bit of irony, but his face is dead serious.
«Just, shut up. You-» he groans and breathes in, chuckles darkly, hands on hips. «You don't get to do this. Not now. Not to me, not to yourself.»
Sherlock took morphine and cocaine. He craved the edginess, he craved the blood pumping angrily in his veins. And then numbed the pain of withdrawal with morphine, lowering his blood rate with the promptness of a vigilant blocking a racing car at a red light.
He needs to remind himself that his friend is recovering, that he is obviously in an altered state and that it would be extremely wrong to punch him.
«You should ignore it unless it's him to approach the subject.» he lifts one hand in John's direction as he tries to answer, «
She bought him coffee every morning, a cup gone cold always waiting for him in his office, on the desk. Every week he could taste a bit more sugar, an added spoon of sugar Mary slipped in it afraid the doctor was not eating enough.
His anger is not coming out. His posture is calm and relaxed. His actions natural and quiet. «John.»
John fights against the impulse to strangle him. «Of course I do. But you let him fake his own death and
«Molly, your incoherent words are laying eggs in my brain. Please do shut up.» that might has come out of his mouth a bit too harsh, she flinches slightly at the sharp consonant.
This is tiring. It feels like breathing water. Licking mud from the corners of the basement because it was all he could get in there. He wishes he could just tell John.
What a hypocrite he would be, telling his best friend to stop using when he can't stop filling glasses and emptying bottles.
And he would put the plates in the sink to wash them in the morning and every morning, when she woke up at 6:00 o'clock, 30 minutes just before him, there was always one more glass in the pile of dirty dishes.
John Watson being the most oblivious man on planet heart, standing next to the most outraged detective of London. «He what? Have you gone mad, mate?»
Deep sigh, eyes closed, fingers pinch the bridge of his nose. «Sorry, I am...sorry.» John remembers last time he shouted and the way Sherlock flinched and shut down. «Look, don't worry. I just wanted to know, because you're my friend and I thought you liked my girlfriend and Lestrade- »
Sherlock spent two years around the world, trying to stay away from London. He tried hard, he's been to the point of crying in frustration because no matter where he was, he would always find himself at an airport, fighting the need to change the destination of his ticket.
Everybody notices. Mrs Hudson gives them strange looks, half tilted smile worrying her face. Lestrade keeps gazing between them, back and forth, trying to define WHY Sherlock thinks the floor is more important than the soldier's face and the walls behind his blond head are so damn interesting.
Was that a joke? Is he angry? Does John think he isn't capable of doing such a stupid thing as conserving milk? He's a genius. Of course he knows milk needs to go into the fridge or it'll waste.
He met Mary at the surgery. She's a nurse. She was great, kindness irradiating from her open smile, big eyes welcoming patients as soon as they stepped in the waiting room.
Please please please leave a comment, i want and need to know what you think about my writing! Doesn't have to be a positive comment ahah i love a good creative critique.
His past two years keeps playing in the back of his head, stinging sharply and making his eyes well up with anger.
The older Holmes' creepy laugh sounds louder in the room one more time before dying in a sad chuckle. «Brother mine, we both know how unlikely it is for you to quit using. You struggle with cigarettes, I am very sorry to remind you. I won't let it happen again, Sherlock. Not like the la-»
The Detective Inspector rubs one finger on his brows, furrowed. «It's...it's about Sherlock.» his words are not sure and his tone is thin and an awkward pause separates his next rambling mess. «Look I know we are not that close to be discussing this but I don't think he's fine. Is he using again? Have you seen how thin he got for god's sake he is so pale i mean-» he cuts himself off scratching his neck and puffing out air and frustration.
One harsh hand shut the laptop closed right on his fingers, it takes him a few mooments before he starts feeling the burning. He lifts his head.
Stop. It's ridiculous. The fog is turning in small crystallised shards of ice. The shards are tickling his skull and brain.
«Whatever. Arrest the neighbor.» Do they have milk at he flat? Did John need it? He would grab some at the Tesco when he'd go back home.
» and saying so Mycroft pushes him back and goes over to sit beside the whimpering man, sobs so loud they imprint in John's brain.
«Oh god, hush. It's alright Sherlock, there's nothing to be sorry about. It's okay.» John's voice is in full doctor mode. Sherlock ears are starting to recover. His eyes are no longer shut tight, more likely closed as if he were asleep. Betraying tears are making their fast way out.
