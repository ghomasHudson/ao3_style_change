There were many times John wanted to give in and tell Sherlock that he desperately wanted to go to bed with him, such as every time Sherlock rolled his head around to stretch out his neck muscles and John felt a vampiric urge to bite red marks into that alabaster flesh.  But he kept his mouth shut and let their friendship grow.
the one having one night stands all the time, it would have been stupid of me to assume I’d get more than that. Even though I really,
John shook his head, smiling.  “I see what you’re saying, but there’s nothing to worry about.  We’ve past the point of friendship.  We’re together.”  Greg’s expression turned incredulous, then he groaned and turned away.  “No, really.  Sherlock is my boyfriend now.”
John waved his hand, he couldn’t let Sherlock trip into his mind palace right now.  “No, no.  Think about that later.  I’m not talking about the uniform, I’m talking about the fetish part.  A military kink.  Your words reminded me of something I hadn’t thought about in over 2 years.”
Sherlock blinked.  Then he blinked again.  “You’re giving me flowers?” He gazed at John with wide eyes.
Sherlock’s eyes flicked over John before levelling an incredulous look at Anderson.  “Good lord, you’re offering him up like a virginal sacrifice.”  John couldn’t help a tiny flinch at the word
The next few weeks flew by with studies and training, a couple more rugby matches and a couple more parties hosted at various places.  John continued to see Sherlock in the stands and at the parties, though they didn’t interact.  John tended to stick by Molly’s side and then ducked out once the crowd got drunk enough to start making horny advances.  He didn’t see Sherlock in the lab, though he himself was constantly there playing catch up.
The jealousy, though – that wasn’t as easily dismissed.  Every single person Sherlock danced with had John squirming in his seat - especially the three men.  Had he slept with any of them?  The way he moved with them, touched them, the look of intensity on his face…John knew it was an act, but how could they resist him? They were all good-looking blokes.  Sherlock didn’t only go for rugby players, surely he must fancy dancers…as fit as they were.  John felt an odd flush of dismay and arousal at the last bloke, who kept touching Sherlock over and over.  And Sherlock was starting to sweat from the exertion of the dance.  None of it was sexual, but John had that same reaction nonetheless.
Irene turned to Molly and gave her a reproachful look.  “You haven’t told John about my Instagram?  You know I’m trying to get more followers.”
They hadn’t even really talked. Just acknowledged their sexual frustration and then went at it in a haze of lust.  John didn’t even know what Sherlock wanted beyond this moment.  What if he didn’t want anything?  If this was to be their one time together, John was deeply disappointed that it hadn’t involved more.  A bed, time to explore each other, to be penetrated in the most intimate way possible.  John craved that from Sherlock, and now he might not get it.
Sherlock leaned back against the cabinet, sighing with relief, and John began to feel a prickle of something dangerous.  Part of him wanted to yank his fingers back from their caress of Sherlock’s calf muscles, but the rugby captain and future doctor in him refused such a notion and waited until he was sure the cramp wouldn’t come back.
John cleared his throat.  “I suppose you’re right, but for now I’m a bit focused on the basics.  I can’t stop thinking about you fucking me.”
demisexual.  You’re only attracted to someone you’ve fallen in love with.  I could tell by the way you looked at me.  Like you were admiring a work of art, but not one that you wanted to fuck.”
Irene gave him a pleased smile.  “It was Lizzo’s idea, she tweeted a request for a ballet routine to ‘Truth Hurts,’ and I knew my moment had come.  It’s getting a lot of attention since I responded to her tweet with the link to the video.  Of course, Sherlock’s been getting a lot of attention as well, and he’s quite irritated by it.  That’s what we were laughing about when you came in, he’s been responding to some of the comments.”
To distract from his self-consciousness, he returned the favour and removed Sherlock’s shirt.  He bit his lip as his eyes roved over Sherlock’s bared torso.  “The first time I ever saw you, on Instagram, you weren’t wearing a shirt.  Just a pair of tights, and Christ you were magnificent.  But damned if that tiny screen didn’t do you justice.”  He put a tentative palm on Sherlock’s chest, then slid it up to his shoulder and then down his arm, marveling at the silky feel of his skin.
John sighed, knowing it was a waste of time to deflect.  “It’s nothing.  Just a bit weird sometimes.  I feel like I’m in the presence of a celebrity or something.  But like, the way I see you isn’t the same as how they see you and it’s…jarring I guess.”
John snorted.  “Would have been a disaster.” He adopted an imperious look.  “Sherlock, I want you to look at Molly like you want to tear her clothes off.  Sherlock!  Stop looking at Molly like you want to eat her!”
knowing him like Molly had.  She had a way of seeing right through to the heart of things – she was like that with everyone.  Even after he confessed his feelings for her and she gently explained that she didn’t like boys that way, they didn’t stay awkward around each other for long.  They were able to settle back into their friendship and it remained that way until graduation.  They parted on very good terms when they went off to university - Molly to London and John to Edinburgh.
He was so busy concentrating on regulating his own reaction, that it took him longer to notice that Sherlock’s breathing wasn’t steady, and the fingers running through his hair trembled slightly.  When the realisation hit him, John was compelled to look up.  Sherlock’s face quickly shuttered into a mask of professionalism, but not before John saw the heat of desire in his eyes.
John sucked in a shuddering breath and grasped Sherlock’s cock.  Sherlock’s breath hitched and his forehead came down onto John’s shoulder.  Encouraged, John caressed him lightly, up and down.  He tried variations on grip and stroke to see what Sherlock might like.  He tilted his head to Sherlock’s exposed neck and began nibbling and kissing.  He was so intent on his task, reveling in the sound of Sherlock panting his name in his ear that he barely noticed that Sherlock’s grip on his own cock was faltering.  When he brought up his other hand to stroke his thumb across Sherlock’s hardened nipple, Sherlock’s head snapped up and he stopped John’s hand.  “Christ, John!”
She gave him a secretive smile.  “She hasn’t told me yet, though I do have some suspicions.  I don’t want to say anything to jinx it!  John, she said it involved you as well, do you mind sticking around?”
John stepped forward until he was in Sherlock’s personal space.  “Because they wouldn’t have been mine, right?  Tell me something, Sherlock.  How exactly did you use the red pants and the tags?  Did you wear them, or did you wank over them?”
Irene hummed skeptically.  “Well, it’s true in Sherlock’s case.  He’s utter shite at dancing the day after sex.  But for months now he’s been at peak performance.  When
Molly gave her a quelling look.  “Yes, and if you’re going to ogle John like he’s in a zoo, the least you can do is help him move in.”  Irene looked away in a huff and Molly giggled.  “Come on, let’s get that over with now, so John can find a more permanent spot for his car.  Last thing he needs his first day here is to get a ticket.”
The other players laughed uproariously, and more than a few looked envious.  John shook his head and laughed.  “Did you just make a scoring joke?  We’re not bloody sixteen anymore, come up with something original.  And whilst you’re at it, you all worry about your own cocks.
Having caught on, Molly rolled her eyes and then melted away into the crowd.  John cleared his throat.  “I know about you as well.  I’ve seen your Instagram.  The science of deduction.  You like to deduce things.  You say you can tell a software engineering major by his tie, or some such.”  He gave him a comical expression of disbelief.
“You didn’t want to encourage me.”  Sherlock’s expression was now taunting and he leaned forward with his arms on the table.  “You thought if you followed me on Instagram, I would interpret it as a more personal interest.”  John looked away, feeling exposed and annoyed because he had every right to protect himself from unwanted attention.
John rubbed the back of his neck.  “It was probably the most humiliating experience of my life.  We got into her bedroom and started making out, and I couldn’t get it up.  I felt really uncomfortable.  She was all over me and all I wanted to do was push her away.  She finally asked me if I was gay, and I feel like I should have lied and told her I was.  I told her no, I don’t want to have sex with boys either.  She concluded I was asexual and pretended to understand, but she dumped me pretty quickly after that.  I heard she achieved her all important goal not even a week later with some bloke named David.
Sherlock murmured in his ear.  “We should get out of here before someone finds us.  Irene put up a sign before the shoot, but she might have taken it down.”
.  Someone who is that determined to think they’re unloveable might react badly to being told otherwise.  In such a case, maybe it’s best to leave him to it.”
Greg glared at him for a moment, then his shoulders drooped.  “Christ, I’m a mess.  This is Sherlock we’re talking about, he has zero interest in women.  He was probably inwardly vomiting the whole time.”  They both laughed weakly.
John shook his head.  “I figured she was right, I was asexual.  And then um…”  He cleared his throat.  ‘Molly came along and we became friends…”
John swallowed the wrong way and suffered a coughing fit for a minute.  “Where the hell did that come from?  Just because I feel sorry for the guy?”
A few years ago I was listening to the song ‘I Want You To Want Me’ and thinking to myself that the words were so full of longing and it was almost jarring with such an upbeat tempo. I wondered if someone had done a slowed down version to it, and found this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1TgnXu_Ak
I wasn't able to find ballet videos using the regular version of You're The One That I Want, but this has some good moves. I like the one that starts at 8:05, tie-die dude can get it:
John knew a little bit about Irene’s process from the handful of blooper videos she posted.  For instance, he knew that there were often multiple takes, especially if an error was made.  The same moments were often shot from different angles.  Some of those angles were rather intrusive.  It wasn’t something that John had ever thought about much until he was participating in these activities.  He wouldn’t really mind if it weren’t for the fact that it involved being in close proximity to Sherlock for endless periods of time.
Sherlock looked down and swallowed.  “I don’t even know anymore.  I always make sure the other bloke is having a good time because then I’ll get to have my way with them.  I don’t really have much experience with someone trying to make
John pulled out his mobile and looked up her username.  Clicking on her profile, he saw that she was calling herself a Choreography Dominatrix and her tagline was ‘I like to order people.’ About half a dozen videos were posted, the thumbnails indicating various people dancing.  He tapped on the latest one, which featured a rather gorgeous man with tousled black curls in nothing but dark purple tights dancing to Lizzo’s ‘Truth Hurts.’  The caption read, ‘Why men great til they gotta be great? @thescienceofdeduction.’  John assumed it was the dancer’s profile, though it was an odd sort of username for a ballet dancer.  John resisted the urge to click on the profile out of curiosity, and watched the video instead, impressed by the man’s talent.  His features were haughty, but every so often he’d smirk at the camera, usually during one of Lizzo’s more cheeky lyrics. The choreography was an interesting combination of ballet and twerking. John imagined Irene’s intent was to showcase the man’s amazing arse.  John found himself watching the video a couple of times.
John meandered through the tiny aisles of the shop looking for tea.  When he rounded the corner, he saw Sherlock eyeing the Valentine’s Day display.  When Sherlock saw him, he turned slightly towards a shelf lined with jars of baby food.  John went up to him and raised his eyebrows.  Sherlock muttered, “Experiment,” and tossed one of the tiny jars into John’s shopping basket.
John chuckled at Irene’s overt possessiveness.  “I did sort of start to think I was demi after what happened with Molly, but I couldn’t be sure. It might have been an isolated incident, like maybe I was greysexual.  As you can see, I did a lot of research.  I knew for sure I was demi after…after James.  And as I said, we’re not talking about
Molly’s lip wobbled.  “Oh, John.”  She came up behind him and wrapped her arms around his shoulders.
When he came back from the loo to tell them he was leaving, he was surprised to see Sherlock had taken his spot.  Moriarty was nowhere to be seen.  Sally was gone too, so John sat down in her former spot, feeling bemused.  As he got settled, Molly chose that moment to vacate Irene’s lap, mumbling that she needed the loo herself.
John must have been in a dazed state, because he barely registered being turned over again.  It was the sharp sound of the lube cap being opened that had him blinking into awareness.  Sherlock had found the bottle he’d set on the bedside table.  He watched as Sherlock coated his fingers.  Sherlock gave him an affectionate smile.  “As much as I enjoy rimming, I don’t feel it quite does the job.  Certainly not for someone who has never been penetrated before.”  John was about to correct him, but Sherlock shook his head.  “Your own fingers don’t count.  I’d say this is quite a bit larger, don’t you think?”  He took hold of his cock, stroking it, and John whimpered in need.
Sherlock shook his head vehemently.  “I’ve never…the way you were so focused on me…  I-I’m supposed to be the one making things good for you.”
John erupted into laughter, bending over in an effort to contain it.  “And what do you deduce about me at this moment?”
, John fiercely told himself, maybe he’d always been attracted to John, but his dedication to his work meant that he preferred to take care if it alone.  There was no guarantee that if John propositioned him again more recently, he would have gotten a different answer.
John pulled the dog tags out of his pocket and held them up.  Sherlock stared at them in dismay.  “I…I’d wondered what became of the box.”
They were both slick with sweat, and John had never felt more alive as Sherlock kissed him one last time, a messy sliding of lips together as John finally tipped over the edge, his orgasm wringing a groan from him that must have sounded obscene if anyone else heard it.  Sherlock whined as John’s muscles contracted around him, and then he was coming too.  John could feel Sherlock spilling into him and his own cock gave another twitch at the sensation.  “John,” Sherlock breathed into his ear, his voice wrecked.
During the last dance, as Sherlock leapt and pirouetted and gambolled in a carefree manner, John’s realisation of this was the worst feeling yet to process.  It was a message loud and clear that no matter what feelings were growing in John’s heart, he couldn’t act on it.  He would want Sherlock for his own, want to keep him, and that was never going to happen.  Alone was Sherlock’s preferred state.
Sherlock caught on quickly.  “Ah yes, I haven’t done this in a long time.  This will do nicely.”  Sherlock wrapped his long fingers around their two cocks and began to slide up and down.  John’s mouth dropped open at how amazing it felt.  They resumed kissing as Sherlock stroked them.  Sherlock kept murmuring John’s name against his lips.
“I suppose we should stop nattering on and focus on the task at hand.”  John nodded his head rapidly in agreement.  His heart was pounding, and he wasn’t entirely sure it was due to the near miss.
John saw Greg go up to Sally and lift her up to twirl her around, then presented her with a lovely bouquet of orange tropical flowers.  Someone must have been holding Irene and Molly’s bouquets, because they materialised in their hands.  Irene gave Molly pink daisies and Molly gave Irene blood red roses.  John took a deep breath and looked around until he saw Sherlock, who was talking to Dimmock.  John wasn’t surprised
Molly smiled sadly.  “I want Sherlock to be happy, too.  But sometimes people won’t let themselves be.  When given the chance, they double down and refuse to accept it.  Do you know what I heard him call himself once?  A highly functioning sociopath.”  John’s eyes widened in incredulity.  “
For dinner, John recreated the dishes they ate when they had their first proper date at Angelo’s.  For dessert John presented him with a box of chocolate honey truffles.  They sat by the fire with glasses of red wine, feeding each other the chocolates.
Irene huffed.  “Molly, I need the word to get out.  This isn’t just a hobby, it’s my future profession.”  She turned to John.  “Would you please do me the favour of following my Instagram?  It’s @thewhiphand.  And if you wouldn’t mind, please like all my videos.”
Sherlock colored.  Lifting his chin, he said in a cool tone, “As it turns out, the store had the exact same kind in stock.  But it really wasn’t the same, was it?  I didn’t get them.”
Sherlock kissed his neck as he moved his hips back slightly and then pressed forward.  John gusted out a breath at the exquisite friction.  Sherlock repeated the action, over and over, his pace slow as he got John used to the sensation.  John wrapped his legs around Sherlock’s hips.
a big deal.  Sherlock is not the type to have friends.  He can get along with people when he needs to, but no one who seems to want to spend time with him the way you two have been doing these past months.  I was really glad to see someone get over that wall he puts up.  And now you’ve gone and ruined it with sex.”
If she didn’t know the answer to that, then Molly hadn’t told her everything, and for that he was grateful.  “There was one other person.  A bloke at Loudain.  But…um…that didn’t work out.”  He cleared his throat, his expression grim.  Molly bit her lip, her eyes full of compassion.  She knew all about James Sholto, and John’s humiliating attempt to get with him.
As they watched, Sherlock threw up his hands and stormed off.  Irene came back over to the sofa, looking like a cat that just swiped some cream.  She sat down on Molly’s other side and gave her a sloppy kiss on the cheek.  “Hello my love, glad to see you’re not passed out yet.”
John squared his shoulders.  This was just as good a place as any to start.  “This isn’t about the case, per se, but something you said during it.  When it first came up, your theory was that it was a uniform fetishist.”
John tugged Sherlock forward, wanting to feel his lips again.  They kissed and kissed, and then John pulled back to stare down at the magical things Sherlock was doing to his cock.  He could also see where Sherlock’s was straining against his sweatpants, and prickling heat washed over him at the thought of Sherlock
When Irene finally came in (Molly had long since given her a key to the flat), she was practically vibrating from excitement.  “I’m sure Molly suspects what I have to tell you.  The Instagram videos I’ve been doing have caught the attention of Bohemia Studios.  They are a
Sherlock groaned and slid down under the duvet, pulling it over his head.  Clearly he was embarrassed by all the sentimentality.  John dived under the covers after him.  In the dim light he could see Sherlock had his eyes shut and his face scrunched up.  John giggled and gave him a kiss on the cheek.  “I agree, breakfast can wait.  I know of something else I want to devour first.”
John laughed.  “Mustn’t forget the gear.”  He was frankly glad of the opportunity to do some grunt work to clear his head.
When John entered the building and keyed in the code to enter the lab, he was startled to find it already occupied.  Even more disconcerting was when the other person turned his way and he saw that it was Sherlock Holmes.  “Oh!  Hello.”
Bill gave him a troubled look. “Are you telling me that’s how he finally got you into bed?  Sold you a cock and bull story about being boyfriends?  Who the fuck does he think he is?”
Sherlock let go of his cock to stroke his hand up John’s flank.  “You have me, John.  I’m here.  I promise I’ll make it good for you.”  He maneuvered over John until he was resting between his thighs, grabbing the bottle of lube and applying a generous amount to his cock.  He lowered his hips, sliding his cock along John’s.  “Fuck, I can’t believe this is happening.  This is so different, John.  It’s nothing like with anyone else.  I feel like…”  He shook his head as if he couldn’t put it into words.
John went over to him and squeezed his shoulder, moving his hand up to tangle in Sherlock’s greying curls.  “I could tell.  You don’t carry that same stiffness in your shoulders.  It suits you.”
As Sherlock drove the short distance back to their little cottage, John stared in contented silence out the window.  Though Sherlock was also silent, John could almost hear the thoughts churning inside his head as he tried to decide whether to fess up.  John could have placed a bet and won on how long it would take before Sherlock blurted out, “Alright,
Sherlock suddenly tackled him, pressing their lips together in a kiss burning with emotion.  John circled his arms around Sherlock’s torso in a fierce hug, holding him tightly.  He decided blowjobs and breakfast could wait as they cherished this absolutely perfect moment together.
“John, you’ll come to our recital, won’t you?”  He looked up from his mobile to see Molly gazing at him hopefully.
He supposed he was concerned about how they’d changed.  Because of course they had.  It was inevitable when moving on to a new phase of life.  New location, new home, new friends, new everything.  Would they still be able to connect as they had?
John shrugged.  “I have a fairly active libido, so I wank when the urge strikes.  And yes I can get off to porn.  I do notice that…”  He blushed and bit his lip. “…well, I usually prefer to watch stuff where it looks intimate, and they’re really into each other.  I don’t like the ones with acrobatic positions and weird angles, it makes it too obvious they’re putting on a show.  I like it when it looks like…um…a couple.”  He cleared his throat.  “Uh…any more questions?” He sincerely hoped not, he felt as red as a ripe tomato.
John burst into giggles, shaking his head.  “Why do I somehow find that more flattering than if you’d propositioned me for sex?”
.  I admit I don’t think Valentine’s Day is as rubbish as I’ve made it out to be all these years.” He jerked the wheel slightly too hard as he turned into the drive.
Greg glared.  “It’s a bit more than talking.  Saturday night you were standing close to her, touching her, gave her a hug on three separate occasions. She was trying to be polite, but it was getting weird.”
John let out a happy sigh.  “Sherlock, hearing you say these things…it means everything to me.  I can hardly believe it’s happening.”  He leaned up and captured Sherlock’s lips.  “You say you want things with me.  I want things, too.  And I don’t want to scare you, but I feel like we should stop hiding and just lay it all out there.  As you said…I
They did the take several times, and each time John had to be wetted down again. To his relief, Molly was the one to take on this duty.  If Sherlock were to continue touching him, he wouldn’t be able to keep his cock under control.  And considering that Sherlock always started out eye level with it, he would be bound to notice.  The third time they did the take, Molly had to spend some extra time spritzing his hair because it was also starting to dry. He thought he saw Sherlock give her a thunderous look, but it only lasted a second before Irene was bellowing that his hair was wet enough, thank you very much.  Molly snorted at her jealous girlfriend as she set the bottle down.
Irene grinned.  “You have the most important part.  The song is going to be ‘You’re the One That I Want’ from the movie
It was John’s turn to shout, both surprised and hit with a wave of desire so strong he almost came on the spot.  As it was, he only lasted another minute or so.  The double sensation of feeling and watching Sherlock’s perfect lips fellate him was too much to bear and he barely had time to shout out a warning before he ejaculated quite forcefully down Sherlock’s throat.  He lay gasping for breath in the aftermath, staring up at Sherlock’s self-satisfied expression.
Sherlock drew himself up.  “Of course. You do find me attractive, I could tell by the way you kept looking at me at the party and by your blatant lie regarding your interest in my Instagram.  But you’re not interested in having sex with me.  Not for moral reasons, your other behaviours indicate a rejection of your Catholic upbringing. More likely you’re demisexual and you don’t feel sexual interest in strangers.”  He raised his eyebrows and John nodded.
John pasted a bright smile on his face when the show was over and everyone took their bows.  He gave Sherlock a smile and perfunctory nod when he looked his way, then did the same in turn to Irene, Molly, and Sally.  He was hoping they would go backstage to change or something so he could compose himself.  Instead, they all came down from the stage to mingle with the audience.
John wrinkled his nose.  “Yeah, I suppose.  Something I read once that really resonated with me, it was a theory about primary and secondary attraction.  When you met Molly, you were attracted to her right away, yeah?”
The dance troupe included eight people in total – four women and four men.  Irene once mentioned that though they got along with the other four people well enough, none of them had any interest in participating in her choreography.  The implication from her tone was that they were talentless hacks and she was relieved they turned down her polite offer to include them in her videos.
Ella once told him not to see such things as a reminder of failure, but a reminder of survival.  He’d been shot and survived.  He lost his best friend and survived.  He could survive this.  And for this reason, Ella had also told him, he should stop focusing on what would happen if it all goes wrong.  Because what will happen is that he will survive.  Instead, focus on what will happen if it goes right.  Use that as motivation to move past the fear and go for what he wants.  And what he wants is Sherlock.
When he confessed all this to his old friend from secondary school, Bill tempted him with stories of the rugby team at Knight’s and lured him in with the scholarship.  Since Molly also went to Knight’s, he called her up and quizzed her on the academics, knowing she was also studying medicine with a goal towards pathology.  She had lots of good things to say, and just hearing her voice he’d known right then that he had to go for it.
It didn’t take long to unload John’s car.  He didn’t have much, being used to living in student accommodations the past two years when he was at Loudain University.  He did bring a few extra things like cooking utensils and dinnerware, to replace what Molly’s flatmate took when she left.  When mum sold the house over the summer to go live with her new boyfriend, she let he and Harry fight over what they wanted.  Harry cheerfully let him take the kitchen stuff since she never did like to cook.  It was something that John had more in common with his late father.  He found it to be a relaxing pastime, and missed it at Loudain when all he had in his room was a hot pot and kettle.
John took a deep breath to try and compose himself.  “So uh…that was the errand you had to run earlier?”  Sherlock nodded.  “Thank Christ you didn’t take me. I dunno if I could have handled going into that shop.”
As intimately as John knew Sherlock, this actually came as a bit of a surprise.  Many of Sherlock’s ideas and beliefs were difficult to understand, but his derision of Valentine’s Day wasn’t one of them.  It was perfectly reasonable to be cynical about it, or at least John thought.  But now Sherlock was saying otherwise?  “If you wanted to celebrate, why didn’t you ever say anything?  You know I would have indulged you.”
Irene and Molly announced they were heading back home and left the room to give them privacy to change.  John took off his towel and went to his locker to fetch his clothes.  He considered changing out of his pants, since they were now damp from all the spraying water.  But he couldn’t bring himself to strip completely naked in Sherlock’s presence.  Even the slightest breeze might encourage his cock at this point.  Sherlock had his back to him and was peeling off his tights.  John averted his eyes, or at least tried to.  Sherlock only had on the dance belt, which was effectively a thong, so his arse was on display.
Sherlock stared down at him.  “And when I came back, you’d long since buried the memory of that discovery.  Did your best to delete it, but not entirely successful.”
John huffed out a laugh as he came further into the room.  “Yes, that’s exactly it.  You really are good at that.  Deducing people.”  He blushed, not wanting to bring up the sexuality ‘party trick.’  “I’ve seen it on your Instagram.  You seem to be able to figure people out pretty easily.”
John nodded and gave him a tight smile.  “It’s the least I could do for a friend.  Sherlock…”  John didn’t know what came over him at that moment, but he felt all twisted up inside and wanted answers.  “You didn’t seem thrilled by Irene’s plan when she first told us about it.  You made it seem like you were concerned I’d be uncomfortable.  Except…today it’s been
Sherlock gritted his teeth in a fake smile.  “Things are well, Molly. I am so glad I could make it to your little party here.”  His smile widened obscenely.  Molly pursed her lips and shook her head.
More than two years later, John had long forgotten about his discovery…until he posted his blog entry “The Bloody Guardsman.”  He was sitting at his laptop, checking the new comments, and one lady had commented “Who doesn't like a man in uniform?”
John shook his head, squirming from the emptiness he’d been feeling since Sherlock removed his fingers.  “I told you I trust you.  I need you to be facing me, I need…God, Sherlock, I just need you.”
John chuckled.  “It was…fantastic, brilliant, amazing…truly it was.  But it pales in comparison to you telling me you love me.  Does that make me a sap?”
John looked up at the ceiling and groaned.  He didn’t know what to think.  Lifting his head back up, he took a deep breath.  “Right, here’s what I’m going to do.  I’m going to continue not saying anything to Sherlock, because Irene is right – our friendship is important to Sherlock, and it’s important to me.  I don’t want to burden him with all these feelings he doesn’t want if there’s a chance he won’t even notice.
Sherlock huffed.  “Do you even have to ask, Irene?  I know you could see it, too.  There’s something very wrong with that boy.”
.  Now here’s the important part, Sherlock.  A long time ago you told me you were married to your work.  Was this just…an affair?  A way to get yourself off without the messiness of relationships?  Or did things change after that night at Angelo’s?  Did you find that you wanted me after all, but didn’t think it was possible because I’m…”
Molly’s eyes widened.  “You had sex?”  Her tone indicated surprise, but her eyes were filled with trepidation.
Sherlock gave him a rueful look.  “Are you forgetting the fact that you and Molly are hosting a party at your flat tonight?”
your bed watching bloody James Bond.  It’s like the proverbial elephant in the room that we were both ignoring.”  He ran his hand through his hair, agitated.  “When Irene shared her plan for the video, all I could think about was that I wouldn’t be able to keep it all hidden.  You’d see that great big fucking elephant and run in the other direction.”
But what would he do if he told Sherlock his feelings, and Sherlock was still “married to his work,” perfectly content with occasional wanking to lurid thoughts of his former flatmate…if he still even did that.  Maybe he had some experiences while he was away, another soldier that replaced John in the kinkier part of his mind palace.
Mike Stamford piped up.  “I’m still alive and well, thanks, but I wouldn’t mind passing the torch to John.  The only reason you lot voted me Captain last year is because you thought I’d be a pushover.  And you were right.”
The metal bits turned out to be a pair of dog tags.  There was no plausible deniability in this instance, they had his name stamped on them.  Sherlock had definitely gone through his box of Army stuff and had taken them.
Sherlock smiled and nodded.  “Thank you, John.  I’m glad you came, though I know you’d never disappoint Molly.”  He still seemed a little out of breath, and he was glistening with sweat.
Sherlock made a humming sound, then pointed to the ingredient John should add next.  “If one is in a relationship, I suppose it’s common.  I only have casual sex.  It’s only ever going to be the one time with these blokes, and I’m going to be the one to top.  Non-negotiable.”
He was feeling very gratified by how things are going with this team compared to the one at Loudain.  He felt much more of a connection with these blokes.  A part of it was the fact that they all decided to make him captain and then showed him the respect the title deserved.  At Loudain, he was treated with great disdain for both his stature and his novice status, and it never sat well with him.  He worked hard, and that never seemed to count for anything with them.
John stopped pacing.  He needed to take action.  Now.  Mary wouldn’t be back for hours, he couldn’t wait that long.  He went upstairs and packed an overnight bag.  He retrieved his dog tags from the Army box and put them in his pocket.
Greg looked thunderous.  “I’ll murder him.  Finally got something good in his life and he ruined it!  John, I may have known Sherlock longer, but I’ve got your back on this.”
Holmes shrugged.  “That’s because it is easy.  I just look at what they post on their own profiles.  They make their lives an open book.”  His gaze sharpened.  “You’ve been looking at my Instagram?”
When the fly was all the way down and John was next to the bed, he turned and slowly peeled the jeans down over his arse.  He was quite relieved to be freed from the tight confines.  He bent and removed them entirely, glancing over his shoulder at Sherlock, who was watching him in reverence.  John climbed up onto the bed, crawling slowly up to his pillow and then reclined, stretching himself out onto his stomach.  He looked over his shoulder again and raised an eyebrow.
, John.  I’m sure you don’t want to see those things either, but…”  She shrugged as if to say, who else was there.
Sherlock’s eyes followed his progress, darkening as John’s fingers teased at the button to his jeans.  His nostrils flared when John deftly pulled the button out of the loop and then moved his hand down to grasp the zipper pull.  But he went no further, waiting.  Sherlock’s eyes came up to gaze at him in question, and John flicked his own eyes to Sherlock’s shirt, the buttons of which were straining to keep in place.
John shook his head, trying to look reassuring as his heart pounded from what had seemed like Sherlock was going to kiss him for real.  “No, it’s okay.  It’s been a long day.  Look, I have an idea.  Most of the time you’re getting it in the right direction, it’s just falling short of the camera.  Maybe we can get a third towel and Molly can drape it over the camera right as you’re throwing yours, and it will give the illusion that it’s the same one.”  He looked over at Irene.
A bloke called Dimmock slapped Bill on the back.  “He has.  And we trust his judgement.”  Bill beamed at him.
John gave him a tender smile and curled his hand into Sherlock’s.  “I want you to be yourself.  The way that you are when you’re with me.  That’s who I fell for and that’s who I want in my bed tonight.”
John felt alarm bells going off in his head as Sherlock approached.  He tried not to look apprehensive, but must have failed because Sherlock gave him a reassuring smile.  “Don’t worry, it’s filled it with warm water.”
Like in the movie, there was an ensemble scene towards the end that included Sally with Greg (who was more chuffed than he’d admit that he got to be included) and Irene with Molly.  The latter two argued endlessly over which one would get to wear the rugby kit.  Molly won the argument, but John suspected it was a ruse by Irene to see Molly dressed like a rugby player.
Sherlock went on, “You know you’re demi and not asexual because you did at some point develop a sexual attraction to someone.”  He narrowed his eyes.  “On
Molly hummed.  “Well…he might not.  He’s quite convinced no one would ever love him for himself and not just his body.  Whatever signals John is sending might go right over his head.”
John felt the air leave his lungs when Sherlock walked into the flat wearing the same outfit he’d had on that first party where they met – midnight blue shirt and black jeans.  He smiled to himself at the vast difference in his two reactions.  The first time, his appreciation of Sherlock’s beauty had been almost academic.  Now he wanted to get him alone, tear off his clothes, and ride him like a prize stallion at a rodeo.
Irene nodded emphatically.  “Absolutely. I can’t get enough of her now.  Everyone else just fades into the background.”
John had been sitting in his chair, numbly sipping tea, when he heard a shocked, “Oh!” coming from Sherlock’s bedroom.  Mrs. Hudson had been in there looking for some documents that she needed, having been unable to locate them in the more typical areas around Sherlock’s desk.  John had felt a bit guilty for letting her conduct the search on her own, but going through Sherlock’s things felt like more than he could handle.
John huffed out a laugh, wondering if he was fishing for compliments on his dancing.  “The violin video clips…those are rather good, too.”
John’s eyes widened and he fought to keep from turning red as he glanced over at Sherlock, surprised to see that he was glaring at Irene.  “Are you seriously telling me you want John and I to…to perform to
Eventually Sherlock abandoned his worship of John’s arse.  He brought his hand around to the front and reached in to grasp John’s cock, pulling it out and stroking it. John felt the air punch out of his lungs.  Sherlock chuckled darkly in his ear.  “Yes, it’s very different from touching yourself, isn’t it?  It’s that novel feeling of having no idea what I’m going to do next, of being literally in the palm of my hand.”  He gave a twist of his fingers and John clutched at his shoulders.  “Oh John, the way you respond to me.”
John took a long, deep breath.  “No.  Of course not.  I’m saying that my feelings don’t matter. Or at least, they
John read Bill’s instagram reply, and sent out a ribald response.  Then he recalled that he was curious about Sherlock Holmes’ profile. He tapped on Irene’s account and went down to the most recent video, then tapped on the link to Sherlock’s account.  He wasn’t sure what he was expecting to see in Sherlock’s gallery, but it certainly hadn’t been the odd assortment of ballet, chemistry, classical music, and forensic stuff.
Irene snorted.  “He likes to say he’s just cutting through the bullshit. Anyone higher than a zero on the Kinsey scale wants to have sex with him, so it’s pointless to beat around the bush with polite talk and figuring out preferences and interest.”
He leaned against the door, giggling, and John started giggling too.  “Well, that was ridiculous,” Sherlock said as he came over to the bed.
Staring at the pair he’d just found, John wondered what he would find if he were to go upstairs right now and look for them.  If they were gone, that would mean this was the same pair.  It would mean Sherlock had been snooping (no surprise there), had found them, and taken them for his own use.  John shivered as several possibilities flitted through his mind.  Clearly they had been used often, as the red was a bit faded.
Sherlock gathered the equipment and John went to get ingredients.  As they were setting up, Sherlock gave him a calculating look.  “What’s with you, today?”
Irene gave him a catlike smile.  “It’s the way he hooks all his conquests.  When he meets someone he’s interested in taking to bed, he deduces their sexuality.”
Sherlock broke their kiss to groan, “Christ, I want nothing more than to bury myself in your arse right now.”
Irene shrugged.  “Easy enough to piece together.  Molly told me once that other than the occasional dating, you’ve never been in a relationship, and then when she said you were a demi, it seemed natural to conclude that means you’re a virgin.”
John reached for the box, and hesitated.  He allowed himself one last glimpse inside of it, and frowned when he saw something unusual at the bottom.  Red cotton and scraps of metal.  John reached into the box and pushed aside various objects that he was absolutely not going to think about had been
Molly goggled.  “He didn’t invite himself to your room?”  John shook his head.  “Did he leave with someone else?”  John shook his head again.
Sherlock’s lips twitched.  “She’ll love it, I promise.  Especially if you spring it on her.”  Molly gave him a considering look, and then tucked the envelope into the back pocket of her jeans and walked off.
Sometimes there was physical contact, like John would be in a crouch as if getting ready to scrum and Sherlock would roll over his back.  Or he’d be doing pushups and Sherlock was pretending to sit on his bum.  These takes were always the worst.  Feeling Sherlock’s weight on him.  Enduring the endless touching as Sherlock and Irene brainstormed the best way to block a scene.
John took a deep breath as he prepared to exit the showers and make his way to the changing room, his fingers gripped tightly to the knot keeping the ends of his towel together.  When he entered the room, he saw Irene with the camera setting up the shot, Sherlock laying on the bench chatting with Molly.
John cleared his throat.  “So you were able to deduce in my case that I wasn’t interested in sex with you.  And that’s why you left me alone?”
John scowled.  “Mrs. Hudson, Mycroft said not to dispose of anything, that he would take care of it.”
feel good.  They just want me to fuck them.”  He winced, as if realising for the first time how messed up that was.  Because it absolutely was.  John had the terrible feeling that the same arsehole who told Sherlock he was only good for fucking also taught him that sex was only about reciprocation.
.  Being attracted to someone in this setting, it was so much different than the typical lack of modesty with his teammates.
Sherlock smirked.  “I was thinking more along the lines of her being punished by Molly.  As a change of pace.  I’ve seen Irene’s search history, she’s very keen on a certain fetish shop in Hackney that caters to women. A gift card from there would be most welcome.”
The box in question was on the floor next to the bed. Likely Mrs. Hudson had pulled it out from underneath.  John set it on the bed and opened the flap.  The first thing he saw was…bloody hell.  It was a prostate stimulator.  And right next to it was a mostly empty bottle of lube.  John huffed out a shaky laugh.  Her reaction made sense, now.  John closed the flap again, but not before glimpsing an assortment of butt plugs in various sizes.
.  John sucked in a breath.  He’d done such a good job burying that painful memory, that when Sherlock came back from the dead he hadn’t thought about it at all.  Of course, part of that was due to the fact that he’d been so angry at Sherlock for what he did, and the fact that he just got engaged.
John felt a swelling of a different variety several weeks later as he rolled his shoulder in an attempt to ease the throbbing.  He got quite a knock in the first half, but he barely cared.  They were winning.  It wasn’t by much, but he’d always been able to tell by halftime which way the match would go.  It was absolutely theirs to win.
John pinched his nose. Of course he heard, no bloody avoiding it at rugby training.  He supposed he couldn’t blame Bill’s confusion.  He knew John was bisexual, but not any of the rest.  “Look, I’m gonna head home.  I’m starting to feel that hit I took at the match.” He rolled his shoulder for emphasis.
What might have been…bloody hell.  He’d confessed to Sherlock that he stood at his grave wishing for one more miracle.  What he hadn’t acknowledged, to Sherlock
himself, was what he’d imagined he would do if that miracle were to happen.  A second chance to tell Sherlock how he felt.  Find out once and for all whether Sherlock was just scratching an itch or if he had wanted more from John.
Sherlock leaned his head down and pressed his forehead to John’s.  “I can’t count the number of times I’ve thought of the people you gave your heart to and cursed them for fools.  I suppose Molly couldn’t help it.  But whoever that bloke was that had you running to the other side of Britain to escape…well, I suppose I should thank him.  You’re mine now, and I’m not letting you go.”  Sherlock lifted his head so he could gaze into his eyes.  “John…I think I might be in love with you.  I’ve never felt this way, so I don’t…fully understand it.  All I know is that from the moment I met you I can’t stop thinking of you.  And I haven’t been able to touch anyone else since.  For months now.  I’m surprised I didn’t go off like a rocket the moment you touched me.  I want things with you that I’ve never wanted with anyone else, except Victor, I suppose.  But even what I felt for him pales in comparison to you, John.”
John looked over at Molly.  She was giving Irene a confused look.  Irene glanced at her.  “I haven’t forgot what you told me. I know that he was attracted to
when you were at school together.  But we’re not going to talk about that.  Ever.”  She turned back to John.  “I guess what I should have asked was, were you ever attracted to anyone
John nodded.  “Right, that’s primary attraction.  It’s based on whatever physical characteristics appeal to you.  Now, after you got to know Molly, started falling for her, would you say that your attraction to her increased?”
John’s face flamed.  “I know that, I read it in your caption. Which is worse, because now it’s obvious.
The only reason John hadn’t beaten a hasty retreat was because Molly got drunk far more quickly than usual and was sitting in his lap talking non-stop to Sally.  He was having a hard time finding a moment in the conversation to announce his departure.  He was on the verge of breaking in to pretend he needed a trip to the loo when Irene flopped down next to them and demanded her girlfriend switch laps.  Molly giggled hysterically and shimmied off John’s lap and into Irene’s.  The movement made John realise he did have to take a piss after all, so he went off to get relief.
John couldn’t fight the smile that spread across his face.  “Yeah, we were both wound pretty tightly.  So…we finally did something about it.”  He raised his eyebrows significantly.
John looked down at his mobile.  “That’s his name?  Sherlock?”  He tapped on the comments and scrolled through a few.  He was appalled to see some homophobic remarks, but Sherlock’s responses were hilarious.  To one of them he said their comment lowered the IQ of everyone on the app.
John bit his lip on a smile.  Once again, Sherlock had deduced him.  “Ta.”  When he finished with the notes, he packed up his bag to go.  “I really appreciate your help.”
“In case you’re wondering, Stevens doesn’t really care how you arrive at the solution, as long as you get it done.”
…that’s not what I mean at all.  I just meant that Irene planted the seed.  I liked the idea of doing this for you.  You’re extremely talented, you deserve your own bouquet.  I even customised it for you.”
When Sherlock came out, it was clear he was meant to be the star of the show.  The others swirled around him, reaching towards him and then flaring outward like a flower unfurling.  John was mesmerised.  There was something about seeing him dance in person that was entirely different than watching a video on his tiny mobile screen.  Sherlock was larger than life, he was electric, and John could see a myriad of details – the way his muscles bunched and stretched, the way his chest heaved as he performed, the way the fabric of his costume seemed to be both wispy and clingy.  The costumes were the one part of the show that were contemporary – no huge, stiff tutus, ribbons, tiaras, or brocade.  Just leotards, tights, and randomly placed tulle in a rainbow of colours.
Sherlock huffed, his cheeks getting even redder.  “Well, isn’t that your job as my boyfriend?  To feed me up?”
Sherlock took a long gulp of his drink, trying and failing not to wince.  “What can I say?  I’m irresistible.”
In the weeks following Sherlock’s inexplicable suicide, John found it much harder to cope than he would have expected.  He hadn’t realized that his feelings ran that deeply.  The discovery of the secret box made it much, much worse.
I was hitting on you that first night.  But when you told me to back off, I backed off.  When people assumed things about us, it was much easier to just say I wasn’t gay. It was the best way to shut them up.  And it was true, because I am attracted to women. I just happen to be attracted to men as well.”  John took a deep breath.  “The fact that I backed off flirting with you, and the fact that I used the most expedient method of denying my feelings to the world at large didn’t mean that those feelings went away.  I just buried them, Sherlock.  Out of respect for our friendship.  You were the most important person in the world to me and I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable.  After you died, when I saw what you had in that box…God, it was like a punch in the gut.  I didn’t know what to think about what this meant.  Was it just convenient for you to imagine me in those moments or was there more to it?  And I lost my chance to find out.”
So much for Sherlock’s lofty lectures about transport.  Not that John was that surprised to find out Sherlock was a sensualist.  He might have eschewed eating and sleeping, but he did like the finer things.  All those posh bath products.  The sheets with high thread count.  Those bloody suits of his.  Even his sex toys were top of the line.  John wasn’t embarrassed to admit he recognized the brand of the stimulator.
The next morning, John and Molly talked over breakfast. He told her an abridged account of his conversation with Sherlock.  He shared up until Sherlock’s joke, telling Molly his theory that Sherlock confirmed.  He left out the details that Sherlock confided.
John ran his hand up and down Sherlock’s thigh.  “And you are a gift.  The wonderful kind that is both wholly unexpected and something that I never thought I desperately needed until it was in front of me.”
matter.  I’m barely an adult, I don’t need to be worrying about love.  I should just…have sex.  Get it over with and stop overthinking it.  For the first time, I’m in a situation where I want to have sex with someone that wants to have sex with me.  I just need to…to do
…and not worry about everything else.  So…yeah…I’m glad we’ve talked this out. This is good.  I’m gonna have sex with Sherlock, and it’ll be fine.” He gave a jerky nod as if that settled the matter.
good.  I mean, I’m pretty sure Dimmock has an altar to Sherlock set up in his locker.”  He huffed out a cynical laugh.  “I can finally be one of the guys.”
Unlike Irene’s choreography, which used contemporary music and mixed contemporary dance into the ballet, the recital was more traditional.  John recognised a song by Rachmaninoff that Sherlock was playing on his violin earlier in the week in his Instagram story.
There was a long silence, and then Irene spoke up again.  “But, I don’t understand what this has to do with Sherlock.  There are no moral or ethical dilemmas here.  You can fuck to your heart’s content.”
Bill stared at him.  “How are you not interested?  He’s a fucking Adonis.  And you’ve heard the stories of what he’s like in bed.”
.  He could possibly explain it away: Sherlock was a compelling person that drew anyone’s eyes, it didn’t have to be sexual.
Sherlock continued treating John’s erection like it was a lolly as he slowly worked him open.  It was a heady mixture of pleasure and pain.  After what felt like an interminable amount of time, Sherlock shifted back up and lay beside John, giving him a tender kiss.  He leisurely stroked John’s cock as he whispered, “Decision time, John.  I can wear a condom, which would be less messy.  Or we can go without, since I was tested last week.”
John blushed.  “Well, I follow Irene because she threatened me with bodily harm if I didn’t.”  The other man chuckled in that deep throaty tone of his.  It was contagious, and John laughed as well, easing a bit.  “Whenever I see you making snarky comments I usually end up on your profile to peruse a bit.  I like the chemistry and forensics stuff.”
John squeezed his eyes shut, actively willing the stinging sensation of tears to cease.  “Please, Molly.  I can’t…don’t you think I
John shook his head.  “For a genius, you’re rather thick sometimes.  Does this seem like pity to you?”  He pointed down to where his sweatpants did nothing to hide his erection.
John tried to control the breathy moans that escaped every time Sherlock’s hips snapped forward, but it became more and more difficult as Sherlock increased his pace.  When Sherlock shifted the angle of his thrust, John made a high-pitched sound at the sudden sensation of his prostate being brushed.  “Fuck, John, I love the sounds you make.”  He panted as he continued to thrust at the same angle and John felt like he was being driven out of his mind.  “I don’t think I can…nghhh….last much longer,” Sherlock groaned.
Irene rolled her eyes.  “We’re not going for realism here.  Glistening skin is sexier.  Molly, the bottle’s right over there next to Sherlock.”
Sherlock’s expression turned stormy.  “What the hell are you playing at?  You’re not that much of an idiot, John!  You’ve known from the beginning that I was attracted to you.  I only kept my distance because I understood you couldn’t return it.  When we became friends, I tried to set aside that attraction out of respect for you.”
.  Before he could process that he was about to be rimmed, Sherlock’s tongue was on his hole.  John slapped a hand over his mouth to stifle his startled shout.  Sherlock was right, the part of him that wanted to be a doctor was offended by how unsanitary this was.  But he was also right that it felt
Sherlock looked confused, then became wary.  “Did…did you want it to be a one time thing?  Were you just looking to get rid of your virginity?”
John nodded wordlessly, and they both concentrated on tucking themselves away and then standing to put their shirts back on.  They gathered up their gear and then walked out of the changing room together, still not saying a word.  They were halfway across the rugby field when Sherlock finally spoke in quiet tones.  “Did you mean what you said earlier?  That we can still be friends?”
John started chuckling, glad for the distraction from the fact that Sherlock was spraying up and down his arms.  “Sherlock, that’s very nice of you to think of my modesty, but I’m not actually naked under the towel.  I’ve got a pair of boxer briefs on.”  He giggled again at the look on Sherlock’s face as he realised he’d been concerned for nothing.
John winced.  “I think for tonight I should go upstairs.  Doesn’t feel right until I talk with Mary.  Which I’ll do tomorrow.”
John grinned and leaned over to give Sherlock a soft kiss.  “It absolutely is.  One English breakfast, coming right up.”
Anderson sneered.  “Oh come on, I thought you’d appreciate some fresh meat.” He snorted with laughter and John jerked away from the hand still on his shoulder, debating whether to punch Anderson in his stupid face or storm off.
It was an embarrassing memory.  Back when he was dating the one with the spots (and bloody hell he couldn’t even remember her name at the moment) she had dragged him into a sex shop with the idea of spicing things up in the bedroom.  She’d fallen immediately in love with display of brightly colored men’s underwear that lined one wall.  She said that it was a nice change of pace from walls full of lingerie, and it was about time that men started wearing sexy knickers for their women.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes.  “She knew it would be torture.  A hell of our own making.  She needs to be punished, John.”
John clapped him on the shoulder and they went about getting ready for training.  John avoided thinking about the fact that he wasn’t keen to watch the video again, either.
When he got to the lab, Sherlock was already there bent over a microscope.  John’s eyes darted away from his admittedly fantastic arse and cleared his throat.  “Thanks for meeting me.”
John locked the door and then turned to Sherlock.  “So, as much as I appreciated the role playing, what brought it on?”
Sherlock blinked several times, and to John’s astonishment, his cheeks went red.  “That’s…not what people usually say.”
Molly grimaced.  “Is he, though?  I wouldn’t care if he slept with half the university if that was what he
They had to do several takes due to technical issues with the towel.  Sherlock wasn’t able to subtly tug the knot free.  John’s agony increased with each take as Sherlock made more of an effort to get a grip on the towel.  It wasn’t working, the knot was too tight.  They tried loosening the knot, but then it kept falling off at the wrong moment, usually when John was pulling Sherlock flush against him, the end result being that Sherlock’s thigh brushed against John’s cock with only the thin material of his pants between them.
Sherlock didn’t say anything until they were in the kitchen putting away the shopping.  “Now…well, I’ve been letting down my guard in many ways since we’ve moved here.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he parked.  “Because of The Work.  It was distracting enough being in love with you.  And the sex was
He could no longer ignore the jealousy when one day before rugby, he saw Greg looking extremely put out by something on his mobile.  John could hear the song ‘Pillow Talk’ playing.  Greg shook his head and shoved his mobile into his gym bag.  “Bloody Irene.  Why couldn’t she have used Molly for this?  I don’t need to be seeing this shite!”
John turned away and bit down hard on his lip.  He concentrated on pulling on sweatpants and a t-shirt.  When he next glanced at Sherlock, he too was wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt that was looser than the one he’d been wearing for the shoot.  The dance belt was sitting on top of Sherlock’s bag and John found himself wondering if that meant he was going commando.
On one particularly frustrating evening, John was at the lab much later than usual trying to figure out one particularly stubborn solution that wouldn’t mix like it was supposed to.  He felt a bit like Neville in Snape’s class.
John’s eyebrows went up as he went over to the chair opposite, repositioning the union jack pillow before flopping down into it.  “What kind of video?”
Irene looked up, narrowing her eyes and shaking her head.  “John, you’re not wet enough.  Molly, spray him down.”
Irene took the opportunity to turn to Sherlock and give him an assessing look.  “What happened between you and Moriarty?  He was clearly gagging for it, but you were giving him fuck-off vibes.  I saw the look he gave you just before he left.  He was
John swallowed down his toast with a sip of tea.  “It also makes sense why he didn’t hit on me.  If I’m only ever going to be sexually attracted to someone I have feelings for…” He shrugged.
The Knight’s lads were a lot more amiable.  Despite their initial misunderstanding, he and Greg Lestrade got on very well.  Lestrade was one of the older players and he seemed to be the father figure of the group.  John also ended up spending a lot of time with Mike Stamford, who was studying medicine as well.  Bill Murray could always be counted on to take the mick out of him if his head was swelling too much in his role as Captain, but also had a go at anyone who mouthed off at John.
Sherlock wrinkled his brow.  “Uniform fetishist.  Uniform…uniform…there’s something significant about that…Bainbridge’s uniform…what is it…?”
Tears pricked Sherlock’s eyes.  John clearly worked hard on them, even if they looked a bit dodgy compared to the ones in Bexley.  He hoped they weren’t rubbish.  He didn’t fancy having to lie to John.  He tried so very hard these days not to tell fibs.  He took a bite, and was relieved to find that they were delicious.  Slightly dry, but the tea would wash it down.  “Delightful, John.”
John had mixed feelings about his budding friendship with Sherlock.  On the one hand, he thoroughly enjoyed himself whenever they met up.  He also enjoyed texting him, and they were now commenting freely on each other’s Instagram posts.  They’d even begun chatting at the parties.
John felt a little on edge when he showed up to Lestrade’s flat.  He wasn’t much of a partier, he tended to prefer smaller casual get-togethers.  Most of the time parties devolved into a hunting ground, with people hoping to find someone to hook up with before the night ended.  John enjoyed chatting and drinking and even dancing. Not so much the drunken come-ons.  Often they would get confused that he was turning them down, since he was a bloke and must therefore always be up for a shag.  There was more than one party at Loudain that ended on a sour note.
John stopped in his tracks and looked over at Sherlock, whose expression was vulnerable in a way he’d never seen.  “You…you want to have sex with me again?”
Bill slung his arm around John.  “I don’t get it.  Usually with new guys he’s like a fox in a hen house.  D’you think maybe he thought you were straight?  He’s never got it wrong before.  Not even with Dimmock, who kept insisting to everyone at the party that he was straight.  But Sherlock had him arse up by the end of the night, begging for it.  At least, that’s what Dimmock said the next day.  Confessed he’d been in the closet for years.”
“Christ, Sherlock, I’m sorry!  I forgot Molly told me you all were getting in extra rehearsal time for the recital.  I shouldn’t have asked for help, you’re far too busy.”
“God, I’m close, too.”  John whined as Sherlock’s thrusts became harder, more unsteady.  John reached up and grasped the headboard to hold himself in place.  Sherlock fumbled for the lube and managed to flip open the cap and squirt some out with one hand.  He dropped it and brought his hand down to John’s cock and began to stroke it.
Irene looked pensive.  “But what if he pulls a Sholto?  He may reject you because he knows he can’t reciprocate.  John, he doesn’t deserve to be put in that position.  He values your friendship.”
Sherlock worried his lower lip.  “Good, that’s good.  I didn’t want this to turn into a thing where we
Sherlock shook his head, smirking a little.  “Shot in the dark.  Good one, though.  I could tell by the way you reacted to my remark about virginal sacrifices.  It’s a sensitive subject for you, which means you still haven’t had sex.”
Mike frowned.  “John, I don’t know what led you to think that, but you know Sherlock doesn’t…feel things that way.”
.  And it was something that Sherlock wanted, to John’s amazement.  Enough to get some mysterious and kinky object for future use.  John imagined the idea of them fucking so often that he would be ready for whatever
Irene gave John a once over and bared her teeth in a smile.  “It looks positively porntastic!  Thank you, Sherlock, for your careful attention to detail with this task.”
Sherlock stared at him, and his eyes were shining.  John realised he was on the verge of tears.  “That’s exactly it, John.”  He leaned down and captured John’s lips in a kiss that was both tender and passionate.  John felt Sherlock’s cock shift and then it was right there at the entrance to his body.  And then it was
John huffed out a sigh of relief.  “Sherlock..”  He circled his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders and buried his face in his neck.  Sherlock’s arms went around his back, drawing him even closer.  “I love you so much, Sherlock.”
John shook his head to stop the woolgathering and rang the buzzer.  Less than a minute later, Molly flung open the door and launched herself into John’s arms.  “John!!  I’m so happy you’re here!!  Oh, I’ve missed you so much.  Come in, come in!”
John grinned.  “Just so you know, I watched it twice because it was a great performance, he’s very talented and you’re a great choreographer.  But to answer your question…I can appreciate someone’s body as aesthetically pleasing, I just don’t have sexual thoughts of what I’d want to do with that body.”
.  John sucked in a sharp breath, grateful that Sherlock stopped at that point.  He needed to adjust, and he breathed in and out through his nose as he waited out the odd feeling of discomfort.
Somehow the feeling of Sherlock’s weight on him was more erotic than when they’d been sitting flush against each other earlier in the afternoon.  The heat of Sherlock’s body was more evident, the velvet skin of his torso sliding against John’s making his adrenaline soar.  Then there was the sensation of Sherlock’s cock rubbing against his every time he moved his hips.  This was already so much better than what they did earlier.
Mrs. Hudson bustled into the sitting room, wringing her hands.  “John, I know you’re hurting right now, but I think it’s asking too much to make me deal with what I just found.  A woman my age!”
John lifted his chin, determined to be just as steely even though his insides roiled at the very thought.  “I’ve always been a bit of a gambler, Molly.  I’ve examined the odds of what will happen if I tell Sherlock about this.  He’ll either tell me he feels the same way…which has a
One Saturday night, John was plotting his escape so he wouldn’t have to watch the latest member of the swim team, Jim Moriarty, practically devour Sherlock with his eyes.  He was very good-looking, and wearing a white t-shirt that hugged every sculpted muscle.  He was so obviously receptive to a hook-up that John was surprised they hadn’t left the party yet.
But did he belong at Baker street.  The prospect of returning there made his heart quicken.  But once again he thought about the consequences if Sherlock rejected him.  Would he really be able to live there?  The relief he felt moments ago now evaporated.  Fuck!  He’d just torpedoed one relationship with his messy feelings, and now he had the potential of blowing up the one that mattered the most.
Sherlock smirked.  “That we’re romantically involved? I’m sure from the moment we left the changing room.”
“Now, now, John, don’t kink shame.  You’ve only just begun your sexual journey, who knows what you’ll be into.”
John winced in sympathy. He knew exactly what that felt like.  He set to work immediately, grabbing Sherlock’s leg and removing his shoe, then using the heel of his hand to push against the ball of Sherlock’s foot.  With his other hand he massaged the calf muscles.  The simultaneous action always worked the best to get the cramp to release more quickly.  Sherlock groaned and whimpered, but after a few moments his face relaxed and his shoulders slumped in relief.  John didn’t stop the pressure or the massaging, as it was always a risk of another cramp if treatment stopped too quickly.
John found him over by the booze table pouring a G&T.  “You know you’re not responsible for Dimmock’s feelings.”
Sherlock nodded jerkily.  “I had the pants laid out next to me, so that when I came it would go all over the pants.  It made the orgasm more intense.”
Sherlock finally pulled his head back to catch his breath, his head banging against the locker behind him, his expression blissful.  But then his face scrunched up like it did on those rare occasions he didn’t understand something.  He stared down into John’s eyes, his tone wary.  “Why are you doing this, John?  Do you feel sorry for me because of what I just admitted?  I’d rather have more pity lavender.”
Molly’s face crumpled.  “I knew it had to be something like this.  He doesn’t think anyone could ever have feelings for him, so he’s closed himself off.”
Sherlock brought his hands up and began to slowly undo the buttons, putting them out of their misery.  His chest heaved, and John felt like his own breathing was in perfect sync.  More and more of Sherlock’s torso was revealed, and John was just as greedy to see it as he had been mere hours ago in the changing room.
The blast of music was a shock, but quickly muffled again when Sherlock shut the door.  John thought he heard a cheer, and the door to the bathroom open and shut.  There was the faint groan of the pipes as John imagined Sherlock was running the hot tap to wet a flannel.  The bathroom door opened and closed again, and this time there was a distinct wolf whistle as the bedroom door opened and Sherlock appeared.  He had a damp flannel in one hand, and with the other he made a rude gesture at someone out of view before firmly shutting the door.
Sherlock looked disgruntled for a moment, then gave him that smile that was reserved for him alone.  “I loved it, John.  It was the perfect way to celebrate us ushering in a new era of our life.  It pleases me enormously that you were willing to come here with me.  I know you can’t have as much enthusiasm for beekeeping as you did for crime fighting.  But today showed me that you at least…support me.”
After procuring a beer, John eventually found Molly with Irene, who was holding court on the sofa.  He tucked himself in next to Molly, and she smiled up at him, squeezing his knee.  He felt immediately better, and settled in to have a few drinks and listen to Irene’s stories.
John nodded slowly, and then got out of the car, grabbing the shopping bag from the boot before heading for the door.  “So now that we’re retired from The Work…?”
She patted him on the shoulder as she headed towards the door.  “Thank you, John.  You know, as surprised as I was by what I found…it’s nice to realize that he wasn’t as high above us mortals as he pretended.” She gave an odd sort of giggle as she closed the door behind her.  Ooo
John put his head in his hands, listening to Molly’s exasperated tones as she jumped to explain.  “John, I’m so sorry, she really thinks all boys want is sex.  And I don’t think she truly understood what you told her about demis.”  She turned to her girlfriend.  “If this was just about sex, Sholto would have had John six ways to Sunday.  But he knew that John needed more from him.  That was why he turned him down.  John doesn’t feel attraction until he feels love.  It’s not like he’s unlocking some level of gameplay.  The desire for sex is just a byproduct.  His
He was relieved to see that Irene’s expression was curious, not judging.  “So, you haven’t felt sexual attraction for
To his relief, he could see the light on through the window.  He let himself in with the key that Sherlock insisted he have, and went upstairs. He put his overnight bag on the landing out of sight, because he certainly didn’t know how to answer
“Turn over,” he growled in a tone that was almost subsonic.  John scrambled to obey, flipping so that he was on his stomach again.  Sherlock straddled him, his cock resting on the cleft of his arse, and John started to pant in anticipation.  Sherlock bent over him, his lips to John’s ear.  “I’m going to do something that may offend your medical sensibilities, but you have to trust me that you’ll love it if you just relax.  Alright?” John wondered what he could possibly be up to, but he nodded.  He did trust Sherlock.
John chuckled.  “It’s expected, Sherlock. I think Molly would kick me out of the flat if I didn’t give her cute Instagram stories to gush over.”
John took Sherlock up on his offer occasionally.  Not as often as he’d like, but he didn’t want to push his luck by annoying the genius too much.
Irene huffed out a laugh.  “Are you forgetting the conversation we had?  You were the one who told me you thought ‘I Want You To Want Me’ would be lovely as a ballad.  I found some covers on youtube and realised you were right.  I did credit you as the one who turned me onto the song.”
Whoever choreographed the dance knew Sherlock quite well, it was practically an homage.  John went through a myriad of emotions as he watched, and all of them troubling.  There was his admiration for Sherlock’s form – both his dancing form and his…
Sherlock scoffed.  “That’s because I’m a performer and so is she.  John has no experience with this sort of thing.  You can’t just expect him to…to…pretend some sort of come hither role play with me slavering after him…”
John cleared his throat again, feeling dazed.  “That’s…amazing.  It’s extraordinary.  You’re really quite brilliant.”
Irene rolled her eyes.  “It is to Sherlock.  He literally says, ‘The game is on!’ when he sees an attractive bloke.” Molly huffed and folded her arms.  “Come on, don’t be a prude.  Sherlock’s just enjoying life to the fullest.”
…it’s all fine.  But we’re ditching the party early. I’ll just have to promise Molly I’ll do all the cleanup in the morning.”
Sherlock looked up from where he was selecting a handful of ingredients.  His brow wrinkled and he opened his mouth and then closed it.  Shaking his head, he finally spoke.  “If you ever need help again, you can always text me.”  He fished out his mobile and held it up.
John served him breakfast in bed - scones with honey butter, strawberries and cream.  They spent the day at home.  Sherlock found he preferred the solitude these days.  Sometimes being around people made his mind race too much.  While Sherlock strategised the procurement of bee hives, John worked on doing minor repairs around the cottage that the previous owner had neglected, as well as working on something in the kitchen that smelled divine.
John felt his neck flush hot and he knew it wasn’t remembered embarrassment of that moment.  “Jesus fucking Christ, Sherlock.  If I wasn’t ready to gnaw my arm off from hunger, I’d want to do something about that right now.  How about we go get dinner and then you can show me what you had in mind?”
John rolled his eyes.  “You know I couldn’t possibly do as good a job.  I’ll take a stab at it, though.  Your little joke just now…  I can imagine that most of the blokes you sleep with probably don’t appreciate your intellect, especially when you’re so sharp with it.  And I also think you don’t really care, you’re only interested in sex with them.  But…perhaps at some point there was someone whose opinion did matter?  Perhaps early on in your experience?”  Sherlock looked away.  John folded his arms and gave him a patient look.  “Come on, Holmes.  It’s only fair.  One bared soul for another.”
of the bedroom.  Victor finally had enough of my clinging and told me that he loved taking my cock, but I was too much of a wanker to actually spend time with.”
John figured it was a good thing they never got together romantically as he once hoped they would.  Their parting would have been much harder.  It was difficult enough as it was.  They hadn’t grown up together, Molly’s family moved to Manchester when she was 14.  But the four years of friendship before they went their separate ways had been the most meaningful of John’s life.
When he was satisfied, he gently set Sherlock’s leg on the floor and scooted back a safe distance, swallowing hard at the blissed-out look on Sherlock’s face.  “Thank you, John.  I suppose if I had to get a muscle spasm, I’m glad it was in the presence of someone with experience in this sort of thing.”
Curiosity propelled him out of his chair and into Sherlock’s room.  Once inside, he took a moment to breathe deeply, in and out.  This had been Sherlock’s personal space, the part of him that wasn’t taken over by cases or experiments.  John had once imagined that it would be just as stacked full of books and petri dishes as the rest of the flat. But it was actually quite tidy.
They saw each other all the time now, not just in the lab or at parties.  They had meals together.  John introduced Sherlock to the delights of Bond movies.  He tried to resist being utterly charmed by Sherlock’s running commentary on the absurdity of it all.  It was moments like those that John didn’t even think about sex – he just wanted to wrap his arms around Sherlock and tell him how much he desperately loved him.
It was one of his favourite songs, so he sidled over and looked down at Greg’s mobile.  It was Irene’s Instagram, and he could see Sally dancing in jeggings, a flannel shirt, and cowboy hat.  “Oh, it’s Sally.  Good choice for that song.”
John gently set his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder.  “Here’s the thing, love.  You can do all the right things and still hurt people.”
Sherlock went over to his still open locker and slammed it shut.  “There are days when all I can think about is taking you to bed.  Especially when we’re sitting
“Yeah, I’ll be there.  I mean, may as well.  No point in making two trips to drop off and then pick up your gear.”
Sherlock’s hands slid down his back until he was grasping his arse, and John let out a whimper against Sherlock’s lips.  The whimper turned into a squeak when Sherlock’s hands lowered to his thighs, and then John was being lifted and pinned as Sherlock slotted himself between his legs.  Christ almighty, that was smooth as
Sherlock started giggling as well and pretty soon they were having a hard time keeping it under control.  Sherlock hissed, “We can’t giggle at a video shoot!” but that set them off even more.
But seven months on, the hurt has started to fade and he was once again experiencing the wonderful energy and fulfillment that spending time with Sherlock gave him.  The prospect of a life of “normalcy” was becoming more and more unpalatable.  But John hasn’t known what to do with these intrusive thoughts, especially since Mary and Sherlock were going full speed ahead making such elaborate plans for the commencement of the “normal” part of his life.  Sherlock, who once gleefully sabotaged all his romantic relationships, was now determined to offer him up on a silver platter.
Sherlock removed the robe, and John felt butterflies at seeing his naked body, all alabaster skin stretched over muscle.  Sherlock climbed into bed and snuggled up against John, pulling him into his arms.  John tucked his head onto Sherlock’s shoulder and heaved a sigh of contentment.  “I will never forget this day as long as I live.  The way that you’ve made me feel, it will be ingrained in me forever.”
Sherlock raised one eyebrow.  “Well, it’s such a nice one.”  He turned and went over to another table and began unpacking his bag.  Clearly he was about to get started on his own work.
Sherlock attempted a put-upon expression that John didn’t quite believe.  “Boyfriend, eh? I suppose you’ll also want to arrive at parties together, and leave together.”  John nodded.  “And I’ll have to endure you posting selfies of us on your Instagram?”
Sherlock lowered his head, pressing his forehead against John’s.  “I am so ill equipped for this.  Physical intimacy I understand.  I know that when I take you to bed tonight, I will make you feel so, so good.  What I don’t know is how to make you happy.”
When he came back, he crept in next to John and proceeded to wind his arms and legs around him like an octopus.  John giggled and leaned in for a kiss, loving the mingling of their minty fresh mouths.  After a few minutes of kissing, Sherlock gave him a considering look.  “Weren’t you saying yesterday that one of the things you wanted out of our relationship was to cook me a fry up the morning after?”
The music playing in the next room had a throbbing beat, and John’s pulse raced along with it.  Every ounce of blood seemed to pump straight from his heart down to the erection between his legs.  When Sherlock’s hand reached down and wrapped around his cock, John sucked in his breath and he felt slightly concerned he was going to come before Sherlock got anywhere near his arse.
Sherlock huffed.  “You’re always so honourable, John.  What if I promise we don’t do anything?  Just…cuddle.”
John took a deep breath.  He should say no, but the longing in Sherlock’s eyes broke him.  He nodded, and then very quickly found himself being crowded against the door and Sherlock’s lips on his.  Softly at first, feather light.  Then he was pressing more firmly, both their lips and their bodies.  Except for his hands, which were flat against the door on either side of John’s head.  “If I touch you, I won’t be able to stop touching you.  I don’t know what I was thinking with the idea of sharing a bed.”
https://willietheplaidjacket.tumblr.com/post/173261365472/a-bit-of-unilock-johnlock-for-babynovak05s-kind
John felt a thrill go down his spine as he giggled.  “Hmm, well, I guess it depends on your behaviour.”
If John was at all an honourable man, he would have to break off the engagement.  John contemplated the idea for a moment, taking in how it made him feel.  Relief is what it felt like.  He looked around again.  This wasn’t where he belonged.
John followed Bill into the changing room, a bit nervous of the crowd of men milling about.  He smiled and nodded as Bill introduced him to the other rugby players.  He smiled a little wider when he was introduced to Greg Lestrade, now able to put a face to an Instagram name.  He seemed like an affable sort.
wanted it, but was giving up.  Maybe Mary was wrong about Sherlock being scared.  Maybe he was grieving what might have been by burying his feelings in serviettes and place settings.
Sherlock made a rumbling noise.  “If it does, that means we’re both saps.  I’ve had sex many times, John.  With many people.  Really
John tilted his head, pressing his lips to Sherlock’s.  He leaned back to look up into Sherlock’s lovely eyes. Rubbing his hand up and down Sherlock’s arm, he whispered, “Love, you’ve been making me happy for months now.  Ever since we met…no…since before we met, you’ve been putting a smile on my face.  Just keep being yourself.  Don’t forget, I know fuck all about relationships, too.  We’ll figure it out together.”
As a bonus, here’s a video that was shared with me, of two ballet dancers that look an awful lot like John and Sherlock.  Lovely dance and lovely song.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3514&v=SM8j1FDtn_0&feature=emb_logo
There was a long silence and then Irene briskly stood up to refresh her coffee. “I feel like some cliché for asking this, but why the long faces?  If I’m reading the situation correctly, you now have feelings for Sherlock.  Which means you’re also thinking very filthy thoughts about him.  This is fantastic!  For once you won’t have someone rejecting you, John.  Sherlock will have you bent over a table the moment you say the word.  Your virginity will be one more milestone crossed off your list.  And if I may say, you’ll be luckier than most.  First times are often less than thrilling.  He’ll make it good for you.”  She nodded as if imparting sage wisdom.
When it was tea time, John revealed what it was he’d been working on: lavender and honey tea cakes.  Sherlock could tell he’d been trying to recreate the ones from the tea room that they discovered a decade ago while working a triple murder in Bexley.  It was quite far to go for tea cakes, but they made the trip every so often because Sherlock loved them.  “I called the shop and begged them for the recipe.”
Sherlock mumbled a response that sounded almost like, “Lucky bastards.”  John asked him to repeat it, and Sherlock shrugged and said, “It’s a bit different baring it all in front of two lesbians.”  John conceded the point.
Sherlock raised his hand in a rude gesture, and then took his place back on the bench.  They blocked the first part of the scene, where Sherlock would have one of his legs stretched out the length of the bench.  Sherlock would be folded in half with his forehead pressed down onto his thigh, the idea being that he’s in the middle of a stretching exercise.  John would saunter in and stop right in front of him.  Sherlock would lift his head, his eyes travelling up from the towel to the top of his head.
Molly popped up next to Sherlock just then.  “Hello you two.  And how are things?”  Her smile was full of delight.
He turned to his teammates.  “Alright you lot, let’s get this sewn up.  First match of the season, and first match for me at Knight’s. Don’t embarrass me, yeah?”
Irene tipped her head back and laughed.  “Oh John, John, John.  I’m afraid that Sherlock has made me swear to stop spouting off about his sex life.  But if I were you, I’d start being a little more observant.”
Sherlock made a noise somewhere between a groan and a growl, and the next thing John knew, their positions were reversed and John was now the one up against the lockers.  John gasped and Sherlock bent his head to claim his open mouth.  John felt dizzy from relief and triumph, and soon felt like he was losing his mind as Sherlock’s tongue stroked against his own again and again.  He never knew kissing could be like this, so filthy and all-consuming.
They stayed that way for a few minutes, holding each other tightly as their breathing slowed and the sweat cooled against their skin.  John wanted to stay in that intimate moment forever, but the reality of it was that Sherlock was heavy and the stickiness wasn’t as easily ignored as it had been earlier.
John huffed out a breath, his cheeks flushed again.  “Wow, I guess I never really thought about the mechanics of it.  I suppose I should keep what you say in mind if I ever want to bottom.”
put out on John’s behalf could he?  It seemed like he was masking the real reason, and John couldn’t help but feel hurt by what that reason might be.
John grinned and nodded.  “I would have got you wisteria, which was the first result when I googled it.  But they didn’t have any at the last minute.”
John sighed.  “No, Irene.  He seemed too irritated with Anderson, who was being a drunken arse.  He just welcomed me to the school and then left.”
John smiled and kissed Sherlock’s curls.  “Don’t pretend that this change in career isn’t as much for me as it was for you.  It was no coincidence that you started talking about it a few months after my operation.”  Sherlock huffed.  “All I’m saying is that this is for both of us. And all I care about is being by your side forever.”  He lifted Sherlock’s chin and gave him a long, soft kiss.
John took another swig of water, and then looked over at the ballet crew again.  Sherlock Holmes was staring right at him.  John found himself flushing for some odd reason and he looked away.  Christ, was he actually flattered that he had the man’s attention?  He shouldn’t be.  The interest was only sexual, and it wasn’t even a personal interest. From what he’d heard, Sherlock liked fit rugby players, and that was as deep as it went.  Had nothing to do with John at all.
In fact, the purpose of the rainbow colours seemed clear after a moment.  For once the pairings weren’t exclusively male and female, it was a mix.  But as was noted before, all eyes eventually fell on Sherlock. The theme of the dancing seemed to be that he did not favour any of them.  He danced with any partner who approached him, but otherwise remained aloof, watching the others.  Eventually, everyone left in pairs or groups, leaving Sherlock alone.  He performed one last dance, his movements giving off the impression that he loved the freedom and flexibility of dancing by himself.
Irene eyed the car eagerly.  “Don’t you dare!  This will come in quite handy.  Imagine not having to lug our equipment on the tube.”  Molly elbowed her and she arranged her features to appear less grasping.  “And of course you wouldn’t want to get rid of something that was a gift from your mother.  Think of all the memories soaked into the very upholstery.”
John stormed into the kitchen, where Molly and Irene were giggling about something as they ate croissants.  “How did you know?”
John forced himself to crawl out of bed to go brush his teeth and piss.  He rummaged and found a spare toothbrush and set it out for Sherlock.  When he came back into the room, Sherlock was climbing out of bed.  John gave him a quick kiss on the forehead before taking his place in bed as Sherlock took his turn in the bathroom.
Molly came bounding over at that moment.  “John!”  He pulled her into a bear hug and congratulated her on her performance.  She smiled and pressed her daisies into her face to inhale the scent.  “We’ve decided to all go out to Angelo’s to celebrate.  Are you two coming?”
John stared around in disbelief.  “It’s just the first training session!  You haven’t even seen me play!”
The laughter faded when Sherlock started spraying his hair, running his fingers through it so that the moisture penetrated down to the roots.  John stayed stock still, concentrating on breathing steadily and quelling his arousal.  He looked down at the ground, ostensibly so that Sherlock would have better access to the top of his head, but mostly so he wouldn’t have to look at Sherlock.
The second part of the scene was the one John dreaded the most.  In it, Sherlock will slowly rise from the bench until he’s towering over John, his chest ‘heaving with desire’ as directed by Irene.  John’s response will be to grab a fistful of Sherlock’s shirt and tug, indicating he wants Sherlock to kiss him.  His expression triumphant, Sherlock will lower his head slowly.  Meanwhile, he’ll reach down to grab the towel and fling it to cover the camera.
Sherlock tipped his head back and laughed.  “Yes, I remember he was quite frustrated that he couldn’t have what he wanted.  Got no complaints, though.  Well, one.  He whined about his arse being sore the next day.  I told him it was his fault for being too eager.”
The morning of Valentine’s Day, Sherlock woke up to see a vase next to the bed with a wide array of flowers.  They were all pink and red, but none of them were roses.  Instead, they represented some of the flowers that Sherlock was intending to plant in their garden for the bees.  Allium, foxgloves, hollyhock, bee balm, geraniums.  Not exactly an arrangement that a florist might have picked, but Sherlock was delighted by the symbolism.
“Sherlock…no, that’s not it at all.” John reached out to grip his shoulders.  “I’m asking because I need to know if what I’m hoping for is at all a possibility.  You
John eased his hand away from Sherlock’s cock for fear of making it oversensitised.  He switched over to his own cock and absently stroked it as he watched Sherlock come down from his orgasm, marvelling at how beautiful he was.  Sherlock’s brow furrowed and he looked down, his eyes widening as he saw John was still erect and straining.  He shook his head as if he was personally offended, but before John could wonder why, he found himself being gingerly pushed until he was lying back on the bench.  Sherlock then scooted down until his face was level with John’s cock.  He looked up at John and smiled slyly, then without warning he took it into his mouth, all the way down to the hilt.
big deal in London right now, and they called to ask me to come in for an interview.  I met with them earlier today, and…”  Irene took a deep breath.  “They’re interested in possibly hiring me for their team.”
It didn’t help that Sherlock’s costume was a black muscle shirt with black tights and his hair slicked back to resemble Travolta’s look.  The first time he saw Sherlock in the get up he turned to Irene and gave her a look that said he would cheerfully murder her.
“What just happened?  Goddamnit, don’t tell me I missed the whole thing!”  John turned to see Irene regarding him eagerly as Molly stared at the door wide-eyed.  Irene grabbed his arm and shook it.  “Well?  Did he deduce you?”
Sherlock waved his hand.  “No, John, you need my help.  I can’t possibly abandon you now when I’ve gone to such lengths for your education.”
John settled down into his new bed, enjoying the feel of the fresh sheets.  First night in his new home.  He heard his mobile chime and saw it was a notification from Instagram.  His mate Bill Murray replied to his comment on Bill’s post, which was a picture of rugby gear that had the caption, ‘Get ready.’  Their first team training was tomorrow, and John was definitely ready for a fresh start.

Sherlock pressed his lips together, his expression wracked with doubt.  Recalling Molly’s warnings, John knew Sherlock was about to massively overthink this.  John rocked his hips forward so that his erection pressed against Sherlock’s thigh.  “Please, Sherlock.  Don’t deny the evidence.  Don’t…don’t deny
Sherlock gave a little shake of his head.  “No, I don’t have any lube.  It would be a crime if your first time being fucked is a quick spit job in a semi-public place.”  John whined in protest at the idea that Sherlock might actually stop what they were doing.  Sherlock seemed to read his mind, because he gave John a heated look and continued, “That being said, I don’t think I could stop touching you if the building were on fire.  We’ll think of something else.”  Sherlock nuzzled against the line of his jaw, nipping at his chin.
Mike smiled and stood up to address the whole room.  “Hey you lot, listen up!  It’s a new season, and now is as good a time as any to vote a new Captain.  I nominate John Watson.  All in favour?”  The room erupted in enthusiastic ayes.
Molly stood as well. “Irene, I can’t believe you’re this thick!  This isn’t about sex!  At least, it isn’t
Everyone laughed.  Bill piped up, “John was Captain when we were at school.  He was brilliant, kept us all in line and it showed on the pitch.”
John put his dog tags in his pocket and returned the pants to the box, folding the flaps down.  Taking the box downstairs to the bins, he squashed down the tiny voice in his head that wondered whether Sherlock would have committed suicide if they’d been romantically involved.
dancing to it.  It’s not subtle at all!”  Christ, the way that Sherlock had danced to that song.  The cover she used had so been full of longing, and juxtaposed with how Sherlock conveyed the yearning through dance had cut John to the
Molly blinked blearily.  “Freddie the Footballer?” she slurred.  “Seems like a nice chap.  He started just before you did.”  John stared at her.  That…that couldn’t mean that Sherlock hasn’t had sex since before he came to town.  He’s constantly chatting with blokes at every party John’s been to.  Probably just meant that they never crossed paths until recently.  Or maybe not that recently if Irene was right.
Sherlock chuckled.  “Well, I didn’t want you with me because I intended to get something for us too and I didn’t want to spoil the surprise.”
John still left the parties early whenever some fit bloke started to chat Sherlock up.  And if the subject of Sherlock came up at rugby, John slid out of the room as unobtrusively as possible.
Molly came back with a towel and they resumed their take.  Now that they weren’t getting stuck on the towel bit, they could continue with the last bit where their lips inched towards each other until the towel was flung into the camera.  John had been very relieved that Irene decided not to have them actually kiss.  She said it was because the tease of the kiss was more tantalising, and made the towel fling more effective.  John knew deep down that she was taking pity on him and not forcing him to fake kiss the man he loves.
John giggled, then attempted to look stern.  “How about…you might get sex if you actually pay me a compliment, you berk.”
But now John was in London, too, and hoping that he could rely on Molly’s friendship to ease the way as he started all over again at a new university.  If they’ve both changed more significantly than their social media banter indicated, it might not go that smoothly.  Especially since they were about to share a flat.  Molly had been looking for someone since her flatmate left to move in with her boyfriend, so the timing was perfect.
It turned out Irene wasn’t remotely surprised, given that she’d known how both men were feeling.  John chuckled fondly as he listened to them chat while he cleared up his dinner.
Bill was the one who told John about scholarship opportunities if he transferred to Knight’s College and it had felt like Bill was saving his life.  John had already decided to switch his major to medicine, and really wanted to switch universities as well, but he wasn’t sure if he was overreacting.  He hadn’t been happy at Loudain. He never really made friends, and didn’t click well with his rugby mates.
John held up his hands and made gentle shushing noises.  “Sherlock, no no no, don’t overthink it, love.  I enjoyed it, honestly.  I know it’s not really a game.  I know how you feel.  And I know this is difficult for you.”  He stepped up to Sherlock, pressing his hand to his chest.  “I fully believe what you’ve told me, that you know how to make me feel good.  So just concentrate on that.”
The Sherlock&Sally video mentioned in this chapter is inspired by two performances. I knew I wanted to do a paired dance after seeing this amazing video of two dancers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9cA9Z4bNzk
John tried to remember if he’d ever met someone named Freddie.  He didn’t keep up with the footballers.  Molly sat back down beside him with a fresh drink and asked what was going on.  Pointing to where Sherlock and Irene were having a whispered argument across the room, John explained about Moriarty’s rejection and Irene’s theory that Sherlock hasn’t had sex in awhile.  “Do you know a guy named Freddie?”
A couple weeks later, John was starting to get behind in his chemistry course due to how many hours he was putting in for rugby.  He talked to the lecturer, who gave him permission to access the labs late at night.  He was pretty tired after a long day of courses and rugby training, but pleased at the chance to finally make up some of his practical assignments.
John pushed Bill’s arm away, feeling a wave of irritation.  “This is utterly ridiculous.  Holmes is not a fox and I’m not a bloody hen.  We’re two adults capable of negotiating consent.  He saw I wasn’t interested, and he left me alone.  That’s all there is to it.”
John shrugged one shoulder.  “Yeah, I can tell you what it’s like for me.  Not all demis are the same, though, from what I’ve read.  What do you want to know?”
Sherlock’s smile twisted a little.  “Somehow, despite having come to know me very well, you want to have sex with me.  I still can’t quite grasp it.”  He looked away and took a deep breath, cleared his throat, and when he looked back at John, his expression had changed subtly.  His eyes were glinting with a light that made John shiver.  “As I understand it, your room is just along that corridor.” His eyes flicked to the hallway leading to the bedrooms.  John had to bite his lip to keep from laughing again, because Sherlock had been back there many times.
Irene looked up from the mobile.  “Don’t mind us, I was showing Molly some of the comments on my latest video.”
Molly gave Irene an exasperated look.  John chuckled.  “Molly, of course I want to be there, and not because I’m your designated cabbie.  You always come out to my matches and it means a lot to me.  I want to support all of your hard work as well.”
Sherlock’s expression crumpled slightly.  “I wasn’t able to successfully delete you while I was away.  I tried, so that my mind could be more focused.  It didn’t work.  I missed you too much.  Does that answer your question, John?”
John made a cutting gesture.  “No!  Stop feeling sorry for me, there’s no point.  Look, I’m not pretending like I don’t want more.  But I think I can be fine with just sex.  And as you say, it will be…
They both giggled, and Sherlock carefully rose from the floor, waving away John’s offered hand.  “Alright then, let’s see what Stevens has botched in his lecture this time.”  John studiously avoided the way that Sherlock’s sweatshirt slipped over one shoulder as he talked.
Sherlock draped himself over John’s body, kissing and nuzzling at his ear and cheek as his hips ground into John’s arse.  John’s breath turned ragged as he felt Sherlock’s erection pressing against him through the two flimsy layers of their pants.  “
Molly looked happy.  More than happy…radiant.  And he knew it wasn’t due to him.  She’s been seeing someone a few months now.  A girl named Irene, and it seemed to be pretty serious.  They apparently met at a summer ballet intensive course.  Based on the snapchat pics of her gazing adoringly at the other girl, Molly was head over heels.  Even now, she was tugging John towards the sitting room where Irene was lounging on the sofa.  Molly’s girlfriend was even more beautiful in person, and her gaze was intense as she stood to shake John’s hand.
Molly shrieked and threw her arms around her.  Irene laughed and gave her a thorough kiss.  “But!  Before they agree to hire me, they want me to make another video, this time using professional equipment.  They’ll provide all that, and they gave me a budget as well.  They asked for ideas of what I might like to do.  We brainstormed possibilities and came up with one routine that they were over the moon about.  I hope you don’t mind, but I sort of included you as part of it even though you didn’t agree to something like this.”
Sherlock stared, and his mouth opened and closed a couple of times before spluttering out, “I don’t understand.  If you’re turned on, that would imply that you feel…
Irene looked thoughtful.  “Well, for one thing, I noticed you watching at that video more than once.  Quite intently.  Are you telling me you didn’t feel sexual attraction for Sherlock?”
“Yes, as a matter of fact.  It’s quite comfortable, a nice cosy space.  You interested in seeing it?”
John shook his head.  “I know that you care about me, Sherlock.  And I know that you’re attracted to me.  But does that even matter if you’re still married to your work?  If I were to move back here, would we
about sex.  You really have no idea what John’s been through.  If you did, you’d understand why this is a disaster.”
She nodded slowly.  “I think that could work.  Molly?”  Molly gave her a thumbs up and went off to find towel number three.
In answer, Sherlock reached down with his other hand and tugged the waistband of his sweatpants down, his erection bobbing out.  John grinned to see that he’d been commando after all.  His smile faltered as he suddenly felt nervous.  He knew nothing about giving pleasure to someone else.  What if he was so utterly amateurish that Sherlock lost all interest?  Sherlock leaned forward and breathed in his ear, “I guarantee you that even just a stroke of your fingers on my skin will feel incredible.  Touch me, John.”
you,” he growled.  Sherlock bent his head to skim his lips across John’s nipples and pecs, his hands sliding to John’s back and then underneath the waistband of his sweatpants.  He started massaging John’s arse.  John tipped his head back to let out a moan, which broke off into a whine when Sherlock’s fingers slid down teasingly in the vicinity of his hole.  It was like he couldn’t resist going there even though he’d already vetoed it.
Sherlock’s lips curled.  “I’m not some bloody beast that needs slaking, Anderson.  Do us all a favour and have another gin and tonic so you pass out.”  He turned to John, and once more his eyes flicked up and down.  He seemed contemplative for a moment before finally looking John in the eyes, his features and tone of voice perfectly bland as he said, “Welcome to Knight’s, Captain Watson.  If you’ll excuse me.”
John inhaled deeply as he set the flask on the Bunsen.  “Yes, well, I suppose it is a bit curious why you only ever top.  Not that I know anything about all this, mind, but from what I heard it seems like most folks switch.”
“He better come!  We need him and his car to haul our equipment to the venue.”  John shook his head and chuckled.  Irene was forever roping him into running errands for her.
One of the more recent images was a screenshot of an article about a murder case.  He said in the caption that it was obvious the brother was the killer, noting the mention of a shed and a missing ladder, and that NSY should have figured it out if they weren’t filled with idiots. There was a response from @greglestrade telling him to piss off, and he was sure NSY was doing a brilliant job.  Sherlock responded, “Unlikely, Gerald. I hope when you join the Met, they become slightly less idiotic.” @greglestrade responded, “ffs my name is Greg it’s right there in the profile!” John started giggling hysterically as @sallybobally replied to him that he shouldn’t take the bait, and @greglestrade replied “you’re one to talk, you let him wind you up all the time.”  Sherlock then told them to go have their domestic somewhere else and quit cluttering up his Instagram.  John was doubled over in laughter when he finished reading.
After I wrote Sherlock’s recital solo, someone shared this video with me, which I found delightful because it perfectly conveys what I was going for (and he looks like Sherlock):  https://youtu.be/myUXoDac7h4
John let out a giggle, and Sherlock took the opportunity to deepen the kiss, their tongues sliding together.  God, even without Sherlock touching him this could get out of hand quickly.  As if reading his thoughts, Sherlock reluctantly broke the kiss.  They spent a few moments getting their breath back.  In a resigned tone, Sherlock said,  “I um…I think I better go to bed early. Even just looking at you as we sit across from each other will be too much.  Goodnight, John.  Sleep well.”
John laughed.  He realised he was feeling a bit giddy knowing that Sherlock rejected Moriarty.  “It’s a superstition, Irene.  I say it as a joke, and it’s up to them whether they’ll obey.  I know for sure Greg doesn’t, Sally wouldn’t stand for it.”
John sighed and shook his head.  “I’m sure he’ll be inundated by most of the rugby team.”  He felt a twinge as he said it, and tried hard not to think of the idea of Sherlock, flushed from dancing and still in his leotard, being presented with a bouquet by John. Not roses…Sherlock would appreciate something different.  Perhaps whatever flowers bees liked the most.  Sherlock was on a kick lately sharing bee facts on his Instagram.
Greg barked out a laugh.  “That’s for damn sure.  Still though, they really made it look like they were hot for each other.  And you
.  Which is why I am dying to see what happens with you.  I’m sure he’ll be able to tell you’re bisexual right away.  But will he figure out the rest?”  Her lips curved into a smirk.  “I love Sherlock, but I would
Anderson turned brick red.  “Look, I-I didn’t know about your cheating ex. I can see that would be upsetting to you.  I’ll keep my distance from now on.  The last thing I want is for there to be bad blood with a teammate.  So, I apologise.”
John tilted his head back to look up at Sherlock, and was met with a kiss.  “Will you stay here with me, tonight?”
John stared in disbelief at his teammates.  Even Dimmock looked sympathetic.  He held up his hands in a placating manner, trying to think of what he could say to convince them.  When he saw Sherlock coming their way, he didn’t know whether to be relieved at the arrival of reinforcements, or concerned that Sherlock would get punched before he got a word in.
Greg’s expression melted into sheepishness.  “Sorry, Watson.  I know I need to reign it in.”  He sighed and shook his head.  “My last girlfriend cheated on me, and I don’t always handle it well.”  John was startled by the about face, but he listened carefully.  Greg went on, “I don’t take my issues out on Sally, she doesn’t deserve that.  But I do get a bit wound up when I see other blokes sniffing after her.”
Sherlock nodded.  “It’s been quite awhile since I’ve gone without, I hope I last.”  He kissed John’s cheek.  “Okay, what position?  If you straddle me on top, you’ll be in control.”
Glad that Irene was now looking over at Molly as they chatted about the upcoming recital, John rubbed his hand down his face as he thought about the way things were headed.  He wondered if there was any turning back at this point.
He’d always known, since the moment he decided to propose to her, that it wasn’t because being married to her was what he wanted most in the world.  It was because he felt grateful to her for the normalcy she provided that he’d really needed at the time.  Marrying her was a way of guaranteeing that it wouldn’t go away, like Sherlock had.  Once Sherlock came back, he’d held onto that normalcy even more, as a way of coping with the feeling of betrayal eating away at him.
John kept a straight face as collectively everyone in the room looked over at Anderson, the tall gangly player in the corner.  His jaw dropped open.  “What?  I’m not
John looked at him in surprise, and then folded his arms.  “Yeah, Irene mentioned that, so you think you can back off the caveman routine?  Is there something about ballet dancers that makes people territorial? Irene was the same way about Molly.”  His insides roiled at the possibility he’s already blown it with a teammate, but he wasn’t going to put up with bullshit.
Sherlock moved off him, and John whimpered at the loss of contact.  Sherlock gently turned John over so that he was on his back, and then his body was pressing into him again.  “John,” he groaned as he lowered his head for a kiss.  John wound his arms around Sherlock’s neck as they kissed and kissed.  Sherlock’s hands roamed up and down John’s torso, detouring occasionally to reach down to massage his arse.
John found Molly and chatted with her for a bit, warning her that he would be disappearing soon.  He drank his scotch and felt it settle into his blood, transforming his anxiety into anticipation.  After awhile, Sherlock appeared next to Molly.  “Well, Hooper, aren’t you going to introduce me to your friend here?”  When she gave him a bewildered look, he turned to John and held out his hand.  “I don’t believe we’ve met, I’m Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock waved his hand.  “Oh John, the way I see it, if I hurt you I deserve to get beat up.  It’s only fair.  I’m more apprehensive about the talk you’ll eventually get from my brother.  That’s not a threat you want to take lightly.”
have sex.  Not that I’m not looking forward to that, it’s just…I really do enjoy your company, John.”
John barked out a laugh, but no one else seemed to think it was funny.  Mike was shaking his head.  “Greg has a point.  Sherlock’s never been friends with any of the blokes he’s slept with.  Doesn’t want to lead them on into thinking they’re gonna be in a relationship.  It’s only a matter of time before he’ll be holding you at arm’s length.” He tipped his head towards Dimmock as if to prove his point.
Sherlock’s smile was tender.  “That trust goes both ways, but I get your point.  I’m perfectly happy to be the top for now.  You’re not the only one who can’t stop thinking about it.  Remember the match a few weeks ago when that other player yanked down your shorts and bared your arse to everyone in the stands?  You have an outstanding arse, John.  I couldn’t stop thinking about what I wanted to do to it.”
The setting of the video itself was inspired by this music video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHVWqauWiEg
Irene screwed up her face and shook her head.  “No, that won’t work either, will it?  He’ll figure it out, if he hasn’t already.  This is Sherlock we’re talking about.”
.  John kept his hand over his mouth as he keened, his thighs straining with the effort to keep still as Sherlock worked him open with his tongue.
Sherlock seemed to get increasingly agitated as well, probably annoyed that they were having to do so many takes.  He finally barked at Irene to just have Molly hand him a towel off screen, for fuck’s sake.  Molly darted off in search of one, John and Sherlock turning their backs on one another to compose themselves.
He started to sit up, but Sherlock pushed him back down.  “Don’t be absurd, John.  I’m the top, it’s my responsibility.”
“Mrs. Hudson discovered it shortly after your…death.  She asked me to dispose of it so your brother wouldn’t see it.  Along with various other…items, I found my red pants…and these.  Obviously I kept the tags, but I threw the rest out.  Sorry.  It looked like an expensive collection, but I thought you were dead.”
Irene’s playful expression melted and she sighed.  “I’m sorry I upset you, Molly.  But you know Sherlock, he says he’s married to his work.  And I’ll hardly need to orchestrate their meeting.  Sooner or later Sherlock will come looking for John.  I can’t help it if I want to have a front row seat to it happening.”
He refrained from pointing out that they were in a section of the shop that catered to gay couples.  He was trying very hard not to look at any of the items on the shelves, as he was already having a hard enough time avoiding pervy thoughts about his madman flatmate without the items on display giving him ideas to work with.  To shut her up and get out of the shop, John had agreed to a pair of red pants.  Once he got home, he shoved them in the far corner of his underwear drawer and completely forgot about them.
John beamed at him.  “Wow, those are two very good words.  I’d say they were my favourites, right after ‘Sherlock.’”
On the other hand, Molly’s warnings continued to ring in his head, especially with how difficult it was to sort out all the reactions he was having to Sherlock.  Like that day John almost caused a fire with the wrong ingredient.  When Sherlock touched him, he’d felt a little thrill.  But he dismissed it as being keyed up from all the dirty talk after rugby training followed by the frank discussion about sex he had with Sherlock.
John was too keyed up to eat a proper dinner, so he just had pot noodle and greek yoghurt.  Molly saw his agitation and was deeply suspicious.  “What happened with Sherlock after we left?  I could cut the tension with a knife in that changing room.”
John bit his lip.  “D’you mind my asking?  I feel like I’m missing something obvious.  From what I’ve been told, bottoming is supposed to feel really good.”  He didn’t add that the idea of it appealed to him a lot.
John started following Sherlock on Instagram, feeling that it was safe to do so now that there was an understanding between them.  He liked the posts he found interesting, but felt a bit shy about commenting on any of them.  Sherlock followed him back, and liked some of his posts, but he too refrained from comment.
.  What the hell was he going to do?  John looked around the little suburban home he shared with Mary.  She was out with her friend Janine.  His normal fiancé out doing normal things with her normal friends while he sat in their normal home quietly going out of his mind with longing to go back to Baker street.  Back to Sherlock.
John felt himself grow even more tense when he saw Sherlock Holmes standing in a corner talking to Dimmock, who was looking up at the dancer with something akin to hero worship.  John couldn’t blame him, Holmes was astonishingly good looking.  He was wearing a midnight blue button-down shirt with black jeans.  The buttons looked like they were straining to stay in place and the jeans moulded to his every curve.  John had no idea if this was his usual look or if he was on the pull, and he didn’t want to find out.  He headed in the opposite direction, hoping to find Molly in the crowd.  She was the one person who knew everything about him and therefore the only one he would feel at ease with tonight.
Sherlock busied himself with getting the wrinkles out of his shirt, and John dropped his gaze so he wouldn’t once again fixate on Sherlock’s fit torso.  His eyes fell on the bulge in Sherlock’s tights, which he knew was from a dance belt.  He privately wished he had one, he might have stood the chance of making it through the day with his dignity. He’d thought about wearing his cup, but it would have been obvious he had one on and didn’t feel like explaining why.
Molly started to protest, but John held up his hand.  “It’s alright, Molly, I’ll spill.”  He sat down.  “His name was James Sholto.  He was a lecturer at Loudain, a teaching fellow.  I barely made it halfway through the semester before I’d fallen for him.  He never seemed to mind that I always had questions.  It seemed to fuel his enthusiasm.  He…he kept looking at me during lecture.  As if I was the only one in the room.  But I knew it would be stupid to approach him, then.  So, I kept it to myself until term ended.”
Sherlock gave him a half smile.  “I don’t believe it’s going to be an issue for you, John, since you don’t have casual sex.  I can’t see you falling in love with an arsehole who couldn’t be trusted with…well, your arsehole.”  They both burst into laughter, and John felt some of his tension drain.
One lazy Sunday, John was lounging in his room with tea and toast when his mobile chimed.  Irene had posted a video of Sherlock, and as usual John was unable to resist watching it.  Except this time…this time Irene had gone too far.  How had she
At the end of the evening, John drew a hot bath, and they reclined in the tub as John washed Sherlock with a bar of soap made from goat’s milk and honey.  Afterward, they lay in bed, Sherlock snuggled up to John’s side.  As a final touch, John had lit some beeswax candles around the room.  “So, Sherlock, did you enjoy your Valentine’s Day?”
John’s brow furrowed and he cupped Sherlock’s cheek with his hand.  “I thought sex was supposed to be about making
there were so many sexual thoughts.  Every time he was in the mood for a wank (which was a lot lately) he had to forcibly stop himself from going to Instagram to watch Sherlock dancing.  That’s how bad it was getting.  Every time his mobile alerted him to a new video by Irene, his cock twitched.  He always had mixed feelings if it turned out to be someone other than Sherlock, and ended up with a raging debate inside of him if it
Irene held up her hand.  “Nope, I’ve heard it from Molly, fast forward through that.  Did you realise you were demi then?  Or did it take it happening a second time?”
.”  He smiled again.  “They’re a favourite of bees.  You’ve noticed that I’ve become rather interested in apiology.”
He stared down at them, knowing what they were immediately.  But the fact that they had been inside Sherlock’s room in a box full of sex toys was so incongruous that he spent long minutes trying to figure out if in his grief he’d started hallucinating.  One of the objects was a pair of red pants which looked remarkably like the ones he owned, but it couldn’t possibly be them because why would Sherlock have his pants?  It had to be a coincidence.  For one thing, these clearly had been used because they bore the signs of being washed regularly.  John had never worn the pants he bought.
“Can we try something I’ve seen in pornos?  It looks like something that will make us both feel good at the same time.”
halftime, didn’t prepare me for when I had to spray you down earlier. It drove me bloody mad to touch you and not be able to…
Irene tilted her head.  “But developing feelings for someone changes that?  Like a switch gets flipped or something?”
John sucked in a sharp breath and gave Sherlock a heated look, setting his empty cup on a nearby bookshelf before taking Sherlock’s hand and leading him back to his bedroom.  As per his agreement with Molly, the music that had been playing in the background was subtly turned up quite a bit more than before.  By the time Sherlock and John entered the bedroom, the volume was perfect to mask whatever they got up to…if they weren’t too loud about it.  No guarantees.
John was lounging on a lab stool trying to make heads or tails of his lecture notes when Sherlock burst into the room, panting.  John stared at him in amazement.  He’d never seen Sherlock in a hurry before.  “Sorry, I’m late, we just finished rehearsal.”  Sherlock took off his coat and John saw that he was wearing an oversized sweatshirt over a leotard.  He’d obviously not taken the time to change before rushing over.
Sparing Molly only the briefest of glances, John stalked over to grab his jacket and then headed out the door before anyone could say another word.  What a nightmare.  He would have honestly preferred fending off the usual advances, because most of the time everyone else at the party was oblivious.  In this case, he wasn’t even propositioned, but now the whole fucking team was going to know what went down and have questions about it.
.  I’m so proud of you, John. And I’m really proud of Sherlock.  I have to call Irene!”  She leapt for her mobile.
Sherlock lifted his head and gazed down at him with darkened, intent eyes.  John reached up and threaded his fingers through the glorious mess of curls, tugging him back down for more kissing.  He lifted a leg and curved it across Sherlock’s backside, encouraging him to continue the small thrusts that were driving him crazy.
“Ah Christ, John, why’d you have to go and do that?”  John looked up at Greg in surprise.  Unlike the others, he looked disappointed.  John would have thought if anyone was going to look like that it would be Dimmock.  John glanced over, and he seemed envious but not really bothered.
Sherlock snorted and came over.  “He’s a brilliant chemist and a shite teacher.”  He pointed to the ingredient list.  “That should go before that, and you have to stir it at this point.”
Thinking about Sherlock’s initial assessment of Bainbridge’s stalker, John remembered that his exact words had been, “Uniform fetishist.”  Fetishist.  Military kink.
As everyone was putting on their training gear, Greg’s mobile chimed and he checked it.  Smiling, he tapped the screen a few times, and John heard the beginning of ‘Old Town Road.’
John realised that Irene must have posted a video, and Sally was featured.  He took out his mobile and checked.  To his surprise, he saw that it was a duet.  That was a first.  His eyebrows shot to the ceiling as he watched Sherlock and Sally writhing artistically around on a mattress to the song ‘Pillow Talk.’  They alternated between movements that conveyed conflict and intimacy.  It was tastefully done.  They weren’t outright simulating sex, but it was certainly suggestive.
John’s voice was shaky as he replied, “It feels as if every nerve ending in my body is sparking, hot and cold at the same time.  My heart is pounding, and it’s saying with every beat that this is right, this is good, this is
Sherlock gave him a warm smile.  “I just realised earlier when I was looking at that garish display that maybe now it wouldn’t be so bad to be…romanced.  Not with tedious red roses and pink hearts…” he wrinkled his nose.  “But something a little bit…shmoopy…wouldn’t be amiss.”  He bit his lip and looked at John from beneath his lashes.
“Not gay.” Sherlock ground the words out.  “You’re not gay, as you’ve made so clear to all and sundry for years now. So why are you tormenting me with this?  I thought we were past your desire to punish me for faking my death.”
John stepped into the flat.  “Hello, Sherlock.”  He cleared his throat.  Well this was off to a fine start.  He looked over at where Sherlock was standing, taking in his pajamas, dressing gown, and disheveled hair.  Likely he’d been at home all day sulking over the failure to solve their case yesterday.
Irene took a deep breath and adopted a breezy expression.  “Well, first of all, one of the featured participants is not a dancer.”  She turned to John.  “It’s fine though, since you won’t have to actually dance.”
But he didn’t really have that second chance now, did he?  Because of all the nights Sherlock could have come back, it had been the night that John proposed to someone else.  Mary, who chose to interpret him as saying she was the best thing to happen to him, when really he’d meant
John nodded.  “I also remember you deduced I wouldn’t fall for someone I couldn’t trust, and you were right.  I trust you completely.  Besides, I would be a nervous wreck if I tried to top you. I’d spend the whole time worrying that I’d hurt you and it just wouldn’t be a good time for either of us.”
Sherlock huffed out a disbelieving laugh, and John was shook to see tears in his eyes.  “I’m sorry, John.  You’re the only person who has ever made me feel…
If it had just been one thing or the other, John might have been able to reach a different conclusion.  If it had been just the pants, perhaps Sherlock liked the look of them and deduced that John would never wear them.  If it had been just the dog tags, maybe Sherlock had a military kink and it didn’t matter that they were John’s, they were just conveniently at hand.
Sherlock’s expression morphed into something more genuine and he cleared his throat.  “In fact, I have a little something for you.  Consider it a hostess gift.”  He pulled a small envelope out of his jacket pocket and handed it to her.  John recognised the logo of the shop Sherlock mentioned earlier.  Molly’s eyes widened when she saw it, and she quickly turned beet red.  “My only caveat to this gift is that whatever is purchased with the card,
have casual sex, they just don’t generally want to.  But in my case, you are correct.  I haven’t had sex yet.”
“John, this is Irene.  I hope you don’t mind that she’s here, she…um…offered to help unload stuff from your car.”
Irene waved her hand.  “Oh, they’re already following me.  Sally’s dating Greg Lestrade, and Sherlock’s slept with practically everyone else.”
But there was certainly something about having Sherlock’s hawk-like gaze on him.  Based on his Instagram posts and the stories told about him, it was apparent he was frightfully intelligent and observant.  John could only guess what the man could read from him, and for some reason he found the idea intriguing instead of off-putting.
Still though, he could feel his tension ramping up with each take, seeing Sherlock’s head lower to his and stopping short.  Sherlock kept jerking his head back far away every time Irene said, “Cut!”  Once again they were having technical difficulties – Sherlock kept missing the camera with the towel.  Every time they had to do the take over again, Sherlock would have to smooth out his shirt, stretching it taught against his chest to get out the wrinkles caused by John’s fist.  Each time, John would see every line of his pecs and his nipples.
.  As it happens, you’re better at deductions than you think.  There was someone.  The first person with whom I ever had a sexual relationship. Silly me, I thought because we were having sex that meant we were dating.  I wanted to stay the night and talk about our interests and hopes for the future and all that nonsense.  I wanted to do other things
A few times John had to get up to go fetch another drink, and he’d end up talking for a bit to Mike or a couple of folks he knew from lectures.  But he always came back to the sofa.  He was starting to feel looser and more relaxed, and so wasn’t on his guard when he encountered Bill and Anderson, who were both roaring drunk and immediately steered him away from the sofa.
have feelings.”  Molly threw up her hands.  Irene put her hand over her heart.  “Oh John, I’m so, so sorry.”
Irene made a frustrated sound, but chose instead to get even more personal.  “Do you get yourself off?”  John nodded, chuckling.  “How do you get in the mood for it?  Does porn do anything for you?”
Sherlock ran his fingers through John’s hair, massaging his scalp and pressing kisses to his neck and shoulders.  “You’re so gorgeous, John.  So perfect.”  He began kissing down John’s back, a reversal of earlier when he first came onto the bed.  More slowly this time, kissing and occasionally licking.  When he got to John’s arse, he was practically purring.  “I’ve been thinking about your arse, John.  So, so much.  If I were sentenced to death, I’d want this to be my last meal.”  As he said this, he was massaging each cheek in turn, kissing and licking and giving little nips.
Every time they met, John couldn’t help but ask probing questions to find out more about the enigma that was Sherlock Holmes.  He’d ask for clarification on some of the cases Sherlock posted about on Instagram, and after the fourth fascinating story it led to a discussion about what Sherlock wanted to do when he graduated.  Greg commented all the time that he should join the Met, but Sherlock didn’t like the idea of giving up control, following rules.  He’d rather work cases on his own and serve up the solution to the police on a silver platter.  It was the only interest of his he planned to pursue as a career.  Dancing and the violin were just hobbies, and the chemistry was to aid him in his work.
John stared at him in amazement.  All the pieces fell together.  Sherlock had been going through the same torture that he has this whole time.  And judging by the anguished look on his face, Sherlock clearly thought he’d just ruined things between them by voicing it aloud.  John didn’t care anymore if his heart ended up broken, he couldn’t deny either of them a moment longer.
Sherlock made a tsking noise.  “Molly Hooper, surely you’ve heard of switching?  And I don’t mean what is done with a flog.”
Molly made a sound of protest and Irene’s forehead wrinkled as she looked at her.  “Didn’t you say that John’s bi?  Then it’s not a problem.  Sherlock will be quite pleased to find out the team has a new member.  Fresh blood.”  Her smile turned feral.
“Don’t be absurd!”  It was Dimmock again.  He stood up, his expression hurt.  He stared at Sherlock for a few moments and then shook his head.  “So when you said you don’t get involved, what you really meant was that you don’t get involved with
John had to quell the visual that popped into his head of what Sherlock would look like using it.  His friend was
John found similarly hilarious exchanges on many of the pictures.  And some of the stuff on chemistry and forensics were pretty fascinating.  He thought about hitting the follow button on Sherlock’s account, but if what Irene said was true, it was better not to draw attention to himself.
He was glad when he could finally escape to his room to get ready for the party.  He lingered in the shower, looking down at his body and marveling that a few short hours ago Sherlock’s hands and mouth had been on him.  His cock stiffened as he recalled Sherlock’s lips wrapped around it.  He shuddered at the memory and began leisurely stroking himself.  It would probably be a good idea to toss one off so he wouldn’t come too quickly later tonight.
John began to pump his cock in earnest, then realised it was the perfect time to prep himself a bit.  He bit back a groan as he massaged his hole with his finger.  He’d done this plenty of times in the past, often fantasising that it was Sherlock pushing into him.  But now there was purpose to it.  He felt light-headed at the thought that soon it would no longer be his imagination.  John’s mobile vibrated on the counter by the sink, and the thought that it might be Sherlock texting tipped John over the edge and he came hard, having barely got half his finger inserted.
Sherlock pressed his lips together and glared at everyone, then headed towards the kitchen.  John looked around at his mates, his eyebrows raised.  “Well, then.  Look, it’s…heartwarming, how protective you lot are.  But you need to take it down a bit.  Sherlock and I will be fine.”  He slapped Greg on the back and then went after Sherlock.
Sherlock chuckled.  “Lavender is better.  I can dry them and the scent will last a long time.  Thank you, John.”  He finally reached out to accept the flowers.
He turned to step out of the kitchen, but then the import of his words sunk in.  Quite soon he was going to be penetrated for the first time in his life by the gorgeous man next to him.  As much as he wanted that, it was quite a significant thing to have happen to one’s body.  He spun back and added more scotch to his cup as fortification.
you…” She blushed harder, and John realised she must have told Irene a lot more than just his bisexuality.
John felt like he was on fire. Sherlock shifted down slightly so he could press kisses down John’s jaw, then neck, then across his clavicle.  Sherlock’s lips felt like flames licking at his skin.  When he reached John’s nipple, his tongue was a hot brand.  The scraping of his teeth was as a match being struck.  Soon John was feeling so sensitised that the fabric of their pants became an irritant on his skin.
Sherlock grinned.  “Is this The Talk?  The ‘don’t hurt him or we’ll beat you up’ talk?  How delightful.”
Sherlock growled as he clutched at his leg.  “Fuck, it’s a cramp.  My calf muscle.  Didn’t stretch properly before I left.  Stupid!”
John went back to her profile and tapped on the follow button.  “There, following you now.  And I’ll pass it on to the folks I know.  Perhaps the other rugby players once I get to know them.”
Irene folded her arms.  “I know what happened with you, but you were kids!  It’s practically a rite of passage for boys to be rejected by a lesbian.  Whatever else has happened to John, he refuses to say.”  She gave him a significant look.
Molly bit her lip.  “But she likes to be the one to…”  She stopped abruptly and put her hand on her mouth.  John wouldn’t have thought it possible for her to turn even redder, but she did.
Sherlock licked into his mouth, devouring him with his tongue.  John gave it back, dragging his teeth against Sherlock’s lower lip that he’s been obsessing about for weeks.  There had been so many times when he couldn’t focus on what Sherlock said to him because of that goddamn mouth of his, and now he was finally able to suck and bite and worship it.
sex.  But none of it has ever come close to hearing those words from you.  I’d have been shocked to hear them from anyone.  But the fact that they came from you, John.  You’re the only one that matters.”
For the first time since they became friends, John found himself feeling unreasonably angry with Molly.  He knew she understood people better than he did, but he couldn’t help but think she was wrong in this instance.
John didn’t know much about dancing, but he could tell what she meant.  The one woman and three other men – none of whom he recognised – all seemed a bit too stiff in their dancing, a bit too adherent to technical form.  From what John had seen on Instagram, Sherlock was very technically proficient, but he also had something they lacked – a fluidity of movement, grace, and passion.
He threw back the covers and started to get out of bed, but Sherlock’s hand on his arm made him pause.  Sherlock bit his lip.  “Do you think you could wait until after to make breakfast?”
John considered pretending Sholto had been a teaching assistant, but Irene was too shrewd.  “I don’t want to talk about it, Irene.  We were discussing demisexuality.  Did you have any other questions?”
John grimaced.  “Is that why you took off on me?”  He pulled back from the hug and looked into Sherlock’s eyes.  “Yeah she did turn my life around.  And I badly wanted to be happy in this new life.  But I wasn’t, Sherlock.  And it all came crashing down on me tonight.  I needed to come here straight away, and I’m so glad I did.  This feels so right.  This is what makes me happy.  I know it seems sudden to you, but this has been building ever since you got back.  I was in denial, just like before.  Except this time I dragged someone else into it.”
John chanced a look at Irene, who gave him a significant look and then shook her head in exasperation.  He turned away and concentrated on knotting the towel firmly again, relieved that he would no longer have to endure the torture of Sherlock’s hand or thigh brushing against him over and over.
Sherlock’s lips pressed together, and his breath hitched.  “I want to share everything with you, John.  My work.  My bed.  My heart.  Though it’s hardly sharing when it’s already fully yours.”
Sherlock’s smile was sardonic.  “Yes, well, no one ever wants to know mine.  By all means, feel free to deduce me as much as you like.”
John didn’t know what came over him, but he found himself protesting.  “Oi! Just because I’ve never had sex doesn’t mean I don’t know anything about flirting.  And I did some drama stuff in secondary school.”
Sherlock seemed to read his mind, because he continued.  “I told you I’m not some great beast.  I have no interest in making conquests.  I find the idea of persuading someone to sleep with me tedious. Especially if they’re an idiot, which most people are.”
John was nervous as hell in the cab to Baker Street.  He hoped that Sherlock was home.  He hadn’t texted him because he wasn’t sure what excuse he would come up with if Sherlock asked him why he wanted to come over.  It felt better to just spring it on him.
She scowled. “No, I’ll be the one giving her flowers!  I’m talking about for Sherlock.  He’s the only one of us that’s unattached, but that doesn’t mean he should do without.”
Molly folded her arms.  “So, you’re saying that you’ll just have sex with Sherlock, and then go back to being lab buddies? And when he sets his sights on the next new athlete, you’ll be fine with it?”  Her voice had a steely note he’d never heard before, as if daring him to answer her honestly.  Irene was staring at her with frank admiration.
Sherlock came up to John and put his arm around his shoulder.  “I don’t know what you all are talking about over here, but John doesn’t look happy and that concerns me.”
John cleared his throat and tried to be rational.  “I uh…think it works better with Sally.  The song is about a volatile relationship, and that describes theirs pretty well.”  He forced a chuckle.
One afternoon John came home after lecture to find Molly and Sherlock chatting on the sofa.  “This is a pleasant surprise.  Hello, Sherlock.”
Sherlock raised one eyebrow and then leaned in to brush his lips against John’s ear as he murmured, “Lead the way.
John chuckled.  “I did indeed, and I’m more than a little surprised that you would bring it up. You tend to reject all offers of food.”  Sherlock looked down at the blanket, his cheeks growing red as he fidgeted with the edge of it.  John tilted his head.  “You like the idea of me doting on you, is that it?”
Dimmock jerked his shoulder.  “Screw this.”  He stalked off towards the window that led to the fire escape currently populated with smokers.
John narrowed his eyes.  “Just so I get this right, and I’m going to take myself out of the equation here…  You’re saying people should avoid falling in love with Sherlock Holmes because he’ll keep them at arm’s length because he thinks they couldn’t love him.”
“Yes, Sherlock Holmes.  He was in the same ballet course where Molly and I met.  He and Molly and another dancer, Sally Donovan, are quite gracious to participate in my videos.  It’s been a lot of fun, but as I said, it’s more than just fun for me.  I want to be a choreographer.”
He finally looked up from the screen to see that Irene and Molly were regarding him with amusement.  Irene asked in a dry voice, “Well, what do you think?”
John knew deep down that Irene had not planned this deliberately.  It was the product of spur-of-the-moment brainstorming with people she might possibly work for.  But she couldn’t have picked a scenario more likely to torment him if she tried.  He couldn’t bring himself to say no, though.  This meant too much to her, and he had come to like her very much.
Sherlock abruptly stood up.  “I’m going to get a drink.”  He strode off.  Irene’s eyes widened and she shot up, taking off after him.
They turned to face each other.  Sherlock cleared his throat.  “Thank you for doing this for Irene.  This studio job is something she wants very badly, and this video…I think they’ll really like it.”  His tone was stilted.
John smiled.  “And that’s secondary attraction.  It’s fueled by your feelings for Molly.  Now, in the case of demisexuals, we generally don’t feel the primary attraction.  Some girl I meet might as well be a sister for all the notice I take of her body.  But once I feel a connection to her, that’s when I begin to start fixating on the curve of her neck, the soft rosy lips…” Irene cleared her throat loudly.  “…his strong jawline, the way his bicep flexes when he reaches up to write something on the blackboard…”  John silently cursed when he realised what he said.
